(Continued from Volume 8 Slice 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n10. MEDIEVAL DRAMA\r\n\r\n  Ecclesiastical and monastic literary drama.\r\n\r\n  Hrosvitha.\r\n\r\nWhile the scattered and persecuted strollers thus kept alive something\r\nof the popularity, if not of the loftier traditions, of their art,\r\nneither, on the other hand, was there an utter absence of written\r\ncompositions to bridge the gap between ancient and modern dramatic\r\nliterature. In the midst of the condemnation with which the Christian\r\nChurch visited the stage, its professors and votaries, we find\r\nindividual ecclesiastics resorting in their writings to both the tragic\r\nand the comic form of the ancient drama. These isolated productions,\r\nwhich include the [Greek: Christos paschôn] (_Passion of Christ_)\r\nformerly attributed to St Gregory Nazianzen, and the _Querolus_, long\r\nfathered upon Plautus himself, were doubtless mostly written for\r\neducational purposes--whether Euripides and Lycophron, or Menander,\r\nPlautus and Terence, served as the outward models. The same was probably\r\nthe design of the famous \"comedies\" of Hrosvitha, the Benedictine nun of\r\nGandersheim, in Eastphalian Saxony, which associate themselves in the\r\nhistory of Christian literature with the spiritual revival of the 10th\r\ncentury in the days of Otto the Great. While avowedly imitated in form\r\nfrom the comedies of Terence, these religious exercises derive their\r\nthemes--martyrdoms,[1] and miraculous or otherwise startling\r\nconversions[2]--from the legends of Christian saints. Thus, from perhaps\r\nthe 9th to the 12th centuries, Germany and France, and through the\r\nlatter, by means of the Norman Conquest, England, became acquainted with\r\nwhat may be called the literary monastic drama. It was no doubt\r\noccasionally performed by the children under the care of monks or nuns,\r\nor by the religious themselves; an exhibition of the former kind was\r\nthat of the _Play of St Katharine_, acted at Dunstable about the year\r\n1110 in \"copes\" by the scholars of the Norman Geoffrey, afterwards abbot\r\nof St Albans. Nothing is known concerning it except the fact of its\r\nperformance, which was certainly not regarded as a novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The joculatores, jongleurs, minstrels.\r\n\r\nThese efforts of the cloister came in time to blend themselves with more\r\npopular forms of the early medieval drama. The natural agents in the\r\ntransmission of these popular forms were those _mimes_, whom, while the\r\nrepresentatives of more elaborate developments, the \"pantomimes\" in\r\nparticular, had inevitably succumbed, the Roman drama had left surviving\r\nit, unextinguished and unextinguishable. Above all, it is necessary to\r\npoint out how in the long interval now in question--the \"dark ages,\"\r\nwhich may, from the present point of view, be reckoned from about the\r\n6th to the 11th century--the Latin and the Teutonic elements of what may\r\nbe broadly designated as medieval \"minstrelsy,\" more or less\r\nimperceptibly, coalesced. The traditions of the disestablished and\r\ndisendowed _mimus_ combined with the \"occupation\" of the Teutonic\r\n_scôp_, who as a professional personage does not occur in the earliest\r\nTeutonic poetry, but on the other hand is very distinctly traceable\r\nunder this name or that of the \"gleeman,\" in Anglo-Saxon literature,\r\nbefore it fell under the control of the Christian Church. Her influence\r\nand that of docile rulers, both in England and in the far wider area of\r\nthe Frank empire, gradually prevailed even over the inherited goodwill\r\nwhich neither Alfred nor even Charles the Great had denied to the\r\ncomposite growth in which _mimus_ and _scôp_ alike had a share.\r\n\r\nHow far the _joculatores_--which in the early middle ages came to be the\r\nname most widely given to these irresponsible transmitters of a great\r\nartistic trust--kept alive the usage of entertainments more essentially\r\ndramatic than the minor varieties of their performances, we cannot say.\r\nIn different countries these entertainers suited themselves to different\r\ntastes, and with the rise of native literatures to different literary\r\ntendencies. The literature of the _troubadours_ of Provence, which\r\ncommunicated itself to Spain and Italy, came only into isolated contact\r\nwith the beginnings of the religious drama; in northern France the\r\n_jongleurs_, as the _joculatores_ were now called, were confounded with\r\nthe _trouvères_, who, to the accompaniment of _vielle_ or harp, sang the\r\n_chansons de geste_ commemorative of deeds of war. As appointed servants\r\nof particular households they were here, and afterwards in England,\r\ncalled _menestrels_ (from _ministeriales_) or _minstrels_. Such a\r\n_histrio_ or _mimus_ (as he is called) was Taillefer, who rode first\r\ninto the fight at Hastings, singing his songs of Roland and Charlemagne,\r\nand tossing his sword in the air and catching it again. In England such\r\naccomplished minstrels easily outshone the less versatile gleemen of\r\npre-Norman times, and one or two of them appeared as landholders in\r\nDomesday Book, and many enjoyed the favour of the Norman, Angevin and\r\nPlantagenet kings. But here, as elsewhere, the humbler members of the\r\ncraft spent their lives in strolling from castle to convent, from\r\nvillage-green to city-street, and there exhibiting their skill as\r\ndancers, tumblers, jugglers proper, and as masquers and conductors of\r\nbears and other dumb contributors to popular wonder and merriment. Their\r\nonly chance of survival finally came to lie in organization under the\r\nprotection of powerful nobles; but when, in the 15th century in England,\r\ncompanies of players issued forth from towns and villages, the\r\nprofession, in so far as its members had not secured preference, saw\r\nitself threatened with ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Survivals and adaptations of pagan festive ceremonies and usages.\r\n\r\nIn any attempt to explain the transmission of dramatic elements from\r\npagan to Christian times, and the influence exercised by this\r\ntransmission upon the beginnings of the medieval drama, account should\r\nfinally be taken of the pertinacious survival of popular festive rites\r\nand ceremonies. From the days of Gregory the Great, i.e. from the end of\r\nthe 6th century onwards, the Western Church tolerated and even attracted\r\nto her own festivals popular customs, significant of rejoicing, which\r\nwere in truth relics of heathen ritual. Such were the Mithraic feast of\r\nthe 25th of December, or the egg of Eostre-tide, and a multitude of\r\nCeltic or Teutonic agricultural ceremonies. These rites, originally\r\nsymbolical of propitiation or of weather-magic, were of a semi-dramatic\r\nnature--such as the dipping of the neck of corn in water, sprinkling\r\nholy drops upon persons or animals, processions of beasts or men in\r\nbeast-masks, dressing trees with flowers, and the like, but above all\r\nceremonial dances, often in disguise. The sword-dance, recorded by\r\nTacitus, of which an important feature was the symbolic threat of death\r\nto a victim, endured (though it is rarely mentioned) to the later middle\r\nages. By this time it had attracted to itself a variety of additional\r\nfeatures, and of characters familiar as pace-eggers, mummers,\r\nmorris-dancers (probably of distinct origin), who continually enlarged\r\nthe scope of their performances, especially as regarded their comic\r\nelement. The dramatic \"expulsion of death,\" or winter, by the\r\ndestruction of a lay-figure--common through western Europe about the 8th\r\ncentury--seems connected with a more elaborate rite, in which a\r\ndisguised performer (who perhaps originally represented summer) was\r\nslain and afterwards revived (the _Pfingstl_, Jack in the Green, or\r\nGreen Knight). This representation, after acquiring a comic complexion,\r\nwas annexed by the character dancers, who about the 15th century took to\r\nadding still livelier incidents from songs treating of popular heroes,\r\nsuch as St George and Robin Hood; which latter found a place in the\r\nfestivities of May Day with their central figure, the May Queen. The\r\nearliest ceremonial observances of this sort were clearly connected with\r\npastoral and agricultural life; but the inhabitants of the towns also\r\ncame to have a share in them; and so, as will be seen later, did the\r\nclergy. They were in particular responsible for the buffooneries of the\r\nfeast of fools (or asses), which enjoyed the greatest popularity in\r\nFrance (though protests against it are on record from the 11th century\r\nonwards to the 17th), but was well known from London to Constantinople.\r\nThis riotous New Year's celebration was probably derived from the\r\nancient Kalend feasts, which may have bequeathed to it both the\r\nhobby-horse and the lord, or bishop, of misrule. In the 16th century the\r\nfeast of fools was combined with the elaborate festivities of courts and\r\ncities during the twelve Christmas feast-days--the season when\r\nthroughout the previous two centuries the \"mummers\" especially\r\nflourished, who in their disguisings and \"_viseres_\" began as dancers\r\ngesticulating in dumb-show, but ultimately developed into actors proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The liturgy the main source of the medieval religious drama.\r\n\r\n  Tropes.\r\n\r\nThus the literary and the professional element, as well as that of\r\npopular festive usages, had survived to become tributaries to the main\r\nstream of the early Christian drama, which had its direct source in the\r\nliturgy of the Church itself. The service of the Mass contains in itself\r\ndramatic elements, and combines with the reading out of portions of\r\nScripture by the priest--its \"epical\" part--a \"lyrical\" part in the\r\nanthems and responses of the congregation. At a very early\r\nperiod--certainly already in the 5th century--it was usual on special\r\noccasions to increase the attractions of public worship by living\r\npictures, illustrating the Gospel narrative and accompanied by songs;\r\nand thus a certain amount of action gradually introduced itself into the\r\nservice. The insertion, before or after sung portions of the service, of\r\ntropes, originally one or more verses of texts, usually serving as\r\nintroits and in connexion with the gospel of the day, and recited by the\r\ntwo halves of the choir, naturally led to dialogue chanting; and this\r\nwas frequently accompanied by illustrative fragments of action, such as\r\ndrawing down the veil from before the altar.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The liturgical mystery.\r\n\r\nThis practice of interpolations in the offices of the church, which is\r\nattested by texts from the 9th century onwards (the so-called\r\n\"Winchester tropes\" belong to the 10th and 11th), progressed, till on\r\nthe great festivals of the church the epical part of the liturgy was\r\nsystematically connected with spectacular and in some measure mimical\r\nadjuncts, the lyrical accompaniment being of course retained. Thus the\r\n_liturgical mystery_--the earliest form of the Christian drama--was\r\ngradually called into existence. This had certainly been accomplished as\r\nearly as the 10th century, when on great ecclesiastical festivals it was\r\ncustomary for the priests to perform in the churches these offices (as\r\nthey were called). The whole Easter story, from the burial to Emmaus,\r\nwas thus presented, the Maries and the angel adding their lyrical\r\n_planctus_; while the surroundings of the Nativity--the Shepherds, the\r\nInnocents, &c.--were linked with the Shepherds of Epiphany by a\r\nrecitation of \"Prophets,\" including Vergil and the Sibyl. Before long,\r\nfrom the 11th century onwards, _mysteries_, as they were called, were\r\nproduced in France on scriptural subjects unconnected with the great\r\nChurch festivals--such as the Wise and Foolish Virgins, Adam (with the\r\nfall of Lucifer), Daniel, Lazarus, &c. Compositions on the last-named\r\ntwo themes remain from the hand of one of the very earliest of medieval\r\nplay-writers, Hilarius, who may have been an Englishman, and who\r\ncertainly studied under Abelard. He also wrote a \"miracle\" of St\r\nNicholas, one of the most widely popular of medieval saints. Into the\r\npieces founded on the Scripture narrative outside characters and\r\nincidents were occasionally introduced, by way of diverting the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The collective mystery.\r\n\r\nThese mysteries and miracles being as yet represented by the clergy\r\nonly, the language in which they were usually written is Latin--in many\r\nvarieties of verse with occasional prose; but already in the 11th\r\ncentury the further step was taken of composing these texts in the\r\nvernacular--the earliest example being the mystery of the Resurrection.\r\nIn time a whole series of mysteries was joined together; a process which\r\nwas at first roughly and then more elaborately pursued in France and\r\nelsewhere, and finally resulted in the _collective mystery_--merely a\r\nscholars' term of course, but one to which the principal examples of the\r\nEnglish mystery-drama correspond.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mysteries, miracles, and morals distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe productions of the medieval religious drama it is usual technically\r\nto divide into three classes. The _mysteries_ proper deal with\r\nscriptural events only, their purpose being to set forth, with the aid\r\nof the prophetic or preparatory history of the Old Testament, and more\r\nespecially of the fulfilling events of the New, the central mystery of\r\nthe Redemption of the world, as accomplished by the Nativity, the\r\nPassion and the Resurrection. But in fact these were not kept\r\ndistinctly apart from the _miracle-plays_, or _miracles_, which are\r\nstrictly speaking concerned with the legends of the saints of the\r\nchurch; and in England the name _mysteries_ was not in use. Of these\r\nspecies the miracles must more especially have been fed from the\r\nresources of the monastic literary drama. Thirdly, the _moralities_, or\r\n_moral-plays_, teach and illustrate the same truths--not, however, by\r\ndirect representation of scriptural or legendary events and personages,\r\nbut allegorically, their characters being personified virtues or\r\nqualities. Of the moralities the Norman _trouvères_ had been the\r\ninventors; and doubtless this innovation connects itself with the\r\nendeavour, which in France had almost proved victorious by the end of\r\nthe 13th century, to emancipate dramatic performances from the control\r\nof the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The clergy and the religious drama.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the clergy towards the dramatic performances which had\r\narisen out of the elaboration of the services of the church, but soon\r\nadmitted elements from other sources, was not, and could not be,\r\nuniform. As the plays grew longer, their paraphernalia more extensive,\r\nand their spectators more numerous, they began to be represented outside\r\nas well as inside the churches, at first in the churchyards, and the use\r\nof the vulgar tongue came to be gradually preferred. A Beverley\r\nResurrection play (1220 c.) and some others are bilingual. Miracles were\r\nless dependent on this connexion with the church services than mysteries\r\nproper; and lay associations, gilds, and schools in particular, soon\r\nbegan to act plays in honour of their patron saints in or near their own\r\nhalls. Lastly, as scenes and characters of a more or less trivial\r\ndescription were admitted even into the plays acted or superintended by\r\nthe clergy, as some of these characters came to be depended on by the\r\naudiences for conventional extravagance or fun, every new Herod seeking\r\nto out-Herod his predecessor, and the devils and their chief asserting\r\nthemselves as indispensable favourites, the comic element in the\r\nreligious drama increased; and that drama itself, even where it remained\r\nassociated with the church, grew more and more profane. The endeavour to\r\nsanctify the popular tastes to religious uses, which connects itself\r\nwith the institution of the great festival of Corpus Christi (1264,\r\nconfirmed 1311), when the symbol of the mystery of the Incarnation was\r\nborne in solemn procession, led to the closer union of the dramatic\r\nexhibitions (hence often called _processus_) with this and other\r\nreligious feasts; but it neither limited their range nor controlled\r\ntheir development.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Progress of the medieval drama in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to condense into a few sentences the extremely varied\r\nhistory of the processes of transformation undergone by the medieval\r\ndrama in Europe during the two centuries--from about 1200 to about\r\n1400--in which it ran a course of its own, and during the succeeding\r\nperiod, in which it was only partially affected by the influence of the\r\nRenaissance. A few typical phenomena may, however, be noted in the case\r\nof the drama of each of the several chief countries of the West; where\r\nthe vernacular successfully supplanted Latin as the ordinary medium of\r\ndramatic speech, where song was effectually ousted by recitation and\r\ndialogue, and where finally, though the emancipation was on this head\r\nnowhere absolute, the religious drama gave place to the secular.\r\n\r\n\r\n  France.\r\n\r\nIn France, where dramatic performances had never fallen entirely into\r\nthe hands of the clergy, the progress was speediest and most decided\r\ntowards forms approaching those of the modern drama. The earliest play\r\nin the French tongue, however, the 12th-century _Adam_, supposed to have\r\nbeen written by a Norman in England (as is a fragmentary _Résurrection_\r\nof much the same date), still reveals its connexion with the liturgical\r\ndrama. Jean Bodel of Arras' miracle-play of _St Nicolas_ (before 1205)\r\nis already the production of a secular author, probably designed for the\r\nedification of some civic confraternity to which he belonged, and has\r\nsome realistic features. On the other hand, the _Theophilus_ of Rutebeuf\r\n(d. c. 1280) treats its Faust-like theme, with which we meet again in\r\nLow-German dramatic literature two centuries later, in a rather lifeless\r\nform but in a highly religious spirit, and belongs to the cycle of\r\nmiracles of the Virgin of which examples abound throughout this period.\r\nEaster or Passion plays were fully established in popular acceptance in\r\nParis as well as in other towns of France by the end of the 14th\r\ncentury; and in 1402 the _Confrérie de la Passion_, who at first devoted\r\nthemselves exclusively to the performance of this species, obtained a\r\nroyal privilege for the purpose. These series of religious plays were\r\nboth extensive and elaborate; perhaps the most notable series (c. 1450)\r\nis that by Arnoul Greban, who died as a canon of Le Mans, his native\r\ntown. Its revision, by Jean Michel, containing much illustrative detail\r\n(first performed at Angers in 1486), was very popular. Still more\r\nelaborate is the Rouen Christmas mystery of 1474, and the celebrated\r\n_Mystère du vieil testament_, produced at Abbeville in 1458, and\r\nperformed at Paris in 1500. Most of the Provençal Christmas and Passion\r\nplays date from the 14th century, as well as a miracle of St Agnes. The\r\nmiracles of saints were popular in all parts of France, and the\r\ndiversity of local colouring naturally imparted to these productions\r\ncontributed materially to the growth of the early French drama. The\r\nmiracles of Ste Geneviève and St Denis came directly home to the\r\ninhabitants of Paris, as that of St Martin to the citizens of Tours;\r\nwhile the early victories of St Louis over the English might claim a\r\nnational significance for the dramatic celebration of his deeds. The\r\nlocal saints of Provence were in their turn honoured by miracles dating\r\nfrom the 15th and 16th centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is less easy to trace the origins of the comic medieval drama in\r\nFrance, connected as they are with an extraordinary variety of\r\nassociations for professional, pious and pleasurable purposes. The _ludi\r\ninhonesti_ in which the students of a Paris college (Navarre) were in\r\n1315 debarred from engaging cannot be proved to have been dramatic\r\nperformances; the earliest known secular plays presented by university\r\nstudents in France were moralities, performed in 1426 and 1431. These\r\nplays, depicting conflicts between opposing influences--and at bottom\r\nthe struggle between good and evil in the human soul--become more\r\nfrequent from about this time onwards. Now it is (at Rennes in 1439) the\r\ncontention between _Bien-avisé_ and _Mal-avisé_ (who at the close find\r\nthemselves respectively in charge of _Bonne-fin_ and _Male-fin_); now,\r\none between _l'homme juste_ and _l'homme mondain_; now, the contrasted\r\nstory of _Les Enfants de Maintenant_, who, however, is no abstraction,\r\nbut an honest baker with a wife called Mignotte. Political and social\r\nproblems are likewise treated; and the _Mystère du Concile de Bâle_--an\r\nhistorical morality--dates back to 1432. But thought is taken even more\r\nlargely of the sufferings of the people than of the controversies of the\r\nChurch; and in 1507 we even meet with a hygienic or abstinence morality\r\n(by N. de la Chesnaye) in which \"Banquet\" enters into a conspiracy with\r\n\"Apoplexy,\" \"Epilepsy\" and the whole regiment of diseases.\r\n\r\nLong before this development of an artificial species had been\r\nconsummated--from the beginning of the 14th century onwards--the famous\r\nfraternity or professional union of the Basoche (clerks of the Parlement\r\nand the Châtelet) had been entrusted with the conduct of popular\r\nfestivals at Paris, in which, as of right, they took a prominent\r\npersonal share; and from a date unknown they had performed plays. But\r\nafter the _Confrérie de la Passion_ had been allowed to monopolize the\r\nreligious drama, the _basochiens_ had confined themselves to the\r\npresentment of moralities and of farces (from Italian _farsa_, Latin\r\n_farcita_), in which political satire had as a matter of course when\r\npossible found a place. A third association, calling themselves the\r\n_Enfans sans souci_, had, apparently also early in the 15th century,\r\nacquired celebrity by their performances of short comic plays called\r\nsoties--in which, as it would seem, at first allegorical figures\r\nironically \"played the fool,\" but which were probably before long not\r\nvery carefully kept distinct from the farces of the Basoche, and were\r\nlike these on occasion made to serve the purposes of State or of Church.\r\nOther confraternities and associations readily took a leaf out of the\r\nbook of these devil-may-care good-fellows, and interwove their religious\r\nand moral plays with comic scenes and characters from actual life, thus\r\nbecoming more and more free and secular in their dramatic methods, and\r\nunconsciously preparing the transition to the regular drama.\r\n\r\nThe earliest example of a serious secular play known to have been\r\nwritten in the French tongue is the _Estoire de Griseldis_ (1393); which\r\nis in the style of the miracles of the Virgin, but is largely indebted\r\nto Petrarch. The _Mystère du siege d'Orléans_, on the other hand,\r\nwritten about half a century later, in the epic tediousness of its\r\nmanner comes near to a chronicle history, and interests us chiefly as\r\nthe earliest of many efforts to bring Joan of Arc on the stage. Jacques\r\nMilet's celebrated mystery of the _Destruction de Troye la grant_ (1452)\r\nseems to have been addressed to readers and not to hearers only. The\r\nbeginnings of the French regular comic drama are again more difficult to\r\nextract from the copious literature of farces and soties, which, after\r\nmingling actual types with abstract and allegorical figures, gradually\r\ncame to exclude all but the concrete personages; moreover, the large\r\nmajority of these productions in their extant form belong to a later\r\nperiod than that now under consideration. But there is ample evidence\r\nthat the most famous of all medieval farces, the immortal _Maistre\r\nPierre Pathelin_ (otherwise _L'Avocat Pathelin_), was written before\r\n1470 and acted by the _basochiens_; and we may conclude that this\r\ndelightful story of the biter bit, and the profession outwitted,\r\ntypifies a multitude of similar comic episodes of real life, dramatized\r\nfor the delectation of clerks, lawyers and students, and of all lovers\r\nof laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Netherlands.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbouring Netherlands many Easter and Christmas mysteries are\r\nnoted from the middle of the 15th century, attesting the enduring\r\npopularity of these religious plays; and with them the celebrated series\r\nof the Seven Joys of Maria--of which the first is the Annunciation and\r\nthe seventh the Ascension. To about the same date belongs the small\r\ngroup of the so-called _abele spelen_ (as who should say plays easily\r\nmanaged), chiefly on chivalrous themes. Though allegorical figures are\r\nalready to be found in the Netherlands miracles of Mary, the species of\r\nthe moralities was specially cultivated during the great Burgundian\r\nperiod of this century by the chambers or lodges of the _Rederijkers_\r\n(rhetoricians)--the well-known civic associations which devoted\r\nthemselves to the cultivation of learned poetry and took an active share\r\nin the festivals that formed one of the most characteristic features of\r\nthe life of the Low Countries. Among these moralities was that of\r\n_Elckerlijk_ (printed 1495 and presumably by Peter Dorlandus), which\r\nthere is good reason for regarding as the original of one of the finest\r\nof English moralities, _Everyman_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italy.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the liturgical drama must have run its course as elsewhere; but\r\nthe traces of it are few, and confined to the north-east. The collective\r\nmystery, so common in other Western countries, is in Italian literature\r\nrepresented by a single example only--a _Passione di Gesù Cristo_,\r\nperformed at Revello in Saluzzo in the 15th century; though there are\r\nsome traces of other cyclic dramas of the kind. The Italian religious\r\nplays, called _figure_ when on Old, _vangeli_ when on New, Testament\r\nsubjects, and differing from those of northern Europe chiefly by the\r\nless degree of coarseness in their comic characters, seem largely to\r\nhave sprung out of the development of the processional element in the\r\nfestivals of the Church. Besides such processions as that of the Three\r\nKings at Epiphany in Milan, there were the penitential processions and\r\nsongs (_laude_), which at Assisi, Perugia and elsewhere already\r\ncontained a dramatic element; and at Siena, Florence and other centres\r\nthese again developed into the so-called (_sacre_) _rappresentazioni_,\r\nwhich became the most usual name for this kind of entertainment. Such a\r\npiece was the _San Giovanni e San Paolo_ (1489), by Lorenzo the\r\nMagnificent--the prince who afterwards sought to reform the Italian\r\nstage by paganizing it; another was the _Santa Teodora_, by Luigi Pulci\r\n(d. 1487); _San Giovanni Gualberto_ (of Florence) treats the religious\r\nexperience of a latter-day saint; _Rosana e Ulimento_ is a love-story\r\nwith a Christian moral. Passion plays were performed at Rome in the\r\nColiseum by the _Compagnia del Gonfalone_; but there is no evidence on\r\nthis head before the end of the 15th century. In general, the\r\nspectacular magnificence of Italian theatrical displays accorded with\r\nthe growing pomp of the processions both ecclesiastical and lay--called\r\n_trionfi_ already in the days of Dante; while the religious drama\r\ngradually acquired an artificial character and elaboration of form\r\nassimilating it to the classical attempts, to be noted below, which gave\r\nrise to the regular Italian drama. The poetry of the Troubadours, which\r\nhad come from Provence into Italy, here frequently took a dramatic form,\r\nand may have suggested some of his earlier poetic experiments to\r\nPetrarch.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of course that remnants of the ancient popular dramatic\r\nentertainments should have survived in particular abundance on Italian\r\nsoil. They were to be recognized in the improvised farces performed at\r\nthe courts, in the churches (_farse spirituali_), and among the people;\r\nthe Roman carnival had preserved its wagon-plays, and various links\r\nremained to connect the modern comic drama of the Italians with the\r\n_Atellanes_ and _mimes_ of their ancestors. But the more notable later\r\ncomic developments, which belong to the 16th century, will be more\r\nappropriately noticed below. Moralities proper had not flourished in\r\nItaly, where the love of the concrete has always been dominant in\r\npopular taste; more numerous are examples of scenes, largely\r\nmythological, in which the influence of the Renaissance is already\r\nperceptible, of eclogues, and of allegorical festival-plays of various\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Spain.\r\n\r\nIn Spain hardly a monument of the medieval religious drama has been\r\npreserved. There is manuscript evidence of the 11th century attesting\r\nthe early addition of dramatic elements to the Easter office; and a\r\nSpanish fragment of the Three Kings Epiphany play, dating from the 12th\r\ncentury, is, like the French _Adam_, one of the very earliest examples\r\nof the medieval drama in the vernacular. But that religious plays were\r\nperformed in Spain is clear from the permission granted by Alphonso X.\r\nof Castile (d. 1284) to the clergy to represent them, while prohibiting\r\nthe performance by them of _juegos de escarnio_ (mocking plays). The\r\nearliest Spanish plays which we possess belong to the end of the 15th or\r\nbeginning of the 16th century, and already show humanistic influence. In\r\n1472 the couplets of _Mingo Revulgo_ (i.e. Domingo Vulgus, the common\r\npeople), and about the same time another dialogue by the same author,\r\noffer examples of a sort resembling the Italian _contrasti_ (see below).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Germany.\r\n\r\nThe German religious plays in the vernacular, the earliest of which date\r\nfrom the 14th and 15th centuries, and were produced at Trier,\r\nWolfenbuttel, Innsbruck, Vienna, Berlin, &c., were of a simple kind; but\r\nin some of them, though they were written by clerks, there are traces of\r\nthe minstrels' hands. The earliest complete Christmas play in German,\r\ncontained in a 14th-century St Gallen MS., has nothing in it to suggest\r\na Latin original. On the other hand, the play of _The Wise and the\r\nFoolish Virgins_, in a Thuringian MS. thought to be as early as 1328, a\r\npiece of remarkable dignity, was evidently based on a Latin play. Other\r\nfestivals besides Christmas were celebrated by plays; but down to the\r\nReformation Easter enjoyed a preference. In the same century\r\nmiracle-plays began to be performed, in honour of St Catherine, St\r\nDorothea and other saints. But all these productions seem to belong to a\r\nperiod when the drama was still under ecclesiastical control. Gradually,\r\nas the liturgical drama returned to the simpler forms from which it had\r\nso surprisingly expanded, and ultimately died out, the religious plays\r\nperformed outside the churches expanded more freely; and the type of\r\nmystery associated with the name of the Frankfort canon Baldemar von\r\nPeterweil communicated itself, with other examples, to the receptive\r\nregion of the south-west. The Corpus Christi plays, or (as they were here\r\ncalled) _Frohnleichnamsspiele_, are notable, since that of Innsbruck\r\n(1391) is probably the earliest extant example of its class. The number\r\nof non-scriptural religious plays in Germany was much smaller than that\r\nin France; but it may be noted that (in accordance with a long-enduring\r\npopular notion) the theme of the last judgment was common in Germany in\r\nthe latter part of the middle ages. Of this theme _Antichrist_ may be\r\nregarded as an episode, though in 1469 an _Antichrist_ appears to have\r\noccupied at Frankfort four days in its performance. The earlier (12th\r\ncentury) _Antichrist_ is a production quite unique of its kind; this\r\npolitical protest breathes the Ghibelline spirit of the reign (Frederick\r\nBarbarossa's) in which it was composed.\r\n\r\nThough many of the early German plays contain an element of the\r\nmoralities, there were few representative German examples of the\r\nspecies. The academical instinct, or some other influence, kept the more\r\nelaborate productions on the whole apart from the drolleries of the\r\nprofessional strollers (_fahrende Leute_), whose Shrove-Tuesday plays\r\n(_Fastnachtsspiele_) and cognate productions reproduced the practical\r\nfun of common life. Occasionally, no doubt, as in the Lübeck\r\n_Fastnachtsspiel_ of the Five Virtues, the two species may have more or\r\nless closely approached to one another. When, in the course of the 15th\r\ncentury, Hans Rosenplüt, called Schnepperer--or Hans Schnepperer, called\r\nRosenplüt--the predecessor of Hans Sachs, first gave a more enduring\r\nform to the popular Shrove-Tuesday plays, a connexion was already\r\nestablishing itself between the dramatic amusements of the people and\r\nthe literary efforts of the \"master-singers\" of the towns. But, while\r\nthe main productivity of the writers of moralities and cognate\r\nproductions--a species particularly suited to German latitudes--falls\r\ninto the periods of Renaissance and Reformation, the religious drama\r\nproper survived far beyond either in Catholic Germany, and, in fact, was\r\nnot suppressed in Bavaria and Tirol till the end of the 18th century.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sweden, Carpathian lands, &c.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the performance of miracle-plays is traceable in\r\nSweden in the latter half of the 14th century; and that the German\r\nclerks and laymen who immigrated into the Carpathian lands, and into\r\nGalicia in particular, in the later middle ages, brought with them their\r\nreligious plays together with other elements of culture. This fact is\r\nthe more striking, inasmuch as, though Czech Easter plays were performed\r\nabout the end of the 14th century, we hear of none among the Magyars, or\r\namong their neighbours of the Eastern empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Religious drama in England.\r\n\r\n  Cornish miracle-plays.\r\n\r\nComing now to the English religious drama, we find that from its extant\r\nliterature a fair general idea may be derived of the character of these\r\nmedieval productions. The _miracle-plays_, _miracles_ or _plays_ (these\r\nbeing the terms used in England) of which we hear in London in the 12th\r\ncentury were probably written in Latin and acted by ecclesiastics; but\r\nalready in the following century mention is made--in the way of\r\nprohibition--of plays acted by professional players. (Isolated\r\nmoralities of the 12th century are not to be regarded as popular\r\nproductions.) In England as elsewhere, the clergy either sought to\r\nretain their control over the religious plays, which continued to be\r\noccasionally acted in churches even after the Reformation, or else\r\nreprobated them with or without qualifications. In Cornwall miracles in\r\nthe native Cymric dialect were performed at an early date; but those\r\nwhich have been preserved are apparently copies of English (with the\r\noccasional use of French) originals; they were represented, unlike the\r\nEnglish plays, in the open country, in extensive amphitheatres\r\nconstructed for the purpose--one of which, at St Just near Penzance, has\r\nrecently been restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Localities of the performance of miracle-plays.\r\n\r\n  The York, Towneley, Chester and Coventry plays.\r\n\r\nThe flourishing period of English miracle-plays begins with the practice\r\nof their performance by trading-companies in the towns, though these\r\nbodies were by no means possessed of any special privileges for the\r\npurpose. Of this practice Chester is said to have set the example\r\n(1268-1276); it was followed in the course of the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies by many other towns, while in yet others traces of such\r\nperformances are not to be found till the 15th, or even the 16th. These\r\ntowns with their neighbourhoods include, starting from East Anglia,\r\nwhere the religious drama was particularly at home, Wymondham, Norwich,\r\nSleaford, Lincoln, Leeds, Wakefield, Beverley, York, Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nwith a deviation across the border to Edinburgh and Aberdeen. In the\r\nnorth-west they are found at Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Chester;\r\nwhence they may be supposed to have migrated to Dublin. In the west they\r\nare noticeable at Shrewsbury, Worcester and Tewkesbury; in the Midlands\r\nat Coventry and Leicester; in the east at Cambridge and Bassingbourne,\r\nHeybridge and Manningtree; to which places have to be added Reading,\r\nWinchester, Canterbury, Bethesda and London, in which last the\r\nperformers were the parish-clerks. Four collections, in addition to some\r\nsingle examples of such plays, have come down to us, the _York_ plays,\r\nthe so-called _Towneley_ plays, which were probably acted at the fairs\r\nof Widkirk, near Wakefield, and those bearing the names of _Chester_ and\r\nof _Coventry_. Their dates, in the forms in which they have come down to\r\nus, are more or less uncertain; that of the _York_ may on the whole be\r\nconcluded to be earlier than that of the _Towneley_, which were probably\r\nput together about the middle of the 14th century; the _Chester_ may be\r\nascribed to the close of the 14th or the earlier part of the 15th; the\r\nbody of the _Coventry_ probably belongs to the 15th or 16th. Many of the\r\nindividual plays in these collections were doubtless founded on French\r\noriginals; others are taken direct from Scripture, from the apocryphal\r\ngospels, or from the legends of the saints. Their characteristic feature\r\nis the combination of a whole series of plays into one _collective_\r\nwhole, exhibiting the entire course of Bible history from the creation\r\nto the day of judgment. For this combination it is unnecessary to\r\nsuppose that they were generally indebted to foreign examples, though\r\nthere are several remarkable coincidences between the Chester plays and\r\nthe French _Mystère du vieil testament_. Indeed, the oldest of the\r\nseries--the _York_ plays--exhibits a fairly close parallel to the scheme\r\nof the _Cursor mundi_, an epic poem of Northumbrian origin, which early\r\nin the 14th century had set an example of treatment that unmistakably\r\ninfluenced the collective mysteries as a whole. Among the isolated plays\r\nof the same type which have come down to us may be mentioned _The\r\nHarrowing of Hell_ (the Saviour's descent into hell), an East-Midland\r\nproduction which professes to tell of \"a strif of Jesu and of Satan\" and\r\nis probably the earliest dramatic, or all but dramatic, work in English\r\nthat has been preserved; and several belonging to a series known as the\r\n_Digby Mysteries_, including _Parfre's Candlemas Day_ (the massacre of\r\nthe Innocents), and the very interesting miracle of _Mary Magdalene_. Of\r\nthe so-called \"Paternoster\" and \"Creed\" plays (which exhibit the\r\nmiraculous powers of portions of the Church service) no example remains,\r\nthough of some we have an account; the Croxton _Play of the Sacrament_,\r\nthe MS. of which is preserved at Dublin, and which seems to date from\r\nthe latter half of the 15th century, exhibits the triumph of the holy\r\nwafer over wicked Jewish wiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  English collective mysteries.\r\n\r\nTo return to the collective mysteries, as they present themselves to us\r\nin the chief extant series. \"The manner of these plays,\" we read in a\r\ndescription of those at Chester, dating from the close of the 16th\r\ncentury, \"were:--Every company had his pageant, which pageants were a\r\nhigh scaffold with two rooms, a higher and a lower, upon four wheels. In\r\nthe lower they apparelled themselves, and in the higher room they\r\nplayed, being all open at the top, that all beholders might hear and see\r\nthem. The places where they played them was in every street. They began\r\nfirst at the abbey gates, and when the first pageant was played, it was\r\nwheeled to the high cross before the mayor, and so to every street, and\r\nso every street had a pageant playing before them at one time till all\r\nthe pageants appointed for the day were played; and when one pageant was\r\nnear ended, word was brought from street to street, that so they might\r\ncome in place thereof, exceedingly orderly, and all the streets have\r\ntheir pageants afore them all at one time playing together; to see which\r\nplays was great resort, and also scaffolds and stages made in the\r\nstreets in those places where they determined to play their pageants.\"\r\n\r\nEach play, then, was performed by the representative of a particular\r\ntrade or company, after whom it was called the fishers', glovers', &c.,\r\n_pageant_; while a general prologue was spoken by a herald. As a rule\r\nthe movable stage sufficed for the action, though we find horsemen\r\nriding up to the scaffold, and Herod instructed to \"rage in the pagond\r\nand in the strete also.\" There is no probability that the stage was, as\r\nin France, divided into three platforms with a dark cavern at the side\r\nof the lowest, appropriated respectively to the Heavenly Father and his\r\nangels, to saints and glorified men, to mere men, and to souls in hell.\r\nBut the last-named locality was frequently displayed in the English\r\nmiracles, with or without fire in its mouth. The costumes were in part\r\nconventional,--divine and saintly personages being distinguished by gilt\r\nhair and beards, Herod being clad as a Saracen, the demons wearing\r\nhideous heads, the souls black and white coats according to their kind,\r\nand the angels gold skins and wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Character of the Plays.\r\n\r\nDoubtless these performances abounded in what seem to us ludicrous\r\nfeatures; and, though their main purpose was serious, they were not in\r\nEngland at least intended to be devoid of fun. But many of the features\r\nin question are in truth only homely and _naïf_, and the simplicity of\r\nfeeling which they exhibit is at times pathetic rather than laughable.\r\nThe occasional grossness is due to an absence of refinement of taste\r\nrather than to an obliquity of moral sentiment. These features the four\r\nseries have more or less in common, still there are certain obvious\r\ndistinctions between them. The _York_ plays (48), which were performed\r\nat Corpus Christi, are comparatively free from the tendency to\r\njocularity and vulgarity observable in the _Towneley_; several of the\r\nplays concerned with the New Testament and early Christian story are,\r\nhowever, in substance common to both series. The _Towneley Plays_ or\r\n_Wakefield Mysteries_ (32) were undoubtedly composed by the friars of\r\nWidkirk or Nostel; but they are of a popular character; and, while\r\nsomewhat over-free in tone, are superior in vivacity and humour to both\r\nthe later collections. The _Chester Plays_ (25) were undoubtedly\r\nindebted both to the _Mystère du vieil testament_ and to earlier French\r\nmysteries; they are less popular in character than the earlier two\r\ncycles, and on the whole undistinguished by original power of pathos or\r\nhumour. There is, on the other hand, a notable inner completeness in\r\nthis series, which includes a play of _Antichrist_, devoid of course of\r\nany modern application. While these plays were performed at Whitsuntide,\r\nthe _Coventry Plays_ (42) were Corpus Christi performances. Though there\r\nis no proof that the extant series were composed by the Grey Friars,\r\nthey reveal a considerable knowledge of ecclesiastical literature. For\r\nthe rest, they are far more effectively written than the _Chester\r\nPlays_, and occasionally rise to real dramatic force. In the _Coventry_\r\nseries there is already to be observed an element of abstract figures,\r\nwhich connects them with a different species of the medieval drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Moralities.\r\n\r\n  The Devil and the Vice.\r\n\r\nThe _moralities_ corresponded to the love for allegory which manifests\r\nitself in so many periods of English literature, and which, while\r\ndominating the whole field of medieval literature, was nowhere more\r\nassiduously and effectively cultivated than in England. It is necessary\r\nto bear this in mind, in order to understand what to us seems so\r\nstrange, the popularity of the moral-plays, which indeed never equalled\r\nthat of the miracles, but sufficed to maintain the former species till\r\nit received a fresh impulse from the connexion established between it\r\nand the \"new learning,\" together with the new political and religious\r\nideas and questions, of the Reformation age. Moreover, a specially\r\npopular element was supplied to these plays, which in manner of\r\nrepresentation differed in no essential point from the miracles, in a\r\ncharacter borrowed from the latter, and, in the moralities, usually\r\nprovided with a companion whose task it was to lighten the weight of\r\nsuch abstractions as Sapience and Justice. These were the Devil and his\r\nattendant the _Vice_, of whom the latter seems to have been of native\r\norigin, and, as he was usually dressed in a fool's habit, was probably\r\nsuggested by the familiar custom of keeping an attendant fool at court\r\nor in great houses. The Vice had many _aliases_ (_Shift_, _Ambidexter_,\r\n_Sin_, _Fraud_, _Iniquity_, &c.), but his usual duty is to torment and\r\ntease the Devil his master for the edification and diversion of the\r\naudience. He was gradually blended with the domestic fool, who survived\r\nin the regular drama. There are other concrete elements in the\r\nmoralities; for typical figures are often fitted with concrete names,\r\nand thus all but converted into concrete human personages.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Groups of English moralities.\r\n\r\nThe earlier English moralities[4]--from the reign of Henry VI. to that\r\nof Henry VII.--usually allegorize the conflict between good and evil in\r\nthe mind and life of man, without any side-intention of theological\r\ncontroversy. Such also is still essentially the purpose of the extant\r\nmorality by Henry VIII.'s poet, the witty Skelton.[5] _Everyman_ (pr. c.\r\n1529), perhaps the most perfect example of its class, with which the\r\npresent generation has fortunately become familiar, contains passages\r\ncertainly designed to enforce the specific teaching of Rome. But its\r\nDutch original was written at least a generation earlier, and could have\r\nno controversial intention. On the other hand, R. Wever's _Lusty\r\nJuventus_ breathes the spirit of the dogmatic reformation of the reign\r\nof Edward VI. Theological controversy largely occupies the moralities of\r\nthe earlier part of Elizabeth's reign,[6] and connects itself with\r\npolitical feeling in a famous morality, Sir David Lyndsay's _Satire of\r\nthe Three Estaitis_, written and acted (at Cupar, in 1539) on the other\r\nside of the border, where such efforts as the religious drama proper had\r\nmade had been extinguished by the Reformation. Only a single English\r\npolitical morality proper remains to us, which belongs to the beginning\r\nof the reign of Elizabeth.[7] Another series connects itself with the\r\nideas of the Renaissance rather than the Reformation, treating of\r\nintellectual progress rather than of moral conduct;[8] this extends from\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII. to that of his younger daughter. Besides these,\r\nthere remain some Elizabethan moralities which have no special\r\ntheological or scientific purpose, and which are none the less lively in\r\nconsequence.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transition from the morality to the regular drama.\r\n\r\n  Heywood's interludes.\r\n\r\nThe transition from the morality to the regular drama in England was\r\neffected, on the one hand, by the intermixture of historical personages\r\nwith abstractions--as in Bishop Bale's _Kyng Johan_ (c. 1548)--which\r\neasily led over to the _chronicle history_; on the other, by the\r\nintroduction of types of real life by the side of abstract figures. This\r\nlatter tendency, of which instances occur in earlier plays, is\r\nobservable in several of the 16th-century moralities;[10] but before\r\nmost of these were written, a further step in advance had been taken by\r\na man of genius, John Heywood (b. c. 1500, d. between 1577 and 1587),\r\nwhose \"interludes\"[11] were short farces in the French manner. The term\r\n\"interludes\" was by no means new, but had been applied by friend and foe\r\nto religious plays, and plays (including moralities) in general, already\r\nin the 14th century. But it conveniently serves to designate a species\r\nwhich marks a distinct stage in the history of the modern drama.\r\nHeywood's interludes dealt entirely with real--very real--men and women.\r\nOrthodox and conservative, he had at the same time a keen eye for the\r\nvices as well as the follies of his age, and not the least for those of\r\nthe clerical profession. Other writers, such as T. Ingeland,[12] took\r\nthe same direction; and the allegory of abstractions was thus undermined\r\non the stage, very much as in didactic literature the ground had been\r\ncut from under its feet by the _Ship of Fooles_. Thus the interludes\r\nfacilitated the advent of comedy, without having superseded the earlier\r\nform. Both moralities and miracle-plays survived into the Elizabethan\r\nage after the regular drama had already begun its course.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pageants.\r\n\r\nSuch, in barest outline, was the progress of dramatic entertainments in\r\nthe principal countries of Europe, before the revival of classical\r\nstudies brought about a return to the examples of the classical drama,\r\nor before this return had distinctly asserted itself. It must not,\r\nhowever, be forgotten that from an early period in England as elsewhere\r\nhad flourished a species of entertainments, not properly speaking\r\ndramatic, but largely contributing to form and foster a taste for\r\ndramatic spectacles. The _pageants_--as they were called in\r\nEngland--were the successors of those _ridings_ from which, when they\r\ngladdened \"Chepe,\" Chaucer's idle apprentice would not keep away; but\r\nthey had advanced in splendour and ingenuity of device under the\r\ninfluence of Flemish and other foreign examples. Costumed figures\r\nrepresented before gaping citizens the heroes of mythology and history,\r\nand the abstractions of moral, patriotic, or municipal allegory; and the\r\ncity of London clung with special fervour to these exhibitions, which\r\nthe Elizabethan drama was neither able nor--as represented by most of\r\nits poets who composed devices and short texts for these and similar\r\nshows--willing to oust from popular favour. Some of the greatest and\r\nsome of the least of English dramatists were the ministers of pageantry;\r\nand perhaps it would have been an advantage for the future of the\r\ntheatre if the legitimate drama and the _Triumphs of Old Drapery_ had\r\nbeen more jealously kept apart. With the reign of Henry VIII. there also\r\nset in a varied succession of entertainments at court and in the houses\r\nof the great nobles, which may be said to have lasted through the Tudor\r\nand early Stuart periods; but it would be an endless task to attempt to\r\ndiscriminate the dramatic elements contained in these productions. The\r\n\"mask,\" stated to have been introduced from Italy into England as a new\r\ndiversion in 1512-1513, at first merely added a fresh element of\r\n\"disguising\" to those already in use; as a quasi-dramatic species\r\n(\"mask\" or \"masque\") capable of a great literary development it hardly\r\nasserted itself till quite the end of the 16th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE MODERN NATIONAL DRAMA\r\n\r\n  Influence of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe literary influence which finally transformed the growths noticed\r\nabove into the national dramas of the several countries of Europe, was\r\nthat of the Renaissance. Among the remains of classical antiquity which\r\nwere studied, translated and imitated, those of the drama necessarily\r\nheld a prominent place. Never altogether lost sight of, they now became\r\nsubjects of devoted research and models for more or less exact\r\nimitation, first in Greek or Latin, then in modern tongues; and these\r\nessentially literary endeavours came into more or less direct contact\r\nwith, and acquired more or less control over, dramatic performances and\r\nentertainments already in existence. This process it will be most\r\nconvenient to pursue _seriatim_, in connexion with the rise and progress\r\nof the several dramatic literatures of the West. For no sooner had the\r\nstream of the modern drama, whose source and contributories have been\r\ndescribed, been brought back into the ancient bed, than its flow\r\ndiverged into a number of national currents, unequal in impetus and\r\nstrength, and varying in accordance with their manifold surroundings.\r\nAnd even of these it is only possible to survey the most productive or\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _Italy._\r\n\r\n  The modern Italian drama.\r\n\r\nThe priority in this as in most of the other aspects of the Renaissance\r\nbelongs to Italy. In ultimate achievement the Italian drama fell short\r\nof the fulness of the results obtained elsewhere--a surprising fact when\r\nit is considered, not only that the Italian language had the\r\nvantage-ground of closest relationship to the Latin, but that the genius\r\nof the Italian people has at all times led it to love the drama. The\r\ncause is doubtless to be sought in the lack, noticeable in Italian\r\nnational life during a long period, and more especially during the\r\ntroubled days of division and strife coinciding with the rise and\r\nearlier promise of Italian dramatic literature, of those loftiest and\r\nmost potent impulses of popular feeling to which a national drama owes\r\nso much of its strength. This deficiency was due partly to the\r\npeculiarities of the Italian character, partly to the political and\r\necclesiastical experiences which Italy was fated to undergo. The\r\nItalians were alike strangers to the enthusiasm of patriotism, which was\r\nas the breath in the nostrils of the English Elizabethan age, and to the\r\nreligious devotion which identified Spain with the spirit of the\r\nCatholic revival. The clear-sightedness of the Italians had something to\r\ndo with this, for they were too intelligent to believe in their tyrants,\r\nand too free from illusions to deliver up their minds to their priests.\r\nFinally, the chilling and enervating effects of a pressure of foreign\r\ndomination, such as no Western people with a history and a civilization\r\nlike those of Italy has ever experienced, contributed to paralyse for\r\nmany generations the higher efforts of the dramatic art. No basis was\r\npermanently found for a really national tragedy; while literary comedy,\r\nafter turning from the direct imitation of Latin models to a more\r\npopular form, lost itself in an abandoned immorality of tone and in\r\nreckless insolence of invective against particular classes of society.\r\nThough its productivity long continued, the poetic drama more and more\r\nconcentrated its efforts upon subordinate or subsidiary species,\r\nartificial in origin and decorative in purpose, and surrendered its\r\nsubstance to the overpowering aids of music, dancing and spectacle. Only\r\na single form of the Italian drama, improvised comedy, remained truly\r\nnational; and this was of its nature dissociated from higher literary\r\neffort. The revival of Italian tragedy in later times is due partly to\r\nthe imitation of French models, partly to the endeavour of a brilliant\r\ngenius to infuse into his art the historical and political spirit.\r\nComedy likewise attained to new growths of considerable significance,\r\nwhen it was sought to accommodate its popular forms to the\r\nrepresentation of real life in a wider range, and again to render it\r\nmore poetical in accordance with the tendencies of modern romanticism.\r\n\r\nThe regular Italian drama, in both its tragic and its comic branches,\r\nbegan with a reproduction, in the Latin language, of classical\r\nmodels--the first step, as it was to prove, towards the transformation\r\nof the medieval into the modern drama, and the birth of modern dramatic\r\nliterature. But the process was both tentative and tedious, and must\r\nhave died away but for the pomp and circumstance with which some of the\r\npatrons of the Renaissance at Florence, Rome and elsewhere surrounded\r\nthese manifestations of a fashionable taste, and for the patriotic\r\ninspiration which from the first induced Italian writers to dramatize\r\nthemes of national historic interest. Greek tragedy had been long\r\nforgotten, and one or two indications in the earlier part of the 16th\r\ncentury of Italian interest in the Greek drama, chiefly due to the\r\nprinting presses, may be passed by.[13] To the later middle ages\r\nclassical tragedy meant Seneca, and even his plays remained unremembered\r\ntill the study of them was revived by the Paduan judge Lovato de' Lovati\r\n(Lupatus, d. 1309). Of the comedies of Plautus three-fifths were not\r\nrediscovered till 1429; and though Terence was much read in the schools,\r\nhe found no dramatic imitators, _pour le bon motif_ or otherwise, since\r\nHrosvitha.\r\n\r\nThus the first medieval follower of Seneca, Albertino Mussato\r\n(1261-1330) may in a sense be called the father of modern dramatic\r\nliterature. Born at Padua, to which city all his services were given, he\r\nin 1315 brought out his _Eccerinis_, a Latin tragedy very near to the\r\nconfines of epic poetry, intended to warn the Paduans against the\r\ndesigns of Can Grande della Scala by the example of the tyrant Ezzelino.\r\nOther tragedies of much the same type followed during the ensuing\r\ncentury; such as L. da Fabiano's _De casu Caesenae_ (1377) a sort of\r\nchronicle history in Latin prose on Cardinal Albornoz' capture of\r\nCaesena.[14] Purely classical themes were treated in the _Achilleis_ of\r\nA. de' Loschi of Vicenza (d. 1441), formerly attributed to Mussato,\r\nseveral passages of which are taken verbally from Seneca; in the\r\ncelebrated _Progne_ of the Venetian Gregorio Cornaro, which is dated\r\n1428-1429, and in later Latin productions included among the\r\ntranslations and imitations of Greek and Latin tragedies and comedies by\r\nBishop Martirano (d. 1557), the friend of Pope Leo X.,[15] and the\r\nefforts of Pomponius Laetus and his followers, who, with the aid of\r\nCardinal Raffaele Riario (1451-1521), sought to revive the ancient\r\ntheatre, with all its classical associations, at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn this general movement Latin comedy had quickly followed suit, and, as\r\njust indicated, it is almost impossible, when we reach the height of the\r\nItalian Renaissance under the Medici at Florence and at Rome in\r\nparticular, to review the progress of either species apart from that of\r\nthe other. If we possessed the lost _Philologia_ of Petrarch, of which,\r\nas of a juvenile work, he declared himself ashamed, this would be the\r\nearliest of extant humanistic comedies. As it is, this position is held\r\nby _Paulus_, a Latin comedy of life on the classic model, by the\r\northodox P. P. Vergerio (1370-1444); which was followed by many\r\nothers.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italian tragedy in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 16th century, tragedy began to be written in the native\r\ntongue; but it retained from the first, and never wholly lost, the\r\nimpress of its origin. Whatever the source of its subjects--which,\r\nthough mostly of classical origin, were occasionally derived from native\r\nromance, or even due to invention--they were all treated with a\r\npredilection for the horrible, inspired by the example of Seneca, though\r\nno doubt encouraged by a perennial national taste. The chorus,\r\nstationary on the stage as in old Roman tragedy, was not reduced to a\r\nmerely occasional appearance between the acts till the beginning of the\r\n17th century, or ousted altogether from the tragic drama till the\r\nearlier half of the 18th. Thus the changes undergone by Italian tragedy\r\nwere for a long series of generations chiefly confined to the form of\r\nversification and the choice of themes; nor was it, at all events till\r\nthe last century of the course which it has hitherto run, more than the\r\naftergrowth of an aftergrowth. The honour of having been the earliest\r\ntragedy in Italian seems to belong to A. da Pistoia's _Pamfila_ (1499),\r\nof which the subject was taken from Boccaccio, introduced by the ghost\r\nof Seneca, and marred in the taking. Carretto's _Sofonisba_, which\r\nhardly rises above the art of a chronicle history, though provided with\r\na chorus, followed in 1502. But the play usually associated with the\r\nbeginning of Italian tragedy--that with which \"th' Italian scene first\r\nlearned to glow\"--was another _Sofonisba_, acted before Leo X. in 1515,\r\nand written in blank hendecasyllables instead of the _ottava_ and _terza\r\nrima_ of the earlier tragedians (retaining, however, the lyric measures\r\nof the chorus), by G. G. Trissino, who was employed as nuncio by that\r\npope. Other tragedies of the former half of the 16th century, largely\r\ninspired by Trissino's example, were the _Rosmunda_ of Rucellai, a\r\nnephew of Lorenzo the Magnificent (1516); Martelli's _Tullia_,\r\nAlamanni's _Antigone_ (1532); the _Canace_ of Sperone Speroni, the\r\nenvious _Mopsus_ of Tasso, who, like Guarini, took Sperone's elaborate\r\nstyle for his model; the _Orazia_, the earliest dramatic treatment of\r\nthis famous subject by the notorious Aretino (1549); and the nine\r\ntragedies of G. B. Giraldi (Cinthio) of Ferrara, among which\r\n_L'Orbecche_ (1541) is accounted the best and the bloodiest. Cinthio,\r\nthe author of those _Hecatommithi_ to which Shakespeare was indebted for\r\nso many of his subjects, was (supposing him to have invented these) the\r\nfirst Italian who was the author of the fables of his own dramas; he\r\nintroduced some novelties into dramatic construction, separating the\r\nprologue and probably also the epilogue from the action, and has by some\r\nbeen regarded as the inventor of the pastoral drama. But his style was\r\narid. In the latter half of the 16th century may be mentioned the\r\n_Didone_ and the _Marianna_ of L. Dolce, the translator of Euripides and\r\nSeneca (1565); A. Leonico's _Il Soldato_ (1550); the _Adriana_ (acted\r\nbefore 1561 or 1586) of L. Groto, which treats the story of _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_; Tasso's _Torrismondo_ (1587); the _Tancredi_ of Asinari (1588);\r\nand the _Merope_ of Torelli (1593), the last who employed the stationary\r\nchorus (_coro fisso_) on the Italian stage. Leonico's _Soldato_ is\r\nnoticeable as supposed to have given rise to the _tragedia cittadina_,\r\nor domestic tragedy, of which there are few examples in the Italian\r\ndrama, and De Velo's _Tamar_ (1586) as written in prose. Subjects of\r\nmodern historical interest were in this period treated only in isolated\r\ninstances.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italian tragedy in the 17th and 18th centuries.\r\n\r\n  Maffei.\r\n\r\n  Metastasio.\r\n\r\n  Alfieri.\r\n\r\nThe tragedians of the 17th century continued to pursue the beaten track,\r\nmarked out already in the 16th by rigid prescription. In course of time,\r\nhowever, they sought by the introduction of musical airs to compromise\r\nwith the danger with which their art was threatened of being (in\r\nVoltaire's phrase) extinguished by the beautiful monster, the opera, now\r\nrapidly gaining ground in the country of its origin. (See OPERA.) To\r\nCount P. Bonarelli (1589-1659), the author of _Solimano_, is on the\r\nother hand ascribed the first disuse of the chorus in Italian tragedy.\r\nThe innovation of the use of rhyme attempted in the learned\r\nPallavicino's _Erminigildo_ (1655), and defended by him in a discourse\r\nprefixed to the play, was unable to achieve a permanent success in Italy\r\nany more than in England; its chief representative was afterwards\r\nMartelli (d. 1727), whose rhymed Alexandrian verse (_Martelliano_),\r\nthough on one occasion used in comedy by Goldoni, failed to commend\r\nitself to the popular taste. By the end of the 17th century Italian\r\ntragedy seemed destined to expire, and the great tragic actor Cotta had\r\nwithdrawn in disgust at the apathy of the public towards the higher\r\nforms of the drama. The 18th century was, however, to witness a change,\r\nthe beginnings of which are attributed to the institution of the Academy\r\nof the Arcadians at Rome (1690). The principal efforts of the new school\r\nof writers and critics were directed to the abolition of the chorus, and\r\nto a general increase of freedom in treatment. Before long the marquis\r\nS. Maffei with his _Merope_ (first printed 1713) achieved one of the\r\nmost brilliant successes recorded in the history of dramatic literature.\r\nThis play, which is devoid of any love-story, long continued to be\r\nconsidered the masterpiece of Italian tragedy; Voltaire, who declared it\r\n\"worthy of the most glorious days of Athens,\" adapted it for the French\r\nstage, and it inspired a celebrated production of the English drama.[18]\r\nIt was followed by a tragedy full of horrors,[19] noticeable as having\r\ngiven rise to the first Italian dramatic _parody_; and by the highly\r\nesteemed productions of Granelli (d. 1769) and his contemporary\r\nBettinelli. P. T. Metastasio (1698-1782), who had early begun his career\r\nas a dramatist by a strict adherence to the precepts of Aristotle,\r\ngained celebrity by his contributions to the operatic drama at Naples,\r\nVenice and Vienna (where he held office as _poeta cesareo_, whose\r\nfunction was to arrange the court entertainments). But his _libretti_\r\nhave a poetic value of their own;[20] and Voltaire pronounced much of\r\nhim worthy of Corneille and of Racine, when at their best. The influence\r\nof Voltaire had now come to predominate over the Italian drama; and, in\r\naccordance with the spirit of the times, greater freedom prevailed in\r\nthe choice of tragic themes. Thus the greatest of Italian tragic poets.\r\nCount V. Alfieri (1749-1803), found his path prepared for him. Alfieri's\r\ngrand and impassioned treatment of his subjects caused his faultiness of\r\nform, which he never altogether overcame, to be forgotten. His themes\r\nwere partly classical;[21] but the spirit of a love of freedom which his\r\ncreations[22] breathe was the herald of the national ideas of the\r\nfuture. Spurning the usages of French tragedy, his plays, which abound\r\nin soliloquies, owe part of their effect to an impassioned force of\r\ndeclamation, part to those \"points\" by which Italian acting seems\r\npre-eminently capable of thrilling an audience. He has much besides the\r\nsubjects of two of his dramas[23] in common with Schiller, but his\r\namazon-muse (as Schlegel called her) was not schooled into serenity,\r\nlike the muse of the German poet. Among his numerous plays (21),\r\n_Merope_ and _Saul_, and perhaps _Mirra_, are accounted his\r\nmasterpieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tragedians since Alfieri.\r\n\r\nThe political colouring given by Alfieri to Italian tragedy reappears in\r\nthe plays of U. Foscolo and A. Manzoni, both of whom are under the\r\ninfluence of the romantic school of modern literature; and to these\r\nnames must be added those of S. Pellico and G. B. Niccolini (1785-1861),\r\nPaolo Giacometti (b. 1816) and others, whose dramas[24] treat largely\r\nnational themes familiar to all students of modern history and\r\nliterature. In their hands Italian tragedy upon the whole adhered to its\r\nlove of strong situations and passionate declamation. Since the\r\nsuccessful efforts of G. Modena (1804-1861) renovated the tragic stage\r\nin Italy, the art of tragic acting long stood at a higher level in this\r\nthan in almost any other European country; in Adelaide Ristori (Marchesa\r\ndel Grillo) the tragic stage lost one of the greatest of modern\r\nactresses; and Ernesto Rossi (1827-1896) and Tommaso Salvini long\r\nremained rivals in the noblest forms of tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italian comedy; popular forms.\r\n\r\n  Commedia dell' arte.\r\n\r\n  Masked comedy.\r\n\r\nIn comedy, the efforts of the scholars of the Italian Renaissance for a\r\ntime went side by side with the progress of the popular entertainments\r\nnoticed above. While the _contrasti_ of the close of the 15th and of the\r\n16th century were disputations between pairs of abstract or allegorical\r\nfigures, in the _frottola_ human types take the place of abstractions,\r\nand more than two characters appear. The _farsa_ (a name used of a wide\r\nvariety of entertainments) was still under medieval influences, and in\r\nthis popular form Alione of Asti (soon after 1500) was specially\r\nproductive. To these popular diversions a new literary as well as social\r\nsignificance was given by the Neapolitan court-poet Sannazaro (c. 1492);\r\nabout the same time a _capitano valoroso_, Venturino of Pesara, first\r\nbrought on the modern stage the _capitano glorioso_ or _spavente_, the\r\nmilitary braggart, who owed his origin both to Plautus[25] and to the\r\nSpanish officers who abounded in the Italy of those days. The popular\r\ncharacter-comedy, a relic of the ancient _Atellanae_, likewise took a\r\nnew lease of life--and this in a double form. The _improvised_ comedy\r\n(_commedia a soggetto_) was now as a rule performed by professional\r\nactors, members of a _craft_, and was thence called the _commedia dell'\r\narte_, which is said to have been invented by Francesco (called\r\nTerenziano) Cherea, the favourite player of Leo X. Its scenes, still\r\nunwritten except in skeleton (_scenario_), were connected together by\r\nthe ligatures or links (_lazzi_) of the _arlecchino_, the descendant of\r\nthe ancient Roman _sannio_ (whence our _zany_). Harlequin's summit of\r\nglory was probably reached early in the 17th century, when he was\r\nennobled in the person of Cecchino by the emperor Matthias; of\r\nCecchino's successors, Zaccagnino and Truffaldino, we read that \"they\r\nshut the door in Italy to good harlequins.\" Distinct from this growth is\r\nthat of the _masked_ comedy, the action of which was chiefly carried on\r\nby certain typical figures in masks, speaking in local dialects,[26]\r\nbut which was not improvised, and indeed from the nature of the case\r\nhardly could have been. Its inventor was A. Beolco of Padua, who called\r\nhimself Ruzzante (joker), and is memorable under that name as the first\r\nactor-playwright--a combination of extreme significance for the history\r\nof the modern stage. He published six comedies in various dialects,\r\nincluding the Greek of the day (1530). This was the masked comedy to\r\nwhich the Italians so tenaciously clung, and in which, as all their own\r\nand imitable by no other nation, they took so great a pride that even\r\nGoldoni was unable to overthrow it. Improvisation and burlesque, alike\r\nabominable to comedy proper, were inseparable from the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early Italian regular comedy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Latin imitations of Roman, varied by occasional\r\ntranslations of Greek, comedies early led to the production of Italian\r\ntranslations, several of which were performed at Ferrara in the last\r\nquarter of the 15th century, whence they spread to Milan, Pavia and\r\nother towns of the north. Contemporaneously, imitations of Latin comedy\r\nmade their appearance, for the most part in rhymed verse; most of them\r\napplying classical treatment to subjects derived from Boccaccio's and\r\nother _novelle_, some still mere adaptations of ancient models. In these\r\ncircumstances it is all but idle to assign the honour of having been\r\n\"the first Italian comedy\"--and thus the first comedy in modern dramatic\r\nliterature--to any particular play. Boiardo's _Timone_ (before 1494),\r\nfor which this distinction was frequently claimed, is to a large extent\r\nfounded on a dialogue of Lucian's; and, since some of its personages are\r\nabstractions, and Olympus is domesticated on an upper stage, it cannot\r\nbe regarded as more than a transition from the moralities. A. Ricci's _I\r\nTre Tiranni_ (before 1530) seems still to belong to the same\r\ntransitional species. Among the earlier imitators of Latin comedy in the\r\nvernacular may be noted G. Visconti, one of the poets patronized by\r\nLudovico il Moro at Milan;[27] the Florentines G. B. Araldo, J. Nardi,\r\nthe historian,[28] and D. Gianotti.[29] The step--very important had it\r\nbeen adopted consistently or with a view to consistency--of substituting\r\nprose for verse as the diction of comedy, is sometimes attributed to\r\nAriosto; but, though his first two comedies were originally written in\r\nprose, the experiment was not new, nor did he persist in its adoption.\r\nCaretto's _I Sei Contenti_ dates from the end of the 15th century, and\r\nPublio Filippo's _Formicone_, taken from Apuleius, followed quite early\r\nin the 16th. Machiavelli, as will be seen, wrote comedies both in prose\r\nand in verse.\r\n\r\nBut, whoever wrote the first Italian comedy, Ludovico Ariosto was the\r\nfirst master of the species. All but the first two of his comedies,\r\nbelonging as they do to the field of _commedia erudita_, or scholarly\r\ncomedy, are in blank verse, to which he gave a singular mobility by the\r\ndactylic ending of the line (_sdrucciolo_). Ariosto's models were the\r\nmasterpieces of the _palliata_, and his morals those of his age, which\r\nemulated those of the worst days of ancient Rome or Byzantium in\r\nlooseness, and surpassed them in effrontery. He chose his subjects\r\naccordingly; but his dramatic genius displayed itself in the effective\r\ndrawing of character,[30] and more especially in the skilful management\r\nof complicated intrigues.[31] Such, with an additional brilliancy of wit\r\nand lasciviousness of tone, are likewise the characteristics of\r\nMachiavelli's famous prose comedy, the _Mandragola_ (_The Magic\r\nDraught_);[32] and at the height of their success, of the plays of P.\r\nAretino,[33] especially the prose _Marescalco_ (1526-1527) whose name,\r\nit has been said, ought to be written in asterisks. It may be added that\r\nthe plays of Ariosto and his followers were represented with magnificent\r\nscenery and settings. Other dramatists of the 16th century were B.\r\nAccolti, whose _Virginia_ (prob. before 1513) treats the story from\r\nBoccaccio which reappears in _All's Well that Ends Well_; G. Cecchi, F.\r\nd'Ambra, A. F. Grazzini, N. Secco or Secchi and L. Dolce--all writers of\r\nromantic comedy of intrigue in verse or prose.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The pastoral drama.\r\n\r\nDuring the same century the \"pastoral drama\" flourished in Italy. The\r\norigin of this peculiar species--which was the bucolic idyll in a\r\ndramatic form, and which freely lent itself to the introduction of both\r\nmythological and allegorical elements--was purely literary, and arose\r\ndirectly out of the classical studies and tastes of the Renaissance. It\r\nwas very far removed from the genuine peasant plays which flourished in\r\nVenetia and Tuscany early in the 16th century. The earliest example of\r\nthe artificial, but in some of its productions exquisite, growth in\r\nquestion was the renowned scholar A. Politian's _Orfeo_ (1472), which\r\nbegins like an idyll and ends like a tragedy. Intended to be performed\r\nwith music--for the pastoral drama is the parent of the opera--this\r\nbeautiful work tells its story simply. N. da Correggio's (1450-1508)\r\n_Cefalo_, or _Aurora_, and others followed, before in 1554 A. Beccari\r\nproduced, as totally new of its kind, his Arcadian pastoral drama _Il\r\nSagrifizio_, in which the comic element predominates. But an epoch in\r\nthe history of the species is marked by the _Aminta_ of Tasso (1573), in\r\nwhose Arcadia is allegorically mirrored the Ferrara court. Adorned by\r\nchoral lyrics of great beauty, it presents an allegorical treatment of a\r\nsocial and moral problem; and since the conception of the characters,\r\nall of whom think and speak of nothing but love, is artificial, the\r\ncharm of the poem lies not in the interest of its action, but in the\r\npassion and sweetness of its sentiment. This work was the model of many\r\nothers, and the pastoral drama reached its height of popularity in the\r\nfamous _Pastor fido_ (written before 1590) of G. B. Guarini, which,\r\nwhile founded on a tragic love-story, introduces into its complicated\r\nplot a comic element, partly with a satirical intention. It is one of\r\nthose exceptional works which, by circumstance as well as by merit, have\r\nbecome the property of the world's literature at large. Thus, both in\r\nItalian and in other literatures, the pastoral drama became a distinct\r\nspecies, characterized, like the great body of modern pastoral poetry in\r\ngeneral, by a tendency either towards the artificial or towards the\r\nburlesque. Its artificiality affected the entire growth of Italian\r\ncomedy, including the _commedia dell' arte_, and impressed itself in an\r\nintensified form upon the opera. The foremost Italian masters of the\r\nlast-named species, so far as it can claim to be included in the poetic\r\ndrama, were A. Zeno (1668-1750) and P. Metastasio.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedy in the 17th and 18th centuries.\r\n\r\n  Goldoni.\r\n\r\n  Gozzi.\r\n\r\nThe comic dramatists of the 17th century are grouped as followers of the\r\nclassical and of the romantic school, G. B. della Porta (q.v.) and G. A.\r\nCicognini (whom Goldoni describes as full of whining pathos and\r\ncommonplace drollery, but as still possessing a great power to interest)\r\nbeing regarded as the leading representatives of the former. But neither\r\nof these largely intermixed groups of writers could, with all its\r\nfertility, prevail against the competition, on the one hand of the\r\nmusical drama, and on the other of the popular farcical entertainments\r\nand those introduced in imitation of Spanish examples. Italian comedy\r\nhad fallen into decay, when its reform was undertaken by the wonderful\r\ntheatrical genius of C. Goldoni. One of the most fertile and rapid of\r\nplaywrights (of his 150 comedies 16 were written and acted in a single\r\nyear), he at the same time pursued definite aims as a dramatist.\r\nDisgusted with the conventional buffoonery, and ashamed of the rampant\r\nimmorality of the Italian comic stage, he drew his characters from real\r\nlife, whether of his native city (Venice)[34] or of society at large,\r\nand sought to enforce virtuous and pathetic sentiments without\r\nneglecting the essential objects of his art. Happy and various in his\r\nchoice of themes, and dipping deep into a popular life with which he had\r\na genuine sympathy, he produced, besides comedies of general human\r\ncharacter,[35] plays on subjects drawn from literary biography[36] or\r\nfrom fiction.[37] Goldoni, whose style was considered defective by the\r\npurists whom Italy has at no time lacked, met with a severe critic and a\r\ntemporarily successful rival in Count C. Gozzi (1722-1806), who sought\r\nto rescue the comic drama from its association with the actual life of\r\nthe middle classes, and to infuse a new spirit into the figures of the\r\nold masked comedy by the invention of a new species. His themes were\r\ntaken from Neapolitan[38] and Oriental[39] fairy tales, to which he\r\naccommodated some of the standing figures upon which Goldoni had made\r\nwar. This attempt at mingling fancy and humour--occasionally of a\r\ndirectly satirical turn[40]--was in harmony with the tendencies of the\r\nmodern romantic school; and Gozzi's efforts, which though successful\r\nfound hardly any imitators in Italy, have a family resemblance to those\r\nof Tieck and of some more recent writers whose art wings its flight,\r\nthrough the windows, \"over the hills and far away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedians after Goldoni.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the 18th and the early years of the 19th\r\ncentury comedy continued to follow the course marked out by its\r\nacknowledged master Goldoni, under the influence of the sentimental\r\ndrama of France and other countries. Abati Andrea Villi, the marquis\r\nAlbergati Capacelli, Antonio Simone Sografi (1760-1825), Federici, and\r\nPietro Napoli Signorelli (1731-1815), the historian of the drama, are\r\nmentioned among the writers of this school; to the 19th century belong\r\nCount Giraud, Marchisio (who took his subjects especially from\r\ncommercial life), and Nota, a fertile writer, among whose plays are\r\nthree treating the lives of poets. Of still more recent date are L. B.\r\nBon and A. Brofferio. At the same time, the comedy of dialect to which\r\nthe example of Goldoni had given sanction in Venice, flourished there as\r\nwell as in the mutually remote spheres of Piedmont and Naples. Quite\r\nmodern developments must remain unnoticed here; but the fact cannot be\r\nignored that they signally illustrate the perennial vitality of the\r\nmodern drama in the home of its beginnings. A new realistic style set\r\nfully in about the middle of the 18th century with P. Ferrari and A.\r\nTorelli; and though an historical reaction towards classical and\r\nmedieval themes is associated with the names of P. Cossa and G. Giacosa,\r\nmodernism reasserted itself through P. Bracco and other dramatists. It\r\nshould be noted that the influence of great actors, more especially\r\nErmete Novelli and Eleanora Duse, must be credited with a large share of\r\nthe success with which the Italian stage has held its own even against\r\nthe foreign influences to which it gave room. And it would seem as if\r\neven the paradoxical endeavour of the poet Gabrielle d' Annunzio to\r\nlyricize the drama by ignoring action as its essence were a problem for\r\nthe solution of which the stage can furnish unexpected conditions of its\r\nown. In any event, both Italian tragedy and Italian comedy have survived\r\nperiods of a seemingly hopeless decline; and the fear has vanished that\r\neither the opera or the ballet might succeed in ousting from the\r\nnational stage the legitimate forms of the national drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _Greece._\r\n\r\n  Modern Greek and Dalmatian drama.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic literature of the later Hellenes is a creation of the\r\nliterary movement which preceded their noble struggle for independence,\r\nor which may be said to form part of that struggle. After beginning with\r\ndramatic dialogues of a patriotic tendency, it took a step in advance\r\nwith the tragedies of J. R. Nerulos[41] (1778-1850), whose name belongs\r\nto the political as well as to the literary history of his country. His\r\ncomedies--especially one directed against the excesses of\r\njournalism[42]--largely contributed to open a literary life for the\r\nmodern Greek tongue. Among the earlier patriotic Greek dramatists of the\r\n19th century are T. Alkaeos, J. Zampelios (whose tragic style was\r\ninfluenced by that of Alfieri),[43] S. K. Karydis and A. Valaoritis. A.\r\nZoiros[44] is noteworthy as having introduced the use of prose into\r\nGreek tragedy, while preserving to it that association with sentiments\r\nand aspirations which will probably long continue to pervade the chief\r\nproductions of modern Greek literature. The love of the theatre is\r\nineradicable from Attic as it is from Italian soil; and the tendencies\r\nof the young dramatic literature of Hellas which is not wholly absorbed\r\nin the effort to keep abreast of recent modern developments, seem to\r\njustify the hope that a worthy future awaits it.\r\n\r\nUnder Italian influence an interesting dramatic growth attained to some\r\nvitality in the Dalmatian lands about the beginning of the 16th century,\r\nwhere the religious drama, whose days were passing away in Italy, found\r\nfavour with a people with a scant popular literature of its own. At\r\nRagusa Italian literary influence had been spread by the followers of\r\nPetrarch from the later years of the 15th century; here several\r\nServo-Croatian writers produced religious plays in the manner of the\r\nItalian _rappresentazioni_; and a gifted poet, Martin Drzic, composed,\r\nbesides religious plays and farces, a species of pastoral which enjoyed\r\nmuch favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) _Spain._\r\n\r\nSpain is the only country of modern Europe which shares with England the\r\nhonour of having achieved, at a relatively early date, the creation of a\r\ngenuinely national form of the regular drama. So proper to Spain was the\r\nform of the drama which she produced and perfected, that to it the term\r\n_romantic_ has been specifically applied, though so restricted a use of\r\nthe epithet is clearly unjustifiable. The influences which from the\r\nRomance peoples--in whom Christian and Germanic elements mingled with\r\nthe legacy of Roman law, learning and culture--spread to the Germanic\r\nnations were represented with the most signal force and fulness in the\r\ninstitutions of chivalry,--to which, in the words of Scott, \"it was\r\npeculiar to blend military valour with the strongest passions which\r\nactuate the human mind, the feelings of devotion and those of love.\"\r\nThese feelings, in their combined operation upon the national character,\r\nand in their reflection in the national literature, were not confined to\r\nSpain; but nowhere did they so long or so late continue to animate the\r\nmoral life of a nation.\r\n\r\nOutward causes contributed to this result. For centuries after the\r\ncrusades had become a mere memory, Spain was a battle-ground between the\r\nCross and the Crescent. And it was just at the time when the Renaissance\r\nwas establishing new starting-points for the literary progress of\r\nEurope, that Christian Spain rose to the height of Catholic as well as\r\nnational self-consciousness by the expulsion of the Moors and the\r\nconquest of the New World. From their rulers or rivals of so many\r\ncenturies the Spaniards derived that rich, if not very varied, glow of\r\ncolour which became permanently distinctive of their national life, and\r\nmore especially of its literary and artistic expressions; they also\r\nperhaps derived from the same source a not less characteristically\r\nrefined treatment of the passion of love. The ideas of Spanish\r\nchivalry--more especially religious devotion and a punctilious sense of\r\npersonal honour--asserted themselves (according to a process often\r\nobservable in the history of civilization) with peculiar distinctness in\r\nliterature and art, after the period of great achievements to which they\r\nhad contributed in other fields had come to an end. The ripest glories\r\nof the Spanish drama belong to an age of national decay--mindful, it is\r\ntrue, of the ideas of a greater past. The chivalrous enthusiasm\r\npervading so many of the masterpieces of its literature is indeed a\r\ndistinctive feature of the Spanish nation in all, even in the least\r\nhopeful, periods of its later history; and the religious ardour breathed\r\nby these works, though associating itself with what is called the\r\nCatholic Reaction, is in truth only a manifestation of the spirit which\r\ninformed the noblest part of the Reformation movement itself. The\r\nSpanish drama neither sought nor could seek to emancipate itself from\r\nviews and forms of religious life more than ever sacred to the Spanish\r\npeople since the glorious days of Ferdinand and Isabella; and it is not\r\nso much in the beginnings as in the great age of Spanish dramatic\r\nliterature that it seems most difficult to distinguish between what is\r\nto be termed a religious and what a secular play. After Spain had thus,\r\nthe first after England among modern European countries, fully unfolded\r\nthat incomparably richest expression of national life and sentiment in\r\nan artistic form--a truly national dramatic literature,--the terrible\r\ndecay of her greatness and prosperity gradually impaired the strength of\r\na brilliant but, of its nature, dependent growth. In the absence of high\r\noriginal genius the Spanish dramatists began to turn to foreign models,\r\nthough little supported in such attempts by popular sympathy; and it is\r\nonly in more recent times that the Spanish drama has sought to reproduce\r\nthe ancient forms from whose masterpieces the nation had never become\r\nestranged, while accommodating them to tastes and tendencies shared by\r\nlater Spanish literature with that of Europe at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early efforts.\r\n\r\n  Gil Vicente.\r\n\r\nThe earlier dramatic efforts of Spanish literature may without\r\ninconvenience be briefly dismissed. The reputed author of the _Coplas de\r\nMingo Revulgo_ (R. Cota the elder) likewise composed the first act of a\r\nstory of intrigue and character, purely dramatic but not intended for\r\nrepresentation. This tragic comedy of _Calisto and Meliboea_, which was\r\ncompleted (in 21 acts) by 1499, afterwards became famous under the name\r\nof _Celestina_; it was frequently imitated and translated, and was\r\nadapted for the Spanish stage by R. de Zepeda in 1582. But the father of\r\nthe Spanish drama was J. de la Enzina, whose _representaciones_ under\r\nthe name of \"eclogues\" were dramatic dialogues of a religious or\r\npastoral character. His attempts were imitated more especially by the\r\nPortuguese Gil Vicente, whose writings for the stage appear to be\r\nincluded in the period 1502-1536, and who wrote both in Spanish and in\r\nhis native tongue. A further impulse came, as was natural, from\r\nSpaniards resident in Italy, and especially from B. de Torres Naharro,\r\nwho in 1517 published, as the chief among the \"firstlings of his genius\"\r\n(_Propaladia_), a series of eight _comedias_--a term generally applied\r\nin Spanish literature to any kind of drama. He claimed some knowledge of\r\nthe theory of the ancient drama, divided his plays into _jornadas_[45]\r\n(to correspond to acts), and opened them with an _introyto_ (prologue).\r\nVery various in their subjects, and occasionally odd in form,[46] they\r\nwere gross as well as audacious in tone, and were soon prohibited by the\r\nInquisition. The church remained unwilling to renounce her control over\r\nsuch dramatic exhibitions as she permitted, and sought to suppress the\r\nfew plays on not strictly religious subjects which appeared in the early\r\npart of the reign of Charles I. Though the universities produced both\r\ntranslations from the classical drama and modern Latin plays, these\r\nexercised very little general effect. Juan Perez' (Petreius') posthumous\r\nLatin comedies were mainly versions of Ariosto.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lope de Rueda and his followers.\r\n\r\n  Classical dramas.\r\n\r\nThus the foundation of the Spanish national theatre was reserved for a\r\nman of the people. Cervantes has vividly sketched the humble resources\r\nwhich were at the command of Lope de Rueda, a mechanic of Seville, who\r\nwith his friend the bookseller Timoneda, and two brother authors and\r\nactors in his strolling company, succeeded in bringing dramatic\r\nentertainments out of the churches and palaces into the public places of\r\nthe towns, where they were produced on temporary scaffolds. The manager\r\ncarried about his properties in a corn-sack; and the \"comedies\" were\r\nstill only \"dialogues, and a species of eclogues between two or three\r\nshepherds and a shepherdess,\" enlivened at times by intermezzos of\r\nfavourite comic figures, such as the negress or the Biscayan, \"played\r\nwith inconceivable talent and truthfulness by Lope.\" One of his plays at\r\nleast,[48] and one of Timoneda's,[49] seem to have been taken from an\r\nItalian source; others mingled modern themes with classical\r\napparitions,[50] one of Timoneda's was (perhaps again through the\r\nItalian) from Plautus.[51] Others of a slighter description were called\r\n_pasos_,--a species afterwards termed _entremeses_ and resembling the\r\nmodern French _proverbes_. With these popular efforts of Lope de Rueda\r\nand his friends a considerable dramatic activity began in the years\r\n1560-1590 in several Spanish cities, and before the close of this period\r\npermanent theatres began to be fitted up at Madrid. Yet Spanish dramatic\r\nliterature might still have been led to follow Italian into an imitation\r\nof classical models. Two plays by G. Bermudez (1577), called by their\r\nlearned author \"the first Spanish tragedies,\" treating the national\r\nsubject of Inez de Castro, but divided into five acts, composed in\r\nvarious metres, and introducing a chorus; a _Dido_ (c. 1580) by C. de\r\nVirues (who claimed to have first divided dramas into three _jornadas_);\r\nand the tragedies of L. L. de Argensola (acted 1585, and praised in _Don\r\nQuixote_) alike represent this tendency.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cervantes.\r\n\r\nSuch were the alternatives which had opened for the Spanish drama, when\r\nat last, about the same time as that of the English, its future was\r\ndetermined by writers of original genius. The first of these was the\r\nimmortal Cervantes, who, however, failed to anticipate by his earlier\r\nplays (1584-1588) the great (though to him unproductive) success of his\r\nfamous romance. In his endeavour to give a poetic character to the drama\r\nhe fell upon the expedient of introducing personified abstractions\r\nspeaking a \"divine\" or elevated language--a device which was for a time\r\nfavourably received. But these plays exhibit a neglect or ignorance of\r\nthe laws of dramatic construction; their action is episodical; and it is\r\nfrom the realism of these episodes (especially in the _Numancia_, which\r\nis crowded with both figures and incidents), and from the power and flow\r\nof the declamation, that their effect must have been derived. When in\r\nhis later years (1615) Cervantes returned to dramatic composition, the\r\nstyle and form of the national drama had been definitively settled by a\r\nlarge number of writers, the brilliant success of whose acknowledged\r\nchief may previously have diverted Cervantes from his labours for the\r\ntheatre. His influence upon the general progress of dramatic literature\r\nis, however, to be sought, not only in his plays, but also in those\r\n_novelas exemplares_--incomparable alike in their clearness and their\r\nterseness of narrative--to which more than one drama is indebted for its\r\nplot, and for much of its dialogue to boot.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lope de Vega.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega, one of the most astonishing geniuses the world has known,\r\npermanently established the national forms of the Spanish drama. Some of\r\nthese were in their beginnings taken over by him from ruder\r\npredecessors; some were cultivated with equal or even superior success\r\nby subsequent authors; but in variety, as in fertility of dramatic\r\nproduction, he has no rivals. His fertility, which was such that he\r\nwrote about 1500 plays, besides 300 dramatic works classed as _autos\r\nsacramentales_ and _entremeses_, and a vast series of other literary\r\ncompositions, has indisputably prejudiced his reputation with those to\r\nwhom he is but a name and a number. Yet as a dramatist Lope more fully\r\nexemplifies the capabilities of the Spanish theatre than any of his\r\nsuccessors, though as a poet Calderon may deserve the palm. Nor would it\r\nbe possible to imagine a truer representative of the Spain of his age\r\nthan a poet who, after suffering the hardships of poverty and exile, and\r\nthe pangs of passion, sailed against the foes of the faith in the\r\nInvincible Armada, subsequently became a member of the Holy Inquisition\r\nand of the order of St Francis, and after having been decorated by the\r\npope with the cross of Malta and a theological doctorate, honoured by\r\nthe nobility, and idolized by the nation, ended with the names of Jesus\r\nand Mary on his lips. From the plays of such a writer we may best learn\r\nthe manners and the sentiments, the ideas of religion and honour, of the\r\nSpain of the Philippine age, the age when she was most prominent in the\r\neyes of Europe and most glorious in her own. For, with all its\r\ninventiveness and vigour, the genius of Lope primarily set itself the\r\ntask of pleasing his public,--the very spirit of whose inner as well as\r\nouter life is accordingly mirrored in his dramatic works. In them we\r\nhave, in the words of Lope's French translator Baret, \"the movement, the\r\nclamour, the conflict of unforeseen intrigues suitable to unreflecting\r\nspectators; perpetual flatteries addressed to an unextinguishable\r\nnational pride; the painting of passions dear to a people never tired of\r\nadmiring itself; the absolute sway of the point of honour; the\r\ndeification of revenge; the adoration of symbols; buffoonery and\r\nburlesque, everywhere beloved of the multitude, but here never defiled\r\nby obscenities, for this people has a sense of delicacy, and the\r\nfoundation of its character is nobility; lastly, the flow of proverbs\r\nwhich at times escape from the _gracioso_\" (the comic servant\r\ndomesticated in the Spanish drama by Lope)--\"the commonplace literature\r\nof those who possess no other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedias de capa y espada.\r\n\r\n  Heróicas.\r\n\r\n  Comedias de santos.\r\n\r\n  Autos sacramentales.\r\n\r\n  Entremeses.\r\n\r\nThe plays of Lope, and those of the national Spanish drama in general,\r\nare divided into classes which it is naturally not always easy, and\r\nwhich there is no reason to suppose him always to have intended, to keep\r\ndistinct from one another. After in his early youth composing eclogues,\r\npastoral plays, and allegorical moralities in the old style, he began\r\nhis theatrical activity at Madrid about 1590, and the plays which he\r\nthenceforth produced have been distributed under the following heads.\r\nThe _comedias_, all of which are in verse, include (1) the so-called _c.\r\nde capa y espada_--not comedies proper, but dramas in which the\r\nprincipal personages are taken from the class of society that wears\r\ncloak and sword. Gallantry is their main theme, an interesting and\r\ncomplicated, but well-constructed and perspicuous intrigue their chief\r\nfeature; and this is usually accompanied by an underplot in which the\r\n_gracioso_ plays his part. Their titles are frequently taken from the\r\nold proverbs or proverbial phrases of the people[52] upon the theme\r\nsuggested, by which the plays often (as G. H. Lewes admirably expresses\r\nit) constitute a kind of gloss (_glosa_) in action. This is the\r\nfavourite species of the national Spanish theatre; and to the plots of\r\nthe plays belonging to it the drama of other nations owes a debt almost\r\nincalculable in extent. (2) The _c. heróicas_ are distinguished by some\r\nof their personages being of royal or very high rank, and by their\r\nthemes being often historical and largely[53] (though not\r\ninvariably[54]) taken from the national annals, or founded on\r\ncontemporary or recent events.[55] Hence they exhibit a greater gravity\r\nof tone; but in other respects there is no difference between them and\r\nthe cloak-and-sword comedies with which they share the element of comic\r\nunderplots. Occasionally Lope condescended in the opposite direction, to\r\n(3) plays of which the scene is laid in common life, but for which no\r\nspecial name appears to have existed.[56] Meanwhile, both he and his\r\nsuccessors were too devoted sons of the church not to acknowledge in\r\nsome sort her claim to influence the national drama. This claim she had\r\nnever relinquished, even when she could no longer retain an absolute\r\ncontrol over the stage. For a time, indeed, she was able to reassert\r\neven this; for the exhibition of all secular plays was in 1598\r\nprohibited by the dying Philip II., and remained so for two years; and\r\nLope with his usual facility proceeded to supply religious plays of\r\nvarious kinds. After a few dramas on scriptural subjects he turned to\r\nthe legends of the saints; and the _comedias de santos_, of which he\r\nwrote a great number, became an accepted later Spanish variety of the\r\nmiracle-play. True, however, to the popular instincts of his genius, he\r\nthrew himself with special zeal and success into the composition of\r\nanother kind of religious plays--a development of the Corpus Christi\r\npageants, in honour of which all the theatres had to close their doors\r\nfor a month. These were the famous _autos sacramentales_ (i.e. solemn\r\n\"acts\" or proceedings in honour of the Sacrament), which were performed\r\nin the open air by actors who had filled the cars of the sacred\r\nprocession. Of these Lope wrote about 400. These entertainments were\r\narranged on a fixed scheme, comprising a prologue in dialogue between\r\ntwo or more actors in character (_loa_), a farce (_entremes_), and the\r\n_auto_ proper, an allegorical scene of religious purport, as an example\r\nof which Ticknor cites the _Bridge of the World_,--in which the Prince\r\nof Darkness in vain seeks to defend the bridge against the Knight of the\r\nCross, who finally leads the Soul of Man in triumph across it. Not all\r\nthe _entremeses_ of Lope and others were, however, composed for\r\ninsertion in these _autos_. This long-lived popular species, together\r\nwith the old kind of dramatic dialogue called _eclogues_, completes the\r\nlist of the varieties of his dramatic works.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The school of Lope.\r\n\r\nThe example of Lope was followed by a large number of writers, and Spain\r\nthus rapidly became possessed of a dramatic literature almost\r\nunparalleled in quantity--for in fertility also Lope was but the first\r\namong many. Among the writers of Lope's school, his friend G. de Castro\r\n(1569-1631) must not be passed by, for his _Cid_[57] was the basis of\r\nCorneille's; nor J. P. de Montalban, \"the first-born of Lope's genius,\"\r\nthe extravagance of whose imagination, like that of Lee, culminated in\r\nmadness. Soon after him died (1639) Juan Ruiz de Alarcon, in whose\r\nplays, as contrasted with those of Lope, has been recognized the\r\ndistinctive element of a moral purpose. To G. Tellez, called Tirso de\r\nMolina (d. 1648), no similar praise seems due; but the frivolous gaiety\r\nof the inventor of the complete character of Don Juan was accompanied by\r\ningenuity in the construction of his excellent[58] though at times\r\n\"sensational\"[59] plots. F. de Rojas Zorrilla (b. 1607), who was largely\r\nplundered by the French dramatists of the latter half of the century,\r\nsurvived Molina for about a generation. In vain scholars of strictly\r\nclassical tastes protested in essays in prose and verse against the\r\nascendancy of the popular drama; the prohibition of Philip II. had been\r\nrecalled two years after his death and was never renewed; and the\r\nactivity of the theatre spread through the towns and villages of the\r\nland, everywhere under the controlling influence of the school of\r\nwriters who had established so complete a harmony between the drama and\r\nthe tastes and tendencies of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Calderon.\r\n\r\nThe glories of Spanish dramatic literature reached their height in P.\r\nCalderon de la Barca, though in the history of the Spanish theatre he\r\nholds only the second place. He elaborated some of the forms of the\r\nnational drama, but brought about no changes of moment in any of them.\r\nEven the brilliancy of his style, glittering with a constant\r\nreproduction of the same family of tropes, and the variety of his\r\nmelodious versification, are mere intensifications of the poetic\r\nqualities of Lope, while in their moral and religious sentiments, and\r\ntheir general views of history and society, there is no difference\r\nbetween the two. Like Lope, Calderon was a soldier in his youth and an\r\necclesiastic in his later years; like his senior, he suited himself to\r\nthe tastes of both court and people, and applied his genius with equal\r\nfacility to the treatment of religious and of secular themes. In\r\nfertility Calderon was inferior to Lope (for he wrote not many more than\r\n100 plays); but he surpasses the elder poet in richness of style, and\r\nmore especially in fire of imagination. In his _autos_ (of which he is\r\nsaid to have left not less than 73), Calderon probably attained to his\r\nmost distinctive excellence; some of these appear to take a wide range\r\nof allegorical invention,[60] while they uniformly possess great beauty\r\nof poetical detail. Other of his most famous or interesting pieces are\r\n_comedias de santos_.[61] In his secular plays he treats as wide a\r\nvariety of subjects as Lope, but it is not a dissimilar variety; nor\r\nwould it be easy to decide whether a poet so uniformly admirable within\r\nhis limits has achieved greater success in romantic historical\r\ntragedy,[62] in the comedy of amorous intrigue,[63] or in a dramatic\r\nwork combining fancy and artificiality in such a degree that it has been\r\ndiversely described as a romantic caprice and as a philosophical\r\npoem.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Contemporaries of Calderon.\r\n\r\n  Moreto and the comedia de figuron.\r\n\r\nDuring the life of the second great master of the Spanish drama there\r\nwas little apparent abatement in the productivity of its literature;\r\nwhile the _autos_ continued to flourish in Madrid and elsewhere, till in\r\n1765 (shortly before the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain) their\r\npublic representation was prohibited by royal decree. In the world of\r\nfashion, the opera had reached Spain already during Calderon's lifetime,\r\ntogether with other French influences, and the great dramatist had\r\nhimself written one or two of his plays for performance with music. But\r\nthe regular national drama continued to command popular favour, and with\r\nA. Moreto may be said to have actually taken a step in advance. While he\r\nwrote in all the forms established by Lope and cultivated by Calderon,\r\nhis manner seems most nearly to approach the masterpieces of French and\r\nlater English comedy of character; he was the earliest writer of the\r\n_comedias de figuron_, in which the most prominent personage is (in\r\nCongreve's phrase) \"a character of affectation,\" in other words, the\r\nSpanish fop of real life.[65] His masterpiece, a favourite of many\r\nstages, is one of the most graceful and pleasing of modern\r\ncomedies--simple but interesting in plot, and true to nature, with\r\nsomething like Shakespearian truth.[66] Other writers trod more closely\r\nin the footsteps of the masters without effecting any noticeable changes\r\nin the form of the Spanish drama; even the _saynete_ (tit-bit), which\r\nowes its name to Benavente (fl. 1645), was only a kind of _entremes_.\r\nThe Spanish drama in all its forms retained its command over the nation,\r\nbecause they were alike popular in origin and character; nor is there\r\nany other example of so complete an adaptation of a national art to the\r\nnational taste and sentiment in its ethics and aesthetics, in the nature\r\nof the plots of the plays (whatever their origin), in the motives of\r\ntheir actions, in the conduct and tone and in the very costume of their\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decay of the national Spanish drama.\r\n\r\n  The French school of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n  Other later dramatists.\r\n\r\nNational as it was, and because of this very quality, the Spanish drama\r\nwas fated to share the lot of the people it so fully represented. At the\r\nend of the 17th century, when the Spanish throne at last became the\r\ndeclared apple of discord among the governments of Europe, the Spanish\r\npeople lay, in the words of an historian of its later days, \"like a\r\ncorpse, incapable of feeling its own impotence.\" That national art to\r\nwhich it had so faithfully clung had fallen into decline and decay with\r\nthe spirit of Spain itself. By the time of the close of the great war,\r\nthe theatre had sunk into a mere amusement of the populace, which during\r\nthe greater part of the 18th century, while allowing the old masters the\r\nmeasure of favour which accords with traditional esteem, continued to\r\nuphold the representatives of the old drama in its degeneracy--authors on\r\nthe level of their audiences. But the Spanish court was now French, and\r\nin the drama, even more than in any other form of art, France was the\r\narbiter of taste in Europe. With the restoration of peace accordingly\r\nbegan isolated attempts to impose the French canons of dramatic theory,\r\nand to follow the example of French dramatic practice; and in the middle\r\nof the century these endeavours assumed more definite form. Montiano's\r\nbloodless tragedy of _Virginia_ (1750), which was never acted, was\r\naccompanied by a discourse endeavouring to reconcile the doctrines of the\r\nauthor with the practice of the old Spanish dramatists; the play itself\r\nwas in blank verse (a metre never used by Calderon, though occasionally\r\nby Lope), instead of the old national ballad-measures (the\r\nromance-measure with assonance and the rhymed _redondilla_ quatrain)\r\npreferred by the old masters among the variety of metres employed by\r\nthem. The earliest Spanish comedy in the French form (a translation only,\r\nthough written in the national metre)[67] (1751), and the first original\r\nSpanish comedy on the same model, Nicolas Moratin's _Petimetra_\r\n(_Petite-Maîtresse_), printed in 1726 with a critical dissertation,\r\nlikewise remained unacted. In 1770, however, the same author's\r\n_Hormesinda_, an historic drama on a national theme and in the national\r\nmetre, but adhering to the French rules, appeared on the stage; and\r\nsimilar attempts followed in tragedy by the same writer and others\r\n(including Ayala, who ventured in 1775 to compete with Cervantes on the\r\ntheme of Numantia), and in comedy by Iriarte and Jovellanos (afterwards\r\nminister under Godoy), who produced a sentimental comedy in Diderot's\r\nmanner.[68] But these endeavours failed to effect any change in the\r\npopular theatre, which was with more success raised from its deepest\r\ndegradation by R. de la Cruz, a fertile author of light pieces of genuine\r\nhumour, especially _saynetes_, depicting the manners of the middle and\r\nlower classes. In literary circles Garcia de la Huerta's voluminous\r\ncollection of the old plays (1785) gave a new impulse to dramatic\r\nproductivity, and the conflict continued between representatives of the\r\nold school, such as Luciano Francisco Comella (1716-1779) and of the new,\r\nsuch as the younger Moratin, whose comedies--of which the last and most\r\nsuccessful[69] was in prose--raised him to the foremost position among\r\nthe dramatists of his age. In tragedy N. de Cienfuegos likewise showed\r\nsome originality. After, however, the troubles of the French domination\r\nand the war had come to an end, the precepts and examples of the new\r\nschool failed to reassert themselves.\r\n\r\nAlready in 1815 an active critical controversy was carried on by Böhl de\r\nFaber against the efforts of J. Faber and Alcalá Galiano to uphold the\r\nprinciples of classicism; and with the aid of the eminent actor Máiquez\r\nthe old romantic masterpieces were easily reinstated in the public\r\nfavour, which as a matter of fact they had never forfeited. The Spanish\r\ndramatists of the 19th century, after passing, as in the instance of F.\r\nMartinez de la Rosa and Bréton de los Herreros, from the system of\r\nFrench comedy to the manner of the national drama, appear either to have\r\nstood under the influence of the French romantic school, or to have\r\nreturned once more to the old Spanish models. Among the former class A.\r\nGil y Zarate, of the latter J. Zorrilla, are mentioned as specially\r\nprominent. The most renowned Spanish dramatist at the opening of the\r\n20th century was the veteran politician and man of letters J. Echegaray.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the old religious performances are not wholly extinct in\r\nSpain, and the relics of the solemn pageantry with which they were\r\nassociated may long continue to survive there, as in the case of the\r\n_pasos_, which claim to have been exhibited in Holy Week at Seville for\r\nat least three centuries. As to the theatre itself, there can be no fear\r\neither that the imitation of foreign examples will satisfy Spanish\r\ndramatists--especially when, like the author of _Doña Perfecta_ (Perez\r\nGaldos), they have excellent home material of their own for\r\nadaptation,--or that the Spanish public itself, with fine actors and\r\nactresses still upholding the lofty traditions of the national drama,\r\nwill remain too fatigued to consume the drama unless bit by bit--in the\r\nshape of _zarzuelas_ and similar one-act confections. Whatever may be\r\nthe future of one of the noblest of modern dramatic literatures, it may\r\nconfidently be predicted that, so long as Spain is Spain, her theatre\r\nwill not be permanently either denationalized or degraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) _Portugal._\r\n\r\n  The Portuguese drama.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese drama in its earlier phases, especially before in the\r\nlatter part of the 14th century the nation completely achieved its\r\nindependence, seems to have followed much the same course as the\r\nSpanish; and the religious drama in all its prevailing forms and direct\r\noutgrowths retained its popularity even by the side of the products of\r\nthe Renaissance. In the later period of that movement translations of\r\nclassical dramas into the vernacular were stimulated by the cosmopolitan\r\nexample of George Buchanan, who for a time held a post in the university\r\nof Coimbra; to this class of play Teive's _Johannes_ (1553) may be\r\nsupposed to have belonged. In the next generation Antonio Ferreira[70]\r\nand others still wrote comedies more or less on the classical model. But\r\nthe rather vague title of \"the Plautus of Portugal\" is accorded to an\r\nearlier comic writer, the celebrated Gil Vicente, who died about 1536,\r\nafter, it is stated, producing forty-two plays. He was the founder of\r\npopular Portuguese comedy, and his plays were called _autos_, or by the\r\ncommon name of _praticas_.[71] Among his most gifted successors are\r\nmentioned A. Ribeiro, called _Chiado_ (the mocking-bird), who died in\r\n1590;[72] his brother Jeronymo, B. Dias, A. Pires, J. Pinto, H. Lopes\r\nand others. The dramatic efforts of the illustrious poet Luis de Camões\r\n(Camoens) are relatively of slight importance; they consist of one of\r\nthe many modern versions of the _Amphitruo_, and of two other comedies,\r\nof which the earlier (_Filodemo_) was acted at Goa in 1553, the subjects\r\nhaving a romantic colour.[73] Of greater importance were the\r\ncontributions to dramatic literature of F. de Sá de Miranda, who, being\r\nwell acquainted with both Spanish and Italian life, sought early in his\r\ncareer to domesticate the Italian comedy of intrigue on the Portuguese\r\nstage;[74] but he failed to carry with him the public taste, which\r\npreferred the _autos_ of Gil Vicente. The followers of Miranda were,\r\nhowever, more successful than he had been himself, among them the\r\nalready-mentioned Antonio Ferreira; the prose plays of Jorge Ferreira de\r\nVasconcellos, which bear some resemblance to the Spanish _Celestina_,\r\nare valuable as pictures of contemporary manners in city and court.[75]\r\n\r\nThe later Portuguese dramatic literature seems also to have passed\r\nthrough phases corresponding to those of the Spanish, though with\r\nspecial features of its own. In the 18th century Alcino Mycenio\r\n(1728-1770), known as Domingos dos Reis Quito in everyday life, in which\r\nhis avocation was that of Allan Ramsay, was remarkably successful with a\r\nseries of plays,[76] including of course an _Inez de Castro_, which in a\r\nsubsequent adaptation by J. B. Gomes long held the national stage.\r\nAnother dramatist, of both merit and higher aspirations, was Lycidas\r\nCynthio (_alias_ Manoel de Figueiredo, 1725-1801).[77] But the romantic\r\nmovement was very late in coming to Portugal. Curiously enough, one of\r\nits chief representatives, the viscount da Almeida Garrett, exhibited\r\nhis sympathy with French, revolutionary and anti-English ideas by a\r\ntragedy on the subject of Cato;[78] but his later works were mainly on\r\nnational subjects.[79] The expansive tendencies of later Portuguese\r\ndramatic literature are illustrated by the translations of A. F. de\r\nCastilho, who even ventured upon Goethe's _Faust_ (1872). Among\r\n19th-century dramatists are to be noted Pereira da Cunha, R. Cordeiro,\r\nE. Biester, L. Palmeirin, and Garrett's disciple F. G. de Amorim, by\r\nwhom both political and social themes have been freely treated. The\r\nreaction against romanticism observable in Portuguese poetic literature\r\ncan hardly fail to affect (or perhaps has already affected) the growth\r\nof the national drama; for the receptive qualities of both are not less\r\nstriking than the productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) _France._\r\n\r\n  The French regular drama.\r\n\r\nFrance was the only country, besides Italy, in which classical tragedy\r\nwas naturalized. In 1531 the Benedictine Barthélemy of Loches printed a\r\n_Christus Xylonicus_; and a very notable impulse was given both to the\r\ntranslation and to the imitation of ancient models by a series of\r\nefforts made in the university of Paris and other French places of\r\nlearning. The most successful of these attempts was the _Johannes\r\nBaptistes_ of George Buchanan, who taught in Paris for five years and at\r\na rather later date resided at Bordeaux, where in 1540 he composed this\r\ncelebrated tragedy (afterwards translated into four or five modern\r\nlanguages), in which it is now ascertained that he had in view the trial\r\nand condemnation of Sir Thomas More. He also wrote _Jephthah_, and\r\ntranslated into Latin the _Medea_ and _Alcestis_ of Euripides. At a\r\nrather later date the great scholar M. A. Muret (Muretus) produced his\r\n_Julius Caesar_, a work perhaps superior in correctness to Buchanan's\r\ntragic masterpiece, but inferior to it in likeness to life. About the\r\nsame time the enthusiasm of the Paris classicists showed itself in\r\nseveral translations of Sophoclean and Euripidean tragedies into French\r\nverse.[80]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jodelle.\r\n\r\nThus the beginnings of the regular drama in France, which, without\r\nabsolutely determining, potently swayed its entire course, came to\r\nconnect themselves directly with the great literary movement of the\r\nRenaissance. Du Bellay sounded the note of attack which converted that\r\nmovement in France into an endeavour to transform the national\r\nliterature; and in Ronsard the classical school of poetry put forward\r\nits conquering hero and sovereign lawgiver. Among the disciples who\r\ngathered round Ronsard, and with him formed the \"Pleiad\" of French\r\nliterature, Étienne Jodelle, the reformer of the French theatre, soon\r\nheld a distinguished place. The stage of this period left ample room for\r\nthe enterprise of this youthful writer. The popularity of the old\r\nentertainments had reached its height when Louis XII., in his conflict\r\nwith Pope Julius II., had not scrupled to call in the aid of Pierre\r\nGringoire (Gringon), and when the _Mère sotte_ had mockingly masqueraded\r\nin the petticoats of Holy Church. In the reign of Francis I. the\r\nInquisition, and on occasion the king himself, had to some extent\r\nsucceeded in repressing the audacity of the actors, whose follies were\r\nat the same time an utter abomination in the eyes of the Huguenots. For\r\na time the very mysteries of the Brethren of the Passion had been\r\nprohibited; while the moralities and farces had sunk to an almost\r\ncontemptible level. Yet to this reign belong the contributions to\r\nfarce-literature of three writers so distinguished as Rabelais\r\n(non-extant), Clément Marot and Queen Margaret of Navarre. Meanwhile\r\nisolated translations of Italian[81] as well as classical dramas had in\r\nliterature begun the movement which Jodelle now transferred to the stage\r\nitself. His tragedy _Cléopatre captive_ was produced there on the same\r\nday as his comedy _L'Eugène_, in 1552, his _Didon se sacrifiant_\r\nfollowing in 1558. Thus at a time when a national theatre was perhaps\r\nimpossible in a country distracted by civil and religious conflicts,\r\nwhose monarchy had not yet welded together a number of provinces\r\nattached each to its own traditions, and whose population, especially in\r\nthe capital, was enervated by frivolity or enslaved by fanaticism, was\r\nborn that long-lived artificial growth, the so-called classical tragedy\r\nof France. For French comedy, though subjected to the same influences as\r\ntragedy, had a national basis upon which to proceed, and its history is\r\npartly that of a modification of old popular forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n  French tragedy in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nThe history of French tragedy begins with the _Cléopâtre captive_, in\r\nthe representation of which the author, together with other members of\r\nthe \"Pleiad,\" took part. It is a tragedy in the manner of Seneca, devoid\r\nof action and provided with a ghost and a chorus. Though mainly written\r\nin the five-foot Iambic couplet, it already contains passages in the\r\nAlexandrine metre, which soon afterwards J. de La Péruse by his _Médée_\r\n(pr. 1556) established in French tragedy, and which Jodelle employed in\r\nhis _Didon_. Numerous tragedies followed in the same style by various\r\nauthors, among whom Gabriel Bounyn produced the first French regular\r\ntragedy on a subject neither Greek nor Roman,[82] and the brothers de la\r\nTaille,[83] and J. Grévin,[84] distinguished themselves by their style.\r\nIn the reign of Charles IX. a vain attempt was made by Nicolas Filleul\r\nto introduce the pastoral style of the Italians into French tragedy;[85]\r\nand the Brotherhood of the Passion was intermingling with pastoral plays\r\nits still continued reproductions of the old entertainments, and the\r\nreligious drama making its expiring efforts, among which T. Le Coq's\r\ninteresting mystery of _Cain_ (1580) should be noted. Beza's _Abraham\r\nsacrifiant_ (1550), J. de Coignac's _Goliath_ (dedicated to Edward VI.),\r\nRivandeau's _Haman_ (1561), belong to a group of Biblical tragedies,\r\ninspired by Calvinist influences. But these more and more approached to\r\nthe examples of the classical school, which, in spite of all\r\ndifficulties and rivalries, prevailed. Among its followers Montchrétien\r\nexhibited unusual vigour of rhetoric,[86] and in R. Garnier French\r\ntragedy reached the greatest height in nobility and dignity of style, as\r\nwell as in the exhibition of dramatic passion, to which it attained\r\nbefore Corneille. In his tragedies[87] choruses are still interspersed\r\namong the long Alexandrine tirades of the dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedy under Italian influence.\r\n\r\nDuring this period comedy had likewise been influenced by classical\r\nmodels; but the distance was less between the national farces and\r\nTerence, than between the mysteries and moralities, and Seneca and the\r\nGreeks. _L'Eugène_ differs little in style from the more elaborate of\r\nthe old farces; and while it satirizes the foibles of the clergy without\r\nany appreciable abatement of the old licence, its theme is the favourite\r\nburden of the French comic theatre in all times--_le cocuage_. The\r\nexamples, however, which directly facilitated the productivity of the\r\nFrench comic dramatists of this period, among whom Jean de la Taille was\r\nthe first to attempt a regular comedy in prose,[88] were those of the\r\nItalian stage, which in 1576 established a permanent colony in France,\r\ndestined to survive there till the close of the 17th century, by which\r\ntime it had adopted the French language, and was ready to coalesce with\r\nFrench actors, without, however, relinquishing all remembrance of its\r\norigin. R. Belleau, a member of the \"Pleiad,\" produced a comedy in which\r\nthe type (already approached by Jodelle) of the swaggering captain\r\nappears,[89] J. Grévin copied Italian intrigue, characters and\r\nmanners;[90] O. de Turnèbe (d. 1581) borrowed the title of one Italian\r\nplay[91] and perhaps parts of the plots of others; the Florentine F.\r\nd'Amboise (d. 1558) produced versions of two Italian comedies;[92] and\r\nthe foremost French comic poet of the century, P. de Larivey, likewise\r\nan Italian born (of the name of Pietro Giunto), openly professed to\r\nimitate the poets of his native country. His plays are more or less\r\nliteral translations of L. Dolce,[93] Secchi[94] and other Italian\r\ndramatists; and this lively and witty author, to whom Molière owes much,\r\nthus connects two of the most important and successful growths of the\r\nmodern comic drama.\r\n\r\nThe close conjunction between the history of a living dramatic\r\nliterature and that of the theatre can least of all be ignored in the\r\ncase of France, where the actor's art has gone through so ample an\r\nevolution, and where the theatre has so long and continuously formed an\r\nimportant part of the national life. By the middle of the 16th century\r\nnot only had theatrical representations, now quite emancipated from\r\nclerical control, here and there already become matters of speculation\r\nand business, but the acting profession was beginning to organize itself\r\nas such; strolling companies of actors had become a more or less\r\nfrequent experience; and the attitude of the church and of civic\r\nrespectability were once more coming to be systematically hostile to the\r\nstage and its representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  French tragedy and comedy in the 17th century before Corneille.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, either tragedy or comedy in France entered into the\r\nperiod of their history when genius was to illuminate both of them with\r\ncreations of undying merit, and before the theatre had associated itself\r\nenduringly with the artistic and literary divisions of court and society\r\nand the people at large, the country had passed through a new phase of\r\nthe national life. When the troubles and terrors of the great civil and\r\nreligious wars of the 16th century were over at last, they were found to\r\nhave produced a reaction towards culture and refinement which spread\r\nfrom certain spheres of society whose influence was for a time\r\nprevailing. The seal had been set upon the results of the Renaissance by\r\nMalherbe, the father of French style. The masses meanwhile continued to\r\nsolace or distract their weariness and their sufferings with the help of\r\nthe accredited ministers of that half-cynical gaiety which has always\r\nlighted up the darkest hours of French popular life. In the troublous\r\ndays preceding Richelieu's definitive accession to power (1624), the\r\n_tabarinades_--a kind of street dialogue recalling the earliest days of\r\nthe popular drama--had made the Pont-Neuf the favourite theatre of the\r\nParisian populace. Meanwhile the influence of Spain, which Henry IV. had\r\novercome in politics, had throughout his reign and afterwards been\r\npredominant in other spheres, and not the least in that of literature.\r\nThe _stilo culto_, of which Gongora was the native Spanish, Marino the\r\nItalian, and Lyly the English representative, asserted its dominion over\r\nthe favourite authors of French society; the pastoral romance of Honoré\r\nd'Urfé--the text-book of pseudo-pastoral gallantry--was the parent of\r\nthe romances of the Scudérys, de La Calprenède and Mme de La Fayette;\r\nthe Hôtel de Rambouillet was in its glory; the true (not the false)\r\n_précieuses_ sat on the heights of intellectual society; and J. L. G. de\r\nBalzac (ridiculed in the earliest French dramatic parody)[95] and\r\nVoiture were the dictators of its literature. Much of the French drama\r\nof this age is of the same kind as its romance-literature, like which it\r\nfell under the polite castigation of Boileau's satire. Heroic love\r\n(quite a technical passion), \"fertile in tender sentiments,\" seized hold\r\nof the theatre as well as of the romances; and La Calprenède, G. de\r\nScudéry[96] and his sister and others were equally fashionable in both\r\nspecies. The Gascon Cyrano de Bergerac, though not altogether\r\ninsignificant as a dramatist,[97] gained his chief literary reputation\r\nby a Rabelaisian fiction. Meanwhile, Spanish and Italian models\r\ncontinued to influence both branches of the drama. Everybody knew by\r\nheart Gongora's version of the story of \"young Pyramus and his love\r\nThisbe,\" as dramatized by Th. Viaud (1590-1626); and the sentiment of\r\nTristan[98] (1601-1655) overpowered Herod on the stage, and drew tears\r\nfrom Cardinal Richelieu in the audience. J. Mairet was noted for\r\nsuperior vigour.[99] P. Du Ryer's style is described as, while otherwise\r\nsuperior to that of his contemporaries, Italian in its defects. A\r\nmixture of the forms of classical comedy with elements of Spanish and of\r\nthe Italian pastoral was attempted with great temporary success by A.\r\nHardy, a playwright who thanked Heaven that he knew the precepts of his\r\nart while preferring to follow the demands of his trade. The mixture of\r\nstyles begun by him was carried on by the marquis de Racan,[100] J. de\r\nRotrou and others; and among these comedies of intrigue in the Spanish\r\nmanner the earliest efforts of Corneille himself[101] are to be classed.\r\nRotrou's noteworthier productions[102] are later in date than the event\r\nwhich marks an epoch in the history of the French drama, the appearance\r\nof Corneille's _Cid_ (1636).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Corneille.\r\n\r\nP. Corneille is justly revered as the first, and in some respects the\r\nunequalled, great master of French tragedy, whatever may have been\r\nunsound in his theories, or defective in his practice. The attempts of\r\nhis predecessors had been without life, because they lacked really\r\ntragic characters and the play of really tragic passions; while their\r\nstyle had been either pedantically imitative or a medley of plagiarisms.\r\nHe conquered tragedy at once for the national theatre and for the\r\nnational literature--and this, not by a long tentative process of\r\nproduction, but by a few masterpieces, which may be held to be\r\ncomprehended within the ten years 1636 to 1646; for in his many later\r\ntragedies he never again proved fully equal to himself. The French\r\ntragedy, of which the great age begins with the _Cid_, _Horace_,\r\n_Cinna_, _Polyeucte_ and _Rodogune_, was not, whatever it professed to\r\nbe, a copy of the classical tragedy of Greeks or Romans, or an imitation\r\nof the Italian imitations of these; nor, though in his later tragedies\r\nCorneille depended less and less upon characters, and more and more,\r\nafter the fashion of the Spaniards, upon situations, and even upon\r\nspectacle, were the forms of the Spanish drama able to assert their\r\ndominion over the French tragic stage. The mould of French tragedy was\r\ncast by Corneille; but the creative power of his genius was unable to\r\nfill it with more than a few examples. His range of passions and\r\ncharacters was limited; he preferred, he said, the reproach of having\r\nmade his women too heroic to that of having made his men effeminate. His\r\nactions inclined too much to the exhibition of conflicts political\r\nrather than broadly ethical in their significance. The defects of his\r\nstyle are of less moment; but in this, as in other respects, he was,\r\nwith all his strength and brilliancy, not one of those rarest of artists\r\nwho are at the same time the example and the despair of their\r\nsuccessors. The _examens_ which he printed of all his plays up to 1660\r\nshow how much self-criticism (though it may not always be as in this\r\ncase conscious) contributes to the true fertility of genius.\r\n\r\nIn comedy also Corneille begins the first great original epoch of French\r\ndramatic literature; for it was to him that Molière owed the inspiration\r\nof the tone and style which he made those of the higher forms of French\r\ncomedy. But _Le Menteur_ (the parent, with its sequel, of a numerous\r\ndramatic progeny[103]) was itself derived from a Spanish original,[104]\r\nwhich it did not (as was the case with the _Cid_) transform into\r\nsomething new. French tragi-comedy Corneille can hardly be said to have\r\ninvented;[105] and of the mongrel growths of sentimental comedy and of\r\ndomestic drama or _drame_, he rather suggested than exemplified the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Racine.\r\n\r\nThe tragic art of Racine supplements rather than surpasses that of his\r\nolder contemporary. His works reflect the serene and settled formality\r\nof an age in which the sun of monarchy shone with an effulgence no\r\nclouds seemed capable of obscuring, and in which the life of a nation\r\nseemed reducible to the surroundings of a court. The tone of the poetic\r\nliterature of such an age is not necessarily unreal, because the range\r\nof its ideas is limited, and because its forms seem to exist by an\r\nimmutable authority. That Racine should permanently hold the position\r\nwhich belongs to him in French dramatic literature is due to the fact\r\nthat to him it was given to present these forms--the forms approved by\r\nhis age--in what may reasonably be called perfection; and, from the\r\npoint of view of workmanship, Sophocles could not have achieved more.\r\nWhat his plays contain is another question. They suit themselves so well\r\nto the successive phases in the life of Louis XIV., that Madame de\r\nSévigné described Racine as having in his later years loved God as he\r\nhad formerly loved his mistresses; and this sally at all events\r\nindicates the range of passions which inspired his tragic muse. His\r\nheroes are all of one type--that of a gracious gloriousness; his\r\nheroines vary in their fortunes, but they are all the \"trophies of\r\nlove,\"[106] with the exception of the scriptural figures, which stand\r\napart from the rest.[107] T. Corneille, Campistron, Joseph Duché\r\n(1668-1704), Antoin de Lafosse (c. 1653-1708) and Quinault were mere\r\nfollowers of one or both of the great masters of tragedy, though the\r\nlast named achieved a reputation of his own in the bastard species of\r\nthe opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Characteristics of French classical tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe type of French tragedy thus established, like everything else which\r\nformed part of the \"age of Louis XIV.,\" proclaimed itself as the\r\ndefinitively settled model of its kind, and was accepted as such by a\r\nsubmissive world. Proud of its self-imposed fetters, French tragedy\r\ndictatorially denied the liberty of which it had deprived itself to the\r\nart of which it claimed to furnish the highest examples. Yet, though\r\ncalling itself classical, it had not caught the essential spirit of the\r\ntragedy of the Greeks. The elevation of tone which characterizes the\r\nserious drama of the age of Louis XIV. is a true elevation, but its\r\nheights do not lose themselves in a sphere peopled by the myths of a\r\nnational religion, still less in the region of great thoughts which ask\r\nHeaven to stoop to the aspirations and the failures of man. The\r\npersonages of this drama are conventional like its themes, but the\r\nconvention is with itself only; Orestes and Iphigenia have not brought\r\nwith them the cries of the stern goddesses and the flame on the altar of\r\nArtemis; their passions like their speech are cadenced by a modern\r\nmeasure. In construction, the simplicity and regularity of the ancient\r\nmodels are stereotyped into a rigid etiquette by the exigencies of the\r\ncourt-theatre, which is but an apartment of the palace. The unities of\r\ntime and place, with the Greeks mere rules of convenience, French\r\ntragedy imposes upon itself as a permanent yoke. The Euripidean prologue\r\nis judiciously exchanged for the exposition of the first act, and the\r\nlyrical element essential to Greek tragedy is easily suppressed in its\r\nwould-be copy; lyrical passages still occur in some of Corneille's early\r\nmasterpieces,[108] but the chorus is consistently banished, to reappear\r\nonly in Racine's latest works[109] as a scholastic experiment\r\nappropriate to a conventual atmosphere. Its uses for explanation and\r\ncomment are served by the expedient, which in its turn becomes\r\nconventional, of the conversations with _confidants_ and _confidantes_,\r\nwhich more than sufficiently supply the foil of general sentiments. The\r\nepical element is allowed full play in narrative passages, more\r\nespecially in those which relate parts of the catastrophe,[110] and,\r\nwhile preserving the stage intact from realisms, suit themselves to the\r\ngenerally rhetorical character of this species of the tragic drama. This\r\ncharacter impressed itself more and more upon the tragic art of a\r\nrhetorical nation in an age when the loftiest themes were in the pulpit\r\nreceiving the most artistic oratorical treatment, and developed in the\r\nstyle of French classical tragedy the qualities which cause it to become\r\nsomething between prose and poetry--or to appear (in the phrase of a\r\nFrench critic) like prose in full dress. The force of this description\r\nis borne out by the fact that the distinction between the versification\r\nof French tragedy and that of French comedy seems at times\r\nimperceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Voltaire.\r\n\r\nThe universal genius of Voltaire found it necessary to shine in all\r\nbranches of literature, and in tragedy to surpass predecessors whom his\r\nown authority declared to have surpassed the efforts of the Attic muse.\r\nHe succeeded in impressing the world with the belief that his\r\ninnovations had imparted a fresh vitality to French tragedy; in truth,\r\nhowever, they represent no essential advance in art, but rather\r\naugmented the rhetorical tendency which paralyses true dramatic life.\r\nSuch life as his plays possess lies in their political and social\r\nsentiments, their invective against tyranny,[111] and their exposure of\r\nfanaticism.[112] In other respects his versatility was barren of\r\nenduring results. He might take his themes from French history,[113] or\r\nfrom Chinese,[114] or Egyptian,[115] or Syrian,[116] from the days of\r\nthe Epigoni[117] or from those of the Crusades;[118] he might appreciate\r\nShakespeare, with a more or less partial comprehension of his strength,\r\nand condescendingly borrow from and improve the barbarian.[119] But he\r\nadded nothing to French tragedy where it was weakest--in character; and\r\nwhere it was strongest--in diction--he never equalled Corneille in fire\r\nor Racine in refinement. While the criticism to which French tragedy in\r\nthis age at last began to be subjected has left unimpaired the real\r\ntitles to immortality of its great masters, the French theatre itself\r\nhas all but buried in respectful oblivion the dramatic works bearing the\r\nname of Voltaire--a name persistently belittled, but second to none in\r\nthe history of modern progress and of modern civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n  French classical tragedy in its decline.\r\n\r\nAs it is of relatively little interest to note the ramifications of an\r\nart in its decline, the contrasts need not be pursued among the\r\ncontemporaries of Voltaire, between his imitator Bernard Joseph Saurin\r\n(1706-1781), Saurin's royalist rival de Belloy, Racine's imitator\r\nLagrange-Chancel and Voltaire's own would-be rival, the \"terrible\"\r\nCrébillon the elder, who professed to vindicate to French tragedy,\r\nalready mistress of the heavens through Corneille, and of the earth\r\nthrough Racine, Pluto's supplementary realm, but who, though thus\r\nessaying to carry tragedy lower, failed to carry it farther. In the\r\nlatter part of the 18th century French classical tragedy as a literary\r\ngrowth was dying a slow death, however numerous might be the leaves\r\nwhich sprouted from the decaying tree. Its form had been permanently\r\nfixed; and even Shakespeare, as manipulated by Ducis[120]--an author\r\nwhose tastes were better than his times--failed to bring about a change.\r\n\"It is a Moor, not a Frenchman, who has written this play,\" cried a\r\nspectator of Ducis' _Othello_ (1791); but Talma's conviction was almost\r\nas strong as his capacity was great for convincing his public; and he\r\ncertainly did much to prepare the influence which Shakespeare was\r\ngradually to assert over the French drama, and which was aided by\r\ntranslations, more especially that of Pierre Letourneur (1736-1788),\r\nwhich had attracted the sympathy of Diderot and the execrations of the\r\naged Voltaire.[121] Meanwhile, the command which classical French\r\ntragedy continued to assert over the stage was due in part, no doubt, to\r\nthe love of Roman drapery--not always abundant, but always in the grand\r\nstyle--which characterized the Revolution, and which was by the\r\nRevolution handed down to the Empire. It was likewise, and more\r\nsignally, due to the great actors who freed the tragic stage from much\r\nof its artificiality and animated it by their genius. No great artist\r\nhas ever more generously estimated the labours of a predecessor than\r\nTalma judged those of Le Kain; but it was Talma himself whose genius was\r\npre-eminently fitted to reproduce the great figures of antiquity in the\r\nmimic world, which, like the world outside, both required and possessed\r\nits Caesar. He, like Rachel after him, reconciled French classical\r\ntragedy with nature; and it is upon the art of great original actors\r\nsuch as these that the theatrical future of this form of the drama in\r\nFrance depends. Mere whims of fashion--even when inspired by political\r\nfeeling--will not waft back to it a real popularity; nor will occasional\r\nliterary aftergrowths, however meritorious, such as the admirable\r\n_Lucrèce_ of F. Ponsard and the attempts of even more recent writers,\r\nsuffice to re-establish a living union between it and the progress of\r\nthe national literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedy.\r\n\r\n  Molière.\r\n\r\nThe rival influences under which classical tragedy has after a long\r\nstruggle virtually become a thing of the past in French literature are\r\nalso to be traced in the history of French comedy, which under the\r\nco-operation of other influences produced a wide variety of growths. The\r\ngerms of most of these--though not of all--are to be found in the works\r\nof the most versatile, the most sure-footed, and, in some respects, the\r\nmost consummate master of the comic drama whom the world has\r\nknown--Molière. What Molière found in existence was a comedy of\r\nintrigue, derived from Spanish or Italian examples, and the elements of\r\na comedy of character, in French and more especially in Italian farce\r\nand ballet-pantomime. Corneille's _Menteur_ had pointed the way to a\r\nfuller combination of character with intrigue, and in this direction\r\nMolière's genius exercised the height of its creative powers. After\r\nbeginning with farces, he produced in the earliest of his plays (from\r\n1652), of which more than fragments remain, comedies of intrigue which\r\nare at the same time marvellously lively pictures of manners, and then\r\nproceeded, with the _École des maris_ (1661), to begin a long series of\r\nmasterpieces of comedy of character. Yet even these, the chief of which\r\nare altogether unrivalled in dramatic literature, do not exhaust the\r\nvariety of his productions. To define the range of his art is as\r\ndifficult as to express in words the essence of his genius. For though\r\nhe has been copied ever since he wrote, neither his spirit nor his\r\nmanner has descended in full to any of his copyists, whole schools of\r\nwhom have missed elements of both. A Molière can only be judged in his\r\nrelations to the history of comedy at large. He was indeed the inheritor\r\nof many forms and styles--remaining a stranger to those of Old Attic\r\ncomedy only, rooted as it was in the political life of a free imperial\r\ncity; though even the rich extravagances of Aristophanes' burlesque was\r\nnot left wholly unreproduced by him. Molière is both a satirist and a\r\nhumorist; he displays at times the sentiments of a loyal courtier, at\r\nothers that gay spirit of opposition which is all but indispensable to a\r\npopular French wit. His comedies offer elaborate and subtle--even\r\ntender--pictures of human character in its eternal types, lively\r\nsketches of social follies and literary extravagances, and broad appeals\r\nto the ordinary sources of vulgar merriment. Light and perspicuous in\r\nconstruction, he is master of the delicate play of irony, the\r\npenetrating force of wit, and the expansive gaiety of frolicsome fun.\r\nFaithful to the canons of artistic taste, and under the sure guidance of\r\ntrue natural humour, his style suits itself to every species attempted\r\nby him. His morality is the reverse of rigid, but its aberrations are\r\nnot those of prurience, nor its laws those of pretence; and, wholly free\r\nas he was from the didactic aim which is foreign to all true dramatic\r\nrepresentation, the services rendered by him to his art are not the less\r\nservices rendered to society, concerning which the laughter of genuine\r\ncomedy tells the truth. He raised the comedy of character out of the\r\nlower sphere of caricature, and in his greatest creations subordinated\r\nto the highest ends of all dramatic composition the plots he so\r\nskilfully built, and the pictures of the manners he so faithfully\r\nreproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Molière's contemporaries and successors.\r\n\r\nEven among the French comic dramatists of this age there must have been\r\nmany who \"were not aware\" that Molière was its greatest poet. For though\r\nhe had made the true path luminous to them, their efforts were still\r\noften of a tentative kind, and one was reviving _Pathelin_ while another\r\nwas translating the _Andria_. A more unique attempt was made in one of\r\nthe very few really modern versions of an Aristophanic comedy, which\r\ndeserves to be called an original copy--the _Plaideurs_ of Racine. The\r\ntragic poets Quinault and Campistron likewise wrote comedies, one[122]\r\nor more of which furnished materials to contemporary English\r\ndramatists, as did one of the felicitous plays in which Boursault\r\nintroduced Mercury and Aesop into the theatrical _salon_.[123] Antoine\r\nMontfleury (1640-1685), Baron and Dancourt, who were actors like\r\nMolière, likewise wrote comedies. But if the mantle of Molière can be\r\nsaid to have fallen upon any of his contemporaries or successors, this\r\nhonour must be ascribed to J. F. Regnard, who imitated the great master\r\nin both themes and characters,[124] while the skilfulness of his plots,\r\nand his gaiety of the treatment even of subjects tempting into the\r\nby-path of sentimental comedy,[125] entitle him to be regarded as a\r\ncomic poet of original genius. With him C. R. Dufresny occasionally\r\ncollaborated.\r\n\r\nIn the next generation (that of Voltaire) comedy gradually--but only\r\ngradually--surrendered for a time the very essence of its vitality to\r\nthe seductions of a hybrid species, which disguised its identity under\r\nmore than a single name. A. R. le Sage, who as a comic dramatist at\r\nfirst followed successfully in the footsteps of Molière, proved himself\r\non the stage as well as in picturesque fiction a keen observer and\r\ninimitable satirist of human life.[126] The light texture of the playful\r\nand elegant art of J. B. L. Gresset was shown on the stage in a\r\ncharacter comedy of merit;[127] and in a comedy which reveals something\r\nof his pointed wit, A. Piron produced something like a new type of\r\nenduring ridiculousness.[128] P. C. de Marivaux, the French _Spectator_,\r\nis usually supposed to have formed the connecting link between the \"old\"\r\nFrench comedy and the \"new\" and bastard variety. Yet, though his minute\r\nanalysis of the tender passion excited the scorn of Voltaire, it should\r\nnot be overlooked that in _marivaudage_ proper the wit holds the balance\r\nto the sentiment, and that in some of this frequently misjudged writer's\r\nearlier and most delightful plays the elegance and gaiety of diction are\r\nas irresistible as the pathetic sentiment, which is in fact rather an\r\ningredient in his comedy than the pervading characteristic of it.[129]\r\nSome of the comedies of P. H. Destouches no doubt have a serious basis,\r\nand in his later plays he comes near to a kind of drama in which the\r\ncomic purpose has been virtually submerged.[130] The writer who is\r\nactually to be credited with the transition to sentimental comedy, and\r\nwho was fully conscious of the change which he was helping to effect,\r\nwas Nivelle de La Chaussée, in whose hands French comedy became a\r\nchampion of the sanctity of marriage, and reproduced the sentiments--in\r\none instance even the characters--of Richardson.[131] To his play _La\r\nFausse Antipathie_ the author supplied a _critique_, amounting to an\r\napology for the new species of which it was designed as an example.\r\n\r\nThe new species known as _comédie larmoyante_ was now fairly in the\r\nascendant; and it would be easy to show how even Voltaire, who had\r\ndeprecated the innovation, had to yield to a power greater than his own,\r\nand introduced the sentimental element into some of his comedies.[132]\r\nThe further step, by which _comédie larmoyante_ was transformed into\r\n_tragédie bourgeoise_, from which the comic element was to all intents\r\nand purposes extruded, was taken by a great French writer, D. Diderot;\r\nto whose influence it was largely due that the species which had\r\nattained to this consummation for more than a generation ruled supreme\r\nin the dramatic literature of Europe. But the final impulse, as Diderot\r\nhimself virtually acknowledged in the _entretiens_ subjoined by him to\r\nhis _Fils naturel_ (1757), had been given by a far humbler citizen of\r\nthe world of letters, the author of _The London Merchant_. Diderot's own\r\nplays were a literary rather than a theatrical success. _Le Fils naturel\r\nou les épreuves de la vertu_ was not publicly performed till 1771, and\r\nthen only in deference to the determination of a single actor of the\r\nFrançais (Molé); nor was the performance of it repeated. Diderot's\r\nsecond play, _Le Père de famille_, printed in 1758 with a _Discours sur\r\nla poésie dramatique_, went through a few public performances in 1761;\r\nand a later revival was unsuccessful. But \"at a distance,\" as was well\r\nsaid, the effect of Diderot's endeavours, the earlier in particular, was\r\nextremely great, and Lessing, though very critical as to particular\r\npoints, greatly helped to spread it. Diderot had for the first time\r\nconsciously sought to proclaim the theatre an agency of social reform,\r\nand to entrust to it as its task the propagation of the gospel of\r\nphilanthropy. Though the execution of his dramatic works fell far short\r\nof his aims; though Madame de Staël was not far wrong in denouncing them\r\nas exhibiting not nature itself, but \"the affectation of nature,\" yet\r\nthey contained, in a measure almost unequalled in the history of the\r\nmodern drama, the fermenting element which never seems to subside. Their\r\nauthor announced them as examples of a third dramatic form--the _genre\r\nsérieux_--which he declared to be the consummation of the dramatic art.\r\nMaking war upon the frigid artificiality of classical tragedy, he\r\nbanished verse from the new species. The effect of these plays was\r\nintended to spring from their truth to nature--a truth such as no\r\nspectator could mistake, and which should bring home its moral teachings\r\nto the business as well as the bosoms of all. The theatre was to become\r\na real and realistic school of the principles of society and of the\r\nconduct of life--it was, in other words, to usurp functions with which\r\nit has no concern, and to essay the direct reformation of mankind. The\r\nidea was neither new nor just; but its speciousness will probably\r\ncontinue to commend it to many enthusiastic minds, whensoever and in\r\nwhatsoever shape it is revived.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The comedy of the Revolution and the first empire.\r\n\r\n  Vaudevilles, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the history of the French drama becomes that of a\r\nconflict between an enfeebled artistic school and a tendency which is\r\nhardly to be dignified by the name of a school at all. Among the\r\nsuccessful dramatists following on Diderot may be mentioned the critical\r\nand versatile J. F. Marmontel, and more especially M. J. Sedaine, who\r\nthough chiefly working for the opera, produced two comedies of\r\nacknowledged merit.[133] P. A. C. de Beaumarchais (1732-1799), who for\r\nhis early sentimental plays,[134] in which he imitated Diderot, invented\r\nthe appellation _drame_--so convenient in its vagueness that it became\r\nthe accepted name of the hybrid species to which they belonged--in two\r\nworks of a very different kind, the famous _Barbier de Séville_ and the\r\nstill more famous _Mariage de Figaro_, boldly carried comedy back into\r\nits old Spanish atmosphere of intrigue; but, while surpassing all his\r\npredecessors in the skill with which he constructed his frivolous plots,\r\nhe drew his characters with a lightness and sureness of touch peculiar\r\nto himself, animated his dialogue with an unparalleled brilliancy of\r\nwit, and seasoned action as well as dialogue with a political and social\r\nmeaning, which caused his epigrams to become proverbs, and which marks\r\nhis _Figaro_ as a herald of the Revolution. Such plays as these were ill\r\nsuited to the rule of the despot whose vigilance could not overlook\r\ntheir significance. The comedy of the empire is, in the hands of Collin\r\nd'Harleville, Louis Picard (1769-1828), A. Duval, Étienne and others,\r\nmainly a harmless comedy of manners; nor was the attempted innovation of\r\nN. Lemercier--who was fain to invent a new species, that of historical\r\ncomedy--more than a flattering self-delusion. The theatre had its share\r\nin all the movements and changes which ensued in France; though the most\r\nimportant revolution which the drama itself was to undergo was not one\r\nof wholly native origin. Those branches of the drama which belong\r\nspecifically to the history of the opera, or which associate themselves\r\nwith it, are here passed by. Among them was the _vaudeville_ (from Val\r\nde Vire in Calvados), which began as an interspersion of pantomime with\r\nthe airs of popular songs, and which, after the Italian masks had been\r\nremoved from it, was cultivated by Ponsard and Marmontel, while Sedaine\r\nwrote a didactic poem on the subject (1756). Sedaine was the father of\r\nthe _opéra-comique_ proper;[135] Marmontel,[136] as well as\r\nRousseau,[137] likewise composed _opérettes_--a smaller sort of opera,\r\nat first of the pastoral variety; and these flexible species easily\r\nentered into combination. The melodrama proper, of which the invention\r\nis also attributed to Rousseau,[138] in its latter development became\r\nmerely a drama accentuated by music, though usually in little need of\r\nany accentuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The stage.\r\n\r\n  Transition to the romantic school.\r\n\r\nThe chief home of the regular drama, however, demanded efforts of\r\nanother kind. At the Théâtre Français, or Comédie Française, whose\r\nhistory as that of a single company of actors had begun in 1680, the\r\nparty-strife of the times made itself audible; and the most prominent\r\ntragic poet of the Revolution, M. J. de Chénier, a disciple of Voltaire\r\nin dramatic poetry as well as in political philosophy, wrote for the\r\nnational stage the historical drama--with a political moral[139]--in\r\nwhich in the memorable year 1789 the actor Talma achieved his first\r\ncomplete triumph. But the victorious Revolution proclaimed among other\r\nliberties that of the theatres in Paris, of which soon not less than 50\r\nwere open. In 1807 the empire restricted the number to 9, and reinstated\r\nthe Théâtre Français in sole possession (or nearly such) of the right of\r\nperforming the classic drama. No writer of note was, however, tempted or\r\ninspired by the rewards and other encouragements offered by Napoleon to\r\nproduce such a classic tragedy as the emperor would have willingly\r\nstamped from out of the earth. The tragedies of C. Delavigne represent\r\nthe transition from the expiring efforts of the classical to the\r\nambitious beginnings of the romantic school of the French drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The romantic school.\r\n\r\nOf modern romantic drama in France it must suffice to say that it\r\nderives some of its characteristics from the general movement of\r\nromanticism which in various ways and at various points of time\r\ntransformed nearly every modern European literature, others from the\r\nrhetorical tendency which is a French national feature. Victor Hugo was\r\nthe founder whom it followed in a spirit of high emprise to success upon\r\nsuccess, his own being the most conspicuous of all;[140] A. Dumas the\r\nelder its unshrinking middleman. The marvellous fire and grandeur of\r\ngenius of the former, always in extremes but often most sublime at the\r\nheight of danger, was nowhere more signally such than in the drama;\r\nDumas was a Briareus, working, however, with many hands besides his own.\r\nTogether with them may, with more or less precision, be classed in the\r\nromantic school of dramatists A. de Vigny[141] and George Sand,[142]\r\nneither of whom, however, attained to the highest rank in the drama, and\r\nJules Sandeau;[143] A. de Musset, whose originality pervades all his\r\nplays, but whose later works, more especially in his prose \"proverbs\"\r\nand pieces of a similar kind, have a flavour of a delicacy altogether\r\nindescribable;[144] perhaps also P. Mérimée (1803-1870), who invented\r\nnot only Spanish dramas but a Spanish dramatist, and who was never more\r\naudacious than when he seemed most _naïf_.[145]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modern schools.\r\n\r\nThe romantic school was not destined to exercise a permanent control\r\nover French public taste; but it can hardly be said to have been\r\noverthrown by the brief classical revival begun by F. Ponsard, and\r\ncontinued, though in closer contact with modern ideas, both by him[146]\r\nand by E. Augier, a dramatist who gradually attained to an extraordinary\r\neffectiveness in the self-restrained treatment of social as well as of\r\nhistorical themes.[147] While the theatrical fecundity and the\r\nremarkable constructive ability of E. Scribe[148] supplied a long series\r\nof productions attesting the rapid growth of the playwright's mastery\r\nover the secrets of his craft the name of his competitors is legion.\r\nAmong them may be mentioned, if only as the authors of two of the most\r\nsuccessful plays of the historical species produced in the century, two\r\nwriters of great eminence--C. Delavigne[149] and E. Legouvé.[150] Later\r\ndevelopments of the drama bore the impress of a period of social decay,\r\nprepared to probe its own sufferings, while glad at times to take refuge\r\nin the gaiety traditional in France in her more light-hearted days, but\r\nwhich even then had not yet deserted either French social life or the\r\ntheatre which reflected it. After a fashion which would have startled\r\neven Diderot, while recalling his efforts in the earnestness of its\r\nendeavour to arouse moral interests to which the theatre had long been a\r\nstranger, A. Dumas the younger set himself to reform society by means of\r\nthe stage.[151] But the technical skill which he and contemporary\r\ndramatists displayed in the execution of their self-imposed task was\r\nsuch as had been undreamt of by Diderot. O. Feuillet, more eminent as a\r\nnovelist than on the stage, applied himself, though with the aid of\r\nfewer prefaces, to the solution of the same or similar problems; while\r\nthe extraordinary versatility of V. Sardou and his unfailing\r\nconstructive skill was applied by him to almost every kind of serious,\r\nor serio-comic, drama--even the most solid of all.[152] In the same\r\nperiod, while E. Pailleron revived some of the most characteristic\r\ntendencies of the best French satirical comedy in ridiculing the pompous\r\npretentiousness of learning for its own sake,[153] the light-hearted\r\ngaiety of E. Labiche changed into something not altogether similar in\r\nthe productions of the comic muse of L. Halévy and H. Meilhac, ranging\r\nfrom the licence of the musical burlesque which was the congenial\r\ndelight of the later days of the Second Empire to a species of comedy in\r\nwhich the ingredients of bitterness and even of sadness found a\r\nplace.[154]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tendencies of the drama and of the theatre in France.\r\n\r\nDramatic criticism in France has had a material share in the maintenance\r\nof a deep as well as wide national interest in the preservation of a high\r\nstandard of excellence both in the performance of plays and in the plays\r\nthemselves. Among its modern representatives the foremost place would\r\nprobably be by common consent allowed to F. Sarcey, whose Monday\r\ntheatrical _feuilleton_ in the _Temps_ was long awaited week by week as\r\nan oracle of dramaturgy. But he was only the first among equals, and the\r\nsuccessor and the predecessor of writers who have at least sought to be\r\nequal to a function of real public importance. For it seems hardly within\r\nthe range of probability to suppose that the theatre will for many a\r\ngeneration to come lose the hold which it has established over the\r\nintellectual and moral sympathies of nearly the whole of the educated--to\r\nsay nothing of a great part of the half-educated--population of France.\r\nThis does not, of course, imply that the creative activity of French\r\ndramatic literature is certain to endure. Since the great changes set in\r\nwhich were consequent upon the disastrous war of 1870, French dramatic\r\nliterature has reflected more than one phase of national sentiment and\r\nopinion, and has represented the aspirations, the sympathies and the\r\nphilosophy of life of more than one class in the community. Thus it has\r\nhad its episodes of reaction in the midst of an onward flow of which it\r\nwould be difficult to predict the end. The tendency of what can only\r\nvaguely be described as the naturalistic school of writers has\r\ncorresponded to that even more prominent in the dramatic literatures of\r\ncertain other European nations; but it must be allowed that a new poetic\r\nwill have to be constructed if the freedom of development which the\r\ndramatic, like all other arts, is entitled to claim is to be reconciled\r\nto laws deducible from the whole previous history of the drama. The\r\nreaction towards earlier forms has asserted itself in various\r\nways--through the poetic plays of the later years of F. Coppée; in the\r\nsuccess (notable for reasons other than artistic) of Vicomte H. de\r\nBornier's first tragedy; and of late more especially in the\r\ndramas--highly original and truly romantic in both form and treatment--of\r\nE. Rostand.\r\n\r\nThe art of acting is not altogether dependent upon the measure of\r\ncontemporary literary productivity, even in France, where the connexion\r\nbetween dramatic literature and the stage has perhaps been more\r\ncontinuously intimate than in many other countries. Talma and Mlle Mars\r\nflourished in one of the most barren ages of the French literary drama;\r\nand though this cannot be asserted of the two most brilliant stars of\r\nthe French 19th century tragic stage, Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt, or of\r\ntheir comic contemporaries from Frédérick-Lemaître down to types less\r\nunique than the \"Talma of the boulevards,\" the constantly accumulating\r\nexperience of the successive schools of acting in France may here ensure\r\nto the art a future not less notable than its past. Moreover, the French\r\ntheatre has long been, and is more than ever likely to continue, an\r\naffair of the state as well as of the nation; and the judicious policy\r\nof not leaving the chief theatres at the mercy of shifting fashion and\r\nthe base demands of idleness and sensuality will remain the surest\r\nguarantee for the maintenance of a high standard both in principle and\r\nin practice. So long as France continues to maintain her ascendancy over\r\nother nations in matters of taste, and in much else that adorns,\r\nbrightens and quickens social life, the predominant influence of the\r\nFrench theatre over the theatres of other nations is likewise assured.\r\nBut dramatic literature is becoming international to a degree hardly\r\ndreamt of half a century ago; and the distinctive development of the\r\nFrench theatre cannot fail to be affected by the success or failure of\r\nthe national drama in retaining and developing its own most\r\ncharacteristic qualities. Its history shows periods of marvellously\r\nrapid advance, of hardly less swift decline, and of frequent though at\r\ntimes fitful recovery. Its future may be equally varied; but it will\r\nremain not less dependent on the conditions which in every people,\r\nancient or modern, have proved to be indispensable to national vigour\r\nand vitality.     (A. W. W.)\r\n\r\n_Recent French Drama._--The last twenty-five years of the 19th century\r\nwitnessed an important change in the constructive methods, as well as in\r\nthe moral tendencies, of the French playwrights. Of the two leading\r\ndramatists who reigned supreme over the _haute comédie_ in 1875, one,\r\nÉmile Augier, had almost ended his career, but the other, Alexandre\r\nDumas, was to maintain his ascendancy for many years longer. Sardou's\r\nfertility of invention, and extraordinary cleverness at manipulating a\r\ncomplicated intrigue, were also greatly admired, and much was expected\r\nfrom Edouard Pailleron's brilliant and--as it seemed--inexhaustible wit\r\nin satirizing the whims and weaknesses of high-born and highly-cultured\r\nsociety. Alexandre Dumas had created and still monopolized the problem\r\nplay, of which _Le Demi-monde_, _Le Fils naturel_, _La Question\r\nd'argent_, _Les Idées de Madame Aubray_, _La Femme de Claude_, _Monsieur\r\nAlphonse_, _La Visite de noces_, _L'Étrangère_, _Francillon_ and\r\n_Denise_ may be mentioned as the most characteristic specimens. The\r\nproblem play is the presentation of a particular case, with a view to a\r\ngeneral conclusion on some important question of human conduct. This\r\nafforded the author, who was, in his way, a moralist and a reformer,\r\nexcellent opportunities for humorous discussions and the display of that\r\nfamiliar eloquence which was his greatest gift and most effective\r\nfaculty. Among other subjects, the social position of women had an\r\nall-powerful attraction for his mind, and many of his later plays were\r\nwritten with the object of placing in strong relief the remarkable\r\ninequality of the sexes, both as regards freedom of action and\r\nresponsibility, in modern marriage. Like all the dramatists of his time,\r\nhe adhered to Scribe's mode of play-writing--a mixture of the _drame\r\nbourgeois_, as initiated by Diderot, and the comedy of character and\r\nmanners, long in vogue--from the days of Molière, Regnard, Destouches\r\nand Marivaux, down to the beginning of the 19th century. In his prefaces\r\nDumas often undertook the defence of the system which, in his\r\nestimation, was best calculated to serve the purpose of the artist, the\r\nhumorist and the moralist--a dramatist being, as he conceived, a\r\ncombination of the three.\r\n\r\nThough the majority of French playgoers continued to side with him, and\r\nto cling to the time-honoured theatrical beliefs, a few young men were\r\nbeginning to murmur against the too elaborate mechanism and artificial\r\nlogic. Scribe and his successors, whose plays were a combination of\r\ncomedy and drama, were wont to devote the first act to a brilliant and\r\nwitty presentation of personages, then to crowd the following scenes\r\nwith incidents, until the action was brought to a climax about the end\r\nof the fourth act, invariably concluding, in the fifth, with an\r\noptimistic _dénouement_, just before midnight, the time appointed by\r\npolice regulations for the closing of playhouses. At the same time a\r\nmore serious and far-reaching criticism was levelled at the very\r\nprinciples on which the conception of human life was then dependent. A\r\nnew philosophy, based on scientific research, had been gradually gaining\r\nground and penetrating the French mind. A host of bold writers had been\r\ntrying, with considerable firmness and continuity of purpose, to start a\r\nnew kind of fiction, writing in perfect accordance with the determinist\r\ntheories of Auguste Comte, Darwin and Taine. The long-disputed success\r\nof the Naturalistic School carried everything before it during the years\r\n1875-1885, and its triumphant leaders were tempted to make the best of\r\ntheir advantage by annexing a new province and establishing a footing on\r\nthe stage. In this they failed signally, either when they were assisted\r\nby professional dramatists or when left to their own resources. It\r\nbecame evident that Naturalism, to be made acceptable on the stage,\r\nwould have to undergo a special process of transformation and be handled\r\nin a peculiar way. Henry Becque succeeded in embodying the new theories\r\nin two plays, which at first met with very indifferent success, but were\r\nrevived at a later period, and finally obtained permanent recognition in\r\nthe French theatre--even with the acquiescence of the most learned\r\ncritics, when they discovered, or fancied they discovered, that Becque's\r\ncomedies agreed, in the main, with Molière's conception of dramatic art.\r\nIn _Les Corbeaux_ and _La Parisienne_ the plot is very simple; the\r\nepisodes are incidents taken from ordinary life. No extraneous character\r\nis introduced to discuss moral and social theories, or to acquaint us\r\nwith the psychology of the real _dramatis personae_, or to suggest\r\nhumorous observations about the progress of the dramatic action. The\r\ncharacters are left to tell their own tale in their own words, which are\r\nsometimes very comical, sometimes very repulsive, but purport to be\r\nalways true to nature. Human will, which was the soul and mainspring of\r\nFrench tragedy in the 17th century, and played such a paramount part in\r\nthe _drame bourgeois_ and the _haute comédie_ of the 19th, appears in M.\r\nBecque's plays to have fallen from its former exalted position and to\r\nhave ceased to be a free agent. It is a mere passive instrument to our\r\ninner desires and instincts and appetites, which, in their turn, obey\r\nnatural laws. Thus, in Becque's comedies, as in the old Greek drama,\r\ndestiny, not man, is the chief actor, the real but unseen protagonist.\r\n\r\nBecque was not a prolific writer, and when he died, in 1899, it was\r\nremarked that he had spent the last ten years of his life in comparative\r\ninactivity. But during these years his young and ardent disciples had\r\nspared no effort in putting their master's theories to the test. It had\r\noccurred to a gifted and enterprising actor-manager, named André\r\nAntoine, that the time had come for trying dramatic experiments in a\r\ncontinued and methodical manner. For this purpose he gathered around him\r\na number of young authors, and produced their plays before a select\r\naudience of subscribers, who had paid in advance for their\r\nseason-tickets. The entertainment was a strictly private one. In this\r\nway Antoine made himself independent of the censors, and at the same\r\ntime was no longer obliged to consider the requirements of the average\r\nplaygoer, as is the case with ordinary managers, anxious, above all\r\nthings, to secure long runs. At the Théâtre Libre the most successful\r\nplay was not to be performed for more than three nights.\r\n\r\nThe reform attempted was to consist in the elimination of what was\r\ncontrary to nature in Dumas's and Augier's comedies: of the _intrigue\r\nparallèle_ or underplot, of the over-numerous and improbable incidents\r\nwhich followed the first act and taxed the spectator's memory to the\r\nverge of fatigue; and, lastly, of the conventional _dénouement_ for\r\nwhich there was no justification. A true study of character was to take\r\nthe place of Sardou's complicated fabrications and Dumas's problem\r\nplays. The authors would present the spectator with a fragment of life,\r\nbut would force no conclusion upon him at the termination of the play.\r\nThe reformation in histrionic art was to proceed apace. The actors and\r\nactresses of the preceding period had striven to give full effect to\r\ncertain witty utterances of the author, or to preserve and to develop\r\ntheir own personal peculiarities or oddities. Antoine and his\r\nfellow-artists did their best to make the public realize, in every word\r\nand every gesture, the characteristic features and ruling passions of\r\nthe men and women they were supposed to represent.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early autumn of 1887 that the Théâtre Libre opened its\r\ndoors for the first time. It struggled on for eight years amidst\r\nunfailing curiosity, but not without encountering some adverse, or even\r\nderisive, criticism from a considerable portion of the public and the\r\npress. The Théâtre Libre brought under public notice such men as George\r\nCourteline and George Ancey, who gave respectively, in _Bonbouroche_ and\r\n_La Dupe_, specimens of a comic vein called the \"_comique cruel_.\"\r\nFabre, in _L'Argent_, approached if not surpassed his master, Henry\r\nBecque. Brieux, in _Blanchette_, gave promise of talent, which he has\r\nsince in a great measure justified. In _Les Fossiles_ and _L'Envers\r\nd'une sainte_, by François de Curel, were found evidences of dramatic\r\nvigour and concentrated energy, allied with a remarkable gift for the\r\nminute analysis of feeling. Antoine's activity was not exclusively\r\nconfined to the efforts of the French Naturalistic School; he included\r\nthe Norwegian drama in his programme, and successively produced several\r\nof Ibsen's plays. They received a large amount of attention from the\r\ncritics, the views then expressed ranging from the wildest enthusiasm to\r\nthe bitterest irony. Francisque Sarcey was decidedly hostile, and Jules\r\nLemaître, who ranked next to him in authority, ventured to suggest that\r\nIbsen's ideas were nothing better than long-discarded social and\r\nliterary paradoxes, borrowed from Pierre Leroux through George Sand, and\r\nreturned to the French market as novelties. Ibsen was not understood by\r\nthe French public at large, though his influence could be clearly traced\r\non thoughtful men like Paul Hervieu and François de Curel.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Théâtre Libre were sadly wanting in tact and\r\npatience. They went at once to extremes, and, while trying to free\r\nthemselves from an obsolete form of drama, fell into a state of anarchy.\r\nIf a too elaborate plot is a fault, no plot at all is an absurdity. The\r\nold school had been severely taken to task for devoting the first act to\r\nthe delineation of character, and the delineation of character was now\r\nfound to have extended over the whole play; and worse still, most of\r\nthese young men seemed to find pleasure in importing a low vocabulary on\r\nto the stage; they made it their special object to place before the\r\nspectator revolting pictures of the grossest immorality. In this they\r\nwere supported by a knot of noisy and unwise admirers, whose misplaced\r\napproval largely contributed towards bringing an otherwise useful and\r\ninteresting undertaking into disrepute. The result was that after the\r\nlapse of eight years the little group collected round Antoine had lost\r\nin cohesion and spirit, that it was both less hopeful and less compact\r\nthan it had been at the outset of the campaign. But some authors who had\r\nkept aloof from the movement were not slow in reaping the moral and\r\nintellectual profit of these tentative experiments. Among them must be\r\ncited George de Porto-Riche, Henri Lavedan, Paul Hervieu, Maurice Donnay\r\nand Jules Lemaître. Alone among the authors of the Théâtre Libre, É.\r\nBrieux secured an assured position on the regular stage. Instead of\r\nattacking the vices and follies of his times, he has made a name by\r\nsatirizing the weak points or the wrong application of certain\r\nfundamental principles by which modern institutions are supported. He\r\nmocked at universal suffrage in _L'Engrenage_, at art in _Ménages\r\nd'artistes_, at popular instruction in _Blanchette_, at charity in _Les\r\nBienfaiteurs_, at science in _L'Évasion_, and then at law in _La Robe\r\nrouge_. Of _Les Trois Filles de M. Dupont_, one is an old maid with a\r\nstrong bent towards mysticism, another is a star in the demi-monde, and\r\nthe third is married. Neither religion, nor free love, nor marriage has\r\nmade one of the three happy. The strange fact about Brieux is that he\r\npropounds his uncomfortable ideas with an incredible amount of dash and\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nAll the plays written by the above-mentioned authors, and by those who\r\nfollow in their steps, have been said to constitute the \"new comedy.\"\r\nBut one may question the advisability of applying the same name to\r\nliterary works which present so little, if any, family likeness. It was\r\ntacitly agreed to remove the intricacies of the plot and the forced\r\n_dénouement_. But no one will trace in those plays the uniformity of\r\nmoral purpose which would justify us in comprising them under the same\r\nhead, as products of the same school. Then, before the Naturalistic, or\r\nhalf-Naturalistic, School had attained to a practical result or taken a\r\ndefinite shape, a wave of Romanticism swept over the French public, and\r\nin a measure brought back the old artistic and literary dogmas\r\npropounded by Victor Hugo and the generation of 1830. Signs of a revival\r\nin French dramatic poetry were not lacking. The success of _La Fille de\r\nRoland_, by the Vicomte de Bornier, was restricted to the more\r\ncultivated classes, but the vogue of Jean Richepin's _Chemineau_ was at\r\nonce general and lasting. _Cyrano de Bergerac_, produced in the last\r\ndays of 1897, brought a world-wide reputation to its young author,\r\nEdmond Rostand. This play combines sparkling wit and brilliancy of\r\nimagination with delightful touches of pathos and delicate tenderness.\r\nIt was assumed that Rostand was endowed to an extraordinary degree both\r\nwith theatrical genius and the poetic faculty. _L'Aiglon_ fell short of\r\nthis too favourable judgment. It is more a dramatic poem than a real\r\ndrama, and the author handles history with the same childish\r\nincompetence and inaccuracy as Hugo did in _Cromwell_, in _Ruy Blas_ and\r\n_Hernani_. The persistent approbation of the public seemed, however, to\r\nindicate a growing taste for poetry, even when unsupported by dramatic\r\ninterest--a curious symptom among the least poetical of modern European\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the French, as regards the present condition of their drama,\r\nwere confronted with two alternative movements. Naturalism, furthered by\r\nscience and philosophy, was contending against traditions three\r\ncenturies old, and seemed unable to crystallize into masterly works;\r\nwhile romantic drama, founded on vague and exploded theories, had become\r\nembodied in productions of real artistic beauty, which have been warmly\r\nwelcomed by the general playgoer. It should nevertheless be noted that\r\nin _Cyrano_ and _L'Aiglon_ human will, which was the main-spring of\r\nCorneille's tragedy and Hugo's drama, tried to reassert itself, but was\r\nbaffled by circumstance, and had to submit to inexorable laws. This\r\nshowed that the victorious school would have to reckon with the\r\ndoctrines of the defeated party, and suggested that a determinist\r\ntheatre might be the ultimate outcome of a compromise. (A. FI.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) _English Drama._\r\n\r\nAmong the nations of Germanic descent the English alone succeeded,\r\nmainly through the influence of the Renaissance movement, in\r\ntransforming the later growths of the medieval drama into the beginnings\r\nof a great and enduring national dramatic literature, second neither in\r\nvolume nor in splendour to any other in the records of the world. And,\r\nalthough in England, as elsewhere, the preparatory process had been\r\ncontinuing for some generations, its consummation coincided with one of\r\nthe greatest epochs of English national history, and indeed forms one of\r\nthe chief glories of that epoch itself; so that, in thinking or speaking\r\nof the Elizabethan age and the Elizabethan drama, the one can scarcely\r\nbe thought or spoken of without the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Beginnings of the regular drama.\r\n\r\nIt is of course conceivable that the regular drama, or drama proper,\r\nmight in England have been called into life without the direct influence\r\nof classical examples. Already in the reign of Edward VI. the spirit of\r\nthe Reformation had (with the aid of a newly awakened desire for the\r\nstudy of history, which was no doubt largely due to Italian examples)\r\nquickened the relatively inanimate species of the morality into the\r\nbeginning of a new development.[155] But though the _Kyng Johan_ of Bale\r\n(much as this author abhorred the chronicles as written by\r\necclesiastics) came very near to the chronicle histories, there is no\r\nproof whatever that the work, long hidden away for very good reasons,\r\nactually served as a transition to the new species; and Bale's\r\nproduction was entirely unknown to the particular chronicle history\r\nwhich treated the same subject. Before the earliest example of this\r\ntransitional species was produced, English tragedy had directly\r\nconnected its beginnings with classical models.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Imitation of classical examples.\r\n\r\nMuch in the same way, nothing could have been more natural and in\r\naccordance with the previous sluggish evolution of the English drama\r\nthan that a gradual transition, however complete in the end, should have\r\nbeen effected from the moralities to comedy. It was not, however, John\r\nHeywood himself who was to accomplish any such transition; possibly, he\r\nwas himself the author of the morality _Genus humanum_ performed at the\r\ncoronation feast of Queen Mary, whose council speedily forbade the\r\nperformance of interludes without the queen's licence. Nor are we able\r\nto conjecture the nature of the pieces bearing this name composed by\r\nRichard Farrant, afterwards the master of the Children of St George's at\r\nWindsor, or of William Hunnis, master under Queen Elizabeth of the\r\nChildren of the Chapel Royal. But the process of transition is visible\r\nin productions, also called interludes, but charged with serious\r\npurpose, such as T. Ingeland's noteworthy _Disobedient Child_ (before\r\n1560), and plays in which the element of abstractions is perceptibly\r\nyielding to that of real personages, or in which the characters are for\r\nthe most part historical or the main element in the action belongs to\r\nthe sphere of romantic narrative.[156] The demonstration would, however,\r\nbe alien to the purpose of indicating the main conditions of the growth\r\nof the English drama. The immediate origin of the earliest extant\r\nEnglish comedy must, like that of the first English tragedy, be sought,\r\nnot in the development of any popular literary or theatrical\r\nantecedents, but in the imitation, more or less direct, of classical\r\nmodels. This cardinal fact, unmistakable though it is, has frequently\r\nbeen ignored or obscured by writers intent upon investigating the\r\n_origines_ of our drama, and to this day remains without adequate\r\nacknowledgment in most of the literary histories accessible to the great\r\nbody of students.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in tracing the entrance of the drama into the national\r\nliterature there is no reason for seeking to distinguish very narrowly\r\nbetween the several tributaries to the main stream which fertilized this\r\nas well as other fields under Renaissance culture. The universities then\r\nstill remained, and for a time became more prominently than ever, the\r\nleading agents of education in all its existent stages; and it is a\r\npatent fact that no influence could have been so strong upon the\r\nElizabethan dramatists as that to which they had been subjected during\r\nthe university life through which the large majority of them had passed.\r\nThe corporate life of the universities, and the enthusiasms (habitually\r\nunanimous) of their undergraduates and younger graduates, communicated\r\nthis influence, as it were automatically, to the students, and to the\r\nlearned societies themselves, of the Inns of Court. In the Tudor, as\r\nafterwards in the early Stuart, times, these Inns were at once the\r\nseminaries of loyalty, and the obvious resort for the supply of young\r\nmen of spirit desirous of honouring a learned court by contributing to\r\nits choicer amusements. Thus, whether we trace them in the universities,\r\nin the \"bowers\" or halls of the lawyers, or in the palaces of the\r\nsovereign, the beginnings of the English academical drama, which in\r\nlater Elizabethan and Jacobean literature cannot claim to be more than a\r\nsubordinate species of the national drama, in an earlier period served\r\nas the actual link between classical tragedy and comedy and the\r\nsurviving native growths, and supplied the actual impulse towards the\r\nbeginnings of English tragedy and comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The earlier academical drama.\r\n\r\nThe academical drama of the early years of Elizabeth's reign and of the\r\npreceding part of the Tudor period--including the school-drama in the\r\nnarrower sense of the term and other performances of academical\r\norigin--consisted, apart from actual reproductions of classical plays in\r\noriginal Latin or in Latin versions of the Greek, in adaptations of\r\nLatin originals, or of Latin or English plays directly modelled on\r\nclassical examples. A notable series of plays of this kind was performed\r\nin the hall of Christ Church, Oxford, from the first year of Edward VI.\r\nonward, when N. Grimald's _Archipropheta_, treating in classic form the\r\nstory of St John the Baptist, but introducing the Vice and comic scenes,\r\nwas brought out.[157] Others were J. Calfhill's _Progne_ and R.\r\nEdwardes' _Palaemon and Arcyte_ (both 1566), and, from about 1580\r\nonwards, a succession of Latin plays by William Gager, beginning with\r\nthe tragedy _Meleager_, and including, with other tragedies,[158] a\r\ncomedy _Rivales_. Yet another comedy, acted at Christ Church, and\r\nextolled in 1591 by Harington for \"harmless mirth,\" was the _Bellum\r\ngrammaticale_, or Civil War between Nouns and Verbs, which may have been\r\na revision of a comedy written by Bale's friend, R. Radcliff, in 1538,\r\nbut of which in any case the ultimate origin was a celebrated Italian\r\nallegorical treatise.[159] In Cambridge, as is not surprising, the\r\nactivity of the early academical friends and favourers of the drama was\r\neven more marked. At St John's College, where Bishop Watson's Latin\r\ntragedy called _Absolom_ was produced within the years 1534 and 1544,\r\nplays were, according to Ascham, repeatedly performed about the middle\r\nof the century; at Christ's a controversial drama in the Lutheran\r\ninterest called _Pammachius_, of which Gardiner complained to the privy\r\ncouncil, and which seems afterwards to have been translated by Bale, was\r\nacted in 1544; and at Trinity there was a long series of performances\r\nwhich began with Christopherson's _Jephtha_ about 1546, and consisted\r\npartly of reproductions of classical works,[160] partly of plays and\r\n\"shows\" unnamed; while on one occasion at all events, in 1559, \"two\r\nEnglish plays\" were produced. In 1560 was acted, doubtless in the\r\noriginal Latin, and not in Palsgrave's English translation (1540) for\r\nschoolboys, the celebrated \"comedy\" of _Acolastus_, by W. Gnaphaeus, on\r\nthe story of the Prodigal Son. The long series of Trinity plays\r\ninterspersed with occasional plays at King's (where Udall's _Ezechias_\r\nwas produced in English in 1564), at St John's (where T. Legge's\r\n_Richardus III._ was first acted in 1573), and, as will be seen below,\r\nat Christ's, continued, with few noticeable breaks, up to the time when\r\nthe Elizabethan drama was in full activity.[161] Among the \"academical\"\r\nplays not traceable to any particular university source may be\r\nmentioned, as acted at court so early as the end of 1565 or the\r\nbeginning of 1566, the Latin _Sapientia Solomonis_, which generally\r\nfollows the biblical narrative, but introduces a comic element in the\r\nsayings of the popular Marcolph, who here appears as a court fool.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of Seneca.\r\n\r\nIt was under the direct influence of the Renaissance, viewed primarily,\r\nin England as elsewhere, as a revival of classical studies, and in\r\nconnexion with the growing taste in university and cognate circles of\r\nsociety, and at a court which prided itself on its love and patronage of\r\nlearning, that English tragedy and comedy took their actual beginnings.\r\nThose of comedy, as it would seem, preceded those of tragedy by a few\r\nyears. Already in Queen Mary's reign, translation was found the readiest\r\nform of expression offering itself to literary scholarship; and Italian\r\nexamples helped to commend Seneca, the most modern of the ancient\r\ntragedians, and the imitator of the most human among the masters of\r\nAttic tragedy, as a favourite subject for such exercises. In the very\r\nyear of Elizabeth's accession--seven years after Jodelle had brought out\r\nthe earliest French tragedy--a group of English university scholars\r\nbegan to put forth a series of translations of the ten tragedies of\r\nSeneca, which one of them, T. Newton, in 1581 collected into a single\r\nvolume. The earliest of these versions was that of the _Troades_ (1559)\r\nby Jasper Heywood, a son of the author of the _Interludes_. He also\r\npublished the _Thyestes_ (1560) and the _Hercules Furens_ (1561); the\r\nnames of his fellow-translators were A. Neville, T. Nuce, J. Studley and\r\nthe T. Newton aforesaid. These translations, which occasionally include\r\noriginal interpolations (\"additions,\" a term which was to become a\r\ntechnical one in English dramaturgy), are in no instance in blank verse,\r\nthe favourite metre of the dialogue being the couplets of\r\nfourteen-syllable lines best known through Chapman's _Homer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Earliest English tragedies.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Seneca, once established in the English literary world,\r\nmaintained itself there long after English drama had emancipated itself\r\nfrom the task of imitating this pallid model, and, occasionally,\r\nSeneca's own prototype, Euripides.[162] Nor can it be doubted that some\r\ntranslation of the Latin tragic poet had at one time or another passed\r\nthrough Shakespeare's own hands. But what is of present importance is\r\nthat to the direct influence of Seneca is to be ascribed the composition\r\nof the first English tragedy which we possess. Of _Gorboduc_ (afterwards\r\nre-named _Ferrex and Porrex_), first acted on the 18th of January 1562\r\nby the members of the Inner Temple before Queen Elizabeth, the first\r\nthree acts are stated to have been written by T. Norton; the rest of the\r\nplay (if not more) was the work of T. Sackville, afterwards Lord\r\nBuckhurst and earl of Dorset, whom Jasper Heywood praised for his\r\nsonnets, but who is better known for his leading share in The _Mirror\r\nfor Magistrates_. Though the subject of _Gorboduc_ is a British legend,\r\nand though the action is neither copied nor adapted from any treated by\r\nSeneca, yet the resemblance between this tragedy and the _Thebais_ is\r\ntoo strong to be fortuitous. In all formal matters--chorus, messengers,\r\n&c.--_Gorboduc_ adheres to the usage of classical tragedy; but the\r\nauthors show no respect for the unities of time or place. Strong in\r\nconstruction, the tragedy is--like its model, Seneca--weak in\r\ncharacterization. The dialogue, it should be noticed, is in blank verse;\r\nand the device of the _dumb-show_, in which the contents of each act are\r\nin succession set forth in pantomime only, is employed at once to\r\ninstruct and to stimulate the spectator.\r\n\r\nThe nearly contemporary _Apius and Virginia_ (c. 1563), though it takes\r\nits subject--destined to become a perennial one on the modern\r\nstage--from Roman story; the _Historie of Horestes_ (pr. 1567); and T.\r\nPreston's _Cambises King of Percia_ (1569-1570), are somewhat rougher in\r\nform, and, the first and last of them at all events, more violent in\r\ndiction, than _Gorboduc_. They still contain elements of the moralities\r\n(above all the Vice) and none of the formal features of classical\r\ntragedy. But a _Julyus Sesyar_ seems to have been performed, in\r\nprecisely the same circumstances as _Gorboduc_, so early as 1562; and,\r\nfour years later, G. Gascoigne, the author of the satire _The Steele\r\nGlass_, produced with the aid of two associates (F. Kinwelmersh and Sir\r\nChristopher Yelverton, who wrote an epilogue), _Jocasta_, a virtual\r\ntranslation of L. Dolce's _Giocasta_, which was an adaptation, probably,\r\nof R. Winter's Latin translation of the _Phoenissae_ of Euripides.[163]\r\nBetween the years 1567 and 1580 a large proportion of the plays\r\npresented at court by choir- or school-boys, and by various companies of\r\nactors, were taken from Greek legend or Roman history; as was R.\r\nEdwardes' _Damon and Pithias_ (perhaps as early as 1564-1565), which\r\nalready shades off from tragedy into what soon came to be called\r\ntragi-comedy.[164] Simultaneously with the influence, exercised directly\r\nor indirectly, of classical literature, that of Italian, both dramatic\r\nand narrative, with its marked tendency to treat native themes, asserted\r\nitself, and, while diversifying the current of early English tragedy,\r\ninfused into it a long-abiding element of passion. There are sufficient\r\ngrounds for concluding that a play on the subject of _Romeo and Juliet_,\r\nwhich L. da Porto and M. Bandello had treated in prose narrative--that\r\nof the latter having through a French version formed itself into an\r\nEnglish poem--was seen on an English stage in or before 1562. _Gismonde\r\nof Salerne_, a play founded on Boccaccio, was acted before Queen\r\nElizabeth at the Inner Temple in 1568, nearly a generation before it was\r\npublished, rewritten in blank verse by R. Wilmot, one of the performers,\r\nthen in holy orders; G. Whetstone's _Promos and Cassandra_, founded on\r\nG. Cinthio (from which came the plot of _Measure for Measure_),\r\nfollowed, printed in 1578; and there were other \"casts of Italian\r\ndevices\" belonging to this age, in which the choice of a striking theme\r\nstill seemed the chief preoccupation of English tragic poets.\r\n\r\nFrom the double danger which threatened English tragedy in the days of\r\nits infancy--that it would congeal on the wintry heights of classical\r\nthemes, or dissolve its vigour in the glowing heat of a passion fiercer\r\nthan that of the Italians--_Ingleso Italianato è un diavolo\r\nincarnato_--it was preserved more than by any other cause by its happy\r\nassociation with the traditions of the national history. An exceptional\r\nposition might seem to be in this respect occupied by T. Hughes'\r\ninteresting tragedy _The Misfortunes of Arthur_ (1587). But the author\r\nof this play--in certain portions of whose framework there were\r\nassociated with him seven other members of Gray's Inn, including Francis\r\nBacon, and which was presented before Queen Elizabeth like\r\n_Gorboduc_--in truth followed the example of the authors of that work\r\nboth in choice of theme, in details of form, and in a general though far\r\nfrom servile imitation of the manner of Seneca; nor does he represent\r\nany very material advance upon the first English tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chronicle histories.\r\n\r\nFortunately, at the very time when from such beginnings as those just\r\ndescribed the English tragic drama was to set forth upon a course in\r\nwhich it was to achieve so much, a new sphere of activity suggested\r\nitself. And in this, after a few more or less tentative efforts, English\r\ndramatists very speedily came to feel at home. In their direct\r\ndramatization of passages or portions of English history (in which the\r\ndoings and sufferings of King Arthur could only by courtesy or poetic\r\nlicence be included) classical models would be of scant service, while\r\nItalian examples of the treatment of national historical subjects,\r\nhaving to deal with material so wholly different, could not be followed\r\nwith advantage. The native species of the _chronicle history_, which\r\ndesignedly assumed this name in order to make clear its origin and\r\npurpose, essayed nothing more or less than a dramatic version of an\r\nexisting chronicle. Obviously, while the transition from half\r\nhistorical, half epical narrative often implied carrying over into the\r\nnew form some of the features of the old, it was only when the subject\r\nmatter had been remoulded and recast that a true dramatic action could\r\nresult. But the _histories_ to be found among the plays of Shakespeare\r\nand one or two other Elizabethans are true dramas, and it would be\r\ninconvenient to include these in the transitional species of those known\r\nas _chronicle histories_. Among these ruder compositions, which\r\nintermixed the blank verse introduced on the Stage by _Gorboduc_ with\r\nprose, and freely combined or placed side by side tragic and comic\r\ningredients, we have but few distinct examples. One of these is _The\r\nFamous Victories of Henry the Fifth_, known to have been acted before\r\n1588; in which both the verse and the prose are frequently of a very\r\nrude sort, while it is neither divided into acts or scenes nor, in\r\ngeneral, constructed with any measure of dramatic skill. But its vigour\r\nand freshness are considerable, and in many passages we recognize\r\nfamiliar situations and favourite figures in later masterpieces of the\r\nEnglish historical drama. The second is _The Troublesome Raigne of King\r\nJohn_, in two parts (printed in 1591), an epical narrative transferred\r\nto the stage, neither a didactic effort like Bale's, nor a living drama\r\nlike Shakespeare's, but a far from contemptible treatment of its\r\nhistorical theme. _The True Chronicle History of King Leir_ (acted in\r\n1593) in form resembles the above, though it is not properly on a\r\nnational subject (its story is taken from Geoffrey of Monmouth); but,\r\nwith all its defects, it seems only to await the touch of the master's\r\nhand to become a tragedy of supreme effectiveness. A yet further step\r\nwas taken in the _Tragedy of Sir Thomas More_ (c. 1590)--in which\r\nShakespeare's hand has been thought traceable, and which deserves its\r\ndesignation of \"tragedy\" not so much on account of the relative nearness\r\nof the historical subject to the date of its dramatic treatment, as\r\nbecause of the tragic responsibility of character here already clearly\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Earliest comedies.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the beginnings of tragedy in England up to the time when\r\nthe genius of English dramatists was impelled by the spirit that\r\ndominates a great creative epoch of literature to seize the form ready\r\nto their hands. The birth of English comedy, at all times a process of\r\nless labour and eased by an always ready popular responsiveness to the\r\nmost tentative efforts of art, had slightly preceded that of her serious\r\nsister. As has been seen from the brief review given above of the early\r\nhistory of the English academical drama, isolated Latin comedies had\r\nbeen performed in the original or in English versions as early as the\r\nreign of Henry VIII.--perhaps even earlier; while the morality and its\r\ndirect descendant, the interlude, pointed the way towards popular\r\ntreatment in the vernacular of actions and characters equally well\r\nsuited for the diversion of Roman, Italian and English audiences. Thus\r\nthere was no innovation in the adaptation by N. Udal (q.v.) of the\r\n_Miles Gloriosus_ of Plautus under the title of _Ralph Roister Doister_,\r\nwhich may claim to be the earliest extant English comedy. It has a\r\ngenuinely popular vein of humour, and the names fit the characters after\r\na fashion familiar to the moralities. The second English comedy--in the\r\nopinion of at least one high authority our first--is _Misogonus_, which\r\nwas certainly written as early as 1560. Its scene is laid in Italy; but\r\nthe Vice, commonly called \"Cacurgus,\" is both by himself and others\r\nfrequently designated as \"Will Summer,\" in allusion to Henry VIII.'s\r\ncelebrated jester. _Gammer Gurton's Needle_, long regarded as the\r\nearliest of all _English_ comedies, was printed in 1575, as acted \"not\r\nlong ago in Christ's College, Cambridge.\" Its authorship was till\r\nrecently attributed to John Still (afterwards bishop of Bath and Wells),\r\nwho was a resident M.A. at Christ's, when a play was performed there in\r\n1566. But the evidence of his authorship is inconclusive, and the play\r\n\"made by Mr. S., Master of Arts,\" may be by William Stevenson, or by\r\nsome other contemporary. This comedy is slighter in plot and coarser in\r\ndiction than _Ralph Roister Doister_, but by no means unamusing.\r\n\r\nIn the main, however, early English comedy, while occasionally\r\nintroducing characters and scenes of thoroughly native origin and\r\ncomplexion (e.g. Grim, the Collier of Croydon),[165] was content to\r\nborrow its themes from classical or Italian sources.[166] G. Gascoigne's\r\n_Supposes_ (acted at Gray's Inn in 1566) is a translation of _I\r\nSuppositi_ of Ariosto, remarkable for the flowing facility of its\r\nprose. While, on the one hand, the mixture of tragic with comic motives,\r\nwhich was to become so distinctive a feature of the Elizabethan drama,\r\nwas already leading in the direction of tragi-comedy, the precedent of\r\nthe Italian pastoral drama encouraged the introduction of figures and\r\nstories derived from classical mythology; and the rapid and diversified\r\ninfluence of Italian comedy, in close touch with Italian prose fiction,\r\nseemed likely to affect and quicken continuously the growth of the\r\nlighter branch of the English drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conditions of the early Elizabethan drama.\r\n\r\nOut of such promises as these the glories of English drama were ripened\r\nby the warmth and light of the great Elizabethan age--of which the\r\nbeginnings may fairly be reckoned from the third decennium of the reign\r\nto which it owes its name. The queen's steady love of dramatic\r\nentertainments could not of itself have led, though it undoubtedly\r\ncontributed, to such a result. Against the attacks which a nascent\r\npuritanism was already directing against the stage by the hands of J.\r\nNorthbrooke,[167] the repentant playwright S. Gosson,[168] P.\r\nStubbes,[169] and others,[170] were to be set not only the frugal favour\r\nof royalty and the more liberal patronage of great nobles,[171] but the\r\nfact that literary authorities were already weighing the endeavours of\r\nthe English drama in the balance of respectful criticism, and that in\r\nthe abstract at least the claims of both tragedy and comedy were upheld\r\nby those who shrank from the desipience of idle pastimes. It is\r\nnoticeable that this period in the history of the English theatre\r\ncoincides with the beginning of the remarkable series of visits made to\r\nGermany by companies of English comedians, which did not come to an end\r\ntill the period immediately before the Thirty Years' War, and were\r\noccasionally resumed after its close. As at home the popularity of the\r\nstage increased, the functions of playwright and actor, whether combined\r\nor not, began to hold out a reasonable promise of personal gain. Nor,\r\nabove all, was that higher impulse which leads men of talent and genius\r\nto attempt forms of art in harmony with the tastes and tendencies of\r\ntheir times wanting to the group of writers who can be remembered by no\r\nnobler name than that of Shakespeare's predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The predecessors of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe lives of all of these are, of course, in part contemporary with the\r\nlife of Shakespeare himself; nor was there any substantial difference in\r\nthe circumstances under which most of them, and he, led their lives as\r\ndramatic authors. A distinction was manifestly kept up between poets and\r\nplaywrights. Of the contempt entertained for the actor's profession some\r\nfell to the share of the dramatist; \"even Lodge,\" says C. M. Ingleby,\r\n\"who had indeed never trod the stage, but had written several plays, and\r\nhad no reason to be ashamed of his antecedents, speaks of the vocation\r\nof the play-maker as sharing the odium attaching to the actor.\" Among\r\nthe dramatists themselves good fellowship and literary partnership only\r\nat times asserted themselves as stronger than the tendency to mutual\r\njealousy and abuse; of all chapters of dramatic history, the annals of\r\nthe early Elizabethan stage perhaps least resemble those of Arcadia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  History of the Elizabethan stage.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the theatre had hardly found its strength as a powerful\r\nelement in the national life, when it was involved in a bitter\r\ncontroversy, with which it had originally no connexion, on behalf of an\r\nally whose sympathy with it can only have been of a very limited kind.\r\nThe Marprelate controversy, into which, among leading playwrights, Lyly\r\nand Nashe were drawn, in 1589 led to a stoppage of stage-plays which\r\nproved only temporary; but the general result of the attempt to make the\r\nstage a vehicle of political abuse and invective was beyond a doubt to\r\ncoarsen and degrade both plays and players. Scurrilous attempts and\r\nrough repression continued during the years 1590-1593; and the true\r\nremedy was at last applied, when from about 1594, the chief London\r\nactors became divided into two great rival companies--the lord\r\nchamberlain's and the lord admiral's--which alone received licences.\r\nInstead of half a dozen or more companies whose jealousies communicated\r\nthemselves to the playwrights belonging to them, there were now, besides\r\nthe Children of the Chapel, two established bodies of actors, directed\r\nby steady and, in the full sense of the word, respectable men. To the\r\nlord chamberlain's company, which, after being settled at \"the Theater\"\r\n(opened as early as 1576 or 1577), moved to Blackfriars, purchased by\r\nJames Burbage, in 1596, and to the Globe on the Bankside in 1599,\r\nShakespeare and Richard Burbage, the greatest of the Elizabethan actors,\r\nbelonged; the lord admiral's was managed by Philip Henslowe, the author\r\nof the _Diary_, and Edward Alleyn, the founder of Dulwich College, and\r\nwas ultimately, in 1600, settled at the Fortune. In these and other\r\nhouses were performed the plays of the Elizabethan dramatists, with few\r\nadventitious aids, the performance being crowded into a brief afternoon,\r\nwhen it is obvious that only the idler sections of the population could\r\nattend. No woman might appear at a playhouse, unless masked; on the\r\nstage, down to the Restoration, women's parts continued to be acted by\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nIt is futile to take no account of such outward circumstances as these\r\nand many which cannot here be noted in surveying the progress of the\r\nliterature of the Elizabethan drama. Like that of the Restoration--and\r\nlike that of the present day--it was necessarily influenced in its\r\nmethod and spirit of treatment by the conditions and restrictions which\r\ngoverned the place and circumstances of the performance of plays,\r\nincluding the construction of theatre and stage, as well as by the\r\nsocial composition of its audiences, which the local accommodation, not\r\nless than the entertainment, provided for them had to take into account.\r\nBut to these things a mere allusion must suffice. It may safely be said,\r\nat the same time, that no dramatic literature which has any claim to\r\nrank beside the Elizabethan--not that of Athens nor those of modern\r\nItaly and Spain, nor those of France and Germany in their classic\r\nperiods--had to contend against such odds; a mighty inherent strength\r\nalone ensured to it the vitality which it so triumphantly asserted, and\r\nwhich enabled it to run so unequalled a course.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lyly.\r\n\r\n  Kyd.\r\n\r\n  Marlowe.\r\n\r\n  Peele.\r\n\r\n  Greene.\r\n\r\nAmong Shakespeare's predecessors, John Lyly, whose plays were all\r\nwritten for the Children of the Chapel and the Children of St Paul's,\r\nholds a position apart in English dramatic literature. The euphuism, to\r\nwhich his famous romance gave its name, likewise distinguishes his\r\nmythological,[172] quasi-historical,[173] allegorical,[174] and\r\nsatirical[175] comedies. But his real service to the progress of English\r\ndrama is to be sought neither in his choice of subjects nor in his\r\nimagery--though to his fondness for fairylore and for the whole\r\nphantasmagoria of legend, classical as well as romantic, his\r\ncontemporaries, and Shakespeare in particular, were indebted for a\r\nstimulative precedent, and though in his _Endimion_ at all events he\r\nexcites curiosity by an allegorical treatment of contemporary characters\r\nand events. It does not even lie in the songs interspersed in his plays,\r\nthough none of his predecessors had in the slightest degree anticipated\r\nthe lyric grace which distinguishes some of these incidental efforts. It\r\nconsists in his adoption of Gascoigne's innovation of writing plays in\r\nprose; and in his having, though under the fetters of an affected and\r\npretentious style, given the first example of brisk and vivacious\r\ndialogue--an example to which even such successors as Shakespeare and\r\nJonson were indebted. Thomas Kyd, the author of the _Spanish Tragedy_\r\n(preceded or followed by the first part of _Jeronimo_), and probably of\r\nseveral plays whose author was unnamed, possesses some of the\r\ncharacteristics, but none of the genius, of the greatest tragic\r\ndramatist who preceded Shakespeare. No slighter tribute than this is\r\nassuredly the due of Christopher Marlowe, whose violent end prematurely\r\nclosed a poetic career of dazzling brilliancy. His earliest play,\r\n_Tamburlaine the Great_, in which the use of blank verse was introduced\r\nupon the English public stage, while full of the \"high astounding terms\"\r\nof an extravagant and often bombastic diction, is already marked by the\r\npassion which was the poet's most characteristic feature, and which was\r\nto find expression so luxuriantly beautiful in his _Doctor Faustus,_ and\r\nso surpassingly violent in his _Jew of Malta_. His masterpiece, _Edward\r\nII._, is a tragedy of singular pathos and of a dramatic power\r\nunapproached by any of his contemporaries. George Peele was a far more\r\nversatile writer even as a dramatist; but, though his plays contain\r\npassages of exquisite beauty, not one of them is worthy to be ranked by\r\nthe side of Marlowe's _Edward II._, compared with which, if indeed not\r\nabsolutely, Peele's _Chronicle of Edward I._ still stands on the level\r\nof the species to which its title and character alike assign it. His\r\nfinest play is undoubtedly _David and Bethsabe_, which resembles _Edward\r\nI._ in construction, but far surpasses it in beauty of language and\r\nversification, besides treating its subject with greatly superior\r\ndignity. If the difference between Peele and Shakespeare is still, in\r\nmany respects besides that of genius, an immeasurable one, we seem to\r\ncome into something like a Shakespearian atmosphere in more than one\r\npassage of the plays of the unfortunate Robert Greene--unfortunate\r\nperhaps in nothing more enduringly than in the proof which he left\r\nbehind him of his supercilious jealousy of Shakespeare. Greene's genius,\r\nmost conspicuous in plays treating English life and scenes, could,\r\nnotwithstanding his academic self-sufficiency, at times free itself from\r\nthe pedantry apt to beset the flight of Peele's and at times even of\r\nMarlowe's muse; and his most delightful work[176] seems to breathe\r\nsomething of the air, sweet and fresh like no other, which blows over an\r\nEnglish countryside. Thomas Lodge, whose dramatic, and much less of\r\ncourse his literary activity, is measured by the only play that we know\r\nto have been wholly his;[177] Thomas Nashe, the redoubtable pamphleteer\r\nand the father of the English picaresque novel;[178] Henry Chettle, who\r\nworked the chords of both pity[179] and terror[180] with equal vigour,\r\nand Anthony Munday, better remembered for his city pageants than for his\r\nplays, are among the other more important writers of the early\r\nElizabethan drama, though not all of them can strictly speaking be\r\ncalled predecessors of Shakespeare. It is not possible here to enumerate\r\nthe more interesting of the anonymous plays which belong to this\r\n\"pre-Shakespearian\" period of the Elizabethan drama; but many of them\r\nare by intrinsic merit as well as for special causes deserving of the\r\nattention of the student.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Common characteristics of the early Elizabethans.\r\n\r\nThe common characteristics of nearly all these dramatists and plays were\r\nin accordance with those of the great age to which they belonged.\r\nStirring times called for stirring themes, such as those of \"Mahomet,\r\nScipio and Tamerlane\"; and these again for a corresponding vigour of\r\ntreatment. Neatness and symmetry of construction were neglected for\r\nfulness and variety of matter. Novelty and grandeur of subject seemed\r\nwell matched by a swelling amplitude and often reckless extravagance of\r\ndiction. As if from an inner necessity, the balance of rhymed couplets\r\ngave way to the impetuous march of blank verse; \"strong lines\" were as\r\ninevitably called for as strong situations and strong characters.\r\nAlthough the chief of these poets are marked off from one another by the\r\nindividual genius which impressed itself upon both the form and the\r\nmatter of their works, yet the stamp of the age is upon them all.\r\nWriting for the stage only, of which some of them possessed a personal\r\nexperience and from which none of them held aloof, they acquired an\r\ninstinctive insight into the laws of dramatic cause and effect, and\r\ninfused a warm vitality into the dramatic literature which they\r\nproduced, so to speak, for immediate consumption. On the other hand, the\r\nsame cause made rapidity of workmanship indispensable to a successful\r\nplaywright. _How_ a play was produced, how many hands had been at work\r\nupon it, what loans and what spoliations had been made in the process,\r\nwere considerations of less moment than the question _whether_ it was\r\nproduced, and whether it succeeded. His harness--frequently double or\r\ntriple--was inseparable from the lusty Pegasus of the early English\r\ndrama, and its genius toiled, to borrow the phrase of the Attic\r\ncomedian, \"like an Arcadian mercenary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Progress of tragedy and comedy before Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThis period of the English drama, though it is far from being one of\r\ncrude effort, could not therefore yet be one of full consummation. In\r\ntragedy the advance which had been made in the choice of great themes,\r\nin knitting closer the connection between the theatre and the national\r\nhistory, in vindicating to passion its right to adequate expression, was\r\nalready enormous. In comedy the advance had been less decisive and less\r\nindependent; much had been gained in reaching greater freedom of form\r\nand something in enlarging the range of subjects; but artificiality had\r\nproved a snare in the one direction, while the licence of the comic\r\nstage, upheld by favourite \"clowns,\" such as Kemp or Tarlton, had not\r\nsuccumbed before less elastic demands. The way of escaping from the\r\ndilemma had, however, been already recognized to lie in the construction\r\nof suitable plots, for which a full storehouse was open in the popular\r\ntraditions preserved in national ballads, and in the growing literature\r\nof translated foreign fiction, or of native imitations of it. Meanwhile,\r\nthe aberration of the comic stage to political and religious\r\ncontroversy, which it could never hope to treat with Attic freedom in a\r\ncountry provided with a strong monarchy and a dogmatic religion, seemed\r\nlikely to extinguish the promise of the beginnings of English romantic\r\ncomedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThese were the circumstances under which the greatest of dramatists\r\nbegan to devote his genius to the theatre. Shakespeare's career as a\r\nwriter of plays can have differed little in its beginnings from those of\r\nhis contemporaries and rivals. Before or while he was proceeding from\r\nthe re-touching and re-writing of the plays of others to original\r\ndramatic composition, the most gifted of those whom we have termed his\r\npredecessors had passed away. He had been decried as an actor before he\r\nwas known as an author; and after living through days of darkness for\r\nthe theatre, if not for himself, attained, before the close of the\r\ncentury, to the beginnings of his prosperity and the beginnings of his\r\nfame. But if we call him fortunate, it is not because of such rewards as\r\nthese. As a poet, Shakespeare was no doubt happy in his times, which\r\nintensified the strength of the national character, expanded the\r\nactivities of the national mind, and were able to add their stimulus\r\neven to such a creative power as his. He was happy in the antecedents of\r\nthe form of literature which commended itself to his choice, and in the\r\nopportunities which it offered in so many directions for an advance to\r\nheights yet undiscovered and unknown. What he actually accomplished was\r\ndue to his genius, whose achievements are immeasurable like itself. His\r\ninfluence upon the progress of English drama divides itself in very\r\nunequal proportions into a direct and an indirect influence. To the\r\nformer alone reference can here be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Shakespeare and the national historical drama.\r\n\r\nAlready the first editors of Shakespeare's works in a collected form\r\nrecognized so marked a distinction between his plays taken from English\r\nhistory and those treating other historical subjects (whether ancient or\r\nmodern) that, while they included the latter among the tragedies at\r\nlarge, they grouped the former as _histories_ by themselves. These\r\n_histories_ are in their literary genesis a development of the\r\n_chronicle histories_ of Shakespeare's predecessors and contemporaries,\r\nthe taste for which had greatly increased towards the beginning of his\r\nown career as a dramatist, in accordance with the general progress of\r\nnational life and sentiment in this epoch. Though it cannot be assumed\r\nthat Shakespeare composed his several dramas from English history in the\r\nsequence of the chronology of their themes, his genius gave to the\r\nentire series an inner harmony, and a continuity corresponding to that\r\nwhich is distinctive of the national life, such as not unnaturally\r\ninspired certain commentators with the wish to prove it a symmetrically\r\nconstructed whole. He thus brought this peculiarly national species to a\r\nperfection which made it difficult, if not impossible, for his later\r\ncontemporaries and successors to make more than an occasional addition\r\nto his series. None of them was, however, found able or ready to take up\r\nthe thread where Shakespeare had left it, after perfunctorily attaching\r\nthe present to the past by a work (probably not all his own) which must\r\nbe regarded as the end rather than the crown of the series of his\r\n_histories_.[181] But to furnish such supplements accorded little with\r\nthe tastes and tendencies of the later Elizabethans; and with the\r\nexception of an isolated work,[182] the national historical drama in\r\nShakespeare reached at once its perfection and its close. The ruder form\r\nof the old chronicle history for a time survived the advance made upon\r\nit; but the efforts in this field of T. Heywood,[183] S. Rowley,[184]\r\nand others are, from a literary point of view, anachronisms.\r\n\r\nOf Shakespeare's other plays the several groups exercised a more direct\r\ninfluence upon the general progress of our dramatic literature. His\r\nRoman tragedies, though following their authorities with much the same\r\nfidelity as that of the English _histories_, even more effectively\r\ntaught the great lesson of free dramatic treatment of historic themes,\r\nand thus pre-eminently became the perennial models of the modern\r\nhistoric drama. His tragedies on other subjects, which necessarily\r\nadmitted of a more absolute freedom of treatment, established themselves\r\nas the examples for all time of the highest kind of tragedy. Where else\r\nis exhibited with the same fulness the struggle between will and\r\nobstacle, character and circumstance? Where is mirrored with equal power\r\nand variety the working of those passions in the mastery of which over\r\nman lies his doom? Here, above all, Shakespeare as compared with his\r\npredecessors, as well as with his successors, \"_is_ that nature which\r\nthey paint and draw.\" He threw open to modern tragedy a range of\r\nhitherto unknown breadth and depth and height, and emancipated the\r\nnational drama in its noblest forms from limits to which it could never\r\nagain restrict itself without a consciousness of having renounced its\r\nenfranchisement. Happily for the variety of his creative genius on the\r\nEnglish stage, no divorce had been proclaimed between the serious and\r\nthe comic, and no division of species had been established such as he\r\nhimself ridicules as pedantic when it professes to be exhaustive. The\r\ncomedies of Shakespeare accordingly refuse to be tabulated in deference\r\nto any method of classification deserving to be called precise; and\r\nseveral of them are comedies only according to a purely technical use of\r\nthe term. In those in which the instinct of reader or spectator\r\nrecognizes the comic interest to be supreme, it is still of its nature\r\nincidental to the progress of the action; for the criticism seems just,\r\nas well as in agreement with what we can conclude as to Shakespeare's\r\nprocess of construction, that among all his comedies not more than a\r\nsingle one[185] is in both design and effect a comedy of character\r\nproper. Thus in this direction, while the unparalleled wealth of his\r\ninvention renewed or created a whole gallery of types, he left much to\r\nbe done by his successors; while the truest secrets of his comic art,\r\nwhich interweaves fancy with observation, draws wisdom from the lips of\r\nfools, and imbues with character what all other hands would have left\r\nshadowy, monstrous or trivial, are among the things inimitable belonging\r\nto the individuality of his poetic genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n  His style and its influence.\r\n\r\nThe influences of Shakespeare's diction and versification upon those of\r\nthe English drama in general can hardly be overrated, though it would be\r\nnext to impossible to state them definitely. In these points,\r\nShakespeare's manner as a writer was progressive; and this progress has\r\nbeen deemed sufficiently well traceable in his plays to be used as an\r\naid in seeking to determine their chronological sequence. The general\r\nlaws of this progress accord with those of the natural advance of\r\ncreative genius; artificiality gives way to freedom, and freedom in its\r\nturn submits to a greater degree of regularity and care. In\r\nversification as in diction the earliest and the latest period of\r\nShakespeare's dramatic writing are more easily recognizable than what\r\nlies between and may be called the _normal_ period, the plays belonging\r\nto which in form most resemble one another, and are least affected by\r\ndistinguishable peculiarities--such as the rhymes and intentionally\r\neuphuistic colouring of style which characterize the earliest, or the\r\nfeminine endings of the lines and the more condensed manner of\r\nexpression common to the latest of his plays. But, such distinctions\r\napart, there can be no doubt but that in verse and in prose alike,\r\nShakespeare's style, so far as it admitted of reproduction, is itself to\r\nbe regarded as the _norm_ of that of the Elizabethan drama; that in it\r\nthe prose form of English comedy possesses its first accepted model; and\r\nthat in it the chosen metre of the English versified drama established\r\nitself as irremovable unless at the risk of an artificial experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of his method of construction.\r\n\r\nThe assertion may seem paradoxical, that it is by their construction\r\nthat Shakespeare's plays exerted the most palpable influence upon the\r\nEnglish drama, as well as upon the modern drama of the Germanic nations\r\nin general, and upon such forms of the Romance drama as have been in\r\nmore recent times based upon it. For it was not in construction that his\r\ngreatest strength lay, or that the individuality of his genius could\r\nraise him above the conditions under which he worked in common with his\r\nimmediate predecessors and contemporaries. Yet the fact that he accepted\r\nthese conditions, while producing works of matchless strength and of\r\nunequalled fidelity to the demands of nature and art, established them\r\nas inseparable from the Shakespearian drama--to use a term which is\r\nperhaps unavoidable but has been often misapplied. The great and\r\nirresistible demand on the part of Shakespeare's public was for\r\n_incident_--a demand which of itself necessitated a method of\r\nconstruction different from that of the Greek drama, or of those\r\nmodelled more or less closely upon it. To no other reason is to be\r\nascribed the circumstance that Shakespeare so constantly combined two\r\nactions in the course of a single play, not merely supplementing the one\r\nby means of the other as a bye- or under-plot. In no respect is the\r\nprogress of his technical skill as a dramatist more apparent,--a\r\nproposition which a comparison of plays clearly ascribable to successive\r\nperiods of his life must be left to prove.\r\n\r\n\r\n  His characters.\r\n\r\nShould it, however, be sought to express in one word the greatest debt of\r\nthe drama to Shakespeare, this word must be the same as that which\r\nexpresses his supreme gift as a dramatist. It is in _characterization_--in\r\nthe drawing of characters ranging through almost every type of humanity\r\nwhich furnishes a fit subject for the tragic or the comic art--that he\r\nremains absolutely unapproached; and it was in this direction that he\r\npointed the way which the English drama could not henceforth desert\r\nwithout becoming untrue to itself. It may have been a mere error of\r\njudgment which afterwards held him to have been surpassed by others in\r\nparticular fields of characterization (setting him down, forsooth, as\r\nsupremely excellent in male, but not in female, characters). But it was a\r\nsure sign of decay when English writers began to shrink from following him\r\nin the endeavour to make the drama a mirror of humanity, and when, in\r\nself-condemned arrogance, they thrust unreality back upon a stage which he\r\nhad animated with the warm breath of life, where Juliet had blossomed like\r\na flower of spring, and where Othello's noble nature had suffered and\r\nsinned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Forms of the later Elizabethan drama.\r\n\r\n  The pastoral drama.\r\n\r\nBy the numerous body of poets who, contemporary with Shakespeare or in\r\nthe next generation, cultivated the wide field of the national drama,\r\nevery form commending itself to the tastes and sympathies of the\r\nnational genius was essayed. None were neglected except those from which\r\nthe spirit of English literature had been estranged by the Reformation,\r\nand those which had from the first been artificial importations of the\r\nRenaissance. The mystery could not in England, as in Spain, produce such\r\nan aftergrowth as the _auto_, and the confines of the religious drama\r\nwere only now and then tentatively touched.[186] The direct imitations\r\nof classical examples were, except perhaps in the continued efforts of\r\nthe academical drama, few and feeble. Chapman, while resorting to use of\r\nnarrative in tragedy and perhaps otherwise indebted to ancient models,\r\nwas no follower of them in essentials. S. Daniel (1562-1619) may be\r\nregarded as a belated disciple of Seneca,[187] while experiments like W.\r\nAlexander's (afterwards earl of Stirling) _Monarchicke Tragedies_[188]\r\n(1603-1605) are the mere isolated efforts of a student, and more\r\nexclusively so than Milton's imposing _Samson Agonistes_, which belongs\r\nto a later date (1677). At the opposite end of the dramatic scale, the\r\nlight gaiety of the Italian and French farce could not establish itself\r\non the English popular stage without more substantial adjuncts; the\r\nEnglishman's festive digestion long continued robust, and he liked his\r\namusements solid. In the pastoral drama and the mask, however, many\r\nEnglish dramatists found special opportunities for the exercise of their\r\nlyrical gifts and of their inventive powers. The former could never\r\nbecome other than an exotic, so long as it retained the artificial\r\ncharacter of its origin. Shakespeare had accordingly only blended\r\nelements derived from it into the action of his romantic comedies. In\r\nmore or less isolated works Jonson, Fletcher, Daniel, Randolph, and\r\nothers sought to rival Tasso and Guarini--Jonson[189] coming nearest to\r\nnationalizing an essentially foreign growth by the fresh simplicity of\r\nhis treatment, Fletcher[190] bearing away the palm for beauty of poetic\r\nexecution; Daniel being distinguished by simpler beauties of style in\r\nboth verse and prose.[191]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The mask.\r\n\r\nThe mask (or masque) was a more elastic kind of composition, mixing in\r\nvarying proportions its constituent elements of declamation and\r\ndialogue, music and dancing, decoration and scenery. In its least\r\nelaborate literary form--which, of course, externally was the most\r\nelaborate--it closely approached the pageant; in other instances the\r\ndistinctness of its characters or the fulness of the action introduced\r\ninto its scheme, brought it nearer to the regular drama. A frequent\r\nornament of Queen Elizabeth's progresses, it was cultivated with\r\nincreased assiduity in the reign of James I., and in that of his\r\nsuccessor outshone, by the favour it enjoyed with court and nobility,\r\nthe attractions of the regular drama itself. Most of the later\r\nElizabethan dramatists contributed to this species, upon which\r\nShakespeare expended the resources of his fancy only incidentally in the\r\ncourse of his dramas; but by far the most successful writer of masks was\r\nBen Jonson, of whose numerous compositions of this kind many hold a\r\npermanent place in English poetic literature, and \"next\" whom, in his\r\nown judgment, \"only Fletcher and Chapman could write a mask.\" From a\r\npoetic point of view, however, they were at least rivalled by Dekker and\r\nFord; in productivity and favour T. Campion, who was equally eminent as\r\npoet and as musician, seems for a time to have excelled. Inasmuch,\r\nhowever, as the history of the mask in England is to a great extent that\r\nof \"painting and carpentry\" and of Inigo Jones, and as, moreover, this\r\nkind of piece, while admitting dramatic elements, is of its nature\r\noccasional, it need not further be pursued here. The _Microcosmus_ of T.\r\nNabbes (printed 1637), which is very like a morality, seems to have been\r\nthe first mask brought upon the public stage. It was the performance of\r\na mask by Queen Henrietta Maria and her ladies at Whitehall which had\r\nsome years previously (1632) been thought to have supplied to the\r\ninvective of _Histrio-Mastix_ against the stage the occasion for\r\ndisloyal innuendo; and it was for the performance of a mask in a great\r\nnobleman's castle that Milton--a Puritan of a very different cast--not\r\nlong afterwards (1634) wrote one of the loftiest and loveliest of\r\nEnglish poems. _Comus_ has been judged and condemned as a\r\ndrama--unjustly, for the dramatic qualities of a mask are not essential\r\nto it as a species. Yet its history in England remains inseparably\r\nconnected with that of the Elizabethan drama. In later times the mask\r\nmerged into the opera, or continued a humble life of its own apart from\r\ncontact with higher literary effort. It is strange that later English\r\npoets should have done so little to restore to its nobler uses, and to\r\ninvest with a new significance, a form so capable of further development\r\nas the poetic mask.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The later Elizabethan drama.\r\n\r\nThe annals of English drama proper in the period reaching from the\r\nclosing years of Elizabeth to the outbreak of the great Revolution\r\ninclude, together with numerous names relatively insignificant, many\r\nillustrious in the history of our poetic literature. Among Shakespeare's\r\ncontemporaries and successors there is, however, but one who by the\r\nenergy of his genius, not less than by the circumstances of his literary\r\ncareer, reached undisputed primacy among his fellows. Ben Jonson, to\r\nwhom in his latter days a whole generation of younger writers did filial\r\nhomage as to their veteran chief, was alone in full truth the founder of\r\na school or family of dramatists. Yet his pre-eminence did not (whatever\r\nhe or his followers may have thought) extend to both branches of the\r\nregular drama. In tragedy he fell short of the highest success; the\r\nweight of his learning lay too heavily upon his efforts to draw from\r\ndeeper sources than those which had sufficed for Shakespeare. Such as\r\nthey are, his tragic works[192] stand almost, though not quite, alone in\r\nthis period as examples of sustained effort in historic tragedy proper.\r\nG. Chapman treated stirring themes, more especially from modern French\r\nhistory,[193] always with vigour, and at times with genuine\r\neffectiveness; but, though rich in beauties of detail, he failed in this\r\nbranch of the drama to follow Shakespeare even at a distance in the\r\nsupreme art of fully developing a character by means of the action.\r\nMention has been made above of Ford's isolated effort in the direction\r\nof historic tragedy, as well as of excursions into the still popular\r\ndomain of the chronicle history by T. Heywood, Dekker and others, which\r\ncannot be regarded as anything more than retrogressions. With the great\r\nbody of the English dramatists of this and of the next period, tragedy\r\nhad passed into a phase where its interest depended mainly upon plot and\r\nincident. The romantic tragedies and tragi-comedies which crowd English\r\nliterature in this period constitute together a growth of at first sight\r\nastonishing exuberance, and in mere externals of theme--ranging as these\r\nplays do from Byzantium to ancient Britain, and from the Caesars of\r\nancient Rome to the tyrants of the Renaissance--of equally astonishing\r\nvariety. The sources from which these subjects were derived had been\r\nperennially augmenting. Besides Italian, Spanish and French fiction,\r\noriginal or translated, besides British legend in its Romance dress, and\r\nEnglish fiction in its humbler or in its more ambitious and artificial\r\nforms, the contemporary foreign drama, especially the Spanish, offered\r\nopportunities for resort. To the English, as to the French and Italian\r\ndrama, of both this and the following century, the prolific dramatists\r\nclustering round Lope de Vega and Calderon, and the native or\r\nnaturalized fictions from which they drew their materials supplied a\r\nwhole arsenal of plots, incidents and situations--among others to\r\nMiddleton, to Webster, and most signally to Beaumont and Fletcher. And,\r\nin addition to these resources, a new field of supply was at hand since\r\nEnglish dramatists had begun to regard events and episodes of domestic\r\nlife as fit subjects for tragic treatment. Domestic tragedy of this\r\ndescription was indeed no novelty on the English stage; Shakespeare\r\nhimself may have retouched with his master-hand more than one effort of\r\nthis kind;[194] but T. Heywood may be set down as the first who achieved\r\nany work of considerable literary value of this class,[195] to which\r\nsome of the plays of T. Dekker, T. Middleton, and others likewise more\r\nor less belong. Yet, in contrast to this wide variety of sources, and\r\nconsequent apparent variety of themes, the number of _motives_\r\nemployed--at least as a rule--in the tragic drama of this period was\r\ncomparatively small and limited. Hence it is that, notwithstanding the\r\ndiversity of subjects among the tragic dramas of such writers as\r\nMarston, Webster, Fletcher, Ford and Shirley, an impression of sameness\r\nis left upon us by a connected perusal of these works. Scheming\r\nambition, conjugal jealousy, absolute female devotion, unbridled\r\nmasculine passion--such are the motives which constantly recur in the\r\nDecameron of our later Elizabethan drama. And this impression is\r\nheightened by the want of moderation, by the extravagance of passion,\r\nwhich these dramatists so habitually exhibit in the treatment of their\r\nfavourite themes. All the tragic poets of this period are not equally\r\namenable to this charge; in J. Webster,[196] master as he is of the\r\neffects of the horrible, and in J. Ford,[197] surpassingly seductive in\r\nhis sweetness, the monotony of exaggerated passion is broken by those\r\nmarvellously sudden and subtle touches through which their tragic genius\r\ncreates its most thrilling effects. Nor will the tendency to excess of\r\npassion which F. Beaumont and J. Fletcher undoubtedly exhibit be\r\nconfounded with their distinctive power of sustaining tenderly pathetic\r\ncharacters and irresistibly moving situations in a degree unequalled by\r\nany of their contemporaries--a power seconded by a beauty of diction and\r\nsoftness of versification which for a time raised them to the highest\r\npinnacle of popular esteem, and which entitles them in their\r\nconjunction, and Fletcher as an independent worker, to an enduring\r\npre-eminence among their fellows. In their morals Beaumont and Fletcher\r\nare not above the level of their age. The manliness of sentiment and\r\noccasionally greater width of outlook which ennoble the rhetorical\r\ngenius of P. Massinger, and the gift of poetic illustration which\r\nentitles J. Shirley to be remembered not merely as the latest and the\r\nmost fertile of this group of dramatists, have less direct bearing upon\r\nthe general character of the tragic art of the period. The common\r\nfeatures of the romantic tragedy of this age are sufficiently marked;\r\nbut they leave unobscured the distinctive features in its individual\r\nwriters of which a discerning criticism has been able to take note.\r\n\r\nIn comedy, on the other hand, the genius and the insight of Jonson\r\npointed the way to a steady and legitimate advance. His theory of\r\n\"humours\" (which found the most palpable expression in two of his\r\nearliest plays[198]), if translated into the ordinary language of\r\ndramatic art, signifies the paramount importance in the comic drama of\r\nthe presentation of distinctive human types. As such it survived by name\r\ninto the Restoration age[199] and cannot be said to have ever died out.\r\nIn the actual reproduction of humanity in its infinite but never, in his\r\nhands, alien variety, it was impossible that Shakespeare should be\r\nexcelled by Jonson; but in the consciousness with which he recognized\r\nand indicated the highest sphere of a comic dramatist's labours, he\r\nrendered to the drama a direct service which the greater master had left\r\nunperformed. By the rest of his contemporaries and his successors, some\r\nof whom, such as R. Brome, were content avowedly to follow in his\r\nfootsteps, Jonson was only occasionally rivalled in individual instances\r\nof comic creations; in the entirety of its achievements his genius as a\r\ncomic dramatist remained unapproached. The favourite types of Jonsonian\r\ncomedy, to which Dekker, J. Marston and Chapman had, though to no large\r\nextent, added others of their own, were elaborated with incessant zeal\r\nand remarkable effect by their contemporaries and successors. It was\r\nafter a very different fashion from that in which the Roman comedians\r\nreiterated the ordinary types of the New Attic comedy, that the\r\ninexhaustible _verve_ of T. Middleton, the buoyant productivity of\r\nFletcher, the observant humour of N. Field, and the artistic\r\nversatility of Shirley--not to mention many later and not necessarily\r\nminor names[200]--mirrored in innumerable pictures of contemporary life\r\nthe undying follies and foibles of mankind. As comedians of manners more\r\nthan one of these surpassed the old master, not indeed in distinctness\r\nand correctness--the fruits of the most painstaking genius that ever\r\nfitted a learned sock to the representation of the living realities of\r\nlife--but in a lightness not incompatible with sureness of touch; while\r\nin the construction of plots the access of abundant new materials, and\r\nthe greater elasticity in treatment resulting from accumulated\r\nexperience, enabled them to advance from success to success. Thus the\r\ncomic dramatic literature from Jonson to Shirley is unsurpassed as a\r\ncomedy of manners, while as a comedy of character it at least defies\r\ncomparison with any other national literary growth preceding or\r\ncontemporaneous with it. Though the younger generation, of which W.\r\nCartwright may be taken as an example, was unequal in originality or\r\nforce to its predecessors, yet so little exhausted was the vitality of\r\nthe species, that its traditions survived the _interregnum_ of the\r\nRevolution, and connected themselves more closely than is sometimes\r\nassumed with later growths of English comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The later academical drama.\r\n\r\nSuch was also the case with a special growth which had continued side by\r\nside, but in growing frequency of contact, with the progress of the\r\nnational drama. The academical drama of the later Elizabethan period and\r\nof the first two Stuart reigns by no means fell off either in activity\r\nor in variety from that of the preceding generations. At Oxford, after\r\nan apparent break of several years--though in the course of these one or\r\ntwo new plays, including a _Tancred_ by Sir Henry Wotton at Queen's,\r\nseem to have been produced--a long succession of English plays, some in\r\nLatin doubtless from time to time intervening, were performed, from the\r\nearly years of the 17th century onwards to the dark days of the national\r\ntheatre and beyond. The production of these plays was distributed among\r\nseveral colleges, among which the most conspicuously active were Christ\r\nChurch and St John's, where a whole series of festal performances took\r\nplace under the collective title of _The Christmas Prince_ (i.e. master\r\nof the Christmas revels). They included a wide variety of pieces, from\r\nthe treatment by an author unnamed of the story of \"Ovid's owne\r\nNarcissus\" (1602) and S. Daniel's _Queen's Arcadia_ (1606) to Barten\r\nHoliday's _Technogamia_ (1618), a complicated allegory on the relations\r\nbetween the arts and sciences quite in the manner of the moralities;\r\ninterspersed by romantic dramas of the ordinary contemporary type by T.\r\nGoffe (1591-1629), W. Cartwright, J. Maine (1604-1672) and others. At\r\nCambridge the list of Latin and English academical plays, performed in\r\nthe latter half of Elizabeth's reign at Trinity, St John's, Queen's and\r\na few other colleges, contains several examples in each language which\r\nfor one reason or another possess a special interest. Thus E. Forsett's\r\n_Pedantius_, probably acted at Trinity in 1581, ridicules a personage\r\nwho lived very near the rose--the redoubtable Gabriel Harvey;[201] a\r\n_Laelia_, acted at Queen's in 1590 and again in 1598, resembles _Twelfth\r\nNight_ in part of its plot; while in _Silvanus_, performed in 1596,\r\nprobably at St John's, there are certain striking similarities to _As\r\nYou Like It_. These are in Latin, as are the comedies _Hispanus_\r\n(containing some curious allusions to the Armada, Drake and Dr Lopez)\r\nand _Machiavellus_, acted at St John's in 1597.[202] By far the most\r\ninteresting of the English plays of the later Cambridge series, and, it\r\nmay be averred, of the remains of the English academical drama as a\r\nwhole, are the Parnassus Plays (q.v.), successively produced at St\r\nJohn's in 1598-1602, which illustrate with much truthfulness as well as\r\nfancy the relations between university life and the outside world,\r\nincluding the world of letters and of the stage. Upon a different, but\r\nalso a very notable, aspect of English university life--the relations\r\nbetween town and gown--a partisan light is thrown by _Club-Law_, acted\r\nat Clare in 1599--and in G. Ruggle's celebrated Latin comedy of\r\n_Ignoramus_, twice acted by members of Clare at Trinity in 1615 before\r\nKing James I. On one of these occasions were also produced in English T.\r\nTomkis' comedy _Albumazar_ (a play absurdly attributed to Shakespeare),\r\nand Phineas Fletcher's _Sicelides_, a \"piscatory\" (i.e. a pastoral drama\r\nin which the place of the shepherds is taken by fishermen). Latin and\r\nEnglish plays continued to be brought out in Cambridge till the year of\r\nthe outbreak of the Civil War, T. Randolph and A. Cowley[203] being\r\namong the authors of some of the latest so produced; and with the\r\nRestoration the usage recommenced, the _Adelphi_ of Terence and other\r\nLatin comedies being performed as they had been a century earlier. A\r\ncomplete survey and classification of the English academical drama, for\r\nwhich the materials are at last being collected and compared, will prove\r\nof an importance which is only beginning to be recognized to the future\r\nhistorian of the English drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The stage.\r\n\r\nTo return to the general current of that drama. The rivals against which\r\nit had to contend in the times with which its greatest epoch came to an\r\nend have in their turn been noticed. From the masks and triumphs at\r\ncourt and at the houses of the nobility, with their Olympuses and\r\nParnassuses built by Inigo Jones, and filled with goddesses and nymphs\r\nclad in the gorgeous costumes designed by his inventive hand, to the\r\ncity pageants and shows by land and water--from the tilts and\r\ntournaments at Whitehall to the more philosophical devices at the Inns\r\nof Court and the academical plays at the universities--down even to the\r\nbrief but thrilling theatrical excitements of Bartholomew Fair and the\r\n\"Ninevitical motions\" of the puppets--in all these ways the various\r\nsections of the theatrical public were tempted aside. Foreign\r\nperformers--French and Spanish actors, and even French actresses--paid\r\nvisits to London. But the national drama held its ground. The art of\r\nacting maintained itself at least on the level to which it had been\r\nbrought by Shakespeare's associates and contemporaries, Burbage and\r\nHeminge, Alleyn, Lewin, Taylor, and others \"of the older sort.\" The\r\nprofession of actor came to be more generally than of old separated from\r\nthat of playwright, though they were still (as in the case of Field)\r\noccasionally combined. But this rather led to an increased appreciation\r\nof the artistic merit of actors who valued the dignity of their own\r\nprofession and whose co-operation the authors learnt to esteem as of\r\nindependent significance. The stage was purged from the barbarism of the\r\nold school of clowns. Women's parts were still acted by boys, many of\r\nwhom attained to considerable celebrity; and a practice was thus\r\ncontinued which must assuredly have placed the English theatre at a\r\nconsiderable disadvantage as compared with the Spanish (where it never\r\nobtained), and which may, while it has been held to have facilitated\r\nfreedom of fancy, more certainly encouraged the extreme licence of\r\nexpression cherished by the dramatists. The arrangement of the stage,\r\nwhich facilitated a rapid succession of scenes without any necessity for\r\ntheir being organically connected with one another, remained essentially\r\nwhat it had been in Shakespeare's days; though the primitive expedients\r\nfor indicating locality had begun to be occasionally exchanged for\r\nscenery more or less appropriate to the place of action. Costume was\r\napparently cultivated with much greater care; and the English stage of\r\nthis period had probably gone a not inconsiderable way in a direction to\r\nwhich it is obviously in the interests of the dramatic art to set some\r\nbounds, if it is to depend for its popular success upon its qualities as\r\nsuch, and upon the interpretation of its agents upon the stage. At the\r\nsame time, the drama had begun largely to avail itself of adventitious\r\naids to favour. The system of prologues and epilogues, and of\r\ndedications to published plays, was more uniformly employed than it had\r\nbeen by Shakespeare as the conventional method of recommending authors\r\nand actors to the favour of individual patrons, and to that of their\r\nchief patron, the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The drama and Puritanism.\r\n\r\n  Closing of the theatres.\r\n\r\nUp to the outbreak of the Civil War the drama in all its forms continued\r\nto enjoy the favour or good-will of the court, although a close\r\nsupervision was exercised over all attempts to make the stage the\r\nvehicle of political references or allusions. The regular official agent\r\nof this supervision was the master of the revels; but under James I. a\r\nspecial ordinance, in harmony with the king's ideas concerning the\r\ndignity of the throne, was passed \"against representing any modern\r\nChristian king in plays on the stage.\" The theatre could hardly expect\r\nto be allowed a liberty of speech in reference to matters of state\r\ndenied to the public at large; and occasional attempts to indulge in the\r\nfreedom of criticism dear to the spirit of comedy met with more or less\r\ndecisive repression and punishment.[204] But the sympathies of the\r\ndramatists were so entirely on the side of the court that the real\r\ndifficulties against which the theatre had to contend came from a\r\ndirectly opposite quarter. With the growth of Puritanism the feeling of\r\nhostility to the stage increased in a large part of the population, well\r\nrepresented by the civic authorities of the capital. This hostility\r\nfound many ways of expressing itself. The attempts to suppress the\r\nBlackfriars theatre (1619, 1631, 1633) proved abortive; but the\r\nrepresentation of stage-plays continued to be prohibited on Sundays, and\r\nduring the prevalence of the plague in London in 1637 was temporarily\r\nsuspended altogether. The desire of the Puritans of the more pronounced\r\ntype openly aimed at a permanent closing of the theatres. The war\r\nbetween them and the dramatists was accordingly of a life-and-death\r\nkind. On the one hand, the drama heaped its bitterest and often coarsest\r\nattacks upon whatever savoured of the Puritan spirit; gibes, taunts,\r\ncaricatures in ridicule and aspersion of Puritans and Puritanism make up\r\na great part of the comic literature of the later Elizabethan drama and\r\nof its aftergrowth in the reigns of the first two Stuarts. This feeling\r\nof hostility, to which Shakespeare was no stranger,[205] though he\r\ncannot be connected with the authorship of one of its earliest and\r\ncoarsest expressions,[206] rose into a spirit of open defiance in some\r\nof the masterpieces of Ben Jonson;[207] and the comedies of his\r\ncontemporaries and successors[208] abound in caricatured reproductions\r\nof the more common or more extravagant types of Puritan life. On the\r\nother hand, the moral defects, the looseness of tone, the mockery of\r\nties sanctioned by law and consecrated by religion, the tendency to\r\ntreat middle-class life as the hunting-ground for the diversions of the\r\nupper classes, which degraded so much of the dramatic literature of the\r\nage, intensified the Puritan opposition to all and any stage plays. A\r\npatient endeavour to reform instead of suppressing the drama was not to\r\nbe looked for from such adversaries, should they ever possess the means\r\nof carrying out their views; and whenever Puritanism should victoriously\r\nassert itself in the state, the stage was doomed. Among the attacks\r\ndirected against it in its careless heyday of prosperity Prynne's\r\n_Histrio-Mastix_ (1632), while it involved its author in shamefully\r\ncruel persecution, did not remain wholly without effect upon the tone of\r\nthe dramatic literature of the subsequent period; but the quarrel\r\nbetween Puritanism and the theatre was too old and too deep to end in\r\nany but one way, so soon as the latter was deprived of its protectors.\r\nThe Civil War began in August 1642; and early in the following month was\r\npublished the ordinance of the Lords and Commons, which, after a brief\r\nand solemn preamble, commanded \"that while these sad causes and\r\nset-times of humiliation do continue, public stage plays shall cease and\r\nbe forborne.\" Many actors and playwrights followed the fortunes of the\r\nroyal cause in the field; some may have gone into a more or less\r\nvoluntary exile; upon those who lingered on in the familiar haunts the\r\nhand of power lay heavy; and, though there seems reason to believe that\r\ndramatic entertainments of one kind or another continued to be\r\noccasionally presented, stringent ordinances gave summary powers to\r\nmagistrates against any players found engaged in such proceedings\r\n(1647), and bade them treat all stage-players as rogues, and pull down\r\nall stage galleries, seats and boxes (1648). A few dramatic works were\r\npublished in this period;[209] while at fairs about the country were\r\nacted farces called \"drolls,\" consisting of the most vulgar scenes to be\r\nfound in popular plays. Thus, the life of the drama was not absolutely\r\nextinguished; and its darkest day proved briefer than perhaps either its\r\nfriends or its foes could have supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Revival of the drama.\r\n\r\nAlready \"in Oliver's time\" private performances took place from time to\r\ntime at noblemen's houses and (though not undisturbed) in the old haunt\r\nof the drama, the Red Bull. In 1656 the ingenuity of Sir William\r\nDavenant whose name (though not really so significant in the dramatic as\r\nin another field of English literature) is memorable as connecting\r\ntogether two distinct periods in it, ventured on a bolder step in the\r\nproduction of a quasi-dramatic entertainment \"of declamation and music\";\r\nand in the following year he brought out with scenery and music a piece\r\nwhich was afterwards in an enlarged form acted and printed as the first\r\npart of his opera, _The Siege of Rhodes_. This entertainment he\r\nafterwards removed from the private house where it had been produced to\r\nthe Cockpit, where he soon ventured upon the performance of regular\r\nplays written by himself. Thus, under the cover of two sister arts,\r\nwhose aid was in the sequel to prove by no means altogether beneficial\r\nto its progress, the English drama had boldly anticipated the\r\nRestoration, and was no longer hiding its head when that much-desired\r\nevent was actually brought about. Soon after Charles II.'s entry into\r\nLondon, two theatrical companies are known to have been acting in the\r\ncapital. For these companies patents were soon granted, under the names\r\nof \"the Duke (of York)'s\" and \"the King's Servants,\" to Davenant and one\r\nof the brothers Killigrew respectively--the former from 1662 acting at\r\nLincoln's Inn Fields, then at Dorset Garden in Salisbury Court, the\r\nlatter from 1663 at the Theatre Royal near Drury Lane. These companies\r\nwere united from 1682, a royal licence being granted in 1695 to a rival\r\ncompany which performed in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and which migrated to\r\nCovent Garden in 1733. Meanwhile, Vanbrugh had in 1705 built the theatre\r\nin the Haymarket; and a theatre in Goodman's Fields--afterwards rendered\r\nfamous by the first appearance of Garrick--led a fitful existence from\r\n1729 to 1733. The act of 1737 deprived the crown of the power of\r\nlicensing any more theatres; so that the history of the English stage\r\nfor a long period was confined to a restricted area. The rule which\r\nprevailed after the Restoration, that neither of the rival companies\r\nshould ever attempt a play produced by the other, operated beneficially\r\nboth upon the activity of dramatic authorship and upon the progress of\r\nthe art of acting, which was not exposed to the full effects of that\r\ndeplorable spirit of personal rivalry which too often leads even most\r\nintelligent actors to attempt parts for which they have no special\r\nqualification. There can be little doubt that the actor's art has rarely\r\nflourished more in England than in the days of T. Betterton and his\r\ncontemporaries, among whose names those of Hart, Mohun, Kynaston, Nokes,\r\nMrs Barry, Mrs Betterton, Mrs Bracegirdle and Mrs Eleanor Gwyn have,\r\ntogether with many others, survived in various connexions among the\r\nmemories of the Restoration age. No higher praise has ever been given to\r\nan actor than that which Addison bestowed upon Betterton, in describing\r\nhis performance of _Othello_ as a proof that Shakespeare could not have\r\nwritten the most striking passages of the character otherwise than he\r\nhas done.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Irish stage.\r\n\r\nIt may here be noticed that the fortunes of the Irish theatre in general\r\nfollowed those of the English, of which of course it was merely a\r\nbranch. Of native dramatic compositions in earlier times not a trace\r\nremains in Ireland; and the drama was introduced into that country as an\r\nEnglish exotic--apparently already in the reign of Henry VIII., and more\r\nlargely in that of Elizabeth. The first theatre in Dublin was built in\r\n1635; but in 1641 it was closed, and even after the Restoration the\r\nIrish stage continued in a precarious condition till near the end of the\r\ncentury. About that time an extraordinarily strong taste for the theatre\r\ntook possession of Irish society, and during the greater part of the\r\n18th century the Dublin stage rivalled the English in the brilliancy of\r\nits stars. Betterton's rival, R. Wilks, Garrick's predecessor in the\r\nhomage paid to Shakespeare, Macklin, and his competitor for favour, the\r\n\"silver-tongued\" Barry, were alike products of the Irish stage, as were\r\nMrs Woffington and other well-known actresses. Nor should it be\r\nforgotten that three of the foremost English writers of comedy in its\r\nlater days, Congreve, Farquhar and Sheridan, were Irish, the first by\r\neducation, and the latter two by birth also.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The later Stuart drama.\r\n\r\nAlready in the period preceding the outbreak of the Civil War the\r\nEnglish drama had perceptibly sunk from the height to which it had been\r\nraised by the great Elizabethans. When it had once more recovered\r\npossession of that arena with which no living drama can dispense, it\r\nwould have been futile to demand that the dramatists should return\r\naltogether into the ancient paths, unaffected by the influences, native\r\nor foreign, in operation around them. But there was no reason why the\r\nnew drama should not, like the Elizabethan, have been true in spirit to\r\nthe higher purposes of the dramatic art, to the nobler tendencies of the\r\nnational life, and to the demands of moral law. Because the later Stuart\r\ndrama as a whole proved untrue to these, and, while following its own\r\ncourses, never more than partially returned from the aberrations to\r\nwhich it condemned itself, its history is that of a decay which the\r\nindisputable brilliancy, borrowed or original, of many of its\r\nproductions is incapable of concealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tragedy.\r\n\r\nOwing in part to the influence of the French theatre, which by this time\r\nhad taken the place of the Spanish as the ruling drama of Europe, the\r\nseparation between tragedy and comedy is clearly marked in\r\npost-Restoration plays. Comic scenes are still occasionally introduced\r\ninto tragedies by some dramatists who adhered more closely to the\r\nElizabethan models (such as Otway and Crowne), but the practice fell\r\ninto disuse; while the endeavour to elevate comedy by pathetic scenes\r\nand motives is one of the characteristic marks of the beginning of\r\nanother period in English dramatic literature. The successive phases\r\nthrough which English tragedy passed in the later Stuart times cannot be\r\nalways kept distinct from one another; and the guidance offered by the\r\ntheories put forth by some of the dramatists in support of their\r\npractice is often delusive. Following the example of Corneille, Dryden\r\nand his contemporaries and successors were fond of proclaiming their\r\nadherence to this or that principle of dramatic construction or form,\r\nand of upholding, with much show of dialectical acumen, maxims derived\r\nby them from French or other sources, or elaborated with modifications\r\nand variations of their own, but usually amounting to little more than\r\nwhat Scott calls \"certain romantic whimsical imitations of the dramatic\r\nart.\" Students of the drama will find much entertainment and much\r\ninstruction in these prefaces, apologies, dialogues and treatises. They\r\nwill acknowledge that Dryden's incomparable vigour does not desert him\r\neither in the exposing or in the upholding of fallacies, while _le bon\r\nsens_, which he hardly ever fails to exhibit, and which is a more\r\neclectic gift than common-sense, serves as a sure guide to the best\r\nintelligence of his age. Even Rymer,[210] usually regarded as having\r\ntouched the nadir of dramatic criticism, will be found to be not wholly\r\nwithout grains of salt. But Restoration tragedy itself must not be\r\nstudied by the light of Restoration criticism. So long as any dramatic\r\npower remained in the tragic poets--and it is absent from none of the\r\nchief among them from Dryden to Rowe--the struggle between fashion\r\n(disguised as theory) and instinct (tending in the direction of the\r\nElizabethan traditions) could never wholly determine itself in favour of\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nLord Orrery, in deference, as he declares, to the expressed tastes of\r\nhis sovereign King Charles II. himself, was the first to set up the\r\nstandard of _heroic plays_.[211] This new species of tragedy (for such\r\nit professed to be) commended itself by its novel choice of themes, to a\r\nlarge extent supplied by recent French romance--the _romans de longue\r\nhaleine_ of the Scudérys and their contemporaries--and by French plays\r\ntreating similar themes. It likewise borrowed from France that garb of\r\nrhyme which the English drama had so long abandoned, and which now\r\nreappeared in the heroic couplet. But the themes which to readers of\r\nnovels might seem of their nature inexhaustible could not long suffice\r\nto satisfy the more capricious appetite of theatrical audiences; and the\r\nform, in the application which it was more or less sought to enforce for\r\nit, was doomed to remain an exotic. In conjunction with his\r\nbrother-in-law Sir R. Howard,[212] and afterwards more confidently by\r\nhimself,[213] Dryden threw the incomparable vigour and brilliancy of his\r\ngenius into the scale, which soon rose to the full height of fashionable\r\npopularity. At first he claimed for English tragedy the right to combine\r\nher native inheritance of freedom with these valuable foreign\r\nacquisitions.[214] Nor was he dismayed by the ridicule which the\r\ncelebrated burlesque (by the duke of Buckingham and others) of _The\r\nRehearsal_ (1671) cast upon heroic plays, without discriminating between\r\nthem and such other materials for ridicule as the contemporary drama\r\nsupplied to its facetious authors, but returned[215] to the defence of a\r\nspecies which he was himself in the end to abandon.[216] The desire for\r\nchange proved stronger than the love of consistency--which in Dryden was\r\nnever more than theoretical. After summoning tragedy to rival the\r\nfreedom (without disdaining the machinery) of opera--with whose birth\r\nits own revival was as a matter of fact simultaneous--he came to\r\nrecognize in characterization the truest secret of the master-spirit of\r\nthe Elizabethan drama,[217] and after audaciously, but in one instance\r\nnot altogether unhappily, essaying to rival Shakespeare on his own\r\nground,[218] produced under the influence of the same views at least one\r\nwork of striking merit.[219] But he was already growing weary of the\r\nstage itself as well as of the rhymed heroic drama; and, though he put\r\nan end to the species to which he had given temporary vitality, he\r\nfailed effectively to point the way to a more legitimate development of\r\nEnglish tragedy. Among the other tragic poets of this period, N. Lee, in\r\nthe outward form of his dramas, accommodated his practice to that of\r\nDryden, with whom he occasionally co-operated as a dramatist, and like\r\nwhom he allowed political partisanship to intrude upon the stage.[220]\r\nHis rhetorical genius was not devoid of genuine energy, nor is he to be\r\nregarded as a mere imitator. T. Otway, the most gifted tragic poet of\r\nthe younger generation contemporary with Dryden, inherited something of\r\nthe spirit of the Elizabethan drama; he possessed a real gift of tragic\r\npathos and melting tenderness; but his genius had a worse alloy than\r\nstageyness, and, though he was often happy in his novel choice of\r\nthemes, his most successful efforts fail to satisfy tests supplementary\r\nto that of the stage.[221] Among dramatists who contributed to the vogue\r\nof the \"heroic\" play may be mentioned J. Bankes, J. Weston, C. Hopkins,\r\nE. Cooke, R. Gould, S. Pordage, T. Rymer and Elkanah Settle. The\r\nproductivity of J. Crowne (d. c. 1703)[222] covers part of the earlier\r\nperiod as well as of the later, to which properly belong T. Southerne, a\r\nwriter gifted with much pathetic power, but probably chiefly indebted\r\nfor his long-lived popularity to his skill in the discovery of\r\n\"sensational\" plots; and Lord Lansdowne (\"Granville the polite\") (c.\r\n1667-1735). Congreve, by virtue of a single long celebrated but not\r\nreally remarkable tragedy,[223] and N. Rowe, may be further singled out\r\nfrom the list of the tragic dramatists of this period, many of whom\r\nwere, like their comic contemporaries, mere translators or adapters from\r\nthe French. The tragedies of Rowe, whose direct services to the study of\r\nShakespeare deserve remembrance, indicate with singular distinctness the\r\ntransition from the fuller declamatory style of Dryden to the calmer and\r\nthinner manner of Addison.[224] In tragedy (as to a more marked degree\r\nin comedy) the excesses (both of style and subject) of the past period\r\nof the English drama had produced an inevitable reaction; decorum was\r\nasserting its claims on the stage as in society; and French tragedy had\r\nset the example of sacrificing what passion--and what vigour--it\r\nretained in favour of qualities more acceptable to the \"reformed\" court\r\nof Louis XIV. Addison, in allowing his _Cato_ to take its chance upon\r\nthe stage, when a moment of political excitement (April 1713) ensured to\r\nit an extraordinary success, to which no feature in it corresponds,\r\nexcept an unusual number of lines predestined to become familiar\r\nquotations, unconsciously sealed the doom of English national tragedy.\r\nThe \"first reasonable English tragedy,\" as Voltaire called it, had been\r\nproduced, and the oscillations of the tragic drama of the Restoration\r\nwere at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedy.\r\n\r\nEnglish comedy in this period displayed no similar desire to cut itself\r\noff from the native soil, though it freely borrowed the materials for\r\nits plots and many of its figures from Spanish, and afterwards more\r\ngenerally from French, originals. The spirit of the old romantic comedy\r\nhad long since fled; the graceful artificialities of the pastoral drama,\r\neven the light texture of the mask, ill suited the demands of an age\r\nwhich made no secret to itself of the grossness of its sensuality. With\r\na few unimportant exceptions, such poetic elements as admitted of being\r\ncombined with the poetic drama were absorbed by the opera and the\r\nballet. No new species of the comic drama formed itself, though towards\r\nthe close of the period may be noticed the beginnings of modern English\r\nfarce. Political and religious partisanship, generally in accordance\r\nwith the dominant reaction against Puritanism, were allowed to find\r\nexpression in the directest and coarsest forms upon the stage, and to\r\nhasten the necessity for a more systematic control than even the times\r\nbefore the Revolution had found requisite. At the same time the\r\nunblushing indecency which the Restoration had spread through court and\r\ncapital had established its dominion over the comic stage, corrupting\r\nthe manners, and with them the morals, of its dramatists, and forbidding\r\nthem, at the risk of seeming dull, to be anything but improper. Much of\r\nthis found its way even into the epilogues, which, together with the\r\nprologues, proved so important an adjunct of the Restoration drama.\r\nThese influences determine the general character of what is with a more\r\nthan chronological meaning termed the comedy of the Restoration. In\r\nconstruction, the national love of fulness and solidity of dramatic\r\ntreatment induced its authors to alter what they borrowed from foreign\r\nsources, adding to complicated Spanish plots characters of native\r\nEnglish directness, and supplementing single French plots by the\r\naddition of others.[225] At the same time, the higher efforts of French\r\ncomedy of character, as well as the refinement of expression in the list\r\nof their models, notably in Molière, were alike seasoned to suit the\r\ncoarser appetites and grosser palates of English patrons. The English\r\ncomic writers often succeeded in strengthening the borrowed texture of\r\ntheir plays, but they never added comic humour without at the same time\r\nadding coarseness of their own. Such were the productions of Sir George\r\nEtheredge, Sir Charles Sedley, and the \"mob of gentlemen who wrote with\r\nease\"; nor was there any signal difference between their productions and\r\nthose of a playwright-actor such as J. Lacy (d. 1681), and a\r\nprofessional dramatist of undoubted ability such as J. Crowne. Such,\r\nthough often displaying the brilliancy of a genius which even where it\r\nsank could never wholly abandon its prerogative, were, it must be\r\nconfessed, the comedies of Dryden himself. On the other hand, the lowest\r\nliterary deeps of the Restoration drama were sounded by T. D'Urfey,\r\nwhile of its moral degradation the \"divine Astraea,\" the \"unspeakable\"\r\nMrs Aphra Behn, has an indefeasible title to be considered the most\r\nfaithful representative. T. Shadwell, fated, like the tragic poet\r\nElkanah Settle, to be chiefly remembered as a victim of Dryden's satire,\r\ndeserves more honourable mention. Like J. Wilson, whose plays seem to\r\nclass him with the pre-Restoration dramatists, Shadwell had caught\r\nsomething not only of the art, but also of the spirit, of Ben Jonson;\r\nbut in most of his works he was, like the rest of his earlier\r\ncontemporaries, and like the brilliant group which succeeded them,\r\ncontent to take his moral tone from the reckless society for which, or\r\nin deference to the tastes of which, he wrote.[226] The absence of a\r\nmoral sense, which, together with a grossness of expression often\r\ndefying exaggeration, characterizes English comic dramatists from the\r\ndays of Dryden to those of Congreve, is the main cause of their failure\r\nto satisfy the demands which are legitimately to be made upon their art.\r\nThey essayed to draw character as well as to paint manners, but they\r\nrarely proved equal to the former and higher task; and, while choosing\r\nthe means which most readily commended their plays to the favour of\r\ntheir immediate public, they achieved but little as interpreters of\r\nthose essential distinctions which their art is capable of\r\nillustrating.[227] Within these limits, though occasionally passing\r\nbeyond them, and always with the same deference to the immoral tone\r\nwhich seemed to have become an indispensable adjunct of the comic style,\r\neven the greatest comic authors of this age moved. W. Wycherley was a\r\ncomic dramatist of real power, who drew his characters with vigour and\r\ndistinctness, and constructed his plots and chose his language with\r\nnatural ease. He lacks gaiety of spirit, and his wit is of a cynical\r\nturn. But, while he ruthlessly uncloaks the vices of his age, his own\r\nmoral tone is affected by their influence in as marked a degree as that\r\nof the most light-hearted of his contemporaries.[228] The most brilliant\r\nof these was indisputably W. Congreve, who is not only one of the very\r\nwittiest of English writers, but equally excels in the graceful ease of\r\nhis dialogue, and draws his characters and constructs his plots with the\r\nsame masterly skill. His chief fault as a dramatist is one of\r\nexcess--the brilliancy of the dialogue, whoever be the speaker,\r\noverpowers the distinction between the \"humours\" of his personages.\r\nThough he is less brutal in expression than \"manly\" Wycherley, and less\r\ncoarse than the lively Sir J. Vanbrugh, licentiousness in him as in them\r\ncorrupts the spirit of his comic art; but of his best though not most\r\nsuccessful play[229] it must be allowed that the issue of the main plot\r\nis on the side of virtue. G. Farquhar, whose morality is on a par with\r\nthat of the other members of this group, is inferior to them in\r\nbrilliancy; but as pictures of manners in a wider sphere of life than\r\nthat which contemporary comedy usually chose to illustrate, two of his\r\nplays deserve to be noticed, in which we already seem to be entering the\r\natmosphere of the 18th-century novel.[230] His influence upon Lessing is\r\na remarkable fact in the international history of dramatic literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sentimental comedy.\r\n\r\nThe improvement which now begins to manifest itself in the moral tone\r\nand spirit of English comedy is partly due to the reaction against the\r\nreaction of the Restoration, partly to the punishment which the excesses\r\nof the comic stage had brought upon it in the invective of Jeremy\r\nCollier[231] (1698), of all the assaults the theatre in England has had\r\nto undergo the best-founded, and that which produced the most\r\nperceptible results. The comic poets, who had always been more or less\r\nconscious of their sins, and had at all events not defended them by the\r\ningenious sophistries which it has pleased later literary criticism to\r\nsuggest on their behalf, now began with uneasy merriment to allude in\r\ntheir prologues to the reformation which had come over the spirit of the\r\ntown. Writers like Mrs Centlivre became anxious to reclaim their\r\noffenders with much emphasis in the fifth act; and Colley Cibber--whose\r\n_Apology for his Life_ furnishes a useful view of this and the\r\nsubsequent period of the history of the stage, with which he was\r\nconnected as author, manager and actor (excelling in this capacity as\r\nrepresentative of those fools with which he peopled the comic\r\nstage)[232]--may be credited with having first deliberately made the\r\npathetic treatment of a moral sentiment the basis of the action of a\r\ncomic drama. But he cannot be said to have consistently pursued the vein\r\nwhich in his _Careless Husband_ (1704) he had essayed. His _Non-Juror_\r\nis a political adaptation of _Tartuffe_; and his almost equally\r\ncelebrated _Provoked Husband_ only supplied a happy ending to Vanbrugh's\r\nunfinished play. Sir R. Steele, in accordance with his general\r\ntendencies as a writer, pursued a still more definite moral purpose in\r\nhis comedies; but his genius perhaps lacked the sustained vigour\r\nnecessary for a dramatist, and his humour naturally sought the aid of\r\npathos. From partial[233] he passed to more complete[234] experiment;\r\nand thus these two writers, who transplanted to the comic stage a\r\ntendency towards the treatment of domestic themes noticeable in such\r\nwriters of Restoration tragedy as Southerne and Rowe, became the\r\nfounders of _sentimental comedy_, a species which exercised a most\r\ndepressing influence upon the progress of English drama, and helped to\r\nhasten the decline of its comic branch. With _Cato_ English tragedy\r\ncommitted suicide, though its pale ghost survived; with _The Conscious\r\nLovers_ English comedy sank for long into the tearful embraces of\r\nartificiality and weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The drama and stage in the period before Garrick.\r\n\r\n  Garrick.\r\n\r\nDuring the 18th century the productions of dramatic literature were\r\nstill as a rule legitimately designed to meet the demands of the stage,\r\nfrom which its higher efforts afterwards to so large an extent became\r\ndissociated. The goodwill of most sections of the public continued to be\r\nsteadily accorded to a theatre which had ceased to defy the accepted\r\nlaws and traditions of morality; and the opposition still aroused by it\r\nwas confined to a small minority of thinkers, though these included some\r\nwho were far from being puritans. John Dennis was not thought to have\r\nthe worst of the controversy, when he defended the stage against the\r\nattack of an opponent far above him in stature--the great mystic William\r\nLaw[235]--and to John Wesley himself it seemed that \"a great deal more\r\nmight be said in defence of seeing a serious tragedy\" than of taking\r\npart in the amusements of bear-baiting and cock-fighting. On the other\r\nhand, the demands of the stage and those of its patrons and of the\r\npublic of the \"Augustan\" age, and of that which succeeded it, were, in\r\ngeneral, fast bound by the trammels of a taste with which a revival of\r\nthe poetic drama long remained irreconcilable. There is every reason to\r\nconclude that the art of acting progressed in the same direction of\r\nartificiality, and became stereotyped in forms corresponding to the\r\n\"chant\" which represented tragic declamation in a series of actors\r\nending with Quin and Macklin. In the latter must be recognized features\r\nof a precursor, but it was reserved to the genius of Garrick, whose\r\ntheatrical career extended from 1741 to 1776, to open a new era in his\r\nart. His unparalleled success was due in the first instance to his\r\nincomparable natural gifts; yet these were indisputably enhanced by a\r\ncareful and continued literary training, and ennobled by a purpose\r\nwhich prompted him to essay the noblest, as he was capable of performing\r\nthe most various, range of English theatrical characters. By devoting\r\nhimself as actor and manager with special zeal to the production of\r\nShakespeare, Garrick permanently popularized on the national stage the\r\ngreatest creations of English drama, and indirectly helped to seal the\r\ndoom of what survived of the tendency to maintain in the most ambitious\r\nwalks of dramatic literature the nerveless traditions of the\r\npseudo-classical school. A generation of celebrated actors and\r\nactresses, many of whom live for us in the drastic epigrams of\r\nChurchill's _Rosciad_ (1761), were his helpmates or his rivals; but\r\ntheir fame has paled, while his is destined to endure as that of one of\r\nthe typical masters of his art.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decline of tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the tragedy of the 18th century and those plays of\r\nShakespeare and one or two other Elizabethans which already before\r\nGarrick were known to the English stage, was weakened by the mutilated\r\nform in which the old masterpieces generally, if not always, made their\r\nappearance there. Even so, however, there are perhaps few instances in\r\ntheatrical history in which so unequal a competition was so long\r\nsustained. In the hands of the tragic poets of the age of Pope, as well\r\nas that of Johnson, tragedy had hopelessly stiffened into the forms of\r\nits accepted French models. Direct reproductions of these continued, as\r\nin Ambrose Philips's and Charles Johnson's (1679-1748) translations from\r\nRacine, and Aaron Hill's from Voltaire. Among other tragic dramatists of\r\nthe earlier part of the century may be mentioned J. Hughes, who, after\r\nassisting Addison in his _Cato_, produced at least one praiseworthy\r\ntragedy of his own;[236] E. Fenton, a joint translator of \"Pope's\r\n_Homer_\" and the author of one extremely successful drama on a theme of\r\nsingularly enduring interest,[237] and L. Theobald the first hero of the\r\n_Dunciad_, who, besides translations of Greek dramas, produced a few\r\nmore or less original plays, one of which he was daring enough to father\r\nupon Shakespeare.[238] A more distinguished name is that of J. Thomson,\r\nwhose unlucky _Sophonisba_ and subsequent tragedies are, however, barely\r\nremembered by the side of his poems (_The Seasons_, &c.). The literary\r\ngenius of E. Young, on the other hand, possessed vigour and variety\r\nenough to distinguish his tragedies from the ordinary level of Augustan\r\nplays; in one of them he seems to challenge comparison in the treatment\r\nof his theme with a very different rival,[239] but by his main\r\ncharacteristics as a dramatist he belongs to the school of his\r\ncontemporaries. The endeavour of G. Lillo, in his _London Merchant, or\r\nGeorge Barnwell_ (1731), to bring the tragic lessons of terror and pity\r\ndirectly home to his fellow-citizens exercised an extraordinarily\r\nwidespread as well as enduring effect on the history of the 18th-century\r\ndrama. At home, they gave birth to the new, or, more properly speaking,\r\nto the revived, species of domestic tragedy, which connects itself more\r\nor less closely with a notable epoch in the history of English\r\nprose-fiction as well as of English painting. Abroad, this play--whose\r\nsuccess was of the kind which nothing can kill--supplied the text to the\r\nteachings of Diderot, as well as an example to his own dramatic\r\nattempts; and through Diderot the impulse communicated itself to\r\nLessing, and long exercised a great effect upon the literature of the\r\nGerman stage. At the same time, it must be allowed that Lillo's\r\npedestrian muse failed in the end to satisfy higher artistic demands\r\nthan those met in his most popular play, while in another[240] she was\r\nless consciously guilty of an aberration towards that \"tragedy of\r\ndestiny,\" which, in the modern drama at least, obscures the ethical\r\ncharacter of all tragic actions. \"Classical\" tragedy in the generation\r\nof Dr Johnson pursued the even tenor of its way, the dictator himself\r\ntreading with solemn footfall in the accustomed path,[241] and W. Mason\r\nmaking the futile attempt to produce a close imitation of Greek\r\nmodels.[242] The best-remembered tragedy of the century, Home's\r\n_Douglas_ (1757), was the production of an author whose famous kinsman,\r\nDavid Hume (though no friend of the contemporary English stage), had\r\nadvised him \"to read Shakespeare, but to get Racine and Voltaire by\r\nheart.\" The indisputable merits of the play cannot blind us to the fact\r\nthat _Douglas_ is the offspring of _Merope_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  English opera.\r\n\r\nWhile thus no high creative talent arose to revive the poetic genius of\r\nEnglish tragedy, comedy, which had to contend against the same rivals,\r\nnaturally met the demands of the conflict with greater buoyancy. The\r\nhistory of the most formidable of those rivals, Music, forms no part of\r\nthis sketch; but the points of contact between its progress and the\r\nhistory of dramatic literature cannot be altogether left out of sight.\r\nH. Purcell's endeavours to unite English music to the words of English\r\npoets were now a thing of the past; analogous attempts in the direction\r\nof musical dialogue, which have been insufficiently noticed, had\r\nlikewise proved transitory; and the isolated efforts of Addison[243] and\r\nothers to recover the operatic stage for the native tongue had proved\r\npowerless. Italian texts, which had first made their entrance piecemeal,\r\nin the end asserted themselves in their entirety; and the marvellously\r\nassimilative genius of Handel completed the triumphs of a form of art\r\nwhich no longer had any connexion with the English drama, and which\r\nreached the height of its fashionable popularity about the time when\r\nGarrick began to adorn the national stage. In one form, however, the\r\nEnglish opera was preserved as a pleasing species of the popular drama.\r\nThe pastoral drama had (in 1725) produced an isolated aftergrowth in\r\nAllan Ramsay's _Gentle Shepherd_, which, with genuine freshness and\r\nhumour, but without a trace of burlesque, transferred to the scenery of\r\nthe Pentland Hills the lovely tale of Florizel and Perdita. The dramatic\r\nform of this poem is only an accident, but it doubtless suggested an\r\nexperiment of a different kind to the most playful of London wits. Gay's\r\n\"Newgate Pastoral\" of _The Beggar's Opera_ (1728), in which the amusing\r\ntext of a burlesque farce was interspersed with songs set to popular\r\nairs, caught the fancy of the town by this novel combination, and became\r\nthe ancestor of a series of agreeable productions, none of which,\r\nhowever, not even its own continuation, _Polly_ (amazingly successful in\r\nbook form, after its production was forbidden by the lord chamberlain),\r\nhave ever rivalled it in success or celebrity. Among these may be\r\nmentioned the pieces of I. Bickerstaffe[244] and C. Dibdin.[245] The\r\nopera in England, as elsewhere, thus absorbed what vitality remained to\r\nthe pastoral drama, while to the ballet and the pantomime (whose glories\r\nin England began at Covent Garden in 1733, and to whose popularity even\r\nGarrick was obliged to defer) was left (in the 18th century at all\r\nevents) the inheritance of the external attractions of the mask and the\r\npageant.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedy. Burlesque.\r\n\r\n  The Licensing Act.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such various rivalries it is not strange that comedy,\r\ninstead of adhering to the narrow path which Steele and others had\r\nmarked out for her, should have permitted herself some vagaries of her\r\nown. Gay's example pointed the way to a fatally facile form of the comic\r\nart; and burlesque began to contribute its influence to the decline of\r\ncomedy. In an age when party-government was severely straining the\r\ncapabilities of its system, dramatic satire had not far to look for a\r\nsource of effective seasonings. The audacity of H. Fielding, whose\r\nregular comedies (original or adapted) have secured no enduring\r\nremembrance, but whose love of parody was afterwards to suggest to him\r\nthe theme of the first of the novels which have made his name immortal,\r\naccordingly ventured in two extravaganzas[246] (so we should call them\r\nin these days) upon a larger admixture of political with literary and\r\nother satire. A third attempt[247] (which never reached the stage)\r\nfurnished the offended minister, Sir Robert Walpole, with the desired\r\noccasion for placing a curb upon the licence of the theatre, such as\r\nhad already been advocated by a representative of its old civic\r\nadversaries. The famous act of 1737 asserted no new principle, but\r\nconverted into legal power the customary authority hither exercised by\r\nthe lord chamberlain (to whom it had descended from the master of the\r\nrevels). The regular censorship which this act established has not\r\nappreciably affected the literary progress of the English drama, and the\r\nobjections which have been raised against it seem to have addressed\r\nthemselves to practice rather than to principle. The liberty of the\r\nstage is a question differing in its conditions from that of the liberty\r\nof speech in general, or even from that of the liberty of the press; and\r\noccasional lapses of official judgment weigh lightly in the balance\r\nagainst the obvious advantages of a system which in a free country needs\r\nonly the vigilance of public opinion to prevent its abuse. The policy of\r\nthe restraint which the act of 1737 put upon the number of playhouses is\r\na different, but has long become an obsolete, question.[248]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedy in the latter half of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nBrought back into its accustomed grooves, English comedy seemed inclined\r\nto leave to farce the domain of healthy ridicule, and to coalesce with\r\ndomestic tragedy in the attempt to make the stage a vehicle of homespun\r\ndidactic morality. Farce had now become a genuine English species, and\r\nhas as such retained its vitality through all the subsequent fortunes of\r\nthe stage; it was actively cultivated by Garrick as both actor and\r\nauthor; and he undoubtedly had more than a hand in the very best farce\r\nof this age, which is ascribed to clerical authorship.[249] S. Foote,\r\nwhose comedies[250] and farces are distinguished both by wit and by\r\nvariety of characters (though it was an absurd misapplication of a great\r\nname to call him the English Aristophanes), introduced into comic acting\r\nthe abuse of personal mimicry, for the exhibition of which he\r\ningeniously invented a series of entertainments, the parents of a long\r\nprogeny of imitations. Meanwhile, the domestic drama of the sentimental\r\nkind achieved, though not immediately, a success only inferior to that\r\nof _The London Merchant_, in _The Gamester_ of E. Moore, to which\r\nGarrick seems to have directly contributed;[251] and sentimental comedy\r\ncourted sympathetic applause in the works of A. Murphy, the single\r\ncomedy of W. Whitehead,[252] and the earliest of H. Kelly.[153] It\r\ncannot be said that this species was extinguished, as it is sometimes\r\nassumed to have been, by O. Goldsmith; but he certainly published a\r\ndirect protest against it between the production of his admirable\r\ncharacter-comedy of _The Good-Natured Man_, and his delightfully brisk\r\nand fresh _She Stoops to Conquer_, which, after startling critical\r\npropriety from its self-conceit, taught comedy no longer to fear being\r\ntrue to herself. The most successful efforts of the elder G. Colman[254]\r\nhad in them something of the spirit of genuine comedy, besides a finish\r\nwhich, however playwrights may shut their eyes to the fact, is one of\r\nthe qualities which ensure a long life to a play. And in the\r\nmasterpieces of R. B. Sheridan some of the happiest features of the\r\ncomedy of Congreve were revived, together with its too uniform\r\nbrilliancy of dialogue, but without its indecency of tone. The varnish\r\nof the age is indeed upon the style, and the hollowness of its morality\r\nin much of the sentiment (even where that sentiment is meant for the\r\naudience) of _The Rivals_ and _The School for Scandal_; but in tact of\r\nconstruction, in distinctness of characters, and in pungency of social\r\nsatire, they are to be ranked among the glories of English comedy.\r\nSomething in Sheridan's style, but quite without his brilliancy, is the\r\nmost successful play[255] of the unfortunate General Burgoyne. R.\r\nCumberland, who too consciously endeavoured to excel both in sentimental\r\nmorality and in comic characterization, in which he was devoid of depth,\r\ncloses the list of authors of higher pretensions who wrote for the\r\ntheatre.[256] Like him, Mrs Cowley[257] (\"Anna Matilda\"), T.\r\nHolcroft,[258] and G. Colman the younger,[259] all writers of popular\r\ncomedies, as well as the prolific J. O'Keefe (1746-1833), who\r\ncontributed to nearly every species of the comic drama, survived into\r\nthe 19th century. To an earlier date belong the favourite burlesques of\r\nO'Keefe's countryman K. O'Hara[260] (d. 1782), good examples of a\r\nspecies the further history of which may be left aside. In the hands of\r\nat least one later writer, J. R. Planché, it proved capable of\r\nsatisfying a more refined taste than his successors have habitually\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The English drama of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nThe decline of dramatic composition of the higher class, perceptible in\r\nthe history of the English theatre about the beginning of the 19th\r\ncentury, was justly attributed by Sir Walter Scott to the wearing out of\r\nthe French model that had been so long wrought upon; but when he\r\nasserted that the new impulse which was sought in the dramatic\r\nliterature of Germany was derived from some of its worst, instead of\r\nfrom its noblest, productions--from Kotzebue rather than from Lessing,\r\nSchiller and Goethe--he showed a very imperfect acquaintance with a\r\ncomplicated literary movement which was obliquely reflected in the\r\nstage-plays of Iffland and his contemporaries. The change which was\r\ncoming over English literature was in truth of a wider and deeper nature\r\nthan it was possible for even one of its chief representatives to\r\nperceive. As that literature freed itself from the fetters so long worn\r\nby it as indispensable ornaments, and threw aside the veil which had so\r\nlong obscured both the full glory of its past and the lofty capabilities\r\nof its future, it could not resort except tentatively to a form which\r\nlike the dramatic is bound by a hundred bonds to the life of the age\r\nitself. Soon, the poems with which Scott and Byron, and the unrivalled\r\nprose fictions with which Scott, both satisfied and stimulated the\r\nimaginative demands of the public, diverted the attention of the\r\ncultivated classes from dramatic literature, which was unable to escape,\r\nwith the light foot of verse or prose fiction, into \"the new, the\r\nromantic land.\" New themes, new ideas, new forms occupied a new\r\ngeneration of writers and readers; nor did the drama readily lend itself\r\nas a vessel into which to pour so many fermenting elements. In Byron the\r\nimpressions produced upon a mind not less open to impulses from without\r\nthan subjective in its way of recasting them, called forth a series of\r\ndramatic attempts betraying a more or less wilful ignorance of the\r\ndemands of dramatic compositions; his beautiful _Manfred_, partly\r\nsuggested by Goethe's _Faust_, and his powerful _Cain_, have but the\r\nform of plays; his tragedies on Italian historical subjects show some\r\nresemblance in their political rhetoric to the contemporary works of\r\nAlfieri; his _Sardanapalus_, autobiographically interesting, fails to\r\nmeet the demands of the stage; his _Werner_ (of which the authorship has\r\nbeen ascribed to the duchess of Devonshire) is a hastily dramatized\r\nsensation novel. To Coleridge (1772-1834), who gave to English\r\nliterature a splendidly loose translation of Schiller's _Wallenstein_,\r\nthe same poet's _Robbers_ (to which Wordsworth's only dramatic attempt,\r\nthe _Borderers_, is likewise indebted) had probably suggested the\r\nsubject of his tragedy of _Osorio_, afterwards acted under the title of\r\n_Remorse_. Far superior to this is his later drama of _Zapolya_, a\r\ngenuine homage to Shakespeare, out of the themes of two of whose plays\r\nit is gracefully woven. Scott, who in his earlier days had translated\r\nGoethe's _Götz von Berlichingen_, gained no reputation by his own\r\ndramatic compositions. W. S. Landor, apart from those _Imaginary\r\nConversations_ upon which he best loved to expend powers of observation\r\nand characterization such as have been given to few playwrights, cast\r\nin a formally dramatic mould studies of character of which the value is\r\nfar from being confined to their wealth in beauties of detail. Of these\r\nthe magnificent, but in construction altogether undramatic, _Count\r\nJulian_, is the most noteworthy. Shelley's _The Cenci_, on the other\r\nhand, is not only a poem of great beauty, but a drama of true power,\r\nabnormally revolting indeed in theme, but singularly pure and delicate\r\nin treatment. A humbler niche in the temple of dramatic literature\r\nbelongs to some of the plays of C. R. Maturin,[261] Sir T. N.\r\nTalfourd,[262] and Dean Milman.[263]\r\n\r\nDivorced, except for passing moments, from the stage, English dramatic\r\nliterature could during much the greater part of the 19th century hardly\r\nbe regarded as a connected national growth; though, already in the last\r\ndecades of the Victorian age, the revival of public interest in the\r\ntheatre co-operated with a gradual change in poetic taste to awaken the\r\nhope of a future living reunion. Among English poets who lived in this\r\nperiod, Sir Henry Taylor probably approached nearest to the objective\r\ntreatment and the amplitude of style characteristic of the Elizabethan\r\ndrama.[264] R. H. Horne, long an almost solitary survivor of the\r\nromantic school, was able in at least one memorable dramatic attempt to\r\nrevive something of the early Elizabethan spirit.[265] Of the chief\r\npoets of the age, Tennyson only in his later years addressed himself to\r\na form of composition little suited to his genius, though the very fact\r\nof the homage paid by him to the national forms of the historic drama\r\nand of romantic comedy could not fail to ennoble the contemporary\r\nstage.[266] Matthew Arnold's stately revival of the traditions of\r\nclassical tragedy proper, on the other hand, deliberately excluded\r\nitself from any such contact;[267] while Longfellow's refined literary\r\nculture and graceful facility of form made ready use of a quasi-dramatic\r\nmedieval vesture.[268] William Morris's single \"morality,\" too, cannot\r\nbe regarded as a contribution to dramatic literature proper.[269] Of\r\nvery different importance are the excursions into dramatic composition\r\nof Robert Browning, whose place in the living inheritance of the English\r\ndrama has in one instance at least been not unsuccessfully vindicated by\r\na later age, and some of whose greatest gifts are beyond a doubt\r\ndisplayed in his dramatic work;[270] and the sustained endeavours of A.\r\nC. Swinburne, after adding a flower of exquisite beauty to the wreath\r\nwhich the lovers of the Attic muse have laid at her feet, to enrich the\r\nnational historic drama by a trilogy instinct with the ardent eloquence\r\nof passion.[271] Until a date too near the times in which we live to\r\nadmit of its being fixed with precision, most of the English writers who\r\nsought to preserve a connexion between their dramatic productions and\r\nthe demands of the stage addressed themselves to the theatrical rather\r\nthan the literary public--for the distinction, in those times at all\r\nevents, was by no means without a difference. The modestly simple and\r\njudiciously concentrated efforts of Joanna Baillie deserve a respectful\r\nremembrance in the records of literature as well as of the stage, though\r\nthe day has passed when the theory which suggested her _Plays on the\r\nPassions_ could find acceptance among critics, or her exemplifications\r\nof it satisfy the demands of playgoers. Sheridan Knowles, on the other\r\nhand, composed his conventional semblances of genuine tragedy and comedy\r\nwith a thorough knowledge of stage effect, and some of them can hardly\r\nyet be said to have vanished from the stage.[272] The first Lord Lytton,\r\nthough his plays were for the most part of a lighter texture, showed\r\neven more artificiality of sentiment in their conception and execution;\r\nbut the romantic touch which he imparted to at least one of them\r\naccounts for its long-lived popularity. Among later Victorian\r\nplaywrights T. W. Robertson brought back a breath of naturalness into\r\nthe acted comic drama; Tom Taylor, rivalling Lope in fertility, made\r\nlittle pretence to original invention, but adapted with an instinct that\r\nrarely failed him, and materially helped to keep the theatrical\r\ndiversions of his age sound and pure; an endeavour in which he had the\r\nco-operation of Charles Reade and that of most of those who competed\r\nwith them for the favour of generations of playgoers more easily\r\ncontented than their successors. The one deplorable aspect of this age\r\nof the English drama was to be found neither in the sphere of tragedy\r\nnor in that of comedy--nor even in that of farce. It was presented in\r\nthe low depths of contemporary burlesque, which had degenerated from the\r\ngraceful extravaganza of J. R. Planché into witless and tasteless\r\nemptiness.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, it was at this point that something like real\r\noriginality--discovering a new sub-species of its own--first began, with\r\nthe aid of a sister-art, to renovate the English popular comic stage. At\r\nthe beginning of the 19th century the greatest tragic actress of the\r\nEnglish theatre, Mrs Siddons, had passed her prime; and before its\r\nsecond decade had closed, not only she (1812) but her brother John\r\nKemble (1817), the representative of a grand style of acting which later\r\ngenerations might conceivably find overpowering, had withdrawn from the\r\nboards. Mrs Siddons was soon followed into retirement by her successor\r\nMiss O'Neill (1819); while Kemble's brilliant later rival, Edmund Kean,\r\nan actor the intuitions of whose genius seem to have supplied, so far as\r\nintuition ever can supply, the absence of a consecutive self-culture,\r\nremained on the stage till his death in 1833. Young, Macready, and\r\nothers handed down some of the traditions of the older school of acting\r\nto the very few artists who remained to suggest its semblance to a later\r\ngeneration. Even these--among them S. Phelps, whose special merit it was\r\nto present to a later age, accustomed to elaborate theatrical\r\nenvironments, dramatic masterpieces as dependent upon themselves and\r\nadequate interpretation; and the foremost English actress of the earlier\r\nVictorian age, Helen Faucit (Lady Martin)--were unable to leave a school\r\nof acting behind them. Still less was this possible to Charles Kean the\r\nyounger, with whom the decorative production of Shakespearian plays\r\nreally had its beginning; or even to Sir Henry Irving, an actor of\r\ngenius, but also an irrepressible and almost eccentric theatrical\r\npersonality, whose great service to the English drama was his faith in\r\nits masterpieces. The comic stage was fortunate in an ampler\r\naftergrowth, from generation to generation, of the successors of the old\r\nactors who live for us all in the reminiscences of Charles Lamb; nor\r\nwere the links suddenly snapped which bound the humours of the present\r\nto those of the past. In the first decade of the 20th century a\r\ngeneration still survived which could recall, with many other similar\r\njoys, the brilliant levity of Charles Mathews the younger; the not less\r\nirresistible stolidity of J. B. Buckstone; the solemn fooling of H.\r\nCompton (1805-1877); the subtle humours of J. L. Toole, and the frolic\r\ncharm of Marie Wilton (Lady Bancroft), the most original comic actress\r\nof her time. (A. W. W.)\r\n\r\n_Recent English Drama._--In England the whole mechanism of theatrical\r\nlife had undergone a radical change in the middle decades of the 19th\r\ncentury. At the root of this change lay the immense growth of population\r\nand the enormously increased facilities of communication between London\r\nand the provinces. Similar causes came into operation, of course, in\r\nFrance, Germany and Austria, but were much less distinctly felt, because\r\nthe numerous and important subventioned theatres of these countries\r\nremained more or less unaffected by economic influences. Free trade in\r\ntheatricals (subject only to certain licensing regulations and to a\r\ncourt censorship of new plays) was established in England by an act of\r\n1843, which abolished the long moribund monopoly of the \"legitimate\r\ndrama\" claimed by the \"Patent Theatres\" of Drury Lane and Covent Garden.\r\nThe drama was thus formally subjected to the operation of the law of\r\nsupply and demand, like any other article of commerce, and managers were\r\nleft, unaided and unhampered by any subvention or privilege, to cater to\r\nthe tastes of a huge and growing community. Theatres very soon\r\nmultiplied, competition grew ever keener, and the long run, with its\r\naccompaniments of ostentatious decoration and lavish advertisement,\r\nbecame the one object of managerial effort. This process of evolution\r\nmay be said to have begun in the second quarter of the 19th century and\r\ncompleted itself in the 3rd. The system which obtains to-day, almost\r\nunforeseen in 1825, was in full operation in 1875. The repertory\r\ntheatre, with its constant changes of programme, maintained on the\r\ncontinent partly by subventions, partly by the mere force of artistic\r\ntradition, had become in England a faint and far-off memory. There was\r\nnot a single theatre in London at which plays, old and new, were not\r\nselected and mounted solely with a view to their continuous performance\r\nfor as many nights as possible, anything short of fifty nights\r\nconstituting an ignominious and probably ruinous failure. It was found,\r\ntoo, that those theatres were most successful which were devoted\r\nexclusively to exploiting the talent of an individual actor. Thus when\r\nthe fourth quarter of the century opened, the long \"run\" and the\r\nactor-manager were in firm possession of the field.\r\n\r\nThe outlook was in many ways far from encouraging. It was not quite so\r\nblack, indeed, as it had been in the late 'fifties and early 'sixties,\r\nwhen the \"legitimate\" enterprises of Phelps at Sadler's Wells and\r\nCharles Kean at the Princess's had failed to hold their ground, and when\r\nmodern comedy and drama were represented almost exclusively by\r\nadaptations from the French. There had been a slight stirring of\r\noriginality in the series of comedies produced by T. W. Robertson at the\r\nPrince of Wales's theatre, where, under the management of Bancroft\r\n(q.v.) a new school of mounting and acting, minutely faithful (in theory\r\nat any rate) to everyday reality, had come into existence. But the hopes\r\nof a revival of English comedy seemed to have died with Robertson's\r\ndeath. One of his followers, James Albery, possessed both imagination\r\nand wit, but had not the strength of character to do justice to his\r\ntalent, and sank into a mere adapter. In the plays of another disciple,\r\nH. J. Byron, the Robertsonian or \"cup-and-saucer\" school declined upon\r\nsheer inanity. Of the numerous plays signed by Tom Taylor some were\r\noriginal in substance, but all were cast in the machine-made French\r\nmould. Wilkie Collins, in dramatizing some of his novels, produced\r\nsomewhat crude anticipations of the modern \"problem play.\" The literary\r\ntalent of W. S. Gilbert displayed itself in a group of comedies both in\r\nverse and prose; but Gilbert saw life from too peculiar an angle to\r\nrepresent it otherwise than fantastically. The Robertsonian impulse\r\nseemed to have died utterly away, leaving behind it only five or six\r\nvery insubstantial comedies and a subdued, unrhetorical method in\r\nacting. This method the Bancrofts proceeded to apply, during the\r\n'seventies, to revivals of stage classics, such as _The School for\r\nScandal_, _Money_ and _Masks and Faces_, and to adaptations from the\r\nFrench of Sardou.\r\n\r\nWhile the modern drama appeared to have relapsed into a comatose\r\ncondition, poetic and romantic drama was giving some signs of life. At\r\nthe Lyceum in 1871 Henry Irving had leapt into fame by means of his\r\nperformance of Mathias in _The Bells_, an adaptation from the French of\r\nErckmann-Chatrian. He followed this up by an admirably picturesque\r\nperformance of the title-part in _Charles I._ by W. G. Wills. In the\r\nautumn of 1874 the great success of Irving's Hamlet was hailed as the\r\nprelude to a revival of tragic acting. As a matter of fact, it was the\r\nprelude to a long series of remarkable achievements in romantic drama\r\nand melodrama. Irving's lack of physical and vocal resources prevented\r\nhim from scaling the heights of tragedy, and his Othello, Macbeth, and\r\nLear could not be ranked among his successes; but he was admirable in\r\nsuch parts as Richard III., Shylock, Iago and Wolsey, while in\r\nmelodramatic parts, such as Louis XI. and the hero and villain of _The\r\nLyons Mail_, he was unsurpassed. Mephistopheles in a version of _Faust_\r\n(1885), perhaps the greatest popular success of his career, added\r\nnothing to his reputation for artistic intelligence; but on the other\r\nhand his Becket in Tennyson's play of that name (1893) was one of his\r\nmost masterly efforts. His management of the Lyceum (1878-1899) did so\r\nmuch to raise the status of the actor and to restore the prestige of\r\npoetic drama, that the knighthood conferred upon him in 1895 was felt to\r\nbe no more than an appropriate recognition of his services. But his\r\nmanagerial career had scarcely any significance for the living English\r\ndrama. He seldom experimented with a new play, and, of the few which he\r\ndid produce, only _The Cup_ and _Becket_ by Lord Tennyson have the\r\nremotest chance of being remembered.\r\n\r\nTo trace the history of the new English drama, then, we must go back to\r\nthe Prince of Wales's theatre. Even while it seemed that French comedy\r\nof the school of Scribe was resuming its baneful predominance, the seeds\r\nof a new order of things were slowly germinating. _Diplomacy_, an\r\nadaptation of Sardou's _Dora_, produced in 1878, brought together on the\r\nPrince of Wales's stage Mr and Mrs Bancroft, Mr and Mrs Kendal, John\r\nClayton and Arthur Cecil--in other words, the future managers of the\r\nHaymarket, the St James's and the Court theatres, which were destined to\r\nsee the first real stirrings of a literary revival. Mr and Mrs Kendal,\r\nwho, in conjunction with John Hare, managed the St James's theatre from\r\n1879 to 1888, produced A. W. Pinero's first play of any consequence,\r\n_The Money-Spinner_ (1881), and afterwards _The Squire_ (1882) and _The\r\nHobby Horse_ (1887). The Bancrofts, who, after entirely rebuilding the\r\nHaymarket theatre, managed it from 1880 till their retirement in 1885,\r\nproduced in 1883 Pinero's _Lords and Commons_; and Messrs Clayton and\r\nCecil produced at the Court theatre between 1885 and 1887 his three\r\nbrilliant farces, _The Magistrate_, _The Schoolmistress_ and _Dandy\r\nDick_, which, with the sentimental comedy, _Sweet Lavender_, produced at\r\nTerry's theatre in 1888, assured his position as an original and fertile\r\ndramatic humorist of no small literary power. It is to be noted,\r\nhowever, that Pinero was almost the only original playwright represented\r\nunder the Bancroft, Hare-Kendal and Clayton-Cecil managements, which\r\nrelied for the rest upon adaptations and revivals. Adaptations of French\r\nvaudevilles were the staple productions of Charles Wyndham's management\r\nat the Criterion from its beginning in 1876 until 1893, when he first\r\nproduced an original play of any importance. When Herbert Beerbohm Tree\r\nwent into management at the Haymarket in 1887, he still relied largely\r\non plays of foreign origin. George Alexander's first managerial ventures\r\n(Avenue theatre, 1890) were two adaptations from the French. Until well\r\non in the 'eighties, indeed, adaptation from the French was held the\r\nnormal occupation of the British playwright, and original composition a\r\nmere episode. Robertson, Byron, Albery, Gilbert, Tom Taylor, Charles\r\nReade, Herman Merivale, G. W. Godfrey, all produced numerous\r\nadaptations; Sydney Grundy was for twenty years occupied almost\r\nexclusively in this class of work; Pinero himself has adapted more than\r\none French play. The 'eighties, then, may on the whole be regarded as\r\nshowing a very gradual decline in the predominance of France on the\r\nEnglish stage, and an equally slow revival of originality, so far as\r\ncomedy and drama were concerned, manifesting itself mainly in the plays\r\nof Pinero.\r\n\r\nThe reaction against French influence, however, was no less apparent in\r\nthe domain of melodrama and operetta than in that of comedy and drama.\r\nUntil well on in the 'seventies, D'Ennery and his disciples, adapted and\r\nimitated by Dion Boucicault and others, ruled the melodramatic stage.\r\nThe reaction asserted itself in two quarters--in the East End at the\r\nGrecian theatre, and in the West End at the Princess's. In _The World_,\r\nproduced at Drury Lane in 1880, Paul Meritt (d. 1895) and Henry Pettitt\r\n(d. 1893) brought to the West End the \"Grecian\" type of popular drama;\r\nand at Drury Lane it survived in the elaborately spectacular form\r\nimparted to it by Sir Augustus Harris, who managed that theatre from\r\n1879 till his death in 1896. The production of G. R. Sims's _Lights o'\r\nLondon_ at the Princess's in 1881, under Wilson Barrett's management,\r\nalso marked a new departure. This style of melodrama was chiefly\r\ncultivated at the Adelphi theatre, from 1882 until the end of the\r\ncentury, when it died out there as a regular institution, apparently\r\nbecause a host of suburban theatres drew away its audiences. Of all\r\nthese English melodramas, only one, _The Silver King_, by Henry Arthur\r\nJones (Princess's, 1882), could for a moment compare in invention or\r\ntechnical skill with the French dramas they supplanted. The fact\r\nremains, however, that even on this lowest level of dramatic art the\r\ncurrent of the time set decisively towards home-made pictures of English\r\nlife, however crude and puerile.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years, from 1865 to 1890, the English stage was overrun\r\nwith French operettas of the school of Offenbach. Hastily adapted by\r\nslovenly hacks, their librettos (often witty in the original) became\r\nincredible farragos of metreless doggrel and punning ineptitude. The\r\ngreat majority of them are now so utterly forgotten that it is hard to\r\nrealize how, in their heyday, they swarmed on every hand in London and\r\nthe provinces. The reaction began in 1875 with the performance at the\r\nRoyalty theatre of _Trial by Jury_, by W. S. Gilbert and Arthur\r\nSullivan. This was the prelude to that brilliant series of witty and\r\nmelodious extravaganzas which began with _The Sorcerer_ at the Opera\r\nComique theatre in 1877, but was mainly associated with the Savoy\r\ntheatre, opened by R. D'Oyly Carte (d. 1901) in 1881. Little by little\r\nthe Gilbert and Sullivan operettas (of which the most famous, perhaps,\r\nwere _H.M.S. Pinafore_, 1878, _Patience_, 1881, and _The Mikado_, 1885)\r\nundermined the popularity of the French opera-bouffes, and at the same\r\ntime that of the indigenous \"burlesques\" which, graceful enough in the\r\nhands of their inventor J. R. Planché, had become mere incoherent\r\njumbles of buffoonery, devoid alike of dramatic ingenuity and of\r\nliterary form. When, early in the 'nineties, the collaboration between\r\nGilbert and Sullivan became intermittent, and the vogue of the Savoy\r\nsomewhat declined, a new class of extravaganza arose, under the\r\ndesignation of \"musical comedy\" or \"musical farce.\" It first took form\r\nin a piece called _In Town_, by Messrs \"Adrian Ross\" and Osmond Carr\r\n(Prince of Wales's theatre, 1892), and rapidly became very popular. In\r\nthese plays the scene and costumes are almost always modern though\r\nsometimes exotic, and the prose dialogue, setting forth an attenuated\r\nand entirely negligible plot, is frequently interrupted by musical\r\nnumbers. The lyrics are often very clever pieces of rhyming, totally\r\ndifferent from the inane doggrel of the old opera-bouffes and\r\nburlesques. In other respects there is little to be said for the\r\nliterary or intellectual quality of \"musical farce\"; but, being an\r\nentirely English (or Anglo-American) product, it falls into line with\r\nthe other indications we have noted of the general decline--one might\r\nalmost say extinction--of French influence on the English stage.\r\n\r\nTo what causes are we to trace this gradual disuse of adaptation? In the\r\ndomain of modern comedy and drama, to two causes acting simultaneously:\r\nthe decline in France of the method of Scribe, which produced\r\n\"well-made,\" exportable plays, more or less suited to any climate and\r\nenvironment; and the rise in England of a generation of playwrights more\r\noriginal, thoughtful and able than their predecessors. It is not at all\r\nto be taken for granted that the falling off in the supply of exportable\r\nplays meant a decline in the absolute merit of French drama. The\r\nhistorian of the future may very possibly regard the movement in France,\r\nno less than the movement in England, as a step in advance, and may even\r\nsee in the two movements co-ordinate manifestations of one tendency. Be\r\nthis as it may, the fact is certain that as the playwrights of the\r\nSecond Empire gradually died off, and were succeeded by the authors of\r\nthe \"new comedy,\" plays which would bear transplantation became ever\r\nfewer and farther between. Of recent years Henri Bernstein, author of\r\n_Le Voleur_ and _Samson_, has been almost the only French dramatist\r\nwhose works have found a ready and steady market in England. Attempts to\r\nacclimatize French poetical drama--_Pour la Couronne_, _Le Chemineau_,\r\n_Cyrano de Bergerac_--were all more or less unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nHaving noted the decline of adaptation, we may now trace a stage farther\r\nthe development of the English drama. The first stage, already surveyed,\r\nends with the production of _Sweet Lavender_ in 1888. Up to this point\r\nits author, Pinero (b. 1855), stood practically alone, and had won his\r\nchief successes as a humorist. Henry Arthur Jones (b. 1851) was known as\r\nlittle more than an able melodramatist, though in one play, _Saints and\r\nSinners_ (1884), he had made some attempt at a serious study of\r\nprovincial life. R. C. Carton (b. 1856) had written, in collaboration,\r\none or two plays of slight account. Sydney Grundy (b. 1848) had produced\r\nscarcely any original work. The second stage may be taken as extending\r\nfrom 1889 to 1893. On the 24th of April 1889 John Hare opened the new\r\nGarrick theatre with _The Profligate_, by Pinero--an unripe and\r\nsuperficial piece of work in many ways, but still a great advance, both\r\nin ambition and achievement, upon any original work the stage had seen\r\nfor many a year.\r\n\r\nWith all its faults, it may be said that _The Profligate_ notably\r\nenlarged at one stroke the domain open to the English dramatist. And it\r\ndid not stand alone. The same year saw the production of two plays by H.\r\nA. Jones, _Wealth_ and _The Middleman_, in which a distinct effort\r\ntowards a serious criticism of life was observable, and of two plays by\r\nSydney Grundy, _A Fool's Paradise_ and _A White Lie_, which, though very\r\nFrench in method, were at least original in substance. Jones during the\r\nnext two years made a steady advance with _Judah_ (1890), _The Dancing\r\nGirl_ and _The Crusaders_ (1891). Pinero in these years was putting\r\nforth less than his whole strength in _The Cabinet Minister_ (1890),\r\n_Lady Bountiful_ and _The Times_ (1891), and _The Amazons_ (March 1893).\r\nBut meanwhile new talents were coming forward. The management of George\r\nAlexander, which opened at the Avenue theatre in 1890, but was\r\ntransferred in the following year to the St James's, brought prominently\r\nto the front R. C. Carton, Haddon Chambers and Oscar Wilde. Carton's two\r\nsentimental comedies, _Sunlight and Shadow_ (1890) and _Liberty Hall_\r\n(1892), showed excellent workmanship, but did not yet reveal his true\r\noriginality as a humorist. Haddon Chambers's work (notably _The Idler_,\r\n1891) was as yet sufficiently commonplace; but in _Lady Windermere's\r\nFan_ (1892) Oscar Wilde showed himself at his first attempt a brilliant\r\nand accomplished dramatist. Wilde's subsequent plays, _A Woman of No\r\nImportance_ (1893) and _An Ideal Husband_ and _The Importance of being\r\nEarnest_ (1895), though marred by mannerism and insincerity, did much to\r\npromote the movement we are here tracing.\r\n\r\nAs the production of _The Profligate_ marked the opening of the second\r\nperiod in the revival of English drama, so the production of the same\r\nauthor's _The Second Mrs Tanqueray_ is very clearly the starting-point\r\nof the third period. Before attempting to trace its course we may do\r\nwell to glance at certain conditions which probably influenced it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, economic conditions. The Bancroft-Robertson movement\r\nat the old Prince of Wales's, between 1865 and 1870, was of even more\r\nimportance from an economic than from a literary point of view. By\r\nmaking their little theatre a luxurious place of resort, and faithfully\r\nimitating in their productions the accent, costume and furniture of\r\nupper and upper-middle class life, the Bancrofts had initiated a\r\nreconciliation between society and the stage. Throughout the middle\r\ndecades of the century it was the constant complaint of the managers\r\nthat the world of wealth and fashion could not be tempted to the\r\ntheatre. The Bancroft management changed all that. It was at the Prince\r\nof Wales's that half-guinea stalls were first introduced; and these\r\nstalls were always filled. As other theatres adopted the same policy of\r\nupholstery, both on and off the stage, fashion extended its complaisance\r\nto them as well. In yet another way the reconciliation was promoted--by\r\nthe ever-increasing tendency of young men and women of good birth and\r\neducation to seek a career upon the English stage. The theatre, in\r\nshort, became at this period one of the favourite amusements of\r\nfashionable (though scarcely of intellectual) society in London. It is\r\noften contended that the influence of the sensual and cynical stall\r\naudience is a pernicious one. In some ways, no doubt, it is detrimental;\r\nbut there is another side to the case. Even the cynicism of society\r\nmarks an intellectual advance upon the sheer rusticity which prevailed\r\nduring the middle years of the 19th century and accepted without a\r\nmurmur plays (original and adapted) which bore no sort of relation to\r\nlife. In a celebrated essay published in 1879, Matthew Arnold (whose\r\noccasional dramatic criticisms were very influential in intellectual\r\ncircles) dwelt on the sufficiently obvious fact that the result of\r\ngiving English names and costumes to French characters was to make their\r\nsayings and doings utterly unreal and \"fantastic.\" During the years of\r\nFrench ascendancy, audiences had quite forgotten that it was possible\r\nfor the stage to be other than \"fantastic\" in this sense. They no\r\nlonger thought of comparing the mimic world with the real world, but\r\nwere content with what may be called abstract humour and pathos, often\r\nof the crudest quality. The cultivation of external realism, coinciding\r\nwith, and in part occasioning, the return of society to the playhouse,\r\ngradually led to a demand for some approach to plausibility in character\r\nand action as well as in costume and decoration. The stage ceased to be\r\nentirely \"fantastic,\" and began to essay, however imperfectly, the\r\nrepresentation, the criticism of life. It cannot be denied that the\r\ninfluence of society tended to narrow the outlook of English dramatists\r\nand to trivialize their tone of thought. But this was a passing phase of\r\ndevelopment; and cleverly trivial representations of reality are, after\r\nall, to be preferred to brainless concoctions of sheer emptiness.\r\n\r\nQuite as important, from the economic point of view, as the\r\nreconciliation of society to the stage, was the reorganization of the\r\nmechanism of theatrical life in the provinces which took place between\r\n1865 and 1875. From the Restoration to the middle of the 19th century\r\nthe system of \"stock companies\" had been universal. Every great town in\r\nthe three kingdoms had its established theatre with a resident company,\r\nplaying the \"legitimate\" repertory, and competing, often by illegitimate\r\nmeans, for the possession of new London successes. The smaller towns,\r\nand even villages, were grouped into local \"circuits,\" each served by\r\none manager with his troupe of strollers. The \"circuits\" supplied actors\r\nto the resident stock companies, and the stock companies served as\r\nnurseries to the patent theatres in London. Metropolitan \"stars\"\r\ntravelled from one country theatre to another, generally alone,\r\nsometimes with one or two subordinates in their train, and were\r\n\"supported,\" as the phrase went, by the stock company of each theatre.\r\nUnder this system, scenery, costumes and appointments were often\r\ngrotesquely inadequate, and performances almost always rough and\r\nunfinished. On the other hand, the constant practice in a great number\r\nand variety of characters afforded valuable training for actors, and\r\ndeveloped many remarkable talents. As a source of revenue to authors,\r\nthe provinces were practically negligible. Stageright was unprotected by\r\nlaw; and even if it had been protected, it is doubtful whether authors\r\ncould have got any considerable fees out of country managers, whose\r\nprecarious ventures usually left them a small enough margin of profit.\r\n\r\nThe spread of railways throughout the country gradually put an end to\r\nthis system. The \"circuits\" disappeared early in the 'fifties, the stock\r\ncompanies survived until about the middle of the 'seventies. As soon as\r\nit was found easy to transport whole companies, and even great\r\nquantities of scenery, from theatre to theatre throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Great Britain, it became apparent that the rough makeshifts\r\nof the stock company system were doomed. Here again we can trace to the\r\nold Prince of Wales's theatre the first distinct impulse towards the new\r\norder of things. Robertson's comedies not only encouraged but absolutely\r\nrequired a style of art, in mounting, stage-management and acting, not\r\nto be found in the country theatres. To entrust them to the stock\r\ncompanies was well-nigh impossible. On the other hand, to quote Sir\r\nSquire Bancroft, \"perhaps no play was ever better suited than _Caste_ to\r\na travelling company; the parts being few, the scenery and dresses quite\r\nsimple, and consequently the expenses very much reduced.\" In 1867, then,\r\na company was organized and rehearsed in London to carry round the\r\nprovincial theatres as exact a reproduction as possible of the London\r\nperformance of _Caste_ and Robertson's other comedies. The smoothness of\r\nthe representation, the delicacy of the interplay among the characters,\r\nwere new to provincial audiences, and the success was remarkable. About\r\nthe same time the whole Haymarket company, under Buckstone's management,\r\nbegan to make frequent rounds of the country theatres; and other\r\n\"touring combinations\" were soon organized. It is manifest that the\r\n\"combination\" system and the stock company system cannot long coexist,\r\nfor a manager cannot afford to keep a stock company idle while a London\r\ncombination is occupying his theatre. The stock companies, therefore,\r\nsoon dwindled away, and were probably quite extinct before the end of\r\nthe 'seventies. Under the present system, no sooner is a play an\r\nestablished success in London than it is reproduced in one, two or three\r\nexact copies and sent round the provincial theatres (and the numerous\r\nsuburban theatres which have sprung up since 1895), Company A serving\r\nfirst-class towns, Company B the second-class towns, and so forth. The\r\nprocess is very like that of taking plaster casts of a statue, and the\r\nprovincial companies often stand to their London originals very much in\r\nthe relation of plaster to marble. Even the London scenery is faithfully\r\nreproduced in material of extra strength, to stand the wear-and-tear of\r\nconstant removal. The result is that, instead of the square pegs in\r\nround holes of the old stock company system, provincial audiences now\r\nsee pegs carefully adjusted to the particular holes they occupy, and\r\noften incapable of fitting any other. Instead of the rough performances\r\nof old, they are now accustomed to performances of a mechanical and\r\nsoulless smoothness.\r\n\r\nIn some ways the gain in this respect is undeniable, in other ways the\r\nloss is great. The provinces are no longer, in any effective sense, a\r\nnursery of fresh talents for the London theatres, for the art acquired\r\nin touring combinations is that of mimicry rather than of acting.\r\nMoreover, provincial playgoers have lost all personal interest and pride\r\nin their local theatres, which have no longer any individuality of their\r\nown, but serve as a mere frame for the presentation of a series of\r\nready-made London pictures. Christmas pantomime is the only theatrical\r\nproduct that has any really local flavour in it, and even this is often\r\nonly a second-hand London production, touched up with a few topical\r\nallusions. Again, the railways which bring London productions to the\r\ncountry take country playgoers by the thousand to London. The wealthier\r\nclasses, in the Lancashire, Yorkshire and Midland towns at any rate, do\r\nalmost all their theatre-going in London, or during the autumn months\r\nwhen the leading London companies go on tour. Thus the better class of\r\ncomedy and drama has a hard fight to maintain itself in the provinces,\r\nand the companies devoted to melodrama and musical farce enjoy an\r\nominous preponderance of popularity.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however--and this is the main point to be observed with\r\nregard to the literary development of the drama--the economic movement\r\nof the five- and twenty years between 1865 and 1890 was enormously to\r\nthe advantage of the dramatic author. A London success meant a long\r\nseries of full houses at high prices, on which he took a handsome\r\npercentage. The provinces, in which a popular playwright would often\r\nhave three or four plays going the rounds simultaneously, became a\r\nsteady source of income. And, finally, it was found possible, even\r\nbefore international copyright came into force, to protect stageright in\r\nthe United States, so that about the beginning of the 'eighties large\r\nreceipts began to pour in from America. Thus successful dramatists,\r\ninstead of living from hand to mouth, like their predecessors of the\r\nprevious generation, found themselves in comfortable and even opulent\r\ncircumstances. They had leisure for reading, thought and careful\r\ncomposition, and they could afford to gratify their ambition with an\r\noccasional artistic experiment. Failure might mean a momentary loss of\r\nprestige, but it would not spell ruin. A distinctly progressive spirit,\r\nthen, began to animate the leading English dramatists--a spirit which\r\nfound intelligent sympathy in such managers as John Hare, George\r\nAlexander, Beerbohm Tree and Charles Wyndham. Nor must it be forgotten\r\nthat, though the laws of literary property, internal and international,\r\nremained far from perfect, it was found possible to print and publish\r\nplays without incurring loss of stageright either at home or in America.\r\nThe playwrights of the present generation have accordingly a motive for\r\ngiving literary form and polish to their work which was quite\r\ninoperative with their predecessors, whose productions were either kept\r\njealously in manuscript or printed only in miserable and totally\r\nunreadable stage editions. It is no small stimulus to ambition to know\r\nthat even if a play prove to be in advance of the standards of taste or\r\nthought among the public to which it is originally presented, it will\r\nnot perish utterly, but will, if it have any inherent vitality, continue\r\nto live as literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of foreign drama.\r\n\r\nHaving now summed up the economic conditions which made for progress,\r\nlet us glance at certain intellectual influences which tended in the\r\nsame direction. The establishment of the Théâtre Libre in Paris, towards\r\nthe close of 1887, unquestionably marked the beginning of a period of\r\nrestless experiment throughout the theatrical world of Europe. A.\r\nAntoine and his supporters were in open rebellion against the artificial\r\nmethods of Scribe and the Second Empire playwrights. Their effort was to\r\ntransfer to the stage the realism, the so-called \"naturalism,\" which had\r\nbeen dominant in French fiction since 1870 or earlier; and this\r\nnaturalism was doubtless, in its turn, the outcome of the scientific\r\nmovement of the century. New methods (or ideals) of observation, and new\r\nviews as to the history and destiny of the race, could not fail to\r\nproduce a profound effect upon art; and though the modern theatre is a\r\ncumbrous contrivance, slow to adjust its orientation to the winds of the\r\nspirit, even it at last began to revolve, like a rusty windmill, so as\r\nto fill its sails in the main current of the intellectual atmosphere.\r\nWithin three or four years of its inception, Antoine's experiment had\r\nbeen imitated in Germany, England and America. The \"Freie Bühne\" of\r\nBerlin came into existence in 1889, the Independent Theatre of London in\r\n1891. Similar enterprises were set on foot in Munich and other cities.\r\nIn America several less formal experiments of a like nature were\r\nattempted, chiefly in Boston and New York. Nor must it be forgotten that\r\nin Paris itself the Théâtre Libre did not stand alone. Many other\r\n_théâtres à côté_ sprang up, under such titles as \"Théâtre d'Art,\"\r\n\"Théâtre Moderne,\" \"Théâtre de l'Avenir Dramatique.\" The most important\r\nand least ephemeral was the \"Théâtre de l'OEuvre,\" founded in 1893 by\r\nAlex. Lugné-Poë, which represented mainly, though not exclusively, the\r\nsymbolist reaction against naturalism.\r\n\r\nThe impulse which led to the establishment of the Théâtre Libre was, in\r\nthe first instance, entirely French. If any foreign influence helped to\r\nshape its course, it was that of the great Russian novelists. Tolstoi's\r\n_Puissance des ténèbres_ was the only \"exotic\" play announced in\r\nAntoine's opening manifesto. But the whole movement was soon to receive\r\na potent stimulus from the Norwegian poet Henrik Ibsen.\r\n\r\nIbsen's early romantic plays had been known in Germany since 1875. In\r\n1878 _Pillars of Society_ and in 1880 _A Doll's House_ achieved wide\r\npopularity, and held the German stage side by side with _A Bankruptcy_,\r\nby Björnstjerne Björnson. But these plays had little influence on the\r\nGerman drama. Their methods were, indeed, not essentially different from\r\nthose of the French school of the Second Empire, which were then\r\ndominant in Germany as well as everywhere else. It was _Ghosts_ (acted\r\nin Augsburg and Meiningen 1886, in Berlin 1887) that gave the impulse\r\nwhich, coalescing with the kindred impulse from the French Théâtre\r\nLibre, was destined in the course of a few years to create a new\r\ndramatic literature in Germany. During the middle decades of the century\r\nGermany had produced some dramatists of solid and even remarkable\r\ntalent, such as Friedrich Hebbel, Heinrich Laube, Karl Gutzkow and\r\nGustav Freytag. Even the generation which held the stage after 1870, and\r\nincluded Paul Heyse, Paul Lindau and Adolf Wilbrandt, with numerous\r\nwriters of light comedy and farce, such as E. Wichert, O. Blumenthal, G.\r\nvon Moser, A. L'Arronge and F. von Schönthan, had produced a good many\r\nworks of some merit. But, in the main, French artificiality and\r\nfrivolity predominated on the German stage. In point of native talent\r\nand originality, the Austrian popular playwright Ludwig Anzengruber was\r\nwell ahead of his North German contemporaries. It was in 1889, with the\r\nestablishment of the Berlin Freie Bühne, that the reaction definitely\r\nset in. In Berlin, as afterwards in London, _Ghosts_ was the first play\r\nproduced on the outpost stage, but it was followed in Berlin by a very\r\nrapid development of native talent. Less than a month after the\r\nperformance of Ibsen's play, Gerhart Hauptmann came to the front with\r\n_Vor Sonnenaufgang_, an immature piece of almost unrelieved Zolaism,\r\nwhich he soon followed up, however, with much more important works. In\r\n_Das Friedensfest_ (1890) and _Einsame Menschen_ (1891) he transferred\r\nhis allegiance from Zola to Ibsen. His true originality first manifested\r\nitself in _Die Weber_ (1892); and subsequently he produced plays in\r\nseveral different styles, all bearing the stamp of a potent\r\nindividuality. His most popular productions have been the dramatic poems\r\n_Hannele_ and _Die versunkene Glocke_, the low-life comedy _Der\r\nBiberpelz_, and the low-life tragedy _Fuhrmann Henschel_. Other\r\nremarkable playwrights belonging to the Freie Bühne group are Max Halbe\r\n(b. 1865), author of _Jugend_ and _Mutter Erde_, and Otto Erich\r\nHartleben (b. 1864), author of _Hanna Jagert_ and _Rosenmontag_. These\r\nyoung men, however, so quickly gained the ear of the general public,\r\nthat the need for a special \"free stage\" was no longer felt, and the\r\nFreie Bühne, having done its work, ceased to exist. Unlike the French\r\nThéâtre Libre and the English Independent theatre, it had been supported\r\nfrom the outset by the most influential critics, and had won the day\r\nalmost without a battle. The productions of the new school soon made\r\ntheir way even into some of the subventioned theatres; but it was the\r\nunsubventioned Deutsches Theater of Berlin that most vigorously\r\ncontinued the tradition of the Freie Bühne. One or two playwrights of\r\nthe new generation, however, did not actually belong to the Freie Bühne\r\ngroup. Hermann Sudermann produced his first play, _Die Ehre_, in 1888,\r\nand his most famous work, _Heimat_, in 1892. In him the influence of\r\nIbsen is very clearly perceptible; while Arthur Schnitzler of Vienna,\r\nauthor of _Liebelei_, may rather be said to derive his inspiration from\r\nthe Parisian \"new comedy.\" Originality, verging sometimes on\r\nabnormality, distinguishes the work of Frank Wedekind (b. 1864), author\r\nof _Erdgeist_ and _Frühlingserwachen_. Hugo von Hofmannsthal (b. 1874),\r\nin his _Elektra_ and _Ödipus_, rehandles classic themes in the light of\r\nmodern anthropology and psychology.\r\n\r\nThe promoters of the Théâtre Libre had probably never heard of Ibsen\r\nwhen they established that institution, but three years later his fame\r\nhad reached France, and _Les Revenants_ was produced by the Théâtre\r\nLibre (29th May 1890). Within the next two or three years almost all his\r\nmodern plays were acted in Paris, most of them either by the Théâtre\r\nLibre or by L'OEuvre. Close upon the heels of the Ibsen influence\r\nfollowed another, less potent, but by no means negligible. The exquisite\r\ntragic symbolism of Maurice Maeterlinck began to find numerous admirers\r\nabout 1890. In 1891 his one-act play _L'Intruse_ was acted; in 1893,\r\n_Pelléas et Mélisande_. By this time, too, the reverberation of the\r\nimpulse which the Théâtre Libre had given to the Freie Bühne began to be\r\nfelt in France. In 1893 Hauptmann's _Die Weber_ was acted in Paris, and,\r\nbeing frequently repeated, made a deep and lasting impression.\r\n\r\nThe English analogue to the Théâtre Libre, the Independent theatre,\r\nopened its first season (March 13, 1891) with a performance of _Ghosts_.\r\nThis was not, however, the first introduction of Ibsen to the English\r\nstage. On the 7th of June 1889 (six weeks after the production of _The\r\nProfligate_) _A Doll's House_ was acted at the Novelty theatre, and ran\r\nfor three weeks, amid a storm of critical controversy. In the same year\r\n_Pillars of Society_ was presented in London. In 1891 and 1892 _A Doll's\r\nHouse_ was frequently acted; _Rosmersholm_ was produced in 1891, and\r\nagain in 1893; in May and June 1891 _Hedda Gabler_ had a run of several\r\nweeks; and early in 1893 _The Master Builder_ enjoyed a similar passing\r\nvogue. During these years, then, Ibsen was very much \"in the air\" in\r\nEngland, as well as in France and Germany. The Independent theatre, in\r\nthe meantime, under the management of J. T. Grein, found but scanty\r\nmaterial to deal with. It presented translations of Zola's _Thérèse\r\nRaquin_, and of _A Visit_, by the Danish dramatist Edward Brandes; but\r\nit brought to the front only one English author of any note, in the\r\nperson of George Bernard Shaw, whose \"didactic realistic play,\"\r\n_Widowers' Houses_, it produced in December 1892.\r\n\r\nNone the less is it true that the ferment of fresh energy, which between\r\n1887 and 1893 had created a new dramatic literature both in France and\r\nin Germany, was distinctly felt in England as well. England did not take\r\nat all kindly to it. The productions of Ibsen's plays, in particular,\r\nwere received with an outcry of reprobation. A great part of this\r\nclamour was due to sheer misunderstanding; but some of it, no doubt,\r\narose from genuine and deep-seated distaste. As for the dramatists of\r\nrecognized standing, they one and all, both from policy and from\r\nconviction, adopted a hostile attitude towards Ibsen, expressing at most\r\na theoretical respect overborne by practical dislike. Yet his influence\r\npermeated the atmosphere. He had revealed possibilities of technical\r\nstagecraft and psychological delineation that, once realized, were not\r\nto be banished from the mind of the thoughtful playwright. They haunted\r\nhim in spite of himself. Still subtler was the influence exerted over\r\nthe critics and the more intelligent public. Deeply and genuinely as\r\nmany of them disliked Ibsen's works, they found, when they returned to\r\nthe old-fashioned play, the adapted frivolity or the homegrown\r\nsentimentalism, that they disliked this still more. On every side, then,\r\nthere was an instinctive or deliberate reaching forward towards\r\nsomething new; and once again it was Pinero who ventured the decisive\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of May 1893 _The Second Mrs Tanqueray_ was produced at the\r\nSt James's theatre. With _The Second Mrs Tanqueray_ the English acted\r\ndrama ceased to be a merely insular product, and took rank in the\r\nliterature of Europe. Here was a play which, whatever its faults, was\r\nobviously comparable with the plays of Dumas, of Sudermann, of Björnson,\r\nof Echegaray. It might be better than some of these plays, worse than\r\nothers; but it stood on the same artistic level. The fact that such a\r\nplay could not only be produced, but could brilliantly succeed, on the\r\nLondon stage gave a potent stimulus to progress. It encouraged ambition\r\nin authors, enterprise in managers. What _Hernani_ was to the romantic\r\nmovement of the 'thirties, and _La Dame aux camélias_ to the realistic\r\nmovement of the 'fifties, _The Second Mrs Tanqueray_ was to the movement\r\nof the 'nineties towards the serious stage-portraiture of English social\r\nlife. All the forces which we have been tracing--Robertsonian realism of\r\nexternals, the leisure for thought and experiment involved in vastly\r\nimproved financial conditions, the substitution in France of a simpler,\r\nsubtler technique for the outworn artifices of the Scribe school, and\r\nthe electric thrill communicated to the whole theatrical life of Europe\r\nby contact with the genius of Ibsen--all these slowly converging forces\r\ncoalesced to produce, in _The Second Mrs Tanqueray_, an epoch-marking\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nPinero followed up _Mrs Tanqueray_ with a remarkable series of\r\nplays--_The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith_, _The Benefit of the Doubt_, _The\r\nPrincess and the Butterfly_, _Trelawny of the \"Wells_,\" _The Gay Lord\r\nQuex_, _Iris_, _Letty_, _His House in Order_ and _The Thunderbolt_--all\r\nof which show marked originality of conception and intellectual force.\r\nIn January 1893 Charles Wyndham initiated a new policy at the Criterion\r\ntheatre, and produced an original play, _The Bauble-Shop_, by Henry\r\nArthur Jones. It belonged very distinctly to the pre-Tanqueray order of\r\nthings; but the same author's _The Case of Rebellious Susan_, in the\r\nfollowing year, showed an almost startlingly sudden access of talent,\r\nwhich was well maintained in such later works as _Michael and his Lost\r\nAngel_ (1896), that admirable comedy _The Liars_ (1897), and _Mrs Dane's\r\nDefence_ (1900). Sydney Grundy produced after 1893 by far his most\r\nimportant original works, _The Greatest of These_ (1896) and _The Debt\r\nof Honour_ (1900). R. C. Carton, breaking away from the somewhat\r\nlaboured sentimentalism of his earlier manner, produced several light\r\ncomedies of thoroughly original humour and of excellent literary\r\nworkmanship--_Lord and Lady Algy_, _Wheels within Wheels_, _Lady\r\nHuntworth's Experiment_, _Mr Hopkinson_ and _Mr Preedy and the\r\nCountess_. Haddon Chambers, in _The Tyranny of Tears_ (1899) and _The\r\nAwakening_ (1901), produced two plays of a merit scarcely foreshadowed\r\nin his earlier efforts.\r\n\r\nWhat was of more importance, a new generation of playwrights came to the\r\nfront. Its most notable representatives were J. M. Barrie, who displayed\r\nhis inexhaustible gift of humorous observation and invention in _Quality\r\nStreet_ (1902), _The Admirable Crichton_ (1903), _Little Mary_ (1903),\r\n_Peter Pan_ (1904), _Alice Sit-by-the-Fire_ (1905) and _What Every Woman\r\nKnows_ (1908); Mrs Craigie (\"John Oliver Hobbes\"), who produced in _The\r\nAmbassador_ (1898) a comedy of fine accomplishment; and H. V. Esmond,\r\nAlfred Sutro, Hubert Henry Davies, W. S. Maugham, Rudolf Besier, Roy\r\nHorniman and J. B. Fagan.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the efforts to relieve the drama from the pressure of the\r\nlong-run system had not been confined to the Independent theatre.\r\nSeveral other enterprises of a like nature had proved more or less\r\nshort-lived; but the Stage Society, founded in 1900, was conducted with\r\nmore energy and perseverance, and became a real force in the dramatic\r\nworld. After two seasons devoted mainly to Bernard Shaw, Ibsen,\r\nMaeterlinck and Hauptmann, it produced in its third season _The Marrying\r\nof Ann Leete_, by Granville Barker (b. 1877), who had developed in its\r\nservice his remarkable gifts as a producer of plays. A year or two\r\nlater, Barker staged for another organization, the New Century theatre,\r\nProfessor Gilbert Murray's rendering of the _Hippolytus_ of Euripides;\r\nand it was partly the success of this production that suggested the\r\nVedrenne-Barker partnership at the Court theatre, which, between 1904\r\nand 1907, gave an extraordinary impulse to the intellectual life of the\r\ntheatre. Adopting the \"short-run\" system, as a compromise between the\r\nlong-run and the repertory systems, the Vedrenne-Barker management made\r\nthe plays of Bernard Shaw (both old and new) for the first time really\r\npopular. Of the plays already published _You Never Can Tell_ and _Man\r\nand Superman_ were the most successful; of the new plays, _John Bull's\r\nOther Island_, _Major Barbara_ and _The Doctor's Dilemma_. But though\r\nShaw was the mainstay of the enterprise, it gave opportunities to\r\nseveral other writers, the most notable being John Galsworthy (b. 1867),\r\nauthor of _The Silver Box_ and _Strife_, St John Hankin (1869-1909),\r\nauthor of _The Return of the Prodigal_ and _The Charity that began at\r\nHome_, and Granville Barker himself, whose plays _The Voysey\r\nInheritance_ and _Waste_ (1907) were among the most important products\r\nof this movement. It should also be noted that the production of the\r\n_Hippolytus_ was followed up by the production of the _Trojan Women_,\r\nthe _Electra_ and the _Medea_ of Euripides, all translated by Gilbert\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to which were due the Independent theatre, the Stage Society\r\nand the Vedrenne-Barker management, combined with local influences to\r\nbring about the foundation in Dublin of the Irish National theatre. Its\r\nmoving spirit was the poet W. B. Yeats (b. 1865), who wrote for it\r\n_Cathleen-ni-Hoolihan_, _The Hour-Glass_, _The King's Threshold_ and one\r\nor two other plays. Lady Gregory, Padraic Collum, Boyle and other\r\nauthors also contributed to the repertory of this admirable little\r\ntheatre; but its most notable products were the plays of J. M. Synge\r\n(1871-1909), whose _Riders to the Sea_, _Well of the Saints_ and\r\n_Playboy of the Western World_ showed a fine and original dramatic\r\nfaculty combined with extraordinary beauty of style.\r\n\r\nBoth in Manchester and in Glasgow endeavours have been made, with\r\nconsiderable success, to counteract the evils of the touring system, by\r\nthe establishment of resident companies acting the better class of\r\nmodern plays on a \"short-run\" plan, similar to that of the\r\nVedrenne-Barker management. The Manchester enterprise was to some extent\r\nsubsidized by Miss E. Horniman, and may therefore claim to be the first\r\nendowed theatre in England. The need for endowment on a much larger\r\nscale was, however, strongly advocated in the early years of the 20th\r\ncentury by the more progressive supporters of English drama, and in 1908\r\nfound a place in the scheme for a Shakespeare National theatre, which\r\nwas then superimposed on the earlier proposal for a memorial\r\ncommemorating the Shakespeare tercentenary, organized by an influential\r\ncommittee under the chairmanship of the Lord Mayor of London. The scheme\r\ninvolved the raising of £500,000, half to be devoted to the requisite\r\nsite and building, while the remainder would be invested so as to\r\nfurnish an annual subvention.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say a few words of the English literary drama, as opposed\r\nto the acted drama. The two classes are not nearly so distinct as they\r\nonce were; but plays continue to be produced from time to time which are\r\nwholly unfitted for the theatre, and others which, though they may be\r\nexperimentally placed on the stage, make their appeal rather to the\r\nreading public. Tennyson had essayed in his old age an art which is\r\nscarcely to be mastered after the energy of youth has passed. He\r\ncontinued to the last to occupy himself more or less with drama, and all\r\nhis plays, except _Harold_, found their way to the stage. _The Cup_ and\r\n_Becket_, as we have seen, met with a certain success, but _The Promise\r\nof May_ (1882), an essay in contemporary drama, was a disastrous\r\nfailure, while _The Falcon_ (1879) and _The Foresters_ (acted by an\r\nAmerican company in 1893) made little impression. Lord Tennyson was\r\ncertainly not lacking in dramatic faculty, but he worked in an outworn\r\nform which he had no longer the strength to renovate. Swinburne\r\ncontinued now and then to cast his creations in the dramatic mould, but\r\nit cannot be said that his dramas attained either the vitality or the\r\npopularity of his lyrical poems. _Mary Stuart_ (1881) brought his Marian\r\ntrilogy to a close. In _Locrine_ he produced a tragedy in heroic\r\ncouplets--a thing probably unattempted since the age of Dryden. _The\r\nSisters_ is a tragedy of modern date with a medieval drama inserted by\r\nway of interlude. _Rosamund, Queen of the Lombards_ (1899), perhaps\r\napproached more nearly than any of his former works to the concentration\r\nessential to drama. It may be doubted, however, whether his copious and\r\nebullient style could ever really subject itself to the trammels of\r\ndramatic form. Of other dramas on the Elizabethan model, the most\r\nnotable, perhaps, were the works of two ladies who adopt the pseudonym\r\nof \"Michael Field\"; _Callirrhoë_ (1884), _Brutus Ultor_ (1887), and many\r\nother dramas, show considerable power of imagination and expression, but\r\nare burdened by a deliberate artificiality both of technique and style.\r\nAlfred Austin put forth several volumes in dramatic form, such as\r\n_Savonarola_ (1881), _Prince Lucifer_ (1887), _England's Darling_\r\n(1896), _Flodden Field_ (1905). They are laudable in intention and\r\nfluent in utterance. Notable additions to the purely literary drama were\r\nmade by Robert Bridges in his _Prometheus_ (1883), _Nero_ (1885), _The\r\nFeast of Bacchus_ (1889), and other solid plays in verse, full of\r\nscience and skill, but less charming than his lyrical poems. Sir Lewis\r\nMorris made a dramatic experiment in _Gycia_, but was not encouraged to\r\nrepeat it.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset of his career, John Davidson (1857-1909) was haunted by\r\nthe conviction that he was a born dramatist; but his earlier plays, such\r\nas _Smith: a Tragedy_ (1886), _Bruce: a Chronicle Play_ (1884) and\r\n_Scaramouch in Naxos_ (1888), contained more poetry than drama; and his\r\nlater pieces, such as _Self's the Man_ (1901), _The Theatrocrat_ (1905)\r\nand the _Triumph of Mammon_ (1907), showed a species of turbulent\r\nimagination, but became more and more fantastic and impracticable.\r\nStephen Phillips (b. 1867), on the other hand, having had some\r\nexperience as an actor, wrote always with the stage in view. In his\r\nfirst play, _Paolo and Francesca_ (1899; produced in 1902), he succeeded\r\nin combining great beauty of diction with intense dramatic power and\r\nvitality. The same may be said of _Herod_ (1900); but in _Ulysses_\r\n(1902) and _Nero_ (1906) a great falling-off in constructive power was\r\nonly partially redeemed by the fine inspiration of individual passages.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Robert Louis Stevenson with William Ernest Henley\r\nproduced a short series of interesting experiments in drama, two of\r\nwhich, _Beau Austin_ (1883) and _Admiral Guinea_ (1884), had more than a\r\nmerely experimental value. The former was an emotional comedy, treating\r\nwith rare distinction of touch a difficult, almost an impossible,\r\nsubject; the latter was a nautical melodrama, raised by force of\r\nimagination and diction into the region of literature. Incomparably the\r\nmost important of recent additions to the literary drama is Thomas\r\nHardy's vast panorama of the Napoleonic wars, entitled _The Dynasts_\r\n(1904-1908). It is rather an epic in dialogue than a play; but however\r\nwe may classify it we cannot but recognize its extraordinary\r\nintellectual and imaginative powers.\r\n\r\n_United States._--American dramatists have shown on their own account a\r\nprogressive tendency, quite as marked as that which we have been tracing\r\nin England. Down to about 1890 the influence of France had been even\r\nmore predominant in America than in England. The only American dramatist\r\nof eminence, Bronson Howard (1842-1908), was a disciple, though a very\r\nable one, of the French school. A certain stirring of native\r\noriginality manifested itself during the 'eighties, when a series of\r\nsemi-improvised farces, associated with the names of two actor-managers,\r\nHarrigan and Hart, depicted low life in New York with real observation,\r\nthough in a crude and formless manner. About the same time a native\r\nstyle of popular melodrama began to make its appearance--a play of\r\nconventional and negligible plot, which attracted by reason of one or\r\nmore faithfully observed character-types, generally taken from country\r\nlife. _The Old Homestead_, written by Denman Thompson, who himself acted\r\nin it, was the most popular play of this class. Rude as it was, it\r\ndistinctly foreshadowed that faithfulness to the external aspects, at\r\nany rate, of everyday life, in which lies the strength of the native\r\nAmerican drama. It was at a sort of free theatre in Boston that James A.\r\nHerne (1840-1901) produced in 1891 his realistic drama of modern life,\r\n_Margaret Fleming_, which did a great deal to awaken the interest of\r\nliterary America in the theatrical movement. Herne, an actor and a most\r\naccomplished stage-manager, next produced a drama of rural life in New\r\nEngland, _Shore Acres_ (1892), which made an immense popular success. It\r\nwas a play of the _Old Homestead_ type, but very much more coherent and\r\nartistic. His next play, _Griffith Davenport_ (1898), founded on a\r\nnovel, was a drama of life in Virginia during the Civil War, admirable\r\nin its strength and quiet sincerity; while in his last work, _Sag\r\nHarbour_ (1900), Herne returned to the study of rustic character, this\r\ntime in Long Island. Herne showed human nature in its more obvious and\r\nstraightforward aspects, making no attempt at psychological subtlety;\r\nbut within his own limits he was an admirable craftsman. The same\r\npreoccupation with local colour is manifest in the plays of Augustus M.\r\nThomas, a writer of genuine humour and originality. His localism\r\nannounces itself in the very titles of his most popular\r\nplays--_Alabama_, _In Mizzoura_, _Arizona_. He also made a striking\r\nsuccess in _The Witching Hour_, a play dealing with the phenomena of\r\nhypnotism and suggestion. Clyde Fitch (1865-1909), an immensely prolific\r\nplaywright of indubitable ability, after becoming known by some\r\nexperiments in quasi-historic drama (notably _Nathan Hale_, 1898;\r\n_Barbara Frietchie_, 1899), devoted himself mainly to social drama on\r\nthe French model, in which his most notable efforts have been _The\r\nClimbers_ (1900), _The Truth_ (1906), and _The Girl with the Green Eyes_\r\n(1902). In popular drama, with elaborate scenic illustration, William\r\nGillette (b. 1856), David Belasco (b. 1859) and Charles Klein (b. 1867)\r\nhave done notable work. William Vaughn Moody (b. 1869) produced in _The\r\nGreat Divide_ (1907) a play of somewhat higher artistic pretensions;\r\nEugene Walter in _Paid in Full_ (1908) and _The Easiest Way_ (1909)\r\ndealt vigorously with characteristic themes of modern life; and Edward\r\nSheldon produced in _Salvation Nell_ a slum drama of very striking\r\nrealism. The poetic side of drama was mainly represented by Percy\r\nMackaye (b. 1875), whose _Jeanne d'Arc_ (1906) and _Sappho and Phaon_\r\nshowed a high ambition and no small literary power. On the whole it may\r\nbe said that, though the financial conditions of the American stage are\r\neven more unfortunate than those which prevail in England, they have\r\nfailed to check a very strong movement towards nationalism in drama.\r\nSeason by season, America writes more of her own plays, good or bad, and\r\nbecomes less dependent on imported work, whether French or English. (W.\r\nA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(g) _German Drama._\r\n\r\nThe history of the German drama differs widely from that of the English,\r\nthough a close contact is observable between them at an early point, and\r\nagain at relatively recent points, in their annals. The dramatic\r\nliterature of Germany, though in its beginnings intimately connected\r\nwith the great national movement of the Reformation, soon devoted its\r\nefforts to a sterile imitation of foreign models; while the popular\r\nstage, persistently suiting itself to a robust but gross taste, likewise\r\nlargely due to the influence of foreign examples, seemed destined to a\r\nhopeless decay. The literary and the acted drama were thus estranged\r\nfrom one another during a period of extraordinary length; nor was it\r\ntill the middle of the 18th century that, with the opening of a more\r\nhopeful era for the life and literature of the nation, the reunion of\r\ndramatic literature and the stage began to accomplish itself. Before the\r\nend of the same century the progress of the German drama in its turn\r\nbegan to influence that of other nations, and by the widely\r\ncomprehensive character of its literature, as well as by the activity of\r\nits stage, to invite a steadily increasing interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Latin drama in Germany.\r\n\r\n  The Jesuit drama.\r\n\r\nIt should be premised that in its beginnings the modern German drama\r\nmight have seemed likely to be influenced even more largely than the\r\nEnglish or the French by the copious imitation of classical models which\r\nmarked the periods of the Renaissance and the Reformation; but here the\r\nimpulse of originality was wanting to bring about a speedy and gradually\r\na complete emancipation, and imitative reproduction continued in an all\r\nbut endless series. The first German (and indeed the earliest\r\ntransalpine) writer to follow in the footsteps of the modern Latin drama\r\nof the Italians was the famous Strassburg humanist Jacob Wimpheling\r\n(1450-1528), whose comedy of _Stylpho_ (1480), an attack upon the\r\nignorance of the pluralist beneficed clergy, marks a kind of epoch in\r\nthe history of German dramatic effort. It was succeeded by many other\r\nLatin plays of various kinds, among which may be mentioned J.\r\nKerckmeister's _Codrus_ (1485), satirizing pedantic schoolmasters; a\r\nseries of historical dramas in a moralizing vein, partly on the Turkish\r\nperil, as well as of comedies, by Jacob Locher (1471-1528); two plays by\r\nthe great Johann Reuchlin, of which the so-called _Henno_ went through\r\nmore than thirty editions; and the _Ludus Dianae_, with another play\r\nlikewise in honour of the emperor Maximilian I., by the celebrated\r\nViennese scholar Conrad Celtes (1459-1508). Sebastian Brant's _Hercules\r\nin Bivio_ (1512) is lost; but Wilibald Pirckheimer's _Eckius dedolatus_\r\n(1520) survives as a dramatic contribution to Luther's controversy with\r\none of his most active opponents. The _Acolastus_ (1525) of W. Gnaphaeus\r\n(_alias_ Fullonius, his native name was de Volder) should also be\r\nmentioned in the present connexion, as, though a Dutchman by birth, he\r\nspent most of his literary life in Germany. This Terentian version of\r\nthe parable of the Prodigal Son was printed in an almost endless number\r\nof editions, as well as in various versions in modern tongues, among\r\nwhich reference has already been made to the English, for the use of\r\nschools, by J. Palsgrave (1540). Macropedius (Langhveldt) belongs wholly\r\nto the Low Countries. In Germany the stream of these compositions\r\ncontinued to flow almost without abatement throughout the earlier half\r\nof the 16th century; but in the days of the Reformation it takes a turn\r\nto scriptural subjects, and during the latter part of the century\r\nremains on the whole faithful to this preference.[273] These Latin plays\r\nmay be called school-dramas in the most precise sense; for they were\r\nboth performed in the schools and read in class with commentaries\r\nspecially composed for them; nor was it except very reluctantly that in\r\nthis age the vernacular drama was allowed to intrude into scholastic\r\ncircles. It should be noticed that the Jesuit order, which afterwards\r\nproved so keenly alive to the influence which dramatic performances\r\nexercise over the youthful mind, only very gradually abandoned the\r\nprinciple, formally sanctioned in their _Ratio studiorum_, that the\r\nacting of plays (these being always in the Latin tongue) should only\r\nrarely be permitted in their seminaries. The flourishing period of the\r\nJesuit drama begins with the spread of the order in the west and\r\nsouth-west of the Empire in the last decade of the 16th century, and\r\nthen continues, through the vicissitudes of good and evil, with a\r\ncurious intermixture of Latin and German plays, during the whole of the\r\n17th and the better part of the 18th. These productions, which ranged in\r\ntheir subjects from biblical and classical story to themes of\r\ncontemporary history (such as the relief of Vienna by Sobiesky and the\r\npeace of Ryswick), seem generally to bear the mark of their\r\nauthorship--that of teachers appointed by their superiors to execute\r\nthis among other tasks allotted to them; but, as it seems unnecessary to\r\nreturn to this special growth, it may be added that the extraordinary\r\nproductiveness of the Jesuit dramatists, and the steadiness of\r\nself-repetition which is equally characteristic of them, should warn us\r\nagainst underrating its influence upon a considerable proportion of the\r\nnation's educational life during a long succession of generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Beginnings of the vernacular German drama.\r\n\r\n  Hans Sachs.\r\n\r\n  The English comedians.\r\n\r\n  Separation between the stage and literature.\r\n\r\nWhile the scholars of the German Renaissance, who became so largely the\r\nagents of the Reformation, eagerly dramatized scriptural subjects in the\r\nLatin, and sometimes (as in the case of Luther's protégé P. Rebhun[274])\r\nin the native tongue, the same influence made itself felt in another\r\nsphere of dramatic activity. Towards the close of the middle ages, as\r\nhas been seen, dramatic performances had in Germany, as in England,\r\nlargely fallen into the hands of the civic gilds, and the composition of\r\nplays was more especially cultivated by the master-singers of Nuremberg\r\nand other towns. It was thus that, under the influence of the\r\nReformation, and of the impulse given by Luther and others to the use of\r\nHigh German as the popular literary tongue, Hans Sachs, the immortal\r\nshoemaker of Nuremberg, seemed destined to become the father of the\r\npopular German drama. In his plays, \"spiritual,\" \"secular,\" and\r\n_Fastnachtsspiele_ alike, the interest indeed lies in the dialogue\r\nrather than in the action, nor do they display any attempt at\r\ndevelopment of character. In their subjects, whether derived from\r\nScripture or from popular legend and fiction,[275] there is no novelty,\r\nand in their treatment no originality. But the healthy vigour and fresh\r\nhumour of this marvellously fertile author, and his innate sympathy with\r\nthe views and sentiments of the burgher class to which he belonged, were\r\nelements of genuine promise--a promise which the event was signally to\r\ndisappoint. Though the manner of Hans Sachs found a few followers, and\r\nis recognizable in the German popular drama even of the beginning of the\r\n17th century, the literature of the Reformation, of which his works may\r\nclaim to form part, was soon absorbed in labours of a very different\r\nkind. The stage, after admitting novelties introduced from Italy or\r\n(under Jesuit supervision) from Spain, was subjected to another and\r\nenduring influence. Among the foreign actors of various nations who\r\nflitted through the innumerable courts of the empire, or found a\r\ntemporary home there, special prominence was acquired, towards the close\r\nof the 16th and in the early years of the 17th century, by the \"English\r\ncomedians,\" who appeared at Cassel, Wolfenbuttel, Berlin, Dresden,\r\nCologne, &c. Through these players a number of early English dramas\r\nfound their way into Germany, where they were performed in more or less\r\nimperfect versions, and called forth imitations by native authors. Duke\r\nHenry Julius of Brunswick-Luneburg[276] (1564-1613) and Jacob Ayrer (a\r\ncitizen of Nuremberg, where he died, 1605) represent the endeavours of\r\nthe early German drama to suit its still uncouth forms to themes\r\nsuggested by English examples; and in their works, and in those of\r\ncontemporary playwrights, there reappears no small part of what we may\r\nconclude to have been the \"English comedians'\" _répertoire_.[277] (The\r\nconverse influence of German themes brought home with them by the\r\nEnglish actors, or set in motion by their strolling ubiquity, cannot\r\nhave been equal in extent, though Shakespeare himself may have derived\r\nthe idea of one of his plots[278] from such a source). But, though\r\nwelcome to both princes and people, the exertions of these foreign\r\ncomedians, and of the native imitators who soon arose in the earliest\r\nprofessional companies of actors known in Germany, instead of bringing\r\nabout a union between the stage and literature, led to a directly\r\nopposite result. The popularity of these strollers was owing partly to\r\nthe (very real) blood and other horrors with which their plays were\r\ndeluged, partly to the buffoonery with which they seasoned, and the\r\nvarious tricks and feats with which they diversified, their\r\nperformances. The representatives of the English clowns had learnt much\r\non their way from their brethren in the Netherlands, where in this\r\nperiod the art of grotesque acting greatly flourished. Nor were the aids\r\nof other arts neglected,--to this day in Germany professors of the\r\n\"equestrian drama\" are known by the popular appellation of \"English\r\nriders.\" From these true descendants of the mimes, then, the\r\nprofessional actors in Germany inherited a variety of tricks and\r\ntraditions; and soon the favourite figures of the popular comic stage\r\nbecame conventional, and were stereotyped by the use of masks. Among\r\nthese an acknowledged supremacy was acquired by the native _Hans Wurst_\r\n(Jack Pudding)--of whose name Luther disavowed the invention, and who is\r\nknown already to Hans Sachs--the privileged buffoon, and for a long\r\nseries of generations the real lord and master, of the German stage. If\r\nthat stage, with its grossness and ribaldry, seemed likely to become\r\npermanently estranged from the tastes and sympathies of the educated\r\nclasses, the fault was by no means entirely its own and that of its\r\npatron the populace. The times were evil times for a national effort of\r\nany kind; and poetic literature was in all its branches passing into the\r\nhands of scholars who were often pedants, and whose language was a\r\njargon of learned affectations. Thus things continued, till the awful\r\nvisitation of the Thirty Years' War cast a general blight upon the\r\nnational life, and the traditions of the popular theatre were left to\r\nthe guardianship of the marionettes (_Puppenspiele_)!\r\n\r\n\r\n  The literary drama of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the midst of that war, German poets once more began to essay\r\nthe dramatic form, the national drama was left outside their range of\r\nvision. M. Opitz, who holds an honoured place in the history of the\r\nGerman language and literature, in this branch of his labours contented\r\nhimself with translations of classical dramas and of Italian\r\npastorals--among the latter one of Rinuccini's _Daphne_, with which the\r\nhistory of the opera in Germany begins. A. Gryphius, though as a comic\r\ndramatist lacking neither vigour nor variety, and acquainted with\r\nShakespearian[279] as well as Latin and Italian examples, chiefly\r\ndevoted himself to the imitation of Latin, earlier French, and Dutch\r\ntragedy, the rhetorical dialogue of which he effectively reproduced in\r\nthe Alexandrine metre.[280] Neither the turgid dramas of D. C. von\r\nLohenstein (1665-1684), for whose _Cleopatra_ the honour of having been\r\nthe first German tragedy has been claimed, nor even the much healthier\r\ncomedies of Chr. Weise (1642-1708) were brought upon the stage; while\r\nthe religious plays of J. Klay (1616-1656) are mere recitations\r\nconnected with the Italian growth of the _oratorio_. The frigid\r\nallegories commemorative of contemporary events, with which the learned\r\nfrom time to time supplied the theatre, and the pastoral dramas with\r\nwhich the idyllic poets of Nuremberg--\"the shepherds of the\r\nPegnitz\"--after the close of the war gratified the peaceful longings of\r\ntheir fellow-citizens, were alike mere scholastic efforts. These indeed\r\ncontinued in the universities and _gymnasia_ to keep alive the love of\r\nboth dramatic composition and dramatic representation, and to encourage\r\nthe theatrical taste which led so many students into the professional\r\ncompanies. But neither these dramatic exercises nor the _ludi Caesarei_\r\nin which the Jesuits at Vienna revived the pomp and pageantry, and the\r\nmixture of classical and Christian symbolism, of the Italian\r\nRenaissance, had any influence upon the progress of the popular drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The stage before its reform.\r\n\r\nThe history of the German stage remains to about the second decennium of\r\nthe 18th century one of the most melancholy, as it is in its way one of\r\nthe most instructive, chapters of theatrical history. Ignored by the\r\nworld of letters, the actors in return deliberately sought to emancipate\r\ntheir art from all dependence upon literary material. Improvisation\r\nreigned supreme, not only in farce, where _Hans Wurst_, with the aid of\r\nItalian examples, never ceased to charm his public, but in the serious\r\ndrama likewise (in which, however, he also played his part) in those\r\n_Haupt- und Staatsactionen_ (high-matter-of-state-dramas), the plots of\r\nwhich were taken from the old stores of the English comedians, from the\r\nreligious drama and its sources, and from the profane history of all\r\ntimes. The hero of this period is \"Magister\" J. Velthen (or Veltheim),\r\nwho at the head of a company of players for a time entered the service\r\nof the Saxon court, and, by reproducing comedies of Molière and other\r\nwriters, sought to restrain the licence which he had himself carried\r\nbeyond all earlier precedent, but who had to fall back into the old ways\r\nand the old life. His career exhibits the climax of the efforts of the\r\nart of acting to stand alone; after his death (c. 1693) chaos ensues.\r\nThe strolling companies, which now included actresses, continued to\r\nfoster the popular love of the stage, and even under its most degraded\r\nform to uphold its national character against the rivalry of the opera,\r\nand that of the Italian _commedia dell' arte_. From the latter was\r\nborrowed Harlequin, with whom _Hans Wurst_ was blended, and who became a\r\nstanding figure in every kind of popular play.[281] He established his\r\nsway more especially at Vienna, where from about 1712 the first\r\npermanent German theatre was maintained. But for the actors in general\r\nthere was little permanence, and amidst miseries of all sorts, and under\r\nthe growing ban of clerical intolerance, the popular stage seemed\r\ndestined to hopeless decay. A certain vitality of growth seems, under\r\nclerical guidance, to have characterized the plays of the people in\r\nBavaria and parts of Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\n  F. K. Neuber, Gottsched, and the Leipzig school.\r\n\r\n  Ekhof\r\n\r\nThe first endeavours to reform what had thus apparently passed beyond\r\nall reach of recovery were neither wholly nor generally successful; but\r\nthis does not diminish the honour due to two names which should never be\r\nmentioned without respect in connexion with the history of the drama.\r\nFriederike Karoline Neuber's (1697-1760) biography is the story of a\r\nlong-continued effort which, notwithstanding errors and weaknesses, and\r\nthough, so far as her personal fortunes were concerned, it ended in\r\nfailure, may almost be described as heroic. As directress of a company\r\nof actors which from 1727 had its headquarters at Leipzig (hence the new\r\nschool of acting is called the Leipzig school), she resolved to put an\r\nend to the formlessness of the existing stage, to separate tragedy and\r\ncomedy, and to extinguish Harlequin. In this endeavour she was supported\r\nby the Leipzig professor J. Chr. Gottsched, who induced her to establish\r\nFrench tragedy and comedy as the sole models of the regular drama.\r\nLiterature and the stage thus for the first time joined hands, and no\r\ntemporary mischance or personal misunderstanding can obscure the\r\nenduring significance of the union. Not only were the abuses of a\r\ncentury swept away from a representative theatre, but a large number of\r\nliterary works, designed for the stage, were produced on it. It is true\r\nthat they were but versions or imitations from the French (or in the\r\ncase of Gottsched's _Dying Cato_ from the French and English),[282] and\r\nthat at the moment of the regeneration of the German drama new fetters\r\nwere thus imposed upon it, and upon the art of acting at the same time.\r\nBut the impulse had been given, and the beginning made. On the one hand,\r\nmen of letters began to subject their dramatic compositions to the test\r\nof performance; the tragedies and comedies of J. E. Schlegel, the\r\nartificial and sentimental comedies of Chr. F. Gellert and others,\r\ntogether with the vigorous popular comedies of the Danish dramatist\r\nHolberg, were brought into competition with translations from the\r\nFrench. On the other hand, the Leipzig school exercised a continuous\r\neffect upon the progress of the art of acting, and before long K. Ekhof\r\nbegan a career which made his art a fit subject for the critical study\r\nof scholars, and his profession one to be esteemed by honourable men.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lessing.\r\n\r\nAmong the authors contributing to Mme. Neuber's Leipzig enterprise had\r\nbeen a young student destined to complete, after a very different\r\nfashion and with very different aims, the work which she and Gottsched\r\nhad begun. The critical genius of G. E. Lessing is peerless in its\r\ncomprehensiveness, as in its keenness and depth; but if there was any\r\nbranch of literature and art which by study and practice he made\r\npre-eminently his own, it was that of the drama. As bearing upon the\r\nprogress of the German theatre, his services to its literature, both\r\ncritical and creative, can only be described as inestimable. The\r\n_Hamburgische Dramaturgie_, a series of criticisms of plays and (in its\r\nearlier numbers) of actors, was undertaken in furtherance of the attempt\r\nto establish at Hamburg the first national German theatre (1767-1769).\r\nThis fact alone would invest these papers with a high significance; for,\r\nthough the theatrical enterprise proved abortive, it established the\r\nprinciple upon which the progress of the theatre in all countries\r\ndepends--that for the dramatic art the immediate theatrical public is no\r\nsufficient court of appeal. But the direct effect of the _Dramaturgie_\r\nwas to complete the task which Lessing had in previous writings begun,\r\nand to overthrow the dominion of the arbitrary French rules and the\r\nFrench models established by Gottsched. Lessing vindicated its real laws\r\nto the drama, made clear the difference between the Greeks and their\r\nwould-be representatives, and established the claims of Shakespeare as\r\nthe modern master of both tragedy and comedy. His own dramatic\r\nproductivity was cautious, tentative, progressive. His first step was,\r\nby his _Miss Sara Sampson_ (1755), to oppose the realism of the English\r\ndomestic drama to the artificiality of the accepted French models, in\r\nthe forms of which Chr. F. Weisse (1726-1804) was seeking to treat the\r\nsubjects of Shakespearian plays.[283] Then, in his _Minna von Barnhelm_\r\n(1767), which owed something to Farquhar, he essayed a national comedy\r\ndrawn from real life, and appealing to patriotic sentiments as well as\r\nto broad human sympathies. It was written in prose (like _Miss Sara\r\nSampson_), but in form held a judicious mean between French and English\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Efforts of the theatre and of literature.\r\n\r\nThe note sounded by the criticisms of Lessing met with a ready response,\r\nand the productivity displayed by the nascent dramatic literature of\r\nGermany is astonishing, both in the efforts inspired by his teachings\r\nand in those which continued to controvert or which aspired to transcend\r\nthem. On the stage, Harlequin and his surroundings proved by no means\r\neasy to suppress, more especially at Vienna, the favourite home of\r\nfrivolous amusement; but even here a reform was gradually effected, and,\r\nunder the intelligent rule of the emperor Joseph II., a national stage\r\ngrew into being. The mantle of Ekhof fell upon the shoulders of his\r\neager younger rival, F. L. Schröder, who was the first to domesticate\r\nShakespeare upon the German stage. In dramatic literature few of\r\nLessing's earlier contemporaries produced any works of permanent value,\r\nunless the religious dramas of F. G. Klopstock--a species in which he\r\nhad been preceded by J. J. Bodmer--and the patriotic _Bardietten_ of the\r\nsame author be excepted. S. Gessner, J. W. L. Gleim, and G. K. Pfeffel\r\n(1736-1809) composed pastoral plays. But a far more potent stimulus\r\nprompted the efforts of the younger generation. The translation of\r\nShakespeare, begun in 1762 by C. M. Wieland, whose own plays possess no\r\nspecial significance, and completed in 1775 by Eschenburg, which\r\nfurnished the text for many of Lessing's criticisms, helps to mark an\r\nepoch in German literature. Under the influence of Shakespeare, or of\r\ntheir conceptions of his genius, arose a youthful group of writers who,\r\nwhile worshipping their idol as the representative of nature, displayed\r\nbut slight anxiety to harmonize their imitations of him with the demands\r\nof art. The notorious _Ugolino_ of H. W. von Gerstenberg seemed a\r\npremonitory sign that the coming flood might merely rush back to the\r\nextravagances and horrors of the old popular stage; and it was with a\r\nsense of this danger in prospect that Lessing in his third important\r\ndrama, the prose tragedy _Emilia Galotti_ (1772), set the example of a\r\nwork of incomparable nicety in its adaptation of means to end. But\r\nsuccessful as it proved, it could not stay the excesses of the _Sturm\r\nund Drang_ period which now set in. Lessing's last drama, _Nathan der\r\nWeise_ (1779), was not measured to the standard of the contemporary\r\nstage; but it was to exercise its influence in the progress of time--not\r\nonly by causing a reaction in tragedy from prose to blank verse (first\r\nessayed in J. W. von Brawe's _Brutus_, 1770), but by ennobling and\r\nelevating by its moral and intellectual grandeur the branch of\r\nliterature to which in form it belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Sturm und Drang.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young geniuses of the _Sturm und Drang_ had gone forth, as\r\nworshippers rather than followers of Shakespeare, to conquer new worlds.\r\nThe name of this group of writers, more remarkable for their collective\r\nsignificance than for their individual achievements, was derived from a\r\ndrama by one of the most prolific of their number, M. F. von\r\nKlinger;[284] other members of the fraternity were J. A. Leisewitz[285]\r\n(1752-1806), M. R. Lenz[286] and F. Müller[287] the \"painter.\" The\r\nyouthful genius of the greatest of German poets was itself under the\r\ninfluences of this period, when it produced the first of its\r\nmasterpieces. But Goethe's _Götz von Berlichingen_ (1773), both by the\r\nchoice and treatment of its national theme, and by the incomparable\r\nfreshness and originality of its style, holds a position of its own in\r\nGerman dramatic literature. Though its defiant irregularity of form\r\nprevented its complete success upon the stage, yet its influence is far\r\nfrom being represented by the series of mostly feeble imitations to\r\nwhich it gave rise. The _Ritterdramen_ (plays of chivalry) had their day\r\nlike similar fashions in drama or romance; but the permanent effect of\r\n_Götz_ was, that it crushed as with an iron hand the last remnants of\r\ntheatrical conventionality (those of costume and scenery included), and\r\nextinguished with them the lingering respect for rules and traditions of\r\ndramatic composition which even Lessing had treated with consideration.\r\nIts highest significance, however, lies in its having been the first\r\ngreat dramatic work of a great national poet, and having definitively\r\nassociated the national drama with the poetic glories of the national\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Goethe.\r\n\r\n  Schiller.\r\n\r\nThus, in the classical period of that literature, of which Goethe and\r\nSchiller were the ruling stars, the drama had a full share of the\r\nloftiest of its achievements. Of these, the dramatic works of Goethe\r\nvary so widely in form and character, and connect themselves so\r\nintimately with the different phases of the development of his own\r\nself-directed poetic genius, that it was impossible for any of them to\r\nbecome the starting-points of any general growths in the history of the\r\nGerman drama. His way of composition was, moreover, so peculiar to\r\nhimself--conception often preceding execution by many years, part being\r\nadded to part under the influence of new sentiments and ideas and views\r\nof art, flexibly followed by changes of form--that the history of his\r\ndramas cannot be severed from his general poetic and personal biography.\r\nHis _Clavigo_ and _Stella_, which succeeded _Götz_, are domestic dramas\r\nin prose; but neither by these, nor by the series of charming pastorals\r\nand operas which he composed for the Weimar court, could any influence\r\nbe exercised upon the progress of the national drama. In the first\r\nconception of his _Faust_, he had indeed sought the suggestion of his\r\ntheme partly in popular legend, partly in a domestic motive familiar to\r\nthe authors of the _Sturm und Drang_ (the story of Gretchen); the later\r\nadditions to the First Part, and the Second Part generally, are the\r\nresults of metaphysical and critical studies and meditations belonging\r\nto wholly different spheres of thought and experience. The dramatic\r\nunity of the whole is thus, at the most, external only; and the standard\r\nof judgment to be applied to this wondrous poem is not one of dramatic\r\ncriticism. _Egmont_, originally designed as a companion to _Götz_, was\r\nnot completed till many years later; there are few dramas more effective\r\nin parts, but the idea of a historic play is lost in the elaboration of\r\nthe most graceful of love episodes. In _Iphigenia_ and _Tasso_, Goethe\r\nexhibited the perfection of form of which his classical period had\r\nenabled him to acquire the mastery; but the sphere of the action of the\r\nformer (perfect though it is as a dramatic action), and the nature of\r\nthat of the latter, are equally remote from the demands of the popular\r\nstage. Schiller's genius, unlike Goethe's, was naturally and\r\nconsistently suited to the claims of the theatre. His juvenile works,\r\n_The Robbers_, _Fiesco_, _Kabale und Liebe_, vibrating under the\r\ninfluence of an age of social revolution, combined in their prose form\r\nthe truthful expression of passion with a considerable admixture of\r\nextravagance. But, with true insight into the demands of his art, and\r\nwith unequalled single-mindedness and self-devotion to it, Schiller\r\ngradually emancipated himself from his earlier style; and with his\r\nearliest tragedy in verse, _Don Carlos_, the first period of his\r\ndramatic authorship ends, and the promise of the second announces\r\nitself. The works which belong to this--from the _Wallenstein_ trilogy\r\nto _Tell_--are the acknowledged masterpieces of the German poetic drama,\r\ntreating historic themes reconstructed by conscious dramatic\r\nworkmanship, and clothing their dialogue in a noble vestment of\r\nrhetorical verse. The plays of Schiller are the living embodiment of the\r\ntheory of tragedy elaborated by Hegel, according to which its proper\r\ntheme is the divine, or, in other words, the moving ethical, element in\r\nhuman action. In one of his later plays, _The Bride of Messina_,\r\nSchiller attempted a new use of the chorus of Greek tragedy; but the\r\nendeavour was a splendid error, and destined to exercise no lasting\r\neffect. The reaction against Schiller's ascendancy began with writers\r\nwho could not reconcile themselves with the cosmopolitan and\r\nnon-national elements in his genius, and is still represented by eminent\r\ncritics; but the future must be left to settle the contention.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The popular stage.\r\n\r\nSchiller's later dramas had gradually conquered the stage, over which\r\nhis juvenile works had in this time triumphantly passed, but on which\r\nhis _Don Carlos_ had met with a cold welcome. For a long time, however,\r\nits favourites were authors of a very different order, who suited\r\nthemselves to the demands of a public tolerably indifferent to the\r\nliterary progress of the drama. After popular tastes had oscillated\r\nbetween the imitators of _Gotz_ and those of _Emilia Galotti_, they\r\nentered into a more settled phase, as the establishment of standing\r\ntheatres at the courts and in the large towns increased the demand for\r\ngood \"acting\" plays. Famous actors, such as Schröder and A. W. Iffland,\r\nsought by translations or compositions of their own to meet the popular\r\nlikings, which largely took the direction of that irrepressible\r\nfavourite of theatrical audiences, the sentimental domestic drama.[288]\r\nBut the most successful purveyor of such wares was an author who, though\r\nnot himself an actor, understood the theatre with a professional\r\ninstinct--August von Kotzebue. His productivity ranged from the domestic\r\ndrama and comedy of all kinds to attempts to rival Schiller and\r\nShakespeare in verse; and though his popularity (which ultimately proved\r\nhis doom) brought upon him the bitterest attacks of the romantic school\r\nand other literary authorities, his self-conceit is not astonishing, and\r\nthe time has come for saying that there is some exaggeration in the\r\ncontempt which has been lavished upon him by posterity.[289] Nor should\r\nit be forgotten that German literature had so far failed to furnish the\r\ncomic stage with any successors to _Minna von Barnhelm_; for Goethe's\r\nefforts to dramatize characteristic events or figures of the\r\nRevolutionary age[290] must be dismissed as failures, not from a\r\ntheatrical point of view only. The joint efforts of Goethe and Schiller\r\nfor the Weimar stage, important in many respects for the history of the\r\nGerman drama, at the same time reveal the want of a national dramatic\r\nliterature sufficient to supply the needs of a theatre endeavouring to\r\nsatisfy the demands of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The romantic school.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the so-called romantic school of German literature was\r\nlikewise beginning to extend its labours to original dramatic\r\ncomposition. From the universality of sympathies proclaimed by this\r\nschool, to whose leaders Germany owed its classical translation of\r\nShakespeare,[291] and an introduction to the dramatic literatures of so\r\nmany ages and nations,[292] a variety of new dramatic impulses might be\r\nexpected; while much might be hoped for the future of the national drama\r\n(especially in its mixed and comic species) from the alliance between\r\npoetry and real life which they preached, and which some of them sought\r\npersonally to exemplify. But in practice universality presented itself\r\nas peculiarity or even as eccentricity; and in the end the divorce\r\nbetween poetry and real life was announced as authoritatively as their\r\nunion had been. Outside this school, the youthful talent of Th. Körner,\r\nwhose early promise as a dramatist[293] might perhaps have ripened into\r\na fulness enabling him not unworthily to occupy the seat left vacant by\r\nhis father's friend Schiller, was extinguished by a patriotic death. The\r\nefforts of M. von Collin (1779-1824) in the direction of the historical\r\ndrama remained isolated attempts. But of the leaders of the romantic\r\nschool, A. W.[294] and F. von Schlegel[295] contented themselves with\r\nfrigid classicalities; and L. Tieck, in the strange alembic of his\r\n_Phantasus_, melted legend and fairy-tale, novel and drama,[296] poetry\r\nand satire, into a compound, enjoyable indeed, but hardly so in its\r\nentirety, or in many of its parts, to any but the literary mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Later dramatists.\r\n\r\nF. de La Motte Fouqué infused a spirit of poetry into the chivalry\r\ndrama. Klemens Brentano was a fantastic dramatist unsuited to the stage.\r\nHere a feeble outgrowth of the romanticists, the \"destiny dramatists\" Z.\r\nWerner[297]--the most original of the group--A. Müllner,[298] and Baron\r\nC. E. v. Houwald,[299] achieved a temporary _furore_; and it was with an\r\nattempt in the same direction[300] that the Austrian dramatist F.\r\nGrillparzer began his long career. He is assuredly, what he pronounced\r\nhimself to be, the foremost of the later dramatic poets of Germany,\r\nunless that tribute be thought due to the genius of H. von Kleist, who\r\nin his short life produced, besides other works, a romantic drama[301]\r\nand a rustic comedy[302] of genuine merit, and an historical tragedy of\r\nsingular originality and power.[303] Grillparzer's long series of plays\r\nincludes poetic dramas on classical themes[304] and historical subjects\r\nfrom Austrian history,[305] or treated from an Austrian point of view.\r\nThe romantic school, which through Tieck had satirized the drama of the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ and its offshoots, was in its turn satirized by Count A.\r\nvon Platen-Hallermund's admirable imitations of Aristophanic\r\ncomedy.[306] Among the objects of his banter were the popular playwright\r\nE. Raupach, and K. Immermann, a true poet, who is, however, less\r\ngenerally remembered as a dramatist. F. Hebbel[307] is justly ranked\r\nhigh among the foremost later dramatic poets of his country, few of whom\r\nequal him in intensity. The eminent lyrical (especially ballad) poet L.\r\nUhland left behind him a large number of dramatic fragments, but little\r\nor nothing really complete. Other names of literary mark are those of C.\r\nD. Grabbe, J. Mosen, O. Ludwig[308] (1813-1865), a dramatist of great\r\npower, and \"F. Halm\" (Baron von Münch-Bellinghausen) (1806-1871), and,\r\namong writers of a more modern school, K. Gutzkow,[309] G.\r\nFreytag,[310] and H. Laube.[311] L. Anzengruber, a writer of real genius\r\nthough restricted range, imparted a new significance to the Austrian\r\npopular drama,[312] formerly so commonplace in the hands of F. Raimund\r\nand J. Nestroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The German stage of the latter half of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nDuring the long period of transition which may be said to have ended\r\nwith the establishment of the new German empire, the German stage in\r\nsome measure anticipated the developments which more spacious times were\r\nto witness in the German drama. The traditions of the national theatre\r\ncontemporary with the great epoch of the national literature were kept\r\nalive by a succession of eminent actors--such as the nephews of Ludwig\r\nDevrient, himself an artist of the greatest originality, whose most\r\nconspicuous success, though nature had fitted him for Shakespeare, was\r\nachieved in Schiller's earliest play.[313] Among the younger generation\r\nof Devrients the most striking personality was that of Emil; his elder\r\nbrother Karl August, husband of Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, the\r\nbrilliant star of the operatic stage, and their son Friedrich, were also\r\npopular actors; yet another brother, Eduard, is more widely remembered\r\nas the historian of the German stage. Partly by reason of the number and\r\nvariety of its centres of intellectual and artistic life, Germany was\r\nlong enabled both to cherish the few masterpieces of its own drama, and,\r\nwith the aid of a language well adapted for translation, to give\r\nadmittance to the dramatic masterpieces of other nations also, and to\r\nShakespeare in particular, without going far in the search for\r\ntheatrical novelty or effect. But a change came over the spirit of\r\nGerman theatrical management with the endeavours of H. Laube, from about\r\nthe middle of the century onwards, at Vienna (and Leipzig), which\r\navowedly placed the demands of the theatre as such above those of\r\nliterary merit or even of national sentiment. In a less combative\r\nspirit, F. Dingelstedt, both at Munich, which under King Maximilian he\r\nhad made a kindly nurse of German culture, and, after his efforts there\r\nhad come to an untimely end,[314] at Weimar and at Vienna, raised the\r\ntheatre to a very high level of artistic achievement. The most memorable\r\nevent in the annals of his managements was the production on the Weimar\r\nstage of the series of Shakespeare's _histories_. At a rather later\r\nperiod, of which the height extended from 1874 to 1890, the company of\r\nactors in the service, and under the personal direction, of Duke George\r\nof Saxe-Meiningen, created a great effect by their performances both in\r\nand outside Germany--not so much by their artistic improvements in\r\nscenery and decoration, as by the extraordinary perfection of their\r\n_ensemble_. But no dramaturgic achievement in the century could compare\r\nin grandeur either of conception or of execution with Richard Wagner's\r\nBayreuth performances, where, for the first time in the history of the\r\nmodern stage, the artistic instinct ruled supreme in all the conditions\r\nof the work and its presentment. Though the _Ring of the Nibelungs_ and\r\nits successors belong to opera rather than drama proper, the importance\r\nof their production (1876) should be overlooked by no student of the\r\ndramatic art. Potent as has been the influence of foreign dramatic\r\nliteratures--whether French or Scandinavian--and that of a movement\r\nwhich has been common to them all, and from which the German was perhaps\r\nthe least likely to exclude itself, the most notable feature in the\r\nrecent history of the German drama has been its quick response to wholly\r\nnew demands, which, though the attempt was made with some persistence,\r\ncould no longer be met without an effort to span the widths and sound\r\nthe depths of a more spacious and more self-conscious era.[315]\r\n\r\n\r\nh. _Dutch Drama._\r\n\r\nAmong other modern European dramas the Dutch is interesting both in its\r\nbeginnings, which to all intents and purposes form part of those of the\r\nGerman, and because of the special influence of the so-called chambers\r\nof the _rederykers_ (rhetoricians), from the early years of the 15th\r\ncentury onwards, which bear some resemblance to the associations of the\r\nmaster-singers in contemporary higher Germany. The earliest of their\r\nefforts, which so effectively tempered the despotism of both church and\r\nstate, seem to have been of a dramatic kind; and a manifold variety of\r\nallegories, moralities and comic entertainments (_esbatementen_ or\r\ncomedies, _kluiten_ and _factien_ or farces) enhanced the attractions of\r\nthose popular pageants in which the Netherlands surpassed all other\r\ncountries of the North. The Low Countries responded more largely to the\r\nimpulse of the Renaissance than, with some local exceptions, any other\r\nof the Germanic lands. They necessarily had a considerable share in the\r\ncultivation of the modern Latin drama; and, while the author of\r\n_Acolastus_ may be claimed as its own by the country of his adoption as\r\nwell as by that of his birth, G. M. Macropedius (Langhveldt) (c.\r\n1475-1508), who may be regarded as the foremost Latin dramatist of his\r\nage, was born and died at Hertogenbosch or in its immediate vicinity.\r\nMacropedius, who belonged to the fraternity of the Common Life, was a\r\nwriter of great realistic power as well as of remarkable literary\r\nversatility.[316] The art of acting flourished in the Low Countries even\r\nduring the troubles of the great revolt; but the birth of the regular\r\ndrama was delayed till the advent of quieter times. Dutch dramatic\r\nliterature begins, under the influence of the classical studies\r\ncherished in the seats of learning founded before and after the close of\r\nthe war, with the classical tragedies of S. Koster (c. 1585-c. 1650).\r\nThe romantic dramas and farces of Gerbrand Bredero (1585-1618) and the\r\ntragedies of P. Hooft (1581-1647) belong to the same period; but its\r\nforemost dramatic poet was J. van den Vondel, who from an imitation of\r\nclassical models passed to more original forms of dramatic composition,\r\nincluding a patriotic play and a dramatic treatment of part of what was\r\nto form the theme of _Paradise Lost_.[317] But Vondel had no successor\r\nof equal mark. The older form of Dutch tragedy--in which the chorus\r\nstill appeared--was, especially under the influence of the critic A.\r\nPels, exchanged for a close imitation of the French models, Corneille\r\nand Racine; nor was the attempt to create a national comedy successful.\r\nThus no national Dutch drama was permanently called into life.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Scandinavian Drama._\r\n\r\n  Denmark.\r\n\r\n  The modern Norwegian drama.\r\n\r\nStill more distinctly, the dramatic literature of the Scandinavian\r\npeoples springs from foreign growths. In Denmark, where the beginnings\r\nof the drama in the plays of the schoolmaster Chr. Hansen recall the\r\nmixture of religious and farcical elements in contemporary German\r\nefforts, the drama in the latter half of the 16th century remained\r\nessentially scholastic, and treated scriptural or classical subjects,\r\nchiefly in the Latin tongue. J. Ranch (1539-1607) and H. S. Sthen were\r\nauthors of this type. But often in the course of the 17th century,\r\nGerman and French had become the tongues of Danish literature and of the\r\nDanish theatre; in the 18th Denmark could boast a comic dramatist of\r\nthorough originality and of a wholly national cast. L. Holberg, one of\r\nthe most noteworthy comic poets of modern literature, not only marks an\r\nepoch in the dramatic literature of his native land, but he contributed\r\nto overthrow the trivialities of the German stage in its worst period,\r\nwhich he satirized with merciless humour,[318] and set an example, never\r\nsurpassed, of a series of comedies[319] deriving their types from\r\npopular life and ridiculing with healthy directness those vices and\r\nfollies which are the proper theme of the most widely effective species\r\nof the comic drama. Among his followers, P. A. Heiberg is specially\r\nnoted. Under the influence of the Romantic school, whose influence has\r\nnowhere proved so long-lived as in the Scandinavian north, A.\r\nOhlenschläger began a new era of Danish literature. His productivity,\r\nwhich belongs partly to his native and partly to German literary\r\nhistory, turned from foreign[320] to native themes; and other writers\r\nfollowed him in his endeavours to revive the figures of Northern heroic\r\nlegend. But these themes have in their turn given way in the\r\nScandinavian theatre to subjects coming nearer home to the popular\r\nconsciousness, and treated with a direct appeal to the common experience\r\nof human life, and with a searching insight into the actual motives of\r\nhuman action. The most remarkable movement to be noted in the history of\r\nthe Scandinavian drama, and one of the most widely effective of those\r\nwhich mark the more recent history of the Western drama in general, had\r\nits origin in Norway. Two Norwegian dramatists, H. Ibsen and Björnsterne\r\nBjörnson, standing as it were side by side, though by no means always\r\njudging eye to eye, have vitally influenced the whole course of modern\r\ndramatic literature in the direction of a fearlessly candid and close\r\ndelineation of human nature. The lesser of the pair in inventive genius,\r\nand in the power of exhibiting with scornful defiance the conflict\r\nbetween soul and circumstance, but the stronger by virtue of the\r\nconviction of hope which lies at the root of achievement, is\r\nBjörnson.[321] Ibsen's long career as a dramatist exhibits a succession\r\nof many changes, but at no point any failure in the self-trust of his\r\ngenius. His early masterpieces were dramatic only in form.[322] His\r\nworld-drama of _Emperor and Galilean_ was still unsuited to a stage\r\nrarely trodden to much purpose by idealists of Julian's type. The\r\nbeginnings of his real and revolutionary significance as a dramatist\r\ndate from the production of his first plays of contemporary life, the\r\nadmirable satirical comedy _The Pillars of Society_ (1877), the subtle\r\ndomestic drama _A Doll's House_ (1879), and the powerful but repellent\r\n_Ghosts_ (1881),[323] which last, with the effects of its appearance,\r\nmodern dramatic literature may even to this day be said to have failed\r\naltogether to assimilate. Ibsen's later prose comedies--(verse, he\r\nwrites, has immensely damaged the art of acting, and a tragedy in\r\niambics belongs to the species Dodo)--for the most part written during\r\nan exile which accounts for the note of isolation so audible in many of\r\nthem, succeeded one another at regular biennial intervals, growing more\r\nand more abrupt in form, cruel in method, and intense in elemental\r\ndramatic force. The prophet at last spoke to a listening world, but\r\nwithout the amplitude, the grace and the wholeheartedness which are\r\nnecessary for subduing it. But it may be long before the art which he\r\nhad chosen as the vehicle of his comments on human life and society\r\naltogether ceases to show the impress of his genius.\r\n\r\n\r\nj. _Drama of the Slav Peoples._\r\n\r\n  Polish.\r\n\r\nAs to the history of the Slav drama, only a few hints can be here given.\r\nIts origins have not yet--at least in works accessible to Western\r\nstudents--been authoritatively traced. The Russian drama in its earliest\r\nor religious beginnings is stated to have been introduced from Poland\r\nearly in the 12th century; and, again, it would seem that, when the\r\ninfluence of the Renaissance touched the east of Europe, the religious\r\ndrama was cultivated in Poland in the 16th, but did not find its way\r\ninto Russia till the 17th century. It is probable that the species was,\r\nlike so many other elements of culture, imported into the Carpathian\r\nlands in the 15th or 16th century from Germany. How far indigenous\r\ngrowths, such as the Russian popular puppet-show called _vertep_, which\r\nabout the middle of the 17th century began to treat secular and popular\r\nthemes, helped to foster dramatic tendencies and tastes, cannot here be\r\nestimated. The regular drama of eastern Europe is to all intents and\r\npurposes of Western origin. Thus, the history of the Polish drama may be\r\nfairly dated as beginning with the reign of the last king of Poland,\r\nStanislaus II. Augustus, who in 1765 solemnly opened a national theatre\r\nat Warsaw. This institution was carried on till the fatal year 1794, and\r\nsaw the production of a considerable number of Polish plays, mostly\r\ntranslated or adapted, but in part original--as in the case of one or\r\ntwo of those from the active pen of the secretary to the educational\r\ncommission, Zablonski. But it was not till after the last partition\r\nthat, paradoxically though not wholly out of accordance with the history\r\nof the relations between political and literary history, the attempts of\r\nW. Bogulawski and J. N. Kaminski to establish and carry on a Polish\r\nnational theatre were crowned with success. Its literary mainstay was a\r\ngifted Franco-Pole, Count Alexander Fredro (1793-1876), who in the\r\nperiod between the Napoleonic revival and the long exodus fathered a\r\nlong-lived species of modern Polish comedy, French in origin (for Fredro\r\nwas a true disciple of Molière), and wholly out of contact with the\r\nsentiment that survived in the ashes of a doomed nation.[324] His\r\ncomplaint as to the exiguity of the Polish literary public--a brace of\r\ntheatres and a bookseller's handcart--may have been premature; but a\r\nnational drama was most certainly impossible in a denationalised and\r\ndismembered land, in whose historic capital the theatre in which Polish\r\nplays continued to be produced seemed garrisoned by Cossack officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Russian.\r\n\r\nMuch in the same way, though with a characteristic difference, the\r\nRussian regular drama had its origin in the cadet corps at St\r\nPetersburg, a pupil of which, A. Sumarokov (1718-1777), has been\r\nregarded as the founder of the modern Russian theatre. As a tragic poet\r\nhe seems to have imitated Racine and Voltaire, though treating themes\r\nfrom the national history, among others the famous dramatic subject of\r\nthe False Demetrius. He also translated _Hamlet_. As a comic dramatist\r\nhe is stated to have been less popular than as a tragedian; yet it is in\r\ncomedy that he would seem to have had the most noteworthy successors.\r\nAmong these it is impossible to pass by the empress Catherine II., whose\r\ncomedies seem to have been satirical sketches of the follies and foibles\r\nof her subjects, and who in one comedy as well as in a tragedy had the\r\ncourage to imitate Shakespeare. Comedy aiming at social satire long\r\ncontinued to temper the conditions of Russian society, and had\r\nrepresentatives of mark in such writers as A. N. Ostrovsky of Moscow and\r\nGriboyedov, the author of _Gore et uma_.\r\n\r\nIn any survey of the Slav drama that of the Czech peoples, whose\r\nnational consciousness has so fully reawakened, must not be overlooked.\r\nA Czech theatre was called into life at Prague as early as the 18th\r\ncentury; and in the 19th its demands, centring in a sense of\r\nnationality, were met by J. N. Stepinek (1783-1844), W. C. Klicpera\r\n(1792-1859) and J. C. Tyl (1808-1856); and later writers continued to\r\nmake use of the stage for a propaganda of historical as well as\r\npolitical significance.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The following works treat the general theory of the\r\n  drama and the dramatic art, together with the principles of dramaturgy\r\n  and of the art of acting.

W.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Gallicanus_, part ii.; _Sapientia_.\r\n\r\n  [2] _Gallicanus_, part i.; _Callimachus_; _Abraham_; _Paphnutius_.\r\n\r\n  [3] The passion-play of Oberammergau, familiar in its present\r\n    artistic form to so many visitors, was instituted under special\r\n    circumstances in the days of the Thirty Years' War (1634). Various\r\n    reasons account for its having been allowed to survive.\r\n\r\n  [4] To the earliest group belong _The Castle of Perseverance_;\r\n    _Wisdom who is Christ_; _Mankind_; to the second, or early Tudor\r\n    group, Medwell, _Nature_; _The World and the Child_; _Hycke-Scorner_,\r\n    &c.\r\n\r\n  [5] _Magnyfycence_.\r\n\r\n  [6] _New Custome_; N. Woodes, _The Conflict of Conscience_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [7] _Albyon Knight_.\r\n\r\n  [8] Rastell, _Nature of the Four Elements_; Redford, _Wit and\r\n    Science_; _The Trial of Treasure_; _The Marriage of Wit and Science_.\r\n\r\n  [9] _The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom_; _The Contention between\r\n    Liberality and Prodigality_.\r\n\r\n  [10] _Jack Juggler_; _Tom Tiler and his Wife_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [11] _The Four P's_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [12] _The Disobedient Child_ (c. 1560).\r\n\r\n  [13] The [Greek: Christos paschôn], an artificial Byzantine product,\r\n    probably of the 11th century, glorifying the Virgin in Euripidean\r\n    verse, was not known to the Western world till 1542.\r\n\r\n  [14] Of G. Manzini della Motta's Latin tragedy on the fall of Antonio\r\n    della Scala only a chorus remains. He died after 1389. Probably to\r\n    the earlier half of the century belongs the Latin prose drama\r\n    _Columpnarium_, the story of which, though it ends happily, resembles\r\n    that of _The Cenci_. Later plays in Latin of the historic type are\r\n    the extant Landivio de' Nobili's _De captivitate Ducis Jacobi_ (the\r\n    _condottiere_ Jacopo Piccinino, d. 1464); C. Verardi's _Historia\r\n    Baetica_ (the expulsion of the Moors from Granada) (1492), and the\r\n    game author's _Ferdinandus_ (of Aragon) _Servatus_, which is called a\r\n    tragi-comedy because it is neither tragic nor comic. The Florentine L.\r\n    Dali's _Hiempsal_ (1441-1442) remains in MS. A few tragedies on\r\n    sacred subjects were produced in Italy during the last quarter of the\r\n    15th century, and a little later. Such were the religious dramas\r\n    written for his pupils by P. Domizio, on which Politian cast\r\n    contempt; and the tragedies, following ancient models, of T. da Prato\r\n    of Treviso, B. Campagna of Verona, _De passione Redemptoris_; and G.\r\n    F. Conti, author of _Theandrothanatos_ and numerous vanished plays.\r\n\r\n  [15] _Imber aureus_ (Danae), &c.\r\n\r\n  [16] L. Bruni's _Poliscena_ (c. 1395); Sicco Polentone's (1370-1463)\r\n    jovial _Lusus ebriorum_ s. _De lege bibia_; the papal secretary P.\r\n    Candido Decembrio's (1399-1477) non-extant _Aphrodisia_; L. B.\r\n    Alberti's _Philodoxios_ (1424); Ugolino Pisani of Parma's (d. before\r\n    1462) _Philogenia_ and _Confutatio coquinaria_ (a merry students'\r\n    play); the _Fraudiphila_ of A. Tridentino, also of Parma, who died\r\n    after 1470 and perhaps served Pius II.; Eneo Silvio de' Piccolomini's\r\n    own verse comedy, _Chrisis_, likewise in MS., written in 1444; P.\r\n    Domizio's _Lucinia_, acted in the palace of Lorenzo de' Medici in\r\n    1478, &c.\r\n\r\n  [17] Mondella, _Isifile_ (1582); Fuligni, _Bragadino_ (1589).\r\n\r\n  [18] Home, _Douglas_.\r\n\r\n  [19] Lazzaroni, _Ulisse il giovane_ (1719).\r\n\r\n  [20] _Didone abbandonata_, _Siroe_, _Semiramide_, _Artaserse_,\r\n    _Demetris_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [21] _Cleopatra_, _Antigone_, _Octavia_, _Mirope_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [22] e.g. _Bruto I._ and _II._\r\n\r\n  [23] _Filippo_; _Maria Stuarda_.\r\n\r\n  [24] Pellico, _Francesca da Rimini_; Niccolini, _Giovanni da\r\n    Procida_; _Beatrice Cenci_; Giacometti, _Cola di Rienzi_\r\n    (Giacometti's masterpiece was _La Marte civile_).\r\n\r\n  [25] Pyrogopolinices in the _Miles Gloriosus_.\r\n\r\n  [26] The masked characters, each of which spoke the dialect of the\r\n    place he represented, were (according to Baretti) _Pantalone_, a\r\n    Venetian merchant; _Dottore_, a Bolognese physician; _Spaviento_, a\r\n    Neapolitan braggadocio; _Pullicinella_, a wag of Apulia;\r\n    _Giangurgulo_ and _Coviello_, clowns of Calabria; _Gelfomino_, a\r\n    Roman beau; _Brighella_, a Ferrarese pimp; and _Arlecchino_, a\r\n    blundering servant of Bergamo. Besides these and a few other such\r\n    personages (of whom four at least appeared in each play), there were\r\n    the _Amorosos_ or _Innamoratos_, men or women (the latter not before\r\n    1560, up to which time actresses were unknown in Italy) with serious\r\n    parts, and _Smeraldina_, _Colombina_, _Spilletta_, and other\r\n    _servettas_ or waiting-maids. All these spoke Tuscan or Roman, and\r\n    wore no masks.\r\n\r\n  [27] _Pasitea_.\r\n\r\n  [28] _Amicizia_.\r\n\r\n  [29] _Milesia_.\r\n\r\n  [30] _La Lena_; _Il Negromante_.\r\n\r\n  [31] _La Cassaria_; _I Suppositi_.\r\n\r\n  [32] Of Machiavelli's other comedies, two are prose adaptations from\r\n    Plautus and Terence, _La Clizia_ (Casina) and _Andria_; of the two\r\n    others, simply called _Commedie_, and in verse, his authorship seems\r\n    doubtful.\r\n\r\n  [33] _La Cortigiana_, _La Talanta_, _Il Ipocrito_, _Il Filosofo_.\r\n\r\n  [34] _Momolo Cortesan_ (_Jerome the Accomplished Man_); _La Bottega\r\n    del caffé_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [35] _La Vedova scaltra_ (_The Cunning Widow_); _La Putta onorata_\r\n    (_The Respectable Girl_); _La Buona Figlia_; _La B. Sposa_; _La B.\r\n    Famiglia_; _La B. Madre_ (the last of which was unsuccessful;\r\n    \"goodness,\" says Goldoni, \"never displeases, but the public weary of\r\n    every thing\"), &c.; and _Il Burbero benefico_, called in its original\r\n    French version _Le Bourru bienfaisant_.\r\n\r\n  [36] _Molière_; _Terenzio_; _Tasso_.\r\n\r\n  [37] _Pamela_; _Pamela Maritata_; _Il Filosofo Inglese_ (_Mr\r\n    Spectator_).\r\n\r\n  [38] _L' Amore delle tre melarancie_ (_The Three Lemons_); _Il\r\n    Corvo_.\r\n\r\n  [39] _Turandot_; _Zobeïde_.\r\n\r\n  [40] _L' Amore delle tre m._ (against Goldoni); _L' Angellino\r\n    Belverde_ (_The Small Green Bird_), (against Helvetius, Rousseau and\r\n    Voltaire).\r\n\r\n  [41] _Aspasia_; _Polyxena_.\r\n\r\n  [42] _Ephemeridophobos_.\r\n\r\n  [43] _Timoleon_; _Konstantinos Palaeologos_; _Rhigas of Pherae_.\r\n\r\n  [44] _The Three Hundred_, or _The Character of the Ancient Hellene_\r\n    (Leonidas); _The Death of the Orator_ (Demosthenes); _A Scion of\r\n    Timoleon_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [45] The term is the same as that used in the old French collective\r\n    mysteries (_journées_).\r\n\r\n  [46] In some of his plays (_Comedia Serafina_; _C.

So far back as 1400/1 the corporation of\r\n    Shrewsbury paid rewards to the _histriones_ of Prince Henry and of\r\n    the earl of Stafford, and in 1408/9 reference is made to the players\r\n    of the earl and countess of Arundel, of Lord Powys, of Lord Talbot\r\n    and of Lord Furnival.\r\n\r\n  [172] _The Woman in the Moone_; _Sapho and Phao_.\r\n\r\n  [173] _Alexander and Campaspe._\r\n\r\n  [174] _Endimion_; _Mydas_.\r\n\r\n  [175] _Gallathea._\r\n\r\n  [176] _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay._\r\n\r\n  [177] _The Wounds of Civil War._ With Greene he wrote _A\r\n    Looking-Glass for London_.\r\n\r\n  [178] _Summer's Last Will and Testament_ is his sole entire extant\r\n    play. _Dido, Queen of Carthage_, is by him and Marlowe.\r\n\r\n  [179] _Patient Grissil_ (with Dekker and Haughton).\r\n\r\n  [180] _Hoffman, or A Revenge for a Father._\r\n\r\n  [181] _Henry VIII._\r\n\r\n  [182] Ford, _Perkin Warbeck_.\r\n\r\n  [183] _Edward IV._; _If You Know Not Me_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [184] _Henry VIII._\r\n\r\n  [185] _The Merry Wives of Windsor._\r\n\r\n  [186] Massinger, _The Virgin Martyr_; Shirley, _St Patrick for\r\n    Ireland_.\r\n\r\n  [187] _Cleopatra_; _Philotas_.\r\n\r\n  [188] _Darius_; _Croesus_; _Julius Caesar_; _The Alexandraean\r\n    Tragedy_.\r\n\r\n  [189] _The Sad Shepherd_.\r\n\r\n  [190] _The Faithful Shepherdess._\r\n\r\n  [191] _The Queen's Arcadia._\r\n\r\n  [192] _Sejanus his Fall_; _Catiline his Conspiracy_.\r\n\r\n  [193] _Bussy d'Ambois_; _The Revenge of B. d'A._; _The Conspiracy of\r\n    Byron_; _The Tragedy of B._; _Chabot, Admiral of France_ (with\r\n    Shirley).\r\n\r\n  [194] _Arden of Faversham_; _A Yorkshire Tragedy_.\r\n\r\n  [195] _A Woman killed with Kindness_; _The English Traveller_.\r\n\r\n  [196] _Vittoria Coromboni_; _The Duchess of Malfi_.\r\n\r\n  [197] _'Tis Pity She's a Whore_; _The Broken Heart_.\r\n\r\n  [198] _Every Man in his Humour_; _Every Man out of his Humour_.\r\n\r\n  [199] Shadwell, _The Humorists_.\r\n\r\n  [200] It is impossible in a summary survey to seek to discriminate by\r\n    any kind of evidence the respective shares in many Elizabethan plays,\r\n    and the respective credit due to them, of the joint writers. Yet some\r\n    such inquiry is necessary before judging the claims to remembrance of\r\n    highly-gifted dramatists such as William Rowley, his namesake Samuel,\r\n    John Day, and not a few others.\r\n\r\n  [201] The Latin comedy _Victoria_ by Abraham Fraunce of St John's was\r\n    written some time before 1583, and dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney;\r\n    but there is no evidence to show that it was ever acted.\r\n\r\n  [202] (Bishop) Hacket's _Loyola_ was acted at Trinity in 1623.\r\n\r\n  [203] _Naufragium joculare--The Guardian_ (rewritten later as _The\r\n    Cutter of Coleman Street_).\r\n\r\n  [204] Chapman, Marston (and Jonson), _Eastward Hoe_ (1605);\r\n    Middleton, _A Game at Chess_ (1624); Shirley and Chapman, _The Ball_\r\n    (1632); Massinger(?), _The Spanish Viceroy_ (1634).\r\n\r\n  [205] _Twelfth Night._\r\n\r\n  [206] _The Puritan, or the Widow of Watling Street_, by \"W.

Though during his long exile in\r\n    England--from 1670 to his death--he never learned English, his\r\n    critical works included _Remarks on English Comedy_ (1677), and one\r\n    of his own comedies, the celebrated _Sir Politick Would-be_,\r\n    professed to be composed \"_à la manière angloise_.\"\r\n\r\n  [226] _Epsom Wells_; _The Squire of Alsatia_; _The Volunteers._\r\n\r\n  [227] A dramatic curiosity of a rare kind would be _The Female\r\n    Rebellion_ (1682), which has been, on evidence rather striking at\r\n    first sight, attributed to Sir Thomas Browne.

It is a curious fact that in the first decade of the reign of\r\n    George III. a severe control of the theatre was very actively exerted\r\n    after a positive as well as a negative fashion--objectionable\r\n    passages being ruthlessly suppressed and plays actually written and\r\n    licensed for the purpose of upholding the existing régime.\r\n\r\n  [249] J.

E. of Stettin, on the railway\r\nRuhnow-Neustettin. Pop. 5800. It contains an Evangelical church, a\r\ngymnasium, a hospital and various administrative offices, and carries on\r\ncotton and woollen weaving, tanning, brewing and distilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMMEN, a seaport of Norway, in Buskerud and Jarlsberg-Laurvik _amter_\r\n(counties), at the head of Drammen Fjord, a western arm of Christiania\r\nFjord, 33 m. by rail S. W. from Christiania. Pop. (1900) 23,093. Its\r\nsituation, at the mouth of the broad Drammen river, between lofty hills,\r\nis very beautiful. It is the junction of railways from Christiania to\r\nHaugsund, Kongsberg and Hönefos, and to Laurvik and Skien. The town is\r\nmodern, having suffered from fires in 1866, 1870 and 1880. It consists\r\nof three parts: Bragernaes on the north, divided by the river from\r\nStrömsö and the port, Tangen, on the south. The prosperity of Drammen\r\ndepends mainly on the timber trade; and saw-milling is an active\r\nindustry, the logs being floated down the river from the upland\r\nforests. Timber and wood-pulp are exported (over half of each to Great\r\nBritain), with paper, ice and some cobalt and nickel ore. The chief\r\nimports are British coal and German machinery. Salmon are taken in the\r\nupper reaches of the Drammen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRANE, AUGUSTA THEODOSIA (1823-1894), English writer, was born at\r\nBromley, near Bow, on the 29th of December 1823. Brought up in the\r\nAnglican creed, she fell under the influence of Tractarian teaching at\r\nTorquay, and joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1850. She wrote, and\r\npublished anonymously, an essay questioning the _Morality of\r\nTractarianism_, which was attributed to John Henry Newman. In 1852,\r\nafter a prolonged stay in Rome, she joined the third order of St\r\nDominic, to which she belonged for over forty years. She was prioress\r\n(1872-1881) of the Stone convent in Staffordshire, where she died on the\r\n29th of April 1894. Her chief works in prose and verse are: _The History\r\nof Saint Dominic_ (1857; enlarged edition, 1891); _The Life of St\r\nCatherine of Siena_ (1880; 2nd ed., 1899); _Christian Schools and\r\nScholars_ (1867); _The Knights of St John_ (1858); _Songs in the Night_\r\n(1876); and the _Three Chancellors_ (1859), a sketch of the lives of\r\nWilliam of Wykeham, William of Waynflete and Sir Thomas More.\r\n\r\n  A complete list of her writings is given in the _Memoir of Mother\r\n  Francis Raphael, O.S.D., Augusta Theodosia Drane_, edited by B.\r\n  Wilberforce, O.P. (London, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAPER, JOHN WILLIAM (1811-1882), American scientist, was born at St\r\nHelen's, near Liverpool, on the 5th of May 1811. He studied at Woodhouse\r\nGrove, at the University of London, and, after removing to America in\r\n1832, at the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania in\r\n1835-1836. In 1837 he was elected professor of chemistry in the\r\nUniversity of the City of New York, and was a professor in its school of\r\nmedicine in 1840-1850, president of that school in 1850-1873, and\r\nprofessor of chemistry until 1881. He died at Hastings, New York, on the\r\n4th of January 1882. He made important researches in photo-chemistry,\r\nmade portrait photography possible by his improvements (1839) on\r\nDaguerre's process, and published a _Text-book on Chemistry_ (1846),\r\n_Text-book on Natural Philosophy_ (1847), _Text-book on Physiology_\r\n(1866), and _Scientific Memoirs_ (1878) on radiant energy. He is well\r\nknown also as the author of _The History of the Intellectual Development\r\nof Europe_ (1862), applying the methods of physical science to history,\r\na _History of the American Civil War_ (3 vols., 1867-1870), and a\r\n_History of the Conflict between Religion and Science_ (1874).\r\n\r\nHis son, HENRY DRAPER (1837-1882), graduated at the University of New\r\nYork in 1858, became professor of natural science there in 1860, and was\r\nprofessor of physiology (in the medical school) and dean of the faculty\r\nin 1866-1873. He succeeded his father as professor of chemistry, but\r\nonly for a year, dying in New York on the 20th of November 1882. Henry\r\nDraper's most important contributions to science were made in\r\nspectroscopy; he ruled metal gratings in 1869-1870, made valuable\r\nspectrum photographs after 1871, and proved the presence of oxygen in\r\nthe sun in a monograph of 1877. Edward C. Pickering carried on his study\r\nof stellar spectra with the funds of the Henry Draper Memorial at\r\nHarvard, endowed by his widow (_née_ Mary Anna Palmer).\r\n\r\n  See accounts by George F. Barker in _Biographical Memoirs of the\r\n  National Academy of Science_, vols. 2 and 3 (Washington, 1886, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAPER, one who deals in cloth or textiles generally. The Fr. _drap_,\r\ncloth, from which _drapier_ and Eng. \"draper\" are derived, is of obscure\r\norigin. It is possible that the Low Lat. _drappus_ or _trappus_ (the\r\nlast form giving the Eng. \"trappings\") may be connected with words such\r\nas \"drub,\" Ger. _treffen_, beat; the original sense would be fulled\r\ncloth. \"Drab,\" dull, pale, brown, is also connected, its first meaning\r\nbeing a cloth of a natural undyed colour. The Drapers' Company is one of\r\nthe great livery companies of the city of London. The fraternity is of\r\nvery early origin. Henry Fitz-Alwyn (d. 1212?), the first mayor of\r\nLondon, is said to have been a draper. The first charter was granted in\r\n1364. The Drapers' Gild was one of the numerous subdivisions of the\r\nclothing trade, and appeared to have been confined to the retailing of\r\nwoollen cloths, the linen-drapers forming in the 15th century a separate\r\nfraternity, which disappeared or was merged in the greater company. It\r\nis usual for drapers to combine the sale of \"drapery,\" i.e. of textiles\r\ngenerally, with that of millinery, hosiery, &c. In _Wills_ v. _Adams_\r\n(reported in _The Times_, London, Nov. 20, 1908), the term \"drapery\" in\r\na restrictive covenant was held not to include all goods that a draper\r\nmight sell, such as furs or fur-lined goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAUGHT (from the common Teutonic word \"to draw\"; cf. Ger. _Tracht_,\r\nload; the pronunciation led to the variant form \"draft,\" now confined to\r\ncertain specific meanings), the act or action of drawing, extending,\r\npulling, &c. It is thus applied to animals used for drawing vehicles or\r\nloads, \"draught oxen,\" &c., to the quantity of fish taken by one \"drag\"\r\nof a net, to a quantity of liquid taken or \"drawn in\" to the mouth, and\r\nto a current of air in a chimney, a room or other confined space. In\r\nfurnaces the \"draught\" is \"natural\" when not increased artificially, or\r\n\"forced\" when increased by mechanical methods (see BOILER). The water a\r\nship \"draws,\" or her \"draught,\" is the depth to which she sinks in the\r\nwater as measured from her keel. The word was formerly used of a \"move\"\r\nin chess or similar games, and is thus, in the plural, the general\r\nEnglish name of the game known also as \"checkers\" (see DRAUGHTS). The\r\nspelling \"draft\" is generally employed in the following usages. It is a\r\ncommon term for a written order \"drawn on\" a banker or other holder of\r\nfunds for the payment of money to a third person; thus a cheque (q.v.)\r\nis a draft. A special form of draft is a \"banker's draft,\" an\r\ninstruction by one bank to another bank, or to a branch of the bank\r\nmaking the instruction, to pay a sum of money to the order of a certain\r\nspecified person. Other meanings of \"draft\" are an outline, plan or\r\nsketch, or a preliminary drawing up of an instrument, measure, document,\r\n&c., which, after alteration and amendment, will be embodied in a final\r\nor formal shape; an allowance made by merchants or importers to those\r\nwho sell by retail, to make up a loss incurred in weighing or measuring;\r\nand a detachment or body of troops \"drawn off\" for a specific purpose,\r\nusually a reinforcement from the depot or reserve units to those abroad\r\nor in the field. For the use of the term \"draft\" or \"draught\" in masonry\r\nand architecture see DRAFTED MASONRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAUGHTS (from A.S. _dragan_, to draw), a game played with pieces (or\r\n\"men\") called draughtsmen on a board marked in squares of two alternate\r\ncolours. The game is called Checkers in America, and is known to the\r\nFrench as _Les Dames_ and to the Germans as _Damenspiel_. Though the\r\ngame is not mentioned in the _Complete Gamester_, nor the _Académie de\r\njeux_, and is styled a \"modern invention\" by Strutt, yet a somewhat\r\nsimilar game was known to the Egyptians, some of the pieces used having\r\nbeen found in tombs at least as old as 1600 B.C., and part of Anect\r\nHat-Shepsa's board and some of her men are to be seen in the Egyptian\r\ngallery of the British Museum. An Egyptian vase also shows a lion and an\r\nantelope playing at draughts, with five men each, the lion making the\r\nwinning move and seizing the bag or purse that contains the stakes.\r\nPlato ascribes the invention of the game of [Greek: pessoi], or\r\ndraughts, to Thoth, the Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus, and Homer\r\nrepresents Penelope's suitors as playing it (_Odyss._ i. 107). In one\r\nform of the game as played by the Greeks there were 25 squares, and each\r\nplayer had 5 men which were probably moved along the lines. In another\r\nthere were 4 men and 16 squares with a \"sacred enclosure,\" a square of\r\nthe same size as the others, marked in the exact centre and bisected by\r\none of the horizontal lines, which was known as the \"sacred line.\" From\r\nthe incident in the game of a piece hemmed in on this line by a rival\r\npiece having to be pushed forward as a last resort, arose the phrase \"to\r\nmove the man from the sacred line\" as synonymous with being hard\r\npressed. This and other phrases based on incidents in the game testify\r\nto the vogue the game enjoyed in ancient Greece. The Roman game of\r\n_Latrunculi_ was similar, but there were officers (kings in modern\r\ndraughts) as well as men. When a player's pieces were all hemmed in he\r\nwas stale-mated, to use a chess phrase (_ad incitas redactus est_), and\r\nlost the game. Other explanations of this phrase are, however, given\r\n(see _Les Jeux des anciens_, by Becq de Fouquières). The fullest account\r\nof the Roman game is to be found in the _De laude Pisonis_, written by\r\nan anonymous contemporary of Nero (see CALPURNIUS, TITUS). Unfortunately\r\nthe texts are full of obscurities, so that it is difficult to make any\r\ndefinite statements as to how the game was played.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 11th century some form of the game was practised by the\r\nNorsemen, for in the Icelandic saga of Grettir the Strong the board and\r\nmen are mentioned more than once.\r\n\r\nThe history of the modern forms of the game starts with _El Ingenio o\r\njuego de marro, de punto o damas_, published by Torquemada at Valencia\r\nin 1547. Another Spaniard, Juan Garcia Canalejas, is said to have\r\npublished in 1610 the first edition of his work, a better-known edition\r\nof which appeared in 1650. The third Spanish classic, that of Joseph\r\nCarlos Garcez, was printed in Madrid in 1684. It is noteworthy that in\r\nan illustration in Garcez's book the pieces depicted resemble somewhat\r\nsome of those used by the Egyptians, and are not unlike the pawns used\r\nin chess.\r\n\r\nIn 1668 Pierre Mallet had published the first French work on the game,\r\nand elementary though his knowledge of the game seems to have been, even\r\nin comparison with that of Canalejas or Garcez, the historical notes,\r\nrules and instructions which he gave, served as a basis for many later\r\nworks. Mallet wrote on _Le Jeu de dames à la française_, which was\r\nalmost identical with the modern English game. The old French game is,\r\nhowever, no longer practised in France, having been superseded by _Le\r\nJeu de dames à la polonaise_. Manoury gives reasons for believing that\r\nthe latter game originated in Paris about 1727.\r\n\r\nAbout 1736 a famous player named Laclef published the first book on\r\nPolish draughts, but the first important book on the game is Manoury's\r\n_Jeu de dames à la polonaise_, in the production of which it is said\r\nthat the author had the assistance of Diderot and other\r\n_encyclopédistes_. This book, which appeared in 1787, was to the new\r\ngame all that Mallet's was to the old French game, and until the\r\nappearance of Poirson Prugneaux's _Encyclopédie du jeu de dames_ in 1855\r\nit remained the standard authority on so-called Polish draughts. The\r\nPolish game early attained popularity in Holland, and in 1785 the\r\nstandard Dutch work, Ephraim van Embden's _Verhandeling over het\r\nDamspel_, was produced. In German-speaking countries the progress of the\r\nnew game was slower, and the works produced in the first half of the\r\n19th century generally treat of the older game as well as the Polish\r\ngame. This is also the case with Petroff's book published in St\r\nPetersburg in 1827; and similarly Zongono's, which dates from 1832,\r\ndeals with the new game and with the older Italian game.\r\n\r\nIn 1694 Hyde wrote _Historia dami ludi seu latrinculorum_, in which he\r\ntried to prove the identity of draughts with _ludus latrinculorum_. This\r\nwork is historical and descriptive, but contains nothing concerning the\r\ngame as played in Great Britain. The authentic history of draughts in\r\nEngland commences with William Payne's _Introduction to the Game of\r\nDraughts_, the dedication of which was written by Samuel Johnson.\r\nPayne's games and problems were incorporated in a much more important\r\nwork, namely Sturges's _Guide to the Game of Draughts_, which appeared\r\nin 1800 and has gone through a score of editions. About this time the\r\ngame was much practised in both England and Scotland, but the first\r\nimportant production of the Scottish school was Drummond's _Scottish\r\nDraught Player_, the first part of which dates from 1838, additional\r\nvolumes appearing in 1851-1853 and 1861. In 1852 Andrew Anderson\r\npublished his _Game of Draughts Simplified_. A first edition had\r\nappeared in 1848, but the later print is the important one, as it\r\nstandardized the laws of the game, fixed the nomenclature of the\r\nopenings, introduced a better arrangement of the play, and, since\r\nAnderson was one of the finest players of the game, excelled in\r\naccuracy. In Anderson's time little was known about the openings\r\ncommencing with any move other than 11-15, and it was not until more\r\nthan thirty years later that the other openings received more adequate\r\nrecognition. This was done in Robertson's _Guide to the Game of\r\nDraughts_, and perhaps better in Lees' _Guide_ (1892).\r\n\r\nAndrew Anderson was the first recognized British champion player of the\r\ngame. He and Wyllie, better known as \"the herd laddie,\" contested five\r\nmatches for the honour, Anderson winning four to Wyllie's one. After his\r\nvictory in 1847 Anderson retired from match play and the title fell to\r\nWyllie, who made the game his profession and travelled all over the\r\nEnglish-speaking world to play it. In 1872 he successfully defended his\r\nposition against Martins, the English champion, and in 1874 against W.\r\nR. Barker, the American champion, but two years later he was beaten by\r\nYates, a young American. On the latter's retirement from the game, the\r\nchampionship lapsed to Wyllie, who held it successfully until his defeat\r\nby Ferrie, the Scottish champion, in 1894. Two years later Ferrie was\r\nbeaten in his turn by Richard Jordan of Edinburgh, who had just gained\r\nthe Scottish championship; and the new holder defeated Stewart, who\r\nchallenged him in 1897, and successfully defended his title against C.\r\nF. Barker, the American champion, to meet whom he visited Boston in 1900\r\nand played a drawn match.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the first international match between England and Scotland took\r\nplace, and resulted in so decisive a victory for the northerners that\r\nthe contest was not renewed for ten years. The matches played in 1894\r\nand 1899 also went strongly in favour of the Scots, but in 1903 the\r\nEnglishmen gained their first victory.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 a British team visited America and defeated a side representing\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe tournament for the Scottish championship has been held annually in\r\nGlasgow since 1893. The number and skill of the Scottish players have\r\ngiven this tournament its pre-eminence; but if the levelling up of the\r\nstandards of play in Scotland and England continues, the competition\r\nwhich is held biennially by the English Draughts Association is likely\r\nto rank as a serious rival to the Glasgow tourney.\r\n\r\n_The English Game._--Draughts as played now in English-speaking\r\ncountries is a game for two persons with a board and twenty-four\r\nmen--twelve white and twelve black--which at starting are placed as\r\nfollows: the black men on the squares numbered 1 to 12, and the white\r\nmen on the squares numbered 21 to 32 on the diagram below. In printed\r\ndiagrams the men are usually shown on the white squares for the sake of\r\nclearness, but in actual play the black squares are generally used now.\r\nIn playing on the black squares the board must be placed with a black\r\nsquare in the left-hand corner. The game is played by moving a man\r\nforward, one square at a time except when making a capture, along the\r\ndiagonals to the right or left. Thus a white man placed on square 18 in\r\nthe diagram can move to 15 or 14. Each player moves alternately, black\r\nalways moving first. If a player touch a piece he must move that piece\r\nand no other. If the piece cannot be moved, or if it is not the player's\r\nturn to move, he forfeits the game. As soon as a man reaches one of the\r\nsquares farthest from his side of the board, he is \"crowned\" by having\r\none of the unused or captured men of his own colour placed on him, and\r\nbecomes a \"king.\" A king has the power of moving and taking backwards as\r\nwell as forwards.\r\n\r\n               BLACK.\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |   | 1 |   | 2 |   | 3 |   | 4 |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  | 5 |   | 6 |   | 7 |   | 8 |   |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |   | 9 |   |10 |   |11 |   |12 |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |13 |   |14 |   |15 |   |16 |   |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |   |17 |   |18 |   |19 |   |20 |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |21 |   |22 |   |23 |   |24 |   |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |   |25 |   |26 |   |27 |   |28 |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |29 |   |30 |   |31 |   |32 |   |\r\n  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n               WHITE.\r\n\r\nIf a man is on the square adjacent to an opponent's man, and there is an\r\nunoccupied square beyond, the unprotected man must be captured and\r\nremoved from the board. Thus, if there is a white man on square 18, and\r\na black man on square 14, square 9 being vacant, and white having to\r\nmove, he jumps over 14 and remains on square 9, and the man on 14 is\r\ntaken up.\r\n\r\nIf two or more men are so placed that one square intervenes between\r\neach they may all be taken at one move. Thus if white having to move has\r\na man on 28, and black men on 24, 16 and 8, the intermediate squares and\r\nsquare 3 being vacant, white could move from 28 to 3, touching 19 and 12\r\nen route, and take the men on 24, 16, and 8; but if there is a piece on\r\n7 and square 10 is vacant, the piece on 7 cannot be captured, for\r\nbecoming a king ends the move.\r\n\r\nIt is compulsory to take if possible. If a player can take a man (or a\r\nseries of men) but makes a move that does not capture (or does not\r\ncapture all that is possible), his adversary may allow the move to\r\nstand, or he may have the move retracted and compel the player to take,\r\nor he may allow the move to stand and remove the piece, that neglected\r\nto capture from the board (called \"huffing\"). \"Huff and move\" go\r\ntogether, i.e. the player who huffs then makes his move. When one player\r\nhas lost all his pieces, or has all those left on the board blocked, he\r\nloses the game.\r\n\r\nThe game is drawn when neither of the players has sufficient advantage\r\nin force or position to enable him to win.\r\n\r\nThe losing game, or \"first off the board,\" is a form of draughts not\r\nmuch practised now by expert draught players. The player wins who gets\r\nall his pieces taken first. There is no \"huffing\"; a player who can take\r\nmust do so.\r\n\r\n  _Draughts Openings._--As there are seven possible first moves, with\r\n  seven possible replies to each, or forty-nine in all, there is an\r\n  abundant variety of openings; but as two of these (9-14, 21-17 and\r\n  10-14, 21-17) are obviously unsound, the number is really reduced to\r\n  forty-seven. Much difference of opinion exists regarding the relative\r\n  strength of the various openings. It was at one time generally held\r\n  that for the black side 11-15 was the best opening move.\r\n\r\n  Towards the end of the 19th century this view became much modified,\r\n  and though 11-15 still remained the favourite, it was recognized that\r\n  10-15, 9-14 and 11-16 were little, if at all, inferior; 10-14 and\r\n  12-16 were rightly rated as weaker than the four moves named above,\r\n  whilst 9-13, the favourite of the \"unscientific\" player, was found to\r\n  be weakest of all.\r\n\r\n  The white replies to 11-15 have gone through many vicissitudes. The\r\n  seven possible moves have each at different times figured as the\r\n  general favourite. Thus 24-19, which analysis proved to be the weakest\r\n  of the seven, was at one period described by the title of \"Wyllie's\r\n  Invincible.\" In course of time it came to be regarded as decidedly\r\n  weak, and its name was altered to the less pretentious title of\r\n  \"Second Double Corner.\" In the Scottish Tournament of 1894 this\r\n  opening was played between Ferrie and Stewart, and the latter won the\r\n  game with white, introducing new play which has stood the test of\r\n  analysis, and so rehabilitating the opening in public favour. The\r\n  21-17 reply to 11-15 was introduced by Wyllie, who was so successful\r\n  with it that it became known as the \"Switcher.\" This opening perhaps\r\n  lacks the solid strength of some of the others, but it so abounds in\r\n  traps as to be well worthy of its name. The other five replies to\r\n  11-15, namely 24-20, 23-19, 23-18, 22-18 and 22-17, are productive of\r\n  games which give equal chances to both sides.\r\n\r\n  The favourite replies to 10-15 are 23-18, 22-18 and 21-17, but they do\r\n  not appear to be appreciably stronger than the others, with the\r\n  possible exception of 24-20.\r\n\r\n  In response to 11-16, 23-18 is held to give white a trifling\r\n  advantage, but it is more apparent than real. With the exception of\r\n  23-19, which is weak, the other replies are of equal strength, and are\r\n  only slightly, if at all, inferior to the more popular 23-18. 9-14 is\r\n  most frequently encountered by 22-18, but all white's replies are\r\n  good, except of course 21-17 which loses a man, and 23-18 which\r\n  weakens the centre of white's position.\r\n\r\n  Against 10-14 the most popular move is 22-17, which gives white an\r\n  advantage. Next in strength come 22-18 and 24-19. 23-18 is weak.\r\n\r\n  The strongest reply to 12-16 is 24-20. The others, except 23-19, which\r\n  is weak, give no initial advantage to either side.\r\n\r\n  As already mentioned, 9-13 is black's weakest opening move, both 22-18\r\n  and 24-19 giving white a distinct advantage. Nevertheless 9-13 is a\r\n  favourite début with certain expert players, especially when playing\r\n  with inferior opponents.\r\n\r\n  The term \"opening\" is frequently applied in a more restricted sense\r\n  than that used above. When practically all games started with 11-15 it\r\n  was convenient to assign names to the more popular lines of play. Thus\r\n  11-15, 23-19, 8-11, 22-17, if followed by 11-16, was called the\r\n  \"Glasgow\"; if followed by 9-13, 17-14, the \"Laird and Lady\"; if by\r\n  3-8, the \"Alma.\"\r\n\r\n  The variety possible in the opening is a fair reply to the objection\r\n  sometimes heard that the game does not afford sufficient scope for\r\n  variation. As a matter of fact a practically unlimited number of\r\n  different games might be played on any one opening.\r\n\r\n  The three following games are typical examples of the play arising\r\n  from three of the most frequently played openings:--\r\n\r\n        Game No. 1.--\"Ayrshire Lassie\" Opening.\r\n\r\n    a 11-15  25-18    10-15  22-17  b 15-18  24-6\r\n    a 24-20   3-8     23-19  13-22    24-20   2-9\r\n       8-11  26-22     6-10  26-17    18-27  17-10\r\n                   c}\r\n      28-24   5-9  d} 27-23  11-16    31-24   8-11\r\n\r\n       9-13  30-26     9-14  20-11    16-23   Drawn.\r\n      22-18   1-5     18-9    7-16    20-16  R.

Jacques and Campbell.\r\n\r\n  _Other Varieties._--The forms of draughts practised on the European\r\n  continent differ in some respects from the English variety, chiefly in\r\n  respect of the power assigned to a man after \"crowning.\" The game of\r\n  _Polish Draughts_ is played in France, Holland, Belgium and Poland,\r\n  where it has entirely superseded _Le Jeu de dames à la française_. It\r\n  is played on a board of 100 squares with 20 men a side. The men move\r\n  and capture as in English draughts, except that in capturing they move\r\n  either forward or backward. A crowned man becomes a queen, and can\r\n  move any number of squares along the diagonal. In her capture she\r\n  takes any unguarded man or queen in any diagonal she commands, leaping\r\n  over the captured man or queen and remaining on any unoccupied square\r\n  she chooses of the same diagonal, beyond the piece taken. But if there\r\n  is another unguarded man she is bound to choose the diagonal on which\r\n  it can be taken. For example (using an English draught-board) place a\r\n  queen on square 29 and adverse men at squares 22, 16, 24, 14. The\r\n  queen is bound to move from 29 to 11, 20, 27, and having made the\r\n  captures to remain at 9 or 5, whichever she prefers. The capturing\r\n  queen or man must take all the adverse pieces that are _en prise_, or\r\n  that become so by the uncovering of any square from which a piece has\r\n  been removed during the capture, e.g. white queen at square 7, black\r\n  at squares 10, 18, 19, 22 and 27, the queen captures at 10, 22, 27 and\r\n  19, and the piece at 22 being now removed, she must go to 15, take the\r\n  man at 18, and stay at 22, 25 or 29. In consequence of the intricacy\r\n  of some of these moves, it is customary to remove every captured piece\r\n  as it is taken. If a man arrives at a crowning square when taking, and\r\n  he can still continue to take, he must do so, and not stay on the\r\n  crowning square as at draughts. Passing a crowning square in taking\r\n  does not entitle him to be made a queen. In capturing, the player must\r\n  choose the direction by which he can take the greatest number of men\r\n  or queens, or he may be huffed. Numerical power is the criterion, e.g.\r\n  three men must be taken in preference to two queens. If the numbers\r\n  are equal and one force comprises more queens than the other, the\r\n  player may take whichever lot he chooses. This form of draughts,\r\n  played on a board of 144 squares with 30 men a side, is extensively\r\n  practised by British soldiers in India.\r\n\r\n  The German _Damenspiel_ is Polish draughts played on a board of the\r\n  same size and with the same number of men as in the English game. It\r\n  is sometimes called Minor Polish draughts, and is practised in Germany\r\n  and Russia.\r\n\r\n  The _Italian game_ differs from the English in two important\r\n  particulars--a man may not take a king, and when a player has the\r\n  option of capturing pieces in more than one way he must take in the\r\n  manner which captures most pieces. There is a difference too in the\r\n  placing of the board, the black square in the corner of the board\r\n  being at the player's right hand, but until a king is obtained the\r\n  differences from the English system are unimportant in practice.\r\n\r\n  In _Spanish draughts_ the board is set as for the Italian game. The\r\n  men move as in English draughts, but, in capturing, the largest\r\n  possible number of pieces must be taken, and the king has the same\r\n  powers as in the Polish game. The game does not differ essentially\r\n  from the English game until a king is obtained, and many games from\r\n  Spanish works will be found incorporated in English books. Sometimes\r\n  the game is played with 11 men and a king, or 10 men and 2 kings a\r\n  side, instead of the regulation 12 men.\r\n\r\n  _Turkish draughts_ differs widely from all other modern varieties of\r\n  the game. It is played on a board of 64 squares, all of which are used\r\n  in play. Each player has 16 pieces, which are not placed on the two\r\n  back rows of squares, as in chess, but on the second and third back\r\n  rows. The pieces do not move diagonally as in other forms of the game,\r\n  but straight forward or to the right or left horizontally. The king\r\n  has the same command of a horizontal or vertical row of squares that\r\n  the queen in Polish draughts has over a diagonal. Capturing is\r\n  compulsory, and the greatest possible number of pieces must be taken,\r\n  captured pieces being removed one at a time as taken.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Falkener's _Games Ancient and Oriental_; Lees' _Guide to\r\n  the Game of Draughts_; Drummond's _Scottish Draught Players_ (Kear's\r\n  reprint); Gould's _Memorable Matches_ and _Book of Problems_, &c.

She is an important character in\r\nthe _Mahabharata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAVE, or DRAVA (Ger. _Drau_, Hung. _Dráva_, Lat. _Dravus_), one of the\r\nprincipal right-bank affluents of the Danube, flowing through Austria\r\nand Hungary. It rises below the Innichner Eck, near the Toblacher Feld\r\nin Tirol, at an altitude of a little over 4000 ft., runs eastward, and\r\nforms the longest longitudinal valley of the Alps. The Drave has a total\r\nlength of 450 m., while the length of its Alpine valley to Marburg is\r\n150 m., and to its junction with the Mur 250 m. Owing to its great\r\nextent and easy accessibility the valley of the Drave was the principal\r\nroad through which the invading peoples of the East, as the Huns, the\r\nSlavs and the Turks, penetrated the Alpine countries. The Drave flows\r\nthrough Carinthia and Styria, and enters Hungary near Friedau, where up\r\nto its confluence with the Danube, at Almas, 14 m. E. of Esseg, it forms\r\nthe boundary between that country and Croatia-Slavonia. At its mouth the\r\nDrave attains a breadth of 1055 ft. and a depth of 20 ft. The Drave is\r\nnavigable for rafts only from Villach, and for steamers from Bárcs, a\r\ndistance of 95 m. The principal affluents of the Drave are: on the left\r\nthe Isel, the Gurk, the Lavant, and the largest of all, the Mur; and on\r\nthe right the Gail and the Drann.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAVIDIAN (Sanskrit _Dravida_), the name given to a collection of Indian\r\npeoples, and their family of languages[1] comprising all the principal\r\nforms of speech of Southern India. Their territory, which also includes\r\nthe northern half of Ceylon, extends northwards up to an irregular line\r\ndrawn from a point on the Arabian Sea about 100 m. below Goa along the\r\nWestern Ghats as far as Kolhapur, thence north-east through Hyderabad,\r\nand farther eastwards to the Bay of Bengal. Farther to the north we find\r\nDravidian dialects spoken by small tribes in the Central Provinces and\r\nChota Nagpur, and even up to the banks of the Ganges in the Rajmahal\r\nhills. A Dravidian dialect is, finally, spoken by the Br[=a]h[=u][=i]s\r\nof Baluchistan in the far north-west. The various Dravidian languages,\r\nwith the number of speakers returned at the census of 1901, are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Tamil             17,494,901\r\n  Malay[=a]lam       6,022,131\r\n  Kanarese          10,368,515\r\n  Tulu                 535,210\r\n  Kodagu                39,191\r\n  Toda                     805\r\n  K[=o]ta                1,300\r\n  Kuru[chi]            609,721\r\n  Malto                 60,777\r\n  G[=o]nd[=i]        1,125,479\r\n  Kui                  494,099\r\n  Telugu            20,697,264\r\n  Br[=a]h[=u][=i]       48,589\r\n                    ----------\r\n  Total             57,497,982\r\n\r\nOf these Tamil and Malay[=a]lam can be considered as two dialects of one\r\nand the same language, which is, in its turn, closely related to\r\nKanarese. Tulu, Kodagu, Toda and K[=o]ta can be described as lying\r\nbetween Tamil-Malay[=a]lam and Kanarese, though they are more nearly\r\nrelated to the latter than to the former. The same is the case with\r\nKuru[chi] and Malto, while Kui and G[=o]nd[=i] gradually approach\r\nTelugu, which latter language seems to have branched off from the common\r\nstock at an early date. Finally, the Br[=a]h[=u][=i] dialect of\r\nBaluchistan has been so much influenced by other languages that it is no\r\nlonger a pure Dravidian form of speech.\r\n\r\nThe Dravidian languages have for ages been restricted to the territory\r\nthey occupy at the present day. Moreover, they are gradually losing\r\nground in the north, where they meet with Aryan forms of speech. If we\r\ncompare the caste tables and the language tables in the Indian census of\r\n1901 we find that only 1,125,479 out of the 2,286,913 G[=o]nds returned\r\nwere stated to speak the Dravidian G[=o]nd[=i]. Similarly only 1505 out\r\nof 17,187 K[=o]l[=a]ms entered their language as K[=o]l[=a]m[=i]. Such\r\ntribes are gradually becoming Hinduized. Their language adopts an\r\never-increasing Aryan element till it is quite superseded by Aryan\r\nspeech. In the north-eastern part of the Dravidian territory, to the\r\neast of Chanda and Bhandara, the usual state of affairs is that\r\nDravidian dialects are spoken in the hills while Aryan forms of speech\r\nprevail in the plains. The Dravidian Kui thus stands out as an isolated\r\nisland in the sea of Aryan speech.\r\n\r\nThis process has been going on from time immemorial. The Dravidians were\r\nalready settled in India when the Aryans arrived from the north-west.\r\nThe fair Aryans were at once struck by their dark hue, and named them\r\naccordingly _krisna tvac_, the black skin. In the course of time,\r\nhowever, the two races began to mix, and it is still possible to trace a\r\nDravidian element in the Aryan languages of North India.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of anthropology is to the same effect. Most speakers of\r\nDravidian languages belong to a distinct anthropological type which is\r\nknown as the Dravidian. \"The Dravidian race,\" says Sir H. Risley, \"the\r\nmost primitive of the Indian types, occupies the oldest geological\r\nformation in India, the medley of forest-clad ranges, terraced plateaus,\r\nand undulating plains which stretches, roughly speaking, from the\r\nVindhyas to Cape Comorin. On the east and west of the peninsular area\r\nthe domain of the Dravidian is conterminous with the Ghats, while\r\nfarther north it reaches on one side to the Aravallis and on the other\r\nto the Rajmahal hills.\"\r\n\r\nThis territory is the proper home of the race. A strong Dravidian\r\nelement can, however, also be traced in the population of northern\r\nIndia. In Kashmir and Punjab, where the Aryans had already settled in\r\nthose prehistoric times when the Vedic hymns were composed, the\r\nprevailing type is the Aryan one. The same is the case in Rajputana.\r\nFrom the eastern frontier of the Punjab, on the other hand, and\r\neastwards, a Dravidian element can be traced. This is the case in the\r\nvalleys of the Ganges and the Jumna, where the Aryans only settled at a\r\nlater period. Anthropologists also state that there is a Dravidian\r\nelement in the population of western India, from Gujarat to Coorg.\r\n\r\nIt is thus probable that Dravidian languages have once been spoken in\r\nmany tracts which are now occupied by Aryan forms of speech. The\r\nexistence of a Dravidian dialect in Baluchistan seems to show that\r\nDravidian settlers have once lived in those parts. The tribe in\r\nquestion, the Br[=a]h[=u][=i]s, are, however, now Eranians and not\r\nDravidians by race, and it is not probable that there has ever been a\r\nnumerous Dravidian population in Baluchistan. The Br[=a]h[=u][=i]s are\r\nmost likely the descendants of settlers from the south.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication that the Dravidians have entered India from\r\noutside or superseded an older population. For all practical purposes\r\nthey can accordingly be considered as the aborigines of the Deccan,\r\nwhence they appear to have spread over part of northern India. Their\r\nlanguages form an isolated group, and it has not been possible to prove\r\na connexion with any other family of languages. Such attempts have been\r\nmade with reference to the Munda family, the Tibeto-Burman languages,\r\nand the dialects spoken by the aborigines of the Australian continent.\r\nThe arguments adduced have not, however, proved to be sufficient, and\r\nonly the Australian hypothesis can still lay claim to some probability.\r\nTill it has been more closely tested we must therefore consider the\r\nDravidian family as an isolated group of languages, with several\r\ncharacteristic features of its own.\r\n\r\n  The pronunciation is described as soft and mellifluous. Abruptness and\r\n  hard combinations of sounds are avoided. There is, for example, a\r\n  distinct tendency to avoid pronouncing a short consonant at the end of\r\n  a word, a very short vowel being often added after it. Thus the\r\n  pronoun of the third person singular, which is _avan_, \"he,\" in Tamil,\r\n  is pronounced _avanu_ in Kanarese; the Sanskrit word _v[=a]k_,\r\n  \"speech,\" is borrowed in the form _v[=a]ku_ in Tamil; the word\r\n  _gurram_, \"horse,\" is commonly pronounced _gurramu_ in Telugu, and so\r\n  on. Combinations of consonants are further avoided in many cases where\r\n  speakers of other languages do not experience any difficulty in\r\n  pronouncing them. This tendency is well illustrated by the changes\r\n  undergone by some borrowed words. Thus the Sanskrit word\r\n  _br[=a]hmana_, \"a Brahmin,\" becomes _bar[=a]mana_ in Kanarese and\r\n  _pir[=a]mana_ in Tamil; the Sanskrit _Dramida_, \"Dravidian,\" is\r\n  borrowed by Tamil under the form _Tir[=a]mida_. _Dramida_, which also\r\n  occurs as _Dravida_, is in its turn developed from an older _Damila_,\r\n  which is identical with the word _Tamir_, Tamil.\r\n\r\n  The forms _pir[=a]mana_ and _Tir[=a]mida_ in Tamil illustrate another\r\n  feature of Dravidian enunciation. There is a tendency in all of them,\r\n  and in Tamil and Malay[=a]lam it has become a law, against any word\r\n  being permitted to begin with a stopped voiced consonant (g, j, [d.],\r\n  d, b), the corresponding voiceless sounds (k, c, t, [t.], p,\r\n  respectively) being substituted. In the middle of a word or compound,\r\n  on the other hand, every consonant must be voiced. Thus the Sanskrit\r\n  word _danta_, \"tooth,\" has been borrowed by Tamil in the form\r\n  _tandam_, and the Telugu _anna_, \"elder brother,\" _tammulu_, \"younger\r\n  brother,\" become when compounded _annadammulu_, \"elder and younger\r\n  brothers.\"\r\n\r\n  There is no strongly marked accent on any one syllable, though there\r\n  is a slight stress upon the first one. In some dialects this\r\n  equilibrium between the different parts of a word is accompanied by a\r\n  tendency to approach to each other the sound of vowels in consecutive\r\n  syllables. This tendency, which has been called the \"law of harmonic\r\n  sequence,\" is most apparent in Telugu, where the short _u_ of certain\r\n  suffixes is replaced by _i_ when the preceding syllable contains one\r\n  of the vowels _i_ (short and long) and _ei_. Compare the dative suffix\r\n  _ku_, _ki_, in _gurramu-ku_, \"to a horse\"; but _tammuni-ki_, \"to a\r\n  younger brother.\" This tendency does not, however, play a prominent\r\n  rôle in the Dravidian languages.\r\n\r\n  Words are formed from roots and bases by means of suffixed formative\r\n  additions. The root itself generally remains unchanged throughout.\r\n  Thus from the Tamil base _per_, \"great,\" we can form adjectives such\r\n  as _per-iya_ and _per-um_, \"great\"; verbs such as _per-u-gu_, \"to\r\n  become increased\"; _per-u-kku_, \"to cause to increase,\" and so on.\r\n\r\n  Many bases can be used at will as nouns, as adjectives, and as verbs.\r\n  Thus the Tamil _kadu_ can mean \"sharpness,\" \"sharp,\" and \"to be\r\n  sharp.\" Other bases are of course more restricted in their respective\r\n  spheres.\r\n\r\n  The inflection of words is effected by agglutination, i.e. various\r\n  additions are suffixed to the base in order to form what we would call\r\n  cases and tenses. Such additions have probably once been separate\r\n  words. Most of them are, however, now only used as suffixes. Thus from\r\n  the Tamil base _k[=o]n_, \"king,\" we can form an accusative\r\n  _k[=o]n-ei_, a verb _k[=o]n-en_, \"I am king,\" and so on.\r\n\r\n  Dravidian nouns are divided into two classes, which Tamil grammarians\r\n  called high-caste and casteless respectively. The former includes\r\n  those nouns which denote beings endowed with reason, the latter all\r\n  others. Gender is only distinguished in the former class, while all\r\n  casteless nouns are neuter. The gender of animals (which are\r\n  irrational) must accordingly be distinguished by using different words\r\n  for the male and the female, or else by adding words meaning male,\r\n  female, respectively, to the name of the animal--processes which do\r\n  not, strictly speaking, fall under the head of grammar.\r\n\r\n  There are two numbers, the singular and the plural. The latter is\r\n  formed by adding suffixes. It, however, often remains unmarked in the\r\n  case of casteless nouns.\r\n\r\n  Cases are formed by adding postpositions and suffixes, usually to a\r\n  modified form of the noun which is commonly called the oblique base.\r\n  Thus we have the Tamil _maram_, \"tree\"; _maratt-[=a]l_, \"from a tree\";\r\n  _maratt-u-kku_, \"to a tree\"; _v[=i]du_, \"a house\"; _v[=i]t[t.]-[=a]l_,\r\n  \"from a house.\" The case terminations are the same in the singular and\r\n  in the plural. The genitive, which precedes the governing noun, is\r\n  often identical with the oblique base, or else it is formed by adding\r\n  suffixes.\r\n\r\n  The numeral system is decimal and higher numbers are counted in tens;\r\n  thus Tamil _pattu_, \"ten\"; _iru-badu_, \"two tens,\" \"twenty.\"\r\n\r\n  The personal pronoun of the first person in most dialects has a double\r\n  form in the plural, one including and the other excluding the person\r\n  addressed. Thus, Tamil _n[=a]m_, \"we,\" i.e. I and you; _n[=a]ngal_,\r\n  \"we,\" i.e. I and they.\r\n\r\n  There is no relative pronoun. Relative clauses are effected by using\r\n  relative participles. Thus in Telugu the sentence \"the book which you\r\n  gave to me\" must be translated _m[=i]ru n[=a]ku iccina pus-takamu_,\r\n  i.e. \"you me-to given book.\" There are several such participles in\r\n  use. Thus from the Telugu verb _kot[t.]a_, \"to strike,\" are formed\r\n  _kot[t.]-ut-unna_, \"that strikes,\" _kot[t.]-i-na_, \"that struck,\"\r\n  _kot[t.][=e]_, \"that would strike,\" \"that usually strikes.\" By adding\r\n  pronouns, or the terminations of pronouns, to such forms, nouns are\r\n  derived which denote the person who performs the action. Thus from\r\n  Telugu _kot[t.][=e]_ and _v[=a]du_, \"he,\" is formed\r\n  _kot[t.][=e]-v[=a]du_, \"one who usually strikes.\" Such forms are used\r\n  as ordinary verbs, and the usual verbal forms of Dravidian languages\r\n  can broadly be described as such nouns of agency. Thus, the Telugu,\r\n  _kot[t.]in[=a]du_, \"he struck,\" can be translated literally \"a striker\r\n  in the past.\"\r\n\r\n  Verbal tenses distinguish the person and number of the subject by\r\n  adding abbreviated forms of the personal pronouns. Thus in Kanarese we\r\n  have _m[=a]did-enu_, \"I did\"; _m[=a]did-i_, \"thou didst\";\r\n  _m[=a]did-evu_, \"we did\"; _m[=a]did-aru_, \"they did.\"\r\n\r\n  One of the most characteristic features of the Dravidian verb is the\r\n  existence of a separate negative conjugation. It usually has only one\r\n  tense and is formed by adding the personal terminations to a negative\r\n  base. Thus, Kanarese _m[=a]d-enu_, \"I did not\"; _m[=a]d-evu_, \"we did\r\n  not\"; _m[=a]d-aru_, \"they did not.\"\r\n\r\n  The vocabulary has adopted numerous Aryan loan-words. This was a\r\n  necessary consequence of the early connexion with the superior Aryan\r\n  civilization.\r\n\r\n  The oldest Dravidian literature is largely indebted to the Aryans\r\n  though it goes back to a very early date. Tamil, Malay[=a]lam,\r\n  Kanarese and Telugu are the principal literary languages. The language\r\n  of literature in all of them differs considerably from the colloquial.\r\n  The oldest known specimen of a Dravidian language occurs in a Greek\r\n  play which is preserved in a papyrus of the 2nd century A.D. The exact\r\n  period to which the indigenous literature can be traced back, on the\r\n  other hand, has not been fixed with certainty.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Bishop R.

In the list of Dravidian\r\n    languages the names are spelt fully, with all the necessary\r\n    diacritical marks. In the rest of the article dots under consonants\r\n    have been omitted in these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWBACK, in commerce, the paying back of a duty previously paid upon\r\nthe exportation of excisable articles or upon the re-exportation of\r\nforeign goods. The object of a drawback is to enable commodities which\r\nare subject to taxation to be exported and sold in a foreign country on\r\nthe same terms as goods from countries where they are untaxed. It\r\ndiffers from a bounty in that the latter enables commodities to be sold\r\nabroad at less than their cost price; it may occur, however, under\r\ncertain conditions that the giving of a drawback has an effect\r\nequivalent to that of a bounty, as in the case of the so-called sugar\r\nbounties in Germany (see SUGAR). The earlier tariffs contained elaborate\r\ntables of the drawbacks allowed on the exportation or re-exportation of\r\ncommodities, but so far as the United Kingdom is concerned the system of\r\n\"bonded warehouses\" practically abolished drawbacks, as commodities can\r\nbe warehoused (placed \"in bond\") until required for subsequent\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWING, in art. Although the verb \"to draw\" has various meanings, the\r\nsubstantive _drawing_ is confined by usage to its artistic sense,\r\ndelineation or design. The word \"draw,\" from a root common to the\r\nTeutonic languages (Goth, _dragan_, O.H.G. _drahan_, Mod. Ger. _tragen_,\r\nwhich all have the sense of \"carry,\" O. Norse _draga_, A.S. _drazan_,\r\n_drazen_, \"draw,\" cf. Lat. _trahere_), means to pull or \"drag\" (a word\r\nof the same origin) as distinct from the action of pushing. It is thus\r\nused of traction generally, whether by men, animals or machines. The\r\nsame idea is preserved in \"drawing\" as applied to the fine arts. We do\r\nnot usually say, or think, that a sculptor is drawing when he is using\r\nhis chisel, although he may be expressing or defining forms, nor that an\r\nengraver is drawing when he is pushing the burin with the palm of the\r\nhand, although the result may be the rendering of a design. But we do\r\nsay that an artist is drawing when he uses the lead pencil, and here we\r\nhave a motion bearing some resemblance to that of traction generally.\r\nThe action of the artist in drawing the pencil point with his fingers\r\nalong the paper is analogous, e.g., to that of a horse or man drawing a\r\npole over soft ground and leaving a mark behind. The same analogy may be\r\nobserved between two of the senses in which the French verb _tirer_ is\r\nfrequently employed. This word, the origin of which is quite uncertain,\r\nwas formerly used by good writers in the two senses of the verb to draw.\r\nThus Lafontaine says, \"Six forts chevaux _tiraient_ un coche\"; and\r\nCaillières wrote, \"Il n'y a pas longtemps que je me suis fait _tirer_\r\npar Rigaud,\" meaning that Rigaud had drawn or painted his portrait. At\r\nthe present day the verb _tirer_ has fallen into disuse amongst\r\ncultivated Frenchmen with regard to drawing and painting, but it is\r\nstill universally used for all kinds of design and even for photography\r\nby the common people. The cultivated use it still for printing, as for\r\nexample \"cette gravure sera tirée à cent exemplaires,\" in the sense of\r\npulling. A verb much more nearly related to the English verb _to draw_\r\nis the French _traire_ (Lat. _trahere_), which has _trait_ for its past\r\nparticiple. _Traire_ is now used exclusively for milking cows and other\r\nanimals, and though the analogy between this and artistic drawing is not\r\nobvious at first, nevertheless there is a certain analogy of motion,\r\nsince the hand passing down the teat draws the milk downwards. The word\r\n_trait_ is much more familiar in connexion with art as \"les traits du\r\nvisage,\" the natural markings of the face, and it is very often used in\r\na figurative sense, as we say \"traits of character.\" It is familiar in\r\nthe English _portrait_, derived from _protrahere_. The ancient Romans\r\nused words which expressed more clearly the conception that drawing was\r\ndone in line (_delineare_) or in shade (_adumbrare_), though there are\r\nreasons for believing that the words were often indiscriminately\r\napplied. Although the modern Italians have both _traire_ and _trarre_,\r\nthey use _delineare_ still in the sense of artistic drawing, and also\r\n_adombrare_. The Greek verb [Greek: graphein] appears in English in\r\n\"graphic\" and in many compounds, such as photograph, &c. It is worth\r\nobserving that the Greeks seem to have considered drawing and writing\r\n(q.v.) as essentially the same process, since they used the same word\r\nfor both. This points to the early identity of the two arts when drawing\r\nwas a kind of writing, and when such writing as men had learned to\r\npractise was essentially what we should call drawing, though of a rude\r\nand simple kind. Even in the present day picture writing is not\r\nunfrequently resorted to by travellers as a means of making themselves\r\nintelligible. There is also a kind of art which is writing in the modern\r\nsense and drawing at the same time, such as the work of the medieval\r\nilluminators in their manuscripts.     (X.)\r\n\r\n_The Art of Drawing._--Rather than attempt here a historical survey of\r\nthe various so-called \"styles\" of drawing, or write a personal\r\nappreciation of them, it seems of greater use to give a logical account\r\nof drawing as an art, applicable to all times and countries. Reference\r\nto the teaching of drawing will be occasionally given rather to\r\nillustrate the argument than with a view to its being of practical use.\r\n\r\nAt the outset a distinction must be made between drawing as a means of\r\nsymbolic or literary expression and drawing as the direct and only means\r\nof expressing the beauty of form. If Pharaoh wants to have it known that\r\na hundred ducks were consumed at one meal in his court, he employs a\r\ndraughtsman to register the fact on a frieze by picturing a row of cooks\r\noccupied in preparing the hundred ducks. The artist in this case does\r\nnot represent the scene as he must have known it in the kitchen, with\r\nall its variety of movement and composition (as an early Greek vase\r\npainter conceived the interior of a vase factory), but all he does and\r\nis required to do is to give the sufficient number of figures and ducks.\r\nThe more uniform the figures the greater will be the effect of number.\r\nDrawing has been employed here to tell a story, and it succeeds in so\r\nfar as it tells the spectator plainly what could be told, perhaps less\r\nconveniently, in words. It matters not whether the figures and objects\r\nbe feelingly rendered and harmoniously composed. So, to-day, a child, or\r\nany one who has a simple trick of symbolizing figures and objects in\r\nnature, can describe any event or moral by this process, provided the\r\nplot be not too elaborate to be expressed by a scene, or series of\r\nscenes, enacted by dumb symbolic figures. It is plain that the amusing\r\npictures in _Punch_ or _Fliegende Blätter_ would be none the more\r\namusing if they were done by the hand of Michelangelo, nor would the\r\nmystic designs of Blake be more full of meaning if drawn by Rembrandt,\r\nfor in neither case do these works depend upon any subtle rendering of\r\nthe forms of nature for their success, but upon the dramatic or\r\nintellectual imagination of the man who conceived them. When the witty\r\nor ethical man is at the same time a master draughtsman his work has two\r\nvalues, the \"literary\" content and the beauty of his drawing of natural\r\nobjects. But it must be borne in mind that these values are\r\nfundamentally distinct; so much so that the spectator who has no\r\nappreciation of the forms of nature enjoys the story told and remains\r\nblind to the qualities of draughtsmanship, whilst the lover of nature's\r\nforms may or may not trouble to unravel the literary plot but finds\r\nperfect satisfaction in the drawing. By far the greater part of\r\nillustration, and of artistic production generally, must be classed as\r\nsymbolic art. Magazine stories to-day are sometimes illustrated even by\r\nphotography, for the hand of the artist is not required. Symbolic art\r\ndescribes indirectly and in a necessarily limited scope what literature\r\ncan do directly and with unlimited powers. The only content of symbolic\r\ndrawing is its literary meaning; as drawing it may be quite worthless.\r\n\r\nPure drawing, however, whether it represent a dramatic event or a\r\nknee-joint, has a content that cannot be expressed by words, and is not\r\nnecessarily directed towards literary expression. Just as a fragment of\r\ngood sculpture pleases the connoisseur without any reference either to\r\nthe whole original or to its spiritual significance, fine drawing can\r\nappeal to the lover of nature independently of indirect considerations.\r\n\r\nWhat is the content of pure drawing? It is held by some that drawing or\r\nmonochrome can suggest colour, and many people, some consciously, others\r\nunconsciously, attempt to represent in drawings the colours of figures\r\nand landscape. It seems a strange aberration to argue that by different\r\nintensities of the one colour various other colours can be suggested: it\r\nwould not be more unreasonable to maintain that E flat and F could be\r\nsuggested by striking the note G with varying strength. Now the\r\ndraughtsman employs various intensities of his monochrome as light and\r\nshade by which to give roundness to his forms. But if on the same\r\ndrawing he uses the same means in his attempt to express colour, a\r\nconflict would be at once set up between that which makes for form and\r\nthat which would make for colour, and the result would generally be a\r\nconfusion. Again, let one attempt to give red hair to a monochrome\r\ndrawing of a man, and if the red be plain and unmistakable to all who\r\nare not the artist's accomplices, then the artist has succeeded;\r\notherwise it is bootless to treat of colour and colour values (which of\r\ncourse must depend upon the existence of colour) in monochrome. Apart\r\nfrom theory, if we examine the drawings, etchings and monochromes of\r\ngreat artists, where do we find them attempting to give colour or colour\r\nvalues? The hundreds of costume studies by Rembrandt might have been\r\ndone from white plaster models, and there are only a few exceptions\r\nwhere a man has, for instance, a black hat or cloak. But in these few\r\ninstances the \"colour\" tone is applied with such discretion that the\r\ntrue representation of the form is scarcely, perhaps only theoretically,\r\nimpaired: they certainly have gained nothing in colour value because no\r\nspecific colour is manifest in them. In Rembrandt's, Claude's or\r\nTurner's drawings of landscapes the formation of the country, the\r\narchitecture, &c., is expressed by line, light and shade, and enhanced\r\nby shadows cast from clouds and trees. If, in the drawings of masters,\r\nwe should find objects darker or lighter than their position in the\r\nlight would warrant, they have value (perhaps not quite a legitimate\r\none) for balancing the composition as a flat pattern. They were never\r\nintended to suggest colour, nor do they. Yet, in spite of the failure to\r\nsucceed, and contrary to logical argument and the practice of great\r\ndraughtsmen, the student of most of the schools of Europe and America\r\nstill persists in doing the hair dark, and, by attempting to give colour\r\nvalues to the clothes, breaks up the consistency of the whole. For the\r\nsame reason that the sculptor uses uniformly coloured material in order\r\nthat the natural light and shade may have full opportunity of making his\r\nforms manifest to the spectator, the draughtsman confines himself to\r\ngiving light and shade only. If a monochrome has \"colour tones,\" the\r\neffect is similar to that produced by a draped statue made out of\r\nvariously coloured marbles--an inartistic jumble.\r\n\r\nAs the immediate purpose and content of drawing there remains the\r\nrepresentation of form only. Drawing is, therefore, essentially the same\r\nactivity as sculpture, and has no additional scope. \"Pupils,\" says\r\nDonatello, \"I give you the whole art of sculpture when I tell you to\r\ndraw\" (cited by Holroyd, _Michel Angelo_, p. 2 95), and the only\r\npractical teaching of drawing might be summed up by the inversion of the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nNow if everything in nature--men, mountains or clouds--were as flat\r\ntargets, i.e. two-dimensional, drawing could be legitimately reduced to\r\na mechanical process,--to trace their contours upon a glass screen or\r\neven photograph them would be all that would be required. Indeed,\r\nprovided the size of the drawing, the local colour and the texture be\r\nthe same as those of the original, a complete illusion would be the\r\nresult, in fact the proper end of one's labours. But the presence of the\r\nthird dimension in all objects causes light and shade, which in their\r\nturn bring about radical changes of the local colour, even in uniformly\r\ncoloured objects. Now since drawing cannot suggest colour, local or\r\natmospherical, any attempt to effect an illusion by a monochrome is at\r\nonce defeated. If the end of drawing were to approach imitation or\r\nillusion as nearly as possible, how is it that a mere \"sketch\" by a\r\nmaster draughtsman can be for itself as valuable as his highly finished\r\ndrawing? And surely a masterly outline drawing of a figure or landscape\r\ndoes not pretend to be an illusion. If then the draughtsman does not,\r\nand cannot hope to imitate nature, he is compelled to state only his\r\nideas of it, ideas of three-dimensional form. For this reason only\r\ndrawing must be treated as an art, and not as a mechanical act of\r\ngetting an illusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From a Greek vase in the British Museum (E. 46).\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From _Bulletino arch. Napol_. (1843, tom. 1, tav. 7).\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From a drawing by Michelangelo (1854, 5, 13, i.), Print\r\nRoom, British Museum).\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to trace in the history of an indigenous art the\r\ndevelopment of drawing that shall ultimately express ideas of\r\nthree-dimensional form. Prof. Emanuel Loewy, in his _Rendering of Nature\r\nin Early Greek Art_, demonstrates how the early Greek sculpture (and\r\nthat of all primitive peoples, children and ungifted artists) shows an\r\naversion from depth. Their reliefs are of the flattest description,\r\nalmost raised contours, and their figures in the round have at first\r\nonly one aspect, or flat façade, so to speak, then three and four\r\naspects, and finally at the date of Lysippus the figures are fully\r\nrounded out, and the members project at liberty in all directions. Then\r\nfor the first time Greek sculpture showed a complete conception of the\r\nbody's corporeity (_Körperlichkeit_). The primitive artist, however well\r\nhe may be _intellectually_ aware of the three dimensions of an object,\r\ndoes not fully apprehend its true aspect as offered to the eye from one\r\npoint of view. Following this conclusion, it is easy to see also in the\r\ndrawing of the early Greeks, children and so on, the same lack of idea\r\nof the third dimension. The figures on the vases of the \"finest period\"\r\n(about 475 B.C.), despite occasional foreshortenings, have, when\r\nconsidered as representations of solid forms, a papery appearance. They\r\nhave not half the draughtsmanship shown by the latter period of the vase\r\nindustry, where the figures, though careless, stereotyped and\r\nill-composed, come forwards (to use Prof. Loewy's description of later\r\nsculpture), go backwards, twist and turn in space in a manner which\r\ncannot be excelled. The reproductions in figs. 1, 2, 3 will illustrate\r\nthe development. The primitive draughtsman is at first bound by the\r\nsilhouette. Later, he desires to fill out the interior, but this cannot\r\nbe done without in great part modifying his contour lines, because they\r\nare generally merely indications of the disappearing and reappearing\r\ninner modelling, i.e. of the figure's third dimension. Finally, the\r\ndraughtsman in full possession of a feeling for the corporeity of the\r\nobject will determine his contour entirely from within, a procedure\r\nwhich is the exact opposite to that of his first beginnings. He\r\nconceives the length, breadth and depth of an object and all its parts\r\nas solid wholes. To him a body in violent foreshortening is as easy as a\r\nsimple profile, and, though it may not be as attractive, it is perhaps\r\nmore interesting because its contours are more bound up with, and\r\ndependent upon, the inner modelling; in other words, it has more depth.\r\nThe draughtsman's idea of a form in nature is not a \"flat idea,\" but one\r\ncontaining three dimensions. This idea he seeks to express either by\r\nline alone or by light and shade. If an artist has not a\r\nthree-dimensional \"grasp\" of forms, and, like a child, confines himself\r\nto the primitive tracing of the silhouette, his compositions may be of\r\nexcellent flat pattern, and equal to any of the designs of ancient\r\ncarpets or early Greek vases; but in the light of the above argument,\r\nand when compared with the productions of mature draughtsmen of all ages\r\nand countries, they cannot be said to be complete drawings, any more\r\nthan the early unifacial statues of the Greeks can be called true\r\nplastic, simply because in neither case has the artist yet reached the\r\nhighest possible development of corporeous conception, by which truly to\r\ninterpret the solid objects of nature as we know them, and as master\r\ndraughtsmen see them.\r\n\r\nAn attempt should be made to explain the psycho-physiological process\r\nthat must take place in the mind of the real draughtsman. When we look\r\nat an object in nature we know its length and breadth by the flat image\r\non the retina; we see also the light and shade, which at once gives us a\r\ncorrect idea of the object's depth or relief. But we do not, nor could\r\nwe, have this idea from the flat image on the retina alone, i.e. from\r\nthe mere perception of the light and shade: our knowledge of its depth\r\nis the result of experience, i.e. of our having from infancy remarked a\r\ncertain dispensation of light and shade on, and peculiar to, every form\r\nwe have touched or traversed, and so, by association and inference,\r\nbeing early enabled to have ideas of the depth of things by their\r\nvarious arrangements of lights and darks without having to touch or\r\ntraverse them. Nevertheless the act (generally, but by no means always,\r\nan unconscious one) of visually touching a form must necessarily take\r\nplace before we can apprehend the third dimension of a form. It is,\r\nthen, by the combination of the ideas derived from pure vision and the\r\nideas derived from touch that we know the length, breadth and depth of a\r\nsolid form. We have shown that the art of drawing is not an imitation,\r\nbut an expression of the artist's ideas of form; therefore all drawing\r\nof forms that merely reproduces the image on the retina, and leaves\r\nunconsulted the ideas of touch, is incomplete and primitive, because it\r\ndoes not express a conception of form which is the result of an\r\nassociation of the two senses; in other words, it does not contain an\r\nidea of the object's relief or solidity. And all teaching of drawing\r\nthat does not impress upon the student the necessity of combining the\r\nsense of vision with that of touch is erroneous, for it is thereby\r\nlimiting him to a mechanical task, viz. the tracing of the flat image on\r\nthe retina, which could be equally well done by mechanical means, or by\r\nphotography alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn most of the schools of Europe and America it is true that great\r\nstress is laid upon the importance of giving life-like relief to\r\ndrawings, but the method by which the students are allowed to get the\r\nrelief is by employing the sense of vision only. Tracing the silhouette\r\nof the figure as minutely as possible, they then fill it out with\r\ninner-modelling, which also is done by vision alone, for the lights and\r\ndarks of the original are copied down as so many flat patterns fitted\r\ntogether and gradated like a child's puzzle, and are not used merely as\r\nindication by which to \"feel\" the depth of the object. Such a procedure\r\nis as if in drawing a brick of which three sides were visible, one were\r\nfirst to draw the entire contour (fig. 4, a), the subtle perspective of\r\nwhich he might get correct with some mechanical apparatus or by infinite\r\nmechanical pains, and then fill up the interior with its \"shading\" (fig.\r\n4, b). The method would be plainly laborious, unintelligent and\r\nunedifying, and in drawing the most complicated foreshortened forms of\r\nthe human body it would seem still more illogical. That this principle\r\nof instruction does not help the student to grasp the three-dimensional\r\ncharacter properly can be proved by the twenty-minute studies of the\r\naverage student who in his fourth year has won a gold medal for an\r\nastounding piece of life-like stippling. They are still unintelligent\r\ncontour tracings, as if of cardboard figures, with a few irrelevant\r\npatches of dark here and there within the silhouette.\r\n\r\nBut high modelling that would make for illusion of reality is not the\r\nfirst aim of draughtsmanship, nor have the best draughtsmen employed it\r\nsave by exception. Michelangelo, Ingres, Holbein and Rembrandt have\r\nshown us that it is possible to give sufficient relief with a mere\r\noutline drawing. Again, the desire for salience often blunts the\r\nstudent's sense of the real character of the forms he is rounding out.\r\nSo his elaborately modelled portrait may look very \"life-like,\" but when\r\ncompared with the original it will generally be seen that the whole and\r\neach of the individual forms of the drawing lack the peculiar character\r\nof those of the original. It is by carefully watching for the character\r\nof each fresh variety in figure and feature that great draughtsmen have\r\nexcelled, and not by \"life-like\" relief, or even a sophisticated\r\nexposition of anatomical details at the expense of character. Can it be\r\nseriously maintained that a masterly sudden grasp of true formal\r\ncharacter can be developed in a student by a system in which he\r\npatiently spends many days and weeks in stippling into plastic\r\nappearance one drawing which has originally been \"laid in\" by a\r\nmechanical process?\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that to attempt to make an illusion of nature is\r\nneither within the power of monochrome nor has been the chief aim of\r\ndraughtsmen, but that the art of drawing consists in giving a plain\r\nstatement of one's ideas, be they slight or studied, of the solid forms\r\nof nature. But the question may still be asked: Why is it that a\r\nrigorously accurate and finished drawing by a student or artist with\r\n_no_ such ideas or conception is not good drawing, containing as it must\r\ndo all that can be seen in the original, missing only its complete\r\nillusion? Why, in a word, is not a photograph a work of art?\r\n\r\nThe common explanation of the above important question is that the\r\nartist \"selects and eliminates from the forms of nature.\" But surely\r\nthis is the principle of the caricaturist and virtuoso? A beautiful\r\ndrawing, however slight, is but the precipitate of the whole in the\r\nartist's mind. And a highly finished drawing by a master does not show\r\neven any apparent selection or elimination. The adoption of the\r\nprinciple of selection to differentiate art from mechanical reproduction\r\nis fundamentally vicious, and could be shown to be wholly inapplicable\r\nto the so-called formative arts. Nor could the theory of \"selection\" be\r\nused as a principle of teaching, for if to the first question the pupil\r\nwould make, \"What am I to select?\" it were answered, \"Only the important\r\nthings,\" then the next question, \"What are the important things?\" could\r\nbe answered only by saying, \"That alone the real artist knows, but\r\ncannot teach.\" Certainly there are important things that can be taught\r\nthe student in the initial stage of \"laying-in\" a figure, but _when_ to\r\nbegin selecting or eliminating no teacher could tell him, simply because\r\nhe must be aware that a true draughtsman can afford to eliminate nothing\r\nwhen the truth of the whole is at stake. The artist's conception and its\r\nexpression may be slight or elaborate, but in neither case can selection\r\nor elimination take place, for a true conception must be founded upon\r\nthe character of the whole, which is determined by the entire complex of\r\nall the parts.\r\n\r\nTo explain the essential difference between art and mechanical drawing\r\nor mechanical reproduction, a more applicable theory must be found.\r\nCompare the art of telling a story. If, to describe an incident in the\r\nstreet you had the entire affair reenacted on the same spot, you would\r\nhave but made a mechanical reproduction of it, leaving the spectator to\r\nsimplify the affair, and construct his _own_ conception of it. You have\r\nnot given _your_ ideas of the event, and so you have not made a work of\r\nart. So, if a man draws an object detail for detail by any mechanical\r\nprocess, or traces over its photograph, he has but reduplicated the\r\nreal aspect of the object, and has failed to give the spectator a simple\r\nand intelligible idea of it. Starting out with the generous notion of\r\ngiving all, that there may be \"something for everyone,\" he has given\r\nnothing. He did not originally form an intelligible and simplified idea\r\nof the figure, so how can his drawing be expected to give one to others?\r\n\r\nBut how can forms be made _more_ simple and intelligible than by\r\nreproducing their aspect with absolute accuracy? Our combined sense of\r\nvision and touch comprehends very easily certain elementary solid forms,\r\nthe sphere, the cube, the pyramid and the cylinder. No forms but these,\r\nand their modifications, can be apprehended by the mind in one and the\r\nsame act of vision. Every complex form, even so simple as that of a\r\nkidney, for instance, must be first broken up into its component parts\r\nbefore it can be fully apprehended or remembered. Analogously with the\r\nabove, Prof. Wundt has shown how the mind can apprehend _as separate\r\nunits_ any number, of marbles for instance, up to five, after which\r\nevery number must be split up into lots of twos, threes, fours and\r\nfives, or twenties, thirties and so on, before it can realize the full\r\ncontent of that number in one and the same mental picture. So the only\r\nway to receive an intelligible idea of a complex form, such as a human\r\nfigure, is first to discover in the figure itself, and then in all its\r\nparts, only modifications of the above elementary solid forms, and the\r\ndrawing of a conception thus informed must needs be a very clear and\r\nintelligible one. The more the artist is capable and practised, the more\r\nclearly will he conceive and distinguish in nature each subtle\r\nmodification of these elementary forms, their direction, their relation\r\nto, and their dependence upon one another. The only difference between a\r\ngood draughtsman and a bad one is the degree of subtlety of his\r\napprehension. Unless the draughtsman has seen some such clear forms in\r\nhis original, his labour to produce a work of art will be grievous and\r\nfruitless. All good drawing is stamped with this kind of structural\r\ninsight. The more the artist adheres to nature, and the more finished\r\nhis drawing, the more will the lines and forms that he makes be, so to\r\nspeak, _in excess_ of those of nature, or dull imitation or photography.\r\nIt is not to be supposed that able draughtsmen work, or need ever have\r\nworked, consciously in this manner. It is, indeed, the virtue peculiar\r\nto the artist, as interpreter of form, that he instinctively comprehends\r\nthe real elemental character of complex forms, whilst the majority of\r\npeople (on the showing of their own drawings) entertain but confused or\r\n_no_ ideas of them. It is because a good drawing reduces the chaos of\r\nideas supplied by the raw material of nature, to one intelligible manner\r\nof seeing it, that all lovers of nature welcome it with joy. It is this\r\nprocess of discovery and interpretation that marks the essential\r\ndifference between art and mechanical drawing or reproduction. Art gives\r\nintelligible ideas of the forms of nature, mechanism attempts to\r\nreduplicate their aspects.\r\n\r\nThere are some who hold that drawing is not exclusively a matter of\r\ninterpreting form, but that great artists have their own \"personalities\"\r\nwhich they infuse into their work. They will ask, How is it otherwise to\r\nbe explained that two equally good draughtsmen will invariably make\r\ndifferent drawings of the same figure? Is it not for the same reason\r\nthat one man will divide up a row of eight marbles into groups of four,\r\nand another into five and three? The subjectivity of experience governs\r\nthe different conceptions that good draughtsmen will form of the same\r\nobject. Accordingly as a draughtsman feels form so will he draw it, and\r\nit is only because our sense apparatuses are more or less similarly\r\nconstituted that we can understand and appreciate one another's\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\nBut if the master draughtsman gives the true character of his model's\r\nform, why is it that his drawings are not pleasing to all alike? Whence\r\nthe doubts and criticism that have been called forth by all original\r\nartists? If we first examine the attitude of the average man, artist or\r\nlayman, towards nature, we can better explain his attitude towards works\r\nof art. The average man or artist has not a highly developed\r\nappreciation of form _per se_, whether it be the form of natural or\r\nmanufactured objects. And it would seem that he is still less a\r\ndisinterested spectator of the forms and features of his fellow beings\r\nand animals, their movements, their colour, their value in a room or\r\nlandscape. He has sentimental, moral or intellectual preferences. In\r\nother words, he likes or dislikes only those faces or figures which\r\nhundreds of personal associations have taught him to like or dislike.\r\nThe riding man's admiration for the look of a particular horse is based\r\nupon the fact that it looks like \"a horse to go,\" and hence it is what\r\nhe calls beautiful, while the artist, in the capacity of artist and not\r\nof sportsman, is not particular in his choice of horse-flesh, but finds\r\neach animal equally interesting for itself alone. Consequently in art\r\nany face, figure or object that does not come into the category of what\r\nthe average man cares for is condemned by him even as it would be in\r\nreal life, since he is no lover of form for form's sake, but provided\r\nthe subject or moral be pleasing the quality of the draughtsmanship is\r\nof small account. The picture of a dwarf, or of an anatomy lesson, or of\r\na group of ordinary bourgeois folk would not really please him, even\r\nthough he were told that the work was by Velazquez, Rembrandt or Manet.\r\nWe have only to listen to the common criticism of works of art to know\r\nthat it is founded upon personal predilection only. We do not hear such\r\npersonal criticism upon drawings of landscape, not because artists do\r\nthem better, but because natural landscape has no interest for any one\r\nother than for its form, or, at least, people do not hold such definite\r\npersonal likes or dislikes with regard to its various manifestations.\r\nBut the artist, though his own personal predilections may, and generally\r\ndo, lead him to work within that agreeable _milieu_, has, in the\r\ncapacity of artist, no subjective prejudices; indeed, if he had them, he\r\ncould not represent them by line, light and shade. He seeks always new\r\nvarieties of form; hence his subjects, and his manner of posing them,\r\nare often unpleasing to the man who is busy with other affairs, and has\r\nno great experience of nature's forms. Let a good draughtsman make a\r\nsuccessful likeness of the mother of some average man, and the latter\r\nwill be delighted, but it by no means follows that he will delight in a\r\ndrawing of the wife of the artist, though done by the same hand and with\r\nequal skill.\r\n\r\nIf drawing is the art of giving one's ideas of the forms of nature, then\r\nall criticism of drawing must be based upon the question, \"How far does\r\nsuch and such a work show an intimate knowledge of or intelligent\r\nvisualization of the forms we know in nature?\" and no other principle of\r\njudgment can be applicable to all drawing alike. Hence only those who\r\nhave by natural endowment a clear sense of the forms of things, and who\r\nhave made more than ordinary study of them, are in a position to apply\r\nto drawings the above criterion with any approach to infallibility. It\r\nis a fact that there are, and always have been, a certain number of\r\npeople who agree perfectly in their appreciation of the works of certain\r\ndraughtsmen of different times and countries, and who can state reasons\r\nfor their appreciation in definite and almost identical terms, for it is\r\nbased upon knowledge and experience. To such people all fine\r\ndraughtsmanship owes its public fame, and its immortality lies in their\r\nsafe keeping.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that each has a right to his own opinion about form and\r\nits representation, on the supposed ground that we all see form in\r\ndifferent ways. But there is a fallacy in this argument. If we take the\r\naverage man's drawing of any form more complex than a loaf of bread as a\r\nfair and only testimony of his power of visualization of forms, we must\r\nconclude that most of us see not differently, but _wrongly_, or rather\r\nconfusedly and disconnectedly, and that some can visualize form scarcely\r\nat all. If this be true, the average person's sight and ability to judge\r\ndrawing is seriously diminished. If, then, drawing can be judged and\r\nappreciated only by knowledge and experience of the forms of nature, no\r\ncritical formula could be made out so as to enable a child or savage or\r\nordinary civilized adult to estimate or enjoy it. If it be argued that\r\ndrawings are to be judged from some abstract or symbolic point of view,\r\nindependently of its subtle representation of form, then incompetent\r\ndrawing might be as beautiful as the competent, which would be absurd.\r\nHowever, if the competent characterization of form were admitted as at\r\nleast the first condition of beautiful drawing, it would follow that\r\nany abstract value it might have must be wholly dependent upon the\r\nmanner in which form is represented, and so it would be superfluous to\r\njudge it by any standard other than the direct, definite and concrete\r\none of form. Abstract beauty, since no one has yet defined it agreeably\r\nto all, is, apparently, with those who affect a feeling for it, a matter\r\nof individual taste, and therefore cannot be questioned. But the clear\r\nvisualization of the forms of nature is based upon a special endowment\r\nand knowledge, and can be criticized by demonstration. People may differ\r\nin their tastes, but they may not, nor do they, differ upon questions of\r\nreal knowledge. Drawing, as the activity of giving one's ideas of form,\r\nmust therefore be judged not by taste but by knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn view of the purpose and content of drawing as here demonstrated,\r\nthere is no other principle of judgment that is relevant. Yet we often\r\nhear drawing judged by criteria which are founded upon no such concrete\r\nbase but upon certain vague abstractions; or, again, upon a literary or\r\nmoral base which could be applicable only to symbolic art.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this or that draughtsman excels in \"beauty of line.\" Now\r\nin spite of the labours of many painters and theorists, it cannot\r\nreasonably be held that one purely abstract line or curve is more\r\nbeautiful than another, for the simple reason that people have no common\r\nground upon which to establish the nature of abstract beauty. It may be,\r\nhowever, that even as certain simple forms are more easily apprehended\r\nthan complex ones, there is the same distinction with regard to lines.\r\nIf then an artist of clean vision sees in an object of reality such\r\nclear characteristic lines, he draws them not for their abstract beauty,\r\nbut merely because by them alone can he express his idea of the form\r\nbefore him. The early Greek vase painters, and all great artists of\r\nprimitive periods, being attracted only by the silhouette, became very\r\nsubtle to observe nature's outlines in their most intelligible\r\ncharacter, and to this capacity is due their \"beauty of line,\" and not\r\nto any preconceived notion of an abstract line of perfect beauty, and\r\nnowhere will \"beauty of line\" be found on Greek vases, or elsewhere,\r\nthat is not informed by, and does not express, a fine conception of\r\nnature's contours. So too in later three-dimensional drawing there is no\r\nbeauty of line which does not intelligibly express not only the\r\ndirections and angles of the main contour, but the inner modelling, i.e.\r\nthe relief of the figure. It is only a superficial judgment that would\r\nprefer one drawing to another, even if both may be equally good, because\r\nthe line of one is neat and the other \"tormented.\" Contour being _in\r\nnature_ an ideal line between one form and another, it is illogical to\r\ntreat it or criticize it in a _drawing_ as an actual and specific thing,\r\napart from the forms that make it and are made by it. If an artist drew\r\na dragon with deliberate disregard for animal construction, his drawing\r\nwould be silly, and only by a profound knowledge of the forms of nature\r\ncould it be made to have beautiful lines. Truth to nature is always\r\noriginality, and it is the only originality worth the name.\r\n\r\nAgain, some people judge one drawing as better than another in that it\r\nshows more \"individuality\" or \"temperament.\" Now a man's individuality\r\nis, presumably, a vague feeling in our minds produced by the net result\r\nof the ways in which he sees, hears, loves, thinks and so on, so that we\r\ncould not tell a man's individuality from any single one of his\r\nmanifestations. With his entire work as an artist before us, i.e. his\r\nmanner of seeing, we could do no more than infer, with the help of\r\noutside data, from the subjects he chooses, and the neatness or boldness\r\nof his line, something about his general character, and that with small\r\ndegree of certainty. To regard a man's works of art, or indeed any of\r\nhis manifestations, from this point of view, is, after all, nothing but\r\na kind of inquisitive cheiromancy. Those who pretend to like the\r\ndrawings of Watteau or Michelangelo \"because they show more\r\nindividuality\" than the incompetent work of a beginner or poor artist\r\ncannot be skilled in their own business, because the lady who tells your\r\ncharacter by your handwriting finds as much individuality in bad writing\r\nas in good,--sometimes even more. It may be entertaining to some to\r\nguess at the artist's character from his works by this process of\r\ninference and comparison, but it is unreasonable to imagine that\r\n\"individuality,\" as such, can be made a serious criterion of aesthetic\r\njudgment. The only individuality a draughtsman can show directly by his\r\ndrawing is his individual way of conceiving the forms of nature, and\r\neven this is immaterial provided the conception and drawing be good.\r\n\r\nA word or two are necessary upon \"style,\" which unfortunate word has\r\nmade much mystery in criticism. The great draughtsmen of every time and\r\ncountry are known by their own words, as well as their works, to have\r\nbeen infinitely respectful to the form of every detail in nature. Their\r\ndrawings always recall to our minds reality as we ourselves have seen it\r\n(provided we have studied from nature and not from pictures). The\r\ndrawing of a hand, for instance, by Hokusai, Ingres or Dürer, revives in\r\nus our own impressions of the forms and aspects of real hands. In short\r\nthere is manifest in all good drawings, whatever their difference of\r\nmedium or superficial appearance, an entire dependence upon the forms of\r\nnature. Hence we cannot imagine that they were conceived and executed\r\nwith the conscious effort to obtain some abstract style independent of\r\nthe material treated. The style they plainly have can spring from this\r\ncommon quality, their truthful and well understood representation of\r\nforms. Style, then, is the expression of a clear understanding of the\r\nmaterial from which the artist works. Unless a drawing shows this\r\nunderstanding it would be as impossible as it would be gratuitous to\r\nargue that it could have style. But it would seem that some people mean\r\nby style nothing more than the mere superficial appearance of the work.\r\nThey would have a draughtsman draw \"in the style of Holbein,\" but not\r\n\"in the style\" of Rembrandt. This kind of preference, as remarked above,\r\nis superficial, for it overlooks the main issue and purpose of drawing,\r\nviz. the representation, by any means whatever, of the artist's ideas of\r\nform. It is as though one should prefer a letter from Holbein to one\r\nfrom Rembrandt, though both were equally expressive, simply because\r\nHolbein's handwriting was prettier than Rembrandt's. Each draughtsman\r\nmanifests a kind of handwriting peculiar to himself even in his most\r\nfaithful rendering of form; and by this we can immediately recognize the\r\nartist; many, for instance Hogarth and some Japanese, seem to have let\r\ntheir quirks, full stops and so on, get the upper hand at the expense of\r\nserious, sensitive draughtsmanship.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to suppose that all abstract principles of aesthetic\r\njudgment, such as beauty of line, personality, style, nobility of\r\nthought, romanticism, are merely pretexts set up by people who would\r\nstill affect to admire the drawings of recognized masters when they have\r\nneither the knowledge of, nor the care for, the forms of nature by\r\nvirtue of which alone these drawings are what they are, and by which\r\nalone they can be immediately appreciated.     (J. R. FO.)\r\n\r\n_Drawing-Office Work._--In modern engineering, few pieces of mechanism\r\nare ever produced in the shops until their design has been settled in\r\nthe \"drawing office,\" and embodied in suitable drawings showing general\r\nand detailed views. This is a broad statement to which there are\r\nexceptions, to be noted presently.\r\n\r\nDrawing-office work is divisible into four principal groups. First,\r\nthere is the actual designing, by far the most difficult work, which is\r\nconfined to relatively few well-paid men. The qualifications necessary\r\nfor it are a good scientific, mathematical and engineering training, and\r\na specialized experience gathered in the particular class of mechanism\r\nto which the designing relates. Second, there is the work of the rank\r\nand file who take instructions from the chiefs, and elaborate the\r\nsmaller details and complete the drawings. Third, there are the tracers,\r\neither youths or girls, who copy drawings on tracing paper without\r\nnecessarily understanding them. Fourth, there is a printing department\r\nin which phototypes are produced on sensitized paper from tracings.\r\n\r\nThe character of the drawings used includes the general drawings, or\r\nthose which show a mechanism complete; and the detailed drawings, which\r\nillustrate portions isolated from their connexions and relationships.\r\nThe first are retained in the office for reference, and copies are only\r\nsent out to the men who have to assemble or erect and complete\r\nmechanisms. The second are distributed to the several shops and\r\ndepartments where sectional portions are being prepared, as pattern\r\nshop, smithy, turnery, machine shop, &c. General drawings are, as a\r\nrule, drawn to a small scale, ranging say from 1/8 in. to 1 in. to the\r\nfoot; but details are either to actual size, or to a large scale, as\r\nfrom 1½ in. to the foot or 3 in. or 6 in. to the foot.\r\n\r\nA large number of minutiae are omitted from general drawings, but in the\r\ndetailed ones that are sent into the shops nothing is apparently too\r\ntrivial for insertion. In this respect, however, there is much\r\ndifference observable in the practice of different firms, and in the\r\nbest practice of the present compared with that of former years. In the\r\ndetailed drawings issued by many firms now, every tiny element and\r\nsection is not only drawn to actual size, but also fully dimensioned,\r\nand the material to be used is specified in every case. This practice\r\nlargely adds to the work of the drawing-office staff, but it pays.\r\n\r\nThe present tendency therefore is to throw more responsibility than of\r\nold on the drawing-office staff, in harmony with the tendency towards\r\ngreater centralization of authority. Much of detail that was formerly\r\nleft to the decision of foremen and skilled hands is now determined by\r\nthe drawing-office staff. Heterogeneity in details is thus avoided, and\r\nthe drawings reflect accurately and fully the past as well as the\r\npresent practice of the firm. To so great an extent is this the case\r\nthat the preparation of the tools, appliances, templets, jigs and\r\nfixtures used in the shops is often now not permitted to be undertaken\r\nuntil proper drawings have been prepared for them, though formerly the\r\nforeman's own hand sketches generally sufficed. The practice of turret\r\nwork has been contributory to this result. In many establishments now\r\nthe designing of shop tools and fixtures is done in a department of the\r\noffice specially set apart for that kind of work.\r\n\r\nThe growing specialization of the engineer's work is reflected in the\r\ndrawing office. Specialists are sought after, and receive the highest\r\nrates of pay. A man is required to be an expert in some one branch, as\r\nelectric cranes or hydraulic machines, steel works plant, lathes, or\r\nheavy or light machine tools. The days are past in which all-round men\r\nwere in request. In those firms which manufacture a large range of\r\nmachinery, the drawing-office staff is separated into departments, each\r\nunder its own chief, and there is seldom any transference of men from\r\none to another.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the majority of instances designs and drawings are completed\r\nbefore the manufacture is undertaken, exceptions to this rule occur in\r\nconnexion with the work of standardizing machines and motors, for\r\nrepetitive and interchangeable manufacture on a large scale. Here it is\r\nso essential to secure the most minute economies in manufacture that the\r\nfirst articles made are of a more or less experimental character. Only\r\nafter no further improvement seems for the time being possible are the\r\ndrawings made or completed for standard use and reference. In some\r\nmodern shops even standardized drawings are scarcely used, but their\r\nplace is taken by the templets, jigs and fixtures which are employed by\r\nthe workmen as their sole guides in machining and assembling parts. By\r\nthe employment of these aids locations and dimensions are embodied and\r\nfixed absolutely for any number of similar parts; reference to drawings\r\nthus becomes unnecessary, and they therefore fall into disuse.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical work of the drawing office is confined strictly to\r\northographic projections and sections of objects. Perspective views are\r\nof no value, though occasionally an object is sketched roughly in\r\nperspective as an aid to the rapid grasp of an idea. Drawings involve\r\nplans, elevations, and sectional views, in vertical and angular\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many conventionalities adopted which have no\r\ncorrespondences in fact, with the object of saving the draughtsman's\r\ntime; or else, as in the case of superposition of plans and sections, to\r\nshow in one view what would otherwise require two drawings. Among the\r\nconvenient conventionalities are the indications of toothed wheels by\r\ntheir pitch lines only, of screws by parallel lines and by diagonal\r\nshade lines; and of rivets, bolts and studs by their centres only. The\r\nadoption of this practice never leads to error.\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary preparation of drawings in pencil no distinction is\r\nmade between full or unbroken lines, and dotted or centre lines, and the\r\nactual outlines of the objects. These differences are made when the\r\ninking-in is being done. Indian or Chinese ink is used, because it does\r\nnot run when colours are applied. There are conventional colours used to\r\nindicate different materials. But colouring is not adopted so much as\r\nformerly, because of the practice of making sun prints instead of the\r\nmore expensive tracings for the multiplication of drawings. When\r\ntracings are coloured the colour is applied on the back instead of on\r\nthe side where the ink lines are drawn.\r\n\r\nThe economical importance of the printing department of the drawing\r\noffice cannot be overestimated. Before its introduction drawings could\r\nonly be reproduced by laborious tracing on paper or cloth, the first\r\nbeing flimsy, the second especially liable to absorb grease from the\r\nhands of the workmen. By the sun copying processes (see SUN COPYING) any\r\nnumber of prints can be taken from a single tracing. But even the fickle\r\nsun is being displaced by electricity, so that prints can be made by\r\nnight as well as day, on cloudy days as well as on bright ones. Twenty\r\nminutes of bright sunshine is required for a print, but the electric\r\nlight produces the same result within five minutes. Prints are blue,\r\nwhite or brown. The advantage of white is that they can be coloured. But\r\nthe majority are blue (white lines on blue ground). All can be had on\r\nstout, thin or medium paper.\r\n\r\nAn innovation in drawing-office equipment is that of vertical boards,\r\ndisplacing horizontal or sloping ones. They have the advantage that the\r\ndraughtsman is able to avoid a bending posture at his work. The\r\nobjection on the ground that the tee-square must be held up constantly\r\nwith one hand is overcome by supporting and balancing it with cords and\r\nweights.     (J. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWING AND QUARTERING, part of the penalty anciently ordained in\r\nEngland for treason. Until 1870 the full punishment for the crime was\r\nthat the culprit be dragged on a hurdle to the place of execution; that\r\nhe be hanged by the neck but not till he was dead; that he should be\r\ndisembowelled or drawn and his entrails burned before his eyes; that his\r\nhead be cut off and his body divided into four parts or quartered. This\r\nbrutal penalty was first inflicted in 1284 on the Welsh prince David,\r\nand on Sir William Wallace a few years later. In Richard III.'s reign\r\none Collingbourne, for writing the famous couplet \"The Cat, the Rat and\r\nLovel the Dog, Rule all England under the Hog,\" was executed on Tower\r\nHill. Stow says, \"After having been hanged, he was cut down immediately\r\nand his entrails were then extracted and thrown into the fire, and all\r\nthis was so speedily done that when the executioners pulled out his\r\nheart he spoke and said 'Jesus, Jesus.'\" Edward Marcus Despard and his\r\nsix accomplices were in 1803 hanged, drawn and quartered for conspiring\r\nto assassinate George III. The sentence was last passed (though not\r\ncarried out) upon the Fenians Burke and O'Brien in 1867. There is a\r\ntradition that Harrison the regicide, after being disembowelled, rose\r\nand boxed the ears of the executioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWING-ROOM (a shortened form of \"with-drawing room,\" the longer form\r\nbeing usual in the 16th and 17th centuries), the English name generally\r\nemployed for a room used in a dwelling-house for the reception of\r\ncompany. It originated in the setting apart of such a room, as the more\r\nprivate and exclusive preserve of the ladies of the household, to which\r\nthey withdrew from the dining-room. The term \"drawing-room\" is also used\r\nin a special sense of the formal receptions or \"courts\" held by the\r\nBritish sovereign or his representative, at which ladies are presented,\r\nas distinguished from a \"levee,\" at which men are presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAYTON, MICHAEL (1563-1631), English poet, was born at Hartshill, near\r\nAtherstone, in Warwickshire in 1563. Even in childhood it was his great\r\nambition to excel in writing verses. At the age of ten he was sent as\r\npage into some great family, and a little later he is supposed to have\r\nstudied for some time at Oxford. Sir Henry Goodere of Powlesworth became\r\nhis patron, and introduced him to the countess of Bedford, and for\r\nseveral years he was esquire to Sir Walter Aston. How the early part of\r\nhis life was spent, however, we possess no means of ascertaining. It has\r\nbeen surmised that he served in the army abroad. In 1590 he seems to\r\nhave come up to London, and to have settled there.\r\n\r\nIn 1591 he produced his first book, _The Harmony of the Church_, a\r\nvolume of spiritual poems, dedicated to Lady Devereux. The best piece in\r\nthis is a version of the Song of Solomon, executed with considerable\r\nrichness of expression. A singular and now incomprehensible fate befell\r\nthe book; with the exception of forty copies, seized by the archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, the whole edition was destroyed by public order. It is\r\nprobable that he had come up to town laden with poetic writings, for he\r\npublished a vast amount within the next few years. In 1593 appeared\r\n_Idea: The Shepherd's Garland_, a collection of nine pastorals, in which\r\nhe celebrated his own love-sorrows under the poetic name of Rowland. The\r\ncircumstances of this passion appear more distinctly in the cycle of 64\r\nsonnets, published in 1594, under the title of _Idea's Mirror_, by which\r\nwe learn that the lady lived by the river Ankor in Warwickshire. It\r\nappears that he failed to win his \"Idea,\" and lived and died a bachelor.\r\nIn 1593 appeared the first of Drayton's historical poems, _The Legend of\r\nPiers Gaveston_, and the next year saw the publication of _Matilda_, an\r\nepical poem in rhyme royal. It was about this time, too, that he brought\r\nout _Endimion and Phoebe_, a volume which he never republished, but\r\nwhich contains some interesting autobiographical matter, and\r\nacknowledgments of literary help from Lodge, if not from Spenser and\r\nDaniel also. In his _Fig for Momus_, Lodge has reciprocated these\r\nfriendly courtesies. In 1596 Drayton published his long and important\r\npoem of _Mortimerades_, which deals with the Wars of the Roses, and is a\r\nvery serious production in _ottava rima_. He afterwards enlarged and\r\nmodified this poem, and republished it in 1603 under the title of _The\r\nBarons' Wars_. In 1596 also appeared another historical poem, _The\r\nLegend of Robert, Duke of Normandy_, with which _Piers Gaveston_ was\r\nreprinted. In 1597 appeared _England's Heroical Epistles_, a series of\r\nhistorical studies, in imitation of those of Ovid. These last poems,\r\nwritten in the heroic couplet, contain some of the finest passages in\r\nDrayton's writings.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1597 the first half of the poet's literary life closes. He\r\nhad become famous by this rapid production of volumes, and he rested on\r\nhis oars. It would seem that he was much favoured at the court of\r\nElizabeth, and he hoped that it would be the same with her successor.\r\nBut when, in 1603, he addressed a poem of compliment to James I., on his\r\naccession, it was ridiculed, and his services rudely rejected. His\r\nbitterness of spirit found expression in a satire, _The Owl_, which he\r\nprinted in 1604, although he had no talent in this kind of composition.\r\nNot much more entertaining was his scriptural narrative of _Moses in a\r\nMap of his Miracles_, a sort of epic in heroics printed the same year.\r\nIn 1605 Drayton reprinted his most important works, that is to say, his\r\nhistorical poems and the _Idea_, in a single volume which ran through\r\neight editions during his lifetime. He also collected his smaller\r\npieces, hitherto unedited, in a volume undated, but probably published\r\nin 1605, under the title of _Poems Lyric and Pastoral_; these consisted\r\nof odes, eclogues, and a fantastic satire called _The Man in the Moon_.\r\nSome of the odes are extremely spirited. In this volume he printed for\r\nthe first time the famous _Ballad of Agincourt_.\r\n\r\nHe had adopted as early as 1598 the extraordinary resolution of\r\ncelebrating all the points of topographical or antiquarian interest in\r\nthe island of Great Britain, and on this laborious work he was engaged\r\nfor many years. At last, in 1613, the first part of this vast work was\r\npublished under the title of _Poly-Olbion_, eighteen books being\r\nproduced, to which the learned Selden supplied notes. The success of\r\nthis great work, which has since become so famous, was very small at\r\nfirst, and not until 1622 did Drayton succeed in finding a publisher\r\nwilling to undertake the risk of bringing out twelve more books in a\r\nsecond part. This completed the survey of England, and the poet, who had\r\nhoped \"to crown Scotland with flowers,\" and arrive at last at the\r\nOrcades, never crossed the Tweed. In 1627 he published another of his\r\nmiscellaneous volumes, and this contains some of his most characteristic\r\nand exquisite writing. It consists of the following pieces: _The Battle\r\nof Agincourt_, an historical poem in _ottava rima_ (not to be confused\r\nwith his ballad on the same subject), and _The Miseries of Queen\r\nMargaret_, written in the same verse and manner; _Nimphidia, the Court\r\nof Faery_, a most joyous and graceful little epic of fairyland; _The\r\nQuest of Cinthia_ and _The Shepherd's Sirena_, two lyrical pastorals;\r\nand finally _The Moon Calf_, a sort of satire. Of these _Nimphidia_ is\r\nperhaps the best thing Drayton ever wrote, except his famous ballad on\r\nthe battle of Agincourt; it is quite unique of its kind and full of rare\r\nfantastic fancy.\r\n\r\nThe last of Drayton's voluminous publications was _The Muses' Elizium_\r\nin 1630. He died in London on the 23rd of December 1631, was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey, and had a monument placed over him by the countess of\r\nDorset, with memorial lines attributed to Ben Jonson. Of the particulars\r\nof Drayton's life we know almost nothing but what he himself tells us;\r\nhe enjoyed the friendship of some of the best men of the age. He\r\ncorresponded familiarly with Drummond; Ben Jonson, William Browne,\r\nGeorge Wither and others were among his friends. There is a tradition\r\nthat he was a friend of Shakespeare, supported by a statement of John\r\nWard, once vicar of Stratford-on-Avon, that \"Shakespear, Drayton and Ben\r\nJonson had a merry meeting, and it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespear\r\ndied of a feavour there contracted.\" In one of his poems, an \"elegy\" or\r\nepistle to Mr Henry Reynolds, he has left some valuable criticisms on\r\npoets whom he had known. He was even engaged in the labour of the\r\ndramatists; at least he had a share, with Munday, Chettle and Wilson, in\r\nwriting _Sir John Oldcastle_, which was printed in 1600. That he was a\r\nrestless and discontented, as well as a worthy, man may be gathered from\r\nhis own admissions.\r\n\r\nThe works of Drayton are bulky, and, in spite of the high place that he\r\nholds in critical esteem, it cannot be pretended that he is much read.\r\nFor this his ponderous style is much to blame. The _Poly-Olbion_, the\r\nmost famous but far from the most successful of his writings, is tedious\r\nand barren in the extreme. It was, he tells us, a \"Herculean toil\" to\r\nhim to compose it, and we are conscious of the effort. The metre in\r\nwhich it is composed, a couplet of alexandrines, like the French\r\nclassical measure, is wholly unsuited to the English language, and\r\nbecomes excessively wearisome to the reader, who forgets the learning\r\nand ingenuity of the poet in labouring through the harsh and overgrown\r\nlines. His historical poems, which he was constantly rewriting and\r\nimproving, are much more interesting, and often rise to a true poetic\r\neloquence. His pastorals are brilliant, but overladen with colour and\r\nsweet to insipidity. He is, with the one magnificent exception of \"Since\r\nthere's no help, come let us kiss and part,\" which was first printed in\r\n1619, an indifferent sonneteer. The poet with whom it is most natural to\r\ncompare him is Daniel; he is more rough and vigorous, more varied and\r\nmore daring than the latter, but Daniel surpasses him in grace, delicacy\r\nand judgment. In their elegies and epistles, however, the two writers\r\nfrequently resemble each other. Drayton, however, approaches the very\r\nfirst poets of the Elizabethan era in his charming _Nimphidia_, a poem\r\nwhich inspired Herrick with his sweet fairy fancies and stands alone of\r\nits kind in English literature; while some of his odes and lyrics are\r\ninspired by noble feeling and virile imagination.\r\n\r\n  In 1748 a folio edition of Drayton's complete works was published\r\n  under the editorial supervision of William Oldys, and again in 1753\r\n  there appeared an issue in four volumes. But these were very\r\n  unintelligently and inaccurately prepared. A complete edition of\r\n  Drayton's works with variant readings was projected by Richard Hooper\r\n  in 1876, but was never carried to a conclusion; a volume of\r\n  selections, edited by A. H. Bullen, appeared in 1883. See especially\r\n  Oliver Elton, _Michael Drayton_ (1906). (E. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREAM (from a root _dreug_, connected with Germ. _trügen_, to deceive),\r\nthe state of consciousness during sleep; it may also be defined as a\r\nhallucination or illusion peculiarly associated with the condition of\r\nsleep, but not necessarily confined to that state. In sleep the\r\nwithdrawal of the mind from the external world is more complete and the\r\nobjectivity of the dream images is usually unquestioned, whereas in the\r\nwaking state the hallucination is usually recognized as such; we may,\r\nhowever, be conscious that we are dreaming, and thus in a measure be\r\naware of the hallucinatory character of our percepts. The physiological\r\nnature of sleep (q.v.; see also MUSCLE AND NERVE) and of dreaming is\r\nobscure. As a rule the control over the voluntary muscles in dreams is\r\nslight; the sleep-walker is the exception and not the rule, and the\r\nmotor activity represented in the dream is seldom realized in practice,\r\nlargely, no doubt, because we are ignorant, under these circumstances,\r\nof the spatial relations of our bodies. Among the psychological problems\r\nraised by dreams are the condition of attention, which is variously\r\nregarded as altogether absent or as fixed, the extent of mental control,\r\nand the relation of ideas and motor impulses. There is present in all\r\ndreams a certain amount of dissociation of consciousness, or of\r\nobstructed association, which may manifest itself in the preliminary\r\nstage of drowsiness by such phenomena as the apparent transformation or\r\ninversion of the words of a book. We may distinguish two types of\r\ndreams, (a) representative or centrally initiated, (b) presentative or\r\ndue to the stimulation of the end organs of sense. In both cases, the\r\ndream having once been initiated, we are concerned with a process of\r\nreasoning, i.e. the combination of ideas suggested by resemblances or\r\nother associative elements. The false reasoning of dreams is due in the\r\nfirst place to the absence, to a large extent, of the memory elements on\r\nwhich our ordinary reasoning depends, and, secondly, to the absence of\r\nsensory elements.\r\n\r\n_Objectivity of Dreams._--In waking life we distinguish ideas or mental\r\nimages from real objects by the fact that we are able under normal\r\ncircumstances to dismiss the former at will. In sleep, on the other\r\nhand, we have, in the first place, no real objects with which to compare\r\nthe images, which therefore take on a character of reality comparable to\r\nthe hallucination of waking life; moreover, powers of visualization and\r\nother faculties are enhanced in sleep, so that the strength of dream\r\nimages considerably exceeds those of the mental images of the ordinary\r\nman; changes in powers of attention, volition and memory help to\r\nincrease the hallucinatory force of the dream. In the second place, the\r\nideas of our dreams are presented in the form of images, which we are\r\nunable to dismiss; we therefore mistake them for realities, exactly as\r\nthe sufferer from delirium tremens in waking life is apt to regard his\r\nphantoms as real.\r\n\r\n_Relations of Dreaming and Sleep._--It has been maintained by Hamilton\r\nand others (see below, Modern Views) that dreams invariably accompany\r\nsleep, and that we always find ourselves dreaming when we are awakened.\r\nBut even if it were true that dreams were invariably experienced at the\r\nmoment of waking, this would not by any means establish the invariable\r\nconcomitance of dreams and sleep of all sorts; at most it would show\r\nthat imperfect sleep is a condition of dreaming; in the same way, dreams\r\nbefore wakening, known to have taken place either from the recollection\r\nof the dreamer or from the observation of another person, may clearly be\r\ndue to imperfect wakening, followed by a deepening of sleep. It is,\r\nhowever, by no means true that awakening from sleep is invariably\r\naccompanied by a dream; in considering the question it must be\r\nrecollected that it is complicated by the common experience of very\r\nrapid forgetfulness of even a vivid and complicated dream, only the fact\r\nof having dreamt remaining in the memory; it is clear that amnesia may\r\ngo so far that even the fact of dreaming may be forgotten. On the whole,\r\nhowever, there appear to be no good grounds for the assertion that we\r\nalways dream when we are asleep. On the other hand, there is no proof\r\nthat partial awakening is a necessary condition of dreaming.\r\n\r\n_Representative Dreams._--Centrally initiated dreams may be due to a\r\nkind of automatic excitation of the cerebral regions, especially in the\r\ncase of those clearly arising from the occupations or sensations of the\r\nday or the hours immediately preceding the dream. To the same cause we\r\nmay attribute the recalling of images apparently long since forgotten.\r\nSome of these revivals of memory may be due to the fact that links of\r\nassociation which are insufficient to restore an idea to consciousness\r\nin the waking state may suffice to do so in sleep. Just as a good\r\nvisualizer in his waking moments may call up an object never clearly\r\nseen and yet distinguish the parts, so in sleep, as L. F. A. Maury\r\n(1817-1892) and others have shown, an image may be more distinct in a\r\ndream than it was when originally presented (see also below, Memory).\r\n\r\n_Presentative Dreams._--The dreams due to real sensations, more or less\r\nmetamorphosed, may arise (a) from the states of the internal organs, (b)\r\nfrom muscular states, (c) from subjective sensations due to the\r\ncirculation, &c., or (d) from the ordinary cause of the action of\r\nexternal stimuli on the organs of sense.\r\n\r\n(a) The state of the stomach, heart, &c., has long been recognized as\r\nimportant in the causation of dreams (see below, Classical Views). The\r\ncommon sensation of flying seems to be due in many cases to the\r\ndisturbance of these organs setting up sensations resembling those felt\r\nin rapidly ascending or descending, as in a swing or a lift. Indigestion\r\nis a frequent cause of nightmare--the term given to oppressive and\r\nhorrible dreams--and bodily discomfort is sometimes translated into the\r\nmoral region, giving rise to the dream that a murder has been committed.\r\n(b) Dreams of flying, &c., have also been attributed to the condition of\r\nthe muscles during sleep; W. Wundt remarks that the movements of the\r\nbody, such as breathing, extensions of the limbs and so on, must give\r\nrise to dream fancies; the awkward position of the limbs may also excite\r\nimages. (c) Especially important, probably, for the dreams of the early\r\npart of the night are the retinal conditions to which are due the\r\n_illusions hypnagogiques_ of the preliminary drowsy stage; but probably\r\nLadd goes too far in maintaining that entoptic stimuli, either intra- or\r\nextra-organic in origin, condition all dreams. _Illusions\r\nhypnagogiques_, termed popularly \"faces in the dark,\" of which Maury has\r\ngiven a full account, are the not uncommon sensations experienced,\r\nusually visual and seen with both open and closed eyes, in the interval\r\nbetween retiring to rest and actually falling asleep; they are\r\ncomparable to the crystal-gazing visions of waking moments; though\r\nmainly visual they may also affect other senses. Besides the eye the ear\r\nmay supply material for dreams, when the circulation of the blood\r\nsuggests rushing waters or similar ideas. (d) It is a matter of common\r\nobservation that the temperature of the surface of the body determines\r\nin many cases the character of the dreams, the real circumstances, as\r\nmight be expected from the general character of the dream state, being\r\nexaggerated. In the same way the pressure of bed-clothes, obstruction of\r\nthe supply of air, &c., may serve as the starting-point of dreams. The\r\ncommon dream of being unclothed may perhaps be due to this cause, the\r\nsensations associated with clothing being absent or so far modified as\r\nto be unrecognizable. In the same way the absence of foot-gear may\r\naccount for some dreams of flying. It is possible to test the influence\r\nof external stimuli by direct experiment; Maury made a number of trials\r\nwith the aid of an assistant.\r\n\r\n_Rapidity of Dreams._--It has often been asserted that we dream with\r\nextreme rapidity; but this statement is by no means borne out by\r\nexperiment. In a trial recorded by J. Clavière the beginning of the\r\ndream was accurately fixed by the sounding of an alarm clock, which\r\nrang, then was silent for 22 seconds, and then began to ring\r\ncontinuously; the dream scene was in a theatre, and he found by actual\r\ntrial that the time required in ordinary life for the performance of the\r\nscenes during the interval of silence was about the same as in ordinary\r\nlife. Spontaneous dreams seem to show a different state of things; it\r\nmust be remembered that (1) dreams are commonly a succession of images,\r\nthe number of which cannot be legitimately compared with the number of\r\nextra-organic stimuli which would correspond to them in ordinary life;\r\nthe real comparison is with mental images; and (2) the rapidity of\r\nassociation varies enormously in ordinary waking life. No proof,\r\ntherefore, that some dreams are slow can show that this mentation in\r\nothers is not extremely rapid. The most commonly quoted case is one of\r\nMaury's; a bed-pole fell on his neck, and (so it is stated) he dreamt\r\nof the French Revolution, the scenes culminating in the fall of the\r\nguillotine on his neck; this has been held to show that (1) dreams are\r\nextremely rapid; and (2) we construct a dream story leading up to the\r\nexternal stimulus which is assumed to have originated the dream. But\r\nMaury's dream was not recorded till many years after it had occurred;\r\nthere is nothing to show that the dream, in this as in other similar\r\ncases, was not in progress when the bed-pole fell, which thus by mere\r\ncoincidence would have intervened at the psychological moment; Maury's\r\nmemory on waking may have been to some extent hallucinatory. But there\r\nare records of waking states, not necessarily abnormal, in which\r\ntime-perception is disturbed and brief incidents seem interminably long;\r\non the other hand, it appears from the experiences of persons recovered\r\nfrom drowning that there is great rapidity of ideation before the\r\nextinction of consciousness; the same rapidity of thought has been\r\nobserved in a fall from a bicycle.\r\n\r\n_Reason in Dreams._--Studies of dreams of normal individuals based on\r\nlarge collections of instances are singularly few in number; such as\r\nthere are indicate great variations in the source of dream thoughts and\r\nimages, in the coherence of the dream, and in the powers of memory. In\r\nordinary life attention dominates the images presented; in dreams\r\nheterogeneous and disconnected elements are often combined; a\r\nresemblance need not even have been consciously recognized for the mind\r\nto combine two impressions in a dream; for example, an aching tooth may\r\n(according to the dream) be extracted, and found to resemble rocks on\r\nthe sea-shore, which had not struck the waking mind as in any way like\r\nteeth. Incongruence and incoherence are not, however, a necessary\r\ncharacteristic of dreams, and individuals are found whose dream ideas\r\nand scenes show a power of reasoning and orderliness equal to that of a\r\nscene imagined or experienced in ordinary life. In some cases the\r\nreasoning power may attain a higher level than that of the ordinary\r\nconscious life. In a well-authenticated case Professor Hilprecht was\r\nable in a dream to solve a difficulty connected with two Babylonian\r\ninscriptions, which had not previously been recognized as complementary\r\nto each other; a point of peculiar interest is the dramatic form in\r\nwhich the information came to him--an old Babylonian priest appeared in\r\nhis dream and gave him the clue to the problem (see also below,\r\nPersonality).\r\n\r\n_Memory in Dreams._--Although prima facie the dream memory is\r\nfragmentary and far less complete than the waking memory, it is by no\r\nmeans uncommon to find a revival in sleep of early, apparently quite\r\nforgotten, experiences: more striking is the recollection in dreams of\r\nmatters never supraliminally (see SUBLIMINAL SELF) apperceived at all.\r\n\r\nThe relation between the memory in dreams and in the hypnotic trance is\r\ncurious: suggestions given in the trance may be accepted and then\r\nforgotten or never remembered in ordinary life; this does not prevent\r\nthem from reappearing occasionally in dreams; conversely dreams\r\nforgotten in ordinary life may be remembered in the hypnotic trance.\r\nThese dream memories of other states of consciousness suggest that\r\ndreams are sometimes the product of a deeper stratum of the personality\r\nthan comes into play in ordinary waking life. It must be remembered in\r\nthis connexion that we judge of our dream consciousness by our waking\r\nrecollections, not directly, and our recollection of our dreams is\r\nextraordinarily fragmentary; we do not know how far our dream memory\r\nreally extends. Connected with memory of other states is the question of\r\nmemory in dreams of previous dream states; occasionally a separate chain\r\nof memory, analogous to a secondary personality, seems to be formed. We\r\nmay be also conscious that we have been dreaming, and subsequently,\r\nwithout intermediate waking, relate as a dream the dream previously\r\nexperienced. In spite of the irrationality of dreams in general, it by\r\nno means follows that the earlier and later portions of a dream do not\r\ncohere; we may interpolate an episode and again take up the first\r\nmotive, exactly as happens in real life. The strength of the dream\r\nmemory is shown by the recurrence of images in dreams; a picture, the\r\npage of a book, or other image may be reproduced before our eyes several\r\ntimes in the course of a dream without the slightest alteration,\r\nalthough the waking consciousness would be quite incapable of such a\r\nfeat of visualizing. In this connexion may be mentioned the phenomenon\r\nof redreaming; the same dream may recur either on the same or on\r\ndifferent nights; this seems to be in many cases pathological or due to\r\ndrugs, but may also occur under normal conditions.\r\n\r\n_Personality._--As a rule the personality of the dreamer is unchanged;\r\nbut it also happens that the confusion of identity observed with regard\r\nto other objects embraces the dreamer himself; he imagines himself to be\r\nsome one else; he is alternately actor and observer; he may see himself\r\nplaying a part or may divest himself of his body and wander\r\nincorporeally. Ordinary dreams, however, do not go beyond a splitting of\r\npersonality; we hold conversations, and are intensely surprised at the\r\nutterances of a dream figure, which, however, is merely an _alter ego_.\r\nAs in the case of Hilprecht (see above) the information given by another\r\npart of the personality may not only appear but actually be novel.\r\n\r\n_Supernormal Dreams._--In addition to dreams in which there is a revival\r\nof memory or a rise into consciousness of facts previously only\r\nsubliminally cognized, a certain number of dreams are on record in which\r\ntelepathy (q.v.) seems to play a part; much of the evidence is, however,\r\ndiscounted by the possibility of hallucinatory memory. Another class of\r\ndreams (prodromic) is that in which the abnormal bodily states of the\r\ndreamer are brought to his knowledge in sleep, sometimes in a symbolical\r\nform; thus a dream of battle or sanguinary conflict may presage a\r\nhaemorrhage. The increased power of suggestion which is the normal\r\naccompaniment of the hypnotic trance may make its appearance in dreams,\r\nand exercise either a curative influence or act capriciously in\r\nproducing hysteria and the tropic changes known as \"stigmata.\" We may\r\nmeet with various forms of hyperaesthesia in dreams; quite apart from\r\nthe recovery of sight by those who have lost it wholly or in part (see\r\nbelow, Dreams of the Blind), we find that the powers of the senses may\r\nundergo an intensification, and, e.g., the power of appreciating music\r\nbe enormously enhanced in persons usually indifferent to it. Mention\r\nmust also be made of the experience of R. L. Stevenson, who tells in\r\n_Across the Plains_ how by self-suggestion he was able to secure from\r\nhis dreams the motives of some of his best romances.\r\n\r\n_Voluntary Action in Dreams._--Connected with dreams voluntarily\r\ninfluenced is the question of how far dreams once initiated are\r\nmodifiable at the will of the dreamer. Some few observers, like F. W. H.\r\nMyers and Dr F. van Eeden, record that they can at longer or shorter\r\nintervals control their actions in their dreams, though usually to a\r\nless extent than their imagined actions in waking life. Dr van Eeden,\r\nfor example, tells us that he has what he calls a \"clear dream\" once a\r\nmonth and is able to predetermine what he will do when he becomes aware\r\nthat he is dreaming.\r\n\r\n_Dreams of Children._--Opinions differ widely as to the age at which\r\nchildren begin to dream; G. Compayré maintains that dreaming has been\r\nobserved in the fourth month, but reflex action is always a possible\r\nexplanation of the observed facts. S. de Sanctis found that in boys of\r\neleven only one out of eight said that he dreamt seldom, as against four\r\nout of seven at the age of six; but we cannot exclude the possibility\r\nthat dreams were frequent but forgotten. If correct, the observation\r\nsuggests that dreams appear comparatively late. Individual cases of\r\ndreaming, or possibly of waking hallucination, are known as early as the\r\nage of two and a half years; according to de Sanctis dreams occur before\r\nthe fifth year, but are seldom remembered; as a rule the conscious dream\r\nage begins with the fourth year; speech or movement, however, in earlier\r\nyears, though they may be attributed to reflex action, are more probably\r\ndue to dreams.\r\n\r\n_Dreams of the Old._--In normal individuals above the age of sixty-five\r\nde Sanctis found dreams were rare; atmospheric influences seem to be\r\nimportant elements in causing them; memory of them is weak; they are\r\nemotionally poor, and deal with long past scenes.\r\n\r\n_Dreams of Adults._--Any attempt to record or influence our dreams may\r\nbe complicated by (a) direct suggestion, leading to the production of\r\nthe phenomena for which we are looking, and (b) indirect suggestion\r\nleading to the more lively recollection of dreams in general and of\r\ncertain dreams in particular. Consequently it cannot be assumed that the\r\nfacts thus ascertained represent the normal conditions. According to F.\r\nHeerwagen's statistics women sleep more lightly and dream more than men;\r\nthe frequency of dreams is proportional to their vividness; women who\r\ndream sleep longer than those who do not; dreams tend to become less\r\nfrequent with advancing age. The total number of remembered dreams\r\nvaries considerably with different observers, some attaining an average\r\nof ten per night. The senses mainly active in dreams are, according to\r\none set of experiments, vision in 60%, hearing in 5%, taste in 3%, and\r\nsmell in 1.5%, where the dreamers had looked at coloured papers before\r\nfalling asleep; when taste or smell had been stimulated, the visual\r\ndreams fell to about 50%, and the sense stimulated was active twice as\r\noften as it would otherwise be; dreams in which motion was a prominent\r\nfeature were 10% of the former class, 14% and 18% of the two latter.\r\nExperiments by J. Mourly Vold show even more distinctly the influence of\r\nsuggestion both as to the form, visual or otherwise, and the content\r\n(colours and forms of objects) of dreams. According to most observers\r\ndreams are most vivid and frequent between the ages of 20 and 25, but H.\r\nMaudsley puts the maximum between 30 and 35. De Sanctis got replies from\r\n165 men and 55 women: the proportion between the sexes closely agrees\r\nwith the results attained by Heerwagen and M. W. Calkins; 13% of men and\r\n33% of women said they always dreamt, 27% and 45% often, 50% and 13%\r\nrarely, and the remainder (precisely the same percentage for men and\r\nwomen--9.09) either did not dream or did not remember that they dreamt.\r\nNearly twice as many women as men had vivid dreams; in the matter of\r\ncomplication of the dream experiences the sexes are about equal; daily\r\nlife supplies more material in the dreams of men; nearly twice as many\r\nwomen as men remember their dreams clearly, a fact which hangs together\r\nto some extent with the vividness of the dreams, though it by no means\r\nfollows that a vivid dream is well remembered. There are great\r\nvariations in the emotional character of dreams; some observers report\r\ntwice as many unpleasant dreams as the reverse; in other cases the\r\nemotions seem to be absent; others again have none but pleasing dreams.\r\nIndividual experience also varies very largely as to the time when most\r\ndreams are experienced; in some cases the great majority are subsequent\r\nto 6.30 A.M.; others find that quite half occur before 4.0 A.M.\r\n\r\n_Dreams of the Neuropathic, Insane, Idiots, &c._--Much attention has\r\nbeen given to the dreams of hysterical subjects. It appears that their\r\ndreams are specially liable to exercise an influence over their waking\r\nlife, perhaps because they do not distinguish them, any more than their\r\nwaking hallucinations, from reality. P. Janet maintains that the cause\r\nof hysteria may be sought in a dream. The dreams of the hysterical have\r\na tendency to recur. Epileptic subjects dream less than the hysterical,\r\nand their dreams are seldom of a terrifying nature; certain dreams seem\r\nto take the place of an epileptic attack. Dreaming seems to be rare in\r\nidiots. De Sanctis divides paranoiacs into three classes: (a) those with\r\nsystematized delusions, (b) those with frequent hallucinations, and (c)\r\ndegenerates;--the dreams of the first class resemble their delusions;\r\nthe second class is distinguished by the complexity of its dreams; the\r\nthird by their vividness, by their delusions of megalomania, and by\r\ntheir influence on daily life. Alcoholic subjects have vivid and\r\nterrifying dreams, characterized by the frequent appearance of animals\r\nin them, and delirium tremens may originate during sleep.\r\n\r\n_Dreams of the Blind, Deaf, &c._--As regards visual dreams the blind\r\nfall into three classes--(1) those who are blind from birth or become\r\nblind before the age of five; (2) those who become blind at the\r\n\"critical age\" from five to seven; (3) those who become blind after the\r\nage of seven. The dreams of the first class are non-visual; but in the\r\ndreams of Helen Keller there are traces of a visual content; the second\r\nclass sometimes has visual dreams; the third class does not differ from\r\nnormal persons, though visual dreams may fade away after many years of\r\nblindness. In the case of the partially blind the clearness of vision in\r\na dream exceeds that of normal life when the partial loss of sight\r\noccurred in the sixth or later years. The education of Helen Keller is\r\ninteresting from another point of view; after losing the senses of sight\r\nand hearing in infancy she began her education at seven years and was\r\nable to articulate at eleven; it is recorded that she \"talked\" in her\r\ndreams soon after. This accords with the experience of normal\r\nindividuals who acquire a foreign language. Her extraordinary memory\r\nenables her to recall faintly some traces of the sunlit period of her\r\nlife, but they hardly affect her dreams, so far as can be judged. The\r\ndreams of the blind, according to the records of F. Hitschmann, present\r\nsome peculiarities; animals as well as man speak; toothache and bodily\r\npains are perceived as such; impersonal dreaming, taking the form of a\r\ndrama or reading aloud, is found; and he had a strong tendency to\r\nreproduce or create verse.\r\n\r\n_Dreams of Animals._--We are naturally reduced to inference in dealing\r\nwith animals as with very young children; but various observations seem\r\nto show that dreams are common in older dogs, especially after hunting\r\nexpeditions; in young dogs sleep seems to be quieter; dogs accustomed to\r\nthe chase seem to dream more than other kinds.\r\n\r\n_Dreams among the Non-European Peoples._--In the lower stages of culture\r\nthe dream is regarded as no less real and its personages as no less\r\nobjective than those of the ordinary waking life; this is due in the\r\nmain to the habit of mind of such peoples (see ANIMISM), but possibly in\r\nsome measure also to the occurrence of veridical dreams (see TELEPATHY).\r\nIn either case the savage explanation is animistic, and animism is\r\ncommonly assumed to have been developed very largely as a result of\r\ntheorising dreams. Two explanations of a dream are found among the lower\r\nraces: (1) that the soul of the dreamer goes out, and visits his\r\nfriends, living or dead, his old haunts or unfamiliar scenes and so on;\r\nor (2) that the souls of the dead and others come to visit him, either\r\nof their own motion or at divine command. In either of the latter cases\r\nor at a higher stage of culture when the dream is regarded as god-sent,\r\nthough no longer explained in terms of animism, it is often regarded as\r\noracular (see ORACLE), the explanation being sometimes symbolical,\r\nsometimes simple.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of dreams which have a special importance in the\r\nlower cultures: (1) the dream or vision of the initiation fast; and (2)\r\nthe dream caused by the process known as incubation, which is often\r\nanalogous to the initiation fast. In many parts of North America the\r\nindividual Indian acquires a tutelary spirit, known as _manito_ or\r\n_nagual_, by his initiation dream or vision; the idea being perhaps that\r\nthe spirit by the act of appearing shows its subjection to the will of\r\nthe man. Similarly, the magician acquires his familiar in North America,\r\nAustralia and elsewhere by dreaming of an animal. Incubation consists in\r\nretiring to sleep in a temple, sometimes on the top of a mountain or\r\nother unusual spot, in order to obtain a revelation through a dream.\r\nFasting, continence and other observances are frequently prescribed as\r\npreliminaries. Certain classes of dreams have, especially in the middle\r\nages, been attributed to the influence of evil spirits (see DEMONOLOGY).\r\n\r\n_Classical and Medieval Views of Dreams._--Side by side with the\r\nprevalent animistic view of dreams we find in antiquity and among the\r\nsemi-civilized attempts at philosophical or physiological explanations\r\nof dreams. Democritus, from whom the Epicureans derived their theory,\r\nheld the cause of them to be the simulacra or phantasms of corporeal\r\nobjects which are constantly floating about the atmosphere and attack\r\nthe soul in sleep--a view hardly distinguishable from animism.\r\nAristotle, however, refers them to the impressions left by objects seen\r\nwith the eyes of the body; he further remarks on the exaggeration of\r\nslight stimuli when they are incorporated into a dream; a small sound\r\nbecomes a noise like thunder. Plato, too, connects dreaming with the\r\nnormal waking operations of the mind; Pliny, on the other hand, admits\r\nthis only for dreams which take place after meals, the remainder being\r\nsupernatural. Cicero, however, takes the view that they are simply\r\nnatural occurrences no more and no less than the mental operations and\r\nsensations of the waking state. The pathological side of dreams\r\nattracted the notice of physicians. Hippocrates was disposed to admit\r\nthat some dreams might be divine, but held that others were premonitory\r\nof diseased states of the body. Galen took the same view in some of his\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\nSymbolical interpretations are combined with pathological no less than\r\nanimistic interpretations of dreams; they are also extremely common\r\namong the lower classes in Europe at the present day, but in this case\r\nno consistent explanation of their importance for the divination of\r\nfuture events is usually discoverable. Among the Greeks Plato in the\r\n_Timaeus_ (ch. xlvi, xlvii) explains dreams as prophetic visions\r\nreceived by the lower appetitive soul through the liver; their\r\ninterpretation requires intelligence. The Stoics seem to have held that\r\ndreams may be a divine revelation and more than one volume on the\r\ninterpretation of dreams has come down to us, the most important being\r\nperhaps the [Greek: Oneirokritika] of Daldianus Artemidorus. We find\r\nparallels to this in a Mussulman work by Gabdorrachaman, translated by\r\nPierre Vattier under the name of _Onirocrite mussulman_, and in the\r\nnumerous books on the interpretation of dreams which circulate at the\r\npresent day. In Siam dream books are found (_Intern. Archiv für Anthr._\r\nviii 150); one of the functions of the Australian medicine man is to\r\ndecide how a dream is to be interpreted.\r\n\r\n_Modern Views._--The doctrine of Descartes that existence depended upon\r\nthought naturally led his followers to maintain that the mind is always\r\nthinking and consequently that dreaming is continuous. Locke replied to\r\nthis that men are not always conscious of dreaming, and it is hard to be\r\nconceived that the soul of the sleeping man should this moment be\r\nthinking, while the soul of the waking man cannot recollect in the next\r\nmoment a jot of all those thoughts. That we always dream was maintained\r\nby Leibnitz, Kant, Sir W. Hamilton and others; the latter refutes the\r\nargument of Locke by the just observation that the somnambulist has\r\ncertainly been conscious, but fails to recall the fact when he returns\r\nto the normal state.\r\n\r\nIt has been commonly held by metaphysicians that the nature of dreams is\r\nexplained by the suspension of volition during sleep; Dugald Stewart\r\nasserts that it is not wholly dormant but loses its hold on the\r\nfaculties, and he thus accounts for the incoherence of dreams and the\r\napparent reality of dream images.\r\n\r\nCudworth, from the orderly sequence of dream combinations and their\r\nnovelty, argues that the state arises, not from any \"fortuitous dancings\r\nof the spirits,\" but from the \"phantastical power of the soul.\"\r\nAccording to K. A. Scherner, dreaming is a decentralization of the\r\nmovement of life; the ego becomes purely receptive and is merely the\r\npoint around which the peripheral life plays in perfect freedom. Hobbes\r\nheld that dreams all proceed from the agitation of the inward parts of a\r\nman's body, which, owing to their connexion with the brain, serve to\r\nkeep the latter in motion. For Schopenhauer the cause of dreams is the\r\nstimulation of the brain by the internal regions of the organism through\r\nthe sympathetic nervous system. These impressions the mind afterwards\r\nworks up into quasi-realities by means of its forms of space, time,\r\ncausality, &c.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.--For full lists of books and articles see J. M.

Eng. _dragie_, through Fr. _dragée_, from Gr. [Greek: tragêmata],\r\nsweetmeats, it means a confection of sugar formed with seeds, bits of\r\nspice or medicinal agents. The word in this sense is obsolete, but\r\nsurvives in \"dredger,\" a box with a perforated top used for sprinkling\r\nsuch a sugar-mixture, flour or other powdered substance. \"Dredge\" is\r\nalso a local term for a mixed crop of oats and barley sown together\r\n(\"maslin\" or \"meslin,\" cf. Fr. _dragée_), and in mining is applied to\r\nore of a mixed value. (2) Connected with \"drag,\" or at least derived\r\nfrom the same root, dredge or dredger is a mechanical appliance for\r\ncollecting together and drawing to the surface (\"dredging\") objects and\r\nmaterial from the beds of rivers or the bottom of the sea. In the\r\nfollowing account the operations of dredging in this sense are discussed\r\n(1) as involved in hydraulic engineering, (2) in connexion with the work\r\nof the naturalist in marine biology.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nDredging is the name given by engineers to the process of excavating\r\nmaterials under water, raising them to the surface and depositing them\r\nin barges, or delivering them through a shoot, a longitudinal conveyor,\r\nor pipes, to the place where it is desired to deposit them. It has long\r\nbeen useful in works of marine and hydraulic engineering, and has been\r\nbrought in modern times to a state of high perfection.\r\n\r\nThe employment of dredging plant and the selection of special appliances\r\nto be used in different localities and in varying circumstances require\r\nthe exercise of sound judgment on the part of the engineer. In rivers\r\nand estuaries where the bottom is composed of light soils, and where the\r\nscour of the tide can be governed by training walls and other works\r\nconstructed at reasonable expense, so as to keep the channel clear\r\nwithout dredging, it is manifest that dredging machinery with its large\r\ncost for working expenses and for annual upkeep should be as far as\r\npossible avoided. On the other hand, where the bottom consists of clay,\r\nrock or other hard substances, dredging must, in the first instance at\r\nany rate, be employed to deepen and widen the channel which it is sought\r\nto improve. In some instances, such as the river Mississippi, a deep\r\nchannel has for many years been maintained by jetties, with occasional\r\nresort to dredging to preserve the required channel section and to\r\nhasten its enlargement. The bar of the river Mersey is 11 m. from land,\r\nand the cost of training works would be so great as to forbid their\r\nconstruction; but, by a capital expenditure of £120,000 and an annual\r\nexpense of £20,000 for three years, the depth of water over the bar at\r\nlow tide has been increased by dredging from 11 ft. to 27 ft., the\r\nchannel being 1500 ft. wide.\r\n\r\n_\"Bag and Spoon\" Dredger._--The first employment of machinery for\r\ndredging is, like the discovery of the canal lock, claimed by Holland\r\nand Italy, in both of which countries it is believed to have been in use\r\nbefore it was introduced into Britain. The Dutch, at an early period,\r\nused what is termed the \"bag and spoon\" dredger for cleansing their\r\ncanals. The \"spoon\" consisted of a ring of iron about 2 ft. in diameter\r\nflattened and steeled for about a third of its circumference and having\r\na bag of strong leather attached to it by leathern thongs. The ring and\r\nbag were fixed to a pole which was lowered to the bottom from the side\r\nof a barge moored in the canal or river. The \"spoon\" was then dragged\r\nalong the bottom by a rope made fast to the iron ring actuated by a\r\nwindlass placed at the other end of the barge, the pole being prevented\r\nfrom rising by a hitched rope which caused the \"spoon\" to penetrate the\r\nbottom and fill the bag. When the \"spoon\" reached the end of the barge\r\nwhere the windlass was placed, the winding was still continued, and the\r\nsuspended rope being nearly perpendicular the \"bag\" was raised to the\r\ngunwale of the barge and the excavated material emptied into the barge.\r\nThe \"bag\" was then hauled back to the opposite end to be lowered for\r\nanother supply. This system is still in use, but is only adaptable to a\r\nlimited depth of water and a soft bottom; it has been largely used in\r\ncanals and frequently in the Thames. At the Fosdyke Canal in\r\nLincolnshire 135,000 tons were raised in the manner described. According\r\nto J. J. Webster (_Proc. Inst. C. E._ vol. 89), the first application\r\nof steam power for dredging operations was to a \"spoon & bag\" dredger\r\nfor cleansing Sunderland harbour, the engine being made by Messrs\r\nBoulton & Watt of Soho, Birmingham.\r\n\r\n_Dredging by Bucket between Two Lighters._--Another plan of dredging,\r\npractised at an early period in rivers of considerable breadth, was to\r\nmoor two barges, one on each side of the river. Between them was slung\r\nan iron dredging bucket, which was attached to both barges by chains\r\nwound on the barrels of a crab winch worked by six men in one barge and\r\nround a simple windlass worked by two men in the other barge. The\r\nbucket, being lowered at the side of the barge carrying the windlass,\r\nwas drawn across the bottom of the river by the crab winch on the other\r\nbarge; and having been raised and emptied, it was hauled across by the\r\nopposite windlass for repetition of the process. This process was in use\r\nin the River Tay until 1833.\r\n\r\n_Bucket Ladder Dredgers._--The earliest record of a bucket ladder\r\ndredger is contained in the first paper of the first volume (1836) of\r\nthe _Transactions_ of the Institution of Civil Engineers. This machine\r\nwas brought into use at the Hull Docks about 1782. The bucket chain was\r\ndriven by two horses working a horse-gear on the deck of the vessel. The\r\nbuckets were constructed of 5/8 in. bars of iron spaced 1/8 in. apart,\r\nand were 4 ft. long, 13 in. deep, 12 in. wide at the mouth and about 6\r\nin. wide at the bottom. This dredger raised about 30 tons per hour at\r\nthe cost of 2½d. per ton, which covered the wages of three men working\r\nthe dredger, eight men working the lighters and the keep of three\r\nhorses. A dredger of this kind and power would only work in ballast, mud\r\nor other soft material, but the machine was gradually improved and\r\nincreased in capacity and power by different manufacturers until it\r\nbecame a very efficient machine in skilful hands, excavating and raising\r\nmaterial from depths of 5 ft. to 60 ft. of water at a cost not very\r\ndifferent from, and in many cases less than, that at which the same work\r\ncould be performed on land. With the powerful dredgers now constructed,\r\nalmost all materials, except solid rock or very large boulders, can be\r\ndredged with ease. Loose gravel is perhaps the most favourable material\r\nto work in, but a powerful dredger will readily break up and raise\r\nindurated beds of gravel, clay and boulders, and has even found its way\r\nthrough the surface of soft rock, though it will not penetrate very far\r\ninto it. In some cases steel diggers alternating with the buckets on the\r\nbucket frame have been successfully employed. The construction of large\r\nsteam dredgers is now carried on by many engineering firms. The main\r\nfeature of the machine is the bucket ladder which is hung at the top end\r\nby eye straps to the frame of the vessel, and at the lower end by a\r\nchain reived in purchase blocks and connected to the hoisting gear, so\r\nthat the ladder may be raised and lowered to suit the varying depths of\r\nwater in which the dredger works. The upper tumbler for working the\r\nbucket chain is generally square or pentagonal in form and made of steel\r\nwith loose steel wearing pieces securely bolted to it. The tumbler is\r\nsecurely keyed to the steel shaft which is connected by gearing and\r\nshafting to the steam engine, a friction block being inserted at a\r\nconvenient point to prevent breakage should any hidden obstacle causing\r\nunusual strain be met with in the path of the buckets. The lower tumbler\r\nis similar in construction to the upper tumbler, but is usually\r\npentagonal or hexagonal in shape. The buckets are generally made with\r\nsteel backs to which the plating of the buckets is riveted; the cutting\r\nedge of the buckets consists of a strong steel bar suitably shaped and\r\nriveted to the body. The intermediate links are made of hammered iron or\r\nsteel with removable steel bushes to take the wear of the connecting\r\npins, which are also of steel. The hoisting gear may be driven either\r\nfrom the main engine by frictional gearing or by an independent set of\r\nengines. Six anchors and chains worked by powerful steam crabs are\r\nprovided for regulating the position of the dredger in regard to its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_Barge-loading Dredgers_ used formerly to be provided with two ladders,\r\none on each side of the vessel, or contained in wells formed in the\r\nvessel near each side. Two ladders were adopted, partly to permit the\r\ndredger to excavate the material close to a quay or wall, and partly to\r\nenable one ladder to work while the other was being repaired. Bucket\r\nladder dredgers are now, however, generally constructed with one central\r\nladder working in a well; frequently the bucket ladder projects at\r\neither the head or stern of the vessel, to enable it to cut its own way\r\nthrough a shoal or bank, a construction which has been found very\r\nuseful. In one modification of this method the bucket ladder is\r\nsupported upon a traversing frame which slides along the fixed framing\r\nof the dredger and moves the bucket ladder forward as soon as it has\r\nbeen sufficiently lowered to clear the end of the well. In places where\r\na large quantity of dredging has to be done, a stationary dredger with\r\nthree or four large hopper barges proves generally to be the most\r\neconomical kind of plant. It has, however, the disadvantage of requiring\r\nlarge capital expenditure, while the dredger and its attendant barges\r\ntake up an amount of space which is sometimes inconvenient where traffic\r\nis large and the navigable width narrow. The principal improvements made\r\nin barge-loading dredgers have been the increase in the size of the\r\nbuckets and the strength of the dredging gear, the application of more\r\neconomical engines for working the machinery, and the use of frictional\r\ngearing for driving the ladder-hoisting gear. It is very important that\r\nthe main drive be fitted with the friction blocks or clutches before\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n  Up to the year 1877 dredgers were seldom made with buckets of a\r\n  capacity exceeding 9 cub. ft., but since that time they have been\r\n  gradually increased in capacity. In the dredger \"Melbourne,\"\r\n  constructed by Messrs William Simons & Co. to the design and\r\n  specification of Messrs Coode, Son & Matthews, about the year 1886,\r\n  the buckets had a capacity of 22 cub. ft., the dredger being capable\r\n  of making 37 ft. of water. The driving power consists of two pairs of\r\n  surface-condensing engines, each of 250 i.h.p., having cylinders 20\r\n  in. and 40 in. in diameter respectively, with a 30 in. stroke, the\r\n  boiler pressure being 90 lb. per sq. in. The vessel is 200 ft. long\r\n  by 36 ft. wide and 11 ft. 6 in. deep, and is driven by twin screw\r\n  propellers. The gearing is arranged so that either pair of engines can\r\n  be employed for dredging. The speed under steam is 7 knots, and in\r\n  free-getting material 800 tons per hour can be dredged with ease. On\r\n  one occasion the dredger loaded 400 tons in 20 minutes. The speed of\r\n  the bucket chain is 83 lineal ft. per minute. The draught of the\r\n  dredger in working trim is 7 ft. forward and 9 ft. aft. The efficiency\r\n  of the machine, or the net work in raising materials compared with the\r\n  power exerted in the cylinders, is about 25%. The dredged material is\r\n  delivered into barges moored alongside. Contrasting favourably with\r\n  former experience, the \"Melbourne\" worked for the first six months\r\n  without a single breakage. She is fitted with very powerful mooring\r\n  winches, a detail which is of great importance to ensure efficiency in\r\n  working.\r\n\r\n  The \"St Austell\" (Plate I. fig. 3), a powerful barge-loading dredger\r\n  195 ft. long by 35 ft. 6 in. beam by 13 ft. deep, fitted with\r\n  twin-screw compound surface-condensing propelling engines of 1000\r\n  i.h.p., either set of engines being available for dredging, was\r\n  constructed for H.M. Dockyard, Devonport, by Messrs Wm. Simons & Co.\r\n  in 1896. This dredger loaded thirty-five 500-ton hopper barges in the\r\n  week ending April 2, 1898, dredging 17,500 tons of material in the\r\n  working time of 29 hours 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n  An instance of a still larger and more powerful dredger is the\r\n  \"Develant,\" constructed by Messrs Wm. Simons & Co., for Nicolaiev,\r\n  South Russia. She is a bow-well, barge-loading, bucket ladder dredger,\r\n  with a length of 186 ft., a breadth, moulded, of 36 ft., and a depth,\r\n  moulded, of 13 ft. The bucket ladder is of sufficient length to dredge\r\n  36 ft. below the water level. The buckets are exceptionally large,\r\n  each having a capacity of 36 cub. ft., or fully two tons weight of\r\n  material, giving a lifting capacity of 1890 tons per hour. At the\r\n  dredging trials 2000 tons of spoil were lifted in one hour with an\r\n  expenditure of 250 i.h.p. The propelling power is supplied by one pair\r\n  of compound surface-condensing marine engines of 850 i.h.p., having\r\n  two cylindrical boilers constructed for a working pressure of 120 lb.\r\n  per sq. in. Each boiler is capable of supplying steam to either the\r\n  propelling or dredging machinery, thus allowing the vessel to always\r\n  have a boiler in reserve. On the trials a speed of 8½ knots was\r\n  obtained. The bucket ladder, which weighs over 100 tons, exclusive of\r\n  dredgings, is raised and lowered by a set of independent engines. For\r\n  manoeuvring, powerful winches driven by independent engines are placed\r\n  at the bow and stern. The vessel is fitted throughout with electric\r\n  light, arc lamps being provided above the deck to enable dredging to\r\n  be carried on at night. Steam steering gear, a repairing shop, a\r\n  three-ton crane, and all the latest appliances are installed on board.\r\n\r\n  The \"Dérocheuse\" (Plate II. fig. 12), constructed by Messrs Lobnitz &\r\n  Co., is a good example of the dredger fitted with their patent rock\r\n  cutters, as used on the Suez Canal. These rock cutters consist of\r\n  stamps passing down through the bottom of the dredger, slightly in\r\n  advance of the bucket chain, and are employed for breaking up rock in\r\n  front of the bucket ladder so that it may be raised by buckets\r\n  afterwards. This system of subaqueous rock cutting plant, on Messrs\r\n  Lobnitz's patent system, was effectively employed in deepening the\r\n  Manchester Ship Canal, and removed a considerable length of rock,\r\n  increasing the depth of water from 26 ft. to 28 ft. at a cost of about\r\n  9d. per cub. yd. A full and illustrated description of this plant, and\r\n  of a similar plant supplied to the Argentine Government, was published\r\n  in _Engineering_ of August 17, 1906. An illustration of a bucket of 54\r\n  cub. ft. capacity constructed by Messrs Lobnitz & Co. is given (Plate\r\n  II fig. 11), from which some idea of the size of dredging machinery as\r\n  developed in recent practice may be obtained. In regard to the depth\r\n  of water that can be obtained by dredging, it is interesting to note\r\n  that the dredger \"Diver,\" constructed by Messrs. Hunter & English for\r\n  Mr Samuel Williams of London, is capable of working in 60 ft. of\r\n  water. In this vessel an ingenious arrangement was devised by Mr\r\n  Williams, by which part of the weight of the dredger was balanced\r\n  while the ladder itself could be drawn up through the bucket well and\r\n  placed upon the deck, enabling a long ladder to be used for a\r\n  comparatively short vessel. The \"Tilbury\" dredger, also constructed by\r\n  Messrs Hunter & English, was able to dredge to a depth of 45 ft. below\r\n  the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n_Hopper Barges._--To receive the materials excavated by barge-loading\r\ndredgers, steam hopper barges are now generally employed, capable of\r\ncarrying 500 tons or more of excavation and of steaming loaded at a\r\nspeed of about 9 m. per hour. These hopper barges are made with hinged\r\nflaps in their bottoms, which can be opened when the place of deposit is\r\nreached and the dredgings easily and quickly discharged.\r\n\r\nGood examples of these vessels are the two steam hopper barges built for\r\nthe Conservators of the river Thames in 1898. The dimensions are: length\r\n190 ft., breadth 30 ft., depth 13 ft. 3 in., hopper capacity 900 tons.\r\nThey are propelled by a set of triple expansion engines of 1200 i.h.p.,\r\nwith two return-tube boilers having a working pressure of 160 lb.\r\nSpecial appliances are provided to work the hopper doors by steam power\r\nfrom independent engines placed at the forward end of the hopper. A\r\nsteam windlass is fixed forward and a steam capstan aft. The vessels are\r\nfitted with cabins for the officers and crew. On their trial trip, the\r\nhoppers having their full load, a speed of 11 knots was obtained, the\r\ncoal consumption being 1.44 lb. per i.h.p.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Dredging._--In river dredging two systems are pursued. One\r\nplan consists in excavating a series of longitudinal furrows parallel to\r\nthe axis of the stream; the other in dredging cross furrows from side to\r\nside of the river. It is found that inequalities are left between the\r\nlongitudinal furrows when that system is practised, which do not occur,\r\nto the same extent, in side or cross dredging; and cross dredging leaves\r\na more uniform bottom. In either case the dredger is moored from the\r\nhead and stern by chains about 250 fathoms in length. These chains in\r\nimproved dredgers are wound round windlasses worked by the engine, so\r\nthat the vessel can be moved ahead or astern by simply throwing them\r\ninto or out of gear. In longitudinal dredging the vessel is worked\r\nforward by the head chain, while the buckets are at the same time\r\nperforming the excavation, so that a longitudinal trench is made in the\r\nbottom of the river. After proceeding a certain length, the dredger is\r\nstopped and permitted to drop down and commence a new longitudinal\r\nfurrow, parallel to the first one. In cross dredging, on the other hand,\r\nthe vessel is supplied with four additional moorings, two on each side,\r\nand these chains are, like the head and stern chains, wound round\r\nbarrels worked by steam power. In cross dredging we may suppose the\r\nvessel to be moored at one side of the channel to be excavated. The\r\nbucket frame is set in motion, but instead of the dredger being drawn\r\nforward by the head chain, she is drawn across the river by the\r\nstarboard chains, and, having reached the extent of her work in that\r\ndirection, she is then drawn a few feet forward by the head chain, and\r\nthe bucket frame being still in motion the vessel is hauled across by\r\nthe port chains to the side whence she started. By means of this\r\ntransverse motion of the dredger a series of cross cuts is made; the\r\ndredger takes out the whole excavation from side to side to a uniform\r\ndepth and leaves no protuberances such as are found to exist between the\r\nfurrows in longitudinal dredging, even when it is executed with great\r\ncare. The two systems will be understood by reference to fig. 1, where A\r\nand B are the head and stern moorings, and C, D, E and F the side\r\nmoorings. The arc e f represents the course of the vessel in cross\r\ndredging; while in longitudinal dredging, as already explained, she is\r\ndrawn forward towards A, and again dropped down to commence a new\r\nlongitudinal furrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Diagram showing Moorings for Transverse\r\nDredging.]\r\n\r\n_Hopper Dredgers._--In places where barge-loading dredgers are\r\ninconvenient, owing to confined space and interference with navigation,\r\nand where it is necessary to curtail capital expenditure, hopper\r\ndredgers are convenient and economical. These dredgers were first\r\nconstructed by Messrs. Wm. Simons & Co. of Renfrew, who patented and\r\nconstructed what they call the \"Hopper Dredger,\" combining in itself the\r\nadvantages of a dredger for raising material and a scow hopper vessel\r\nfor conveying it to the place of discharge, both of which services are\r\nperformed by the same engines and the same crew.\r\n\r\nThe vessel for this type of dredger is made of sufficient length and\r\nfloating capacity to contain its own dredgings, which it carries out to\r\nthe depositing ground as soon as its hopper is full. Considerable time\r\nis of course occupied in slipping and recovering moorings, and conveying\r\nmaterial to the depositing ground, but these disadvantages are in many\r\ninstances counterbalanced by the fact that less capital is required for\r\nplant and that less room is taken up by the dredger. If the depositing\r\nground is far away, the time available for dredging is much curtailed,\r\nbut the four-screw hopper dredger constructed by Messrs Wm. Simons & Co.\r\nfor Bristol has done good work at the cost of 5d. per ton, including\r\nwages, repairs, coals, grease, sundries and interest on the first cost\r\nof the plant, notwithstanding that the material has to be taken 10 m.\r\nfrom the Bristol Dock. She can lift 400 tons of stiff clay per hour from\r\na depth of 36 ft. below the water line, and the power required varies\r\nfrom 120 i.h.p. to 150 i.h.p., according to the nature of the material.\r\nThe speed is 9 knots, and 4 propellers are provided, two at the head and\r\ntwo at the stern, to enable the vessel to steam equally well either way,\r\nas the river Avon is too narrow to permit her to be turned round.\r\n\r\n  The hopper dredger \"La Puissante\" (Plate I. fig. 4), constructed by\r\n  Messrs Wm. Simons & Co. for the Suez Canal Co. for the improvement of\r\n  Port Said Roads, is a fine example of this class of dredger. She is\r\n  275 ft. long by 47 ft. beam by 19 ft. deep. The hopper capacity is\r\n  2000 tons, and the draught loaded 16 ft. 5 in. The maximum dredging\r\n  depth is 40 ft., and the minimum dredging depth is only limited by the\r\n  vessel's draught, she being able to cut her own way. The bucket ladder\r\n  works through the well in the stern and weighs with buckets 120 tons.\r\n  The buckets have each a capacity of 30 cub. ft. and raised on trial\r\n  1600 tons per hour. The dredger is propelled by two sets of\r\n  independent triple expansion surface-condensing engines of 1800 i.h.p.\r\n  combined, working with steam at 160 lb. pressure, supplied by two\r\n  mild steel multitubular boilers. Each set of engines is capable of\r\n  driving the buckets independently at speeds of 16 and 20 buckets per\r\n  minute. The bucket ladder is fitted with buffer springs at its upper\r\n  end to lessen the shock when working in a seaway. The dredger can\r\n  deliver the dredged material either into its own hopper or into barges\r\n  lying on either side. The vessel obtained a speed of 9¾ knots per hour\r\n  on trial. The coal consumption during 6 hours' steaming trial was 1.66\r\n  lb. per i.h.p. hour. Fig. 9 (Plate I.) shows a still larger hopper\r\n  dredger by the same constructors.\r\n\r\n_Dredgers fitted with Long Shoot or Shore Delivering Apparatus._--The\r\nfirst instance of dredgers being fitted with long shoots was in the Suez\r\nCanal. The soil in the lakes was very variable, the surface being\r\ngenerally loose mud which lay in some places in the sand, but frequently\r\nmore or less on hard clay. Resort was had to shoots 230 ft. long,\r\nsupported on pontoons connected with the hull of the dredger. The sand\r\nflowed away with a moderate supply of water to the shoots when they were\r\nfixed at an inclination of about 1 in 20, but when the sand was mixed\r\nwith shells these formed a coating which prevented the stream of water\r\nfrom washing out the shoot, and even with an inclination of 1 in 10\r\nmaterial could not be delivered. A pair of endless chains working down\r\nthe long shoot overcame the difficulty, and also enabled hard clay in\r\nlumps to be dealt with. One dredger turned out about 2000 cub. yds. of\r\nthick clay in 15 hours, and when the clay was not hard it could deliver\r\n150,000 cub. yds. in a month for several consecutive months.\r\n\r\nShore delivery has been successfully effected by raising the material by\r\nbuckets in the ordinary way and delivering it into a vertical cylinder\r\nconnected with floating jointed pipes through which the dredgings pass\r\nto the shore. This, of course, can only be done where the place of\r\ndeposit is near the spot where the material is dredged. Two plans have\r\nbeen satisfactorily employed for this operation. At the Amsterdam Canal\r\nthe stuff was discharged from the buckets into a vertical cylinder, and\r\nafter being mingled with water by a revolving Woodford pump was sent off\r\nunder a head of pressure of 4 or 5 ft. to the place of deposit in a\r\nsemi-fluid state through pipes made of timber, hooped with iron. These\r\nwooden pipes were made in lengths of about 15 ft., connected with\r\nleather joints, and floated on the surface of the water. A somewhat\r\nsimilar process was also employed on the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\n  A dredger (Plate I. fig. 5), constructed by Messrs Hunter & English\r\n  for reclamation works on Lake Copais in Greece was fitted with\r\n  delivery belts running on rollers in steel lattice frames on each side\r\n  of the vessel supported by masts and ropes. It could deliver 100 cub.\r\n  metres per hour at 85 ft. from the centre of the dredger, at a cost of\r\n  1.82d. per cub. metre for working expenses, with coal at 45s. per ton,\r\n  including 0.66d. per cub. metre for renewal of belts, upon which the\r\n  wear and tear was heavy.\r\n\r\n  Another instance of the successful application of shore delivery\r\n  apparatus is that of a dredger for Lake Titicaca, Peru, constructed by\r\n  Messrs Hunter & English, which was fitted with long shoots on both\r\n  sides, conveying the dredged material about 100 ft. from the centre of\r\n  the dredger upon either side. The shoots were supported by shear-legs\r\n  and ropes, and were supplied with water from a centrifugal pump in the\r\n  engine room. This dredger could excavate and deliver 120 cub. yds. per\r\n  hour at a cost of 1.725d. per cub. yd. with coal costing 40s. per ton.\r\n  If coal had been available at the ordinary rate in England of 20s. per\r\n  ton, the cost of the dredging and delivery would have been 0.82d. per\r\n  cub. yd. for wages, coal, oil, &c., but not including the salary of\r\n  the superintendent.\r\n\r\n  An interesting example of a shore delivering dredger is a light\r\n  draught dredger constructed by Messrs Hunter & English for the Lakes\r\n  of Albufera at the mouth of the river Ebro in Spain (Plate I. fig. 6).\r\n  The conditions laid down for this dredger were that it should float in\r\n  18 in. of water and deliver the dredged material at 90 ft. from the\r\n  centre of its own hull. In order to meet these requirements the vessel\r\n  was made of steel plates 1/8 in. thick, and longitudinal girders from\r\n  end to end of the vessel, the upward strain of flotation being\r\n  conveyed to them from the skin plating by transverse bulkheads at\r\n  short intervals. The dredger was 94 ft. long, 25 ft. wide, and 3 ft.\r\n  deep, and the height of the top tumbler above the water was 25 ft.\r\n  When completed the dredger drew 17 in. of water. The dredgings were\r\n  delivered by the buckets upon an endless belt, driven from the main\r\n  compound surface-condensing engine, which ran over pulleys supported\r\n  upon a steel lattice girder, the outer end of which rested upon an\r\n  independent pontoon. This belt delivered the dredgings at 90 ft. from\r\n  the centre of the dredger round an arc of 180°. The dredger delivered\r\n  125 cub. yds. per hour of compact clay at a cost of 1.16d. per cub.\r\n  yd. or 0.86d. per ton for wages, coal and stores. Another method of\r\n  delivering dredgings is that of pneumatic delivery, introduced by Mr\r\n  F. E. Duckham, of the Millwall Dock Co., by which the dredgings are\r\n  delivered into cylindrical tanks in the dredger, closed by air-tight\r\n  doors, and are expelled by compressed air either into the sea or\r\n  through long pipes to the land. The Millwall Dock dredger is 113 ft.\r\n  long, with a beam of 17 ft. and a depth of 12 ft. The draught loaded\r\n  is 8 ft. It contains two cylindrical tanks, having a combined capacity\r\n  of 240 cub. yds., and is fitted with compound engines of about 200\r\n  i.h.p., with a 20 in. air-compressing cylinder. The discharge pipe is\r\n  15 in. diameter by 150 yds. long. The nozzles of the air-injection\r\n  pipes must not be too small, otherwise the compressed air, instead of\r\n  driving out the material, simply pierces holes through it and escapes\r\n  through the discharging pipe, carrying with it all the liquid and thin\r\n  material in the tanks. The cost of working the Millwall Dock dredger\r\n  is given by Mr Duckham at 1.75d. per cub. yd. of mud lifted, conveyed\r\n  and deposited on land 450 ft. from the water-side, for working\r\n  expenses only. This dredger is believed to be the first machine\r\n  constructed with a traversing ladder, as suggested by Captain Gibson\r\n  when dock-master of the Millwall Docks.\r\n\r\n_Blasting combined with Dredging._--In some cases it has been found that\r\nthe bottom is too hard to be dredged until it has been to some extent\r\nloosened and broken up. Thus at Newry, John Rennie, after blasting the\r\nbottom in a depth of from 6 to 8 ft. at low water, removed the material\r\nby dredging at an expense of from 4s. to 5s. per cub. yd. The same\r\nprocess was adopted by Messrs Stevenson at the bar of the Erne at\r\nBallyshannon, where, in a situation exposed to a heavy sea, large\r\nquantities of boulder stones were blasted, and afterwards raised by a\r\ndredger worked by hand at a cost of 10s. 6d. per cub. yd. Sir William\r\nCubitt also largely employed blasting in connexion with dredging on the\r\nSevern (see _Proc. Inst. C.E._ vol. iv. p. 362). The cost of blasting\r\nand dredging the marl beds is given as being 4s. per cub. yd. A\r\ncombination of blasting and dredging was employed in 1875 by John Fowler\r\nof Stockton at the river Tees. The chief novelty was in the barge upon\r\nwhich the machinery was fixed. It was 58 ft. by 28 ft. by 4 ft., and had\r\neight legs which were let down when the barge was in position. The legs\r\nwere then fixed to the barge, so that on the tide falling it became a\r\nfixed platform from which the drilling was done. Holes were bored and\r\ncharged, and when the tide rose the legs were heaved up and the barge\r\nremoved, after which the shots were discharged. There were 24 boring\r\ntubes on the barge, and that was the limit which could at any time be\r\ndone in one tide. The area over which the blasting was done measured 500\r\nyds. in length by 200 in breadth, a small part being uncovered at low\r\nwater. The depth obtained in mid-channel was 14 ft. at low water, the\r\naverage depth of rock blasted being about 4 ft. 6 in. The holes, which\r\nwere bored with the diamond drill, varied in depth from 7 to 9 ft., the\r\ndistance between them being 10 ft. Dynamite in tin canisters fired by\r\npatent fuse was used as the explosive, the charges being 2 lb. and\r\nunder. The rock is oolite shale of variable hardness, and the average\r\ntime occupied in drilling holes 5 ft. deep was 12 minutes. The dredger\r\nraised the blasted rock. The cost for blasting, lifting and discharging\r\nat sea was about 4s. per cub. yd., including interest on dredging and\r\nother plant employed. The dredger sometimes worked a face of blasted\r\nmaterial of from 7 to 8 ft. The quantity blasted was 110,000 cub. yds.,\r\nand the contract for blasting so as to be lifted by the dredger was 3s.\r\n1d. per cub. yd. A similar plan was adopted at Blyth Harbour (see _Proc.\r\nInst. C.E._ vol. 81, p. 302). The cost of the explosives per cub. yd.\r\nwas 1s. 4d., of boring 1s. 9d. per cub. yd., and of dredging 3s. per\r\ncub. yd., including repairs, but nothing for the use of plant. The whole\r\ncost worked out at 6s. 1d. per cub. yd. on the average.\r\n\r\n_Sand-pump Dredgers._--Perhaps the most important development which has\r\ntaken place in dredging during recent years has been the employment of\r\nsand-pump dredgers, which are very useful for removing sandy bars where\r\nthe particular object is to remove quickly a large quantity of sand or\r\nother soft material. They are, however, apt to make large holes, and are\r\ntherefore not fitted for positions where it is necessary to finish off\r\nthe dredging work to a uniform flat bottom, for which purpose bucket\r\ndredgers are better adapted. Pump dredgers are, however, admirable and\r\neconomical machines for carrying out the work for which they are\r\nspecially suited.\r\n\r\n  In the discussion upon Mr J. J. Webster's paper upon\r\n  \"Dredging-Appliances\" (_Proc. Inst. C.E._ vol. 89) at the Institution\r\n  of Civil Engineers in 1886, Sir John Coode stated that he had first\r\n  seen sand-pump dredgers at the mouth of the Maas in Holland. The\r\n  centrifugal pump was placed against the bulkheads in the after part of\r\n  the vessel, and the sand and water were delivered into a horizontal\r\n  breeches-piece leading into two pipes running along the full length of\r\n  the hopper. The difficulty of preventing the sand from running\r\n  overboard was entirely obviated by its being propelled by the pump\r\n  through these pipes, the bottoms of which were perforated by a series\r\n  of holes. In addition, there were a few small flap-doors fixed at\r\n  intervals, by means of which the men were able to regulate the\r\n  discharge. On being tested, the craft pumped into its hopper 400 tons\r\n  of sand in 22 minutes. The coamings round the well of the hoppers were\r\n  constructed with a dip, and when the hopper was full the water ran\r\n  over in a steady stream on either side. The proportion of sand\r\n  delivered into the hopper was about 20% of the total capacity of the\r\n  pump. The dredger was constructed by Messrs Smit of Kinderdijk, near\r\n  Rotterdam. In the same discussion Mr A. A. Langley, then engineer to\r\n  the Great Eastern railway, gave particulars of a sand pump upon the\r\n  Bazin system, which had been used successfully at Lowestoft. The boat\r\n  was 60 ft. long by 20 ft. wide, and the pump was 2 ft. in diameter,\r\n  with a two-bladed disk. The discharge pipe was 12 in. in diameter. The\r\n  pump raised 400 tons of sand, gravel and stones per hour as a maximum\r\n  quantity, the average quantity being about 200 tons per hour. The\r\n  depth dredged was from 7 ft. to 25 ft. The pump was driven by a\r\n  double-cylinder engine, having cylinders of 9 in. diameter by 10 in.\r\n  stroke, and making 120 revolutions per minute. An important\r\n  improvement was made by fitting the working faces of the pump with\r\n  india-rubber, which was very successful and largely reduced the wear\r\n  and tear. The cost of the dredging at Lowestoft was given by Mr\r\n  Langley at 2d. per ton, including delivery 2 m. out at sea. The\r\n  quantity dredged was about 200,000 tons per annum.\r\n\r\n  One of the earliest pumps to be applied to dredging purposes was the\r\n  Woodford, which consisted of a horizontal disk with two or more arms\r\n  working in a case somewhat similar to the ordinary centrifugal pump.\r\n  The disk was keyed to a vertical shaft which was driven from above by\r\n  means of belts or other gear coupled to an ordinary portable engine.\r\n  The pump within rested on the ground; the suction pipe was so arranged\r\n  that water was drawn in with the sand or mud, the proportions being\r\n  regulated to suit the quality of the material. The discharge pipe was\r\n  rectangular and carried a vertical shaft, the whole apparatus being\r\n  adjustable to suit different depths of water. This arrangement was\r\n  very effective, and has been used on many works. Burt & Freeman's sand\r\n  pump, a modification of the Woodford pump, was used in the\r\n  construction of the Amsterdam Ship Canal, for which it was designed.\r\n  The excavations from the canal had to be deposited on the banks some\r\n  distance away from the dredgers, and after being raised by the\r\n  ordinary bucket dredger, instead of being discharged into the barges,\r\n  they were led into a vertical chamber on the top side of the pump,\r\n  suitable arrangements being made for regulating the delivery. The pump\r\n  was 3½ ft. in diameter, and made about 230 revolutions per minute. The\r\n  water was drawn up on the bottom side and mixed with the descending\r\n  mud on the top side, and the two were discharged into a pipe 15 in. in\r\n  diameter. The discharge pipe was a special feature, and consisted of a\r\n  series of wooden pipes jointed together with leather hinges and\r\n  floated on buoys from the dredger to the bank. In some cases this pipe\r\n  was 300 yds. long, and discharged the material 8 ft. above the water\r\n  level. Each dredger and pump was capable of discharging an average of\r\n  1500 cub. yds. per day of 12 hours. Schmidt's sand pump is claimed to\r\n  be an improvement on the Burt & Freeman pump. It consists of a\r\n  revolving wheel 6 ft. in diameter, with cutters revolving under a hood\r\n  which just allows the water to pass underneath. To the top side of the\r\n  hood a 20 in. suction pipe from an ordinary centrifugal pump is\r\n  attached. The pump is driven by two 16 in. by 20 in. cylinders, at 134\r\n  revolutions per minute, the boiler pressure being 95 lb. per sq. in.\r\n  This apparatus is capable of excavating sticky blue clayey mud, and\r\n  will deliver the material at 500 to 650 yds. distance. The best\r\n  results are obtained when the mixture of mud and water is as 1 to 6.5.\r\n  The average quantity excavated per diem by the apparatus is 1300 cub.\r\n  yds., the maximum quantity being 2500 cub. yds.\r\n\r\n  Kennard's sand pump is entirely different from the pumps already\r\n  described, and is a direct application of the ordinary lift pump. A\r\n  wrought iron box has a suction pipe fitted at the bottom, rising about\r\n  half way up the inside of the box; on the top of the box is fitted the\r\n  actual pump and the flap valves. The apparatus is lowered by chains,\r\n  and the pump lowered from above. As soon as the box is filled with\r\n  sand it is raised, the catches holding up the bottom released, and the\r\n  contents discharged into a punt.\r\n\r\n  Sand-pump dredgers, designed and arranged by Mr Darnton Hutton, were\r\n  extensively used on the Amsterdam Ship Canal. A centrifugal pump with\r\n  a fan 4 ft. in diameter was employed, the suction and delivery pipes,\r\n  each 18 in. in diameter, being attached to an open wrought-iron\r\n  framework. The machine was suspended between guides fixed to the end\r\n  of the vessel, which was fitted with tackle for raising, lowering and\r\n  adjusting the machine. The vessel was fitted with a steam engine and\r\n  boiler for working and manipulating the pumps and the heavy side\r\n  chains for the guidance of the dredger. The engine was 70 h.p., and\r\n  the total cost of one dredger was £8000. The number of hands required\r\n  for working this sand-pump dredger was one captain, one engineer, one\r\n  stoker and four sailors. Each machine was capable of raising about\r\n  1300 tons of material per day, the engines working at 60 and the pump\r\n  at 180 revolutions per minute. The sand was delivered into barges\r\n  alongside the dredger. The cost of raising the material and depositing\r\n  it in barges was about 1d. per ton when the sand pumps were working,\r\n  but upon the year's work the cost was 2.4d. per cub. yd. for working\r\n  expenses and repairs, and 1.24d. per cub. yd. for interest and\r\n  depreciation at 10% upon the cost of the plant, making a total cost\r\n  for dredging of 3.64d. per cub. yd. The cost for transport was 3.588d.\r\n  per cub. yd., making a total cost for dredging and transport of\r\n  7.234d. per cub. yd. Dredging and transport on the same works by an\r\n  ordinary bucket dredger and barges cost 8.328d. per cub. yd.\r\n\r\n  Two of the largest and most successful instances of sand-pump dredgers\r\n  are the \"Brancker\" and the \"G. B. Crow,\" belonging to the Mersey\r\n  Docks and Harbour Board. Mr A. G. Lyster gave particulars of the work\r\n  done by these dredgers in a paper read before the Engineering Congress\r\n  in 1899. They are each 320 ft. long, 47 ft. wide and 20.5 ft. deep,\r\n  the draught loaded being 16 ft. They are fitted with two centrifugal\r\n  pumps, each 6 ft. in diameter, with 36 in. suction and delivery pipes,\r\n  united into a 45 in. diameter pipe, hung by a ball and socket joint in\r\n  a trunnion, so as to work safely in a seaway when the waves are 10 ft.\r\n  high. The suction pipe is 76 ft. long and will dredge in 53 ft. of\r\n  water. The eight hoppers hold 3000 tons, equivalent when solid to 2000\r\n  cub. yds.; they can be filled in three-quarters of an hour and\r\n  discharged in five minutes. Mr Lyster stated that up to May 1899, the\r\n  quantity removed from bar and main-channel shoals amounted to\r\n  41,240,360 tons, giving a width of channel of 1500 ft. through the\r\n  bar, with a minimum depth of 27 ft. The cost of dredging on the bar by\r\n  the \"G. B. Crow\" during 1898, when 4,309,350 tons of material were\r\n  removed, was 0.61d. per ton for wages, supplies and repairs. These\r\n  figures include all direct working costs and a proportion of the\r\n  charge for actual superintendence, but no allowance for interest on\r\n  capital cost or depreciation. On an average, 20% of the sand and mud\r\n  that are raised escapes over the side of the vessel. Mr Lyster has,\r\n  however, to a considerable extent overcome this difficulty by a\r\n  special arrangement added to the hoppers (see _Proc. Inst. C.E._ vol.\r\n  188).\r\n\r\n  At the Engineering Conference, 1907, Mr Lyster read a note in which he\r\n  stated that the total quantity of material removed from the bar of the\r\n  Mersey, from the Crosby channel, and from other points of the main\r\n  channel by the \"G. B. Crow\" and \"Brancker\" suction dredgers amounted\r\n  to 108,675,570 tons up to the 1st of May 1907. \"In the note of 1899\r\n  (he added) it was pointed out that the Mersey was a striking instance\r\n  of the improvement of a river by dredging rather than by permanent\r\n  works, and the economy of the system as well as the advantage which\r\n  its elasticity and adaptability to varying circumstances permit, was\r\n  pointed out.... The most recent experience, which has resulted in the\r\n  adoption of the proposal to revet the Taylor's bank, indicates that\r\n  the dredging method has its limitations and cannot provide for every\r\n  contingency which is likely to arise; at the same time, the utility\r\n  and economy of the dredging system is in no way diminished.... Having\r\n  regard to the ever-increasing size of vessels, a scheme for new docks\r\n  and entrances on a very large scale received the authority of\r\n  parliament during the session of 1905-1906 In this scheme it was\r\n  considered necessary to make provision for vessels of 1000 ft. in\r\n  length and 40 ft. in draught, and having regard to this prospective\r\n  growth of vessels it has been determined still further to deepen and\r\n  improve the outer channel of the Mersey. No fixed measure of\r\n  improvement has been decided on, but after careful survey of existing\r\n  conditions and a comparison with probable requirements, it has been\r\n  determined to construct a dredger of 10,000 tons capacity, provided\r\n  with pumping power equivalent to about three times that of any\r\n  existing dredgers. By the use of this vessel it is anticipated that it\r\n  will be possible to deal with very much larger quantities of sand at a\r\n  cheaper rate, and to 10 ft. greater depth than the existing plant\r\n  permits.\"\r\n\r\n  The vessel in question was launched on the Mersey from the yard of\r\n  Messrs Cammell, Laird & Co. in October 1908, and was named the\r\n  \"Leviathan.\" Her length is 487 ft., beam 69 ft., and depth 30 ft. 7\r\n  in. Her dredging machinery consists of four centrifugal pumps driven\r\n  by four sets of inverted triple expansion engines, and connected to\r\n  four suction tubes 90 ft. long and 42 in. in internal diameter. Her\r\n  propelling machinery, consisting of two sets of triple expansion\r\n  engines, is capable of driving her at a speed of 10 knots.\r\n\r\n  Another powerful and successful sand-pump dredger, \"Kate\" (Plate I.\r\n  fig. 7), was built in 1897 by Messrs Wm. Simons & Co. Ltd. for the\r\n  East London Harbour Board, South Africa. Its dimensions are: length\r\n  200 ft., breadth 39 ft., depth 14 ft. 6 in., hopper capacity 1000\r\n  tons. The pumping arrangements for filling the hopper with sand or\r\n  discharging overboard consist of two centrifugal pumps, each driven\r\n  from one of the propelling engines. The suction pipes are each 27 in.\r\n  in diameter, and are so arranged that they may be used for pumping\r\n  either forward or aft, as the state of the weather may require. Four\r\n  steam cranes are provided for manipulating the suction pipes. Owing to\r\n  the exceptional weather with which the vessel had to contend, special\r\n  precautions were taken in designing the attachments of the suction\r\n  pipes to the vessel. The attachment is above deck and consists of a\r\n  series of joints, which give a perfectly free and universal movement\r\n  to the upper ends of the pipes. The joints, on each side of the\r\n  vessel, are attached to a carriage, which is traversed laterally by\r\n  hydraulic gear. By this means the pipes are pushed out well clear of\r\n  the vessel's sides when pumping, and brought inboard when not in work.\r\n  Hydraulic cushioning cylinders are provided to give any required\r\n  resistance to the fore and aft movements of the pipes. When the vessel\r\n  arrived at East London on the 18th of July 1897, there was a depth of\r\n  14 ft. on the bar at high tide. On the 10th of October, scarcely three\r\n  months afterwards, there was a depth of 20 ft. on the bar at low\r\n  water. Working 22 days in rough weather during the month of November\r\n  1898, the \"Kate\" raised and deposited 2½ m. at sea 60,000 tons of\r\n  dredgings. Her best day's work (12 hours) was on the 7th of November,\r\n  when she dredged and deposited 6440 tons.\r\n\r\n  A large quantity of sand-pump dredging has been carried out at\r\n  Boulogne and Calais by steam hopper pump dredgers, workable when the\r\n  head waves are not more than 3 ft. high and the cross waves not more\r\n  than 1½ ft. high. The dredgings are taken 2 m. to sea, and the price\r\n  for dredging and depositing from 800,000 to 900,000 cub. metres in 5\r\n  or 6 years was 7.25d. per cub. yd. The contractor offered to do the\r\n  work at 4.625d. per cub. yd. on condition of being allowed to work\r\n  either at Calais or Boulogne, as the weather might permit. Sand-pump\r\n  dredging has also been extensively carried out at the mouth of the\r\n  ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and on the north coast of France by sand\r\n  dredgers constructed by Messrs L. Smit & Son and G. & K. Smit. The\r\n  largest dredger, the \"Amsterdam,\" is 141 ft. by 27 ft. by 10 ft. 8\r\n  in., and has engines of 190 i.h.p. The hopper capacity is 10,600 cub.\r\n  ft., and the vessel can carry 600 tons of dredgings. The pump fan is 6\r\n  ft. 3 in. in diameter by 10 in. wide, the plates being of wrought\r\n  iron, and makes 130 revolutions a minute. The pump can raise 230 cub.\r\n  ft. a minute from a depth of 33 ft., which, taking the proportion of 1\r\n  of sand to 7 of water, gives a delivery of 29 cub. ft. of sand per\r\n  minute. The hopper containing 10,600 cub. ft. was under favourable\r\n  circumstances filled in 40 minutes. The vessels are excellent sea\r\n  boats.\r\n\r\n_Combined Bucket-Ladder and Sand-Pump Dredgers._--Bucket ladders and\r\nsand pumps have also been fitted to the same dredger. A successful\r\nexample of this practice is furnished by the hopper dredger \"Percy\r\nSanderson\" (Plate I. fig. 8), constructed under the direction of Sir C.\r\nA. Hartley, engineer of the Danube Commission for the deepening of the\r\nriver Danube and the Sulina bar. This dredger is 220 ft. by 40 ft. by 17\r\nft. 2 in., and has a hopper capacity for 1250 tons of dredgings. The\r\nbuckets have each a capacity of 25 cub. ft., and are able to raise 1000\r\ntons of ordinary material per hour. The suction pump, which is driven by\r\nan independent set of triple expansion engines, is capable of raising\r\n700 tons of sand per hour, and of dredging to a depth of 35 ft. below\r\nthe water-line. The lower end of the suction pipe is controlled by\r\nspecial steam appliances by which the pipe can be brought entirely\r\ninboard. The \"Percy Sanderson\" raises and deposits on an average 5000\r\ntons of material per day.\r\n\r\n_Grab Dredgers._--The grab dredger was stated by Sir Benjamin Baker\r\n(_Proc. Inst. C.E._ vol. 113, p. 38) to have been invented by Gouffé in\r\n1703, and was worked by two ropes and a bar. Various kinds of apparatus\r\nhave been designed in the shape of grabs or buckets for dredging\r\npurposes. These are usually worked by a steam crane, which lets the open\r\ngrab down to the surface of the ground to be excavated and then closes\r\nit by a chain which forces the tines into the ground; the grab is then\r\nraised by the crane, which deposits the contents either into the hopper\r\nof the vessel upon which the crane is fixed or into another barge.\r\n\r\n  The Priestman grab has perhaps been more extensively used than any\r\n  other apparatus of this sort. It is very useful for excavating mud,\r\n  gravel and soft sand, but is less effective with hard sand or stiff\r\n  clay--a general defect in this class of dredger. It is also capable of\r\n  lifting large loose pieces of rock weighing from 1 to 2 tons. A\r\n  dredger of this type, with grab holding 1 ton of mud, dredged during\r\n  six days, in 19 ft. of water, an average of 52½ tons and a maximum of\r\n  68½ tons per hour, and during 12 days, in 16 ft. of water, an average\r\n  of 48 tons and a maximum of 58 tons per hour, at a cost of 1.63d. per\r\n  ton, excluding interest on the capital and depreciation. The largest\r\n  dredger to which this apparatus has been applied is the grab bucket\r\n  hopper dredger \"Miles K. Burton\" (Plate I. fig. 9), belonging to the\r\n  Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. It is equipped with 5 grabs on\r\n  Morgan's patent system, which is a modification of Priestman's, the\r\n  grabs being worked by 5 hydraulic cranes. It raised and deposited, 12\r\n  to 15 m. at sea, 11 loads of about 1450 tons each with a double shift\r\n  of hands, at a cost of about 1s. 5d. per cub. yd. of spoil, including\r\n  the working expenses for wages of crew, fuel and stores. Mr R. A.\r\n  Marillier of Hull has stated that \"the efficiency of these grabs is\r\n  not at all dependent upon the force of the blow in falling for the\r\n  penetration and grip in the material, as they do their work very\r\n  satisfactorily even when lowered quite gently on to the material to be\r\n  cut out, the jaws being so framed as to draw down and penetrate the\r\n  material as soon as the upward strain is put on the lifting chain.\r\n  Even in hard material the jaws penetrate so thoroughly as to cause the\r\n  bucket to be well filled. The grab is found to work successfully in\r\n  excavating hard clay from its natural bed on dry land.\" It is claimed\r\n  on behalf of grabs that they lift a smaller proportion of water than\r\n  any other class of dredger.\r\n\r\n  Since the beginning of the 20th century considerable advance has been\r\n  made in the use of Priestman grabs, not only for dredging and\r\n  excavating (for which work they were originally designed), but also in\r\n  discharging bulk cargo. The first quadruple dredger used by the\r\n  Liverpool Docks Board had grabs of a capacity of 30 cub. ft., but\r\n  subsequently second and third quadruple dredgers were put to work in\r\n  the Liverpool Docks, with grabs having a capacity of 70 and 100 cub.\r\n  ft. respectively. In discharging coal at Southampton, Havre, Erith,\r\n  as well as at the coaling station at Purfleet on the Thames, grabs\r\n  having a capacity of about 80 cub. ft. are in constant use. Perhaps\r\n  the most difficult kind of bulk cargo to lift is \"Narvick\" iron ore,\r\n  which sets into a semi-solid body in the holds of the vessels, and for\r\n  this purpose one of the largest grabs, having about 150 cub. ft.\r\n  capacity and weighing about 8 tons, has been adopted. This grab was\r\n  designed as a result of experiments extending over a long period in\r\n  lifting iron ore. It is fitted with long, forged, interlocked steel\r\n  teeth for penetrating the compact material, which is very costly to\r\n  remove by hand labour. The Priestman grab is made to work with either\r\n  one or two chains or wire ropes. Grabs worked with two chains or ropes\r\n  have many advantages, and are therefore adopted for large\r\n  undertakings.\r\n\r\n  Wild's single chain half-tine grab works entirely with a single chain,\r\n  and has been found very useful in excavating the cylinders in Castries\r\n  harbour. Upon experimenting with an ordinary grab a rather curious\r\n  condition of things was observed with respect to sinking. On\r\n  penetrating the soil to a certain depth the ground was found as it\r\n  were nested, and nothing would induce the grab to sink lower. Sir W.\r\n  Matthews suggested that a further set of external tines might possibly\r\n  get over this difficulty. A new grab having been made with this\r\n  modification, and also with a large increase of weight--all the parts\r\n  being of steel--it descended to any required depth with ease, the\r\n  outside tines loosening the ground effectually whilst the inside\r\n  bucket or tines picked up the material.\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous Appliances._--There are several machines or appliances\r\nwhich perhaps can hardly be called dredgers, although they are used for\r\ncleansing and deepening rivers and harbours.\r\n\r\n  Kingfoot's dredger, used for cleansing the river Stour, consisted of a\r\n  boat with a broad rake fitted to the bow, capable of adjustment to\r\n  different depths. At the sides of the boat were hinged two wings of\r\n  the same depth as the rake and in a line with it. When the rake was\r\n  dropped to the bottom of the river and the wings extended to the side,\r\n  they formed a sort of temporary dam, and the water began to rise\r\n  gradually. As soon as a sufficient head was raised, varying from 6 to\r\n  12 in., the whole machine was driven forward by the pressure, and the\r\n  rake carried the mud with it. Progress at the rate of about 3 m. an\r\n  hour was made in this manner, and to prevent the accumulation of the\r\n  dredgings, operations were begun at the mouth of the river and carried\r\n  on backwards. The apparatus was very effective and the river was\r\n  cleansed thoroughly, but the distance travelled by the dredger must\r\n  have been great.\r\n\r\n  In 1876 J. J. Rietschoten designed a \"propeller dredger\" for removing\r\n  the shoals of the river Maas. It consisted of an old gunboat fitted\r\n  with a pair of trussed beams, one at each side, each of which carried\r\n  a steel shaft and was capable of being lowered or raised by means of a\r\n  crab. An ordinary propeller 3 ft. 6 in. in diameter was fixed to the\r\n  lower end of the shaft, and driven by bevel gear from a cross shaft\r\n  which derived its motion by belting from the fly-wheel of a 12 h.p.\r\n  portable engine. The propellers were lowered until they nearly reached\r\n  the shoals, and were then worked at 150 revolutions per minute. This\r\n  operation scoured away the shoal effectively, for in about 40 minutes\r\n  it had been lowered about 3 ft. for a space of 150 yds. long by 8 yds.\r\n  wide.\r\n\r\n  A. Lavalley in 1877 designed an arrangement for the harbour of Dunkirk\r\n  to overcome the difficulty of working an ordinary bucket-ladder\r\n  dredger when there is even a small swell. A pump injects water into\r\n  the sand down a pipe terminating in three nozzles to stir up the sand,\r\n  and another centrifugal pump draws up the mixed sand and water and\r\n  discharges it into a hopper, the pumps and all machinery being on\r\n  board the hopper. To allow for the rising and falling of the\r\n  vessel--either by the action of the tide or by the swell--the ends of\r\n  the pipes are made flexible. The hopper has a capacity of 190 cub.\r\n  yds., and is propelled and the pumps worked by an engine of 150 i.h.p.\r\n  From 50 to 80 cub. yds. per hour can be raised by this dredger.\r\n\r\n  The \"Aquamotrice,\" designed by Popie, and used on the Garonne at Agen,\r\n  appears to be a modification of the old bag and spoon arrangement. A\r\n  flat-bottomed boat 51½ ft. long by 6½ ft. wide was fitted at the bow\r\n  with paddles, which were actuated by the tide. Connected with the\r\n  paddles was a long chain, passing over a pulley on uprights and under\r\n  a roller, and a beam was attached to the chain 14 ft. 8 in. long,\r\n  passing through a hole in the deck. At the end of the beam was an iron\r\n  scoop 2 ft. wide and 2 ft. 6 in. deep. When the tide was strong enough\r\n  it drew the scoop along by means of the paddles and chains, and the\r\n  scoop when filled was opened by a lever and discharged. About 65 cub.\r\n  yds. of gravel could be raised by the apparatus in 12 hours. When the\r\n  tide failed the apparatus was worked by men.\r\n\r\n  The Danube Steam Navigation Co. removed the shingle in the shallow\r\n  parts of the river by means of a triangular rake with wrought-iron\r\n  sides 18 ft. long, and fitted with 34 teeth of chilled cast iron 12\r\n  in. deep. This rake was hung from the bow of a steamer 180 ft. long by\r\n  21 ft. beam, and dragged across the shallows, increasing the depth of\r\n  water in one instance from 5 ft. 6 in. to 9 ft., after passing over\r\n  the bank 355 times.\r\n\r\n  A combination of a harrow and high pressure water jets, arranged by B.\r\n  Tydeman, was found very efficacious in removing a large quantity of\r\n  mud which accumulated in the Tilbury Dock basin, which has an area of\r\n  about 17 acres, with a depth of 26 ft. at low-water spring tides. In\r\n  the first instance chain harrows merely were used, but the addition of\r\n  the water jets added materially to the success of the operation. The\r\n  system accomplished in six tides more than was done in twelve tides\r\n  without the water jets which worked at about 80 lb pressure per sq.\r\n  in. at the bottom of the dock.\r\n\r\n  Ive's excavator consists of a long weighted spear, with a sort of\r\n  spade at the end of it. The spade is hinged at the top, and is capable\r\n  of being turned at right angles to the spear by a chain attached to\r\n  the end of the spear. The spade is driven into the ground, and after\r\n  releasing the catch which holds it in position during its descent, it\r\n  is drawn up at right angles to the spear by the chain, carrying the\r\n  material with it. Milroy's excavator is similar, but instead of having\r\n  only one spade it generally has eight, united to the periphery of an\r\n  octagonal iron frame fixed to a central vertical rod. When these eight\r\n  spades are drawn up by means of chains, they form one flat table or\r\n  tray at right angles to the central rod. In operation the spades hang\r\n  vertically, and are dropped into the material to be excavated; the\r\n  chains are then drawn up, and the table thus formed holds the material\r\n  on the top, which is lifted and discharged by releasing the spade.\r\n  This apparatus has been extensively used both in Great Britain and in\r\n  India for excavating in bridge cylinders.\r\n\r\n  The clam shell dredger consists of two hinged buckets, which when\r\n  closed form one semi-cylindrical bucket. The buckets are held open by\r\n  chains attached to the top of a cross-head, and the machine is dropped\r\n  on to the top of the material to be dredged. The chains holding the\r\n  bucket open are then released, while the spears are held firmly in\r\n  position, the buckets being closed by another chain. Bull's dredger,\r\n  Gatmell's excavator, and Fouracre's dredger are modifications with\r\n  improvements of the clam shell dredger, and have all been used\r\n  successfully upon various works.\r\n\r\n  Bruce & Batho's dredger, when closed, is of hemispherical form, the\r\n  bucket being composed of three or four blades. It can be worked by\r\n  either a single chain or by means of a spear, the latter being\r\n  generally used for stiff material. The advantage of this form of\r\n  dredger bucket is that the steel points of the blades are well adapted\r\n  for penetrating hard material. Messrs Bruce & Batho also designed a\r\n  dredger consisting of one of these buckets, but worked entirely by\r\n  hydraulic power. This was made for working on the Tyne. The excavator\r\n  or dredger is fixed to the end of a beam which is actuated by two\r\n  hydraulic cylinders, one being used for raising the bucket and the\r\n  other for lowering it; the hydraulic power is supplied by the pumps in\r\n  the engine-room. The novelty in the design is the ingenious way in\r\n  which the lever in ascending draws the shoot under the bucket to\r\n  receive its contents, and draws away again as the bucket descends. The\r\n  hydraulic cylinder at the end of the beam is carried on gimbals to\r\n  allow for irregularities on the surface being dredged. The hydraulic\r\n  pressure is 700 lb. per sq. in., and the pumps are used in connexion\r\n  with a steam accumulator.\r\n\r\n  An unloading apparatus was designed by Mr A. Manning for the East &\r\n  West India Dock Co. for unloading the dredged materials out of barges\r\n  and delivering it on the marsh at the back of the bank of the river\r\n  Thames at Crossness, Kent. A stage constructed of wooden piles\r\n  commanded a series of barge beds, and the unloading dredger running\r\n  from end to end of the stage, lifted and delivered the materials on\r\n  the marsh behind the river wall at the cost of 1 d. per cub. yd.\r\n\r\n_Dredging on the River Scheldt below Antwerp._--This dredging took place\r\nat Krankeloon and the Belgian Sluis under the direction of L. Van\r\nGansberghe. At Melsele there is a pronounced bend in the river, causing\r\na bar at the Pass of Port Philip, and just below the pass of Lillo there\r\nis a cross-over in the current, making a neutral point and forming a\r\nshoal. After dredging to 8 metres (26.24 ft.) below low tide, in clay\r\ncontaining stone and ferruginous matter, a sandstone formation was\r\nencountered, which was very compact and difficult to raise. A suction\r\ndredger being unsuited to the work, a bucket-ladder dredger was\r\nemployed. The dredging was commenced at Krankeloon in September 1894 and\r\ncontinued to the end of 1897. A depth of 6 metres (19.68 ft.) was\r\nexcavated at first, but was afterwards increased to 8 metres (26.24\r\nft.). The place of deposit was at first on lands acquired by the State,\r\n2.17 m. above Krankeloon, and placed at the disposal of the contractor.\r\nThe dredgings excavated by the bucket-ladder dredger were deposited in\r\nscows, which were towed to the front of the deposit ground and\r\ndischarged by a suction pump fixed in a special boat, moored close to\r\nthe bank of the river. The material brought by the suction dredger in\r\nits own hull was discharged by a plant fixed upon the dredger itself. In\r\nboth instances the material was deposited at a distance of 1640 ft. from\r\nthe river, the spoil bank varying in depth from 2 to 7 metres. The water\r\nthrown out behind the dyke with the excavated material returned to the\r\nriver, after settlement, by a special discharge lock built under the\r\ndyke. After 1896 the material was delivered into an abandoned pass by\r\nmeans of barges with bottom hopper doors or by the suction dredger. One\r\nsuction dredger and three bucket-ladder dredgers were employed upon the\r\nwork, and a vessel called \"Scheldt I.\" used for discharging the material\r\nfrom the scows. Four tugboats and twenty scows were also employed.\r\n\r\n  The largest dredger, \"Scheldt III.,\" was 147.63 ft. long by 22.96 ft.\r\n  wide by 10.98 ft. deep, and had buckets of 21.18 cub. ft. capacity.\r\n  The output per hour was 10,594 cub. ft. This dredger had also a\r\n  complete installation as a suction dredger, the suction pipe being 2\r\n  ft. diameter. The fan of the centrifugal pump was 5.25 ft. diameter,\r\n  and was driven by the motor of the bucket ladder. The three bucket\r\n  dredgers worked with head to the ebb tide. They could also work with\r\n  head to the flood tide, but it took so long a time to turn them about\r\n  that it was impracticable. The work was for from 13 to 14 hours a day\r\n  on the ebb tide. The effective daily excavation averaged 4839 cub.\r\n  yds. Each dredger was fitted with six anchors. The excavated cut was\r\n  164 ft. wide by 6.56 ft. deep. \"Scheldt III.\" was capable of lifting a\r\n  mass 9.84 ft. thick. The suction dredger \"Scheldt II.\" was of the\r\n  multiple type, and is stated to be unique in construction. It can\r\n  discharge material from a scow alongside, fill its own hopper with\r\n  excavations, discharge its own load upon the bank or into a scow by\r\n  different pipes provided for the purpose, and discharge its own load\r\n  through hopper doors. The machinery is driven by a triple expansion\r\n  engine of 300 i.h.p. working the propeller by a clutch. Owing to the\r\n  rise and fall in the tide of 23 ft. the suction pipe is fitted with\r\n  spherical joints and a telescopic arrangement. The vessel is 157.5 ft.\r\n  by 28.2 ft. by 12.8 ft. The diameter of the pump is 5.25 ft. The wings\r\n  of the pump are curved, the surface being in the form of a cylinder\r\n  parallel to the axis of rotation, the directrix of which is an arc of\r\n  a circle of 2.62 ft. radius with the straight part beyond. The suction\r\n  and discharge pipes are 2 ft. diameter. A centrifugal pump is provided\r\n  for throwing water into the scows to liquefy the material during\r\n  discharge. The dredger, which is fitted with electric lights for work\r\n  at night, is held by two anchors, to prevent lurching backwards and\r\n  forwards; it can work on the flood as well as on the ebb tide, and can\r\n  excavate to a depth of 42.65 ft., the output depending upon the nature\r\n  of the material. With good material it can fill its tanks in thirty\r\n  minutes. To empty the tanks by suction and discharge upon the bank\r\n  over the dyke takes about fifty minutes, depending upon the height and\r\n  distance to which the material requires to be delivered. The daily\r\n  work has averaged eighteen hours, ten trips being made when the\r\n  distance from the dredging ground to the point of delivery is about 1\r\n  m. When the dredged material is discharged into the Scheldt, a\r\n  quantity of 5886 cub. yds. has been raised and deposited in a day, the\r\n  mean quantity being 4700 cub. yds. When the distance of transportation\r\n  is increased to 2½ m., six voyages were made in a day, and the day's\r\n  work amounted to 3530 cub. yds.\r\n\r\n_Gold Dredgers._--Dredgers for excavating from river beds soil\r\ncontaining gold are generally fitted with a screen and elevator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Diagram showing Action of Lobnitz Gold Dredger.]\r\n\r\nThey have been extensively designed and built by Messrs Lobnitz & Co.\r\n(fig. 2) and also by Messrs Hunter & English.\r\n\r\n  The writer is indebted to the _Proceedings_ of the Institution of\r\n  Civil Engineers, and especially to the paper of Mr J.

MARINE BIOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe naturalist's dredge is an instrument consisting essentially of a net\r\nor bag attached to a framework of iron which forms the mouth of the net.\r\nWhen in use as the apparatus is drawn over the sea-bottom mouth\r\nforwards, some part of the framework passes beneath objects which it\r\nmeets and so causes them to enter the net. It is intended for the\r\ncollection of animals and plants living on or near the sea-bottom, or\r\nsometimes of specimens of the sea-bottom itself, for scientific\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the 18th century, naturalists who studied the marine\r\nfauna and flora relied for their materials on shore collection and the\r\nexamination of the catches of fishing boats. Their knowledge of\r\ncreatures living below the level of low spring tides was thus gained\r\nonly from specimens cast up in storms, or caught by fishing gear\r\ndesigned for the capture of certain edible species only. The first\r\neffort made to free marine biology from these limitations was the use of\r\nthe dredge, which was built much on the plan of the oyster dredge.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Otho Frederick Müller's Dredge (1770).]\r\n\r\n  _The Oyster Dredge._--At first naturalists made use of the ordinary\r\n  oyster dredge, which is constructed as follows. The frame is an iron\r\n  triangle, the sides being the round iron \"arms\" of the dredge, the\r\n  base a flat bar called the shere or lip, which is sloped a little, not\r\n  perpendicular to the plane of the triangle; an iron bar parallel to\r\n  the base joins the arms. The net is fastened to the parallel bars and\r\n  the portion of the arms between them, and consists of two parts: that\r\n  attached to the shere is of round iron rings linked together by\r\n  smaller ones of wire lashings, that attached to the upper bar is of\r\n  ordinary network. Where these two portions of the bag meet a wooden\r\n  beam is fastened. In use the frame is towed forward by its apex: the\r\n  shere passes below oysters, &c., which pass back on to the iron\r\n  netting. The length of each side of the triangular frame is about 6\r\n  ft., the width of the shere 3 in. and the height of the mouth just\r\n  under a foot. The rings vary in size, but are usually some 2½ in. in\r\n  diameter. The weight is about 60 lb. This dredge was soon abandoned:\r\n  its weight was prohibitive for small boats, from which the naturalist\r\n  usually worked, its wide rings allowed precious specimens to fall\r\n  through, and its shallow net favoured the washing out of light objects\r\n  on hauling through the moving water of the surface. Moreover, it\r\n  sometimes fell on its back and was then useless, although when the\r\n  apex or towing point was weighted no great skill is needed to avoid\r\n  this.\r\n\r\n  Otho Müller used a dredge (fig. 13) consisting of a net with a square\r\n  iron mouth, each of whose sides was furnished with a thin edge turned\r\n  slightly away from the dredge's centre. As any one of these everted\r\n  lips could act as a scraper it was a matter of indifference which\r\n  struck the bottom when the dredge was lowered. The chief defect of the\r\n  instrument was the ease with which light objects could be washed out\r\n  on hauling, owing to the size of the mouth. However, with this\r\n  instrument Müller obtained from the often stormy Scandinavian seas all\r\n  the material for his celebrated _Zoologia Danica_, a description of\r\n  the marine fauna of Denmark and Norway which was published with\r\n  excellent coloured plates in 1778; and historical interest attaches to\r\n  the dredge as the first made specially for scientific work.\r\n\r\n  _Ball's Dredge._--About 1838 a dredge devised by Dr Ball of Dublin was\r\n  introduced. It has been used all over the world, and is so apt for its\r\n  purpose that it has suffered very little modification during its 70\r\n  years of life. It is known as Ball's dredge or more generally simply\r\n  \"the dredge.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Ball's Naturalist's Dredge.]\r\n\r\n  Ball's dredge (fig. 14) consists of a rectangular net attached to a\r\n  rectangular frame much longer than high, and furnished with rods\r\n  stretching from the four corners to meet at a point where they are\r\n  attached to the dredge rope. It differs from Müller's dredge in the\r\n  slit-like shape of the opening, which prevents much of the \"washing\r\n  out\" suffered by the earlier pattern, and in the edges. The long edges\r\n  only are fashioned as scrapers, being wider and heavier than Müller's,\r\n  especially in later dredges. The short edges are of round iron bar.\r\n\r\n  Like Müller's form, Ball's dredge will act whichever side touches the\r\n  bottom first, as its frame will not remain on its short edge, and\r\n  either of the long edges acts as a scraper. The scraping lips thicken\r\n  gradually from free edge to net; they are set at 110° to the plane of\r\n  the mouth, and in some later patterns curve outwards instead of merely\r\n  sloping. All dredge frames are of wrought iron.\r\n\r\n  The thick inner edges of the scrapers are perforated by round holes at\r\n  distances of about an inch, and through these strong iron rings about\r\n  an inch in diameter are passed, and two or three similar rings run on\r\n  the short rods which form the ends of the dredge-frame. A light iron\r\n  rod, bent to the form of the dredge opening, usually runs through\r\n  these rings, and to this rod and to the rings the mouth of the\r\n  dredge-bag is securely attached by stout cord or strong copper wire.\r\n  Various materials have been used for the bag, the chief of which are\r\n  hide, canvas and netting. The hide was recommended by its strength,\r\n  but it is now abandoned. Canvas bags fill quickly with mud or sand and\r\n  then cease to operate: on the other hand wide mesh net fails to retain\r\n  small specimens. Probably the most suitable material is hand-made\r\n  netting of very strong twine, the meshes half an inch to the side, the\r\n  inter-spaces contracting to a third of an inch across when the twine\r\n  is thoroughly soaked, with an open canvas or \"bread-bag\" lining to the\r\n  last 6 in. of the net. A return to canvas covering has latterly\r\n  occurred in the small dredge called the mud-bag, trailed behind the\r\n  trawl of the \"Albatross\" for obtaining a sample of the bottom, and in\r\n  the conical dredge.\r\n\r\n  The dimensions of the first dredges were as follows: Frame about 12\r\n  in. by about 4 in.; scraping lips about 2 in. wide; all other iron\r\n  parts of round iron bar 5/8 in. diameter; bag rather more than 1 ft.\r\n  long. These small dredges were used from rowing boats. Larger dredges\r\n  were subsequently made for use from yawls or cutters. The mouth of\r\n  these was 18 by 5 in., the scraping lips about 2 in. wide and bag 2\r\n  ft. deep; such a dredge weighs about 20 lb. The dredge of the\r\n  \"Challenger\" had a frame 4 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 3 in. and the bag had a\r\n  length of 4 ft. 6 in.; the \"Porcupine\" used a dredge of the same size\r\n  weighing 225 lb. Doubtless the size of Ball's dredge would have\r\n  grown still more had it not been proved by the \"Challenger\" expedition\r\n  that for many purposes trawls could be used advantageously instead of\r\n  dredges.\r\n\r\n_Operation of the Dredge from Small Vessels._ For work round the coasts\r\nof Europe, at depths attainable from a row-boat or yawl, probably the\r\nbest kind of line is bolt-rope of the best Russian hemp, not less than\r\n1½ in. in circumference, containing 18 to 20 yarns in 3 strands. Each\r\nyarn should be nearly a hundredweight, so that the breaking strain of\r\nsuch a rope ought to be about a ton. Of course it is never voluntarily\r\nexposed to such a strain, but in shallow water the dredge is often\r\ncaught among rocks or coral, and the rope should be strong enough in\r\nsuch a case to bring up the boat, even if there were some little way on.\r\nIt is always well, when dredging, to ascertain the approximate depth\r\nwith the lead before casting the dredge; and the lead ought always to be\r\naccompanied by a registering thermometer, for the subsequent haul of the\r\ndredge will gain greatly in value as an observation in geographical\r\ndistribution, if it be accompanied by an accurate note of the bottom\r\ntemperature. For depths under 100 fathoms the amount of rope paid out\r\nshould be at least double the depth; under 30 fathoms, where one usually\r\nworks more rapidly, it should be more nearly three times; this gives a\r\ngood deal of slack before the dredge if the boat be moving very slowly,\r\nand keeps the lip of the dredge well down. When there is anything of a\r\ncurrent, from whatever cause, it is usually convenient to attach a\r\nweight, varying from 14 lb. to half a hundredweight, to the rope 3 or 4\r\nfathoms in front of the dredge. This prevents in some degree the lifting\r\nof the mouth of the dredge; if the weight be attached nearer the dredge\r\nit is apt to injure delicate objects passing in.\r\n\r\nIn dredging in sand or mud, the dredge-rope may simply be passed through\r\nthe double eye formed by the ends of the two arms of the dredge-frame;\r\nbut in rocky or unknown ground it is better to fasten the rope to the\r\neye of one of the arms only, and to tie the two eyes together with three\r\nor four turns of rope-yarn. This stop breaks much more readily than the\r\ndredge-rope, so that if the dredge get caught it is the first thing to\r\ngive way under the strain, and in doing so it often alters the position\r\nof the dredge so as to allow of its extrication.\r\n\r\nThe dredge is slipped gently over the side, either from the bow or from\r\nthe stern--in a small boat more usually the latter--while there is a\r\nlittle way on, and the direction which the rope takes indicates roughly\r\nwhether the dredge is going down properly. When it reaches the ground\r\nand begins to scrape, an experienced hand upon the rope can usually\r\ndetect at once a tremor given to the dredge by the scraper passing over\r\nthe irregularities of the bottom. The due amount of rope is then paid\r\nout, and the rope hitched to a bench or rowlock-pin. The boat should\r\nmove very slowly, probably not faster than a mile an hour. In still\r\nwater or with a very slight current the dredge of course anchors the\r\nboat, and oars or sails are necessary; but if the boat be moving at all\r\nit is all that is required. It is perhaps most pleasant to dredge with\r\na close-reefed sail before a light wind, with weights, against a very\r\nslight tide or current; but these are conditions which cannot be\r\ncommanded. The dredge may remain down from a quarter of an hour to\r\ntwenty minutes, by which time, if things go well, it ought to be fairly\r\nfilled. In dredging from a small boat the simplest plan is for two or\r\nthree men to haul in, hand over hand, and coil in the bottom of the\r\nboat. For a large yawl or yacht, and for depths over 50 fathoms, a winch\r\nis a great assistance. The rope takes a couple of turns round the winch,\r\nwhich is worked by two men, while a third hand takes it from the winch\r\nand coils it down.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to operate a dredge from a steam vessel than a sailing\r\nboat, but if the steamer is of any size great care should be taken that\r\nthe dredge does not move too rapidly.\r\n\r\nTwo ingenious cases of dredging under unusual conditions are worthy of\r\nmention, one case from shore, one from ice. In the Trondligem Fjord,\r\nCanon A. M. Norman in 1890 worked by hauling the dredge up the\r\nprecipitous shores of the fjord. The dredge was shot from a boat close\r\nto the shore, to which after paying out some hundreds of fathoms of line\r\nit returned. The dredge was then hauled from the top of the cliffs up\r\nwhose side it scraped. Hitches against projecting rocks were frequent\r\nand were overcome by suddenly paying out line for a time. The dredge was\r\nlifted into a boat when it reached the surface of the sea. The other\r\ncase occurred during the Antarctic expedition of the \"Discovery.\"\r\nHodgson dropped loops of line along cracks which occasionally formed in\r\nthe ice. The ice always joined up again, but with the line below it; and\r\na hole being cleared at each place at which the end of the line emerged,\r\nthe dredge could be worked between them.\r\n\r\nThe dredge comes up variously freighted according to the locality, and\r\nthe next step is to examine its contents and to store the objects of\r\nsearch for future use. In a regularly organized dredging expedition a\r\nframe or platform is often erected with a ledge round it to receive the\r\ncontents of the dredge, but it does well enough to capsize it on an old\r\npiece of tarpaulin. There are two ways of emptying the dredge; we may\r\neither turn it up and pour out its contents by the mouth, or we may have\r\na contrivance by which the bottom of the bag is made to unlace. The\r\nfirst plan is the simpler and the one more usually adopted; the second\r\nhas the advantage of letting the mass slide out more smoothly and\r\neasily, but the lacing introduces rather a damaging complication, as it\r\nis apt to loosen or give way. Any objects visible on the surface of the\r\nheap are now carefully removed, and placed for identification in jars or\r\ntubs of sea-water, of which there should be a number secured in some\r\nform of bottle basket, standing ready. The heap should not be much\r\ndisturbed, for the delicate objects contained in it have already been\r\nunavoidably subjected to a good deal of rough usage, and the less\r\nfriction among the stones the better.\r\n\r\n_Examination of the Catch. Sifting._--The sorting of the catch is\r\nfacilitated by sifting. The sieves used in early English expeditions\r\nwere of various sizes and meshes, each sieve having a finer mesh than\r\nthe sieve smaller than itself. In use the whole were put together in the\r\nform of a nest, the smallest one with the coarsest mesh being on top. A\r\nlittle of the dredge's contents were then put in the top sieve, and the\r\nwhole set moved gently up and down in a tub of sea water by handles\r\nattached to the bottom one. Objects of different sizes are thus left in\r\ndifferent sieves. A simple but effective plan is to let the sieves of\r\nvarious sized mesh fit accurately on each other like lids, the coarsest\r\non top, and to pour water upon material placed on the top one. In the\r\nUnited States Bureau of Fisheries ship \"Albatross\" these sieves are\r\nraised to form a table and the water is led on them from a hose: the\r\nvery finest objects or sediments are retained by the waste water\r\nescaping from a catchment tub by muslin bags let into its sides. Any of\r\nthese methods are preferable to sifting by the agitation of a sieve hung\r\nover the side, as in the last anything passing through the sieve is gone\r\npast recall.\r\n\r\n_Preservation of Specimens._--The preservation of specimens will of\r\ncourse depend on the purpose for which they are intended. For\r\nmicroscopic observation formaldehyde has some advantages. It can be\r\nstored in 40% solution and used in 2%, thus saving space, and it\r\npreserves many animals in their colours for a time: formalin\r\npreparations do not, however, last as well as do those in spirit. The\r\nsuitable fluids for various histological inquiries are beyond the scope\r\nof the present article; but for general marine histology Bles' fluid is\r\nuseful, being simple to prepare and not necessitating the removal of the\r\nspecimen to another fluid. It is composed of 70% alcohol 90 parts,\r\nglacial acetic acid 7 parts, 4% formaldehyde 7 parts.\r\n\r\nThe scientific value of a dredging depends mainly upon two things, the\r\ncare with which the objects procured are preserved and labelled for\r\nfuture identification and reference, and the accuracy with which all the\r\ncircumstances of the dredging--the position, the depth, the nature of\r\nthe ground, the date, the bottom-temperature, &c.--are recorded. In the\r\nBritish Marine Biological Association's work in the North Sea, a\r\nseparate sheet of a printed book with carbon paper and duplicate sheets\r\n(which remain always on the ship) is used for the record of the\r\nparticulars of each haul; depth, gear, &c., being filled into spaces\r\nindicated in the form. This use of previously prepared forms has been\r\nfound to be a great saving of time and avoids risk of omission. Whether\r\nlabelled externally or not, all bottles should contain parchment or good\r\npaper labels written with a soft pencil. These cannot be lost. The more\r\nfully details of reference number of station, gear, date, &c., are given\r\nthe better, as should a mistake be made in one particular it can\r\nfrequently be traced and rectified by means of the rest.\r\n\r\n_Growth of Scope of Operations._--At the Birmingham meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in 1839 an important committee was appointed \"for\r\nresearches with the dredge with a view to the investigation of the\r\nmarine zoology of Great Britain, the illustration of the geographical\r\ndistribution of marine animals, and the more accurate determination of\r\nthe fossils of the Pliocene period.\" Of this committee Edward Forbes was\r\nthe ruling spirit, and under the genial influence of his contagious\r\nenthusiasm great progress was made during the next decade in the\r\nknowledge of the fauna of the British seas, and many wonderfully\r\npleasant days were spent by the original committee and by many others\r\nwho from year to year were \"added to their number.\" Every annual report\r\nof the British Association contains communications from the English, the\r\nScottish, or the Irish branches of the committee; and in 1850 Edward\r\nForbes submitted its first general report on British marine zoology.\r\nThis report, as might have been anticipated from the eminent\r\nqualifications of the reporter, was of the highest value; and, taken\r\nalong with his remarkable memoirs previously published, \"On the\r\nDistribution of the Mollusca and Radiata of the Aegean Sea,\" and \"On the\r\nZoological Relations of the existing Fauna and Flora of the British\r\nIsles,\" may be said to mark an era in the progress of human thought.\r\n\r\nThe dredging operations of the British Association committee were\r\ncarried on generally under the idea that at the 100-fathom line, by\r\nwhich amateur work in small boats was practically limited, the zero of\r\nanimal life was approached--a notion which was destined to be gradually\r\nundermined, and finally overthrown. From time to time, however, there\r\nwere not wanting men of great skill and experience to maintain, with Sir\r\nJames Clark Ross, that \"from however great a depth we may be enabled to\r\nbring up mud and stones of the bed of the ocean we shall find them\r\nteeming with animal life.\" Samples of the sea-bottom procured with great\r\ndifficulty and in small quantity from the first deep soundings in the\r\nAtlantic, chiefly by the use of Brooke's sounding machine, an instrument\r\nwhich by a neat contrivance disengaged its weights when it reached the\r\nbottom, and thus allowed a tube, so arranged as to get filled with a\r\nsample of the bottom, to be recovered by the sounding line, were eagerly\r\nexamined by microscopists; and the singular fact was established that\r\nthese samples consisted over a large part of the bed of the Atlantic of\r\nthe entire or broken shells of certain foraminifera. Dr Wallich, the\r\nnaturalist to the \"Bulldog\" sounding expedition under Sir Leopold\r\nM'Clintock, reported that star-fishes, with their stomachs full of the\r\ndeep-sea foraminifera, had come up from a depth of 1200 fathoms on a\r\nsounding line; and doubts began to be entertained whether the bottom of\r\nthe sea was in truth a desert, or whether it might not present a new\r\nzoological region open to investigation and discovery, and peopled by a\r\npeculiar fauna suited to its special conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1867, while the question was still undecided, two testing\r\ninvestigations were undertaken independently. In America Count L. F. de\r\nPourtales (1824-1880), an officer employed in the United States Coast\r\nSurvey under Benjamin Peirce, commenced a series of deep dredgings\r\nacross the Gulf Stream off the coast of Florida, which were continued in\r\nthe following year, and were productive of most valuable results; and in\r\nGreat Britain the Admiralty, on the representation of the Royal Society,\r\nplaced the \"Lightning,\" a small gun-vessel, at the disposal of a small\r\ncommittee to sound and dredge in the North Atlantic between Shetland and\r\nthe Faröe Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Lightning,\" with the help of a donkey-engine for winding in,\r\ndredging was carried on with comparative ease at a depth of 600 fathoms,\r\nand at that depth animal life was found to be still abundant. The\r\nresults of the \"Lightning's\" dredgings were regarded of so great\r\nimportance to science that the Royal Society pressed upon the Admiralty\r\nthe advantage of continuing the researches, and accordingly, during the\r\nyears 1869 and 1870, the gun-boat \"Porcupine\" was put under the orders\r\nof a committee consisting of Dr W. B. Carpenter, Dr Gwyn Jeffreys, and\r\nProfessor (afterwards Sir Charles) Wyville Thomson, one or other of whom\r\nsuperintended the scientific work of a series of dredging trips in the\r\nNorth Atlantic to the north and west of the British Islands, which\r\noccupied two summers.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Porcupine,\" in the summer of 1869, dredging was carried down\r\nsuccessfully to a depth of 2435 fathoms, upwards of two miles and a\r\nhalf, in the Bay of Biscay, and the dredge brought up well-developed\r\nrepresentatives of all the classes of marine invertebrates. During the\r\ncruises of the \"Porcupine\" the fauna of the deep water off the western\r\ncoasts of Great Britain and of Spain and Portugal was tolerably well\r\nascertained, and it was found to differ greatly from the fauna of\r\nshallow water in the same region, to possess very special characters,\r\nand to show a very marked relation to the faunae of the earlier Tertiary\r\nand the later Cretaceous periods.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1872, as a sequel to the preliminary cruises of the\r\n\"Lightning\" and \"Porcupine,\" by far the most considerable expedition in\r\nwhich systematic dredging had ever been made a special object left Great\r\nBritain. H.M.S. \"Challenger,\" a corvette of 2306 tons, with auxiliary\r\nsteam working to 1234 h.p., was despatched to investigate the physical\r\nand biological conditions of the great ocean basins.\r\n\r\nThe \"Challenger\" was provided with a most complete and liberal\r\norganization for the purpose; she had powerful deck engines for hauling\r\nin the dredge, workrooms, laboratories and libraries for investigating\r\nthe results on the spot, and a staff of competent naturalists to\r\nundertake such investigations and to superintend the packing and\r\npreservation of the specimens reserved for future study. Since the\r\n\"Challenger\" expedition the use of wire rope has enabled far smaller\r\nvessels to undertake deep sea work. The \"Challenger,\" however, may be\r\nsaid to have established the practicability of dredging at any known\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n_Operating Dredges and Trawls in deep Seas._--Dredging operations from\r\nlarge vessels in deep seas present numerous difficulties. The great\r\nweight of the ship makes her motion, whether of progress or rolling,\r\nirresistible to the dredge. The latter tends to jump, therefore, which\r\nboth lowers its efficiency and causes it to exert a sudden strain on the\r\ndredge rope.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency or evenness of dredging was secured, therefore, by the\r\nspecial device of fastening a heavy weight some 200 or 300 fathoms from\r\nthe dredge end of the dredge rope. This was either lowered with the\r\ndredge or sent down after by means of a \"messenger,\" a ring of rope\r\nfixed round, but running freely on, the dredge rope. The latter plan was\r\nused on the \"Challenger\"; the weights were six 28 lb. leads in canvas\r\ncovers: their descent was arrested by a toggle or wooden cross-bar\r\npreviously attached to the rope at the desired point. When, however, the\r\nrope used is of wire this front weight is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  The possibility of sudden strain necessitates a constant watching of\r\n  the dredge rope, as the ship's engines may at any moment be needed to\r\n  ease the tension by stopping the vessel's way, and the hauling engines\r\n  by paying out more rope. The use of accumulators both renders the\r\n  strain more gradual and gives warning of an increase or decrease;\r\n  indeed they can be calibrated and used as dynamometers to measure the\r\n  strain. One of the best forms of accumulator consists of a pile of\r\n  perforated rubber disks, which receive the strain and become\r\n  compressed in doing so. The arrangement is in essence as follows. The\r\n  disks form a column resting on a cross-bar or base, from which two\r\n  rods pass up one on each side of the column. Another cross-bar rests\r\n  on the top disk, and from it a rod passes freely down the centre\r\n  perforation of disks and base. Eyes are attached to the lower end of\r\n  this rod and to a yoke connecting the side rods at the top: a pull\r\n  exerted on these eyes is thus modified by the elasticity of the\r\n  dredge. In the \"Porcupine\" and other early expeditions the accumulator\r\n  was hung from the main yard arm, and the block through which the\r\n  dredge rope ran suspended from it. In more recent ships a special\r\n  derrick boom is rigged for this block, and a second accumulator is\r\n  sometimes inserted between the topping lift by which this is raised\r\n  and the end of the boom.\r\n\r\n  The margin of safety of steel wire rope is much larger than is that of\r\n  hempen rope, a fact of importance both in towing in a rough sea and in\r\n  hauling. Galvanized steel wire with a hempen core was first used by\r\n  Agassiz on the \"Blake.\" He states that his wire weighed one pound per\r\n  fathom, against two pounds per fathom of hempen rope, and had a\r\n  breaking strain nearly twice that of hempen rope, which bore two tons.\r\n  Thus in hauling the wire rope has both greater capability and less\r\n  actual strain. It has also the advantages of occupying a mere fraction\r\n  (1/9) of the storage space needed for rope, of lasting much longer,\r\n  and its vibrations transmit much more rapid and minute indications of\r\n  the conduct of the dredge.\r\n\r\n  Wire rope is kept wound on reels supplied with efficient brakes to\r\n  check or stop its progress, and an engine is often fitted for winding\r\n  it in and veering it out. From the reel it passes to the drum of the\r\n  hauling engine, round which it takes some few turns; care is taken by\r\n  watching or by the use of an automatic regulator (Tanner) that it is\r\n  taken at a rate equal to that at which it is moving over the side.\r\n  From the hauling engine it passes over leading wheels (one of which\r\n  should preferably be a registering wheel and indicate the amount of\r\n  rope which has passed it), and so it reaches the end of the derrick\r\n  boom.\r\n\r\nThe dredge is lowered from the derrick boom, which has been previously\r\ntrained over to windward so that its end is well clear of the ship,\r\nwhile the ship is slowly moving forward. The rope is checked until the\r\nnet is seen to be towing clear, and then lowered rapidly. Where a weight\r\nis used in front of the trawl Captain Calver successfully adopted the\r\nplan of backing after sufficient line had been paid out: the part of the\r\nrope from weight to surface thus became more vertical, while the shorter\r\nremainder, previously in line with it, sank to the bottom without change\r\nof relative position of weight and dredge. The ship was then ready for\r\ntowing. When no front weight is used the manoeuvre is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThere should be a relation maintained between speed of vessel onward and\r\nof rope downward, or a foul haul may result owing to the gear capsizing\r\n(in the case of a trawl), or getting the net over the mouth (in a\r\ndredge). The most satisfactory method of ensuring this relation seems to\r\nbe so to manage the two speeds that the angle made by the dredge rope is\r\nfairly constant. This angle can be observed with a simple clinometer.\r\nThe following table abridged from Tanner most usefully brings together\r\nthe requisite angles with other useful quantities.\r\n\r\n  +----------+----------------+---------+---------------+---------------+\r\n  | Depth of | Speed of ship  |Length of|Angle of dredge|Angle of dredge|\r\n  |  water.  | while shooting |  rope   |  rope while   |  rope while   |\r\n  |          |dredge or trawl.|required.|lowering trawl.|dragging trawl.|\r\n  +----------+----------------+---------+---------------+---------------+\r\n  | Fathoms. |     Knots.     | Fathoms.|               |               |\r\n  |    100   |       3        |   200   |       60      |      55       |\r\n  |    200   |       3        |   400   |       60      |      55       |\r\n  |    400   |       3        |   700   |       60      |      52       |\r\n  |    600   |       2¾       |  1000   |       55      |      50       |\r\n  |    800   |       2½       |  1200   |       50      |      44       |\r\n  |   1000   |       2½       |  1500   |       50      |      40       |\r\n  |   1500   |       2¼       |  2166   |       50      |      40       |\r\n  |   2000   |       2        |  2670   |       45      |      35       |\r\n  |   3000   |       2        |  4000   |       40      |      35       |\r\n  +----------+----------------+---------+---------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nThe speed of towing, always slow, may be assumed to be approximately\r\ncorrect if the appropriate angle is maintained. Hauling should at first\r\nbe slow from great depths, but may increase in speed as the gear rises.\r\n\r\n  For further details of deep-sea dredging, especially of the hauling\r\n  machinery and management of the gear, the special reports of the\r\n  various expeditions must be consulted. Commander Tanner, U.S.N., has\r\n  given in _Deep Sea Exploration_ (1897) a very full and good account of\r\n  the equipment of an exploring ship; and to this book the present\r\n  article is much indebted.\r\n\r\n_Modifications and Additions to the Dredge._--From 1818, when Sir John\r\nRoss brought up a fine Astrophyton from over 800 fathoms on a sounding\r\nline in Baffin's Bay, instances gradually accumulated of specimens being\r\nobtained from great depths without nets or traps. The naturalists of the\r\n\"Porcupine\" and other expeditions found that echinoderms, corals and\r\nsponges were often carried up adhering to the outer surface of the\r\ndredge and the last few fathoms of dredge rope. In order to increase the\r\neffectiveness of this method of capture a bar was fastened to the bottom\r\nof the dredge, to which bunches of teased-out hemp were tied. In this\r\nway specimens of the greatest interest, and frequently of equal\r\nimportance with those in the dredge bag, were obtained. The tangle bar\r\nwas at first attached to the back of the net. From the \"Challenger\"\r\nexpedition onward it has been fixed behind the net by iron bars\r\nstretching back from the short sides of the dredge frame which pass\r\nthrough eyes in their first ends (fig. 15). The swabs are thus unable to\r\nfold over the mouth of the dredge. Rope lashings to the lips of the\r\ndredge are sometimes added, and a weight is tied to the larger bar to\r\nkeep it down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Deep-sea Dredge, with Tangle Bar.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the tangle bar is used alone (Agassiz), and one form\r\n(Tanner) has two bars, stretching back like the side strokes of the\r\nletter A from a strong steel spring in the form of an almost complete\r\ncircle. The whole is pulled forward from a spherical sinker fastened in\r\nfront of the spring apex; and should the apex enter a crevice between\r\nrock masses, the side bars are closed by the pressure instead of\r\ncatching and bringing up. This is said to be a very useful instrument\r\namong corals.\r\n\r\n  _The Blake Dredge._--In the soft ooze which forms the bottom of deep\r\n  seas the common dredge sinks and digs much too deeply for its ordinary\r\n  purpose, owing partly to its chief weight bearing on the frame only,\r\n  partly to its everted lips. To obviate these defects Lieutenant\r\n  Commander Sigsbee of the \"Blake\" devised the Blake dredge. Its novel\r\n  features were the frame and lips. The former was in the form of a\r\n  skeleton box; that is, a rectangle of iron bars was placed at the back\r\n  as well as the front or mouth of the net and four more iron bars\r\n  connected the two rectangles. The lips instead of being everted were\r\n  in parallel planes--those, namely, of the top and bottom of the net.\r\n  The effect of this was to minimize digging and somewhat spread the\r\n  incidences of the weight. Another advantage was that the net being\r\n  constantly distended by its frame, and, moreover, protected top and\r\n  bottom by an external shield of canvas, quite delicate specimens\r\n  reached the surface uninjured. The dredge weighed 80 lb. and was 4\r\n  ft. square and 9 in. deep.\r\n\r\n  _Rake Dredges._--These are devices for collecting burrowing creatures\r\n  without filling the dredge with the soil in which they live. Holt\r\n  used, at Plymouth, a dredge whose side bars and lower lip were of\r\n  iron, the latter armed with forward and downward pointing teeth which\r\n  stirred up the sand and its denizens in front of the dredge mouth. The\r\n  upper lip of the dredge was replaced by a bar of wood. The bag was of\r\n  cheese-cloth or light open canvas, and the whole was of light\r\n  construction. The apparatus was very useful in capturing small\r\n  burrowing crustacea. The Chester rake dredge is a Blake dredge in\r\n  front of which is secured a heavy iron rectangle with teeth placed\r\n  almost at right angles to its long sides and in the plane of the\r\n  rectangle. Each of these instruments has a width along the scraping\r\n  edge of about 3 ft.\r\n\r\n  _Triangular and Conical Dredges._--Two other dredges are worthy of\r\n  mention. The triangular dredge, much resembling Müller's but with a\r\n  triangular mouth, and hung by chains from its angles, is an old\r\n  fashion now not in general use. It is, however, very useful for rocky\r\n  ground. At the Plymouth marine laboratory was also devised the conical\r\n  dredge (1901), the circular form being the suggestion of Garstang.\r\n  This dredge (fig. 16) was intended for digging deeply. It is of\r\n  wrought iron, and of the following dimensions: diameter of mouth 16\r\n  in., length 33 in., depth of ring at mouth 9 in. Its weight is 67\r\n  lb. As at first used the spaces between the bars are closed by wire\r\n  netting; if used for collecting bottom samples it is furnished with a\r\n  lining of strong sail-cloth.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Conical Dredge being hoisted in.]\r\n\r\n  Its weight and the small length of edge in contact with the ground\r\n  cause this dredge to dig well, and enable the user to obtain many\r\n  objects which though quite common are of rare occurrence in an\r\n  ordinary dredge. Thus on the Brown Ridges, a fishing-ground west of\r\n  Holland, although _Donax vittalus_ is known from examination of fish\r\n  stomachs to be abundant, it is rarely taken except in the conical\r\n  dredge: the same is true of _Echinocyamus pusillus_, which is in many\r\n  parts of the North Sea abundant in bottom samples and in no ordinary\r\n  dredgings. With the sail-cloth lining the conical dredge fills in\r\n  about 10 minutes on most ground, and no material washing out of fine\r\n  sediment occurs on hauling. In shallow seas such as the North Sea\r\n  commercial beam and other trawls are now used as quantitative\r\n  instruments in the estimation of the fish population, especially of\r\n  the _Pleuronectidae_.\r\n\r\n  _Use of Small Trawls for Dredging._--Although these trawls do not here\r\n  concern us, certain adaptations of small beam trawls for biological\r\n  exploration are of such identical use with the dredge, and differ from\r\n  it so little in structure and size, that they may be here described.\r\n\r\n  A small beam trawl was first used from the \"Challenger\" (fig. 17). It\r\n  was sent down in 600 fathoms off Cape St Vincent, the reason for its\r\n  use being the frequency with which the dredge sank into the sea-bottom\r\n  and there remained until hauling. The experiment was entirely\r\n  successful. The sinking of the net was avoided, the net had a much\r\n  greater spread than the dredge, and in addition to invertebrates it\r\n  captured several fish. After this the trawl was frequently used\r\n  instead of the dredge. Indeed tangle bar, dredge and trawl form a\r\n  series which are fitted for use on the roughest, moderately rough and\r\n  fairly firm, and the softest ground respectively, although the dredge\r\n  can be used almost anywhere.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Sir Charles Wyville Thomson's _Voyage of the\r\n  \"Challenger.\"_ By permission of Macmillan & Co., Ltd\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.--Trawl of the \"Challenger.\"]\r\n\r\n  The frame of the \"Challenger\" trawl consisted of a 15 ft. wooden beam\r\n  which in use was drawn over the sea-bed on two runners resembling\r\n  those of a sledge, by means of two ropes or bridles attached to eyes\r\n  in the front of the runners or \"trawl heads.\" A net 30 ft. long was\r\n  suspended by one side to the beam by half-a-dozen stops. The remainder\r\n  of the net's mouth was of much greater length than the beam, and was\r\n  weighted with close-set rolls of sheet lead; it thus dragged along the\r\n  bottom in a curve approximately to a semicircle, behind the beam. The\r\n  net tapers towards the hinder end, and contains a second net with open\r\n  bottom, which, reaching about three-quarters of the way down the main\r\n  net, acts as a valve or pocket. Both heels (or hinder ends) of the\r\n  trawl heads and the tail of the net were weighted to assist the net in\r\n  digging sufficiently and to maintain its balance--an important point,\r\n  since if the trawl lands on its beam the net's mouth remains closed,\r\n  and nothing is caught.\r\n\r\n  The main differences of this trawl from the dredge are the replacement\r\n  of scraping lip by ground rope, the position of this ground rope and\r\n  the greater size of the mouth. The absence of a lip makes it less\r\n  effective for burrowing and sessile creatures, but the weighted ground\r\n  rope nevertheless secures them to a very surprising extent. The\r\n  position of the ground rope is an important feature, as any free\r\n  swimming creature not disturbed until the arrival of the ground rope\r\n  cannot escape by simply rising or \"striking\" up. This and the greater\r\n  spread make the trawl especially suitable for the collection of fishes\r\n  and other swiftly moving animals. The first haul of the \"Challenger\"\r\n  trawl brought up fishes, and most of our knowledge of fish of the\r\n  greatest depths is due to it.\r\n\r\n  A tendency to return to the use of the small beam trawl for deep-sea\r\n  work has lately shown itself. That used by Tanner on the \"Albatross\"\r\n  has runners more heart-shaped than the \"Challenger's\" instrument; the\r\n  net is fastened to the downward and backward sloping edge of the\r\n  runner as well as to the beam, being thus fixed on three sides instead\r\n  of one; and a Norwegian glass float is fastened in a network cover to\r\n  that part of the net which is above and in front of the ground rope in\r\n  use, to assist in keeping the opening clear. These floats can stand\r\n  the pressure at great depths, and do not become waterlogged as do cork\r\n  floats. The largest \"Albatross\" trawl has a beam 11 ft. long, runners\r\n  2 ft. 5 in. high, and its frame weighs 275 lb.\r\n\r\n  _Agassiz or Blake Trawl._--This is generally considered to possess\r\n  advantages over the preceding, and is decidedly better for those not\r\n  experts in trawling. Its frame (fig. 18) consists of two iron runners\r\n  each the shape of a capital letter D, joined by iron rods or pipes\r\n  which connect the middle of each stroke with the corresponding point\r\n  on the other letter. The net is a tapering one, its mouth being a\r\n  strong rope bound with finer rope for protection till the whole\r\n  reaches a thickness of some 2 in. It is fastened to the frame at four\r\n  points only, the ends of the curved rods, and thus has a rectangular\r\n  opening.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Alexander E. Agassiz's _Three Cruises of the\r\n  \"Blake.\"_ By permission of Houghton, Mifflin & Co.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.--Agassiz or Blake Trawl.]\r\n\r\n  The chief advantage of this frame is that it does not matter in the\r\n  least which side lands first on the bottom; it is to the other trawls\r\n  what Ball's dredge is to an oyster dredge. The course can also be\r\n  altered during shooting or towing the Blake trawl with far greater\r\n  ease than is the case with others. An Agassiz trawl very successful in\r\n  the North Sea has the following dimensions: length of the connecting\r\n  rods and therefore of the mouth 8 ft., height of runners and of mouth\r\n  1 ft. 9 in., extreme length of runners 2 ft., length of net 11 ft. 3\r\n  in., weight of whole trawl 94 lb., 63 of which are due to the frame.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to note how closely our knowledge of bottom-living\r\nforms has been associated with the instruments of capture in use. As\r\nlong as small vessels were used in dredging, the belief that life was\r\nlimited to the regions accessible to them was widely spread. The first\r\nknown denizens of great depths were the foraminifera and few echinoderms\r\nbrought up by various sounding apparatus. Next with the dredge and\r\ntangles the number of groups obtained was much greater. As soon as\r\ntrawls were adopted fish began to make their appearance. The greatest\r\ngaps in our knowledge still probably occur in the large and swiftly\r\nmoving forms, such as fish and cephalopods. As we can hardly hope to\r\nmove apparatus swiftly over the bottom in great depths, the way in which\r\nimprovement is possible probably is that of increasing the spread of the\r\nnets; and a start in this direction appears to have been made by Dr\r\nPetersen, who has devised a modified otter sieve which catches fish at\r\nall events very well, and has been operated already at considerable\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nOf the economy of quite shallow seas, however, we are still largely\r\nignorant. Much as has been learnt of the bionomics of the sea, it is but\r\na commencement; and this is of course especially true of deep seas. The\r\ndredge and its kindred have, however, in less than a century enabled\r\nnaturalists to compile an immense mass of knowledge of the structure,\r\ndevelopment, affinities and distribution of the animals of the sea-bed,\r\nand in the most accessible seas to produce enumerations and\r\nmorphological accounts of them of some approach to completeness.\r\n     (J. O. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRELINCOURT, CHARLES (1595-1669), French Protestant divine, was born at\r\nSedan on the 10th of July 1595. In 1618 he undertook the charge of the\r\nFrench Protestant church at Langres, but failed to receive the necessary\r\nroyal sanction, and early in 1620 he removed to Paris, where he was\r\nnominated minister of the Reformed Church at Charenton. He was the\r\nauthor of a large number of works in devotional and polemical theology,\r\nseveral of which had great influence. His _Catechism_ (_Catéchisme ou\r\ninstruction familière_, 1652) and his _Christian's Defense against the\r\nFears of Death_ (_Consolations de l'âme fidèle contre les frayeurs de la\r\nmort, 1651_) became well known in England by means of translations,\r\nwhich were very frequently reprinted. It has been said that Daniel Defoe\r\nwrote his fiction of Mrs Veal (_A True Relation of the Apparition of Mrs\r\nVeal_), who came from the other world to recommend the perusal of\r\n_Drelincourt on Death_, for the express purpose of promoting the sale of\r\nan English translation of the _Consolations_; Defoe's contribution is\r\nadded to the fourth edition of the translation (1706). Another popular\r\nwork of his was _Les Visites charitables pour toutes sortes de personnes\r\naffligées_ (1669). Drelincourt's controversial works were numerous.\r\nDirected entirely against Roman Catholicism, they did much to strengthen\r\nand consolidate the Protestant party in France. He died on the 3rd of\r\nNovember 1669.\r\n\r\nSeveral of his sons were distinguished as theologians or physicians.\r\nLaurent (1626-1681) became a pastor, and was the author of _Sonnets\r\nchrétiens sur divers sujets_ (1677); Charles (1633-1697) was professor\r\nof physic at the university of Leiden, and physician to the prince of\r\nOrange; Peter (1644-1722) was ordained a priest in the Church of\r\nEngland, and became dean of Armagh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRENTE, a province of Holland, bounded N. and N.E. by Groningen, S.E. by\r\nthe Prussian province of Hanover, S. and S.W. by Overysel, and N.W. by\r\nFriesland; area, 1128 sq. m.; pop. (1900) 149,551. The province of\r\nDrente is a sandy plateau forming the kernel of the surrounding\r\nprovinces. The soil consists almost entirely of sand and gravel, and is\r\ncovered with bleak moorland, patches of wood, and fen. This is only\r\nvaried by the strip of fertile clay and grass-land which is found along\r\nthe banks of the rivers, and by the areas of high fen in the\r\nsouth-eastern corner and on the western borders near Assen. The surface\r\nof the province is a gentle slope from the south-west towards the\r\nnorth-east, where it terminates in the long ridge of hills known as the\r\nHondsrug (Dog's Back) extending along the eastern border into Groningen.\r\nThe watershed of the province runs from east to west across the middle\r\nof the province, along the line of the Orange canal. The southern\r\nstreams are all collected at two points on the southern borders, namely,\r\nat Meppel and Koevorden, whence they communicate with the Zwarte Water\r\nand the Vecht respectively by means of the Meppeler Diep and the\r\nKoevorden canal. The Steenwyker Aa, however, enters the Zuider Zee\r\nindependently. The northern rivers all flow into Groningen. The piles of\r\ngranite rocks somewhat in the shape of cromlechs which are found\r\nscattered about this province, and especially along the western edge of\r\nthe Hondsrug, have long been named _Hunebedden_, from a popular\r\nsuperstition that they were \"Huns' beds.\" Possibly the word originally\r\nmeant \"beds of the dead,\" or tombs.\r\n\r\nTwo industries have for centuries been associated with the barren heaths\r\nand sodden fens so usually found together on the sand-grounds, namely,\r\nthe cultivation of buckwheat and peat-digging. The work is conducted on\r\na regular system of fen colonization, the first operation being directed\r\ntowards the drainage of the country. This is effected by means of\r\ndrainage canals cut at regular intervals and connected by means of cross\r\nditches. These draining ditches all have their issue in a main drainage\r\ncanal, along which the transport of the peat and peat-litter takes place\r\nand the houses of the colonists are built. The heathlands when\r\nsufficiently drained are prepared for cultivation by being cut into sods\r\nand burnt. This system appears to have been practised already at the end\r\nof the 17th century. After eight years, however, the soil becomes\r\nexhausted, and twenty to thirty years are required for its\r\nrefertilization. The cultivation of buckwheat on these grounds has\r\ndecreased, and large areas which were formerly thus treated now lie\r\nwaste. Potatoes, rye, oats, beans and peas are also largely cultivated.\r\nIn connexion with the cultivation of potatoes, factories are established\r\nfor making spirits, treacle, potato-meal, and straw-paper. Furthermore,\r\nagriculture is everywhere accompanied on the sand-grounds by the rearing\r\nof sheep and cattle, which assist in fertilizing the soil. Owing to the\r\nmeagreness of their food these animals are usually thin and small, but\r\nare quickly restored when placed on richer grounds. The breeding of pigs\r\nis also widely practised on the sand-grounds, as well as forest culture.\r\nOf the fen-colonies in Drente the best known are those of Frederiksoord\r\nand Veenhuizen.\r\n\r\nOwing to the general condition of poverty which prevailed after the\r\nFrench evacuation in the second decade of the 19th century, attention\r\nwas turned to the means of industry offered by the unreclaimed\r\nheath-lands in the eastern provinces, and in 1818 the Society of Charity\r\n(_Maatschappij van Weldadigheid_) was formed with Count van den Bosch at\r\nits head. This society began by establishing the free agricultural\r\ncolony of Frederiksoord, about 10 m. N. of Meppel, named after Prince\r\nFrederick, son of William I., king of the Netherlands. An industrious\r\ncolonist could purchase a small farm on the estate and make himself\r\nindependent in two years. In addition to this, various industries were\r\nset on foot for the benefit of those who were not capable of field work,\r\nsuch as mat and rope making, and jute and cotton weaving. In later times\r\nforest culture was added, and the Gerard Adriaan van Swieten schools of\r\nforestry, agriculture and horticulture were established by Major van\r\nSwieten in memory of his son. A Reformed and a Roman Catholic church are\r\nalso attached to the colony. To this colony the Society of Charity later\r\nadded the adjoining colonies of Willemsoord and Kolonie VII. in\r\nOverysel, and Wilhelminasoord partly in Friesland. The colony of\r\nVeenhuizen lies about 7 m. N.W. of Assen, and was founded by the same\r\nsociety in 1823. In 1859, however, the Veenhuizen estates were sold to\r\nthe government for the purpose of a penal establishment for drunkards\r\nand beggars.\r\n\r\nOwing to its geographical isolation, the development of Drente has\r\nremained behind that of every other province in the Netherlands, and\r\nthere are few centres of any importance, either agricultural or\r\nindustrial. Hence the character and customs of the people have remained\r\npeculiarly conservative. Assen is the chief town. In the south Meppel\r\nand Koevorden absorb the largest amount of trade. Hoogeveen, situated\r\nbetween these two, owes its origin to the fen reclamation which was\r\nbegun here in 1625 by Baron van Echten. In the following year it was\r\nerected into a barony which lasted till 1795. The original industry has\r\nlong since moved onwards to other parts, but the town remains a\r\nprosperous market centre, and has a considerable industrial activity.\r\nExtensive fir woods have been laid out in the neighbourhood. Zuidlaren\r\nis a picturesque village at the northern end of the Hondsrug, with an\r\nimportant market. The railway from Amsterdam to Groningen traverses\r\nDrente; branch lines connect Meppel with Leeuwarden and Assen with\r\nDelfzÿl.\r\n\r\n_History._--The early history of Drente is obscure. That it was\r\ninhabited at a remote date is proved by the prehistoric sepulchral\r\nmounds, the _Hunebedden_ already mentioned. In the 5th and 6th centuries\r\nthe country was overrun by Saxon tribes, and later on was governed by\r\ncounts under the Frankish and German kings. Of these only three are\r\nrecorded, Eberhard (943-944), Balderic (1006) and Temmo (1025). In 1046\r\nthe emperor Henry III. gave the countship to the bishop and chapter of\r\nUtrecht, who governed it through the burgrave, or châtelain, of\r\nKoevorden, a dignity which became hereditary after 1143 in the family of\r\nLudolf or Roelof, brother of Heribert of Bierum, bishop of Utrecht\r\n(1138-1150). This family became extinct in the male line about 1232, and\r\nwas succeeded by Henry I. of Borculo (1232-1261), who had married the\r\nheiress of Roelof III. of Koevorden. In 1395 Reinald IV. (d. 1410) of\r\nBorculo-Koevorden was deposed by Bishop Frederick of Utrecht, and the\r\ncountry was henceforth administered by an episcopal official\r\n(_amptman_), who was, however, generally a native. With its popularly\r\nelected assembly of twenty-four Etten (_jurati_) Drente remained\r\npractically independent. This state of things continued till 1522, when\r\nit was conquered by Duke Charles of Gelderland, from whom it was taken\r\nby the emperor Charles V. in 1536, and became part of the Habsburg\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nDrente took part in the revolt of the Netherlands, and being a district\r\ncovered by waste heath and moor was, on account of its poverty and\r\nsparse population, not admitted into the union as a separate province,\r\nand it had no voice in the assembly of the states-general. It was\r\nsubdued by the Spaniards in 1580, but reconquered by Maurice of Nassau\r\nin 1594. During the years that followed, Drente, though unrepresented in\r\nthe states-general, retained its local independence and had its own\r\nstadtholder. William Louis of Nassau-Siegen (d. 1620) held that office,\r\nand it was held later by Maurice, Frederick Henry, William II. and\r\nWilliam III., princes of Orange. At the general assembly of 1651 Drente\r\nput forward its claim to admission as a province, but was not admitted.\r\nAfter the deaths of William II. (1650) and of William III. (1702) Drente\r\nremained for a term of years without a stadtholder, but in 1722 William\r\nCharles Henry of the house of Nassau-Siegen, who, through the extinction\r\nof the elder line, had become prince of Orange, was elected stadtholder.\r\nHis descendants held that office, which was declared hereditary, until\r\nthe French conquest in 1795. In the following year Drente at length\r\nobtained the privilege, which it had long sought, of being reckoned as\r\nan eighth province with representation in the states-general. Between\r\n1806 and 1813 Drente, with the rest of the Netherlands, was incorporated\r\nin the French empire, and, with part of Groningen, formed the department\r\nof Ems Occidental. With the accession of William I. as king of the\r\nNetherlands it was restored to its old position as a province of the new\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESDEN, a city of Germany, capital of the kingdom of Saxony, 71 m.\r\nE.S.E. from Leipzig and 111 m. S. from Berlin by railway. It lies at an\r\naltitude of 402 ft. above the Baltic, in a broad and pleasant valley on\r\nboth banks of the Elbe. The prospect of the city with its cupolas,\r\ntowers, spires and the copper green roofs of its palaces, as seen from\r\nthe distance, is one of striking beauty. On the left bank of the river\r\nare the Altstadt (old town) with four old suburbs and numerous new\r\nsuburbs, and the Friedrichstadt (separated from the Altstadt by a long\r\nrailway viaduct); on the right, the Neustadt (new town), Antonstadt, and\r\nthe modern military suburb Alberstadt. Five fine bridges connect the\r\nAltstadt and Neustadt. The beautiful central bridge--the Alte or\r\nAugustusbrücke--with 16 arches, built in 1727-1731, and 1420 ft. long,\r\nhas been demolished (1906) and replaced by a wider structure. Up-stream\r\nare the two modern Albert and Königin Carola bridges, and, down-stream,\r\nthe Marien and the Eisenbahn (railway) bridges. The streets of the\r\nAlstadt are mostly narrow and somewhat gloomy, those of the Neustadt\r\nmore spacious and regular.\r\n\r\nOn account of its delightful situation and the many objects of interest\r\nit contains, Dresden is often called \"German Florence,\" a name first\r\napplied to it by the poet Herder. The richness of its art treasures, the\r\neducational advantages it offers, and its attractive surroundings render\r\nit a favourite resort of people with private means. There are a large\r\nnumber of foreign residents, notably Austro-Hungarians and Russians, and\r\nalso a considerable colony of English and Americans, the latter\r\namounting to about 1500. The population of the city on the 1st of\r\nDecember 1905 was 516,996, of whom 358,776 lived on the left bank\r\n(Altstadt) and 158,220 on the right (Neustadt). The royal house belongs\r\nto the Roman Catholic confession, but the bulk of the inhabitants are\r\nLutheran Protestants.\r\n\r\nDresden is the residence of the king, the seat of government for the\r\nkingdom of Saxony, and the headquarters of the XII. (Saxon) Army Corps.\r\nWithin two decades (1880-1900) the capital almost at a single bound\r\nadvanced into the front rank of German commercial and industrial towns;\r\nbut while gaining in prosperity it has lost much of its medieval aspect.\r\nOld buildings in the heart of the Altstadt have been swept away, and\r\ntheir place occupied by modern business houses and new streets. Among\r\nthe public squares in the Altstadt must be mentioned the magnificent\r\nTheaterplatz, with a fine equestrian statue of King John, by Schilling;\r\nthe Altmarkt, with a monument commemorative of the war of 1870-71; the\r\nNeumarkt, with a bronze statue of King Frederick Augustus II., by E. J.\r\nHähnel; the Postplatz, adorned by a Gothic fountain, by Semper; and the\r\nBismarckplatz in the Anglo-American quarter. In the Neustadt are the\r\nmarket square, with a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus the Strong;\r\nthe Kaiser Wilhelmplatz; and the Albertplatz. The continuous Schloss-,\r\nSee- and Prager-Strasse, and the Wilsdruffer- and König Johann-Strasse\r\nare the main streets in the Altstadt, and the Hauptstrasse in the\r\nNeustadt.\r\n\r\nThe most imposing churches include the Roman Catholic Hofkirche, built\r\n(1739-1751) by C. Chiaveri, in rococo style, with a tower 300 ft. high.\r\nIt contains a fine organ by Silbermann and pictures by Raphael Mengs and\r\nother artists, the outside being adorned with 59 statues by Mattielli.\r\nOn the Neumarkt is the Frauenkirche, with a stone cupola rising to the\r\nheight of 311 ft.; close to the Altmarkt, the Kreuzkirche, rebuilt after\r\ndestruction by fire in 1897, also with a lofty tower surmounted by a\r\ncupola; and near the Postplatz the Sophienkirche, with twin spires. In\r\nthe Neustadt is the Dreikönigskirche (dating from the 18th century) with\r\na high pinnacled tower. Among more modern churches may be mentioned: in\r\nthe Altstadt, the Johanneskirche, with a richly decorated interior; the\r\nLukaskirche; and the Trinitatiskirche; and in the Neustadt, the Martin\r\nLuther-Kirche and the new garrison church. Apart from the chapels in the\r\nroyal palaces, Dresden contains in all 32 churches, viz. 21 Evangelical,\r\n6 Roman Catholic, a Reformed, a Russian, an English (erected by Gilbert\r\nScott) with a graceful spire, a Scottish (Presbyterian), and an American\r\n(Episcopal) church, the last a handsome building, with a pretty\r\nparsonage attached.\r\n\r\nOf secular buildings, the most noteworthy are grouped in the Altstadt\r\nnear the river. The royal palace, built in 1530-1535 by Duke George (and\r\nthus called Georgenschloss), was thoroughly restored, and in some\r\nmeasure rebuilt between 1890 and 1902, in German Renaissance style, and\r\nis now an exceedingly handsome structure. The Georgentor has been\r\nwidened, and through it, and beneath the royal apartments, vehicular\r\ntraffic from the centre of the town is directed to the Augustusbrücke.\r\nThe whole is surmounted by a lofty tower--387 ft.--the highest in\r\nDresden. The interior is splendidly decorated. In the palace chapel are\r\npictures by Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin, Guido Reni and Annibale Caracci.\r\nThe adjoining Prinzen-Palais on the Taschenberg, built in 1715, has a\r\nfine chapel, in which are various works of S. Torelli; it has also a\r\nlibrary of 20,000 volumes. The Zwinger, begun in 1711, and built in the\r\nrococo style, forms an enclosure, within which is a statue of King\r\nFrederick Augustus I. It was intended to be the vestibule to a palace,\r\nbut now contains a number of collections of great value. Until 1846 it\r\nwas open at the north side; but this space has since been occupied by\r\nthe museum, a beautiful Renaissance building, the exterior of which is\r\nadorned by statues of Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Dante, Goethe and\r\nother artists and poets by Rietschel and Hähnel, and it contains the\r\nfamous picture gallery. The Brühl palace, built in 1737 by Count Brühl,\r\nthe minister of Augustus II., has been in some measure demolished to\r\nmake room for the new Ständehaus (diet house), with its main façade\r\nfacing the Hofkirche; before the main entrance there is an equestrian\r\nstatue (1906) of King Albert. Close by is the Brühl Terrace, approached\r\nby a fine flight of steps, on which are groups, by Schilling,\r\nrepresenting Morning, Evening, Day and Night. The terrace commands a\r\nview of the Elbe and the distant heights of Loschwitz and the Weisser\r\nHirsch, but the prospect has of late years become somewhat marred, owing\r\nto the extension of the town up the river and to the two new up-stream\r\nbridges. The Japanese palace in the Neustadt, built in 1715 as a summer\r\nresidence for Augustus II., receives its name from certain oriental\r\nfigures with which it is decorated; it is sometimes called the Augusteum\r\nand contains the royal library. Among other buildings of note is the\r\nHoftheatre, a magnificent edifice in the Renaissance style, built after\r\nthe designs of Semper, to replace the theatre burnt in 1869, and\r\ncompleted in 1878. A new town hall of huge dimensions, also in German\r\nRenaissance, with an octagon tower 400 ft. in height, stands on the\r\nformer southern ramparts of the inner town, close to the Kreuzkirche. In\r\nthe Altstadt the most striking of the newer edifices is the\r\nKunstakademie, constructed from designs by K. Lipsius in the Italian\r\nRenaissance style, 1890-1894. The Albertinum, formerly the arsenal,\r\nbuilt in 1559-1563, was rebuilt 1884-1889, and fitted up as a museum of\r\noriental and classical antiquities, and as the depository of the state\r\narchives. On the right bank of the Elbe in Neustadt stand the fine\r\nbuildings of the ministries of war, of finance, justice, the interior\r\nand education. The public monuments of Dresden also include the Moritz\r\nMonument, a relief dedicated by the elector Augustus to his brother\r\nMaurice, a statue of Weber the composer by Rietschel, a bronze statue of\r\nTheodor Körner by Hähnel, the Rietschel monument on the Brühl Terrace by\r\nSchilling, a bust of Gutzkow, and a statue of Bismarck on the promenade.\r\nIn the suburbs which encircle the old town are to be noted the vast\r\ncentral Hauptbahnhof (1893-1898) occupying the site of the old\r\nBöhmischer railway station, the new premises of the municipal hospital\r\nand the Ausstellungs-Halle (exhibition buildings).\r\n\r\nThe chief pleasure-ground of Dresden is the Grosser Garten, in which\r\nthere are a summer theatre, the Reitschel museum, and a château\r\ncontaining a museum of antiquities. The latter is composed chiefly of\r\nobjects removed from the churches in consequence of the Reformation.\r\nNear the château is the zoological garden, formed in 1860, and\r\nexcellently arranged. A little to the south of Dresden, on the left bank\r\nof the Elbe, is the village Räcknitz, in which is Moreau's monument,\r\nerected on the spot where he was mortally wounded in 1813. The mountains\r\nof Saxon Switzerland are seen from this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n_Art._--Dresden owes a large part of its fame to its extensive artistic,\r\nliterary and scientific collections. Of these the most valuable is its\r\nsplendid picture gallery, founded by Augustus I. and increased by his\r\nsuccessors at great cost. It is in the museum, and contains about 2500\r\npictures, being especially rich in specimens of the Italian, Dutch and\r\nFlemish schools. The gem of the collection is Raphael's \"Madonna di San\r\nSisto,\" for which a room is set apart. There is also a special room for\r\nthe \"Madonna\" of the younger Holbein. Other paintings with which the\r\nname of the gallery is generally associated are Correggio's \"La Notte\"\r\nand \"Mary Magdalene\"; Titian's \"Tribute Money\" and \"Venus\"; \"The\r\nAdoration\" and \"The Marriage in Cana,\" by Paul Veronese; Andrea del\r\nSarto's \"Abraham's Sacrifice\"; Rembrandt's \"Portrait of Himself with his\r\nWife sitting on his Knee\"; \"The Judgment of Paris\" and \"The Boar Hunt,\"\r\nby Rubens; Van Dyck's \"Charles I., his Queen, and their Children.\"\r\n\r\nOf modern painters, this magnificent collection contains masterpieces by\r\nDefregger, Vautier, Makart, Munkacsy, Fritz von Uhde, Böcklin, Hans\r\nThoma; portraits by Leon Pohle, Delaroche and Sargent; landscapes by\r\nAndreas and Oswald Achenbach and allegorical works by Sascha Schneider.\r\nIn separate compartments there are a number of crayon portraits, most of\r\nthem by Rosalba Carriera, and views of Dresden by Canaletto and other\r\nartists. Besides the picture gallery the museum includes a magnificent\r\ncollection of engravings and drawings. There are upwards of 400,000\r\nspecimens, arranged in twelve classes, so as to mark the great epochs in\r\nthe history of art. A collection of casts, likewise in the museum, is\r\ndesigned to display the progress of plastic art from the time of the\r\nEgyptians and Assyrians to modern ages. This collection was begun by\r\nRaphael Mengs, who secured casts of the most valuable antiques in Italy,\r\nsome of which no longer exist.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese palace contains a public library of more than 400,000\r\nvolumes, with about 3000 MSS. and 20,000 maps. It is especially rich in\r\nthe ancient classics, and in works bearing on literary history and the\r\nhistory of Germany, Poland and France. There are also a valuable cabinet\r\nof coins and a collection of ancient works of art. A collection of\r\nporcelain in the \"Museum Johanneum\" (which once contained the picture\r\ngallery) is made up of specimens of Chinese, Japanese, East Indian,\r\nSèvres and Meissen manufacture, carefully arranged in chronological\r\norder. There is in the same building an excellent Historical Museum. In\r\nthe Grüne Gewölbe (Green Vault) of the Royal Palace, so called from the\r\ncharacter of its original decorations, there is an unequalled collection\r\nof precious stones, pearls and works of art in gold, silver, amber and\r\nivory. The objects, which are about 3000 in number, are arranged in\r\neight rooms. They include the regalia of Augustus II. as king of Poland;\r\nthe electoral sword of Saxony; a group by Dinglinger, in gold and\r\nenamel, representing the court of the grand mogul Aurungzebe, and\r\nconsisting of 132 figures upon a plate of silver 4 ft. 4 in. square; the\r\nlargest onyx known, 6-2/3 in. by 2¼ in.; a pearl representing the dwarf\r\nof Charles II. of Spain; and a green brilliant weighing 40 carats. The\r\nroyal palace also has a gallery of arms consisting of more than 2000\r\nweapons of artistic or historical value. In the Zwinger are the\r\nzoological and mineralogical museums and a collection of instruments\r\nused in mathematical and physical science. Among other collections is\r\nthat of the Körner museum with numerous reminiscences of the\r\nGoethe-Schiller epoch, and of the wars of liberation (1813-15), and\r\ncontaining valuable manuscripts and relics. Founded by Hofrath Dr Emil\r\nPeschel, it has passed into the possession of the city.\r\n\r\n_Education._--Dresden is the seat of a number of well-known scientific\r\nassociations. The educational institutions are numerous and of a high\r\norder, including a technical high school (with about 1100 students),\r\nwhich enjoys the privilege of conferring the degrees of doctor of\r\nengineering, doctor of technical sciences, &c., a veterinary college, a\r\npolitical-economic institution (Gehestiftung), with library, a school of\r\narchitects, a royal and four municipal gymnasia, numerous lower grade\r\nand popular schools, the royal conservatorium for music and drama, and a\r\ncelebrated academy of painting. Dresden has several important hospitals,\r\nasylums and other charitable institutions.\r\n\r\n_Music and the Theatres._--Besides the two royal theatres, Dresden\r\npossesses several minor theatres and music halls. The pride of place in\r\nthe world of music is held by the orchestra attached to the court\r\ntheatre. Founded by Augustus II., it has become famous throughout the\r\nworld, owing to the masters who have from time to time been associated\r\nwith it--such as Paër, Weber, Reissiger and Wagner. Symphony and popular\r\nconcerts are held throughout the year in various public halls, and,\r\nduring the winter, concerts of church music are frequently given in the\r\nProtestant Kreuz- and Frauen-Kirchen, and on Sundays in the Roman\r\nCatholic church.\r\n\r\n_Communications and Industries._--Dresden lies at the centre of an\r\nextensive railway system, which places it in communication with the\r\nchief cities of northern and central Germany as well as with Austria and\r\nthe East. Here cross the grand trunk lines Berlin-Vienna,\r\nChemnitz-Görlitz-Breslau. It is connected by two lines of railway with\r\nLeipzig and by local lines with neighbouring smaller towns. The\r\nnavigation on the Elbe has of recent years largely developed, and, in\r\naddition to trade by river with Bohemia and Magdeburg-Hamburg, there is\r\na considerable pleasure-boat traffic during the summer months. The\r\ncommunications within the city are maintained by an excellent system of\r\nelectric trams, which bring the more distant suburbs into easy connexion\r\nwith the business centre. A considerable business is done on the\r\nexchange, chiefly in local industrial shares, and the financial\r\ninstitutions number some fifty banks, among them branches of the Reichs\r\nBank and of the Deutsche Bank. Among the more notable industries may be\r\nmentioned the manufacture of china (see CERAMICS), of gold and silver\r\nornaments, cigarettes, chocolate, coloured postcards, perfumery,\r\nstraw-plaiting, artificial flowers, agricultural machinery, paper,\r\nphotographic and other scientific instruments. There are several great\r\nbreweries; corn trade is carried on, and an extensive business is done\r\nin books and objects of art.\r\n\r\n_Surroundings._--The environs of the city are delightful. To the north\r\nare the vine-clad hills of the Lössnitz commanding views of the valley\r\nof the Elbe from Dresden to Meissen; behind them, on an island in a\r\nlake, is the castle of Moritzburg, the hunting box of the king of\r\nSaxony. On the right bank of the Elbe, 3 m. above the city, lies the\r\nvillage of Loschwitz, where Schiller, in the summer of 1786, wrote the\r\ngreater part of his _Don Carlos_: above it on the fringe of the Dresdner\r\nHeide, the climatic health resort Weisser-Hirsch; farther up the river\r\ntowards Pirna the royal summer palace Pillnitz; to the south the\r\nPlauensche Grund, and still farther the Rabenauer Grund.\r\n\r\n_History._--Dresden (Old Slav _Drezga_, forest, _Drezgajan_,\r\nforest-dwellers), which is known to have existed in 1206, is of Slavonic\r\norigin, and was originally founded on the right bank of the Elbe, on the\r\nsite of the present Neustadt, which is thus actually the _old_ town. It\r\nbecame the capital of Henry the Illustrious, margrave of Meissen, in\r\n1270, but belonged for some time after his death, first to Wenceslaus of\r\nBohemia, and next to the margrave of Brandenburg. Early in the 14th\r\ncentury it was restored to the margrave of Meissen. On the division of\r\nSaxony in 1485 it fell to the Albertine line, which has since held it.\r\nHaving been burned almost to the ground in 1491, it was rebuilt; and in\r\nthe 16th century the fortifications were begun and gradually extended.\r\nJohn George II., in the 17th century, formed the Grosser Garten, and\r\notherwise greatly improved the town; but it was in the first half of the\r\n18th century, under Augustus I. and Augustus II., who were kings of\r\nPoland as well as electors of Saxony, that Dresden assumed something\r\nlike its present appearance. The Neustadt, which had been burned down in\r\nthe 17th century, was founded anew by Augustus I.; he also founded\r\nFriedrichstadt. The town suffered severely during the Seven Years' War,\r\nbeing bombarded in 1760. Some damage was also inflicted on it in 1813,\r\nwhen Napoleon made it the centre of his operations; one of the\r\nbuttresses and two arches of the old bridge were then blown up. The\r\ndismantling of the fortifications had been begun by the French in 1810,\r\nand was gradually completed after 1817, the space occupied by them being\r\nappropriated to gardens and promenades. Many buildings were completed or\r\nfounded by King Anthony, from whom Antonstadt derives its name. Dresden\r\nagain suffered severely during the revolution of 1849, but all traces of\r\nthe disturbances which then took place were soon effaced. In 1866 it was\r\noccupied by the Prussians, who did not finally evacuate it until the\r\nspring of the following year. Since that time numerous improvements have\r\nbeen carried out.\r\n\r\n  See Lindau, _Geschichte der Haupt- und Residenzstadt Dresden_ (2\r\n  vols., Dresden, 1884-1885); Prölss, _Geschichte des Hoftheaters in\r\n  Dresden_ (Dresden, 1877); Schumann, _Führer durch die königl.\r\n  Sammlungen zu Dresden_ (1903); Woerl, _Führer durch Dresden_; Daniel,\r\n  _Deutschland_ (1894).\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF DRESDEN. The battle of Dresden, the last of the great\r\nvictories of Napoleon, was fought on the 26th and 27th of August 1813.\r\nThe intervention of Austria in the War of Liberation, and the consequent\r\nadvance of the Allies under the Austrian field-marshal Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg from Prague upon Dresden, recalled Napoleon from Silesia,\r\nwhere he was engaged against the Prussians and Russians under Blücher.\r\nOnly by a narrow margin of time, indeed, was he able to bring back\r\nsufficient troops for the first day's battle. He detached a column under\r\nVandamme to the mountains to interpose between Schwarzenberg and Prague\r\n(see NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS); the rest of the army pressed on by forced\r\nmarches for Dresden, around which a position for the whole army had been\r\nchosen and fortified, though at the moment this was held by less than\r\n20,000 men under Gouvion St Cyr, who retired thither from the mountains,\r\nleaving a garrison in Königstein, and had repeatedly sent reports to the\r\nemperor as to the allied masses gathering to the southward. The battle\r\nof the first day began late in the afternoon, for Schwarzenberg waited\r\nas long as possible for the corps of Klenau, which formed his extreme\r\nleft wing on the Freiberg road. At last, about 6 p.m. he decided to wait\r\nno longer, and six heavy columns of attack advanced against the suburbs\r\ndefended by St Cyr and now also by the leading troops of the main army.\r\nThree hundred guns covered the assault, and Dresden was set on fire in\r\nplaces by the cannonade, while the French columns marched unceasingly\r\nover the bridges and through the Altstadt. On the right the Russians\r\nunder Wittgenstein advanced from Striesen, the Prussians under Kleist\r\nthrough the Grosser Garten, whilst Prussians under Prince Augustus and\r\nAustrians under Colloredo moved upon the Moczinski redoubt, which was\r\nthe scene of the most desperate fighting, and was repeatedly taken and\r\nretaken. The attack to the westward was carried out by the other\r\nAustrian corps; Klenau, however, was still far distant. In the end, the\r\nFrench defences remained unshaken. Ney led a counter-attack against the\r\nAllies' left, the Moczinski redoubt was definitely recaptured from\r\nColloredo, and the Prussians were driven out of the Grosser Garten. The\r\n_coup_ of the Allies had failed, for every hour saw the arrival of fresh\r\nforces on the side of Napoleon, and at length the Austrian leader drew\r\noff his men to the heights again. He was prepared to fight another\r\nbattle on the morrow--indeed he could scarcely have avoided it had he\r\nwished to do so, for behind him lay the mountain defiles, towards which\r\nVandamme was marching with all speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Emery Walker sc.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon's plan for the 27th was, as usual, simple in its outline. As at\r\nFriedland, a ravine separated a part of the hostile line of battle from\r\nthe rest. The villages west of the Plauen ravine and even Löbda were\r\noccupied in the early morning by General Metzko with the leading\r\ndivision of Klenau's corps from Freiberg, and upon Metzko Napoleon\r\nintended first to throw the weight of his attack, giving to Victor's\r\ninfantry and the cavalry of Murat, king of Naples, the task of\r\noverwhelming the isolated Austrians. The centre, aided by the defences\r\nof the Dresden suburbs, could hold its own, as the events of the 26th\r\nhad shown, the left, now under Ney, with whom served Kellermann's\r\ncavalry and the Young Guard, was to attack Wittgenstein's Russians on\r\nthe Pirna road. Thus, for once, Napoleon decided to attack both flanks\r\nof the enemy. His motives in so doing have been much discussed by the\r\ncritics; Vandamme's movements, it may be suggested, contributed to the\r\nFrench emperor's plan, which if carried out would open the Pirna road.\r\nStill, the left attack may have had a purely tactical object, for in\r\nthat quarter was the main body of the Prussians and Russians, and\r\nNapoleon's method was always to concentrate the fury of the attack on\r\nthe heaviest masses of the enemy, i.e. the best target for his own\r\nartillery. A very heavy rainstorm during the night seriously affected\r\nthe movements of troops on the following day, but all to Napoleon's\r\nadvantage, for his more mobile artillery, reinforced by every horse\r\navailable in and about Dresden, was still able to move where the Allied\r\nguns sank in mud. Further, if the cavalry had to walk, or at most trot,\r\nthrough the fields the opposing infantry was almost always unable to\r\nfire their muskets. \"You cannot fire; surrender,\" said Murat to an\r\nAustrian battalion in the battle. \"Never,\" they replied; \"you cannot\r\ncharge us.\" On the appearance of Murat's horse artillery, however, they\r\nhad to surrender at once. Under such conditions, Metzko, unsupported\r\neither by Klenau or the main army beyond the ravine, was an easy victim.\r\nVictor from Löbda drove in the advanced posts and assaulted the line of\r\nvillages Wolfnitz-Töltschen; Metzko had to retire to the higher ground\r\nS.W. of the first line, and Murat, with an overwhelming cavalry force\r\nfrom Cotta and Burgstädl, outflanked his left, broke up whole\r\nbattalions, and finally, with the assistance of the renewed frontal\r\nattack of Victor's infantry, annihilated the division. The Austrian\r\ncorps of Gyulai arrived too late to save it. A few formed bodies escaped\r\nacross the ravine, but Metzko and three-fourths of his men were killed\r\nor taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ney on the other flank, with his left on the Pillnitz road and\r\nhis right on the Grosser Garten, had opened his attack. The Russians\r\noffered a strenuous resistance, defending Seidnitz, Gross Döbritz and\r\nReick with their usual steadiness, and Ney was so far advanced that\r\nseveral generals at the Allied headquarters suggested a counter-attack\r\nof the centre by way of Strehlen, so as to cut off the French left from\r\nDresden. This plan was adopted, but, owing to various misunderstandings,\r\nfailed of execution. Thus the Allied centre remained inactive all day,\r\ncannonaded by the Dresden redoubts. One incident only, but that of great\r\nimportance, took place here. The tsar, the king of Prussia,\r\nSchwarzenberg and a very large headquarter staff watched the fighting\r\nfrom a hill near Räcknitz and offered an easy mark to the French guns.\r\nIn default of formed bodies to fire at, the latter had for a moment\r\nceased fire; Napoleon, riding by, half carelessly told them to reopen,\r\nand one of their first shots, directed at 2000 yards range against the\r\nmass of officers on the sky-line, mortally wounded General Moreau, who\r\nwas standing by the emperor Alexander. A council of war followed. The\r\nAllied sovereigns were for continuing the fight; Schwarzenberg, however,\r\nknowing the exhaustion of his troops decided to retreat. As at Bautzen,\r\nthe French cavalry was unable to make any effective pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe forces engaged were 96,000 French, Saxons, &c., and 200,000\r\nAustrians, Russians and Prussians. The French losses were about 10,000,\r\nor a little over 10%, those of the Allies 38,000 killed, wounded and\r\nprisoners (the latter 23,000) or 19%. They lost also 15 colours and 26\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESS (from the Fr. _dresser_, to set out, arrange, formed from Lat.\r\n_directus_, arranged, _dirigere_, to direct, arrange), a substantive of\r\nwhich the current meaning is that of clothing or costume in general, or,\r\nspecifically, the principal outer garment worn by a woman (see COSTUME).\r\nThe verb \"to dress\" has various applications which can be deduced from\r\nits original meaning. It is thus used not only of the putting on of\r\nclothing, but of the preparing and finishing of leather, the preparation\r\nof food for eating, the application of cleansing and healing substances\r\nor of bandages, &c., to a wound, the drawing up in a correct line of a\r\nbody of troops, and, generally, adorning or decking out, as of a ship\r\nwith flags. In the language of the theatre the \"dresser\" is the person\r\nwho looks after the actor's wardrobe and assists him in the changing of\r\nhis costumes. For the printer's use of \"dresser\" see TYPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESSER, in furniture, a form of sideboard. The name is derived from the\r\nFr. _dressoir_, a piece of furniture used to range or _dresser_ the more\r\ncostly appointments of the table. The appliance is the direct descendant\r\nof the credence and the buffet, and is, indeed, a much more legitimate\r\ninheritor of their functions than the modern sideboard, which, as we\r\nknow it, is practically an 18th-century invention. It developed into its\r\npresent shape about the second quarter of the 17th century, and has\r\nsince then changed but little. As a piece of movable furniture it was\r\nmade rarely, if at all, after the beginning of the 19th century until\r\nthe revival of interest in what is called \"farmhouse furniture\" at the\r\nvery beginning of the 20th century led in the first place to the\r\nconstruction of many imitation antique dressers from derelict pieces of\r\nold oak, and especially from panels of chests, and in the second to the\r\nmaking of avowed imitations. The dresser conformed to a model which\r\nvaried only in detail and in ornament. Its simple and agreeable form\r\nconsisted of a long and rather narrow table or slab, with drawers or\r\ncupboards beneath and a tall upright closed-in back arranged with a\r\nvarying number of shallow shelves for the reception of plates; hooks for\r\nmugs were often fixed upon the face of these shelves. Towards the end of\r\nthe 17th century small cupboards were often added to the superstructure.\r\nThe majority of these dressers were made of oak, but when, early in the\r\nGeorgian period mahogany came into general use, they were frequently\r\ninlaid with that wood; holly and box were also used for inlaying, most\r\nfrequently in the shape of plain bands or lines. A peculiarly effective\r\ncombination of oak and mahogany is found in the dressers, as in other\r\n\"farmhouse furniture,\" made on the borders of Staffordshire and\r\nShropshire. The excellence of the work of this kind in that district and\r\nin the country lying west of it may perhaps explain the expression\r\n\"Welsh dresser,\" which is now no more than a trade term, not necessarily\r\nsuggestive of the place of origin, and applied to all dressers of this\r\ntype. They are most frequently found in the houses of small yeomen and\r\nsubstantial farmers, into which fashion penetrated slowly. The dresser\r\nis now most familiar as necessary plenishing of the kitchen, in which it\r\nis invariably a fixture. In form it is essentially identical with the\r\nmovable variety, but it is usually much larger, is made of deal or other\r\nsoft wood, and the superstructure has no back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREUX, a town of north-western France, capital of an arrondissement in\r\nthe department of Eure-et-Loir, 27 m. N.N.W. of Chartres by rail. Pop.\r\n(1906) 8209. It is situated on the Blaise, which at this point divides\r\ninto several arms. It is overlooked from the north by an eminence on\r\nwhich stands a ruined medieval castle; within the enclosure of this\r\nbuilding is a gorgeous chapel, begun in 1816 by the dowager duchess of\r\nOrleans, and completed and adorned at great cost by Louis Philippe. It\r\ncontains the tombs of the Orleans family, chief among them that of Louis\r\nPhilippe, whose remains were removed from England to Dreux in 1876. The\r\nsculptures on the tombs and the stained glass of the chapel windows are\r\nmasterpieces of modern art. The older of the two hôtels-de-ville of\r\nDreux was built in the early 16th century, chiefly by Clément Métezau,\r\nthe founder of a famous family of architects, natives of the town. It is\r\nnotable both for the graceful carvings of the façade and for the fine\r\nstaircase and architectural details of the interior. The church of St\r\nPierre, which is Gothic in style, contains good stained glass and other\r\nworks of art. The town has a statue of the poet Jean de Rotrou, born\r\nthere in 1609. Dreux is the seat of a subprefect. Among the public\r\ninstitutions are tribunals of first instance and of commerce, and a\r\ncommunal college. The manufacture of boots and shoes, metal-founding and\r\ntanning, are carried on, and there is trade in wheat and other\r\nagricultural products and poultry.\r\n\r\nDreux was the capital of the Gallic tribe of the _Durocasses_. In 1188\r\nit was taken and burnt by the English; and in 1562 Gaspard de Coligny,\r\nand Louis I., prince of Condé, were defeated in its vicinity by Anne de\r\nMontmorency and Francis, duke of Guise. In 1593 Henry IV. captured the\r\ntown after a fortnight's siege. It was occupied by the Germans on the\r\n9th of October 1870, was subsequently evacuated, and was again taken, on\r\nthe 17th of November, by General Von Tresckow. In the 10th century Dreux\r\nwas the chief town of a countship, which Odo, count of Chartres, ceded\r\nto king Robert, and Louis VI. gave to his son Robert, whose grandson\r\nPeter of Dreux, younger brother of Count Robert III., became duke of\r\nBrittany by his marriage with Alix, daughter of Constance of Brittany by\r\nher second husband Guy of Thouars. By the marriage of the countess\r\nJeanne II. with Louis, viscount of Thouars (d. 1370), the Capetian\r\ncountship of Dreux passed into the Thouars family. In 1377 and 1378,\r\nhowever, two of the three co-heiresses of Jeanne, Perronelle and\r\nMarguerite, sold their shares of the countship to King Charles V.\r\nCharles VI. gave it to Arnaud Amanien d'Albret, but took it back in\r\norder to give it to his brother Louis of Orleans (1407); later he gave\r\nit back to the lords of Albret. Francis of Cleves laid claim to it in\r\nthe 16th century as heir of the d'Albrets of Orval, but the parlement of\r\nParis declared the countship to be crown property. It was given to\r\nCatherine de' Medici (1539), then to Francis, duke of Alençon (1569); it\r\nwas pledged to Charles de Bourbon, count of Soissons, and through him\r\npassed to the houses of Orleans, Vendôme and Condé.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREW, the name of a family of American actors. JOHN DREW (1827-1862) was\r\nborn in Dublin and made his first New York appearance in 1846. He played\r\nIrish and light comedy parts with success in all the American cities,\r\nand was manager of the Arch Street theatre in Philadelphia. He visited\r\nEngland in 1855, and Australia in 1859, and died in Philadelphia. His\r\nwife, LOUISE LANE DREW (1820-1897), was the daughter of a London actor,\r\nand in 1827 went to America, appearing as the Duke of York to the elder\r\nBooth's Richard III., and as Albert to Edwin Forrest's William Tell.\r\nAfter this she starred as a child actress, and then as leading lady. She\r\nhad been twice married before she became Mrs Drew in 1850. From 1861 to\r\n1892 she had the management of the Arch Street theatre in Philadelphia.\r\nIn 1880 she toured with Joseph Jefferson in his elaborate revival of\r\n_The Rivals_, playing Mrs Malaprop to perfection. She had three\r\nchildren, John, Sidney and Georgiana, wife of Maurice Barrymore\r\n(1847-1905), and mother of Lionel and Ethel Barrymore, all actors. The\r\neldest son, JOHN DREW (b. 1853), began his stage career under his\r\nmother's management in Philadelphia as Plumper in _Cool as a Cucumber_,\r\non the 22nd of March 1873; and after playing with Edwin Booth and\r\nothers, became leading man in Augustin Daly's company in 1879. His\r\nassociation with this company, and with Ada Rehan as the leading lady,\r\nconstituted a brilliant period in recent stage history, his Petruchio\r\nbeing only one, though perhaps the most striking, of a series of famous\r\nimpersonations. In 1892 he left Daly's company, and began a career as a\r\n\"star.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREW, SAMUEL (1765-1833), English theologian, was born in the parish of\r\nSt Austell, in Cornwall, on the 6th of March 1765. His father was a poor\r\nfarm labourer, and could not afford to send him to school long enough\r\neven to learn to read and write. At ten he was apprenticed to a\r\nshoemaker, and at twenty he settled in the town of St Austell, first as\r\nmanager for a shoemaker, and in 1787 began business on his own account.\r\nHe had already gained a reputation in his narrow circle as a keen\r\ndebater and a jovial companion, and it is said that he had several\r\nsmuggling adventures. He was first aroused to serious thought in 1785 by\r\na funeral sermon preached over his elder brother by Adam Clarke. He\r\njoined the Methodists, was soon employed as a class leader and local\r\npreacher, and continued to preach till a few months before his death.\r\nHis opportunities of gaining knowledge were very scanty, but he\r\nstrenuously set himself to make the most of them. It is stated that an\r\naccidental introduction to Locke's great essay determined the ultimate\r\ndirection of his studies. In 1798 the first part of Thomas Paine's _Age\r\nof Reason_ was put into his hands; and in the following year he made his\r\nfirst appearance as an author by publishing his _Remarks_ on that work.\r\nThe book was favourably received, and was republished in 1820. Drew had\r\nbegun to meditate a greater attempt before he wrote his _Remarks on\r\nPaine_; and, encouraged by the antiquary John Whitaker, he published his\r\n_Essay on the Immateriality and Immortality of the Soul_ in 1802. This\r\nwork made the \"Cornish metaphysician,\" as he was called, widely known,\r\nand for some time it held a high place in the judgment of the religious\r\nworld as a conclusive argument on its subject. A fifth edition appeared\r\nin 1831. Drew continued to work at his trade till 1805, when he entered\r\ninto an engagement with Dr Thomas Coke, a prominent Wesleyan official,\r\nwhich enabled him to devote himself entirely to literature. In 1809 he\r\npublished his _Essay on the Identity and General Resurrection of the\r\nHuman Body_, perhaps the most original of his works, which reached a\r\nsecond edition in 1822. In 1814 he completed a history of Cornwall begun\r\nby F. Hitchins. In 1819 he removed to Liverpool, being appointed editor\r\nof the _Imperial Magazine_, then newly established, and in 1821 to\r\nLondon, the business being then transferred to the capital. Here he\r\nfilled the post of editor till his death, and had also the supervision\r\nof all works issued from the Caxton Press. He was an unsuccessful\r\ncompetitor for the Burnett prize offered in 1811 for an essay on the\r\nexistence and attributes of God. The work which he then wrote, and which\r\nin his own judgment was his best, was published in 1820, under the title\r\nof _An Attempt to demonstrate from Reason and Revelation the Necessary\r\nExistence, Essential Perfections, and Superintending Providence of an\r\nEternal Being, who is the Creator, the Supporter, and the Governor of\r\nall Things_ (2 vols. 8 vo). This procured him the degree of M.A. from\r\nthe university of Aberdeen. Among Drew's lesser writings are a _Life of\r\nDr Thomas Coke_ (1817), and a work on the deity of Christ (1813). He\r\ndied at Helston in Cornwall on the 29th of March 1833. He was a man of\r\nstrong mind, honourable spirit and affectionate disposition, energetic\r\nboth in speech and in writing.\r\n\r\n  A memoir of his life by his eldest son appeared in 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREWENZ, a river of Germany, a right-bank tributary of the Vistula. It\r\nrises on the plateau of Hohenstein in East Prussia, 5 m. S.W. of the\r\ntown of Hohenstein. After passing through the lake of Drewenz (7 m.\r\nlong), it flows S.W. through flat marshy country, and forms, from just\r\nbelow the town of Strassburg to that of Leibitsch, a distance of 30 m.,\r\nthe frontier between Prussia and Russian Poland. After a course of 148\r\nm. it enters the Vistula from the right, a little above the fortress of\r\nThorn. It is navigable only for rafts. Lake Drewenz is connected with\r\nElbing (and so with the Baltic) by the navigable Elbing-Oberland Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREXEL, ANTHONY JOSEPH (1826-1893), American banker, was born in\r\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 13th of September 1826. He was the\r\nson of Francis M. Drexel (1792-1863), a native of Austrian Tirol, who\r\nemigrated to America in 1817, and, after some years spent as a\r\nportrait-painter, became a banker and the founder of the house of Drexel\r\n& Company. Anthony, who entered his father's counting-house in 1839,\r\neventually, with his brothers Francis and Joseph, succeeded to the\r\ncontrol of the business, and organized the banking houses of Drexel,\r\nMorgan & Company, New York, of which his brother Joseph W. (1833-1888)\r\nwas long the resident head, and of Drexel, Harjes & Company, Paris. In\r\n1864 he joined his friend George W. Childs in the purchase of the\r\nPhiladelphia _Public Ledger_, and with him in 1892 founded the Printers'\r\nHome for union men at Colorado Springs. In 1891 he founded, and endowed\r\nwith $2,000,000, the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry in\r\nPhiladelphia, the buildings for which he constructed at a cost of\r\n$750,000. This institution provides technical instruction for both night\r\nand day classes and public lecture courses, and has a good museum and a\r\nlibrary of 35,000 volumes. Drexel died at Carlsbad, Germany, on the 30th\r\nof June 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREYFUS, ALFRED (1859-   ), French soldier, of Jewish parentage, the\r\nscandal of whose condemnation for treason and subsequent rehabilitation\r\nconvulsed French political life between 1894 and 1899, and only ended in\r\n1906, was born in Mülhausen, Upper Alsace, removing to Paris in 1874.\r\nAfter going through the usual course of military instruction with\r\ncredit, he became a sous-lieutenant in the artillery in 1882, and was\r\npromoted captain in 1889; and, after passing through the _École de\r\nGuerre_ with distinction, he was appointed to the general staff. His\r\nname was, however, unknown to the general public till he was arrested on\r\nthe 15th of October 1894 on a charge of selling military secrets to\r\nGermany, condemned, publicly degraded (January 4, 1895), and transported\r\n(March 10) to the Ile du Diable, French Guiana. The story of the\r\nsubsequent proceedings in this celebrated case is told in the article\r\nANTI-SEMITISM, and need not here be repeated. It was not till 1899 that\r\nthe unfortunate prisoner was brought back to France for retrial by\r\ncourt-martial, and even then, so strong was the anti-Semitic and\r\nmilitary prejudice, he was again found guilty \"with extenuating\r\ncircumstances\" at Rennes (September 9), though ten days later he was\r\n\"pardoned\" by President Loubet. It was not till the Cour de Cassation\r\nordered a further investigation, and on the 12th of July 1906 decided\r\nthat his conviction had been based on a forgery and that Dreyfus was\r\ninnocent, that the agitation came to a final conclusion. He was then\r\nrestored to his rank in the army and promoted major. But the\r\nanti-Semitic and anti-Dreyfusard spirit in certain French circles could\r\nnot easily be quelled even then; and on the occasion of the translation\r\nof the remains of Emile Zola (Dreyfus's determined champion) to the\r\nPantheon on the 4th of June 1908, Major Dreyfus was shot at and wounded\r\nby a fanatical journalist named Gregori, who was subsequently acquitted\r\nby a Paris jury of the charge of attempted murder, his own plea being\r\nthat he had merely intended a \"demonstration.\"\r\n\r\n  See Dreyfus's own _Five Years of my Life_ (1901), and literature cited\r\n  under ANTI-SEMITISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIBURG, a town and spa of Germany, in Prussian Westphalia, pleasantly\r\nsituated on the Aa and the railway Soest-Höxter-Berlin. Pop. 2600. It\r\nhas an Evangelical and a Roman Catholic church and some glass\r\nmanufactures. It is celebrated for its saline-ferruginous springs,\r\ndiscovered in 766, and since 1779 largely frequented in summer. In the\r\nvicinity are the ruins of Iburg, a castle destroyed by Charlemagne in\r\n775, and bestowed by him upon the bishopric of Paderborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIFFIELD (officially Great Driffield), a market town in the Buckrose\r\nparliamentary division of the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, 19½ m.\r\nN. by W. from Hull, the junction of several branch lines of the North\r\nEastern railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 5766. It is pleasantly\r\nsituated at the foot of the Wolds, and is connected with Hull by a\r\nnavigable canal. The church of All Saints is of various dates from\r\nNorman onwards. The town is the centre of a rich agricultural district,\r\nand large markets and fairs are held. There are works for the\r\nmanufacture of oil-cake. Driffield is of high antiquity, and numerous\r\ntumuli are seen in the vicinity, while there is an excellent private\r\nantiquarian museum in the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIFT (from \"drive\"), a verb or noun used in various connexions with the\r\nsense of propelled motion, especially (but not necessarily) of an\r\naimless sort, undirected. Thus it is possible to speak of a snow-drift,\r\nan accumulation driven by the wind; of a ship drifting out of its\r\ncourse; of the drift of a speech, i.e. its general tendency. The word is\r\nalso used in some technical senses, more immediately resulting from the\r\naction of driving something in. But the most important technical use of\r\nthe word is in geology, as introduced by C. Lyell in 1840 in place of\r\n\"Diluvium.\" The earlier geologists had been in the habit of dividing the\r\nQuaternary deposits into an older Diluvium and a younger Alluvium; the\r\nlatter is still employed in England, but the former has dropped out of\r\nuse, though it is still retained by some continental writers. The\r\nAlluvium was distinguished from Diluvium by the fact that its mammalian\r\nfossils were representatives of still living forms, but it is a matter\r\nof great difficulty to separate these two divisions in practice. \"The\r\nterm drift is now applied generally to the Quaternary deposits, which\r\nconsist for the most part of gravel, sand, loam or brickearth and clay;\r\nit naturally refers to strata laid down at some distance from the rocks\r\nto whose destruction they are largely due; but, although applied to\r\nriver deposits, the word drift is more appropriately used in reference\r\nto the accumulations of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\n\"The occurrence of stones and boulders far removed from their parent\r\nsource early attracted the attention of geologists, but for a long\r\nperiod the phenomena, now known as of glacial origin, were unexplained,\r\nand the drifts were looked upon as little more than 'extraneous\r\nrubbish,' the product of geological agents, quite distinct from those\r\nwhich helped to form the more 'solid' rocks that underlie them.\" (See H.\r\nB. Woodward, _The Geology of England and Wales_, 2nd ed., 1887.) The\r\nconception of an underlying \"solid\" geological structure covered by a\r\nsuperficial mantle of \"drift\" is still retained for certain practical\r\npurposes; thus, the Geological Survey of Great Britain issues many of\r\nthe maps in two forms, the \"Solid Edition,\" showing the \"solid geology,\"\r\nwhich embraces all igneous rocks and the stratified rocks older than\r\nPleistocene, and the \"Drift Edition,\" which shows only such older strata\r\nas are unobscured by drift.\r\n\r\nIn writing and in conversation the geological expression \"drift\" is now\r\nusually understood to mean Glacial drift, including boulder clay and all\r\nthe varieties of sand, gravel and clay deposits formed by the agency of\r\nice sheets, glaciers and icebergs. But in the \"Drift\" maps many other\r\ntypes of deposit are indicated, such, for instance, as the ordinary\r\nmodern alluvium of rivers, and the older river terraces (River-drift of\r\nvarious ages), including gravels, brickearth and loam; old raised sea\r\nbeaches and blown-sand (Aeolian-drift); the \"Head\" of Cornwall and\r\nDevon, an angular detritus consisting of stones with clay or loam;\r\nclay-with-flints, rainwash (landwash), scree and talus; the \"Warp,\" a\r\nmarine and estuarine silt and clay of the Humber; and also beds of peat\r\nand diatomite.\r\n\r\n  See GLACIAL PERIOD; PLEISTOCENE; BOULDER CLAY. (J. A. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRILL. (1) A tool for boring or making holes in hard substances, such as\r\nstone, metal, &c. (an adaptation in the 17th century from the Dutch\r\n_dril_ or _drille_, from _drillen_, to turn, bore a hole; according to\r\nthe New English Dictionary the word is not to be connected with the\r\nEnglish \"thrill\"). The word _drillen_ was used in Dutch, German and\r\nDanish, from the 17th century for training in military exercises and was\r\nadopted into English in the same sense. The origin of the application\r\nseems to be in the primary sense of \"to turn round,\" from the turning of\r\nthe troops in their evolutions and from the turning of the weapons in\r\nthe soldiers' hands. Drill is, formally, the preparation of soldiers for\r\ntheir duties in war by the practice or rehearsal of movements in\r\nmilitary order and the handling of arms, and, psychologically, the\r\nmethod of producing in the individual soldier habits of self-control and\r\nof mechanically precise actions under disturbing conditions, and of\r\nrendering the common instinctive will of a body of men, large or small,\r\namenable to the control of, and susceptible to a stimulus imparted by\r\nits commander's will.\r\n\r\n(2) A furrow made in the soil in which seed may be sown, and a machine\r\nused for sowing seed in such furrows (see SOWING). The word is somewhat\r\ndoubtful in origin. It may be the same as an obsolete word \"drill,\" to\r\ntrickle, flow in drops, also a small stream or flow of water, a rill,\r\nand is possibly an altered form of \"trill.\"\r\n\r\n(3) In zoology, the native name of a large short-tailed west African\r\nbaboon, _Papio leucophaeus_, closely allied to the mandrill (q.v.), but\r\ndistinguished by the absence of brilliant blue and scarlet on the jaws\r\nof the fully adult males.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n(4) The name of a fabric made in both linen and cotton, and commonly\r\nbleached and finished stiff. The word is a shortened form of \"drilling,\"\r\nfrom the German _drillich_, or \"three-threaded,\" and is so named because\r\nthe weave originally used in its construction is what is termed the\r\nthree-leaf twill, nine repeats of which appear in the accompanying\r\nfigure, while immediately below the design is an intersection of all the\r\nnine threads with the first pick. It is essentially a warp-faced fabric;\r\nthat is, the upper surface is composed mostly of warp threads. In the\r\nfigure it will be seen that two out of every three threads appear on the\r\nsurface, and, by introducing a greater number of threads per inch than\r\npicks per inch, the weft is made to occupy a still more subordinate\r\nposition so far as the upper surface of the cloth is concerned. Although\r\nthe weave shown is still extensively used in this branch, there are\r\nothers, e.g. the 4-thread and the 5-thread weaves, which are employed\r\nfor the production of this cloth. Large quantities of drill are shipped\r\nto the Eastern markets and to other sub-tropical centres, from which it\r\nis sold for clothing. In temperate climates it forms a satisfactory\r\nmaterial for ladies' and children's summer clothing, and it is used by\r\nchefs, hairdressers, provision merchants, grocers, buttermen, painters\r\nand decorators, &c., while many of the long jackets or overalls, such as\r\nthose worn by many mill and factory managers, are made from the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRINKING VESSELS.[1] The use of special vessels for drinking purposes\r\nmay fairly be assumed to have had a natural origin and development. From\r\na practical point of view it would soon be found desirable to provide\r\nvessels for liquids in addition to those serving to hold food. As in\r\nmany other commonplace details of modern life, we must turn to the\r\nprimitive races to understand how our present conditions were reached.\r\nIn almost all parts of the world many of the products of nature are\r\ncapable of serving such purposes, with little or no change at the hands\r\nof man; in tropical and sub-tropical climates the coco-nut and the gourd\r\nor calabash require but little change to adapt them as the most\r\nconvenient of drinking utensils; the eggs of the larger birds, such as\r\nthe ostrich or the emu, shells, like the nautilus and other univalves,\r\nas well as the deeper bivalves, are equally convenient. Such natural\r\nobjects are in fact used by the uncivilized tribes of Africa, America\r\nand Polynesia, as well as, in some cases, by the white races who have\r\nintruded into those parts of the world, and adopted some of the native\r\nhabits. In Paraguay, for example, the so-called \"Paraguay tea,\" an\r\ninfusion of the _yerba maté_ (_Ilex paraguayensis_), is drunk through a\r\ntube from a small gourd held in the hand, and often handsomely mounted\r\nin silver or even gold. In the same way, as we shall see, civilized man\r\nhas adopted nearly all the natural forms that were found convenient by\r\nthe savage, altering and adorning them in accordance with the taste of\r\nthe time or country where they were used.\r\n\r\nAnother line of development, however, has been found to be the natural\r\noutcome of the human mind. Nothing could form a more practical drinking\r\ncup than the half of a coco-nut shell or part of a gourd. Such cups,\r\nhowever, in the countries where the plants producing them are common,\r\nwould be easily obtained, and every one, rich or poor, could possess one\r\nor more. In order, therefore, to distinguish the chief's possessions\r\nfrom those of his inferiors, his cup is often made with great labour,\r\nfrom some more intractable material, wood or stone, though in\r\npractically the same form as that of the natural object.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early drinking cups.\r\n\r\nAmong European races in medieval times the same lines have been\r\nfollowed, though for different reasons. Human ingenuity, though perhaps\r\noriginally inspired by natural forms, is apt to turn aside into more\r\nartificial channels. The invention of the potter's art (see CERAMICS),\r\nwhere the plastic nature of the raw material renders it capable of\r\ninfinite changes of form, gave rise to types of vessels having no\r\nobvious or necessary relation to the productions of nature. In Britain\r\nand in northern Europe generally, the interments of the races of the\r\nNeolithic and Bronze Ages have furnished vessels of pottery of a\r\nbeaker-like form, to which the name of \"drinking-cups\" has been given.\r\nIt must be confessed that the evidence for attributing such a use to\r\nthem is slender, and mainly consists of the fact that their thin lips\r\nwould render them better adapted for the purpose than the other pottery\r\nvessels found with them, some of which, on equally slight grounds, have\r\nbeen called food vessels. The general use and acceptance of the term by\r\ntwo generations of archaeologists is, however, an adequate reason for a\r\npassing mention in this place. In the later prehistoric times of Europe\r\nvessels of gold, bronze and other materials, including amber, were made,\r\nsometimes of elegant forms, and would seem to have been used as drinking\r\nvessels; still, this is again an assumption, though a fairly probable\r\none. A small gold cup with handle was found in a barrow at Rillaton,\r\nCornwall; one of amber of a similar form was found at Hove, and a third\r\nof shale near Honiton. All of these doubtless may be referred to the\r\nBronze Age.\r\n\r\n\r\n  New forms found by Schliemann.\r\n\r\nSchliemann found many drinking vessels in his exploration of the\r\nsuperimposed cities of Troy. A pretty form is that found in the first\r\ncity. It is of clay, and closely resembles an early Victorian tea cup on\r\na high foot. This form is of interest, as Schliemann discovered the same\r\nboth at Tiryns and Mycenae, five from the latter site being of gold,\r\nwhile the type also occurs from Ialysus in Rhodes in association with\r\nbronze swords. This Trojan cup was found at a depth of 50 ft. below the\r\npresent surface and about 18 ft. below the stratum of what Schliemann\r\nclaimed to be the Homeric Troy. In his second city appears a different\r\ntype of ware, somewhat fantastic in form, one vessel being in the form\r\nof a sow, while others foreshadow the _crater_ and _amphora_ of later\r\nand more familiar Greek wares.\r\n\r\nBut the drinking vessel to which Schliemann draws most attention is the\r\ntall cup of a trumpet form furnished with two earlike loop handles. This\r\ncurious and original type occurs also in the Third (or Homeric), Fourth\r\nand Sixth Cities, with little if any change. Schliemann devotes some\r\npages to the discussion of the form, in which he sees the [Greek: depas\r\namphikypellon][2] of Homer, which has been more usually understood to\r\nmean an hour-glass shaped cup, in which the distinguishing feature was\r\ntwo cups, not two handles. He applies the same term to a drinking vessel\r\nof a very different form, found with several others in the Third City.\r\nThis is a sauce-boat shaped vessel[3] of gold, made with a lip for\r\npouring or drinking at either end, and with two loop handles. This\r\nequals those previously mentioned in originality of form; with it were\r\nfound others of gold, silver and electrum (i.e. 4 parts of gold to 1 of\r\nsilver). Of these three were shaped like 18th-century coffee cups but\r\nwanting handles. In the Sixth City appear forms more nearly approaching\r\nthose of later times, particularly prototypes of the _cantharus_ and\r\n_scyphus_.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries in the various strata of Troy may be taken as the\r\nanalogues in the Mediterranean and hither Asia of the later Stone and\r\nBronze Ages of northern Europe, with an allowance of some centuries of\r\ngreater antiquity for the former.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed in this article to deal with the ceramic and metallic\r\ndrinking vessels of the Greeks and Romans, of what is generally known as\r\nthe classical period (see CERAMICS and PLATE). It may be mentioned,\r\nhowever, that both on the Rhine and in various places in Britain,\r\nnotably at Castor in Northamptonshire and in the New Forest, were\r\nfactories where large numbers of _pocula_ or drinking cups were made;\r\nthose made on the Rhine and at Castor bearing legends to indicate their\r\nuse. Many of these are to be seen in the British Museum and in the\r\nWallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Gothic and Scandinavian types.\r\n\r\nAfter the decline of Roman power, the Gothic and Scandinavian races who\r\nreplaced the Romans in central and northern Europe brought with them\r\ntheir own forms and types of drinking vessels. These, from about the 4th\r\ncentury, replaced the well-known Roman vessels. The northern barbarians\r\nwere as great drinkers as fighters, and their literature recites with\r\nequal zest the richness of their drinking cups as the power and deadly\r\nqualities of their arms. Fortunately the practice of burying with the\r\ndead warrior all his property, or at least as much of it as he would be\r\nsupposed to need, has preserved to our day the actual vessels in use by\r\nthe pagan northmen who pervaded northern Europe from the 4th century\r\nonward. Saxon graves in Britain have furnished great numbers of drinking\r\ncups and horns, in many cases quite unbroken. From the remains, of which\r\nthe chief series are in the British and Liverpool Museums, we can learn\r\na great deal to amplify the references in literature. The richest single\r\ninterment that has yet been found was within the present churchyard at\r\nTaplow. Here under a huge mound lay buried a Saxon chieftain surrounded\r\nby his belongings; arms defensive and offensive, his drinking cups, and\r\neven his game of draughts. The drinking vessels consisted of five cows'\r\nhorns and four glass cups. The former were of great size, 2 ft. long,\r\nrichly mounted at the mouth and at the point with silver bands embossed\r\nand gilt. The glasses also were of great size and of a type familiar in\r\nSaxon interments. Each was of a trumpet shape, with a small foot, while\r\nthe sides were ornamented with hollow pointed tubes bent downwards, and\r\nopen on the inner side, so that the liquid would fill them. Such a plan\r\nis most unpractical, and it must have been very difficult to keep the\r\nvessels clean. Glasses of this uncommon form have not been found\r\nelsewhere than in Saxon graves, either in England or in the north of the\r\ncontinent. Other types are perhaps nearly as characteristic, though of\r\nsimpler construction. One of these is a simple cone of glass, sometimes\r\nquite plain, at others ornamented with an applied spiral glass thread,\r\nor more rarely with festoons of white glass embedded in the body of the\r\nvessel. A third form is a plain cup or bowl widely expanded at the mouth\r\nand with a rounded base, so that it could only be set down when empty,\r\nin fact a true \"tumbler.\" This feature is in fact a very common one in\r\nthe drinking vessels of the Saxon race. There are many other varieties,\r\nplain cylindrical goblets, generally with ornamental glass threads on\r\nthe outside, and a more usual type has a rounded body somewhat of the\r\nshape of an orange with a wide plain mouth. Many of all these classes\r\nwere found in the famous cemetery known as the King's Field at Faversham\r\nin Kent (the relics from which are now in the British Museum), at\r\nChessel Down in the Isle of Wight, and in the cemetery within the\r\nancient camp on High Down, near Worthing. In Belgium, France and Germany\r\nthe same types occur, and even as far north as Scandinavia, where they\r\nare found in association with Roman coins of the 4th century. On the\r\ncontinent, however, additional types are found that do not occur in\r\nBritain--one of these is a drinking glass in the form of a hunting horn\r\nwith glass threads forming an ornamental design on the outside. From the\r\nwide distribution of these types, it seems certain that they sprang\r\noriginally from a common centre, and the slender evidence available on\r\nthe subject seems to point to that centre having been somewhere on the\r\nlower Rhine. Although glass seems to have been popular and by no means\r\nrare as a material for drinking vessels, other materials also were used.\r\nA large number of the smaller pottery vessels would serve such a\r\npurpose, and in one grave at Broomfield in Essex two small wooden cups\r\nwere found which, from their small size and thinness, were no doubt used\r\nfor liquid.\r\n\r\nOf the later Saxon domestic utensils nothing remains, the habit of\r\nburying such objects with the dead having ceased on the gradual\r\nintroduction of Christianity through the country. Manuscripts are our\r\nonly resource, and they are not only of great rarity, but in the main\r\nrudely and conventionally drawn in their details. In those of the 9th to\r\nthe 11th century various simple forms are seen, some resembling our\r\nmodern tumbler in shape, others like a dice box. Horns as drinking\r\nvessels certainly retained their popularity at all times, surviving\r\nespecially among the northern nations, and many of the vessels of this\r\nform were no doubt actual horns, though horn-shaped vessels were often\r\nmade of other materials. Until we come to the 13th and 14th centuries\r\nthere is an absolute dearth of the actual objects used in domestic life.\r\nAnd here we begin with plate used in the service of the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Church vessels.\r\n\r\nThe drinking vessel possessing the most unbroken history is doubtless\r\nthe chalice of the Christian Church.[4] Like other ceremonial objects it\r\nwas no doubt differentiated from the drinking cups in ordinary use by a\r\ngradual transition, and in the early centuries it is unlikely that it\r\ndiffered either in form or material from the ordinary domestic vessel of\r\nthe time. Figures of such vessels, apparently with a symbolic intention,\r\nare found upon early Christian tombstones, and it has been contended\r\nthat the vessel indicated the grave of a priest. While this may be the\r\ncase, the similarity of the vessel represented to the ordinary\r\nnon-liturgical form renders the conclusion somewhat weak. Among objects\r\nfound under conditions which lend colour to their specific use as\r\nchalices are the bottoms of glass vessels found inserted in plaster in\r\nthe Catacombs at Rome; but here again the Jesuit Padre Garrucci was\r\nunable to find any evidence to support such a conclusion. It is not in\r\nfact until the 6th century that the sacred vessel would appear to have\r\nassumed a definite form. From about that time date the lost golden\r\nchalices of Monza, representations of which still exist in that city;\r\nand the famous chalice of Gourdon in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris\r\nis probably of about the same time. All of these are two-handled with a\r\nvase-shaped body and supported on a high foot; and thus quite unlike the\r\nmore recent medieval types. Two glass vases of exactly this two-handled\r\nform are in the Slade collection at the British Museum, and may well\r\nhave been chalices. Another chalice, in the same collection, of the 6th\r\nor 7th century, was found with a silver treasure at Lampsacus on the\r\nHellespont. It is of silver, with a cylindrical body and small expanding\r\nfoot; with it were found a number of silver spoons and dishes, the\r\nformer inscribed with the names of Apostles, Greek hexameters and lines\r\nfrom Virgil's Eclogues. No doubt the whole was the treasure of a\r\nmonastery, buried and never reclaimed. So far as evidence exists for the\r\nform of the chalice, the vase-shape with two handles seems to have been\r\nmainly succeeded by a goblet with straight sides and without handles;\r\nthese latter in great part disappeared. Then came the rounded cup-shaped\r\nbowl as seen in the well-known Kremsmünster chalice. An interesting\r\nsilver vessel, probably a chalice, found at Trewhiddle in Cornwall, is\r\nin the British Museum. It is of plain semi-oviform shape, and dates from\r\nthe 9th century. The 13th century chalice was usually a broad somewhat\r\nshallow cup, on a conical base, and squat in its general lines as\r\ncompared with those of later date. These gradually became taller, and\r\nwith a bowl smaller in proportion, following the tendency of the civil\r\nvessels towards more elegant lines. Both civil and religious vessels\r\neventually carried this tendency to an extreme point, so that in the\r\n17th century the continental chalices and standing cups had lost all\r\nsense of true artistic proportions; the bowl of the chalice had greatly\r\nshrunk in size while the foot had become huge and highly elaborate, both\r\nin general form and in ornamental details. In Britain chalices ceased to\r\nbe used in the English church in the reign of Edward VI., and were\r\nreplaced by communion cups. These were much plainer in make, recalling\r\nin their outlines the goblet form of about a thousand years earlier, the\r\nsides of the bowl being concave, or nearly straight, as opposed to the\r\nconvexity of the chalice, while the paten was reversed over the mouth\r\nand so arranged as to form a closely fitting cover. With the beginning\r\nof the 17th century English communion cups again followed the civil\r\nfashion in adapting the outline of the Venetian drinking glass, a shape\r\nwhich has survived to our own days.\r\n\r\nThe materials of which chalices were made in the early centuries seem to\r\nhave been as various as those of ordinary vessels. Glass was undoubtedly\r\na favourite substance, perhaps from its lending itself readily to\r\nscrupulous cleanliness; but wood, horn, ivory and similar materials were\r\nundoubtedly in use, and were from time to time condemned as improper by\r\nthe Fathers of the Church. Pewter was in common use, and it was not an\r\nunusual practice in the 12th and 13th centuries to place sacramental\r\nvessels, of this or more precious metal, in the grave of an\r\necclesiastic. Bronze was also used, and the Kremsmünster chalice is of\r\nthat metal, which was a favourite one in the Celtic church. But gold or\r\nsilver chalices were no doubt always preferred when they could be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that it was a common practice in the 16th\r\ncentury and later in England for laymen to make gifts to the church of\r\nvessels of an entirely domestic character for use in the service. Many\r\nof these from their associations, and in the character of the designs\r\nupon them, were entirely unsuited for such purposes, and in our own\r\ntime, when a healthy desire has sprung up for the proper investigation\r\nof such matters, many such unsuitable vessels have been withdrawn from\r\nuse. Domestic plate, however, being much more highly appreciated by\r\ncollectors, there has been a regrettable tendency on the part of the\r\nholders of such pieces to sell them to the highest bidders; the tendency\r\nis to be deplored, for while they remain the property of the church,\r\nthey are a national asset; if sold by auction, there is a great\r\nprobability of their going abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Medieval vessels for common uses.\r\n\r\n  Mazers.\r\n\r\nIt would seem fairly certain that the ordinary drinking vessel of\r\nmedieval times was, like the trenchers of wood, turned on the lathe. Of\r\nthese the commoner varieties have entirely disappeared, having become\r\nuseless from distortion or other damage. Such as have come down to our\r\nown time owe their preservation to the added refinement of a silver\r\nmount. Vessels of this kind are known as _mazer_ bowls, a word of\r\nuncertain origin, but undoubtedly, in the medieval sense, indicating\r\nwood of some more or less valuable kind, and not improbably, in the 16th\r\ncentury, maple or a wood of that appearance. Spenser in the \"Shepherd's\r\nKalendar\" speaks of \"a mazer ywrought of the maple warre.\" Although such\r\nvessels are mentioned in the inventories and other contemporary records\r\nas far back as the 12th century, no example is known to exist of an\r\nearlier date than the 14th century, of which date there are two in the\r\npossession of Harbledown hospital. This type of drinking vessel was in\r\ncommon use in well-to-do households until the 16th century, when a\r\nchange of fashion and the greater luxury and refinement dictated the\r\nadoption of more elegant and complex forms. The ordinary mazer was a\r\nshallow bowl (see PLATE, Plate II.) about 6 in. in diameter, with a\r\nbroad expanding rim of silver gilt often engraved with a motto in black\r\nletter or Lombardic capitals, at times referring to the function of the\r\ncup, such as:--\r\n\r\n  \"In the name of the Trinity\r\n   Fille the Kup and drinke to me.\"\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  \"Potum et nos benedicat Agios.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the bowl, in the centre is often found a circular medallion\r\ncalled a \"print\" with some device upon it, engraved and filled with\r\nenamel. The reason of this addition may conceivably be found in the fact\r\nthat such bowls were sometimes made from the lower half of a gourd or\r\ncalabash, in the centre of which would be a rough projection whence the\r\nfibres of the fruit had diverged. A rarer form of mazer has the\r\ncharacters just mentioned and in addition is mounted upon a high foot,\r\nbringing it nearer to the category of standing cups or \"hanaps.\" The\r\nfamous Scrope mazer belonging to York Minster (early 15th century)\r\nstands upon three small feet. Of the hanap type examples are in the\r\npossession of Pembroke College, Cambridge (the Foundress' Cup), and All\r\nSouls' College, Oxford, the former an exceedingly fine specimen, of the\r\nthird quarter of the 15th century. The form dictated originally by the\r\nsimple wooden cup was at times carried out entirely in silver, or even\r\nin stone, mazer-like cups being found either entirely in metal or with\r\nthe main portion made of serpentine or some other ornamental stone. An\r\nexample of the former from the Hamilton Palace collection, as well as\r\nseveral ordinary mazers, are to be seen in the British Museum. The types\r\nabove described are of English origin, with the exception of that made\r\nentirely of silver, which is thought to be French. Most of the\r\ncontinental forms differed from the English, and were more elaborately\r\nfinished. One of the finest is that which belonged to Louis de Male,\r\nlast count of Flanders. It is an exceedingly thin, shallow bowl of\r\nfine-grained wood, with a cover of the same make. The latter is\r\nsurmounted by a silver figure of a falcon holding a shield in its mouth\r\nwith the arms of the count. The foot is of silver with lozenge-shaped\r\npanels inserted, bearing in enamel the arms of the count. A German form\r\nof the 16th century consisted of a depressed sphere of wood for the\r\nbowl, with a silver rim, and a cover formed of a similarly shaped\r\nsphere, called in France a \"creusequin.\" Such mazers were furnished in\r\naddition with a short metal handle turned up at the end, a feature\r\nunknown in the English types. All of these again are to be seen in the\r\nBritish Museum series.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hanaps.\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of wooden vessels more or less elaborately mounted was\r\ncontinued well into the 16th century as a fashion, many other materials\r\nof far greater value were in use among the wealthy long before that\r\ntime. Crystal, agate and other hard stones, ivory, Chinese porcelain, as\r\nwell as more ordinary wares, were all in use, as well as the precious\r\nmetals. The inventories of the 14th and 15th centuries are full of\r\nentries showing that such precious cups were fairly common. Of gold cups\r\nof any antiquity naturally but few remain; the intrinsic value of the\r\nmetal probably is a sufficient explanation. One of the most important in\r\nexistence is however preserved in the British Museum, viz. the royal\r\ngold cup of the kings of England and France. It is of nearly pure gold\r\nwith a broad bowl and a high foot, the cover pyramidal. The whole is\r\nornamented with translucent enamels of the most perfect quality, and\r\nwith a little damage in one part, absolutely well preserved. The\r\nsubjects represented on it are scenes from the life of St Agnes, in two\r\nrows, one on the cover and one outside the bowl; on the foot are the\r\nsymbols of the four Evangelists, and around the base a coronal of leaves\r\nalternating with pearls; the cover originally had a similar adjunct, but\r\nit has unfortunately been cut away. This is the only piece of royal\r\nplate of the treasures of the kings of England and France that now\r\nremains, and its history has been traced from the time it was made,\r\nabout the year 1380, to the present time. It was made by one of the\r\ngoldsmiths of the luxurious Duc de Berri, the brother of Charles V. of\r\nFrance, no doubt to offer as a gift to the king, whose  birthday was\r\nSt Agnes' day. It was, however, never presented, probably owing to the\r\ndeath of Charles V. in 1380. The duc de Berri was not on friendly terms\r\nwith his nephew Charles VI., but on their being reconciled he presented\r\nthe young king with this cup. The troubles of his reign led to the\r\ninvasion of France by Henry V. of England, and the ultimate appointment\r\nof his brother, John, duke of Bedford, as regent. The necessities of the\r\nhalf-insane Charles doubtless caused this cup and other valuables to\r\npass into the possession of the regent in exchange for ready money, for\r\nit appears in the duke of Bedford's will, under which it passed into the\r\ntreasury of Henry VI. There it remained and appears in all subsequent\r\nroyal inventories up to the time of James I. This monarch, whose motto\r\nwas \"Beati pacifici,\" received with joy the embassy sent from Spain in\r\nthe year 1610 to conclude the first treaty of peace with England since\r\nthe Armada, and showered upon the envoy, Don Juan de Velasco, constable\r\nof Castile, the most lavish and extravagant gifts. The constable, in\r\nfact, was so impressed by the warmth of his reception that he printed an\r\naccount of his embassy, and from this work the main story of the cup has\r\neventually been traced. On his return to Spain the constable, a piously\r\ndisposed man, presented this cup, with many other valuable gifts, to the\r\nconvent of Santa Clara Medina de Pomar at Burgos, of which his sister\r\nwas Superior. Although it was a domestic vessel, a \"hanap\" in fact, the\r\nconstable elected that it should be consecrated and made use of as a\r\nchalice at great festivals. And so it continued to be used from the\r\nearly years of the 17th century until about the year 1882, when the\r\nconvent having fallen upon evil times, it was decided to sell this\r\nprecious relic. A priest from the Argentine being at the time in Burgos,\r\nit was confided to him to sell in Paris, and he deposited the sum of\r\n£100 by way of security. This was all that the unfortunate nuns at\r\nBurgos ever received in return for their chalice, for they never saw the\r\npriest again. He took the cup to Paris, arriving in the month of\r\nSeptember, when the majority of the well-to-do are away from town. After\r\nmany failures to dispose of it, he ultimately succeeded in selling it to\r\nBaron Jerome Pichon for the sum of about £400, practically its weight in\r\ngold. The baron, after vainly trying to resell it at various sums from\r\n£20,000 downwards, eventually parted with it to Messrs Wertheimer of\r\nBond Street for £8000, and that firm very liberally ceded it to Sir\r\nWollaston Franks for the same sum, and it was finally secured by a\r\nsubscription for the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--ROMAN GLASS CUP.

Eighteenth\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of one of the most remarkable \"hanaps\" in existence.\r\nThe word \"hanap\" is translated by Cotgrave in his French dictionary of\r\n1660 as \"a drinking cup or goblet,\" and probably was intended to mean\r\nwhat would be called a standing cup, that is, raised on a foot, to\r\ndistinguish it from a bowl of the mazer class. Such vessels were chiefly\r\nused to ornament the dinner table or sideboard, in the way that\r\nloving-cups are now used at civic banquets, where, almost alone in fact,\r\nthe ancient ceremonial of the table is still observed to some extent;\r\nand the loving-cup is the direct descendant of the hanap of the middle\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nefs.\r\n\r\nOf all the ornaments of the table in medieval times the most conspicuous\r\nwas probably the \"nef.\" This was in the form of a ship (_navis_), as its\r\nname implies, and originally was designed to hold the table utensils of\r\nthe host--knives, napkins, and at times even the wine. Some of the later\r\nexamples which alone survive are carried out with the greatest\r\nelaboration, the sails and rigging being carefully finished and with a\r\nnumber of figures on the deck. The reason for the existence of such an\r\narticle of table furniture was doubtless the fear of poison. As in\r\ncourse of time this became less, the nef changed its character, and\r\nbecame either a mere ornament, or sometimes was capable of being used as\r\na drinking vessel. The former, however, was much more common, and the\r\nnumber of nefs that can be practically used as drinking cups is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n  16th-century types.\r\n\r\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries the shapes, decoration and materials of\r\ndrinking vessels were almost endless. A favourite object to be so\r\nadapted was an ostrich egg, and many can be seen in museums in elaborate\r\nsilver mounts; coco-nuts were also used in the same way, and Chinese\r\nand other Oriental wares then of great variety, were often turned into\r\ncups and vases by ingeniously devised silver mounting. The use of\r\ndrinking vessels either formed of actual horns or of other materials was\r\ncommon in the 15th and 16th centuries, especially in the north. They\r\nwere usually provided with feet so as to serve as standing cups, and\r\nsome of them were mounted with great richness. An excellent example is\r\nthe famous drinking-horn in the possession of Queen's College, Oxford,\r\ndating from the 14th century. The medieval beliefs about \"griffins'\r\nclaws\" still survived to this late date, and a horn cup in the British\r\nMuseum bears the inscription \"Ein Greifen Klau bin ich genannt, In Asia,\r\nAfrica wohl bekannt.\" Another horn, probably that of an ibex, is in the\r\nsame institution, and has a silver mount inscribed \"Gryphi unguis divo\r\nCuthberto dunelmensi sacer.\" The elegant natural curve of the horn adds\r\ngreatly to the charm of the vessel. In Germany the ingenuity of the\r\nsilversmith was turned in the direction of making vessels in the forms\r\nof animals, at times in allusion to the coat of arms of the patron.\r\nStags, lions, bears and various birds are often found; the head\r\ngenerally removable so as to form a small cup Switzerland and south\r\nGermany had a special type, in the form of the figure of a peasant,\r\ngenerally in wood, carrying on his back a large basket, which edged with\r\nsilver formed the drinking cup. This type is only found in wine-growing\r\ndistricts, the basket being used for carrying grapes. In Germany such\r\ncups are called \"Buttenmann,\" in Switzerland \"Tanzenmann.\" The royal and\r\nprincely museums of Germany contain great numbers of such vessels, the\r\nGreen Vault in Dresden in particular, while a good number are to be seen\r\nin our own great museums. A curious fancy, combining instruction with\r\nconviviality, was to make cups in the form of a globe, terrestrial or\r\ncelestial, which are still useful as showing the state of geographical\r\nor astronomical knowledge at the time. Several of those made in the 16th\r\ncentury are still in existence, one in the British Museum, a second at\r\nNancy, and others are in Copenhagen and Zurich and in private\r\ncollections. The upper half of the globe is removable, leaving the lower\r\nas the drinking cup. Ivory both from the beauty of its colour and the\r\nevenness of its structure has been a favourite material for drinking\r\nvessels at all times, and would seem to have been continuously used from\r\nthe earliest period, whether derived from Asia or Africa, while the\r\nsemi-fossil mammoth ivory of Siberia has not been neglected. In general,\r\nhowever, the vessels made from this material presented no essential\r\ndifferences of form from those in wood, until the art of lathe-turning\r\nattained great perfection, when a wide field was opened for ingenuity\r\nand even extravagance of form. The most remarkable examples of the\r\npossibilities of this kind of mechanical skill are seen in the\r\nproductions of the Nuremberg turners of the 17th century, whose\r\nelaborate and entirely useless _tours de force_ comprise among many\r\nother things standing cups of ivory sometimes 2 ft. high, exemplifying\r\nevery eccentricity of which the lathe is capable. Peter Zick (d. 1632)\r\nand his three sons were celebrated for such work. Several pieces,\r\ndoubtless from their hands, are in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Glass cups.\r\n\r\nThe use of glass cups was not common in England until the 16th century,\r\nVenice having practically the monopoly of the supply. A silver-mounted\r\nglass goblet which belonged to the great Lord Burghley is, however, in\r\nthe British Museum, where there is also a very large series of Venetian\r\ndrinking glasses of various kinds, clear and lace glass as well as some\r\nof the 15th-century goblets with enamelled designs, now of the greatest\r\nrarity. The relations of Venice with the East were of so intimate a\r\ncharacter that the earlier forms of Venetian glasses were nearly\r\nidentical with those of the Mahommedan East.\r\n\r\nA common type of Arab drinking glass resembled our modern tumbler (a\r\nbeaker), but gradually expanding in a curve towards the mouth, and often\r\nenamelled. The enamelled designs were at times related to the purpose of\r\nthe vessel, figures drinking and the like, but more commonly bore either\r\na mark of ownership, such as the armorial device of an emir, or some\r\nsimple decorative design. This simple form probably has its origin in\r\nthe horn cup made from the base of a cow's horn and closed at the\r\nsmaller end. The later forms in the late 15th century and after,\r\nfollowed the fashion in other materials, and were raised on a tall foot,\r\nso that from the 16th century onwards the type of wine glass has hardly\r\nchanged, except in details. An interesting variety in one detail is seen\r\nin the German fashion of providing an elaborate silver stand into which\r\nthe foot of such an ordinary-shaped glass was made to fit. Frequently,\r\nas might be expected, such stands are found without glasses, and their\r\nuse then seems difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic German type is the \"wiederkom,\" a vessel more\r\nconspicuous for capacity than for its artistic qualities. It is usually\r\na cylindrical vessel of green glass often holding as much as a quart,\r\nelaborately enamelled with coats of arms and views of well-known places;\r\nand at times when the cup was a wedding gift the figures of the bride\r\nand bridegroom are seen upon it.\r\n\r\nA very fanciful kind of cup was known in England as a \"yard of ale,\" a\r\nlong tube of glass generally shaped like a coach horn, but ending\r\nsometimes in three prongs as a trident, the opening in the latter being\r\nat the end of the handle, which was about a yard in length.\r\n\r\nSmall silver cups were often made in dozens with various devices,\r\ndiffering in each, such as the signs of the zodiac, the occupations of\r\nthe months, or figures of the classical gods and goddesses, engraved\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nThe tankard came into fashion in the 16th century, a practical, but\r\nseldom graceful object. At first some attempt was made, by shaping the\r\nsides, to attain to some artistic quality, but usually the tankard from\r\nthe late 16th century to the present time is found with straight sides,\r\neither vertical or contracting towards the top, which is of course\r\nalways furnished with a hinged lid.\r\n\r\n\r\n  17th and 18th century types.\r\n\r\nA material that has one obvious merit, that of being practically\r\nunbreakable, is leather, and drinking cups were often made of it. The\r\nflagon called a \"black jack\" is the best-known, and examples are very\r\ncommon, mostly of the 17th and 18th centuries. A quaint fashion was to\r\nhave a leather cup made in the form of a lady's shoe; this, however, was\r\nconfined to Germany and might be thought in somewhat questionable taste.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries a great impetus was given to the\r\nproduction of curious drinking vessels in pottery. In England at various\r\npotting centres a great number of cups called \"tygs\" were made:\r\ncapacious mugs with several handles, three or four, round the sides, so\r\nthat the cup could be readily passed from one to the other. Many of\r\nthese have quaint devices and inscriptions upon them. Another favourite\r\nplan is to make a jug with open-work round the neck and a variety of\r\nspouts, one only communicating with the liquid. These \"puzzle jugs\" no\r\ndoubt caused a good deal of amusement when attempted by a novice, who\r\nwould inevitably spill some of the contents.\r\n\r\nThe horn of the rhinoceros is much favoured by the Chinese as a material\r\nfor drinking cups often of a somewhat archaic form. The dense structure\r\nof the horn is well adapted for the purpose, and its beautiful amber hue\r\nmakes the vessel a very agreeable object to the eye. The usual form is\r\nof a boat shape on a square foot, and the carved decoration is often\r\ncopied from that of the bronze vessels of the earlier dynasties. Others\r\nare treated in a freer and more naturalistic manner, the bowl being\r\nformed as the flower of the magnolia, and the entire horn, at times more\r\nthan 2 ft. in length, is utilized in carrying out the design. One of\r\nthis kind is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Cups of the former type\r\nare commonly found imitated in ivory-white porcelain, and are known as\r\n\"libation cups.\" Rhinoceros horn is held by the Chinese to be an\r\nantidote against poison, a belief shared by other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tea and coffee cups.\r\n\r\nThere is but little to be said about the vessels used in the drinking of\r\ntea and coffee. In Europe the type has practically remained unchanged\r\nsince the introduction of tea and coffee drinking, except that in the\r\n18th century the tea-cups imported from China had no handles, and were\r\ngenerally thinner than the coffee cups. In Japan there is a ceremonious\r\nway of drinking tea, known as _Cha no yu_. Here powdered green tea is\r\nused; the party assembles in a small pavilion in a garden, and the tea\r\nis made in accordance with a rigid etiquette. The infusion is stirred\r\nwith a whisk in a rudely fashioned bowl, holding about a pint, and\r\npassed from one guest to another. The bowls are of very thick pottery,\r\nnever of porcelain, and the most valued kind is that made in Korea. In\r\nthe drinking of rice spirit (saké) in Japan small wide shallow cups are\r\nused, made generally of porcelain, but sometimes of finely lacquered\r\nwood. Both kinds are usually ornamented with elaborate and sometimes\r\nallusive designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Savage utensils.\r\n\r\nAmong savage races the most peculiar drinking ceremony is that of kava\r\ndrinking in Polynesia, principally in the Fijian, Tongan and Samoan\r\ngroups. The best description of the process is given in Mariner's\r\n_Tonga_. The principal vessel is usually a large bowl, sometimes\r\nmeasuring 2 or 3 ft. in diameter, cut from a solid block of wood. It has\r\nfour short legs and an ear at one side to which a rope of coco-nut fibre\r\nis generally attached. The liquid is prepared in this bowl and ladled\r\nout in small cups often made of coco-nut shells, and these are handed\r\nround with great ceremony. Both the bowl and the cups become coated in\r\nthe inside with a highly polished layer, pale blue in colour; but this\r\nbeautiful tint fades when the vessel is out of use, and it is therefore\r\nvery rarely seen in specimens in Europe. The kava itself is prepared\r\nfrom the root of a tree of the pepper family (_Piper methysticum_); the\r\nroot is cut into pieces of a convenient size, and these are given to\r\nyoung men and women of the company, who masticate them, and the lumps\r\nthus shredded are placed in the large bowl, water is poured over them,\r\nand the mass is strained with great care by wringing it in strips of the\r\ninner bark of the _hibiscus_. The liquor is slightly intoxicating.\r\n\r\nIf the Polynesian method of preparing kava as a drink is distasteful to\r\nour ideas, the favourite drinking bowl of the old Tibetans is even more\r\nso. Friar Odoric (14th century), quoted by Yule, describes how the\r\nTibetan youth \"takes his father's head and straightway cooks and eats\r\nit, and of the skull he makes a goblet from which he and all his family\r\nalways drink devoutly to the memory of the deceased father.\" This\r\nrecalls Livy's account of the Boii in Upper Italy, who made a drinking\r\nvessel of the head of the Roman consul Postumus. Among the Tibetans\r\nskulls are still used, but generally for libations only; for this\r\npurpose great care is exercised in the selection of the skull, and the\r\n\"points\" of a good skull are well understood by the Lamas.\r\n     (C.

He graduated at\r\nColumbia College in 1839, taught classics in the Columbia grammar school\r\nfor four years, and was then appointed tutor in classics in the college.\r\nIn 1845 he became adjunct professor of Latin and Greek there, in 1857\r\nwas appointed to the new separate chair of Latin language and\r\nliterature, and ten years later succeeded Dr Charles Anthon as Jay\r\nprofessor of Greek language and literature. He was acting president in\r\n1867 and in 1888-1889, and from 1890 to his retirement as professor\r\nemeritus in 1894 was dean of the school of arts. He died in New York\r\nCity on the 30th of November 1897. Dr Drisler completed and supplemented\r\nDr Anthon's labours as an editor of classical texts. His criticisms and\r\ncorrections of Liddell and Scott's _Greek-English Lexicon_, of which he\r\nbrought out a revised American edition in 1846, won his name a place on\r\nthe title-page of the British edition in 1879, and in 1870 he published\r\na revised and enlarged edition of Yonge's _English-Greek Lexicon_. He\r\nwas ardently opposed to slavery, and brilliantly refuted _The Bible View\r\nof Slavery_, written by Bishop J. H. Hopkins of Vermont, in a _Reply_\r\n(1863), which meets the bishop on purely Biblical ground and displays\r\nthe wide range of Dr Drisler's scholarship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIVER, SAMUEL ROLLES (1846-   ), English divine and Hebrew scholar, was\r\nborn at Southampton on the 2nd of October 1846. He was educated at\r\nWinchester and New College, Oxford, where he had a distinguished career,\r\ntaking a first class in Literae Humaniores in 1869. He was awarded the\r\nPusey and Ellerton scholarship in 1866, the Kennicott scholarship in\r\n1870 (both Hebrew), and the Houghton Syriac prize in 1872. From 1870 he\r\nwas a fellow, and from 1875 also a tutor, of New College, and in 1883\r\nsucceeded Pusey as regius professor of Hebrew and canon of Christ\r\nChurch. He was a member of the Old Testament Revision Committee\r\n(1876-1884) and examining chaplain to the bishop of Southwell\r\n(1884-1904); received the honorary degrees of doctor of literature of\r\nDublin (1892), doctor of divinity of Glasgow (1901), doctor of\r\nliterature of Cambridge (1905); and was elected a fellow of the British\r\nAcademy in 1902. Dr Driver devoted his life to the study, both textual\r\nand critical, of the Old Testament. Among his numerous works are\r\ncommentaries on Joel and Amos (1897); Deuteronomy (1902); Daniel (1901);\r\nGenesis (1909); the Minor Prophets, Nahum to Malachi (1905); Job (1905);\r\nJeremiah (1906); Leviticus (1894 Hebrew text, 1898 trans. and notes);\r\nSamuel (Hebrew text, 1890). Among his more general works are: _Treatise\r\non the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew_ (1892); _Isaiah, his Life and Times_\r\n(1893); _Introd. to the Literature of the Old Test._ (1897, ed. 1909);\r\n_Sermons on Subjects connected with the Old Testament_ (1892); _The\r\nParallel Psalter_ (1904); _Heb. and Eng. Lexicon of the O.T._ (in\r\ncollaboration, 1906); _Modern Research as illustrating the Bible_\r\n(1909); articles in the _Ency. Brit._, _Ency. Bibl._ and Hastings'\r\n_Dict. of the Bible_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIVING (from \"to drive,\" i.e. generally to propel, force along or in, a\r\nword common in various forms to the Teutonic languages), a word used in\r\na restricted sense for the art of controlling and directing draught\r\nanimals from a coach or other conveyance or movable machine to which\r\nthey are harnessed for the purpose of traction. This has been an\r\noccupation practised since domesticated animals were first put to this\r\nuse. In various parts of the world a number of different animals have\r\nbeen, and still are, so employed; of these the horse, ox, mule and ass\r\nare the most common, though their place is taken by the reindeer in\r\nnorthern latitudes, and by the Eskimo dog in arctic and antarctic\r\nregions. The driving of each of these requires special skill, only to be\r\nacquired by practice combined with knowledge of the characteristics\r\npeculiar to the several animals employed. The most accomplished driver\r\nof spirited horses would probably be in difficulties if called upon to\r\ndrive sixteen or twenty dogs in an arctic sledge, or a team of oxen or\r\nmules drawing the guns of a mountain battery; and the adept in either of\r\nthese branches of the art might provoke the compassion of a farmer from\r\nLincolnshire or Texas by his attempts to manage a pair of Clydesdale\r\nhorses in the plough or the reaping machine.\r\n\r\nUnder all these different conditions driving is a work of utility, of\r\neconomic value to civilized society. But from very early times driving,\r\nespecially of horses, has also been regarded as a sport or pastime. This\r\nprobably arose in the first instance from its association with battle.\r\nIn the earliest historical records, such as the Old Testament and the\r\nHomeric poems, the driver of the chariot fills a place of importance in\r\nthe economy of war; and on his skill and efficiency the fate of kings,\r\nand even of kingdoms, must often have depended. The statement in the\r\nBook of Kings that Jehu the son of Nimshi was recognized from a distance\r\nby his style of driving appears to indicate that the warrior himself on\r\noccasion took the place of the professional charioteer; and although it\r\nwould be unsafe to infer from the story that the pleasure derived from\r\nthe occupation was his motive for doing so, the name of this king of\r\nIsrael has become the eponym of drivers. Among the Greeks at an equally\r\nearly period driving was a recognized form of sport, to the popularity\r\nof which Horace afterwards made allusion. Racing between teams of horses\r\nharnessed to war-chariots took the place occupied by saddle-horse\r\nracing and American trotting races (see HORSE-RACING) in the sport of\r\nmodern times. The element of danger doubtless gave pleasurable\r\nexcitement to chariot racing and kept alive its association with\r\nincidents familiar in war; just as at a later period, when the\r\ninstitution of chivalry had given the armed knight on horseback a\r\nconspicuous place in medieval warfare, the tournament became the most\r\npopular sport of the aristocracy throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThis element of danger cannot be said to enter usually into the\r\nenjoyment of driving at the present day. Though accidents occasionally\r\nhappen, the pastime is practically unattended by serious risk; and the\r\nsource of the pleasure it affords the driver must be sought in the skill\r\nit requires, combined with the love of the horse which is common to\r\nsportsmen, and of exercise of power. The art of driving as practised\r\nto-day for pleasure without profit, and without the excitement of\r\nracing, is of quite modern development. Oliver Cromwell, indeed, met\r\nwith a mishap in Hyde Park while driving a team of four horses presented\r\nto him by the count of Oldenburg, which was the subject of more than one\r\nsatirical allusion by contemporary royalist writers; but two things were\r\nneeded before much enjoyment could be found in driving apart from\r\nutility. These were the invention of carriages on springs, and the\r\nconstruction of roads with smooth and solid surface. The former did not\r\ncome into general use till near the end of the 18th century, and it was\r\nabout the same period that the engineering skill of Thomas Telford and\r\nthe invention of John London Macadam combined to provide the latter. The\r\ninfluence on driving of these two developments was soon apparent.\r\nThroughout the 18th century stage-coaches, ponderous unwieldy vehicles\r\nwithout springs, had toiled slowly over rough and deeply rutted tracks\r\nas a means of communication between different parts of Great Britain;\r\nbut those who made use of them did so as a matter of necessity and not\r\nfor enjoyment. But by the beginning of the 19th century the improvement\r\nin carriage-building and road-construction alike had greatly diminished\r\nthe discomfort of travel; and interest in driving for its own sake grew\r\nso rapidly that in 1807 the first association of amateur coachmen was\r\nformed. This was the Bensington Driving Club, the forerunner of many\r\naristocratic clubs for gentlemen interested in driving as a pastime.\r\n\r\nIn modern driving one, two or four horses are usually employed. When a\r\ngreater number than four is put in harness, as in the case of the state\r\nequipages of royal personages on occasions of ceremony, the horses are\r\nnot driven but are controlled by \"postillions\" mounted on the near-side\r\nhorse of each pair. When two horses are used they may either be placed\r\nside by side, in \"double harness,\" which is the commoner mode of driving\r\na pair of horses, or one following the other, in a \"tandem.\" Four\r\nhorses, or \"four-in-hand,\" are harnessed in two pairs, one following the\r\nother, and called respectively the \"leaders\" and the \"wheelers\"--the\r\nsame terms being used for the two horses of a tandem.\r\n\r\nThough it is a less difficult accomplishment to drive a single horse\r\nthan a tandem or four-in-hand, or even a pair, it nevertheless requires\r\nboth knowledge and the skill that practice alone confers. The driver\r\nshould have some knowledge of equine character, and complete familiarity\r\nwith every part of the harness he uses, and with the purpose which each\r\nbuckle or strap is intended to serve. The indefinable quality known in\r\nhorsemanship as \"good hands\" is scarcely less desirable on the box-seat\r\nthan in the saddle. It is often said to be unattainable by those who do\r\nnot possess it by nature; but though this may be true to some extent,\r\n\"good hands\" are partly at least the result of learning the correct\r\nposition for the arm and hand that holds the reins. The reins are held\r\nin the left hand, which should be kept at about the level of the lowest\r\nbutton of the driver's waistcoat, and near the body though not pressed\r\nagainst it. The driving hand should never be reached forward more than a\r\nfew inches, nor raised as high as the breast. The upper arm should lie\r\nloosely against the side, the forearm horizontal across the front of the\r\nbody, forming a right angle or thereabouts at the elbow-joint, the\r\nwrist very slightly bent inwards, and the back of the hand and knuckles\r\nfacing outwards towards the horses. In this position the three joints of\r\nthe arm form a kind of automatic spring that secures the \"give\" to the\r\nmovement of the horse's mouth which, in conjunction with firmness, is a\r\nlarge part of what is meant by \"good hands.\" But this result is only\r\nobtained if the reins be also held with the proper degree of bearing on\r\nthe bit. What the proper degree may be depends greatly on the character\r\nof the horses and the severity of the bit. Pulling horses must be\r\nrestrained by a strong draw on their bits, such as would bring other\r\nanimals to a standstill. But under no circumstances, no matter how\r\nsluggish the horses may be, should the reins be allowed to lie slack;\r\nfor if this is done the horse receives no support in the event of a\r\nsudden stumble, and no control if he shies unexpectedly. The driver\r\nshould therefore always just \"feel his horse's mouth\" as lightly as\r\npossible; he then has the animal well under control in readiness for\r\nevery emergency, while avoiding such a pull on the mouth as would cause\r\na high-spirited horse to chafe and fret. Well-broken carriage horses\r\nshould always be willing to run into their bits, and those that draw\r\nback when lightly held in hand should be kept up to the bit with the\r\nwhip.\r\n\r\nThese principles are common to all branches of the art of driving,\r\nwhether of one, two or four horses. When they are observed no great\r\ndifficulty confronts the coachman who is content with single or double\r\nharness, provided he has acquired the eye for pace and distance, and the\r\ninstinctive realization of the length of the carriage behind him,\r\nwithout which he may suffer collision with other vehicles, or allow\r\ninsufficient room in turning a corner or entering a gateway. For before\r\nhe can have had the practice by which alone this knowledge is to be\r\ngained, the beginner will have learnt such elementary facts as that his\r\nhorses must be held well in hand going down hill and given their heads\r\non an ascent, and that on no account should the horse's mouth be\r\n\"jobbed\" by the driver jerking the reins; he will also have learnt a\r\ngood deal about the character and temperament of the horse, on which so\r\nmuch of the art of driving depends, and which can best be studied on the\r\nbox-seat and not at all in the library. If he has pursued this study\r\nwith any degree of insight, he will have learnt further to be sparing in\r\nthe use of the hand-brake with which most modern carriages are provided.\r\nThis apparatus is most useful in case of emergency, or for taking weight\r\noff the carriage on a really steep descent; but the habit which too many\r\ncoachmen fall into of using the brake on every trifling decline should\r\nbe avoided. Its effect is that the horses are continually doing\r\ncollar-work, and are thus deprived of the relief which ought to be given\r\nthem by occasional light pole or shaft work instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tandem and four-in-hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the ambition of the amateur coachman leads him to attempt a tandem\r\nor four-in-hand he enters on a much more complex department of the art\r\nof driving. In the first place he has now four reins instead of two to\r\nmanipulate, and the increase of weight on his hand, especially when four\r\nhorses are being driven, requires considerable strength of wrist to\r\nsupport it without tiring. It is of the first importance, moreover, that\r\nhe should know instinctively the position in his hand of each of the\r\nreins, and be able automatically and instantaneously to lay a finger on\r\nany one of them. The driver who has to look at his reins to find the\r\noff-side leader's rein, or who touches the near-side wheeler's in\r\nmistake for it, is in peril of a catastrophe. It is therefore essential\r\nthat the reins should be correctly disposed between the fingers of the\r\nleft hand, and that the driver should as quickly as possible accustom\r\nhimself to handle them automatically. This is somewhat more difficult in\r\ndriving tandem than in driving four-in-hand, because in the latter case\r\nthere is greater spread of the reins in front of the hand than with\r\ntandem, where the reins lie much more nearly parallel one above the\r\nother. The actual holding of the reins is the same in both cases. The\r\ncoachman should be careful to take the reins in his hand before mounting\r\nto the box-seat, as otherwise his team may make a start without his\r\nhaving the means to control them. It is customary to hitch the reins,\r\nready for him to take them, on the outside terret (the ring on the pad\r\nthrough which the rein runs) of the wheeler--the off-side wheeler in\r\nfour-in-hand. Standing on the ground beside the off-side wheel of his\r\ncarriage, ready to mount to the box-seat, the coachman, after drawing up\r\nhis reins till he almost feels the horses' mouths, must then let out\r\nabout a foot of slack in his off-side reins, in order that when on his\r\nseat he may find all the reins as nearly as possible equal in length in\r\nhis hand. He mounts with them disposed in his right hand precisely as\r\nthey will be in his left when ready to start. The leaders' reins should\r\nbe separated by the forefinger, and the wheelers' by the middle finger.\r\nThe near-leader's rein will then be uppermost of the four, between the\r\nforefinger and thumb; then between the forefinger and middle finger are\r\ntwo reins together--the off-leader's and the near-wheeler's in the order\r\nnamed; while at the bottom, between the middle and third fingers, is the\r\noff-wheeler's rein. It will be found that held thus the reins spread\r\nimmediately in front of the hand in such a way that each several rein,\r\nand each pair of reins--two near-side, two off-side, two wheelers' or\r\ntwo leaders'--can be conveniently manipulated; and the proficient driver\r\ncan instinctively and instantaneously grasp any of them he chooses with\r\nhis right hand without having to turn his eyes from the road before him\r\nto the reins in his hand. Having seated himself on the box and\r\ntransferred the reins, thus disposed, from the right to the left hand,\r\nthe coachman should shorten them till he just feels his wheelers' mouths\r\nand holds back his leaders sufficiently to prevent them quite tightening\r\ntheir traces; then, when he has taken the whip from its socket in his\r\nright hand, he is ready to start. This is an operation requiring careful\r\nmanagement, to secure that leaders and wheelers start simultaneously;\r\nfor if the leaders start first they will be drawn up sharp by their\r\nbits, or, what is worse, if their reins have not been sufficiently\r\nshortened they will jump into their collars and possibly break a\r\nswinging bar, and in either case they will be fretted and disconcerted\r\nand will possibly in consequence either kick or rear; if the wheelers\r\nstart before the leaders they will ram the swinging bars under the tails\r\nof the latter, with results equally unfortunate. The worst possible\r\nmethod of starting is suddenly to give the horses their heads and use\r\nthe whip. But no positive rule can be laid down, for it is just one of\r\nthose points which depend largely on familiarity with the horses forming\r\nthe team. Horses even moderately accustomed to the work will generally\r\nstart best in obedience to the voice, and their attention may\r\nsimultaneously be aroused by gently feeling their mouths. When once\r\nstarted the driver should at once see that his team is going straight.\r\nIf the leaders and wheelers are not exactly on the same line, this or\r\nthat rein must be shortened or lengthened as the case may require; and\r\nit is to be noticed that as the near-wheeler's and off-leader's reins\r\nlie together between the same fingers, a simultaneous shortening or\r\nlengthening of these two reins will usually produce the desired result.\r\nWith rare exceptions, reins should be shortened or lengthened by pushing\r\nthem back or drawing them forward with the right hand from in front of\r\nthe driving hand, and not from behind it. As soon as the team is in\r\nmotion the leaders may be let out till they draw their traces taut; but\r\ndraught should be taken off them on falling ground or while rounding a\r\ncorner. Good drivers touch the reins as little as possible with the\r\nwhip-hand, and nothing is less workmanlike than for a coachman to act as\r\nif he were an angler continually letting out or reeling in his line. In\r\nrounding a corner a loop of an inch or two of the leaders' rein on the\r\nside to which the turn is to be made is taken up by the right hand and\r\nplaced under the left thumb. This \"points the leaders,\" who accordingly\r\nmake the required turn, while at the same time the right hand bears\r\nlightly on the wheelers' rein of the opposite side, to prevent them\r\nmaking the turn too sharply for safety to the coach behind them. As soon\r\nas the turn is made--and all this applies equally to the passing of\r\nother vehicles or obstacles on the road--the driver's left thumb\r\nreleases the loop, which runs out of itself, and the team returns to the\r\nstraight formation. A circumstance useful to bear in mind is that the\r\nswinging bars are wider than the maximum width of the coach;\r\nconsequently the driver knows that wherever the swinging bars can pass\r\nthrough with safety--and as they are before his eyes the calculation is\r\neasy--the coach will safely follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The use of the whip.\r\n\r\nA necessary part of driving four horses or tandem is the proper use of\r\nthe whip. The novice, before beginning to drive, should acquire the\r\nknack--which can only be learnt by practical instruction and\r\nexperiment--of catching up the thong of the whip on to the stick by a\r\nflick of the wrist. With practice this is done almost automatically and\r\nwithout looking at the whip. It is not merely an ornamental\r\naccomplishment, but a necessary one; for in no other way can the whip be\r\nkept in constant readiness for use either on wheelers or leaders as the\r\nneed of the moment may dictate. The point of the thong is confined in\r\nthe whip-hand when striking the wheelers (which should be done in front\r\nof the pad), and is released for reaching the leaders. Considerable\r\ndexterity is required in using the whip on the leaders without at the\r\nsame time touching, or at all events alarming or fretting, the wheelers.\r\nThe thong of the whip should reach the leaders from beneath the swinging\r\nbar; and proficient \"whips\" can unerringly strike even the near leader\r\nfrom under the off-side bar without disturbing the equanimity of any\r\nother member of the team. This demands great skill and accuracy; but no\r\ncoachman is competent to drive four horses until he is able to touch\r\nwith the whip any particular horse that may require it, and no other.\r\n\r\nEssential as is proficiency in the use of the whip when driving four\r\nhorses, it is even more imperative for the driver of tandem. For in\r\nfour-in-hand the leaders act in some measure as a restraint upon each\r\nother's freedom of action, whereas the leader in tandem is entirely\r\nindependent and therefore more difficult to control. If he takes it into\r\nhis head to turn completely round and face the driver, there is no\r\neffectual means of preventing him. It is here that a prompt and accurate\r\nuse of the whip is important. A sharp cut with the thong of the whip on\r\nthe side to which he is turning will often drive the leader back into\r\nhis place. But it must be done instantaneously, and the driver who has\r\ngot his thong coiled round the stick of his whip, or who cannot make\r\ncertain of striking the horse on precisely the desired spot, will miss\r\nthe opportunity and may find his team in a sad mess, possibly with\r\ndisastrous results. If the leader, in spite of a stroke from the whip at\r\nthe right moment and on the right spot, still persists in turning, the\r\nonly thing to be done is to turn the wheeler also; and then when the\r\ntandem has been straightened, to turn the horses back once more to their\r\noriginal direction. For this reason it is never safe to harness a tandem\r\nto a four-wheeled vehicle; because if it should be necessary to turn the\r\nwheeler sharply round, the fore-carriage would probably lock and the\r\ntrap be overturned. Of comparatively recent years a great improvement\r\nhas been effected in the harnessing of a tandem by the introduction of\r\nswinging bars similar to those used in four-in-hand. Formerly the\r\nleading traces in tandem drew direct from tugs on the wheeler's hames,\r\nor less frequently from the stops on the shafts. This left a\r\nconsiderable length of trace which, when draught was taken off the\r\nleader, hung slack between the two horses; with the result that either\r\nof them might get a leg over the leading trace, with dangerous\r\nconsequences. In the more modern arrangement short traces attached to\r\nthe wheeler's tugs hold a bar, which is kept in place by a few inches of\r\nchain from the kidney-link on the wheeler's collar. This bar is\r\nconnected by short traces or chains with a second bar to which the\r\nleader's true traces are hooked in the usual way, allowing him a\r\ncomfortable distance clear of the bar precisely as in four-in-hand. The\r\nleader thus draws as before from the wheeler's tugs; but the length of\r\ntrace is broken up by the two swinging bars, and as these are prevented\r\nfrom falling low by their attachment to the wheeler's collar, the danger\r\nfrom a too slack leading trace is reduced to a minimum; though care is\r\nneeded when the leader is not pulling to prevent the bar falling on his\r\nhocks.\r\n\r\nExpert tandem driving, owing to the greater freedom of the leader from\r\ncontrol, is a more difficult art than the driving of four horses, in\r\nspite of the fact that the weight on the hand is much less severe; but\r\nthe general principles of the two are the same. In Great Britain,\r\nhowever, the coach-and-four is the more popular. It is more showy than\r\ntandem; it keeps alive the romantic associations of the days when the\r\nstagecoach was the ordinary means of locomotion; and a coach, or \"drag,\"\r\naccommodates a larger party of passengers to a race-meeting or other\r\nexpedition for pleasure than a dogcart. But for those whose means do not\r\npermit the more costly luxury of a four-horse team, a tandem will be\r\nfound to make all the demand on skill and nerve which, in combination\r\nwith the taste for horses, makes the art of driving a source of\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\n  See Donald Walker, _British Manly Exercises: in which Riding, Driving,\r\n  Racing are now first described_ (London, 1834); Fuller, _Essay on\r\n  Wheel Carriages_ (London, 1828); William Bridges Adams, _English\r\n  Pleasure Carriages: their Origin, History, Materials, Construction_\r\n  (London, 1837); _The Equestrian: A Handbook of Horsemanship,\r\n  containing Plain Rules for Riding, Driving and the Management of the\r\n  Horse_ (London, 1854); a Cavalry Officer, _The Handy Horse Book; or\r\n  Practical Instruction in Driving and the Management of the Horse_\r\n  (London, 1865-1867, 1871-1881); H.

The ancient fortifications, still extant in the beginning of the\r\n19th century, have disappeared almost entirely, but of the four gateways\r\none named after St Lawrence remains nearly perfect, consisting of two\r\nloopholed circular towers; and there are considerable ruins of another,\r\nthe West or Butler Gate. Among the public buildings are a mansion-house\r\nor mayoralty, with a suite of assembly rooms attached; and the Tholsel,\r\na square building with a cupola. St Peter's chapel formerly served as\r\nthe cathedral of the Roman Catholic archbishopric of Armagh; and in the\r\nabbey of the Dominican nuns there is still preserved the head of Oliver\r\nPlunkett, the archbishop who was executed at Tyburn in 1681 on an\r\nunfounded charge of treason. There was formerly an archiepiscopal palace\r\nin the town, built by Archbishop Hampton about 1620; and the Dominicans,\r\nthe Franciscans, the Augustinians, the Carmelites and the knights of St\r\nJohn have monastic establishments. Of the Dominican monastery (1224)\r\nthere still exists the stately Magdalen tower; while of the Augustinian\r\nabbey of St Mary d'Urso (1206) there are the tower and a fine pointed\r\narch. At the head of the educational institutions there is a classical\r\nschool endowed by Erasmus Smith. There is also a blue-coat school,\r\nfounded about 1727 for the education of freemen's sons. The present\r\nbuilding was erected in 1870. Benjamin Whitworth, M.P., was a generous\r\nbenefactor to the town, who built the Whitworth Hall, furnished half the\r\nfunds for the construction of waterworks, established a cotton factory,\r\nand is commemorated by a statue in the Mall. The industrial\r\nestablishments comprise cotton, flax and flour mills, sawmills,\r\ntanneries, salt and soap works, breweries, chemical manure and\r\nengineering works. The town is the headquarters of the valuable Boyne\r\nsalmon-fishery. A brisk trade is carried on mainly in agricultural\r\nproduce, especially with Liverpool (which is distant 135 m. due E.) and\r\nwith Glasgow. Many works of improvement have been effected from time to\r\ntime in the harbour, the quays of which occupy both sides of the river,\r\nthe principal, 1000 yds. in length, being on the north side. Here is a\r\ndepth of 21 ft. at the highest and 14 ft. at the lowest tides. The tide\r\nreaches 2½ m. above the town to Oldbridge; and barges of 50 tons burden\r\ncan proceed 19 m. inland to Navan. The river is crossed by a bridge for\r\nordinary traffic, and by a fine railway viaduct. The town is governed\r\nby a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest notices the town of Drogheda is called Inver-Colpa or\r\nthe Port of Colpa; the present name signifies \"The Bridge over the\r\nFord.\" In 1152 the place is mentioned as the seat of a synod convened by\r\nthe papal legate, Cardinal Paparo; in 1224 it was chosen by Lucas de\r\nNetterville, archbishop of Armagh, for the foundation of the Dominican\r\nfriary of which there are still remains; and in 1228 the two divisions\r\nof the town received separate incorporation from Henry III. But there\r\ngrew up a strong feeling of hostility between Drogheda _versus Uriel_\r\nand Drogheda _versus Midiam_, in consequence of trading vessels lading\r\ntheir cargoes in the latter or southern town, to avoid the pontage duty\r\nlevied in the former or northern town. At length, after much blood had\r\nbeen shed in the dispute, Philip Bennett, a monk residing in the town,\r\nsucceeded by his eloquence, on the festival of Corpus Christi, 1412, in\r\npersuading the authorities of the two corporations to send to Henry IV.\r\nfor a new charter sanctioning their combination, and this was granted on\r\nthe 1st of November. Drogheda was always considered by the English a\r\nplace of much importance. In the reign of Edward III. it was classed\r\nalong with Dublin, Waterford and Kilkenny as one of the four staple\r\ntowns of Ireland. Richard II. received in its Dominican monastery the\r\nsubmissions of O'Neal, O'Donnell and other chieftains of Ulster and\r\nLeinster. The right of coining money was bestowed on the town, and\r\nparliaments were several times held within its walls. In the reign of\r\nEdward IV. the mayor received a sword of state and an annuity of £20, in\r\nrecognition of the services rendered by the inhabitants at Malpus Bridge\r\nagainst O'Reilly; the still greater honour of having a university with\r\nthe same privileges as that of Oxford remained a mere paper distinction,\r\nowing to the poverty of the town and the unsettled state of the country;\r\nand an attempt made by the corporation in modern times to resuscitate\r\ntheir rights proved unsuccessful. In 1495 Poyning's laws were enacted by\r\na parliament held in the town. In the civil wars of 1641 the place was\r\nbesieged by O'Neal and the Northern Irish forces; but it was gallantly\r\ndefended by Sir Henry Tichbourne, and after a long blockade was relieved\r\nby the Marquess of Ormond. The same nobleman relieved it a second time,\r\nwhen it was invested by the Parliamentary army under Colonel Jones. In\r\n1649 it was captured by Cromwell, after a short though spirited defence;\r\nand nearly every individual within its walls, without distinction of age\r\nor sex, was put to the sword. Thirty only escaped, who were afterwards\r\ntransported as slaves to Barbados. In 1690 it was garrisoned by King\r\nJames's army; but after the decisive battle of the Boyne (q.v.) it\r\nsurrendered to the conqueror without a struggle, in consequence of a\r\nthreat that quarter would not be granted if the town were taken by\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nDrogheda ceased to be a parliamentary borough in 1885, and a county of a\r\ntown in 1898. Before 1885 it returned one member, and before the Union\r\nin 1800 it returned four members to the Irish parliament.\r\n\r\nFrom the close of the 12th century, certainly long before the\r\nReformation and for some time after it, the primates of Ireland lived in\r\nDrogheda. Being mostly Englishmen, they preferred to reside in the\r\nportion of their diocese within the gate, and Drogheda, being a walled\r\ntown, was less liable to attack from the natives. From 1417 onwards\r\nDrogheda was their chief place of residence and of burial. Its proximity\r\nto Dublin, the seat of government and of the Irish parliament, in which\r\nthe primates were such prominent figures, induced them to prefer it to\r\n_Ardmacha inter Hibernicos_. Archbishop O'Scanlain, who did much in the\r\nbuilding of the cathedral at Armagh, preferred to live at Drogheda, and\r\nthere he was buried in 1270. Near Drogheda in later times was the\r\nprimates' castle and summer palace at Termonfeckin, some ruins of which\r\nremain. In Drogheda itself there is now not a vestige of the palace,\r\nexcept the name \"Palace Street.\" It stood at the corner of the main\r\nstreet near St Lawrence's gate, and its grounds extended back to St\r\nPeter's church. The primates of the 15th century were buried in or near\r\nDrogheda. After the Reformation five in succession lived in Drogheda and\r\nthere were buried, though there is now nothing to fix the spot where any\r\nof them lies. The last of these--Christopher Hampton--who was\r\nconsecrated to the primacy in 1613, repaired the ruined cathedral of\r\nArmagh. He built a new and handsome palace at Drogheda, and he repaired\r\nthe old disused palace at Armagh and bestowed on it a demesne of 300\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROIT (Fr. for \"right,\" from Lat. _directus_, straight), a legal title,\r\nclaim or due; a term used in English law in the phrase _droits of\r\nadmiralty_, certain customary rights or perquisites formerly belonging\r\nto the lord high admiral, but now to the crown for public purposes and\r\npaid into the exchequer. These _droits_ (see also WRECK) consisted of\r\nflotsam, jetsam, ligan, treasure, deodand, derelict, within the\r\nadmiral's jurisdiction; all fines, forfeitures, ransoms, recognizances\r\nand pecuniary punishments; all sturgeons, whales, porpoises, dolphins,\r\ngrampuses and such large fishes; all ships and goods of the enemy coming\r\ninto any creek, road or port, by durance or mistake; all ships seized at\r\nsea, salvage, &c., with the share of prizes--such shares being\r\nafterwards called \"tenths,\" in imitation of the French, who gave their\r\nadmiral a _droit de dixième_. The _droits of admiralty_ were definitely\r\nsurrendered for the benefit of the public by Prince George of Denmark,\r\nwhen lord high admiral of England in 1702. American law does not\r\nrecognize any such _droits_, and the disposition of captured property is\r\nregulated by various acts of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe term _droit_ is also used in various legal connexions (for _French\r\nlaw_, see FRANCE: _law_), such as the _droit_ of angary (q.v.), the\r\n_droit d'achat_ (right of pre-emption) in the case of contraband (q.v.),\r\nthe feudal _droit de bris_ (see WRECK), the _droit de régale_ or ancient\r\nroyal privilege of claiming the revenues and patronage of a vacant\r\nbishopric, and the feudal droits of seignory generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROITWICH, a market town and municipal borough in the Droitwich\r\nparliamentary division of Worcestershire, England, 5½ m. N.N.E. of\r\nWorcester, and 126 m. N.W. by W. from London by the Great Western\r\nrailway. Pop. (1901) 4201. It is served by the Bristol-Birmingham line\r\nof the Midland railway, and by the Worcester-Shrewsbury line of the\r\nGreat Western. It stands on the river Salwarpe, an eastern tributary of\r\nthe Severn. There is connexion with the Severn by canal. There are three\r\nparish churches, St Andrew, St Peter and St Michael, of which the two\r\nfirst are fine old buildings in mixed styles, while St Michael's is\r\nmodern. The principal occupation is the manufacture of the salt obtained\r\nfrom the brine springs or _wyches_, to which the town probably owes both\r\nits name and its origin. The springs also give Droitwich a considerable\r\nreputation as a health resort. There are Royal Brine baths, supplied\r\nwith water of extreme saltness, St Andrew's baths, and a private bath\r\nhospital. The water is used in cases of gout, rheumatism and kindred\r\ndiseases. Owing to the pumping of the brine for the salt-works there is\r\na continual subsidence of the ground, detrimental to the buildings, and\r\nnew houses are mostly built in the suburbs. In the pleasant well-wooded\r\ndistrict surrounding Droitwich the most noteworthy points are Hindlip\r\nHall, 3 m. S., where (in a former mansion) some of the conspirators in\r\nthe Gunpowder Plot defied search for eight days (1605); and Westwood, a\r\nfine hall of Elizabethan and Carolean date on the site of a Benedictine\r\nnunnery, a mile west of Droitwich, which offered a retreat to many\r\nRoyalist cavaliers and churchmen during the Commonwealth. Droitwich is\r\ngoverned by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 1856 acres.\r\n\r\nA Roman villa, with various relics, has been discovered here, but it is\r\ndoubtful how far the Romans made use of the brine springs. Droitwich\r\n(_Wic_, _Salturic_, _Wich_) probably owed its origin to the springs,\r\nwhich are mentioned in several charters before the Conquest. At the time\r\nof the Domesday Survey all the salt springs belonged to the king, who\r\nreceived from them a yearly farm of £65, but the manor was divided\r\nbetween several churches and tenants-in-chief. The burgesses of\r\nDroitwich are mentioned in the Domesday Survey, but they probably only\r\nhad certain franchises in connexion with the salt trade. The town is\r\nfirst called a borough in the pipe roll of 2 Henry II., when an aid of\r\n20s. was paid, but the burgesses did not receive their first charter\r\nuntil 1215, when King John granted them freedom from toll throughout the\r\nkingdom and the privilege of holding the town at a fee-farm of £100. The\r\nburgesses appear to have had much difficulty in paying this large farm;\r\nin 1227 the king pardoned twenty-eight marks of the thirty-two due as\r\ntallage, while in 1237 they were £23 in arrears for the farm. They\r\ncontinued, however, to pay the farm until the payment gradually lapsed\r\nin the 18th century. In medieval times Droitwich was governed by two\r\nbailiffs and twelve jurats, the former being elected every year by the\r\nburgesses; Queen Mary granted the incorporation charter in 1554 under\r\nthe name of the bailiffs and burgesses. James I. in 1625 granted another\r\nand fuller charter, which remained the governing charter until the\r\nMunicipal Reform Act. King John's charter granted the burgesses a fair\r\non the feast of SS. Andrew and Nicholas lasting for eight days, but\r\nEdward III. in 1330 granted instead two fairs on the vigil and day of St\r\nThomas the Martyr and the vigil and day of SS. Simon and Jude. Queen\r\nMary granted three new fairs, and James I. changed the market day from\r\nMonday to Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRÔME, a department in the south-east of France, formed of parts of\r\nDauphiné and Provence, and bounded W. by the Rhone, which separates it\r\nfrom Ardèche, N. and N.E. by Isère, E. by Hautes-Alpes, S.E. by\r\nBasses-Alpes, and S. by Vaucluse; area 2533 sq. m.; pop. (1906) 297,270.\r\nDrôme is traversed from east to west by numerous rivers of the Rhone\r\nbasin, chief among which are the Isère in the north, the Drôme in the\r\ncentre and the Aygues in the south. The left bank of the Rhone is\r\nbordered by alluvial plains and low hills, but to the east of this zone\r\nthe department is covered to the extent of two-thirds of its surface by\r\nspurs of the Alps, sloping down towards the west. To the north of the\r\nDrôme lie the Vercors and the Royans, a region of forest-clad ridges\r\nrunning uniformly north and south. South of that river the mountain\r\nsystem is broken, irregular and intersected everywhere by torrents. The\r\nmost easterly portion of the department, where it touches the mountains\r\nof the Dévoluy, contains its culminating summit (7890 ft.). North of the\r\nIsère stretches a district of low hills terminating on the limits of the\r\ndepartment in the Valloire, its most productive portion. The climate,\r\nexcept in the valleys bordering the Rhone, is cold, and winds blow\r\nincessantly. Snow is visible on the mountain-tops during the greater\r\npart of the year.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the department is moderately prosperous. The main\r\ncrops are wheat, which is grown chiefly on the banks of the Isère and\r\nRhone, oats and potatoes. Large flocks of sheep feed on the pastures in\r\nthe south; cattle-raising is carried on principally in the north-east.\r\nGood wines, among which the famous Hermitage growth ranks first, are\r\ngrown on the hills and plains near the Rhone and Drôme. Fruit culture is\r\nmuch practised. Olives and figs are grown in the south; the cultivation\r\nof mulberries and walnuts is more widely spread. In the rearing of\r\nsilkworms Drôme ranks high in importance among French departments. The\r\nMontélimar district is noted for its truffles, which are also found\r\nelsewhere in the department. The mineral products of Drôme include\r\nlignite, blende, galena, calamine, freestone, lime, cement, potter's\r\nclay and kaolin. Brick and tile works, potteries and porcelain\r\nmanufactories exist in several localities. The industries comprise\r\nflour-milling, distilling, wood-sawing, turnery and dyeing. The chief\r\ntextile industry is the preparation and weaving of silk, which is\r\ncarried on in a number of towns. Woollen and cotton goods are also\r\nmanufactured. Leather working and boot-making, which are carried on on a\r\nlarge scale at Romans, are important, and the manufacture of machinery,\r\nhats, confectionery and paper employs much labour. Drôme exports fruit,\r\noil, cheese, wine, wool, live stock and its manufactured articles; the\r\nchief import is coal. It is served by the Paris-Lyon railway, and the\r\nRhone and Isère furnish over 100 m. of navigable waterway. The canal de\r\nla Bourne, the only one in the department, is used for purposes of\r\nirrigation only. Drôme is divided into the arrondissements of Valence,\r\nDie, Montélimar and Nyons, comprising 29 cantons and 379 communes. The\r\ncapital is Valence, which is the seat of a bishopric of the province of\r\nAvignon. The department forms part of the académie (educational\r\ndivision) of Grenoble, where its court of appeal is also located, and of\r\nthe region of the XIV. army corps.\r\n\r\nBesides Valence, the chief towns of the department are Die, Montélimar,\r\nCrest and Romans (qq.v.). Nyons is a small industrial town with a\r\nmedieval bridge and remains of ramparts. Suze-la-Rousse is dominated by\r\na fine château with fortifications of the 12th and 14th centuries; in\r\nthe interior the buildings are in the Renaissance style. At St Donat\r\nthere are remains of the palace of the kings of Cisjuran Burgundy;\r\nthough but little of the building is of an earlier date than the 12th\r\ncentury, it is the oldest example of civil architecture in France. The\r\nchurches of Léoncel, St Restitut and La Garde-Adhémar, all of Romanesque\r\narchitecture, are also of antiquarian interest. St Paul-Trois-Châteaux,\r\nan old Roman town, once the seat of a bishopric, has a Romanesque\r\ncathedral. At Grignan there are remains of the Renaissance château where\r\nMadame de Sévigné died. At Tain there is a sacrificial altar of A.D.\r\n184.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROMEDARY (from the Gr. [Greek: dromas, dromados], running, [Greek:\r\ndramein], to run), a word applied to swift riding camels of either the\r\nArabian or the Bactrian species. (See CAMEL.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROMORE, a market town of Co. Down, Ireland, in the west parliamentary\r\ndivision, on the upper Lagan, 17½ m. S.W. of Belfast by a branch of the\r\nGreat Northern railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 2307. It is in the\r\nlinen manufacturing district. The town is of high antiquity, and was the\r\nseat of a bishopric, which grew out of an abbey of Canons Regular\r\nattributed to St Colman in the 6th century, and was united in 1842 to\r\nDown and Connor. The town and cathedral were wholly destroyed during the\r\ninsurrection of 1641, and the present church was built by Bishop Jeremy\r\nTaylor in 1661, who is buried here, as also is Thomas Percy, another\r\nfamous bishop of the diocese, who laid out the fine grounds of the\r\npalace. Remains of a castle and earthworks are to be seen, together with\r\na large rath or encampment known as the Great Fort. The town gives its\r\nname to a Roman Catholic diocese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROMOS (Gr. for running-place), in architecture, the name of the\r\nentrance passage leading down to the beehive tombs in Greece, open to\r\nthe air and enclosed between stone walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRONE, in music[1] (corresponding to Fr. _bourdon_; Ger. _Summer_,\r\n_Stimmer_, _Hummel_; Ital. _bordone_), the bass pipe or pipes of the\r\nbagpipe, having no lateral holes and therefore giving out the same note\r\nwithout intermission as long as there is wind in the bag, thus forming a\r\ncontinuous pedal, or drone bass. The drone consists of a jointed pipe\r\nhaving a cylindrical bore and usually terminating in a bell. During the\r\nmiddle ages bagpipes are represented in miniatures with conical\r\ndrones,[2] and M. Praetorius[3] gives a drawing of a bagpipe, which he\r\ncalls _Grosser Bock_, having two drones ending in a curved ram's horn.\r\nThe drone pipe has, instead of a mouthpiece, a socket fitted with a\r\nreed, and inserted into a stock or short pipe immovably fixed in an\r\naperture of the bag. The reed is of the kind known as beating reed or\r\n_squeaker_, prepared by making a cut in the direction of the\r\ncircumference of the pipe and splitting back the reed from the cut\r\ntowards a joint or knot, thus leaving a flap or tongue which vibrates or\r\nbeats, alternately opening and closing the aperture. The sound is\r\nproduced by the stream of air forced from the bag by the pressure of the\r\nperformer's arm causing the reed tongue to vibrate over the aperture,\r\nthus setting the whole column of air in vibration. Like all cylindrical\r\npipes with reed mouthpiece, the drone pipe has the acoustic properties\r\nof the closed pipe and produces a note of the same pitch as that of an\r\nopen pipe twice its length. The conical drones mentioned above would,\r\ntherefore, speak an octave higher than a cylindrical drone of the same\r\nlength. The drones are tuned by means of sliding tubes at the joints.\r\n\r\nThe drones of the old French _cornemuse_ played in concert with the\r\n_hautbois de Poitou_ (see BAGPIPE), and differing from the shepherd's\r\n_cornemuse_ or _chalémie_, formed an exception to this method of\r\nconstruction, being furnished with double reeds like that of the oboe.\r\nThe drones of the musette and of the union pipes of Ireland are also\r\nconstructed on an altogether different plan. Instead of having long\r\ncumbersome pipes, pointing over the shoulder, the musette drones consist\r\nof a short barrel containing lengths of tubing necessary for four or\r\nfive drones, reduced to the most compact form and resembling the rackett\r\n(q.v.). The narrow bores are pierced longitudinally through the\r\nthickness of the barrel in parallel channels communicating with each\r\nother in twos or threes, and so arranged as to provide the requisite\r\nlength for each drone. The reeds are double reeds all set in the wooden\r\nstock within the bag. By means of regulating slides (called in English\r\n_regulators_ and in French _layettes_), which may be pushed up and down\r\nin longitudinal grooves round the circumference of the barrel, the\r\nlength of each drone tube can be so regulated that a simple harmonic\r\nbass consisting of the common chord is obtainable. In the union pipes\r\nthe drones are separate pipes having keys played by the elbow, which\r\ncorrespond to the sliders in the musette drone and produce the same kind\r\nof harmonic bass. The modern Egyptian arghool consists of a kind of\r\nclarinet with a drone attached to it by means of waxed thread; in this\r\ncase the beating reed of the drone is set in vibration directly by the\r\nbreath of the performer, who takes both mouthpieces into his mouth,\r\nwithout the medium of a wind reservoir. Mersenne gave very clear\r\ndescriptions of the construction of cornemuse and musette, with clear\r\nillustrations of the reeds and stock.[4] There are allusions in the\r\nGreek classics which point to the existence of a pipe with a drone,\r\neither of the arghool or the bagpipe type.[5] (K.

S. of Sheffield, on the Midland railway.\r\nPop. (1901) 3809. It lies on the small river Drone, a tributary of the\r\nRother, in a busy industrial district in which are numerous coal-mines,\r\nand there are iron foundries and manufactures of tools and other iron\r\nand steel goods. The church of St John the Baptist, with a lofty spire,\r\nis a good example of Decorated work, with Perpendicular additions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY (contracted from the old word _hydropisy_, derived from the Gr.\r\n[Greek: udrôps]; [Greek: udôr], water, and [Greek: ôps], appearance),\r\nthe name given to a collection of simple serous fluid in all or any of\r\nthe cavities of the body, or in the meshes of its tissues. Dropsy of the\r\nsubcutaneous connective tissue is termed _oedema_ when it is localized\r\nand limited in extent; when more diffuse it is termed _anasarca_; the\r\nterm _oedema_ is also applied to dropsies of some of the internal\r\norgans, notably to that of the lungs. _Hydrocephalus_ signifies an\r\naccumulation of fluid within the ventricles of the brain or in the\r\narachnoid cavity; _hydrothorax_, a collection of fluid in one or both\r\npleural cavities; _hydropericardium_, in the pericardium; _ascites_, in\r\nthe peritoneum; and, when _anasarca_ is conjoined with the accumulation\r\nof fluid in one or more of the serous cavities, the dropsy is said to be\r\ngeneral (see also PATHOLOGY).\r\n\r\nDropsy (excluding \"epidemic dropsy,\" for which see below) is essentially\r\na symptom and not a specific disease, and is merely an exaggeration of a\r\ncertain state of health. Fluid, known as lymph, is continually passing\r\nthrough the capillary walls into the tissues, and in health this is\r\nremoved as fast as it is exuded, in one or more of three ways: part of\r\nit is used in the nutrition of the tissues, part is returned to the\r\ngeneral circulation by the veins, and part by the lymphatics. Any\r\naccumulation constitutes dropsy and is a sign of disease, though not a\r\ndisease in itself. The serous effusions due to inflammation are not\r\nincluded under the term dropsy. A dropsical fluid varies considerably in\r\ncomposition according to its position in the body, but varies only\r\nslightly according to the disease which has given rise to it. Its\r\nspecific gravity ranges between 1008 and 1018; the mineral salts present\r\nare the same and in about the same proportion as those of blood, nor do\r\nthey vary with the position of the exudation. The quantity of albumin,\r\nhowever, depends much on the position of the fluid, and slightly on the\r\nunderlying disease. In oedema the fluid contains only traces, whereas a\r\npleural or peritoneal effusion is always highly albuminous. Also an\r\neffusion due to heart disease contains more albumin than one due to\r\nkidney disease. In appearance it may be colourless, greenish or reddish\r\nfrom the presence of blood pigment, or yellowish from the presence of\r\nbile pigment; transparent or opalescent or milky from the presence of\r\nfatty matter derived from the chyle. The membrane from which the\r\ndropsical fluid escapes is healthy, or at least not inflamed, and only\r\nsomewhat sodden by long contact with the fluid--the morbid condition on\r\nwhich the transudation depends lying elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe simplest cause of dropsy is purely mechanical, blood pressure being\r\nraised beyond a certain point owing to venous obstruction. This may be\r\ndue to thrombosis of a vein as in phlegmasia dolens (white leg),\r\nretardation of venous circulation as in varicose veins, or obstruction\r\nof a vein due to the pressure of an aneurism or tumour. Cardiac and\r\nrenal dropsy are more complicated in origin, but cardiac dropsy is\r\nprobably due to diminished absorption, and renal dropsy, when\r\nunassociated with heart failure, to increased exudation. But the\r\nstarting point of acute renal dropsy, of the dropsy sometimes occurring\r\nin diabetes, and that of chlorosis is the toxic condition of the blood.\r\nFor accounts of the various local dropsies see HYDROCEPHALUS; ASCITES;\r\nLIVER, &c.; general dropsy, or dropsy which depends on causes acting on\r\nthe system at large, is due chiefly to diseases of the heart, kidneys or\r\nlungs, occasionally on lardaceous disease, more rarely still on diabetes\r\nor one of the anaemias.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, 50% of cases of general dropsy are due to disease of\r\nthe heart or aorta, and 25% to renal troubles. The natural tendency of\r\nall diseases of the heart is to transfer the blood pressure from the\r\narteries to the veins, and, so soon as this has reached a sufficient\r\ndegree, dropsy in the form of local _oedema_ commences to appear at\r\nwhatever may be the most depending part of the body--the instep and\r\nankle in the upright position, the lower part of the back or the lungs\r\nif the patient be in bed--and this tends gradually to increase till all\r\nthe cavities of the body are invaded by the serous accumulation. The\r\ndiseases of the lungs which produce dropsy are those which obstruct the\r\npassage of the blood through them, such as emphysema and fibrosis, and\r\nthus act precisely like disease of the heart in transferring the blood\r\npressure from the arteries to the veins, inducing dropsy in exactly a\r\nsimilar manner. The dropsy of renal disease is dependent for the most\r\npart on an excess of exudation, due largely to an increase of arterial\r\nand cardiac tension. This in its turn produces arterial thickening and\r\ncardiac hypertrophy, which, if the case be sufficiently prolonged,\r\nbrings about a natural removal of the fluid. In kidney cases, in the\r\nabsence of cardiac disease, the dropsy will be found to appear first\r\nabout the loose cellular tissue surrounding the eyes, where the vessels,\r\nturgid with watery blood, have less efficient support. The dropsy of\r\nchlorosis is very similar to renal dropsy, a toxic condition of blood\r\nbeing present in both; also other forms of anaemia, as also hydraemia,\r\ntend to produce or assist in the production of dropsical effusions.\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of dropsy the reader is referred to the articles on\r\nthe several diseases of which it is a symptom. Briefly, however, tapping\r\nof the abdomen or puncture of the legs are constantly resorted to in\r\nsevere cases. Dehydration by diet is very valuable under certain\r\ncircumstances when the dropsy is other than renal. And there is the\r\nroutine treatment by drugs, purgative, diaphoretic and diuretic as the\r\nsymptoms of the case may demand.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to mention that there are certain affections which may be\r\ntermed _spurious dropsies_, such as _ovarian dropsy_, which is only a\r\ncystic disease of the ovary; _hydrometria_, dropsy of the uterus, due to\r\ninflammatory occlusion of the os uteri; _hydronephrosis_, dropsy of the\r\nkidney, due to obstruction of the ureter, and subsequent distension of\r\nthese organs by serous accumulations; other hollow organs may also be\r\nsimilarly affected.\r\n\r\nHaving no known relation to the preceding is _epidemic dropsy_, the\r\nfirst recorded outbreak of which occurred in Calcutta in the year 1877.\r\nIt disappeared during the hot weather of the following year, only to\r\nrecur over a wider area in the cold months of 1878 to 1879, and once\r\nagain in the cold of 1879 to 1880. Since then only isolated cases have\r\nbeen recorded in the immediate neighbourhood of Calcutta, though\r\nepidemics have broken out in other places both by land and sea. At the\r\nend of 1902 an outbreak occurred in the Barisal gaol, Bengal, in which\r\nnearly one-third of the cases ended fatally. Dropsy was an invariable\r\nfeature of the disease, and was either the first symptom or occurred\r\nearly. The lower limbs were first affected, trunk and upper limbs later\r\nin severe cases, the face very rarely. It was accompanied by pyrexia,\r\ngastro-enteritis, deep-seated pains in limbs and body, and burning and\r\npricking of the skin. Various rashes appeared early in the attack, while\r\neczema, desquamation and even ulceration supervened later. Anaemia was\r\nvery marked, giving rise in Mauritius to the name of acute anaemic\r\ndropsy. The duration of the disease was very variable, the limits being\r\nthree weeks and three months. Death was often sudden, resulting chiefly\r\nfrom cardiac and respiratory complications. The cause of the disease has\r\nremained obscure, but there is reason to suppose that it was originally\r\nimported from the Madras famine tracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPWORT, in botany, the common name for a species of _Spiraea_, _S.\r\nfilipendula_ (nat. ord. _Rosaceae_), found in dry pastures. It is a\r\nperennial herb, with much divided radical leaves and an erect stem 2 to\r\n3 ft. high bearing a loose terminal inflorescence of small white\r\nflowers, closely resembling those of the nearly allied species _S.\r\nUlmaria_, or meadowsweet.\r\n\r\nWater Dropwort, _Oenanthe crocata_ (nat. ord. _Umbelliferae_), is a tall\r\nherbaceous plant growing in marshes and ditches. The stem, which springs\r\nfrom a cluster of thickened roots, is stout, branched, hollow and 2 to 5\r\nft. high; the leaves are large and pinnately divided, and the flowers\r\nare borne in a compound umbel, the long rays bearing dense partial\r\numbels of small white flowers. The plant, which is very poisonous, is\r\noften mistaken for celery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROSHKY (Russ. _drozhki_, diminutive of _drogi_, a wagon), a light\r\nfour-wheeled uncovered carriage used in Russia. Properly it consists of\r\ntwo pairs of wheels joined by a board. This forms a seat for the\r\npassengers who sit sideways, while the driver sits astride in front. The\r\nword _Droschke_, however, is applied especially in Germany to light\r\ncarriages generally which ply for hire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROSTE-HÜLSHOFF, ANNETTE ELISABETH, FREIIN VON (1797-1848), German poet,\r\nwas born at the family seat of Hülshoff near Münster in Westphalia on\r\nthe 10th of January 1797. Her early mental training was largely\r\ninfluenced by her cousin, Clemens August, Freiherr von Droste zu\r\nVischering, who, as archbishop of Cologne, became notorious for his\r\nextreme ultramontane views (see below); and she received a more liberal\r\neducation than in those days ordinarily fell to a woman's lot. After\r\nprolonged visits among the intellectual circles at Coblenz, Bonn and\r\nCologne, she retired to the estate of Ruschhaus near Münster, belonging\r\nto her mother's family. In 1841, owing to delicate health, she went to\r\nreside in the house of her brother-in-law, the well-known scholar,\r\nJoseph, Freiherr von Lassberg (1770-1855), at Schloss Meersburg on the\r\nLake of Constance, where she met Levin Schücking (q.v.); and there she\r\ndied on the 24th of May 1848. Annette von Droste-Hülshoff is, beyond\r\ndoubt, the most gifted and original of German women poets. Her verse is\r\nstrong and vigorous, but often unmusical even to harshness; one looks in\r\nvain for a touch of sentimentality or melting sweetness in it. As a\r\nlyric poet, she is at her best when she is able to attune her thoughts\r\nto the sober landscape of the Westphalian moorlands of her home. Her\r\nnarrative poetry, and especially _Das Hospiz auf dem Grossen St Bernard_\r\nand _Die Schlacht im Loener Bruch_ (both 1838), belongs to the best\r\nGerman poetry of its kind. She was a strict Roman Catholic, and her\r\nreligious poems, published in 1852, after her death, under the title\r\n_Das geistliche Jahr, nebst einem Anhang religiöser Gedichte_, enjoyed\r\ngreat popularity.\r\n\r\n  Annette von Droste-Hülshoff's _Gedichte_ were first published in 1844\r\n  during her lifetime, and a number of her poems were translated into\r\n  English by Thomas Medwin. The most complete edition of her works is\r\n  that in 4 vols. edited by E. von Droste-Hülshoff (Münster, 1886). The\r\n  _Ausgewählte Gedichte_ were edited by W. von Scholz (Leipzig, 1901).\r\n  See Levin Schücking, _Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, ein Lebensbild_\r\n  (2nd ed., Hanover, 1871)--her letters to L. Schücking were published\r\n  at Leipzig in 1893; also H. Hueffer, _Annette von Droste-Hülshoff und\r\n  ihre Werke_ (Gotha, 1887), and W. Kreiten, _Annette von\r\n  Droste-Hülshoff_ (2nd ed., Paderborn, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROSTE-VISCHERING, CLEMENS AUGUST, BARON VON (1773-1845), German Roman\r\nCatholic divine, was born at Münster on the 21st of January 1773. He was\r\neducated in his native town and entered the priesthood in 1798; in 1807\r\nthe local chapter elected him vicar-general. This office he resigned in\r\n1813 through his opposition to Napoleon, but assumed it again after the\r\nbattle of Waterloo (1815) until a disagreement with the Prussian\r\ngovernment in 1820 led to his abdication. He remained in private life\r\nuntil 1835, when he was appointed archbishop of Cologne. Here again his\r\nzeal for the supremacy of the church led him to break the agreement\r\nbetween the state and the Catholic bishops which he had signed at his\r\ninstallation, and he was arrested by the Prussian government in November\r\n1837. A battle of pamphlets raged for some time; Droste was not\r\nre-installed but was obliged to accept a coadjutor. His chief works\r\nwere: _Über die Religionsfreiheit der Katholiken_ (1817), and _Über den\r\nFrieden unter der Kirche und den Staaten_ (1843).\r\n\r\n  See Carl Mirbt's article in Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyk. für prot. Theol._\r\n  v. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROUAIS, JEAN GERMAIN (1763-1788), French historical painter, was born\r\nat Paris on the 25th of November 1763. His father, François Hubert\r\nDrouais, and his grandfather, Hubert Drouais, were well-known portrait\r\npainters; and it was from his father that he received his first artistic\r\ninstruction. He was afterwards entrusted to the care of Brenet, an\r\nexcellent teacher, though his own pictures did not take high rank. In\r\n1780 David, who had just returned from Rome, opened a school of painting\r\nin Paris, and Drouais was one of his earliest and most promising pupils.\r\nHe adopted the classical style of his master, and gave his whole time to\r\nstudy--painting during the day, and spending a great part of every night\r\nin designing. For weeks together it is said that he never left his\r\nstudio. In 1783 he was admitted to compete for the great prize of\r\npainting offered by the Academy, the subject being the \"Widow of Nain.\"\r\nAfter inspecting the works of his fellow-competitors, however, he lost\r\nhope and destroyed his own canvas, but was consoled by the assurance of\r\nhis master David that had he not done so he would have won the prize.\r\nNext year he was triumphantly successful, the \"Woman of Canaan at the\r\nFeet of Christ,\" with which he gained the prize, being compared by\r\ncompetent critics with the works of Poussin. He was carried shoulder\r\nhigh by his fellow-students through the streets to his mother's house,\r\nand a place was afterwards found for his picture in the Louvre. His\r\nsuccess making him only the more eager to perfect himself in his art, he\r\naccompanied David to Rome, where he worked even more assiduously than in\r\nParis. He was most strongly influenced by the remains of ancient art and\r\nby the works of Raphael. Goethe, who was at Rome at the time it was\r\nfinished, has recorded the deep impression made by his \"Marius at\r\nMinturno,\" which he characterizes as in some respects superior to the\r\nwork of David, his master. The last picture which he completed was his\r\n\"Philoctetus on the Island of Lemnos.\" He died on the 15th of July\r\n1788. A monument to his memory was erected by his fellow-students in the\r\nchurch of Santa Maria in the Via Lata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROUET, JEAN BAPTISTE (1763-1824), French Revolutionist, chiefly noted\r\nfor the part he played in the arrest of Louis XVI. at Varennes, was born\r\nat Sainte-Menehould. He served for seven years in the army, and\r\nafterwards assisted his father, who was post-master of his native town.\r\nThe carriages conveying the royal family on their flight to the frontier\r\nstopped at his door on the evening of the 21st of June 1791; and the\r\npassengers, travelling under assumed names, were recognized by Drouet,\r\nwho immediately took steps which led to their arrest and detection on\r\nreaching Varennes. For this service the Assembly awarded him 30,000\r\nfrancs, but he appears to have declined the reward. In September 1792 he\r\nwas elected deputy to the Convention, and took his place with the most\r\nviolent party. He voted the death of the king without appeal, showed\r\nimplacable hostility to the Girondins, and proposed the slaughter of all\r\nEnglish residents in France. Sent as commissioner to the army of the\r\nnorth, he was captured at the siege of Maubeuge and imprisoned at\r\nSpielberg till the close of 1795. He then became a member of the Council\r\nof Five Hundred, and was named secretary. Drouet was implicated in the\r\nconspiracy of Babeuf, and was imprisoned; but he made his escape into\r\nSwitzerland, and thence to Teneriffe. There he took part in the\r\nsuccessful resistance to the attempt of Nelson on the island, in 1797,\r\nand later visited India. The first empire found in him a docile\r\nsub-prefect of Sainte-Menehould. After the second Restoration he was\r\ncompelled to quit France. Returning secretly he settled at Macon, under\r\nthe name of Merger and a guise of piety, and preserved his incognito\r\ntill his death on the 11th of April 1824.\r\n\r\n  See G. Lenotre, _Le Drame de Varennes_ (Paris, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROWNING AND LIFE SAVING. To \"drown\" (a verb used both transitively and\r\nintransitively, of which the origin, though traced to earlier forms, is\r\nunknown) is to suffer or inflict death by submersion in water, or\r\nfiguratively to submerge entirely in water or some other liquid. As a\r\nform of ancient capital punishment, the method of drowning is referred\r\nto at the end of this article, but the interest of the subject is mainly\r\nassociated with rescue-work in cases of accident.\r\n\r\nDeath from drowning is the result of asphyxia, due to the stoppage of a\r\nsupply of fresh air to the lungs. There is a certain amount of\r\nstationary air in the lungs, and into this is diffused oxygen from the\r\nfresh air taken in, while the carbonic acid which it has taken from the\r\nblood through the walls of the capillaries is driven out. This process\r\nof exchange is ever proceeding, the whole of it being regulated from the\r\nnervous centre at the base of the brain. When a person gets under water\r\nand cannot swim, there is a natural tendency to struggle, and in the\r\nefforts to respire water is drawn into the windpipe and cough is brought\r\non. This expels the air from the lungs with the water which threatened\r\nto suffocate him, and as further efforts are made to respire more water\r\nis taken in and has to be swallowed. Meanwhile, the oxygen in the lungs\r\nis gradually diminishing, the quantity of carbonic acid is increasing,\r\nand at length the air in the lungs becomes too impure to effect an\r\nexchange with the blood. Then the blood passing into the heart becomes\r\nvenous and the heart begins to send out venous instead of arterial blood\r\nto all parts of the body. Immediately a dull, sickening pain becomes\r\napparent at the base of the neck, and insensibility rapidly ensues. This\r\narises from the affection of the respiratory nerve centre. In a short\r\nspace of time the face becomes dark and congested through the veins\r\nbeing gorged with blood, and the heart ultimately ceases to beat.\r\n\r\nWhen a person unable to swim falls into the water, he usually rises to\r\nthe surface, throws up his arms and calls for help. This, with the water\r\nswallowed, will make him sink, and if the arms are moved above the head\r\nwhen under water, he will, as a natural consequence, sink still lower.\r\nThe struggle will be prolonged a few seconds, and then probably cease\r\nfor a time, allowing him to rise again, though perhaps not sufficiently\r\nhigh to enable him to get another breath of air. If still conscious, he\r\nwill renew his struggle, more feebly perhaps, but with the same result.\r\nAs soon as insensibility occurs, the body sinks altogether, owing to the\r\nloss of air and the filling of the stomach with water. There is a\r\ngeneral belief that a drowning person must rise three times before he\r\nfinally sinks, but this is a fallacy. The question whether he rises at\r\nall, or how often he does so, entirely depends upon circumstances. A man\r\nmay get entangled among weeds, which prevent his coming to the surface,\r\nor he may die through heart failure from the shock or fright of entering\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--1st Release Method.]\r\n\r\nOn seeing a person struggling in the water in danger of drowning, no\r\ntime should be lost in going to his assistance, for he may sink at once,\r\nand then there is danger of missing the body when searching under water\r\nfor it, or it may get entangled among weeds and then the rescuer's task\r\nis rendered doubly dangerous. Before diving in to the rescue the boots\r\nand heavy clothing should be discarded if possible, and in cases where a\r\nleap has to be made from a height, such as a bridge, high embankment,\r\nvessel or pier, or where the depth of the water is not known, it is best\r\nto drop in feet first. Where weeds abound there is always danger of\r\nentanglement, and therefore progress should be made in the direction of\r\nthe stream. When approaching a drowning man there is always the danger\r\nof being clutched, but a swimmer who knows the right way to deal with a\r\nman in the water can easily avoid this; but if through some mistake he\r\nfinds himself seized by the drowning person, a necessary thing for the\r\nswimmer to do is to take advantage of his knowledge of the water and\r\nkeep uppermost, as this weakens the drowning person and makes the effort\r\nof effecting a release much easier than would otherwise be the case. To\r\nthe Royal Life Saving Society in England is due the credit of\r\ndisseminating, throughout the entire world, the ideas of swimmers, based\r\non practical experience, as to the safest methods which should be\r\nadopted for release and rescue, and their methods, as well as the\r\napproved ones for resuscitation, are now taught in almost every school\r\nand college.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--2nd Release Method.]\r\n\r\nIf the rescuer be held by the wrists, he must turn both arms\r\nsimultaneously against the drowning person's thumbs, and bring his arms\r\nat right angles to the body, thus dislocating the thumbs of the drowning\r\nperson if he does not leave go (fig. 1). If he be clutched round the\r\nneck he must take a deep breath and lean well over the drowning person,\r\nat the same time placing one hand in the small of his back, then raise\r\nthe other arm in line with the shoulder, and pass it over the drowning\r\nperson's arm, then pinch the nostrils close with the fingers, and at the\r\nsame time place the palm of the hand on the chin and push away with all\r\npossible force. By the firm holding of the nose the drowning person is\r\nmade to open his mouth for breathing, and as he will then be under\r\nwater, choking ensues and he gives way to the rescuer, who then gains\r\ncomplete control (fig. 2). One of the most dangerous clutches is that\r\nround the body and arms or round the body only. When so tackled the\r\nrescuer should lean well over the drowning person, take a breath as\r\nbefore, and either withdraw both arms in an upward direction in front of\r\nhis body, or else act in the same way as when releasing oneself when\r\nclutched round the neck. In any case one hand must be placed on the\r\ndrowning man's shoulder, and the palm of the other hand against his\r\nchin, and at the same time one knee should be brought up against the\r\nlower part of his chest. Then, with a strong and sudden push, the arms\r\nand legs should be stretched out straight and the whole weight of the\r\nbody thrown backwards. This sudden and totally unexpected action will\r\nbreak the clutch and leave the rescuer free to get hold of the drowning\r\nperson in such a manner as to be able to bring him to land (fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--3rd Release Method.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Easiest method of carrying a person not\r\nstruggling.]\r\n\r\nThere are several practical methods of carrying a person through the\r\nwater, the easiest assistance to render being that to a swimmer attacked\r\nby cramp or exhaustion, or a drowning person who may be obedient and\r\nremain quiet when approached and assured of safety. Then the person\r\nassisted should place his arms on the rescuer's shoulders, close to the\r\nneck, with the arms at full stretch, lie on his back perfectly still,\r\nwith the head well back. The rescuer will then be uppermost, and having\r\nhis arms and legs free can, with the breast stroke, make rapid progress\r\nto the shore; indeed a good pace can easily be made (fig. 4). In this,\r\nas in the other methods afterwards described, every care should be taken\r\nto keep the face of the drowning person above the water. All jerking,\r\nstruggling or tugging should be avoided, and the stroke of the legs be\r\nregular and well timed, thus husbanding strength for further effort. The\r\ndrowning person being able to breathe with freedom is reassured, and is\r\nlikely to cease struggling, feeling that he is in safe hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--1st Rescue Method.]\r\n\r\nWhen a drowning person is not struggling, but yet seems likely to do so\r\nwhen approached, the best method of rescue is to swim straight up, turn\r\nhim on his back, and then place the hands on either side of his face.\r\nThen the rescuer should lie on his back, holding the drowning man in\r\nfront of him, and swim with the back stroke, always taking care to keep\r\nthe man's face above water (fig. 5). If the man be struggling and in a\r\ncondition difficult to manage, he should be turned on his back as\r\nbefore, and a firm hold taken of his arms just above his elbows. Then\r\nthe man's arms should be drawn up at right angles to his body and the\r\nrescuer should start swimming with the back stroke (fig. 6). He should\r\ntake particular care not to go against the current or stream, and\r\nthereby avoid exhaustion. If the arms be difficult to grasp, or the\r\nstruggling so violent as to prevent a firm hold, the rescuer should slip\r\nhis hands under the armpits of the drowning person, and place them on\r\nhis chest or round his arms, then raise them at right angles to his\r\nbody, thus placing the drowning person completely in his power. The\r\njourney to land can then be made by swimming on the back as in the other\r\nmethods (fig. 7). In carrying a person through the water, it will be of\r\nmuch advantage to keep his elbows well out from the sides, as this\r\nexpands the chest, inflates the lungs and adds to his buoyancy. The legs\r\nshould be kept well up to the surface and the whole body as horizontal\r\nas possible. This avoids a drag through the water, and will considerably\r\nhelp the rescuer. In some cases it may happen that the drowning person\r\nhas sunk to the bottom and does not rise again. In that event the\r\nrescuer should look for bubbles rising to the surface before diving in.\r\nIn still water the bubbles rise perpendicularly; in running water they\r\nrise obliquely, so that the rescuer must look for his object higher up\r\nthe stream than where the bubbles rise. It is also well to remember that\r\nin running water a body may be carried along by the current and must be\r\nlooked for in the direction in which it flows. When a drowning person is\r\nrecovered on the bottom, the rescuer should seize him by the head or\r\nshoulders, place the left foot on the ground and the right knee in the\r\nsmall of his back, and then, with a vigorous push, come to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--2nd Rescue Method.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--3rd Rescue Method.]\r\n\r\nWhen the rescuer reaches land with an insensible person, no time should\r\nbe lost in sending for a medical man, but in the meantime an attempt to\r\ninduce artificial respiration may be made. The first recorded cases of\r\nresuscitating the apparently drowned are mentioned in the notes to\r\nWilliam Derham's _Physico-Theology_, as having occurred at Troningholm\r\nand Oxford, about 1650. In 1745 Dr J. Fothergill read a paper on the\r\nsubject before the Royal Society. It dealt with the recovery of a man\r\ndead in appearance by distending the lungs by Mr William Tossack,\r\nsurgeon in Alloa, in 1744. In 1767 several cases of resuscitation were\r\nreported in Switzerland, and shortly after a society was formed at\r\nAmsterdam for recovery of the apparently drowned, and to instruct the\r\ncommon people as to the best manner of treating them when rescued, and\r\nto reward the people for their services. In 1773 Dr A. Johnson suggested\r\nthe formation of a similar society in England, and Dr Thomas Cogan\r\ntranslated the memoirs of the Amsterdam society. Dr William Hawes\r\nsecured a copy and tried to form a society. There was, however, a strong\r\nprejudice against the idea, but he publicly offered rewards to persons\r\nwho, between Westminster and London Bridges, should rescue drowning\r\npersons and bring them to certain places on shore in order that\r\nresuscitation might be attempted. In this way he was instrumental in the\r\nsaving of several lives, and paid the rewards out of his own pocket,\r\nuntil his zeal brought him sympathy and the Royal Humane Society was\r\nfounded. This was in 1774. The system then in vogue was a means of\r\ninducing artificial respiration by inserting the pipe of a pair of\r\nbellows into one nostril and closing the other. Air was forced into the\r\nlungs and then expelled by pressing the chest, thus imitating\r\nrespiration. Dr Hawes used for his resuscitation work a kind of cradle,\r\nin which the subject was placed, and then raised over a furnace.\r\nBleeding, holding up by the heels, rolling on casks, &c. were at various\r\ntimes resorted to. Simple means are often as effective as the official\r\nones. In 1891 a subject was restored in Australia by being held over a\r\nsmoky fire, which is the native method of restoring life; while a few\r\nyears back, at an English riverside town, a patient was saved by the\r\nplacing of a handkerchief over his mouth and the alternate blowing into\r\nand drawing air out of the lungs until natural breathing was restored.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest methods of resuscitation was that of Dr Marshall Hall\r\n(1790-1857), introduced in 1856. In this method the operator takes his\r\nplace at the patient's left side, and places a roll of clothing or\r\npillow (which must be the same length as that used in the previous\r\nmethods), so that it may be in position under the chest when the patient\r\nis turned over. The assistant at the head pays particular attention to\r\nthe patient's arms, that they may not be laid upon or twisted at the\r\nwrists, elbows, hands or shoulders. The patient is then turned face\r\ndownwards, with the body reclining over the pillow, the operator makes a\r\nfirm pressure with the hand upon the back, between and on the shoulder\r\nblades, he then pulls the patient slowly up on to the side towards\r\nhimself. Once in position, the operator pushes the patient back again\r\nuntil the face is downward, when the pressure on the back is to be\r\nrepeated. These three movements must be continued at the rate of about\r\nfifteen times a minute, until natural breathing has been restored.\r\n\r\nThen came the methods of Dr H. R. Silvester and Dr Benjamin Howard, of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nWhen using the Silvester method, or, for the matter of that, any other\r\nmethod, the first thing to do is to send for medical assistance. Dr\r\nSilvester recommended that the patient should not be carried face\r\ndownwards or held up by his feet. All rough usage should be avoided,\r\nespecially twisting or bending of limbs, and the patient must not be\r\nallowed to remain on the back unless the tongue is pulled forward. In\r\nthe event of respiration not being entirely suspended when a person is\r\nlifted out of the water, it may not be necessary to imitate breathing,\r\nbut natural respiration may be assisted by the application of an\r\nirritant substance to the nostrils and tickling the nose.\r\nSmelling-salts, pepper and snuff may be used, or hot and cold water\r\nalternately dashed on the face or chest. Provided no sign of life can be\r\nseen or felt or the heart's action heard, promotion of breathing, _not_\r\ncirculation must be the first aim and effort. Lay the patient flat on\r\nhis back, with the head at a slightly higher level than the feet. Remove\r\nall tight clothing about the neck, chest and abdomen, and loosen the\r\nbraces, belts or corsets. The operator taking his place at the head,\r\nwith an assistant on one side, will turn the patient over until he is\r\nlying face downwards, his head resting upon one arm. He should then,\r\nafter the assistant has given one or two sharp blows with the open hand\r\nbetween the shoulder blades, wipe and clear the mouth, throat and\r\nnostrils of all matter that may prevent the air from entering the lungs,\r\nusing a handkerchief for this purpose. This being done, the patient\r\nshould be turned upon his back, the tongue pulled forward and kept in\r\nposition by means of a dry cloth, handkerchief or piece of string tied\r\nround the jaw. Every care must be taken not to let it fall back into the\r\nmouth and thus obstruct the air passages. When this work has been\r\naccomplished (it should only last a few seconds) the operator at the\r\nhead should lift the patient, handling the head and shoulders very\r\ncarefully, in order that the assistant may place a roll of clothing or\r\npillow under the shoulder blades. The roll being placed in position, the\r\noperator will lean forward and grasp the arms below the elbows. He will\r\nthen draw the patient's arms steadily upwards and outwards, above the\r\nhead, until fully extended in line with the body. Having held the arms\r\nin this position for about one second, the operator will carry them back\r\nagain and press them firmly against the side and front of the chest for\r\nanother second. By these means an exchange of air is produced in the\r\nlungs similar to that effected by natural respiration. These movements\r\nmust be repeated carefully and deliberately about fifteen times a\r\nminute, and persevered in. When natural respiration is once established,\r\nthe operator should cease to imitate the movements of breathing, and\r\nproceed with the treatment for _the promotion of warmth and\r\ncirculation_.\r\n\r\nFriction over the surface of the body must be at once resorted to, using\r\nhandkerchiefs, flannels, &c., so as to propel the blood along the veins\r\ntowards the heart, while the operator attends to the mouth, nose and\r\nthroat. The friction along the legs, arms and body should all be towards\r\nthe heart and should be continued after the patient has been wrapped in\r\nblankets or some dry clothing. As soon as possible, the patient should\r\nbe removed to the nearest house and further efforts made to promote\r\nwarmth by the application of hot flannels to the pit of the stomach, and\r\nbottles or bladders of hot water, heated bricks, &c. to the armpits,\r\nbetween the thighs and to the soles of the feet. If there be pain or\r\ndifficulty in breathing, apply a hot linseed meal poultice to the chest.\r\nOn the restoration of life, a teaspoonful of warm water should be given;\r\nand then, if the power of swallowing has returned, very small quantities\r\nof wine, warm brandy and water, beef tea or coffee administered, the\r\npatient kept in bed, and a disposition to sleep encouraged. The patient\r\nshould be carefully watched for some time to see that breathing does not\r\nfail, and, should any signs of failure appear, artificial respiration\r\nshould at once be resumed. While the patient is in the house, care\r\nshould be taken to let the air circulate freely about the room and all\r\novercrowding should be prevented.\r\n\r\nIn the Howard method there are only two movements; its knowledge is said\r\nto be necessary in case the patient's arm be in any way injured, or a\r\nmore vigorous method than the \"Silvester\" deemed necessary, _but care\r\nshould be exercised not to injure the patient by too forcible pressure_.\r\nThe patient is laid on his back, the roll is larger than that used in\r\nthe Silvester method, and is placed farther under the back in order that\r\nthe lower part of the chest may be highest. After adjusting the roll,\r\nthe operator kneels astride of the patient, while his assistant goes to\r\nthe head, lifts the patient's arms beyond the head, and holds them to\r\nthe ground, cleans the mouth and nose, and attends to the tongue. The\r\noperator, with his fingers spread well apart, taking care that the\r\nthumbs do not press into the pit of the stomach, grasps the most\r\ncompressible part of the lower ribs, and with both hands applies\r\npressure firmly by leaning over the patient; then he springs back,\r\nlifting his hands off the patient. Artificial respiration is thus\r\neffected, and continued at the rate of about fifteen times a minute.\r\nWhen natural breathing has been restored, the treatment is the same as\r\nin the Silvester method.\r\n\r\nThese methods have now been superseded by the Schäfer method, which has\r\nbeen taken up by the Royal Life Saving Society, a body instituted in\r\n1891 for the promotion of technical education in life saving and\r\nresuscitation of the apparently drowned. The Schäfer method has much to\r\nrecommend it, owing to its extreme simplicity and the ease with which\r\nthe physical operations necessary to carry on artificial respiration may\r\nbe performed, hardly any muscular exertion being required. It involves\r\nno risk of injury to the congested liver or to any other organ, and as\r\nthe patient is laid face downwards, there is no possibility of the air\r\npassages being blocked by the falling back of the tongue into the\r\npharynx. The water and mucus can also be expelled much more readily from\r\nthe air passages through the mouth and nostrils.\r\n\r\nIt was due to the happy selection of Professor E. A. Schäfer, as\r\nchairman of a committee appointed by the Royal Medical & Chirurgical\r\nSociety for the investigation of the methods in use for resuscitation of\r\nthe apparently drowned, that the new method was devised. This committee\r\nmade many experiments upon the cadaver but failed to arrive at any\r\ndefinite conclusion by that means. The necessity then appeared of\r\nthorough investigation of the subject by experiments upon animals, so\r\nthat the phenomena attendant upon drowning might be better known, and\r\nthe various methods of resuscitation properly tried. These experiments\r\nwere made in Edinburgh by Professor Schäfer, with the co-operation of\r\nDr P. T. Herring, and the results obtained were embodied in the report\r\nof the committee, which was presented to the Royal Medical and\r\nChirurgical Society in 1904, and published as a supplement to volume 86\r\nof the _Transactions_ of the society. As the direct outcome of these\r\nexperiments, Professor Schäfer was led to believe that a pressure method\r\nof resuscitation was not only simpler to perform but also more\r\nefficacious than any other. This conclusion was put to the test by\r\nmeasurements of the results obtained upon the normal human subject by\r\nthe various methods in vogue; from these measurements, which were\r\npublished in the _Proceedings_ of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in\r\nDecember 1903, it appeared that when such pressure is exerted in the\r\nprone position the highest degree of efficiency as well as simplicity is\r\nobtained. The description of this method was communicated to the Royal\r\nMedical and Chirurgical Society, and was published in the following year\r\n(1904) in volume 87 of the _Transactions_ of the society.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that by investigating the phenomena of drowning, and\r\nthe means of resuscitation in dogs, and by applying the results obtained\r\nto man, the method which the society now advocates as the best was\r\narrived at. In the experiments referred to, it was found necessary to\r\ndrown 38 dogs, all but two of which were from first to last in a\r\ncomplete state of anaesthesia, the two exceptions having been simply\r\ndrowned without anaesthesia. It is important that the public should\r\nunderstand that the evolution of a method which will probably be the\r\nmeans of saving thousands of lives has resulted from the painless\r\nsacrifice of less than 40 dogs, a number which would doubtless in any\r\ncase have been destroyed by drowning or some other form of suffocation,\r\nbut without the benefit of the anaesthetics which were employed in the\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 8..--Schäfer method of treatment of the apparently\r\ndrowned. Position A.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Schäfer method of treatment of the apparently\r\ndrowned. Position B.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Schäfer describes the method as follows:--Lay the subject face\r\ndownwards on the ground, then without stopping to remove the clothing\r\nthe operator should at once place himself in position astride or at one\r\nside of the subject, facing his head and kneeling upon one or both\r\nknees. He then places his hands flat over the lower part of the back (on\r\nthe lowest ribs), one on each side (fig. 8), and then gradually throws\r\nthe weight of his body forward on to them so as to produce firm pressure\r\n(fig. 9)--which must not be violent, or upon the patient's chest. By\r\nthis means the air, and water if any, are driven out of the patient's\r\nlungs. Immediately thereafter the operator raises his body slowly so as\r\nto remove the pressure, but the hands are left in position. This forward\r\nand backward movement is repeated every four or five seconds; in other\r\nwords, the body of the operator is swayed slowly forwards and backwards\r\nupon the arms from twelve to fifteen times a minute, and should be\r\ncontinued for at least half an hour, or until the natural respirations\r\nare resumed. Whilst one person is carrying out artificial respiration in\r\nthis way, others may, if there be opportunity, busy themselves with\r\napplying hot flannels to the body and limbs, and hot bottles to the\r\nfeet, but no attempt should be made to remove the wet clothing or to\r\ngive any restoratives by the mouth until natural breathing has\r\nrecommenced.\r\n\r\nIn his paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in December 1903\r\nProfessor Schäfer gave the following table of the relative exchanges of\r\nair under different methods:--\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+--------+---------------+--------------+\r\n  |                              | Number | Amount of air |Amount of air |\r\n  |      Mode of Respiration.    |  per   | exchanged per |exchanged per |\r\n  |                              | minute.|  respiration. |   minute.    |\r\n  +------------------------------+--------+---------------+--------------+\r\n  | Natural respiration (supine) |  13    |     489 c.c.  |   6.460 c.c. |\r\n  | Natural      \"    (prone)    |  12.5  |     422  \"    |   5.240  \"   |\r\n  | Prone (pressure), \"Schäfer\"  |  13    |     520  \"    |   6.760  \"   |\r\n  | Supine (pressure), \"Howard\"  |  13.6  |     295  \"    |   4.020  \"   |\r\n  | Rolling (with pressure),     |        |               |              |\r\n  |   \"Marshall Hall\"            |  13    |     254  \"    |   3.300  \"   |\r\n  | Rolling (without pressure),  |        |               |              |\r\n  |   \"Marshall Hall\"            |  12    |     192  \"    |   2.300  \"   |\r\n  | Traction (with pressure),    |        |               |              |\r\n  |   \"Silvester\"                |  12.8  |     178  \"    |   2.280  \"   |\r\n  +------------------------------+--------+---------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nThese experiments all tend to show that by far the most efficient method\r\nof performing artificial respiration is that of intermittent pressure\r\nupon the lower ribs with the subject in the prone position or face\r\ndownward. It is also the easiest to perform, requiring practically no\r\nexertion, as the weight of the operator's body produces the effect, and\r\nthe swinging forwards and backwards of the body some thirteen times a\r\nminute, which alone is required, is by no means fatiguing, and has the\r\nfurther great advantage that it can be effectively carried out by one\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n  See Taylor, _Medical Jurisprudence_; \"Description of a simple and\r\n  efficient method of performing artificial respiration in the human\r\n  subject, especially in cases of drowning,\" by E. A. Schäfer, F.R.S.\r\n  (vol. 87, _Medico-Chirurgical Society's Transactions_); \"The relative\r\n  efficiency of certain methods of performing artificial respiration in\r\n  man,\" by E. A. Schäfer, F.R.S. (vol. 23, part i. _Proceedings of the\r\n  Royal Society of Edinburgh_); _A Method for the Treatment of the\r\n  Apparently Drowned_, by R. S. Bowles (London, 1903); _Handbook of\r\n  Instruction_, Royal Life Saving Society (London, 1908).     (W. HY.)\r\n\r\n_Penal Use of Drowning._--As a form of capital punishment, drowning was\r\nonce common throughout Europe, but it is now only practised in\r\nMahommedan countries and the Far East. Tacitus states that the ancient\r\nGermans hanged criminals of any rank, but those of the low classes were\r\ndrowned beneath hurdles in fens and bogs. The Romans also drowned\r\nconvicts. The Lex Cornelia ordained that parricides should be sewn in a\r\nsack with a dog, cock, viper and ape, and thrown into the sea. The law\r\nof ancient Burgundy ordered that an unfaithful wife should be smothered\r\nin mud. The Anglo-Saxon punishment for women guilty of theft was\r\ndrowning. So usual was the penalty in the middle ages that grants of\r\nlife and death jurisdiction were worded to be \"_cum fossa et furca_\"\r\n(i.e. \"with drowning-pit and gallows\"). The owner of Baynard's Castle,\r\nLondon, in the reign of John, had powers of trying criminals, and his\r\ndescendants long afterwards claimed the privileges, the most valued of\r\nwhich was the right of drowning in the Thames traitors taken within\r\ntheir jurisdiction. Drowning was the punishment ordained by Richard\r\nCoeur de Lion for any soldier of his army who killed a fellow-crusader\r\nduring the passage to the Holy Land. Drowning was usually reserved for\r\nwomen as being the least brutal form of death-penalty, but occasionally\r\na male criminal was so executed as a matter of favour. Thus in Scotland\r\nin 1526 a man convicted of theft and sacrilege was ordered to be drowned\r\n\"by the queen's special grace.\" In 1611 a man was drowned at Edinburgh\r\nfor stealing a lamb, and in 1623 eleven gipsy women suffered there. By\r\nthat date the penalty was obsolete in England. It survived in Scotland\r\ntill 1685 (the year of the drowning of the Wigtoun martyrs). The last\r\nexecution by drowning in Switzerland was in 1652, in Austria 1776, in\r\nIceland 1777; while in France during the Revolution the penalty was\r\nrevived in the terrible _Noyades_ carried out by the terrorist Jean\r\nBaptiste Carrier at Nantes. It was abolished in Russia at the beginning\r\nof the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROYSEN, JOHANN GUSTAV (1808-1884), German historian, was born on the\r\n6th of July 1808 at Treptow in Pomerania. His father, Johann Christoph\r\nDroysen, was an army chaplain, in which capacity he was present at the\r\ncelebrated siege of Kolberg in 1806-7. As a child young Droysen\r\nwitnessed some of the military operations during the War of Liberation,\r\nfor his father was pastor at Greifenhagen, in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Stettin, which was held by the French during the\r\ngreater part of 1813. The impressions of these early years laid the\r\nfoundation of the ardent attachment to Prussia which distinguished him,\r\nlike so many other historians of his generation. He was educated at the\r\ngymnasium of Stettin and at the university of Berlin; in 1829 he became\r\na master at the Graue Kloster (or Grey Friars), one of the oldest\r\nschools in Berlin; besides his work there he gave lectures at the\r\nuniversity, from 1833 as _privat-dozent_, and from 1835 as professor,\r\nwithout a salary. During these years he was occupied with classical\r\nantiquity; he published a translation of Aeschylus and a paraphrase of\r\nAristophanes, but the work by which he made himself known as a historian\r\nwas his _Geschichte Alexanders des Grossen_ (Berlin, 1833, and other\r\neditions), a book which still remains probably the best work on the\r\nsubject. It was in some ways the herald of a new school of German\r\nhistorical thought, for it shows that idealization of power and success\r\nwhich he had learnt from the teaching of Hegel. It was followed by other\r\nvolumes dealing with the successors of Alexander, published under the\r\ntitle of _Geschichte des Hellenismus_ (Hamburg, 1836-1843). A new and\r\nrevised edition of the whole work was published in 1885; it has been\r\ntranslated into French, but not into English.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Droysen was appointed professor of history at Kiel. He was at\r\nonce attracted into the political movement for the defence of the rights\r\nof the Elbe duchies, of which Kiel was the centre. Like his predecessor\r\nF. C. Dahlmann, he placed his historical learning at the service of the\r\nestates of Schleswig-Holstein and composed the address of 1844, in which\r\nthe estates protested against the claim of the king of Denmark to alter\r\nthe law of succession in the duchies. In 1848 he was elected a member of\r\nthe Frankfort parliament, and acted as secretary to the committee for\r\ndrawing up the constitution. He was a determined supporter of Prussian\r\nascendancy, and was one of the first members to retire after the king of\r\nPrussia refused the imperial crown in 1849. During the next two years he\r\ncontinued to support the cause of the duchies, and in 1850, with Carl\r\nSamwer, he published a history of the dealings of Denmark with\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, _Die Herzogthümer Schleswig-Holstein und das\r\nKönigreich Dänemark seit dem Jahre 1806_ (Hamburg, 1850). A translation\r\nwas published in London in the same year under the title _The Policy of\r\nDenmark towards the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein_. The work was one of\r\ngreat political importance, and had much to do with the formation of\r\nGerman public opinion on the rights of the duchies in their struggle\r\nwith Denmark.\r\n\r\nAfter 1851 it was impossible for him to remain at Kiel, and he was\r\nappointed to a professorship at Jena; in 1859 he was called to Berlin,\r\nwhere he remained till his death. In his later years he was almost\r\nentirely occupied with Prussian history. In 1851 he brought out a life\r\nof Count Yorck von Wartenburg (Berlin, 1851-1852, and many later\r\neditions), one of the best biographies in the German language, and then\r\nbegan his great work on the _Geschichte der preussischen Politik_\r\n(Berlin, 1855-1886). Seven volumes were published, the last not till\r\nafter his death. It forms a complete history of the growth of the\r\nPrussian monarchy down to the year 1756. This, like all Droysen's work,\r\nshows a strongly marked individuality, and a great power of tracing the\r\nmanner in which important dynamic forces worked themselves out in\r\nhistory. It was this characteristic quality of comprehensiveness that\r\nalso gave him so much influence as a teacher.\r\n\r\nDroysen, who was twice married, died in Berlin on the 19th of June 1884.\r\nHis eldest son, Gustav, is the author of several well-known historical\r\nworks, namely, _Gustav Adolf_ (Leipzig, 1869-1870); _Herzog Bernhard von\r\nWeimar_ (Leipzig, 1885); an admirable _Historischer Handatlas_ (Leipzig,\r\n1885), and several writings on various events of the Thirty Years' War.\r\nAnother son, Hans Droysen, is the author of some works on Greek history\r\nand antiquities.\r\n\r\n  See M. Duncker, _Johann Gustav Droysen, ein Nachruf_ (Berlin, 1885);\r\n  and Dahlmann-Waitz, _Quellenkunde der deutschen Geschichte_ (Leipzig,\r\n  1906).     (J. W. HE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROZ, ANTOINE GUSTAVE (1832-1895), French man of letters, son of the\r\nsculptor J. A. Droz (1807-1872), was born in Paris on the 9th of June\r\n1832. He was educated as an artist, and began to exhibit in the Salon of\r\n1857. A series of sketches dealing gaily and lightly with the intimacies\r\nof family life, published in the _Vie parisienne_ and issued in book\r\nform as _Monsieur, Madame et Bébé_ (1866), won for the author an\r\nimmediate and great success. _Entre nous_ (1867) was built on a similar\r\nplan, and was followed by some psychological novels: _Le Cahier bleu de\r\nMlle Cibot_ (1868); _Autour d'une source_ (1869); _Un Paquet de lettres_\r\n(1870); _Babolein_ (1872); _Les Étangs_ (1875); _L'Enfant_ (1885). His\r\n_Tristesses et sourires_ (1884) is a delicate analysis of the niceties\r\nof family intercourse and its difficulties. Droz's first book was\r\ntranslated into English under the title of _Papa, Mamma and Baby_\r\n(1887). _Un Été à la campagne_, a book which caused considerable\r\nscandal, was erroneously attributed to him. He died on the 22nd of\r\nOctober 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDROZ, FRANÇOIS-XAVIER JOSEPH (1773-1850), French writer on ethics and\r\npolitical science, was born on the 31st of October 1773 at Besançon,\r\nwhere his family had furnished men of considerable mark to the legal\r\nprofession. His own legal studies led him to Paris in 1792; he arrived\r\non the very day after the dethronement of the king, and was present\r\nduring the massacres of September; on the declaration of war he joined\r\nthe volunteer _bataillon_ of the Doubs, and for the next three years\r\nserved in the Army of the Rhine. Receiving his discharge on the score of\r\nill-health, he obtained a much more congenial post in the newly-founded\r\n_école centrale_ of Besançon; and in 1799 he made his first appearance\r\nas an author by an _Essai sur l'art oratoire_ (Paris, Fructidor, An\r\nVII.), in which he acknowledges his indebtedness more especially to Hugh\r\nBlair. Removing to Paris in 1803, he became intimate not only with the\r\nlike-minded Ducis, but also with the sceptical Cabanis; and it was on\r\nthis philosopher's advice that, in order to catch the public ear, he\r\nproduced the romance of _Lina_, which Sainte-Beuve has characterized as\r\na mingled echo of Florian and _Werther_. Like several other literary men\r\nof the time, he obtained a post in the revenue office known as the\r\n_Droits réunis_; but from 1814 he devoted himself exclusively to\r\nliterature and became a contributor to various journals. Already\r\nfavourably known by his _Essai sur l'art d'être heureux_ (Paris, 1806),\r\nhis _Éloge de Montaigne_ (1812), and his _Essai sur le beau dans les\r\narts_ (1815), he not only gained the Monthyon prize in 1823 by his work\r\n_De la philosophie morale ou des différents systèmes sur la science de\r\nla vie_, but also in 1824 obtained admission to the Académie Française.\r\nThe main doctrine inculcated in this last treatise is that society will\r\nnever be in a proper state till men have been educated to think of their\r\nduties and not of their rights. It was followed in 1825 by _Application\r\nde la morale à la philosophie et à la politique_, and in 1829 by\r\n_Économie politique, ou principes de la science des richesses_, a\r\nmethodical and clearly written treatise, which was edited by Michel\r\nChevalier in 1854. His next and greatest work was a _Histoire du règne\r\nde Louis XVI_ (3 vols., Paris, 1839-1842). As he advanced in life Droz\r\nbecame more and more decidedly religious, and the last work of his\r\nprolific pen was _Pensées du Christianisme_ (1842). Few have left so\r\nblameless a reputation: in the words of Sainte-Beuve, he was born and he\r\nremained all his life of the race of the good and the just.\r\n\r\n  See Guizot, _Discours académiques_; Montalembert, \"Discours de\r\n  réception,\" in _Mémoires de l'Académie française_; Sainte-Beuve,\r\n  _Causeries du lundi_, t. iii.; Michel Chevalier, Notice prefixed to\r\n  the _Économie politique_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUG, a district and town of British India, in the Chhattisgarh division\r\nof the Central Provinces. The district was formed in 1906 out of\r\nportions of the districts of Bilaspur and Raipur. It has an area of 3807\r\nsq. m., and the population on that area in 1901 was 628,885, showing a\r\nheavy decrease in the preceding decade, owing to the famines of 1897 and\r\n1900. The district is a long narrow tract, with lofty ridges of gravel\r\nin the centre and north, but otherwise consisting of open rolling\r\ncountry. The Tendula and Seonath are the principal rivers. Rich black\r\nsoil covers a large part of the district, and rice, wheat and other\r\ncrops are grown. The main line of the Bengal-Nagpur railway passes\r\nthrough the district. Drug, the capital of the district, is on the\r\nrailway, 685 m. from Bombay, and had in 1901 a population of 4002.\r\nBell-metal-founding and cotton-weaving are carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUG (from Fr. _drogue_, a word common in Romance languages, cf. Span.\r\nand Ital. _droga_; the origin of the word is obscure, but may possibly\r\nbe connected with Dutch _droog_, dry), any organic and inorganic\r\nsubstance used in the preparation of medicines, by itself or in\r\ncombination with others, and either prepared by some method or used in a\r\nnatural state (see PHARMACOLOGY and PHARMACOPOEIA). In a particular\r\nsense \"drug\" is often used synonymously for narcotics or poisonous\r\nsubstances, and hence \"to drug\" means to stupefy or poison. The word is\r\nalso applied to any article for which there is no sale, or of which the\r\nvalue has greatly depreciated--a \"drug in the market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUIDISM, the name usually given to the religious system of the ancient\r\ninhabitants of Gaul and the British Islands. The word Druid (Lat.\r\n_druida_) probably represents a Gaulish _druid-s_, Irish _drúi_, gen.\r\nsing. _drúad_. On the analogy of Irish _súi<su-vid-s_ the word has been\r\nanalysed into _dru-vid-_, \"very knowing, wise.\" The ancient Welsh form\r\nof the word does not exist. Welsh _derwydd_ and _dryw_ are probably to\r\nbe regarded as of recent coinage, as also the Breton forms _drouiz_,\r\n_druz_. The important part played by the oak in the religious cults of\r\nother countries suggests a connexion with Greek [Greek: drus], oak, but\r\nthis etymology is rather in disfavour at the present time.\r\n\r\nWe find in Caesar the first and at the same time the most circumstantial\r\naccount of the Druids to be met with in the classical writers. He tells\r\nus that all men of any rank and dignity in Gaul were included among the\r\nDruids or the nobles. In other words, the Druids constituted the learned\r\nand the priestly class, and they were in addition the chief expounders\r\nand guardians of the law. We are, however, informed by Diodorus and\r\nStrabo that this class was composed of Druids, bards and soothsayers.\r\nHence Caesar seems to assign more extensive functions to the Druids than\r\nthey actually possessed. The substance of Caesar's account is as\r\nfollows. On those who refused to submit to their decisions they had the\r\npower of inflicting severe penalties, of which excommunication from\r\nsociety was the most dreaded. As they were not a hereditary caste and\r\nenjoyed exemption from service in the field as well as from payment of\r\ntaxes, admission to the order was eagerly sought after by the youth of\r\nGaul. The course of training to which a novice had to submit was\r\nprotracted, extending sometimes over twenty years. All instruction was\r\ncommunicated orally, but for ordinary purposes they had a written\r\nlanguage in which they used the Greek characters. The president of the\r\norder, whose office was elective and who enjoyed the dignity for life,\r\nhad supreme authority among them. They taught that the soul was\r\nimmortal. Astrology, geography, physical science and natural theology\r\nwere their favourite studies.\r\n\r\nBritain was the headquarters of Druidism, but once every year a general\r\nassembly of the order was held within the territories of the Carnutes in\r\nGaul. The Gauls were accustomed to offer human sacrifices, usually\r\ncriminals. Cicero remarks on the existence among the Gauls of augurs or\r\nsoothsayers, known by the name of Druids, with one of whom, Divitiacus,\r\nan Aeduan, he was acquainted. Diodorus informs us that a sacrifice\r\nacceptable to the gods must be attended by a Druid, for they are the\r\nintermediaries. Before a battle they often throw themselves between two\r\narmies to bring about peace. They are said to have had a firm belief in\r\nthe immortality of the soul and in metempsychosis, a fact which led\r\nseveral ancient writers to conclude that they had been influenced by the\r\nteaching of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras.\r\n\r\nA rescript of Augustus forbade Roman citizens to practise druidical\r\nrites. In Strabo we find the Druids still acting as arbiters in public\r\nand private matters, but they no longer deal with cases of murder. Under\r\nTiberius the Druids were suppressed by a decree of the senate, but this\r\nhad to be renewed by Claudius in A.D. 54. In Mela we find the Druids\r\nteaching in the depths of a forest or in caverns. In Pliny their\r\nactivity is limited to the practice of medicine and sorcery. According\r\nto this writer the Druids held the mistletoe in the highest veneration.\r\nGroves of oak were their chosen retreat. Whatever grew on that tree was\r\nthought to be a gift from heaven, more especially the mistletoe. When\r\nthus found, the mistletoe was cut with a golden knife by a priest clad\r\nin a white robe, two white bulls being sacrificed on the spot. Tacitus,\r\nin describing the attack made on the island of Mona (Anglesea) by the\r\nRomans under Suetonius Paulinus, represents the legionaries as being\r\nawe-struck on landing by the appearance of a band of Druids, who, with\r\nhands uplifted towards heaven, poured forth terrible imprecations on the\r\nheads of the invaders. The courage of the Romans, however, soon overcame\r\nsuch fears; the Britons were put to flight; and the groves of Mona, the\r\nscene of many a sacrifice and bloody rite, were cut down.\r\n\r\nAfter this the continental Druids disappear entirely, and are only\r\nreferred to on very rare occasions. Ausonius, for instance,\r\napostrophizes the rhetorician Attius Patera as sprung from a race of\r\nDruids.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the British Islands we find, as we should expect, no\r\ntraces of the Druids in England and Wales after the conquest of Anglesea\r\nmentioned above, except in the story of Vortigern as recounted by\r\nNennius. After being excommunicated by Germanus the British leader\r\ninvites twelve Druids to assist him. These probably came from North\r\nBritain. In Irish literature, however, the Druids are frequently\r\nmentioned, and their functions in the island seem to correspond fairly\r\nwell to those of their Gaulish brethren described by classical writers.\r\nThe functions of Caesar's Druids we here find distributed amongst\r\nDruids, bards and poets (_fili_), but even in very early times the poet\r\nhas usurped many of the duties of the Druid and finally supplants him\r\nwith the spread of Christianity. The following is the position of the\r\nDruid in the pagan literature. The most important documents are\r\ncontained in MSS. of the 12th century, but the texts themselves go back\r\nin large measure to about A.D. 700. In the heroic cycles the Druids do\r\nnot appear to have formed any corporation, nor do they seem to have been\r\nexempt from military service. Cathbu (Cathbad), the Druid connected with\r\nConchobar, king of Ulster, in the older cycle is accompanied by a number\r\nof youths (100 according to the oldest version) who are desirous of\r\nlearning his art, though what this consisted in we are not told. The\r\nDruids are represented as being able to foretell the future and to\r\nperform magic. Before setting out on the great expedition against\r\nUlster, Medb, queen of Connaught, goes to consult her Druid, and just\r\nbefore the famous heroine Derdriu (Deirdre) is born, Cathbu prophesies\r\nwhat sort of a woman she will be. We may cite two instances of the\r\nmagical skill of the Druids. The hero Cuchulinn has returned from the\r\nland of the fairies after having been enticed thither by a fairy-woman\r\nnamed Fand, whom he is now unable to forget. He is given a potion by\r\nsome Druids, which banishes all memory of his recent adventures and\r\nwhich also rids his wife Emer of the pangs of jealousy. More remarkable\r\nstill is the story of Etain. This lady, now the wife of Eochaid Airem,\r\nhigh-king of Ireland, was in a former existence the beloved of the god\r\nMider, who again seeks her love and carries her off. The king has\r\nrecourse to his Druid Dal[=a]n, who requires a whole year to discover\r\nthe haunt of the couple. This he accomplished by means of four wands of\r\nyew inscribed with ogam characters. The following description of the\r\nband of Cathbu's Druids occurs in the epic tale, the _Cattle-spoiling of\r\nCualnge_ (Cooley): \"The attendant raises his eyes towards heaven and\r\nobserves the clouds and answers the band around him. They all raise\r\ntheir eyes towards heaven, observe the clouds, and hurl spells against\r\nthe elements, so that they arouse strife amongst them and clouds of fire\r\nare driven towards the camp of the men of Ireland.\" We are further told\r\nthat at the court of Conchobar no one had the right to speak before the\r\nDruids had spoken. In other texts the Druids are able to produce\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nIn the religious literature they are almost exclusively represented as\r\nmagicians and diviners opposing the Christian missionaries, though we\r\nfind two of them acting as tutors to the daughters of Laegaire, the\r\nhigh-king, at the coming of St Patrick. They are represented as\r\nendeavouring to prevent the progress of St Patrick and St Columba by\r\nraising clouds and mist. Before the battle of Culdremne (561) a Druid\r\nmade an _airbe drúad_ (fence of protection?) round one of the armies,\r\nbut what is precisely meant by the phrase is obscure. The Irish Druids\r\nseem to have had a peculiar tonsure. The word _drúi_ is always used to\r\nrender the Latin _magus_, and in one passage St Columba speaks of Christ\r\nas his Druid.\r\n\r\n  See D'Arbois de Jubainville, _Les Druides et les dieux celtiques à\r\n  forme d'animaux_ (Paris, 1906), and _Introduction à l'étude de la\r\n  littérature celtique_ (Paris, 1883); P. W. Joyce, _A Social History of\r\n  Ancient Ireland_ (London, 1903).     (E. C. Q.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUIDS, ORDER OF, a friendly society founded, as an imitation of the\r\nancient Druids, in London in 1781. They adopted Masonic rites and spread\r\nto America (1833) and Australia. Their lodges are called \"Groves.\" In\r\n1872 the Order was introduced into Germany. (See FRIENDLY SOCIETIES.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUM (early forms _drome_ or _dromme_, a word common to many Teut.\r\nlanguages, cf. Dan. _tromme_, Ger. _Trommel_: the word is ultimately the\r\nsame as \"trumpet,\" and is probably onomatopoeic in origin; it appears\r\nlate in Eng. about the middle of the 16th century), the name given to\r\nthe well-known musical instrument (see below) and also to many objects\r\nresembling it in shape. Thus it is used of any receptacle of similar\r\nshape, as a \"drum\" of oil, &c.; in machinery, of a revolving cylinder,\r\nround which belting is passed; of the _tympanum_ or cylindrically shaped\r\nmiddle ear, and specially of the membrane that closes the external\r\nauditory meatus; and, in architecture, of the substructure of a dome\r\nwhen raised to some height above the pendentives. The architectural drum\r\nhad a twofold object; first, to give greater elevation to the dome\r\nexternally so that it should rise well above the surrounding building,\r\nand secondly, to allow of the interior being lighted with vertical\r\nwindows cut in the drum, instead of forming penetrations in the dome\r\nitself, as in St Sophia, Constantinople. The term is also applied to the\r\ncircular blocks of stone, which in columns of large dimensions were\r\nbuilt with a series of drums. At Selinus in Sicily some of these great\r\ncircular blocks are found on the road between the quarries and the\r\ntemples; they vary from 8 to 10 ft. in diameter, being about 6 ft. high.\r\nThe term _frusta_ is sometimes applied to them.\r\n\r\nIn music the drum (Fr. _tambour_; Ger. _Trommel_; Ital. _tamburo_) is an\r\ninstrument of percussion common in some form to all nations and ages. It\r\nconsists of a frame or vessel forming a resonant cavity, over one or\r\nboth ends of which is stretched a skin or vellum set in vibration by\r\ndirect percussion of hand or stick. Drums fall into two divisions\r\naccording to the nature of their sonority:--(1) instruments producing\r\nsounds of definite musical pitch, and qualified thereby to take part in\r\nthe harmony of the orchestra, such as the kettledrum (q.v.); (2)\r\ninstruments of indefinite sonorousness, and therefore excluded from the\r\nharmony of the orchestra; such are the bass drum, the side or snare\r\ndrum, the tenor drum, the tambourine, all used for marking the rhythm\r\nand adding tone colour.\r\n\r\nDrums are further divided into three classes according to special\r\nfeatures of construction:--(1) instruments having a skin stretched over\r\none end of the resonant cavity, the other being open, such as the\r\ntambourine (q.v.) and the _darabukkeh_ or Egyptian drum, shaped like a\r\nmushroom; (2) instruments consisting of a cup-shaped receptacle of\r\nmetal, wood or earthenware entirely closed by a skin or vellum stretched\r\nacross the opening, as in the kettledrum; (3) a receptacle in the shape\r\nof a cylinder closed at both ends by skins, as in the bass drum, side\r\ndrum, &c.\r\n\r\nSkin or parchment only acquires the elasticity requisite to produce\r\nvibration by tension; the vibrations of the parchment are taken up by\r\nthe air enclosed in the receptacle, which thus reinforces the sound\r\nproduced by the parchment. The _tone_ of the instrument whether definite\r\nor indefinite depends upon the dimensions of the vellum, the shape of\r\nthe resonant receptacle, and the method of percussion. The _intensity_\r\nof the sound depends upon the degree of percussive force used and the\r\ndiameter of the vellum in proportion to the dimensions of the resonant\r\nreceptacle; the material of which the latter consists has little or no\r\ninfluence on the tone of the instrument. The _pitch_ of the sound is\r\ndetermined by the dimensions of the vellum taken in conjunction with the\r\ndegree of tension, the pitch varying in acuteness directly with the\r\ndegree of tension and inversely with the size of the vellum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Military Bass Drum (Besson & Co.)]\r\n\r\nThe _bass drum_ or Turkish drum (Fr. _grosse caisse_; Ger. _Grosse\r\nTrommel_; Ital. _gran cassa_ or _tamburo grande_) consists of a short\r\ncylinder of very wide diameter covered at both ends by vellum stretched\r\nover thin hoops, which in turn are kept in place by larger hoops fitting\r\ntightly over them. At regular intervals in the two large hoops are bored\r\nholes through which passes an endless cord stretched in zig-zag round\r\nthe cylinder and connecting the two hoops. The tension of the vellum is\r\ncontrolled by means of leather braces which are made to slide up and\r\ndown the zig-zag of cord, slackening or tightening the large hoops, and\r\nwith them the vellum, at the will of the performer. Systems of rods and\r\nscrews are also used for the purpose. The bass drum is mounted on a\r\nstand when used in the orchestra. The sound is produced by striking the\r\ncentre of the vellum on the one end of the drum with a stick having a\r\nlarge soft round knob composed of wood covered with cork, sponge or\r\nfelt. The bass drum cannot be tuned since it gives out no definite note,\r\nbut the pitch may be varied, according as a rich full tone or a mere\r\ndull thud be required, by tightening or loosening the braces; the\r\ninstrument can, moreover, be muffled by covering it with a piece of\r\ncloth. The music for the bass drum is generally written on a stave with\r\na bass clef, [Illustration: notes], the C being merely used to show the\r\nrhythm and accents. Sometimes the stave is dispensed with, a single note\r\non a single line being sufficient. The bass drum has a place in every\r\norchestra, although it is used but sparingly to accentuate the rhythm.\r\nIt is possible to make gradations in _forte_ and _piano_ on the bass\r\ndrum, and to play quavers and semi-quavers in moderate _tempo_. A roll\r\nis sometimes played by holding a short stick, furnished with a knob at\r\neach end, in the middle and striking in quick succession with each knob\r\nalternately; two kettledrum sticks answer the purpose still better. It\r\nis understood that the cymbals play the same music as the bass drum\r\nunless the composer has written _senza piatti_ over the part. Wagner did\r\nnot once score for the bass drum after he composed _Rienzi_, but Verdi,\r\nGounod, Berlioz and Sullivan used it effectively. The bass drum was\r\nformerly known as the _long drum_, the cylinder being long in proportion\r\nto the diameter.\r\n\r\nThe _side_ or _snare drum_ (Fr. _tambour militaire_; Ger.\r\n_Militärtrommel_; Ital. _tamburo militare_) is an instrument consisting\r\nof a small wooden or brass cylinder with a vellum at each end. The\r\nparchments are lapped over small hoops and pressed firmly down by larger\r\nhoops. As in the bass drum, these and the vellums are tightened or\r\nslackened by means of cords and leather braces, or by a system of rods\r\nand screws. Across the lower head are stretched two or more catgut\r\nstrings called snares, which produce a rattling sound at each stroke on\r\nthe upper head, owing to the sympathetic vibration of the lower head\r\nwhich jars against the snares. The upper head, set in vibration by\r\ndirect percussion from the sticks, induces sympathetic vibrations in the\r\nair contained within the resonating receptacle, and these vibrations are\r\ncommunicated to the lower head. The presence of the snares across the\r\ndiameter of the latter produces a phenomenon which gives the side drum\r\nits peculiar timbre, changing the nature of the vibrations, now no\r\nlonger free: the snares form a kind of nodal contact, inducing double\r\nthe number of vibrations and a sound approximately an octave higher than\r\nwould be the case were the heads left to vibrate freely. Moreover, the\r\nvibrations of the upper head being weaker, the latter is compelled to\r\nvibrate synchronously with the lower vellum.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Guards pattern Side Drum (Besson & Co.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Regulation Side Drum (Besson & Co.).]\r\n\r\nThe side drum, so called because it is worn at the side, is struck in\r\nthe centre by two small wooden sticks with elongated heads or knobs of\r\nhard wood, producing a hard rasping sound when the drum is played singly\r\nand in close proximity to the hearer; when, however, several drums are\r\nplayed simultaneously or with other instruments the effect is brilliant\r\nand exhilarating. The roll is produced by striking two blows alternately\r\nwith each hand quite regularly and very rapidly, the result being a\r\nrattling tremolo. This roll (\"daddy-mammy\") is very difficult to\r\nacquire, and requires long practice. The side drum can be muffled by\r\nloosening the snares or by inserting a piece of silk or cloth between\r\nthe snares and the parchment. An impressive effect is produced by a\r\ncontinued roll on muffled drums in funeral marches. The notation for the\r\nside drum is similar to that in use for the bass drum; the value of the\r\nnote is alone of importance; the place of the note on the staff is\r\nimmaterial and purely a matter of custom. In orchestral scores, a single\r\nline is often used, or the part for side and bass drum is written on the\r\nsame staff. A great variety of rhythmical figures can be played on the\r\nside drum, such as\r\n\r\n[Illustration: notes]\r\n\r\nThe _tenor drum_ (Fr. _caisse roulante_; Ger. _Roll-_ or _Rührtrommel_;\r\nItal. _tamburo rulante_) is similar to the side drum but has a larger\r\ncylinder of wood and no snares; consequently its timbre lacks the\r\nbrilliancy and incisiveness of the side drum. It is used for the roll in\r\nmilitary bands, in some theatre orchestras, and on the stage.\r\n\r\nThe _tambourin de Provence_ is a small drum with a long cylinder of\r\nnarrow diameter used in the Basque provinces with a small pipe\r\n(_galoubet_) having three holes. The drum is beaten with one stick only,\r\nthe performer steadying it with the hand which fingers the pipe. The\r\ntambourin and galoubet are in fact a survival of the pipe and tabor\r\n(q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe popularity of all kinds of drums in the most ancient civilizations\r\nis established beyond a doubt by the numerous representations of the\r\ninstrument in a variety of shapes and sizes on the monuments and\r\npaintings of Egypt, Assyria, India and Persia. The _tympanon_, under\r\nwhich name seem to have been included tambourines and kettledrums, as\r\nwell as the dulcimer (during the middle ages), was in use among Greeks\r\nand Romans chiefly in the worship of Cybele and Bacchus; it was\r\nintroduced through the medium of the Roman civilization into western\r\nEurope. It is often said that the drum was introduced by the crusaders,\r\nbut it was certainly known in England long before the crusades, for Bede\r\n(_Musica practica_) mentions it in his list of instruments, and\r\nCassiodorus (ii. p. 507) describes it. The side drum was, until the\r\nreign of Elizabeth, of a much larger size than now and was held\r\nhorizontally and beaten on one head only. It is not known at what date\r\nsnares were added; Praetorius (_Syntagma musicum_, 1618) and Mersenne\r\n(_L'Harmonie universelle_, Paris, 1636) both mention them. A drawing of\r\na side drum showing a snare appears in a book[2] from the printing press\r\nof J. Badius Ascensius (1510); the instrument also has cords and braces.\r\nAnother woodcut of the same century is given as frontispiece to an\r\nedition of Flavius Vegetius Renatus.[3] An actual side drum with two\r\ncurved drumsticks belonging to the ancient Egyptians was found during\r\nthe excavations conducted at Thebes in 1823.[4] It measured 1½ ft. in\r\nheight by 2 ft. in diameter; the tension of the heads was regulated by\r\ncords braced by means of catgut encircling both ends of the drum, and\r\nwound separately round each cord so that these could be tightened or\r\nslackened at will by pulling the catgut bands closer together or pushing\r\nthem farther apart. The Berlin Museum possesses some ancient Egyptian\r\nstraight drumsticks with handle and knob. Drums were used at the battle\r\nof Halidon Hill (1333). An old ballad celebrating Edward III.'s victory\r\non this occasion appears in a chronicle of the 14th century, preserved\r\nin the British Museum (Harl. MS. 4690),\r\n\r\n  \"This was do with merry sowne.\r\n   With pipes trumpes and tabers thereto.\r\n   And loud clariones they blew also.\"\r\n\r\nA prose account of the battle in the same MS. states that the \"Englische\r\nmynstrelles beaten their tabers and blewen their trompes and pipers\r\npipenede loude and made a great schowte upon the Skottes.\"\r\n\r\nFroissart, under date 1338, gives details of the means taken by the\r\nScots to intimidate the soldiers of Edward III.[5] Having mentioned\r\ntheir great horns, he adds, \"ils font si grand' noise avec grands\r\ntambours qu'ils ont aussi.\" The same chronicler, describing the\r\ntriumphal entry of Edward III. into Calais (1347), gives the following\r\nlist of instruments used: \"trompes, tambours, nacaires, chalemies,\r\nmuses.\"[6]\r\n\r\nDrums were used in the British army in the 16th century to give signals\r\nin war and peace-side drums by the infantry and dragoons, and\r\nkettledrums by the cavalry.[7] In the reign of Henry VIII. two drummers\r\nwere allowed to every company of 100 men. The chief drum beats used by\r\nthe infantry in the 17th century[8] were _call_, _troop_, _preparative_,\r\n_march_, _battaile_ and _retreat_; these were later[9] changed to\r\n_general_, _réveillé_, _assembly_ or _troop_, _tattoo_, _chamade_, &c.\r\nThe side drum was admitted into the orchestra in the 17th century, when\r\nMarais (1636-1728) scored for it in his opera _Alcione_.

He was the eldest son of Henry Drummond, a prominent\r\nLondon banker, by a daughter of the first Lord Melville. He was educated\r\nat Harrow and at Christ Church, Oxford, but took no degree. His name is\r\npermanently connected with the university through the chair of political\r\neconomy which he founded in 1825. He entered parliament in early life,\r\nand took an active interest from the first in nearly all departments of\r\npolitics. Thoroughly independent and often eccentric in his views, he\r\nyet acted generally with the Conservative party. His speeches were often\r\nalmost inaudible but were generally lucid and informing, and on occasion\r\ncaustic and severe. From 1847 until his death in 1860 he represented\r\nWest Surrey in parliament. Drummond took a deep interest in religious\r\nsubjects, and published numerous books and pamphlets on such questions\r\nas the interpretation of prophecy, the circulation of the Apocrypha, the\r\nprinciples of Christianity, &c., which attracted considerable attention.\r\nIn 1817 he met Robert Haldane at Geneva, and continued his movement\r\nagainst the Socinian tendencies then prevalent in that city. In later\r\nyears he was intimately associated with the origin and spread of the\r\nCatholic Apostolic Church. Meetings of those who sympathized with the\r\nviews of Edward Irving were held for the study of prophecy at Drummond's\r\nseat, Albury Park, in Surrey; he contributed very liberally to the funds\r\nof the new church; and he became one of its leading office-bearers,\r\nvisiting Scotland as an \"apostle\" and being ordained as an \"angel\" for\r\nthat kingdom. The numerous works he wrote in defence of its distinctive\r\ndoctrines and practice were generally clear and vigorous, if seldom\r\nconvincing. He died on the 20th of February 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND, HENRY (1851-1897), Scottish evangelical writer and lecturer,\r\nwas born in Stirling on the 17th of August 1851. He was educated at\r\nEdinburgh University, where he displayed a strong inclination for\r\nphysical and mathematical science. The religious element was an even\r\nmore powerful factor in his nature, and disposed him to enter the Free\r\nChurch of Scotland. While preparing for the ministry, he became for a\r\ntime deeply interested in the evangelizing mission of Moody and Sankey,\r\nin which he actively co-operated for two years. In 1877 he became\r\nlecturer on natural science in the Free Church College, which enabled\r\nhim to combine all the pursuits for which he felt a vocation. His\r\nstudies resulted in his writing _Natural Law in the Spiritual World_,\r\nthe argument of which was that the scientific principle of continuity\r\nextended from the physical world to the spiritual. Before the book\r\nissued from the press (1883), a sudden invitation from the African Lakes\r\nCompany drew Drummond away to Central Africa. Upon his return in the\r\nfollowing year he found himself famous. Large bodies of serious readers,\r\nalike among the religious and the scientific classes, discovered in\r\n_Natural Law_ the common standing-ground which they needed; and the\r\nuniversality of the demand proved, if nothing more, the seasonableness\r\nof its publication. Drummond continued to be actively interested in\r\nmissionary and other movements among the Free Church students. In 1888\r\nhe published _Tropical Africa_, a valuable digest of information. In\r\n1890 he travelled in Australia, and in 1893 delivered the Lowell\r\nLectures at Boston. It had been his intention to reserve them for mature\r\nrevision, but an attempted piracy compelled him to hasten their\r\npublication, and they appeared in 1894 under the title of _The Ascent of\r\nMan_. Their object was to vindicate for altruism, or the disinterested\r\ncare and compassion of animals for each other, an important part in\r\neffecting \"the survival of the fittest,\" a thesis previously maintained\r\nby Professor John Fiske. Drummond's health failed shortly afterwards,\r\nand he died on the 11th of March 1897. His character was full of charm.\r\nHis writings were too nicely adapted to the needs of his own day to\r\njustify the expectation that they would long survive it, but few men\r\nexercised more religious influence in their own generation, especially\r\non young men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND, THOMAS (1797-1840), British inventor and administrator, was\r\nborn at Edinburgh on the 10th of October 1797, and was educated at the\r\nhigh school there. He was appointed to a cadetship at the Royal Military\r\nAcademy, Woolwich, in 1813; and in 1815 he entered the Royal Engineers.\r\nIn 1819, when meditating the renunciation of military service for the\r\nbar, he made the acquaintance of Colonel T. F. Colby (1784-1852), from\r\nwhom in the following year he received an appointment on the\r\ntrigonometrical survey of Great Britain. During his winters in London he\r\nattended the chemical lectures of W. T. Brande and M. Faraday at the\r\nRoyal Institution, and the mention at one of these of the brilliant\r\nluminosity of lime when incandescent suggested to him the employment of\r\nthe lime light for making distant surveying stations visible. In 1825,\r\nwhen he was assisting Colby in the Irish survey, his lime-light\r\napparatus (\"Drummond light\") was put to a practical test, and enabled\r\nobservations to be completed between Divis mountain, near Belfast, and\r\nSlieve Snaght, a distance of 67 m. About the same time he also devised\r\nan improved heliostat, and in 1829 he was employed in adopting his light\r\nfor lighthouse purposes. In 1831 he entered political life and was\r\nappointed superintendent of the boundary commission. Four years later he\r\nwas made under-secretary of state for Ireland, where he proved himself a\r\nmost successful administrator, and did much to promote law and order. It\r\nwas he who in 1838 told the Irish landlords that \"property has its\r\nduties as well as its rights.\" In 1836 he proposed the appointment of a\r\ncommission on railways in Ireland, and took a large share in its work,\r\nwhich resulted in the recommendation, not, however, carried out, that\r\nthe state should construct a system of lines throughout the island.\r\nDrummond's health was undermined by overwork, and he died at Dublin on\r\nthe 15th of April 1840.\r\n\r\n  See _Life_ by J. F. M'Lennan (1867); _Life and Letters_ by R. Barry\r\n  O'Brien (1889); and Sir T. A. Larcom in _Papers on the Duties of the\r\n  Royal Engineers_, vol. iv. (1840).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND, WILLIAM (1585-1649), called \"of Hawthornden,\" Scottish poet,\r\nwas born at Hawthornden, near Edinburgh, on the 13th of December 1585.\r\nHis father, John Drummond, was the first laird of Hawthornden; and his\r\nmother was Susannah Fowler, sister of William Fowler (q.v.), poet and\r\ncourtier. Drummond received his early education at the high school of\r\nEdinburgh, and graduated in July 1605 as M.A. of the recently founded\r\nuniversity of Edinburgh. His father was a gentleman usher at the English\r\ncourt (as he had been at the Scottish court from 1590) and William, in a\r\nvisit to London in 1606, describes the festivities in connexion with the\r\nvisit of the king of Denmark. Drummond spent two years at Bourges and\r\nParis in the study of law; and, in 1609, he was again in Scotland,\r\nwhere, by the death of his father in the following year, he became laird\r\nof Hawthornden at the early age of twenty-four. The list of books he\r\nread up to this time is preserved in his own handwriting. It indicates a\r\nstrong preference for imaginative literature, and shows that he was\r\nkeenly interested in contemporary verse. His collection (now in the\r\nlibrary of the university of Edinburgh) contains many first editions of\r\nthe most famous productions of the age. On finding himself his own\r\nmaster, Drummond naturally abandoned law for the muses; \"for,\" says his\r\nbiographer in 1711, \"the delicacy of his wit always run on the\r\npleasantness and usefulness of history, and on the fame and softness of\r\npoetry.\" In 1612 began his correspondence with Sir William Alexander of\r\nMenstrie, afterwards earl of Stirling (q.v.), which ripened into a\r\nlife-long friendship after Drummond's visit to Menstrie in 1614.\r\n\r\nDrummond's first publication appeared in 1613, an elegy on the death of\r\nHenry, prince of Wales, called _Teares on the Death of Meliades_\r\n(_Moeliades_, 3rd edit. 1614). The poem shows the influence of Spenser's\r\nand Sidney's pastoralism. In the same year he published an anthology of\r\nthe elegies of Chapman, Wither and others, entitled _Mausoleum_, or _The\r\nChoisest Flowres of the Epitaphs_. In 1616, the year of Shakespeare's\r\ndeath, appeared _Poems: Amorous, Funerall, Divine, Pastorall: in\r\nSonnets, Songs, Sextains, Madrigals_, being substantially the story of\r\nhis love for Mary Cunningham of Barns, who was about to become his wife\r\nwhen she died in 1615. The poems bear marks of a close study of Sidney,\r\nand of the Italian poets. He sometimes translates direct from the\r\nItalian, especially from Marini. _Forth Feasting: A Panegyricke to the\r\nKing's Most Excellent Majestie_ (1617), a poem written in heroic\r\ncouplets of remarkable facility, celebrates James's visit to Scotland in\r\nthat year. In 1618 Drummond began a correspondence with Michael Drayton.\r\nThe two poets continued to write at intervals for thirteen years, the\r\nlast letter being dated in the year of Drayton's death. The latter had\r\nalmost been persuaded by his \"dear Drummond\" to print the later books of\r\n_Poly-Olbion_ at Hart's Edinburgh press. In the winter of 1618-1619,\r\nDrummond had included Ben Jonson in his circle of literary friends, and\r\nat Christmas 1618 was honoured with a visit of a fortnight or more from\r\nthe dramatist. The account of their conversations, long supposed to be\r\nlost, was discovered in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, by David\r\nLaing, and was edited for the Shakespeare Society in 1842 and printed by\r\nGifford & Cunningham. The conversations are full of literary gossip, and\r\nembody Ben's opinion of himself and of his host, whom he frankly told\r\nthat \"his verses were too much of the schooles, and were not after the\r\nfancie of the time,\" and again that he \"was too good and simple, and\r\nthat oft a man's modestie made a fool of his witt.\" But the publication\r\nof what was obviously intended merely for a private journal has given\r\nJonson an undeserved reputation for harsh judgments, and has cast blame\r\non Drummond for blackening his guest's memory.\r\n\r\nIn 1623 appeared the poet's fourth publication, entitled _Flowers of\r\nSion: By William Drummond of Hawthornedenne: to which is adjoyned his\r\nCypresse Grove_. From 1625 till 1630 Drummond was probably for the most\r\npart engaged in travelling on the Continent. In 1627, however, he seems\r\nto have been home for a short time, as, in that year, he appears in the\r\nentirely new character of the holder of a patent for the construction of\r\nmilitary machines, entitled \"Litera Magistri Gulielmi Drummond de\r\nFabrica Machinarum Militarium, Anno 1627.\" The same year, 1627, is the\r\ndate of Drummond's munificent gift (referred to above) of about 500\r\nvolumes to the library of the university of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIn 1630 Drummond again began to reside permanently at Hawthornden, and\r\nin 1632 he married Elizabeth Logan, by whom he had five sons and four\r\ndaughters. In 1633 Charles made his coronation-visit to Scotland; and\r\nDrummond's pen was employed in writing congratulatory speeches and\r\nverses. As Drummond preferred Episcopacy to Presbytery, and was an\r\nextremely loyal subject, he supported Charles's general policy, though\r\nhe protested against the methods employed to enforce it. When Lord\r\nBalmerino was put on his trial on the capital charge of retaining in his\r\npossession a petition regarded as a libel on the king's government,\r\nDrummond in an energetic \"Letter\" (1635) urged the injustice and folly\r\nof the proceedings. About this time a claim by the earl of Menteith to\r\nthe earldom of Strathearn, which was based on the assertion that Robert\r\nIII., husband of Annabella Drummond, was illegitimate, roused the poet's\r\npride of blood and prompted him to prepare an historical defence of his\r\nhouse. Partly to please his kinsman the earl of Perth, and partly to\r\nsatisfy his own curiosity, the poet made researches in the genealogy of\r\nthe family. This investigation was the real secret of Drummond's\r\ninterest in Scottish history; and so we find that he now began his\r\n_History of Scotland during the Reigns of the Five Jameses_, a work\r\nwhich did not appear till 1655, and is remarkable only for its good\r\nliterary style. His next work was called forth by the king's enforced\r\nsubmission to the opposition of his Scottish subjects. It is entitled\r\n_Irene: or a Remonstrance for Concord, Amity, and Love amongst His\r\nMajesty's Subjects_ (1638), and embodies Drummond's political creed of\r\nsubmission to authority as the only logical refuge from democracy, which\r\nhe hated. In 1639 Drummond had to sign the Covenant in self-protection,\r\nbut was uneasy under the burden, as several political squibs by him\r\ntestify. In 1643 he published [Greek: Skiamachia]: _or a Defence of a\r\nPetition tendered to the Lords of the Council of Scotland by certain\r\nNoblemen and Gentlemen_, a political pamphlet in support of those\r\nroyalists in Scotland who wished to espouse the king's cause against the\r\nEnglish parliament. Its burden is an invective on the intolerance of the\r\nthen dominant Presbyterian clergy.\r\n\r\nHis later works may be described briefly as royalist pamphlets, written\r\nwith more or less caution, as the times required. Drummond took the part\r\nof Montrose; and a letter from the Royalist leader in 1646 acknowledged\r\nhis services. He also wrote a pamphlet, \"A Vindication of the\r\nHamiltons,\" supporting the claims of the duke of Hamilton to lead the\r\nScottish army which was to release Charles I. It is said that Drummond's\r\nhealth received a severe shock when news was brought of the king's\r\nexecution. He died on the 4th of December 1649. He was buried in his\r\nparish church of Lasswade.\r\n\r\nDrummond's most important works are the _Cypresse Grove_ and the poems.\r\nThe _Cypresse Grove_ exhibits great wealth of illustration, and an\r\nextraordinary command of musical English. It is an essay on the folly of\r\nthe fear of death. \"This globe of the earth,\" says he, \"which seemeth\r\nhuge to us, in respect of the universe, and compared with that wide\r\npavilion of heaven, is less than little, of no sensible quantity, and\r\nbut as a point.\" This is one of Drummond's favourite moods; and he uses\r\nconstantly in his poems such phrases as \"the All,\" \"this great All.\"\r\nEven in such of his poems as may be called more distinctively Christian,\r\nthis philosophic conception is at work.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy feature in Drummond's poetry, as in that of his courtier\r\ncontemporaries Ayton (q.v.), Lord Stirling and others, is that it\r\nmanifests no characteristic Scottish element, but owes its birth and\r\ninspiration rather to the English and Italian masters. Drummond was\r\nessentially a follower of Spenser, but, amid all his sensuousness, and\r\neven in those lines most conspicuously beautiful, there is a dash of\r\nmelancholy thoughtfulness--a tendency deepened by the death of his first\r\nlove, Mary Cunningham. Drummond was called \"the Scottish Petrarch\"; and\r\nhis sonnets, which are the expression of a genuine passion, stand far\r\nabove most of the contemporary Petrarcan imitations. A remarkable\r\nburlesque poem _Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam_ (printed\r\nanonymously in 1684) has been persistently, and with good reason,\r\nascribed to him. It is a mock-heroic tale, in dog-Latin, of a country\r\nfeud on the Fifeshire lands of his old friends the Cunninghams.\r\n\r\n  Drummond's _Poems_, with _Cypresse Grove_, the _History_, and a few of\r\n  the minor tracts, were collected in 1656 and edited by Edward\r\n  Phillips, Milton's nephew. _The Works of William Drummond, of\r\n  Hawthornden_ (1711), edited by Bishop Sage and Thomas Ruddiman,\r\n  contains a life by the former, and some of the poet's letters. A\r\n  handsome edition of the _Poems_ was printed by the Maitland Club in\r\n  1832. Later editions are by Peter Cunningham (1833), by William R.\r\n  Turnbull in \"The Library of Old Authors\" (1856), and by W. C. Ward\r\n  (1894) for \"The Muses' Library.\" The standard biography of Drummond is\r\n  by David Masson (1873). Extracts from the Hawthornden MSS. preserved\r\n  in the Library of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland were printed\r\n  by David Laing in _Archaeologia Scotica_, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUNKENNESS, a term signifying generally a state resulting from\r\nexcessive drinking, and usually associated with alcoholic intoxication,\r\nor alcohol poisoning. It may represent either an _act_ or a _habit_, the\r\nlatter consisting in frequent repetitions of the former. As an act it\r\nmay be an accident, most usually arising from the incautious use of one\r\nor other of the commonly employed intoxicating agents; as a habit (as in\r\nthe form of chronic alcoholism) it is one of the most degrading forms of\r\nvice which can result from the enfeeblement of the moral principle by\r\npersistent self-indulgence.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to be \"intoxication\" may arise from many different causes\r\n(e.g. epilepsy, fractured skull, intracranial haemorrhage, and the\r\ntoxaemic coma of diabetes and uraemia), and the close resemblance\r\nbetween the pathological and the toxic phenomena has been the cause of\r\nmany untoward accidents. Cold alone may produce such peculiar effects\r\nthat Captain Parry said in his _Journal_, \"I cannot help thinking that\r\nmany a man may have been punished for intoxication who was only\r\nsuffering from the benumbing effects of frost; for I have more than once\r\nseen our people in a state so exactly resembling that of the most\r\nstupid intoxication, that I should certainly have charged them with the\r\noffence had I not been quite sure that no possible means were afforded\r\nthem on Melville Island to procure anything stronger than snow water.\"\r\nThe same confusion is frequently found in cases which come before the\r\npolice-courts, people being arrested as \"drunk and disorderly\" who can\r\nprove that the symptoms were not due to over-indulgence in drink at all.\r\nSome individuals have, moreover, a special idiosyncrasy or\r\nsusceptibility to alcohol, due to heredity or to one of the sequelae of\r\nsunstroke or cranial injury. The children of drunkards are usually very\r\nsusceptible to the poison, becoming intoxicated by a far smaller\r\nquantity than is needed by a normal person.\r\n\r\nBut, as a rule, the phenomena of drunkenness are actually due to\r\nexcessive consumption of some intoxicating liquid. The physiological\r\naction of all such agents may be described as a cumulative production of\r\nparalysis of various parts of the nervous system, but this effect\r\nresults only in doses of a certain amount--a dose which varies with the\r\nagent, the race and the individual. Even the cup so often said to\r\n\"cheer, but not inebriate,\" cannot be regarded as altogether free from\r\nthe last-named effect. Tea-sots are well known to be affected with\r\npalpitation and irregularity of the heart, as well as with more or less\r\nsleeplessness, mental irritability and muscular tremors, which in some\r\nculminate in paralysis; while positive intoxication has been known to be\r\nthe result of the excessive use of strong tea. In short, from tea to\r\nhaschisch we have, through hops, alcohol, tobacco and opium, a sort of\r\ngraduated scale of intoxicants, which stimulate in small doses and\r\nnarcotize in larger,--the narcotic dose having no stimulating properties\r\nwhatever, and only appearing to possess them from the fact that the\r\nagent can only be gradually taken up by the blood, and the system thus\r\ncomes primarily under the influence of a stimulant dose. In certain\r\ncircumstances and with certain agents--as in the production of\r\nchloroform narcosis--this precursory stage is capable of being much\r\nabbreviated, if not altogether annihilated; while with other agents--as\r\ntea--the narcotic stage is by no means always or readily produced.\r\n\r\nNo subject in modern times has led to more extreme opinions than this of\r\nindulgence in \"intoxicants\" to any degree whatever. It is well to\r\nremember that (in spite of apparently authoritative modern views to the\r\ncontrary) there is not a shadow of proof that the moderate use of any\r\none of these agents as a stimulant has any definite tendency to lead to\r\nits abuse; it is otherwise with their employment as narcotics, which,\r\nonce indulged in, is almost certain to lead to repetition, and to a more\r\nor less rapid process of degradation, though there are many exceptions\r\nto this latter statement. It is interesting to know that a former\r\nEnglish judge, who lived to nearly ninety years of age, believed he had\r\nprolonged his life and added greatly to his comfort by the moderate use\r\nof ether, which he was led to employ because neither wine nor tobacco\r\nagreed with him; while the immoderate use of the same agent has given\r\nrise to a most deleterious form of drunkenness, both in parts of Ireland\r\nand in some of the large industrial centres in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nVarious modern biologists have discussed, with more or less acceptance\r\nin certain circles, the historical conditions in various races and in\r\ndifferent countries as to the use and abuse of intoxicants, and have\r\ndrawn varying conclusions from their theories. It has even been\r\ncontended, with much show of learned authority, that since drunkenness\r\nleads to disease and early death, the proneness to strong drink in the\r\nlong run causes the elimination of the unfit, and results in a general\r\nsobering of the community, a race being therefore temperate in\r\nproportion to its past sufferings through alcohol. But on this subject\r\nit may be said that, at least, no agreement has been reached.\r\n\r\nThe effects of intoxicants are variously modified by the temperament of\r\nthe individual and the nature of the inebriant. When that is alcohol,\r\nits action on an average individual is first to fill him with a serene\r\nand perfect self-complacency. His feelings and faculties are exalted\r\ninto a state of great activity and buoyancy, so that his language\r\nbecomes enthusiastic, and his conversation vivacious if not brilliant.\r\nThe senses gradually become hazy, a soft humming seems to fill the\r\npauses of the conversation, and modify the tones of the speaker, a filmy\r\nhaze obscures the vision, the head seems lighter than usual, the\r\nequilibrium unstable. By-and-by objects appear double, or flit\r\nconfusedly before the eyes; judgment is abolished, secretiveness\r\nannihilated, and the drunkard pours forth all that is within him with\r\nunrestrained communicativeness; he becomes boisterous, ridiculous, and\r\nsinks at length into a mere animal. Every one around him, the very\r\nhouses, trees, even the earth itself, seem drunken and unstable, he\r\nalone sober, till at last the final stage is reached, and he falls on\r\nthe ground insensible--_dead drunk_ (alcoholic coma)--a state from\r\nwhich, after profound slumber, he at last awakes feverish, exhausted,\r\nsick and giddy, with ringing ears, a throbbing heart and a violent\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\nThe poison primarily affects the cerebral lobes, and the other parts of\r\nthe cerebro-spinal system are consecutively involved, till in the state\r\nof _dead-drunkenness_ the only parts not invaded by a benumbing\r\nparalysis are those automatic centres in the medulla oblongata which\r\nregulate and maintain the circulation and respiration. But even these\r\ncentres are not unaffected; the paralysis of these as of the other\r\nsections of the cerebro-spinal system varies in its incompleteness, and\r\nat times becomes complete, the coma of drunkenness terminating in death.\r\nMore usually the intoxicant is gradually eliminated, and the individual\r\nrestored to consciousness, a consciousness disturbed by the secondary\r\nresults of the agent he has abused, which vary with the nature of that\r\nagent. Whether, however, directly or indirectly through the nervous\r\nsystem, the stomach suffers in every case; thus nutrition is interfered\r\nwith by the defective ingestion of food, as well as by the\r\nmal-assimilation of that which is ingested; and from this cause, as well\r\nas by the peculiar local action of the various poisons, the various\r\norganic degenerations are induced (cirrhosis of the liver, &c.) which in\r\nmost cases shorten the drunkard's days.\r\n\r\nThe primary discomforts of an act of drunkenness are readily removed for\r\nthe time by a repetition of the cause. Thus what has been an act may\r\nreadily become a habit, all the more readily that each repetition more\r\nand more enfeebles both the will and the judgment, till they become\r\nutterly unfit to resist the temptation to indulgence supplied by the\r\nknowledge of the temporary relief to suffering which is sure to follow,\r\nand in spite of the consciousness that each repetition of the act only\r\nforges their chains more tightly. From this condition there is no hope\r\nof relief but in enforced abstinence; any one in this condition must be\r\nregarded as temporarily insane (see INSANITY and NEUROPATHOLOGY), and\r\nought to be placed in an inebriate asylum till he regain sufficient\r\nself-control to enable him to overcome his love for drink. Numerous\r\n\"cures\" have been started in recent years, which have often succeeded in\r\nindividual cases. An anti-alcoholic serum obtained from alcoholized\r\nhorses has been advocated by Dr Sapelier.\r\n\r\nFor the law concerning drunkenness the reader is referred to INEBRIETY,\r\nLAW OF. Its prevalence as a vice has varied considerably according to\r\nthe state of education or comfort in different classes of society. In\r\nconsidering the extent to which intemperance has prevailed, the\r\nstatistics of prosecutions upon which such comparisons are usually based\r\nare far from being completely satisfactory, but, inasmuch as they\r\nconstitute the only possible data for such comparisons, we are compelled\r\nto accept them. The following table gives the average number of persons\r\nper 1000 of the population proceeded against for drunkenness in England\r\nand Wales for quinquennial periods, dating from 1857, the first year of\r\nthe Judicial Statistics:--\r\n\r\n  1857-1861             4.28\r\n  1862-1866             4.78\r\n  1867-1871             5.47\r\n  1872-1876             7.83\r\n  1877-1881             7.25\r\n  1882-1886             6.90\r\n  1887-1891             6.19\r\n  1892-1896             5.84\r\n  1897-1901             6.42\r\n  1902-1906             6.51\r\n\r\nThe figures, it will be seen, show a steady decline from 1872-1876 (when\r\nthe consumption of alcohol was quite abnormal) to 1892-1896. After that\r\nyear, however, the figures again rose. The increase was especially\r\nmarked in 1899, when a tide of exceptional prosperity was again\r\naccompanied by great drunkenness. It is also disquieting to discover\r\nthat the average number of prosecutions for drunkenness in the three\r\nyears 1897-1899 was 51% higher than the average for 1857-1861, and 35%\r\nhigher than the average for 1862-1866. That the increase was partly due\r\nto more efficient police administration is probable, but that this is\r\nnot a complete explanation of the figures is made evident by an analysis\r\nof the general statistics of crime during the same period, from which it\r\nmay be seen that, while crime generally (excluding drunkenness)\r\ndecreased 28% in England and Wales since 1857-1861, drunkenness\r\nincreased 51%. Speaking generally, it may be said that in the United\r\nKingdom drunkenness appears chiefly prevalent in the seaport and mining\r\ndistricts. If a line be drawn from the mouth of the Severn to the Wash,\r\nit will be found that the \"black\" counties, without exception, lie to\r\nthe north-west of this line. The worst counties in England and Wales in\r\nthe matter of drunkenness are Northumberland, Durham and Glamorganshire,\r\nwhile Pembrokeshire and Lancashire follow close behind. The most sober\r\ncounties, on the other hand, are Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Oxfordshire\r\nand Wiltshire. Averages based upon the returns of entire counties do\r\nnot, however, afford a complete guide to the distribution of\r\ndrunkenness, inasmuch as offences are not equally distributed over the\r\nwhole area of a county. A heavy ratio of drunkenness in a small district\r\nmay often give a county an unfavourable position in the general\r\naverages, notwithstanding favourable conditions in the rest of its area.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the prosecutions for drunkenness shows that about 24% of the\r\ntotal number of offences are committed by women. In the larger towns the\r\nproportion, as a rule, is higher. In London, 38% of the drunkenness is\r\nattributable to women; in Manchester, 36%; in Belfast and Glasgow, 32%.\r\nIn Liverpool, on the other hand, the proportion is only 24%. The\r\nmuch-controverted question as to whether intemperance is increasing\r\namong women can hardly, however, be decided by an appeal to the criminal\r\nstatistics. So far as these statistics throw any light at all upon the\r\nquestion, they suggest important local differences. A more direct clue\r\nis afforded by the registrar-general's annual returns of deaths directly\r\nattributed to intemperance. The figures are given below. In order to\r\neliminate accidental variations, the comparison is based upon the\r\naverage mortality during consecutive periods:--\r\n\r\n  +---------------+----------------------+----------+----------+\r\n  |     Years.    | Average No. of deaths|   Males  | Females  |\r\n  |               | (England and Wales). | per cent.| per cent.|\r\n  +---------------+----------------------+----------+----------+\r\n  |   1877-1881   |         1071         |    69    |    31    |\r\n  |   1882-1886   |         1320         |    66    |    34    |\r\n  |   1887-1891   |         1710         |    64    |    36    |\r\n  |   1892-1896   |         2044         |    61    |    39    |\r\n  |   1897-1899   |         2577         |    61    |    39    |\r\n  |   1899        |         2871         |    60    |    40    |\r\n  +---------------+----------------------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nFor the ten years ending 1904, out of 26,426 deaths from alcoholism,\r\n59.34% were males and 40.66% females.\r\n\r\nThe figures are certainly striking. They show, it will be noticed, that\r\nout of every 100 deaths from alcoholic excess in England and Wales women\r\ncontributed nine more at the end of the century then they did in 1880.\r\nIf, instead of taking the total number of deaths, we take the ratio per\r\nmillion persons living, the increase is seen even more clearly:--\r\n\r\n  +------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |     Years.       |   Males per    | Females per    |\r\n  |                  | million living.| million living.|\r\n  +------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |    1877-1881     |        60      |       25       |\r\n  |    1882-1886     |        67      |       32       |\r\n  |    1887-1891     |        79      |       42       |\r\n  |    1892-1896     |        86      |       51       |\r\n  |    1897-1899     |       103      |       63       |\r\n  |    1899          |       112      |       70       |\r\n  +------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that, while the ratio of mortality from alcoholic excess\r\nincreased 87% among males during the last two decades of the century,\r\namong females it increased by no less than 180%.\r\n\r\nSee also LIQUOR LAWS and TEMPERANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRURY, SIR WILLIAM (1527-1579), English statesman and soldier, was a son\r\nof Sir Robert Drury of Hedgerley in Buckinghamshire, and grandson of\r\nanother Sir Robert Drury (d. 1536), who was speaker of the House of\r\nCommons in 1495. He was born at Hawstead in Suffolk on the 2nd of\r\nOctober 1527, and was educated at Gonville Hall, Cambridge. Fighting in\r\nFrance, Drury was taken prisoner in 1544; then after his release he\r\nhelped Lord Russell, afterwards earl of Bedford, to quell a rising in\r\nDevonshire in 1549, but he did not come to the front until the reign of\r\nElizabeth. In 1559 he was sent to Edinburgh to report on the condition\r\nof Scottish politics, and five years later he became marshal and\r\ndeputy-governor of Berwick. Again in Scotland in January 1570, it is\r\ninteresting to note that the regent James Stewart, earl of Murray, was\r\nproceeding to keep an appointment with Drury in Linlithgow when he was\r\nmortally wounded, and it was probably intended to murder the English\r\nenvoy also. After this event Drury led two raids into Scotland; at least\r\nthrice he went to that country on more peaceable errands, during which,\r\nhowever, his life was continually in danger from assassins; and he\r\ncommanded the force which compelled Edinburgh Castle to surrender in May\r\n1573. In 1576 he was sent to Ireland as president of Munster, where his\r\nstern rule was very successful, and in 1578 he became lord justice to\r\nthe Irish council, taking the chief control of affairs after the\r\ndeparture of Sir Henry Sidney. The rising of the earl of Desmond had\r\njust broken out when Sir William died in October 1579.\r\n\r\n  Drury's letters to Lord Burghley and others are invaluable for the\r\n  story of the relations between England and Scotland at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUSES, or DRUZES (Arab. _Druz_), a people of mid-Syria (for the\r\nderivation of the name see HISTORY section below), distributed nowadays\r\ninto three isolated groups, of which the most numerous inhabits Jebel\r\nHauran (Jebel Druz), E. of Jordan (about 55,000); the second, the\r\n_cazas_ of Shuf and Metn in Lebanon (about 50,000); the third, the\r\n_cazas_ of Hasbeya, Rasheya, W. al Ajem, Homs, Hamadiyeh and Selimiyeh\r\nin Anti-Lebanon and Hermon (about 45,000). The first group, which has\r\nbeen greatly increased by migrants from the second, since the\r\nestablishment of the privileged Lebanon province (1861) under Christian\r\nauspices, lives apart from other peoples in semi-independence. The\r\nsecond is now confined to the southern Lebanon, and even there is\r\ngreatly outnumbered by Maronites, who, in the whole \"Mountain,\" stand to\r\nDruses as 9 to 2. The third is counterbalanced everywhere by a large\r\npopulation of Moslem and Orthodox Syrians. The Hauran, therefore, has\r\nbecome the stronghold of the Druses, offering nowadays the best field\r\nfor studying their peculiar customs and religion; and the group there\r\nstill increases at the expense of the other groups, despite efforts on\r\nthe part of the Ottoman government to check Druse migration by both\r\nconciliatory and repressive measures. The actual distinction of the\r\nDruses, as a racial unity, despite their dispersion, depends so\r\nexclusively on the peculiarity of their common religion, that it will be\r\nwell at once to give an account of Druse creed and practice as they are\r\nunderstood to stand at the present day. How this religion may have grown\r\nup and come to be theirs will be considered later.\r\n\r\n_Religion._--Druse religion is a secret faith, and the following account\r\nis given with all reserves. There are many indications that a more\r\nprimitive cult, containing elements of Nature worship, preceded it, and\r\nstill survives in the popular practices of the more remote Druse\r\ndistricts, e.g. in the eastern Hauran. The _Muwahhidin_ (Unitarians), as\r\nthe Druses call themselves, believe that there is one and only one God,\r\nindefinable, incomprehensible, ineffable, passionless. He has made\r\nhimself known to men by successive incarnations, of which the last was\r\nHakim, the sixth Fatimite caliph. How many these incarnations have been\r\nis stated variously; but seventy, one for each period of the world,\r\nseems the best-attested number. Jesus appears to be accepted as one\r\nsuch incarnation, but not Mahomet, although it is agreed that, in his\r\ntime, the \"Universal Intelligence\" (see later) was made flesh, in the\r\nperson of Mikdad al-Aswad. No further incarnation can now take place: in\r\nHakim a final appeal was made to mankind, and after the door of mercy\r\nhad stood open to all for twenty-six years, it was finally and for ever\r\nclosed. When the tribulation of the faithful has reached its height,\r\nHakim will reappear to conquer the world and render his religion\r\nsupreme. Druses, believed to be dispersed in China, will return to\r\nSyria. The combined body of the Faithful will take Mecca, and finally\r\nJerusalem, and all the world will accept the Faith. The first of the\r\ncreatures of God is the Universal Intelligence or Spirit, impersonated\r\nin Hamza, Hakim's vizier. This Spirit was the creator of all subordinate\r\nbeings, and alone has immediate communion with the Deity. Next in rank,\r\nand equally supporting the throne of the Almighty, are four Ministering\r\nSpirits, the Soul, the Word, the Right Wing and the Left Wing, who, in\r\nHakim's time, were embodied respectively in Ismael Darazi, Mahommed ibn\r\nWahab, Selama ibn Abd al-Wahal and Baha ud-Din; and beneath these again\r\nare spiritual agents of various ranks. The material world is an\r\nemanation from, and a \"mirror\" of, the Divine Intelligence. The number\r\nof human beings admits neither of increase nor of decrease, and a\r\nregular process of metempsychosis goes on continually. The souls of the\r\nvirtuous pass after death into ever new incarnations of greater\r\nperfection, till at last they reach a point at which they can be\r\nre-absorbed into the Deity itself; those of the wicked may be degraded\r\nto the level of camels or dogs. All previous religions are mere types of\r\nthe true, and their sacred books and observances are to be interpreted\r\nallegorically. The Gospel and the Koran are both regarded as inspired\r\nbooks, but not as religious guides. The latter function is performed\r\nsolely by the Druse Scriptures. As the admission of converts is no\r\nlonger permitted, the faithful are enjoined to keep their doctrine\r\nsecret from the profane; and in order that their allegiance may not\r\nbring them into danger, they are allowed (like Persian mystics) to make\r\noutward profession of whatever religion is dominant around them. To this\r\nlatter indulgence is to be attributed the apparent indifferentism which\r\nleads to their joining Moslems in prayers and ablutions, or sprinkling\r\nthemselves with holy water in Maronite churches. Obedience is required\r\nto the seven commandments of Hamza, the first and greatest of which\r\nenjoins truth in words (but only those of Druse speaking with Druse);\r\nthe second, watchfulness over the safety of the brethren; the third,\r\nabsolute renunciation of every other religion; the fourth, complete\r\nseparation from all who are in error; the fifth, recognition of the\r\nunity of \"Our Lord\" in all ages; the sixth, complete resignation to his\r\nwill; and the seventh, complete obedience to his orders. Prayer,\r\nhowever, is regarded as an impertinent interference with the Creator;\r\nwhile, at the same time, instead of the fatalistic predestination of\r\nMahommedanism, the freedom of the human will is distinctly maintained.\r\nNot only is the charge of secrecy rigidly obeyed in regard to the alien\r\nworld, but full initiation into the deeper mysteries of the creed is\r\npermitted only to a special class designated _Akils_, (Arabic _'Akl_,\r\nintelligence), in contradistinction from whom all other members of the\r\nDruse community, whatever may be their position or attainments, are\r\ncalled _Jahel_, the Ignorant. About 15% of the adult population belong\r\nto the order of Akils. Admission is granted to any Druse of either sex\r\nwho expresses willingness to conform to the laws of the society, and\r\nduring a year of probation gives sufficient proof of sincerity and\r\nstability of purpose. There appears to be no formal distinction of rank\r\namong the various members; and though the amir, Beshir Shehab, used to\r\nappoint a sheikh of the Akils, the person thus distinguished obtained no\r\nprimacy over his fellows. Exceptional influence depends upon exceptional\r\nsanctity or ability. All are required to abstain from tobacco and wine;\r\nthe women used not to be allowed to wear gold or silver, or silk or\r\nbrocade, but this rule is commonly broken now; and although neither\r\ncelibacy nor retirement from the affairs of the world is either\r\nimperative or customary, unusual respect is shown to those who\r\nvoluntarily submit themselves to ascetic discipline. While the Akils\r\nmingle frankly with the common people, and are remarkably free from\r\nclerical pretension, they are none the less careful to maintain their\r\nprivileges. They are distinguished by the wearing of a white turban,\r\nemblematic of the purity of their life. Their food must be purchased\r\nwith money lawfully acquired; and lest they should unwittingly partake\r\nof any that is ceremonially unclean, they require those Jahels, whose\r\nhospitality they share, to supply their wants from a store set apart for\r\ntheir exclusive use. The ideal Akil is grave, calm and dignified, with\r\nan infinite capacity of keeping a secret, and a devotion that knows no\r\nlimits to the interests of his creed. On Thursday evening, the\r\ncommencement of the weekly day of rest, the members of the order meet\r\ntogether in the various districts, probably for the reading of their\r\nsacred books and consultation on matters of ecclesiastical or political\r\nimportance. Their meeting-houses, _khalwas_, are plain, unornamented\r\nedifices. These have property attached to them, the revenues of which\r\nare consecrated to the relief of the poor and the demands of\r\nhospitality. In the eastern Hauran, there are hill-top shrines\r\ncontaining each a black stone, on which rugs, &c., are hung, and these\r\nseem to perpetuate features of pre-Islamic Arabian cult, including the\r\nsacrifice of animals, e.g. goats. They are held in reverence by the\r\nBedouins. The women assemble in the _khalwas_ at the same time as the\r\nmen, a part of the space being fenced off for them by a semi-transparent\r\nblack veil. Even while the Akils are assembled, strangers are readily\r\nenough admitted to the _khalwas_; but as long as these are present the\r\nordinary ceremonies are neglected, and the Koran takes the place of the\r\nDruse Scriptures. It has been frequently asserted that the image of a\r\ncalf is kept in a niche, and traces of phallic and gynaecocratic worship\r\nhave been vaguely suspected; but there is no authentic information in\r\nsupport of either statement. The calf, if calf there be, is probably a\r\nsymbol of the execrable heresy of Darazi, who is frequently styled the\r\ncalf by his Orthodox opponents. Ignorance is the mother of suspicion as\r\nwell as of superstition; and accordingly the Christian inhabitants of\r\nthe Lebanon have long been persuaded that the Druses in their secret\r\nassemblies are guilty of the most nefarious practices. For this\r\nallegation, so frequently repeated by European writers, there seems to\r\nbe little evidence; and it is certain that the sacred books of the\r\nreligion contain moral teaching of a high order on the whole.\r\n\r\nAs a formulated creed, the Druse system is not a thousand years old. In\r\nthe year A.D. 996 (386 A.H.) Hakim Biamrillahi (i.e. he who judges by\r\nthe command of God), sixth of the Fatimite caliphs (third in Egypt),\r\nbegan to reign; and during the next twenty-five years he indulged in a\r\ntyranny at once so terrible and so fantastic that little doubt can be\r\nentertained of his insanity. He believed that he held direct intercourse\r\nwith the deity, or even that he was an incarnation of the divine\r\nintelligence; and in A.D. 1016 (407 A.H.) his claims were made known in\r\nthe mosque at Cairo, and supported by the testimony of Ismael Darazi.\r\nThe people showed such bitter hostility to the new gospel that Darazi\r\nwas compelled to seek safety in flight; but even in absence he was\r\nfaithful to his god, and succeeded in winning over certain ignorant\r\ninhabitants of Lebanon. According to the Druses, this great conversion\r\ntook place in A.D. 1019 (410 A.H.). Meanwhile the endeavours of the\r\ncaliph to get his divinity acknowledged by the people of Cairo\r\ncontinued. The advocacy of Hasan ibn Haidara Fergani was without avail;\r\nbut in 1017 (408 A.H.) the new religion found a more successful apostle\r\nin the person of Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmed, a Persian mystic, felt-maker\r\nby trade, who became Hakim's vizier, gave form and substance to his\r\ncreed, and by an ingenious adaptation of its various dogmas to the\r\nprejudices of existing sects, finally enlisted an extensive body of\r\nadherents. In 1020 (411 A.H.) the caliph was assassinated by contrivance\r\nof his sister Sitt ul-Mulk; but it was given out by Hamza that he had\r\nonly withdrawn for a season, and his followers were encouraged to look\r\nforward with confidence to his triumphant return. Darazi, who had acted\r\nindependently in his apostolate, was branded by Hamza as a heretic, and\r\nthus, by a curious anomaly, he is actually held in detestation by the\r\nvery sect which perhaps bears his name. The propagation of the faith in\r\naccordance with Hamza's initiation was undertaken by Ismael ibn Mahommed\r\nTamimi, Mahommed ibn Wahab, Abul-Khair Selama ibn Abd al-Wahal ibn\r\nSamurri, and Moktana Baha ud-Din, the last of whom became known by his\r\nwritings from Constantinople to the borders of India. In two letters\r\naddressed to the emperors Constantine VIII. and Michael the Paphlagonian\r\nhe endeavoured to prove that the Christian Messiah reappeared in the\r\nperson of Hamza.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, even probable, that the segregation of the Druses as a\r\npeople dates only from the adoption of Hamza's creed. But when it is\r\nrecalled that other inhabitants of the same mountain system, e.g. the\r\nMaronites, the Ansarieh, the Metawali and the \"Isma'ilites,\" also\r\nprofess creeds which, like the Druse system, differ from Sunni Islam in\r\nthe important feature of admitting incarnations of the Deity, it is\r\nimpossible not to suspect that Hamza's emissaries only gave definition\r\nand form to beliefs long established in this part of the world. Many of\r\nthe fundamental ideas of Druse theology belong to a common West Asiatic\r\nstock; but the peculiar history of the Mountain is no doubt responsible\r\nfor beliefs, held elsewhere by different peoples, being combined there\r\nin a single creed. Some allowance, too, must be made for the probability\r\nthat Hamza's system owed something to doctrines Christian and other,\r\nwith which the metropolitan position of Cairo brought Fatimite society\r\ninto contact.\r\n\r\n_History_--There is good reason to regard the Druses as, racially, a\r\nmixture of refugee stocks, in which the Arab largely predominates,\r\ngrafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic blood and\r\nIncarnationist tendencies. The latter is represented more purely by the\r\nMaronites (q.v.). The native tradition regards an immigration of Hira\r\nArabs into S. Lebanon, under Khalid ibn Walid in the 9th century, as the\r\nbeginning of Druse distinctiveness and power; but it also accepts\r\nTurkoman and Kurdish elements in the original Druse state. About the\r\nsame time, or a little later (in the reign of Saladin), it believes that\r\nHermon was colonized by a population of 15,000 Hira and Yemenite Arabs,\r\nwho had sojourned awhile in Hauran. The name Druse is met with first in\r\nBenjamin of Tudela (c. A.D. 1170), and its origin has been much\r\ndisputed. Some authorities see in it a descriptive epithet, derived from\r\nArabic _darasa_ (those who _read_ the Book), or _darisa_ (those in\r\n_possession_ of Truth) or _durs_ (the _clever_ or _initiated_); but more\r\nconnect it with the name of the first missionary, Ismael _Darazi_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we begin to know anything of the Druses they were living in a\r\nfeudal state of society, as village communities under _sheikhs_,\r\nthemselves generally subordinate to one or more amirs. In the time of\r\nthe first crusades the main power was in the hands of the Arslan family,\r\nwhich, however, suffered so severely in wars with the Franks, that it\r\nwas superseded by the Tnuhs, who, holding Beirut and nearly all the\r\nPhoenician coast, came into conflict with the sultans of Egypt. One of\r\nthese latter, Malik Ashraf, about A.D. 1300, forced outward compliance\r\nwith Sunni Islam on the Mountain, after defeating the Druses at Ain\r\nSofar. Meanwhile, however, the _Maan_ family, lately immigrant from N.\r\nArabia, was growing in power, and throwing in its lot with the Osmanli\r\ninvaders in the reign of Selim I., it was promoted to the supreme\r\namirate about 1517. Fakr ud-Din Maan II. increased Druse dominion until\r\nit included all the N. Syrian region from the edge of the Antioch plain\r\nto Acre, with part of the eastern desert, dominated by his castle at\r\nTadmor (Palmyra), and the important towns of Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut\r\nand Saida; and forming further ambitious designs, he intrigued with\r\nChristians and broke with the Turks. In 1614 the pasha of Damascus moved\r\nagainst him with a large force, and compelled him to fly from Syria. He\r\nsought the courts of Tuscany and Naples and tried to enlist Frank\r\nsympathies, inventing (probably) the curious myth, so often credited\r\nsince, that the Druses are of crusading origin and owe their name to the\r\ncounts of Dreux.[1] He landed again at Saida in 1619 and recovered his\r\nold position. But in 1633 Kuchuk Ahmed Pasha was sent against him with a\r\nlarge army, and succeeded in capturing him with his sons. The family was\r\nsent to Constantinople, and two years later strangled. The dynasty\r\nstruggled on till the end of the century, amid civil war, in which the\r\nparties seem to have been divided by the earlier Arab factions of\r\nKaisites (Qaisites) and Yemenites, the Maan belonging to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Shehab family, originally Hira Arabs, which had governed Hauran\r\nunder the early caliphs of Damascus, and thereafter held power in\r\nHermon, intermarried with the Maan; and in the latter's day of weakness\r\nsided with the Kaisi faction and obtained the supreme amirate of the\r\nMountain. But it appears never to have professed the Druse creed,\r\nremaining Sunnite. Haidar Shehab, third of the line, inflicted a notable\r\ndefeat on the pasha of Saida (capital of an Ottoman eyalet since 1688)\r\nand the Yemenite Druses at Ain Dara, near Zahleh, in 1711, and proceeded\r\nto consolidate Shehab power, breaking up the old feudal society and\r\nsubstituting for the sheikhs _mukatajis_ (tax-contractors), who had\r\npenal jurisdiction. The Yemenite Druses thereupon emigrated in large\r\nnumbers to the Hauran, and laid the foundation of Druse power there. The\r\nTurks recognized the _status quo_, and made terms with the Shehab amir\r\nin 1748; but his power was none too well secured against the opposition\r\nof the Kurdish _Jumblat_ family, even though he was supported by the\r\n_Talhuk_, _Abd al-Malik_ and _Yezbeki_ families; and it appears that\r\nsome members of the Shehab joined the Maronite faith in the middle of\r\nthe 18th century, causing a suspicion of secret apostasy to fall on all\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the amir Beshir, who succeeded about 1786, was himself a\r\ncrypto-Christian. This remarkable man, who ruled the Mountain for\r\nfifty-four years, maintained his power by taking the side of one rebel\r\npasha after another, betraying each in turn, and cultivating relations\r\nwith European admirals. His earliest ally was Ahmed \"Jezzar,\" who\r\nestablished himself in Acre in contumacious independence late in the\r\n18th century. Beshir supported Jezzar against Napoleon in 1799 and\r\nearned the friendship of Sir Sidney Smith. Falling out with Jezzar,\r\nBeshir fled to Cairo in 1805, attached himself to Mehemet Ali, and\r\nreturned to take up the reins. Once more chased out by the Turks, he was\r\nagain in the Mountain in 1823, allied with Abdallah, on whom Jezzar's\r\nmantle had ultimately fallen at Acre, and maintaining friendly relations\r\nwith the \"English Princess,\" Lady Hester Stanhope. He now finally\r\nworsted the Jumblat. The invasion of Syria by Mehemet Ali in 1831 caused\r\nBeshir to desert Abdallah and throw in his lot with Ibrahim Pasha; but\r\nhe was not cordially followed by the Druses in general, and had good\r\nexcuse for revolt in 1839, and intrigue with the British admiral in\r\n1840. Ibrahim, however, by his possession of Druse hostages, restrained\r\nthe amir, and after the bombardment of Acre, the Turks called him to\r\naccount for his record of rebellion and treachery. He fled to Malta on a\r\nBritish ship, but was induced to go to Constantinople, where he died in\r\n1851.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Beshir al-Kassim, openly joined the Maronites, and\r\ninstigating these against the malcontents of his own people, brought\r\nenmities, which had been growing for a century, to a head, and initiated\r\na devastating internecine warfare which was to continue for twenty\r\nyears. The state of the Lebanon went from bad to worse, and at last, in\r\nJanuary 1842, the Turkish government appointed Omar Pasha as\r\nadministrator of the Druses and Maronites, with a council of four chiefs\r\nfrom each party; but the pasha, attempting to effect a disarming, was\r\nbesieged in November in the castle of Beit ed-Din by the Druses under\r\nShibli el-Arrian. At the instigation of the European powers he was\r\nrecalled in December, and the Druses and Maronites were placed under\r\nseparate _kaimakams_ (governors), who, it was stipulated, were not to be\r\nof the family of Shehab. Disturbances again broke out in 1845, the\r\nnative _mukatajis_ refusing to obey the _kaimakams_. The Maronites flew\r\nto arms, but with the assistance of the Turks their opponents carried\r\nthe day. A superficial pacification effected by Shekib Effendi, the\r\nOttoman commissioner, lasted only till his departure; and the Porte was\r\nobliged to despatch a force of 12,000 men to the Lebanon. Forty of the\r\nchiefs were seized, the people was nominally disarmed, and in 1846 a new\r\nconstitution was inaugurated, by which the _kaimakam_ was to be assisted\r\nby two Druses, two Maronites, four Greeks, two Turks and one Metawali.\r\nAll, however, was in vain: the conflict was continued through 1858, 1859\r\nand 1860; and the disturbance culminated in the famous Damascus massacre\r\n(see SYRIA). The European powers now determined to interfere; and, by a\r\nprotocol of the 3rd of May 1860, it was decided that the Lebanon should\r\nbe occupied by a force of 20,000 men, of whom half were to be French. A\r\nbody of troops was accordingly landed on the 16th of August under\r\nGeneral Beaufort d'Hautpoul; and Fuad Pasha, who had been appointed\r\nTurkish commissioner with full powers, proceeded to bring the leaders of\r\nthe massacres to justice. The French occupation continued till the 5th\r\nof June 1861, and the French and English squadrons cruised on the coast\r\nfor several months after. In accordance with the recommendation of the\r\nEuropean powers the Porte determined to appoint a Christian governor not\r\nbelonging to the district, and independent of the pasha of Beirut, to\r\nhold office for three years. The choice fell on Daud Pasha, an Armenian\r\nCatholic, who was installed on the 4th of July. In spite of many\r\ndifficulties, and especially the ambitious conduct of the Maronite\r\nJussuf Karam, he succeeded in restoring order; and by the formation of a\r\nmilitary force from the inhabitants of the Lebanon he rendered\r\nunnecessary the presence of the Turkish soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe privileged province of Lebanon (q.v.) was finally constituted by the\r\nOrganic Statute of the 6th of September 1864, and the subsequent history\r\nof the Lebanon Druses is one of gradual withdrawal from the jurisdiction\r\nof that state, in which they see their ancient independence\r\nirretrievably compromised, and their religion subordinated to Christian\r\nsupremacy. Many now emigrate, when occasion offers, to America.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Hauran, the old seat of the Shehab family and Hermon\r\nDruses, had been steadily receiving a Druse influx, since the day of Ain\r\nDara (see above). Towards the close of the 18th century some 600\r\nfamilies left Lebanon for the Hauran, in discontent with the rule of the\r\nShehab dynasty, and their place and property were taken by 1500 families\r\ndriven out of Jebel Ansarieh by Topal Ali in 1811. The Hauran Druses\r\nincreased by the middle of the 19th century to 7000 souls. They had\r\nsuccessfully resisted Ibrahim, the Egyptian, in 1839 in the Lija, and\r\nasserted complete independence of the Turks, living under a theocratic\r\ngovernment directed by the chief Akil in Suweda. A great effort, made by\r\nKibrisli Pasha in 1852 to subdue the Hauran, came to nothing. In 1879\r\nthe population numbered 20,000, and by a murderous raid attracted the\r\nattention of Midhat Pasha, then vali of the province of Syria. After\r\nexperiencing one disaster he defeated their forces and imposed a\r\n_kaimakam_, at first drawn from the Talhuks, but subsequently chosen\r\nfrom the Atrash family of Kunawat. But the Druses still refused to pay\r\ntaxes, to serve in the Ottoman army, or to recognize the _kaimakam_, and\r\nmaintained their contumacy under the lead of the Jumblat, till 1896;\r\nwhen, as the result of a military expedition under Tahir Pasha and a\r\ngreat defeat at Ijun, a compromise was arrived at, under which the\r\nDruses agreed to pay taxes, but to serve in their own territory only as\r\na frontier guard. The government was put into the hands of a mutessarif\r\nresident at Sheikh Saad, under whom are _kaimakams_ at Suweda and\r\nSalkhad. Since that epoch there has been comparative peace between the\r\nDruses and the government, largely because the latter, having learned\r\nwisdom, leaves the people very much to itself, maintaining only a small\r\ngarrison of regular troops, and enlisting Druse police for service in\r\nJebel Druz itself. The Druses are allowed to carry on their feuds with\r\nthe Bedouins of the E. Desert as they will, so long as they do not\r\ndisturb western districts. With the recent opening out of the W. Hauran\r\nby railway, the Druse sheikhs are beginning to acquire commercial\r\nambitions, and to desire peace.\r\n\r\nThe Hauran Druses are a vigorous, independent folk, with a well-deserved\r\nreputation for courage, very astute, and hospitable to Europeans,\r\nespecially the British, with whom they have an old tradition of\r\nfriendship. But, like most persecuted but semi-independent peoples, they\r\nare both cruel, and, by our standards, treacherous. They are a handsome\r\nrace, the women being often beautiful. The latter no longer carry the\r\nhead-horn which used to support the veil dropped over the face out of\r\ndoors. But their dress is still black with the exception of red\r\nslippers, and the veil is never abandoned, not even, it is said, during\r\nsleep. An English lady, who has been much among them, states that the\r\nDruse women of the Hauran never unveiled before her. The men wear a\r\n_tarbush_ with white roll, a black under-robe with white girdle, a short\r\nloose jacket, and when necessary an _aba_ or parti-coloured cloak over\r\nall. They go habitually armed with scimitar and half-moon axe, besides\r\ngun or rifle.\r\n\r\nPolygamy is forbidden. Marriage retains certain traces of the original\r\nsystem of capture; but Druse women enjoy much consideration, and are\r\ncomparatively well educated, dignified and free in their bearing in\r\nspite of their close veiling. As has been stated above, they join the\r\nmen in religious functions. Divorce is easy and can be initiated by the\r\nwoman; but remarriage of the pair can only be effected by the good\r\noffices of a proxy (as in Moslem societies, after a third divorce).\r\nBurial takes place in family mausoleums, walled up after each interment;\r\nbut Akils are buried in their own houses. The body is laid on its side,\r\nwith its face to the south (Mecca).\r\n\r\nEducation is widely spread, and there is a considerable religious\r\nliterature, much of which is known in Europe. A copy of the _Book of the\r\nTestimonies to the Mysteries of the Unity_, consisting of seventy\r\ntreatises in four folio volumes, was found in the house of the chief\r\nAkil at Bakhlin, and presented in 1700 to Louis XIV. by Nusralla ibn\r\nGilda, a Syrian doctor. Other manuscripts are to be found at Rome in the\r\nVatican, at Oxford in the Bodleian, at Vienna, at Leiden, at Upsala and\r\nat Munich; and Dr J. L. Porter got possession of seven standard works of\r\nDruse theology while at Damascus. The Munich collection was presented to\r\nthe king of Bavaria by Clot Bey, the chief physician in the Egyptian\r\narmy during its occupation of Syria; and for a number of the other\r\nmanuscripts we are indebted to the elder Niebuhr.

Being designed for the\r\nchurch, he studied Greek and Latin at Ghent, and philosophy at Louvain;\r\nbut his father having been outlawed for his religion, and deprived of\r\nhis estate, retired to England, where the son followed him in 1567. He\r\nfound an admirable teacher of Hebrew in Chevalier, the celebrated\r\nOrientalist, with whom he resided for some time at Cambridge. In 1572 he\r\nbecame professor of Oriental languages at Oxford. Upon the pacification\r\nof Ghent (1576) he returned with his father to their own country, and\r\nwas appointed professor of Oriental languages at Leiden in the following\r\nyear. In 1585 he removed to Friesland, and was admitted professor of\r\nHebrew in the university of Franeker, an office which he discharged with\r\ngreat honour till his death, which happened in February 1616. He\r\nacquired so extended a reputation as a professor that his class was\r\nfrequented by students from all the Protestant countries in Europe. His\r\nworks prove him to have been well skilled in Hebrew and in Jewish\r\nantiquities; and in 1600 the states-general employed him, at a salary of\r\n400 florins a year, to write notes on the most difficult passages in the\r\nOld Testament; but this work was not published until after his death. As\r\nthe friend of Arminius, he was charged by the orthodox and dominant\r\nparty with unfairness in the execution of the task, and the last sixteen\r\nyears of his life were therefore somewhat embittered by controversy. He\r\ncarried on an extensive correspondence with the learned in different\r\ncountries; for, besides letters in Hebrew, Greek and other languages,\r\nthere were found amongst his papers upwards of 2000 written in Latin. He\r\nhad a son, John, who died in England at the age of twenty-one, and was\r\naccounted a prodigy of learning. He had mastered Hebrew at the age of\r\nnine, and Scaliger said that he was a better Hebrew scholar than his\r\nfather. He wrote a large number of letters in Hebrew, besides notes on\r\nthe Proverbs of Solomon and other works.\r\n\r\n  Paquot states the number of the printed works and treatises of the\r\n  elder Drusius at forty-eight, and of the unprinted at upwards of\r\n  twenty. Of the former more than two-thirds were inserted in the\r\n  collection entitled _Critici sacri, sive annolata doctissimorum\r\n  virorum in Vetus et Novum Testamentum_ (Amsterdam, 1698, in 9 vols.\r\n  folio, or London, 1660, in 10 vols. folio). Amongst the works of\r\n  Drusius not to be found in this collection may be mentioned--(1)\r\n  _Alphabetum Hebraicum vetus_ (1584, 4to); (2) _Tabulae in grammaticam\r\n  Chaldaicam ad usum juventutis_ (1602, 8vo); (3) An edition of\r\n  Sulpicius Severus (Franeker, 1807, 12mo); (4) _Opuscula quae ad\r\n  grammaticam spectant omnia_ (1609, 4to); (5) _Lacrymae in obitum J.\r\n  Scaligeri_ (1609, 4to); and (6) _Grammatica linguae sanctae nova_\r\n  (1612, 4to).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUSUS, MARCUS LIVIUS, Roman statesman, was colleague of Gaius Gracchus\r\nin the tribuneship, 122 B.C. The proposal of Gracchus (q.v.) to confer\r\nthe full franchise on the Latins had been opposed not only by the\r\nsenate, but also by the mob, who imagined that their own privileges\r\nwould thereby be diminished. Drusus threatened to veto the proposal.\r\nEncouraged by this, the senatorial party put up Drusus to outbid\r\nGracchus. Gracchus had proposed to found colonies outside Italy; Drusus\r\nprovided twelve in Italy, to each of which 3000 citizens were to be\r\nsent. Gracchus had proposed to distribute allotments to the poorer\r\ncitizens subject to a state rent-charge; Drusus promised them free of\r\nall charge, and further that they should be inalienable. In addition to\r\nthe franchise, immunity from corporal punishment (even in the field) was\r\npromised the Latins. The absence of Gracchus, and the inefficiency of\r\nhis representative at Rome, led to the acceptance of these proposals,\r\nwhich were never intended to be carried. Drusus himself declined all\r\nresponsibility in connexion with carrying them out. He was rewarded for\r\nhis services by the consulship (112), and the title of _patronus\r\nsenatus_. He received Macedonia for his province, where he distinguished\r\nhimself in a campaign against the Scordisci, whom he drove across the\r\nDanube, being the first Roman general who reached that river. It is\r\npossible that he is the Drusus mentioned by Plutarch as having died in\r\n109, the year of his censorship.\r\n\r\n  Appian, _Bell. Civ._ i. 23; Plutarch, _Gaius Gracchus_, 8-11; Florus\r\n  iii. 4; A. H. J. Greenidge, _Hist. of Rome_, vol. i. (1904).\r\n\r\nHis son, MARCUS LIVIUS DRUSUS, became tribune of the people in 91 B.C.\r\nHe was a thoroughgoing conservative, wealthy and generous, and a man of\r\nhigh integrity. With some of the more intelligent members of his party\r\n(such as Marcus Scaurus and L. Licinius Crassus the orator) he\r\nrecognized the need of reform. At that time an agitation was going on\r\nfor the transfer of the judicial functions from the equites to the\r\nsenate; Drusus proposed as a compromise a measure which restored to the\r\nsenate the office of judices, while its numbers were doubled by the\r\nadmission of 300 equites. Further, a special commission was to be\r\nappointed to try and sentence all judices guilty of taking bribes. But\r\nthe senate was lukewarm, and the equites, whose occupation was\r\nthreatened, offered the most violent opposition. In order, therefore, to\r\ncatch the popular votes, Drusus proposed the establishment of colonies\r\nin Italy and Sicily, and an increased distribution of corn at a reduced\r\nrate. By help of these riders the bill was carried. Drusus now sought a\r\ncloser alliance with the Italians, promising them the long-coveted boon\r\nof the Roman franchise. The senate broke out into open opposition. His\r\nlaws were abrogated as informal, and each party armed its adherents for\r\nthe civil struggle which was now inevitable. Drusus was stabbed one\r\nevening as he was returning home. His assassin was never discovered.\r\n\r\n  See Rome: _History_, ii. \"The Republic\" (Period C); also Appian,\r\n  _Bell. Civ._ i. 35; Florus iii. 17; Diod. Sic. xxxvii. 10; Livy,\r\n  _Epit._ 70; Vell. Pat. ii. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUSUS, NERO[1] CLAUDIUS (38-9 B.C.) Roman general, son of Tiberius\r\nClaudius Nero and Livia Drusilla, stepson of Augustus and younger\r\nbrother of the emperor Tiberius. Having held the office of quaestor and\r\nacted as praetor for his brother during the latter's absence in Gaul, he\r\nbegan (in 15 B.C.) the military career which has made his name famous.\r\nIn conjunction with Tiberius, he carried on a successful campaign\r\nagainst the Raeti and Vindelici, who, although repulsed from Italy,\r\ncontinued to threaten the frontiers of Gaul. The credit of the decisive\r\nvictory, however, must be assigned to Tiberius. Two of the _Odes_ of\r\nHorace (iv. 4 and 14) were written to glorify the exploits of the\r\nbrothers. In 13 Drusus was sent as governor to the newly organized\r\nprovince of the three Gauls, where considerable discontent had been\r\naroused by the exactions of the Roman governor Licinius. Drusus made a\r\nfresh assessment for taxation purposes, and summoned the Gallic\r\nrepresentatives to a meeting at Lugdunum to discuss their grievances. It\r\nwas of great importance to pacify the Gauls, in order to have his hands\r\nfree to deal with the German tribes, one of which, the Sugambri, on the\r\nright bank of the Rhine, had seized the opportunity, during the absence\r\nof Augustus, to cross the river (12). Drusus drove them back and pursued\r\nthem through the island of the Batavi and the land of the Usipetes\r\n(Usipes, Usipii) to their own territory, which he devastated. Sailing\r\ndown the Rhine, he subdued the Frisii and, in order to facilitate\r\noperations against the Chauci, dug a canal (Fossa Drusiana) leading from\r\nthe Rhenus (Rhine) to the Isala (Yssel)[2] into the lacus Flevus\r\n(Zuidersee) and the German Ocean. Making his way along the Frisian\r\ncoast, he conquered the island of Burchanis (_Borkum_), defeated the\r\nBructeri in a naval engagement on the Amisia (_Ems_), and went on to the\r\nmouth of the Visurgis (_Weser_) to attack the Chauci. On the way back\r\nhis vessels grounded on the shallows, and were only got off with the\r\nassistance of the Frisii. Winter being close at hand, the campaign was\r\nabandoned till the following spring, and Drusus returned to Rome with\r\nthe honour of having been the first Roman general to reach the German\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nIn his second campaign (11), Drusus defeated the Usipetes, threw a\r\nbridge over the Luppia (_Lippe_), attacked the Sugambri, and advanced\r\nthrough their territory and that of the Tencteri and Chatti as far as\r\nthe Weser, where he gained a victory over the Cherusci. Lack of\r\nprovisions, the approach of winter, and an inauspicious portent\r\nprevented him from crossing the Weser. While making his way back to the\r\nRhine he fell into an ambuscade, but the carelessness of the enemy\r\nenabled him to inflict a crushing defeat upon them. In view of future\r\noperations, he built two castles, one at the junction of the Luppia and\r\nAliso (_Alme_), the other in the territory of the Chatti on the Taunus,\r\nnear Moguntiacum (_Mainz_).\r\n\r\nThe third campaign (10) was of little importance. The Chatti had joined\r\nthe Sugambri in revolt; and, after some insignificant successes, Drusus\r\nreturned with Augustus and Tiberius to Rome, and was elected consul for\r\nthe following year. In spite of unfavourable portents at Rome, he\r\ndetermined to enter upon his fourth and last campaign (9) without delay.\r\nHe attacked and defeated the Chatti, Suebi, Marcomanni and Cherusci,\r\ncrossed the Weser and penetrated as far as the Albis (_Elbe_). Here\r\ntrophies were set up to mark the farthest point ever reached by a Roman\r\narmy. Various measures were taken to secure the possession of the\r\nconquered territory: fortresses were erected along the Elbe, Weser and\r\nMaas (_Meuse_, _Mosa_); a flotilla was placed upon the Rhine and a dam\r\nbuilt upon the right arm of its estuary to increase the flow of water\r\ninto the canal mentioned above. Drusus was said to have been deterred\r\nfrom crossing the Elbe by the sudden appearance of a woman of\r\nsupernatural size, who predicted his approaching end. On his return,\r\nprobably between the Elbe and the Saale (_Sala_), his horse stumbled and\r\nthrew him. His leg was fractured and he died thirty days after the\r\naccident, on the 14th of September. Suetonius mentions an absurd rumour\r\nthat he had been poisoned by order of Augustus, because he had refused\r\nto obey the order for his recall. The body was carried to the winter\r\nquarters of the army, whence it was escorted by Tiberius to Rome, the\r\nprocession being joined by Augustus at Ticinum (Pavia). Tiberius\r\ndelivered an oration over the remains in the Forum, whence they were\r\nconveyed to the Campus Martius and cremated, and ashes being deposited\r\nin the mausoleum of Augustus.\r\n\r\nDrusus was one of the most distinguished men of his time. His agreeable\r\nmanners, handsome person and brilliant military talents gained him the\r\naffection of the troops, while his sympathy with republican principles,\r\nendeared him to the people. It is not too much to say that, had he and\r\nhis son lived long enough, they might have brought about the abolition\r\nof the monarchy. Although the successes of Drusus, resulting in the\r\nsubjection of the German tribes from the Rhine to the Elbe, were too\r\nrapid to be lasting, they brought home the fact of the existence of the\r\nRomans to many who had never heard their name. For his victories he\r\nreceived the title of Germanicus. He married Antonia, the daughter of\r\nMarcus Antonius the triumvir, by whom he had three children: Germanicus,\r\nadopted by Tiberius; Claudius, afterwards emperor; and a daughter\r\nLivilla.\r\n\r\n  The chief ancient authorities for the life of Drusus are Dio Cassius,\r\n  the epitomes of Livy, Suetonius (_Claudius_), Tacitus (portions of the\r\n  _Annals_), Florus (whose chief source is Livy), Velleius Paterculus,\r\n  and the _Consolatio ad Liviam_. The German campaigns were described in\r\n  the last books of Livy and the lost _Bella Germaniae_ of the elder\r\n  Pliny. As would naturally be expected, they have produced an extensive\r\n  literature in Germany, J. Asbach's \"Die Feldzüge des Nero Claudius\r\n  Drusus\" (_Rhein. Jahrb._ lxxxv. 14-30) being especially recommended;\r\n  see also Mommsen's _History of the Roman Provinces_, i.; Merivale,\r\n  _History of the Romans under the Empire_, ch. 36; A. Stein in\r\n  Pauly-Wissowa's _Realencyclopädie_ (1899), where other authorities are\r\n  given; J. C. Tarver, _Tiberius the Tyrant_ (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Originally Decimus.\r\n\r\n  [2] The district extending from Westervoort to Doesborgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUSUS CAESAR (c. 15 B.C.-A.D. 23), commonly called Drusus junior, to\r\ndistinguish him from his uncle Nero Claudius Drusus, was the only son of\r\nthe emperor Tiberius by his first wife Vipsania Agrippina. After having\r\nheld several curule offices, he was consul elect in A.D. 14, the year of\r\nAugustus's death. His father, on his accession to the throne,\r\nimmediately sent him to put down a mutiny of the troops in Pannonia, a\r\ntask which he successfully accomplished (Tacitus, _Annals_, i. 24-30).\r\nAs governor of Illyricum (17), he set the Germanic tribes against one\r\nanother, and encouraged Catualda, chief of the Gothones, to drive out\r\nMarbod (Maroboduus), king of the Marcomanni. On his return Drusus was\r\nconsul a second time (21) and in the following year received the\r\ntribunician authority from Tiberius, which practically indicated him as\r\nheir to the throne. Sejanus, who also aspired to the supreme power,\r\ndetermined to remove Drusus. He endeavoured to poison Tiberius's mind\r\nagainst him, seduced Drusus's wife and persuaded her to assist him in\r\nmurdering her husband. Her physician Eudemus prepared and the eunuch\r\nLygdus administered a slow poison, from the effects of which Drusus died\r\nafter a lingering illness. Although Tiberius is said to have received\r\nthe news of his death with indifference, there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat he had any hand in it; indeed, he seems to have entertained a\r\ngenuine affection for his son. Drusus was a man of violent passions, a\r\ndrunkard and a debauchee, but not entirely devoid of better feelings, as\r\nis shown by his undoubtedly sincere grief at the death of Germanicus.\r\nThe cunning and reserve which he exhibited on occasion were probably due\r\nto the instructions or influence of Tiberius (_Annals_, iii. 8), since\r\nhe was himself naturally frank and open, and for this reason,\r\nnotwithstanding his vices, more popular than his father. He revelled in\r\nbloody gladiatorial displays, and the sharpest swords used on such\r\noccasions were called \"Drusine.\"\r\n\r\n  See Tacitus, _Annals_, i. 76, iv. 8-11; Dio Cassius lvii. 13, 14;\r\n  Suetonius, _Tiberius_, 62; J.

By his\r\nuncle, Dr Lars Montin, to whom his education was entrusted, he was sent\r\nto the university of Gothenburg, whence he removed to Lund. After taking\r\nhis degree there in 1776, he studied at Upsala under Linnaeus, and then\r\nbecame for a time tutor to a young Swedish nobleman. He next visited\r\nEngland, and, on the death of his friend Dr Daniel Charles Solander\r\n(1736-1782), succeeded him as librarian to Sir Joseph Banks. He was\r\nlibrarian to the Royal Society and also to the Linnean Society. Of the\r\nlatter, in 1788, he was one of the founders, and, when it was\r\nincorporated by royal charter in 1802, he took a leading part in drawing\r\nup its laws and regulations. He was vice-president of the society till\r\nhis death, which took place in London on the 19th of October 1810.\r\nBesides papers in the Transactions of the Linnean and other societies,\r\nDryander published _Dissertatio gradualis fungos regno vegetabili\r\nvindicans_ (Lund, 1776), and _Catalogus bibliothecae historico-naturalis\r\nJosephi Banks, Bart._ (London, 1796-1800, 5 vols.). He also edited the\r\nfirst and part of the second edition of W. Aiton's _Hortus Kewensis_ and\r\nW. Roxburgh's _Plants of the Coast of Coromandel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRYBURGH ABBEY, a monastic ruin in the extreme south-west of\r\nBerwickshire, Scotland, about 5 m. S.E. of Melrose, and 1¼ m. E. of St\r\nBoswells station on the North British railway's Waverley route from\r\nEdinburgh to Carlisle. The name has been derived from the Gaelic _darach\r\nbruach_, \"oak bank,\" in allusion to the fact that the Druids once\r\npractised their rites here. The abbey occupies the spot where, about\r\n522, St Modan, an Irish Culdee, established a sanctuary--a secluded\r\nposition on a tongue of land washed on three sides by the Tweed. Founded\r\nin 1150 by David I.--though it has also been ascribed to Hugh de\r\nMorville (d. 1162), lord of Lauderdale and constable of Scotland--it\r\nenjoyed great prosperity until 1322, when it was partially destroyed by\r\nthe English under Edward II. It suffered again at the hands of Richard\r\nII. in 1385, and was reduced to ruin during the expedition of the earl\r\nof Hertford in 1545. After the Reformation the estate was erected into a\r\ntemporal lordship and given (1604) by James VI. to John Erskine, 2nd\r\nearl of Mar. At a later date it was sold, but reverted to a branch of\r\nthe Erskines in 1786, when it was acquired by the 11th earl of Buchan.\r\nIn 1700 the abbey lands belonged to Thomas Haliburton, Scott's\r\ngreat-grandfather, and, but for an extravagant grand-uncle who became\r\nbankrupt and had to part with the property, they would have descended to\r\nSir Walter by inheritance. \"We have nothing left of Dryburgh,\" he said,\r\n\"but the right of stretching our bones there.\" The style in general is\r\nEarly English, but the west door and the restored entrance from the nave\r\nto the cloisters are fine examples of transitional Norman. Though in\r\nvarious stages of decay, nearly every one of the monastic buildings is\r\nrepresented by a fragment. Of the cruciform church--190 ft. long by 75\r\nbroad at the transepts--there remain some of the outer walls, a segment\r\nof the choir, the east aisle of the north transept, the stumps of some\r\nof the pillars of the nave, the west gable, the south transept and its\r\nadjacent chapel of St Modan. The most beautiful of these relics is St\r\nMary's aisle of the north transept, in which were buried Sir Walter\r\nScott (1832), his wife, son, his son-in-law John Gibson Lockhart, and\r\nhis ancestors, the Haliburtons of New Mains. Sir Walter's tomb is a\r\nplain block of polished Peterhead granite, inscribed only with his name\r\nand the dates of his birth and death. The next aisle is the burial-place\r\nof the Erskines of Shielhill and the Haigs of Bemersyde. On the south\r\nside of the church, at a lower level, stand the cloisters, about 100 ft.\r\nsquare, bounded on the west by the dungeons, on the south-west by the\r\ncellars and refectory, in the west wall of which is an exquisite\r\nivy-clad rose window, and on the east by the chapter-house, on a still\r\nlower level. The chapter-house, a lofty building with vaulted roof, is\r\nthe most complete structure of the group, and adjoining it on the south\r\nare, first the abbot's parlour and then the library, the three\r\napartments communicating with each other, and constituting the oldest\r\nportion of the abbey. In the grounds are many venerable trees, a yew\r\nnear the chapter-house being at least coeval with the abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRYDEN, JOHN (1631-1700), English poet, born on or about the 9th of\r\nAugust 1631, at Aldwinkle, in Northamptonshire, was of Cumberland stock,\r\nthough his family had been settled for three generations in\r\nNorthamptonshire, had acquired estates and a baronetcy, and intermarried\r\nwith landed families in that county. His great-grandfather, who first\r\ncarried the name south, and acquired by marriage the estate of Canons\r\nAshby, is said to have known Erasmus, and to have been so proud of the\r\ngreat scholar's friendship that he gave the name of Erasmus to his\r\neldest son. The name Erasmus was borne by the poet's father, the third\r\nson of Sir Erasmus Dryden. The leanings and connexions of the family\r\nwere Puritan and anti-monarchical. Sir Erasmus Dryden went to prison\r\nrather than pay loan money to Charles I.; the poet's uncle, Sir John\r\nDryden, and his father Erasmus, served on government commissions during\r\nthe Commonwealth. His mother's family, the Pickerings, were still more\r\nprominent on the Puritan side. Sir Gilbert Pickering, his cousin, was\r\nchamberlain to the Protector, and was summoned to Cromwell's House of\r\nLords in 1657. A trustworthy tradition asserts that John Dryden was born\r\nat the rectory of Aldwinkle All Saints, of which his maternal\r\ngrandfather, Henry Pickering, was rector.\r\n\r\nDryden's education was such as became a scion of these respectable\r\nfamilies of squires and rectors, among whom the chance contact with\r\nErasmus had left a certain tradition of scholarship. His father, whose\r\nown fortune, added to his wife's, was not large, procured for the poet,\r\nwho was the eldest of fourteen children, admission to Westminster school\r\nas a king's scholar, under the famous Dr Busby. Some elegiac verses\r\nwhich Dryden wrote there on the death of a schoolfellow, Henry, Lord\r\nHastings, son of the earl of Huntingdon, in 1649, were published in\r\n_Lacrymae Musarum_, among other elegies by \"divers persons of nobility\r\nand worth\" in commemoration of the same event. He appeared soon after\r\nagain in print, among writers of commendatory verses to a friend of his,\r\nJohn Hoddesdon, who published a volume of _Epigrams_ in 1650. Dryden's\r\ncontribution is signed \"John Dryden of Trinity C.,\" as he had gone up\r\nfrom Westminster to Cambridge in May 1650. He was elected a scholar of\r\nTrinity on the Westminster foundation in October of the same year, and\r\ntook his degree of B.A. in 1654. The only recorded incident of his\r\ncollege residence is some unexplained act of disobedience to the\r\nvice-master, for which he was \"put out of commons\" and \"gated\" for a\r\nfortnight. His father died in 1654, leaving him master of two-thirds of\r\na small estate near Blakesley, worth about £60 a year. The next three\r\nyears he is said to have spent at Cambridge. In any case they were spent\r\nsomewhere in study; for his first considerable poem bears indisputable\r\nmarks of scholarly habits, as well as of a command of verse that could\r\nnot have been acquired without practice.\r\n\r\nThe middle of 1657 is given as the date of his leaving the university to\r\ntake up his residence in London. In one of his many subsequent literary\r\nquarrels, it was said by Shadwell that he had been clerk to Sir Gilbert\r\nPickering, his cousin, who was chamberlain to Cromwell; and nothing is\r\nmore likely than that he obtained some employment under his powerful\r\ncousin when he came to London. He is said to have lived at first in the\r\nhouse of his first publisher, Herringman, with whom he was connected\r\ntill 1679, when Jacob Tonson began to publish his books. He first\r\nemerged from obscurity with his _Heroic Stanzas_ (1659) to the memory of\r\nthe Protector. That these stanzas should have made him a name as a poet\r\ndoes not appear surprising when we compare them with Waller's verses on\r\nthe same occasion. Dryden took some time to consider them, and it was\r\nimpossible that they should not give an impression of his intellectual\r\nstrength. Donne was his model; it is obvious that both his ear and his\r\nimagination were saturated with Donne's elegiac strains when he wrote;\r\nyet when we look beneath the surface we find unmistakable traces that\r\nthe pupil was not without decided theories that ran counter to the\r\npractice of the master. It is plainly not by accident that each stanza\r\ncontains one clear-cut brilliant point. The poem is an academic\r\nexercise, and it seems to be animated by an under-current of strong\r\ncontumacious protest against the irregularities tolerated by the\r\nauthorities. Dryden had studied the ancient classics for himself, and\r\ntheir method of uniformity and elaborate finish commended itself to his\r\nrobust and orderly mind. In itself the poem is a magnificent tribute to\r\nthe memory of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nTo those who regard the poet as a seer with a sacred mission, and refuse\r\nthe name altogether to a literary manufacturer to order, it comes with a\r\ncertain shock to find Dryden, the hereditary Puritan, the panegyrist of\r\nCromwell, hailing the return of King Charles in _Astraea Redux_ (1660),\r\ndeploring his long absence, and proclaiming the despair with which he\r\nhad seen \"the rebel thrive, the loyal crost.\" _A Panegyric on the\r\nCoronation_ followed in 1661. From a literary point of view also,\r\n_Astraea Redux_ is inferior to the _Heroic Stanzas_.\r\n\r\nDryden was compelled to supplement his slender income by his writings.\r\nHe naturally first thought of tragedy,--his own genius, as he has\r\ninformed us, inclining him rather to that species of composition; and in\r\nthe first year of the Restoration he wrote a tragedy on the fate of\r\nHenry, duke of Guise. But some friends advised him that its construction\r\nwas not suited to the requirements of the stage, so he put it aside, and\r\nused only one scene of the original play later on, when he again\r\nattempted the subject with a more practised hand. Having failed to write\r\na suitable tragedy, he next turned his attention to comedy, although, as\r\nhe admitted, he had little natural turn for it. \"I confess,\" he said, in\r\na short essay in his own defence, printed before _The Indian Emperor_,\r\n\"my chief endeavours are to delight the age in which I live. If the\r\nhumour of this be for low comedy, small accidents and raillery, I will\r\nforce my genius to obey it, though with more reputation I could write in\r\nverse. I know I am not so fitted by nature to write comedy; I want that\r\ngaiety of humour which is required to it. My conversation is slow and\r\ndull; my humour saturnine and reserved; in short, I am none of those who\r\nendeavour to break jests in company or make repartees. So that those who\r\ndecry my comedies do me no injury, except it be in point of profit;\r\nreputation in them is the last thing to which I shall pretend.\" He was\r\nreally as well as ostentatiously a playwright; the age demanded\r\ncomedies, and he endeavoured to supply the kind of comedy that the age\r\ndemanded. His first attempt was unsuccessful. Bustle, intrigue and\r\ncoarsely humorous dialogue seemed to him to be part of the popular\r\ndemand; and, looking about for a plot, he found something to suit him in\r\na Spanish source, and wrote _The Wild Gallant_. The play was acted in\r\nFebruary 1663, by Thomas Killigrew's company in Vere Street. It was not\r\na success, and Pepys showed good judgment in pronouncing the play \"so\r\npoor a thing as ever I saw in my life.\" Dryden never learned moderation\r\nin his humour; there is a student's clumsiness and extravagance in his\r\nindecency; the plays of Etheredge, a man of the world, have not the\r\nuncouth riotousness of Dryden's. Of this he seems to have been\r\nconscious, for when the play was revived, in 1667, he complained in the\r\nepilogue of the difficulty of comic wit, and admitted the right of a\r\ncommon audience to judge of the wit's success. Dryden, indeed, took a\r\nlesson from the failure of _The Wild Gallant_; his next comedy, _The\r\nRival Ladies_, also founded on a Spanish plot, produced before the end\r\nof 1663, and printed in the next year, was correctly described by Pepys\r\nas \"a very innocent and most pretty witty play,\" though there was much\r\nin it which the taste of our time would consider indelicate. But he\r\nnever quite conquered his tendency to extravagance. _The Wild Gallant_\r\nwas not the only victim. _The Assignation, or Love in a Nunnery_,\r\nproduced in 1673, shared the same fate; and even as late as 1680, when\r\nhe had had twenty years' experience to guide him, _The Kind Keeper, or\r\nMr Limberham_ was prohibited, after three representations, as being too\r\nindecent for the stage. Dislike to indecency we are apt to think a\r\nsomewhat ludicrous pretext to be made by Restoration playgoers, and\r\nprobably there was some other reason for the sacrifice of _Limberham_;\r\nstill there is a certain savageness in the spirit of Dryden's indecency\r\nwhich we do not find in his most licentious contemporaries. The\r\nundisciplined force of the man carried him to an excess from which more\r\ndexterous writers held back.\r\n\r\nAfter the production of _The Rival Ladies_ in 1663, Dryden assisted Sir\r\nRobert Howard in the composition of a tragedy in heroic verse, _The\r\nIndian Queen_, produced with great splendour in January 1664. He married\r\nLady Elizabeth Howard, Sir Robert's sister and daughter of the 1st earl\r\nof Berkshire, on the 1st of December 1663. Lady Elizabeth's reputation\r\nwas somewhat compromised before this union, which was not a happy one,\r\nand there is some evidence for the scandal in a letter written by her\r\nbefore her marriage to Philip, 2nd earl of Chesterfield. _The Indian\r\nQueen_ was a great success, one of the greatest since the reopening of\r\nthe theatres. This was in all likelihood due much less to the heroic\r\nverse and the exclusion of comic scenes from the tragedy than to the\r\nmagnificent scenic accessories--the battles and sacrifices on the stage,\r\nthe spirits singing in the air, and the god of dreams ascending through\r\na trap. The novelty of these Indian spectacles, as well as of the Indian\r\ncharacters, with the splendid Queen Zempoalla, acted by Mrs Marshall in\r\na real Indian dress of feathers presented to her by Mrs Aphra Behn, as\r\nthe centre of the play, was the chief secret of the success of _The\r\nIndian Queen_. These melodramatic properties were so marked a novelty\r\nthat they could not fail to draw the town. Dryden was tempted to return\r\nto tragedy; he followed up _The Indian Queen_ with _The Indian Emperor,\r\nor the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards_, which was acted in 1665,\r\nand also proved a success.\r\n\r\nBut Dryden was not content with writing tragedies in rhymed verse. He\r\ntook up the question of the propriety of rhyme in serious plays\r\nimmediately after the success of _The Indian Queen_, in the preface to\r\nan edition (1664) of _The Rival Ladies_. In that first statement of his\r\ncase, he considered the chief objection to the use of rhyme, and urged\r\nhis chief argument in its favour. Rhyme was not natural, some people had\r\nsaid; to which he answers that it is as natural as blank verse, and that\r\nmuch of its unnaturalness is not the fault of the rhyme but of the\r\nwriter, who has not sufficient command of language to rhyme easily. In\r\nfavour of rhyme he has to say that it at once stimulates the\r\nimagination, and prevents it from being too discursive in its flights.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Plague, when the theatres were closed, and Dryden was\r\nliving at Charlton, Wiltshire, at the seat of his father-in-law, the\r\nearl of Berkshire, he occupied a considerable part of his time in\r\nthinking over the principles of dramatic composition, and threw his\r\nconclusions into the form of a dialogue, which he called an _Essay of\r\nDramatick Poesie_ and published in 1668. The essay takes the form of a\r\ndialogue between Neander (Dryden), Eugenius (Charles, Lord Buckhurst,\r\nafterwards earl of Dorset), Crites (Sir R. Howard), and Lisideius (Sir\r\nC. Sedley), who is made responsible for the famous definition of a play\r\nas a \"just and lively image of human nature, representing its passions\r\nand humours, and the changes of fortune to which it is subject, for the\r\ndelight and instruction of mankind.\" Dryden's form is of course borrowed\r\nfrom the ancients, and his main source is the critical work of Corneille\r\nin the prefaces and discourses contained in the edition of 1660, but he\r\nwas well acquainted with the whole body of contemporary French and\r\nSpanish criticism. Crites maintains the superiority of the classical\r\ndrama; Lisideius supports the exacting rules of French dramatic writing;\r\nNeander defends the English drama of the preceding generations,\r\nincluding, in a long speech, an examination of Ben Jonson's _Silent\r\nWoman_. Neander argues, however, that English drama has much to gain by\r\nthe observance of exact methods of construction without abandoning\r\nentirely the liberty which English writers had always claimed. He then\r\ngoes on to defend the use of rhyme in serious drama. Howard had argued\r\nagainst the use of rhyme in a \"preface\" to _Four New Plays_ (1665),\r\nwhich had furnished the excuse for Dryden's essay. Howard replied to\r\nDryden's essay in a preface to _The Duke of Lerma_ (1668). Dryden at\r\nonce replied in a masterpiece of sarcastic retort and vigorous\r\nreasoning, _A Defence of an Essay of Dramatique Poesie_, prefixed to the\r\nsecond edition (1668) of _The Indian Emperor_. It is the ablest and most\r\ncomplete statement of his views about the employment of rhymed couplets\r\nin tragedy.\r\n\r\nBefore his return to town at the end of 1666, when the theatres (which\r\nhad been closed during the disasters of 1665 and 1666) were reopened,\r\nDryden wrote a poem on the Dutch war and the Great Fire entitled _Annus\r\nMirabilis_. The poem is in quatrains, the metre of his _Heroic Stanzas_\r\nin praise of Cromwell, which Dryden chose, he tells us, \"because he had\r\never judged it more noble and of greater dignity both for the sound and\r\nnumber than any other verse in use amongst us.\" The preface to the poem\r\ncontains an interesting discussion of what he calls \"wit-writing,\"\r\nintroduced by the remark that \"the composition of all poems is or ought\r\nto be of wit.\" His description of the Great Fire is a famous specimen of\r\nthis wit-writing, much more careless and daring, and much more difficult\r\nto sympathize with, than the graver conceits in his panegyric of the\r\nProtector. In _Annus Mirabilis_ the poet apostrophizes the newly founded\r\nRoyal Society, of which he had been elected a member in 1662.\r\n\r\nFrom the reopening of the theatres in 1666 till November 1681, the date\r\nof his _Absalom and Achitophel_, Dryden produced nothing but plays. The\r\nstage was his chief source of income. _Secret Love, or the Maiden\r\nQueen_, a tragi-comedy, produced in March 1667, was based on an episode\r\nin the _Artamène, ou le Grand Cyrus_ of Mlle de Scudéry, the historical\r\noriginal of the \"Maiden Queen\" being Christina, queen of Sweden. The\r\nprologue claims that the piece is written with pains and thought, by the\r\nexactest rules, with strict observance of the unities, and \"a mingled\r\nchime of Jonson's humour and of Corneille's rhyme\"; but it owed its\r\nsuccess chiefly to the charm of Nell Gwyn's acting in the part of\r\nFlorimel. It is noticeable that only the more passionate parts of the\r\ndialogue are rhymed, Dryden's theory apparently being that rhyme is then\r\ndemanded for the elevation of the style. His next play, _Sir Martin\r\nMar-all, or the Feigned Innocence_, an adaptation in prose of the duke\r\nof Newcastle's translation of Molière's _L'Étourdi_, was produced at the\r\nDuke's theatre, without the author's name, in 1667. It was about this\r\ntime that Dryden became a retained writer under contract for the King's\r\ntheatre, receiving from it £300 or £400 a year, till it was burnt down\r\nin 1672, and about £200 for six years more till the beginning of 1678.\r\nHis co-operation with Davenant in a new version (1667) of Shakespeare's\r\n_Tempest_--for his share in which Dryden can hardly be pardoned on the\r\nground that the chief alterations were happy thoughts of Davenant's,\r\nseeing that he affirms he never worked at anything with more\r\ndelight--must also be supposed to be anterior to the completion of his\r\ncontract with the Theatre Royal. He was engaged to write three plays a\r\nyear, and he contributed only ten plays during the ten years of his\r\nengagement, finally exhausting the patience of his partners by joining\r\nin the composition of a play for the rival house. In adapting\r\n_L'Étourdi_, Dryden did not catch Molière's lightness of touch; his\r\nalterations go towards making the comedy into a farce. Perhaps all the\r\nmore on this account _Sir Martin Mar-all_ had a great run at the theatre\r\nin Lincoln's Inn Fields. There is always a certain coarseness in\r\nDryden's humour, apart from the coarseness of his age,--a certain\r\nforcible roughness of touch which belongs to the character of the man.\r\nHis _An Evening's Love, or the Mock Astrologer_, an adaptation from _Le\r\nFeint Astrologue_ of the younger Corneille, produced at the King's\r\ntheatre in 1668, seemed to Pepys \"very smutty, and nothing so good as\r\n_The Maiden Queen_ or _The Indian Emperor_ of Dryden's making.\" Evelyn\r\nthought it foolish and profane, and was grieved \"to see how the stage\r\nwas degenerated and polluted by the licentious times.\" _Ladies à la\r\nMode_, another of Dryden's contract comedies, produced in 1668, was \"so\r\nmean a thing,\" Pepys says, that it was only once acted, and Dryden never\r\npublished it. Of his other comedies, _Marriage à la Mode_ (produced\r\n1672), _The Assignation, or Love in a Nunnery_ (1673), _The Kind Keeper,\r\nor Mr Limberham_ (1678), only the first was moderately successful.\r\n\r\nWhile Dryden met with such indifferent success in his willing efforts to\r\nsupply the demand of the age for low comedy, he struck upon a really\r\npopular and profitable vein in heroic tragedy. _Tyrannic Love, or the\r\nRoyal Martyr_, a Roman play dealing with the persecution of the\r\nChristians by Maximin, in which St Catherine is introduced, and with her\r\nsome supernatural machinery, was produced in 1669. It is in rhymed\r\ncouplets, but the author again did not trust solely for success to them;\r\nfor, besides the magic incantations, the singing angels, and the view of\r\nParadise, he made Nell Gwyn, who had stabbed herself as Valeria, start\r\nto life again as she was being carried off the stage, and speak a\r\nriotous epilogue, in violent contrast to the serious character of the\r\nplay. _Almanzor and Almahide, or the Conquest of Granada_, a tragedy in\r\ntwo parts, was written in 1669 to 1670. The historical background is\r\ntaken chiefly from Mlle de Scudéry's romance of _Almahide_, but Dryden\r\nborrows freely from other books of hers and her contemporaries. This\r\npiece seems to have given the crowning touch of provocation to the wits,\r\nwho had never ceased to ridicule the popular taste for these extravagant\r\nheroic plays. Dryden almost invited burlesque in his epilogue to the\r\nsecond part of _The Conquest of Granada_, in which he charged the comedy\r\nof the Elizabethan age with coarseness and mechanical humour, and its\r\nconceptions of love and honour with meanness, and claimed for his own\r\ntime and his own plays an advance in these respects. _The Rehearsal_,\r\nwritten by the duke of Buckingham, with the assistance, it was said, of\r\nSamuel Butler, Martin Clifford, Thomas Sprat and others, and produced in\r\n1671, was a severe and just punishment for this boast. Davenant was\r\noriginally the hero, but on his death in 1668 the satire was turned upon\r\nDryden, who is here unmercifully ridiculed under the name of Bayes, the\r\nname being justified by his appointment in 1670 as poet laureate and\r\nhistoriographer to the king (with a pension of £300 a year and a butt of\r\ncanary wine). It is said that _The Rehearsal_ was begun in 1663 and\r\nready for representation before the plague. But this probably only means\r\nthat Buckingham and his friends had resolved to burlesque the\r\nabsurdities of Davenant's operatic heroes in _The Siege of Rhodes_, and\r\nthe extravagant heroics of _The Indian Queen_. Materials accumulated\r\nupon them as the fashion continued, and by the time Dryden had produced\r\nhis _Tyrannic Love_, and his _Conquest of Granada_, he had so\r\nestablished himself as the chief offender as to become naturally the\r\ncentral figure of the burlesque. Later Dryden fully avenged himself on\r\nBuckingham by his portrait of Zimri in _Absalom and Achitophel_. His\r\nimmediate reply is contained in the preface \"Of Heroic Plays\" and the\r\n\"Defence of the Epilogue,\" printed in the first edition (1672) of his\r\n_Conquest of Granada_. In these, so far from laughing with his censors,\r\nhe addresses them from the eminence of success. \"But I have already\r\nswept the stakes; and, with the common good fortune of prosperous\r\ngamesters, can be content to sit quietly; to hear my fortune cursed by\r\nsome, and my faults arraigned by others, and to suffer both without\r\nreply.\" Heroic verse, he assures them, is so established that few\r\ntragedies are likely henceforward to be written in any other metre. In\r\nthe course of a year or two _The Conquest of Granada_ was attacked also\r\nby Elkanah Settle, on whom Dryden revenged himself later, making him the\r\n\"Doeg\" of the second part of _Absalom and Achitophel_.\r\n\r\nHis next tragedy, _Amboyna_ (1673), an exhibition of certain atrocities\r\ncommitted by the Dutch on English merchants in the East Indies, put on\r\nthe stage to inflame the public mind in view of the Dutch war, was\r\nwritten, with the exception of a few passages, in prose, and those\r\npassages in blank verse. An opera which he wrote in rhymed couplets,\r\ncalled _The State of Innocence, and Fall of Man_, an attempt to turn\r\npart of _Paradise Lost_ into rhyme, as a proof of its superiority to\r\nblank verse, was prefaced by an \"Apology for Heroique Poetry and\r\nPoetique Licence,\" and entered at Stationers' Hall in 1674, but it was\r\nnever acted. The redeeming circumstance about the performance is the\r\nadmiration professed by the adapter for his original, which he\r\npronounces \"undoubtedly one of the greatest, most noble and most sublime\r\npoems which either this age or nation has produced.\" Dryden is said to\r\nhave had the elder poet's leave \"to tag his verses.\" In _Aurengzebe_,\r\nwhich was Dryden's last, and also his best, rhymed tragedy, he borrowed\r\nfrom contemporary history, for the Great Mogul was still living. In the\r\nprologue he confessed that he had grown weary of his long-loved\r\nmistress rhyme and retracted, with characteristic frankness, his\r\ndisparaging contrast of the Elizabethan with his own age. But the stings\r\nof _The Rehearsal_ had stimulated him to do his utmost to justify his\r\ndevotion to his mistress, and he claims that _Aurengzebe_ is \"the most\r\ncorrect\" of his plays. It was entered at Stationers' Hall and probably\r\nacted in 1675, and published in the following year.\r\n\r\nAfter the production of _Aurengzebe_ he seems to have rested for an\r\ninterval from writing, enabled to do so, probably by an additional\r\npension of £100 granted to him by the king. During this interval he\r\nwould seem to have reconsidered the principles of dramatic composition,\r\nand to have made a particular study of the works of Shakespeare. The\r\nfruits of this appeared in _All for Love, or the World Well Lost_, a\r\nversion of the story of Antony and Cleopatra, produced in 1678, which\r\nmust be regarded as a very remarkable departure for a man of his age,\r\nand a wonderful proof of undiminished openness and plasticity of mind.\r\nIn his previous writings on dramatic theory, Dryden, while admiring the\r\nrhyme of the French dramatists as an advance in art, did not give\r\nunqualified praise to the regularity of their plots; he was disposed to\r\nallow the irregular structure of the Elizabethan dramatists, as being\r\nmore favourable to variety both of action and of character. But now, in\r\nfrank imitation of Shakespeare, he abandoned rhyme, and, if we might\r\njudge from _All for Love_, and the precepts laid down in his \"Grounds of\r\nCriticism in Tragedy,\" prefixed to _Troilus and Cressida_ (1679), the\r\nchief point in which he aimed at excelling the Elizabethans was in\r\ngiving greater unity to his plot. He upheld still the superiority of\r\nShakespeare to the French dramatists in the delineation of character,\r\nbut he thought that the scope of the action might be restricted, and the\r\nparts bound more closely together with advantage. _All for Love_ and\r\n_Antony and Cleopatra_ are two excellent plays for the comparison of the\r\ntwo methods. Dryden gave all his strength to _All for Love_, writing the\r\nplay for himself, as he said, and not for the public. Carrying out the\r\nidea expressed in the title, he represents the two lovers as being more\r\nentirely under the dominion of love than Shakespeare's Antony and\r\nCleopatra. Shakespeare's Antony is moved by other impulses than the\r\npassion for Cleopatra; it is his master motive, but it has to maintain a\r\nstruggle for supremacy; \"Roman thoughts\" strike in upon him even in the\r\nvery height of the enjoyment of his mistress's love, he chafes under the\r\nyoke, and breaks away from her of his own impulse at the call of\r\nspontaneously reawakened ambition. Dryden's Antony is so deeply sunk in\r\nlove that no other impulse has power to stir him; it takes much\r\npersuasion and skilful artifice to detach him from Cleopatra even in\r\nthought, and his soul returns to her violently before the rupture has\r\nbeen completed. On the other hand, Dryden's Cleopatra is so completely\r\nenslaved by love for Antony that she is incapable of using the\r\ncalculated caprices and meretricious coquetries which Shakespeare's\r\nCleopatra deliberately practises as the highest art of love, the surest\r\nway of maintaining her empire over her great captain's heart. It is with\r\ndifficulty that Dryden's Cleopatra will agree, on the earnest\r\nsolicitation of a wily counsellor, to feign a liking for Dolabella to\r\nexcite Antony's jealousy, and she cannot keep up the pretence through a\r\nfew sentences. The characters of the two lovers are thus very much\r\ncontracted, indeed almost overwhelmed, beneath the pressure of the one\r\nruling motive. And as Dryden thus introduces a greater regularity of\r\ncharacter into the drama, so he also very much contracts the action, in\r\norder to give probability to this temporary subjugation of individual\r\ncharacter. The action of Dryden's play takes place wholly in Alexandria,\r\nwithin the compass of a few days; it does not, like Shakespeare's,\r\nextend over several years, and present incessant changes of scene.\r\nDryden chooses, as it were, a fragment of a historical action, a single\r\nmoment during which motives play within a narrow circle, the culminating\r\npoint in the relations between his two personages. He devotes his whole\r\nplay, also, to those relations; only what bears upon them is admitted.\r\nIn Shakespeare's play we get a certain historical perspective, in which\r\nthe love of Antony and Cleopatra appears in its true proportions\r\nbeneath the firmament that overhangs human affairs. In Dryden's play\r\nthis love is our universe; all the other concerns of the world retire\r\ninto a shadowy, indistinct background. If we rise from a comparison of\r\nthe plays with an impression that the Elizabethan drama is a higher type\r\nof drama, taking Dryden's own definition of the word as \"a just and\r\nlively image of human nature,\" we rise also with an impression of\r\nDryden's power such as we get from nothing else that he had written\r\nsince his _Heroic Stanzas_, twenty years before.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve years before Dryden produced another tragedy worthy of the\r\npower shown in _All for Love_. _Don Sebastian_ was acted and published\r\nin 1690. In the interval, to sum up briefly Dryden's work as a\r\ndramatist, he wrote _Oedipus_ (pr. 1679) and _The Duke of Guise_ (pr.\r\n1683) in conjunction with Nathaniel Lee; _Troilus and Cressida_ (1679);\r\n_The Spanish Friar_ (1681); _Albion and Albanius_, an opera (1685);\r\n_Amphitryon_ (1690). In _Troilus and Cressida_ he follows Shakespeare\r\nclosely in the plot, but the dialogue is rewritten throughout, and not\r\nfor the better. The versification and the language of the first and the\r\nthird acts of _Oedipus_, which with the general plan of the play were\r\nDryden's contribution to the joint work, bear marked evidence of his\r\nrecent study of Shakespeare. The _Duke of Guise_ provided an obvious\r\nparallel with contemporary English politics. Henry III. was identified\r\nwith Charles II., and Monmouth with the duke. The lord chamberlain\r\nrefused to license it until the political situation was less disturbed.\r\nThe plot of _Don Sebastian_ is more intricate than that of _All for\r\nLove_. It has also more of the characteristics of his heroic dramas; the\r\nextravagance of sentiment and the suddenness of impulse remind us\r\noccasionally of _The Indian Emperor_; but the characters are much more\r\nelaborately studied than in Dryden's earlier plays, and the verse is\r\nsinewy and powerful. It would be difficult to say whether _Don\r\nSebastian_ or _All for Love_ is his best play; they share the palm\r\nbetween them. Dryden's subsequent plays are not remarkable. Their titles\r\nand dates are--_King Arthur_, an opera (1691), for which Purcell wrote\r\nthe music; _Cleomenes_ (1692); _Love Triumphant_ (1694).\r\n\r\nSoon after Dryden's abandonment of heroic couplets in tragedy, he found\r\nnew and more congenial work for his favourite instrument in satire. As\r\nusual the idea was not original to Dryden, though he struck in with his\r\nmajestic step and energy divine, and immediately took the lead. The\r\npioneer was Mulgrave in his _Essay on Satire_, an attack on Rochester\r\nand the court, which was circulated in MS. in 1679. Dryden himself was\r\nsuspected of the authorship, and it is not impossible that he gave some\r\nhelp in revising it; but it is not likely that he attacked the king on\r\nwhom he was dependent for the greater part of his income, and Mulgrave\r\nin a note to his _Art of Poetry_ in 1717 expressly asserts Dryden's\r\nignorance. Dryden, however, was attacked in Rose Street, Covent Garden,\r\nand severely cudgelled by a company of ruffians who were generally\r\nsupposed to have been hired by Rochester. In the same year Oldham's\r\nsatire on the Jesuits had immense popularity, chiefly owing to the\r\nexcitement about the Popish plot. Dryden took the field as a satirist\r\ntowards the close of 1681, on the side of the court, at the moment when\r\nShaftesbury, baffled in his efforts to exclude the duke of York from the\r\nthrone as a papist, and secure the succession of the duke of Monmouth,\r\nwas waiting his trial for high treason. _Absalom and Achitophel_\r\nproduced a great stir. Nine editions were sold in rapid succession in\r\nthe course of a year. There was no compunction in Dryden's ridicule and\r\ninvective. Delicate wit was not one of Dryden's gifts; the motions of\r\nhis weapon were sweeping, and the blows hard and trenchant. The\r\nadvantage he had gained by his recent studies of character was fully\r\nused in his portraits of Shaftesbury and Buckingham, Achitophel and\r\nZimri. In these portraits he shows considerable art in the introduction\r\nof redeeming traits to the general outline of malignity and depravity.\r\nIt is not impossible that the fact that his pension had not been paid\r\nsince the beginning of 1680 weighed with him in writing this satire to\r\ngain the favour of the court. In a play produced in 1681, _The Spanish\r\nFriar_, he had written on the other side, gratifying the popular\r\nfeeling by attacking the Roman Catholic priesthood.\r\n\r\nThree other satires followed _Absalom and Achitophel_, one of them\r\nhardly inferior in point of literary power. _The Medall_; a _Satyre\r\nagainst Sedition_ (March 1682) was written in ridicule of the medal\r\nstruck to commemorate Shaftesbury's acquittal. Then Dryden had to take\r\nvengeance on the literary champions of the Whig party who had opened\r\nupon him with all their artillery. Their leader, Shadwell, had attacked\r\nhim in _The Medal of John Bayes_, which Dryden answered in October 1682\r\nby _Mac Flecknoe, or a Satyr upon the True-Blew Protestant Poet, T.S._\r\nThis satire, in which Shadwell filled the title-rôle, served as the\r\nmodel of the _Dunciad_. To the second part of _Absalom and Achitophel_\r\n(November 1682), written chiefly by Nahum Tate, he contributed a long\r\npassage of invective against Robert Ferguson, one of Monmouth's chief\r\nadvisers, Elkanah Settle, Shadwell and others. _Religio Laici_, which\r\nappeared in the same month, though nominally an exposition of a layman's\r\ncreed, and deservedly admired as such, was not without a political\r\npurpose. It attacked the Papists, but declared the \"fanatics\" to be\r\nstill more dangerous.\r\n\r\nDryden's next poem in heroic couplets was in a different strain. On the\r\naccession of James, in 1685, he became a Roman Catholic. There has been\r\nmuch discussion as to whether this conversion was or was not sincere. It\r\ncan only be said that the coincidence between his change of faith and\r\nhis change of patron was suspicious, and that Dryden's character for\r\nconsistency is certainly not of a kind to quench suspicion. The force of\r\nthe coincidence cannot be removed by such pleas as that his wife had\r\nbeen a Roman Catholic for several years, or that he was converted by his\r\nson, who was converted at Cambridge, even if there were any evidence for\r\nthese statements. Scott defended Dryden's conversion,--as Macaulay\r\ndenounced it, from party motives. It is worth while, however, to notice\r\nthat in his earlier defence of the English Church he exhibits a desire\r\nfor the definite guidance of a presumably infallible creed, and the case\r\nfor the Roman Church brought forward at the time may have appeared\r\nconvincing to a mind singularly open to new impressions. At the same\r\ntime nothing can be clearer than that Dryden always regarded his\r\nliterary powers as a means of subsistence, and had little scruple about\r\naccepting a brief on any side. _The Hind and the Panther_, published in\r\n1687, is an ingenious argument for Roman Catholicism, put into the mouth\r\nof \"a milk-white hind, immortal and unchanged.\" There is considerable\r\nbeauty in the picture of this tender creature, and its enemies in the\r\nforest are not spared. One can understand the admiration that the poem\r\nreceived when such allegories were in fashion. It was the chief cause of\r\nthe veneration with which Dryden was regarded by Pope, who, himself\r\neducated in the Roman Catholic faith, was taken as a boy of twelve to\r\nsee the veteran poet in his chair of honour and authority at Wills's\r\ncoffee-house. It was also very open to ridicule, and was treated in this\r\nspirit by Prior and Montagu, the future earl of Halifax, in _The Hind\r\nand the Panther transversed to the story of the Country Mouse and the\r\nCity Mouse_. Dryden's other literary services to James were a savage\r\nreply to Stillingfleet--who had attacked two papers published by the\r\nking immediately after his accession, one said to have been written by\r\nhis late brother in advocacy of the Church of Rome, the other by his\r\nlate wife explaining the reasons for her conversion--and a translation\r\nof a life of Xavier in prose. He had written also a panegyric of\r\nCharles, _Threnodia Augustalis_, and a poem in honour of the birth of\r\nJames II.'s heir, under the title of _Britannia rediviva_ (1688).\r\n\r\nDryden did not abjure his new faith on the Revolution, and so lost his\r\noffice and pension as laureate and historiographer royal. For this act\r\nof constancy he deserves credit, if the new powers would have considered\r\nhis services worth having after his frequent apostasies. His rival\r\nShadwell reigned in his stead. Dryden was once more thrown mainly upon\r\nhis pen for support. He turned again to the stage and wrote the plays\r\nalready enumerated. A great feature in the last decade of his life was\r\nhis translations from the classics. _Ovid's Epistles translated_\r\nappeared in 1680; and numerous translations from Virgil, Horace, Ovid,\r\nLucretius and Theocritus appeared in the four volumes of _Miscellany\r\nPoems_--_Miscellany Poems_ (1684), _Sylvae_ (1685), _Examen poeticum_\r\n(1693), _The Annual Miscellany_ (1694 by the \"most eminent hands\"); in\r\n1693 was published the verse translation of the _Satires_ of Juvenal and\r\nof Persius by \"Mr Dryden and several other eminent hands,\" which\r\ncontained his \"Discourse concerning the Original and Progress of\r\nSatire\"; and in 1697 Jacob Tonson published his most important\r\ntranslation, _The Works of Virgil_. The book, which was the result of\r\nthree years' labour, was a vigorous, rather than a close, rendering of\r\nVirgil into the style of Dryden. Among other notable poems of this\r\nperiod are the two \"Songs for St Cecilia's Day,\" written for a London\r\nmusical society for 1687 and 1697, and published separately. The second\r\nof these is the famous ode on \"Alexander's Feast.\" The well-known\r\nparaphrase of _Veni, Creator Spiritus_ was posthumously printed, and his\r\n\"Ode to the memory of Anne Killigrew,\" called by Dr Johnson the noblest\r\node in the language, was written in 1686.\r\n\r\nHis next work was to render some of Chaucer's and Boccaccio's tales and\r\nOvid's _Metamorphoses_ into his own verse. These translations appeared\r\nin November 1699, a few months before his death, and are known by the\r\ntitle of _Fables, Ancient and Modern_. The preface, which is an\r\nadmirable example of Dryden's prose, contains an excellent appreciation\r\nof Chaucer, and, incidentally, an answer to Jeremy Collier's attack on\r\nthe stage. Thus a large portion of the closing years of Dryden's life\r\nwas spent in translating for bread. He had a windfall of 500 guineas\r\nfrom Lord Abingdon for a poem on the death of his wife in 1691, and he\r\nreceived liberal presents from his cousin John Driden and from the duke\r\nof Ormonde, but generally he was in considerable pecuniary straits.\r\nBesides, his three sons held various posts in the service of the pope at\r\nRome, and he could not well be on good terms with both courts. However,\r\nhe was not molested in London by the government, and in private he was\r\ntreated with the respect due to his old age and his admitted position as\r\nthe greatest of living English poets. He held a small court at Wills's\r\ncoffee-house, where he spent his evenings; here he had a chair by the\r\nfire in winter and by the window in summer; Congreve, Vanbrugh and\r\nAddison were among his admirers, and here Pope saw the old poet of whom\r\nhe was to be the most brilliant disciple. He died at his house in\r\nGerrard Street, London, on the 1st of May 1700 and was buried on the\r\n13th of the month in Westminster Abbey. Dryden's portrait, by Sir G.\r\nKneller, is in the National Portrait Gallery.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_The Comedies, Tragedies and Operas written by John\r\n  Dryden, Esq._ (2 vols., 1701) was published by Tonson, who also issued\r\n  the poet's _Dramatick Works_ (6 vols., 1717), edited by Congreve.\r\n  _Poems on Various Occasions and Translations from Several Authors_\r\n  (1701), also published by Tonson, was very incomplete, and although\r\n  other editions followed there was no satisfactory collection until the\r\n  edition of the _Works_ (18 vols., 1808, 2nd ed. 1821) by Sir Walter\r\n  Scott, who supplied historical and critical notes with a life of the\r\n  author. This, as revised and corrected by G. Saintsbury (18 vols.,\r\n  Edinburgh, 1882-1893), remains the standard edition. _His Critical and\r\n  Miscellaneous Prose Works_ (4 vols., 1800) were edited by Edmund\r\n  Malone, who collected industriously the materials for a life of\r\n  Dryden.

[Greek: drys], oak, [Greek: pithêkos], ape, \"the ape\r\nof the oak-woods\"), the name of an extinct ape or monkey from Miocene\r\ndeposits of France, believed to be allied to the baboons, but perhaps\r\nwith some affinity to the higher apes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRY ROT, a fungoid disease in timber which occasions the destruction of\r\nits fibres, and reduces it eventually to a mass of dry dust. It is\r\nproduced most readily in a warm, moist, stagnant atmosphere, while\r\ncommon or wet rot is the result of the exposure of wood to repeated\r\nchanges of climatic conditions. The most formidable of the dry rot fungi\r\nis the species _Merulius lacrymans_, which is particularly destructive\r\nof coniferous wood; other species are _Polyporus hybridus_, which\r\nthrives in oak-built ships, and _P. destructor_ and _Thelephora\r\nputeana_, found in a variety of wooden structures.\r\n\r\nThe felling of trees when void of fresh sap, as a means of obviating the\r\nrotting of timber, is a practice of very ancient origin. Vitruvius\r\ndirects (ii. cap. 9) that, to secure good timber, trees should be cut to\r\nthe pith, so as to allow of the escape of their sap, which by dying in\r\nthe wood would injure its quality; also that felling should take place\r\nonly from early autumn until the end of winter. The supposed superior\r\nquality of wood cut in winter, and the early practice in England of\r\nfelling oak timber at that season, may be inferred from a statute of\r\nJames I., which enacted \"that no person or persons shall fell, or cause\r\nto be felled, any oaken trees meet to be barked, when bark is worth 2s.\r\na cart-load (timber for the needful building and reparation of houses,\r\nships or mills only excepted), but between the first day of April and\r\nlast day of June, not even for the king's use, out of barking time,\r\nexcept for building or repairing his Majesty's houses or ships.\" In\r\ngiving testimony before a committee of the House of Commons in March\r\n1771, Mr Barnard of Deptford expressed it as his opinion that to secure\r\ndurable timber for shipbuilding, trees should be barked in spring and\r\nnot felled till the succeeding winter. In France, so long ago as 1669, a\r\nroyal decree limited the felling of timber from the 1st of October to\r\nthe 15th of April; and, in an order issued to the commissioners of\r\nforests, Napoleon I. directed that the felling of naval timber should\r\ntake place only from November 1 to March 15, and during the decrease of\r\nthe moon, on account of the rapid decay of timber, through the\r\nfermentation of its sap, if cut at other seasons. The burying of wood in\r\nwater, which dissolves out or alters its putrescible constituents, has\r\nlong been practised as a means of seasoning. The old \"Resistance\"\r\nfrigate, which went down in Malta harbour, remained under water for some\r\nmonths, and on being raised was found to be entirely freed from the dry\r\nrot fungus that had previously covered her; similarly, in the ship\r\n\"Eden,\" the progress of rot was completely arrested by 18 months'\r\nsubmergence in Plymouth Sound, so that after remaining a year at home in\r\nexcellent condition she was sent out to the East Indies. It was an\r\nancient practice in England to place timber for thrashing-floors and oak\r\nplanks for wainscotting in running water to season them. Whale and other\r\noils have been recommended for the preservation of wood; and in 1737 a\r\npatent for the employment of hot oil was taken out by a Mr Emerson.\r\n\r\n  For the modern processes of preserving timber see TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUALISM (from rare Lat. _dualis_, containing two, from _duo_), a\r\nphilosophical term applied to all theories which attempt to explain\r\nfacts by reference to two coexistent principles. The term plays an\r\nimportant part in metaphysical, ethical and theological speculation.\r\n\r\n_In Metaphysics._--Metaphysical dualism postulates the eternal\r\ncoexistence of mind and matter, as opposed to monism both idealistic and\r\nmaterialistic. Two forms of this dualism are held. On the one hand it is\r\nsaid that mind and matter are absolutely heterogeneous, and, therefore,\r\nthat any causal relation between them is _ex hypothesi_ impossible. On\r\nthe other hand is a hypothetical dualism, according to which it is held\r\nthat mind cannot bridge over the chasm so far as to _know_ matter _in\r\nitself_, though it is compelled by its own laws of cause and effect to\r\npostulate matter as the origin, if not the motive cause, of its\r\nsensations. It follows that, for the thinking mind, matter is a\r\nnecessary hypothesis. Hence the theory is a kind of monism, inasmuch as\r\nit confessedly does not assert the existence of matter save as an\r\nintellectual postulate for the thinking mind. Matter, in other words,\r\nmust be assumed to exist, though mind cannot know it _in itself_. From\r\nthis question there emerges a second and more difficult problem.\r\nConsciousness, it is held, is of two main kinds, sensation and reason.\r\nSensation alone is insufficient to explain all our intellectual\r\nphenomena; all sensation is momentary and individual (cf. Empiricism).\r\nHow then are we to account for memory and the principles of necessity,\r\nsimilarity, universality? It is argued that there must be in the mind an\r\nenduring, primary faculty whereby we retain, compare and group the\r\npresentations of sense. This faculty is _a priori_, transcendental, and\r\nentirely separate from all the data of experience and sense-perception.\r\nHere then we have a dualism within experience. The mind is not to be\r\nregarded as a sensitized film which automatically records the\r\nimpressions of the senses. It contains within itself this modifying\r\ncritical faculty which reacts upon and arranges the sense-given\r\npresentations.\r\n\r\n_In Ethics and Theology._--In the domain of morals, dualism postulates\r\nthe separate existence of Good and Evil, as principles of existence. In\r\ntheology the appearance of dualism is sporadic and has not the\r\nfundamental, determining importance which it has in metaphysics. It is a\r\nresult rather than a starting-point. The old Zoroastrianism, and those\r\nChristian sects (e.g. Manichaeism) which were influenced by it,\r\npostulate two contending deities Ormuzd and Ahriman (Good and Evil),\r\nwhich war against one another in influencing the conduct of men. So, in\r\nChristianity, the existence of Satan as an evil influence, antagonistic\r\nto God, involves a kind of dualism. But generally speaking this dualism\r\nis permissive, inasmuch as it is always held that God will triumph over\r\nSatan in His own time. So in Zoroastrianism the dualism is not ultimate,\r\nfor Ahriman and Ormuzd are represented as the twin sons of Zervana\r\nAkarana, i.e. limitless time, wherein both will be finally absorbed. The\r\npostulate of an Evil Being arises from the difficulty, at all times\r\nacutely felt by a certain type of mind, of reconciling the existence of\r\nevil with the divine attributes of perfect goodness, full knowledge and\r\ninfinite power. John Stuart Mill (_Essay on Religion_) preferred to\r\ndisbelieve in the omnipotence of God rather than forgo the belief in His\r\ngoodness. It follows from such a view that Satan is not the creation of\r\nGod, but rather a power coeval in origin, over whose activity God has no\r\nabsolute control.\r\n\r\n_In Theology._--Dualism is also used in a special theological sense to\r\ndescribe a doctrine of the Nestorian heresy. According to this doctrine\r\nthe personality of Christ is twofold; the divine Logos dwells as a\r\ndistinct personality in the man Jesus Christ, the union of the two\r\nnatures being analogous to the relation between the believer and the\r\nindwelling Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n_History of the Doctrine._--The earliest European thinkers (see IONIAN\r\nSCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY) endeavoured to reduce all the facts of the\r\nuniverse to a single material origin, such as Fire, Water, Air. It is\r\nonly gradually that there appears any recognition of a spiritual\r\nprinciple exercising a modifying or causal influence over inert matter.\r\nAnaxagoras was the first to postulate the existence of Reason ([Greek:\r\nnous]) as the source of change and progress. Yet even he did not\r\nconceive this Reason as incorporeal; it was in reality only the most\r\nhighly rarefied form of matter in existence. In Plato for the first time\r\nwe find a truly dualistic conception of the universe. Asserting that\r\nIdeas alone really exist, he yet found it necessary to postulate a\r\nsecond principle of not-being, the groundwork of sensuous existence and\r\nof imperfection and evil. Herein he identified metaphysics and ethics,\r\ncombining the good with the truly existent and evil with the\r\nnon-existent. Aristotle rebels against this conception and substitutes\r\nthe idea of [Greek: prôtê hylê] and development. Nevertheless he does\r\nnot escape from the dualism of Form and Matter, [Greek: nous] and\r\n[Greek: hylê]. The scholastic philosophers naturally held dualistic\r\nviews resulting from their extreme devotion to formalism. This blind\r\ndualism found its natural consequence in the revolt of the Renaissance\r\nthinkers, Bruno and Paracelsus, who asserted the unity of mind and\r\nmatter in all existence and were the precursors of the more intelligent\r\nmonism of Leibnitz and the scientific metaphysics of his successors. The\r\nbirth of modern physical science on the other hand in the investigations\r\nof Bacon and Descartes obscured the metaphysical issue by the\r\npredominance of the mechanical principles of natural philosophy. They\r\nattempted to explain the fundamental problems of existence by the\r\nunaided evidence of the new natural science. Thus Descartes maintained\r\nthe absolute dualism of the _res cogitans_ and the _res extensa_.\r\nSpinoza realized the flaw in the division and preferred to postulate\r\nbehind mind and matter a single substance (_unica substantia_) while\r\nLeibnitz explained the universe as a harmony of spiritual or\r\nsemispiritual principles. Kant practically abandons the problem. He\r\nnever really establishes a relation between pure reason and\r\nthings-in-themselves (_Dinge an sich_), but rather seeks refuge in a\r\ndualism within consciousness, the transcendental and the empirical.\r\nSince Kant there are, therefore, two streams of dualism, dealing, one\r\nwith the radical problem of the relation between mind and matter, the\r\nother with the relation between the pure rational and the empirical\r\nelements within consciousness. To the first problem there is one obvious\r\nand conclusive answer, namely that matter in itself is inherently\r\nunthinkable and comes within the vision of the mind only as an\r\nintellectual presentation. It follows that philosophy is in a sense both\r\ndualist and monist; it is a cosmic dualism inasmuch as it admits the\r\npossible existence of matter as a hypothesis, though it denies the\r\npossibility of any true knowledge of it, and is hence in regard of the\r\nonly possible knowledge an idealistic monism. It is a self-destructive\r\ndualism, a confessedly one-sided monism, agnostic as to the fundamental\r\nproblem. To the second problem there are two main answers, that of\r\nAssociationism which denies to the mind any _a priori_ existence and\r\nasserts that sensation is the only source of knowledge, and that which\r\nadmits the existence of both transcendental and empirical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUALLA, one of the principal negro peoples of Cameroon estuary, West\r\nAfrica. When the Germans established themselves in that region, the\r\nDualla were under many petty chiefs, whose domains were usually\r\nrestricted to one village. Over these were two greater chiefs, Bell\r\n(Mbeli) and Akwa, representing the principal families of the tribe. The\r\nDualla are physically a fine race. They are proud of their racial\r\npurity, and it was formerly usual for all half-caste children to be\r\nstrangled at birth. The Dualla tattoo themselves, the women the whole\r\nbody, the men the face only. They also pull out their eyelashes, which\r\nthey believe prevent sharp sight. The monarchical system is more\r\ndeveloped among the Dualla than any other of the peoples of Cameroon.\r\nThe kings, many of whom have grown rich through trade, retain part of\r\ntheir former power, subject to the German government. The Dualla, who\r\nare laborious, industrious and capable of great physical endurance, are\r\ngreat traders and are proportionately prosperous. The average price for\r\na wife among the Dualla is from £90 to £120; but sometimes a great deal\r\nmore is paid. Girls are usually betrothed young and may be divorced if\r\nsterile. The penalty for adultery is a fine imposed on the seducer; if\r\nhe cannot pay he becomes the husband's slave. Cannibalism as a religious\r\nrite was formerly common among the Dualla. All accessions to power were\r\npreceded by a sacrifice, a king having no authority till his hands were\r\nstained with blood. The religion is fetish blended with\r\nancestor-worship, and certain secret societies exist among them which\r\nseem to have a religious connexion. The dead are buried within the hut,\r\nwhich is abandoned shortly afterwards; slaves were formerly buried with\r\nmen of importance. Missionary efforts have yielded many converts, and\r\nsome churches have been built. Many of the natives can read. The Dualla\r\nare in possession of an interesting code, in accordance with which\r\nmessages can be sent and even conversations maintained by means of\r\ndrums, or rather gongs, giving two notes. (See CAMEROON.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU BARRY, MARIE JEANNE BÉCU, Comtesse (1746-1793), French adventuress,\r\nmistress of Louis XV., was the natural daughter of a poor woman of\r\nVaucouleurs, and was born there on the 19th of August 1746. Placed in a\r\nconvent in Paris at an early age, she received a very slight education,\r\nlearning little but the catechism and drawing; and at the age of sixteen\r\nentered a milliner's shop in the rue St Honoré. Subsequently she lived\r\nas a courtesan under the name of Mdlle Lange. Her great personal charms\r\nled the adventurer Jean, comte du Barry, to take her into his house in\r\norder to make it more attractive to the dupes whose money he won by\r\ngambling. Her success surpassing his expectations, his hopes took a\r\nhigher flight, and through Lebel, valet de chambre of Louis XV., and the\r\nduc de Richelieu, he succeeded in installing her as mistress of the\r\nking. In order to present her at court it was necessary to find a title\r\nfor her, and as Count Jean du Barry was married himself his brother\r\nGuillaume offered himself as nominal husband. The comtesse du Barry was\r\npresented at court on the 22nd of April 1769, and became official\r\nmistress of the king. Her influence over the monarch was absolute until\r\nhis death, and courtiers and ministers were in favour or disgrace with\r\nhim in exact accordance with her wishes. The duc de Choiseul, who\r\nrefused to acknowledge her, was disgraced in 1771; and the duc\r\nd'Aiguillon, who had the reputation of being her lover, took his place,\r\nand in concert with her governed the monarch. Louis XV. built for her\r\nthe magnificent mansion of Luciennes. At his death in 1774 an order of\r\nhis successor banished her to the abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux,\r\nbut, the queen interceding for her, the king in the following year gave\r\nher permission to reside at Luciennes with a pension. Here she led a\r\nretired life with the comte de Cossé-Brissac, and was visited there by\r\nBenjamin Franklin and the emperor Joseph II., among many other\r\ndistinguished men. Having gone to England in 1792 to endeavour to raise\r\nmoney on her jewels, she was on her return accused before the\r\nRevolutionary Tribunal of having dissipated the treasures of the state,\r\nconspired against the republic, and worn, in London, \"mourning for the\r\ntyrant.\" She was condemned to death on the 7th of December 1793, and\r\nbeheaded the same evening. Her contemporaries, scorning her low birth\r\nrather than her vices, attributed to her a malicious political rôle of\r\nwhich she was at heart incapable, and have done scant justice to her\r\nquick wit, her frank but gracious manners, and her seductive beauty. The\r\nvolume of _Lettres et Anecdotes_ (1779) which bears her name was not\r\nwritten by her.\r\n\r\n  See E. and J. de Goncourt, _La du Barry_ (Paris, 1880); C. Vatel,\r\n  _Histoire de Madame du Barry_ (1882-1883), based on sources; R.\r\n  Douglas, _The Life and Times of Madame du Barry_ (London, 1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU BARTAS, GUILLAUME DE SALUSTE, SEIGNEUR (1544-1590), French poet, was\r\nborn near Auch in 1544. He was employed by Henry IV. of France in\r\nEngland, Denmark and Scotland; and he commanded a troop of horse in\r\nGascony, under the marshal de Martingan. He was a convinced Huguenot,\r\nand cherished the idea of writing a great religious epic in which\r\nbiblical characters and Christian sentiment were to supplant the pagan\r\n_mise en scène_ then in fashion. His first epic, _Judith_, appeared in a\r\nvolume entitled _La Muse chrétienne_ (Bordeaux, 1573). This was followed\r\nfive years later by his principal work, _La Sepmaine_, a poem on the\r\ncreation of the world. This work was held by admirers of du Bartas to\r\nput him on a level with Ronsard, and thirty editions of it were printed\r\nwithin six years after its appearance. Its religious tone and fanciful\r\nstyle made it a great favourite in England, where the author was called\r\nthe \"divine\" du Bartas, and placed on an equality with Ariosto. Spenser,\r\nHall and Ben Jonson, all speak in the highest terms of what seems to us\r\na most uninteresting poem. King James VI. of Scotland tried his\r\n\"prentice hand\" at the translation of du Bartas's poem _L'Uranie_, and\r\nthe compliment was returned by the French writer, who translated, as _La\r\nLepanthe_, James's poem on the battle of Lepanto. Du Bartas began the\r\npublication of the _Seconde Semaine_ in 1584. He aimed at a great epic\r\nwhich should stretch from the story of the creation to the coming of the\r\nMessiah. Of this great scheme he only executed a part, marked by a\r\ncertain elevation of style, but he did not succeed in acclimatizing the\r\nreligious epic in France. The work is spoiled by a constant tendency to\r\nmoralize, and is filled with the indiscriminate information that passed\r\nunder the name of science in the 16th century. Du Bartas, perhaps more\r\nthan any other writer, brought the Ronsardist tradition into dispute. He\r\nintroduced many unwieldy compounds foreign to the genius of the French\r\nlanguage, and in his borrowings from old French, from provincial\r\ndialects and from Latin, he failed to show the sure instinct and\r\nprudence of Ronsard and du Bellay. He was also guilty of reduplicating\r\nthe first syllables of words, producing such expressions as\r\n_pépétiller_, _sousouflantes_. Du Bartas died in July 1590 in Paris from\r\nwounds received at the battle of Ivry.\r\n\r\n  Joshua Sylvester translated the _Sepmaine_ in 1598; other English\r\n  translations from du Bartas are _The Historie of Judith ..._ (1584),\r\n  by Thomas Hudson; of portions of the \"Weeks\" (1625) by William Lisle\r\n  (1569-1637), the Anglo-Saxon scholar; _Urania_ (1589), by Robert\r\n  Ashley (1565-1641); and Sir Philip Sidney (see Florio's dedication of\r\n  the second book of his translation of Montaigne to Lady Rich) wrote a\r\n  translation of the first \"Week,\" which is lost. The _OEuvres\r\n  complètes_ of du Bartas were printed at Paris (1579), Paris and\r\n  Bordeaux (1611). See also G. Pellissier, _La Vie et les oeuvres de du\r\n  Bartas_ (1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBAWNT, or DOOBAUNT (Indian _Toobaung_, i.e. turbid), a river of\r\nMackenzie and Keewatin districts, Canada. It rises in Wholdaia (or Daly)\r\nLake, in 104° 20' W. and 60° 15' N., and flows northward to its\r\nconfluence with the Thelon river, and thence eastward to Chesterfield\r\nInlet, an arm of Hudson Bay. It passes through numerous lake-expansions,\r\nincluding Dubawnt Lake, with an area of 1700 sq. m. and an altitude of\r\n500 ft. above the sea; Aberdeen, altitude 130 ft.; and Baker, 30 ft.\r\nFrom the head of Wholdaia Lake to the head of Chesterfield Inlet is 750\r\nm. and thence to the west coast of Hudson Bay 125 m. The river is\r\nshallow, and banks and bed are chiefly composed of boulders; grassy\r\nslopes, however, occur at intervals along its banks, especially on the\r\nshores of Dubawnt Lake, and are the feeding grounds of large bands of\r\ncariboo. Discovered in 1770 by Samuel Hearne, the Dubawnt was explored\r\nby J. B. Tyrrell in 1893, and the Thelon by David Hanbury in 1899.\r\n\r\n  See Annual Report of the Geological Survey of Canada for 1896 (printed\r\n  1898).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBBO, a municipal town of Lincoln county, New South Wales, Australia,\r\non the Macquarie river, 278 m. by rail N.W. of Sydney. Pop. (1901) 3409.\r\nIt is a flourishing manufacturing town in a pastoral district, in part\r\nalso cultivated. Coal and copper are found in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU BELLAY, GUILLAUME, SIEUR DE LANGEY (1491-1543), French soldier and\r\ndiplomat, was born at the château of Glatigny, near Montmirail, in 1491.\r\nHis father, Louis du Bellay-Langey was a younger son of the Angevin\r\nfamily of du Bellay, which from the 14th century was distinguished in\r\nthe service of the dukes of Anjou and afterwards of the kings of France;\r\nand Louis had six sons, who were among the best servants of Francis I.\r\nGuillaume, the eldest, is one of the most remarkable figures of the\r\ntime; a brave soldier, a humanist and a historian, he was above all the\r\nmost able diplomat at the command of Francis I., prodigiously active,\r\nand excelling in secret negotiations. He entered the military service at\r\nan early age, was taken prisoner at Pavia (1525) and shared the\r\ncaptivity of Francis I. His skill and devotion attached him to the king.\r\nHis missions to Spain, Italy, England and Germany were innumerable; sent\r\nthree times to England in 1529-1530, he was occupied with the execution\r\nof the treaty of Cambrai and also with the question of Henry VIII.'s\r\ndivorce, and with the help of his brother Jean, then bishop of Paris, he\r\nobtained a decision favourable to Henry VIII. from the Sorbonne (July 2,\r\n1530). From 1532 to 1536, though he went three times to England, he was\r\nprincipally employed in uniting the German princes against Charles V.;\r\nin May 1532 he signed the treaty of Scheyern with the dukes of Bavaria,\r\nthe landgrave of Hesse, and the elector of Saxony, and in January 1534\r\nthe treaty of Augsburg. During the war of 1537 Francis I. sent him on\r\nmissions to Piedmont; he was governor of Turin from December 1537 till\r\nthe end of 1539, and subsequently replacing Marshal d'Annebaut as\r\ngovernor of the whole of Piedmont, he displayed great capacity in\r\norganization. But at the end of 1542, overwhelmed by work, he was\r\ncompelled to return to France, and died near Lyons on the 9th of January\r\n1543. Rabelais, an eye-witness, has left a moving story of his death\r\n(_Pantagruel_, iii. ch. 21, and iv. ch. 27). He was buried in the\r\ncathedral of Le Mans, where a monument was erected to his memory, with\r\nthe inscription, \"Ci gît Langey, dont la plume et l'épée Ont surmonté\r\nCicéron et Pompée\"; Charles V. is said to have remarked that Langey, by\r\nhis own unaided efforts, did more mischief and thwarted more schemes\r\nthan all the French together.\r\n\r\nGuillaume du Bellay was the devoted protector of freedom of thought;\r\nwithout actually joining the reformers, he defended the innovators\r\nagainst their fanatical opponents. In 1534-1535 he even tried,\r\nunsuccessfully, to bring about a meeting between Francis I. and\r\nMelanchthon; and in 1541 he intervened in favour of the Vaudois.\r\nRabelais was the most famous of his clients, and followed him to\r\nPiedmont from 1540 to 1542. Guillaume was himself a valuable historian,\r\nand a clear and precise writer. He imitated Livy in his _Ogdoades_, a\r\nhistory of the rivalry between Francis I. and the emperor from 1521, of\r\nwhich, though he had no time to finish it, important fragments remain,\r\ninserted by his brother Martin du Bellay (d. 1559) in his _Mémoires_\r\n(1569). The celebrated _Instructions_, reprinted as _Traité de la\r\ndiscipline militaire_ in 1554 and 1592, was formerly attributed to him,\r\nbut it has been proved that he could not have written it (see Bayle,\r\n_Dict. Hist._ i. 502, and Jähns, _Geschichte der Kriegswissenschaften_,\r\ni. 498 seq.); this work, however, is of the highest value for the study\r\nof the military art of the 16th century; in 1550 an Italian, in 1567 a\r\nSpanish, and in 1594 and 1619 German translations were published.\r\n\r\n  See also the edition of Martin du Bellay's _Mémoires_ by Michaud and\r\n  Poujoulat (1838), and Bourrilly's _Fragments de la première Ogdoade_\r\n  (Paris, 1905). There is an excellent study of Guillaume du Bellay by\r\n  V. L. Bourrilly (Paris, 1905).     (J. I.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU BELLAY, JEAN (c. 1493-1560), French cardinal and diplomat, younger\r\nbrother of Guillaume du Bellay, appears as bishop of Bayonne in 1526,\r\nmember of the privy council in 1530, and bishop of Paris in 1532. Supple\r\nand clever, he was well fitted for a diplomatic career, and carried out\r\nseveral missions in England (1527-1534) and Rome (1534-1536). In 1535 he\r\nreceived his cardinal's hat; in 1536-1537 he was nominated\r\n\"lieutenant-general\" to the king at Paris and in the Île de France, and\r\nwas entrusted with the organization of the defence against the\r\nimperialists. When Guillaume du Bellay went to Piedmont, Jean was put in\r\ncharge of the negotiations with the German Protestants, principally\r\nthrough the humanist Johann Sturm and the historian Johann Sleidan. In\r\nthe last years of the reign of Francis I., cardinal du Bellay was in\r\nfavour with the duchesse d'Étampes, and received a number of\r\nbenefices--the bishopric of Limoges (1541), archbishopric of Bordeaux\r\n(1544), bishopric of Le Mans (1546); but his influence in the council\r\nwas supplanted by that of Cardinal de Tournon. Under Henry II., being\r\ninvolved in the disgrace of all the servants of Francis I., he was sent\r\nto Rome (1547), and he obtained eight votes in the conclave which\r\nfollowed the death of Pope Paul III. After three quiet years passed in\r\nretirement in France (1550-1553), he was charged with a new mission to\r\nPope Julius III. and took with him to Rome his young cousin the poet\r\nJoachim du Bellay (q.v.). He lived in Rome thenceforth in great state.\r\nIn 1555 he was nominated bishop of Ostia and dean of the Sacred College,\r\nan appointment which was disapproved of by Henry II. and brought him\r\ninto fresh disgrace, lasting till his death in Rome on the 16th of\r\nFebruary 1560. Less resolute and reliable than his brother Guillaume,\r\nthe cardinal had brilliant qualities, and an open and free mind. He was\r\non the side of toleration and protected the reformers. Budaeus was his\r\nfriend, Rabelais his faithful secretary and doctor; men of letters, like\r\nÉtienne Dolet, and the poet Salmon Macrin, were indebted to him for\r\nassistance. An orator and writer of Latin verse, he left three books of\r\ngraceful Latin poems (printed with Salmon Macrin's _Odes_, 1546, by R.\r\nEstienne), and some other compositions, including _Francisci Francorum\r\nregis epistola apologetica_ (1542). His voluminous correspondence,\r\nmostly in MS., is remarkable for its _verve_ and picturesque quality.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris has numerous\r\n  unpublished letters of Jean du Bellay.

(J. I.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU BELLAY, JOACHIM (c. 1522-1560), French poet and critic, member of the\r\nPléiade, was born[1] at the château of La Turmelière, not far from Liré,\r\nnear Angers, being the son of Jean du Bellay, seigneur de Gonnor,\r\ncousin-german of the cardinal Jean du Bellay and of Guillaume du Bellay.\r\nBoth his parents died while he was still a child, and he was left to the\r\nguardianship of his elder brother, René du Bellay, who neglected his\r\neducation, leaving him to run wild at La Turmelière. When he was\r\ntwenty-three, however, he received permission to go to Poitiers to study\r\nlaw, no doubt with a view to his obtaining perferment through his\r\nkinsman the Cardinal Jean du Bellay. At Poitiers he came in contact with\r\nthe humanist Marc Antoine Muret, and with Jean Salmon Macrin\r\n(1490-1557), a Latin poet famous in his day. There too he probably met\r\nJacques Peletier du Mans, who had published a translation of the _Ars\r\npoëtica_ of Horace, with a preface in which much of the programme\r\nadvocated later by the Pléiade is to be found in outline.\r\n\r\nIt was probably in 1547 that du Bellay met Ronsard in an inn on the way\r\nto Poitiers, an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point\r\nof the French school of Renaissance poetry. The two had much in common,\r\nand immediately became fast friends. Du Bellay returned with Ronsard to\r\nParis to join the circle of students of the humanities attached to Jean\r\nDaurat (q.v.) at the Collège de Coqueret. While Ronsard and Antoine de\r\nBaïf were most influenced by Greek models, du Bellay was more especially\r\na Latinist, and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly\r\nconnected with his own had some part in determining the more national\r\nand familiar note of his poetry. In 1548 appeared the _Art poétique_ of\r\nThomas Sibilet, who enunciated many of the ideas that Ronsard and his\r\nfollowers had at heart, though with essential differences in the point\r\nof view, since he held up as models Clément Marot and his disciples.\r\nRonsard and his friends dissented violently from Sibilet on this and\r\nother points, and they doubtless felt a natural resentment at finding\r\ntheir ideas forestalled and, moreover, inadequately presented. The\r\nfamous manifesto of the Pléiade, the _Deffence et illustration de la\r\nlangue françoyse_ (1549), was at once a complement and a refutation of\r\nSibilet's treatise. This book was the expression of the literary\r\nprinciples of the Pléiade as a whole, but although Ronsard was the\r\nchosen leader, its redaction was entrusted to du Bellay. To obtain a\r\nclear view of the reforms aimed at by the Pléiade, the _Deffence_ should\r\nbe further considered in connexion with Ronsard's _Abrégé d'art\r\npoétique_ and his preface to the _Franciade_. Du Bellay maintained that\r\nthe French language as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as\r\na medium for the higher forms of poetry, but he contended that by proper\r\ncultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical tongues.\r\nHe condemned those who despaired of their mother tongue, and used Latin\r\nfor their more serious and ambitious work. For translations from the\r\nancients he would substitute imitations. Not only were the forms of\r\nclassical poetry to be imitated, but a separate poetic language and\r\nstyle, distinct from those employed in prose, were to be used. The\r\nFrench language was to be enriched by a development of its internal\r\nresources and by discreet borrowing from the Latin and Greek. Both du\r\nBellay and Ronsard laid stress on the necessity of prudence in these\r\nborrowings, and both repudiated the charge of wishing to latinize their\r\nmother tongue. The book was a spirited defence of poetry and of the\r\npossibilities of the French language; it was also a declaration of war\r\non those writers who held less heroic views.\r\n\r\nThe violent attacks made by du Bellay on Marot and his followers, and on\r\nSibilet, did not go unanswered. Sibilet replied in the preface to his\r\ntranslation (1549) of the _Iphigenia_ of Euripides; Guillaume des\r\nAutels, a Lyonnese poet, reproached du Bellay with ingratitude to his\r\npredecessors, and showed the weakness of his argument for imitation as\r\nopposed to translation in a digression in his _Réplique aux furieuses\r\ndéfenses de Louis Meigret_ (Lyons, 1550); Barthélemy Aneau, regent of\r\nthe Collège de la Trinité at Lyons, attacked him in his _Quintil\r\nHoratian_ (Lyons, 1551), the authorship of which was commonly attributed\r\nto Charles Fontaine. Aneau pointed out the obvious inconsistency of\r\ninculcating imitation of the ancients and depreciating native poets in a\r\nwork professing to be a defence of the French language. Du Bellay\r\nreplied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition\r\n(1550) of his sonnet sequence _Olive_, with which he also published two\r\npolemical poems, the _Musagnaeomachie_, and an ode addressed to Ronsard,\r\n_Contre les envieux poètes_. _Olive_, a collection of love-sonnets\r\nwritten in close imitation of Petrarch, first appeared in 1549. With it\r\nwere printed thirteen odes entitled _Vers lyriques_. Olive has been\r\nsupposed to be an anagram for the name of a Mlle Viole, but there is\r\nlittle evidence of real passion in the poems, and they may perhaps be\r\nregarded as a Petrarcan exercise, especially as, in the second edition,\r\nthe dedication to his lady is exchanged for one to Marguerite de Valois,\r\nsister of Henry II. Du Bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into\r\nFrench poetry, but he acclimatized it; and when the fashion of\r\nsonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its\r\nexcesses.\r\n\r\nAbout this time du Bellay had a serious illness of two years' duration,\r\nfrom which dates the beginning of his deafness. He had further anxieties\r\nin the guardianship of his nephew. The boy died in 1553, and Joachim,\r\nwho had up to this time borne the title of sieur de Liré, became\r\nseigneur of Gonnor. In 1549 he had published a _Recueil de poësies_\r\ndedicated to the Princess Marguerite. This was followed in 1552 by a\r\nversion of the fourth book of the _Aeneid_, with other translations and\r\nsome occasional poems. In the next year he went to Rome as one of the\r\nsecretaries of Cardinal du Bellay. To the beginning of his four and a\r\nhalf years' residence in Italy belong the forty-seven sonnets of his\r\n_Antiquités de Rome_, which were rendered into English by Edmund Spenser\r\n(_The Ruins of Rome_, 1591). These sonnets were more personal and less\r\nimitative than the _Olive_ sequence, and struck a note which was revived\r\nin later French literature by Volney and Chateaubriand. His stay in Rome\r\nwas, however, a real exile. His duties were those of an intendant. He\r\nhad to meet the cardinal's creditors and to find money for the expenses\r\nof the household. Nevertheless he found many friends among Italian\r\nscholars, and formed a close friendship with another exiled poet whose\r\ncircumstances were similar to his own, Olivier de Magny. Towards the end\r\nof his sojourn in Rome he fell violently in love with a Roman lady\r\ncalled Faustine, who appears in his poetry as Columba and Columbelle.\r\nThis passion finds its clearest expression in the Latin poems. Faustine\r\nwas guarded by an old and jealous husband, and du Bellay's eventual\r\nconquest may have had something to do with his departure for Paris at\r\nthe end of August 1557. In the next year he published the poems he had\r\nbrought back with him from Rome, the Latin _Poemata_, the _Antiquités de\r\nRome_, the _Jeux rustiques_, and the 191 sonnets of the _Regrets_, the\r\ngreater number of which were written in Italy. The _Regrets_ show that\r\nhe had advanced far beyond the theories of the _Deffence_. The\r\nsimplicity and tenderness specially characteristic of du Bellay appear\r\nin the sonnets telling of his unlucky passion for Faustine, and of his\r\nnostalgia for the banks of the Loire. Among them are some satirical\r\nsonnets describing Roman manners, and the later ones written after his\r\nreturn to Paris are often appeals for patronage. His intimate relations\r\nwith Ronsard were not renewed; but he formed a close friendship with the\r\nscholar Jean de Morel, whose house was the centre of a learned society.\r\nIn 1559 du Bellay published at Poitiers _La Nouvelle Manière de faire\r\nson profit des lettres_, a satirical epistle translated from the Latin\r\nof Adrien Turnèbe, and with it _Le Poète courtisan_, which introduced\r\nthe formal satire into French poetry. These were published under the\r\npseudonym of J. Quintil du Troussay, and the courtier-poet was generally\r\nsupposed to be Melin de Saint-Gelais, with whom du Bellay had always,\r\nhowever, been on friendly terms.\r\n\r\nA long and eloquent _Discours au roi_ (detailing the duties of a prince,\r\nand translated from a Latin original written by Michel de l'Hôpital, now\r\nlost) was dedicated to Francis II. in 1559, and is said to have secured\r\nfor the poet a tardy pension. In Paris he was still in the employ of\r\nthe cardinal, who delegated to him the lay patronage which he still\r\nretained in the diocese. In the exercise of these functions Joachim\r\nquarrelled with Eustache du Bellay, bishop of Paris, who prejudiced his\r\nrelations with the cardinal, less cordial since the publication of the\r\noutspoken _Regrets_. His chief patron, Marguerite de Valois, to whom he\r\nwas sincerely attached, had gone to Savoy. Du Bellay's health was weak;\r\nhis deafness seriously hindered his official duties; and on the 1st of\r\nJanuary 1560 he died. There is no evidence that he was in priest's\r\norders, but he was a clerk, and as such held various preferments. He had\r\nat one time been a canon of Notre Dame of Paris, and was accordingly\r\nburied in the cathedral. The statement that he was nominated archbishop\r\nof Bordeaux during the last year of life is unauthenticated by\r\ndocumentary evidence and is in itself extremely improbable.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The best edition of the works of J. du Bellay is\r\n  _OEuvres françaises_ (2 vols., 1866-1867), edited with introduction\r\n  and notes by C. Marty-Laveaux in his _Pléiade française_. His _OEuvres\r\n  choisies_ were published by L. Becq de Fouquières in 1876. The chief\r\n  source of his biography is his own poetry, especially the Latin elegy\r\n  addressed to Jean de Morel, \"_Elegia ad Janum Morellum Ebredunensem,\r\n  Pyladem suum_,\" printed with a volume of _Xenia_ (Paris, 1569).

Meath, E. by the Irish Sea, S. by Wicklow, and W. by Kildare and\r\nMeath. With the exception of Louth and Carlow, Dublin is the smallest\r\ncounty in Ireland, having an area of 218,873 acres, or about 342 sq. m.\r\nThe northern portion is flat, and the soil good, particularly on the\r\nborders of Meath; but on the southern side the land rises into\r\nelevations of considerable height. The mountains are chiefly covered\r\nwith heath, except where a subsidence in the ground affords a nucleus\r\nfor the formation of bog, with which about 2000 acres are covered. There\r\nare also a few small tracts of bog in the northern part of the county.\r\nThe mountain district is well adapted for timber. The northern coast of\r\nthe county from Balbriggan to Howth has generally a sandy shore, and\r\naffords only the small harbours of Balbriggan and Skerries. In the\r\npromontory of Howth, the coast suddenly assumes a bolder aspect; and\r\nbetween the town of Howth and the rocky islet of Ireland's Eye an\r\nunsuccessful artificial harbour was constructed. Kingstown harbour on\r\nthe south side of Dublin Bay superseded this, and is by far the best in\r\nthe county. Dalkey Island, about 22 acres in extent, lies about midway\r\nbetween Kingstown harbour and the beautiful bay of Killiney. North of\r\nHowth lies Lambay Island, about 600 acres in area. Shell fish,\r\nespecially lobsters, are taken here in abundance. Small islets lie\r\nfarther north off Skerries; the most interesting of which is that known\r\nas Inispatrick, reputed as the first landing-place of St Patrick, and\r\nhaving the ruins of a church said to be the saint's first foundation,\r\nthough it shares this reputation with other sites. Ireland's Eye, off\r\nHowth, is a very picturesque rock with about 54 acres of grass land. It\r\nhas afforded great room for geological disquisition. The chief river in\r\nthe county is the Liffey, which rises in the Wicklow mountains about 12\r\nm. S.W. of Dublin, and, after running about 50 m., empties itself into\r\nDublin Bay. The course of the river is so tortuous that 40 m. may be\r\ntraversed and only 10 gained in direction. The scenery along the banks\r\nof the Liffey is remarkably beautiful. The mountains which occupy the\r\nsouthern border of the county are the extremities of the great group\r\nbelonging to the adjacent county Wicklow. The principal summits are the\r\ngroup containing Glendoo (1919 ft.) and Two Rock (1699 ft.) within the\r\ncounty, and the border group of Kippure, reaching in that summit a\r\nheight of 2475 ft. The grandest features of these hills are the great\r\nnatural ravines which open in them, the most extraordinary being the\r\nScalp through which the traveller passes from Dublin to Wicklow.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--On the north a Silurian upland stretches, falling to the\r\n  sea at Balbriggan, where fossiliferous strata contain contemporaneous\r\n  volcanic rocks. A limestone of Bala age comes out under shales and\r\n  andesites in the promontory of Portrane, and rocks of the same series\r\n  occur in the bold island of Lambay, associated with a large mass of\r\n  dark green porphyritic andesite (the \"Lambay porphyry\"). Silurian\r\n  rocks reappear at Tallaght in the south-west, where the granite of\r\n  Leinster rises through them, forming a moorland 2000 ft. in height\r\n  only a few miles south of Dublin. Old Red Sandstone, seen at Donabate\r\n  and Newcastle, leads up into Carboniferous Limestone, which is often\r\n  darkened by mud and even shaly (\"calpy\" type). This rock produces a\r\n  fairly level country, both north and south of the valley of the\r\n  Liffey, although the beds are greatly folded. Beds of a higher\r\n  Carboniferous zone are retained in synclinals near Rush. The rugged\r\n  peninsula of Howth, connected by a raised bench with the mainland, is\r\n  formed of old quartzites and shales, crushed and folded, and probably\r\n  of Cambrian age. The rocks of the county show many signs of\r\n  ice-action, and boulder-clays and drift-gravels cover the lowland, the\r\n  latter being banked up on the mountain-slopes to heights of 1200 ft.\r\n  or more. Much of this glacial material has been imported from the area\r\n  of the Irish Sea. Lead-ore has been mined at the granite-contact at\r\n  Ballycorus.\r\n\r\n  _Industries._--The extension of Dublin city and its suburbs has no\r\n  doubt had its influence on the decrease of acreage under both tillage\r\n  and pasture. Oats and potatoes are the principal crops, but live\r\n  stock, especially cattle, receives greater attention. A large\r\n  proportion of holdings are of the smallest, nearly one-half of those\r\n  beneath fifteen acres being also beneath one acre. The manufactures of\r\n  the county are mainly confined to the city and suburbs, but there is\r\n  manufacture of cotton hosiery at Balbriggan. The haddock, herring and\r\n  other fisheries, both deep-sea and coastal, are important, and\r\n  Kingstown is the headquarters of the fishery district. The salmon\r\n  fishery district of Dublin also affords considerable employment. As\r\n  containing the metropolis of Ireland, the communications of the county\r\n  are naturally good, several important railways and two canals\r\n  converging upon the city of Dublin, under the head of which they are\r\n  considered.\r\n\r\n_Population and Administration._--The population (148,210 in 1891;\r\n157,568 in 1901) shows a regular increase, which, however, is not\r\nconsistent from year to year. About 70% are Roman Catholics, the\r\nProtestant Episcopalians (24%) standing next. The chief towns, apart\r\nfrom the capital, are Balbriggan (pop. 2236), Blackrock (8719), Dalkey\r\n(3398), Killiney and Ballybrack (2744), Pembroke (25,799), Rathmines and\r\nRathgar (32,602), and the important port of Kingstown (17,377). These\r\nare urban districts. Skerries, Howth and Rush are small maritime towns.\r\nThere are nine baronies in the county, which, including the city of\r\nDublin, are divided into 100 parishes, all within the Protestant and\r\nRoman Catholic dioceses of Dublin. Assizes are held in Dublin, and\r\nquarter sessions also in the capital, and at Balbriggan, Kilmainham,\r\nKingstown and Swords. Previous to the union with Great Britain, this\r\ncounty returned ten representatives to the Irish Parliament,--two for\r\nthe county, two for the city, two for the university, and two for each\r\nof the boroughs of Swords and Newcastle. The county parliamentary\r\ndivisions are now two, north and south, each returning one member. The\r\ncity of Dublin constitutes a separate county.\r\n\r\n_History._--Dublin is among the counties generally considered to have\r\nbeen formed by King John, and comprised the chief portion of country\r\nwithin the English pale. The limits of the county, however, were\r\nuncertain, and underwent many changes before they were fixed. As late as\r\nthe 17th century the mountainous country south of Dublin offered a\r\nretreat to the lawless, and it was not until 1606 that the boundaries of\r\nthe county received definition in this direction, along with the\r\nformation of the county Wicklow. Although so near the seat of government\r\n67,142 acres of profitable land were forfeited in the Rebellion of 1641\r\nand 34,536 acres in the Revolution of 1688. In 1867 the most formidable\r\nof the Fenian risings took place near the village of Tallaght, about 7\r\nm. from the city. The rebels, who numbered from 500 to 700, were found\r\nwandering at dawn, some by a small force of constabulary who, having in\r\nvain called upon them to yield, fired and wounded five of them; but the\r\ngreat bulk of them were overtaken by the troops under Lord Strathnairn,\r\nwho captured them with ease and marched them into the city. There are\r\nnumerous antiquities in the county. Raths or encampments are frequent,\r\nand those at Raheny, Coolock, Lucan, with the large specimen at\r\nShankill or Rathmichael near the Scalp pass may be mentioned. Cromlechs\r\noccur in Phoenix Park, Dublin, at Howth, and elsewhere. There are fine\r\nround towers at Swords, Lusk and Clondalkin, and there is the stump of\r\none at Rathmichael.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, a city, county of a city, parliamentary borough and seaport, and\r\nthe metropolis of Ireland, in the province of Leinster. It lies at the\r\nhead of a bay of the Irish Sea, to which it gives name, about midway on\r\nthe eastern coast of the island, 334 m. W.N.W. of London by the Holyhead\r\nroute, and 70 m. W. of Holyhead on the coast of Anglesey, Wales. (For\r\nmap, see IRELAND.) Its population in 1901 was 290,638.\r\n\r\n_Site, Streets and Buildings._--Dublin lies on the great central\r\nlimestone district which stretches across the island from the Irish Sea\r\nto the Atlantic Ocean, and occupies both banks of the river Liffey. Its\r\nsituation is justly admired. The populous shores of the bay are\r\nexceedingly picturesque. To the north and west the country is\r\ncomparatively level, the central plain of Ireland here reaching to the\r\ncoast, but to the south the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains\r\npractically touch the confines of Greater Dublin, affording\r\ncomprehensive views of the physical position of the city, and forming a\r\nbackground to some of the finest streets. The municipal boundary lies\r\ngenerally a little outside the so-called Circular Road, which may be\r\ntaken as encircling the city proper, with a few breaks. It bears this\r\nname on both the north and south sides of the river. As the city is\r\napproached from the bay, the river Liffey, which divides the city from\r\nwest to east roughly into two equal parts, is seen to be lined with a\r\nfine series of quays. At its mouth, on the north side, is the North Wall\r\nquay, where the principal steamers lie, and in this vicinity are the\r\ndocks. At the opposite (western) end of the city, the Phoenix Park may\r\nbe taken as a convenient landmark. Between this and North Wall the river\r\nis crossed by twelve bridges, which, in order from west to east, are\r\nthese:--Sarah Bridge, the bridge of the North Wall extension railway;\r\nKing's, commemorating a visit of George IV.; Victoria or Barrack;\r\nQueen's; Whitworth, of interest as occupying the site where a bridge has\r\nstood since the 12th century; Richmond, Grattan and Wellington;\r\nO'Connell, Butt and a swivel bridge carrying a loop railway. Of these\r\nO'Connell bridge (formerly known as Carlisle) is the principal, as it\r\nconnects the chief thoroughfare on the north side, namely Sackville (or\r\nO'Connell) Street, with Great Brunswick Street and others on the south.\r\nSackville Street, which gains in appearance from its remarkable breadth,\r\ncontains the principal hotels, and the post office, with a fine Ionic\r\nportico, founded in 1815. At the crossing of Henry Street and Earl\r\nStreet is the Nelson pillar, a beautiful monument 134 ft. in height,\r\nconsisting of a fluted Doric column, raised on a massive pedestal, and\r\ncrowned by a statue of the admiral. At the southern end of the street is\r\nDaniel O'Connell's monument, almost completed by John Henry Foley before\r\nhis death, and erected in 1882. In Rutland Square, at the northern end,\r\nis the Rotunda, containing public rooms for meetings, and adjoining it,\r\nthe Rotunda hospital with its Doric façade.\r\n\r\nFrom the north end of Sackville Street, several large thoroughfares\r\nradiate through the northern part of the city, ultimately joining the\r\nCircular Road at various points. To the west there are the Broadstone\r\nstation, Dominion Street, and beyond this the large workhouse, prison,\r\nasylum and other district buildings, while the Royal barracks front the\r\nriver behind Albert Quay. Two other notable buildings face the river on\r\nthe north bank. Between Whitworth and Richmond bridges stands the \"Four\r\nCourts\" (law courts), on the site of the ancient Dominican monastery of\r\nSt Saviour. It was erected between 1786 and 1796, and is adjoined by\r\nother court buildings, the public record office, containing a vast\r\ncollection, and the police offices. Below the lowest bridge on the\r\nriver, and therefore in the neighbourhood of the shipping quarter, is\r\nthe customs house (1781-1791), considered one of the chief ornaments of\r\nthe city. It presents four fronts, that facing the river being of\r\nPortland stone, in the Doric order, while the rest are of granite. The\r\ncentre is crowned by a dome, surmounted by a statue of Hope. This\r\nbuilding provides offices for the Local Government Board, Boards of\r\nTrade and of Public Works and other bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to the south of the river that the most interesting\r\nbuildings are found. Crossing O'Connell bridge, the short Westmoreland\r\nStreet strikes into a thoroughfare which traverses the entire city\r\nparallel with the river, and is known successively (from west to east)\r\nas James, Thomas, High, Castle, Dame, College and Great Brunswick\r\nstreets. At the end of Westmoreland Street a fine group of buildings is\r\nseen--Trinity College on the left and the Bank of Ireland on the right.\r\nBarely half a mile westward down Dame Street, rises the Castle, and 300\r\nyds. beyond this again is the cathedral of Christ Church. These, with\r\nthe second cathedral of St Patrick, are more conveniently described in\r\nthe inverse order.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Christ Church.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Christ Church, or Holy Trinity, the older of the two\r\nProtestant cathedrals in the possession of which Dublin is remarkable,\r\nwas founded by Sigtryg, a Christianized king of the Danes of Dublin, in\r\n1038, but dates its elevation to a deanery and chapter from 1541. It was\r\nrestored in 1870-1877 by G. E. Street at the charge of Mr Henry Roe, a\r\nmerchant of Dublin, who also presented the Synod House. The restoration\r\ninvolved the complete rebuilding of the choir and the south side of the\r\nnave, but the model of the ancient building was followed with great\r\ncare. The crypt embodies remains of the founder's work; the rest is\r\nTransitional Norman and Early English in style. Among the monuments is\r\nthat of Strongbow, the invader of Ireland, to whom the earlier part of\r\nthe superstructure (1170) is due. Here the tenants of the church lands\r\nwere accustomed to pay their rents. The monument was injured by the fall\r\nof one of the cathedral walls, but was repaired. By its side is a\r\nsmaller tomb, ascribed to Strongbow's son, whom his father killed for\r\nshowing cowardice in battle. Synods were occasionally held in this\r\nchurch, and parliaments also, before the Commons' Hall was destroyed in\r\n1566 by an accidental explosion of gunpowder. Here also the pretender\r\nLambert Simnel was crowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  St Patrick's.\r\n\r\nA short distance south from Christ Church, through the squalid quarter\r\nof Nicholas and Patrick streets, stands the other Protestant cathedral\r\ndedicated to St Patrick, the foundation of which was an attempt to\r\nsupersede the older foundation of Christ Church, owing to jealousies,\r\nboth ecclesiastical and political, arising out of the Anglo-Norman\r\ninvasion. It was founded about 1190 by John Comyn, archbishop of Dublin;\r\nbut there was a church dedicated to the same saint before. It was burnt\r\nabout two hundred years later, but was raised from its ruins with\r\nincreased splendour. At the Reformation it was deprived of its status as\r\na cathedral, and the building was used for some of the purposes of the\r\ncourts of justice. Edward VI. contemplated its change into a university,\r\nbut the project was defeated. In the succeeding reign of Mary, St\r\nPatrick's was restored to its primary destination. The installations of\r\nthe knights of St Patrick, the first of which took place in 1783, were\r\noriginally held here, and some of their insignia are preserved in the\r\nchoir. This cathedral contains the monuments of several illustrious\r\npersons, amongst which the most celebrated are those of Swift (dean of\r\nthis cathedral), of Mrs Hester Johnson, immortalized under the name of\r\n\"Stella\"; of Archbishop Marsh; of the first earl of Cork; and of Duke\r\nSchomberg, who fell at the battle of the Boyne. The tablet over\r\nSchomberg's grave contains what Macaulay called a \"furious libel,\"\r\nthough it only states that the duke's relatives refused the expense of\r\nthe tablet. In the cathedral may be seen the chain ball which killed\r\nGeneral St Ruth at the battle of Aughrim, and the spurs which he wore.\r\nThe cathedral was restored by Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness (1864), whom a\r\nfine statue by John Henry Foley commemorates, and the work was resumed\r\nby his son Lord Iveagh in 1900. Attached to the cathedral is Marsh's\r\nlibrary, incorporated in 1707, by a request of Primate Marsh, archbishop\r\nof Armagh. It contains a good number of theological works and of\r\nmanuscripts, and is open to the public; but is deficient in modern\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Castle.\r\n\r\nDublin Castle stands high, and occupies about ten acres of ground, but\r\nexcepting St Patrick's Hall, the apartments are small, and the building\r\nis of a motley and unimposing appearance, with the exception of the\r\nchapel (a Gothic building of the early 19th century) and great tower.\r\nThe castle was originally built in the first two decades of the 13th\r\ncentury; and there are portions of this period, but nearly the whole is\r\nof the 16th century and later. In St Patrick's hall where the knights of\r\nSt Patrick are invested, are the banners of that order. Opposite the\r\ncastle is the city hall (1779), in the possession of the corporation,\r\nwith statues in the central hall of George III., of Grattan (a superb\r\nwork by Sir Francis Chantry), of Daniel O'Connell, and of Thomas\r\nDrummond by John Hogan and several others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bank of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Ireland (see ARCHITECTURE, fig. 85) occupies five acres, and\r\nwas formerly the House of Parliament. There are three fronts; the\r\nprincipal, towards College Green, is a colonnade of the Ionic order,\r\nwith façade and two projecting wings; it connects with the western\r\nportico by a colonnade of the same order, forming the quadrant of a\r\ncircle. The eastern front, which was the entrance of the House of Lords,\r\nis, by their special wish, of the Corinthian order, made conformable\r\nwith the rest of the building not without difficulty to the architect.\r\nThe House of Lords contains tapestry dating from 1733, and remains in\r\nits original condition, but the octagonal House of Commons was\r\ndemolished by the bank directors, and replaced with a cash-office. The\r\nbuilding was begun in 1729, but the fronts date from the end of the\r\ncentury; the remodelling took place in 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Trinity College.\r\n\r\nTrinity College, or Dublin University, fronts the street with a\r\nPalladian façade (1759), with two good statues by Foley, of Goldsmith\r\nand Burke. Above the gateway is a hall called the Regent House. The\r\nfirst quadrangle, Parliament Square, contains the chapel (1798), with a\r\nCorinthian portico, the public theatre or examination hall (1787),\r\ncontaining portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Molyneux, Burke, Bishop\r\nBerkeley and other celebrities, and the wain-scotted dining hall, also\r\ncontaining portraits. A beautiful modern campanile (1853), erected by\r\nLord John George Beresford, archbishop of Armagh and chancellor of the\r\nuniversity, occupies the centre of the square. Library Square takes its\r\nname from the library, which is one of the four scheduled in the\r\nCopyright Act as entitled to receive a copy of every volume published in\r\nthe United Kingdom. There is a notable collection of early Irish\r\nmanuscripts, including the magnificently ornamented Book of Kells,\r\ncontaining the gospels. The building was begun in 1712. In this square\r\nare the oldest buildings of the foundation, dating in part from the\r\nclose of the 17th century, and the modern Graduates' Memorial buildings\r\n(1904). These contain a theatre, library and reading-room, the rooms of\r\nthe college societies and others. The schools form a fine modern pile\r\n(1856), and other buildings are the provost's house (1760), printing\r\nhouse (1760), museum (1857) and the medical school buildings, in three\r\nblocks, one of the best schools in the kingdom. Other buildings of the\r\n20th century include chemical laboratories. The College Park and\r\nFellows' Garden are of considerable beauty. In the former most of the\r\nrecreations of the students take place; but the college also supports a\r\nwell-known rowing-club. The college observatory is at Dunsink, about 5\r\nm. north-west of Dublin; it is amply furnished with astronomical\r\ninstruments. It was endowed by Dr Francis Andrews, provost of Trinity\r\nCollege, was erected in 1785, and in 1791 was placed by statute under\r\nthe management of the royal astronomer of Ireland, whose official\r\nresidence is here. The magnetic observatory of Dublin was erected in the\r\nyears 1837-1838 in the gardens attached to Trinity College, at the\r\nexpense of the university. A normal climatological station was\r\nestablished in the Fellows' Garden in 1904. The botanic garden is at\r\nBall's Bridge, 1 m. S.E. of the college.\r\n\r\n  The alternative title of Dublin University or Trinity College, Dublin\r\n  (commonly abbreviated T.C.D.), is explained by the fact that the\r\n  university consists of only one college, that of \"the Holy and\r\n  Undivided Trinity.\" This was founded under charter from Queen\r\n  Elizabeth in 1591, and is the greatest foundation of its kind in the\r\n  country. The corporation consists of a provost, 7 senior fellows, 25\r\n  junior fellows and 70 scholars. A vacancy among the fellows is filled\r\n  up by the provost and a select number of the fellows, after\r\n  examination comprised in five principal courses, mathematics,\r\n  experimental science, classics, mental and moral science and Hebrew.\r\n  Fellowships are held for life. Until the year 1840 the fellows were\r\n  bound to celibacy, but that restriction was then removed. All except\r\n  five (medical and law fellows) were bound to take Holy Orders until\r\n  1872. The scholars on the foundation (or \"of the House\") are chosen\r\n  from among the undergraduates, for merit in classics, mathematics or\r\n  experimental science. The pecuniary advantages attaching to\r\n  scholarship (£20 Irish, free commons, and rooms at half the charge\r\n  made to other students) last for four years. Students after an\r\n  examination are admitted as fellow-commoners, pensioners or sizars.\r\n  Fellow-commoners, who have decreased in numbers in modern times, pay\r\n  higher fees than the ordinary undergraduates or pensioners, and have\r\n  certain advantages of precedence, including the right of dining at the\r\n  fellows' table. Sizarships are awarded on examination to students of\r\n  limited means, and carry certain relaxations of fees. They were\r\n  formerly given on the nomination of fellows. Noblemen, noblemen's sons\r\n  and baronets (_nobilis, filius nobilis, eques_) have the privilege of\r\n  forming a separate order with peculiar advantages, on the payment of\r\n  additional charges. The mode of admission to the university is in all\r\n  cases by examination. Various exhibitions and prizes are awarded both\r\n  in connexion with the entrance of students and at subsequent stages of\r\n  the course of instruction, which normally lasts four years. There are\r\n  three terms in each year--Michaelmas (beginning the Academic year),\r\n  Hilary and Trinity. The undergraduate is called in his first year a\r\n  junior freshman, in his second a senior freshman, in his third a\r\n  junior sophister, and in his fourth a senior sophister. The usual arts\r\n  and scientific courses are provided, and there are four professional\r\n  schools--divinity, law, physic and engineering. The undergraduate has\r\n  certain examinations in each year, and four \"commencements\" are held\r\n  every year for the purpose of conferring degrees. Freedom is offered\r\n  to students who wish to be transferred from Oxford, Cambridge, or\r\n  certain colonial universities to Trinity College, by the recognition\r\n  of terms kept in the former institutions as part of the necessary\r\n  course at Trinity College. In 1903 it was decided to bestow degrees on\r\n  women, and in 1904 to establish women's scholarships. The funds of the\r\n  college, arising from lands and the fees of students, are managed\r\n  solely by the provost and seven senior fellows, who form a board, to\r\n  which and to the academic council the whole government of the\r\n  university, both in its executive and its legislative branches, is\r\n  committed. The council consists of the provost and sixteen members of\r\n  the senate elected by the fellows, professors, &c; the senate consists\r\n  of the chancellor or his deputy and doctors and masters who keep their\r\n  names on the books. The average number of students on the books is\r\n  about 1300. By an act passed in 1873, known as Fawcett's Act, all\r\n  tests were abolished, and the prizes and honours of all grades\r\n  hitherto reserved for Protestants of the Established Church were\r\n  thrown open to all. The university returns two members to parliament.\r\n  (See _Dublin University Calendar_, annual.)\r\n\r\nThere remain to be mentioned the following buildings in Dublin. The\r\npermanent building of the International Exhibition of 1865 adjoins the\r\npleasure ground of St Stephen's Green. This building was occupied by the\r\nRoyal University of Ireland until its dissolution under the Irish\r\nUniversities Act 1908, which provided for a new university at Dublin, to\r\nwhich the building was transferred under the act (see IRELAND:\r\n_Education_). The new university is called the National University of\r\nIreland. At the same time a new college was founded under the name of\r\nUniversity College. The Royal University replaced the Queen's University\r\nunder the University Act (Ireland) in 1879. No teaching was carried on,\r\nbut examinations were held and degrees conferred, both on men and on\r\nwomen. On the west side of St Stephen's Green is the Catholic University\r\n(1854), which is under the Jesuit Fathers and affiliated to the Royal\r\nUniversity. Between Trinity College and St Stephen's Green, a large\r\ngroup of buildings includes the Royal Dublin Society, founded in 1683 to\r\ndevelop agriculture and the useful arts, with a library and gallery of\r\nstatuary; the Science and Arts Museum, and the National Library, the\r\nformer with a noteworthy collection of Irish antiquities; the Museum of\r\nNatural History, with a splendid collection of Irish fauna; and the\r\nNational Gallery of Ireland, founded in 1853. Here was once a residence\r\nof the duke of Leinster, and the buildings surround the open space of\r\nLeinster Lawn. Educational foundations include the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians, of Surgeons and of Science; the Royal Irish Academy, with an\r\nunequalled collection of national antiquities, including manuscripts and\r\na library; and the Royal Hibernian Academy of painting, sculpture and\r\narchitecture. In 1904 the formation of a municipally supported gallery\r\nof modern art (mainly due to the initiative and generosity of Mr Hugh\r\nLane) was signalized by an exhibition including the pictures intended to\r\nconstitute the nucleus of the gallery. In 1905 King Edward VII. laid the\r\nfoundation stone of a college of science on a site in the vicinity of\r\nLeinster Lawn. The full scheme for the occupation of the site included,\r\nnot only the college, but also offices for the Board of Works and the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. The famous Dublin Horse and Agricultural\r\nShows are held at Ball's Bridge in April, August and December.\r\n\r\nThe most notable churches apart from the cathedrals are Roman Catholic\r\nand principally modern. The lofty church of the Augustinians in Thomas\r\nStreet; St Mary's, the pro-cathedral, in Marlborough Street, with\r\nGrecian ornamentation within, and a Doric portico; St Paul's on Arran\r\nQuay, in the Ionic style; and the striking St Francis Xavier in Gardiner\r\nStreet, also Ionic, are all noteworthy, and the last is one of the\r\nfinest modern churches in Ireland. Among theatres Dublin has, in the\r\nRoyal, a handsome building which replaced the old Theatre Royal, burnt\r\ndown in 1880. Clubs, which are numerous, are chiefly found in the\r\nneighbourhood of Sackville Street; and there should further be mentioned\r\nthe Rotunda, at the corner of Great Britain Street and Sackville Street,\r\na beautiful building of its kind, belonging to the adjacent hospital,\r\nand used for concerts and other entertainments, while its gardens are\r\nused for agricultural shows.\r\n\r\n_Suburbs._--To the west of the city lies the Phoenix Park. Here, besides\r\nthe viceregal demesne and lodge and the magazine, are a zoological\r\ngarden, a people's garden, the Wellington monument, two barracks, the\r\nHibernian military school, the \"Fifteen Acres,\" a natural amphitheatre\r\n(of much greater extent than its name implies) used as a review ground,\r\nand a racecourse. The amenities of Phoenix Park were enhanced in 1905 by\r\nthe purchase for the crown of land extending along the Liffey from\r\nIsland bridge to Chapelizod, which might otherwise have been built over.\r\nTo the south lies Kilmainham. Here is the royal hospital for pensioners\r\nand maimed soldiers. Close by is Kilmainham prison. To the west the\r\nvalley of the Liffey affords pleasant scenery, with the well-known\r\ngrounds called the \"Strawberry Beds\" on the north bank. In this\r\ndirection lies Chapelizod, said to take its name from that Iseult whom\r\nTennyson, Matthew Arnold and Wagner made a heroine; beyond which is\r\nLucan connected with the city by tramway. Northward lies Clondalkin,\r\nwith its round tower, marking the site of the important early see of\r\nCluain Dolcain; Glasnevin, with famous botanical gardens; Finglas, with\r\na ruined church of early foundation, and an Irish cross; and Clontarf, a\r\nfavoured resort on the bay, with its modern castle and many residences\r\nof the wealthy classes in the vicinity. South of the city are Rathmines,\r\na populous suburb, near which, at the \"Bloody Fields,\" English colonists\r\nwere murdered by the natives in 1209; and Donnybrook, celebrated for its\r\nformer fair. Rathmines, Monkstown, Clontarf, Dalkey and Killiney, with\r\nthe neighbourhood of Kingstown and Pembroke, are the most favoured\r\nresidential districts. Howth, Malahide and Sutton to the north, and Bray\r\nto the south, are favoured seaside watering-places outside the radius of\r\nactual suburbs.\r\n\r\n_Communications._--The direct route to Dublin from London and other\r\nparts of England is by the Holyhead route, controlled by the London &\r\nNorth Western railway with steamers to the port of Dublin itself, while\r\nthe company also works in conjunction with the mail steamers of the City\r\nof Dublin Steam Packet Company to the outlying port of Kingstown, 7 m.\r\nS.E. Passenger steamers, however, also serve Liverpool, Heysham,\r\nBristol, the south coast ports of England and London; Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow, and other ports of Great Britain. The railways leaving Dublin\r\nare the following: the Great Northern, with its terminus in Amiens\r\nStreet, with suburban lines, and a main line running north to Drogheda,\r\nDundalk and Belfast, with ramifications through the northern countries;\r\nthe Great Southern & Western (Kingsbridge terminus) to Kilkenny, Athlone\r\nand Cork; the Midland Great Western (Broadstone terminus), to Cavan,\r\nSligo and Galway; the Dublin & South-Eastern (Harcourt Street and\r\nWestland Row for Kingstown); and there is the North Wall station of the\r\nLondon & North-Western, with the line known as the North Wall extension,\r\nconnecting with the other main lines. The internal communications of the\r\ncity are excellent, electric tramways traversing the principal streets,\r\nand connecting all the principal suburbs.\r\n\r\n_Trade._--Dublin was for long stigmatized as lacking, for so large a\r\ncity, in the proper signs of commercial enterprise. A certain spirit of\r\nfoolish pride was said to exist which sought to disown trade; and the\r\ntendency to be poor and genteel in the civil service, at the bar, in the\r\nconstabulary, in the army, in professional life, rather than prosperous\r\nin business, was one of the most unfortunate and strongly marked\r\ncharacteristics of Dublin society. This was attributable to the\r\nlingering yet potent influence of an unhappy past was held by some;\r\nwhile others attributed the weakness to the viceregal office and the\r\neffects of a sham court. About the time of the Revolution, the woollen\r\ntrade flourished in Dublin, and the produce attained great celebrity.\r\nThe cheapness of labour attracted capitalists, who started extensive\r\nfactories in that quarter of the town known even now as the Liberties.\r\nThis quarter was inhabited altogether by workers in wool, and as the\r\ncity was small, the aristocracy lived close by in noble mansions which\r\nare now miserable memorials of past prosperity. About 1700 the English\r\nlegislature prevailed on William III. to assent to laws which directly\r\ncrushed the Irish trade. All exportation except to England was\r\nperemptorily forbidden, and the woollen manufacture soon decayed. But at\r\nthe close of the 18th century there were 5000 persons at work in the\r\nlooms of the Liberties. About 1715 parliament favoured the manufacture\r\nof linen, and the Linen Hall was built. The cotton trade was soon\r\nafterwards introduced; and silk manufacture was begun by the Huguenots,\r\nwho had settled in Dublin in considerable numbers after the revocation\r\nof the edict of Nantes. Acts favourable to these enterprises were\r\npassed, and they flourished apace. But the old jealousy arose in the\r\nreign of George I., and in the reign of George III. an act was passed\r\nwhich tended directly to the ruin of the manufacture. The linen shared\r\nthe same fate. Dublin poplins, however, keep their reputation. However\r\nadverse influences may have been combated, Dublin yet produces little\r\nfor export save whisky and porter, the latter from the famous Guinness\r\nbrewery and others; but a considerable export trade, principally in\r\nagricultural produce, passes through Dublin from the country. The total\r\nannual export trade may be valued at about £120,000, while imports\r\nexceed in value £3,000,000. To the manufacturing industries of the city\r\nthere should be added mineral water works, foundries and shipbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Harbour.\r\n\r\nBy continual dredging a great depth of water is kept available in the\r\nharbour. The Dublin Port and Docks Board, which was created in 1898 and\r\nconsists of the mayor and six members of the corporation, with other\r\nmembers representing the trading and shipping interests, undertook\r\nconsiderable works of improvement at the beginning of the 20th century.\r\nThese improvements, _inter alia_, enabled vessels drawing up to 23 ft.\r\nto lie alongside the extensive quays which border the Liffey, at low\r\ntide. The extensive Alexandra tidal basin, on the north side of the\r\nLiffey, admits vessels of similar capacity. The Custom House Works on\r\nthe north side have about 17 ft. of water. With docks named after them\r\nare connected the Royal and Grand Canals, passing respectively to north\r\nand south of the city, the one penetrating the great central plain of\r\nIreland on the north, the other following the course of the Liffey,\r\ndoing the same on the south, and both joining the river Shannon. The\r\ndocks attached to the canals, and certain other smaller docks, are owned\r\nby companies, and tolls are levied on vessels entering these, but not\r\nthose entering the docks under the Board.\r\n\r\n_Government._--Dublin was formerly represented by two members in the\r\nimperial parliament, but in 1885 the parliamentary borough was divided\r\ninto the four divisions of College Green, Harbour, St Stephen's Green\r\nand St Patrick's, each returning one member. The lord-lieutenant of\r\nIreland occupies Dublin Castle and the Viceregal Lodge in Phoenix Park.\r\nDublin is thus the seat of the viceregal court. It is also the seat of\r\nthe Irish courts of law and equity. In connexion with these it may be\r\nnoted that in 1904 a special court was established for children. On the\r\nconstitution of Dublin as a county borough in 1898, the positions and\r\nduties of its corporation were left practically unaltered. The\r\ncorporation consists of a lord mayor, 20 aldermen and 60 councillors,\r\nrepresenting 20 wards. The income of the body arises from rents on\r\nproperty, customs and taxes. Under an act passed in 1875 the corporation\r\nhas the right to forward every year three names of persons suitable for\r\nthe office of high sheriff to the viceroy, one of which shall be\r\nselected by him. The corporation has neither control over the police nor\r\nany judicial duties, excepting as regards a court of conscience dealing\r\nwith debts under 40s. (Irish); while the lord mayor holds a court for\r\ndebts over 40s., and for the settlement of cases between masters and\r\nservants. The lord mayor is clerk of the markets and supervises weights\r\nand measures and deals with cases of adulteration. Besides the usual\r\nduties of local government, and the connexion with the port and docks\r\nboards already explained, there should be noticed the connexion of the\r\ncorporation with such bodies as those controlling the city technical\r\nschools, the Royal Irish Academy of Music, and the gallery of modern\r\nart. The corporation has shown some concern for the housing of the poor,\r\nand an extensive scheme taken up in 1904 included the provision of\r\ncottage dwellings in the suburbs, as at Clontarf, besides improvements\r\nwithin the city itself. In 1905 a home on the model of the Rowton Houses\r\nin London, provided by Lord Iveagh, was opened in Bride Road. A\r\ncompetent fire-brigade is maintained by the corporation. The city\r\ncoroner is a corporate officer. The city hall, used as municipal\r\noffices, has already been mentioned; the official residence of the lord\r\nmayor is the Mansion House, Dawson Street. The Dublin metropolitan\r\npolice is a force peculiar to the city, the remainder of Ireland being\r\nprotected civilly by the Royal Irish Constabulary. A large military\r\nforce is usually maintained in the city of Dublin, which is the\r\nheadquarters of the military district of Dublin and of the staff of\r\nIreland (q.v.). The troops are accommodated in several large barracks in\r\nvarious parts of the city.\r\n\r\n_Charities._--The number of charitable institutions is large. The\r\nhospital and Free School of King Charles I., commonly called the Blue\r\nCoat hospital, was founded in 1670. It is devoted to the education and\r\nmaintenance of the sons of citizens in poor circumstances. Before the\r\nIrish Parliament Houses were erected the parliament met in the school\r\nbuilding. Among hospitals those of special general interest are the\r\nSteevens, the oldest in the city, founded under the will of Dr Richard\r\nSteevens in 1720; the Mater Misericordiae (1861), which includes a\r\nlaboratory and museum, and is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, but\r\nrelieves sufferers independently of their creed; the Rotunda lying-in\r\nhospital (1756); the Royal hospital for incurables, Donnybrook, which\r\nwas founded in 1744 by the Dublin Musical Society; and the Royal\r\nVictoria Eye and Ear hospital, Adelaide Road, which amalgamated (1904)\r\ntwo similar institutions. Lunatics are maintained in St Patrick's\r\nhospital, founded in 1745, pursuant to the will of Dean Swift, and\r\nconducted by governors appointed under the charter of incorporation. The\r\nRichmond lunatic asylum, erected near the House of Industry, and placed\r\nunder the care of officers appointed by government, receives patients\r\nfrom a district consisting of the counties of Dublin, Louth, Meath and\r\nWicklow, each of these contributing towards its expenses in proportion\r\nto the number of patients sent in. Besides these public establishments\r\nfor the custody of lunatics, there are in the vicinity of Dublin various\r\nprivate asylums. The principal institution for blind men (and also those\r\nafflicted by gout) is Simpson's hospital (1780), founded by a merchant\r\nof Dublin; while blind women are maintained at the Molyneux asylum\r\n(1815). An institution for the maintenance and education of children\r\nborn deaf and dumb is maintained at Claremont, near Glasnevin (1816).\r\nThe plan of the Royal hospital, for old and maimed soldiers, was first\r\nsuggested by the earl of Essex, when lord-lieutenant, and carried into\r\neffect through the repeated applications of the duke of Ormond to\r\nCharles II. The site chosen for it was that of the ancient priory of\r\nKilmainham, founded by Strongbow for Knights Templars. The building,\r\ncompleted in 1684, according to a plan of Sir Christopher Wren, is an\r\noblong, three sides of which are dwelling-rooms, connected by covered\r\ncorridors. The fourth contains the chapel, the dining-hall, and the\r\napartments of the master, who is always the commander of the forces for\r\nthe time being. The Royal Hibernian military school in Phoenix Park\r\n(1765) provides for soldiers' orphan sons. The Drummond Institution,\r\nChapelizod, for the orphan daughters of soldiers, was established in\r\n1864 by John Drummond, alderman, who left £20,000 to found the asylum.\r\nThe Hibernian Marine Society for the maintenance of seamen's sons was\r\nestablished in the city in 1766, but now has buildings at Clontarf. The\r\nRoman Catholic Church has charge of a number of special charities, some\r\nof them educational and some for the relief of suffering.\r\n\r\n_History._--The name of Dublin signifies the \"Black pool.\" The early\r\nhistory is mainly legendary. It is recorded that the inhabitants of\r\nLeinster were defeated by the people of Dublin in the year 291.\r\nChristianity was introduced by St Patrick about 450. In the 9th century\r\nthe Danes attacked Dublin and took it. The first Norseman who may be\r\nreckoned as king was Thorkel I. (832), though the Danes had appeared in\r\nthe country as early as the close of the previous century. Thorkel\r\nestablished himself strongly at Armagh. In 1014 Brian Boroihme, king of\r\nMunster, attacked the enemy and fought the battle of Clontarf, in which\r\nhe and his son and 11,000 of his followers fell. The Irish, however, won\r\nthe battle, but the Danes reoccupied the city. Constant struggles with\r\nthe Irish resulted in intermissions of the Danish supremacy from 1052 to\r\n1072, at various intervals between 1075 and 1118 and from 1124 to 1136.\r\nThe Danes were finally ousted by the Anglo-Normans in 1171. In 1172\r\nHenry II. landed at Waterford, and came to Dublin and held his court\r\nthere in a pavilion of wickerwork where the Irish chiefs were\r\nentertained with great pomp, and alliances entered into with them.\r\nPrevious to his departure for England, Henry bestowed the government on\r\nHugh de Lacy, having granted by charter \"to his subjects of Bristol his\r\ncity of Dublin to inhabit, and to hold of him and his heirs for ever,\r\nwith all the liberties and free customs which his subjects of Bristol\r\nthen enjoyed at Bristol and through all England.\" In 1176 Strongbow,\r\nearl of Pembroke, and chief leader of the Anglo-Norman forces, died in\r\nDublin of a mortification in one of his feet, and was buried in Christ\r\nChurch Cathedral, where his monument remains well preserved. A fresh\r\ncharter was granted in 1207 by King John to the inhabitants of Dublin,\r\nwho had not yet made their peace with the neighbourhood, but, like the\r\nsettlers in other towns, were at constant feud with the native Irish; so\r\nthat two years after the date of this charter, whilst the citizens of\r\nDublin were celebrating Easter at Cullenswood, they were set upon by the\r\nIrish of the neighbouring mountains, and 500 of them killed. The scene\r\nof slaughter is still called the Bloody Fields, and Easter Monday\r\ndenominated Black Monday. On each succeeding anniversary of that day,\r\nwith the prevalent desire of perpetuating a feud, the citizens marched\r\nout to Cullenswood with banners displayed--\"a terror to the native\r\nIrish.\" In 1216 Magna Carta, a copy of which is to be found in the Red\r\nBook of the Exchequer, was granted to the Irish by Henry III. In 1217\r\nthe fee farm of the city was granted to the citizens at a rent of 200\r\nmarks per annum; and about this period many monastic buildings were\r\nfounded. In 1227 the same monarch confirmed the charter of John fixing\r\nthe city boundaries and the jurisdiction of its magistrates.\r\n\r\nDuring the invasion of Ireland by Edward Bruce in 1315 some of the\r\nsuburbs of Dublin were burnt to prevent them from falling into his hand.\r\nThe inroad of Bruce had been countenanced by the native Irish\r\necclesiastics, whose sentiments were recorded in a statement addressed\r\nto Pope John XXII. Some notion of the defence made against Bruce's\r\ninvasion may be gained from the fact that the churches were torn down to\r\nsupply stones for the building of the city walls. Bruce had seized\r\nGreencastle on his march; but the natives re-took the town, and brought\r\nto Dublin the governor who had yielded to Bruce. He was starved to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nRichard II. erected Dublin into a marquisate in favour of Robert de\r\nVere, whom he also created duke of Ireland. The same monarch entered\r\nDublin in 1394 with 30,000 bowmen and 4000 cavalry, bringing with him\r\nthe crown jewels; but after holding a parliament and making much courtly\r\ndisplay before the native chieftains, on several of whom he conferred\r\nknighthood, he returned to England. Five years later, enriched with the\r\nspoils of his uncle, John of Gaunt, Richard returned to Ireland, landing\r\nat Waterford, whence he marched through the counties of Kilkenny and\r\nWicklow, and subsequently arrived in Dublin, where he remained a\r\nfortnight, sumptuously entertained by the provost, as the chief\r\nmagistrate of the city was then called, till intelligence of the\r\ninvasion of his kingdom by Bolingbroke recalled him to England.\r\n\r\nIn 1534 Lord Thomas Fitzgerald, better known as Silken Thomas (so called\r\nbecause of a fantastic fringe worn in the helmet of his followers), a\r\nyoung man of rash courage and good abilities, son of the Lord Deputy\r\nKildare, believing his father, who was imprisoned in the Tower of\r\nLondon, to have been beheaded, organized a rebellion against the English\r\nGovernment, and marched with his followers from the mansion of the earls\r\nof Kildare in Thomas Court, through Dame's Gate to St Mary's Abbey,\r\nwhere, in the council chamber, he proclaimed himself a rebel. On his\r\nappearing before the wall with a powerful force, the citizens were\r\ninduced through fear to give admission to a detachment of his troops to\r\nbesiege the castle; but, on hearing that he had met with a reverse in\r\nanother quarter, they suddenly closed their gates and detained his men\r\nas prisoners. He then attacked the city itself; but, finding it too\r\nstrong to be seized by a _coup de main_, he raised the siege on\r\ncondition of having his captured soldiers exchanged for the children of\r\nsome of the principal citizens who had fallen into his hands. After much\r\nvicissitude of fortune, Lord Thomas and others concerned in this\r\nrebellion were executed at Tyburn in 1536.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of civil war in 1641, a conspiracy of the Irish septs,\r\nunder the direction of Roger Moore, to seize Dublin Castle, was\r\ndisclosed by one Owen Connolly on the eve of the day on which the\r\nattempt was to have been made, and the city was thus preserved for the\r\nking's party; but the Irish outside began an indiscriminate\r\nextermination of the Protestant population. In 1646 Dublin was besieged,\r\nbut without success, by the Irish army of 16,000 foot and 1600 horse,\r\nunder the guidance of the Pope's nuncio Rinuccini and others, banded\r\ntogether \"to restore and establish in Ireland the exercise of the Roman\r\nCatholic religion.\" The city had been put in an efficient state of\r\ndefence by the marquess of Ormonde, then lord-lieutenant; but in the\r\nfollowing year, to prevent it falling into the hands of the Irish, he\r\nsurrendered it on conditions to Colonel Jones, commander of the\r\nParliamentary forces. In 1649 Ormonde was totally defeated at the battle\r\nof Baggotrath, near Old Rathmines, in an attempt to recover possession.\r\nThe same year Cromwell landed in Dublin, as commander-in-chief under the\r\nparliament, with 9000 foot and 4000 horse, and proceeded thence on his\r\ncareer of conquest.\r\n\r\nWhen James II. landed in Ireland in 1689 to assert his right to the\r\nBritish throne, he held a parliament in Dublin, which passed acts of\r\nattainder against upwards of 3000 Protestants. The governor of the city,\r\nColonel Luttrell, at the same time issued a proclamation ordering all\r\nProtestants not housekeepers, excepting those following some trade, to\r\ndepart from the city within 24 hours, under pain of death or\r\nimprisonment, and in various ways restricting those who were allowed to\r\nremain. In the hope of relieving his financial difficulties, the king\r\nerected a mint, where money was coined of the \"worst kind of old brass,\r\nguns and the refuse of metals, melted down together,\" of the nominal\r\nvalue of £1,568,800, with which his troops were paid, and tradesmen were\r\ncompelled to receive it under penalty of being hanged in case of\r\nrefusal. Under these regulations the entire coinage was put into\r\ncirculation. After his defeat at the battle of the Boyne, James returned\r\nto Dublin, but left it again before daybreak the next day; and William\r\nIII. advancing by slow marches, on his arrival encamped at Finglas, with\r\nupwards of 30,000 men, and the following day proceeded in state to St\r\nPatrick's cathedral to return thanks for his victory.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 a convention of delegates from all the volunteer corps in\r\nIreland assembled in Dublin for the purpose of procuring a reform in\r\nparliament; but the House of Commons refused to entertain the\r\nproposition, and the convention separated without coming to any\r\npractical result. In May 1798 the breaking out of a conspiracy planned\r\nby the United Irishmen to seize the city was prevented by the capture of\r\nLord Edward Fitzgerald, son of the duke of Leinster and husband of the\r\ncelebrated \"Pamela.\" Lord Edward died in prison of the wounds received\r\nin the encounter which preceded his capture. In 1803 an insurrection\r\nheaded by Robert Emmett, a young barrister of much promise, broke out,\r\nbut was immediately quelled, with the loss of some lives in the tumult,\r\nand the death of its leaders on the scaffold. In 1848 William Smith\r\nO'Brien, M.P. for Limerick, raised a rebellion in Tipperary, and the\r\nlower classes in Dublin were greatly agitated. Owing, however, to timely\r\nand judicious disposition of the military and police forces the city was\r\nsaved from much bloodshed. In 1867 the most serious of modern\r\nconspiracies, that known as the Fenian organization, came to light. The\r\nreality of it was proved by a ship being found laden with gunpowder in\r\nthe Liverpool docks, and another with £5000 and 2000 pike-heads in\r\nDublin. The Habeas Corpus Act was suspended at one sitting by both\r\nHouses of Parliament and about 960 arrests were made in Dublin in a few\r\nhours. Dublin castle was fortified; and the citizens lived in a state of\r\nterror for several weeks together. For later history, see IRELAND.\r\n\r\n  See W.
