In its preparation my aim has been to make the work\r\nas comprehensive in description and detail as the prescribed limits would\r\nallow, and I have endeavoured to write in a style free from any tendency\r\nto pedantry, and I hope, also, from dulness. How far these conditions\r\nhave been fulfilled I must now leave to the judgment of the reader, doing\r\nso with some degree of confidence that at any rate the attempt will be\r\ngenerally appreciated, if the success be not universally acknowledged. In\r\nthe course of my labours I have availed myself of the works of various\r\nauthors, and desire to acknowledge my indebtedness, especially to\r\nBaines’s Lancashire, Fishwick’s Kirkham, Thornber’s Blackpool, and many\r\nvolumes of the Cheetham and other historical societies. My thanks for\r\nvaluable aid are also due to the following gentlemen, amongst others, the\r\nVen. Archdeacon Hornby, of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre; the Rev. W. Richardson,\r\nof Poulton-le-Fylde; Col. Bourne, M.P., of Hackensall and Heathfield;\r\nJohn Furness, esq., of Fulwood; W. H. Poole, esq., of Fleetwood; and the\r\nBailiffs of Kirkham.\r\n\r\n                                                           _JOHN PORTER._\r\n\r\n  _Fleetwood, August, 1876._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 7, line 15, after the word _crossing_, insert _the Main Dyke from_.\r\nThis Dyke is crossed after leaving, and not before reaching, Staining, as\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nPage 147, line 9 from the bottom, for _Gulph_, read _Gulf_.\r\n\r\nPage 183, line 2, for 1857, read 1657.\r\n\r\nPage 256, dele the heading _Coasting_.\r\n\r\nPage 286, line 2 from the bottom, for _fortified_, read _forfeited_.\r\n\r\nPage 289, line 13 from the bottom, for the first _funds_, read\r\n_expenses_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE.\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  THE ANCIENT BRITONS, ROMANS, ANGLO-SAXONS AND DANES                 1-29\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE NORMAN CONQUEST TO JAMES THE FIRST                             30-54\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  JAMES THE FIRST TO QUEEN VICTORIA                                  55-86\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  CONDITIONS, CUSTOMS, AND SUPERSTITIONS OF THE PEOPLE              87-114\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  COSTUMES, COUNTRY, RIVERS AND SEA                                115-150\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE PEDIGREES OF ANCIENT FAMILIES                                151-185\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  PARISH OF POULTON-LE-FYLDE.

Wait awhile,\r\n  My curious friends! and let us first arrange\r\n  In proper order your promiscuous throng.”\r\n\r\nThe large district of western Lancashire, denominated from time\r\nimmemorial the Fylde, embraces one third at least of the Hundred of\r\nAmounderness, and a line drawn from Ashton, on the Ribble, to Churchtown,\r\non the Wyre, forms the nearest approach to an eastern boundary\r\nattainable, for although the section cut off by its means includes more\r\nland and villages than properly appertain to the Fylde, a more westerly\r\ndivision would exclude others which form part of it. The whole of the\r\nparishes of Bispham, Lytham, Poulton, and St. Michael’s; and the parish\r\nof Kirkham, exclusive of Goosnargh-with-Newsham and Whittingham, are\r\ncomprised in the Fylde country.\r\n\r\nThe word Amounderness was formerly considered to signify the “Promontory\r\nof Agmund,” or “Edmund,” and this origin is alluded to in a treatise\r\nwritten some years since by Mr. Thomas Baines on the “Valley of the\r\nMersey,” in which the following remarks occur:—“In the year 911 the\r\nNorthumbrians themselves began the war, for they despised the peace which\r\nKing Edward and his ‘Witan’ offered them, and overran the land of Mercia.\r\nAfter collecting great booty they were overtaken on their march home by\r\nthe forces of the West Saxons and the Mercians, who put them to flight\r\nand slew many thousands of them. Two Danish Kings and five Earls were\r\nslain in this battle. Amongst the Earls slain was Agmund, the governor,\r\nfrom whom the Hundred of Agmunderness (Amounderness) was probably named.”\r\nIn order that the reader may properly comprehend why Mr. Baines should\r\nsurmise that Amounderness received its title from the Danish Earl,\r\nAgmund, it may be stated that the extensive province of Northumbria, then\r\ncolonised by the Northmen or Danes, embraced, amongst other territory,\r\nthe district afterwards called Lancashire, and, consequently, the Hundred\r\nof Amounderness would be in a great measure under Danish governance.\r\nWhen, however, we call to mind that the Danes did not invade England\r\nuntil A.D. 787, and learn that this Hundred was entered in the Ripon\r\ngrant in A.D. 705, as Hacmunderness, it becomes obvious that the name\r\ncannot have been conferred upon it by that nation, and some other source\r\nmust be looked to for its origin. In Gibsons’ Etymological Geography\r\nthere is “Anderness” (for Ackmunderness) described as a “promontory\r\nsheltered by oaks, (ac, oak; and mund, protection).” As many large trunks\r\nof trees have been discovered beneath the layers of peat in the extensive\r\nlocal mosses, whilst others have been laid bare along the shore by the\r\naction of the tides, it can be readily believed that at one time the\r\ngreater share of the district was clothed with forests. Leyland, who\r\nwas antiquary to Henry VIII., and surveyed the Hundred during the reign\r\nof that monarch, 1509-47, says:—“Al Aundernesse for the most parte in\r\ntime paste hathe been full of woods, and many of the moores replenished\r\nwith hy fyrre trees; but now such part of Aundernesse as is towarde the\r\nse is sore destitute of woodde.” With such irrefutable evidences of the\r\nearly woodland condition of Amounderness, there need be no hesitation\r\nin accepting the signification which Messrs. Gibson have given to the\r\nname—the Ness or Promontory protected by oaks. The word Fylde is regarded\r\nsimply as a corruption of “Field.” Camden in his “Britannia” of 1590,\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n  “Tota est campestris, unde Fild pro Field appellatur.”[1]\r\n\r\n  (The whole is champaign, whence it is called Fild for Field.)\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent edition of the same work Fild is spelt File, and the\r\nlatter orthography was used in Fileplumpton, in the Duchy records,\r\nafterwards called Fylde Plumpton, and now Wood Plumpton. The Fylde\r\nsection of this Hundred is a level well-watered country, highly\r\ncultivated and richly productive, especially of grain, from which\r\ncircumstance it was formerly designated the corn-field of Amounderness.\r\n\r\nAnterior to the third invasion of the Romans in A.D. 43, the inhabitants\r\nof the Fylde and other portions of Lancashire lying between the range\r\nof mountains which separates this county from Yorkshire, and the coast\r\nabout the Bay of Morecambe, were called the Setantii or Segantii, “the\r\ndwellers in the country of water,” but at that date the whole tract\r\npopulated by these people was included in the more extensive province of\r\nthe Brigantes, comprehending what are now known as the six counties of\r\nYork, Durham, Northumberland, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Lancaster.\r\nThe Fylde at that epoch would be composed chiefly of morasses and\r\nforests, interspersed with limited areas and narrow paths of more\r\nstable land, and there can be little doubt that the dwellers on such\r\nan uninviting spot must have been very few, but that it was traversed\r\nand, as far as practicable, inhabited by the ancient Setantii is evident\r\nfrom the several relics of them which have been discovered amongst the\r\npeat in modern days. Two or three canoes, consisting of light wooden\r\nframeworks, covered with hides, were found by a man named Jolly, about\r\nhalf a century ago, when cutting the “Main Dyke” of Marton Mere;[2]\r\nCeltic hammers, axes, and spears have also been taken out of the mosses\r\nin the district, all of which were doubtless originally the property of\r\nthe aboriginal Britons. The bay of Morecambe and the river Wyre acquired\r\ntheir distinctive appellations from the Setantii, the one being derived\r\nfrom the Celtic _gwyr_, pure or fresh, and the other from _mawr_, great,\r\nand _cam_, winding or bent.\r\n\r\nThe hardihood of the native Britons of these parts is attested by Dion\r\nCassius, who informs us that they lived on prey, hunting, and the fruits\r\nof trees, and were accustomed to brave hunger, cold, and all kinds of\r\ntoil, for they would “continue several days up to their chins in water,\r\nand bear hunger many days.” In the woods their habitations were wicker\r\nshelters, formed of the branches of trees interwoven together, and, in\r\nthe open grounds, clay or mud huts. They were indebted to the skins of\r\nanimals slain in the chase for such scanty covering as they cared to\r\nwear, and according to Cæsar and other writers, dyed their bodies with\r\nwoad, which produced a blue colour, and had long flowing hair, being\r\ncleanly shaved except the head and upper lip. That the power of endurance\r\npossessed by the Setantii, and the neighbouring Brigantes is not to be\r\nunderstood literally as expressed by Cassius may, we venture to think,\r\nbe taken for granted. It can scarcely be credited that the human frame\r\ncould ever be reduced or exalted to such an amphibious condition as to\r\nbe indifferent whether it passed a number of days on dry land or under\r\nwater; it seems more probable that in his description Cassius referred\r\nto the hunting and other expeditions of the inhabitants into the forests\r\nand morasses of the Fylde and similarly wooded and marshy tracts, where\r\nthere is no question the followers of the chase would be more or less in\r\na state of immersion during the whole time they were so engaged.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Setantii was Druidical, and their deities resembled\r\nthose of other heathen nations, such as the Romans and Greeks of that\r\nera, but differed in their names. Cæsar tells us that this order of\r\npriesthood was presided over by a superior, who was known as the chief\r\nDruid, and had almost unlimited authority over all the rest. The Druids\r\nwere settled at various points of the island, where they erected their\r\ntemples, but in addition to these principle stations, many of their order\r\nwere scattered amongst the native tribes of Britain, over which they\r\nappear to have exercised the functions and power of judges, arranging\r\nboth public and private disputes, and deciding all criminal cases. It\r\nwas part of the creed professed by the Setantii, to vow, when they were\r\nengaged in warfare, that they would, through the agency of the Druids,\r\nimmolate human victims as an atonement for slaughtered enemies, believing\r\nthat unless man’s life were given for man’s life, the divine anger of\r\nthe immortal Gods could not be appeased. There were other sacrifices of\r\nthe same kind instituted at regularly appointed seasons and on special\r\noccasions. The Setantii also believed in an immortal soul, but seem to\r\nhave had no idea of a higher state, as their priests inculcated the\r\ndoctrine that after death the soul was transported to another body,\r\n“imagining that by this the men were more effectually roused to valour,\r\nthe fear of death being taken away.”[3] Ornaments called “Druids’ eggs,”\r\nand worn only by these priests, have been found in the Fylde.\r\n\r\nHow Cæsar, in B.C. 54 and 55, invaded Britain a first and a second time,\r\nachieving at best an empty conquest, and how, after his death, the\r\nemperor Claudius sent over an army with a determination to exterminate\r\nthe Druids, and after thirty pitched battles, subdued province after\r\nprovince, is beyond the limits of this work to state, but as a connecting\r\nlink of the history of the country with that of our own county, and\r\nthat portion of it especially under examination, it may be stated that\r\nBritain was finally conquered by the Romans under Julius Agricola, and\r\nthat the best investigation of the subject leads to the opinion that the\r\ndistrict which we call Lancashire, was brought into subjection to the\r\nRoman conqueror in A.D. 79. A vigorous resistance was for long offered\r\nto the army of invaders in the territory of the Setantii by the natives\r\nunder the Brigantine chief Venutius, but the well drilled legions of the\r\nRomans, when commanded by Agricola, proved too formidable to be checked\r\nor broken by the wild, undisciplined valour of the Setantii. Tacitus,\r\nthe son-in-law of the general, informs us that early in the summer of\r\nA.D. 79, Agricola personally inspected his soldiers, and marked out many\r\nof the stations, one of which, either made at that time or later by the\r\nsame people, was situated at Kirkham, on the line of the Roman road\r\nrunning from the mouth of Wyre, which will be described hereafter. He\r\nexplored the estuaries and woods along the western coast of Lancashire,\r\nand harassed the enemy by sudden and frequent incursions. When the\r\nBrigantes and Setantii had been thoroughly overawed and disheartened by\r\nthe invincible Romans, Agricola stayed his operations in order to shew\r\nthem the blessings of peace, and in that way many towns which had bravely\r\nheld out were induced to surrender and give hostages. These places he\r\nsurrounded with guards and fortifications. The following winter was\r\npassed in endeavouring, by various incentives to pleasure, to subdue\r\nthe warlike nature of the Britons, thereby diminishing the danger of an\r\noutbreak, especially amongst such tribes as the Setantii, whose intrepid\r\nspirits had been so difficult to quell, and who were not likely to submit\r\nquietly to the yoke of the conqueror, unless some means were adopted to\r\nallure them by the charms of civilised luxury from their free field and\r\nforest mode of existence. Temples, courts of justice, and comfortable\r\nhabitations were first erected; the sons of the petty chiefs were next\r\ninstructed in the liberal arts, and Agricola professed to prefer the\r\ngenius of the Britons to the attainments of the Gauls. The Roman dress\r\nbecame the fashion, and the _toga_ was frequently worn. The “porch,\r\nluxurious baths, and elegant banquets” were regularly instituted, and by\r\ndegrees the crafty design of the Roman general was accomplished, and the\r\nvanquished Britons had ceased to be the hardy warriors of old.\r\n\r\nAbout one century after the subjugation of Britain by Agricola no less\r\nthan seven important Roman stations, or garrisoned places, had risen\r\nup in the county of Lancaster, and were situated at Manchester, Colne,\r\nWarrington, Lancaster, Walton-le-dale, Ribchester, and Overborough. The\r\nminor ones, such as Kirkham, supposing their sites to have been first\r\nbuilt upon in a season of warfare, subsequently became small settlements\r\nonly, and were, in all probability, unused as military depots. The rivers\r\nwhich flowed in the neighbourhood of the several encampments, terminated\r\nin three estuaries, denominated by Ptolemy,[4] the ancient geographer,\r\nin his book, completed in A.D. 130, the Seteia Æstuarium, the Moricambe\r\nÆstuarium, and the Belisama Æstuarium. The first of these estuaries is\r\ngenerally regarded as the mouth of the Dee, the second is identified with\r\nMorecambe Bay, and the third with the Ribble by some historians and the\r\nMersey by others. The same authority mentions also a Portus Setantiorum,\r\nwhich has been located on the banks of the Ribble, Lune, and Mersey, by\r\ndifferent antiquarians, but in the opinion of the most recent writers the\r\nancient harbour of the Setantii was situated at the mouth of the river\r\nWyre. Further reference to the Setantian port will be made in a later\r\npage of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nAt the shore margin of the warren at Fleetwood there was visible, about\r\nforty years ago, the abrupt and broken termination of a Roman road, which\r\ncould be traced across the sward, along the Naze below Burn Hall, and\r\nonward in the direction of Poulton. From that town it ran in a southerly\r\nline towards Staining, crossing Marton Mere, on its way, in the cutting\r\nof which its materials were very apparent, and lying on the low mossy\r\nlands to the depth of two yards in gravel. From Staining it proceeded to\r\nWeeton, and in a hollow near to the moss of that township, consisted of\r\nan immense stony embankment several yards in height; in the moss itself\r\nthe deep beds of gravel were distinctly observable, and from there the\r\nroad continued its course up the rising ground to Plumpton, the traces as\r\nusual being less obvious on the higher land. From Plumpton it travelled\r\ntowards the elevated site of a windmill between Weeton moss and Kirkham,\r\nat which point it turned suddenly, and joined the public road, running in\r\na continuous straight line towards the latter town. The greater part of\r\nthe long street of Kirkham is either upon or in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the old Roman road. From Kirkham the road directed its course towards\r\nLund church, somewhere in the neighbourhood of which it was joined by\r\nanother path formed by the same people and commencing at the Neb of the\r\nNaze near Freckleton.[5] Leaving Lund it ran through Lea on to Fulwood\r\nmoor, where it took the name of Watling street, and proceeded on to\r\nRibchester. This road has always been known in the Fylde as the Danes’\r\nPad, from a tradition that those pirates made use of it at a later period\r\nin their incursions into our district, visiting and ransacking Kirkham,\r\nPoulton, and other towns or hamlets of the unfortunate Saxons. Numerous\r\nrelics, chiefly of the Roman soldiery, have been dug or ploughed up at\r\ndifferent times out of the soil, bordering on the road, or found amongst\r\nthe pebbles of which it was composed, and amongst them may be mentioned\r\nspears, both British and Roman, horse shoes in abundance, several stone\r\nhammers, a battle axe, a broken sword, and ancient Roman coins, all\r\nof which were picked up along its line between Wyre mouth and Weeton.\r\nSeveral half-baked urns marked with dots, and pieces of rudely fashioned\r\npottery were discovered in an extensive barrow or cairn near Weeton-lane\r\nHeads, which was accidentally opened, and is now pointed out as the abode\r\nof the local hairy ghost or boggart. In the neighbourhood of Kirkham\r\nthere have been found many broken specimens of Roman pottery, stones\r\nprepared for building purposes, eight or ten urns, some containing ashes\r\nand beads, stone handmills for corn grinding, ancient coins, “Druids’\r\neggs,” axes, and horse shoes; in the fields near Dowbridge, where several\r\nof the above urns were discovered, there was found a flattened ivory\r\nneedle, about five or six inches long with a large eyelet. A cuirass was\r\nalso picked up on the banks of the Wyre; but the most interesting relic\r\nof antiquity is the boss or umbo of a shield, taken out of a ditch near\r\nKirkham, which will be fully described in the chapter devoted to that\r\ntownship. The Romans were accustomed to make three kinds of roads, the\r\nfirst of which, called the Viæ Militares, were constructed during active\r\nwarfare, when they were engaged in pushing their way into the territory\r\nof the enemy, and easy unobstructed communication between their various\r\nencampments became a matter of the utmost importance. The second, or\r\npublic roads, were formed to facilitate commerce in time of peace; and\r\nthe third were narrower paths, called private roads. The county of\r\nLancaster was intersected by no less than four important Roman routes,\r\ntwo of which ran from north to south, and two traversed the land from\r\nwest to east. The course of one road, and perhaps the best constructed\r\nof the whole four, we have just followed out; of the remainder, the\r\nfirst, commencing at Carlisle, passed near Garstang and Preston, crossed\r\nthe Irwell at Old Trafford, and maintaining its southerly direction,\r\nultimately arrived at Kinderton, in Cheshire. The second extended\r\nfrom Overborough to Slack, in Yorkshire, passing on its way through\r\nRibchester, the Ribble, Radcliffe, Prestwich, and Newton Heath; whilst\r\nthe third had its origin at a ford on the Mersey, in close proximity to\r\nWarrington, and from that spot could be traced through Barton, Eccles,\r\nManchester, Moston, Chadderton, Royton, and Littleborough, thence over\r\nRumbles Moor to Ilkley, where was located the temple of the goddess\r\nVerbeia. It is conjectured that these roads, which consisted for the most\r\npart of pavement and deep beds of gravel, were begun, or at least marked\r\nout, by Agricola during the time he was occupied in the subjugation of\r\nLancashire, and if this very probable hypothesis be correct the course\r\ntaken by that general in his exploration of the woods of the Fylde, and\r\nthe estuaries of Morecambe and the Ribble is clearly indicated by the\r\ndirection of the ancient path communicating with the mouth of Wyre and\r\nthe Naze.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the third century the Roman governor of Britain found\r\nit necessary to obtain the personal co-operation of Severus, in order\r\nto put an effectual check to the repeated outbreaks of the natives; in\r\nA.D. 207, that emperor having landed and established his head-quarters\r\nat York, a considerable force marched northwards under his leadership\r\nto punish the revolting tribes, and it is surmised that the curious\r\nroad, running across the mosses of Rawcliffe, Stalmine, and Pilling,\r\nwas constructed by the legionaries whilst on this tour. The pathway\r\nalluded to, and commonly known as Kate’s Pad, was deeply situated in the\r\nmosses, and had apparently been formed by fastening riven oak planks\r\non to sleepers of the same material, secured and held stationary by\r\nmeans of pins or rivets driven into the marl a little above which they\r\nrested. Its width was about twenty inches, but in some places rather\r\nmore.[6] Herodian, in describing the expedition of Severus to quell the\r\ninsurrection of the Briton, says:—“He more especially endeavoured to\r\nrender the marshy places stable by means of causeways, that his soldiers,\r\ntreading with safety, might pass them, and having firm footing fight\r\nto advantage. In these the natives are accustomed to swim and traverse\r\nabout, being immersed as high as their waists: for going naked as to the\r\ngreater part of their bodies they contemn the mud. His army having passed\r\nbeyond the rivers and fortresses which defended the Roman territory,\r\nthere were frequent attacks and skirmishes, and retreats on the side\r\nof the barbarians. To these indeed flight was an easy matter, and they\r\nlay hidden in the thickets and marshes through their local knowledge;\r\nall which things being adverse to the Romans served to protract the\r\nwar.” There can be no doubt that, when the path, which consisted in some\r\nparts of one huge tree and in others of two or more, was formed, timber\r\nmust have been very plentiful in the vicinity, and at the present day\r\nnumbers of tree trunks of large size are to be found in the mosses,\r\nfurther corroborating the conclusions arrived at by Leyland, whose words\r\nhave already been quoted, and Holinshed, who wrote:—“The whole countrie\r\nof Lancaster has beene forests heretofore.” An iron fibula, a pewter\r\nwine-strainer, a wooden drinking bowl, hooped with two brass bands and\r\nhaving two handles, a brass stirrup, and other relics have been taken\r\nout of the moss fields; and in the same neighbourhood an anvil, several\r\npieces of thin sheet-brass, and a pair of shears were discovered in a\r\nditch.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 416 the Romans finally removed themselves from our island,\r\ntaking with them many of the brave youths of Britain, and leaving the\r\ncountry in the hands of a people whose inactive habits, acquired under\r\ntheir dominion, had rendered them ignorant of the art and unfit for the\r\nhardships of warfare. According to Ethelwerd’s Chronicle, in the year 418\r\nthose few of the Roman race who were left in Britain, not being able to\r\nput up with the manifold insults of the natives, buried their treasure in\r\npits, hoping that at some future day, when all animosity had subsided,\r\nthey would be able to recover it and live peaceably, but such a fortunate\r\nconsummation never arrived, and weary at length of waiting, they\r\nassembled on the coasts and “spreading their canvass to the wind, sought\r\nan exile on the shores of Gaul.” The Saxon Chronicle says:—“This year,\r\nA.D. 418, the Romans collected all the treasures that were in Britain,\r\nand some they hid in the earth so that no one since has been able to find\r\nthem; and some they carried with them into Gaul.” It is far from unlikely\r\nthat the silver denarii, discovered in 1840 by some brickmakers near\r\nRossall, and amounting to four hundred coins of Trajan, Hadrian, Titus,\r\nVespasian, Domitian, Antonius, Severus, Sabina, etc., were deposited in\r\nthat spot for security by one of those much harassed Romans, previous to\r\nhis departure from our coast.\r\n\r\nA prize so easily to be obtained as Britain in its practically\r\nunprotected state appeared, was not long in attracting the covetousness\r\nof the neighbouring Picts and Scots, who came down in thousands from\r\nthe north, forced their way beyond the Roman Wall erected by Hadrian,\r\noccupied the fortresses and towns, and spread ruin and devastation in\r\ntheir track. The northern counties were the chief sufferers from these\r\nruthless marauders. Cumberland, Yorkshire, and Lancashire, were ravaged\r\nand plundered to such an extent that had it not been for the seasonable\r\nassistance of the Saxons, the whole country they embrace would have been\r\nutterly devastated and almost depopulated. Gildas, the earliest British\r\nhistorian[7], born about 500, described our land before the incursions of\r\nthe Picts and Scots as abounding in pleasant hills, spreading pastures,\r\ncultivated fields, silvery streams, and snow-white sands, and spoke of\r\nthe roofs of the buildings in the twenty-eight cities of the kingdom as\r\n“raised aloft with threatening hugeness.” We may readily conceive how\r\nthis picture of peace and prosperity was marred and ruined, as far as the\r\nthree counties above-named were concerned, by the destroying hand of the\r\nnorthern nation. The British towns were still surrounded by the fortified\r\nwalls and embattled towers, built by the Romans, but the unfortunate\r\ninhabitants, so long unaccustomed to\r\n\r\n  “The close-wedged battle and the din of war,”\r\n\r\nand deprived of their armed soldiers and valiant youth, were panic\r\nstricken by the fierce onslaughts of the Scottish tribes, and fled before\r\ntheir advancing arms. Some idea of the critical and truly pitiable\r\ncondition to which they were reduced may be gleaned from the tenor of an\r\nappeal for help sent by them to their old rulers, which the author last\r\nquoted has preserved as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The Lamentation of the Britons unto Agitius, thrice Consul.\r\n\r\n  “The barbarians drive us to the sea, the sea drives us back to\r\n  the barbarians. Thus of two kinds of death, one or other must be\r\n  our choice, either to be swallowed up by the waves or butchered\r\n  by the sword.”\r\n\r\nThe Romans were fully occupied with enemies of their own, the Goths, and\r\nconsequently were unprepared to offer any assistance to the Britons,\r\nwhose position was shortly afterwards rendered additionally wretched\r\nby famine and its attendant evils. At that period both the state of\r\nLancashire itself and of its inhabitants must have been exceedingly\r\ndeplorable—the country ravaged and still exposed to the depredations and\r\nbarbarities of the enemy, had now become a prey to a fearful dearth. Many\r\nof the descendants of the old Setantii, unable any further to support\r\nthe double contest, yielded themselves up to the Picts and Scots in\r\nthe hope of obtaining food to appease the fierce cravings of hunger,\r\nwhilst others, more hardy, but outnumbered and weakened by long fasts,\r\nsought refuge in the woods and such other shelters as the neighbourhood\r\nafforded. Disappointed in the Romans, the Britons applied for aid to\r\nthe Saxons, or Anglo-Saxons, a mixed and piratical tribe, dwelling on\r\nthe banks of the German Ocean, and composed of Jutes, Angles, and pure\r\nSaxons. The men of this race are described as determined, fearless, and\r\nof great size, with blue eyes, ruddy complexions, and yellow streaming\r\nhair. They were well practised in warfare, and armed with battle-axes,\r\nswords, spears, and maces. Their chief god was Odin, or Woden, and their\r\nheaven Valhalla. About one thousand of these warriors, under the command\r\nof Hengist and Horsa, embarked in three vessels, built of hides, and\r\ncalled _Cyulæ_ or _Ceols_. They landed on the coast of Kent, about the\r\nyear 449, and by the direction of Vortigern, king of the Island, marched\r\nnorthwards until they arrived near York, where an encounter of great\r\nmoment took place, terminating in the utter defeat of the Picts and\r\nScots. Inspirited by so early and signal a success the Saxons followed\r\nup their advantage with alacrity, drove the baleful marauders out of the\r\ncounties of Lancaster and York, and finally compelled them to retreat\r\nacross the frontier into their own territory. After having rescued the\r\nkingdom from these invaders the Saxons settled at York and Manchester,\r\nand not only evinced no sign of returning to their own country, but even\r\ndespatched messengers for fresh troops. This strange and suspicious\r\nconduct on the part of their allies excited considerable alarm and\r\nanxiety amongst the Britons, who practically expressed their disapproval\r\nby refusing to make any provision for the reinforcements. After a\r\nshort interval a mandate was issued to the Saxon leader ordering him to\r\nwithdraw his army from the soil of Britain. Incensed and stimulated by\r\nsuch decisive action Hengist determined at once to carry out the object\r\nhe had cherished from the first—the subjugation of the people and the\r\nseizure of the island. Having procured a further supply of men under\r\nhis son Octa, he established them in the country of the Brigantes, and\r\nalmost immediately invited the native nobles to a friendly conference\r\nwith his chiefs on Salisbury plain. The Britons, who were far from\r\nsuspecting his treacherous design, attended the assembly unarmed, and in\r\nthat defenceless state fell an easy prey to their Saxon hosts, who in\r\nthe midst of feasting and revelry, brutally massacred the whole of their\r\nguests. Successful in his cowardly and murderous stratagem, Hengist took\r\npossession of the southern counties, whilst his son Octa maintained his\r\nsway over the Brigantine province of Northumbria, in which the Fylde was\r\nincluded, as intimated at the beginning of the chapter.\r\n\r\nThe ancient warlike spirit of the Setantii, which had lain almost\r\ndormant for centuries, was once more thoroughly aroused in the natives\r\nof Lancashire, and a determined and valiant opposition offered by them\r\nto Octa and his army. Overborough capitulated only when its inhabitants\r\nwere worn out by fatigue and famine, whilst Warrington and Manchester\r\nsustained severe and protracted sieges before they fell into the hands\r\nof the enemy. Nennius, another early historian, who was born towards the\r\nend of the sixth century, informs us that the famous King Arthur and his\r\nsixty Knights of the Round Table worsted the Saxons in twelve successive\r\nbattles, four of which were fought on the banks of the Douglas, near\r\nWigan. In those conflicts our county was well and effectively represented\r\nin the person of Paulinus, the commander of the right wing of the army,\r\nwho after many brave and sanguinary struggles overthrew the hitherto\r\nunconquered Octa, and for a time, at least, delivered the Fylde and other\r\nparts of Northumbria from the rule of the Saxons. This gallant soldier\r\nwas the offspring of a union between a Roman warrior and a British\r\nmaiden, who had established themselves in Manchester. The chieftain\r\nElla, however, compelled the Britons to submission, and assumed the\r\ngovernment over part of Northumbria. Clusters of Saxon huts, soon growing\r\ninto villages, now sprang up on the soil of the Fylde, which under the\r\nwood-levelling and marsh-draining Romans had lost much of its swampy and\r\nforest characters and been transformed into a more habitable locality. We\r\nneed have little hesitation in conjecturing that the valour displayed by\r\nthe inhabitants of our county was greatly increased, and often rendered\r\nalmost desperate, by the knowledge that if their land were subdued\r\nand occupied by the Saxons the key, if it may so be called, to their\r\nmountainous strongholds would be lost, and the line of communication\r\nbetween them impassably and irretrievably obstructed; for the venerable\r\nBede[8] tells us that a portion of the Britons fled to the hills and\r\nfells of Furness, and we are aware that a much larger share sought refuge\r\namongst the mountains of Wales, lying to the south-west, and visible\r\nfrom the shores of the Fylde. Others escaped over to Armorica in France,\r\nand from them it acquired the name of Brittany. Additional evidence that\r\nFurness was peopled by the Britons, even for more than two centuries\r\nafter the arrival of the Saxons, is to be found in the writings of\r\nCamden, who says:—“The Britons in Furness lived securely for a long time,\r\nrelying upon those fortifications, wherewith nature had guarded them; for\r\nthat the Britons lived here in the 228th year after the coming of the\r\nSaxons, is plain from hence; that at that time Egfrid, the king of the\r\nNorthumbrians, gave to St. Cuthbert the land called Cartmell, and all the\r\nBritons in it; for so it is related in his life.”\r\n\r\nThe Saxons were great idolaters, and soon crowded the country with their\r\ntemples and images. The deities they worshipped have furnished us with\r\nnames for the different days of the week, thus Sunday is derived from\r\n_Sunan_ the sun, Monday from _Monan_ the moon, Tuesday from _Tuisco_\r\na German god, Wednesday from _Woden_, Thursday from _Thor_ or _Thur_,\r\nFriday from _Friga_, and Saturday from _Seater_.\r\n\r\nWhen the nation was once more at peace, all the towns and castles which\r\nhad been damaged during the wars were repaired, and others, which had\r\nbeen destroyed, rebuilt. The Britons were brought by degrees to look\r\nwith less disfavour on their conquerors, and as time progressed adopted\r\ntheir heathenish faith and offered up prayer at the shrines of the same\r\nidols, drifting back into darkness and forgetting or ignoring those true\r\ndoctrines which, it is said, had been declared and expounded to them at\r\nthe very commencement of the Christian era. According to Clemens Romanus\r\nand Theodoret, the Apostle Paul was one of the earliest preachers of the\r\nGospel in Britain, but whatever amount of truth there may be in this\r\nstatement, it is certain that at the Council of Arles in A.D. 314, and\r\nten years later at that of Nicene, three British bishops were present.\r\nAll traces of their former religion quickly vanished from amongst the\r\nnative population of Lancashire under the pagan influence of their\r\nrulers; and it was during that unhallowed age that Gregory, surnamed the\r\nGreat, and afterwards pontiff, being attracted by the handsome appearance\r\nof some youths exposed for sale in the market-place at Rome, and finding,\r\non inquiry, that they came from the kingdom of Deira, in Britain,\r\ndetermined to send over Augustine and Paulinus to Christianise the\r\ninhabitants. In 596 Augustine landed with forty missionaries on the coast\r\nof Kent, the king became a convert, and the new faith spread rapidly\r\nthroughout the island. Thousands were baptised by Paulinus in the river\r\nSwale, then called the Northumbrian Jordan, and the waters of Ribble were\r\nalso resorted to for the performance of similar ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Roman mission initiated a fresh epoch in the\r\necclesiastical history of the county, monasteries and religious houses\r\nsprang up in different parts, and at the consecration of the church and\r\nmonastery of Ripon, lands bordering on the Ribble, in Hacmundernesse\r\n(Amounderness), in Gedene, and in Duninge were presented amongst other\r\ngifts to that foundation. Paulinus was created bishop of Northumbria in\r\n627, and it is to his ministrations and pious example that the conversion\r\nof the inhabitants of the Fylde and vicinal territory is generally\r\nattributed. The Saxon Chronicle records, however, that in 565 Columba\r\n“came from Scotia (Ireland) to preach to the Picts.” Columba was born\r\nat Garten, a village in county Donegal, and according to Selden and\r\nother learned writers, the religion professed by him and the Culdees, as\r\nthe priests of his order were called, was strictly Presbyterian. Bede\r\nwrites:—“They preached only such works of charity and piety as they could\r\nlearn from prophetical, evangelical, and apostolic writings.” Columba\r\nestablished a monastery at Iona. Dr. Giles states that “the ancient name\r\nof Iona was I or Hi, or Aoi, which was Latinised into Hyona, or Iona; the\r\ncommon name of it now is I-colum-kill, the Island of Colum of the Cells.”\r\nBishop Turner affirms that “the lands in Amounderness, on the Ribble,”\r\nwere first presented to a Culdee abbot, named Eata, on the erection of\r\na monastery at Ripon, but that before the building was finished he was\r\ndismissed and St. Wilfred made abbot of Ripon, sometime before 661. If\r\nthe foregoing assertion be correct there is certain evidence that the\r\nCuldee doctrines were also promulgated in Lancashire, and doubtless in\r\nour own district, at that early date. Bede seems to support such an\r\nassumption when he states that the Ripon lands were originally granted to\r\nthose who professed the creed of the Picts to build a monastery upon, and\r\ndid not pass to St. Wilfred, bishop of Northumbria, until afterwards, in\r\n705, when he re-edified the monastery. Whatever discrepancies may exist\r\nas to the exact period and manner in which Christianity was introduced\r\nor revived in the bosoms of our forefathers, there is ample and reliable\r\nproof that the majority of them had embraced the true faith about the\r\nmiddle of the seventh century, when churches were probably erected in the\r\nhamlets of Kirkham and St. Michael’s-on-Wyre.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 936 the Hundred of Amounderness was granted by Athelstan\r\nto the See of York:—“I, Athelstan, king of the Angles, etc., freely give\r\nto the Omnipotent God, and to the blessed Apostle Peter, at his church\r\nin the diocese of York, a certain section of land, not small in extent,\r\nin the place which the inhabitants call Amounderness,” etc. The Hundred\r\nof Amounderness when this grant was made must have been pretty thickly\r\npeopled, for Athelstan states that he “purchased it at no small price,”\r\nand land at that date was valued chiefly by the number of its residents.\r\nHere it will be convenient to observe that in some instances, as in\r\nthat of Amounderness, the Hundreds acquired the additional titles of\r\nWapentakes, and, in explanation of the origin of the term, we learn from\r\n“Thoresby Ducat Leodiens,” that when a person received the government of\r\na Wapentake, he was met, at the appointed time and usual place, by the\r\nelder portion of the inhabitants, and, after dismounting from his horse,\r\nhe held up his spear and took a pledge of fealty from all according to\r\nthe usual custom. Whoever came touched his spear with theirs, and by\r\nsuch contact of arms they were confirmed in one common interest. So from\r\n_wœpnu_, a weapon, and _tac_, a touch, or _taccare_, to confirm, the\r\nHundreds were called _Wapentakes_. Traces of the above antique ceremony\r\nare still to be met with in the peculiar form of expression used when the\r\ntenantry and others are summoned by the manorial lords of Amounderness to\r\nattend their court-barons and court-leets.\r\n\r\nThe Heptarchy, established about 550, and consisting of seven sovereign\r\nstates, was finally abolished in 830, and Egbert became king over the\r\nwhole island. The province of Northumbria, more especially the Fylde\r\nand tracts of adjoining territory, had at that date been the scene of\r\nirregular and intermittent warfare during the previous forty years.\r\nLancashire had suffered cruelly from the visitations of the Northmen,\r\nor Danes, who spared neither age, sex, nor condition in their furious\r\nsallies. In the years 787, 794, and 800, these pirates invaded the soil,\r\nravaged the country, butchered the inhabitants, and on the last occasion\r\nshot Edmund, the king of the West Saxons, to death with arrows, because\r\nhe refused to renounce the Christian faith and embrace the errors of\r\nheathenism. Egbert was no sooner seated on the throne than the Danes\r\nre-appeared off the coasts, and there can be little doubt that some\r\nof their bands made their way down the western shore of the island,\r\nentered the Bay of Morecambe, and, guided by the old Roman road near\r\nthe mouth of the Wyre, pushed onwards into and through the heart of the\r\nFylde, plundering and laying waste villages, hamlets, and every trace\r\nof agriculture in their path. “The name of the _Danes’ Pad_,” says Mr.\r\nThornber, “given to the Roman agger is and ever will be an everlasting\r\nmemorial of their ravages and atrocities in this quarter.”[9] In addition\r\nit may be stated that many warlike relics of the Danes have been found\r\nalong the road here indicated, and that the names of the Great and\r\nLittle Knots in the channel of Wyre, opposite Fleetwood, were of pure\r\nScandinavian derivation, and signified “round heaps,” probably, of\r\nstones. These mounds were, during the formation of the harbour entrance,\r\neither destroyed or disfigured beyond recognition. Several localities,\r\nalso, along the sea boundary of the Fylde bear Danish denominations,\r\nwhich will be treated of hereafter. In 869 Lancashire was again visited\r\nby a dreadful famine, and many of the people in every part of the\r\ncounty fell victims either to the dearth itself or the fatal disorders\r\nfollowing in its train. Those who were fortunate enough to escape the\r\nwholesale destruction of the scourge suffered so severely from the\r\nmerciless massacres of the Danes that at the accession of Alfred the\r\nGreat, in 871, our Hundred was but sparsely populated. During the reign\r\nof that illustrious monarch England was divided into counties, which\r\nagain were subdivided into Hundreds. Each Hundred was composed of ten\r\nTithings, and each Tithing of ten Freeholders and their families. When\r\nthis division of the kingdom was effected the south-western portion of\r\nthe old province of Northumbria was separated from the remainder, and\r\nreceived the name of _Lonceshire_, from the capital _Loncaster_, the\r\ncastle on the _Lone_, or Lune. Alfred, as we are told by his biographer\r\nAsser, did much to improve the condition of his subjects both for peace\r\nand war; referring to their illiterate state, on his accession the king\r\nhimself says:—“When I took the kingdom there were very few on the south\r\nside of the river Humber, the most improved portion of England, who could\r\nunderstand their daily prayers in English, or translate a letter from\r\nthe Latin. I think they were not many beyond the Humber. There were so\r\nfew that I cannot, indeed, recollect one single instance on the south\r\nof the Thames.”[10] After suffering a defeat at Wilton almost at the\r\noutset of his career, Alfred surprised and overthrew the Danish camp at\r\nEddington; Guthrum, their leader, and the whole of his followers were\r\ntaken prisoners, but afterwards liberated and permitted to colonise East\r\nAnglia, and subsequently Northumbria, an act of clemency which entailed\r\nmost disastrous consequences upon the different sections of the latter\r\nprovince. The Fylde now became the legalised abode of numbers of the\r\nnorthern race, between whom and the Saxon settlers perpetual strife was\r\ncarried on; in addition the restless and covetous spirit of the new\r\ncolonists constantly prompted them to raids beyond the legitimate limits\r\nof their territory, rebellions amongst themselves, and conspiracies\r\nagainst the king; insurrection followed insurrection, and it was not\r\nuntil Athelstan had inflicted a decisive blow upon the Danish forces,\r\nand brought the seditious province of Northumbria under his own more\r\nimmediate dominion, that a short lull of peace was obtained. In the reign\r\nof his successor, however, they broke out again, and having been once\r\nmore reduced to order, agreed to take the name of Christians, abjure\r\ntheir false gods, and live quietly henceforth. These promises, made to\r\nappease the anger of Edmund, were only temporarily observed, and their\r\nturbulent natures were never tranquilised until Canute, the first Danish\r\nking, ascended the throne of England in 1017. The Norse line of monarchs\r\ncomprised only three, and terminated in 1041. Reverting to Athelstan\r\nand the Danes we find that about ten years after the subjugation of the\r\nlatter in 926, as recorded in the Saxon Chronicle, Anlaf, a noted Danish\r\nchieftain, made a vigorous attempt to regain Northumbria. The site of the\r\nglorious battle where this ambitious project was overthrown and the army\r\nof Anlaf routed and driven to seek refuge in flight from the shore, on\r\nwhich they had but a short time previously landed exulting in a prospect\r\nof conquest and plunder, is a matter of dispute, and nothing authentic\r\ncan be discovered concerning it beyond the fact that the name of the\r\ntown or district where the forces met was Brunandune or Brunanburgh, and\r\nwas situated in the province of Northumbria. The former orthography is\r\nused in Ethelwerd’s Chronicle:—“A fierce battle was fought against the\r\nbarbarians at Brunandune, whereof that fight is called great even to the\r\npresent day; then the barbarian tribes were defeated and domineer no\r\nlonger; they are driven beyond the ocean.” Burn, in Thornton township,\r\nis one of the several rival localities which claim to have witnessed the\r\nsanguinary conflict. In the Domesday Survey, Burn was written _Brune_,\r\nand it also comprises a rising ground or _Dune_, which seem to imply some\r\nconnection with _Brunandune_. From an ancient song or poem, bearing the\r\ndate 937, it is clear that the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset, and\r\nthat at night-fall Anlaf and the remnant of his followers, being utterly\r\ndiscomfited, escaped from the coast in the manner before described. This\r\ncircumstance also upholds the pretentions of Burn, as it is situated\r\nclose to the banks of the Wyre, and at a very short distance both from\r\nthe Irish Sea and Morecambe Bay, as well as being in the direct line\r\nof the road called Danes’ Pad, the track usually taken by the Northmen\r\nin former incursions into the Fylde and county. In addition it may be\r\nmentioned that tradition affirms that a large quantity of human bones\r\nwere ploughed up in a field between Burn and Poulton about a century\r\nago. Sharon Turner says:—“It is singular that the position of this\r\nfamous battle is not yet ascertained. The Saxon song says it was at\r\nBrunanburgh; Ethelwerd, a contemporary, names the place Brunandune. These\r\nof course are the same place, but where is it?”[11] Having done our best\r\nto suggest or rather renew an answer presenting several points worthy of\r\nconsideration to Mr. Turner’s query, we will, before bidding farewell to\r\nthe subject, give our readers a translated extract from the old song to\r\nwhich allusion has been made:—\r\n\r\n  Athelstan king,\r\n  Of earls the Lord,\r\n  Of Heroes the bracelet giver,\r\n  And his brother eke,\r\n  Edmund Atheling,\r\n  Life-long glory,\r\n  In battle won,\r\n  With edges of swords,\r\n  Near Brunanburgh.\r\n  The field was dyed\r\n  With warriors blood,\r\n  Since the sun, up\r\n  At morning tide,\r\n  Mighty planet,\r\n  Gilded o’er grounds,\r\n  God’s candle bright,\r\n  The eternal Lord’s,\r\n  Till the noble creature\r\n  Sank to her rest.\r\n  ...\r\n  West Saxons onwards\r\n  Throughout the day,\r\n  In numerous bands\r\n  Pursued the footsteps\r\n  Of the loathed nations.\r\n  They hewed the fugitives,\r\n  Behind, amain,\r\n  With swords mill-sharp.\r\n  Mercians refused not\r\n  The hard-hand play\r\n  To any heroes,\r\n  Who with Anlaf,\r\n  Over the ocean,\r\n  In the ship’s bosom,\r\n  This land sought.\r\n  ...\r\n  There was made to flee\r\n  The Northmens’ chieftain,\r\n  By need constrained,\r\n  To the ships prow\r\n  With a little band.\r\n  The bark drove afloat.\r\n  The king departed.\r\n  On the fallow flood\r\n  His life he preserved.\r\n  The Northmen departed\r\n  In their nailed barks\r\n  On roaring ocean.\r\n\r\nAthelstan, in order to encourage commerce and agriculture, enacted that\r\nany of the humbler classes, called Ceorls, who had crossed the sea\r\nthrice with their own merchandise, or who, individually, possessed five\r\nhides of land, a bell-house, a church, a kitchen, and a separate office\r\nin the king’s hall, should be raised to the privileged rank of Thane.\r\nSometime in the interval between the death of this monarch, in 941, and\r\nthe arrival of William the Conqueror, the Hundred of Amounderness had\r\nbeen relinquished by the See of York, probably owing to frequent wars and\r\ndisturbances having so ruined the country and thinned the inhabitants\r\nthat the grant had ceased to be profitable.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of the Saxon era the clergy claimed one tenth or\r\ntithe of the produce of the soil, and exemption for their monasteries\r\nand churches from all taxations. These demands were resisted for a\r\nconsiderable period, but at length were conceded by Ethelwulf “for the\r\nhonour of God, and for his own everlasting salvation.”[12] In 1002, it\r\nis recorded in the Saxon Chronicle, that “the king (Ethelred) ordered\r\nall the Danish men who were in England to be slain, because it was made\r\nknown to him that they would treacherously bereave him of his life,\r\nand after that have his kingdom without any gainsaying.” In accordance\r\nwith the royal mandate, which was circulated in secret, the Anglo-Saxon\r\npopulace of the villages and farms of the Fylde, as elsewhere, rose\r\nat the appointed day upon the unprepared and unsuspecting Northmen,\r\nbarbarously massacring old and young, male and female alike. Great must\r\nhave been the slaughter in districts like our own, where from the Danes\r\nhaving been established for so many generations and its proximity to\r\nthe coast and the estuaries of Wyre and Ribble, a safe landing and a\r\nfriendly soil would be insured, and attract numbers of their countrymen\r\nfrom Scandinavia. The vengeance of Sweyn, king of Denmark, was speedy and\r\ncomplete; the country of Northumbria was laid waste, towns and hamlets\r\nwere pillaged and destroyed, and for four years all that fire and sword,\r\nspurred on by hatred and revenge, could effect in depopulating and\r\ndevastating a land was accomplished in Lancashire, and the neighbouring\r\ncounties, by the enraged Dane. Half a century later than the events just\r\nnarrated, earl Tosti, the brother of Harold, who forfeited his life and\r\nkingdom to the Norman invaders on the field of Hastings, was chosen duke\r\nof Northumbria. The seat of the new ruler has not been discovered, but\r\nas far as his personal association with the Fylde is concerned it will\r\nbe sufficient to state that almost on its boundaries, in the township\r\nof Preston, he held six hundred acres of cultivated soil, to which all\r\nthe lands and villages of Amounderness were tributary. As a governor\r\nTosti proved himself both brutal and oppressive. In a very limited\r\nspace of time his tyrannical and merciless conduct goaded his subjects\r\nto rebellion, and with one consent they ejected him from his dukedom\r\nand elected earl Morcar in his stead, a step commended and confirmed by\r\nHarold, when the unjust severity of his brother had been made known to\r\nhim. Tosti embraced the Norman cause, and fell at the head of a Norwegian\r\nforce in an engagement which took place at Standford a few months before\r\nthe famous and eventful battle of Hastings.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced briefly the history of the Fylde through a period of\r\neleven hundred years, and before entering on the era which dates from the\r\naccession of William the Conqueror, it will be well to review the traces\r\nand influences of the three dissimilar races, which have at different\r\nepochs usurped and settled on the territory of the old Setantii; our\r\nreference is, of course, to the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Danes. Under\r\nthe first, great advances were made in civilisation; clearings were\r\neffected in the woods, the marshes were trenched, and lasting lines\r\nof communication were established between the various stations and\r\nencampments. The peaceful arts were cultivated, and agriculture made\r\nconsiderable progress, corn even, from some parts of Britain, being\r\nexported to the continent. Remains of the Roman occupation are to\r\nbe observed in the names of a few towns, as Colne and Lincoln, from\r\n_Colonia_, a Colony, also Chester and Lancaster, from _Castra_, a Camp,\r\nas well as in relics like those enumerated earlier. The word “street” is\r\nderived from _Stratum_, a layer, covering, or pavement. Their festival\r\nof Flora originated our May-day celebrations, and the paraphernalia of\r\nmarriage, including the ring, veil, gifts, bride-cake, bridesmaids,\r\nand groomsmen, are Roman; so also are the customs of strewing flowers\r\nupon graves, and wearing black in time of mourning. That the Romans had\r\nmany stations in the Fylde is improbable, but that they certainly had\r\none in the township of Kirkham is shown by the number and character\r\nof the relics found there. This settlement would seem to have been a\r\nfairly populous one, if an opinion may be formed from the quantity of\r\ncinereal urns discovered at various times, in which had been deposited\r\nthe cremated remains of Romans, who had spent their days and done good\r\nservice in levelling the forests and developing the resources of the\r\nFylde. The traffic over the Roman road through the district must have\r\nbeen almost continuous, to judge from the abundance of horse-shoes and\r\nother matters picked up along its route, and whether the harbour of the\r\nSetantii was on Wyre, Ribble, or elsewhere, it is evident from the course\r\ntaken by the well constructed path that something of importance, say a\r\nfavourable spot for embarcation or debarcation, attracted the inhabitants\r\nacross the soil of the Fylde towards its north-west boundary. Now arises\r\nthe question what was the boundary here denoted, and in reply we venture\r\nto suggest that the extent of this district, in both a northerly and\r\nwesterly direction, was much greater in ancient days than it is in our\r\nown, and that the Lune formed its highest boundary, whilst its seaward\r\nlimits, opposite Rossall, were carried out to a distance of nearly eight\r\nmiles beyond the existing coast, and comprised what is now denominated\r\nShell Wharf, a bank so shallowly covered at low water spring tides that\r\nhuge boulders become visible all over it. Novel as such a theory may at\r\nfirst sight appear, there is much that can be advanced in support of it.\r\nFrom about the point in Morecambe Bay, near the foot of Wyre Lighthouse,\r\nwhere the stream of Wyre meets that of Lune at right angles, there is\r\nthe commencement of a long deep channel, apparently continuous with\r\nthe bed of the latter river as defined by its sandbanks, which extends\r\nout into the Irish Sea for rather more than seven miles west of the\r\nmouth of Morecambe Bay, at Rossall Point. This channel, called “Lune\r\nDeep,” is described on the authorised charts as being in several places\r\ntwenty-seven fathoms deep, in others rather less, and at its somewhat\r\nabrupt termination twenty-three fathoms. Throughout the entire length\r\nits boundaries are well and clearly marked, and its sudden declivity\r\nis described by the local mariners as being “steep as a house side.”\r\nRegarding this curious phenomenon from every available point of view,\r\nit seems more probable to us that so long and perfect a channel was\r\nformed at an early period, when the river Lune was, as we conjecture,\r\ncontinued from its present mouth, at Heysham Point, through green plains,\r\nnow the Bay of Lancaster, in the direction and to the distance of “Lune\r\nDeep,” than that it was excavated by the current of Lune, as it exists\r\nto-day, after mingling with the waters of Morecambe and Wyre. The course\r\nand completeness of Wyre channel from Fleetwood, between the sandbanks\r\ncalled Bernard’s Wharf and North Wharf, to its point of junction with\r\nthe stream from Lancaster, prove satisfactorily that at one time the\r\nformer river was a tributary of the Lune. Other evidence can be brought\r\nforward of the theory we are wishful to establish—that the southern\r\nportion of Morecambe Bay, from about Heysham Point, bearing the name of\r\nLancaster Bay, as well as “Shell Wharf” was about the era of the Romans,\r\ndry or, at least, marshy land watered by the Wyre and Lune, the latter\r\nof which would open on the west coast immediately into the Irish Sea.\r\nIf the reader refer to a map of Lancashire he will see at once that the\r\nsmaller bay has many appearances of having been added to the larger one,\r\nand that its floor is formed by a continuous line of banks, uncovered\r\neach ebb tide and intersected only by the channels of Wyre and Lune. The\r\nLand Mark, at Rossall Point, has been removed several times owing to the\r\nincursions of the sea, and within the memory of the living generation\r\nwide tracts of soil, amounting to more than a quarter of a mile westward,\r\nhave been swallowed up on that part of the coast, as the strong currents\r\nof the rising tides have swept into the bay; and in such manner would\r\nthe land about the estuary of “Lune Deep,” that is the original river\r\nof Lune, be washed away. As the encroachments of the sea progressed,\r\nthe channel of the river would be gradually widened and deepened to the\r\npresent dimensions of the “Deep”; the stream of Wyre would by degrees be\r\nbrought more immediately under the tidal influence, and in proportion\r\nas the Lune was absorbed into the bay, so would its tributary lose its\r\nshallowness and insignificance, and become expanded to a more important\r\nand navigable size. About the time that “Lune Deep” had ceased to exist\r\nas a river, and become part of the bay, the overcharged banks of the Wyre\r\nwould have yielded up their super-abundance of waters over the districts\r\nnow marked by Bernard’s Wharf and North Wharf, and subsequently, as the\r\nwaves continued their incursions, inundations would increase, until\r\nfinally the whole territory, forming the site of Lancaster Bay, would be\r\nsubmerged and appropriated by the rapacious hosts of Neptune. The “Shell\r\nWharf” would be covered in a manner exactly similar to the more recently\r\nlost fields off Rossall; and as illustrations of land carried away from\r\nthe west coast in that neighbourhood, may be instanced a farm called\r\nFenny, at Rossall, which was removed back from threatened destruction\r\nby the waves at least four times within the last fifty years, when its\r\nre-building was abandoned, and its site soon swept over by the billows;\r\nalso the village of Singleton Thorp, which occupied the locality marked\r\nby “Singleton Skeer” off Cleveleys until 1555, when it was destroyed by\r\nan irruption of the sea. Numerous other instances in which the coast\r\nline has been altered and driven eastward, between Rossall Point and\r\nthe mouth of Ribble, during both actually and comparatively modern days\r\nmight be cited, but the above are sufficient to support our view of the\r\nformer connection of “Shell Wharf” with the main-land, and its gradual\r\nsubmersion. If on the map, the Bay of Lancaster be detached from that\r\nof Morecambe, the latter still retains a most imposing aspect, and its\r\nidentity with the Moricambe Æstuarium of Ptolemy is in no way interfered\r\nwith or rendered less evident. The foregoing, as our antiquarian readers\r\nwill doubtless have surmised, is but a prelude to something more, for it\r\nis our purpose to endeavour to disturb the forty years of quiet repose\r\nenjoyed by the Portus Setantiorum on the banks of the Wyre and hurl it\r\nfar into the Irish Sea, to the very limits of the “Lune Deep,” where, on\r\nthe original estuary of the river Lune, we believe to be its legitimate\r\nhome. No locality, as yet claiming to be the site of the ancient harbour,\r\naccords so well with the distances given by Ptolemy. Assuming the Dee\r\nand the Ribble to represent respectively, as now generally admitted,\r\nthe Seteia Æstuarium and the Belisama Æstuarium, the Portus Setantiorum\r\nshould lie about seven miles[13] to the west and twenty-five to the\r\nnorth of the Belisama. The position of the “Lune Deep” termination is\r\njust about seven miles to the west of the estuary of the Ribble, but is,\r\nlike most other places whose stations have been mentioned by Ptolemy,\r\ndefective in its latitudinal measurement according to the record left by\r\nthat geographer, being only fifteen instead of twenty-five miles north\r\nof the Belisama or Ribble estuary. Rigodunum, or Ribchester, is fully\r\nthirty miles to the east of the spot where it is wished to locate the\r\nPortus, and thus approaches very nearly to the forty-mile measurement of\r\nPtolemy, whose distances, as just hinted, were universally excessive.\r\nAs an instance of such error it may be stated that the longitude, east\r\nfrom Ferro, of Morecambe Bay or Estuary given by Ptolemy, is 3° 40´ in\r\nexcess of that marked on modern maps of ancient Britannia, and if the\r\nsame over-plus be allowed in the longitude of the Portus Setantiorum a\r\nline drawn in accordance, from north to south, would pass across the\r\nwest extremity of the “Lune Deep,” showing that its distance from the\r\nBay corresponds pretty accurately with that of the Portus from the\r\nMorecambe Æstuarium as geographically fixed by Ptolemy. In describing the\r\nextent and direction of the Roman road, or Danes’ Pad, in his “History\r\nof Blackpool and Neighbourhood,” Mr. Thornber writes:—“Commencing at\r\nthe _terminus_, we trace its course from the Warren, near the spot\r\nnamed the ‘Abbot’s walk’;” but that the place thus indicated was not\r\nthe _terminus_, in the sense of _end_ or _origin_, is proved by the\r\nfact that shortly after the publication of this statement, the workmen\r\nengaged in excavating for a sea-wall foundation in that vicinity came\r\nupon the road in the sand on the very margin of the Warren. Hence it\r\nwould seem that the path was continued onwards over the site of the\r\nNorth Wharf sand bank, either towards the foot of Wyre where its channel\r\njoins that of Lune, and where would be the original mouth of the former\r\nriver, or, as we think more probable, towards the Lune itself, and\r\nalong its banks westward to the estuary of the stream, as now marked by\r\nthe termination of “Lune Deep.” The Wyre, during the period it existed\r\nsimply as a tributary of the Lune, a name very possibly compounded from\r\nthe Celtic _al_, chief, and _aun_, or _un_, contractions of _afon_, a\r\nriver, must have been a stream of comparatively slight utility in a\r\nnavigable point of view, and even to this day its seaward channel from\r\nFleetwood is obstructed by two shallows, denominated from time out of\r\nmind the Great and Little Fords. The Lune, or “Chief River,” on the\r\ncontrary, was evidently, from its very title, whether acquired from its\r\nrelative position to its tributary, or from its favourable comparison\r\nwith other rivers of the neighbourhood, which is less likely, regarded\r\nby the natives as a stream of no insignificant magnitude and importance.\r\nAs far as its navigability was concerned the Portus may have been placed\r\non its banks near to the junction of Wyre, but the distances of Ptolemy,\r\nwhich agree pretty fairly, as shown above, with the location of the\r\nPortus on the west extremity of the present “Lune Deep,” are incompatible\r\nwith such a station as this one for the same harbour. The collection of\r\ncoins discovered near Rossall may imply the existence in early days of a\r\nsettlement west of that shore, and many remains of the Romans may yet be\r\nmingled with the sand and shingle for centuries submerged by the water of\r\nthe still encroaching Irish Sea. Leaving this long-argued question of the\r\nreal site of the Portus Setantiorum, in which perhaps the patience of our\r\nreaders has been rather unduly tried, and soliciting others to test more\r\nthoroughly the merits of the ideas here thrown out, we will hasten to\r\nexamine the traces of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes.\r\n\r\nMany, in fact most, of the towns and villages of the Fylde were founded\r\nby the Anglo-Saxons, and have retained the names, generally in a modified\r\nform, bestowed upon them by that race, as instance Singleton, Lytham,\r\nMythorp, all of which have Saxon terminals signifying a dwelling,\r\nvillage, or enclosure. The word _hearb_, genitive _hearges_, indicates in\r\nthe vocabulary of the same people a heathen temple or place of sacrifice,\r\nand as it is to be traced in the endings of Goosnargh, and Kellamergh,\r\nthere need be no hesitation in surmising that the barbarous and pagan\r\nrites of the Saxons were celebrated there, before their conversion to\r\nChristianity. Ley, or lay, whether at the beginning of a name, as in\r\nLayton, or at end, as in Boonley, signifies a field, and is from the\r\nSaxon _leag_; whilst Hawes and Holme imply, respectively, a group of\r\nthorps or hamlets, and a river island. Breck, Warbreck, and Larbreck,\r\nderive their final syllables from the Norse _brecka_, a gentle rise; and\r\nfrom that language comes also the terminal _by_, in Westby, Ribby, and\r\nother places, as well as the _kirk_ in Kirkham, all of which point out\r\nthe localities occupied by the Danes, or Norsemen. Lund was doubtless the\r\nsite of a sacred grove of these colonists and the scene of many a dark\r\nand cruel ceremony, its derivation being from the ancient Norse _lundr_,\r\na consecrated grove, where such rites were performed.\r\n\r\nAt the present time it is difficult, if indeed possible, to determine\r\nfrom what races our own native population has descended, and the subject\r\nis one which has provoked more than a little controversy. Palgrave, in\r\nhis “History of the Anglo-Saxons,” says:—“From the Ribble in Lancashire,\r\nor thereabouts, up to the Clyde, there existed a dense population\r\ncomposed of Britons, who preserved their national language and customs,\r\nagreeing in all respects with the Welsh of the present day; so that\r\neven to the tenth century the ancient Britons still inhabited the\r\ngreater part of the west coast of the island, however much they had been\r\ncompelled to yield to the political supremacy of the Saxon invaders.”\r\nMr. Thornber states that he has been “frequently told by those who were\r\nreputed judges” that the manners, customs, and dialect of the Fylde\r\npartook far more of the Welsh than of the Saxon, and that this was more\r\nperceptible half a century ago than now (1837). “The pronunciation,” he\r\nadds, “of the words—laughing, toffee, haughendo, etc., the Shibboleth\r\nof the Fylde—always reminds me of the deep gutterals of the Welsh,[14]\r\nand the frequent use of a particular oath is, alas! too common to both.”\r\nAnother investigator, Dr. Robson, holds an entirely different opinion,\r\nand maintains in his paper on Lancashire and Cheshire, that there is\r\nno sufficient foundation for the common belief that the inhabitants of\r\nany portion of those counties have been at any time either Welsh, or\r\nCeltic; and that the Celtic tribes at the earliest known period were\r\nconfined to certain districts, which may be traced, together with the\r\nextent of their dominions, by the Celtic names of places both in Wales\r\nand Cornwall. From another source we are informed that at the date of\r\nthe Roman abdication the original Celtic population would have dwindled\r\ndown to an insignificant number acting as serfs and tillers of the land,\r\nand not likely to have much influence upon future generations. Mr.\r\nHardwick, in his History of Preston, writes:—“Few women would accompany\r\nthe Roman colonists, auxiliaries, and soldiers into Britain; hence\r\nit is but rational to conclude, that during the long period of their\r\ndominion, numerous intermarriages with the native population would take\r\nplace.” Admitting the force of reasoning brought forward by the last\r\nauthority, it can readily be conceived that the purity of the aboriginal\r\ntribes would in a great measure be destroyed at an early epoch, and that\r\nsubsequent alliances with the Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and Normans, have\r\nrendered all conjectures as to the race of forefathers to which the\r\ninhabitants of the Fylde have most claim practically valueless.\r\n\r\nThe dense forests with which our district in the earliest historic\r\nperiods abounded must have been well supplied with beasts of chase,\r\nwhereon the Aborigines exercised their courage and craft, and from\r\nwhich their clothing and, in a great measure, their sustenance were\r\nderived. The large branching horns of the Wild Deer have been found\r\nin the ground at Larbrick, and during the excavations for the North\r\nUnion and East Lancashire Railway Bridges over the Ribble, in 1838 and\r\n1846 respectively, numerous remains of the huge ox, called the _Bos\r\nprimigenius_, and the _Bos longifrons_, or long-faced ox, as well as of\r\nwild boars and bears, were raised from beneath the bed of the river, so\r\nthat it is extremely likely that similar relics of the brute creation\r\nare lying deeply buried in our soil. Such a supposition is at least\r\nwarranted by the discovery, half-a-century ago, of the skull and short\r\nupright horns of a stag and those of an ox, of a breed no longer known,\r\nat the bottom of a marl pit near Rossall. Bones and sculls, chiefly\r\nthose of deer and oxen, have been taken from under the peat in all the\r\nmosses, and two osseous relics, consisting each of skull and horns, of\r\nimmense specimens of the latter animal, have been dug up at Kirkham. In\r\nthe “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ” of Mr. Buckland is a figure of the scull of a\r\nrhinoceros belonging to the antediluvian age, and stated to have been\r\ndiscovered beneath a moss in Lancashire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAN CONQUEST TO JAMES THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the battle of Hastings, in 1066, had terminated in favour of William\r\nthe Conqueror, and placed him on the throne of England, he indulged his\r\nnewly acquired power in many acts of tyranny towards the vanquished\r\nnation, subjecting the old nobility to frequent indignities, weakening\r\nthe sway of the Church, and impoverishing the middle and lower classes of\r\nthe community. This harsh policy spread dissatisfaction and indignation\r\nthrough all ranks of the people, and it was not long before rebellion\r\nbroke out in the old province of Northumbria. The Lancastrians and\r\nothers, under the earls Morcar and Edwin, rose up in revolt, slew the\r\nNorman Baron set over them, and were only reduced to order and submission\r\nwhen William appeared on the scene at the head of an overwhelming\r\nforce. The two earls escaped across the frontier to Scotland, and for\r\nsome inexplicable reason were permitted to retain their possessions in\r\nLancashire and elsewhere, while the common insurgents were afterwards\r\ntreated with great severity and cruelty by their Norman rulers. Numerous\r\ncastles were now erected in the north of England to hold the Saxons in\r\nsubjection, and guard against similar outbreaks in future. Those at\r\nLancaster and Liverpool were built by a Norman Baron of high position,\r\nnamed Roger de Poictou, the third son of Robert de Montgomery, earl of\r\nArundel and Shrewsbury. When William divided the conquered territory\r\namongst his followers, the Honor[15] of Lancaster and the Hundred of\r\nAmounderness fell, amongst other gifts, amounting in all to three hundred\r\nand ninety-eight manors,[16] to that nobleman, and, as he resided during\r\na large portion of his time at the castle erected on the banks of the\r\nLune, our district would receive a greater share of attention than his\r\nmore distant possessions.\r\n\r\nAfter the country had been restored to peace, William determined to\r\ninstitute an inquiry into the condition and resources of his kingdom.\r\nThe records of the survey were afterwards bound up in two volumes, which\r\nreceived the name of the Domesday Book, from _Dome_, a census, and _Boc_,\r\na book.\r\n\r\nThe king’s commands to the investigators were, according to the Saxon\r\nChronicle, to ascertain—“How many hundreds of hydes were in each shire,\r\nwhat lands the king himself had, and what stock there was upon the land;\r\nor what dues he ought to have by the year from each shire. Also he\r\ncommissioned them to record in writing, how much land his archbishops had\r\nand his diocesan bishops, and his abbots and his earls; what or how much\r\neach man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or\r\nstock, and how much money it was worth. So very narrowly, indeed, did he\r\ncommission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor\r\na yard of land; nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought\r\nit no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine, was there\r\nleft that was not set down in his writ.” The examination was commenced\r\nin 1080, and six years afterwards the whole of the laborious task was\r\naccomplished. In this compilation the county of Lancaster is never once\r\nmentioned by name, but the northern portion is joined to the Yorkshire\r\nsurvey, and the southern to that of Cheshire.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of that part of Domesday Book relating to\r\nthe Fylde:—\r\n\r\n  AGEMUNDERNESSE UNDER EVRVIC—SCIRE (YORKSHIRE).\r\n\r\n  _Poltun_ (Poulton), two carucates;[17] _Rushale_ (Rossall), two\r\n  carucates; _Brune_ (Burn), two carucates; _Torentun_ (Thornton),\r\n  six carucates; _Carlentun_ (Carleton), four carucates; _Meretun_\r\n  (Marton), six carucates; _Staininghe_ (Staining), six carucates.\r\n\r\n  _Biscopham_ (Bispham), eight carucates; _Latun_ (Layton), six\r\n  carucates.\r\n\r\n  _Chicheham_ (Kirkham), four carucates; _Salewic_ (Salwick),\r\n  one carucate; _Cliftun_ (Clifton), two carucates; _Newtune_\r\n  (Newton-with-Scales), two carucates; _Frecheltune_ (Freckleton),\r\n  four carucates; _Rigbi_ (Ribby-with-Wray), six carucates;\r\n  _Treueles_ (Treales), two carucates; _Westbi_ (Westby), two\r\n  carucates; _Pluntun_ (Plumptons), two carucates; _Widetun_\r\n  (Weeton), three carucates; _Pres_ (Preese), two carucates;\r\n  _Midehope_ (Mythorp), one carucate; _Wartun_ (Warton), four\r\n  carucates; _Singletun_ (Singleton), six carucates; _Greneholf_\r\n  (Greenhalgh), three carucates; _Hameltune_ (Hambleton), two\r\n  carucates.\r\n\r\n  _Lidun_ (Lytham), two carucates.\r\n\r\n  _Michelescherche_ (St. Michael’s-on-Wyre), one carucate;\r\n  _Pluntun_ (Wood Plumpton) five carucates; _Rodecliff_ (Upper\r\n  Rawcliffe), two carucates; _Rodecliff_ (Middle Rawcliffe), two\r\n  carucates; a third _Rodecliff_ (Out Rawcliffe), three carucates;\r\n  _Eglestun_ (Ecclestons), two carucates; _Edeleswic_ (Elswick),\r\n  three carucates; _Inscip_ (Inskip), two carucates; _Sorbi_\r\n  (Sowerby), one carucate.\r\n\r\n  All these vills belong to _Prestune_ (Preston); and there are\r\n  three churches (in Amounderness). In sixteen of these vills[18]\r\n  there are but few inhabitants—but how many there are is not known.\r\n\r\n  The rest are waste. _Roger de Poictou_ had [the whole].\r\n\r\nWhen we read the concluding remark—“The rest are waste,” and observe the\r\ninsignificant proportion of the many thousands of acres comprised in the\r\nFylde at that time under cultivation, we are made forcibly cognizant of\r\nthe truly deplorable condition to which the district had been reduced by\r\never-recurring warfare through a long succession of years. There is no\r\nguide to the number of the inhabitants, excepting, perhaps, the existence\r\nof only three churches in the whole Hundred of Amounderness, and this\r\ncan scarcely be admitted as certain evidence of the paucity of the\r\npopulation, as in the harassed and unsettled state in which they lived it\r\nis not very probable that the people would be much concerned about the\r\npublic observances of religious ceremonials or services. The churches\r\nalluded to were situated at Preston, Kirkham, and St. Michael’s-on-Wyre.\r\nThe parish church at Poulton was the next one erected, and appears to\r\nhave been standing less than ten years after the completion of the\r\nSurvey, for Roger de Poictou, when he founded the priory of St. Mary,\r\nLancaster, in 1094, endowed it with—“Pulton in Agmundernesia, and\r\nwhatsoever belonged to it, and the _church_, with one carucate of land,\r\nand all other things belonging to it.”[19] The terminal paragraph of the\r\nfoundation-charter of the monastery states that Geoffrey, the sheriff,\r\nhaving heard of the liberal grants of Roger de Poictou, also bestowed\r\nupon it—“the tithes of Biscopham, whatever he had in Lancaster, some\r\nhouses, and an orchard.” It is difficult to determine whether a church\r\nexisted in the township of Bispham at that date or not, but as no such\r\nedifice is included in the above list of benefactions, we are inclined\r\nto believe that it was not erected until later. The earliest mention\r\nof it occurs in the reign of Richard I., 1189 to 1199, when Theobald\r\nWalter quitclaimed to the abbot of Sees “all his right in the advowson of\r\nPulton, with the _church of Biscopham_.”[20]\r\n\r\nThe rebellious and ungrateful conduct of Roger de Poictou ultimately led\r\nto his banishment out of the country, and the forfeiture of the whole\r\nof his extensive possessions to the crown. The Hundred of Amounderness\r\nwas conveyed by the King on the 22nd of April, 1194, being the fifth\r\nyear of his reign, to Theobald Walter, the son of Hervens, a Norman who\r\nhad accompanied the Conqueror. “Be it known,” says the document, “that\r\nwe give and confirm to Theobald Walter the whole of Amounderness with\r\nits appurtenances by the service of three Knights’ fees, namely, all\r\nthe domain thereto belonging, all the services of the Knights who hold\r\nof the fee of Amounderness by Knight’s service, all the service of the\r\nFree-tenants of Amounderness, all the Forest of Amounderness, with all\r\nthe Venison, and all the Pleas of the Forest.” His rights “are to be\r\nfreely and quietly allowed,” continues the deed, “in wood and plain, in\r\nmeadows and pastures, in highways and footpaths, in waters and mills, in\r\nmill-ponds, in fish-ponds and fishings, in peat-lands, moors and marshes,\r\nin wreck of the sea, in fairs and markets, in advowsons and chapelries,\r\nand in all liberties and free customs.” Amongst the barons of Lancashire\r\ngiven in the MSS. of Percival is—“Theobald Walter, baron of Weeton and\r\nAmounderness,” but, as Weeton never existed as a barony, it is clear that\r\nthe former title is an error. The “Black Book of the Exchequer,” the\r\noldest record after the “Domesday Book,” has entered in it the tenants\r\nand fees _de veteri feoffamento_[21] and _de novo feoffamento_,[22] and\r\namongst others is a statement that Theobald Walter held Amounderness by\r\nthe service of one Knight, thus the later charter, just quoted, must be\r\nregarded as a confirmation of a previous grant, and not as an original\r\ndonation. He was an extensive founder of monastic houses, and amongst\r\nthe abbeys established by him was that of Cockersand, which he endowed\r\nwith the whole Hay of Pylin (Pilling) in Amounderness. He was appointed\r\nsheriff of the county of Lancaster by Richard I. in 1194, and retained\r\nthe office until the death of that monarch five years afterwards. His\r\nson, Theobald, married Maud, sister to the celebrated Thomas à Becket,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, and assumed the title of his office when\r\ncreated _Chief Butler_ of Ireland. The family of the same name which\r\ninhabited Rawcliffe Hall until that property was confiscated through\r\nthe treasonable part played by Henry Butler and his son Richard in the\r\nrebellion of 1715, was directly descended from Theobald Walter-Butler.\r\nThe Butlers of Kirkland, the last of whom, Alexander Butler, died in\r\n1811, and was succeeded by a great-nephew, were also representatives of\r\nthe ancient race of Walter, and preserved the line unbroken. Theobald\r\nWalter, the elder, died in 1206, and Amounderness reverted to the crown.\r\n\r\nRichard I. a few years before his death presented the Honor of Lancaster\r\nto his brother, the earl of Moreton, who subsequently became King John,\r\nand it is asserted that this nobleman, when residing at the castle of\r\nLancaster, was occasionally a guest at Staining Hall, and that during\r\none of his visits he so admired the strength and skill displayed\r\nby a person called Geoffrey, and surnamed the Crossbowman, that he\r\ninduced him to join his retinue. How far truth has been embellished\r\nand disguised by fiction in this traditional statement we are unable\r\nto conjecture, but there are reasonable grounds for believing that the\r\nstory is not entirely supposititious, for the earl of Moreton granted to\r\nGeoffrey l’Arbalistrier, or the Crossbowman, who is said to have been\r\na younger brother of Theobald Walter, senior, six carucates of land in\r\nHackinsall-with-Preesall, and a little later, the manor of Hambleton,\r\nmost likely as rewards for military or other services rendered to that\r\nnobleman. John, as earl of Moreton, appears to have gained the affection\r\nand respect of the inhabitants of Lancashire by his liberal practices\r\nduring his long sojourns in their midst. He granted a charter to the\r\nknights, thanes, and freeholders of the county, whereby they and their\r\nheirs, without challenge or interference from him and his heirs, were\r\npermitted to fell, sell, and give, at their pleasure, their forest woods,\r\nwithout being subject to the forest regulations, and to hunt and take\r\nhares, foxes, rabbits, and all kinds of wild beasts, excepting stags,\r\nhinds, roebucks, and wild hogs, in all parts within his forests beyond\r\nthe desmesne hays of the county.[23] On ascending the throne, however,\r\nhe soon aroused the indignation of all sections of his subjects by his\r\nmeanness, pride, and utter inability to govern the kingdom. His indolent\r\nhabits excited the disgust of a nobility, whose regular custom was to\r\nbreakfast at five and dine at nine in the morning, as proclaimed by the\r\nfollowing popular Norman proverb:—\r\n\r\n  Lever à cinque, dîner à neuf,\r\n  Souper à cinque, coucher à neuf,\r\n  Fait vivre d’ans nonante et neuf.[24]\r\n\r\nEventually his evil actions and foolish threats so incensed the nation,\r\nthat the barons, headed by William, earl of Pembroke, compelled him, in\r\n1215, to sign the Magna Charta, a code of laws embodying two important\r\nprinciples—the general rights of the freemen, and the limitation of the\r\npowers of both king and pope.\r\n\r\nAbout that time it would have been almost, if not quite, impossible\r\nto have decided or described what was the national language of the\r\ncountry. The services at the churches were read in Latin, the aristocracy\r\nindulged only in Norman-French, whilst the great mass of the people\r\nspoke a language, usually denominated Saxon or English, but which had\r\nbeen so mutilated and altered by additions from various sources that\r\nthe ancient “Settlers on the shores of the German Ocean” would scarcely\r\nhave recognized it as their native tongue. Each division of the kingdom\r\nhad its peculiar dialect, very much as now, and from the remarks of a\r\nsouthern writer, named Trevisa, it must be inferred that the _patois_\r\nof our own district, which he would include in the old province of\r\nNorthumbria,[25] was far from either elegant or musical. “Some,” he\r\nsays, “use strange gibbering, chattering, waffling, and grating; then the\r\nNorthumbre’s tongue is so sharp, flitting, floyting, and unshape, that we\r\nSouthron men may not understand that language.” Such a list of curious\r\nand uncomplimentary epithets inclines us at first sight to doubt the\r\nstrict impartiality of their author, but when it is remembered that, in\r\nspite of the greatly increased opportunities for education and facilities\r\nfor intercommunion amongst the different classes, the provincialisms of\r\nsome of our own peasantry would be utterly unintelligible to many of us\r\nat the present day, we are constrained to admit that Trevisa may have had\r\njust reason for his remarks.\r\n\r\nIn 1268 the Honor of Lancaster, the Wapentake of Amounderness, and the\r\nmanors of Preston, Ribby-with-Wray, and Singleton were given by Henry\r\nIII. to his son Edmund Crouchback, and in addition the king published\r\nan edict forbidding the sheriffs of neighbouring counties to enter\r\nthemselves, or send, or permit their bailiffs to enter or interfere with\r\nanything belonging to the Honor of Lancaster, or to the men of that\r\nHonor, unless required to do so by his son. Edmund was also created\r\nearl of Lancaster, and became the founder of that noble house, whose\r\npossessions and power afterwards attained to such magnitude as to\r\nplace its representative, Henry IV., upon the throne, although nearer\r\ndescendants of his grandfather Edward III. were still living.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the unsettled era, comprising the reigns of the\r\nthree Edwards and Richard II., and during the whole of the time these\r\nmonarchs wore the crown, a period of one hundred and twenty-six years,\r\nthe nation was engaged in continual wars—with the Welsh under Llewellyn,\r\nthe Scotch under Bruce and Wallace, and the French under Philip. The\r\nreign of Richard II. was additionally agitated by the insurrection of Wat\r\nTyler. Looking at that long uninterrupted season of excitement, we cease\r\nto wonder at the riotous and disorganized state into which society was\r\nthrown. The rulers, whether local and subordinate, or those of a higher\r\ngrade, were too actively engaged in forwarding the efficiency of the\r\narmy, to devote much attention to the welfare and proper government of\r\nthe people. Crimes and disturbances were allowed to pass unpunished, and\r\nevil-doers, being thus encouraged to prosecute their unlawful purposes,\r\ncarried their outrages to the very confines of open rebellion against\r\nall power and order. It was not until such a dangerous climax had been\r\nreached that a commission, consisting of the following judges, Peter de\r\nBradbate, Edmund Deyncourt, William de Vavasour, John de Island, and\r\nAdam de Middleton, was appointed to deal summarily and severely with all\r\noffenders in the counties of Lancaster and Westmoreland. During those\r\ntroublesome times Sir Adam Banastre and a number of others assaulted\r\nRalph de Truno, prior of Lancaster, and his train of attendants at\r\nPoulton-le-Fylde, seized and carried him off to Thornton, where they\r\nbrutally ill-used and finally imprisoned him. An inquiry into the\r\ndisgraceful proceeding was instituted by order of Edward I., but the\r\nresult has not been preserved, at least no record of it has as yet been\r\ndiscovered amongst any of the ancient documents concerning this county.\r\nLeyland, who was antiquary to Henry VIII., alluding to the death of the\r\ndisorderly knight, says,—“Adam Banastre, a bachelar of Lancastershire,\r\nmoved ryot agayne Thomas of Lancaster by kraft of kynge Edward II., but\r\nhe was taken and behedid by the commandment of Thomas of Lancaster.”\r\nThe first part of the quotation has reference to a quarrel between the\r\nearl of Lancaster and Sir Adam, who for his own aggrandizement and to\r\ncurry favour with the king, as well as to divert the attention of that\r\nmonarch from his own misdeeds, declared that Thomas of Lancaster wished\r\nto interfere with the royal prerogative in the choice of ministers; and,\r\nprofessedly, to punish such presumption he invaded the domains of that\r\nnobleman. An encounter took place in the valley of the Ribble, not far\r\nfrom Preston, in which the followers of Sir Adam were vanquished and put\r\nto flight. Their leader secreted himself in a barn on his own lands, but,\r\nbeing discovered by the soldiers of his opponent, was dragged forth and\r\nbeheaded with a sword. Subjoined is an account of a disturbance which\r\noccurred at Kirkham during the same period, transcribed from the Vale\r\nRoyal[26] register:—“A narrative of proceedings in a dispute between\r\nthe abbot of Vale Royal, and Sir Will. de Clifton, knt., respecting the\r\ntithes in the manor of Clifton and Westby, in the parish of Kirkham, A.D.\r\n1337, in the time of Peter’s abbacy. The charges alleged against Sir\r\nWilliam state, that he had obtained twenty marks[27] due to the abbot;\r\nhad forcibly obstructed the rector in the gathering of tithes within the\r\nmanor of Clifton and Westby; seized his loaded wain, and brought ridicule\r\non his palfrey: that he had also burst, with his armed retainers, into\r\nthe parish church of Kirkham, and thereby deterred his clerks from the\r\nperformance of divine service; had prevented the parishioners from\r\nresorting to the font for the rite of baptism; and that, having seized on\r\nThomas, the clerk of the abbot of Vale Royal, he had inflicted on him a\r\nflagellation in the public streets of Preston. After a complaint, made to\r\nthe abbot of Westminster, a conservator of the rights and privileges of\r\nthe order to which Vale Royal belonged, Sir William confessed his fault\r\nand threw himself on the mercy of the abbot of the Cheshire convent,\r\nwho contented himself, after receiving a compensation for his rector’s\r\nlosses, with an oath from the refractory knight, that he would in future\r\nmaintain and defend the privileges of the abbey, and would bind himself\r\nin forty shillings to offer no further violence to the unfortunate\r\nsecretary of the abbot.”\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Edward III., Henry, earl of Lancaster, was created\r\nduke of the county with the consent of the prelates and peers assembled\r\nin parliament. This nobleman, whose pious and generous actions earned\r\nfor him the title of the “Good duke of Lancaster,” received a mandate\r\nfrom the king during the war with France, when there were serious\r\napprehensions of an invasion by that nation, to arm all the lancers on\r\nhis estates, and to set a strict watch over the seacoasts of Lancashire.\r\nThese precautions, however, proved unnecessary, as the French made no\r\nattempt to cross the channel. In his will, bearing the date 1361, (the\r\nyear of his death), Duke Henry bequeathed the Wappentakes or Hundreds of\r\nAmounderness, Lonsdale, and Leyland, with other estates, to his daughter\r\nBlanche, who had married John of Gaunt, the earl of Richmond and fourth\r\nson of Edward III. John of Gaunt succeeded to the dukedom in right of his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n“In the ‘Testa de Nevill’,” a register extending from 1274 to 1327, and\r\ncontaining, amongst other matters, a list of the fees and serjeanties\r\nholden of the king and the churches in his gift, it is stated under the\r\nlatter heading:—“St. Michael upon Wyre; the son of Count Salvata had\r\nit by gift of the present king, and he says, that he is elected into a\r\nbishoprick, and that the church is vacant, and worth 30 marks[28] per an.\r\nKyrkeham; King John gave two parts of it to Simon Blundel, on account of\r\nhis custody of the son and heir of Theobald Walter. Worth 80 marks[29]\r\nper an.” In another part of these records it is named that Richard de\r\nFrekelton held fees in chief in Freckleton, Newton, and Eccleston; Alan\r\nde Singilton, in Singleton, Freckleton, Newton, and Elswick; and Adam de\r\nMerton, in Marton; also that Fitz Richard held serjeanties in Singleton,\r\nby serjeanty of Amounderness.\r\n\r\nThe earliest intimation of members being returned to represent our own\r\ndistrict, in conjunction with the other divisions of the county, is to\r\nthe parliament of Edward I., assembled in 1295, when Matthew de Redmand\r\nand John de Ewyas were elected knights of the shire for Lancaster,\r\nand in his report the sheriff adds—“There is no city in the county of\r\nLancaster.” The members of parliament in 1297 were Henricus de Kigheley\r\nand Henricus le Botyler; in 1302 Willielmus de Clifton and Gilbertus de\r\nSingleton; and in 1304 Willielmus de Clifton and Willielmus Banastre.\r\nHenricus le Botyler, or Butler, belonged to the family of the Butlers\r\nof Rawcliffe; Gilbertus de Singleton was probably connected with the\r\nSingletons whose descendants resided at Staining Hall; Willielmus de\r\nClifton was an ancestor of the Cliftons of Lytham, and here it may be\r\nstated that Lancashire was represented in 1383 by Robt. de Clifton, of\r\nWestby, and Ric’us de Hoghton; and in 1844 by J. Wilson Patten, now Lord\r\nWinmarleigh, and Jno. Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall. Thos. Henry\r\nClifton, esq., son of the last gentleman, and the Hon. F. A. Stanley are\r\nthe present members for North Lancashire.\r\n\r\nDuring the Scottish wars of Edward III., John de Coupland, of Upper\r\nRawcliffe, valiantly captured David II., king of Scotland, at the battle\r\nof Durham, and although that monarch dashed out Coupland’s teeth and\r\nused every means to incite the latter to slay him, the brave soldier\r\nrestrained his wrath and delivered up his prisoner alive. For that\r\nsignal service Edward rewarded him with a grant of £500 per annum,\r\nuntil he could receive an equivalent in land wherever he might choose,\r\nand created him a knight banneret.[30] “I have seen,” says Camden, “a\r\ncharter of King Edward III., by which he advanced John Coupland to the\r\nstate of a banneret in the following words, because in a battle fought\r\nat Durham he had taken prisoner David the Second, King of Scots:—‘Being\r\nwilling to reward the said John, who took David de Bruis prisoner, and\r\nfrankly delivered him unto us, for the deserts of his honest and valiant\r\nservice, in such sort as others may take example by his precedent to do\r\nus faithful service in time to come, we have promoted the said John to\r\nthe place and degree of a banneret; and, for the maintenance of the same\r\nstate, we have granted, for us and our heirs, to the same John, five\r\nhundred pounds by the year, to be received by him and his heirs’,” etc.\r\n\r\nFor some time after a truce had been concluded with Scotland, the war, in\r\nwhich the incident narrated occurred, continued with little abatement,\r\nand in 1322 this county with others was called upon to raise fresh\r\nlevies. These constant drains upon its resources, and the devastations\r\ncommitted by riotous companies of armed men, so impoverished our district\r\nthat the inhabitants of Poulton forwarded a petition to the Pope, praying\r\nhim to forego his claims upon their town on account of the deplorably\r\ndistressed condition to which they had been reduced. The taxations of\r\nall churches in the Fylde were greatly lowered in consideration of the\r\nindigency of the people; that of Kirkham from 240 marks per annum to 120,\r\nand the others in like proportion. Further evidence of the poverty of\r\nthis division may be gathered from a census taken in 1377, which states,\r\namongst other things, that—“There is no town worthy of notice anywhere\r\nin the whole of the county”; and again, twenty years later, when a loan\r\nwas raised to meet the enormous expenditure of the country, Lancashire\r\nfurnished no contributors.\r\n\r\nIn 1389, during the reign of Richard II., it was enacted, with a view\r\nto the preservation and improvement of the salmon fisheries throughout\r\nthe kingdom, “that no young salmon be taken or destroyed by nets, at\r\nmill-dams or other places, from the middle of April to the Nativity of\r\nSt. John Baptist”; and special reference is made to this neighbourhood in\r\nthe following sentence of the bill:—“It is ordained and assented, that\r\nthe waters of Lone, Wyre, Mersee, Ribbyl, and all other waters in the\r\ncounty of Lancaster, be put in defence, as to the taking of Salmons, from\r\nMichaelmas Day to the Purification of our Lady (2nd of February), and in\r\nno other time of the year, because that salmons be not seasonable in the\r\nsaid waters in the time aforesaid; and in the parts where such rivers be,\r\nthere shall be assigned and sworn good and sufficient conservators of\r\nthis statute.” The foregoing is the earliest regulation of the kind, and\r\nthe wisdom and utility of its provisions are evinced by the existence of\r\nsimilar measures at the present day.\r\n\r\nFrom the annals of the Duchy may be learnt some interesting particulars\r\nrelative to changes in ownership at that period of certain portions of\r\nthe territory comprised in the Fylde. In 1380 John of Gaunt, duke of\r\nLancaster, issued a “precept to the Escheator to give seisin of the Lands\r\nof William Botyler in Layton Magna, Layton Parva, Bispham, Warthebrek,\r\nand Great Merton,” etc.; and shortly afterwards gave orders to “seize\r\nthe Lands of William Botyler.” In 1385 mandates were issued by the same\r\nnobleman to his Escheator to “seize into the Hands of the King and\r\nhimself the Lands of Thomas Banastre, (deceased, 1384), in Ethelswyk,\r\nFrekculton, Claughton in Amoundernes, Syngleton Parva, Hamylton,\r\nStalmyn,” etc.; also those of “Emund Banastre, (deceased, 1384), in\r\nWodeplumpton, Preston,” etc. In the Rolls the subjoined entries also\r\noccur:—\r\n\r\n  1381.\r\n\r\n  GRANTORS.

Those contests,\r\nwhich lasted no less than thirty years, and included thirteen pitched\r\nbattles, were finally terminated in 1485, by the union of Henry VII. with\r\nCatherine of York, daughter of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nIn 1485 a malady called the “Sweating Sickness” visited the different\r\ndistricts of Lancashire, and so rapid and fatal were the effects, that\r\nduring the seven weeks it prevailed, large numbers of the populace\r\nfell victims to its virulence. Lord Verulam, describing the disease,\r\nsays:—“The complaint was a pestilent fever, attended by a malign vapour,\r\nwhich flew to the heart and seized the vital spirits; which stirred\r\nnature to strive to send it forth by an extreme sweat.”\r\n\r\nIn 1487 the impostor Lambert Simnel, who personated Edward, earl of\r\nWarwick, the heir in rightful succession to Edward IV., landed at the\r\nPile of Fouldrey, (Peel harbour) in Morecambe Bay, with an army raised\r\nchiefly by the aid of the Duchess of Burgundy, and marched into the\r\ncountry. At Stoke, near Newark, he was defeated and taken prisoner, and\r\nsubsequently the adventurer was made a scullion in the king’s kitchen,\r\nfrom which humble sphere he rose by good conduct to the position of\r\nfalconer. Henry VIII., soon after his accession in 1509, became embroiled\r\nin war with France, and whilst he was engaged in hostilities on the\r\ncontinent, James IV. of Scotland crossed the border, and invaded England\r\nwith a force of fifty thousand men. To resist this aggression large\r\nlevies were promptly raised in Lancashire and other northern counties,\r\nand on the field of Flodden, in Northumberland, a decisive battle took\r\nplace in 1513, in which the Scottish monarch was slain, and his army\r\nrouted. The Lancashire troops were led by Sir Edward Stanley, and\r\ntheir patriotism and valour are celebrated in an ancient song called\r\nthe “Famous Historie or Songe of Floodan Field.” In the following\r\nextract certain localities in and near the Fylde are mentioned as having\r\nfurnished their contingents of willing soldiers:—\r\n\r\n  “All Lancashire for the most parte\r\n  The lusty Standley stowte can lead,\r\n  A stock of striplings stronge of heart\r\n  Brought up from babes with beef and bread,\r\n  From Warton unto Warrington,\r\n  From Wiggen unto Wyresdale,\r\n  From Weddecon to Waddington,\r\n  From Ribchester to Rochdale,\r\n  From Poulton to Preston with pikes\r\n  They with ye Standley howte forthe went,\r\n  From Pemberton and Pilling Dikes\r\n  For Battell Billmen bould were bent\r\n  With fellowes fearce and fresh for feight\r\n  With Halton feilds did turne in foores,\r\n  With lusty ladds liver and light\r\n  From Blackborne and Bolton in ye moores.”\r\n\r\nThe office of High Sheriff is one of considerable antiquity, and in\r\nearly times it was no uncommon thing for the elected person to retain\r\nthe position for several years together. Annexed is a list of gentlemen\r\nconnected with the Fylde who have been High Sheriffs of the county of\r\nLancaster at different times, with their years of office:—\r\n\r\n  1194 to 1199. Theobald Walter, of Amounderness.\r\n  1278.         Gilbert de Clifton, of Clifton and Westby.\r\n  1287.         Gilbert de Clifton, of Clifton and Westby.\r\n  1289.

Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, of Rossall.\r\n  1835.         Thomas Clifton, of Lytham.\r\n  1842.         Thomas Robert Wilson ffrance, of Rawcliffe.\r\n  1853.         John Talbot Clifton, of Lytham.\r\n\r\nIt may be here noticed that Edmund Dudley, so notorious in English\r\nhistory as the infamous agent of Henry VII. in the wholesale and\r\nscandalous extortions that monarch practised upon his subjects, held\r\nmany and large territorial possessions in the county of Lancashire, the\r\nreward in all probability of his unscrupulous services to the king.\r\nAfter the death of his royal patron a loud outcry for the punishment of\r\nDudley was raised by the nation, and in the first year of Henry VIII. a\r\nproclamation was issued inviting those subjects who had been injured by\r\nDudley and his fellow commissioner, Sir Richard Empson, to come forward\r\nand state their complaints; the number of complainants who appeared was\r\nso great that it was found impossible to examine all their claims, so\r\nin order to pacify the universal indignation, the two obnoxious agents\r\nwere thrown into prison on a charge of treason. From the Inquisition for\r\nthe Escheat of the Duchy of Lancaster taken on the attainder of Edmund\r\nDudley, in 1509, it is discovered that amongst his numerous estates, were\r\nlands in Elswick, Hambleton, Freckleton, Thornton, Little Singleton,\r\nWood Plumpton, Whittingham, Goosnargh, and Claughton. Stow, writing\r\nabout the circumstances alluded to, says:—“Thereupon was Sir Richard\r\nEmpson, Knight, and Edmund Dudley, Esquire, by a politicke mean brought\r\ninto the Tower, where they were accused of treason, and so remained\r\nthere prisoners, thereby to quiet men’s minds, that made such suit to\r\nhave their money restored. On the seventeenth of July Edmund Dudley\r\nwas arraigned in the Guildhall of London, where he was condemned, and\r\nhad judgement to be drawn, hanged, and quartered.... Henry VIII. sent\r\ncommandment to the Constable of the Tower, charging him that Empson and\r\nDudley should shortly after be put to execution. The Sheriffs of London\r\nwere commanded by a special writ to see the said execution performed and\r\ndone, whereupon they went to the Tower and received the prisoners on the\r\n17th of August, 1510, and from thence brought them unto the scaffold on\r\nTower Hill, where their heads were stricken off.”\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous event which happened during the sovereignty of Henry\r\nVIII. was the Protestant Reformation. Henry, having quarrelled with the\r\nSupreme Head of the Church at Rome, determined to suppress all religious\r\nhouses in his kingdom whose incomes amounted to less than £200 per\r\nannum. Doctors Thomas Leigh and Thomas Layton were appointed to inspect\r\nand report on those in Lancashire; and amongst the number condemned on\r\ntheir visit was a small Benedictine Cell at Lytham. This Cell owed its\r\norigin to Richard Fitz Roger, who towards the latter part of the reign of\r\nRichard I. granted lands at Lytham to the Durham Church, in order that a\r\nprior and Benedictine monks might be established there to the honour of\r\nSt. Mary and St. Cuthbert. Its yearly revenue at the time of suppression\r\nwas only £55. A little later, in 1540, the larger monastic institutions\r\nsuffered the fate of the smaller ones; and amongst the chantries closed\r\nwere two at St. Michael’s-on-Wyre. All Catholic places of worship were\r\nclosed by a proclamation, bearing the date September 23rd, 1548, and\r\nissued by the lord protector Somerset on behalf of the young king Edward\r\nVI. On the death of that monarch in 1553 the crown descended to his\r\nsister Mary, only daughter of Catherine of Arragon; and one of her first\r\nacts was to re-establish the old faith and re-open the churches and\r\nchantries which her predecessors had closed. Mass was again celebrated\r\nin the churches of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, Kirkham, and Singleton, as in\r\nformer days, the officiating priests being:—\r\n\r\n  Kirkham                 Thomas Primbet, annual fee £2 10s. 0d.\r\n  Singleton               Richard Goodson,  ”     ”  £2  9s. 0d.\r\n  St. Michael’s-on-Wyre,  Thomas Cross      ”     ”  £4 13s. 10d.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this reign a grand military muster was ordered to\r\nbe made in the county palatine of Lancaster, and towards the 300 men\r\nraised in the Hundred of Amounderness the Fylde townships contributed as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  Warton                              4 men.\r\n  Carleton                            8  ”\r\n  Hardhome with Newton                8  ”\r\n  Much Eccleston                      5  ”\r\n  Clifton                             6  ”\r\n  Bispham and Norbreke                5  ”\r\n  Freckleton                          5  ”\r\n  Thilston                            8  ”\r\n  Thornton                            8  ”\r\n  Out Rawcliffe                       4  ”\r\n  Upper Rawcliffe and Tornecard       1  ”\r\n  Pulton                              3  ”\r\n  Weton                               3  ”\r\n  Threleyle                           6  ”\r\n  Little Eccleston and Larbreke       6  ”\r\n  Little Singleton and Grange         5  ”\r\n  Newton with Scales                  3  ”\r\n  Layton with Warbrick                8  ”\r\n  Elliswicke                          5  ”\r\n  Kelmyne and Brininge                5  ”\r\n  Kirkham                             3  ”\r\n  Westbye and Plumpton                8  ”\r\n  Rigby with Wraye                    8  ”\r\n  Lithum                              5  ”\r\n  Much Singleton                      7  ”\r\n  Plumpton                           11  ”\r\n\r\nThe commanders of the regiment were—Sir Thomas Hesketh, Sir Richard\r\nHoughton, George Browne, John Kitchen, Richard Barton, William Westby (of\r\nMowbreck), and William Barton, Esquires.\r\n\r\nDodsworth, who lived in the latter part of the sixteenth and early part\r\nof the seventeenth centuries, informs us that sometime during the year\r\n1555 “a sudden irruption of the sea” took place near Rossall grange, and\r\na whole village, called Singleton Thorp, was washed away by the fury of\r\nthe waves. “The inhabitants were driven out of their ancient home, and\r\nerected their tents at a place called Singleton to this day.” It has been\r\nsurmised that Singleton Thorp was the residence of Thomas de Singleton,\r\nwho opposed Edward I. in a suit to recover from that king the manors of\r\nSingleton, Thornton, and Brughton. The site formerly occupied by the\r\nancient village is now called Singleton Skeer. Dodsworth also declares\r\nthat the Horse-bank lying off the shores of Lytham was, in 1612, during\r\nthe reign of James I., a pasture for cattle, and that, in 1601, a village\r\ncalled Waddum Thorp existed between it and the present main-land.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1559, about two months after the accession of Elizabeth,\r\nanother muster took place throughout the several counties of the kingdom,\r\nand subjoined are enumerated the bodies of soldiers furnished by the\r\ndifferent Hundreds of Lancashire:—\r\n\r\n  BLACKEBURNE HUNDRED—407 harnessed men, 406 unharnessed men.\r\n  AMOUNDERNES HUNDRED—213 harnessed men, 369 unharnessed men.\r\n  LONDESDALL HUNDRED—356 harnessed men, 114 unharnessed men.\r\n  LEYLONDE HUNDRED—80 harnessed men, 22 unharnessed men.\r\n  SALEFORDE HUNDRED—394 harnessed men, 649 unharnessed men.\r\n  WEST DERBY HUNDRED—459 harnessed men, 413 unharnessed men.\r\n  Sum Total of harnessed men 1919.\r\n  Sum Total of unharnessed men 2073.[31]\r\n\r\nAn epidemic, described by Hollinworth as a “sore sicknesse,” prevailed\r\nin this county during some months of 1565, and carried off many of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth on her accession wrought another change in the national\r\nreligion, but taking warning from the outcries and disturbances produced\r\nby the sudden and sweeping policies of Henry VIII. and Mary, proceeded\r\nto affect her purpose in a more deliberate manner. She retained some of\r\nher Catholic ministers, taking care, however, to have sufficient of the\r\nreformed faith to outvote them when occasion required, and appointed\r\na commission to inquire into the persecutions of the last reign, with\r\norders to liberate from prison all those who had been confined on account\r\nof their attachment to Protestant principles. In her own chapel she\r\nforbade several Popish practices, and commanded that certain portions of\r\nthe services should be read in the English tongue. Shortly afterwards a\r\nproclamation was issued, ordering that all chantries should conduct their\r\nservices after the model of her own chapel. This comparative moderation\r\nwas succeeded at a later period of her sovereignty by sterner measures,\r\nand many Catholic recusants were placed in confinement, being subjected\r\nto heavy penalties and degradations. During the same reign the military\r\nstrength of the nation was again ascertained by a general muster. The\r\ngathering took place in 1574, when six gentlemen of our neighbourhood\r\nwere thus rated:—\r\n\r\nCuthbert Clifton, esq., to furnish:—Light horse 1, Plate-coate 1, Pyke 1,\r\nLong bows 2, Sheaves of arrows 2, Steel caps 2, Caliver 1, Morion 1.\r\n\r\nJames Massey, George Alane to furnish:—Plate-coat 1, Long bow 1, Sheaf of\r\narrows 1, Steel cap 1, Caliver 1, Morion 1, Bill 1.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hesketh to furnish of good will:—Caliver 1, Morion 1.\r\n\r\nWilliam Singleton, John Veale to furnish:—The same as William Hesketh\r\ndoth.\r\n\r\nThe whole complement raised in the Hundred of Amounderness consisted of—5\r\nLight horse, 1 Demi-lance, 2 Corslets, 17 Plate-coats, 11 Pykes, 22 Long\r\nbows, 22 Sheaves of arrows, 27 Steel caps, 15 Calivers, 20 Morions, and\r\n10 Bills.\r\n\r\nFather Edmund Campion, the notorious Jesuit, was apprehended in 1581,\r\nimmediately after travelling through Lancashire endeavouring to spread\r\nthe doctrines of his faith, and imprisoned in the Tower. Under the cruel\r\ninfluence of the rack he divulged the names of several persons by whom he\r\nhad been received and entertained whilst on his journey, and amongst them\r\nwere Mrs. Allen of Rossall Hall, the widow of Richard Allen, and John\r\nWestby of Mowbreck and Burn Halls. Shortly before his execution Campion\r\ndeplored his compulsory confession in a letter to a friend in these\r\nwords:—“It grieved me much to have offended the Catholic cause so highly,\r\nas to confess the names of some gentlemen and friends in whose houses I\r\nhave been entertained; yet in this I greatly cherish and comfort myself,\r\nthat I never discovered any secrets there declared, and that I will not,\r\ncome rack, come rope.”\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are taken from some manuscripts in the Harleian\r\ncollection, and will explain themselves:—\r\n\r\n  “Names of such as are detected for receiptinge of Priests,\r\n  Seminaries, etc., in the County of Lancashire.\r\n\r\n  “This appeareth by the presentment  One named little Richard receipted\r\n  of the Vicar of Garstang.           at Mr. Rigmaden’s of Weddicar by\r\n                                      report.\r\n\r\n  “This appeareth by the presentment  Ricard Cadocke, a seminary priest,\r\n  of the Vicar of Kirkham.            also Deiv.

Obstinate.”\r\n\r\nAt that period it was customary to levy a tax of live stock and different\r\narticles of food on each county, for the supply of the royal larder, and\r\nSir Richard Sherburn, of Carleton and Hambleton, and Alexander Rigby, of\r\nMiddleton, near Preston,[32] ratified an agreement with the treasurer\r\nand controller of Elizabeth’s household, that Lancashire should provide\r\nannually forty great oxen, to be delivered alive at her majesty’s\r\npasture at Crestow. Afterwards the sums to be contributed by each Hundred\r\nfor the purchase of these animals was arranged, and Amounderness rated at\r\n£16 10s. 0d. per year. The latter agreement was ratified by Sir Richard\r\nSherburne and Edward Tyldesley, of Myerscough, amongst others. Grievous\r\ncomplaints were made in the Fylde and other parts of the county of the\r\ndesecration of the Sabbath by “Wakes, fayres, markettes, bayrebaytes,\r\nbull baits, Ales, Maygames, Resortinge to Alehouses in tyme of devyne\r\nservice, pypinge and dauncinge, huntinge and all manner of unlawfull\r\ngamynge.” A letter praying that these profanations might be reformed\r\nwas signed by the magistrates of the several districts, amongst whom\r\nwere Edmund Fleetwood of Rossall, and R. Sherburne of Carleton, etc.,\r\nand forwarded to London. A commission of inquiry was appointed, and\r\nafter an investigation, the commissioners charged all mayors, bailiffs,\r\nand constables, as well as other civil officers, churchwardens, etc.,\r\nto suppress by all lawful means the said disorders of the Sabbath,\r\nand to present the offenders at the quarter sessions, that they might\r\nbe dealt with for the same according to law. They also directed that\r\nthe minstrels, bearwards, and all such disorderly persons, should be\r\nimmediately apprehended and brought before the justices of the peace, and\r\npunished at their discretion; that the churchwardens should be enjoined\r\nto present at the sessions all those that neglected to attend divine\r\nservice upon the Sabbath day, that they might be indicted and fined\r\nin the penalty of twelve pence for every offence; that the number of\r\nalehouses should be abridged, that the ale-sellers should utter a full\r\nquart of ale for one penny, and none of any less size, and that they\r\nshould sell no ale or other victuals in time of divine service; that\r\nnone should sell ale without a license; that the magistrates should be\r\nenjoined not to grant any ale-licenses except in public sessions; that\r\nthey should examine the officers of the commonwealth to learn whether\r\nthey made due presentment at the quarter sessions of all bastards born\r\nor remaining within their several precincts; and that thereupon a strict\r\ncourse should be taken for the due punishment of the reputed parents\r\naccording to the statute, as also for the convenient keeping and relief\r\nof the infants.[33]\r\n\r\nIn 1588, the year following the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, Philip\r\nof Spain, urged on by an ambition to conquer the kingdom of England and\r\nre-establish the Romish religion, equipped an immense fleet, consisting\r\nof seventy-two galliasses and galleons, forty-seven second-class ships of\r\nwar, and eleven pinnaces, to which he gave the name of the “Invincible\r\nArmada.” The rumour of this invasion spread great alarm throughout the\r\ncountry; and the magistrates, gentry, and freeholders of Lancashire\r\nwere summoned to meet Lord Strange at Preston, to consider what steps\r\nshould be taken for the defence of their coast, on which, at Peel in\r\nMorecambe Bay, it was deemed probable the Spaniards would attempt a\r\nlanding. So doubtful does Elizabeth appear to have been of the loyalty\r\nof her Lancashire subjects that Lord Strange was commanded to append\r\nto his summonses the words,—“Fayle not at your uttermost peril.” Nor\r\nwere these suspicions on the part of the queen without good reason, for\r\nthe principal landed proprietors and gentry of the county were members\r\nof the Romish Church, and it was to be feared that they would be only\r\nlukewarm in repelling, if not, indeed, active in encouraging, an enemy\r\nwhose professed object was the restoration of their religion. Baines,\r\nin reviewing the Reformation, says,—“In the county of Lancashire it was\r\nretrograde. The Catholics multiplied, priests were harboured, the book\r\nof common prayer and the service of the Church, established by law, were\r\nlaid aside; many of the churches were shut up, and the cures unsupplied,\r\nunless by the ejected Catholics.” Numerous crosses on the highways, as\r\nwell as the names of several places, as Low-cross, High-cross, Norcross,\r\netc., also testify to the Romish tendency of the inhabitants. Cardinal\r\nAllen, who had for many years been living on the continent at Douai and\r\nelsewhere[34] was suspected of having, in conjunction with Parsons, the\r\nJesuit, instigated Philip to this invasion. The harbour of “Pille,”\r\n(Peel) is described in the Lansdowne manuscripts as the “very best haven\r\nfor landings with great shyppes in all the west coast of England, called\r\nSt. George’s Channel,” and further in the same folio we read:—“What the\r\nSpanyerd means to do the Lord knows, for all the countrie being known to\r\nDoctor Allen, who was born harde by the pyle,” (Rossall Hall was the\r\nbirth-place of Allen,) “and the inhabytentes ther aboutes all ynfected\r\nwith the Romish poyson, it is not unlike that his directione will be used\r\nfor some landinge there.... One Thomas Prestone (a papyshe atheiste) is\r\ndeputye steward, and commandes the menrede, and lands ther, wch were\r\nsometyme appertayning to the Abbeye of Fornes.”\r\n\r\nWhilst preparations for resisting the Spaniards were being pushed forward\r\nwith as much expedition as possible, the “Invincibles” appeared in the\r\nEnglish Channel, and arranged themselves for battle in the form of a\r\ncrescent. The British fleet, numbering only thirty-four ships of war, and\r\nsundry private vessels equipped for the occasion, under the command of\r\nLord Howard, sailed out to engage them. A series of actions took place,\r\nand although nothing decisive had been effected, the advantage seemed\r\nto be leaning towards the English fleet, when eight fire-ships drifted\r\nin amongst the Armada and threw them into utter confusion. This _coup\r\nde maître_ took place on the 29th of July, 1588. The panic-stricken\r\nSpaniards, fearing that the whole of their ships would be destroyed in\r\na general conflagration, severed their cables, and fled. A westerly\r\ngale, however, sprang up, and wrecked many of the vessels on the coast\r\nbetween Ostend and Calais; the shores of Scotland and Ireland were also\r\ncovered with fragments of their ships and bodies of their mariners, while\r\ntradition asserts that one of the galleons was stranded on the Point of\r\nRossall, where it was attacked by the country people, either for the sake\r\nof pillage or in the hope of capturing it. Whether one or both of these\r\ndesires actuated the rustics they were doomed to disappointment, for the\r\nSpaniards successfully resisted their first attempt, and escaped on the\r\nreturning tide, before further efforts could be made by the little band\r\non shore. Two cannon balls were formerly to be seen at Rossall Hall, and\r\nit was stated that they were the identical ones fired by this vessel, as\r\na parting salute, when she sailed away. They were found on removing some\r\nof the walls belonging to the old mansion.\r\n\r\nThe annexed is a list of free-tenants residing in the Fylde district\r\nabout the year 1585, the 27th of the reign of Queen Elizabeth:—\r\n\r\n  Molyneux, Sir Richard, of Larbrick, knight.\r\n  Clifton, Thomas, of Westby, esq.\r\n  Rigby, Edward, of Layton and Burgh, esq.\r\n  Veale, John, of Mythorp, esq.\r\n  Butler, Henry, of Out-Rawcliffe, esq.\r\n  Parker, William, of Bradkirk, esq.\r\n  Westby, John, of Mowbreck, esq.\r\n  Kirkby, William, of Upper Rawcliffe, esq.\r\n  Singleton, George, of Staining, esq.\r\n  Hesketh, William, of Little Poulton, esq.\r\n  Stanley, Thomas, of Great Eccleston, esq.\r\n  Warren, ⸺, of Plumpton, esq.\r\n  White, Nicholas, of Great Eccleston, gent.\r\n  Rogerly, George, of Lytham, gent.\r\n  Banister, William, of Carleton, gent.\r\n  Sharples, John, of Freckleton, gent.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the priests previous to the Protestant Reformation is\r\nthus described by Harrison:—“They went either in divers colours like\r\nplaiers, or in garments of light hew, as yellow, red, greene, etc., with\r\ntheir shoes piked, their haire crisped, and their girdles armed with\r\nsilver; their shoes, spurs, bridles, etc., buckled with like mettall;\r\ntheir apparell chiefly of silke, and richlie furred, their cappes laced\r\nand buttoned with gold; so that to meet a priest in those days, was to\r\nbeholde a peacocke that spreadeth his taile when he danseth before the\r\nhenne.” “The manners and customs of the inhabitants of Lancashire,”\r\nwrites John de Brentford, “are similar to those of the neighbouring\r\ncounties except that the people eat with two pronged forks[35]; the men\r\nare masculine, and in general well made, they ride and hunt the same\r\nas in the most southern parts, but not with that grace, owing to the\r\nwhip being carried in the left hand; the women are most handsome, their\r\neyes brown, black, hazel, blue, or grey; their noses, if not inclined\r\nto the aquiline, are mostly of the Grecian form, which gives a most\r\nbeautiful archness to the countenance, such indeed as is not easy to be\r\ndescribed, their fascinating manners have long procured them the name\r\nof Lancashire witches.” Leyland in his “Itinerary” says:—“The dress\r\nof the men chiefly consists of woollen garments, while the women wear\r\nthose of silk, linen, or stuff. Their usual colours are those of green,\r\nblue, black, and sometimes brown. The military are dressed in red, which\r\nis vulgarly called scarlet.” In the time of Henry VIII. the custom of\r\nplacing chimneys on the tops of the houses was first introduced amongst\r\nthe English; before that period the smoke usually found its way through\r\nan opening in the roof or out of the doorway. The houses of the middle\r\nclasses were for the most part formed of wood, whilst those of the\r\npeasantry were built of wattles plastered over with a thick coating of\r\nclay. The few stone mansions existing in Lancashire were the residences\r\nof the nobility or of the most opulent gentry. Harrison, referring to the\r\nimprovements in accommodation gradually gaining ground, remarks:—“There\r\nwas a great, although not general, amendment of lodging; for our fathers,\r\nyea, and we ourselves also, have lien full oft upon straw pallets, on\r\nrough mats, onelie covered with a sheet under coverlets made of dagswam\r\nor hopparlots, and a good round log under the head instead of a bolster\r\nor pillow, which was thought meet onelie for women in childbed; as for\r\nservants, if they had anie sheets above them, it was well, for seldome\r\nhad they anie under their bodies to keep them from the prickly straws\r\nthat ran oft through the canvas of the pallet, and raised their hardened\r\nhides.” Holinshed, also, notices the better style of entertainment at\r\nthe inns of Lancaster, Preston, etc.; at which he tells us the guests\r\nwere well provided with “napierie, bedding, and tapisserie,” and each was\r\nsure of resting “in cleane sheets wherein no man had been lodged since\r\nthey came from the laundress.” Camden, writing of our more immediate\r\nneighbourhood a little later than the period we are now discussing,\r\nsays:—“The goodly and fresh complexion of the natives does sufficiently\r\nevince the goodness of the county; nay and the cattle too, if you will;\r\nfor in the oxen, which have huge horns and proportionate bodies, you will\r\nfind nothing of that perfection wanting that Mago, the Carthagenian, in\r\nColumella required. This soil (Amounderness) bears oats pretty well, but\r\nis not so good for barley; it makes excellent pasture especially towards\r\nthe sea, where it is partly Champain; whence a great part of it is called\r\nthe File, probably for the Field. But being in other places Fenny ’tis\r\nreckoned less wholesome. In many places along the coast there are heaps\r\nof sand, upon which the natives now and then pour water, till it grows\r\nsaltish, and then with turf boyl it into white salt.” Several of these\r\nsalt manufacturies were located near Lytham, and it is very likely that\r\nthe two brass pans and an ancient measure, discovered about forty years\r\nsince deeply imbedded in the peat not far from Fox Hall, were used in the\r\nproduction of salt somewhere in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nJAMES THE FIRST TO QUEEN VICTORIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James I., in 1603, the crowns of England and Scotland\r\nbecame legally united, although it was not until a considerable time\r\nafterwards that they could be regarded as practically so. This monarch\r\nwas the first to assume the title of King of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nA custom prevailed in former days of relieving the secular portion of\r\nthe community by imposing exclusive taxes on the clergy, and hence it\r\nis seen, that in 1608 a rate was levied upon the latter by the Right\r\nReverend George Lloyd, D.D., the eighth bishop of Chester. The following\r\nis a copy of the impost so far as the Hundred of Amounderness was\r\nconcerned:—\r\n\r\n            “_Archid. Decanatus_ Cestrie _in Com._ Lancastrie\r\n\r\n  A Rayte imposed by me George Bushoppe of Chestʳ upon the Clergie\r\n  within the Countye of Chesshyre and Lancashyre within the Dyoces\r\n  of Chest,ʳ By vertue of Ires from the lordes grace of Yorke\r\n  grounded upon + from the lordes and others of his maᵗᵉˢ most\r\n  honorable privye counsell for the fyndinge of horses, armes, and\r\n  other furniture, the XXVIIIth of October 1608.\r\n\r\n                  Amounderness Decanatus Archid.

At that date Chester\r\nwas created a distinct bishopric, and the southern part of our county\r\nincluded in the archdeaconry of Chester, whilst the northern portion was\r\nattached to the archdeaconry of Richmond.\r\n\r\nIn 1617 James I., on his return journey from Scotland to London, was\r\nentertained at Myerscough Lodge, near Garstang, by Edward Tyldesley,\r\nthe grandfather of the gentleman who erected Fox Hall, at Blackpool.\r\nThomas Tyldesley, a cousin of the owner of Myerscough Lodge, and\r\nattorney-general of the county of Lancaster, had been knighted by the\r\nmonarch at Wimbleton in the previous year. From Myerscough the King\r\nproceeded to Hoghton Tower, where a petition was presented to him by the\r\nagricultural labourers, petty tradesmen, and ordinary servants in this\r\nand other districts lying near Preston, praying that the edict of the\r\nlate queen, whereby sports and games had been prohibited on the Sabbath,\r\nmight be repealed. The prayer of the petitioners found favour with James,\r\nand shortly afterwards he caused it to be proclaimed—“that his majesty’s\r\npleasure was, that the bishops of the diocese should take strict order\r\nwith all the puritans and precisians within the county of Lancaster, and\r\neither constrain them to conform themselves, or to leave the countrie,\r\naccording to the laws of this kingdom and the canons of the church; and\r\nfor his good people’s recreation his pleasure was, that after the end\r\nof divine service, they be not disturbed, letted, or discouraged from\r\nany lawful recreation, such as dancing, either men or women; archery\r\nfor men, leaping, vaulting, or any such harmless recreation; nor having\r\nof May-games, Whitson-ales, and Morice-dances, and the setting up of\r\nMay-poles, and other sports therewith used; so as the same be had in due\r\nand convenient time, without impediment or neglect of divine service;\r\nand that women should have leave to carry rushes to the church, for\r\ndecorating of it according to the old custom; but withal his majesty\r\ndid here account still as prohibited, all unlawful games to be used\r\non Sundays only, as bear and bull-baitings, interludes, and, at all\r\ntimes, in the meaner sort of people, by law prohibited, bowling.” A few\r\nmonths after this concession to the wishes of a portion of his subjects,\r\nJames issued a publication designated the “Book of Sports,” in which he\r\nexplained what were to be considered lawful sports to be indulged in on\r\n“Sundays and Festivals.”\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen enumerated below were free-tenants, residing in the Fylde,\r\nduring his reign:—\r\n\r\n  Clifton, Sir Cuthbert, of Westby, knight.\r\n  Banister, Sir Robert, of Plumpton, knight.\r\n  Fleetwood, Edward, of Rossall, esq.\r\n  Westby, Thomas, of Mowbreck, esq.\r\n  Kirkby, William, of Upper Rawcliffe, esq.\r\n  Veale, Edward, of Whinney Heys, esq.\r\n  Burgh, Richard, of Larbrick, esq.\r\n  Leckonby, John, of Great Eccleston, esq.\r\n  Longworth, Richard, of St. Michael’s, esq.\r\n  Parker, John, of Bradkirk, esq.\r\n  Hesketh, William, of Mains, esq.\r\n  Singleton, Thomas, of Staining, esq.\r\n  Brown, James, of Singleton, gent.\r\n  Leigh, Robert, of Plumpton, gent.\r\n  Smith, John, of Kirkham, gent.\r\n  Sharples, Henry, of Kirkham, gent,\r\n  ffrance, John, of Eccleston, gent.\r\n  Thompson Wm., of Little Eccleston, gent.\r\n  Dobson, William, of Bispham, gent.\r\n  Hornby, Henry, of Bankfield, gent.\r\n  Bradley, James, of Bryning, gent.\r\n  Taylor, James, of Poulton, gent.\r\n  Bamber, Thomas, of Poulton, gent.\r\n  Bailey, Lawrence, of Layton, gent.\r\n  Bonny, Robert, of Kirkham, gent.\r\n  Whiteside, Robt., of Thornton, gent.\r\n\r\nIn the Registers of Kirkham is the annexed statement, from which it\r\nappears that a few years from the death of James I. the Fylde, or at\r\nleast a considerable tract of it, was visited by some fatal epidemic,\r\nbut its peculiar nature cannot be ascertained:—“A.D. 1630. This year\r\nwas a great plague in Kirkham, in which the more part of the people of\r\nthe town died thereof. It began about the 25th of July and continued\r\nvehemently until Martinmas, but was not clear of it before Lent; and\r\ndivers towns of the parish was infected with it, and many died thereof\r\nout of them, as Treales, Newton, Greenall, Estbrick, Thistleton. N.B.—The\r\ngreat mortality was in the year 1631; 304 died that year, and were buried\r\nat Kirkham, of whom 193 in the months of August and September”. Charles\r\nI. soon after ascending the throne in 1626, provoked a breach with his\r\nparliament by endeavouring to enforce subsidies, with which to carry on\r\nhis foreign wars, and further, he alienated the affections and respect of\r\nthe Puritan section of his subjects by confirming the regulations of the\r\n“Book of Sports.” Dissatisfaction and murmurings were quickly fermented\r\ninto rebellion, and the closing of the gates of Hull against the king\r\nin 1642 initiated those fearful wars, which desolated and disorganised\r\nthe country for so many years. In 1641, Alexander Rigby,[37] esq., of\r\nLayton Hall, Sir Gilbert de Hoghton, with eight other gentlemen, were\r\nremoved from the commission of the peace, by order of parliament, on\r\nsuspicion of being favourably disposed towards the royal party. The\r\nchief supporters of the king in the ensuing conflicts were the nobility,\r\nin great numbers; the higher orders of the gentry, and a considerable\r\nportion of their tenantry; all the High-churchmen; and a large majority\r\nof the Catholics. The parliamentarian army, on the other hand, was mainly\r\ncomposed of freeholders, traders, manufacturers, Puritans, Presbyterians,\r\nand Independents. An engagement near Wigan roused up the people in our\r\nvicinity to a sense of the dangers menacing them, and a public meeting\r\nof royalists was called at Preston under the presidency of the earl of\r\nDerby. Amongst other gentlemen who took a prominent part in the assembly\r\nwere Thomas Clifton, esq., of Lytham, and Alexander Rigby, esq., of\r\nLayton. Several resolutions were adopted, the most important being that\r\na sum of money, amounting to £8,700, should be raised and devoted to the\r\npayment of a regiment, consisting of 2,000 foot and 400 horse, in the\r\nfollowing scale of remuneration:—\r\n\r\n  DRAGOONERS.\r\n\r\n  Captain                  12s. 0d. per diem.\r\n  Lieutenant                6s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Cornet                    4s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Sergeant                  3s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Corporal                  2s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Dragooner                 1s. 6d.  ”   ”\r\n  Kettle-drum               2s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n\r\n  FOOT.\r\n\r\n  Captain                 10s. 0d. per diem.\r\n  Lieutenant               4s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Sergeant                 1s. 6d.  ”   ”\r\n  Drummer                  1s. 3d.  ”   ”\r\n  Corporal                 1s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Private                  0s. 9d.  ”   ”\r\n\r\n  HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Captain                 16s. 0d. per diem.\r\n  Lieutenant               8s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Cornet                   6s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Corporal                 4s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Trumpeter                5s. 0d.  ”   ”\r\n  Private                  2s. 6d.  ”   ”\r\n\r\n  And to every Commissary  5s. 0d. per diem.\r\n\r\nParliamentary commissioners were sent this year, 1642, into all parts of\r\nLancashire to visit the churches and chapels and to remove therefrom all\r\nimages, superstitious pictures, and idolatrous relics, which any of them\r\nmight contain.\r\n\r\nPreston and Lancaster were amongst the earliest towns to fall into\r\nthe hands of the Roundheads, and about ten days after the surrender\r\nof the former place, when the people of this district were labouring\r\nunder the excitement of war on their very frontier, Alexander Rigby,\r\nof Layton Hall, accompanied by Captain Thomas Singleton, of Staining,\r\nand other officers, appeared near Poulton at the head of a number of\r\nhorsemen, and threw the inhabitants into a state of great consternation\r\nand alarm, fortunately proving unnecessary, for the cavalcade had other\r\ndesigns than that of bringing devastation and bloodshed to their own\r\ndoors, and continued their journey peaceably northward. A few weeks\r\nlater a Spanish vessel was seen at the entrance of Morecambe Bay, off\r\nRossall Point, and as it evinced no signs of movement, either towards\r\nthe harbour of Lancaster or out to sea, the yeomen and farm servants of\r\nthat neighbourhood at once surmised that some sort of an invasive attack\r\nwas meditated on their coast, nor were these fears in any way allayed\r\nby the constant firing of a piece of cannon from the deck of the ship,\r\nand it was not until the discharges had been repeated through several\r\ndays that they realised that distress and not bombardment was intended\r\nto be indicated. On boarding the vessel they found that she contained a\r\nnumber of passengers, all of whom, together with the crew, were reduced\r\nto a pitiable and enfeebled condition through exposure and scarcity\r\nof provisions, for, having lost their way in the heavy weather which\r\nprevailed, they had been detained much over the time expected for the\r\nvoyage, blindly cruising about in the hope of discovering some friendly\r\nhaven or guide. The craft was piloted round into the mouth of the river\r\nWyre, opposite the Warren, and relief afforded to the sufferers. Rumour\r\nof the presence of the ship was not long in reaching the ears of the earl\r\nof Derby, who, with promptitude determined to march down and seize it in\r\nthe king’s name. On the Saturday he arrived at Lytham Hall with a small\r\ntroop of cavalry, where he sojourned for the night, with the intention\r\nof completing his journey and effecting his purpose the following day\r\nbefore the parliamentarians had got word of the matter; but here his\r\ncalculations were at fault, for the parliamentary leader had already\r\ndispatched four companies of infantry, under Major Sparrow, to take\r\npossession of the prize, and on the same Saturday evening they took up\r\ntheir quarters at Poulton and Singleton, having arrived by a different\r\nroute to the earl, who had forded the river at Hesketh Bank. On the\r\nSunday Major Sparrow, who throughout showed a lively horror of risking\r\nan encounter with the renowned nobleman, posted scouts with orders to\r\nwatch the direction taken by the latter, and convey the information\r\nwithout delay to the chief station at Poulton, where the soldiers were\r\nin readiness, not for action, as it subsequently turned out, but to put\r\na safe barrier between themselves and the enemy, for no sooner was it\r\nascertained that the earl, “all his company having their swords drawn,”\r\nwas marching along Layton Hawes towards Rossall, than Sparrow conducted\r\nhis force across the Wyre, at the Shard, and followed the course of the\r\nstream towards its outlet “until he came over against where the shipp\r\nlay, being as feared of the earle as the earle was of him.”[38] The earl\r\nof Derby advanced along the shore line and across the Warren to the mouth\r\nof the river without the naked weapons of his followers being called into\r\nservice, but finding when he boarded the ship that two parliamentary\r\ngentlemen had forestalled his intention by seizing her for the powers\r\nthey recognized, he unhesitatingly took them prisoners, and set fire\r\nto the vessel, whilst Sparrow and his men stood helplessly by, on the\r\nopposite side of the water, where the gallant major perhaps congratulated\r\nhimself on his caution in having avoided a collision with so prompt and\r\nvigorous a foe. Some of the Spaniards attached themselves to the train of\r\nthe earl, whilst others were scattered over the neighbourhood, depending\r\nfor subsistence upon the charity of the cottagers and farmers, but their\r\nfinal destiny is unknown. The noble general, enraged at the unlooked for\r\nfrustration of the main object of his journey, determined that it should\r\nnot be altogether fruitless, and on his return forced admittance into\r\nthe mansion of the Fleetwoods, at Rossall, and bore off all the arms he\r\ncould lay hands upon. Resuming his march he re-passed through Lytham,\r\nforded the Ribble, and finally made his way to Lathom House, his famous\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nInactivity, however temporary, was ill suited to the temperament of the\r\nearl, and on receiving the news that the solitary piece of artillery\r\nbelonging to the luckless Spanish vessel had been appropriated by\r\nthe parliamentary officials before he appeared upon the scene, and\r\ntransferred to their stronghold at Lancaster, he conceived the idea of\r\nreducing the ancient castle on the Lune, and so taking vengeance on\r\nthose who had anticipated him in the Wyre affair, as well as removing a\r\nformidable obstacle to the success of the royal arms. Before entering on\r\nan undertaking of such importance it was necessary that his small body of\r\ntroops should be materially increased, and after exhausting the districts\r\nsouth of the Ribble, he crossed it, in search of recruits amongst the\r\nyeomanry and peasantry of the Fylde. The earl lodged his soldiers in\r\nand about Kirkham, and fixed his own quarters at Lytham Hall. Dreadful\r\nstories are related by the old historian, from whose work we have already\r\nquoted, of the doings of the troops for the short time they remained\r\nin the neighbourhood, but it is only fair to state that their rapacity\r\nwas directed exclusively against the property of those whose sympathies\r\nwere with their opponents, whose houses and farms they plundered most\r\nmercilessly, driving off their horses, and carrying away ornaments,\r\nbedding, and everything which could either be turned to immediate use\r\nor offered a prospect of future gain. Warrants were issued on the first\r\nday of their arrival, from the head quarters at Lytham, over the whole\r\nof our section, calling upon every male above sixteen years of age and\r\nunder sixty, “upon payne of death to appear before his Honor at Kirkham\r\nthe next morning by eight of the clock, in their best weapons, to attend\r\nthe King’s service.”[39] The officers to whom fell the task of heralding\r\nthe mandate over the large area in the brief interval allowed, fulfilled\r\ntheir duties with energy, and a goodly company responded to the arbitrary\r\nsummons of the commander. After having seen that the fresh levies were as\r\nsuitably equipped for warfare as means would permit, the earl appointed\r\nJohn Hoole, of Singleton, and John Ambrose, of Wood Plumpton, as captains\r\nover them, and gave the order to march. On reaching Lancaster Lord Derby\r\nsummoned the mayor and burgesses to surrender the town and castle into\r\nhis hands, to which the chief magistrate replied that the inhabitants\r\nhad already been deprived of their arms and were unresisting, but that\r\nthe fortress, now garrisoned by parliamentary troops, was out of his\r\nkeeping, an answer so far unsatisfactory to the besieger that he set fire\r\nto the buildings, about one hundred and seventy of which were destroyed,\r\nand inflicted other injury on the place. Colonel Ashton, of Middleton,\r\nwho had been sent to relieve the castle, arrived too late, when the earl\r\nwas some distance on his return towards Preston, from which town he\r\ndislodged the enemy. A little later the tide of fortune turned against\r\nthe royalists, and the earl of Derby was one of the earliest to suffer\r\ndefeat. Colonel Thomas Tyldesley, a staunch partizan of the king, and\r\nthe father of Edward Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, Blackpool, retreated before\r\nColonel Ashton, from Wigan to Lathom, and afterwards to Liverpool, where\r\nhe was besieged and forced again to fly by his indefatigable opponent.\r\n(Later he distinguished himself at Burton-on-Trent, by the desperate\r\nheroism with which he led a cavalry charge over a bridge of thirty-six\r\narches, and for that display of valour as well as his faithful adherence\r\nto Charles, he received the honour of knighthood.) Driven from Liverpool,\r\nTyldesley, in company with Lord Molyneux, withdrew the remnant of his\r\nregiment towards the Ribble, crossed that stream, and quartered his men\r\nin Kirkham, whilst Molyneux occupied the village of Clifton. In these\r\nplaces they rested a night and a day, keeping a vigilant look out for\r\ntheir pursuer, Ashton, from the old windmill, situated at the east end\r\nof Kirkham. About one o’clock on the day succeeding the evening of their\r\narrival the soldiers, acting under orders, repaired to their several\r\nlodgings to further refresh themselves after their prolonged fatigues,\r\nbut before four hours had elapsed, a report came from the outpost that\r\nthe enemy was approaching. An alarm spread through the camp, and with\r\ndifficulty Lord Molyneux and Colonel Tyldesley assembled their forces in\r\nthe town of Kirkham, where they elected once more to make a stand against\r\nthe victorious Ashton. Command was given that all the women and children\r\nshould confine themselves within doors, and preparations were hurried\r\nforward to offer the parliamentarians a vigorous resistance; but as\r\ndaylight waned and the besiegers were momentarily expected, the courage\r\nof the royal troops seems to have oozed away, and they precipitately\r\nvacated the town, fording the Wyre, and flying towards Stalmine, whence\r\nthey continued their retreat to Cockerham, and so on northwards.\r\nWhen Colonel Ashton entered Kirkham he found the enemy gone and the\r\ninhabitants in a state of extreme trepidation, but their fears were soon\r\ndismissed by the action of the gallant soldier who, on learning the\r\ncourse taken by Tyldesley and Molyneux, pushed on without delay. Ashton\r\nfollowed up the pursuit as far as the boundaries of Lancashire, without\r\novertaking any of the royalists, and then returned to Preston. The rear\r\nof his troops diverged from the main road at Garstang, unknown to their\r\nleader, and marched into the Fylde for plunder. They passed through St.\r\nMichael’s, and visiting the residence and estate of Christopher Parker,\r\nof Bradkirk, drove away many of his cattle, and stripped his house of\r\neverything of value. In Kirkham they laid the people under heavy toll,\r\nand even spared not those who were notoriously well affected towards\r\nparliament. At Clifton they found more herds of cattle, which were joined\r\nto those already with them; but at Preston they fell to quarrelling over\r\nthe booty, and it is questionable whether their ill-gotten stores did not\r\nprove rather a curse than a blessing to them.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1643, the year in which the events just narrated\r\noccurred, Thurland Castle, the seat of Sir John Girlington, was captured\r\nby the parliamentary colonel, Alexander Rigby, of Middleton, near\r\nPreston. In the engagement the Lancashire troops were under the command\r\nof Alexander Rigby, of Layton, who allowed his small regiment to be\r\nsurprised and routed by his namesake. After his success at Thurland,\r\nColonel Rigby, of Middleton, proceeded to raise fresh levies in\r\nAmounderness. Mr. Clayton, of Fulwood Moor, was appointed to superintend\r\nthe whole of the recruiting and directed to place himself at the head of\r\nthe new regiment. Mr. Patteson, of Ribby, and Mr. Wilding, of Kirkham,\r\nwere each apportioned half of the parish bearing the latter name, in\r\nwhich they were respectively ordered to raise a company. In the parishes\r\nof Poulton and Bispham, Mr. Robert Jolly, of Warbreck, Mr. William\r\nHull, of Bispham, Mr. Richard Davis, of Newton, and Mr. Rowland Amon,\r\nof Thornton, were made captains, and had similar duties imposed upon\r\nthem. In Lytham parish, Mr. George Sharples, of Freckleton, received a\r\ncommission, but was unable to muster more than a very few followers, as\r\nthe people of that neighbourhood reflected the loyal sentiments of the\r\nlord of the manor, and could neither be coerced nor seduced from their\r\nallegiance to the king. Captains Richard Smith and George Carter, of\r\nHambleton, raised companies in Stalmine, Hambleton, and the adjacent\r\ntownships and villages. Mr. William Swarbrick recruited a company in his\r\nnative parish of St. Michael’s, and Mr. Duddell obtained another in Wood\r\nPlumpton.\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Bolton, in May, 1644, when the town was stormed and\r\nsurrendered after a valiant resistance, to Prince Rupert, with an army of\r\nover nine thousand royalists, Duddell and Davis were amongst the officers\r\nslain, whilst their companies were literally cut to pieces. Captain\r\nGeorge Sharples, of Freckleton, was taken prisoner, and dragged, almost\r\nnaked and barefooted, through the miry and blood-stained streets to the\r\nspot where Cuthbert, the eldest son of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, was\r\nstanding after the carnage, in which he had led a party of the besiegers.\r\nCaptain Clifton and others near him were in a mood for a somewhat rude\r\nand ungenerous entertainment, and placed the hapless Sharples, in his\r\ndilapidated attire, in a prominent position and, thrusting a Psalter into\r\nhis hand, compelled him to sing a Psalm for their delectation. After\r\nthey had amused themselves in such fashion for some time the prisoner\r\nwas handed over to the guard, from whom he ultimately made his escape.\r\nCaptain Cuthbert Clifton was elevated to the rank of colonel as an\r\nacknowledgment of his gallant services at Bolton, after which he returned\r\nfor a few days into the Fylde, where he engaged himself in procuring a\r\nfresh detachment of soldiers, who readily flocked to his standard. For\r\ntheir provision and comfort he did not hesitate or scruple to appropriate\r\na number of cattle on Layton Hawes, and to relieve some of the Puritans\r\nof Kirkham, Bispham, and Poulton, of their bedding, etc. Having fully\r\nsupplied his commissariat department by these means, he marched to\r\nLiverpool, and joining Prince Rupert, was present at the sacking of that\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War had proved most disastrous to Lancashire, where the\r\nconstant movements and frequent collisions of the contending parties\r\nhad ruined the towns, destroyed almost all attempts at agriculture,\r\nand reduced the inhabitants to a state of wretchedness and poverty,\r\nin many instances to the verge of starvation; and notwithstanding the\r\nfact that in not one single instance had the Fylde been the scene of an\r\nencounter, the people of this section were in as lamentable a condition\r\nof penury and suffering as those of the less fortunate districts, a\r\ncircumstance not to be wondered at when the incessant plunderings are\r\ntaken into consideration, and when it is remembered that the youth and\r\nstrength of the neighbourhood were serving as volunteers or recruits,\r\neither under the banner of parliament or that of the king. The 12th of\r\nSeptember, 1644, was appointed by the Puritans as a day of solemn prayer\r\nand fasting throughout the country, and parliament decreed that half of\r\nthe money collected “in all the churches within the cities of London and\r\nWestminster and within the lines of communication,” should be devoted to\r\nthe relief of the distressed and impoverished in this county.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Tyldesley accompanied the army of Prince Rupert to York, near\r\nto where the sanguinary and famous battle of Marston Moor, in which no\r\nless than sixty thousand men were engaged on both sides, was fought on\r\nthe 2nd of July, 1644. Oliver Cromwell commanded the parliamentarians\r\nin person, and after a fierce struggle discomfited the troops of Prince\r\nRupert and drove them in confusion from the field. Sir Thomas Tyldesley\r\nretreated with his shattered regiment in hot haste towards Amounderness,\r\nwhere he made diligent search for arms and ammunition, but hearing\r\nthat the enemy, under Sir John Meldrum, was marching in quest of him\r\nhe hurried to the banks of the Ribble, and crossed the ford into the\r\nFylde. This latter incident happened towards the end of the week, and\r\non Saturday he was joined in his ambush by the immense royalist force\r\nof Colonel Goring, so great indeed that “before the last companies had\r\nmarched over the bridge at St. Michael’s Church the first company was\r\njudged to be at Kirkham.”[40] There is probably some little exaggeration\r\nin the quoted statement, but even allowing it to be verbally correct,\r\nthere can be no doubt that it is unintentionally misleading, as the\r\nextreme length of road covered would be due more to the wide intervals\r\nbetween the companies and the straggling manner in which they proceeded\r\nthan to their actual numerical strength. Nevertheless the detachment,\r\nchiefly composed of cavalry, was enormous, and completely inundated the\r\ntowns and villages in the parishes of Poulton, Kirkham, and Lytham.\r\nThe men were lodged twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, and even sixty in a\r\nhouse, and on the Sunday morning they set out on an errand of pilfering\r\nwithout respect to persons, pillaging those who were friendly with as\r\nmuch eagerness and apparent satisfaction as others who were inimical to\r\ntheir cause, an impartiality so little appreciated by the inhabitants\r\nthat they are said to have blessed the Roundheads by comparison with\r\nthese insatiate freebooters. Horses, money, clothes, sheets, everything\r\nthat was portable or could be driven, was greedily seized upon, and, in\r\nspite of threats and entreaties, remorselessly borne away. Hundreds of\r\nhouseholds were stripped not only of their ornaments, bedding, etc., but\r\neven of the very implements on which the family depended for subsistence.\r\nIt is in truth no figure of speech to state that by far the larger share\r\nof the people were reduced to utter and seemingly hopeless destitution,\r\nand grateful indeed were they when their portion of the parliamentary\r\ngrant of collections in the metropolis, before mentioned, was distributed\r\namongst them, coming like manna from the heavens to comfort their\r\ndesolated homes. To add insult to injury the graceless troopers compelled\r\ntheir entertainers to employ the Sabbath in winnowing corn in the fields\r\nfor their chargers, and even refused to allow them to erect the usual\r\ncurtains to protect the grain from being carried away by the high wind,\r\nso that the loss and waste amounted to barely less than the quantity\r\nutilised as fodder, and completely exhausted the fruits of their harvest.\r\nSir Thomas Tyldesley, Lord Molyneux, and others of the leaders, fixed\r\ntheir lodgment near the residence of a gentleman named Richard Harrison,\r\nand were supplied with necessaries from Mowbreck Hall. Freckleton marsh\r\nwas the rendezvous, and there the entire forces assembled on the morning\r\nof Monday, but were compelled to remain until one o’clock at noon before\r\nthe Ribble was fordable, when they took their departure, to the intense\r\njoy of all those who had trembled for their lives and suffered ruin in\r\ntheir small properties during their brief sojourn. Sir John Meldrum\r\nappeared in the district only a few hours after the royalists had left,\r\nand thus the Fylde had again a narrow escape of adding one more to\r\nthe long list of unnatural battles, most truly described as suicidal\r\nmassacres of the nation, where men ignoring the ties of friendship or\r\nkinship imbrued their swords in the blood of each other with a relentless\r\nand inhuman savagery, reviving as it seemed the horrid butcheries of the\r\ndark ages. Sir John Meldrum hastened in the direction of the retreating\r\nfoe, but failed to overtake them.\r\n\r\n“In 1645,” writes Rushworth, “there remained of unreduced garrisons\r\nbelonging to the king in Lancashire only Lathom House and Greenhalgh\r\nCastle.”[41] This castle was erected about half a mile eastward of\r\nGarstang, overlooking the Wyre, by Thomas, the first earl of Derby, in\r\n1490, after the victory of Bosworth Field, as a protection from certain\r\nof the outlawed nobles, whose estates in that vicinity had rewarded the\r\nservices of the earl to Henry VII. The castle was built in a rectangular\r\nform almost approaching to a square, with a tower at each angle. The\r\nedifice was surrounded and protected by a wide moat. The garrison\r\noccupying the small fortress at the date under consideration held out\r\nuntil the death of the governor, when a capitulation was made, and,\r\nabout 1649, the castle was dismantled. In 1772 Penant spoke of the “poor\r\nremains of Greenhalgh Castle.”[42]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Lathom House and other strongholds of the king and the\r\nsurrender of Charles himself to the Scotch army of Puritans, brought\r\nthe contests for a time to a close in 1647, and Sir Thomas Tyldesley,\r\nwith several more, received instructions to disband the troops under\r\nhis command. During the foregoing struggles parliament, in order to\r\nprovide the necessary funds for the increased expenditure, had allowed\r\n“delinquents, papists, spies, and intelligencers” to compound for their\r\nsequestered estates, and amongst those connected with this locality who\r\nhad taken advantage of the permission were:—\r\n\r\n  Brown, Edward, of Plumpton,      compounded for £127 8s. 0d.\r\n  Breres, Alexander, of Marton, gent.,    ”        £82 4s. 5d.\r\n  Bate, John, of Warbreck,                ”        £11 0s. 0d.\r\n  Leckonby, Richard, of Elswick, esq.,    ”        £58 6s. 0d.\r\n  Nicholson, Francis, of Poulton, yeoman  ”       £133 3s. 4d.\r\n  Rigby, Alexander, of Layton, esq.,      ”       £381 3s. 4d.\r\n  Walker, William, of Kirkham, gent.,     ”       £175 0s. 0d.\r\n  Westby, John, of Mowbreck, esq.,        ”     £1,000 0s. 0d.\r\n\r\nPresbyterianism became the national, or at least, the state religion, and\r\nfor the regulation of ecclesiastical matters the Assembly of Divines, at\r\nWestminster, suggested that the country should be divided into provinces,\r\nwhose representatives should hold annual conferences at the larger towns.\r\nThe county of Lancaster was divided into nine Classical Presbyteries,\r\nand the seventh Classis, embracing the parishes of Preston, Kirkham,\r\nGarstang, and Poulton, consisted of—\r\n\r\n  Mr. Isaac Ambrose, of Preston, minister.\r\n  Mr. Robert Yates, of Preston, minister.\r\n  Mr. Ed. Fleetwood, of Kirkham, minister.\r\n  Mr. Thos. Cranage, of Goosnargh, minister.\r\n  Mr. Chr. Edmondson, of Garstang, minister.\r\n  Mr. John Sumner, of Poulton, minister.\r\n\r\nLAYMEN.\r\n\r\n  Alexander Rigby, of Preston, Esq.\r\n  William Langton, Esq.\r\n  Alderman Matt. Addison, of Preston, gent.\r\n  Alderman Wm. Sudall, of Preston, gent.\r\n  Alderman Wm. Cottam, of Preston, gent.\r\n  Edward Downes, of Wesham, gent.\r\n  Edmund Turner, of Goosnargh, yeoman.\r\n  Thomas Nickson, of Plumpton, gent.\r\n  Robt. Crane, of Layton, gent.\r\n  Wm. Latewise, of Catterall, gent.\r\n  Wm. Whitehead, of Garstang, gent.\r\n  Edward Veale, of Layton, Esq.\r\n  Rd. Wilkins, of Kirkham, yeoman.\r\n\r\nOne of the duties of these Classes was to examine, ordain, and appoint\r\nministers, or presbyters, as they were called, whenever vacancies\r\noccurred in the district over which, respectively, they had jurisdiction;\r\nsubjoined is the certificate given in the case of Cuthbert Harrison,\r\nB.A., when selected and appointed presbyter of Singleton chapel:—\r\n\r\n  “Whereas Cuthbert Harrison, B.A., aged 30 years, hath addressed\r\n  himself to us, authorised by ordinance of parliament of 22 Aug.\r\n  1646, for ordination of ministers, desiring to be ordained a\r\n  presbyter, being chosen by the inhabitants within the chapelry\r\n  of Singleton to officiate there; and having been examined by us\r\n  the ministers of the Seventh Classis, and found sufficiently\r\n  qualified for the ministerial functions, according to the rules\r\n  preserved in the said ordinance, and thereupon approved—we have\r\n  this day solemnly set him apart to the office of presbyter and\r\n  work of the ministry of the gospel, by laying on of hands by us\r\n  present, with fasting and prayer, by virtue whereof we declare\r\n  him to be a lawful and sufficiently authorised minister of Jesus\r\n  Christ. In testimony whereof we have hereunto put our hands the\r\n  27th Nov., 1651.”\r\n\r\n  (Here follow the signatures.)\r\n\r\nIn 1648 General Langdale, a royalist officer, appealed to the loyalty\r\nof the northern counties to attempt a rescue of the imprisoned monarch\r\nfrom the hands of his enemies. Many rushed to his standard, and the\r\nparliamentarians of the Fylde shared the general consternation which\r\npervaded Lancashire at the success of his effort to rekindle the still\r\nsmouldering embers of civil war. There is no necessity to trace the steps\r\nof this ill-judged enterprise to its disastrous issue, but suffice it to\r\nsay that the defeat and routing of the little army was followed at a very\r\nshort interval by the execution of Charles I., after a formal trial in\r\nwhich he disclaimed the jurisdiction of the court.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of June, 1650, a meeting of Commissioners under the Great\r\nSeal of England was held at Preston—“for inquiring into and certeifying\r\nof the certeine numbers and true yearely value of all parsonages and\r\nvicariges presentative, of all and every the sp’uall and eccli’call\r\nbenefices, livings, and donatives within the said countye”; and after\r\nexamining the good and lawful men of Kirkham and Lytham, it was\r\nrecommended by the assembly that Goosnargh and Whittingham should be\r\nformed into a separate parish on account of their great distance from\r\nthe church at Kirkham. At this inquiry it was also stated that—“the\r\ninhabitants of Newsham desired to be annexed to Woodplumpton; the\r\ninhabitants of Clifton and Salwick, together with the inhabitants of\r\nNewton-cum-Scales, and the upper end of Treales, desired to be united in\r\none parish. Singleton chappell, newly erected, desired that it might be\r\nmade a parish. The inhabitants of Weeton-cum-Preese desired that that\r\ntownship might be made a parish, and the inhabitants of Rawcliffe desired\r\nto be annexed to it. The townships of Rigby-cum-Wraye, and of Warton, and\r\nof Kellamore-cum-Bryning, and Westbye-cum-Plumpton, all humbly desired to\r\nbe made a parish. The several townships of Eccleston Parva-cum-Labrecke,\r\nand the inhabitants of Medlar and Thistleton, and the inhabitants of\r\nRossaker-cum-Wharles, desired to be annexed to Elswick, and that it\r\nmight be made a parish.” Although at that time these petitions failed\r\nin obtaining their objects, much the same thing has been accomplished in\r\nmore recent years by Lord Blandford’s Act, by which separate parochial\r\ndistricts, as far as ecclesiastical matters are concerned, have been\r\nappropriated to each church, thus rendering it independent of the\r\nmother-church of the ancient parish in which it might happen to be\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nIn 1651 the son of the unfortunate monarch, who had been proclaimed king\r\nby the Scotch under the title of Charles II., crossed the frontier and\r\ninvaded England with a force of fourteen thousand men. That year the earl\r\nof Derby, Sir Thomas Tyldesley, and several other officers, sailed from\r\nthe Isle of Man, whither they had retired, in obedience to the call of\r\nthe young prince, and landed either on the Warren, at the mouth of the\r\nriver Wyre, or at Skippool higher up the stream, with a regiment of two\r\nhundred and fifty infantry and sixty cavalry. Two of the vessels grounded\r\nduring the operation of disembarking the horses, and in the heavy winds\r\nthat ensued were reduced to total wrecks. As soon as the news of the\r\nearl of Derby’s arrival on the banks of the Wyre was rumoured abroad,\r\n“all the ships,” says the _Perfect Diurnall_, “were wafted out of the\r\nrivers of Liverpool, and set sail with a fair wind fore Wirewater, where\r\nthe Frigots rid that brought the Lord Derby over with his company, to\r\nsurprise them and prevent his Lordship escaping any way by water.” The\r\nearl marched through the Fylde, but the martial ardour of the inhabitants\r\nwas not so readily excited as on former occasions, for the recollection\r\nof their abusive and piratical treatment by the troopers of Colonel\r\nGoring, in 1644, was still fresh in their minds, and effectually checked\r\nany feelings of enthusiasm at seeing the royal banners once again\r\nunfurled in their midst. A scattered few, however, there were who were\r\nwilling to forget the misdeeds of the agents in their eagerness for the\r\nsuccess of the cause, and with such meagre additions to his strength the\r\nearl hastened on. At Preston he raised six hundred horse, and shortly\r\nafterwards encountered the parliamentarians, under Colonel Lilburne,\r\nat Wigan-lane, where the royalists were defeated with great slaughter.\r\nSir Thomas Tyldesley was slain, and the gallant earl escaped from the\r\nfield only to be taken prisoner in Cheshire and suffer the fate of his\r\nlate regal master, Charles I. Alexander Rigby, the grandson of the\r\nAlexander Rigby, of Layton, before mentioned, and only seventeen years of\r\nage, also took part in this eventful engagement, and twenty-eight years\r\nsubsequently, when High Sheriff of the county of Lancaster, erected a\r\nmonument to the memory of Major-General Sir Thomas Tyldesley near the\r\nspot where he fell. So universally esteemed was the valiant knight for\r\nhis bravery and honourable conduct that the title of “Chevalier sans peur\r\net sans reproche” was conferred upon him alike by friends and enemies.\r\nCharles II., after the overthrow of his army by Cromwell, adopted the\r\ndisguise of a peasant, and having narrowly escaped detection by hiding\r\nhimself amidst the foliage of an oak tree, fled at the first opportunity\r\nover to France. Cromwell was now installed in the chief seat of authority\r\nand held the reins of government under the style of Lord Protector.\r\n\r\nIn 1660, two years after the death of Cromwell, Charles II. was recalled\r\nand placed upon the throne; and in 1662 a law was passed by which it was\r\nenacted that before St. Bartholomew’s Day of that year, all ministers\r\nshould arrange their services according to the rules contained in the new\r\nbook of Common Prayer, under pain of dismissal from their preferments.\r\nThe following letter was received by the churchwardens of Garstang,\r\nordering the ejectment of the Rev. Isaac Ambrose, who was a member of the\r\nfamily of Ambrose of Ambrose Hall, in Wood Plumpton, from his benefice on\r\naccount of his refusal to conform to the arbitrary regulation:—\r\n\r\n  “Whereas in a late act of Parliament for uniformitie, it is\r\n  enacted that every parson, vicar, curate, lecturer, or other\r\n  ecclesiasticall person, neglecting or refusing, before the Feast\r\n  Day of St. Bartholomew, 1662, to declare openly before their\r\n  respective congregations, his assent and consent to all things\r\n  contained in the book of common prayer established by the said\r\n  act, _ipso facto_, be deposed, and that every person not being in\r\n  holy orders by episcopall ordination, and every parson, vicar,\r\n  curate, lecturer, or other ecclesiasticall person, failing in\r\n  his subscription to a declaration mentioned in the said act to\r\n  be subscribed before the Feast Day of St. Bartholomew, 1662,\r\n  shall be utterly disabled, and _ipso facto_ deprived, and his\r\n  place be void, as if the person so failing be naturally dead. And\r\n  whereas Isaac Ambrose, late Vicar of Garstang, in the county of\r\n  Lancaster, hath neglected to declare and subscribe according to\r\n  the tenor of the said act, I doe therefore declare the church of\r\n  Garstang to be now void, and doe strictly charge the said Isaac\r\n  Ambrose, late vicar of the said church, to forbear preaching,\r\n  lecturing, or officiating in the said church, or elsewhere in\r\n  the diocese of Chester. And the churchwardens of the said parish\r\n  of Garstang are hereby required (as by duty they are bound) to\r\n  secure and preserve the said parish church of Garstang from any\r\n  invasion or intrusion of the said Isaac Ambrose, disabled and\r\n  deprived as above said by the said act, and the churchwardens are\r\n  also required upon sight hereof to show this order to the said\r\n  Isaac Ambrose, and cause the same to be published next Sunday\r\n  after in the Parish Church of Garstang, before the congregation,\r\n  as they will answer the contrary.—Given under my hand this 29th\r\n  day of August, 1662.\r\n\r\n                                                   “Geo. Cestriens.\r\n\r\n  “To the Churchwardens of Garstang, in the County Palatine of\r\n  Lancaster.”\r\n\r\nIn this county sixty-seven ministers refused to submit to the mandate,\r\nand were removed from their churches by the authority of documents\r\nsimilar to the above, and prohibited from officiating in their priestly\r\ncapacity anywhere within the diocese. Amongst the number, so interdicted,\r\nwere the Rev. W. Bullock, of Hambleton, the Rev. Joseph Harrison, of Lund\r\nchapel, and the Rev. Nathaniel Baxter, M.A., of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre.\r\nThe Nonconformists were subsequently subjected to even greater harshness\r\nand injustice by an act which decreed that no clergyman, belonging to any\r\nof their sects, should reside within five miles of the town or place at\r\nwhich he had last preached, unless he took an oath as under:—\r\n\r\n  “I do swear that it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatsoever,\r\n  to take arms against the king, and that I do abhor the traitorous\r\n  position of taking arms against his authority; against his\r\n  person; or against those that are commissioned by him, in\r\n  pursuance of such commissions; and that I will not at any time\r\n  endeavour any alteration of government either in church or state.”\r\n\r\nThe sufferings experienced by those ministers who had been deprived\r\nof their benefices are described as having been extreme, nay, almost\r\nintolerable, and it was doubtless owing to the great severity practised\r\ntowards the body of Nonconformists that the old creed gained such little\r\npopularity for some time after its re-establishment.\r\n\r\nCharles II., soon after the restoration of monarchy at his coronation,\r\ndetermined to create a new order of knighthood, to be called the “Royal\r\nOak,” as a reward to some of the more distinguished of his faithful\r\nadherents, and amongst the number selected for the honour were Col.\r\nKirkby, of Upper Rawcliffe, Richard Butler, of Out Rawcliffe, and Edward\r\nTyldesley, of Fox Hall, Blackpool.[43] The design was shortly abandoned\r\nby the advice of the crown ministers, who foresaw that the necessarily\r\nlimited distribution of the distinction would give rise to jealousy and\r\nanimosity amongst those who had been active in the late wars.\r\n\r\nIn 30 Charles II. a statute was passed entitled “An act for lessening the\r\nimportation of linen from beyond the seas, and the encouragement of the\r\nwoollen and paper manufactories of the kingdom”; and by it was provided,\r\nunder a penalty of £5, half of which was to be distributed to the poor of\r\nthe parish, that at every interment throughout the country a certificate\r\nshould be presented to the officiating minister stating that the winding\r\nsheet of the deceased person was composed of woollen material and not of\r\nlinen, as heretofore. The certificate ordered to be used at every burial\r\nran thus:—\r\n\r\n  “_A_, of the parish of _B_, in the county of _C_, maketh Oath\r\n  that _D_, of the parish of _B_, in the county of _C_, lately\r\n  deceased, was not put in, wrapt or wound up or Buried, in any\r\n  Shirt, Shift, Sheet, or Shroud, made or mingled with Flax, Hemp,\r\n  Silk, Hair, Gold, or Silver, or other than that which is made\r\n  of Sheep’s Wool only. Nor in any Coffin lined or faced with any\r\n  cloth, stuff, or anything whatsoever, made or mingled with Flax,\r\n  Hemp, Silk, Hair, Gold, or Silver, or any other material but\r\n  Sheep’s Wool only.\r\n\r\n  “Dated the ... day of ... in the xxxth year of the reign of our\r\n  Sovereign Lord, Charles the second, king of England, Scotland,\r\n  France, and Ireland, etc.\r\n\r\n  “Sealed and Subscribed by us, who were present and witnesses to\r\n  the Swearing of the above said affidavit\r\n\r\n                                     (Signatures of two witnesses.)\r\n\r\n  “I, ..., esq., one of the King’s Majesties Justices of the Peace\r\n  for the County above said, do hereby certify that the day and\r\n  year above said _A_ came before me and made such affidavit as is\r\n  above specified according to the late Act of Parliament, entitled\r\n  An Act for burying in Woollen.\r\n\r\n                                                      (Signature.)”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statute was amended two years later, and the modified\r\nenactment continued in force for some time, when it was repealed. In the\r\nregisters of old churches, such as Bispham, Poulton, Kirkham, and St.\r\nMichael’s-on-Wyre, where they have been preserved, notices of burials\r\naccording to this regulation during the two years it was in operation,\r\nmay be seen; and amongst the records of the Thirty-men, or governing body\r\nof Kirkham, is an entry of expenses incurred when they went “to justice\r\nStanley” to obtain his authority to “demand 50s. for Tomlinson’s wife\r\nburied in linen,” contrary to the law.\r\n\r\nThree years from the accession of James II., his repeated attempts to\r\ncurtail the civil and religious liberties of his subjects had so far\r\nincensed them against him that William, Prince of Orange, was invited\r\nover to free them from his rule. In 1688 James abdicated the throne, and\r\nthe following year William and Mary were crowned at Westminster. Annexed\r\nis a list of the gentry residing in the Fylde from the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., to their accession, as prepared from original records and private\r\nmanuscripts:—\r\n\r\n  Allen of Rossall Hall.\r\n  Ambrose of Ambrose Hall.\r\n  Bradley of Bryning.\r\n  Bradshaw of Preese and Scales.\r\n  Butler of Rawcliffe Hall.\r\n  Butler of Layton and Hackensall.\r\n  Clifton of Westby.\r\n  Eccleston of Great Eccleston Hall.\r\n  Fleetwood of Plumpton.\r\n  Fleetwood of Rossall Hall.\r\n  Hesketh of Mains Hall.\r\n  Kirkby of Upper Rawcliffe.\r\n  Kirkby of Mowbreck.\r\n  Leigh of Singleton.\r\n  Longworth of St. Michael’s Hall.\r\n  Lowde of Kirkham.\r\n  Massey of Carleton.\r\n  Molyneux of Larbrick Hall.\r\n  Parker of Bradkirk Hall.\r\n  Rigby of Layton Hall.\r\n  Sharples of Freckleton.\r\n  Shuttleworth of Larbrick.\r\n  Singleton of Singleton.\r\n  Singleton of Staining Hall.\r\n  Stanley of Great Eccleston Hall.\r\n  Tyldesley of Fox Hall, Blackpool.\r\n  Veale of Whinney Heys.\r\n  Westby of Rawcliffe.\r\n  Westby of Mowbreack and Burn Halls.\r\n\r\nJames II., when force of circumstances had driven him into exile, left\r\na considerable number of supporters behind him, chiefly amongst the\r\nRoman Catholics, who were not dilatory in devising schemes for his\r\nre-establishment. On the 16th of May, 1690, Robert Dodsworth deposed\r\nupon oath, before Lord Chief Justice Holt, that the following Popish\r\ngentry of the Fylde, amongst others, had entered into a conspiracy to\r\nrestore James, and that they had received commissions as indicated for\r\nthe purpose of raising troops to carry out the enterprise:—Colonel\r\nThomas Tyldesley, son of the late Sir Thomas; Captains Ralph Tyldesley,\r\nson of the late Sir Thomas; Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, nephew to\r\nthe two preceding; Richard Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall, and Henry, his\r\neldest son; Thomas Westby, of Mowbreck Hall, and William, his third\r\nson, who was designated a lieutenant; and Lieutenant Richard Stanley,\r\nof Great Eccleston Hall. Nothing is recorded as to the result of the\r\nabove information, but in 1694 Sir Thomas Clifton, brother to Cuthbert\r\nClifton, of Lytham, was arraigned, with several more, on a charge of\r\ntreason in connection with a reported Jacobite plot, but was acquitted,\r\nas also were those with him. During the course of the trial, Thomas\r\nPatten, of Preston, as witness to the loyalty of Sir Thomas Clifton to\r\nthe existing government, stated that “in 1689 he received orders from\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant to secure several Popish gentlemen, and that amongst\r\nthem Sir Thomas Clifton was one who was taken and brought prisoner to\r\nPreston upon the 16th day of June in that year; that Sir Thomas being a\r\nvery infirm man and unfit to be carried so far as Manchester, which was\r\nthe place where the rest of the Popish gentlemen then made prisoners were\r\nsecured, he undertook for Sir Thomas, and prevailed to have him kept\r\nat his (Patten’s) own house in Preston, where he continued prisoner,\r\nand was not discharged until the January following, at which time all\r\nthe gentlemen were set at liberty; that during Sir Thomas Clifton’s\r\nconfinement he expressed to him much zeal and affection to the present\r\ngovernment, saying how much the persons of his religion ought to be\r\nsatisfied with their usage, as putting no difference betwixt them and\r\nother subjects save the public exercise of their religion, so long as\r\nthey themselves would be quiet, and protested for himself that he could\r\nnever endure to think of practising any change.” Further Mr. Patten\r\naffirmed “that he knew Sir Thomas’s disposition to have always been\r\npeaceful and quiet.” During the time that James II. was engaged in\r\ninciting the Irish nation to espouse his cause and furnish him with an\r\narmy to invade England and regain his throne, Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox\r\nHall, prepared a secret chamber in that mansion for his reception. The\r\ndisastrous battle of the Boyne, however, in which James was vanquished\r\nby William, Prince of Orange, and King of England, crushed all hope of\r\nfuture success in the fallen monarch, and at the earliest opportunity he\r\nescaped to France. In 1715, during the reign of George I., his son, the\r\nChevalier de St. George was proclaimed king in Scotland under the title\r\nof James III. The earl of Mar and several other influential supporters\r\nof the Stuarts assembled a large force and marched southwards; on\r\narriving at the border five hundred of the Highlanders refused to proceed\r\nfurther, but the remainder passed through the northern counties as far\r\nas Preston. Here they were besieged by the loyal troops under Generals\r\nCarpenter and Wills, who stormed the town and forced the rebels to an\r\nunconditional surrender. Many of the leaders were executed, whilst others\r\nwere incarcerated for various terms; the general treatment of their\r\nunfortunate followers may be gleaned from the journal of William Stout,\r\nof Lancaster, in which it is written:—“After the rebellion was suppressed\r\nabout 400 of the rebels were brought to Lancaster Castle, and a regiment\r\nof Dragoons was quartered in the town to guard them. The king allowed\r\nthem each 4d. a day for maintenance, viz., 2d. in bread, 1d. in cheese,\r\nand 1d. in small beer. And they laid on straw in stables most of them,\r\nand in a month’s time about 100 of them were conveyed to Liverpool to be\r\ntried, where they were convicted and near 40 of them hanged at Preston,\r\nGarstang, Lancaster, etc.; and about 200 of them continued a year, and\r\nabout 50 of them died, and the rest were transported to America.” Thomas\r\nTyldesley, of Fox Hall, died in 1715, just before the outbreak of the\r\nrebellion, but his son Edward, who succeeded him, joined the rebels.\r\nFor this act of treason he was put on his trial, but escaped conviction\r\nand punishment through the favour of the jury, by whom he was acquitted\r\nin spite of clear and reliable evidence that he had entered Preston at\r\nthe head of a company of insurgents with a drawn sword in his hand.\r\nAfter the capitulation, when the king’s troops had entered the town and\r\nwere marching along the streets, many men from our district, who had\r\ncongregated on Spiral’s Moss, armed with fowling pieces and implements\r\nof husbandry, joined their ranks, and a huge duck-gun belonging to a\r\nyeoman named Jolly, from Mythorp, near Blackpool, was instrumental in\r\ndoing good service to the besiegers by slaying one Mayfield, of the\r\nAshes, Goosnargh. The rebel had secreted himself behind a chimney on one\r\nof the houses, and was engaged in picking off the loyal soldiers as they\r\nmade their way along the thoroughfare below. His murderous fire was at\r\nlength put an end to by a charge from the famed gun of Jolly, whose keen\r\neye had detected the assassin in his hiding place. Jolly himself appears\r\nto have had an aversion to causing the death of a fellow-creature in\r\ncold blood, even though a rebel, and the credit of the shot is due to\r\na soldier, whose own weapon failed in reaching the object. The Rev. W.\r\nThornber tells us in his History of Blackpool, that the family of the\r\nJollys, for many years, treasured up the wonderful gun, and that the tale\r\nof its exploit was circulated far and wide in the neighbourhood of their\r\nhome. From the remarks of the Rev.—Patten, who accompanied the army of\r\nthe Chevalier, as chaplain to General Forster, we learn that those who\r\njoined the insurgents in Lancashire were chiefly Papists, and that the\r\nmembers of the High-church party held aloof, much to the disappointment\r\nand chagrin of General Forster, who, in his anger, declared “that for\r\nthe time to come he would never again believe a drunken tory.” Edward\r\nTyldesley, Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall, and his son Richard Butler,\r\nwere the most distinguished personages amongst the small body of men\r\nbelonging to this section who openly espoused the cause of the Pretender.\r\nThe paucity of the recruits attracted by the insurgent standard from our\r\nneighbourhood is easily to be accounted for, when it is remembered that\r\nfor many years the county of Lancashire had enjoyed an immunity from\r\nstrifes and disturbances, so that the inhabitants of the rural districts,\r\nsuch as the Fylde, had settled down to the cultivation of the soil, and\r\nwould care little to assist in a work which as far as they were privately\r\nconcerned, could only terminate in the devastation of their fields,\r\nand, probably, in the ruin of many of their households. Especially,\r\nin 1715, would the people be disinclined to take part in or encourage\r\ninsurrectionary and warlike proceedings, for in that year extraordinarily\r\nbountiful harvests had rewarded their labours, and general prosperity\r\nhad taught them the blessings of peace.[44] After the rebellion of 1715\r\nmany Papists registered their estates and the respective yearly values\r\nthereof, according to an Act of Parliament passed in the reign of George\r\nI., and amongst the number may be observed the names of sundry local\r\npersonages as:—\r\n\r\n                                                            Annual Value.\r\n\r\n  Sherburne, Sir Nicholas, of Carleton, Hambleton, and\r\n                             Stonyhurst                     £1210  6s. 3½d.\r\n\r\n  Butler, Mary,     ⎱  wife and only child of Rich.

Crossing the border, he passed through Lancashire,\r\nand arrived at Preston with an army barely six thousand strong. At\r\nPreston he met with an enthusiastic welcome, the church bells were rung,\r\nand loud cheers greeted the proclamation of his father, the Chevalier,\r\nas king of Great Britain and Ireland. His sojourn in the town was brief,\r\nand on the 27th of November the rebel troops set out for Manchester,\r\ninspirited by the lively strains of “The King shall have his own again.”\r\nArriving at that city, they continued their march towards Derby, where,\r\non receiving the news that the Duke of Cumberland was at Lichfield on his\r\nway to intercept them, Prince Charles Edward hastened to beat a retreat,\r\nand on the 12th of December re-passed through the streets of Preston, the\r\nwearied feet of his followers keeping time to the doleful but appropriate\r\nair of “Hie the Charlie home again.”\r\n\r\nThe battle on the moor of Culloden, in which the rebel army was defeated\r\nby the Duke of Cumberland, finally decided the fate of the House of\r\nStuart, and after experiencing many hardships, Prince Charles Edward\r\nescaped across the channel into France. James, the son of Edward\r\nTyldesley who took part in the insurrection of 1715, served in the army\r\nof the Young Pretender. During the excitement and alarm produced by these\r\nrebellions, silver spoons, tankards, and other household treasures,\r\nwere deposited for safety in a farm house at Marton; cattle and other\r\nfarm-stock were driven to Boonley, near Blackpool, whilst money and\r\narticles of jewelry were buried in the soil of Hound Hill in that town.\r\nThe Scots who accompanied Prince Charles were so renowned for their\r\nvoracious appetites that the householders of the Fylde prepared for their\r\nexpected visit by laying in an abundant supply of eatables, hoping that\r\na good repast, like a soft answer, would turn away wrath. Mr. Physic, of\r\nPoulton, was an exception to the general rule, and having barricaded his\r\nhouse, determined vigorously to resist any attack of the rebels either\r\non his larder or his purse. Hotly pursued by the Duke of Cumberland in\r\ntheir retreat towards Scotland, the insurgents were quickly hurried\r\nthrough the country, but some of the stragglers found their way to Mains\r\nHall, where they were liberally provided with food by Mrs. Hesketh. It\r\nis probable that these rebels formed part of the number of Highlanders,\r\nwho were afterwards captured at Garstang, and that one of them was the\r\nbare-footed Scot who seized the boots of John Miller, of Layton, dragging\r\nthem from his feet with the cool remark—“Hout mon, but I mon tak’ thy\r\nbrogues.” William Hesketh, of Mains, had considered it prudent to secrete\r\nhimself on the warren at Rossall until the excitement had subsided, as\r\nin some way or other he had been mixed up with the former outbreak, and\r\nwished to avoid any suspicion of having been implicated in this one\r\nalso. At the sanguinary and decisive battle of Culloden, two notorious\r\ncharacters from Layton and Staining were present; one of them, named\r\nLeonard Warbreck, served in the capacity of hangman at the executions\r\nfollowing the rebellion, whilst the other, James Kirkham, generally known\r\nas Black Kirkham, was a gallant soldier, remarkable for his giant-like\r\nsize and immense strength. The country people near his home were wont\r\nto declare that, for a small wager, this warrior carried his horse and\r\naccoutrements round the cross at Wigan to the astonishment and admiration\r\nof the by-standers. One incident of these times, reflecting little credit\r\non this neighbourhood, but which, as faithful recorders, we are bound\r\nto relate, was the journey of Henry Hardicar, of Little Poulton, to\r\nLondon, a distance of two hundred and thirty-three miles, all of which\r\nhe travelled on foot, solely to gratify a morbid taste by witnessing the\r\nlegal tragedies performed on Tower Hill. “I saw the lords heided” was his\r\ninvariable answer to all inquiries as to the wonders he had seen in the\r\nmetropolis. In this rising, as in the earlier one, the inhabitants of\r\nthe Fylde evinced their prudence and good sense by remaining as nearly\r\nneutral as their allegiance to the reigning monarch would permit them.\r\nThose insurgents who found their way into the district were treated\r\nwith kindness, but no encouragement was given them to prolong their\r\nstay, either by professions of sympathy or offers of assistance in their\r\ninsurrectionary enterprise.\r\n\r\nWe have at last come to the end of the long chain of wars and\r\ndisturbances which from the period of the struggles between the Houses\r\nof York and Lancaster, had exercised their baneful influence on the\r\nterritory and population of the Fylde, and are now entering on an era of\r\npeace and unbroken prosperity. The small water-side hamlets of Blackpool\r\nand Lytham put forth their rival claims to the patronage of the inland\r\nresidents,—\r\n\r\n  “And had their claims allow’d.”\r\n\r\nIn 1788, Mr. Hutton described the former place as consisting of about\r\nfifty houses and containing four hundred visitors in the height of\r\nthe season. This historian also informs us, that the inhabitants were\r\nremarkable for their great longevity, and relates the anecdote of a woman\r\nwho, forming one of a group of sympathising friends around the couch\r\nof a dying man, exclaimed—“Poor John! I knew him a clever young fellow\r\nfour score years ago.” Lytham, also, attracted a considerable number of\r\nvisitors during the summer, and for many years was a more popular resort\r\nthan Blackpool. In Mr. Baines’s account of Lytham, published in 1825, we\r\nread as follows:—“This is one of the most popular sea-bathing places in\r\nthe county of Lancashire; and if the company is less fashionable than at\r\nBlackpool, it is generally more numerous, and usually very respectable.”\r\n\r\nA list of the Catholic Chapels and Chaplains, together with the number of\r\ntheir respective congregations, in the county of Lancaster, was collected\r\nin 1819, and subjoined are enumerated those situated in the Hundred of\r\nAmounderness:—\r\n\r\n    Place.

The rapidity of its early growth may be inferred from\r\nthe following paragraph, extracted from a volume on Lancashire, published\r\nduring the infancy of this new offspring of the Fylde:—“As a bathing\r\nplace, it possesses very superior attractions: hot water baths, inns, and\r\nhabitations of all kinds have sprung as if by magic on one of the most\r\nagreeable sites it is possible to imagine, very superior to any other\r\nin Lancashire, admitting, as from a central point, excursions by land\r\nand water in all directions, amongst some of the most beautiful scenery\r\nin the empire. A couple of hours steaming takes the tourist across\r\nMorecambe Bay to the Furness capital, and into the heart of a district of\r\nsurpassing interest. Charming indeed is Fleetwood in the height of the\r\nsummer, with its cool sands, northern aspect, and delightful prospects.\r\nFirst there is a noble bay in front, an ocean of itself when the tide is\r\nin; and when it is out offering firm sands of vast extent, for riding\r\nor walking.” Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, bart., of Rossall Hall, lord\r\nof the manor, and founder of the town to which he gave his name, was\r\nreturned on four occasions as one of the parliamentary representatives of\r\nPreston:—\r\n\r\n  MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FOR PRESTON.\r\n\r\n  1832.—Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, and the Hon. Henry Thos. Stanley.\r\n  1835.—Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, and the Hon. Henry Thos. Stanley.\r\n  1837.—Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, and Robert Townley Parker.\r\n  1841.—Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, Bart., and Sir Geo. Strickland, Bart.\r\n\r\nThe year 1840 was an auspicious one in the history of the Fylde. On the\r\n25th of July, the Preston and Wyre Railway, running through the heart of\r\nthis district, was completed and declared open for traffic. By its means\r\nthe farmer became enabled to convey his produce to the extensive market\r\nof Preston; and Kirkham, Poulton, and Garstang were no longer the only\r\ntowns accessible to our agriculturists for the sale of their crops. The\r\nearly appreciation of the utility and benefit of the line is apparent\r\nfrom the rapid increase of its traffic, as shown by the annexed tables,\r\nin which the official returns of passengers and goods for the week ending\r\nDec. 14th, 1842, and the corresponding weeks of the four succeeding years\r\nare stated:—\r\n\r\n  Week ending Dec. 14th, 1842.    911 Passengers.    £65 10s. 5d.\r\n                                      Goods.          62  8   1\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n                                                     127 18   6\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n\r\n  Corresponding week in 1843.    1105 Passengers.     88  1   6\r\n                                      Goods.         140 11   9\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n                                                     228 13   3\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n\r\n  Corresponding week in 1844.    1601 Passengers.    139  4   6\r\n                                      Goods.         163 18  11\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n                                                     303  3   5\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n\r\n  Corresponding week in 1845.    1997 Passengers.    144 12   1\r\n                                      Goods.         234 13   4\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n                                                     379  5   5\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n\r\n  Corresponding week in 1846.    2820 Passengers.    243 19   0\r\n                                      Goods.         308 18   5\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n                                                     552 17   5\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n\r\nAt the present date, 1876, the average weekly traffic on this railway and\r\nits branches to Lytham and Blackpool, amounts in round numbers to £1,200\r\nfor passengers, and £800 for goods.\r\n\r\nThe Preston and Wyre Railway was amongst the earliest formed, and the\r\nimpression made on the natives of this district, who had been accustomed\r\nto the slow-going coaches, must have been one of no little amazement,\r\nwhen, for the first time, they beheld the “iron horse” steaming along\r\nthe rails at a speed which their past experience of travelling would\r\nmake them regard as impossible. The following lines were written by a\r\ngentleman named Henry Anderton, a resident in the Fylde, on the opening\r\nof the railway:\r\n\r\n  “Some fifty years since and a coach had no power,\r\n  To move faster forward than six miles an hour,\r\n  Till Sawney McAdam made highways as good,\r\n  As paving-stones crushed into little bits could.\r\n  The coachee quite proud of his horse-flesh and trip,\r\n  Cried, ‘Go it, ye cripples!’ and gave them the whip,\r\n  And ten miles an hour, by the help of the thong,\r\n  They put forth their mettle and scampered along.\r\n  The Present has taken great strides of the Past,\r\n  For carriages run without horses at last!\r\n  And what is more strange,—yet it’s truth I avow,\r\n  Hack-horses themselves have turned passengers now!\r\n  These coaches alive go in sixes and twelves,\r\n  And once set in motion they travel themselves!\r\n  They’ll run thirty miles while I’m cracking this joke,\r\n  And need no provisions but pump-milk and coke!\r\n  And with their long chimneys they skim o’er the rails,\r\n  With two thousand hundred-weight tied to their tails!\r\n  While Jarvey in stupid astonishment stands,\r\n  Upturning both eyes and uplifting both hands,\r\n  ‘My nags,’ he exclaims, betwixt laughing and crying,\r\n  ‘Are good ’uns to go, but yon devils are flying.’”\r\n\r\nThe fares on the Preston and Wyre Railway at its commencement were:—\r\n\r\n                                     1st class. 2nd class. 3rd class.\r\n\r\n  Preston to Fleetwood or Blackpool    4s. 6d.    3s. 0d.    2s. 0d.\r\n  Preston to Poulton                   3s. 6d.    2s. 6d.    1s. 6d.\r\n  Preston to Kirkham                   2s. 0d.    1s. 3d.    0s. 9d.\r\n  Preston to Lytham                    3s. 0d.    2s. 6d.    1s. 6d.\r\n\r\nUntil the opening of the branch lines to Lytham and Blackpool\r\nrespectively, in 1846, passengers completed their journies from Kirkham\r\nand Poulton to those watering places by means of coaches. Three trains\r\nran from the terminus at Fleetwood to Preston on each week-day, and one\r\non Sunday, a similar number returning.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the severe distress prevailing throughout the country,\r\na proclamation was issued by Her Majesty for a General Fast to be held on\r\nWednesday, the 24th of March, 1847; and from the public prints of that\r\ndate it is evident that the occasion was observed with great solemnity\r\nin our division—the shops of the different towns were closed during the\r\nwhole of the day, the streets were quiet, the hotels deserted, whilst\r\nthe churches were crowded even to overflowing. This distress was caused\r\nby an almost complete failure in the potatoe harvests; and at that time\r\nthese necessary articles of diet were sold at 26s. per load in the local\r\nmarkets, whilst meal, also scarce, rose to 52s. per load.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year, the Fylde was honoured by a passing visit\r\nfrom Queen Victoria and the late Prince Consort, who arrived at Fleetwood\r\nin the Royal Yacht on their return journey from Scotland to London. An\r\naddress was presented by Sir P. H. Fleetwood, bart., the Rev. St. Vincent\r\nBeechey, Frederick Kemp, esq., James Crombleholme, esq., and Daniel\r\nElletson, esq., on behalf of the inhabitants of Fleetwood, and received\r\nby Lord Palmerston, who promised that it should be laid before the\r\nQueen. In the course of a few days an acknowledgment was received from\r\nthe metropolis. In Her Majesty’s book, published in 1868, and entitled\r\n“Leaves from our Highland Journal,” these diarian entries relating to\r\nthe above event appear:—\r\n\r\n                                    “Monday, September 20th, 1847.\r\n\r\n  “We anchored at seven in Fleetwood Harbour; the entrance was\r\n  extremely narrow and difficult. We were lashed close to the pier,\r\n  to prevent our being turned by the tide; and when I went on\r\n  deck there was a great commotion, such running and calling, and\r\n  pulling of ropes, etc. It was a cheerless evening, blowing hard.”\r\n\r\n                                    “Tuesday, September 21st, 1847.\r\n\r\n  “At ten o’clock we landed, and proceeded by rail to London.”\r\n\r\nIn 1860, a project was launched for a comprehensive scheme of water\r\nsupply for the towns of this district; a company was established, and, in\r\nthe session of 1861, an act of parliament was obtained “for incorporating\r\nthe Fylde Waterworks Company, and for authorising them to make and\r\nmaintain waterworks, and to supply water at Kirkham, Lytham, Blackpool,\r\nFleetwood, Poulton, Rossall, Garstang, South-shore, and Bispham, in the\r\ncounty palatine of Lancaster, and to shipping at Fleetwood and Lytham.”\r\nThe act granted power to take the water from Grizedale Brook, a tributary\r\nof the Wyre, which rises in Grizedale Fell, one of the Bleasdale range,\r\nand, flowing through the gorge or pass, called Nickey Nook, divides\r\nthe township of Nether-Wyersdale and Barnacre-with-Bonds, and falls\r\ninto the Wyre a mile or so before that river reaches Garstang. A dam\r\nor embankment, upwards of 20 feet high, 70 feet wide at the base, and\r\n12 feet wide at the top, was raised across the valley, converting the\r\nupper portion of it into a reservoir. At the west end of the reservoir,\r\nbelow the embankment, is a culvert, through which the water passes to\r\na guage, where a stipulated quantity is turned into the brook, and the\r\nrest enters the pipe for the Fylde. Twelve miles of twelve inch pipes\r\ncarry the water to the service reservoir at Weeton. The course is down\r\nGrizedale, under the railway, through Greenhalgh Green, Bowgrave, leaving\r\nGarstang to the right, then past Catterall Mill, through the grounds of\r\nCatterall Hall, and onward to the east of St. Michael’s, through Elswick,\r\nto Weeton. The service reservoir, situated on the most elevated ground,\r\ncalled Whitprick Hill, in the township of Weeton, has a diameter at the\r\nbase of 400 feet, and at the top 468 feet. The embankment is at the base\r\n70 feet in diameter, and 12 feet at the top, with a puddle trench in it,\r\nvarying from 8 feet 8 inches to 6 feet wide. To the south a 10 inch main\r\ntakes the supply of water for Kirkham and Lytham; and from the west\r\nside a main of similar size takes the water for Fleetwood and Blackpool,\r\nthe supply for the former place branching off near Great Marton, and\r\ngoing by Bispham and Rossall. The Weeton reservoir was formed capable\r\nof containing fifteen million gallons of water. An additional pipe,\r\nrunning from Weeton through Singleton, Skippool, and Thornton, to join\r\nthe Fleetwood main at Flakefleet, near Rossall, was laid in 1875; and a\r\nnew reservoir, to hold 190,000,000 gallons, is in course of formation at\r\nBarnacre, above Grizedale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONDITION, CUSTOMS, AND SUPERSTITIONS OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is little to be remarked, because little is known, respecting\r\nthe social and moral aspects of the untutored race which, in the\r\nearliest historic age, sought a domicile or refuge amidst the forests\r\nof the Fylde, or invaded its glades in search of prey. The habits of\r\nthe Setantii were simply those of other savage tribes who depended for\r\ntheir daily sustenance upon their skill and prowess in the chase, and\r\nwhose intercommunion with the world beyond their own limited domains,\r\nwas confined to hostile or friendly meetings with equally barbarous\r\nraces whose frontiers adjoined their own. Certain disinterred roots were\r\nnecessary adjuncts to their repasts, and indeed, on many occasions, when\r\noutwitted by the wild tenants of the woods, formed the sole item. Their\r\nDruidical faith and the supreme power of the priesthood over their almost\r\nevery action, both secular and religious, have already been referred to\r\nin an earlier page. The remorseless sacrifice of fellow beings on their\r\nunhallowed altars, and the general spirit of cruelty and inhumanity\r\nwhich pervaded all their rites, are not to be regarded as disclosing a\r\nnaturally callous and brutal disposition on the part of the Setantii, but\r\nas indications of the deplorable ignorance in which they existed, and\r\nthe blind obedience which they yielded to the principles indoctrinated\r\nby the Druids. That the Setantii, however submissive to the dictates\r\nand requirements of their priests, were far from passively allowing the\r\nencroachments of others on their liberties is shown by the promptitude\r\nand fierceness with which they combatted the progress of the Roman\r\nlegions through their territory. No portion of the British conquest\r\ncost the conquerors more trouble, time, and bloodshed, than did the land\r\npeopled by the hardy and valorous Brigantes with their comparatively\r\nsmall, but equally intrepid, neighbours and allies the Setantii. The two\r\nmost striking characteristics of the aboriginal Fylde inhabitants were\r\ntheir ignorance and bravery, and whilst the former rivetted the chains\r\nwhich held them in subjection to the priesthood, the latter incited them\r\nto oppose to the death the usurpations of the stranger. There is nothing\r\nof local interest to recount during the period the Romans held the\r\nsoil, but after their abdication, when the Anglo-Saxons violated their\r\nfaith and traitorously seized a land which they had come professedly\r\nto protect, the Fylde began to evince symptoms of greater animation;\r\nvillages sprang up in different spots on the open grounds or clearings\r\nin the woods; the solitary Roman settlement at Kirkham was appropriated\r\nand renamed by the new arrivals, and, perhaps, for the first time a\r\npopulation of numerical importance was established in the district.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of this era the inhabitants were graziers rather\r\nthan agriculturists or ploughmen. Three quarters, even, of the entire\r\nkingdom were devoted to rearing and feeding cattle, so that the grain\r\nproduce of the country must have been extremely small when compared\r\nwith the superabundance of live stock, and as a consequence of such a\r\ncondition of things, those animals which could forage for themselves\r\nand exist upon the wild herbage of the waste lands or the fallen\r\nfruits of the trees, as acorns and beech-mast, were to be purchased\r\nat prices almost nominal, whilst others which required the cultivated\r\nproducts of the fields, as corn and hay, for their sustenance, were\r\ndisproportionately dear; thus about the end of the tenth century the\r\nvalues of the former were:—\r\n\r\n  One Ox                   7s.  0½d.\r\n   ”  Cow                  5s.  6d.\r\n   ”  Pig                  1s. 10½d.\r\n   ”  Sheep                1s.  2d.\r\n   ”  Goat                 0s.  5½d.\r\n\r\nThe latter commanded these comparatively high prices—\r\n\r\n  One Horse            £1  5s.  2d.\r\n   ”  Mare, or Colt    £1  3s.  5d.\r\n   ”  Ass, or Mule     £0 14s.  1d.\r\n\r\nTrees were valued not by the circumference or magnitude of their trunks,\r\nbut by the amount of shelter their branches would afford to the cattle,\r\nwhich seem to have lived almost entirely in the open pastures; and\r\nbearing that in mind we are not surprised to read in the Saxon Chronicle\r\nof periodical plagues or murrains breaking out amongst them. “In 1054,”\r\nsays that journal, “there was so great loss of cattle as was not\r\nremembered for many winters before.” This, however, is only one extract\r\nfrom frequent entries referring to similar misfortunes in different\r\nyears, both before and after the date quoted. Swine were kept in immense\r\nherds throughout the kingdom, and there is every probability that in a\r\nlocality like the Fylde, where trees would still abound and provender\r\nbe plentifully scattered from the oaks and beeches, hogs would be\r\nextensively bred. Indeed immediately after the close of the Saxon empire,\r\nRoger de Poictou conveyed his newly acquired right to pawnage (swine’s\r\nfood) in the woods of Poulton, amongst other things, to the monastery\r\nof St. Mary, in Lancaster, a circumstance strongly favourable to the\r\nexistence of swine there in considerable numbers. Kine, also, are usually\r\nreported to have been a favourite stock with the breeders of Lancashire,\r\nwhilst sheep were rare in proportion, although in other places they were\r\nexceedingly popular and profitable, chiefly from the sale of their wool.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon inhabitants of the small villages in the Fylde who were\r\nengaged in agriculture had no knowledge of any manure beyond marl, which\r\nthey mixed with lighter and finer soils; nor were their farm-lands\r\ncultivated all at one time, but a portion only of the estate was\r\nsubjected to the action of the plough, and when its fertility had been\r\nthoroughly exhausted, the remainder was tilled and brought into service,\r\nthe first plot being allowed to lie fallow for a few years until its\r\nproductive powers had been renewed. Grain was not, as now, purchased\r\nfrom the growers by dealers and stored up in warehouses, but each of\r\nthe neighbouring people, as soon as the crops had been gathered into\r\nthe barns, bought whatever quantity he thought would suffice for his\r\nhousehold wants until the ensuing harvest, and removed it to his own\r\nresidence. The universal waste and improvident consumption of grain\r\nduring this season of abundance, led frequently to famines in other\r\nparts of the year, and many instances of that punishment following such\r\nprodigality are related in the chronicle before named. One notice,\r\nbearing the date 1044, says:—“This year there was very great hunger all\r\nover England, and corn so dear as no man ever remembered before; so that\r\na sester of wheat rose to sixty pence and even further.”\r\n\r\nThe ploughs of our forefathers were, as would naturally be supposed,\r\nsomewhat rude and clumsy in construction, differing considerably in\r\nappearance, although not in their _modus operandi_, from those which\r\nmay be seen furrowing the same land in the present day. Each plough\r\nwas furnished with an iron share, in front of which, attached to the\r\nextremity of a beam projecting anteriorly, was a wheel of moderate\r\ndiameter, its purpose being to relieve the labour of the oxen and to\r\nfacilitate the guiding of the instrument, especially in turning. The\r\noxen employed were ordinarily four, and yoked to the plough by means of\r\ntwisted willow bands. Horses were prohibited by law from being used on\r\nthe land, but there must have been little need, one would imagine, for a\r\nlegal prohibition in the matter when it is remembered that horses were\r\nnearly four times as valuable as oxen, and that the latter were fully\r\nefficient at the task. The month of January commenced their season for\r\npreparing the ground, and during the period thus occupied the labours\r\nof the ploughman began each morning at sunrise, when the oxen were\r\ntethered and conducted to the fields, where the duty of the husbandman\r\nwas lightened by the assistance of a boy, who superintended the cattle,\r\ndriving or leading them whilst at work. In the inclement months of\r\nwinter these oxen were fed and tended in sheds under the special care\r\nof the ploughman, but during summer they shared a common lot with\r\nthe other cattle and were turned out to pasture in the fields, being\r\ntransferred to the charge of the cowherd. Other implements of husbandry\r\nin use, in addition to the plough, were scythes, sickles, axes, spades,\r\npruning-hooks, forks, and flails, besides which the farmers possessed\r\ncarts and waggons of rather a cumbersome pattern. It is doubtful whether\r\nthe harrow was known here so early, but opinion usually refers its\r\nintroduction to a later date.\r\n\r\nOf the moral tone of our Saxon settlers it is difficult to judge,\r\nbut that their business transactions were not always governed by a\r\nvery strict sense of honour is intimated by the following enactment,\r\napparently framed to check repudiations of bargains and, perhaps, to\r\ninsure fair dealing:—“No one shall buy either what is living or what\r\nis dead to the value of four pennies without four witnesses either of\r\nthe borough or of the village.” William of Malmesbury, who wrote about\r\na century after the Norman Conquest, informs us that “excessive eating\r\nand drinking were the common vices of the Saxons, in which they spent\r\nwhole nights and days without intermission.” It may, however, with much\r\nprobability be conjectured that not only is the statement in some degree\r\nexaggerated, but that its application was designed more particularly for\r\nthe inhabitants of the larger towns than those of comparatively sparsely\r\npopulated districts like our own. Nevertheless it cannot be claimed, with\r\nany show of reason, that the small section of the nation established\r\nin the Fylde was entirely uninfected by the vices which enervated and\r\ndegraded the wealthier and more populous regions of the kingdom. The\r\nevil of intemperance in both food and drink, especially the latter,\r\npervaded the whole community, but as its indulgence required both means\r\nand opportunity, its loathsome features were less prominently visible in\r\nlocalities where these were scarce than in others where they abounded.\r\nThe Church used every effort to awaken a better feeling in the minds\r\nof her degenerate sons, and liberate them from the chains of a passion\r\nwhich had so thoroughly enslaved them. Canons were directed against the\r\n“sin of drunkenness,” and in order that no plea of ignorance could be\r\nurged by any who had overstepped the bounds of sobriety, a curious and\r\nminute description of the condition of body and brain which constituted\r\ninebriation was appended to one of them, as here quoted:—“This is\r\ndrunkenness—when the state of the mind is changed, the tongue stammers,\r\nthe eyes are disturbed, the head is giddy, the belly is swelled, and pain\r\nfollows.” Ale and mead were the beverages on which these excesses were\r\ncommitted, and cow-horns the drinking cups. It would seem that there was\r\nyet another national blemish, that of gambling, which even invaded the\r\ncloister and threw its veil of fascination over the clergy themselves,\r\nfor a canon of the reign of Edgar ordered—“That no priest be a hunter, or\r\nfowler, or player at tables, but let him play upon his books, as becometh\r\nhis calling.”\r\n\r\nWater-mills, planted on the banks of streams and consisting of square\r\nweather-boarded structures, usually open at the top, were the means\r\npossessed during the Saxon era for grinding the cereal products of the\r\nFylde. The wheel which received the pressure of the current, and conveyed\r\nits motive power to the simple machinery within the fabric, differed\r\nlittle from those still in use in various parts of the country, one of\r\nwhich until recently was connected with a small mill on the brink of\r\nthe brook which drains the mere at Marton into the river Wyre, and less\r\nthan a century ago another mill, situated in the township of Marton and\r\nworked on a similar principle, was turned by a stream from the same\r\nmere. A water-mill is at present in use near Great Eccleston. After the\r\ngrinding process had been completed the bran and flour were separated\r\nby hand-sieves. About seventy or eighty years after the Normans had\r\nsettled in the district these primitive sheds were superseded by a fresh\r\nspecies of mill, in which sails supplied the place of the wheel, and\r\nanother element was called into service. The new erections were of wood,\r\nand separated from the ground by a pivot of slight altitude, on which\r\nthey turned bodily in order to be fixed in the most favourable position\r\nfor their sails to reap a full harvest of wind. Solitary specimens of\r\nthis early piece of mechanical ingenuity are still visible hereabouts,\r\nbut most of the old mills were pulled down about a hundred years ago,\r\nor less, and rebuilt with more stable material, whilst the modern\r\nimprovement of a revolving top only, did away with the necessity for the\r\nvenerable pivot, and allowed the foundations of the edifices to be more\r\nintimately associated with mother earth than formerly.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the Saxon dynasty the mass of the inhabitants\r\nwould be what were termed the “villani,” that is, a class forming a\r\nlink between abject slavery and perfect independence. They were not\r\nbound to any master but to the soil on which they happened to be\r\nborn, and on no plea were they permitted to leave such localities. To\r\nthe lord of the manor each of the “villani” gave annually a certain\r\nportion of the produce of the ground he tilled, but beyond that they\r\nacknowledged no claim to the proceeds of their thrift by the large\r\nterritorial proprietors. When a manor changed ownership the “villani”\r\nwere transferred with it in exactly the same condition as before, so that\r\nreally they seem to have occupied the position of small tenants paying\r\nrent in kind, with the important addition that they were forced to pass\r\ntheir lives in the district where they had first seen the light of day.\r\nIt should be noted that any “villani” not having domiciles of their own\r\nwere compelled to enter the service of others who were more fortunately\r\nsituated in that respect.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelfth century the house-wife’s plan of preparing bread\r\nfor the table, in the absence of public bakehouses, common in some\r\nneighbourhoods, was to knead the dough into large flat cakes and lay them\r\non the hearth in full glare of the fire, where they were permitted to\r\nremain until thoroughly baked. Bread from pure wheat of the best quality\r\nwas a luxury unattainable except by those of high station or wealth,\r\nthe bulk of the people having to content themselves with an inferior\r\nquality, brownish in colour and made from rye, oats, and barley. The\r\namount of this indispensable commodity to be sold at a specified price\r\nwas regulated by law, and the punishments for not supplying the proper\r\nmeasure, or for “lack of size” as it was termed, were—for the first\r\noffence, loss of the bread; for the second, imprisonment; and for the\r\nthird, the pillory or tumbrel.[46] In 1185 the maximum charges to be made\r\nfor certain provisions were settled by an act which decreed that the\r\nhighest price for a hen should be ½d., a sheep 5½d., a ram 8d., a hog\r\n1s., an ox 5s. 8d., and a cow 4s. 6d.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing century no restrictions were placed upon the tenants\r\nof the Fylde as to the course of husbandry to be pursued, but each on\r\nrenting his farm or parcel of ground cultivated it according to the\r\ndictates of his own inclination or experience, the only stipulation\r\nbeing that the soil should suffer no deterioration from any ignorant or\r\nimprudent action on the part of the holder. Oats and barley mixed, and\r\na light description of wheat, very inferior to the best grain, were the\r\nfavourite crops, the former being known as “draget,” and the latter as\r\n“siligo.” Arable land was let at 4d. per acre, and the annual yield of\r\neach acre sown with wheat, usually amounted to 12 bushels, the value of\r\nthe grain itself averaging about 4s. 6d. per quarter. Demand notices were\r\nsent in two days after the rent had become due, and if not complied with\r\nin two weeks the landlord distrained without further ceremony; after an\r\ninterval of another fortnight, if the money still remained unpaid, the\r\ntenant was summarily ejected, and the owner seized both farm and stock.\r\n\r\nThe meals consumed by the peasantry comprised only two during the\r\ntwenty-four hours, one, called dinner, being eaten at nine in the\r\nmorning, and the other, supper, at five in the afternoon. It is very\r\npossible, however, that during the summer those farm servants whose\r\narduous duties were entered on at daybreak, partook of some slight repast\r\nat an early hour of the morning, but the only meals for which regular\r\ntimes were appointed were the two mentioned. During harvest the diet\r\nof the labourers consisted for the most part of herrings, bread, and\r\nan allowance of beer, whilst messes of pottage were far from uncommon\r\nobjects on the rustic boards. Between the year 1314 and 1326 the prices\r\nof live stock were again arranged, as under:—\r\n\r\n  The best grass fed ox            16s. 0d.\r\n  The best cow (fat)               12s. 0d.\r\n  The best short-horn sheep         1s. 2d.\r\n  The best goose                    0s. 3d.\r\n  The best hen                      0s. 1½d.\r\n  The best chickens, per couple     0s. 1½d.\r\n  Eggs, twenty for                  0s. 1d.\r\n\r\nIn 1338 no domestic or husbandry servant residing in the Hundred of\r\nAmounderness was allowed to pass beyond the boundaries of the Wapentake\r\non profession of going to dwell or serve elsewhere, or of setting out\r\non a pilgrimage, without bearing with him a letter patent stating the\r\nreason of his departure and the date of his return. This law, which\r\napplied to all Hundreds alike, was intended to prevent the threatened\r\ndecay of agriculture from a dearth of labourers, who heretofore had been\r\nin the habit of deserting their employment and wandering away into other\r\ndivisions of the country, where they supported an idle and frequently\r\nvicious existence by soliciting alms and by petty thefts.\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely surprise the reader to learn that superstition was rife\r\namongst the populace during the periods so far noticed, and that nothing\r\nwas too absurd to be accepted as an omen, either of good or evil, by our\r\ncredulous forefathers. A timid hare encountered in their walks abroad\r\nannounced the approach of some unforeseen calamity, as also did a blind\r\nor lame man, a woman with dishevelled hair, or even a monk; whilst the\r\nvisions of a wolf crossing the path, St. Martin’s birds flying from\r\nleft to right, a humpbacked man, or the sound of distant thunder, were\r\nwelcomed as heralds of prosperity. All amusements were of an athletic\r\nkind, and consisted of archery, casting heavy stones, spear darting,\r\nwrestling, running, leaping, and sword and buckler playing. On festivals,\r\nand occasionally at other seasons, the barbarous and cruel sports of bull\r\nand bear-baiting were indulged in,[47] but cock-fighting was considered,\r\nuntil a later epoch, an entertainment only suitable for children, and on\r\nShrove Tuesday each boy took his pet bird to the school-house, which was\r\nfor that day converted into a cock-pit, superintended by the master.\r\n\r\nIn 1444, the wages received by different classes of agricultural servants\r\nwere:—\r\n\r\n  A bailiff           £1  3s. 4d. per year, and 5s. for clothing, with\r\n                                                                  board.\r\n  A chief hind      ⎫\r\n      ”   carter    ⎬ £1  0s. 0d.    ”      and 4s. for clothing,   ”\r\n      ”   shepherd  ⎭\r\n  A woman servant     £0 10s. 0d.    ”      and 4s. for clothing,   ”\r\n  A boy under 14      £0  6s. 0d.    ”      and 3s. for clothing,   ”\r\n  A common husbandman £0 15s. 0d.    ”      and 40d. for clothing,  ”\r\n\r\nAt harvest time, when special labour was required, the scale of\r\nremuneration was:—\r\n\r\n  A mower                              4d. per day, with board.\r\n      ”                                6d.    ”     without ”\r\n  A reaper or carter                   3d.    ”     with    ”\r\n      ”                                5d.    ”     without ”\r\n  A woman labourer, or other labourer  2½d.   ”     with    ”\r\n      ”                                4½d.   ”     without ”\r\n\r\nThe statute which arranged the above rates of payment concluded by saying\r\nthat “such as deserve less shall take less, and also in places where less\r\nis used to be given less shall be given from henceforth;” so that the\r\ntable just completed would seem to represent the maximum rather than the\r\nordinary scale of wages. This statute also enacted that farm servants who\r\npurposed leaving their employers, must engage themselves to other masters\r\nand give reasonable warning before leaving their present ones, by which\r\nidleness and mendicancy were effectually guarded against.\r\n\r\nThe common pastimes of the inhabitants during the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, in addition to some of those already enumerated which still\r\nheld their sway, were club, and trap-ball, bowling, prisoners’-bars,\r\nhood-man blind, (a game similar to the modern blindman’s-buff, but\r\nentered into by adults alone,) battledore and shuttlecock, and during\r\nhard frosts skating, at first by means of the shank bone of a sheep\r\nfastened on to the sole of the boot and afterwards with iron-shod\r\nskates. Hawking and hunting were confined to the families of position\r\nwho resided at the ancient Halls of the Fylde and to others of similar\r\nsocial standing, forming but a small proportion of the entire population.\r\nAt Christmas the largest log obtainable was lighted on the hearth and\r\ndenominated the yule log. If the mass burned throughout the night and\r\nthe whole of the next day, it was regarded as an omen of good fortune by\r\nthe members of the household, but if it were consumed or extinguished\r\nbefore that time had expired, it was looked upon as auguring adversely\r\nfor their prosperity. The first Monday after Twelfth Day was called\r\nPlough Monday, a name still familiar to many an old Fylde man, and was\r\nobserved as a general holiday by the men whose labours were associated\r\nwith that instrument, who on this day went about the villages from house\r\nto house asking for plough-money to spend in ale. Their processions,\r\nif such they could be called, consisted of a plough, which was dragged\r\nalong by a number of sword-dancers; a labourer, dressed to resemble an\r\nold woman; and another, who was clothed in skins, and wore the tail of\r\nsome animal hanging down his back. These two oddly garbed individuals\r\nsolicited small contributions from the people whilst the remainder were\r\nengaged in dancing, and if anyone refused to disburse some trifling sum\r\nwhen requested, they turned up the ground fronting his doorway with\r\nthe plough. During Christmas week the country people blackened their\r\nfaces, and thus disguised committed all sorts of frolics and absurdities\r\namongst their neighbours. The chief rustic festival, however, was\r\nappointed for the first of May, on which day the May-pole was drawn\r\nto the village green by several oxen, whose horns were decorated with\r\nbunches of flowers, and accompanied by a joyous band of revellers, who\r\nafter its erection on the accustomed site held their jubilee of feasting\r\nand dancing around it. The pole itself was covered with floral garlands,\r\nand streamed with flags and handkerchiefs from its summit. A Lord and\r\nLady, or Queen, of May were elected by a general vote, and to them\r\nbelonged the honour of presiding over the festivities. The costumes of\r\nthese pseudo-regal personages were liberally adorned with scarfs and\r\nribbons, so that their appearances should be in unison with the rest of\r\nthe gay preparations. The morris-dance formed an important feature of\r\nthe festival, and the performers in that somewhat vigorous exercise wore\r\nrichly decorated habits on to which small bells, varying in tone, had\r\nbeen fastened. The new year was ushered in with feasting and joviality,\r\nwhilst friendly interchanges of presents took place amongst all classes.\r\nIn the evening, a huge wassail-bowl filled with spiced ale was carried\r\nto the different houses of the villages, and all who quaffed its\r\nexhilarating contents drank prosperity to the coming year, and rewarded\r\nthe cup-bearers, usually female farm-servants, with some small donation;\r\nthe following carol in a more antique form, or some similar one, was sung\r\non the occasion:—\r\n\r\n  “Good Dame, here at your door,\r\n    Our Wassel we begin,\r\n  We are all maidens poor,\r\n    We pray now let us in,\r\n                With our Wassel.\r\n\r\n  “Our Wassel we do fill,\r\n    With apples and with spice,\r\n  Then grant us your good will\r\n    To taste here once or twice\r\n                Of our Wassel.\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  “Some bounty from your hands\r\n    Our Wassel to maintain.\r\n  We’ll buy no house nor lands\r\n    With that which we do gain,\r\n                With our Wassel.”\r\n\r\nOn Shrove Tuesday a barbarous custom prevailed of tying cocks to a stake\r\ndriven into the ground, and throwing at them with sticks, until death\r\nensued from repeated blows. St. Valentine’s day received a merry welcome\r\nfrom the country swains and maidens, who at that auspicious time made\r\nchoice of, or more properly speaking were mated to, their true loves for\r\nthe year. The all important selection was made by writing the names of an\r\nequal number of each sex on separate slips of paper, and then dividing\r\nthem into two lots, one of which represented the males and the other the\r\nfemales. The women drew from the male heap, and the men from that of the\r\nfemales, so that each person became possessed of two sweethearts, and the\r\nfinal pairing was really the only element of real choice in the matter;\r\nin this the men usually claimed the girl whom each of them had drawn,\r\nand thus an amicable settlement was soon arrived at. After the mirthful\r\nceremony had been completed and each happy couple duly united, the men\r\ngave treats and dances to their sweethearts, and wore their billets for\r\nseveral days pinned on to their breasts or coat sleeves. Another, and\r\nmuch simpler, plan of choosing a valentine was to look out of the door or\r\nwindow on the eventful morning, and the first person seen was regarded as\r\nthe special selection of the patron Saint, provided always the individual\r\nwas of the opposite sex, and unfettered by the silken bonds of Hymen.\r\nWhitsun-ales and Easter-ales were assemblies held within, or in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of, the church-yards, at which the beverage,\r\ngiving the title to these festivities, was sold by the clergy or their\r\nassistants, and consumed by the country people, the proceeds being\r\ndevoted to ecclesiastical purposes and the relief of the poor. Wakes\r\noriginated in an ancient custom of gathering together on the evening\r\nbefore the birthday of a Saint or the day appointed for the dedication of\r\na church, and passing the night in devotion and prayer. These watches,\r\nhowever, were soon altered in character, and instead of religious\r\nexercises employing the period of vigil, feasting and debauchery became\r\nthe recognized occupations.\r\n\r\nThe festival of Rush-bearing is of such antiquity that its origin has\r\nbecome in a great measure obscured, but there is a strong probability\r\nthat the practice arose from a recommendation given by Pope Gregory IV.\r\nto Mellitus, who was associated with St. Augustine in christianising\r\nthe inhabitants of England, to celebrate the anniversaries of the\r\ndedications of those places of worship, which they had rescued from Pagan\r\ninfluences, “by building themselves huts of the boughs of trees about\r\nsuch churches, and celebrating the solemnities with religious feastings.”\r\nThe rush-cart, decorated with flowers and ribbons, was paraded through\r\nthe village streets, accompanied by morris-dancers and others bearing\r\nflags or banners. One of the mummers, dressed in a motley suit, somewhat\r\nresembling that of a circus jester, jingled a horse-collar hung with\r\nbells, and kept up a constant succession of small jokes at the expense\r\nof the bystanders as the procession advanced. In early days before\r\nchurches were flagged it was the annual custom to strew their floors with\r\nrushes on the day of the dedication of the sacred edifice, and in the\r\nparish register of Kirkham we find, as follows:—“1604. Rushes to strew\r\nthe church cost this year 9s. 6d.” From the register at Poulton church\r\nwe have also extracted an entry, at random, from similar ones occurring\r\neach year:—“Aug. 6th, 1784. To Edward Whiteside for rushes, 6s. 8d.” The\r\npractice appears to have arisen simply from a desire to promote warmth\r\nand comfort within the churches by providing a covering for the bare\r\nearth, and its connection with rush-bearing, when it existed, must be\r\nregarded as having been purely accidental. Brand has discovered another\r\nmotive for rush-strewing, more especially in private houses, and one\r\nnot very flattering to our forefathers:—“As our ancestors,” writes he,\r\n“rarely washed their floors, disguises of uncleanliness became very\r\nnecessary.” Erasmus, also, a Greek Professor at Oxford in the time of\r\nHenry VIII., in describing the hovels in which the agricultural labourers\r\nand others of the lower classes lived, says:—“The floors are commonly\r\nof clay strewed with rushes; under which lies unmolested an ancient\r\ncollection of beer, grease, fragments, bones, spittle, and everything\r\nthat is nasty.”\r\n\r\nFrom 1589 to 1590 inclusive, the daily wages, without board, of a\r\nditcher were 4d., a thresher 6d., a hedger 4d., a gardener 10d., and a\r\nmaster-mason 14d. In 1533 it was enacted that no tenant should hold more\r\nthan two farms at once; and fifty-five years later sundry penalties were\r\nimposed upon any one erecting cottages for the agricultural population\r\nwithout attaching four acres of land to each, also for allowing more than\r\none family to occupy a cottage at the same time.[48] A law was passed\r\nin 1597, directing that all houses of husbandry which had fallen into\r\ndecay within a period of seven years should be rebuilt, and from twenty\r\nto forty acres of ground apportioned to each.[49] The average yields of\r\ngrain per acre on well-cultivated soils during the latter half of the\r\nsixteenth century were—wheat 20 bushels, barley 32 bushels, and oats 40\r\nbushels. The subjoined tables contain the average prices of some of the\r\ncommon articles of consumption:—\r\n\r\n                    In 1500.    In 1541.    In 1590.   In 1597.\r\n  12 Pigeons             4d.    0s. 10d.    1s. 0d.    4s. 3d.\r\n  100 Eggs               7d.    1s.  6d.               3s. 6d.\r\n  1 Goose                4d.    0s.  8d.\r\n  1 Chicken              1d.                           0s. 8d.\r\n  1 Lb. of Butter               0s.  3d.    0s. 4d.\r\n\r\nIn 1581, the charge for shoeing a horse was 10d., and sometimes 12d. Here\r\nit may be noticed, although perhaps rather digressive, that the herb\r\ntobacco was introduced into this country sometime during the summer of\r\n1586, by a party of Englishmen, who for a short time colonised the island\r\nof Roanoak, near the coast of Virginia, but, having quarrelled with the\r\naborigines, were removed home in the ships of Sir Francis Drake. Camden,\r\nwriting of these men, says:—“They were the first that I know of that\r\nbrought into England that Indian plant which they called _tabacca_ and\r\n_nicotia_, or _tobacco_, which they used against crudities, being taught\r\nit by the Indians. Certainly, from that time forward, it began to grow\r\ninto great request, and to be sold at a high rate; whilst in a short time\r\nmany men, everywhere, some for wantonness, some for health sake, with\r\ninsatiable desires and greediness, sucked in the stinking smoke thereof\r\nthrough an earthen pipe, which presently they blew out again at their\r\nnostrils; insomuch that tobacco-shops are now as ordinary in most towns\r\nas tap-houses and taverns.”\r\n\r\nThe following rhymes, descriptive of the games and recreations common\r\nin Lancashire amongst the youth of both sexes, were written in 1600, by\r\nSamuel Rowland:—\r\n\r\n  “Any they dare challenge for to throw the sledge,\r\n  To jump or leap over ditch or hedge;\r\n  To wrestle, play at stool-ball, or to run,\r\n  To pitch the bar or to shoot off a gun;\r\n  To play at loggats, nine-holes, or ten-pins,\r\n  To try it out at foot-ball by the shins;\r\n  At tick-tacke, seize-noddy, maw, and ruff;\r\n  At hot-cockles, leap-frog, or blindman’s buff;\r\n  To drink the halper-pots, or deal at the whole can;\r\n  To play at chess, or pue, and inkhorn;\r\n  To dance the morris, play at barley-brake;\r\n  At all exploits a man can think or speak:\r\n  At shove-groat, venter-point, or cross and pile;\r\n  At ‘beshrew him that’s last at any style’;\r\n  At leaping over a Christmas bonfire,\r\n  Or at ‘drawing the dame out of the mire’;\r\n  At shoot-cock, Gregory, stool-ball, and what-not;\r\n  Pick-point, top and scourge, to make him hot.”\r\n\r\nMany of these games have long since become obsolete. Tick-tacke resembled\r\nbackgammon, but was rather more complicated; seize-noddy, maw, and ruff\r\nwere games of cards, the first being somewhat similar to cribbage, while\r\nthe two latter have no modern representatives, although the expression\r\n_to ruff_ is frequently used at the whist-table; ‘cross and pile’ is\r\nmerely an earlier name of ‘pitch and toss’; and shoot-cock has been\r\nmodernised into shuttlecock.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth century occasional village fairs were held in the\r\nFylde, at which such uncouth games as “grinning through a horse-collar,”\r\nas well as trials in whistling, etc., were common amusements, while\r\npedlars’ stalls, puppet shows, raffling tables, and drinking booths were\r\nwell attended by the holidaymakers. At that period any damsel, wishing to\r\nlearn something, be it ever so little, of her future mate, was directed\r\nto run until out of breath on hearing the first notes of the cuckoo,\r\nand on removing her shoe she would find a hair of the same colour as\r\nthat of the husband whom fate had selected for her. On May-day a snail\r\nplaced upon the ashes of the hearth would trace the initial letter, or\r\nletters, of the lover’s name; or the rind, peeled from an apple and\r\nthrown backwards over the head, would by its arrangement on falling to\r\nthe ground effect a similar purpose:—\r\n\r\n  “Last May-day fair I search’d to find a snail\r\n  That might my secret lover’s name reveal:\r\n  Upon a gooseberry bush a snail I found,\r\n  For always snails near sweetest fruit abound.\r\n  I seiz’d the vermin; home I quickly sped,\r\n  And on the hearth the milk white embers spread,\r\n  Slow crawled the snail, and if I right can spell\r\n  In the soft ashes marked a curious L.”[50]\r\n\r\nThis couplet was recited by young maidens after capturing an insect\r\ncalled a Lady-bird, and on releasing it:—\r\n\r\n  “Fly, Lady-bird, fly south, east, or west;\r\n  Fly where the man is that I love best.”\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from an “inventarye of all the goods and chattels\r\nof Peter Birket, late of Borrands,” taken after his decease in 1661,\r\nwill furnish a pretty accurate idea of the monetary worth of certain\r\narticles of farming stock at that time:—“One outshoote of hay, £1 6s.\r\n8d.; one stack of hay without dores, 10s.; one scaffold of hay, 10s.;\r\none mare and one colt, £3; five geese, 4s.; 13 sheepe, £3; one cock and\r\nfive hens, 2s.; one calfe, 10s.; two heiffers, £3; one heiffer, £2; one\r\ncow, £2 10s.; another cow, £3 10s.” Whether this gentleman was a fair\r\nrepresentative of his class or not we are unable to say, but if so, the\r\nsmall farmers of Lancashire, to whom he appears to have belonged, were\r\nnot over indulgent in articles of dress or comfort, for the whole of\r\nhis wearing apparel was valued at no more than £1, whilst his bedding\r\nrealised only 5s.\r\n\r\nIn 1725 the Lancashire justices arranged and ordered that the rate of\r\nwages in all parts of this county should be:—\r\n\r\n  A bailiff in husbandry,\r\n    or chief hind                  £6   0s.  0d. per year, with board.\r\n\r\n  A chief servant in husbandry,\r\n    able to mow or sow              5   0    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\n  A common servant in husbandry\r\n    of 24 years of age and upwards  4   0    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\n  A man servant from 20\r\n    to 24 years of age              3  10    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\n  A man servant from 16\r\n    to 20 years of age              2  10    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\n  The best woman servant,\r\n    able to cook                    2  10    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\n  Dairy man, or lower servant       2   0    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\n  Woman servant under\r\n    16 years of age                 1  10    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\n  The best of millers               5   0    0      ”          ”\r\n\r\nThey also appointed the hours of labour for those hired by the day to be,\r\nbetween the middle of March and the middle of September, from five in the\r\nmorning until half-past seven in the evening, and during the remainder of\r\nthe year from sunrise to sunset, resting half-an-hour at breakfast, an\r\nhour at dinner, and half-an-hour at “drinking,” as the meal corresponding\r\nto our “tea” was termed. “In the summer half,” added the magisterial\r\nmandate, “the labourers may sleep each day half-an-hour; else for every\r\nhour’s absence to defaulk a penny; and every Saturday afternoon or eve of\r\na holiday, that they cease to work, is to be accounted but half a day.”\r\nThe day wages, as fixed by the same authorities, were:—\r\n\r\n  The best kind of husbandry labourer  12d. without, and 6d. with board.\r\n  An ordinary labourer                 10d.   ”      and 5d.     ”\r\n  A male haymaker                      10d.   ”      and 6d.     ”\r\n  A woman haymaker                      7d.   ”      and 3d.     ”\r\n  A mower                              15d.   ”      and 9d.     ”\r\n  A man shearer                        12d.   ”      and 6d.     ”\r\n  A woman shearer                      10d.   ”      and 6d.     ”\r\n  Hedgers, Ditchers, Threshers, and\r\n    persons employed in task work      10d.   ”      and 6d.     ”\r\n  Masons, Joiners, Plumbers, Tilers,\r\n    Slaters, Coopers, and Turners      12d.   ”      and 6d.     ”\r\n  Master workman, acting as foreman    14d. without board.\r\n\r\nFrom 1660 to 1690, the average price of mutton was 2d. per pound; from\r\n1706 to 1730, 2½d.; and from 1730 to 1760, 3d. per pound. The prices of\r\nbeef, veal, and lamb in 1710, were respectively 1⅒d., 2⅗d., and 2⁹⁄₁₀d.,\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth and earlier part of the nineteenth centuries\r\nthere was perhaps no pastime more popular amongst the adult members of\r\nall classes than the callous sport of cock-fighting; every village and\r\nhamlet in the Fylde had its pit, where mains were held at all times and\r\nseasons. The following were the rules pretty generally adopted in this\r\nneighbourhood for the regulation of the contests:—\r\n\r\n  “1.—To begin the main by fighting the lighter pair of cocks which\r\n  fall in match first, proceeding upwards towards the end, that\r\n  every lighter pair may fight earlier than those that are heavier.\r\n\r\n  “2.—In matching, with relation to the battles, after the cocks of\r\n  the main are weighed, the match bills are to be compared.\r\n\r\n  “3.—That every pair of equal weight are separated, and fight\r\n  against others; provided it appears that the main can be enlarged\r\n  by adding thereto.”\r\n\r\nSkippool was one of the favourite resorts for the gentry of our district\r\nwhen wishful to indulge in their favourite amusement, and frequent\r\nallusions to the cockpit there are to be found in the journal of Thomas\r\nTyldesley, of Fox Hall, as—“June 9, 1714, ... thence to Skipall, where\r\nat a cockin I meet with a deal of gentlemen. Gave Ned M⸺y 1s. for his\r\nexpenses; spent 1s., and won 2s. 6d. of Dr. Hesketh’s cockes.” In 1790 a\r\nnotice appeared in Liverpool that “The great main of cocks between John\r\nClifton, Esq., of Lytham, and Thomas Townley Parker, Esq., of Cuerden,\r\nwould be fought on Easter Monday, the 5th of April, and the three\r\nfollowing days, at the new cockpit in Cockspur Street—to show forty-one\r\ncocks each. Ten guineas each battle, and two hundred guineas the main.”\r\nThe great-grandfather of the present Lord Derby compelled each of his\r\ntenants to maintain a game-cock for his benefit, and many were the birds\r\nsupplied from the Fylde to uphold his great reputation as a successful\r\ncock-fighter.\r\n\r\nOne of the most ancient punishments amongst our forefathers was that\r\nof the Brank or Scolds’ Bridle, a specimen of which was possessed by\r\nKirkham, and doubtless many others existed in the Fylde. This instrument\r\nwas but little removed in severity from those implements of torture in\r\nvogue at the time of the Inquisition, but differed from them in one\r\nimportant particular—it was intended to control or silence, and not to\r\nstimulate, the tongue of its victim. The Brank consisted of an iron\r\nframework, which was fitted on to the head of the offender, usually some\r\nwoman whose intemperate language had incensed her husband; and a metal\r\nspike, attached to the front of it, was so inserted into the mouth that\r\nthe slightest movement of the tongue brought that sensitive organ in\r\ncontact with its sharp edge or point. Doctor Plott, who appears to have\r\nheld the Brank in high estimation, and to have considered it greatly\r\nsuperior to another mode of correction, much in fashion during his day,\r\nsays:—“This artifice is much to be preferred to the ducking-stool, which\r\nnot only endangers the health of the party, but gives liberty of tongue\r\nbetwixt every dip.”\r\n\r\nThe Ducking-stool or Cuck-stool consisted of a substantial chair,\r\nfastened to the extremity of a long pole, and suspended over a pool of\r\nwater. The middle of the pole rested on an upright post near the edge of\r\nthe pond, and was attached to it by means of a pivot-hinge, so that the\r\nchair could be swung round to the side to receive its victim, and, after\r\nbeing freighted and restored to its original position, plunged into the\r\nwater by raising the other end of the shaft as often as those on the\r\nbank deemed it necessary to cool the anger of the unfortunate scold.\r\nSeveral pools in different parts of the Fylde still retain their names\r\nof Cucking-ponds, and the last person condemned to suffer the barbarous\r\npunishment was a young woman at Poulton, but she was happily rescued by\r\nthe kindly intervention of Madam Hornby, who became surety for her good\r\nconduct in future.\r\n\r\nIn the belfry of Bispham church there formerly stood a plain-looking\r\nwooden frame, which in earlier times had done duty as a pennance-stool,\r\nbut some years since the chair was removed, and probably destroyed, as no\r\ntrace of its existence has since been discovered. The last to perform\r\npennance in this church and sit upon the stool was a woman, who seems to\r\nhave been living as recently as 1836. A public pennance was exacted by\r\nthe Church from all frail maidens, who desired to obtain pardon for the\r\nsins into which they had fallen. The ceremony consisted of parading the\r\naisles of the parish church with a candle in each hand, barefooted, and\r\nclothed in white. Jane Breckal, of Poulton, was the last to undergo the\r\nceremony at that place, some time during the ministry of the Rev. Thos.\r\nTurner, 1770 to 1810. The sobs and cries of the unfortunate girl aroused\r\nthe indignation of the inhabitants against the pennance, and the cruel\r\nand degrading exhibition was never repeated.\r\n\r\nRiding Stang was another plan of punishment formerly inflicted on\r\nquarrelsome or adulterous persons, and a woman named Idle, of Great\r\nLayton, is mentioned as being the last of its victims in that locality,\r\nand very likely in the whole of the Fylde. There seem to have been two\r\nways adopted of Riding Stang, one of which was to mount the offending\r\nparty or parties on a ladder, supported at each end on the shoulders of\r\none or sometimes two men, and carry them about the neighbourhood for\r\nseveral hours, accompanied by a band of men and boys beating tin kettles,\r\nfrying-pans, etc.; the other mode, and perhaps the more antique one, was\r\nto place a youth astride a ladder, borne as in the previous case, and\r\narm him with a hand-bell, so that he was fully equipped to undertake\r\nthe duties of town crier. A procession was then formed, and, amidst the\r\ndiscordant sounds of the instruments just alluded to, paraded through\r\nthe streets of the village, whilst the crier, who usually did his part\r\nwith great gusto, shouted out the following doggrel rhymes, varying some\r\nportions of them when occasion required:—\r\n\r\n  “Ran a dan, ran a dan, dan, dan,\r\n  But for ... has been banging his good dame.\r\n  He banged her, he banged her, he banged her, indeed,\r\n  He banged her, poor woman, before she stood need;\r\n  For neither wasting his substance nor spending his brass,\r\n  But she was a woman, and he was an ass.\r\n  Now, all good people that live in this row,\r\n  I would have you take warning, for this is our law,\r\n  And if you do your good wives bang,\r\n  For you three nights we will ride this stang.\r\n                        Hurrah! hurrah!”\r\n\r\nWhen the offender happened to be some woman, who had inflicted\r\nchastisement on the person of her spouse, the rhyme was altered to suit\r\nher sex, and asserted that “he was a coward, and she was an ass.” The\r\nremains of stocks in various states of preservation, are still to be seen\r\nin many old villages, and their use is of too recent a date to require\r\nany elucidation in this volume.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth Sunday in Lent, Carling Sunday, the villagers prepared a\r\nfeast, consisting chiefly of peas, first steeped in water, and afterwards\r\nfried in butter, which were eaten on the afternoon of that day. Small\r\ntroops or companies of pace-egg mummers went from house to house in\r\nPassion week enacting a short dramatic piece, and afterwards soliciting\r\nmoney, or, in some cases, eggs, from their audience. The _dramatis\r\npersonæ_ usually represented St. George, the champion of England; a Turk,\r\ndressed in national costume; the Doctor, of the quack fraternity; the\r\nFool; and one or two others. In the play, the Turk was wounded by St.\r\nGeorge, and being left for dead upon the field, guarded by the Fool, was\r\nrestored to health and strength by the Doctor, who opportunely arrived,\r\nand concluded his self-laudatory harangue over the body of the apparently\r\ndefunct Turk, thus:—\r\n\r\n  “Here, Jack, take a little out of my bottle,\r\n  And let it run down thy throttle;\r\n  If thou be not quite slain,\r\n  Rise, Jack, and fight again.”\r\n\r\nEaster mumming is now rapidly becoming obsolete, and at present amounts\r\nto nothing more entertaining than the recital of a few weak, almost\r\nmeaningless, rhymes, by, usually, five young boys, decorated with ribbons\r\nand coloured paper, and supposed to represent Lord Nelson, a Jack-Tar, a\r\nLovely Youth, Old Toss-pot, and Old Bessy Branbags.\r\n\r\n“Lifting at Easter” was an old-established practice, existing in the\r\nvillages, of hoisting individuals in the air, either in a chair or by any\r\nother means that might be convenient, until they purchased their release\r\nby payment of a forfeit, generally some small coin. On Ascension-day\r\nthe parochial schoolmaster conducted his pupils, armed with peeled\r\nwillow wands, round the limits of the parish, and each pupil struck the\r\nvarious boundary marks with his stick as he passed them. All-Hallows’\r\nE’en was the time when the young people tested the durability of love or\r\nfriendship by burning nuts:—\r\n\r\n  “Two hazel nuts I threw into the flame,\r\n  And to each nut I gave a sweetheart’s name:\r\n  This with the loudest bounce, me sore amazed,\r\n  That in a flame of brightest colour blazed;\r\n  As blazed the nut, so may thy passion grow,\r\n  For ’twas thy nut that did so brightly glow!”[51]\r\n\r\nOther pastimes contributed to the evening’s amusement, such as “ducking\r\nfor apples,” and “snatch apple”—a tub, in the former case, having been\r\nnearly filled with water, and the fruit placed in it, each in turn, with\r\nhands bound behind them, endeavoured to seize the prize with the teeth;\r\nin the latter game, an apple was fastened to one extremity of a rod and a\r\nlighted candle to the other, the whole being suspended by a string from\r\nthe ceiling, and the players, bound as before, snapped at the apple, and\r\navoided the flame as well as they were able.\r\n\r\nUntil within the last fifty or sixty years, the mosses of Marton and\r\nthe hills in the vicinity of the Fylde were illuminated with bonfires\r\non All-Hallows’ Eve, or Teanlay-night, as it was called, kindled by\r\nthe country people with the avowed object of succouring their friends\r\nwho were lingering in the imaginary regions of a middle state. A field\r\nnear Poulton received the name of “Purgatory” from the mummery of the\r\n“Teanlays” having, on one occasion at least, been celebrated there.[52]\r\nThis ceremony was simple in its performance, and consisted merely of a\r\ncircle of men raising masses of blazing straw on high with pitch-forks.\r\nOn All Souls’ Day our Catholic forefathers were accustomed to bake cakes\r\nof oatmeal and aromatic seeds, named Soul-cakes, and these, together with\r\npasties and furmety, formed a feast invariably eaten at that season.\r\nRemnants of this custom existed even in late years amongst the youths of\r\nMarton and some other townships and villages, who on the day of ancient\r\nfestival solicited money, under the name of Soul-pence, from their\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nWe will now enumerate some of the superstitions and beliefs that have\r\nprevailed in the Fylde more recently than those to which allusion has\r\nbeen made in the earlier part of the chapter.\r\n\r\nThe following adage, showing the signification of certain marks on the\r\nnails, will probably be familiar to many of our readers, and it is\r\nquestionable whether, even yet, it is not regarded by a few of the less\r\nenlightened of the peasantry as something more than a mere saying:—\r\n\r\n  “Specks on the fingers,\r\n  Fortune often lingers;\r\n  Specks on the thumbs,\r\n  Fortune surely comes.”\r\n\r\nNo sick person could die if the bed or pillow upon which he lay contained\r\na pigeon’s feather; and, at an earlier date, the dwellers near the\r\ncoast firmly believed that life could only depart with the ebbing tide.\r\nA horse-shoe nailed against the stable or barn-door, or a broom-stick\r\nplaced across the threshold of the dwelling, prevented the entrance of\r\nwitches or evil persons; also a hot heater placed in the churn, and\r\nthe mark of a cross, protected respectively the cream and baking of\r\ndough from their presence. The advent of guests was made known to the\r\nfamily circle by certain conditions of the fire-grate; thus, a flake\r\nof soot hanging from the topmost bar foretold a boy visitor, from the\r\nsecond a man, from the third a woman, and from the fourth a girl. Cats\r\nwere popularly supposed to have the power of drawing the breath, and\r\nas a natural consequence the life, out of children when asleep, and\r\nfor this reason great care was taken to exclude them from bedchambers.\r\nShould a dark complexioned person be the first to enter a dwelling on\r\nNew Year’s morning, the household looked forward with confidence to a\r\nprosperous year; but if the person happened to be light, more especially\r\nif he had red hair, the omen was regarded as unpropitious. Moon-beams\r\nshining through the windows of bedrooms were considered injurious to the\r\nsleepers, and even capable of distorting their features, or rendering\r\nthem imbecile. Children were taught to recite these simple lines whenever\r\nthe moon shone into their chambers:—\r\n\r\n  “I see the moon,\r\n  The moon sees me;\r\n  God bless the priest\r\n  That christened me.”\r\n\r\nA tooth, after extraction, was sprinkled with salt and thrown into the\r\nfire in order to insure peace and comfort to the person from whose mouth\r\nit had been removed. A pair of shoes placed under the bed so that the\r\ntips of the toes alone were visible, formed a certain remedy for cramp.\r\nWarts were removed by rubbing them with a piece of stolen beef, which was\r\nafterwards carefully and secretly buried to render the charm complete;\r\na snail hung on to a thorn was equally efficacious in removing these\r\nexcrescences, which gradually faded away as the snail itself melted and\r\nvanished. A bag, containing small stones of the same number as the warts,\r\nthrown over the left shoulder, transmitted them to the person who had\r\nthe misfortune to pick up the pebbles. People labouring under attacks of\r\nague, jaundice, or other ailments, applied for relief to the wise-men\r\nof the neighbourhood, who professed to cure them by incantations. The\r\ntwo following receipts are taken from an old medical work, published as\r\nearly as 1612, and in its time a highly popular authority on matters of\r\n“Phisicke and Chirurgerie” amongst our rural populations:—\r\n\r\n  “A good Medicine to staunch the bleeding of the Nose, although it\r\n  bleed never so freely.\r\n\r\n  “Take an egg and breake it on the top, in such sorte that all\r\n  the white and yolke may issue cleane forthe of it; then fill the\r\n  egg-shell with some of the bloud of the party which bleedeth, and\r\n  put it in the fire, and there let it remaine until it be harde,\r\n  and then burne it to ashes, and it will staunch the bleeding\r\n  immediately without all doubt.”\r\n\r\n  “A very good Medicine to staunch bloud when nothing else will do\r\n  it, by reason the veine is cut, or that the wound is greate.\r\n\r\n  “Take a Toade and dry him very well in the sunne, and then put\r\n  him in a linen Bagge, and hang him about the necke of him that\r\n  bleedeth with a stringe, and let it hange so low that it may\r\n  touch his breaste on the left side neere unto his hart, and\r\n  commonly this will stay all manner of bleeding at the mouth,\r\n  nose, wound, or otherwise whatever. Probatum est.”\r\n\r\nA woman named Bamber, living at Marton, attained to considerable\r\ncelebrity amongst the peasantry and others by her skill in checking\r\nbleeding, which she is reported to have accomplished by the utterance of\r\nsome mystic words.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Fylde were not exempt from the common belief in the\r\nmiraculous power of the Royal touch in that particular form of disease\r\nknown as king’s evil, for amongst the records of the Thirty-men of\r\nKirkham is a notice that in 1632 a sum of money was “given to Ricd.\r\nBarnes’s child, that had the king’s evil, to help him up to London,” to\r\nbe touched by Charles I.\r\n\r\nThe fairies of the Fylde were supposed, like those of other localities,\r\nto reside in the earth; the vicinity of a cold spring, situated between\r\nHardhorn and Newton, was one of their legendary resorts, and from such\r\nreputation acquired the name of “Fairies’ well.” Many stories are told\r\nof the mischievous, or good-natured doings of these imaginary beings;\r\none or two of which we will here narrate:—A poor woman when filling her\r\npitcher at the above well, in order to bathe the weak eyes of her infant,\r\nwas gently addressed by a handsome man, who gave her a small box of\r\nointment, and told her at the same time that it would prove an infallible\r\nremedy for the ailment of her child. The woman, although grateful for\r\nthe present, either overcome by that irresistible curiosity which is\r\ncommonly, but perhaps erroneously, supposed to attach itself to her sex,\r\nor doubtful of the efficacy which the stranger had assigned to the drug,\r\napplied it to one of her own eyes. A few days afterwards she had occasion\r\nto go to Preston, and whilst there detected her benefactor in the act of\r\nstealing corn from the open mouths of some sacks exposed for sale, and,\r\nhaving accosted him, began to remonstrate with him on the wickedness of\r\nhis proceedings, when he inquired with evident surprise, how she became\r\nenabled to observe him, as he was invisible to all else. She explained\r\nthe use that had been made of his ointment, and pointed to the powerful\r\neye; but hardly had the words been uttered and the organ of supernatural\r\nvision indicated, before he raised his clenched hand, and with one blow\r\nstruck out the offending optic, or rather reduced it to a state of total\r\nand irrecoverable blindness. Another anecdote refers to a milkmaid, who,\r\nwhilst engaged in her avocation, perceived a jug and sixpence placed\r\nnear to her by some invisible means; but no way disconcerted by the\r\nsingular event, and probably attributing it to the agency of one of the\r\nelvan tribes, she filled the pitcher with milk, and, having watched its\r\nmysterious disappearance and, with unerring commercial instinct, pocketed\r\nthe silver coin, took her departure. This episode was repeated for many\r\nsuccessive mornings, until the maiden, overjoyed at her good fortune,\r\nrevealed the curious adventures to her lover, and from that hour the\r\nhobgoblins appear either to have grown less thirsty, or, annoyed at what\r\nthey might consider the betrayal of their secret, to have removed their\r\ncustom to some other dairy, for neither jug nor sixpence ever gladdened\r\nthe morning labours of the milkmaid again. A ploughman had his good\r\nnature, in cheerfully repairing the broken “spittle” of a lady liberally\r\nrewarded. The fairy, for such she proved to be, made known her presence\r\nto the agriculturist by suddenly crying in a distressed tone—“I have\r\nbroken my speet,” and then held out in her hands the useless instrument\r\nwith a hammer and nails. No sooner had she received her property,\r\nrestored to a state of utility, than she vanished into the earth, but\r\nnot, however, without leaving a substantial acknowledgment of his skill\r\nand kindness in the palm of the astonished husbandman.\r\n\r\nWe can only discover a record of one witch in the Fylde; this person of\r\nunenviable notoriety is stated to have had her abode in Singleton, and\r\nto have been known to the villagers as Mag Shelton. Her food, according\r\nto local tradition, was composed of boiled groats mixed with thyme or\r\nparsley, and numerous are the anecdotes related of her evil machinations\r\nand doings in the neighbourhood—the cows of the country people were\r\nconstantly milked by her, whilst the pitcher walked before her in the\r\nform of a goose; lives were blighted and prosperity checked by the\r\ninfluence of her evil eye. Once, however, she was foiled by a girl, who\r\nfastened her to a chair by sticking a bodkin, crossed with two weavers’\r\nhealds, about her dress when seated before a large fire.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the spiritual condition of the peasantry may be obtained\r\nfrom the perusal of the following prayer, a common one amongst the\r\nchildren of the Fylde about one hundred years ago:—\r\n\r\n  “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,\r\n  Bless the bed that I lie on;\r\n  There are four corners to my bed,\r\n  And four angels overspread,\r\n  Two at the feet and two at the head.\r\n  If any ill thing me betide,\r\n  Beneath your wings my body hide.\r\n  Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,\r\n  Bless the bed that I lie on.”\r\n\r\nBacon was considered to prove the finest and best if the hogs were\r\nslaughtered before the moon began to wane, and in some month whose name\r\ncontained the letter R:—\r\n\r\n  “Unless your bacon you would mar\r\n  Kill not your pig without the R.”\r\n\r\nThe dumb-cake was made by unmarried women who wished to divine the\r\nselection of fate as to their future husbands. The cake was baked in\r\nstrict silence by two maidens on Midsummer’s eve, and afterwards broken\r\ninto three pieces by another, who placed one under each of their pillows;\r\nduring sleep the expectant fair ones were rewarded with a vision of their\r\nlovers, but the charm was ruined if only a single word were spoken.\r\nHemp-seed, also, was sown by young maidens, who whilst scattering it\r\nrecited the words “Hemp-seed I sow, hemp-seed I hoe, and he that is my\r\ntrue-love come after me and mow.” After repeating the rhyme three times\r\nit was only necessary to look over the shoulder, and the apparition of\r\nthe destined swain would never fail to appear:—\r\n\r\n  “At eve last Midsummer no sleep I sought,\r\n  But to the field a bag of hemp-seed brought;\r\n  I scattered round the seed on every side,\r\n  And three times, in a trembling accent cried:\r\n  ‘This hemp-seed with my virgin hand I sow,\r\n  Who shall my true love be the crop shall mow.’\r\n  I straight looked back, and, if my eyes speak truth,\r\n  With his keen scythe behind me came a youth.”[53]\r\n\r\nA spinster who fasted on Midsummer’s eve, and at midnight laid a clean\r\ncloth, with bread, cheese, and ale, and sat down to the table as though\r\nabout to eat, would be gratified with a sight of the person to whom\r\nshe would be married. This individual was supposed to pass through the\r\ndoorway, left open for the purpose, as the clock struck twelve, and,\r\napproaching the table, to salute his future partner with a bow and a\r\npretence of drinking her health, after which he vanished, and the maid\r\nretired to her couch to rejoice or mourn, according as she admired or\r\ncontemned the prospect in store for her. Cuttings or combings from the\r\nhair were thrown into the fire, and upon their blazing brightly or\r\nsmouldering away depended the duration of life likely to be enjoyed\r\nby the person from whose head they had been taken. Wishing-wells and\r\ngates were visited by credulous rustics, who were anxious to make use\r\nof their mysterious power in obtaining their desires in matters of love\r\nor business. The forefinger was deemed venomous, and on that account\r\nchildren were instructed not to spread salve or ointment with it.\r\n\r\nAbout a century ago oats formed the chief production, and nearly, if\r\nindeed not quite, the only grain crop cultivated in the Fylde. When\r\nreaped, in harvest time, this commodity was carried on the backs of\r\npack-horses to the markets of Poulton, Kirkham, Garstang, and Preston.\r\nThe “horse bridge” between Carleton and Poulton was originally a narrow\r\nstructure, capable only of affording passage to a single horse at once,\r\nand it was from the practice of the farmers, with their laden cattle,\r\ncrossing the stream by its aid, when journeying to market, that the\r\nbridge derived its name. These horses followed a leader ornamented\r\nwith a bell, and after they had arrived at their destination and been\r\nrelieved of their burdens, returned home in the same order without a\r\ndriver, leaving him to attend to his duties at the market. The old bridge\r\nin use at the period to which we allude, still exists, but is built\r\nover and hidden by the present erection. Later experience has taught\r\nthe agriculturist that the soil of the Fylde is capable of producing,\r\nunder proper tillage, other crops, equal in their abundance to the one\r\nto which it appears formerly to have been mainly devoted, and it would\r\nbe difficult at the present day to enumerate with accuracy the many and\r\nvaried fruits of the earth that have found a home in the Corn-field of\r\nAmounderness.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned about the commencement of the chapter that marl was in\r\ngeneral use as a manure in the Anglo-Saxon era, and here it is perhaps\r\nhardly necessary to state that this substance, so rich in lime and so\r\nadapted for giving consistency to the sandy soils, is still occasionally\r\nhad recourse to by the husbandman. Guano was first introduced into this\r\ncountry about the year 1842, but it is probable that it was not commonly\r\nused in our district until the beginning of 1845, when a cargo was\r\nimported from Ichaboe to Fleetwood by Messrs. Kemp and Co., and offered\r\nfor sale to the farmers of the neighbourhood. Other cargoes followed.\r\nSubjoined are arranged some tables showing the average market values of\r\ncertain productions of the Fylde in the two years given:—\r\n\r\n                                 1847.                      1867.\r\n                               Inclusive.

To Julius Cæsar we are indebted for our earliest\r\nknowledge of the scanty dress worn by the aborigines of this district,\r\nand from that warrior it is learnt that a slight covering of roughly\r\nprepared skins, girded about the loins, and the liberal application of\r\na blue dye, called woad, to the rest of the body constituted the sole\r\nrequisites of their primitive toilets. Cæsar conjectures that the juice\r\nor dye of woad was employed by the people to give them a terror-striking\r\naspect in battle, but here he seems to have fallen into error, for the\r\nwars engaged in by the Setantii would be confined to hostilities with\r\nneighbouring tribes, stained in a similar manner, and it is scarcely\r\nreasonable to suppose that either side would hope to intimidate the other\r\nby the use of a practice common to both. A more probable explanation\r\nof the custom is, that it was instituted for the ornamental qualities\r\nit possessed in the eyes of the natives. Such a view is supported\r\nby the remarks of Solinus, a Roman author, who informs us that the\r\nembellishments usually consisted of the figures of animals, “which grew\r\nwith the growth of the body”; and from this it is evident that before\r\nthe frame had arrived at maturity, in either youth or childhood, the\r\nskin was subjected to the painful and laborious process of tattooing,\r\nfor such according to Isidore, appears to have been the nature of the\r\noperation. The latter asserts that the staining was accomplished by\r\nsqueezing out the juice of the plant on to the skin, and puncturing it\r\nin with sharp needles. When the Romans established a station at Kirkham,\r\nand opened out the Fylde by means of a good road-way to the coast, the\r\nSetantii modified their wild uncultivated habits, and, taking pattern\r\nfrom the more civilised garb of their conquerors, adopted a covering\r\nfor the lower limbs, called _brachæ_, hence the modern breeches, whilst\r\nmany of the chiefs were not long before they strutted about in all the\r\npride of a _toga_, or gown. About four hundred years later, when the\r\nAnglo-Saxons had taken possession of the soil of the Fylde, and had\r\neither appropriated the deserted settlements and renamed them, or reared\r\nsmall and scattered groups of dwellings of their own, a marked change\r\nbecame visible in the nationality, character, and costumes of the people.\r\nNo longer the semi-civilised and half-clad Briton was lord of the domain,\r\nbut the more refined Saxon with his linen shirt, drawers, and stockings,\r\neither of linen or woollen, and bandaged crosswise from the ankle to the\r\nknee with strips of leather; over these a tunic of the same material as\r\nthe stockings was thrown, and reached as low as the knees, being plain or\r\nornamented according to the means or rank of the wearer. This garment was\r\nopen at the neck and for a short distance over the chest; the sleeves,\r\nextending to the wrists, were generally tight, and a girdle frequently,\r\nbut not universally, confined the gown round the waist. In addition a\r\nsmall cloak was worn for out-door purposes over the tunic, and fastened\r\non the breast or shoulder with brooches or clasps. The shoes of the Saxon\r\nsettlers were open down the instep, where they were laced or tied with\r\ntwo thongs. Even the very lowest of the population, although poverty\r\nmight reduce them to miserable straits, seldom, if ever, went barefooted.\r\nCaps, on the contrary, were not in great request, and rarely to be seen,\r\nunless on the heads of some of the more affluent. Our female ancestors at\r\nthat era were habited in a close-fitting dress, falling to the feet and\r\nfurnished with tight sleeves, reaching as far as the wrists, over which\r\nwas placed a shorter gown with loose open sleeves. Their head-dress was\r\nsimply a strip of linen of sufficient length to wrap round the temples\r\nand fall on the neck. Amongst the wealthiest of the nation a flowing\r\nmantle, ornaments of precious metal, and sable, beaver, and fox furs\r\nwere common, but the inhabitants of the Fylde, being of less exalted\r\nsocial standing, were obliged to content themselves with the skins of\r\nlambs and cats by way of adornment. The inferior farm servants, called\r\nserfs, amongst whom many of the vanquished Britons would be classed,\r\nwere seldom indulged by their masters with more than a coat, a pair of\r\ndrawers, and sandals, the shirt, we presume, being deemed ill suited to\r\ntheir positions of servitude and dependence.\r\n\r\nThe colonisation of the Danes, whatever effect it may have had upon the\r\nhabits and condition of the people, exercised no lasting influence upon\r\ntheir dress, and it was not until half a century after the Norman baron,\r\nRoger de Poictou, had parcelled out the land amongst his tenants, that\r\nthe bulk of the males were induced, by the example of the new-comers, to\r\ndisplay their taste in the choice of a head-covering. Many varieties were\r\ndaily open to their inspection on the brows of the Norman landholders\r\nand servants, but the diffidence, let us hope, of the now humbled Saxons\r\nsuggested the adoption of an exceedingly plain flat species of bonnet,\r\nwhich speedily became the common cap of the district. The ladies,\r\nhowever, with a greater aptitude for rising superior to disappointment\r\nand affliction, were not dilatory in benefitting by the superior style\r\nof the fair partners of their conquerors, and soon, putting aside all\r\nsemblance of depression, appeared in long cuffs, hanging to the ground\r\nfrom their upper dress sleeves and tied in a large knot; their kerchiefs,\r\nalso, whose modest proportions had formerly served only to encircle the\r\nforehead, were now extravagantly lengthened and fastened in a similar\r\nmanner. As years rolled on and fashion began to assert her sway with\r\na greater show of authority, the shoes of the men underwent certain\r\nchanges, becoming more neat in workmanship and having the toes somewhat\r\nelongated and pointed, whilst the richer of the gentry, chiefly Normans,\r\nwore short boots reaching a little distance up the calf. In the early\r\npart of the thirteenth century the female head-dresses consisted of\r\nnets, made from various materials, in which the hair was confined; and\r\nthe trains of the gowns were lengthened. Later in the same era cowls\r\nor hoods, twisted and pinned in fanciful shapes, adorned the heads of\r\nthe ladies, and formed the main feature of their walking costumes.\r\nAprons also came up at that period. The dress of the men underwent\r\nno alteration of any moment until the first half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, when the manorial lords of the neighbourhood, and others of\r\nthe inhabitants, discarded the cloaks and tunics of their forefathers,\r\nand substituted in their stead a close-fitting outer garment of costly\r\nand handsome material, scarcely covering the hips, immediately above\r\nwhich it was surrounded by a girdle. The sleeves usually terminated at\r\nthe elbows, and from there long white streamers depended, whilst the\r\nsleeves of an under dress reached to the wrists, and were ornamented\r\nwith rows of buttons. A long cape and cowl was the general overcoat.\r\nThe most characteristic dress of the ladies was a habit cut away at the\r\nsides so as to expose the under skirt, which was invariably of rich and\r\nfine texture. The long white streamers, just alluded to, were part of\r\nthe female as well as the male attire, and the borders of the habit were\r\nbound with fur or velvet. We may mention that an English beau of that\r\nera wore long pointed shoes, the toes of which were connected with the\r\nknees by gold or silver chains, a long stocking of different colour on\r\neach leg, short trowsers, barely extending to the middle of the thigh, a\r\ncoat, half of which was white and the other blue or some equally bright\r\ncolour, and a silken hood or bonnet, fastened under the chin, embroidered\r\nwith grotesque figures of animals, and occasionally decked with gold and\r\nprecious stones. Lest, however, the reputations of our ancestors should\r\nsuffer in the eyes of the present generation from the existence in their\r\nage of the absurdity here pictured, it is our duty and pleasure to assure\r\nall readers that such parodies on manhood were strictly confined to the\r\npopulous cities, and that there is no probability of even a solitary\r\nspecimen ever having desecrated the modest soil of the Fylde.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater portion of the succeeding cycle of a hundred years\r\na species of cloth turban was much in favour amongst the male sex of\r\nthe middle and upper classes, from one side of which a length of the\r\nsame material hung down below the waist, and was either thrust between\r\nthe girdle and the coat, or wrapped round the neck as a protection from\r\ncold. Faces were cleanly shaved, and hair cut as close to the scalp as\r\npossible; hitherto, from about the date of the first arrival of the\r\nNormans, the practice had been to allow the latter to grow long and to\r\nwear the beard. The hose were long and tight. The boots were either\r\nshort, or reached half-way up the thighs, both kinds being long toed.\r\nOccasionally a single feather relieved the plainness of the turban-shaped\r\ncap. The ordinary dress of the gentlewomen was a full trained robe\r\nor gown, made high in the neck, and sometimes, with a fur or velvet\r\nturn-over collar, its folds at the short-waist being confined by means of\r\na simple band and buckle. Coiffures were mostly heart-shaped, but in some\r\nrare instances horned. The sleeves of the above costume were, shortly\r\nafter its institution, lengthened and widened to a ridiculous extent.\r\nTowards the end of the particular era of which we are writing trains\r\nwere discontinued, and broad borders of fur substituted, whilst round\r\ntapering hats, two feet in height, with loose kerchiefs floating from the\r\napex, came much into favour. The last few years of the fifteenth and the\r\nearliest ones of the sixteenth centuries were marked by great changes\r\nin the male attire; the Butlers, Cliftons, Carletons, Westbys, Allens,\r\nMolyneux, and many others of the gentry of the neighbourhood, figured\r\nat that period in fine shirts of long lawn, embroidered with silk round\r\nthe collar and wristbands, a doublet with sleeves open at the elbows to\r\nallow the shirt to protrude, a stomacher, over which the doublet was\r\nlaced; a long gown or cloak, with loose or hanging sleeves and broad\r\nturn-over collar of fur or velvet; long hose or stockings; broad-toed\r\nshoes for ordinary use, and high boots, reaching to the knees, for riding\r\npurposes; and broad felt hats, or variously shaped caps of fur or velvet,\r\nadorned with ostrich or other feathers. The hair was permitted to grow\r\nenormously long and fall down the back and over the shoulders, but the\r\nface was still cleanly shaved, with the exception of military and aged\r\npersons, who wore mustaches or beards. The wives and daughters, belonging\r\nto such families as those alluded to, were habited in upper garments, cut\r\nsquare at the neck, and stomachers, belts, and buckles, or costly girdles\r\nwith long pendants in front. The sleeves were slit at the elbows in a\r\nmanner similar to those of the men. High head-dresses were abandoned,\r\nand a cap or caul of gold net or embroidery, which allowed the hair to\r\nflow beneath it half way to the ground, took their place. Turbans, also,\r\nwere fashionable for a brief season. The females of a humbler sphere\r\nwore plain grey cloth gowns, ornamented with lambs’ skin or wool, and\r\ncloaks of Lincoln green; the appearance of such an one upon a holiday is\r\ndescribed by Skelton, the laureate of Henry VII., as under:—\r\n\r\n  “Her kirtle bristow red,\r\n  With cloths upon her head,\r\n  They weigh a ton of lead.\r\n  She hobbles as she goes,\r\n  With her blanket hose,\r\n  Her shoone smeared with tallow.”\r\n\r\nIn the following reign, the commonalty, in imitation of the example set\r\nby the resident squires in this and other parts of the kingdom, became\r\nso extravagant in their ideas of suitable habiliments that Henry VIII.\r\nissued an edict, prohibiting them from wearing ornaments of even the\r\nmost simple description, and confining them to the use of cloth at a\r\ncertain fixed price, and lambs’ fur only. At the same time, velvets of\r\nany colour, furs of martens, chains, bracelets, and collars of gold\r\nwere allowed only to those who possessed an income of not less than two\r\nhundred marks per annum; but the sons and heirs of such were permitted\r\nto wear black velvet or damask, and tawny-coloured russet or camlet.\r\nNone but those in the yearly receipt of one hundred marks could venture\r\non satin or damask robes. The dress which may be taken as the most\r\ncharacteristic garb under the sovereignty of the last Henry and of his\r\ntwo immediate successors, comprised a doublet with long bases, or skirts,\r\nand extensive sleeves, over which was thrown a short cloak, provided with\r\narmholes for the passage of the doublet sleeves. The cloak had a wide\r\nrolling collar, made of velvet, fur, or satin, according to taste. The\r\nshirt was plaited, and embroidered with gold, silver, or silk. The hose\r\nwere closely fitted to the limb, being in some cases long and entire,\r\nand in others divided, under the names of the upper and nether stocks.\r\nSlashed shoes, or buskins of velvet and satin, with broad toes, and a cap\r\nof one of sundry forms, either simply bordered, or laden with feathers,\r\ncompleted the costume of every male member of the numerous families\r\ninhabiting the ancient halls of this section. Sir Walter Scott, who is\r\ngenerally allowed to have been pretty correct in the costumes of his\r\nheroes and minor characters, has described the appearance of a yeoman of\r\nour county about the middle of the sixteenth century as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “He was an English yeoman good,\r\n  And born in Lancashire.\r\n  ...\r\n  His coal-black hair, shorn round and close,\r\n    Set off his sun-burnt face;\r\n  Old England’s sign, St. George’s cross,\r\n    His barret-cap did grace;\r\n  His bugle horn hung from his side,\r\n    All in a wolf-skin baldric tied;\r\n  And his short falchion, sharp and clear,\r\n  Had pierced the throat of many a deer.\r\n  His kirtle, made of forest green,\r\n    Reached scantly to his knee;\r\n  And at his belt, of arrows keen\r\n  A furbished sheaf bore he.”\r\n\r\nShortly after the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1558, remarkable\r\nalterations became evident in the fashions of the inhabitants. The skirts\r\nof the doublet were reduced to much smaller dimensions, so as thoroughly\r\nto expose the upper stocks, which, under the new title of trunk-hose, had\r\nrisen to a very important place in the toilet. French trunk-hose were the\r\nfirst to render themselves conspicuous in our locality, and consisted of\r\ntwo varieties, the former of which were short, round, and full, becoming,\r\nin fact, in course of time, so swollen by padding that their use was\r\nabandoned by universal consent; and the second variety, going to the\r\nother extreme and fitting tightly to the limb, introduced. The next to\r\narrive were the Gallic hose, very large and wide, and extending to the\r\nknee only; after which came the Venetian hose, reaching below the knee to\r\nthe garter, where they were secured with silken bands. The trunk-hose,\r\nof every kind, were made of silk, velvet, satin, or damask. The nether\r\nstocks, or stockings, were of jarnsey, thread, fine yarn, and later, of\r\nsilk, whilst the shoes partook more of the nature of slippers, and were\r\nvariously decorated. Ruffs encircled the necks of the males as well as\r\nthe females. Above the doublet was worn in the Spanish style a cloak of\r\nsilk, velvet, or taffeta, and of a red, black, green, yellow, tawny,\r\nrusset, or violet colour, many being bordered with long glass beads.\r\nHats were conical and high, flat and broad, and flat and round, but in\r\nall cases were made of velvet or sarcenet, and ornamented with bunches\r\nof feathers. The robes of the ladies, made of bright-coloured velvet,\r\nsilk, or fine cloth, had both tight and wide sleeves, and were branched\r\nor opened at the front of the skirt to expose the handsome petticoat\r\nbeneath. The farthingale distended the dresses of our female ancestry\r\nfrom just below the bodice or stomacher, in a manner that few, we opine,\r\nof the fair sex would care to see revived at the present day. The ruff\r\nwas of cambric or lawn, and when first introduced, moderate in its\r\nproportions, but like many other fashions of that epoch, became enlarged\r\ninto an absurdity as years passed on. The hair of the ladies was curled,\r\ncrisped, and arranged with most elaborate care; indeed, so curious and\r\nchangeable were the coiffures that it would be tedious to our readers\r\nto offer more than this general description of them. Capes falling but\r\na short way beyond the shoulders, and faced with fringe or velvet,\r\nwere also worn. The costume of the gentlewomen during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, if the sombre garbs of the Roundhead families be excepted,\r\nconsisted of an upper gown, which comprised a bodice and short skirt,\r\nthe former being open over a laced stomacher, and the latter divided\r\nanteriorly, and its sides drawn back and looped up behind; a petticoat\r\nor under-dress, of expensive material, reaching to the ground; a yellow\r\nstarched neckerchief, overspreading the shoulders and terminating on the\r\nbosom in two pointed ends; and a high crowned hat, beneath which long\r\nringlets escaped and flowed down the back. The peasant girls or female\r\nfarm servants had plain dresses, falling to the ankles, and usually\r\ntight sleeves and aprons. The bodices of some were open to the waist,\r\nbut the stomachers, although laced, were of a very inferior kind, and\r\nthe starched neckerchiefs were wanting. The gentlemen of the Fylde were\r\ninfluenced in their choice of garments according as their sympathies\r\nwere with the King or Parliament, but there can be little question that\r\nin a locality so staunchly loyal as our own, the picturesque garb of the\r\nCavaliers would predominate over the affectedly modest and plain attire\r\nof the partizans of Cromwell. The existence on the soil of such men as\r\nSir Thomas Tyldesley, Thomas Singleton of Staining Hall, Thomas Hesketh\r\nof Mains Hall, who laid down their lives in the service of the crown,\r\nand numbers of others, who drew the sword in the cause of the throneless\r\nmonarch, are fair evidence that the above conjecture is not hazarded\r\nwithout good reason. A doublet of silk, satin, or velvet, with large\r\nwide sleeves slashed up the front; a collar covered by a band of rich\r\npoint lace, with Vandyke edging; a short cloak, thrown on one shoulder;\r\nshort trousers, fringed and reaching to the wide tops of the high boots;\r\na broad-leaved Flemish beaver hat, with a plume of feathers and band;\r\nand a sword belt and rapier, constituted the full costume of a Cavalier.\r\nInstead of the velvet doublet, a buff coat, richly laced, and encircled\r\nby a broad silk or satin scarf, fastened in a bow, was substituted when\r\nthe inhabitants were under the excitement produced by actual war, in\r\nwhich so many took part. The hair, it should be mentioned, was worn long\r\nby the Cavaliers, and closely cropped by the Roundheads, whose dress\r\noffers no special features to our notice.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of last century the occupiers of Layton, Lytham,\r\nFox, Burn, Mains, Rawcliffe, Rossall, Larbrick, etc., Halls, and others\r\nof equal social standing, who formed the gentry of the Fylde, and who\r\nconsequently must be taken as our mirror of fashion, were clothed in\r\nstraight square-cut waistcoats, extending to the knees, and of very\r\ngorgeous patterns; velvet breeches fastened below the knees; long silk\r\nstockings; buckled shoes, with high red heels; periwigs of monstrous\r\nsize; hats, cocked on three sides; long lace neckerchiefs; and lastly,\r\nbut far from the least important, a coat of rich material, having long\r\nstiff skirts and wide cuffs, turned back and adorned with gold or silver\r\nlace. The ladies had laced stomachers beneath a bodice with straight\r\nsleeves, ending at the elbow in moderately wide cuffs. The skirt of the\r\ndress was divided in front and looped up behind, disclosing a petticoat\r\nequalling or surpassing the richness of the upper garment, and trimmed\r\nwith flounces and furbelows. The boots resembled those just described,\r\nbut were more delicate in workmanship. The head-dress was composed of a\r\nspecies of cap, the lace material of which rose in three or four tiers,\r\nplaced one above another, almost to a point, whilst the hair was brushed\r\nup and arranged in stiff curls, somewhat resembling a pyramid. This\r\ncoiffure had only a brief reign, and was superseded by one less exalted,\r\nand of more elegant appearance. Hoops were introduced about 1720, and\r\nthirty years later silk aprons and gipsy straw hats, or small bonnets,\r\nwere worn. In 1765 periwigs were discarded, and the natural hair was\r\nallowed to grow, being profusely sprinkled with powder, both by males and\r\nfemales. The country people were habited in long, double-breasted coats,\r\nmade from frieze or homespun, and of a dark brown, grey, or other quiet\r\nshade; a light drugget waistcoat, red shag or plush breeches, and black\r\nstockings. There is no necessity to trace the costumes of our ancestors\r\nfurther than the point here reached, as their varieties present few\r\nphases of special interest, and probably the most striking are already\r\nsufficiently familiar to our readers. A sure, though somewhat unsteady,\r\ndecline was shortly inaugurated in the sumptuous and elaborate dresses\r\nof the people, which continued its course of reform until the more\r\neconomical and unostentatious dress of modern days had usurped the place\r\nof the showy habiliments of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY or district of the Fylde may be briefly described as broad\r\nand flat, for although in many places it is raised in gentle undulations,\r\nno hill of any altitude is to be seen upon its surface. The fertility of\r\nits soil has long been acknowledged, and a visit to its fruitful fields\r\nduring the warm months of summer would disclose numbers of rich acres\r\nyellow with the ripening grain, while potatoe and bean-fields, meadow\r\nand pasture-lands, orchards and fruit gardens, are scattered over the\r\nwide area. Our design in the present instance is not, however, to enlarge\r\nupon these cultivated features, but to notice some of the more striking\r\nnatural peculiarities, and to arrange in a classified list sundry of the\r\nrarer wild plants growing in the neighbourhood, enumerating also the\r\ndifferent birds and sea-fowl, which are either natives or frequenters of\r\nthe locality.\r\n\r\nThe features most calculated by their singularity to attract the\r\nattention of the stranger on surveying this division of the county are\r\nthe moss-lands, the sand-hills, the mere at Marton, and the stunted\r\nappearance and inclination from the sea of those trees situated anywhere\r\nin the vicinity of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe great moss of the Fylde lies in the township of Marton, and extends\r\nsix miles from north to south, and about one mile from east to west. On\r\nexamining the structure of this moss, below the coarse herbage covering\r\nits surface, is discovered a substance called peat, brown and distinctly\r\nfibrous at its upper part, but becoming more and more compact as we\r\ndescend, until at the bottom is presented a firm, dark-coloured, or even\r\nblack mass, betraying less evidence, in some cases barely perceptible,\r\nof its fibrous formation. Beneath the peaty layer is a thick bed of\r\nclay, having imbedded in it, either partially or wholly, large trunks of\r\ntrees—oak, yew, fir, etc., which, by their frequency and arrangement,\r\nshow that at some period the extensive tract must have been a dense\r\nwoodland, but at what particular era it is impossible, with any degree\r\nof exactness, to determine. The disinterment, however, of certain Celtic\r\nrelics from the substance of the peat, which may be supposed to have\r\nbelonged to the aboriginal Britons of the section, inclines us to the\r\nopinion that the lower layers of the moss were formed, and consequently\r\nthe forest overthrown, anterior to the Roman occupation of our island,\r\nbut how long before that time it was standing, must remain purely a\r\nmatter of conjecture, unless some reliable proofs of its more precise\r\nantiquity are disclosed during operations in the turf. The manner in\r\nwhich the demolition of the forest was effected is also somewhat wrapt\r\nin obscurity, although it is probable that the noble trees of which it\r\nwas composed were overturned and uprooted by the fury of some wide-spread\r\ninundation or the violence of some terrific hurricane. The fearful\r\ndevastations, both or either of the elements here brought into action\r\ncan accomplish, are too well marked in the histories of other countries\r\nfor us to hesitate in ascribing to them the power of overthrowing, under\r\nsimilar turbulent conditions, even so substantial an obstruction as the\r\nforest must have been; but a careful study of the locality and of the\r\nseveral sudden incursions of the tide which have occurred during recent\r\nyears, leads to the belief that the sea was the chief destructive agent,\r\nand that the gale which hurled the raging volumes of water over the\r\nlow-lying lands at the south of Blackpool, and the then level wooded\r\ntract beyond, assisted only in the ruinous work. In support of such\r\na hypothesis may be instanced the flood of 1833, when a tide, only\r\nestimated to rise to a height of sixteen feet, but greatly swollen by\r\na furious storm from the south-west, burst over at that spot, swept\r\naway several dwelling-houses in its course, battered down the hedges,\r\nand laid waste the fields far into the surrounding country. Had this\r\ninundation occurred during the high spring tides, it is impossible to\r\nsay to what extent its ravages might have been carried, but the incident\r\nas it stands, being within the recollection of many still living, and\r\nby no means a solitary example of the usual direction taken by the\r\nstorm-driven waves, furnishes an apt illustration of the most natural\r\nway in which the downfall of the forest may have been accomplished. The\r\nRev. W. Thornber, who has bestowed much time and labour on the subject,\r\nsays:—“There are some facts that will go far to prove that these forests,\r\nonce standing on Marton Moss, were overthrown by an inundation of the\r\nsea, viz., every tree on the Moss, as well as the Hawes, lies in a\r\nsouth-eastern direction from the shore; and the bank, which appears\r\nto have been the extent of this irruption, commencing at the Royal\r\nHotel, runs exactly in the same direction. The shells, similar to those\r\ncollected on the shore, intermixed with wrack of the sea, which are found\r\nin abundance under the peat, also corroborate this supposition. Moreover\r\nthe tide is constantly depositing a marine silt similar to that which\r\nlies beneath the peat, and in some instances upon it.”\r\n\r\nThe wreck of such a vast number of trees would cause a great but gradual\r\nalteration in the surface of the ground. The masses of fallen timber,\r\nblocking up the streamlets and obstructing drainage, would create a more\r\nor less complete stagnation of water upon the land; the bark, branches,\r\nand leaves undergoing a process of decay would form the deepest layers\r\nof the peat; rank herbage and aquatic plants springing up and dying in\r\nendless succession, would form annual accumulations of matter, which in\r\ncourse of time would also be assimilated into peat, and in this manner\r\nthe moss overlaying the original clayey surface and burying the ancient\r\nforest, would grow step by step to its present dimensions. Again, each\r\nlayer of peat, as they were successively formed, would press upon those\r\nbeneath, so that the weight of its own increase would give firmness and\r\nsolidity to the substance of the moss. Thus we see that the whole secret\r\nof the creation or formation of the moss is simply a process of growth,\r\ndecay, and accumulation of certain vegetable products annually repeated.\r\nThe huge moss of Pilling and Rawcliffe owes its existence to similar\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe large mounds, or star-hills as they are called, which undulate the\r\ncoast line from Lytham to South-Shore, are composed simply and purely\r\nof sand, covered over with a coarse species of herb, bearing the name\r\nof star-grass. Similar eminences at one time occupied the whole of the\r\nmarine border of the Fylde, but in many places the encroaching tide has\r\nnot only annihilated the hills themselves, but even usurped their sites.\r\nThe town of Fleetwood is erected on a foundation of sand, and several\r\nextensive mounds of that nature exist in its vicinity. Below this light\r\nsuperficial substance, in some places very deep and thrown into its\r\nelevated forms by the long-continued action of the wind, is a subsoil\r\nresembling that found in other parts of the Fylde, and consisting of\r\na clayey loam and alluvial matter. The diminutive size of those trees\r\ngrowing near the coast is due both to the openness and bleakness of the\r\nsite, and the deleterious effects of the saline particles contained in\r\nthe air; whilst the peculiar leaning from the water of their branches,\r\nand in many instances their trunks, is caused by the mechanical action\r\nor pressure of the strong winds and sea breezes prevailing from the west\r\nduring three-fourths of the year.\r\n\r\nMarton Mere, situated in the township indicated by its name, was formerly\r\na lake of no inconsiderable extent, but drainage and the accumulation\r\nwithin its basin of sediment have reduced it to its present comparatively\r\nunimportant dimensions. Traces of the more extensive boundaries of the\r\nsheet of water in former days are still discernible along its banks,\r\nand at one time, it is stated, the wheel of a water-mill near to the\r\nvillage of Great Marton, was turned by a stream from the mere. The right\r\nof fishery in the lake, for such it was in the earlier periods, was the\r\nsubject of legal contest in the reign of Edward III., and in 1590 John\r\nSingleton, of Staining Hall, held the privilege.\r\n\r\nThere are few districts of similar area which can boast so many and\r\nsuch interesting varieties of the feathered tribes, either natives or\r\nvisitants, as the Fylde. Some of the rarest sea-fowl are occasionally\r\nseen along the coasts, while the fields and hedgerows abound with most\r\nof the melodious songsters of our island.

In the context it is\r\nnot intended to enter into a description of the different plants or of\r\nthe localities in which they may most commonly be found, but merely to\r\nenumerate some of the more important ones; and in the following list\r\nall those inhabitants of the district, which are likely to interest the\r\nstudent of Botany or lover of Nature, are arranged in their various\r\ngroups or

Thence winding past\r\nthe ancient port of Wardleys, the stream, much widened, flows north\r\nand a little inclined towards the west, until it reaches the harbour of\r\nFleetwood, situated at its mouth. From that seaport, the channel of the\r\nriver, unaltered in direction, lies for a distance of nearly two miles\r\nbetween the sand-banks of North Wharf and Bernard’s Wharf, and finally\r\nterminates in Morecambe Bay, meeting the well-defined bed of the Lune\r\nat right angles. The origins of the Wyre in the hills consist of two\r\nsmall rivulets, and the stream formed by their union is joined near\r\nScorton by the Grizedale Brook, whilst lower down, about two miles beyond\r\nthe town of Garstang, it receives the Calder, rising on the slopes of\r\nBleasdale. Before leaving the parish of Garstang, the Wyre is further\r\nincreased by the brook springing from Fairsnape and Parlick Pike, which\r\npasses Claughton and Myerscough, not far from where it receives a small\r\ntributary from the south. At Skippool also a brook, the Skipton, which\r\nsprings from the mere and marshy grounds of Marton Moss, pours its\r\ncontents into the river.\r\n\r\nThe Wyre is crossed at Garstang by the aqueduct of the Preston,\r\nLancaster, and Kendal canal, and at St. Michael’s, near the Church, it is\r\nspanned by a rather narrow but substantial stone bridge. For a distance\r\nof about six miles in the neighbourhood of the latter place the stream\r\nis enclosed within artificial banks, which in some parts have a descent\r\nof thirty feet. In spite of these precautions, however, high floods\r\noccasionally occur, when the swollen waters burst over the embankments\r\nand inundate the adjoining country. At Cart Ford there is a wooden\r\nstructure of very limited width, connecting the opposing banks; and a few\r\nmiles further down is the Shard Bridge, built of iron, and presenting\r\na neat and elegant appearance. The river at that spot is 500 yards in\r\nbreadth, and until the erection of the bridge in 1864, was crossed by\r\nmeans of a ferry-boat, or forded at low water by carts and conveyances.\r\nThe ancient name of this ford was Ald-wath, and we learn from the\r\nfollowing entry in the diary of Thomas Tyldesley, that in 1713 the charge\r\nfor crossing by boat was 6d. each journey:—“September 14, 1713.—Went\r\nafter dinr. to ffox Hall; pd. 6d. ffor boating att Sharde; saw ye ferry\r\nman carry out of ye boat a Scot and his pack, a sight I never saw beffor,\r\nbeeing 56 years off age.”\r\n\r\nAbout three hundred years since the venerable Harrison described the\r\nprincipal rivers of Lancashire, and from his writings at that time we\r\nquote as under:—\r\n\r\n  “The Wire ryseth eight or ten miles from Garstan, out of an hill\r\n  in Wiresdale, from whence it runneth by Shireshed chappell, and\r\n  then going by Wadland, Grenelaw Castle (which belongeth to the\r\n  erle of Darbie), Garstan and Kyrkeland hall, it first receiveth\r\n  the seconde Calder, that commeth down by Edmersey chappell,\r\n  then another chanel increased with sundrie waters, the first\r\n  water is called Plympton brooke. It riseth south of Gosner, and\r\n  commeth by Craweforde hall, and eare long receyving the Barton\r\n  becke, it proceedeth forward till it joyneth with the Brooke\r\n  rill that commeth from Bowland Forest by Claughton hall, where\r\n  M. Brokehales doth live, and so throw Mersco forest. After this\r\n  confluence the Plime or Plimton water meeteth with the Calder,\r\n  and then with the Wire, which passeth forth to Michael church and\r\n  the Rawcliffes, and above Thorneton crosseth the Skipton, that\r\n  goeth by Potton, then into the Wire rode, and finally into the\r\n  sea, according to his nature.”\r\n\r\nDrayton also has left the subjoined versified account of the Wyre, and\r\nas in addition to its poetic merit, it possesses the virtue of being a\r\nfaithful description, we need not apologise for giving it unabridged:—\r\n\r\n  “Arising but a rill at first from Wyersdale’s lap,\r\n  Yet still receiving all her strength from her full mother’s pap,\r\n  As downe to seaward she her serious course doth ply,\r\n  Takes Calder coming in, to beare her company,\r\n  From Woolscrag’s cliffy foot, a hill to her at hand,\r\n  By that fayre forest knowne, within her Verge to stand.\r\n  So Bowland from her breast sends Brock her to attend,\r\n  As she a Forest is, so likewise doth she send\r\n  Her child, on Wyresdale Flood, the dainty Wyre to wayte,\r\n  With her assisting Rills, when Wyre is once repleat;\r\n  She in her crooked course to Seaward softly glides,\r\n  Where Pellin’s mighty Mosse, and Merton’s on her sides\r\n  Their boggy breasts outlay, and Skipton down doth crawle\r\n  To entertain this Wyre, attained to her fall.”[56]\r\n\r\nWhite Hall, (formerly Upper Rawcliffe Hall,) Rawcliffe Hall, and Mains\r\nHall, each of which will claim our attention more particularly hereafter,\r\nare seated on the banks of the Wyre, so also is the ancient house of\r\nPreesall-with-Hackensall, and although not properly comprised within the\r\nlimits of this work, it has a right from its association with the river,\r\nto some description—a right the more readily conceded when it is known\r\nthat in point of antiquity and interest, the hall and domain are well\r\ndeserving of our consideration. The site of the mansion is a little\r\nremoved from the brink of the stream, and almost directly opposite the\r\nsouthern extremity of Fleetwood. The present building is of considerable\r\nage, having been erected by Richard Fleetwood, of Rossall, in 1656, as\r\nindicated by an inscription over the main entrance, but there can be\r\nno question that the origin of its predecessor was co-eval, at least,\r\nwith the grant of the manor by King John, when earl of Moreton, to\r\nGeoffrey, the Crossbowman, who, with his descendants, resided there. The\r\nwhole of the large estate remained in the family of Geoffrey until the\r\nfifteenth century, when it was conveyed in marriage to James Pickering,\r\nof Layton, by Agnes, the sole offspring and heiress of the last male\r\nHackensall, the title assumed, according to custom, by the Crossbowman.\r\nJames Pickering left at his decease four daughters, co-heiresses, and\r\nmarried to Richard Butler, of Rawcliffe, Thomas Aglionby, Nicholas\r\nAglionby, and James Leybourne, each of whom inherited one-fourth of the\r\nmanor in right of his wife. In 1639 Sir Paul Fleetwood, of Rossall,\r\nheld three-fourths of Hackensall, whilst the remaining quarter had\r\ndescended to Henry Butler. Under the will of Richard Fleetwood, the\r\nre-erector of the hall, at that time occupied by his brother Francis,\r\nthe three-fourths just named were sold by his trustees, being purchased,\r\nin part, for the Hornbys, of Poulton. Geoffrey Hornby, vicar of Winwick,\r\nand Robert Loxham, vicar of Poulton, held between them three-quarters of\r\nthe manor in 1729, and William Elletson, of Parrox Hall, had possession\r\nof the other fourth, which is now the hereditary estate of Daniel Hope\r\nElletson, esq., justice of the peace, residing at the same seat. At the\r\nend of the last century the Hornbys disposed of their share to John\r\nBourne, gentleman, of Stalmine, from whom it descended to his second\r\nson, James Bourne, of Stalmine, and from him to his nephews, Thomas,\r\nJames, and Peter, successively. The other portion of the manorial rights\r\nof the three-fourths was subsequently acquired by the last-surviving\r\nnephew, Peter Bourne, of Heathfield and Liverpool. Peter Bourne, esq.,\r\nof Hackensall, married Margaret, the only daughter of James Drinkwater,\r\nesq., of Bent, in Lancashire, and left issue James, who is the present\r\nlord of three-quarters of the manor, and owner of the ancient Hall. James\r\nBourne, esq., M.P., of Hackensall, and of Heathfield, near Liverpool,\r\nis Col.-Comdt. of the Royal Lancashire regiment of Militia Artillery, a\r\ndeputy-lieutenant, and a justice of the peace of this county. Colonel\r\nBourne has recently restored the old manor house, but in such a way\r\nas to preserve, and not obliterate, its links with a bygone age. The\r\nantique fire-places, one of which was protected by a massive arch of\r\nstone sweeping across the whole width of the room, have been renewed as\r\nbefore, and although the main doorway has been removed to another part\r\nof the building, the stone with the initials F. R. A., being those of\r\nRichard Fleetwood and Anne, his wife, has been reinstated in its original\r\nposition above the newly-constructed lintel. Rumour affirms that during\r\ncertain alterations two or three skeletons, supposed to be those of\r\nfemales, were found bricked up in a narrow chamber in one of the walls,\r\nand whilst confirming the discovery of a long secret recess, we dare not\r\nventure, for the evidence is somewhat contradictory, to hold ourselves\r\nresponsible for the strict accuracy of the other part of the story, which\r\nsuggests the enactment of a scene of revolting cruelty, similar to that\r\nintroduced by Sir Walter Scott in the following lines:—\r\n\r\n  “Yet well the luckless wretch might shriek,\r\n  Well might her paleness terror speak!\r\n  For there was seen in that dark wall,\r\n  Two niches, narrow, deep, and tall.\r\n  Who enters at such grisly door\r\n  Shall ne’er I wean find exit more.\r\n  In each a slender meal was laid\r\n  Of roots, of water, and of bread.\r\n  ...\r\n  Hewn stones and mortar were display’d,\r\n  And building tools in order laid.”\r\n\r\nThe moat has now been nearly filled up, but its extent and direction\r\ncan still be pointed out. There are no indications of a chapel having\r\nformerly constituted part of the residential building, but several years\r\nsince, when an outhouse was destroyed, at a short distance, about twenty\r\nyards, two gravestones were discovered, and it is probable that they\r\nwere somewhere near, if not actually on the site of, the private chapel\r\nor oratory. One of the stones was broken up immediately, and the other\r\nis practically illegible, although three or four words, still preserved,\r\nprove that the inscription has not been in raised characters. The rights\r\nto wreckage, etc. on the foreshore of the manor have pertained to the\r\nlords of Hackensall from time immemorial, and still continue to be held\r\nand exercised as portion of the lordship.\r\n\r\nAnterior to the establishment of a port at Fleetwood, or more correctly\r\nspeaking, to the foundation of a town and the erection of wharfage, etc.,\r\non the warren forming the western boundary of Wyre estuary, Wardleys\r\nand Skippool, almost facing each other, were the harbours to which all\r\ncommercial traffic on the river was directed. Ships of considerable\r\nsize, freighted with cargoes of various sorts, found their way to\r\nthose secluded havens, and even within the last few years, during high\r\ntides, vessels laden with grain have been berthed and unloaded in the\r\nnarrow creek leading from Skippool bay, while bags of guano have often\r\nterminated their sea-voyages at Wardleys. A solitary warehouse, however,\r\nundated, but bearing on its battered exterior and decaying timbers the\r\nunmistakable stamp of time, is, at the present day, almost the only\r\nremaining witness to the former pretentions of the first named place. At\r\nWardleys, three or four spacious warehouses, in a similarly dilapidated\r\ncondition and now partially converted into shippons, the remainder being\r\nunused except as lumber-rooms or temporary storehouses for guano or some\r\nlocal agricultural produce, together with a stone wharf, are evidences of\r\na fair amount of business having once been carried on at that little port.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Baines described Wardleys as “a small seaport on the river\r\nWyre, where vessels of 300 tons register may discharge their burdens,\r\nsituated in the township of Stalmine with Stainall, in the hundred of\r\nAmounderness;” but in the year 1708 customs were established at Poulton\r\nin connection with Wardleys and Skippool. Nor should we be justified\r\nin limiting the antiquity of the ports to that date, for as early as\r\n1590-1600, William and James Blackburne, of Thistleton, carried on an\r\nextensive trade with Russia, and there can be no doubt that their cargoes\r\nof merchandise, most likely flax and tallow, were landed on the banks of\r\nthe Wyre at those ancient harbours. The father of the above merchants was\r\nthe first of the family to take up his residence in this neighbourhood,\r\nand appears to have settled at Garstang, about 1550, from Yorkshire. That\r\nthe commercial dealings of the partners were both large and successful is\r\nshown in the property acquired by William Blackburne, the elder brother,\r\nwho purchased Newton, lands in Thistleton, and several other estates of\r\nconsiderable magnitude in the Fylde, all of which he bequeathed to his\r\nson and heir, Richard. Richard Blackburne married Jane, the daughter of\r\nJohn Aynesworth, of Newton, and had issue John of Eccleston; Richard, of\r\nGoosnargh; Thomas, of Orford and Newton; Edward, of Stockenbridge, near\r\nSt. Michael’s-on-Wyre; Robert, who was suspected of being implicated\r\nin the Gunpowder Plot, but acquitted, the evidence being insufficient;\r\nAnnie, who married—Nickson; and Elizabeth, the wife of William Standish.\r\nWhen the Singletons of Staining became extinct, the Hall and estate of\r\nthat name passed to a William Blackburne, as heir-at-law, and there is\r\ngreat probability that he was a descendant of one of the sons of Richard\r\nBlackburne of Thistleton, Newton, etc.—most likely of John Blackburn, of\r\nEccleston.\r\n\r\nDuring the years more immediately previous to the opening of the new port\r\nat the mouth of the river, a great many large ships from America, laden\r\nwith timber, and brigs from Russia, with flax and tallow, were discharged\r\nat Wardleys. A three masted vessel, for the foreign trade, was also\r\nconstructed in the ship-yard attached to that place, but as far as can\r\nbe learnt this was the only vessel of equal dimensions ever built there,\r\nrepairs being the chief occupation of the workpeople.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the officers connected with the Custom House at Poulton, were\r\nstationed at Knot End, opposite the Warren, living in the small cottage\r\nstanding near the shore, in order to board the different craft as they\r\nentered the river, and pilot them up the stream to Wardleys. A large\r\nhotel is situated behind the site of the old ship-yard, and during the\r\nsummer months is generally well patronised by visitors, to whom, as\r\nwell as to the pleasure-parties arriving by water from Fleetwood, and\r\nby road from Blackpool, the hamlet is now mainly indebted for support.\r\nSome large mussels, the “Mytili angulosi,” but known amongst the natives\r\nof those parts as “Hambleton hookings,” were found formerly in large\r\nquantities a little lower down the river, but lately specimens of this\r\nfine shell-fish have been growing much scarcer. Dr. Leigh, in his\r\nNatural History of our county, informs us that pearls have frequently\r\nbeen discovered enclosed within the shells of these molluscs, and also\r\nthat their popular name arises from the manner in which they are taken,\r\nthe feat being accomplished “by plucking them from their Skeers, or\r\nBeds, with Hooks.” The tidal estuary of the Wyre embraces an area of\r\nthree miles by two, and it is near to its termination that the port and\r\ntown of Fleetwood are situated. Our purpose now is not to enter into a\r\ndescription of the harbour, which will be found in the chapter specially\r\ndevoted to the seaport itself, but a few words as to the advantages\r\nderived from the nature of the river’s current and its bed, will not be\r\nout of place. Captain Denham, R.N., F.R.S., after inspecting the site\r\nof the proposed port on behalf of the promoters, issued a report in the\r\nmonth of January, 1840, and amongst other things, stated that during the\r\nfirst half of the ebb-tide, a reflux of backwater was produced which\r\ndipped with such a powerful under-scour as to preserve a natural basin,\r\ncapable of riding ships of eighteen or twenty feet draught, at low water,\r\nspring tides; also that the anchorage ground, both within and without\r\nthe harbour, was excellent. These facts alone seemed sufficient to\r\nwarrant the gallant officer’s prediction that the undertaking would be\r\nsuccessful and remunerative, but when in addition it is called to mind,\r\nthat “as easy and safe as Wyre water” had for long been a proverb amongst\r\nthe mariners of our coast, and that the harbour was, and is, perfectly\r\nsheltered from all winds, as well as connected with a railway terminus\r\nwhich communicates with Preston, Manchester, etc., we are astonished that\r\ncomparatively so little encouragement has been given to it, and that now,\r\nthirty-five years from the date of this survey, the first dock is only\r\napproaching completion.\r\n\r\nThe river Wyre is plentifully supplied with fish of various sorts; in\r\nthe higher parts of the stream trout and smelts may be found, whilst\r\nthe lower portion and estuary contain codling, flounders, sea-perch,\r\nconger, sand eels, and occasionally salmon. The earliest enactments with\r\nregard to the fisheries connected with the last-named fish related to the\r\nWyre, Ribble, and other rivers of Lancashire. In 1389, during the reign\r\nof Richard II., a law, which arranged the times and seasons when the\r\nfisheries in these rivers should be closed, and other matters affecting\r\nthem, was passed and brought into force, being the first regulation of\r\nits kind.\r\n\r\nThe Ribble is associated with the Fylde only in so much as its tidal\r\nestuary is concerned, which forms the southern boundary of the district.\r\nSince 1837 great alterations have been effected in the channel of the\r\nriver by the Ribble Navigation Improvement Company. The stream for the\r\nlarger portion of its extent from Preston to the Naze Point has been\r\nconfined within stone embankments, and its bed considerably deepened by\r\ndredging. During the progress of these improvements wide tracts of land\r\nhave been reclaimed both north and south of the current. From Freckleton\r\nthe river rapidly widens as it approaches the sea, so that a direct\r\nline drawn from Lytham to Southport across its mouth would pass over a\r\ndistance of seven or eight miles. The channel here is shallow, while the\r\nsands on each side are flat and extensive, and midway in the estuary, at\r\nits lowest part, lies the far-famed Horse-bank, which divides the stream\r\ninto a north and south current, scarcely discernible, however, after the\r\ntide has risen above the level of the bank. About one mile from the town\r\nof Lytham, in the direction of Preston, is a pool of moderate dimensions,\r\nhaving an open communication with the river, and formed into a small\r\nharbour or dock for yachts and vessels connected with the coasting trade.\r\nIn the bed of the river, a little higher up than that locality, trunks of\r\nlarge trees are occasionally observed at low water, and many such remains\r\nof a once noble forest, which is believed to have extended from near the\r\nWelsh coast as far even as Morecambe, have been raised at different times\r\nduring the operation of dredging.\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions of the Ribble, its source, course, and\r\ntributaries, were written, respectively, by the ancient topographer\r\nHarrison, and the poet Drayton, whose accounts of the Wyre have been\r\npreviously quoted:—\r\n\r\n  “The Rybell, a river verie rich of Salmon and Lampreie, dooth\r\n  in manner inviron Preston in Andernesse, and it riseth neere to\r\n  Ribbesdale above Gisburne. It goeth from thence to Sawley or\r\n  Salley, Chatburne, Woodington, Clitherow Castell, and beneath\r\n  Mitton meeteth with the Odder, which ryseth not farre from the\r\n  Cross of Grete in Yorkshire, and going thence to Shilburne,\r\n  Newton, Radholme parke, and Stony hirst, it falleth ere long into\r\n  Ribble water. From thence the Ribble hath not gone farre, but it\r\n  meeteth with the Calder. Thys brooke ryseth above Holme Church,\r\n  goeth by Townley and Burneley (where it receiveth a trifeling\r\n  rill), thence to Higham, and ere long crossing one water that\r\n  cometh from Wicoler, by Colne, and another by and by named Pidle\r\n  brooke that runneth by Newechurch, in the Pidle: it meeteth with\r\n  ye Calder, which passeth forth to Padiam, and thence (receyving\r\n  a becke on the other side) it runneth on to Altham, and so to\r\n  Martholme, where the Henburne brooke doth joyn with all, that\r\n  goeth by Alkington chappell, Dunkinhalge, Rishton, and so into\r\n  ye Calder as I have sayde before. The Calder therefore being\r\n  thus inlarged, runneth forth to Reade (where M. Noell dwelleth),\r\n  to Whalley, and soon after into Ribell, that goeth from this\r\n  confluence to Salisbury hall, Ribchester, Osbaston, Sambury,\r\n  Keuerden, Law, Ribles bridge, and then taketh in the Darwent,\r\n  before it goeth by Pontwarth or Pentworth into the sea. The\r\n  Darwent devideth Leland shire from Andernesse,[57] and it ryseth\r\n  by east above Darwent Chappell, and soone after uniting it selfe\r\n  with the Blackeburne, and Rodlesworthe water it goeth thorowe\r\n  Howghton Parke, by Howghton towne, to Walton hall, and so into\r\n  the Ribell. As for the Sannocke brooke, it ryseth somewhat above\r\n  Longridge Chappell, goeth to Broughton towne, Cotham, Lee hall,\r\n  and so into Ribell.”\r\n\r\n  “From Penigent’s proud foot as from my source I slide,\r\n  That mountain, my proud sire, in height of all his pride,\r\n  Takes pleasure in my course as in his first-born flood,\r\n  And Ingleborrough too, of that Olympian brood,\r\n  And Pendle, of the north, the highest hill that be,\r\n  Do wistly me behold, and are beheld of me.\r\n  These mountains make me proud, to gaze on me that stand,\r\n  So Longridge, once arrived on the Lancastrian strand,\r\n  Salutes me, and with smiles me to his soil invites,\r\n  So have I many a flood that forward me excites,\r\n  As Hodder that from Home attends me from my spring,\r\n  Then Calder, coming down from Blackstonedge doth bring\r\n  Me easily on my way to Preston, the greatest town\r\n  Wherewith my banks are blest, where, at my going down,\r\n  Clear Darwen on along me to the sea doth drive,\r\n  And in my spacious fall no sooner I arrive,\r\n  But Savock to the north from Longridge making way\r\n  To this my greatness adds, when in my ample bay,\r\n  Swart Dulas coming in from Wigan, with her aids,\r\n  Short Taud and Dartow small, two little country maids,\r\n  In these low watery lands and moory mosses bred,\r\n  Do see me safely laid in mighty Neptune’s bed,\r\n  And cutting in my course, even through the heart\r\n  Of this renowned shire, so equally it part,\r\n  As nature should have said, lo! thus I meant to do,\r\n  This flood divides this shire, thus equally in two.”\r\n\r\nThe beautiful scenery and historical associations of the Ribble render\r\nit the most interesting and charming of the several rivers which water\r\nthe county of Lancaster. The quietude of its fair valley has on more than\r\none occasion been rudely broken by the clash of arms, and students of our\r\ncountry’s history will readily call to mind that calamitous day to the\r\nDuke of Hamilton, when Cromwell routed the Highlanders under his command,\r\nnear Preston,\r\n\r\n  “And Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrued.”\r\n\r\nOther instances of war-like doings along the banks of this river might\r\nbe recounted, but as the neighbourhoods in which they occurred are\r\nnot enclosed within the Fylde boundaries, we are perforce obliged to\r\nexclude them from this volume, and must refer those of our readers who\r\nare anxious to learn more both of them and of the river itself to other\r\nsources for the required information. The chief fish of the Ribble is\r\nof course its salmon, but in addition the estuary contains numbers of\r\nflounders and other varieties of the finny tribes similar to those found\r\nin the tidal portion of the Wyre. During the sixteenth century sturgeons\r\nseem to have been captured occasionally in the Ribble, and amongst the\r\nrecords of the duchy in 1536, there is a complaint that when “one certain\r\nsturgeon was found within the township of Warton and seized for the use\r\nof the King (who held the right of fishery there), and laid up in a house\r\nin Warton, one Christopher Bone, of Warton, and James Bradʳton, of the\r\nley, with divers riotous persons, about the 6th of May last, did then and\r\nthere take out of the said house the said sturgeon, and the said Bone\r\nhath at divers times and in like manner taken sturgeons and porpoises to\r\nhis own use and the injury of his majesty.”[58]\r\n\r\nAs such a small part, and that far from the most important, of Ribble\r\nstream is really connected with the Fylde, and as it is not our intention\r\nto trespass beyond the limits of that district,—at least not knowingly,\r\nand the margin in the present instance is so clearly defined that no\r\nexcuse could be offered for overstepping it,—we are compelled to content\r\nourselves with this brief account, leaving much unsaid that is of\r\nconsiderable historical and general interest.\r\n\r\nTHE SEA which washes over the westerly shore of the Fylde forms part\r\nof St. George’s Channel or the Irish Sea, whilst the narrow northern\r\nboundary of the same district is limited by the waters of Morecambe Bay.\r\nThe main peculiarities to be noticed along the extensive line of this\r\ncoast swept over by the billows of the Irish Sea, are the almost entire\r\nabsence of seaweeds and the levelness of the sands; indeed, so gentle is\r\nthe slope of the latter that its average declivity has been estimated\r\nat no more than one foot in every fifty yards, and to the flatness of\r\nthis surface it is due that the beach is in a very great measure freed\r\nfrom putrifying heaps of fish and seaweed, for the rising tides glide\r\nwith such swiftness over the level sandy beds that most driftmatters\r\nand impurities are left behind in the depths beyond low water mark. An\r\nanalysis, made by Dr. Schweitzer, of the waters of the English coast,\r\nfurnishes the following result:—\r\n\r\n                                       No. of grains.\r\n  Water                                   964.74\r\n  Chloride of Sodium (Table salt)          27.06\r\n  Chloride of Magnesium                     3.67\r\n  Sulphate of Magnesia (Epsom Salts)        2.30\r\n  Sulphate of Lime                          1.40\r\n  Carbonate of Lime                         0.03\r\n  Carbonate of Magnesia              ⎫\r\n  Carbonic Acid                      ⎪\r\n  Potash                             ⎬    Traces\r\n  Iodine                             ⎪\r\n  Extractive matter                  ⎪\r\n  Bromide of Magnesium               ⎭\r\n                                      ----------\r\n                                        1,000\r\n\r\nThere are few, we imagine, who have not at one time or another admired\r\nthe luminous appearance of the sea on certain evenings. This astonishing\r\nand beautiful phenomenon is brought about by the presence in the water\r\nof myriads of tiny beings, called Noctilucæ, which possess the power of\r\nemitting a phosphorescent light, and seemingly convert the bursting waves\r\ninto masses of liquid fire. The immense expanse of sea spreading out from\r\nthe westerly border of the Fylde has, independently of its association\r\nwith the Gulph Stream, a marked influence in equalising the climate and\r\naverting those sudden and extreme degrees of heat and cold commonly\r\nexperienced inland. The atmosphere over water does not undergo such rapid\r\nalterations in its temperature as that over land, and hence it happens\r\nthat localities situated near the coast are cooler in summer and warmer\r\nin winter than others far removed from its vicinity. Most people will\r\nhave observed that after a calm sunny day at the seaside, a breeze from\r\nthe land invariably arises after sunset, due to the fact that the air\r\nover the earth being cooled and condensed much sooner than that over the\r\nsea, the heavier body of atmosphere endeavours to displace the warmer and\r\nlighter one. A gentle evaporation is daily taking place from the surface\r\nof the sea, by which the air becomes loaded with moisture, remaining\r\nsuspended until the coolness of evening sets in, when it is deposited\r\non the ground as dew. The water thus obtained from the deep is not pure\r\nbrine, as might at first sight appear, but is freed from its salts by\r\nthe process of natural distillation which has been undergone. Similar\r\nevaporation also goes on from the surfaces of the Ribble and Wyre, and it\r\nis doubtless chiefly owing to the Fylde being almost environed by water,\r\nconstantly disseminating dew, that its fecundity is not only so great,\r\nbut also so constant.

resided at Rossall Hall for a period of more than half\r\na century, and by intermarriage became connected with the Westbys of\r\nMowbreck, the Heskeths of Mains, and the Gillows of Bryning, sprang\r\nfrom the county of Stafford. At the time of the Protestant Reformation,\r\nGeorge Allen, of Brookhouse, in the division just mentioned, held a long\r\nlease of the Grange and Hall of Rossall from a kinsman of his family,\r\none of the abbots of Deulacres, a Staffordshire monastery, to which the\r\nestate had been granted by King John. George Allen at his death left one\r\nson, John, who resided at the Hall, and subsequently married Jane, the\r\nsister of Thomas Lister, of Arnold Biggin, in Yorkshire. The offspring\r\nof this marriage were Richard, William, Gabriel, George, who espoused\r\nElizabeth, the daughter of William Westby, of Mowbreck; Mary, afterwards\r\nthe wife of Thomas Worthington, of Blainscow; Elizabeth, subsequently\r\nthe wife of William Hesketh, of Mains Hall; and Anne, who married George\r\nGillow, of Bryning. Richard Allen, of Rossall Hall, the eldest son, left\r\nat his demise a widow with three daughters, named respectively, Helen,\r\nCatherine, and Mary, who were deprived of their possessions and rights\r\nin the Grange in the year 1583 by Edmund Fleetwood, whose father had\r\npurchased the reversion of the lease from Henry VIII., at the time when\r\nthe larger monastic institutions were dissolved in England. The widow\r\nand her daughters fled to Rheims to escape further persecution, where\r\nthey were hospitably received by their near relative, Cardinal William\r\nAllen, who interested the princely family of Guise in their behalf and so\r\nobtained for them the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nWilliam Allen, the second son of John Allen, of Rossall Hall, was born\r\nin 1532, and at the early age of fifteen entered Oriel College, Oxford,\r\nunder the tutorship of Morgan Philips, perhaps the most eminent logician\r\nof his day. Three years later he was elected to a fellowship. Upon the\r\naccession of Mary he entered the church, and in 1556 was made principal\r\nof St. Mary’s Hall, acting as Proctor for the two succeeding years. In\r\n1558 he was created canon of York, but on the accession of Elizabeth, he\r\nrefused the Protestant oaths, was deprived of his fellowship, and, in\r\n1560, retired to Louvaine, where he wrote his first work, entitled “A\r\nDefence of the Doctrine of Catholics, concerning Purgatory and Prayers\r\nfor the Dead,” in answer to an attack on those dogmas by Bishop Jewell.\r\nIn 1565, the year in which this publication appeared and fermented great\r\nexcitement both here and abroad, William Allen determined, in spite of\r\nthe extreme dangers of such an act, to visit his native country, more\r\nespecially the home of his fathers at Rossall. Religious zeal prevented\r\nhis active spirit from being long at rest; after residing in England\r\nabout three years and visiting different parts of Lancashire, seeking\r\nconverts to his creed, he was obliged to secrete himself from the eye of\r\nthe law amongst his friends, Layton Hall and Mains Hall being two of his\r\nhiding places, until a suitable opportunity occurred for escaping over\r\nto the continent. Flanders was his destination, and from there he went\r\nto Mechlin, afterwards taking up his abode at Douai, where he obtained a\r\ndoctor’s degree, and established an English seminary. This college, we\r\nlearn from the “Mem: Miss: Priests: Ed. 1741,” was founded in 1568 “to\r\ntrain up English scholars in virtue and learning, and to qualify them\r\nto labour in the vineyard of the Lord, on their return to their native\r\ncountry; it was the first college in the Christian world, instituted\r\naccording to the model given by the council of Trent.”\r\n\r\nWhilst engaged at the above scholastic institution, William Allen was\r\nappointed canon of Cambray; subsequently when the English council\r\napplied to the ruling powers of the Spanish Netherlands to suppress the\r\ncollege of Douai, the Doctor and his assistants were received under the\r\nprotection of the house of Guise. Afterwards Doctor Allen, on being\r\nappointed canon of Rheims, established another seminary in that city. At\r\nthat time perhaps no one was more admired and revered by the Catholic\r\nparty abroad, and detested by the Protestant subjects of England, than\r\nWilliam Allen. He was even accused by his countrymen at home of having\r\ntraitorously instigated Philip II. of Spain, to attempt the invasion and\r\nconquest of England, and although he strenuously denied any agency in\r\nthat matter, it is certain that after the defeat of the Armada, he wrote\r\na defence of Sir William Stanley and Sir Rowland York, who had assisted\r\nthe enemy. In 1587, he was made cardinal of St. Martin in Montibus by\r\nPope Sectus V., and a little later was presented by the king of Spain\r\nto a rich abbey in Naples with promises of still higher preferment. In\r\n1588 he published the “Declaration of the Sentence of Sixtus the Fifth,”\r\nwhich was directed against the government of the British queen, whom he\r\ndeclared an usurper, obstinate and impenitent, and for these reasons to\r\nbe deprived. As an appendix to the work he issued shortly afterwards an\r\n“Admonition to the Nobility and People of England and Ireland,” in which\r\nhe pronounced the queen an illegitimate daughter of Henry VIII. Although\r\nthe effect of these publications on the English nation was not, as he\r\nhoped, to arouse the people to open rebellion, or in any way to advance\r\nthe Catholic cause, the efforts of the cardinal were so far appreciated\r\nby the king of Spain that he promoted him to the archbishopric of\r\nMechlin. He lived at Rome during the remainder of his life in great\r\nluxury and magnificence. On October 6th, 1594, this remarkable man\r\nexpired at his palace, in the 63rd year of his age, and was buried with\r\ngreat pomp at the English church of the Holy Trinity in the ancient\r\nimperial city.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTLER OF RAWCLIFFE HALL.\r\n\r\nThe name of Butler, or as it was formerly written Botiler, belonged to an\r\noffice in existence in earlier times, and was first assumed by Theobald\r\nWalter, who married Maud, the sister of Thomas à Becket, on being\r\nappointed _Butler_ of Ireland.\r\n\r\nTheobald Walter-Botiler gave to his relative Richard Pincerna, or\r\nBotiler, as the family was afterwards called, the whole of Out Rawcliffe\r\nand one carucate of land in Staynole. This gentleman was the founder\r\nof that branch of the Butlers which was established at Rawcliffe Hall\r\nfor so many generations. Sir Richard Botiler, of Rawcliffe, married\r\nAlicia, in 1281, the daughter of William de Carleton, and thus obtained\r\nthe manor of Inskip. He had issue—William, Henry, Richard, Edmund, and\r\nGalfrid. Richard Botiler, the third son, who had some possessions in\r\nMarton, left at his death one son, also named Richard, who was living\r\nin 1323, and became the progenitor of the Butlers of Kirkland. William,\r\nthe eldest son, espoused Johanna de Sifewast, a widow, by whom he had\r\nNicholas de Botiler, who was alive in 1322, and had issue by his wife\r\nOlivia, one son, William Botiler, living in 1390. William Botiler had\r\nthree children—John, Richard, and Eleanor. John Botiler was created a\r\nknight, and in 1393-4-5 was High Sheriff of the county of Lancaster. Sir\r\nJohn Botiler left at his death, in 1404, three sons and one daughter,\r\nthe offspring of his marriage with Isabella, his second wife, who was\r\nthe widow of Sir John Butler, of Bewsey. Nicholas, the eldest son,\r\nwas also twice married, and had issue by his first wife, Margeria,\r\nthe daughter of Sir Richard Kirkeby,—John and Isabella Botiler. John\r\nBotiler espoused, in 1448, Elizabeth, the daughter of William Botiler,\r\nof Warrington, and had issue—Nicholas and Elizabeth Botiler. Nicholas\r\nBotiler married Alice, the daughter of Sir Thomas Radcliffe, knt., and\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest son John Botiler, who subsequently espoused\r\nElizabeth, the daughter and heiress of Sir John Lawrence, knt., and had\r\nissue—William, James, Richard, and Robert Botiler. James Botiler, the\r\nsecond son, inherited the estates, most probably owing to the death of\r\nWilliam, his elder brother, and married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir\r\nThomas Molyneux, knt., of Larbrick Hall. James Botiler, or Butler, was\r\nliving in 1500, but died shortly afterwards, leaving two sons and two\r\ndaughters—John, Nicholas, Isabella, and Elizabeth. John, the elder son,\r\nhad issue four daughters, whilst Nicholas, the second son, had issue by\r\nhis first wife, the daughter of Richard Bold, of Bold, two sons, Richard\r\nand Henry, and by his second wife, Isabel, the daughter and co-heiress of\r\nJohn Clayton, of Clayton, one daughter, who died in 1606. Richard Butler\r\nmarried Agnes, the daughter of Sir Richard Houghton, knt., but having no\r\noffspring, the estates of Rawcliffe passed to William Butler, the eldest\r\nson of his younger brother, Henry Butler, somewhere about 1627. William\r\nButler espoused Elizabeth, the daughter of Cuthbert Clifton, of Westby,\r\nby whom he had one son, Henry, who was thrice married, and had numerous\r\noffspring. Richard, the eldest son of Henry Butler by his first wife,\r\nDorothy, the daughter of Henry Stanley, of Bickerstaffe, died before his\r\nfather, but left several sons, one of whom, also named Richard, succeeded\r\nto the Rawcliffe property, and was thirty-two years of age in 1664;\r\nanother, Nicholas, was a colonel in the time of Charles I.; and another,\r\nJohn, was a citizen of London. Richard Butler espoused Katherine, the\r\ndaughter of Thomas Carus, of Halton, by whom he had a large family, the\r\neldest of which, Henry, was six years of age in 1664. Henry Butler, of\r\nRawcliffe, espoused as his first wife, Katherine, the granddaughter, and\r\nsubsequently heiress, of Sir John Girlington, knt., of Thurland Castle,\r\nand had issue—Richard, Christopher, Philip, Mary, and Katherine. Henry\r\nButler, and Richard, his eldest son, took part with the Pretender in\r\nthe rebellion of 1715, and for this piece of disaffection their estates\r\nwere confiscated by the crown, and afterwards sold. Henry Butler made\r\nhis escape over to France, but Richard was seized, tried, and condemned\r\nto death. He died in prison, however, in 1716, before the time appointed\r\nfor his sentence to be carried out, leaving an only child, Catherine, by\r\nhis wife, Mary, the daughter of Henry Curwen, of Workington, who married\r\nEdward Markham, of Ollarton, in the county of Nottingham, and died a\r\nminor without issue. Henry Butler lived in the Isle of Man for several\r\nyears, and espoused Elizabeth Butler, of Kirkland, his third wife, but\r\nhad no further issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIFTON OF CLIFTON, WESTBY, AND LYTHAM.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Cliftons, whose present seat is Lytham Hall, has been\r\nassociated with the Fylde for many centuries. The earliest ancestor of\r\nwhom there exists any authentic record, was Sir William de Clyfton, who\r\nlived in the time of William II., surnamed Rufus, and during the last\r\nyear of that monarch’s reign, A.D. 1100, gave certain lands in Salwick\r\nto his son William upon his marriage. In 1258 a namesake and descendant\r\nof this William de Clyfton held ten carucates of land in Amounderness,\r\nand was a collector of aids for the county of Lancaster. His son Gilbert\r\nde Clyfton was lord of the manors of Clifton, Westby, Fylde-Plumpton,\r\netc., and High Sheriff of the county in the years 1278, 1287, and 1289.\r\nHe died in 1324, during the reign of Edward II., and was succeeded by\r\nhis eldest son, Sir William de Clifton, who was Knight of the Shire for\r\nLancaster 1302-1304. Sir William de Clifton,[59] knt., the son of the\r\nlatter gentleman, came into possession of the estates on the demise\r\nof his father, and married in 1329, Margaret, the daughter of Sir R.\r\nShireburne, knt., of Stonyhurst, by whom he had issue one son, Nicholas,\r\nafterwards knighted. He also entailed the manors of Clifton and Westby\r\non his male issue, and settled the manor of Goosnargh upon his son and\r\nheir. He died in 1365. Sir Nicholas de Clifton, during one portion of\r\nhis life, held the post of Governor of the Castle of Ham, in Picardy.\r\nHe married Margaret, the daughter of Sir Thomas West, of Snitterfield,\r\nin Warwickshire, and had issue two sons—Robert and Thomas. The former,\r\nwho succeeded him, was Knight of the Shire 1382-1383, and espoused\r\nEleyne, the daughter of Sir Robert Ursewyck, knt., by whom he had three\r\nsons—Thomas, Roger, and James. In course of time, Thomas, the eldest,\r\nbecame the representative of the family, and married Agnes, the daughter\r\nof Sir Richard Molyneux, of Sefton. This gentleman (Thomas Clifton),\r\naccompanied the army of Henry V., when that monarch invaded France in\r\n1415. He settled Goosnargh and Wood-Plumpton upon his second son, James,\r\nwhile the other portion of the estates passed, on his death in 1442, to\r\nRichard, his heir. Richard Clifton formed a matrimonial alliance with\r\nAlice, the daughter of John Butler, of Rawcliffe, from which sprang\r\none child, James Clifton, who afterwards espoused Alice, the daughter\r\nof Robert Lawrence, of Ashton. The offspring of the latter union were\r\nRobert and John Clifton. The former on inheriting the property married\r\nMargaret, the daughter of Nicholas Butler, of Bewsey, in Lancashire.\r\nHis children were Cuthbert and William; and now, for a few generations,\r\nwe have two separate branches, the descendants of these gentlemen,\r\nwhich afterwards became united in the persons of their respective\r\nrepresentatives:—\r\n\r\n  SENIOR BRANCH.\r\n\r\n  Cuthbert Clifton,  =  Alice, d. and co-heiress of\r\n        of Clifton,  |   Sir John Lawrence, of\r\n        died 1512.   |   Ashton-under-Lyne.\r\n                     |\r\n                     |\r\n  Sir R.

I., and slain at Manchester.\r\n\r\nThis Thomas Clifton retained the Fairsnape estates, which he had\r\ninherited from his mother, during his lifetime, but on his decease they\r\npassed to his uncle. He married Eleanora Alathea, the daughter of Richard\r\nWalmsley, of Dunkenhalgh, in Lancashire. At his death he left a family\r\nof five daughters and two sons, the eldest of whom, Thomas Clifton, of\r\nClifton, Westby, and Lytham, subsequently espoused Mary, the daughter of\r\nthe fifth Viscount Molyneux. His heir, also Thomas, and born in 1728,\r\nrebuilt Lytham Hall, and allied himself to the noble house of Abingdon by\r\nmarrying, as his third wife, Lady Jane Bertie, the daughter of the third\r\nearl. The children of this union were seven, and John, the eldest, born\r\nin 1764, inherited the estates, and married Elizabeth, the daughter of\r\nThomas Horsley Widdrington-Riddell, of Felton Park, Northumberland. John\r\nClifton was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas, who had four brothers\r\nand three sisters—John, William, Charles, Mary, Harriet, and Elizabeth.\r\nThomas Clifton, of Clifton and Lytham, born in 1788, was a justice of\r\nthe peace, a deputy-lieutenant, and in 1835, High Sheriff of the county\r\nof Lancaster. He married Hetty, the daughter of Pellegrine Trevis, an\r\nItalian gentleman of ancient lineage, by whom he had issue John Talbot,\r\nborn in 1819; Thomas Henry, lieut.-colonel in the army, and knight of the\r\nLegion of Honour and of the Mejidie; Edward Arthur, died abroad in 1850;\r\nCharles Frederick, who espoused Lady Edith Maud, eldest daughter of the\r\nsecond Marquis of Hastings, and assumed in 1859, by act of parliament,\r\nthe arms and surname of Abney Hasting; and Augustus Wykenham, late\r\ncaptain in the Rifle Brigade, who married Lady Bertha Lelgarde Hastings,\r\nsecond daughter of the second Marquis of Hastings. John Talbot Clifton,\r\nesq., is still living, and is the present lord of Lytham, Clifton, etc.\r\nHe was for some years colonel of the 1st. Royal Lancashire Militia, and\r\nsat in Parliament from 1844 to 1847 as Member for North Lancashire. In\r\n1844 he married Eleanor Cicily, the daughter of the Hon. Colonel Lowther,\r\nM.P., and has one son, Thomas Henry Clifton, esq., who was born in 1845,\r\nand is now one of the Members of Parliament for North Lancashire. John\r\nTalbot Clifton, esq., is a justice of the peace, and deputy-lieutenant\r\nof this county. Thomas Henry Clifton, esq., M.P., espoused, in 1867,\r\nMadeline Diana Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Sir Andrew Agnew, bart.,\r\nand has issue several children.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Henry Lowther succeeded his uncle as third earl of Lonsdale,\r\nand at the same time his sisters Eleanor Cicily, the wife of John\r\nTalbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, and Augusta Mary, the wife of the\r\nRight Hon. Gerard James Noel, M.P., younger son of the first earl of\r\nGainsborough, were elevated to the rank of earl’s daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEETWOOD OF ROSSALL HALL.\r\n\r\nThis family sprang originally from Little Plumpton in the Fylde. Henry\r\nFleetwood being the first of whom there is any reliable record, and of\r\nhim nothing is known beyond the place of his residence, and the fact that\r\nhe had a son named Edmund. Edmund Fleetwood married Elizabeth Holland,\r\nof Downholme, and was living about the middle and earlier portion of the\r\nlatter half of the fifteenth century. From that marriage there sprang one\r\nson, William Fleetwood, who subsequently espoused Ellyn, the daughter of\r\nRobert Standish, and had issue John, Thomas, and Robert Fleetwood. Of\r\nthese three sons, Thomas, the second, resided at Vach in the county of\r\nBuckingham, and at the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII.,\r\nabout 1536, purchased from that monarch the reversion of the lease of\r\nRossall Grange, then held by the Allens from the Abbot and convent of\r\nDeulacres, in Staffordshire. Thomas Fleetwood married Barbara, the cousin\r\nand heiress of Andrew Frances, of London, and had issue five sons, the\r\nsecond and third of whom were knighted later in life, whilst the eldest,\r\nEdmund, came into possession of Rossall Hall and estate in 1583, after\r\nthe demise of Richard Allen, whose widow and daughters were ejected.\r\nThus Edmund Fleetwood was the first of the name to reside at Rossall,\r\nwhere he died about forty years later. This gentleman married Elizabeth,\r\nthe daughter of John Cheney, of Chesham Boys, in Buckinghamshire, and\r\nhad issue several sons and daughters. Paul, the eldest son and heir,\r\nwho succeeded him, was knighted by either James I. or Charles I., and\r\nmarried Jane, the daughter of Richard Argall from the county of Kent, by\r\nwhom he had three sons and two daughters. Edmund, the eldest son, had no\r\nmale issue, and at his death, in 1644, Richard, his brother, succeeded\r\nto the property and resided at Rossall Hall. Richard Fleetwood, who was\r\nonly fifteen years of age when the death of his predecessor occurred,\r\nsubsequently espoused a lady, named Anne Mayo, from the county of Herts,\r\nby whom he had only two children, a son and a daughter, and as the former\r\ndied in youth, the estate passed to the next male heir on his demise.\r\nThe heir was found in the person of Francis, of Hackensall Hall, the\r\nbrother of Richard Fleetwood and the third son of Sir Paul Fleetwood.\r\nFrancis Fleetwood, of Rossall, married Mary, the daughter of C. Foster,\r\nof Preesall, and had issue Richard Fleetwood, who succeeded him, and\r\na daughter. Richard Fleetwood resided at Rossall Hall, and married\r\nMargaret, the daughter of Edwin Fleetwood, of Leyland, in 1674. The\r\noffspring of that union were two sons, Edward and Paul, and a daughter\r\nMargaret. Edward, the heir, was born in 1682, and practised for some\r\ntime as an attorney in Ireland. On the death of his father, however, he\r\ninherited the property, and took up his abode at the ancestral Hall.\r\nHe espoused Sarah, the daughter of Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys.\r\nThomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, Blackpool, was on terms of friendship\r\nand intimacy with the Fleetwoods of Rossall at that period, and on the\r\nfourteenth of April, 1714, the following entry occurs in his diary,\r\nreferring to Edward Fleetwood, the lord of the manor, and his brother\r\nPaul, also Edward Veale, the father of Mrs. Ed. Fleetwood, whom, for some\r\nreason unknown, the diarist invariably designated Captain Veale:—“Went to\r\nRosshall. Dinᵈ with the trustys, yᵉ Lord & his lady, Mr. Paull, and Capᵗᵗ\r\nVeal. Gave I. Gardiner 1s., and a boy 6d.; soe to ffox Hall.”\r\n\r\nPaul Fleetwood, the younger brother of the “Lord” died in 1727 and was\r\nburied at Kirkham, where some of his descendants still exist in very\r\nhumble circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe offspring of Edward Fleetwood consisted only of one child, a\r\ndaughter, named Margaret, who was born in 1715, and to whom the estates\r\nappear to have descended on the decease of her father. On the sixteenth\r\nof February, 1733, she married, at Bispham church, Roger Hesketh, of\r\nNorth Meols and Tulketh. Roger Hesketh and his lady resided at Rossall\r\nHall until their respective demises, which happened, the latter in 1752,\r\nand the former in 1791. Fleetwood and Sarah Hesketh were the children\r\nof their union. On the decease of his father at the ripe age of 81\r\nyears, the son and heir, Fleetwood, had already been dead 22 years, and\r\nconsequently his son, Bold Fleetwood Hesketh, the eldest offspring of his\r\nmarriage, in 1759, with Frances, the third daughter of Peter Bold, of\r\nBold Hall, in the county of Lancaster, succeeded his grandfather Roger\r\nHesketh. Bold Fleetwood Hesketh, who was born in 1762, died unmarried in\r\n1819, and was buried at Poulton, his younger brother, Robert Hesketh,\r\ninheriting the Hall and estates. Robert Hesketh was in his 55th year when\r\nhe became possessed of the property, and had already been married 29\r\nyears to Maria, the daughter of Henry Rawlinson, of Lancaster, by whom he\r\nhad a numerous family. His four eldest sons died in youth and unmarried,\r\nthe oldest having only attained the age of twenty three, so that at\r\nhis decease in 1824 he was succeeded by his fifth son, Peter Hesketh.\r\nThis gentleman, who was born in 1801, espoused at Dover, in 1826, Eliza\r\nDelamaire, the daughter of Sir Theophilus J. Metcalf, of Fern Hill,\r\nBerkshire, by whom he had several children, who died in early youth. As\r\nhis second wife he married, in 1837, Verginie Marie, the daughter of\r\nSenor Pedro Garcia, and had issue one son, Peter Louis Hesketh. In 1831,\r\nPeter Hesketh obtained power by royal license to adopt the surname of\r\nFleetwood in addition to his own, and in 1838 he was created a baronet.\r\nIn 1844, Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood vacated Rossall Hall, and the site\r\nis now occupied by a large public educational institution, denominated\r\nthe Northern Church of England School. Sir P. H. Fleetwood died, at\r\nBrighton, in 1866, leaving one son and heir, the Rev. Sir Peter Louis\r\nHesketh Fleetwood, bart., M.A., of Sunbury on Thames, in the county of\r\nMiddlesex. The Rev. Charles Hesketh, M.A., rector of North Meols, is the\r\nyounger brother of the late Sir P. H. Fleetwood, and consequently uncle\r\nto the present baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFFRANCE OF LITTLE ECCLESTON HALL.\r\n\r\nWilliam, the son of John ffrance, who married the younger daughter of\r\nRichard Kerston, of Little Eccleston, was the first of this family to\r\nreside at the Hall, and he was living there at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. William ffrance had two sons and a daughter—John,\r\nborn 1647; Henry, born 1649; and Alice, born 1653. John, the eldest\r\nson, succeeded to the Hall and estates on the demise of his father, and\r\nmarried Deborah Elston, of Brockholes, by whom he had issue—Robert, who\r\ndied in 1671; Anne, died 1672; Thomas, died 1672; Deborah, died 1673;\r\nJohn, born 1675; William, died 1680; Henry, died 1676; Mary, died 1701;\r\nand Edward, died 1703. John ffrance, senʳ., survived all his sons except\r\nJohn and Edward, and on his death, in 1690, was succeeded by the former\r\nand elder of the two brothers. John ffrance, like his father, resided\r\nat the Hall, and espoused Joan, daughter of John Cross, of Cross Hall,\r\nby whom he had issue—John, born 1699; Anne, died 1702; and Henry, died\r\n1707. John ffrance died in 1762, and his eldest son, John, inherited the\r\nestates. This John ffrance married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of\r\nThomas Roe, of Out Rawcliffe, and by that union became possessed, later,\r\nof Rawcliffe manor and Hall, to which the family of ffrance removed.\r\nJohn ffrance, of Rawcliffe Hall, the son and heir of John and Elizabeth\r\nffrance, of Little Eccleston Hall, and subsequently of Rawcliffe, died\r\nchildless in 1817, aged 91 years, and bequeathed his property to Thomas\r\nWilson, of Preston, who assumed the name of ffrance.[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nHESKETH OF MAINS HALL.\r\n\r\nThis family was descended from the Heskeths, of Rufford, through\r\nWilliam Hesketh, of Aughton, the sixth son of Thomas Hesketh, of\r\nRufford. Bartholomew, the son of William Hesketh, of Aughton, succeeded\r\nto his father’s estates, and married Mary, the daughter of William\r\nNorris, of Speke, by whom he had one son, George, residing at Little\r\nPoulton Hall in 1570. George Hesketh married Dorothy, the daughter of\r\nWilliam Westby, of Mowbreck, and had issue a son, William, who, on his\r\nfather’s death, somewhere about 1571, inherited considerable property,\r\ncomprising possessions in no less than twenty-eight different townships\r\nin Lancashire. William Hesketh, who was living in 1613, married\r\nElizabeth, the daughter of John Allen, of Rossall Hall, and sister to\r\nCardinal Allen. The children springing from that union were William and\r\nWilfrid. William, the elder son, is the first of the Heskeths mentioned\r\nas inhabiting Mains Hall, and he appears to have been living there in\r\n1613. We have no documents throwing any certain light upon the way in\r\nwhich he gained possession of the seat, but it is most probable that he\r\npurchased it. William Hesketh, of Mains Hall, espoused Anne, the daughter\r\nof Hugh Anderton of Euxton, and had issue—Thomas, Roger, John, William,\r\nHugh, George, Anne, Alice, and Mary. Thomas, the eldest son, was nine\r\nyears old in 1613, hence it is extremely likely that he was the first\r\nrepresentative of the family born at Mains Hall. Thomas Hesketh was\r\ntwice married; the first time to Anne, the daughter of Simon Haydock,\r\nof Hezantford, and after her decease, to Mary, the daughter of John\r\nWestby, of Westby and Mowbreck. The children of his first marriage were\r\nWilliam; Thomas, an officer in the royalist army, and slain at Brindle\r\nin 1651; Anne, who became the wife of Thomas Nelson, of Fairhurst; and\r\nMargaret, afterwards the wife of Major George Westby, of Upper Rawcliffe.\r\nWilliam, the elder son, married Perpetua, the daughter of Thomas\r\nWestby, of Mowbreck, and had issue—Thomas, born in 1659; William, who\r\ndied in infancy; John; Anne, married to Richard Leckonby, of Leckonby\r\nHouse, Great Eccleston; Helen; Dorothy, married to Thomas Wilkinson,\r\nof Claughton; Perpetua, died in infancy; and six other daughters, all\r\nof whom died in youth. Thomas Hesketh, the eldest son, left four sons\r\nand three daughters—William; Thomas, who was a priest; John; George;\r\nMary; Perpetua; and Anne. William Hesketh, the eldest of these sons, was\r\nliving at the same time as Thomas Tyldesley, who died in 1714, and was\r\na frequent visitor at Fox Hall. He married Mary, the daughter of John\r\nBrockholes, of Claughton, and heiress to her brother William Brockholes,\r\nof Claughton, and had issue—Thomas, Roger, William, Joseph, James,\r\nCatherine (an abbess), Margaret, Anne, Mary (a nun), and Aloysia (a nun).\r\nThomas, the eldest son, inherited the property of his deceased uncle,\r\nWilliam Brockholes, and assumed the name and arms of Brockholes. He died\r\nin 1766. Roger, the second son, also died in 1766. William, the third\r\nson, was born in 1717, and in later years entered the “Society of Jesus,”\r\ndying in 1741. Joseph succeeded to the Brockholes’ estates on the death\r\nof his brother Thomas, and, like him, assumed the name of Brockholes. He\r\nmarried Constantia, the daughter of Bazil Fitzherbert, of Swinnerton, and\r\ndying in a few years without issue, was succeeded by his sole remaining\r\nbrother, James, who also assumed the name and arms of Brockholes,\r\nand some years afterwards died unmarried. The Brockholes’ property\r\nnow passed, under the will of Joseph Hesketh-Brockholes, to William\r\nFitzherbert, the brother of his widow; and that gentleman, after the\r\nmanner of his predecessors, assumed the name of Brockholes. He espoused\r\nMary, the daughter and co-heiress of James Windsor Heneage, of Cadeby,\r\nLincolnshire, and had issue—Thomas Fitzherbert-Brockholes, of Claughton;\r\nCatherine, abbess of the Benedictines at Ghent; Margaret; Ann; Mary, who\r\nbecame a nun; and Frances.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORNBY OF POULTON.\r\n\r\nThe Hornbys, of Poulton, were descended from Hugh Hornby, of Singleton,\r\nwho died about 1638, after having so far impoverished himself during\r\nthe civil wars as to be obliged to dispose of his estate at Bankfield,\r\ninherited from his sister, and purchased from him by the Harrisons.\r\nGeoffrey Hornby, the son of this gentleman, practised very successfully\r\nas a solicitor in Preston, and probably was the first to acquire property\r\nin Poulton. Edmund Hornby, his eldest son, of Poulton, where he also\r\npractised as a solicitor, and Scale Hall, married Dorothy, the daughter\r\nof Geoffrey Rishton, of Antley, in Lancashire, Member of Parliament\r\nfor Preston, and had issue—Geoffrey, George, and Anne. George, the\r\nsecond son, went into holy orders, became rector of Whittingham, and\r\nsubsequently died without surviving offspring. Anne Hornby married\r\nEdmund Cole, of Beaumont Cote, near Lancaster; and Geoffrey Hornby, who\r\ninherited the Poulton property, as well as Scale Hall, espoused Susannah,\r\nthe daughter and heiress of Edward Sherdley, of Kirkham, gentleman, by\r\nwhom he had issue—Edmund and Geoffrey, the latter dying unmarried in\r\n1801. Geoffrey Hornby, who died in 1732, was buried in Poulton church,\r\nbeing succeeded by his son Edmund, who came into the possessions at\r\nPoulton and Scale. Edmund Hornby, born in 1728, married Margaret,\r\nthe daughter of John Winckley, of Brockholes, and had issue one son,\r\nGeoffrey, and three daughters. At his decease, in 1766, the estates\r\ndescended to his only son and heir, Geoffrey, born at Layton Hall in\r\n1750, who, after being High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1774, and for some\r\ntime colonel of a Lancashire regiment of militia, entered the church and\r\nbecame rector of Winwick. The Rev. Geoffrey Hornby espoused the Hon. Lucy\r\nSmith Stanley, daughter of Lord Strange, and sister of the twelfth earl\r\nof Derby, and had issue; but the departure of this representative of the\r\nfamily from the homes of his fathers severed the close connection between\r\nthe town of Poulton and the name of Hornby, after an existence of about a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORNBY OF RIBBY HALL.\r\n\r\nRichard Hornby, of Newton, who was born in 1613, married Elizabeth,\r\nthe daughter of Christopher Walmsley, of Elston, and had issue a son,\r\nWilliam Hornby, also of Newton. That gentleman had several children by\r\nhis wife Isabel, the eldest of whom, Robert Hornby, was born in 1690,\r\nand espoused Elizabeth Sharrock, of Clifton, leaving issue by her at his\r\ndecease in 1768, three sons—Hugh, William, and Richard. Hugh Hornby took\r\nup his abode at Kirkham, where he married Margaret, the daughter and\r\nheiress of Joseph Hankinson, of the same place, and had issue—Joseph,\r\nborn in 1748; Robert, born in 1750, and died in 1776; Thomas, of\r\nKirkham, born in 1759, married Cicely, the daughter of Thomas Langton,\r\nof that town, and died in 1824, having had a family of two sons and five\r\ndaughters; William, of Kirkham; John, of Blackburn and Raikes Hall,\r\nBlackpool, born in 1763; Hugh, vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, born\r\nin 1765; Alice, who became the wife of Richard Birley, of Blackburn;\r\nand Elizabeth. Joseph Hornby was a deputy-lieutenant of the county of\r\nLancaster, and erected Ribby Hall. He married Margaret, the daughter of\r\nRobert Wilson, of Preston, by whom he had Hugh; Margaret, who espoused\r\nWilliam Langton, of Manchester; and Alice, who died a spinster. Hugh\r\nHornby, the only son, born in 1799, succeeded to the Hall and lands on\r\nthe death of his father in 1832, and left issue at his own demise, in\r\n1849, Hugh Hilton, Margaret Anne, and Mary Alice. Hugh Hilton Hornby, of\r\nRibby Hall, esq., who married his relative, Georgina, the daughter of the\r\nRev. Robert Hornby, M.A., J.P., in 1868, is the present representative of\r\nthe family, and was born in 1836.\r\n\r\nJohn Hornby, of Blackburn and Raikes Hall, married Alice Kendal, a widow,\r\nand the daughter of Daniel Backhouse, of Liverpool, by whom he had\r\nfour sons—Daniel, born in 1800, who espoused Frances, daughter of John\r\nBirley, of Manchester, and dying in 1863, left issue, Fanny Backhouse\r\nand Margaret Alice Hornby; Robert, born in 1804, M.A., a clergyman and\r\njustice of the peace, who married Maria Leyland, daughter of Sir William\r\nFielden, bart., and had issue, Robert Montagu, William St. John Sumner,\r\nLeyland, Frederick Fielden, Henry Wallace, Hugh, and ten daughters, the\r\nfirst and third sons being captains in the army, and the second in the\r\nroyal navy; William Henry, of Staining Hall, J.P. and D.L., born in\r\n1805, and Member of Parliament for Blackburn from 1857 to 1869, married\r\nSusannah, only child of Edward Birley, of Kirkham, by whom he had John,\r\nEdward Kenworthy, Henry Sudell, William Henry, Cecil Lumsden, Albert\r\nNeilson, Charles Herbert, Elizabeth Henriana, Frances Mary, Augusta\r\nMargaret, and Caroline Louisa, of whom Edward Kenworthy Hornby, esq.,\r\nhas sat as M.P. for Blackburn; John, M.A., formerly M.P. for Blackburn,\r\nand born 1810, married Margaret, daughter of the Rev. Christopher Bird,\r\nhaving issue, John Frederick, Wilfrid Bird, Edith Diana, and Clara\r\nMargaret. The Rev. Hugh Hornby, M.A., sixth son of Hugh Hornby, of\r\nKirkham, was vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, and espoused Ann, daughter\r\nof Dr. Joshua Starky, a physician, of Redbales, having issue one son,\r\nWilliam, now the Venerable Archdeacon Hornby, M.A., and the present vicar\r\nof St. Michael’s, born in 1810. Archdeacon Hornby married, firstly,\r\nEllen, daughter of William Cross, esq., of Red Scar, and four years after\r\nher decease, in 1844, Susan Charlotte, daughter of Admiral Sir Phipps\r\nHornby, K.C.B. The offspring of the earlier union were two—William Hugh\r\nand Joseph Starky, both of whom died young; whilst those of the second\r\nmarriage are—William, Hugh Phipps, Phipps John, James John, William\r\nStarky, Susan, and Anne Lucy, the eldest of whom, William, died in 1858,\r\naged thirteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nLECKONBY OF LECKONBY HOUSE.\r\n\r\nJohn Leckonby, the earliest of the name we find mentioned as connected\r\nwith Great Eccleston, on the borders of which stood Leckonby House,\r\nwas living in 1621, and was twice married—first to Alice, the daughter\r\nof Thomas Singleton, of Staining Hall, and subsequently, in 1625, to\r\nMarie, the daughter of Henry Preston, of Preston. Richard Leckonby,\r\nthe eldest son and heir, was the offspring of his first marriage, and\r\nlike his father, became involved in the civil wars on the royal side.\r\nRichard succeeded to the family estates sometime before 1646, for in\r\nthat year he compounded for them with Parliament. He left issue at his\r\ndeath in 1669, by his wife, Isabel, a numerous family—John; Richard,\r\nof Elswick; George; William, of Elswick; Sarah; Martha; and Mary, who\r\nmarried Gilbert Whiteside, of Marton, gentleman. John Leckonby inherited\r\nthe estate, and resided at the ancestral mansion—Leckonby House. He\r\nmarried Ann, the daughter of William Thompson, gent., of Little\r\nEccleston, but dying without offspring, was succeeded by his brother\r\nRichard, who had espoused Ann, the daughter of William Hesketh, of\r\nMains Hall. The children of Richard Leckonby, of Leckonby House, were\r\nWilliam; Richard, who was born in 1696, and afterwards became a Romish\r\nmissionary; and Thomas, also a missionary, who died at Maryland in 1734.\r\nWilliam Leckonby, the eldest son, occupied Leckonby House, after the\r\ndecease of his father, as holder of the hereditary estates. He espoused\r\nAnne, the daughter of Thomas Hothersall, of Hothersall Hall, and sister\r\nand co-heiress of John Hothersall, and had issue—Richard; Thomas, born\r\nin 1717, who entered the Order of Jesus; William, of Elswick, who died\r\nin 1784; Anne, born in 1706; Bridget; and Mary, who became the wife of\r\nThomas Singleton, of Barnacre-with-Bonds, gent. Richard Leckonby, who\r\nsucceeded his father in 1728, inherited, in addition to the lands in\r\nGreat Eccleston and Elswick, the extensive manor of Hothersall, and by\r\nhis marriage with Mary, the daughter of William Hawthornthwaite, of\r\nCatshaw, gent., came into possession, on the death of her brother John\r\nHawthornthwaite in 1760, of Catshaw, Lower Wyersdale, Hale, Luddocks, and\r\nStockenbridge. Notwithstanding these large accessions to the original\r\nfamily domain, Richard Leckonby managed, by a long career of dissipation\r\nand extravagance, to run through his resources, mortgaging his estates,\r\nand bringing himself and his family to comparative poverty. He died in\r\n1783, at about 68 years of age, having survived his wife many years, and\r\nwas buried at St. Michael’s-on-Wyre. His offspring were two sons, the\r\nelder of whom was thrown from a pony and killed in early youth; whilst\r\nthe second, William, met with a fatal accident when hunting in Wyersdale\r\nthe year before the death of his father. William Leckonby, left, at his\r\nuntimely death, by his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of James Taylor, of\r\nGoosnargh, gent., two sons and a daughter. Of these children, Richard,\r\nthe eldest, died in 1795, when only sixteen years of age; James, the\r\nsecond son, died in infancy; and Mary, their sister, married in 1799, at\r\nthe age of twenty-two years, Thomas Henry Hale Phipps, of Leighton House,\r\nWiltshire, a justice of the peace and deputy-lieutenant of his county, by\r\nwhich union, Leckonby of Leckonby House, became a title of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEYLAND OF LEYLAND HOUSE AND KELLAMERGH.\r\n\r\nLeyland House was occupied during the latter half of the seventeenth and\r\npart of the eighteenth centuries by a family of wealth and position,\r\nnamed the Leylands of Kellamergh. Christopher Leyland, the first of the\r\nline recorded, resided at Leyland House in 1660, and married in 1665,\r\nMargaret Andrew, of Lea, by whom he had issue—John; Ralph, died in 1675;\r\nAnne, born 1671; Ellen, born 1679; Susan, died 1670; another Ralph, born\r\n1680 and died 1711; Francis, died 1674; Bridget, died 1687; Roger, died\r\n1678; and Thomas, who died in 1682.\r\n\r\nJohn Leyland, who succeeded to the Kellamergh property and Leyland\r\nHouse on the death of his father in 1716, married, in 1693, Elizabeth\r\nWhitehead, and had offspring—Christopher, born 1694; Thomas, born 1699,\r\nafterwards in holy orders; Joseph, died 1709; Ralph, born 1712; John,\r\ndied 1716; and William, who espoused Cicely, widow of Edward Rigby, of\r\nFreckleton, and daughter of Thomas Shepherd Birley, by whom he had two\r\ndaughters, one of whom, Jane Leyland, subsequently married Thomas Langton.\r\n\r\nChristopher Leyland inherited Kellamergh and the mansion on the demise\r\nof his father, John Leyland, in 1745, and at his own death, some years\r\nlater, left one child, Elizabeth, who married, as her second husband, the\r\nRev. Edward Whitehead, vicar of Bolton.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGWORTH OF ST. MICHAEL’S HALL.\r\n\r\nThe family of Longworths, inhabiting St. Michael’s Hall until the early\r\npart of the eighteenth century, was descended from the Longworths,\r\nof Longworth, through Ralph, a younger son of Christopher Longworth,\r\nof Longworth, by his wife Alice, the daughter of Thomas Standish, of\r\nDuxbury. Ralph Longworth married Anne, the daughter of Thomas Kitchen,\r\nand had issue two sons and one daughter. Robert, the younger son,\r\nespoused Helen Hudson, whilst Elizabeth, his sister, married Richard\r\nBlackburne, and afterwards Thomas Bell, of Kirkland. Richard, the elder\r\nson and heir, is the first of the Longworths, described as of St.\r\nMichael’s Hall, in Upper Rawcliffe. He married Margaret, the daughter\r\nof George Cumming, of Upper Rawcliffe, and had issue—Ralph, Thomas,\r\nLawrence, Christopher, Anne, Elizabeth, and Katherine. Ralph, the\r\neldest son, espoused Jane, the daughter of Richard Cross, of Cross Hall,\r\nin Chorley parish, but further than this fact, we have no information\r\nconcerning him. The family of the Crosses, into which he married,\r\nbelonged to Liverpool, and their old country seat, Cross Hall, is now\r\nconverted into cottages and workshops. Thomas Longworth, the second\r\nson, born in 1622, resided at St. Michael’s Hall, and married Cicely,\r\nthe daughter of Nicholas Wilkinson, of Kirkland, by whom he had one\r\nson—Richard Longworth. The latter representative, having succeeded in\r\ncourse of time to the Hall and estates, was a justice of the peace for\r\nthe county of Lancaster, and on terms of intimacy with Thomas Tyldesley,\r\nof Fox Hall, Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys, William Hesketh, of Mains\r\nHall, and a number of other leading gentry in the district. He married\r\nFleetwood, the daughter of Edward Shutteworth, of Larbrick, and Thornton\r\nHall, and left at his demise one son—Edward Longworth, who became a\r\ndoctor of medicine, and resided at St. Michael’s Hall until 1725, about\r\nwhich time he removed to Penrith, in the county of Cumberland.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKER OF BRADKIRK HALL.\r\n\r\nThe Parkers, who inhabited Bradkirk Hall for over a hundred years, were\r\nrelatives of the Derby family, and came originally from Breightmet Hall,\r\nnear Bolton, where they had lived for many centuries. William Parker,\r\nof Bradkirk Hall, who died in 1609, and was buried at Kirkham, is the\r\nfirst of whom we have any authentic account, and he is stated to have\r\nmarried Margaret, the daughter of Robert Shaw, of Crompton. The children\r\nspringing from that union were—John, who inherited Bradkirk Hall; Thomas,\r\nof Bidstone, in the county of Chester; and Henry, who espoused, in\r\n1609, Alice Threlfall, and became the founder of the family of Parkers\r\nof Whittingham. John Parker, of Bradkirk Hall, married Margaret, the\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Anthony Parker, of Radham Park, Yorkshire;\r\nand after her decease he espoused Alice, the daughter of Richard\r\nMason, of Up-Holland, near Wigan, by whom he had three sons and one\r\ndaughter—William, Richard, John, and Margaret. The offspring of his first\r\nmarriage were Anthony, Elizabeth, Jennet, Anne, Alice, and Christopher.\r\nAnthony died unmarried, and Christopher, the second son, born in 1625,\r\nsucceeded to Bradkirk Hall on the demise of his father. He was a justice\r\nof the peace for the county of Lancaster, and married Katherine, sister\r\nto James Lowde, of Kirkham, and daughter of Ralph Lowde, of Norfolk.\r\nHis children were Anthony; Alexander, who married Dorothy, the daughter\r\nof Thomas Westby, of Mowbreck; John, William, Gerrard, Christopher,\r\nMargaret, Mary, and Jane, the last married John Westby, of Mowbreck, at\r\nPoulton church, in 1688. Anthony Parker, the eldest son, born in 1657,\r\nlived at Bradkirk Hall, and espoused Mary, the daughter of Sir Thomas\r\nStringer, sergeant-at-law, by whom he had issue—Christopher, Catherine,\r\nand Rebecca, who died young. Christopher Parker inherited Bradkirk Hall,\r\nand was Member of Parliament for Clitheroe in 1708. He died unmarried\r\nabout 1713, and the Hall and estates passed by will to his sister\r\nCatherine, the wife of Thomas Stanley, of Cross Hall, in Ormskirk Parish,\r\nconjointly with her uncle Alexander Parker. In 1723 the possessions of\r\nthe deceased Christopher Parker in Lancashire and Yorkshire were sold by\r\nCatherine Stanley and Alexander Parker. The latter, however, resided at\r\nBradkirk Hall for some time after that date with his wife Dorothy, the\r\ndaughter, as before stated, of Thomas Westby of Mowbreck, by whom he had\r\nnine sons and two daughters. The sons appear to have died without issue,\r\nand one of the daughters, Dorothy, married ⸺ Cowburn, whilst the other\r\nKatherine, became the wife of William Jump, of Hesketh Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGBY OF LAYTON HALL.\r\n\r\nThe Rigbys, of Layton, were descended from Adam Rigby, of Wigan, who\r\nmarried Alice, the daughter of ⸺ Middleton, of Leighton, and had\r\nissue—John, Alexander, and Ellen. John Rigby, of Wigan, married Joanna,\r\nthe daughter of Gilbert Molyneux, of Hawkley, and became the founder of\r\nthe family of Rigby of Middleton. Ellen became the wife of Hugh Forth;\r\nand Alexander Rigby, of Burgh Hall, in the township of Duxbury, espoused\r\nJoanna, the daughter of William Lathbroke, by whom he had three sons and\r\none daughter—Edward, Roger, Alexander, and Anne. Edward Rigby, of Burgh,\r\nwho purchased the estate of Woodenshaw from William, earl of Derby, in\r\n1595, was the first of the family, as far as can be ascertained, who\r\nheld property in the Fylde, and from his _Inq. post mortem_, dated\r\n1629-30, we find that he possessed Laiton, Great Laiton, Little Laiton,\r\nWarbrecke, Blackepool, and Marton, besides other estates in Broughton\r\nin Furness, Lancaster, Chorley, etc. This gentleman married Dorothy,\r\nthe daughter of Hugh Anderton, of Euxton, and had issue—Alexander,\r\nHugh, Alice, Jane, and Dorothy. Alexander Rigby, who was born in 1583,\r\nsucceeded to Layton Hall, and Burgh, on the death of his father, and\r\nafterwards married Katherine, the daughter of Sir Edward Brabazon, of\r\nNether Whitacre, in the county of Warwick. In 1641, during the time of\r\nCharles I., he was a colonel in the king’s forces, and was, somewhere\r\nabout that period, removed from the commission of the peace for this\r\ncounty by command of Parliament on account of certain charges made\r\nagainst him of favouring the royal party. In 1646 he compounded for\r\nhis sequestrated estates by paying £381 3s. 4d. His offspring were\r\nEdward, of Burgh, and Layton Hall; Thomas, rector of St. Mary’s, Dublin;\r\nWilliam, a merchant; Mary, wife of John Moore, of Bank Hall; Elizabeth,\r\nwife of Edward Chisenhall, of Chisenhall; Jane, the wife of the Rev.\r\nPaul Lathome, rector of Standish; and Alexander, who died in infancy.\r\nEdward, the eldest son, who died before his father, married Mary, the\r\ndaughter of Edward Hyde, of Norbury, and left issue—Alexander, William,\r\nHamlet, Robert, Richard, Mary, and Dorothy. Alexander Rigby, the heir,\r\nwho was born in 1634, was also an officer in the royalist army, and\r\nerected a monument to Sir Thomas Tyldesley near the spot where he was\r\nslain at Wigan-lane, at which battle “the grateful erector” fought as\r\ncornet. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1677 and 1678, and married\r\nAlena, the daughter of George Birch, of Birch Hall, near Manchester. His\r\nchildren were Edward, Alexander, Mary, Alice, Eleanor, and Elizabeth.\r\nOf Edward we have no account beyond the fact that he was born in 1658,\r\nand consequently must conclude that he died young. Alexander, the second\r\nson, succeeded to the estates, and was knighted for some reason, which\r\ncannot be discovered. He was High Sheriff of the county in 1691-2.\r\nMary, the eldest daughter, married Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, and\r\nwas co-heiress with Elizabeth, wife, and subsequently, in 1720, widow\r\nof ⸺ Colley, to her brother, Sir Alexander Rigby, of Layton Hall and\r\nBurgh, who married Alice, the daughter of Thomas Clifton, of Clifton,\r\nWestby, and Lytham, but left no surviving offspring. Sir Alexander Rigby\r\nis reputed to have been a gambler, and to have so impoverished his\r\nestates, already seriously injured by the attachment of his family to the\r\nfortunes of Charles I. and II., that he was compelled to dispose of his\r\npossessions in Poulton and Layton for the benefit of his creditors. He\r\nalso appears to have been imprisoned for debt until released by an act\r\nof Parliament, passed in the first year of George I., and his property\r\nvested in trustees. His estates in Layton and Poulton were sold for\r\n£19,200. After his liberation he resided in Poulton at his house on the\r\nsouth side of the Market-place, where the family arms, bearing the date\r\n1693, may still be seen fixed on the outer wall. The pew of the Rigbys\r\nis still in existence in the parish church of that town, and has carved\r\non its door the initials A. R., and the date 1636, separated by a goat’s\r\nhead, the crest of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGLETON OF STAINING HALL.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to suppose that the Singletons who resided at\r\nStaining Hall during the greater part of two centuries were a branch\r\nof the family founded in the Fylde by Alan de Singleton, of Singleton.\r\nGeorge, the son of Robert Singleton by his wife Helen, the daughter of\r\nJohn Westby, of Mowbreck, purchased the hamlet and manor of Staining from\r\nSir Thomas Holt, of Grislehurst, and was the first of the name to occupy\r\nthe Hall. He married Mary Osbaldeston, and left issue at his death, in\r\n1552, William, the eldest; Hugh, who espoused Mary, sister of William\r\nCarleton, of Carleton, and left a son, William, who died without issue;\r\nRichard; Lawrence; and Margaret, the wife of Lawrence Carleton, heir\r\nand subsequently successor to his brother William. William Singleton,\r\nof Staining, became allied to Alice, the daughter and heiress of Thomas\r\nffarington, by whom he had Thomas, John, George, Richard, Helen, and\r\nMargaret. On the demise of his father in 1556, Thomas, the heir, came\r\ninto possession of the estate; he married Alice, the daughter of James\r\nMassey, and had one child, a daughter, Ellen, who espoused John Massey,\r\nof Layton. Thomas Singleton died in 1563, and was succeeded by his\r\nbrother John, who had married Thomasine, the daughter of Robert Anderton,\r\nand had issue two daughters, the elder of whom, Alice, became the wife\r\nof Henry Huxley, of Birkenhead, and the younger, Elizabeth, of James\r\nMassey, of Strangeways. John Singleton died in 1590, and was in his turn\r\nsucceeded by the next male representative, his brother George, who had\r\nissue by his wife Mary, the daughter of John Houghton, of Penwortham or\r\nPendleton, two sons and a daughter—Thomas, George, and Anne, the wife\r\nof Robert Parkinson, of Fairsnape. Thomas Singleton, the heir, became\r\nlord of Staining in 1597, previously to which he had espoused Cicely,\r\nthe daughter of William Gerard, of Ince, and had issue Thomas, John,\r\nMary, Grace, Alice, the last of whom married John Leckonby, of Great\r\nEccleston, and Anne, the wife of Richard Bamber, of the Moor, near\r\nPoulton. Thomas Singleton, the eldest son, succeeded to the lordship in\r\nthe natural course of events, and formed an alliance with Dorothy, the\r\ndaughter of James Anderton, of Clayton, who was left a widow in 1643,\r\nwhen her husband was slain at Newbury Fight in command of a company of\r\nroyalists. The offspring of Thomas and Dorothy Singleton were John, born\r\nin 1635 and died in 1668, who espoused Jane, the daughter of Edmund\r\nFleetwood, of Rossall; Thomas, who died childless; George; James; Anne,\r\nof Bardsea, a spinster, living in 1690; Mary, the wife of John Mayfield;\r\nand Dorothy, the wife of Alexander Butler, of Todderstaff Hall. John\r\nSingleton, of Staining, whose widow married Thomas Cole, of Beaumont,\r\nnear Lancaster, justice of the peace, and deputy-lieutenant, had no\r\nprogeny, and the manor passed, either at once, or after the death of\r\nthe next brother, Thomas, to George Singleton, who had possession in\r\n1679, but was dead in 1690, never having been married. He held Staining,\r\nHardhorne, Todderstaff, and Carleton manors or estates. The whole of\r\nthe property descended to John Mayfield, the son and heir of his sister\r\nMary, whose husband, John Mayfield, was dead. John Mayfield, of Staining,\r\netc., ultimately died without issue, and was succeeded by his nephew and\r\nheir-at-law, William Blackburn, of Great Eccleston, whose offspring were\r\nJames, and Gabriel, under age in 1755.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANLEY OF GREAT ECCLESTON HALL.\r\n\r\nThe Stanleys, of Great Eccleston, were descended from Henry, the fourth\r\nearl of Derby, who was born in 1531, through Thomas Stanley, one of his\r\nillegitimate children by Jane Halsall, of Knowsley, the others being\r\nDorothy and Ursula. Thomas Stanley settled at Great Eccleston Hall,\r\nprobably acquired by purchase, and married Mary, the relict of Richard\r\nBarton, of Barton, near Preston, and the daughter of Robert Hesketh,\r\nof Rufford. The offspring of that union were—Richard Stanley; Fernando\r\nStanley, of Broughton, who died unmarried in 1664; and Jane Stanley, who\r\nwas married to Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall. Richard Stanley, the\r\neldest son, succeeded to Great Eccleston Hall and estate on the death of\r\nhis father, and espoused Mary, the daughter and sole heiress of Lambert\r\nTyldesley, of Garret, by whom he had one son, Thomas Stanley, who in\r\ncourse of time inherited the Eccleston property, and married Frances,\r\nthe daughter of Major-General Sir Thomas Tyldesley, of Tyldesley and\r\nMyerscough Lodge, the famous royalist officer slain at the battle of\r\nWigan-lane in 1651. Richard Stanley, the only child of this marriage,\r\nresided at Great Eccleston Hall, and espoused Anne, the daughter and\r\neventually co-heiress of Thomas Culcheth, of Culcheth, by whom he had two\r\nsons—Thomas and Henry Stanley. Richard Stanley, who died in 1714, was\r\nburied at St. Michael’s church, and the following extract is taken from\r\nthe diary of Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, the grandson of Sir Thomas\r\nTyldesley, and consequently Richard Stanley’s cousin, who at that time\r\nappears to have been in failing health, and whose death occurred on the\r\n26th of January in the ensuing year:—\r\n\r\n  “October 16, 1714.—Wentt in ye morning to the ffuneral off Dick\r\n  Stanley. Partᵈ with Mr. Brandon att Dick Jackson’s dor; but fell\r\n  at Staven’s Poole; and soe wentt home.”\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that for two years the cousins had not been\r\non very friendly terms, owing to Richard Stanley having at a meeting\r\nof creditors, summoned by Thomas Tyldesley in 1712, when he had fallen\r\ntoo deeply into debt, objected to an allowance being made to Winefride\r\nand Agatha, daughters of Thomas Tyldesley by a second marriage. We\r\nmay form some idea of the strong feeling existing between them from\r\nan entry made on the 7th of May, 1712, by Thomas Tyldesley in his\r\ndiary:—“Stanley—Dicke—very bitter against my two poor girlles, and\r\ndeclared he would bee hanged beffor they had one penny allowed; yet my\r\nhonest and never-to-be-forgotten true friend Winckley, with much art\r\nand sence, soe perswaded the otheʳ refferys that the slaving puppy was\r\ncompelled to consent to a small allowance to be sedulled—viz.: £100\r\neach.” After the decease of Richard Stanley, Great Eccleston Hall, for\r\nsome reason we are unable to explain, passed into the possession of\r\nThomas Westby, of Upper Rawcliffe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYLDESLEY OF FOX HALL.\r\n\r\nThe family which inhabited the ancient mansion of Fox Hall in the time of\r\nCharles II., and for many subsequent years, sprang originally from the\r\nsmall village of Tyldesley, near Bolton-le-moors. When or how they first\r\nbecame associated with the latter place is impossible to determine, as no\r\nauthentic documents bearing on the subject can be discovered; but that\r\nthey must have been established in or connected with the neighbourhood\r\nat an early epoch is shown by the fact that Henry de Tyldesley held the\r\ntenth part of a Knight’s fee in Tyldesley during the reign of Edward I.,\r\n1272-1307. A Richard de Tyldesley was lord of the manor of Tyldesley\r\ntowards the close of the sovereignty of this monarch, and there is\r\nsufficient evidence to warrant the assumption that he was the son and\r\nheir of Henry de Tyldesley.\r\n\r\nAt a later period Thurstan de Tyldesley, a lineal descendant, who is\r\naccredited with having done much to improve his native village, and\r\nhaving built Wardley Hall, near Manchester, about 1547, was a justice of\r\nthe peace for the county of Lancaster, and Receiver-General for the Isle\r\nof Man in 1532. He was on intimate and friendly terms with the earl of\r\nDerby, and we may safely conjecture that the members of the two houses\r\nhad for long been familiarly known to each other, as we read that in\r\n1405 Henry IV. granted a letter of protection to William de Stanley,\r\nknt., John de Tyldesley, and several more, when they set out to take\r\npossession of the Isle of Man and Peel Castle. In 1417, when Sir John\r\nde Stanley, lord of the same island, was summoned to England, he left\r\nThurston de Tyldesley, a magistrate, to officiate as governor during\r\nhis absence. The Tyldesleys held extensive lands in Wardley, Morleys,\r\nMyerscough, and Tyldesley, having seats at the three first-named manors.\r\nThurstan de Tyldesley, who erected Wardley Hall, was twice married and\r\nhad issue by each wife. To the offspring of the first, Parnell, daughter\r\nof Geoffrey Shakerley, of Shakerley, he left Tyldesley and Wardley; and\r\nto those of his second, Jane, daughter of Ralph Langton, baron of Newton,\r\nhe bequeathed Myerscough, and some minor property. There is nothing\r\ncalling for special notice concerning any, except two, of the descendants\r\nfrom the first marriage—Sir Thomas Tyldesley, a great-grandson,\r\nattorney-general for Lancashire in the reign of James I.; and his son,\r\nwho did not survive him many months, and terminated the elder branch.\r\nIn consequence of this failure of issue the Tyldesley estate, but not\r\nWardley, which had been sold, passed to the representatives of Thurstan’s\r\nchildren by his second wife. The eldest son of the second alliance,\r\nEdward, had espoused Anne, the daughter and heiress of Thomas Leyland, of\r\nMorleys, and, subsequently, inherited the manor and Hall of Morleys. The\r\ngrandson and namesake of Edward Tyldesley, of Morleys and Tyldesley, who\r\nwas born in 1585, and died in 1618, entertained James I. for three days\r\nat his seat, Myerscough Lodge, in 1617. Edward Tyldesley, of Myerscough,\r\nwas the father of Major-General Sir Thomas Tyldesley, knt., who so\r\ngreatly distinguished himself, by his fidelity and valour, in the wars\r\nbetween King and Parliament. In those sanguinary and calamitous struggles\r\nhe served under the standard of royalty. He was slain at the battle of\r\nWigan-lane in 1651; and as a mark of esteem for his many virtues and\r\ngallant deeds a monument was erected, near the spot where he fell, in\r\n1679, by Alexander Rigby, of Layton Hall, High Sheriff for the county of\r\nLancaster. The monument was inscribed as under:—\r\n\r\n  “An high Act of Gratitude, which conveys the Memory of\r\n  SIR THOMAS TYLDESLEY\r\n  To posterity,\r\n  Who served King Charles the First as Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  at Edge-Hill Battle,\r\n  After raising regiments of Horse, Foot, and Dragoons,\r\n  and for\r\n  The desperate storming of Burton on Trent, over a bridge of 36 arches,\r\n  RECEIVED THE HONOUR OF KNIGHTHOOD.\r\n  He afterwards served in all the wars in great command,\r\n  Was Governor of Litchfield,\r\n  And followed the fortune of the Crown through the Three Kingdoms,\r\n  And never compounded with the Rebels though strongly invested;\r\n  And on the 25th of August, A.D. 1651, was here slain,\r\n  Commanding as Major-General under the Earl of Derby,\r\n  To whom the grateful erector, Alexander Rigby, Esq., was Cornet;\r\n  And when he was High Sheriff of this county, A.D. 1679,\r\n  Placed the high obligation on the whole Family of the Tyldesleys,\r\n  To follow the noble example of their Loyal Ancestor.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Tyldesley married Frances, daughter of Ralph Standish, of\r\nStandish, and had issue—Edward, born in 1635; Thomas, born in 1642;\r\nRalph, born in 1644; Bridget, who became the wife of Henry Blundell,\r\nof Ince Blundell; Elizabeth; Frances, wife of Thomas Stanley, of Great\r\nEccleston; Anne, who was abbess of the English nuns at Paris in 1721;\r\nDorothy; Mary, wife of Richard Crane; and Margaret.\r\n\r\nEdward Tyldesley, the eldest son and heir, followed in the footsteps of\r\nhis father, and was a staunch supporter of Charles II. When that monarch\r\nhad been restored to the throne of his ancestors he purposed creating\r\na fresh order of Knighthood, called the Royal Oak,[62] wherewith to\r\nreward a number of his faithful adherents, whose social positions were\r\nof sufficient standing to render them suitable recipients of the honour.\r\nEdward Tyldesley was amongst those selected; but the design was abandoned\r\nby the king under the advice of his ministers, who considered that it\r\nwas likely to produce jealousy and dissatisfaction in many quarters, and\r\nmight prove inimical to the peace of the nation. Under an impression,\r\nwhich afterwards proved erroneous, that Charles II. intended to confer\r\nupon him the lands of Layton Hawes, in recognition of the loyal services\r\nof his father and himself, Edward Tyldesley erected a residence, called\r\nFox Hall, near its borders, where he lived during certain portions of\r\nthe year until his death, which occurred between 1685 and 1687. Edward\r\nTyldesley espoused Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Fleetwood, of Colwich, in\r\nStaffordshire, and baron of Newton, in Lancashire; and after her decease,\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Adam Beaumont, of Whitley, by whom he had only\r\none child, Catherine Tyldesley, of Preston. The offspring of his union\r\nwith Anne Fleetwood were Thomas, Edward, Frances, and Maria. Thomas\r\nTyldesley succeeded to the estates, on the decease of his father, with\r\nthe exception of Tyldesley, which had been sold by Edward Tyldesley in\r\n1685, and resided during a considerable part of his life at Fox Hall,\r\nand occasionally at Myerscough Lodge. Thomas Tyldesley was born in 1657,\r\nand at twenty-two years of age married Eleanor, daughter and co-heiress\r\nof Thomas Holcroft, of Holcroft, by whom he had Edward, Dorothy, Frances,\r\nElizabeth, Eleanor, and Mary. After the death of his wife Eleanor, Thomas\r\nTyldesley espoused Mary, sister and co-heiress of Sir Alexander Rigby,\r\nof Layton Hall, and had issue—Charles, Fleetwood, James, Agatha, and\r\nWinefrid. Thomas Tyldesley, whilst living at Fox Hall, employed his time\r\nchiefly in field sports, visits amongst the neighbouring gentry, and\r\nfrequent excursions to his more distant friends, as we learn from his\r\ndiary, a portion of which is still preserved. The following extracts from\r\nit will illustrate what formed the favourite recreations of the numerous\r\nwell-to-do families peopling the Fylde at that era:—\r\n\r\n  “May 16, 1712.—In the morning went round the commone a ffowling,\r\n  and Franke Malley, Jo. Hull, and Ned Malley, shoot 12 times for\r\n  one poor twewittee; came home; after dinner Cos. W: W: went with\r\n  me to Thornton Marsh, where we had but bad suckses; tho wee\r\n  killed ffive or six head of ffowle.\r\n\r\n  “May 31, 1712.—Went to yᵉ Hays to see a race between Mr. Harper’s\r\n  mare and Sanderson’s; meet a greatt deal of good company, but\r\n  spent noe thing.\r\n\r\n  “June 7, 1712.—Pd.

Edward\r\nTyldesley, his eldest son, who succeeded him, had two children by his\r\nwife Dorothy—James and Catherine. He was accused, tried, and acquitted\r\nof taking part with the rebels of 1715, although the evidence clearly\r\nconvicted him of having led a body of men against the king’s forces. At\r\nthe death of Edward Tyldesley, in 1725, Myerscough no longer belonged to\r\nthe family, but Holcroft, acquired by marriage in 1679, passed to his son\r\nJames, who twenty years later served with the troops of Prince Charles,\r\nthe younger pretender, and died in 1765. The offspring of James Tyldesley\r\nby Sarah, his wife, were Thomas, Charles, James, Henry, and Jane, all of\r\nwhom with their descendants seem to have sold or mortgaged the remnants\r\nof the once large estates, and gradually drifted into poverty and\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place in concluding the notice of a family\r\nconnected with the earliest infancy of Blackpool, to state something of\r\nthe character and habits of Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, as disclosed\r\nby, and deduced from, the entries in his diary, which unfortunately\r\ncomprises only the last three years of his life. At the present time\r\nthe appearance of a party of gentlemen in this neighbourhood decorated\r\nwith curled wigs, surmounted by three-cornered hats, and habited in\r\nlong-figured waistcoats, plush breeches, and red-heeled boots, would\r\nexcite no little astonishment, yet in the days of the diarist the sight\r\nmust have been one of usual occurrence, for such was the style of costume\r\nworn by the wealthier classes. The lower classes were clothed in garments\r\nmade from the undyed wool of the sheep and called hodden gray.\r\n\r\nThomas Tyldesley was a great equestrian, his journeys being so frequent\r\nand rapid that it is difficult to be certain of his whereabouts when he\r\nfinished his day’s work and its minute record, with the final “soe to\r\nbeed.” He was on terms of intimacy and friendship with the Rigbys of\r\nLayton, the Veales of Whinney Heys, the Westbys of Burn Hall, and all\r\nthe wealthy families in the neighbourhood. Fishing, hunting, coursing,\r\nand shooting were his favourite recreations. Nor was he unmindful in\r\nthe midst of these amusements of the interests of his farm, as the\r\naccompanying remarks amply testify:—“Very bussy all morning in my hay;”\r\nand “Alday in the house and my garden, bussy transplanting colleflowʳ\r\nand cabage plants;” whilst at other times we find him in communication\r\nwith various tenants relative to some portion or other of the Myerscough\r\nproperty. Unless confined to bed by gout or rheumatism, and the\r\nself-imposed, but fearful, “Phissickings” he underwent, swallowing\r\ndoses whose magnitude alone would appal most men of modern days, he\r\nwas ever actively engaged in either business or pleasure. Every item\r\nof disbursement and every circumstance that occurred, even to the most\r\ntrivial, has found a place in his diary, and from it we learn that while\r\nevidently anxious to avoid unnecessary expenditure, he was neither\r\nparsimonious nor illiberal, always recompensing those who had been put\r\nto any trouble on his account, and paying his share of each friendly\r\ngathering with a scrupulous exactness. There is, however, a satisfaction\r\nexpressed in the words, “but spent noe thing,” after the brief notice\r\nof the horse-race he had attended on the Hawes, which, when we call to\r\nmind his natural generosity, showed that his income required care in its\r\nexpenditure, and was barely sufficient to support the position he held\r\nby birth. Many other entries in his diary prove that he was frequently\r\nshort of money, and as his mode of living appears to have been far\r\nfrom extravagant, it seems difficult at first sight to account for the\r\ncircumstance. But when we discover that he had for years been connected,\r\nas one of the leading members and promoters, with a Catholic and Jacobite\r\nSociety at Walton-le-dale, having for its object the restoration of the\r\nStuarts, then in exile, and remember that a scheme of such magnitude and\r\nimportance could not possibly be matured or kept in activity without the\r\npurses of its more earnest supporters suffering to a great extent, we\r\nobtain in some measure an explanation of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe character of Thomas Tyldesley, as gleaned from his diary, may be\r\nsummarised as follows:—He was in every sense a country gentleman, fond of\r\nfield sports, happy on his farm, thoughtful of the condition and comfort\r\nof his cattle, although sometimes given to hard, or at least far, riding;\r\nfor the rest, he was active and intelligent, liberal to his dependants,\r\ncareful in his household, and strictly honourable in all his dealings,\r\nbut above all he had an earnest and deep reverence for his creed and\r\nprinciples that spared no sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEALE OF WHINNEY HEYS.\r\n\r\nThe Veales, of Whinney Heys, who during a time of considerable license\r\nand extravagance, were renowned for their piety and frugality, were\r\ndescended from John Veale, of Mythorp. This gentleman was living during\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, and furnished 1 caliver and 1 morion at the\r\nmilitary muster which took place in 1574. Francis Veale, the son of\r\nJohn Veale, of Mythorp, is the first of the name we find described as\r\nof Whinney Heys.[63] Francis Veale left a son, Edward, who resided\r\nat Whinney Heys, and appeared amongst the list of Free-tenants of\r\nAmounderness in 1621. According to Sir William Dugdale, he was a justice\r\nof the peace for Lancashire in the reigns of James I. and Charles I.\r\nEdward Veale married Ellen, the daughter and co-heiress, with her\r\nyounger sister Alice, of John Massey, of Layton and Carleton, and in\r\nthat way the Veales acquired much of their property in the neighbourhood\r\nof Whinney Heys. The offspring of this union were—John, who was born\r\nin 1605; Massey; Edward; Francis; Singleton; Ellen, who married Thomas\r\nHeardson, of Cambridge; Juliana; Dorothy, who married George Sharples,\r\nof Freckleton; Anne, who became the wife of John Austin, of London;\r\nAlice; and Frances, the wife of William Wombwell, of London. The maiden\r\nname of Mrs. Edward Veale’s mother was Singleton, she being the daughter\r\nof Thomas Singleton, of Staining Hall, and for that reason we find\r\nthe name borne by one of the sons of Edward Veale. John Veale, the\r\neldest son, succeeded to the Hall and estate, and espoused Dorothy, the\r\ndaughter of Matthew Jepson, of Hawkswell, in Yorkshire. John Veale was\r\nfifty-nine years of age in 1664, and at that date entered the names of\r\nhis ancestors, etc., before Sir William Dugdale at Preston, who was\r\non his heraldic visitation in Lancashire. The children of John Veale,\r\nby Dorothy, his wife, were—John, Edward, Helen, Susan, and Jane. John\r\nVeale, who was twenty years old in 1664, became the representative of the\r\nfamily on the decease of his father, some time previous to which he had\r\nmarried Susannah, the daughter of Geoffrey Rishton, of Antley, and by\r\nher had issue—Edward, born in 1680; Ellen, the wife of Richard Sherdley,\r\nof Kirkham, born in 1698; and Dorothy, who died unmarried in 1747, aged\r\n76 years. John Veale was a justice of the peace for this county, and\r\ndied in 1704. After the death of John Veale, whose remains were interred\r\nat Bispham church, Edward, his only son, inherited the lands and Hall\r\nof Whinney Heys. Edward Veale was living at the same time as Thomas\r\nTyldesley, of Fox Hall, Blackpool, and between the two gentlemen a close\r\nfriendship seems to have existed, as we glean from the diary of the\r\nlatter, in which Edward Veale is frequently mentioned, being invariably,\r\nfor some reason, styled Captain,—perhaps he once held that rank in some\r\ntemporary or reserve force, for there is no record of his ever having\r\nbeen connected with the regular troops. The following is a short extract\r\nfrom the above diary in 1712:—\r\n\r\n  “Aug. 2.—Att my returne I wentt to yᵉ King’s Arms, and got my\r\n  dinʳ with Broʳ. We spent 1s. a pice in whitte wine, and as wee\r\n  went through yᵉ hall met with Just. Longworth,[64] Capᵗᵗ Veale,\r\n  Just. Pearson, Franke Nickinson, and small Lᵈ of Roshall.[65] Wee\r\n  were very merry upon yᵉ small Lord, and spent 1s. a pice in sack\r\n  and white wine, wʰ elevated yᵉ petite Lᵈ that before he went to\r\n  bed he tucke yᵉ ffriedom of biting his man Sharocke’s thumb off\r\n  just beyond yᵉ nail. I found cos. W: W: att home.”\r\n\r\nEdward left issue at his death in 1723, at forty-three years of age—John,\r\nSarah, and Susannah. John Veale, the heir, entered into holy orders, and\r\nsubsequently died unmarried. Sarah and Susannah Veale, the co-heiresses\r\nof their brother, married respectively Edward Fleetwood, of Rossall Hall\r\n(the small lord), and John Fayle, of the Holmes, Thornton, who erected\r\nBridge House in Bispham, after the model of the original Hall of Whinney\r\nHeys. The lands and residence of Whinney Heys eventually passed into the\r\npossession of the Fleetwoods, of Rossall, through the wife of Edward\r\nFleetwood. The Veales were Puritans in religion, and one of the family,\r\nnamed Edward Veale, whose father was the third son of Edward and Ellen\r\nVeale mentioned above, and a lay member of the Presbyterian Classis for\r\nthis district in the time of the Commonwealth, attained considerable\r\neminence, first as a Puritan preacher and afterwards as a Nonconformist\r\nminister. Calamy, in his _Nonconformist Memorial_, tells us that “Mr.\r\nEdward Veale, of Christ Church, Oxford, afterwards of Trinity College,\r\nDublin, was ordained at Winwick in Lancashire, August 4th, 1657. When he\r\nleft Ireland he brought with him a testimonial of his being ‘a learned,\r\northodox minister, of a sober, pious, and peaceable conversation, who\r\nduring his abode at the college was eminently useful for the instruction\r\nof youth, and whose ministry had been often exercised in and about\r\nthe city of Dublin with great satisfaction to the godly, until he was\r\ndeprived of his fellowship for nonconformity to the ceremonies imposed\r\nin the church, and for joining with other ministers in their endeavours\r\nfor a reformation;’ signed by Richard Charnock and six other respectable\r\nministers. He became chaplain to Sir William Waller, in Middlesex, and\r\nafterwards settled as a Nonconformist pastor in Wapping, where he lived\r\nto a good old age. He had several pupils, to whom he read university\r\nlearning, who were afterwards useful persons; one of whom was Mr.\r\nNathaniel Taylor. He died June 6th, 1708, aged 76. His funeral sermon was\r\npreached by Mr. T. Symonds, who succeeded him.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTBY OF MOWBRECK HALL AND BURN HALL.[66]\r\n\r\nThe family of this name, so long associated with the township of\r\nMedlar-with-Wesham, in the parish of Kirkham, is descended from the\r\nWestbys of Westby, in the county of York.\r\n\r\nWilliam Westby, who was under-sheriff of Lancashire in 1345, is the first\r\nof the name, we can find, residing at Mowbreck; and a great-grandson of\r\nhis, named William Westby, is recorded as inheriting the Mowbreck and\r\nWestby property in the reign of Henry VI., 1422-61. John Westby, the\r\nson of the latter William, succeeded to the estates, residing, like his\r\nancestors, at Mowbreck Hall, and was twice married, the offspring of\r\nthe first union, with Mabill, daughter of Richard Botiler, being two\r\ndaughters; and of the second, with Eleanor Kirkby, of Rawcliffe, a son\r\nand heir, named William, who succeeded him at his death in 1512. William\r\nWestby, although the lawful holder of the estates, did not obtain control\r\nover them until after 1517, being a minor at that date. He married\r\nElizabeth Rigmayden, of Wedacer, and had issue—John, Elizabeth, and\r\nHelen. John Westby, the heir, had possession of Mowbreck, and Burn in\r\nThornton township, about the year 1556, after the decease of his father;\r\nhis places of residence were Mowbreck and Burn Halls. He was thrice\r\nmarried, and by his last wife, Ann, daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux,\r\nof Sefton and Larbrick, and widow of Thomas Dalton, of Thurnham, had\r\nissue—John, Thomas, William, Ellen, and Mary. John Westby succeeded his\r\nfather in 1591, and dying unmarried in 1604, was in his turn succeeded\r\nby his brother, Thomas Westby, who was twice married, and purchased the\r\nestate of Whitehall, where the children of his second union established\r\nthemselves. The offspring of his first wife, Perpetua, daughter of Edward\r\nNorris, of Speke, were—John, Thomas, Edward, William, Francis, Margaret,\r\nPerpetua, and Anne. John Westby, the heir, came into the Mowbreck estate\r\nand Burn Hall some time after 1622, but dying without issue in 1661, was\r\nsucceeded by his nephew, Thomas, the eldest son of his fourth brother,\r\nFrancis Westby, Thomas Westby, M.D., slain in the civil wars, and his two\r\nother brothers, Edward and William, having died childless. Thomas Westby,\r\nthe inheritor of Westby, Mowbreck, and Burn, was born in 1641, and\r\nespoused Bridget, daughter of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham Hall, his issue\r\nbeing John, Thomas, William, Cuthbert, Robert, Francis, Bridget, Anne,\r\nand Dorothy. John Westby, the eldest son, inherited Westby, Mowbreck, and\r\nBurn Hall, on the demise of his father in 1700. Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox\r\nHall, was intimate with this gentleman, as observed from the following\r\nentry in his diary in the year 1715:—\r\n\r\n  “June primo.—Went to Mains to prayers; thence with Jack Westby to\r\n  Burn to dinner; stayed till 4; thence to Whinneyheys; stayed till\r\n  9; soe home.”\r\n\r\nJohn Westby married, in 1688, Jane, daughter of Christopher Parker,\r\nof Bradkirk Hall, and had issue four daughters—Catherine, who married\r\nAlexander Osbaldeston, of Sunderland; Bridget, the wife of William\r\nShuttleworth, of Turnover Hall; Mary, the wife of the Rev. Thomas\r\nAlderson; and Anne, the wife of the Rev. J. Bennison, of London. At\r\nthe death of John Westby in 1722, Burn Hall and estate passed to the\r\nBennisons, whilst Mowbreck became the property of Thomas Westby, who died\r\nchildless six years later, and afterwards of Robert Westby, brothers of\r\nthe deceased John Westby. Margaret Shuttleworth, the daughter of William\r\nand Bridget Shuttleworth, of Turnover, married her cousin, Thomas Westby,\r\nof Whitehall, in 1744, and had numerous offspring, the eldest of whom,\r\nJohn Westby, succeeded to Mowbreck, as heir-at-law, on the death of his\r\nrelative, Robert Westby, before mentioned, in 1762. This John Westby\r\ndied in 1811 unmarried, and was succeeded by his only surviving brother,\r\nThomas Westby. This gentleman also died unmarried, and was succeeded\r\nin 1829 in the Turnover Hall estate, by his cousin, Thomas Westby,\r\nheir-at-law, to whose eldest son, George Westby, he left Whitehall and\r\nMowbreck. George Westby espoused Mary Pauton, the eldest daughter of\r\nMajor John Tate, of the 6th West Indian Infantry, and had issue—Mary\r\nVirginia Ann; Matilda Julia, wife of the Rev. Dr. Henry Hayman; Jocelyn\r\nTate; Ada Perpetua; Georgina Blanche; Ashley George, late captain in\r\nthe army; Cuthbert Menzies; Bernard Hægar, captain 16th regiment; Basil\r\nClifton, captain 16th regiment. George Westby died at Paris in 1842, and\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest son, Jocelyn Tate, the present holder, who\r\ntook by royal license the name and arms of Fazakerley on espousing, in\r\n1862, Matilda Harriette Gillibrand-Fazakerley sister and co-heiress of\r\nthe late Henry Hawarden Gillibrand-Fazakerley, the son of Henry Hawarden\r\nFazakerley, of Gillibrand Hall, etc., and lord of the manor of Chorley.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Tate Fazakerley-Westby, of Mowbreck Hall, esq., was formerly a\r\ncornet in the Scotch Greys, and is now a captain of Lancashire hussars,\r\nyeomanry cavalry. He is a justice of the peace and a deputy-lieutenant of\r\nthe county of Lancaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPARISH OF POULTON-LE-FYLDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTON. The ancient town and port of Poulton occupies the summit of\r\na gentle ascent about one mile removed from the waters of Wyre at\r\nSkippool, and three from the Irish Sea at Blackpool. Between 1080 and\r\n’86, Poltun, as it was written in the Norman Survey, contained no more\r\nthan two carucates of land under tillage, or in an arable condition,\r\nso that out of the 900 acres composing the township, only 200 were\r\ncultivated by the inhabitants. A considerable proportion of the entire\r\narea of the township, however, would be covered with lofty trees, and\r\nprovide excellent forage ground for large herds of swine, which formed\r\nthe chief live-stock dealt in by our Anglo-Saxon and early Norman\r\nancestors. Taking this into consideration, the comparatively small amount\r\nof soil devoted to agriculture, may not, indeed, indicate so meagre\r\na population about the close of the eleventh century as otherwise it\r\nwould seem to do, but still the evidence adduced is barely sufficient\r\nwhereon to base the assumption that the antecedents of Poulton had been\r\nless under the destructive influence of the Danes than those of its\r\nneighbours. Regarding the locality more retrospectively, and turning\r\nback, for a brief space, to the era of the Romans, it must be admitted\r\nthat nothing has as yet been discovered which could be construed into an\r\nintimation that the followers of Agricola, or their descendants, ever had\r\na settlement or encampment on the site. It is true that the churchyard\r\nhas yielded up many specimens of their ancient coinage, whilst others\r\nhave been found at no great distance, but the character of the relics\r\nis in no way suggestive of a sojournment, like that of the fragmentary\r\ndomestic utensils and urns of Kirkham; and when it is remembered that the\r\nmuch-used Roman road (Dane’s Pad) leading to the most important harbour\r\nof the west coast, passed through the vicinity on its way towards the\r\nWarren of Rossall, the explanation of the presence of the coins, as\r\nof other antiquities along its line, is obvious. The name of the town\r\nand district now under examination is of pure Anglo-Saxon origin, and\r\nacquired from its proximity to the pool of the Skipton, or Skippool,\r\nthe signification of the word being, it is scarcely necessary to add,\r\nthe enclosure or township of the pool. The date at which habitations\r\nfirst became visible on the soil must remain in a great measure a matter\r\nof conjecture, as the annals of history are silent respecting this and\r\nmost other towns of Amounderness, until the arrival of William the\r\nConqueror, but we may safely infer that it was not long after the advent\r\nof the Saxons before a situation so convenient both to the stream of\r\nWyre and the frequented pathway just mentioned, attracted a small colony\r\nof settlers. Whatever century gave birth to Poulton, it is certain\r\nthat from such epoch to 1066, the population would be constituted,\r\nalmost exclusively, of the class known as “Villani,” perhaps most\r\nappropriately interpreted by our term villagers, and that the occupation\r\nof these bondsmen of the soil would be the tillage of the land and the\r\nsuperintendence of swine. Their huts were doubtless of very rude and\r\nprimitive construction, but somewhere within the boundaries of the\r\ntownship there must have been a dwelling of more pretentious exterior,\r\nthe residence of the Town-Reve, who received the dues and tolls from\r\nthe “Villani,” on behalf of the large territorial lord, and exercised\r\na general supervision over them. Athelstan appears to have held the\r\nlordship of the whole of Amounderness in 936, when he conveyed it to the\r\nSee of York, and possibly before he ascended the throne it was invested\r\nsuccessively in his regal predecessors.\r\n\r\nAfter the Conquest, Poulton passed into the possession of the Norman\r\nnobleman, Roger de Poictou, by whom it was granted in 1094, to the\r\npriory of St. Mary, at Lancaster. “He gave,” says the charter, “Poltun\r\nin Agmundernesia, and whatsoever belonged to it, and the church with\r\none carucate of land, and all other things belonging to it; moreover\r\nhe gave the tithe of venison and of pawnage[67] in all the woods, and\r\nthe tithe of his fishery.”[68] This extract proves beyond question\r\nthe existence of a church at Poulton exactly eight years after the\r\ncompletion of the Domesday record; and further, that it was endowed with\r\none carucate of land, or half the cultivated portion of the township.\r\nAt the first glance it seems more probable that the sacred edifice was\r\noverlooked by the investigators in the course of the survey than that\r\nit was erected so shortly afterwards, but a study of other pages of the\r\nregister betrays such evident care and minuteness on the part of those to\r\nwhom the work of compilation was entrusted, that it appears impossible\r\nfor an important building like the church to have escaped their notice.\r\nRoger de Poictou was justly celebrated for zeal in the cause of his\r\nfaith; several monastic institutions owed their establishment to his\r\nliberality, and amongst them was St. Mary’s of Lancaster. It will\r\ntherefore be but a reasonable conclusion to arrive at, that he built and\r\nendowed the parish church of Poulton with the intention of presenting\r\nit to the Priory of his own founding, in connection with the abbey of\r\nSees in Normandy. During the reign of Richard I. (1189-99), Theobald\r\nWalter quitclaimed to the abbot of Sees all his right to the advowson of\r\nPoulton and the church of Bispham, owing to a suit instituted against\r\nhim by that ecclesiastic;[69] and hence it must be inferred that the\r\ndonation of Roger de Poictou had through some cause reverted to him,\r\nbeing subsequently conferred on Walter in company with other of the\r\nconfiscated estates of the rebellious baron. The abbot of Cockersand\r\nalso had some interest in the town about the time the last event took\r\nplace, and in about 1216 he compounded with the prior of Lancaster for\r\ncertain tithes held by him in the parish.[70] In 1246 the mediety of the\r\nchurch of Poulton and the chapel of Bispham was granted by the archdeacon\r\nof Richmond to the priory of St. Mary, and half a century later John\r\nRomanus, archdeacon of Richmond, confirmed the gift, bestowing on it in\r\naddition the remaining mediety, to be received when death had removed\r\nthe present holder. A clause in the document stipulated that immediately\r\nthe second mediety had been appropriated a vicar should be appointed at\r\na salary of twenty marks (£13 6s. 8d.) per annum.[71] Here again it is\r\nclear that some time in the interval between 1199 and 1246 the lands and\r\nliving of Poulton had once more been forfeited or disposed of by the\r\nLancaster monastery, but in the absence of any records bearing on the\r\nsubject, the manner and reason of the relinquishment must still continue\r\nenveloped in a veil of mystery. From 1246 the vicarage of Poulton\r\nremained attached to the Lancaster foundation until the dissolution of\r\nalien priories, when it was conveyed to the abbey of Sion, in Middlesex,\r\nand retained by that convent up to the time of the Reformation in 1536.\r\nAlien priories, it may be explained, were small monastic institutions\r\nconnected with the abbeys of Normandy, and established on lands which had\r\nbeen granted or bequeathed to the parent houses by William the Conqueror\r\nor one of his followers. They were occupied by only a very limited number\r\nof brethren and members of the sisterhood. A prior was appointed over\r\neach, his chief duty being to collect the rents and other monies due from\r\ntheir estates, etc., and transmit them over to Normandy. Such immense\r\nsums were in that way annually exported out of the country, that it was\r\nultimately deemed expedient by the king and his ministers to suppress all\r\npriories of this description.\r\n\r\nThe Banastres were a family long connected with the Fylde through landed\r\nproperty which they held in the neighbourhood; originally they are\r\nstated to have come over from Normandy with William the Conqueror, and\r\nto have settled at Newton in the Willows. On their frequent journeys to\r\nand from Thornton, Singleton, and Staining, the tenants of the priory of\r\nSt. Mary were in the habit of crossing over the lands of the Banastres,\r\nby whom their intrusions were deeply resented, which led to constant\r\nfeuds between them and the head of the Lancaster monastery. In 1276, as\r\nwe learn from the “Regist. S. Mariæ de Lanc.,” Sir Adam Banastre with\r\nseveral of his friends and retainers, amongst whom were John Wenne,\r\nRichard le Demande (the collector), William de Thorneton, Richard de\r\nBrockholes, Geoffrey le Procuratoure (the proctor), and Adam le Reve (the\r\nreeve), attacked the prior, Ralph de Truno, and his train of attendants,\r\nwhen on their way to Poulton. They seized and carried off both him\r\nand his retinue to Thornton, where, after treating them with great\r\nindignity, they chastised and imprisoned them. Edward I., on hearing of\r\nthe disgraceful outrage, appointed John Travers, William de Tatham, and\r\nJohn de Horneby to investigate the matter and ascertain the cause, if\r\npossible; but no paper is now to be found revealing the result of the\r\nexamination or hinting at the provocation, although a surmise may be\r\nhazarded that it was no new quarrel, but simply the old feud, which had\r\nat last culminated in a cowardly assault on a defenseless ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\nIn 1299, Poulton was held in trust by Thomas, earl of Lancaster, for\r\nthe prior of St. Mary; and eight years anterior to that date the abbot\r\nof Deulacres, in Staffordshire, drew certain revenues from land in the\r\ntownship, viz., £8 per annum from 16 carucates of land, about 13s. 4d.\r\neach year from the sale of meadow land, 10s. from assessed rents, and\r\n£5 from the profit of stock, making in all an annual total of £14 3s.\r\n4d. The repeated disputes between Sir Adam Banastre and Adam Conrates,\r\nprior of Lancaster, relative to the trespasses of the latter’s tenants\r\nand the collection of tithes on the domains of the former were peaceably\r\nsettled in 1330, by an arrangement, in which Sir Adam pledged himself to\r\nallow two good roads across his lands—one from Poulton and Thornton to\r\nSkippool and thence across the ford of Aldwath, now called Shard, on to\r\nSingleton, the other starting from the same localities and running to\r\nthe ford of Bulk higher up the river, probably the modern Cartford, or\r\nin its vicinity; in addition the knight agreed to make good any damage\r\nthat the prior or his dependants might suffer over that portion of their\r\njourneys.[72] Adam Conrates on his side promised to withdraw all actions\r\nfor trespass, etc., on the fulfilment of these conditions. In 1354 a\r\nperson named Robert de Pulton held some small possessions in Poulton, but\r\nnothing further than that trifling fact is recorded about him, although\r\nit is probable from the orthography of his name that his ancestors\r\nwere at some time closely and honourably associated with the town\r\nfrom which their distinctive appellation appears to have been derived.\r\nDuring the time of Elizabeth, James Massey, gentleman, of Carleton and\r\nLayton, purchased from the governors of the Savoy Hospital, in London,\r\nthe tolls in the parish of Poulton, together with all the “chauntry and\r\nappurtenances” founded in the parish church of Bricksworth, and all\r\nmessuages, lands, tenements, etc., situated in the town and parish of\r\nPoulton; the tolls remained subject to an annual rent of £2, to be paid\r\non St. Michael’s day to the governors and chaplains of the hospital.\r\nLater in the same reign James Massey sold to William Leigh, esq., of High\r\nLeigh, in Cheshire, half of these tolls and some pasture fields, called\r\n“Angell’s Holme,” adjoining the Horse-bridge, where in earlier days,\r\nwhen the waters of Wyre made their way along a brook into the interior\r\nof this neighbourhood, boats are said to have been built. The Rigbys, of\r\nLayton Hall, subsequently became possessed of a great part of Poulton,\r\nand at the present day a large number of houses are leased in their name\r\nfor the remainder of terms of 999 years; the Heskeths, of Mains, and\r\nother leading families in the district were also considerable property\r\nowners in the town. On one occasion the ruling powers of Kirkham made an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to obtain the tolls arising from the cattle fairs\r\nheld in Poulton and Singleton, but on what plea such claims were urged\r\nthe record is silent.\r\n\r\nIn an entry which occurs in the lists of the Norman Roll, an impost\r\nconsisting of the ninth of corn, fleeces, and lambs, and created in 9\r\nEdward III., 1336, it is stated that in 1291 the vicarage of Poulton\r\nwas taxed by Pope Nicholas at 10 marks, or £6 13s. 4d. modern coinage,\r\nthe prior of Norton taking £2 in garbs or wheat sheaves. Afterwards\r\nthe vicarage was freed from the payments of tenths on account of the\r\nsmallness of the living. Dr. Whittaker informs us that the priory of\r\nLancaster was granted by Henry V., in 1422, to the chancellor of England,\r\nwho in that year instituted a vicar to the living of Poulton, but eight\r\nyears previously, in the same reign, the priory was granted in trust\r\nfor the abbess and convent of Sion; from which seemingly contradictory\r\nstatements it may be gathered that the chancellor was the trustee for\r\nthe property, and in such capacity alone acted as patron of the church\r\nof Poulton. In support of this supposition may be cited the fact\r\nthat the Lancaster house and its belongings were not received by the\r\nconvent in Middlesex until 1431, during the sovereignty of Henry VI.,\r\nwhen the vicarage was endowed by the abbess, and William de Croukeshagh\r\npresented to the living. This pastor, the earliest personally mentioned,\r\nwas succeeded on his death, in 1442, by Richard Brown, appointed by\r\nthe same convent. “Among the records,” writes Baines in his history of\r\nLancashire, “in the Augmentation Office is in indenture tripartite in\r\nEnglish, bearing the date 11 Henry VIII., 1579, and purporting to be made\r\nbetween the Abbess of Sion on the first part, Thomas Singleton and Henry\r\nSingleton on the second part, and William Bretherton, vicar of Poulton,\r\non the third part, by which the tithe-sheaf of Pulton and a tenement are\r\nleased to the vicar, that he may better keep and maintain his house in\r\nPulton; the term to continue during the existence of a lease granted to\r\nthe persons named Singleton by Sion abbey.” At the Reformation the manor\r\nand advowson were claimed by the crown, and a few years later became the\r\nproperty of the Fleetwoods. The last royal presentation to the living was\r\nmade by Edward VI. in 1552, just one year before his death, whilst the\r\nfirst by this family was in 1565, by John Fleetwood, lord of the manor of\r\nPenwortham. The Rev. Charles Hesketh, M.A., of North Meols, is now the\r\npatron.\r\n\r\nThe ancient church of Poulton stood on the site now occupied by the\r\nexisting edifice, and like it, was dedicated to the Saxon St. Chad\r\nor Cheadda, bishop of Mercia, and seated at Chester in A.D. 669. The\r\noriginal structure consisted of only a nave and north aisle, the outer\r\nwalls of which were composed of sandstone, whilst the double roof rested\r\non semicircular arches, extending from the chancel to the font, and\r\nsupported on four octagonal pillars. These semicircular arches belonged\r\nto a very antique style of architecture, and have given rise to the\r\nbelief that the pillars were at first massive cylinders, being carved\r\ninto an angular form about the time of Henry VIII. The pulpit had its\r\nplace towards the south, and at the east end there appears to have been\r\na small gallery. A pipe clay monument _in memoriam_ of the Singletons,\r\nof Staining, stood inside the church, but was, intentionally or\r\naccidentally, destroyed when the building was pulled down. A rude brass\r\ncrucifix and a chalice, both of which belonged to the church previous to\r\nthe Reformation, are still preserved, one being in the possession of\r\na late priest at Breck chapel, and the other in the Catholic chapel at\r\nClaughton. The upper halves of the windows, including the east one, were\r\nsemicircular in form. In 1622 the old chancel was repaired by the Rev.\r\nPeter Whyte, the vicar, and a stone, two feet in length and one foot and\r\na half in depth, bearing the name “Peter Whyte,” and the date “1622,” in\r\nraised letters about six inches long, was placed over the east window.\r\nThis piece of masonry now occupies a situation in the south-west corner\r\nof the edifice. The churchyard, which is reported to have been usually\r\nin a filthy and disgraceful state, was partly surrounded by a moderately\r\nwide ditch, on the brink of which three or four fine sycamore trees\r\nflourished, but were cut down when sundry alterations and improvements\r\nwere effected in the ground. In 1751, after the old church had been\r\nstanding six centuries and a half, it was determined to demolish it,\r\nand erect a more commodious building on the site. The tower, however,\r\nwas retained, as, being of more recent date, it evinced none of those\r\nsymptoms of decay which had rendered the body of the edifice dangerous to\r\nworshippers. An opinion prevails that the tower was built about the time\r\nof Charles I., and such a view is upheld by the discovery on the removal\r\nof the pulpit in 1836 of a square stone, having on its face the raised\r\nletters TB. WG. in the first line, IH. TG. IH. in the second line, and\r\nWG. 1638 in the last line. It is supposed that this stone, which is now\r\nfixed in the wall at the south-west corner of the church, was carved in\r\ncommemoration of the erection of the tower, and the raised letters are\r\nthe initials of the churchwardens then in office, and the date when the\r\nwork was accomplished. Between this stone and the one previously referred\r\nto, there is a stained-glass memorial window to “Robert Buck, born\r\n1805, died 1862, presented by his sister, C. D. Foxton.” Mrs. Catherine\r\nDauntesy Foxton, the lady here indicated, is the representative of the\r\nfamily of Bucks, of Agecroft Hall, Pendlebury, and inherited considerable\r\nproperty in the neighbourhood of Poulton. During the time the new\r\nchurch was in course of building, divine service was performed in the\r\ntithe-barn, and the ceremony of baptism at the residences of the parents.\r\nThe funds required for carrying out the important undertaking were\r\ndoubtless chiefly supplied through the munificence of a comparatively\r\nsmall circle of private individuals, whose contributions would probably\r\nbe in some measure supplemented by minor collections amongst the less\r\nopulent agriculturists and peasantry. One person, named Welsh, who\r\nresided at Marton, seems to have cherished a bitter antipathy to the\r\nlevelling of ancient structures in general, and embodied his refusal to\r\nassist this particular work in the following rhymes:—\r\n\r\n  “While here on earth I do abide,\r\n  I’ll keep up walls and pull down pride;\r\n  To build anew I’ll ne’er consent,\r\n  And make the needy poor lament.”\r\n\r\nIt has usually been affirmed that the side galleries were not erected\r\nuntil several years after the new church had been finished, but the\r\nannexed extract from an old document discovered in 1875, shows that\r\nauthority to build them was obtained in 1751, whilst the church\r\nwas levelled with the ground; and as the parchment also discloses\r\nthat a number of seats in these galleries were allotted to certain\r\ngentlemen of the parish in the ensuing year, there is ample evidence\r\nthat the rebuilding of the church and their erection were carried on\r\nsimultaneously:—“25 June, 1751. On the Certificate and request of Roger\r\nHesketh, Esq., Patron; the Rev. Robert Loxham, Clerk, Vicar; and the\r\nChurchwardens of the Parish Church of Poulton; a Faculty was Granted to\r\nJohn Bird, John Birley, and Richard Tennant, all of Poulton, Gentlemen\r\n(for the better uniformity of the Parish Church of Poulton, which was\r\nthen taken down and rebuilding) to take down the Gallery over the\r\nChancel in the East of the said Church, which was then very irregular\r\nand incommodious, and to rebuild the same with a convenient staircase,\r\nstairs, and passage leading thereto, of their own expense, in the west\r\nend thereof to adjoin to the north side of the gallery there then\r\nstanding, and to be made uniform therewith, and to make satisfaction\r\nto the several owners of the seats in the said Gallery for the damage\r\nsustained in removing the same and altering, and lessening the seats\r\ntherein; and to erect a Gallery on each side of the said Church, with\r\nconvenient staircases leading thereto at the north-east and south-east\r\nends of the said Church, if necessary, according to the form of the said\r\nCertificate annexed, and also to remove the Pulpit and reading desk from\r\nthe place where the same then lately stood, near to the place where the\r\nChurchwardens’ seat was then lately situate, as it would greatly tend to\r\nthe conformity of the said Church and to the benefit and advantage of the\r\nInhabitants of the said Parish, and also that they might have liberty to\r\nsell and dispose of the seats to be contained in the said intended side\r\nGalleries, to such persons within the said Parish as should stand most in\r\nneed thereof, to reimburse themselves the charges and expenses they would\r\nbe necessarily put to in building the said intended galleries and making\r\nthe alterations aforesaid.”\r\n\r\nThe present edifice is of stone, plain but commodious, and comprises\r\na chancel, body, and embattled tower, with buttresses supporting each\r\ncorner. Formerly a small shed stood on one side of the tower, and was\r\nused as a repository for the sculls and other osseous relics of humanity,\r\nwhich were unearthed during the process of making fresh graves; this\r\nhouse was pulled down some years ago, and its numerous treasures returned\r\nto the ground at the south-east corner of the yard. The chancel now\r\nstanding was erected eight years since, mainly through the exertions\r\nof the Rev. Thomas Clarke, M.A., the vicar, who died in 1869. On the\r\nexterior of the building, over a door at the south-east corner of the\r\nbody is the inscription:—“Insignia Rici Fleetwood Ari Hujus Eccliæ\r\nPatroni Ann Dni 1699”; above which is a circumscribed uneven space\r\nformerly occupied by the arms of the Fleetwood family. Within the church\r\nthe quarterings of the Heskeths and Fleetwoods are hung against the walls\r\nin frames. At the west end of the building there is a wooden panel into\r\nwhich the following names have been cut:—\r\n\r\n  Rich. Dickson.\r\n  Rich. Willson.\r\n  John Hull.\r\n  Rich. Willson.\r\n  John Woodhouse, churchwardens, 1730.\r\n\r\nFrom the way in which the holders of similar offices are arranged at\r\npresent it is surmised that these gentlemen respectively represented the\r\ntownships of\r\n\r\n  Poulton.\r\n  Carleton.\r\n  Hardhorn.\r\n  Thornton.\r\n  Marton.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the church is a mural tablet to the memory of the\r\nRev. Richard Buck, M.A., of Agecroft Hall, Pendlebury, born 1761, died\r\n1845, also Margaret, his wife, and Margaret, his daughter. Another\r\nmonument bears the names of Frances Hull, born 1794, died 1847; William\r\nWilson Hull, born 1822, died 1847, in the Queen’s service, at Bathurst,\r\nSt. Mary’s Island in the river Gambia; Henry Mitchell Hull, M.A., born\r\n1827, died 1853; John Hull, M.D., born 1761, died 1843—“left the eldest\r\nof the three children of John Hull, surgeon; an orphan at six years of\r\nage, poor, friendless, by the best use of all means of education within\r\nhis power, by unwearied industry, by constant self-denial, he duly\r\nqualified himself for the practice of his profession[73]”; Sarah Hull,\r\ndied 1842; William Winstanley Hull, M.A., Fellow of Brazenose College,\r\nOxford, and Barrister-at-Law, eldest son of John Hull, M.D., F.L.S.,\r\nborn 1784, died 1873. Here also was the old churchwardens’ pew, removed\r\nin 1876, having a brass plate inscribed thus:—“Thomas Whiteside, Jno\r\nWilkinson, Jno Whiteside, Thos. Cornwhite, Jno Hodgson, Churchwardens,\r\n1737”; also the old pew formerly belonging to the Rigbys of Layton Hall,\r\non the door of which are carved the letters “A.R.,” a goats head, and\r\nthe date “1636,” being the initials and crest of Sir Alexander Rigby, of\r\nLayton Hall. Until last year, when they were removed to afford space for\r\nmore modern seats, the two family pews of the Fleetwoods and Heskeths\r\nstood on this side. The pews were walled in laterally and in front by\r\na high ornamental railing of oak, and in the larger of the two traces\r\nof a crest were visible on the wall. Near this spot there are many very\r\nancient pews, one of which has the date and initials “17.TW.02” carved\r\nupon it, whilst on the floor of the aisle close at hand is the gravestone\r\nof “Edward Sherdley, gentleman, dyed 21st September, 1744, aged 71,” and\r\nalmost adjoining lies another stone, surmounting the remains of Geoffrey\r\nHornby, who died in 1732. On the day of the latter gentleman’s funeral\r\nthe west side of the market-place was destroyed by fire, and as the\r\nprocession passed the scarves of the mourners were scorched by sparks\r\ndriven by a high wind in showers from the conflagration. On the north\r\nside of the church is a pew bearing the date ‘1662’; and near to are the\r\nold pews of Burn Hall, Little Poulton Hall, Mains Hall, and Todderstaff\r\nHall, above which, fastened to the wall and marking the resting place\r\nof several members of his family, are the arms of Thomas Fitzherbert\r\nBrockholes, esq., of Claughton, the lord of Little Poulton, etc.\r\n\r\nThe chancel contains a monument in memory of Bold Fleetwood Hesketh, died\r\n1819, and his nephew, Edward Thomas Hesketh, died 1820; also of Fleetwood\r\nHesketh, of Rossall, who died in 1769, aged 30, and Frances Hesketh, who\r\ndied in 1809, aged 74, all of whom were interred beneath the Communion.\r\nIn addition there are two recent tablets, one being to the memory of\r\nthe late Thomas Clarke, vicar of the parish; and the other in memory of\r\nFrancis Wm. Conry, only child of F. A. Macfaddin, surgeon, 47th regt.\r\nWithin the Communion rails are two antique and elaborately carved oak\r\nchairs.\r\n\r\nIn the south gallery are mural tablets inscribed in remembrance of Edward\r\nHornby, died in 1766, and Margaret, his wife; Edward Sherdley, died 1744,\r\nand Ellen, his wife; Giles Thornber, J.P., died 1860, and his wife;\r\nGeoffrey Hornby, died in 1732, and Susannah, his wife; Richard Harrison,\r\nvicar of Poulton, died in 1718, aged 65; and Christopher Albin, curate\r\nof Bispham, died in 1753, aged 56, on a pew door opposite to which is a\r\nbrass plate engraved:—“Introite et orate, cælo supinas si tuleris manus\r\nsacra feceris, malaque effugies.[74] Christopher and Margery Albin 1752.”\r\n\r\nAt one time a sounding board was suspended over the pulpit. An ancient\r\nfont, formerly belonging to the church and now the property of the\r\nvicar, the Rev. William Richardson, M.A., has carved upon its exterior\r\nthe date 1649, the letters M.H., a cross, and something, in its damaged\r\nstate difficult to trace but betraying some resemblance to a crown. The\r\nsuccessor to this font was removed several years since to make room\r\nfor a new one presented by the daughter of the Rev. Canon Hull, of\r\nEaglescliffe, in memory of her sister Frances Mary Hull, who died in\r\n1866, aged 20 years.\r\n\r\nThe old church books, extracts from which will be given subsequently,\r\ncontain many entries of sums paid for rushes to strew the pews and\r\naisles, a custom existing here as late as 1813. In the tower is a peal of\r\nsix bells, with the inscriptions:—\r\n\r\n  1st Bell.—“Prosperity to all our Benefactors.      A. R. 1741.\r\n  2nd. ”   —“Peace and good Neighbourhood.           A. R. 1741.\r\n  3rd. ”   —“Prosperity to this Parish.              A. R. 1741.\r\n  4th. ”   —“When us you ring\r\n              We’ll sweetly sing.                    A. R. 1741.\r\n  5th. ”   —“Able Rudhall\r\n              Cast us all.               M. T. Gloucester. 1741.”[75]\r\n\r\nThe 6th bell was recast by G. Mears and Company, of London, in 1865,\r\nat the sole expense of the Rev. T. Clarke, and is inscribed:—“T.\r\nClarke, M.A., vicar; W. Gaulter, J. T. Bailey, W. Jolly, J. Whiteside,\r\nchurchwardens.” The original inscription was—“Robert Fishwick, John\r\nWilkinson, William Cookson, James Hull, John Moore, churchwardens.”\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years since the roof of the church was altered and renewed.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the churchyard has been in constant use\r\nfor so many centuries very few emblems of antiquity, beyond occasional\r\ncoins of the Roman era, have ever been discovered in it, and at present,\r\nunlike most burial grounds of great age, no specimens of raised letters\r\nare to be seen amongst the numerous gravestones, the oldest of which\r\nstill legible, intimates the resting place of Richard Elston, and has\r\nthe date 1719. At a short distance, and assisting to flag a side pathway\r\nto the south of the church, is another stone, covering the grave of\r\n“Richard Brown, of Great Marton, who died the third day of April, 1723”;\r\nbut neither this nor the foregoing one have any interest beyond their\r\nantiquity. The ancient practice of tolling the Curfew-bell is still\r\ncontinued in the winter evenings from the 29th of September to the 10th\r\nof March, whilst a pancake bell is rung at 12 o’clock on each Shrove\r\nTuesday.[76]\r\n\r\n  VICARS OF POULTON-LE-FYLDE.\r\n\r\n  IN THE DEANERY OF AMOUNDERNESS AND ARCHDEACONRY OF LANCASTER.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------------------+---------------------+----------------\r\n    Date of   |     VICARS.       |     On whose        | Cause of\r\n  Institution.|                   |   Presentation.     | vacancy.\r\n  ------------+-------------------+---------------------+----------------\r\n  In 1431     |Wm. de Croukeshagh |Abbot and Convent    |\r\n              |                   |  of Sion            |\r\n  ”  1442     |Richard Brown      |Ditto                |\r\n  Before 1519 |William Bretherton |Ditto                |\r\n  In 1552     |Ranulph Woodward   |Edward VI.           |\r\n              |Richard Cropper    |                     |\r\n  ”  1565     |Wm.

Peter Whyte, of whose immediate descendants it is recorded\r\nthat, after his death, they rapidly drifted into poverty, and that one\r\nof them, a granddaughter, regularly attended the fairs of Poulton as\r\nthe wife of a pedlar or hawker. The Rev. Richard Harrison was cousin to\r\nCuthbert Harrison, the Nonconformist divine who suffered ejection, and\r\nbelonged to the Bankfield family. Until instituted to Poulton, Richard\r\nHarrison was curate at Goosnargh. His son Paul gained some celebrity as\r\na controversial writer on matters of ecclesiastical interest.[78] The\r\nLoxhams settled at Dowbridge, near Kirkham, and that estate is still held\r\nby the family. The Rev. Thomas Turner purchased the living in 1770, when\r\nit was worth no more than £75 per annum, for £200, and held it until\r\nhis death forty years later. The Rev. C. Hesketh, M.A., brother to the\r\nlate Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, bart., is rector of North Meols and\r\npatron of the living. During a portion of the time when he was vicar of\r\nPoulton, the Rev. R. Bowness was curate in charge. The Rev. John Hull,\r\nM.A., is honorary canon of Manchester, and was examining chaplain to the\r\nRight Rev. Prince Lee, D.D., the first bishop of this diocese, by whom\r\nhe was appointed to the rectory of Eaglescliffe, near Yarm, one of the\r\nmost valuable livings in his gift. The Rev. Thomas Clarke, M.A., was\r\noriginally curate at the Parish Church of Preston, and afterwards became\r\nincumbent of Christ Church in the same town, which living he resigned on\r\nbeing presented to the vicarage of Poulton.\r\n\r\nSubjoined are a number of extracts selected from the old account books\r\nof the churchwardens, and in them will be found much that is both\r\ninteresting and curious:—\r\n\r\n  “1764.\r\n\r\n  “June 4.—To the Ringers, being his Majestie’s Birthday, 3s. 0d.\r\n\r\n  July 8.—To a Bottle of Wine to a strange Parson, 2s. 0d.: To\r\n  ditto to a strange Parson, 2s. 0d.\r\n\r\n  “1765.\r\n\r\n  “June 6.”—To Mr. Lomas for mending clock, 2s. 2d.\r\n\r\n  August 18.—To Thomas Parkinson for Rushes, 6s. 8d.: Spent when\r\n  Rush came, 1s. 7d.\r\n\r\n  Oct. 20.—To Mr. Loxham for a Prayer, 2d.\r\n\r\n  Dec. 25.—Spent Receiving Bassoon, 1s. 6d.: To Clark in full for\r\n  wages, £4 0s. 0d.: To Ringers Last half yʳ Sallary, 18s. 0d.: To\r\n  Singers in full, 12s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  “1766.\r\n\r\n  “Sept. 15.—Rushes for Church, 6s. 8d.: Candles, Beesoms, &c.,\r\n  12s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  “1767.\r\n\r\n  “May 13.—Court fees at Visitation, 7s. 10d.: Churchwardens’\r\n  Expenses at Preston, £1 7s. 5d.: Curat’s horse hire to Dᵒ, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  July 20.—To Reed for Bassoon, 4s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  Nov. 21.—To Hugh Seed for Flaggin, £6 18s. 8½d.: To Thos.

Rich. Harrison, made an addition, abutting\r\nthe west end, and put the original portion in thorough repair. This\r\nhouse, which was surrounded by venerable trees, was taken down in 1835,\r\nand the present vicarage erected on the site.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, a spacious building, capable of holding three hundred persons,\r\nwas erected in Sheaf Street by voluntary subscription for the purposes of\r\na Sunday School, previous to which a small cottage in the Green had been\r\nused as a meeting place for the scholars connected with the church.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred and fifty years ago the town of Poulton presented a\r\nvery different appearance to that it wears in our day. The market-place\r\nwas surrounded by a number of low thatched houses of very humble\r\nexteriors, if we except a few private residences, as those of the\r\nWalmsleys and Rigbys, which stood out conspicuously from the rest, not\r\nonly by their superiority in size, but also by the possession of slated\r\nor flagged roofs. The house of the Rigbys was built in 1693 by Sir\r\nAlexander Rigby, of Layton Hall, who was High-sheriff of the county in\r\n1691-2, and stands at the south end of the square, the family arms and\r\ndate of erection being still attached to the front wall. The building is\r\nnow used as a dwelling and retail shop combined, and contains little of\r\nmoment beyond the ancient oak balustrade and staircase. It is probable\r\nthat Sir Alexander Rigby built the house with the intention of using it\r\nas a town residence for himself and family during the winter months,\r\nfor we must remember that Poulton contained several persons of note and\r\ndistinction at that time, and nothing is more natural than that the\r\nknight should prefer the cheerful society to be found amongst them to the\r\nlong solitudes of the Hall during the dull, inclement season of the year,\r\nwhen country roads were almost impassable. After Sir Alexander Rigby had\r\nbeen released from prison, having satisfied the claims of his creditors,\r\nhe took up his abode permanently in Poulton until his death, Layton Hall\r\nand other property having been sold, but whether his remains were laid in\r\nthe churchyard here, or removed elsewhere, cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the market-place was the Moot Hall, connected with\r\nwhich were shambles and pent-houses, the latter being continued along the\r\nfronts of the dwellings in the square. None of the streets could boast\r\na pavement, and as a consequence intercourse between the inhabitants in\r\nrainy weather was a matter of considerable inconvenience and difficulty,\r\nvisiting under such unfavourable circumstances being usually performed\r\nby means of stepping stones. Public lamps were unknown in the streets,\r\nand any one whose business or pleasure took him abroad after night-fall\r\nor dusk, would have to rely on the feeble glimmer of a horn lantern to\r\nguide him along the proper track and protect him from floundering in the\r\nmud. Looking on this picture of discomfort, it seems pretty certain to us\r\nthat our Poultonian forefathers at least, could they but enjoy one week\r\nof our modern life and improvements, would be the very last to join in\r\nthe wish, so often enthusiastically, but rather thoughtlessly, expressed,\r\nfor a revival of the _good_ old times. The market-square still retains\r\nits fishstones, cross, whipping post, and stocks; and although the wooden\r\nportion of the last has been recently renewed, we are in a position to\r\ninform the curious or alarmed reader that it has not been done with the\r\nview of re-introducing the obsolete punishment, but merely to preserve a\r\nlink, be it ever so painful an one, with the past. The cross surmounts\r\na stone pillar placed on a circular base of similar material, formed in\r\nsteps and tapering towards the column.\r\n\r\nAlthough Poulton was never the scene of any military encounter during\r\nthe unsettled eras of our history, still there is ample proof that the\r\ninhabitants were far from lethargic or indifferent to the course of\r\nevents during those times. During the reign of Henry VIII., when James\r\nIV. of Scotland succumbed to the superiority of the English arms, and\r\nyielded up his life on Flodden Field, the yeomanry and husbandmen of this\r\ntown were well represented; and the cheerful alacrity with which they\r\nhastened to join the royal standard under Lord Stanley, in company with\r\nothers from the Fylde, between here and Preston, is lauded in an ancient\r\nballad, written to celebrate the victory, from which the following lines\r\nare extracted:—\r\n\r\n  “From Ribchester unto Rachdale,\r\n  From Poulton to Preston with pikes,\r\n  They with yᵉ Stanley howte forthe went.”\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to recapitulate the stirring incidents of the Civil\r\nWars, the bivouacking and plundering in the neighbourhood or the frequent\r\ndemands for recruits by the royal and parliamentary generals, but it\r\nwill be sufficiently convincing of the earnestness and loyalty of the\r\ninhabitants to state, that most of the local families of influence risked\r\ntheir lives and fortunes in the service of the king, leaving little doubt\r\nthat those of humbler sphere would be actuated by a like enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAbout a century ago it was customary amongst the gentry and more wealthy\r\nyeomanry to hold their interments at night by the light of lamps or\r\nlanterns, and during the passage of the funeral procession through the\r\ntown, each householder illuminated his windows with burning candles. The\r\nlast person to be buried with this ceremony was the Rev. Thomas Turner,\r\nthe vicar, who died in 1810.\r\n\r\nOf the domestic habits of Poulton at that period, and rather earlier,\r\nit need only be said that they presented little variation from those of\r\nother towns or villages similarly situated; removed from the enervating\r\nand seductive temptations of a city, and forced, for the most part, to\r\nearn their bread under the broad canopy of heaven, it is not surprising\r\nto find that the people were a long-lived and vigorous race. Their\r\nfeastings and merrymakings took place at fair-times, and at such other\r\nseasons as were universally set apart in rural districts for rejoicings\r\nand festivity, notably harvest gatherings and the first of May, the\r\nlatter being especially honoured. On that day the causeways were strewn\r\nwith flowers, and all things suitable for the festival were lavishly\r\nprovided; wine, ale, and sweetmeats being freely contributed by the\r\ngentry and others. The peasantry were clothed in sober suits of hodden\r\ngrey, the productions of the “disty and wharl” or spinning wheel, without\r\nwhich no household was considered complete, whilst their food was of the\r\nplainest kind, consisting mostly of barley and rye bread, with boiled\r\nparsnips and peas eaten in the pod, wheaten bread being reserved for\r\nthe consumption of the more wealthy classes. The present station at the\r\nBreck, a name of Danish origin, and signifying an acclivity, stands\r\neither on, or in close proximity to, the site of the old ducking-pond,\r\nor rather brook, where the scolds of Poulton were wont in former days to\r\nhave the\r\n\r\n  “Venom of their spleen”\r\n\r\ncopiously diluted and cooled by frequent immersions.\r\n\r\nA native of Poulton thus wrote of the town more than fifty years since,\r\nand if the present generation but emulates the virtues of its forefathers\r\nas herein stated, there are many places which would form, notwithstanding\r\nits protracted inertitia, less agreeable homes than the ancient\r\nmetropolis of the Fylde:—\r\n\r\n  “Hail happy place, for health and peace renown’d,\r\n  Though not with riches, yet contentment crown’d.\r\n  Riches, the grand promoter of each strife,\r\n  Content, God’s first-best gift in human life.\r\n  Here hospitality has fixed her throne,\r\n  And discord’s jars by name alone are known;\r\n  The stranger here is always entertain’d\r\n  With welcome smile and courtesy unfeign’d.\r\n  Kind to each other, generous and free,\r\n  Plain, yet liberal friends to charity.”\r\n\r\nSixty years since Poulton contained a manufactory for sacking,\r\nsail-cloth, and sheeting, belonging to a Mr. Harrison, who lived in the\r\nhouse now in the occupation of R. Dunderdale, esq., J.P., and had his\r\nweaving shed at the rear of those premises. That gentleman employed\r\nfrom thirty to forty hands regularly during the time he conducted the\r\nbusiness—a period of about fifteen years. An establishment connected\r\nwith flax dressing and twine spinning, and employing several hands,\r\nwas located in the house erected by Sir Alexander Rigby, of Layton;\r\nand a currier and leather dresser had his works in Church Street. Of\r\nother trades and professions in the town at that date, there were four\r\nattorneys, two surgeons, seven butchers, nine bakers and flour dealers,\r\nthree wine and spirit merchants, two maltsters, ten boot and shoe\r\nmakers, five linen and woollen drapers, four tailors, three milliners,\r\nfour grocers, three ironmongers, three joiners, two wheelwrights, two\r\ncoopers, two painters, three plumbers and glaziers, and two corn-millers.\r\nSubsequently Harrison’s residence was used for parochial purposes, and\r\nformed the town’s workhouse until the bill of Sir Robert Peel brought\r\nabout the joint system of pauper relief and management under the name of\r\nUnions; and at one time small looms were placed in the old shed behind\r\nthe workhouse, for the purpose of providing remunerative occupation\r\nfor some of the inmates. Three fairs are held annually for cattle and\r\ncloth, and take place on the 3rd of February, the 13th of April, and the\r\n3rd of November, whilst a general market, but very indifferently, if\r\nat all, attended, is appointed to be held each Monday. About the year\r\n1840, when the Preston and Wyre Railway was completed and the Poulton\r\nStation erected, a dye-house of some considerable size, and one that had\r\ndone a large business in the Fylde for many years, was taken down, and\r\nshortly afterwards the Royal Oak Hotel built on its site. About the same\r\ntime the old brook, over which the cuckstool hung in earlier days, and\r\nwhose waters had long been polluted by discharges from the dye-house,\r\nwas arched over with brick and earth, and included in the station\r\npremises. The Railway Hotel was erected a little anterior to the inn just\r\nmentioned. The other hotels of Poulton, situated in the town itself,\r\nare ancient, and by their size and number, considering the smallness of\r\nthe present population, are indicative of the former importance of its\r\nmarket and fairs, and intimate that its position as the centre of a wide\r\ndistrict was the means of exciting and maintaining a large amount of\r\ncommercial activity, such as would necessitate the frequent visits of\r\nbusiness agents and others. Several private houses can be pointed out\r\nas having been in earlier days places of public entertainment, amongst\r\nwhich may be named one now used as a bakery and bread shop in Queen’s\r\nSquare, and which formerly bore the name of the Spread Eagle Hotel;\r\nin Sheaf Street, also, there existed about half a century ago a small\r\nbut respectable hotel, called the Wheat Sheaf Inn, with bowling green\r\nattached, but like other more pretentious establishments, it has been\r\nconverted into a dwelling-house, whilst a handsome residence occupies the\r\nold bowling green.\r\n\r\nThe Independents were the first section of the Dissenting community to\r\nerect a chapel for their members, which they accomplished in 1808. After\r\nbeing in use twenty or thirty years, this place of worship was closed,\r\nand not re-opened until about ten years since. In 1819 a chapel was\r\nerected by the Wesleyans in Back Street, and in 1861 the building was\r\nenlarged. At the Breck there is a Roman Catholic chapel, which stands\r\nback some distance from the road leading to Skippool, and is approached\r\nby a long avenue of trees. The chapel is a plain brick building, with\r\nthree unstained windows on each side; and above the entrance has been\r\nplaced a square stone inscribed with a verse from the Psalms—“I have\r\nloved, O Lord, the beauty of thy House, and the place where thy Glory\r\ndwelleth,”—and the date of erection, “A.D. 1813.” Within the edifice the\r\npews are open and arranged in three rows, one running down each side,\r\nand a double set occupying the central portion of the body. The solitary\r\ngallery at the end opposite the altar is lined with seats, and contains a\r\nharmonium, whilst the altar itself is handsomely and suitably decorated.\r\nThe chapel is dedicated to St. John, and on the east and south sides\r\nlies the burial ground, wherein may be seen a stone slab carved by an\r\neccentric character of Poulton, named James Bailey, whose remains are\r\nnow deposited beneath it. The upper surface of the stone is ornamented\r\nwith the outlines of two coffins, recording respectively the demises of\r\nMargaret Bailey, in 1841, and James Bailey, her father, in 1853. Between\r\nthe coffins, and severing their upper portions, is a cross, with a few\r\nwords at the foot, on each side of which are the representations of a\r\nscull and cross-bones. Other specimens of the sculptural genius of Bailey\r\nare lavishly, if not tastefully, scattered over the remainder of the\r\nslab. The residence of the priest is attached to the chapel, and in Breck\r\nRoad are the elegant Gothic schools connected with it. Until the opening,\r\nin 1868, of these schools, which have since been extended by the erection\r\nof a wing, a loft over an outbuilding facing the priests’ house, received\r\nthe Catholic children of the parish for educational purposes.\r\n\r\nWe now come to speak of Poulton as a port, and in this respect our\r\ninformation, it must be acknowledged, is very scanty; the harbours of\r\nPoulton were situated at Skippool and Wardleys, on opposite banks of\r\nthe Wyre, and it was to the cargoes imported to those places that the\r\ncustom-house of the town owed its existence. At what date it was first\r\nestablished cannot be discovered, but that it was in being nearly two\r\ncenturies ago is proved by a paper on “The comparative wages of public\r\nservants in the customs,” in which the following occurs:—\r\n\r\n  “We find that William Jennings, collector of the customs at\r\n  Poulton, in the Fylde, received in 1708, during the reign of\r\n  Queen Ann, for his yearly services thirty pounds per annum; and\r\n  five subordinate officers had seventy-five pounds equally divided\r\n  amongst them.”\r\n\r\nThe chief traffic of the port was in timber, imported from the Baltic and\r\nAmerica; and flax and tallow, which arrived from Russia. In 1825 Poulton\r\nwas described by Mr. Baines, in his History of Lancashire, as a creek\r\nunder Preston, and it is probable that such had been its position for\r\na long time anterior to that date. In 1826 Poulton was made a sub-port\r\nunder Lancaster, and later, when the town of Fleetwood sprang up at the\r\nmouth of the Wyre, the customs were removed from Poulton to that new port.\r\n\r\nSubjoined are the number of inhabitants of the township at intervals of\r\nten years from 1801, when the first official census was taken:—\r\n\r\n  1801        769\r\n  1811        926\r\n  1821      1,011\r\n  1831      1,025\r\n  1841      1,128\r\n  1851      1,120\r\n  1861      1,141\r\n  1871      1,161\r\n\r\nIn 1770, during the reign of George III., an act of parliament was\r\nobtained by means of which a court was established in this town “for,”\r\naccording to the wording of the deed, “the more easy and speedy recovery\r\nof small debts within the parishes of Poulton, Lytham, Kirkham, and\r\nBispham, and the townships of Preesall and Stalmine.” A number of\r\ngentlemen engaged in commercial pursuits and residing in these several\r\ndistricts were appointed commissioners, any three or more of whom\r\nconstituted a court of justice, by the name and style of The Court of\r\nRequests; they were empowered to hear and determine all such matters of\r\ndebt as were under forty shillings, further they were authorised and\r\nrequired, “to meet, assemble, and hold the said Court in each of the said\r\nParishes of Poulton and Kirkham, once in every week at least, to wit, on\r\nevery Monday at Poulton, and on every Thursday at Kirkham, and oftener\r\nif there should be occasion, in a Court-house, or some convenient place\r\nappointed in each of the said Parishes.” Each commissioner on being\r\nelected took the following oath:—\r\n\r\n  “I ... do swear That I will faithfully, impartially, and\r\n  honestly, according to the best of my Judgement, hear and\r\n  determine all such Matters and Causes as shall be brought before\r\n  me, by virtue of an Act of Parliament, for the more easy and\r\n  speedy Recovery of small Debts, within the Parishes etc.; without\r\n  Favour or Affection, Prejudice or Malice, to either Party. So\r\n  help me God.”\r\n\r\nEdward Whiteside and Simon Russell were elected, respectively, clerk and\r\nsergeant of this court, and James Standen, of Poulton, in consideration\r\nof having advanced money to pay the expenses of obtaining the act and\r\nproviding suitable accommodation for its administration, had authority\r\ngiven to him and his heirs to appoint a person to be clerk or sergeant\r\nas often as either of those offices should become vacant, until the\r\nsum so advanced with lawful interest had been repaid; after which the\r\nappointments were to be filled up by a majority of votes at a special\r\nmeeting of the commissioners, not less than eleven being present. For\r\nthe better regulation of the proceedings it was enacted that a majority,\r\namounting to five, of the commissioners assembled in court should have\r\nfull power and authority to make, as often as occasion required, such\r\nrules and orders for the better management of the court as might seem\r\nnecessary and conducive to the purposes of the act, provided always such\r\nrules or orders did not abridge or alter the scale of fees as at first\r\narranged, and were consistent with equity and the true intent of the act.\r\nIn the event of anyone neglecting to comply with an order from this court\r\nfor the payment of money owing an execution was awarded against the body\r\nor goods of the debtor, if the former, the sergeant was, by a precept\r\nunder the hand and seal of the clerk, “empowered and required to take and\r\napprehend, or cause to be taken and apprehended, such party or parties,\r\nbeing within any of the parishes or townships aforesaid, and convey him,\r\nher, or them, to some common gaol, or house of correction, within the\r\ncounty palatine of Lancaster, there to remain until he, she, or they, had\r\nperformed and obeyed such order, decree, or judgment, so as no person\r\nshould remain in confinement upon any such execution, for any longer\r\nspace of time than three months.” In the case of goods the sergeant was\r\nsimilarly empowered “to levy by distress and sale of goods, of such\r\nparty, being within the parishes or townships aforesaid, such sum and\r\nsums of money and costs as should be so ordered and decreed.”\r\n\r\nOne clause of the act stated that if any person or persons affronted,\r\ninsulted, or abused, all or any of the commissioners, the clerk, or\r\nofficers of the court, either during the sitting or in going to or\r\nreturning from the same, or interrupted the proceedings, or obstructed\r\nthe clerk or sergeant in the lawful execution of their different offices,\r\nhe, she, or they should be brought before a justice of the peace, who\r\nwas hereby empowered to inflict on conviction a fine of not more than\r\n40s., and not less than 5s. The jurisdiction of the court did not extend\r\nto any debt or rent upon any lease or contract, where the title of any\r\nlands, tenements, or hereditaments came in question; nor to any debt\r\narising from any last will or testament, or matrimony, or anything\r\nproperly belonging to the ecclesiastical courts; nor to any debt from any\r\nhorse-race, cock-match, wager, or any kind of gaming or play; nor from\r\nany forfeiture upon any penal statute or bye-law; nor did it extend to\r\nany debt whatsoever whereof there had not been contract, acknowledgment,\r\nundertaking, or promise to pay within six years from the date of the\r\nsummons, although any of the above mentioned debts should not amount\r\nto forty shillings. No attorney or solicitor was allowed to appear\r\nbefore the commissioners as attorney or advocate on behalf of either\r\nplaintiff or defendant, or to speak on any cause or matter before the\r\ncourt in which he was not himself a party or witness, under a penalty\r\nof five pounds for each offence. It was further enacted “that no action\r\nor suit for any debt not amounting to the sum of forty shillings, and\r\nrecoverable by virtue of this act in the said Court of Requests, should\r\nbe brought against any person or persons, residing or inhabiting within\r\nthe jurisdiction thereof, in any of the king’s courts at Westminster,\r\nor any other court whatsoever, or elsewhere, out of the said Court of\r\nRequests, and no suit which had been commenced in the said Court of\r\nRequests in pursuance of this act, nor any proceedings therein, should\r\nor might be removed to any superior court, but the judgments, decrees,\r\nand proceedings of the said court should be final and conclusive to all\r\nintents and purposes; provided always, that nothing in this act should\r\nextend, or be construed to extend, to prevent any person from suing\r\nfor small debts in any other court, where such suit might have been\r\ninstituted before the passing of this act.” The various fees to be paid\r\nto the clerk of the court were—for entering every case, 6d.; for issuing\r\nevery summons, 6d.; for every subpœna, 6d.; for calling every plaintiff\r\nor defendant before the court, 3d.; for every hearing or trial, 6d.; for\r\nswearing every witness, plaintiff or defendant, 3d.; for every order,\r\njudgment or decree, 6d.; for a non-suit, 6d.; for every search in the\r\nbooks, 3d.; for paying money into court, 6d., if by instalments, 6d. in\r\nthe pound more; for every execution, 6d.; for every warrant of commitment\r\nfor misconduct in court, 1s. The fees to the sergeant were—for every\r\nsummons, order, or subpœna, and attending court with the return thereof,\r\n6d.; for calling every plaintiff or defendant before the court, 1d.; for\r\nexecuting every attachment, execution, or warrant, against the body or\r\ngoods, 1s.; for carrying every plaintiff, defendant, or delinquent to\r\nprison, 6d. more for every mile. Although this was purely a lay-court\r\nthe commissioners possessed and exercised the power of placing the\r\nwitnesses on oath previous to receiving their evidence. In 1847 the Court\r\nof Requests was superseded by a new court, for the recovery of debts\r\nnot amounting to twenty pounds, which held its first sitting on Monday,\r\nthe 23rd of April in that year, under the presidency of John Addison,\r\nesq., a barrister and the appointed judge, in the room belonging to the\r\nSunday school. This gentleman wore a silk gown, as prescribed to the\r\njudges of these courts, and Mr. Elletson, solicitor, the clerk, was also\r\nrobed. At the first assemblage the Rev. John Hull, M.A., the vicar, and\r\nGiles Thornber, esq., J.P., were seated on each side of the judge. The\r\ncases for trial or arbitration only numbered seventeen, and were of\r\nlittle interest, so that the initiative sitting of the court was but of\r\nshort duration. The circuits apportioned to the judges had an average\r\npopulation ranging from 202,713 to 312,220 persons, and the salary paid\r\nto each of these officials was £1,200 per annum. In the schedule of fees\r\nit was stated that for the recovery of debts not exceeding 20s. the cost\r\nshould be 3s.; under 40s., 5s.; under £5, 9s.; under £10, £1; under £20,\r\n£1 10s.; and in jury cases 5s. would be charged for the jurymen, while\r\nthe other court charges would be a little increased. The powers of this\r\ncourt, now designated the County Court, have been considerably enlarged\r\nsince its first establishment; the following gentlemen are the officers\r\nat present connected with it:—\r\n\r\n  Judge         William A. Hulton, esq.\r\n  Registrar     Mr. E. J. Patteson.\r\n  High Bailiff  Mr. J. Whiteside.\r\n\r\nLittle Poulton is the name given to a district and hamlet lying on the\r\neast of Poulton township, and in it is situated the ancient manorial\r\nresidence called Little Poulton Hall, and now used as a farm-house.\r\nThe original mansion stood on the land immediately at the rear of the\r\nexisting edifice, which was erected about one hundred and ten or twenty\r\nyears ago. Until the occupation of the present tenant, Mr. Singleton, the\r\nfoundations of the old Hall remained in the ground, but the indications\r\nafforded by them of its dimensions and appearance were not of any great\r\nutility. In 1570 Little Poulton Hall was occupied by George, the son\r\nof Bartholomew Hesketh, of Aughton, a grandson of Thomas Hesketh, of\r\nRufford, but only in one of the junior lines. George Hesketh married\r\nDorothy, the daughter of William Westby, of Mowbreck, and had issue one\r\nson, William, who inherited the estate and resided at the Hall. William\r\nHesketh was living in 1613, about forty years after the decease of his\r\nfather, and had two children, William and Wilfrid, by his wife Elizabeth,\r\nthe daughter of John Allen, of Rossall Hall. William, the eldest son,\r\nseems to have removed to Maynes, or Mains, Hall, and settled there during\r\nthe lifetime of his father; it is probable that his younger brother would\r\nremain at Little Poulton Hall, but of this we have no positive proof,\r\nand consequently can advance it merely as a conjecture. Little Poulton\r\ndescended in the Heskeths, of Mains, until about 1750, but the name of\r\nthat family was changed, after the marriage of William Hesketh, of Mains\r\nHall, (living in 1714), with Mary, the daughter of John Brockholes, of\r\nClaughton, by Thomas Hesketh, the eldest son of that union, who inherited\r\nthe estates of his maternal uncle, and assumed the name of Brockholes.\r\nThomas Hesketh-Brockholes died without offspring, and the property\r\npassed, successively, to his younger and only surviving brothers, Joseph\r\nand James, both of whom adopted the name and arms of Brockholes, and\r\ndied childless; but by the will of Joseph, Little Poulton and the other\r\nestates descended to William Fitzherbert, the brother of his widow\r\nConstantia, the daughter of Bazil Fitzherbert, of Swinnerton. William\r\nFitzherbert also assumed the title of Brockholes, and his descendant is\r\nthe present proprietor.\r\n\r\nA family of the name of Barban preceded the Heskeths at the manor\r\nhouse, and Gyles Curwen, a descendant of the Curwens, of Workington, in\r\nCumberland, espoused, about 1550, the daughter and co-heiress of—Barban,\r\nof Little Poulton Hall, having issue—Thomas, Elizabeth, Grace, and\r\nWinefrid. Thomas Curwen died unmarried; Elizabeth became the wife\r\nof—Camden, by whom she had William Camden, Clarenceux king-at-arms;\r\nWinefrid married and settled in London; and Grace espoused Gilbert\r\nNicholson, of Poulton, by whom she had issue—Francis, Grace, and Giles.\r\nFrancis Nicholson had six children—Humphrey, Grace, Bridget, Thomas,\r\nIsabell, and Dorothy. Grace Nicholson married Thomas Braithwaite, of\r\nBeaumont, and was the mother of nine children in 1613, the eldest,\r\nGeoffrey, being fifteen years of age.[81]\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the Hall is a wood, covering about two acres of\r\nland, and freshly planted within the last half century. Until recent\r\nyears, numerous decaying tree stocks were turned up out of the soil, and\r\ntheir size plainly evidenced the massive nature of the timber formerly\r\ngrowing there. There is a rookery in the modern wood, and it is surmised\r\nthat there was one also amongst the branches of the ancient trees, and\r\nthat a large quantity of bullets discovered in a field on its outskirts\r\nrecord the periodical onslaughts on the unfortunate rooks in days when\r\nmarksmen were not so unerring as long practice and improved firearms have\r\nrendered them now. In the hamlet of Little Poulton there are, in addition\r\nto the Hall, three antique houses of considerable pretensions, which\r\nwere erected and occupied by persons of good social standing. One of\r\nthem, on the opposite side of the road, and a little removed from the old\r\nmansion, was built by a gentleman named Fayle, and on an oaken beam over\r\na doorway, now bricked up, in an extensive barn, is the inscription, EF:\r\nIF: 1675, the initials of the erector and his wife, with the date when\r\nthe edifice was completed. This E. Fayle was probably a relative, perhaps\r\ngrandfather, of Edward Fayle, of the Holmes, Thornton, and afterwards of\r\nBridge House, Bispham, who married, about 1728, Susannah, the younger\r\ndaughter of Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys, and co-heiress, with her\r\nsister, of the Rev. John Veale, of the same place, her only brother.\r\nAnother respectable dwelling, but like the few other buildings around,\r\nbecoming dilapidated through age, bears the initials of Henry Porter,\r\nand the date 1723, over the entrance. From sundry documents which have\r\ncome to light, it seems that Henry Porter was a gentleman of influence\r\nand position in the neighbourhood, but beyond that no information can\r\nbe gained concerning him or his descendants. The tenement he held was\r\npurchased by the Brockholes, of Claughton, in 1846. Close by the side\r\nof Porter’s residence is another of the same model and size, apparently\r\nerected by A. Worswick in 1741, but of this person nothing is known. The\r\nremainder of the hamlet is made up of a few old thatched cottages.\r\n\r\nA free school was established by James Baines, draper, of Poulton, in\r\n1717, shortly before his death; and by his will, dated that year, he\r\nbequeathed to Richard Wilson, Richard Whitehead, sen., Richard Johnson,\r\nand Richard Thornton, of Hardhorn-with-Newton, yeomen, to Richard\r\nDickson, woollen draper, and Samuel Bird, yeoman, of Poulton, to Robert\r\nSalthouse, of Staining, yeoman, and to their heirs “all that Schoolhouse\r\nby me lately erected in Hardhorn-in-Newton, and the parcel of land\r\nwhereon the same is erected, which is enjoyed therewith, and which by\r\nme was lately purchased from Thomas Ords, to remain, continue, and be a\r\nFree School for ever for the persons and purposes hereinafter mentioned.\r\nItem: I give and devise unto the seven said Trustees and their Heirs,\r\nall that messuage and tenement, called Puddle House, with the lands\r\nenjoyed therewith, about twenty-two acres, to the special end, intent,\r\nand purpose, that the rents and profits over ten shillings a year,\r\n(allowed for a dinner to the trustees, and their successors, on their\r\nmeeting about the affairs of this School on the second of February, on\r\nwhich day they shall yearly meet for that purpose), and after all costs\r\nfor repairs at the said Schoolhouse and ground it stands on be paid, the\r\nbalance be given to such person as shall yearly and every year be named,\r\nchosen, and appointed, by the said seven Trustees, and their successors,\r\nor the major part of them, to act as Schoolmaster, to teach and instruct\r\nin writing, reading, and other school learning, according to the best\r\nof his capacity, all such children of the inhabitants of the townships\r\nof Poulton and Hardhorn-in-Newton as shall be sent to the said School,\r\nand behave themselves with care and good manners, without any other\r\npayment or reward, except what the said children or their parents shall\r\nvoluntarily give.” The testament then proceeds to direct that when any\r\ntwo of the seven trustees died, the five surviving should at the cost of\r\nthe estate appoint two other of the “most able, discreet, and sufficient\r\ninhabitants in Poulton and Hardhorn within three months,” and that such\r\na practice should be observed as occasion required “to the end that the\r\nsaid charity may continue for ever according to the true intent and\r\nmeaning of this Will.” The Trustees were invested with power to dismiss\r\nany schoolmaster and appoint a successor, regarding whom there was the\r\nfollowing clause:—“All Schoolmasters on appointment shall give bond with\r\none or more sureties for good conduct, and be at duty from 7 a.m. to 11\r\na.m., and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., except from the 1st November to 1st February,\r\nin which quarter alone shall they attend on all school days from 8 a.m.\r\nto 11 a.m., and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; the afternoons of Thursday and Saturday\r\nto be holiday.”\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse is a whitewashed building, a single story high, and has\r\nfour windows in front, with one at each end. It stands in the township\r\nof Hardhorn-with-Newton, about half a mile from the town of Poulton, and\r\nhas the annexed inscription fixed on the wall facing the main road:—“This\r\nCharity School was Founded and Endowed by Mr. James Baines, of Poolton,\r\nwho died the 9th January, 1717. Rebuilt 1818.” The lands bequeathed by\r\nMr. Baines have been exchanged for others of greater value across the\r\nriver Wyre. The attendance at present is small.\r\n\r\nMr. Baines also left £800 to six trustees to be laid out in land, half\r\nthe annual income or interest from which he directed to be devoted to the\r\n“maintenance, use, and best advantage of the poorest sort of inhabitants\r\nof the township of Poulton, which receive no relief by the Poor-rate,”\r\nand “for putting out poor children of the said township apprentices\r\nyearly though their parents receive relief by the Poor-rate.” The other\r\nmoiety he directed to be devoted to similar purposes in the townships of\r\nMarton, Hardhorn-with-Newton, Carleton, and Thornton.\r\n\r\nJenkinson’s Gift or Charity consists of the rents of a small cottage with\r\ngarden behind, and two detached crofts at Forton, in Cockerham parish,\r\nand amounts to about £5 10s. per annum, which is expended in the purchase\r\nof books for the scholars of Baines’s school.\r\n\r\nNicholas Nickson, of Compley, in Poulton, by will dated the 12th of\r\nApril, 1720, charged his estate with the payment, after the decease of\r\nhis widow, Alice Nickson, of £100 to the churchwardens and overseers of\r\nPoulton, in trust, to invest the sum and give half the interest to the\r\nvicar for the time being, distributing the remainder amongst the poor\r\nhouse-keepers of the township not in receipt of parish relief. Until the\r\nbequest was paid, the heirs of Nickson, after the death of the widow,\r\nwere ordered to disburse five per cent. interest on the money each year.\r\nIn 1754 the trustees of this charity released the estate from all charges\r\nin consideration of £100, the legacy, paid to them; and on the 18th of\r\nJuly, 1783, Joseph Harrison and the four other churchwardens of Poulton,\r\ntogether with William Brown and Paul Harrison, the overseers, purchased\r\nfrom James Standen, for £120, a close in Poulton, called Durham’s Croft,\r\nto hold the same in trust and divide the rents into twelve parts, whereof\r\nfive were to be given to the vicar, five to indigent inhabitants not\r\nreceiving relief, and two in aid of the poor’s rates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFLEETWOOD-ON-WYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe site of the present town of Fleetwood was at no very distant period,\r\nless than half a century ago, a wild and desolate warren, forming part\r\nof the Rossall estate, and belonging to the late Sir Peter Hesketh\r\nFleetwood, bart. At that date the northern side showed unmistakable\r\nevidences of having at an earlier epoch been bounded by a broad wall\r\nor rampart of star-hills, continuous with the range until recent\r\nyears visible near Rossall Point, or North Cape, as that portion of\r\nthe district was locally called, but which has now been destroyed and\r\nlevelled by the sea. Beyond the warrener’s cottage and a small farm-house\r\non the Poulton road, no habitations existed anywhere in the vicinity;\r\nthe whole tract of sandhills and sward had been usurped by myriads\r\nof rabbits, which were some little time, even after the erection of\r\ndwellings, before they entirely deserted the spot where for centuries\r\nthey had found a home. During the stormy months of winter, and in the\r\nbreeding season, immense flocks of sea-fowl made their way to these\r\nshores, and like the rabbits, were allowed to remain in undisputed and\r\nundisturbed possession of the domain they had appropriated.\r\n\r\nWhether this district or locality was populated in the earlier eras of\r\nhistory by any of the aboriginal Britons, invading Romans, or piratical\r\nDanes, is a question difficult to solve, but the existence of a paved\r\nRoman road, discovered some depth beneath the sand when the trench for\r\nthe sea-wall was being excavated opposite the Mount Terrace, and traced\r\nacross the warren in the direction of Poulton, proves beyond a doubt that\r\nthere was traffic of some description, either peaceful or war-like,\r\nover the ground at a very remote age. The road is commonly designated\r\nthe Danes’ Pad, from a tradition that these freebooters made use of it\r\nduring their incursive warfare in the Fylde.[82] Evidence in support\r\nof the belief that this part of the coast was visited by the Danes or\r\nNorthmen, as the inhabitants of Scandinavia were called, is to be found\r\nin “Knot End,” the name by which the projecting point of land on the\r\nopposite side of Wyre has been known from time immemorial. In early days\r\nthere were both the “Great and Little Knots,” or heaps of stones, but\r\nthe works carried out for the improvement of the harbour involved the\r\ndestruction of the small, and mutilation of the big “Knot.” Now arises\r\nthe question, why were these round collections of boulder stones called\r\n“Knots?” In answer to which it may be stated that the word “knot” is of\r\npure Scandinavian origin, and in that ancient Northern language always\r\nmarked a round heap, and we believe also a round heap of stones. This\r\ninterpretation would be characteristic of what these knots or mounds\r\nof stones were before they were despoiled by the Wyre Harbour Company.\r\nSuch an application of the word to rounded hills of stone is common at\r\nno great distance, and must have been applied by the same people to all\r\nthese rocky elevations, as instance Hard Knot, Arnside Knot, and Farlton\r\nKnot, all of which indicate the name by the rotundity of their stony\r\nsummits, and seem to confirm the opinion that the early inhabitants\r\nof Scandinavia visited the coast, suggesting also that they had some\r\nsettlement in its immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Romans, the only traces of their presence which have\r\nbeen discovered in the neighbourhood of the town, consist of the road\r\nabove mentioned, and a number of ancient coins which were found near\r\nRossall, in 1840, by some labourers engaged in brick-making. These coins,\r\namounting in all to about three hundred, were principally of silver,\r\nand bore the impresses of Severus, Sabina, Antonius, Nerva, etc. It is\r\nquite possible, however, that other relics belonging to that nation or\r\nthe Danes, may still exist, hidden by the sand, and more deeply imbedded\r\nthan it is necessary to sink when preparing for the foundations of the\r\nhouses, whilst many also may have been submerged by the encroaching waves\r\nas they have gradually inundated the north and west sides of the district.\r\n\r\nDoctor Leigh, in his Natural History of Lancashire, informs us that at\r\nthe mouth of the river Wyre there was in his time a purging water which\r\nsprang up from out of the sand. “This, no doubt,” says the Doctor, “is\r\nthe sea-water which filters through the sand, but by reason of the\r\nshortness of its filtration (the spring lying so near the river), or the\r\nlooseness of the sand, the marine water is not perfectly dulcified, but\r\nretains a pleasing brackishness, not unlike that which is observable in\r\nthe milk of a farrow cow, or one that has conceived.”\r\n\r\nTo the lord of the manor, Sir P. H. Fleetwood, is due the credit of\r\nhaving first conceived the idea of converting the sterile warren into\r\na thriving seaport. Situated at the mouth of a river, the security of\r\nwhose stream had originated the proverb—“As safe and as easy as Wyre\r\nwater,” and by the side of a natural and commodious harbour, sheltered\r\nfrom ever wind, the illustrious baronet foresaw a prosperous future\r\nfor the place, could he obtain permission from parliament to construct\r\na railway to its shores from the important town of Preston, thereby\r\ncreating a communication with the manufacturing and commercial centres of\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire. In 1835, a number of gentlemen, denominated the\r\nPreston and Wyre Railway, Harbour, and Dock Company, having obtained the\r\nrequisite powers, deputed Frederick Kemp, esq., J.P., of Bispham Lodge,\r\nthen acting as agent to Sir P. H. Fleetwood, to purchase the land along\r\nthe proposed route. Operations were commenced with little delay, the work\r\nprogressed with fair rapidity, and on the 15th of July, 1840, the line\r\nwas declared open and ready for traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime dwelling-houses, hotels, and a spacious wharf had been\r\nspringing into existence. In 1836 the earliest foundation was laid at\r\nthe south-west corner of Preston Street by Robert Banton, of East Warren\r\nFarm. This farm was for a short season a licensed house and brewery,\r\nand is now, under the title of Warrenhurst, the private residence of J.\r\nM. Jameson, esq., C.E. The new erection, which still bears its original\r\nname of the Fleetwood Arms Hotel, made no further progress for about a\r\nyear, when it was completed by Thomas Parkinson, the head carpenter at\r\nRossall Hall. The first building finished and inhabited in Fleetwood was\r\na beer-house at the south-west corner of Church Street, which was erected\r\nin 1836-7, and is now a shop, owned and occupied by Richard Warbrick,\r\noutfitter. That small inn or licensed dwelling was in the occupation of a\r\nperson named Parker, a stonemason, who a little later built the Victoria\r\nHotel, in Dock-street, where he removed and resided for several months,\r\nuntil a sale of the property had been effected.\r\n\r\nThe streets were marked out by the plough according to the design of\r\nDecimus Burton, esq., architect, of London, and so arranged that all the\r\nprincipal thoroughfares, with the exception of the main road of entrance\r\nto the town, converged towards the largest star-hill, now known as the\r\nMount, on the highest point of which was placed a small decagon Chinese\r\nedifice, surrounded by a raised platform or terrace, whence an extensive\r\nview of the broad bay of Morecambe, the lofty ranges of Lancashire,\r\nCumberland, and Westmoreland, and a wide circuit of the neighbouring\r\ncountry could be obtained. The hollow on the south side of the mound\r\nwas fashioned into the form of a basin, and a semicircular gravelled\r\nwalk carried along the ridge of each side, leading with a gentle ascent\r\nfrom the entrance gates on the warren at the end of London Street to\r\nthe summit, whilst the slopes were tastefully arranged and planted with\r\nshrubs, to impart a pleasing and ornamental appearance to the otherwise\r\nbare sward. These shrubs, as might have been foreseen, speedily withered\r\nand perished, owing to the bleakness of the site, and a lack of that\r\nindispensable moisture which the dry sandy soil could neither retain nor\r\nsupply. In earlier days the Mount was commonly known as Tup, or Top,\r\nHill, and formed a favourite resort for pic-nic parties from Blackpool,\r\nor some of the surrounding villages, which visited the place during the\r\nsummer months, to admire the innumerable sea-fowl and their nests, the\r\nlatter being scattered over the shore in endless profusion.\r\n\r\nBuilding proceeded with rapid strides; house after house sprang up in the\r\nlines of streets, which had only lately received their first coating of\r\nshingle, and in 1841, one year after the opening of the railway, the town\r\nhad assumed considerable proportions. Near the entrance from Poulton road\r\nwere three or four double rows of cottages for the accommodation of the\r\nworkpeople, and a Roman Catholic chapel. Preston Street contained but\r\nfew houses in addition to the Fleetwood Arms Hotel; thence, travelling\r\neastward were Dock Street, with the Crown Hotel, as far as and including\r\nthe Victoria Hotel; the east side of Warren Street, the west side of St.\r\nPeter’s Place, the church and Sunday school, both sides of Church Street,\r\nCustom House Lane, the Lower Queen’s Terrace, the North Euston Hotel, and\r\nthe bath houses. The Upper Queen’s Terrace was in process of erection,\r\nbut was not completed until 1844, after having been allowed, for some\r\nreason, to remain in a partially finished state for two years.\r\n\r\nThe church, standing on a raised plot of ground in the centre of the town\r\nand surrounded by an iron palisading, is dedicated to St. Peter, and\r\nwas first opened for divine service in 1841. It is a stone edifice with\r\na square tower and octagonal spire at the west end, and was erected by\r\nvoluntary contributions, the site being provided by Sir P. H. Fleetwood,\r\nwho retained the right of presentation to the living. The interior of the\r\nbuilding is neat, and contains sittings for about four hundred persons\r\nin the body, with additional accommodation for two hundred more in the\r\ngallery, at the end of which are the choir-pew and organ-loft, the\r\nlatter being occupied by an instrument constructed by Gray, of London.\r\nPrevious to the alterations, which were made seventeen years since,\r\nand consisted of the erection of a gallery and the convertion of some\r\nof the private pews into free seats, the family pew of the Fleetwoods\r\nstood in front of the organ-loft, and was the only one raised out of the\r\nbody of the church. The chancel window is of stained glass, large and\r\nhandsome, representing a central figure of St. Peter bearing the Keys\r\nof Heaven, below and on each side of which several scriptural subjects\r\nare illustrated. This window, purchased by subscription amongst the\r\nparishioners, was inserted in 1860; and in the previous year a handsome\r\nfont of Caen stone was presented by Mrs. G. Y. Osborne. Two upright\r\ntablets, the gift of the late vicar, the Rev. G. Y. Osborne, illuminated\r\nwith the Ten Commandments, are placed, one on each side of the Communion\r\ntable. Four other tablets are fixed against the walls of the church,\r\nthe first of which was erected by a few friends as a tribute of respect\r\nto the memory of Dobson Ward, died 1859, aged 43 years, a humble but\r\nzealous worker in the Sunday school; another was placed by the Rev. G. Y.\r\nOsborne, in loving memory of his deceased daughter; the third, a handsome\r\ntablet, was erected at the entrance to the vestry, by parishioners and\r\nfriends, to the memory of the Rev. G. Y. Osborne, “for 19 years vicar\r\nof this parish, who died 11 November, 1871, aged 53 years,”[83] and the\r\nlast is to the memory of Charles Stewart, esq., died 1873, aged 64 years,\r\nlate of High Leigh, Cheshire, and Fleetwood. The living, endowed with the\r\ngreat tithes of Thornton and augmented by the pew rents, was originally a\r\nperpetual curacy, but during the ministry of the late Rev. G. Y. Osborne,\r\na distinct district or parish for all ecclesiastical purposes was\r\nassigned to the church, and the title of vicar accorded to the incumbent.\r\n\r\n  PERPETUAL CURATES AND VICARS OF FLEETWOOD.\r\n\r\n  IN THE DEANERY OF AMOUNDERNESS AND ARCHDEACONRY OF LANCASTER.\r\n\r\n  ------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------\r\n    Date of   |      NAME.         |    On whose       | Cause of vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                    |  Presentation.    |\r\n  ------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------\r\n      1841    |St. Vincent Beechey,|Sir P.

The central portion of\r\nthe in-walled space is occupied by a square, wooden structure, covered\r\nover with a slated roof, in the interior of which are stalls for the\r\ngoods of the different farmers and traders. Friday is the market day, and\r\nthe following list comprises the various commodities exposed for sale on\r\nFriday, the 10th of July, 1846, the earliest recorded, with their prices:—\r\n\r\n  Oats, per bushel              3s. 10d.\r\n  Meal, per load               36s.  0d.\r\n  Beans, per windle            16s.  0d.\r\n  Butter, per pound             1s.  1d.\r\n  Eggs, fresh      16 to 18 for 1s.  0d.\r\n  Peas, per strike              0s.  9d.\r\n  Potatoes (new), per score     1s. 10d.\r\n     ”     (old), per windle    8s.  0d.\r\n  Beef, per pound               6d. to 7d.\r\n  Lamb       ”                  0s.  7d.\r\n  Mutton     ”                  0s.  6½d.\r\n  Salmon     ”                  0s. 10d.\r\n  Lobsters   ”                  1s.  0d.\r\n\r\nSince the date of the above quotations, Preston has gradually monopolised\r\nthe chief portion of the grain trade, and consequently transactions\r\nin oats and other cereals are not of frequent occurrence at the local\r\nmarkets of the Fylde.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic chapel, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, was erected\r\nat the north end of Walmsley Street, continuous with the line of houses\r\nforming the east side of that street, and opened for divine worship on\r\nthe 15th of November, 1841. A few years since a more commodious edifice,\r\nwhich will be described hereafter, was erected on another and better\r\nsite, whilst the old one was dismantled, and subsequently converted into\r\ncottages.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Hotel, a handsome and substantial stone structure facing the\r\nRailway Station, was the third hotel erected in Fleetwood, the Fleetwood\r\nArms being the first, and the Victoria the second in point of completion.\r\nThe original dimensions of the Crown have been considerably increased\r\nby the addition in recent years of ample stable accommodation, a large\r\nbilliard room, and several sleeping apartments.\r\n\r\nThe North Euston Hotel, which was opened almost simultaneously with\r\nthe Crown Hotel, is a superb stone building in the form of a crescent,\r\nwith a frontage of nearly 300 feet. This edifice was sold to Government\r\nin 1859, and subsequently opened as a School of Musketry. The noble\r\nportico in front of the main entrance and the spacious hall within are\r\nsupported by massive stone pillars, whilst a handsome terrace, raised\r\na little above the level of the street, encircles the whole length of\r\nthe ground floor, and is protected by an ornamental iron railing. On\r\nits transfer to Government, quarters were provided for sixty officers\r\nand a staff of military instructors. There were three chief courses of\r\ninstruction held during each year, but in addition to these were two of\r\nshorter duration, one being in the month of January for the adjutants of\r\nvolunteers, and another a little later for the volunteers themselves. The\r\ncurriculum was similar to that at Hythe. In 1867 the School of Musketry\r\nwas discontinued, and after a short interval, in which fresh buildings\r\nwere added, the whole structure was turned into barracks, and as such\r\ncontinues to be occupied. In the early days of the hotel a T-shaped jetty\r\nextended out from the steps on the shore opposite the principal entrance\r\nto the distance of low-water mark, and was used by the visitors as a\r\nshort promenade and landing stage, but after standing a few years the\r\nerection was removed, being found to interfere with the course of the\r\nsteamers and other vessels round that section of the channel.\r\n\r\nThe bath-houses, each of which contained a spacious sea-water swimming\r\nbath, were connected with the North Euston Hotel, and therefore became\r\nthe property of Government on the transfer of the main building itself.\r\nSince that date their internal arrangements have undergone material\r\nalterations and modifications to suit the requirements of the military,\r\nbut their handsome stone exteriors and massive porticoes are still intact.\r\n\r\nThe custom-house on the Lower Queen’s Terrace is now a private residence\r\nin the occupation of Alexander Carson, esq., who is also the owner, and\r\nthe offices have for many years been situated in a house of more modest\r\npretensions in the same row.\r\n\r\nThe two lighthouses, one of which is placed in Pharos Street and the\r\nother further north, on the margin of the beach, were also in existence\r\nin 1841, having been erected a short time previously. The former is a\r\ntall circular column of painted stone, having an altitude of about 90\r\nfeet above high-water mark. The base of the column is square, each of\r\nthe sides being 12 feet high and 20 broad. The focus of the lantern is\r\n104 feet above half-tide level, and outside the reflector is a narrow,\r\ncircular, stone gallery, guarded by an iron fencing. The cost of the\r\ncolumn was £1,480. The other lighthouse is much smaller, and stands on a\r\nslightly elevated plot of ground. Each side of its base forms a recess,\r\nfurnished with seats, and supported above by round stone pillars. The\r\ncentre of the lantern is 44 feet above half-tide level. The whole fabric,\r\nwhich is built throughout of finely cut stone, was erected at a cost of\r\n£1,375.\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed the general appearance of the town in 1841,\r\nincluding brief accounts of all the more important buildings, but\r\naccidentally omitting to state that gas works were amongst the early\r\nerections, and before proceeding with the history of its further progress\r\nand increase, it will be convenient to revert for a moment to the railway\r\nand matters connected with it, leaving, however, the harbour, wharf,\r\nand shipping for separate examination towards the later pages of the\r\nchapter. The railway, consisting of a single line throughout the whole\r\nextent, was carried over a portion of the estuary of the Wyre, along an\r\nembankment and viaduct of huge wooden piles, running from Burn Naze to\r\nthe west extremity of the wharf at Fleetwood, near to which the station\r\nis situated. In 1846 the traffic, both in passengers and goods, had\r\nincreased so rapidly that the directors determined to have a double line\r\nwithout delay. Instructions for that purpose were accordingly issued to\r\nthe engineer of the company, and at the same time he was directed that,\r\nin order to afford space and facilities for the construction of the\r\nproposed docks to the westward of the existing railway piling, the double\r\nline should diverge at Burn Naze, run round the Cops, and terminate as\r\nbefore. The programme here stated was not fully carried out, and the\r\ndouble line extended only as far as Burn Naze, from which point a single\r\nline ran along a semicircular embankment, lying west of the old one, to\r\nthe terminus at Fleetwood.[84] This embankment was the means of rescuing\r\nfrom the incursions of the tide about 400 acres of marsh land, which has\r\nsince by drainage and cultivation been converted into excellent pastures\r\nand productive fields. The entire line was leased, under acts of 1846,\r\nto the Lancashire and Yorkshire and London and North Western Railway\r\ncompanies, the former taking two thirds and the latter one third of the\r\nprofits or losses. The terms agreed upon were a rent of £7 1s. 6d. per\r\ncent., and £1 15s. 4½d. per share on a total capital of £668,000, until\r\nthe close of 1854, when the payments were raised to £7 17s. 6d. per\r\ncent., and £1 19s. 3½d. per share in perpetuity. In the month of July,\r\n1846, the electric telegraph in connection with the Preston and Wyre\r\nRailway was introduced into the town, and as its first public act was\r\nthe interception, at Kirkham, of a defaulting steamship passenger, who\r\nhad neglected to pay her fare, it may be concluded that the inhabitants\r\nwelcomed the ingenious invention as a valuable ally in the protection of\r\ntheir commercial interests, as well as a rapid and convenient mode of\r\nfriendly intercommunion in cases of urgency.\r\n\r\nThe Improvement Act, for “paving, lighting, cleansing, and otherwise\r\nimproving the town of Fleetwood and the neighbourhood thereof, and for\r\nestablishing a market therein,” came into operation on the 18th of June,\r\n1842. Meetings were appointed to be held on the first Monday in every\r\nmonth, at which any male person was empowered to sit as a commissioner\r\non producing evidence that he was either a resident within the limits\r\nprescribed by the act, and rated to the poor-rates of the township of\r\nThornton for a local tenement of the annual value of £15, or possessed\r\nas owner or lessee or in the enjoyment of the rents and profits of a\r\nmessuage, lands, or hereditaments, similarly situated and rated, for a\r\nterm of not less than fifty years. In 1869 authority was obtained to\r\nrepeal certain sections of the old act and adopt others from the Public\r\nHealth Act of 1848, and the Local Government Act of 1858, the most\r\nimportant being that in future the Board of Commissioners should consist\r\nof twelve members only, having personally the same qualifications as\r\nbefore, but being elected by the ratepayers. The new regulations also\r\nordained that one third of the commissioners should retire each year, and\r\nthe vacancies be filled up by a general election. This act is still in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible that the claims of a place so happily situated\r\nas Fleetwood for a summer residence could long remain unrecognised by\r\nthe inhabitants of the inland towns. No sooner was free access given\r\nto its shores by the opening of the railway in 1840, than the hotels\r\nand lodging-houses were inundated with visitors, whose annual return\r\ntestified to their high appreciation of its mild climate, firm sands,\r\nexcellent boating accommodation, and lastly, the diversified and\r\nbeautiful scenery of the broad bay of Morecambe. A number of bathing\r\nvans were stationed on the shore opposite the Mount, but were little\r\npatronised during the first two or three seasons owing to the proprietors\r\ndemanding 1s. from each person using them, a sum exactly double that\r\nrequired at other watering-places. The injurious effects of this\r\nexorbitant charge were speedily experienced, not only by the van owners,\r\nwhose receipts were reduced to a minimum, but generally throughout the\r\ntown, as visitors who greatly preferred Fleetwood were driven to other\r\nplaces on that account, and each year many who came with the intention\r\nof remaining during the summer left because their families were debarred\r\nfrom bathing, except at an excessive cost. The error of so grasping a\r\npolicy being at last demonstrated to the proprietors by the small and\r\ndiminishing patronage extended to their vans, it was resolved, in 1844,\r\nto reduce the charge to 6d. That year several newly-erected houses in\r\nKemp Street were furnished and tenanted, whilst the hitherto unoccupied\r\nstone residences comprised in the Upper Queen’s Terrace were fitted up\r\nwith elegance and convenience for the wealthier class of sojourners, to\r\nwhom they were let for periods varying from a few weeks to three or four\r\nmonths. The terrace of houses situated between the North Euston Hotel and\r\nthe Mount, and bearing the latter name, was also completed that year. The\r\nprices at the North Euston Hotel were arranged as under:—\r\n\r\n  Sitting-room        3s. 4d. per day.\r\n  Bed-room            2s. 3d. and 4s. 0d. per day.\r\n  Table d’Hote        4s. per head.\r\n  Breakfast or Tea    2s. 0d. and 2s. 6d. per head.\r\n\r\nDuring the Whit-week of 1844 the place was crowded with excursionists,\r\nmany of whom, amounting to 1,000 daily, were carried at half fare by\r\nthe Preston and Wyre Railway, and came from the neighbouring towns and\r\nvillages, whilst others arrived by sea in excursion boats from Dublin,\r\nthe Isle of Man, Ulverstone, Blackpool, and Southport. Festivities were\r\nentered into on the warren and slopes of the Mount, lasting three days\r\nand consisting of horse, pony, donkey, foot, sack, and wheelbarrow races,\r\na cricket match, foot steeplechases, wrestling, and gingling matches.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Fleetwood was reduced from a distinct port to a creek under\r\nPreston, and during the month of July the mayor of the latter town paid a\r\nstate visit to the watering-place, arriving by sea in the small steamer\r\n“Lily.” A series of misfortunes rather tended to upset the dignity and\r\nimposing aspect of the official cortege. A somewhat rough sea retarded\r\ntheir passage and rapidly converted the ship into a temporary hospital\r\nfor that, perhaps, most distressing of all sicknesses; nearing, at last,\r\nthe lighthouse at the foot of Wyre, a large portion of the larboard\r\ngunwale was carried away by the bowsprit of the steamer “Express,” which\r\nhad been sent out to meet and tow them into harbour, if necessary; and\r\nfinally the unfortunate “Lily” stranded on a bank opposite the beach\r\nat Fleetwood, and the mayoral party, now pallid and dejected, in their\r\ngorgeous robes and liveries, were brought to land in small open boats,\r\nand having formed the following order, marched to the North Euston Hotel,\r\nwhere a banquet was prepared:—\r\n\r\n  Three Policemen.\r\n  Two Sergeants-at-Mace.\r\n  Mace Bearer.\r\n  The Mayor in his Robes of Office.\r\n  The Corporation Steward.\r\n  Recorder of the Borough.\r\n  The Aldermen of the Borough.\r\n  The Members of the Common Council.\r\n  Military Officers and Private Gentlemen.\r\n  Town Crier and Beadle.\r\n\r\nThis year the Preston and Wyre Railway Company, in conjunction with the\r\nline from Manchester and Bolton, commenced to run Sunday excursion trains\r\nto Fleetwood at reduced fares during the genial months of summer, and in\r\nAugust upwards of ten thousand pleasure-seekers were estimated to have\r\nbeen brought into the town by their means alone. These lines were amongst\r\nthe first to try the experiment of cheap trains, and the immense success\r\nwhich attended their efforts on the above occasions soon induced them to\r\nextend the privileges to other days besides the Sabbath. The promoters\r\nof private excursions, also, were offered facilities to direct their\r\ncourse to this watering-place. During the summer of 1844 no less than\r\n60,000 people in all, that is including both day excursionists and those\r\nwho remained for longer periods, arrived, being considerably more than\r\nin any previous season. In July, 1846, the whole of the workpeople of\r\nRichard Cobden, esq., M.P., the great free-trade statesman, visited the\r\ntown to celebrate the triumph of free-trade principles in parliament,\r\nthe entire expense of the trip being defrayed by that gentleman. Each of\r\nthe operatives and others, numbering about 1,300, had a free-trade medal\r\nsuspended by a ribbon from the neck; and, having formed in procession,\r\nthe large assembly paraded through the streets of Fleetwood, carrying\r\nbanners adorned with such appropriate mottoes and inscriptions as “Free\r\nTrade with all the World,” “Peel, Bright, and Cobden,” etc. In the same\r\nyear an immense Sunday school trip, bringing no less than 4,200 children\r\nand adults, arrived; and after amusing themselves by rambling about the\r\nshore for a time, the youthful multitude formed a huge pic-nic party on\r\nthe warren. This was without doubt the largest single excursion which\r\never visited these shores, and on its return, the enormous train of\r\ntwo engines and fifty-six carriages, many of which were cattle trucks\r\nprovided with forms and covered in with canvas, was divided, each engine\r\ntaking half, for fear of accidents and delays. In later times it was\r\nno uncommon circumstance to see the spacious wharf opposite the Upper\r\nand Lower Queen’s Terraces, crowded with cheap trains during Easter\r\nand Whit-weeks. Hourly trips in the small steam tug-boats or pleasure\r\nyachts, pony and donkey rides, bathing, and mussel gathering on the bank\r\nopposite the Mount Terrace were the chief amusements of the day visitors,\r\nand innumerable were the exclamations of wonder and delight uttered by\r\nthousands, who for the first time beheld\r\n\r\n  “The broad and bursting wave”\r\n\r\nat Fleetwood, for our readers may be reminded that at the date of which\r\nwe are writing, railway fares, except on special occasions, were beyond\r\nthe compass of the labouring populations of our manufacturing and\r\nagricultural districts, and consequently a visit to the, in many cases\r\nunknown, sea, was an event eagerly anticipated and long remembered.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1845, a general meeting of those who were interested in\r\nFleetwood, or wished to testify their respect and admiration for the\r\nnoble efforts of the founder of the town, was held at the North Euston\r\nHotel, to determine upon the most suitable public testimonial to be\r\nerected in honour of Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood. Doctor Ramsay proposed\r\nthat day schools for 200 children of the labouring classes, with a house\r\nfor a master and mistress, having the name of the “Fleetwood Testimonial\r\nSchools,” open to all denominations of Christians and connected with the\r\nNational Society, should be erected. This resolution was carried without\r\na dissentient; subscription lists were opened; and on Wednesday, the 26th\r\nof August, 1846, the foundation stone of the building was laid by Charles\r\nSwainson, esq., of Preston. Large numbers arrived early in the morning to\r\nbe present at the ceremony. The town, shipping, and river craft, decked\r\nout in bunting, presented quite a gala appearance as the officials and\r\nguests proceeded to the site in West Street. The procession marched as\r\nstated below:—\r\n\r\n  The Beadle.\r\n  Band.\r\n  The Wesleyan Sunday School Children.\r\n  The Independent Sunday School Children.\r\n  The Church Sunday School Children.\r\n  The Architect holding the Mallet and Trowel.\r\n  The Contractors.\r\n  The Clergy.\r\n  Charles Swainson, esq.\r\n  The Treasurer and Mr. Swainson’s Friends.\r\n  Rossall School.\r\n  The Gentry and Visitors.\r\n  The Tradesmen.\r\n  Independent Order of Oddfellows.\r\n  The Rechabites.\r\n\r\nIn the cavity beneath the foundation stone were enclosed a bottle\r\ncontaining coins of the present reign, a copy of the _Fleetwood\r\nChronicle_ of that date, printed on parchment, and another sheet of\r\nparchment inscribed thus:—\r\n\r\n  “The first stone of these schools, which are to be erected as\r\n  the fittest Testimonial to the benevolent founder of this town,\r\n  Sir P. H. Fleetwood, Bart., M.P., was laid by Charles Swainson,\r\n  Esq., of Preston, this 26th day of August, 1846.\r\n\r\n    THE REV. ST. VINCENT BEECHEY, M.A., Incumbent;\r\n    THE REV. W. LAIDLAY, B.A., Curate;\r\n    B. WALMSLEY, FREDERICK KEMP, Churchwardens;\r\n    THE REV. JOHN HULL, Vicar of Poulton, Chairman of the Committee.\r\n    JOHN LAIDLAY, Esq., Treasurer of the Committee;\r\n    R. B. RAMPLING, Esq., Architect;\r\n    H. B. JONES, Esq., Secretary.\r\n\r\n  Non nobis, Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam.”\r\n\r\nThis scholastic institution is in the Gothic style of architecture, and\r\nthe principal front, facing into West Street, extends over a distance\r\nof seventy-one feet. The interior of the building contains separate\r\nschool accommodation for boys and girls; and at the east end there is\r\na comfortable residence for the mistress. The school is surrounded by\r\nan extensive play-ground, and enclosed by a brick wall, surmounted\r\nanteriorly by ornamental iron railings. Since the building was completed\r\nthe provision for the reception of boys has been greatly increased by the\r\nerection of a new wing, by private munificence, abutting at right angles\r\nwith the east end of the original structure.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1845 a handsome promenade and carriage drive was\r\ncompleted along the border of the shore from the North Euston Hotel to\r\nthe west extremity of the Mount Terrace. The pathway, which ran on the\r\ninner side of the drive, was flagged throughout its entire length, whilst\r\nthe outer margin of the road was connected with a substantial sea-wall\r\nof square-cut stone by a broad and well-kept grass plat. Subsequently\r\nthis elegant walk was extended round the south side of the Mount, along\r\nAbbots’ Walk, and so on by the side of the shore to the Cemetery Road.\r\nVery little of the portion first constructed is now to be seen, and that\r\nremnant is in such a dilapidated condition as almost to be impassable.\r\nHuge stones which formerly protected the green sward and road from the\r\nwaves are now lying scattered and buried about the beach; whilst the\r\nwesterly end of the promenade has not only suffered utter annihilation\r\nitself, but serious inroads have been made by the water into the\r\nornamental gardens fronting the houses of the Mount Terrace.\r\n\r\nStrenuous efforts were put forth during the autumn of 1845 to prevent\r\nthe visitors forsaking the town immediately the long evenings had\r\ncommenced; pyrotechnic displays took place each week on the plot of land\r\nlying to the north of the Upper Queen’s Terrace, and designated the\r\nArchery Ground. Sea excursions to Blackpool, Southport, and Piel Harbour\r\nwere liberally provided for by the steamers of the port; a military\r\nband was hired for several weeks, and played daily either on one of the\r\npleasure craft or near the new promenade; foot races, wrestling, and\r\ncricket matches were arranged and contested at short intervals. But\r\nall in vain, for towards the end of August the reflux of visitors had\r\nthoroughly set in, and by the middle of September the shores were almost\r\ndeserted. During that brief period of excitement it was proposed amongst\r\nthe inhabitants to erect a large public building to be ready for the\r\nensuing season, which should combine all the advantages of a reading and\r\nnews room, public library, bazaar, ball room, and theatre; but either the\r\nardour of the people cooled during the winter months or they failed to\r\ndiscern a fair prospect of dividends from the investment, for the summer\r\nof 1846 discovered that the idea had vanished with the closing year, and\r\n\r\n  “Like the baseless fabric of a vision,\r\n  Left not a wreck behind.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, it is going too far to assert that no trace or vestige\r\nof the comprehensive project remained after the first ebullition of\r\nenthusiasm had passed from the popular mind, for we find that, although\r\nno noble hall graced the town, a Mechanics’ Institution was modestly\r\nestablished on the 18th of May, 1846, by the opening of a reading room\r\nin one portion of the Estate Office. This office formerly occupied\r\nthe site of the present Whitworth Institute, and was a small, lightly\r\nconstructed, Gothic edifice. Subsequently a larger and more convenient\r\nplace for the purposes of the Institution was engaged in Dock Street; a\r\nlibrary was provided and arrangements made for lectures and classes to be\r\nheld on the premises. In the report of the establishment, issued twelve\r\nmonths after its foundation, it was stated that the members at that date\r\namounted to 184, being 138 full members, 20 females, and 26 youths and\r\napprentices; and that since its organisation 213 persons had availed\r\nthemselves of the privileges offered by the society. A considerable\r\nnumber of cottage houses were erected in different parts of the town,\r\nand not only were these tenanted directly they were completed, but the\r\ndemand for further building was still on the increase. A public abattoir,\r\nor slaughter-house, was constructed in 1846 on the outskirts of the town,\r\nand a notice issued, prohibiting the slaying of any cattle, sheep, or\r\nswine anywhere except within its walls, under a penalty of £5 for every\r\noffence. A Wesleyan chapel was also in course of erection in North Church\r\nStreet, then open warren, and finished the following year, divine service\r\nbeing first conducted in it on Monday, the 24th of May, by the Rev.\r\nGeorge Osborne, of Liverpool. As the town gradually developed in size and\r\npopulation, the attendants at this place of worship outgrew the space\r\nprovided for them, and lately, in 1875, it became necessary to enlarge\r\nthe edifice. The west gable-end was taken out and the main building\r\nextended in that direction. Galleries were placed along the two sides\r\nand across the east wall; the old-fashioned pulpit was superseded by a\r\nplatform situated at the centre of the west end, and extending to within\r\nsix feet of the galleries at either side. The new sittings resemble the\r\nold ones in being closed pews, and not open benches. The chapel is now\r\ncapable of containing double the congregation it could have held previous\r\nto the recent alterations.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, 1847, an extraordinary high tide, rendered\r\nmore formidable by strong westerly winds, did great damage on the coast\r\nfrom here to Rossall; the Landmark was so far undermined that its fall\r\nwas hourly expected; an embankment raised on the shore from that point\r\nto Rossall suffered severely, large portions being completely washed\r\naway; and the outbuildings of a farm called “Fenny” were overthrown\r\nand destroyed, serious injury being done also to the land in the\r\nneighbourhood. The more immediate vicinities of the town escaped with\r\ncomparatively little loss, the most important being that resulting\r\nfrom the inundation of several fields and gardens near the Cops, and\r\nthe levelling of a few wooden sheds for labourers’ tools and other\r\noutbuildings.\r\n\r\nA failure in the potatoe and grain harvests of 1846 spread fearful\r\ndistress and famine throughout the United Kingdom; bread riots and\r\ndisturbances amongst the starving poor of Ireland were of frequent\r\noccurrence, and it was to assist in alleviating the sufferings of those\r\nunfortunate people that a subscription was started in Fleetwood during\r\nthe latter months of that year. Donations purely from the inhabitants\r\nof the town were collected, and in January, 1847, the sum of £105 was\r\nforwarded to the sister country. In consequence of the severe national\r\naffliction, Her Majesty ordained that Wednesday, the 24th of the\r\nfollowing March, should be observed as a general fast-day. On that date\r\nall the shops in the watering place, with one or two exceptions, were\r\nclosed; the public-houses and streets were quiet; and stillness and\r\nsolemnity everywhere apparent. The church was crowded to overflowing;\r\nevery seat was packed, and forms were brought in from the Sunday school\r\nand placed in the aisles to create extra accommodation, so excessive\r\nwas the congregation which assembled to join in the special service for\r\ndivine intervention.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 20th of September, 1847, Her Majesty, Queen Victoria,\r\naccompanied by their Royal Highnesses, the Prince Consort, the Prince\r\nof Wales, and the Princess Royal, landed at Fleetwood _en route_ from\r\nScotland to London. The spot fixed for the debarkation of the royal party\r\nwas near the north end of the covered pier, upwards of 100 feet of which\r\nwere boarded off and converted into a saloon, a covered gallery being\r\nerected leading from it to the railway, where the special train was\r\nstationed. The floors of the saloon and gallery were covered with crimson\r\ndrugget and at the entrance to the former a beautiful triumphal arch was\r\nformed of various coloured draperies, and adorned with the national flag\r\nand other emblems of loyalty. The walls of the saloon were hung with\r\nwhite and coloured draperies, festooned with evergreens, and British\r\nensigns were suspended from the roof. This elegant apartment contained a\r\ngallery for ladies at the north end, and near to the entrance was a small\r\noctagonal throne, having an ascent of three steps, upon which a handsome\r\ngilded chair of state and a footstool were placed. Behind the two latter,\r\ndraperies of crimson cloth were suspended, surmounted by the Arms of Her\r\nMajesty. On Sunday, the 19th of September, the High-sheriff of the county\r\nof Lancaster, William Gale, esq., of Lightburne House, near Ulverston,\r\nwho had arrived in order to receive Her Majesty on the following day,\r\nattended divine worship at St. Peter’s Church, being driven there\r\nin his state carriage, drawn by four splendid greys and preceded by\r\nhis trumpeters and twenty-four javelin men with halberds. Monday was\r\nushered in with boisterous winds, a cloudy sky, and other indications of\r\nunpropitious weather, which fortunately for the thousands who crowded\r\ninto the place from Yorkshire, Manchester, and intermediate localities,\r\nconsiderably improved as the day advanced. The ships in the harbour were\r\ndraped with flags, and similar decorations floated from the windows of\r\nalmost every house. A little after three o’clock in the afternoon the\r\nreport of a signal gun announced that the royal squadron, consisting of\r\nthe Victoria and Albert, the Black Eagle, the Fairy, the Garland, and the\r\nUndine, was in sight, and as the noble vessels steamed up the channel the\r\nNorth Euston Hotel and the Pier burst out into brilliant illuminations.\r\nAs soon as the royal yacht, Victoria and Albert, had been safely moored\r\nto the quay opposite the triumphal arch, and the gangways adjusted, the\r\nHigh-sheriff, W. Gale, esq.; Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, K.C.B.;\r\nSir P. H. Fleetwood, bart.; Major-General Sir William Warre; John Wilson\r\nPatten, esq., M.P.; the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey, incumbent of Fleetwood;\r\nHenry Houldsworth, esq., chairman of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\r\nCompany; George Wilson, esq., deputy-chairman; and Thomas H. Higgin,\r\nesq., managing director of the Preston and Wyre district; presented their\r\ncards, and explained to Captain Beechey the several arrangements which\r\nhad been made for Her Majesty’s conveyance to London. Afterwards Sir P.\r\nH. Fleetwood, the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey, Frederick Kemp, and James\r\nCrombleholme, esqrs., of Fleetwood; and Daniel Elletson, esq., of Parrox\r\nHall, were admitted to an interview with Lord Palmerston, who, on behalf\r\nof Her Majesty, received the subjoined address from the inhabitants of\r\nFleetwood, printed in gold on white satin, and promised that it should be\r\nlaid before the Queen:—\r\n\r\n  “THE LOYAL AND DUTIFUL ADDRESS OF THE INHABITANTS OF FLEETWOOD,\r\n  TO HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\n  “_May it Please your Majesty_,\r\n\r\n  “We, the Inhabitants of the Town of Fleetwood, in the county of\r\n  Lancaster, desire to approach your Majesty on this auspicious\r\n  occasion, with the most sincere expression of our devoted\r\n  loyalty and attachment to your Majesty, of our deep respect and\r\n  esteem for your Majesty’s august Consort, for his Royal Highness\r\n  the Prince of Wales, and the other members of the Royal Family.\r\n\r\n  “We beg to assure your Majesty that it is with feelings of the\r\n  liveliest gratitude that we hail this Royal visit to our humble\r\n  shores, now for the first time pressed by the foot of Sovereignty.\r\n\r\n  “We rejoice to think that it has fallen to our happy lot to\r\n  be the first to welcome the Queen of England to her own Royal\r\n  Patrimony in the Duchy of Lancaster.\r\n\r\n  “We hasten to lay at your Majesty’s feet the dutiful allegiance\r\n  of the inhabitants of the youngest Town and Port in all your\r\n  Majesty’s dominions, which dates its existence from the very year\r\n  in which your Majesty first ascended the Throne of these realms;\r\n  and which, from the barren and uninhabited sands of the Fylde of\r\n  Lancashire, has already obtained some importance for its town\r\n  of 3,000 inhabitants, its Watering-place, Harbour, and Railway,\r\n  together with its College for the sons of clergymen and other\r\n  gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  “We sincerely trust, that the natural facilities and local\r\n  arrangements of this Port may be found such as shall conduce to\r\n  the safety, comfort, and convenience of your Majesty in your\r\n  royal progress. And we beseech your Majesty to receive our united\r\n  and solemn assurance, that whatever progress our Harbour and Town\r\n  may make in wealth and importance, it shall ever be our firmest\r\n  determination and most earnest prayer, that we may never cease\r\n  to boast of a loyal population, entertaining the same feeling of\r\n  devoted duty and attachment to your Majesty and the Royal Family,\r\n  which we experience at this moment, and which the grateful\r\n  remembrance of this Royal visit must ever tend to keep alive in\r\n  our bosoms.\r\n\r\n  “Signed on behalf of the Inhabitants,\r\n\r\n                “ST. VINCENT BEECHEY, M.A., Incumbent of Fleetwood.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing address the annexed reply was received from London in\r\nthe course of a few days:—\r\n\r\n                                  “Whitehall, 25th September, 1847.\r\n\r\n  “SIR,—I am directed by the Secretary, Sir George Grey, to inform\r\n  you, that the Loyal and Dutiful Address of the Inhabitants of\r\n  Fleetwood, on the occasion of Her Majesty’s late visit, has been\r\n  laid before the Queen, and that the same was very graciously\r\n  received by Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n  “I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                               (Signed)\r\n\r\n                                               “DENNIS LE MERCHANT.\r\n\r\n  “Rev. St. Vincent Beechey, Incumbent of Fleetwood.”\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the handsome saloon was occupied by the High-sheriff,\r\nthe Under-sheriff, and a select number of gentlemen, and shortly after\r\nten o’clock Her Majesty and the royal party proceeded from the yacht to\r\nthe special train amid joyful acclamations which resounded from all parts\r\nof the shore. The moment Her Majesty set foot, for the first time, on her\r\nDuchy of Lancaster, the royal standard was lowered from the mast-head of\r\nthe yacht, and instantly raised on the flag-staff at the custom-house of\r\nFleetwood, where it received a salute of twenty-one guns. After another\r\nsalute of a similar number of guns, as Her Majesty reached the end of\r\nthe gallery, the royal party entered their saloon carriage, Mr., now\r\nSir John, Hawskshaw, engineer to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\r\nCompany, took his station on the engine, and the train moved slowly off,\r\nfollowed by the ringing cheers of at least ten thousand spectators.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that a loyal address, written in Latin, from the\r\nstudents of the Northern Church of England School, at Rossall, arrived\r\ntoo late for presentation, and was afterwards forwarded to London.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1847, Mr. Thomas Drummond, contractor, commenced\r\nthe erection of the present Independent Chapel in West Street, and\r\nnotwithstanding a serious delay through the destruction of the north\r\ngable and roof-framing by a heavy gale in September, the building was\r\ncompleted the same year. The edifice, which will contain about 600\r\npersons, is a neat brick structure with side buttresses, and adorned with\r\na castellated tower. Beneath the chapel are spacious school-rooms for\r\nboys and girls. The site was granted by Sir P. H. Fleetwood, and conveyed\r\nin trust for the use of the church and congregation.\r\n\r\nFor two or three years little of special interest occurred in the\r\nprogress or condition of the town. Each summer brought its assembly of\r\nregular visitors, upon whom many of the inhabitants depended for support,\r\nwhilst Whit-week annually inundated the warren, streets, and shores with\r\ncrowds of day-excursionists, for whose benefit sports, resembling those\r\nto which allusion has already been made, were instituted. Regattas also\r\nwere added to the other attractions of the watering-place, but after\r\nexisting for some little time they gradually died out, either because\r\nthey failed to excite their former interest amongst the visitors, or\r\nthe public spirit of the inhabitants was tardy in providing the funds\r\nnecessary for their continuance. Houses in Albert Street, and in other\r\nparts of the town, were slowly increasing in number, but no large demand\r\nfor dwellings bespoke a rapid rise in the prosperity or popularity of the\r\nplace, like that to which we referred a little earlier. Trade, although\r\ncomparatively steady, evinced no signs of enlargement at present, and\r\nas a consequence fresh families hesitated to venture their fortunes in\r\nthe new land, until some more regular and reliable means of gaining a\r\nlivelihood were offered them than the precarious patronage of uncertain\r\nvisitors, many of whom, now that free access had been given to Blackpool\r\nand Lytham through the opening of branch lines, were already being\r\nseduced from their old allegiance to Fleetwood, and attracted to the\r\ngayer promenades of those rival resorts.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1852, and just at the Christmas season, a\r\nfearful hurricane swept over Fleetwood; slates, chimney tops, and\r\nboardings were torn from their fastenings, and hurled about the streets;\r\nindeed so terrific was the violence of this gale that at its height it\r\nwas difficult for the pedestrian to avoid being forced along by its\r\nfury in whatsoever direction the huge gusts willed. During the storm\r\na singular accident occurred in the harbour. The barque “Hope,” which\r\nhad arrived shortly before from America with timber, was lying in the\r\nriver attached to one of the buoys, and by some carelessness the men\r\nemployed in unloading her had neglected, on leaving their work, to\r\nclose up the large square hole near the stem of the ship, through which\r\nthe baulks of wood were discharged. The hurricane came on fiercely and\r\nsuddenly from the west, and, to the dismay of the solitary watchman who\r\nhad been left in charge of the vessel, heeled over her lightened hull\r\nso that the swollen and boisterous tide poured wave after wave through\r\nthe unprotected aperture at her bows; a few minutes only were needed\r\nto complete the catastrophe, for as the vessel settled in the deep, no\r\nlonger waves but continuous volumes of water rushed into her, and with\r\na heavy lurch she rolled over on her side, the masts and more than half\r\nher hull being submerged. Fortunately, however, the remnant of the cargo\r\nwas sufficiently buoyant to prevent her from vanishing bodily beneath\r\nthe surface. The luckless guardian, whose feelings must have been far\r\nfrom enviable, was quickly rescued from the perilous position he occupied\r\non the floating portion of the ship; but it was not until some weeks\r\nafterwards that they were able, in the words of the poet Cowper,\r\n\r\n  “To weigh the vessel up.”\r\n\r\nThe “Hope,” 415 tons register, was built up the river at the old port\r\nof Wardleys, being the only vessel of such dimensions constructed in\r\nthe shipyard there. Ten years later, on the 27th of February, 1862, this\r\nill-fated barque was abandoned on the high seas in a sinking condition.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 sundry improvements were effected in the extent and condition\r\nof the place, and consisted in part of the erection of a row of model\r\ncottages in Poulton Road, near the entrance to the town, as well as a\r\nnew police Station in West Street, comprising two dwellings for the\r\nconstables and cells for prisoners. The streets were also put in better\r\norder, and efforts made to render the aspect of Fleetwood more finished\r\nand pleasing than it had been during the two or three previous seasons. A\r\nscheme for the partial drainage of the town was proposed at the assembly\r\nof commissioners, and arrangements were entered into for the work to be\r\npromptly carried out at an estimated cost of £1,200. Altogether a sudden\r\nspirit of activity seemed to have superseded the lethargy or indifference\r\nwhich lately had been too much visible amongst the inhabitants in all\r\nmatters of public interest, and which had already exercised a serious\r\nand baneful influence upon the prospects of the place as a sea-side\r\nresort. In the ensuing year the body of Primitive Methodists, which\r\nhad now become rather numerous, chiefly owing to the prosperity of the\r\nfishing trade attracting many followers of that calling to the port,\r\nmost of whom were members of this sect, commenced and completed a chapel\r\nin West Street. Recently it has been found necessary considerably to\r\nenlarge the edifice, in order to furnish more accommodation for the\r\nincreasing congregation. Although the erection of this chapel and of\r\nthe other buildings mentioned above mark undoubtedly an era of progress\r\nin the history of the town, still we are constrained to admit that the\r\nwants they supplied were not brought about by the spread of Fleetwood’s\r\nreputation as a watering-place. From the first little had been done to\r\nsupplement its natural attractions by laying out elegant promenades, or\r\nimproving the state of the Cops or Poulton Road, so as to render them\r\nagreeable rural walks for many who, after a time, grew weary of watching\r\nthe eddies and dimples of the river’s current\r\n\r\n  “Play round the bows of ships,\r\n  That steadily at anchor rode;”\r\n\r\nor of daily rambling where the receding waves left a broad floor of\r\nfirm, unbroken sands. True, a carriage-drive and foot-way of some\r\npretensions to beauty had been constructed along the north shore in 1845,\r\nbut the storms we have described, and other heavy seas, had torn breaches\r\nin its wall, and made sad havoc amongst its light sandy material,\r\ncompletely ruining the fair appearance of the shoreward grass-plat, and\r\nthreatening the road with that very destruction which has since overtaken\r\nit through the continued negligence of the residents or governing\r\npowers. There was no public hall, such as that once contemplated, where\r\na feeling of fellowship might be engendered amongst the visitors. The\r\nregattas instituted for the interest and amusement it was hoped they\r\nwould excite amongst the spectators were, as previously stated, conducted\r\nin a desultory manner for a few years, and then abandoned; whilst the\r\nland sports during the week of high festival were discontinued as the\r\nWhit-week excursion trains found other outlets more attractive than\r\nFleetwood for their pleasure-seeking thousands; but it was not until the\r\nNorth Euston Hotel was opened for military purposes, that all hope of\r\nreviving the fading reputation of the town as a summer resort was finally\r\nrelinquished. For some little time after the foregoing transfer, the\r\nbathing vans, as if to keep up the fiction of the season, re-appeared\r\nwith uninterrupted regularity each year upon the beach, but even that\r\nlast connecting link between the deserted town, as far as visitors were\r\nconcerned, and its former popularity, was doomed shortly to be broken,\r\nfor the ancient machines, never renewed, and seldom repaired, were at\r\nlength unequal to the rough journey over the cobble stones, and crumbled\r\nto pieces on the way, expiring miserably in the cause of duty, from old\r\nage and unmerited neglect.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1859, a lifeboat, thirty feet in length, was\r\nstationed here by the National Lifeboat Institution, and in the month of\r\nSeptember in the same year, a neat and substantial house was built for it\r\non the beach opposite the North Euston Hotel. After doing good service\r\nalong the coast, in rescuing several crews whose vessels had stranded\r\namidst the breakers on the outlying sand-banks, this boat was superseded,\r\nin 1862, by one of larger dimensions. In January, 1863, the erection\r\non the beach was swept away by the billows during a heavy gale, and in\r\nthe course of a few months the present structure in Pharos Street, far\r\nremoved from the reach of the destructive element, was raised, and the\r\nlifeboat transferred to its safer keeping.\r\n\r\nThe census of the residents taken in 1861 showed a total of 4,061\r\npersons, being an increase of 940 over the number in 1851, and of 1,228\r\nover that in 1841. Hence it is seen that during the long period of twenty\r\nyears, almost from its commencement to the date now under consideration,\r\nthrough fluctuating seasons of prosperous and depressed trade, the town\r\nhad succeeded in adding no more than 1,228 individuals to the roll of\r\nits inhabitants, many of whom would be the offspring of the original\r\nsettlers. Truly the foregoing picture is not a very satisfactory one to\r\nreview when we call to mind the bright auspices under which the place\r\nwas started,—the early and ample railway accommodation, the short and\r\nwell-beaconed channel, and the safe and spacious harbour; but could\r\nwe only add the extensive area of docks, the Fleetwood of 1871 would\r\ndoubtless have presented a widely different aspect to that we are here\r\ncalled upon to portray. It is scarcely just, however, to lay all the\r\nburden of this slow rate of progress on the want of suitable berth\r\nprovision for heavily-laden vessels coming to the harbour. Fleetwood had\r\nother means of extending its circle besides those derived from its happy\r\nsituation for shipping trade. Its merits as a watering-place were allowed\r\non every hand; eulogistic versions of its special charms were circulated\r\nthrough the public prints; strangers flocked each summer to its shores,\r\nand were enchanted with their visits; but after a while the refreshing\r\nnovelty wore off, and the puny efforts made by those whose interests in\r\nthe prosperity of the town were greatest, failed to fill the inevitable\r\nvoid the waning newness left in its train. In the meantime other season\r\nplaces, urged on by emulation, enhanced the beauties of nature by works\r\nof art; promenades, walks, drives, and, at no distant period, piers,\r\nwere constructed to meet the popular demands, and in that way the tide\r\nof visitors was turned from the non-progressive and now over familiar\r\nattractions of Fleetwood to swell the annually increasing streams which\r\noverflowed the rising towns of Blackpool and Lytham. The year 1861 will\r\never be remarkable in the history of Fleetwood as being the date at which\r\nthe town was for the first time practically diverted from that line of\r\nprogress which its founder, in too sanguine expectancy, had early marked\r\nout for it. Its decadence as a summer resort had been too pronounced to\r\nallow of any hope being entertained that a revulsion was probable, or\r\neven possible, in the feelings and tastes of the multitude, which would\r\nagain people its shores, during the warm months, with a heterogeneous\r\ncrowd of valetudinarians and pleasure-seekers. The noble hotel which\r\nhad been erected by Sir P. H. Fleetwood on the northern margin of the\r\nshore, in a style of architecture and at an expense which bore witness\r\nto the firm confidence of the baronet in the brilliant future awaiting\r\nthe infant town, had been sold to Government, as previously stated, in\r\n1859, but it was not until two years afterwards that the first detachment\r\nof officers took up their quarters in the newly-established School of\r\nMusketry, and Fleetwood awoke to the novel sound of martial music and\r\nthe reputation of being a military centre. Rumour, also, had for several\r\nmonths been active in circulating a report that the sward lying between\r\nthe Landmark and the cemetery, and a field at the corner of Cemetery\r\nRoad, had attracted the eye of Government as a suitable locality whereon\r\nto place barracks and lay out a rifle-practice ground; and in February,\r\n1861, doubt on the subject was no longer admissible, for the contract to\r\ncarry out the fresh project was let during that month to the gentleman\r\nwho had been engaged in the necessary alterations at the North Euston\r\nHotel. The scheme involved the creation of residential accommodation in\r\nthe field just indicated for a small force of 220 men and 12 officers,\r\nsome of the quarters being specially designed for married soldiers,\r\nin addition to which lavatories, a canteen, mess-room, magazine, and\r\nguard-house, were to be erected. The work was entered on without delay,\r\nand at no long interval, about ten months, or rather more, the whole\r\nof the buildings were completed, and soon afterwards occupied. The\r\npractice-ground was marked out for range firing, and butts provided,\r\nwhere the targets were shortly stationed. A spacious hospital, it should\r\nbe mentioned, was constructed almost contemporaneously with the main\r\nportion of the barrack buildings.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 20th of May, 1861, a mass meeting was convened to\r\nascertain the opinion of the inhabitants with regard to a claim of\r\nexclusive use of the road over the Mount-hill, which had recently been\r\nset up by Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, who in order to establish his\r\nright had caused a cobble wall to be erected round that portion of\r\nthe estate. The meeting, consisting of about three hundred persons,\r\nwas held on the pathway in dispute, which crosses the highest point of\r\nthe elevation. A platform was raised, and a chairman, elected by the\r\nunanimous voice of the company, ascended the rostrum, being accompanied\r\nby several of the more enthusiastic advocates of free-road, who in the\r\ncourse of earnest addresses declared that for twenty years the Mount had\r\nbeen dedicated to the public service, in consideration of certain sums\r\npaid annually to the lord of the manor out of the town’s rates, and that\r\nhaving been so long the property of the people, Sir P. H. Fleetwood had\r\nnow no moral or legal title to wrest it from them. The ardent language of\r\nthe speakers aroused a sympathetic feeling in the breasts of the small\r\nmultitude, and murmurs of discontent at the attempted deprivation of\r\ntheir privileges had already assumed a threatening tone, when a gentleman\r\nwho happened to be visiting the neighbourhood, appeared upon the scene,\r\nand in a few spirited words urged the excited listeners to some speedy\r\nmanifestation of their disapproval. Uttering a shout of indignation and\r\ndefiance the crowd rushed at the enclosure wall, tore down the masonry,\r\nand quickly opened out a wide breach through the offending structure,\r\nafter which they filled the air with triumphant cheers and shortly\r\nretired homewards in a comparatively orderly manner. In the course of a\r\nfew months the vexatious question was settled between the representatives\r\nof the town and Sir P. H. Fleetwood, who on his part agreed only to\r\nretain to himself a plot of land fifty yards square, lying on the west\r\nside of the hill; another piece one hundred yards square, extending from\r\nthe base of the elevation to the sea; the wooden edifice on the summit\r\nof the mound; six square yards whereon to erect a look-out house for the\r\nCoastguards; and the gardens and cottage-lodges at the entrance. The\r\nremainder of the Mount, amounting to about three-fourths, was given up to\r\nthe public, together with the right of footway through the cottages just\r\nmentioned, and over the east and west plots; the commissioners engaging,\r\non their side, to erect and maintain a suitable fence round the Mount,\r\nand to keep the hill itself in a proper manner for the benefit of the\r\ninhabitants or visitors, as well as binding themselves upon no account to\r\nraise any building on the site. The entire ground, with the buildings,\r\nhas since been given, on much the same conditions, to the town.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1862 the town, which for some time had lain dormant in\r\na commercial point of view, evinced unmistakable signs of returning\r\nanimation; trade was more active, rumour once more hinted at the probable\r\ncommencement of docks at an early date, and ninety-five houses of\r\nmoderate size were erected. In the earlier half of the following twelve\r\nmonths no less than thirty-seven more dwellings were added to the town,\r\nthe foundations of several others being in course of preparation. A\r\nbranch of the Preston Banking Company was also opened for a few hours\r\nonce in each week; and during later years has transacted business daily.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 20th of January, 1863, a storm and flood, such as has\r\nseldom been witnessed on this coast, arose suddenly and raged with fury\r\nfor about twenty hours. The whole of the wall under the Mount, which\r\nhad been brought to light by some gales in the previous November, after\r\nhaving been buried in the sand for long, was utterly demolished, not\r\none stone being left upon another. In addition, the breakers penetrated\r\nwith destructive violence, several yards inland beyond the line of\r\nthat barrier throughout its whole length, from the west end of the\r\nEuston Barracks to the further extremity of Abbot’s Walk. A wooden\r\nbattery of two 32-pound guns at the foot of the Mount, belonging to the\r\nCoastguards,[85] and used for training the Naval Volunteer Reserve,\r\nwas undermined and so tilted that its removal became a necessity. The\r\nmarine fence, which had been constructed at an immense cost, between\r\nthe Landmark and Cleveleys, was almost entirely swept away, leaving\r\nthe adjacent country open to the inundations of the sea, which rushed\r\nover and flooded all the land between the points just named, extending\r\neastward even to the embankment of the Preston and Wyre Railway. Several\r\nof the streets at the west side of Fleetwood were under water, as also\r\nwere the fields about Poulton road and the highway itself. The proprietor\r\nof the “Strawberry Garden,” off the same road, and his family, were\r\ncompelled to take refuge in an upper storey of their dwelling until\r\nrescued in a boat, the following day, from their unpleasant, if not\r\nperilous, position. It was in this hurricane that the house erected\r\non the shore for the reception of the lifeboat suffered annihilation,\r\nand the boat itself narrowly escaped serious damage. Tuesday, the 10th\r\nof March, in the same year was observed by the residents as a general\r\nholiday and gala day, in honour of the marriage of Albert Edward, Prince\r\nof Wales, with the Danish Princess, Alexandra. Flags and banners floated\r\nfrom the windows of nearly every habitation, as well as from the roofs\r\nof many, while the steamships and other vessels in the harbour were\r\ngaily decorated with bunting, which waved in rich and varied tints from\r\ntheir masts, spars, and rigging. Triumphal arches of the “colours of\r\nall nations” were suspended across the streets at several points. A\r\nlarge procession of schools and friendly societies in full regalia, with\r\ntheir banners and devices, paraded the different thoroughfares, and were\r\nafterwards sumptuously entertained, the latter at their various lodges,\r\nand the former in the large area of a cotton warehouse, recently built on\r\nthe quay by Messrs. B. Whitworth and Bros., of Manchester. The military\r\nstationed at the School of Musketry evinced their loyalty by discharging\r\na _feu de joie_ on the warren. In the following November a scheme was\r\nproposed for the construction of a coast railway between Fleetwood and\r\nBlackpool, to pass through Rossall and Bispham. A survey was made of\r\nthe route, and according to the plans drawn out, the projected line\r\nwas intended to have its Fleetwood terminus at the south extremity of\r\nPoulton Terrace, opposite the end of West Street, whence it was to run\r\ntowards the new barracks, near the cemetery, then diverge to the south\r\nin the direction of Rossall. From Rossall its course lay towards Bispham\r\nand thence onwards to the Blackpool terminus, which would be located\r\nin Queen’s street, adjoining the station already standing there. The\r\nstations, besides those at the two termini, were to be placed at the\r\nbarracks, Rossall, and Bispham. At Fleetwood the promoters proposed to\r\nform a junction with the Preston and Wyre Railway near the old timber\r\npond, for the purpose of passing carriages from one line to the other,\r\nwhilst at Blackpool a similar object would be effected with the Lytham\r\nand Blackpool Railway by deviating eastward from Queen Street, so as\r\nto avoid the town, and establishing a junction with the latter line\r\nnear Chapel Street. On an application being made to parliament for\r\npowers to carry out the design, strenuous opposition was offered by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Preston and Wyre Railway, who pledged themselves\r\nto erect additional stations along their track to accommodate the people\r\nresiding at Rossall, Cleveleys, and Bispham, in consequence of which the\r\nbill for a coast-line was thrown out and the project abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, 1863, the Lancaster Banking Company established\r\na branch here; and on the 15th of that month the Whitworth Institute in\r\nDock Street was publicly opened. This handsome Hall was erected through\r\nthe munificence of Benjamin Whitworth, esq., M.P., of London, who for\r\nlong resided at Fleetwood, and during that period, and afterwards, was\r\ninstrumental in giving a marked stimulus to the foreign trade of the\r\nport by shipping each year, on behalf of the large firm of which he is\r\nthe head at Manchester, numerous cargoes of cotton from America _viâ_\r\nFleetwood. The building is in the Gothic style of architecture. The walls\r\nare built of bricks with stone dressings, the principal features being\r\nthe ten arcaded windows, with the stone balcony beneath running across\r\nthe entire width of the front, and the elegant entrance. The interior\r\ncomprises a spacious reading room and library, a smoking and coffee room,\r\nprovided with chess and draughts, an assembly room, capable of containing\r\n400 persons, and two billiard rooms. At the time of its presentation\r\nto the inhabitants the donor generously provided tea urns and other\r\nappliances necessary for holding soirees, in addition to having liberally\r\nfurnished the whole of the building, including the gift of a choice and\r\nextensive selection of books, chess and draught-men, a bagatelle-board,\r\nand a billiard-table. The second billiard-table was added out of the\r\nsurplus funds in 1875. The Institute is vested in trustees for the use of\r\nthe town, and governed by a committee chosen from amongst the subscribers.\r\n\r\nDuring 1864-5 building continued to progress, but not with that great\r\nrapidity which had characterised its advance in 1862 and the earlier\r\nmonths of the following year. An act of parliament was granted in 1864\r\nto certain gentlemen for the formation of a dock in connection with the\r\nharbour, confirming the rumour which had now agitated the place for the\r\nlast two years, and bringing conviction to the hearts of many of the\r\nolder inhabitants, whose past experience had taught them to look with\r\neyes of distrust on all reports which pointed to such a happy realisation\r\nof their youthful dreams. The inaugural ceremony of breaking the turf did\r\nnot, however, take place for some time, and will be noticed shortly. On\r\nthe 17th of May, 1866, the foundation stone of the present Roman Catholic\r\nchurch in East Street was laid by Doctor Goss, bishop of Liverpool,\r\nwho performed the ceremony, attired in full ecclesiastical robes, and\r\nattended by a numerous retinue of priests and choristers. The sacred\r\nedifice was opened on Sunday, the 24th of November in the ensuing year.\r\nIts general style is early English of the 13th century. The building\r\nconsists of a nave and two aisles, with an apsidal sanctuary at the east\r\nend; it is about one hundred feet long, thirty-five feet wide, and fifty\r\nfeet in height. The exterior is built of stone, the body of the walls\r\nbeing Yorkshire parpoints, whilst the dressings are of Longridge stone.\r\nMr. T. A. Drummond, of Fleetwood, was the builder, and the design was\r\ndrawn by E. Welby Pugin, esq., architect, the total cost being about\r\n£4,000.\r\n\r\nFor many years, in fact ever since steamship communication had been\r\nestablished between this port and Belfast, large quantities of young\r\ncattle from Ireland were landed each season at Fleetwood, and carried\r\nforward by rail to the markets of Preston and elsewhere. For the benefit\r\nof the dealers, who would thus escape the railway charges, as well as\r\nfor the convenience of the graziers and other purchasers residing in the\r\nneighbourhood, it was determined to open a place for the public sale of\r\nsuch live stock at Fleetwood; the necessary authority was obtained from\r\nthe Privy Council, and on the 2nd of April, 1868, the Cattle Market,\r\nlying on the east side of that for general produce, and consisting of\r\nsixteen large strong pens, arranged in two rows with a road between them,\r\nwas used for its earliest transactions and much appreciated by those who\r\nwere concerned in the traffic.\r\n\r\nWednesday, the 2nd of June, 1869, will not readily be obliterated from\r\nthe memories of the people of Fleetwood. On that day the first sod of the\r\nlong expected dock was cut by H. S. Styan, esq., of London, the surviving\r\ntrustee of the estate under the will of the late Sir P. H. Fleetwood,\r\nwho died in 1866. The auspicious event was celebrated with universal\r\nrejoicing, in which many-coloured bunting played its usual conspicuous\r\npart. A large procession of the clergy, gentry, schools, and friendly\r\nsocieties, enlivened by the band of the 80th regiment of Infantry from\r\nthe Euston Barracks, and gay with waving banners, accompanied Mr. Styan\r\nto the site where the important ceremony was performed, and sent forth\r\nhearty congratulatory cheers when the piece of turf had been duly\r\ndissected from the ground. With all apparent earnestness and eagerness,\r\noperations were at once commenced, and for two or three months the\r\nundertaking, under the busy hands of the excavators, made satisfactory\r\nprogress, when suddenly several gangs of labourers were discharged, and\r\nthe works partially stopped—\r\n\r\n  “While all the town wondered.”\r\n\r\nWonderment, however, was turned to a feeling of disappointment and\r\nchagrin, when it was discovered, a little later, that the closing year\r\nwould put a period to the labours at the dock as well as to its own\r\nepoch of time, and that its last shadows would fall on deserted works\r\nand idle machinery. For some reason, which may fairly be conjectured\r\nto have been an incompleted list of shareholders, the Fleetwood Dock\r\nCompany determined to suspend all operations barely six months after\r\nthey had been begun, and it is scarcely necessary to inform our readers\r\nthat the work was never resumed under the same proprietorship. Two\r\nyears subsequently, in 1871, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\r\nCompany obtained an act of parliament to carry out, on a larger scale,\r\nthe undertaking which their predecessors had abandoned almost in its\r\nbirth. The dock, which embraces an area of nearly ten acres, being one\r\nthousand feet long, by four hundred feet wide, has already been in\r\ncourse of formation for more than two years, and although the labour is\r\nbeing pushed forward by the contractors, Messrs. John Aird and Sons, of\r\nLambeth, with as much expedition as is consistent with good workmanship,\r\nthe completion of this much-needed accommodation is not expected until\r\nsome time in 1877. The dock walls are built with square blocks of stone,\r\nsurmounted by a broad and massive coping of Cornish granite, and filled\r\nin behind with concrete, the whole having an altitude of thirty-one\r\nfeet, and being placed on a solid concrete foundation fourteen feet\r\nwide. The walls themselves vary in width as they approach the surface,\r\nbeing in the lower half of their distance 12½ feet, then 10½ feet, and\r\nin the highest section 8½ feet wide. The lock entrance communicates\r\nwith the north extremity of the dock, and is two hundred and fifty feet\r\nlong by fifty feet wide, being protected at each end by gates, opening,\r\nrespectively, into the dock and the channel now in process of excavation\r\nto the bed of the river Wyre. Lying to the south of the dock is the\r\nrecently-constructed timber pond, covering an area of 14½ or 15 acres,\r\nand having a depth of 15 feet. The pond is connected with the dock by\r\nmeans of a gateway, so arranged in the southern wall of the latter that\r\ntwo feet of water will always remain in the former after the tide has\r\nebbed below the level of its floor. The timber pond has no other entrance\r\nbeyond the one alluded to. Sir John Hawkshaw, previously mentioned in\r\nconnection with the visit of Queen Victoria to Fleetwood, is the eminent\r\nengineer from whose designs the dock is being constructed.\r\n\r\nThe prospect, or indeed certainty, of materially increased trade when the\r\ndock is thrown open has not been without effect upon the town generally,\r\nbut its stimulating influence is most remarkable in the large number of\r\nhouses which, during the last few years, have sprung into being. Streets\r\nhave been lined with habitations where recently not a dwelling existed,\r\nand others have had their vacant spaces filled in with buildings.\r\nHandsome shops have been erected in Dock Street, East and West Streets,\r\nand other localities, whilst many of the residences in Church Street\r\nhave been remodeled and converted into similar retail establishments.\r\nEverywhere there is a spirit of activity visible, contrasting most\r\npleasingly and favourably with the passive inertitia which pervaded the\r\nplace for a considerable period previous to the commencement of the dock\r\noperations. In 1875 the commissioners determined to do something towards\r\nprotecting the northern aspect of the Mount from the devastations of\r\nthe waves, whose boisterous familiarity had already inflicted serious\r\ninjury on its feeble sandy sides, and seemed disposed, if much longer\r\nunchecked, to reduce the venerable pile to a mere matter of history. A\r\npublic promenade, fenced with a substantial wall of concrete, was laid\r\nout at the base of the hill, extending from near the west extremity of\r\nthe Mount Terrace to the commencement of Abbot’s Walk. The damaged side\r\nof the mound itself has been levelled and sown with grass-seed, so that\r\nin course of time the marine walk will have a lofty sloping background of\r\ngreen sward, and form the prettiest, as it was doubtless the most needed,\r\nobject in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1875, a number of gentlemen, denominated the\r\nFleetwood Estate Company, Limited, and consisting of Sir Jno. Hawkshaw,\r\nknt., of Westminster; Thos. H. Carr, J. M. Jameson, C.E., and Philip\r\nTurner, esqrs., of Fleetwood; Capt. Henry Turner and Sturges Meek,\r\nesq., C.E., of Manchester; Thomas Barnes, esq., of Farnworth; James\r\nWhitehead, esq., of Preston; Joshua Radcliffe, esq., of Rochdale; Samuel\r\nBurgess, esq., of Altringham; William Barber Buddicom, esq., C.E., of\r\nPenbedw, Mold; and Samuel Fielden, esq., of Todmorden; purchased the\r\nlands, buildings, manorial rights and privileges (including wreckage,\r\nmarket-tolls, and advowson of the church), of the late Sir P. H.\r\nFleetwood, in and near this town, from the trustees of his property,\r\nfor £120,000, subscribed in equal shares. Although negotiations were\r\nsatisfactorily concluded in 1874, it was not until the month just stated\r\nthat the actual transfer was effected, and the gentlemen enumerated\r\nbecame lords of the soil. We must not omit to name that a portion of the\r\nFleetwood estate, amounting to about 600 acres, lying between the old and\r\npresent railway embankments, had been acquired in a similar manner, for\r\n£25,000, in 1871, by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company. Under\r\nthe new proprietorship leases for building purposes are sold or let, as\r\nformerly, for terms of 999 years.\r\n\r\nIn closing this account of Fleetwood as a watering-place and town, and\r\nbefore delineating its career as a seaport, it should be stated that the\r\ncensus of the inhabitants taken in 1871 yielded a total of 4,428 persons,\r\nof whom 2,310 were males, and 2,118 females; but in the limited period\r\nwhich has elapsed since that result was obtained the population has grown\r\nconsiderably, and the increase during a similar interval after any of the\r\nprevious official returns cannot be taken as a criterion of the present\r\nnumerical strength of the residents.\r\n\r\nFleetwood was started in 1839 as a distinct port with customs established\r\nby an order of the Treasury; subsequently in 1844 it was reduced to a\r\ncreek under Preston; then two years later elevated to a sub-port; and\r\nfinally in 1849 reinstated in its first position of independence. The\r\niron wharf was completed in 1841, and is constructed of iron piles,\r\neach of which weighs two and three quarter tons, driven seventeen feet\r\nbelow low water mark, and faced with plates of the same metal, seven or\r\neight inches thick, which are rivetted to the flanges of the piles, and\r\nfilled in at the back with concrete. The wooden pier, about 400 feet in\r\nlength, and abutting on the north extremity of this massive structure,\r\nwas finished in 1845, and roofed over shortly afterwards. On the 22nd of\r\nJuly in the ensuing year, the last stone of the wharf wall, erected by\r\nMr. Julian A. Tarner, of Fleetwood, and extending fourteen hundred feet\r\nfrom the south end of the iron wharf in the direction of the railway, was\r\nlaid; and at the same time the coal-shoots connected with the new portion\r\nof the quay were approaching completion.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the harbour was entrusted to Captain Denham, R.N.,\r\nF.R.S., under whose superintendence the seaward channel of the river was\r\nbuoyed and beaconed, being rendered safe for night navigation by the\r\nerection of a marine lighthouse, in 1840, at the foot of Wyre, nearly\r\ntwo miles from the mouth of the river at Fleetwood. This lighthouse was\r\nthe first one erected on Mitchell’s screw-pile principle. The house in\r\nwhich the lightkeepers lived was hexagonal in form, and measured 22\r\nfeet in diameter, from angle to angle, and nine feet in height. It was\r\nfurnished with an outside door and three windows; and divided within\r\ninto two compartments, one of which was supplied with a fireplace and\r\nother necessaries, whilst the second was used purely as a dormitory. The\r\nlantern was twelve-sided, 10 feet in diameter and 8 feet in height to the\r\ntop of the window, the illumination it produced being raised about 31\r\nfeet above the level of the highest spring-tide, and 44½ feet above that\r\nof half-tide. A few years since, in 1870, this lighthouse was carried\r\naway by a vessel, and for some time a light-ship occupied the station,\r\nbut subsequently another edifice, similar in appearance and construction\r\nto the original one, was raised about two hundred yards south of the same\r\nsite.\r\n\r\nCaptain Denham, having accomplished his survey of the river and harbour,\r\nissued the following report in 1840:—\r\n\r\n  “The river Wyre assumes a river character near Bleasdale Forest,\r\n  in Lancashire, and after crossing the line of road between\r\n  Preston and Lancaster, at Garstang, descends as a tortuous\r\n  stream for five miles westward; then, in another five mile\r\n  reach of one-third of a mile wide, north-westward, sweeping\r\n  the light of Skippool, near Poulton-le-Fylde, on its way, and\r\n  bursting forth from the narrows at Wardleys, upon a north trend,\r\n  into the tidal estuary which embraces an area of three miles\r\n  by two, producing a combined reflux of back-water, equal to\r\n  fifty million cubical yards, and dipping with such a powerful\r\n  _under-scour_ during the first half-ebb, as to preserve a natural\r\n  basin just within its coast-line orifice, capable of riding\r\n  ships of eighteen or twenty feet draft, at _low water spring\r\n  tides_; perfectly sheltered from all winds, and within a cable’s\r\n  length of the railway terminus, nineteen miles from Preston,\r\n  and in connection with Manchester, Lancaster, Liverpool, and\r\n  London. It is on the western margin of this natural dock that the\r\n  town, wharfs, and warehouses are rising into notice, under the\r\n  privilege of a distinct port, and abreast of which, the shores\r\n  aptly narrow the _back-water escape_ into a bottle-neck strait\r\n  of but one-sixth the width of the estuary, so impelling it down\r\n  a two-mile channel as scarcely to permit diminishment of its\r\n  three and four-mile velocity until actually blended with the\r\n  _cross-set_ of the Lune and Morecambe Bay ebb waters. Thus, the\r\n  original short course of Wyre to the open sea, is freed from the\r\n  usual river deposit, its silting matter being kept in suspension\r\n  until transferred and hurried forth at right angles by the ocean\r\n  stream. It is, therefore, the peculiar feature and fortune of\r\n  Wyre that, instead of a _bar_ intervening between its bed or exit\r\n  trough and the open sea, a precipitous river shelf, equal to a\r\n  fall of forty-seven feet in one-third of a mile, exists.”\r\n\r\nThe first steam dredger, of 20 horse power, was launched on the 21st\r\nof January, 1840, and the important work of deepening and clearing the\r\nchannel at once commenced.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Tidal Harbour Commissioners held at the port on the\r\n21st October, 1845, it was stated that the harbour dues were—for coasting\r\nvessels, 1d. per ton, and for foreign ships, 3d. per ton; whilst the\r\nlight charges were in all cases 3d. per ton. At the same time it was\r\nobserved that the whole of the dues amounted in 1835 to £36 2s. 0d., and\r\nin 1845 to £528 9s. 5d. (In 1855 the dues on similar accounts reached\r\n£1,520; and in 1875, £2,427.) The Walney light was reported to be a great\r\ntax on vessels coming to Fleetwood, as they were charged 3d. a ton per\r\nyear, commencing on the 1st of January; so that if a vessel arrived at\r\nthe port on the 28th of December, a charge was made for the year just\r\nclosing, and a further sum demanded from the craft on going out in the\r\nmonth of January. This was not the case with regard to similar taxes in\r\nother localities, where one payment exempted a ship for twelve months;\r\nand consequently the regulation acted in some degree as a deterrent to\r\ntraders, who might under a more liberal arrangement have been induced to\r\nhave availed themselves in larger numbers of the facilities offered by\r\nthe new haven. The total length of useful wharfage in 1845 extended over\r\n1,000 feet, being well supplied with posts and rings, and possessing no\r\nless than sixteen hand cranes, thirteen of which were for the purpose\r\nof unloading vessels at the quay. There was a depth of five feet at\r\nlow-water spring tides from the marine lighthouse, at the foot of Wyre,\r\nto the wharf, and it was proposed to dredge until ten feet had been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nOn examining the state of the shipping trade of the harbour during the\r\nyear 1845, it is discovered that the imports and exports of foreign\r\nproduce and home manufacture, respectively, far outstripped those of any\r\nof the few preceding years. There had been vessels laden with guano from\r\nIchaboe, sugar from the West Indies, flax from Russia, and timber from\r\nboth the Baltic and Canada, making in all twenty-three ships of large\r\ntonnage, only two of which returned with cargoes, in far from complete\r\nstages of fulness, from the warehouses of Manchester, Preston, or other\r\nadjacent commercial towns. The coasting trade had also given earnest of\r\nits progressive tendencies by a remarkable increase in the number of\r\ndischarges and loadings over those of the previous twelve months, and\r\nnotwithstanding the four hundred feet of extra wharfage, forming the\r\nwooden pier, just opened, the demands for quay berths could not always be\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nNew bonding warehouses were erected towards the close of 1845 at the\r\ncorner of Adelaide and Dock Streets, the temporary ones previously in\r\nuse being abandoned, and comprised three stories capable of providing\r\naccommodation for 400 hogsheads of sugar at one time, as well as spacious\r\nvaults and other conveniences for duty-bearing articles. The goods\r\nallowed to be warehoused were wine, spirits, tea, tobacco, East India\r\ngoods, and goods in general.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 prosperity continued to reward the efforts put forth by the\r\nauthorities of the young haven. Twelve vessels arrived from America with\r\ntimber, and nine similarly laden from the Baltic; tobacco, sugar, and\r\nother commodities were imported in two ships from the Indies; but the\r\nevent which kindled the brightest anticipations in the breasts of the\r\ninhabitants and others interested in the success of the port was the\r\narrival of the barque “Diogenes,” chartered by Mr. Evans, of Chipping,\r\nwith the first cargo of cotton ever landed at Fleetwood. In it was\r\nwelcomed an introduction to the chief trade of the county, and a happy\r\naugury of future activity in an import which would not only of itself\r\nmaterially assist the financial condition of the harbour, but would also\r\nbe the means of spreading its reputation throughout the commercial world,\r\nand extending its field of action to a degree which could scarcely be\r\nforetold. How these pleasant visions have been fulfilled the reader is\r\nperhaps aware, but if not a glance at the tables of coasting and foreign\r\ntrade, given a little later, will furnish the necessary information. On\r\nthe 12th of February, immediately the novel consignment just referred\r\nto, which “afforded a suitable opportunity,” had come to hand, a public\r\ndinner was given by their fellow-townsmen to Frederick Kemp and John\r\nLaidlay, esqrs., as a mark of respect for their assiduous efforts to\r\ndevelope the mercantile resources of the place. During the evening Mr.\r\nLaidlay remarked that “within a short period the trading intercourse\r\nof the port had extended to various and distant portions of the world,\r\nthe products of Africa, the West Indies, and North America having been\r\nimported; and stretching our arm still further, a cargo from the East\r\nIndies may be stated as almost within our grasp.” Mr. Evans, in alluding\r\nto his transatlantic shipment, affirmed that in bringing it by way of\r\nFleetwood, he had effected a saving of at least a farthing per pound; and\r\ncontinued,—“When the order was given, it could not have been imported\r\ninto Liverpool without loss.”\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the year a testimonial was presented by the\r\ninhabitants of the town to Henry Smith, esq., of Fleetwood, manager\r\nof the North Lancashire Steam Navigation Company, as a tribute to his\r\nuntiring and successful attempts to promote steamship traffic and advance\r\nthe interests of the place, and in the course of a speech made on the\r\noccasion, Mr. Smith said:—“In 1842 I first visited Fleetwood at the\r\nrequest of the London board of directors, it then presented a most gloomy\r\naspect—a splendid modern ruin, no shipping, no steamers, no passengers\r\nfor the trains, and yet it required no very keen discernment to learn\r\nthat all the facilities for trade and commerce existed here, but life was\r\nwanting; here was one of the finest and safest harbours, certainly the\r\nbest lighted and marked port on the west coast, being as easily made by\r\nnight as by day, with that wonderful natural phenomenon, the Lune Deep,\r\nmaking it a safety port to take in fog by sounding—a thing having no\r\nparallel in England.... What changes have we witnessed here since 1842?\r\nI have seen your population without employment, and now there is more\r\nwork than there are hands to perform—the wages from one shilling a day\r\nhave advanced to two shillings and sixpence and three shillings; then\r\nindeed was your port without a ship, now there is a general demand for\r\nmore quay room, although since then upwards of 1,000 feet have been added\r\nto the wharfage; then your railway receipts were £100, this year they\r\nhave attained £1,500 per week.” This unfortunate gentleman was killed in\r\nthe June following, through a collision on the London and North Western\r\nRailway; and there can be no hesitation in affirming that, had his career\r\nof usefulness and activity not been thus prematurely cut short, the trade\r\nof Fleetwood would have developed, in the long period which has elapsed\r\nsince his death, into something more important than it presents to day.\r\n\r\nThe following authentic returns of the whole business of the port in 1846\r\nforms a favourable comparison with those of 1840, the year in which the\r\nrailway was opened, when they amounted to 57,051 tons of imports, the\r\nexports being proportionately small:—\r\n\r\n  COASTING.\r\n\r\n                        IMPORTS.

The\r\nforeign imports suddenly fell off to six cargoes, four of which were\r\ntimber from America, the two remaining being guano and timber from\r\nHamburg. One left for Mexico and Hong Kong, laden with British goods,\r\nsilk, wine, and spirits from the bonding warehouses. The coasting returns\r\nalso showed a diminution of almost fifty discharges at the quay, as\r\ncompared with the previous year, and a corresponding decrease in the\r\nexports; but in spite of the sudden dispiriting experience, we find\r\nfrom the annexed extract out of the annual official report concerning\r\nthe harbour, that the future was regarded hopefully:—“There is every\r\nprobability of the business increasing at this Port, as an extensive\r\ntrade with the Baltic is expected, and most of the goods now in warehouse\r\nunder bond will no doubt be taken out for home consumption during the\r\npresent year.” 1848 was marked by an increase of nine in the number of\r\nforeign importations; and of the fifteen large vessels which arrived,\r\none was from France with wines and spirits for re-exportation to Mexico,\r\ntwo were from the Baltic and Hamburg with timber, eleven from Canada\r\nwith timber, and one from Russia with flax. The importers of timber\r\ncarried on, and used sedulous efforts to extend, a healthy retail trade\r\nin the adjoining districts and in the west of Yorkshire. The export\r\ntrade was still inconsiderable, although gradually increasing, but\r\nit was expected, from the convenient situation of the harbour to the\r\nmanufacturing towns, and the local dues upon vessels and goods being much\r\nlower than at other ports, that both it and the imports would, before\r\nmany years had passed over, become very extensive, more especially as\r\nthe Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company had recently acquired a\r\nright to the line between Fleetwood and Preston, and were offering every\r\nfacility and inducement to shippers and manufacturers, with the view of\r\nmaking this haven the inlet and outlet for goods to and from the towns\r\nand villages on their several lines. During the twelve months eighteen\r\nsmall importations of paper from the Isle of Man took place, and it was\r\nnecessary for the officers connected with the customs to keep a strict\r\nguard upon the wharf to prevent the smuggling of that and other dutiable\r\narticles by the numerous passenger and coasting vessels from the above\r\nisland, as well as from Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the foreign imports were more than doubled, the excess being\r\nchiefly due to the increase of timber-laden vessels. Six of the total\r\nnumber sailed outwards with cargoes of warehoused goods, and nine with\r\ncoal and salt. The coasting trade underwent a most remarkable rise\r\nof about four hundred cargoes inwards, and two hundred outwards, the\r\nprincipal of the former being iron ore, pig iron, and, more occasionally,\r\ngrain; and of the latter, coal. The barque “Isabella” discharged 609\r\nbales of cotton at Fleetwood from America in July, 1850, being the\r\nsecond cargo landed here, and later in the year another consignment of\r\n400 bales was brought by the same vessel. In 1851 the only novel feature\r\nwas the arrival of a large shipload of currants; the value of British\r\ngoods exported amounted to £90,000, besides which there were considerable\r\nquantities of merchandise sent outwards from bond. The main foreign\r\nbusiness in 1852 was in timber and dried fruits, but such importations\r\nwere seriously diminished during the ensuing year by the high price\r\nof the latter and by a temporary misunderstanding between the railway\r\ncompany and one of the chief timber merchants, through which several\r\nconsignments intended for the Wyre were diverted elsewhere; in addition\r\nfive large cargoes were lost at sea and not replaced. The coasting trade\r\ncontinued to expand until 1856, when its zenith was reached, since when\r\nit has been characterised by a gradual decline, and the last report,\r\nthat of 1875, is as little encouraging as any, with one exception, of\r\nits degenerate predecessors. The fourth freight of cotton, consisting of\r\n1,327 bales, made its appearance in the ship “Cleopatra,” in the spring\r\nof 1857, and was consigned to Messrs. Benjamin Whitworth and Brothers, of\r\nManchester, etc. Shortly afterwards, barely two weeks, the “Favourite”\r\narrived with a further consignment for the same firm, and gave the signal\r\nfor the real commencement of a prosperous trade in that commodity with\r\nAmerica, which rapidly developed until the outbreak of civil war in the\r\ntransatlantic continent brought it somewhat abruptly to a close in 1862.\r\nIn a comparative statement of charges between Liverpool and Fleetwood,\r\nissued during that flourishing time, it was demonstrated that on a vessel\r\nof 500 tons, cotton in and coals out, the following saving in favour of\r\nthis port could be effected:—\r\n\r\n                                 £  s. d.\r\n  Charges on Ship               66  0  0\r\n     ”    on Cargo inwards      96  8  4\r\n     ”    on Cargo outwards      8  6  8\r\n                               ---------\r\n              Total saving    £170 15  0\r\n\r\nSupposing the cargo to have been consigned to parties in Preston, a\r\nfurther advantage, amounted to £230 0s. 0d. in carriage would be gained,\r\nraising the entire saving to £400 15s. 0d.\r\n\r\nDuring late years, the business firm just alluded to, whose interests in,\r\nand efforts for, the welfare of the port have so long been unflagging,\r\nhas made a vigorous attempt to revive the American cotton importations.\r\nFor the last few seasons several of their shipments, about ten, have\r\nannually arrived, and there is every prospect that when the dock is\r\ncompleted many more vessels will be chartered. A large shed for the\r\nreception of cotton was erected in 1875, in Adelaide Street, by Messrs.\r\nB. Whitworth and Bros., who have also established a permanent office in\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the trade between Fleetwood and Belfast had developed to such\r\nan extent that a larger covered area for the temporary warehousing,\r\nloading, and discharging of goods was urgently called for, and towards\r\nthe close of that year a space of about 190 feet in length, by 30 feet\r\nwide, was walled in and roofed over on the quay, adjoining the building\r\nthen in use for the same purposes. Four years later, in 1863, two\r\nsteam cranes were placed on the wharf by the North Lancashire Steam\r\nNavigation Company. Subsequently other cranes, working on a similar\r\nprinciple, have been added to those experimental ones, and gradually the\r\nold system of hand-labour at the quay-side has been superseded by the\r\nadoption of this more expeditious and economical plan. Shortly before\r\nthe last-named facilities had augmented the conveniences of the wharf,\r\na fresh description of mooring appliance was laid down in the harbour,\r\nand consisted of two longitudinal ground chains of 1,000 feet each,\r\nattached at intervals of 50 feet to two sets of Mitchell’s screws, which\r\nwere worked into the clay in the bed of the stream. The bridle chains,\r\nshackled above to the mooring buoys, were secured below to the ground\r\nlinks between the attachments of the screws, the buoys being so arranged\r\nthat each vessel was held stem and stern, instead of swinging round with\r\nthe tide, or stranding with one end on the large central sandbank, as\r\nheretofore.\r\n\r\nFrom 1862 to the present date, the story of the haven, with the\r\nexceptions of the trawling fleet and the Belfast line, which will be\r\ntreated of directly, is not one which will awaken envy in the breasts\r\nof those whose interests are bound up in rival ports, nor indeed can it\r\nbe a source of congratulation to those whose interests might ordinarily\r\nbe supposed to be best promoted by its prosperity. It is true that the\r\nforeign trade for seven years after 1862 was in a state of fluctuation\r\nrather than actual decline, but the three succeeding years were\r\nstationary at the low figure of 21 imports each, after which there was\r\na slight improvement, raising the annual numbers to 24, 32, and, in\r\n1875, 33, due more to the staunch allegiance of Messrs. B. Whitworth and\r\nBros., whose cotton again appeared on the wharf, than to any inducements\r\noffered to them or others by increased facilities or more appropriate\r\naccommodation. The coasting trade has already been referred to, so that\r\nthere is no necessity to recapitulate facts but just laid before our\r\nreaders. It is proper, however, to mention a few statistics respecting\r\nthe trade in exports of coal, the chief business, and below are given\r\nthe numbers of tons shipped, mostly to Ireland, in each of the specified\r\nyears:—\r\n\r\n  1855    31,490\r\n  1860    23,652\r\n  1865    16,225\r\n  1866    12,315\r\n  1867    10,912\r\n  1868     6,809\r\n  1869    24,741\r\n  1870    43,653\r\n  1871    51,473\r\n  1872    54,794\r\n  1873    55,447\r\n  1874    56,939\r\n  1875    71,353\r\n\r\nThe large and sudden increase from 1869 is mainly owing to several screw\r\nsteamships having been extensively engaged in the traffic, and there is\r\nevery probability, from the addition within the last few months of a new\r\nand handsome coal-screw, and other indications, that this branch of\r\ncommerce will continue to develope with equal, if not greater, rapidity.\r\nAgain, it should be remembered, when considering the falling off in the\r\nnumerical strength of the coasting vessels trading here, that those\r\nnow plying are of much greater carrying capacity than formerly, and\r\nconsequently the actual exports and imports have not suffered diminution\r\nin anything like the same proportion as the ships themselves. A series\r\nof tabular statements of all the most important and interesting matters\r\nconnected with the harbour from the earliest obtainable dates has been\r\nprepared from the official returns made to the custom-house during\r\neach twelve months, and subjoined will be found a list of the vessels\r\nretained on the register as belonging to the port at the end of the years\r\nindicated, with their tonnages and the number of hands forming the crews:—\r\n\r\n          Steam                      Sailing\r\n  Year.

Already, in 1875, a powerful\r\nsteam dredger has been purchased at a cost of £12,000 and set to its\r\nlabours in the channel and harbour. This dredger, which has superseded\r\nthe older and much smaller one, launched in 1840 and used until\r\nrecently, was built by Simonds and Company, of Renfrew, on the Clyde,\r\nand is of 100-horse power, being capable of raising 250 tons of sand,\r\nshingle, etc., in an hour. In addition it is able to work in twenty-six\r\nfeet of water, whereas the original one was obliged to wait until the\r\ntide had ebbed to fourteen feet before operations could be commenced, so\r\nthat really the work which can be accomplished by the new machine is out\r\nof all proportion to that which its predecessor could effect. Several\r\niron pontoons, or lighters, furnished with false bottoms to expedite\r\nthe business of discharging them, formerly performed by hand and spade,\r\nhave also been obtained; and the bed of the river seaward from Fleetwood\r\nis rapidly being relieved of its superabundance of tidal deposits and\r\nscourings, which is carried by the lighters beyond the marine lighthouse\r\nat the foot of the Wyre and deposited in the Lune.\r\n\r\nSteamboat traffic was, and is, the most important branch of shipping\r\nconnected with the port, but notwithstanding the support and\r\nencouragement which has been so freely extended to the Belfast line,\r\nsundry attempts by the same company to establish sea-communications\r\nbetween Fleetwood and other places have invariably ended in complete\r\nfailures. In the context we have endeavoured to trace a brief outline\r\nof the steamship trade of the harbour from its earliest days up to our\r\ntime. The North Lancashire Steam Navigation Company was established in\r\n1843, and commenced operations by running the “Prince of Wales” and the\r\n“Princess Alice,” two large and fast iron steamships for that date,\r\nbetween this port and Belfast on each Wednesday and Saturday evening, the\r\nreturn trips being made on the Monday and Friday. In that year, however,\r\nthe number of trips was increased to three per week, the fares for the\r\nsingle journey being, saloon, 15s.; and deck, 3s. Another steamship the\r\n“Robert Napier,” of 220 horse-power, sailed also from Fleetwood in 1843,\r\nevery Friday morning, at 10 a.m. for Londonderry, calling at Portrush,\r\nand returned on Tuesday, the fares being, cabin, 20s.; and deck, 5s. In\r\n1844 we find that communications, through the exertion and enterprise of\r\nthe above company, were open between Fleetwood and Belfast, Londonderry,\r\nArdrossan, and Dublin, respectively. The Ardrossan line consisted of two\r\nnew iron steamboats, “Her Majesty,” and the “Royal Consort,” each of\r\nwhich was 300 tons register, and 350 horse-power, the fares being, cabin,\r\n17s.; and deck, 4s. The Dublin trip was performed once, and afterwards\r\ntwice, a week each way, by the iron steamship “Hibernia,” which called\r\noff Douglas, Isle of Man, to land passengers, but after a year’s trial\r\nthis communication was closed. In the summer of 1845, an Isle of Man line\r\nwas opened by the steamship “Orion,” which ran daily, except Sundays;\r\nand at the same season the Belfast boats commenced to make the double\r\njourney four days a week, whilst the Londonderry route was abandoned.\r\nAs early as 1840, on the completion of the Preston and Wyre Railway, a\r\ndaily steam communication had been established to Bardsea, as the nearest\r\npoint to Ulverston and the Lakes; and in the month of September, 1846,\r\non the completion of Piel Pier, it was transferred to that harbour, and\r\ncontinued by the steamship “Ayrshire Lassie,” of 100 horse-power, the\r\nfares being, saloon, 2s.; and deck, 1s. In the following year this boat\r\nwas superseded by a new steamer, the “Helvellyn,” of 50 tons register and\r\n75 horse-power, which continued to ply for many years, in fact, almost\r\nuntil this summer line was closed, at a comparatively recent date, about\r\neight or ten years ago. The Fleetwood and Ardrossan steamers discontinued\r\nrunning in 1847, and at the same time an extra boat, the “Fenella,” was\r\nplaced on the Isle of Man route, whilst the Belfast trips were reduced\r\nto three double journeys per week. After a few years experience the Isle\r\nof Man line, a season one only, was given up; but the Belfast trade,\r\ncontinually growing, soon obliged the company to increase the number of\r\ntrips, and step by step to enlarge and improve the boat accommodation. We\r\nneed not trace through its different stages the gradual and satisfactory\r\nprogress of this line, but our object will be sufficiently attained\r\nby stating that the two steamships were shortly increased to three.\r\nAfterwards larger and finer boats, having greater power, took the places\r\nof the original ones, and at the present day the fleet consists of four\r\nfine steamers of fully double the capacity of the original ones, which\r\ncross the channel from each port every evening except Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1874 the whole of the interests of Frederick Kemp, esq.,\r\nJ.P., of Bispham Lodge, in the Fleetwood and Belfast steam line were\r\nacquired by the Lancashire and Yorkshire and London and North Western\r\nRailway Companies, at that time owners of the larger share, and now\r\npractically sole proprietors. Up to the date of this transaction the\r\nvendor had been intimately and personally associated with the traffic as\r\nmanaging-owner from its first institution, in addition to which he was\r\nthe chief promoter of the Ardrossan and Isle of Man routes.\r\n\r\nWith the solitary exception of the service whose progress has just been\r\nbriefly traced out, there is perhaps no single branch of industry which\r\nhas assisted so ably in maintaining and stimulating such prosperity as\r\nthe town of Fleetwood has enjoyed, throughout its chequered career,\r\nas the fishing traffic. In the earliest years of the seaport, shortly\r\nbefore the Belfast steamer communication was established, a second pilot\r\nboat, named the “Pursuit,” arrived in the river from Cowes, but finding\r\nlittle occupation the crew provided themselves with a trawl-net and\r\nturned their long periods of vigil to profitable account by its use.\r\nThis sensible plan of launching out into another field of labour when\r\nopportunities of prosecuting their more legitimate avocation failed them\r\nwas not of long duration, probably no more than a few months, for on the\r\nIrish line of steamships commencing to ply the pilots secured berths as\r\nsecond officers, and their boat was laid up. The “Pursuit” soon became\r\na tender to a government ship engaged in surveying; and about ten or\r\ntwelve months later was purchased by some gentlemen, denominated the\r\nFleetwood Fishing Company, and, together with four more boats, hired\r\nfrom North Meols, Southport, sent out on fishing excursions. At the end\r\nof one year the hired sloops were discharged, and five similar craft\r\nbought by the company, thus making a fleet of six smacks belonging to\r\nthe place, connected with the trawling trade. In the course of three\r\nor four years the whole of the boats were sold, as the traffic had not\r\nproved so remunerative a venture as at first anticipated; and one only\r\nremained in the harbour, being purchased by Mr. Robert Roskell, of this\r\nplace. Shortly afterwards a Scotch smack arrived from Kirkcudbright,\r\nand in about twelve months the two boats were joined by three or four\r\nfrom North Meols, owned for the most part by a family named Leadbetter,\r\nwhich settled here. Almost simultaneously another batch of fishing\r\ncraft made its appearance from the east coast and took up a permanent\r\nstation at Fleetwood. The success which attended the expeditions of the\r\ndeep-sea trawlers was not long in being rumoured abroad and attracting\r\nothers, who were anxious to participate in an undertaking capable of\r\nproducing such satisfactory results. Year by year the dimensions of the\r\noriginally small fleet were developed as new-comers appeared upon the\r\nscene, and added their boats to those already actively prosecuting the\r\ntrade. To trace minutely each gradation in the prosperous progress of\r\nthis line of commerce would be wearisome to the reader, and is in no\r\nway necessary to the object we have in view. It will be sufficient for\r\nthe purpose to state that in 1860 the number of fishing smacks on the\r\nFleetwood station amounted to thirty-two, varying in tonnage from 25 to\r\n50 tons each and built at an average cost of £500 each, the lowest being\r\n£400 and the highest £1,000. The following will illustrate the plan by\r\nwhich men in the humble sphere of fishermen were enabled to become the\r\nproprietors of their own craft: A shipmaster supplied the vessel on the\r\nunderstanding that £100 was deposited at once, and the remainder paid\r\nby quarterly instalments, no insurance being asked for or proffered\r\nregarding risk. The arrangement entered into by the smack-owners for\r\nthe conveyance of fish to shore, when they were engaged out at sea in\r\ntheir calling was most simple and business-like. The boats kept company\r\nduring fishing, and on a certain signal being given one of the number,\r\naccording to a previous agreement, received the whole of the fish so far\r\ncaught by her fellow craft and returned home, for which service her men\r\nwere paid 2s. each by the other crews, who continued their occupation\r\nand arrived in harbour generally on Friday. For the next week another\r\nsmack was selected, and thus all in turn performed the mid-week journey.\r\nAt present there are no less than eighty-four sloops belonging to this\r\nport, pursuing the business of fishing, and the arrangements both for\r\ntheir purchase and the landing of the captured fish have undergone a\r\nrevolution. All boats are now paid for when they leave the shipbuilder’s\r\nyard, and the former custom of a mid-week relief, has been relinquished,\r\neach sloop returning and discharging as occasion requires. A fishing\r\nboat’s crew usually consists of four men and a boy. In conclusion it\r\nshould be noticed that a special warehouse, about 90 feet long, was\r\nerected in 1859, solely for the use of the fishermen and agents, or\r\ndealers, connected with the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHORNTON, CARLETON, MARTON, AND HARDON-WITH-NEWTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTorentum, or Thornton, was estimated in the time of William the Conqueror\r\nto contain six carucates of land fit for the plough, but this computation\r\nwas exclusive of Rossall and Burn, which were valued at two carucates\r\nrespectively, so that the whole townships held ten carucates, about one\r\nthousand acres of arable soil, or farming land, a large amount for those\r\ndays, but insignificant indeed when we recall the nine thousand seven\r\nhundred and thirty acres embraced by the township at present, either in\r\nuse for grazing and agricultural purposes, or forming the sites of town\r\nand village buildings.\r\n\r\nThornton was held immediately after the Conquest by Roger de Poictou, and\r\nsubsequently by Theobald Walter, after whose death it passed to the crown.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King John, Margaret Wynewick held two of the six\r\ncarucates of Torentum, or Thornton, in chief from that monarch, and her\r\nmarriage was in his gift. In 1214-15 Baldewinus Blundus paid twenty\r\nmarks to John for permission to espouse the lady and gain possession\r\nof her estate.[87] The request was granted conditionally on Blundus\r\nobtaining the consent of her friends; and in this he appears to have\r\nbeen successful, for we learn from a writ to the warden of the Honor of\r\nLancaster in 1221, that Michael de Carleton paid a fine of ten marks\r\nto Henry III. at that date for having married Margaret, the daughter\r\nand heiress of William de Winewick, without the royal assent, and for\r\nmarrying whom Baldewinus Blundus had formerly paid twenty marks to King\r\nJohn.[88]\r\n\r\nIn 1258, Margaret de Carleton still retained her lands in Thornton in her\r\nmaiden name of Winewick,[89] and it is probable from that circumstance\r\nthat her second husband was then dead, for the writ cited above expressly\r\ncommanded that her inheritance should be handed over to Michael de\r\nCarleton, the penalty of ten marks for his disobedience having been\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Testa de Nevil_, Matilda de Thorneton, a spinster,\r\nwhose marriage also lay in the king’s gift, held lands in Thornton, of\r\nthe annual value of twenty shillings; and later, about 1323, a moiety of\r\nThornton was held by Lawrence, the son of Robert de Thorneton, a member\r\nof the same family. In 1346, John, son of Lawrence de Thorneton, held one\r\ncarucate of land in Thornton and Staynolfe, lately of Robert Windewike,\r\nin thanage, paying yearly at four terms thirteen shillings relief, and\r\nsuit to the county and wapentake.[90] In 1421 John de Thornton died,\r\npossessed of half the manor of Thornton and the Holmes, which descended\r\nto his son, William de Thornton, who died in 1429, aged thirty years,\r\nleaving four daughters—Agnes, afterwards the wife of William Wodey;\r\nKatherine, who married William Carleton; Elizabeth, the wife of Robert\r\nAdlington; and Johanna, who espoused Christopher Worthington.[91] Much as\r\nit is to be regretted, no more than the scanty information here given can\r\nbe discovered concerning the Thorntons, of Thornton; even tradition is\r\nsilent on the matter of their residence or local associations, although\r\nit is very likely they occupied Thornton Hall, a mansion long since\r\nconverted into a farm house, and consequently we are obliged to dismiss\r\nwith this brief notice what under more favourable auspices would probably\r\nhave proved one of the most interesting subjects in the township. In 1292\r\nthe king’s attorney sued Thomas de Singleton for the manor of Thornton,\r\netc., but the defendant pleaded successfully, that he only held a portion\r\nof the manor, Thomas de Clifton and Katherine, his wife, holding the\r\nthird of two parts of twelve bovates of the soil.[92] In the seventeenth\r\nyear of the reign of Edward II., William, father of Adam Banastre, who\r\ngranted certain concessions to the prior of Lancaster, held, half the\r\nvill of Thornton, the other half being held, as before shown, by Lawrence\r\nde Thorneton.\r\n\r\nIn an ancient survey of the Hundred of Amounderness, completed in the\r\nyear 1346, it is stated that the following gentlemen had possessions\r\nin the place called Stena, or Stainall, in Thornton, at the rentals\r\nspecified:—John de Staynolfe held four oxgangs of land, at four shillings\r\nand sixpence;[93] Roger de Northcrope, one messuage and one oxgang, at\r\nsevenpence halfpenny; Sir Adam Banastre, knt., five acres, at fourpence;\r\nThomas, the son of Robert Staynolfe, one messuage and one oxgang, at\r\nsevenpence halfpenny; William Lawrence, a fourth part of an oxgang, at\r\nsixteen pence; Thomas Travers, a fourth part of an oxgang, at sixteen\r\npence; John Botiler, a fourth part of an oxgang, at sixteen pence; and\r\nRichard Doggeson, five acres, at sixpence. William de Heton held one\r\ncarucate of land at Burn, in Thornton township, for which he paid yearly\r\nat two terms, Annunciation and Michaelmas, ten shillings relief, and suit\r\nto the county and wapentake.[94]\r\n\r\nIn 1521, during the sovereignty of Henry VIII., Thomas, earl of Derby,\r\nwas lord of the manor of Thornton, which subsequently passed into the\r\nhands of the Fleetwoods, of Rossall, who retained it until the lifetime\r\nof the late Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood, bart., when it was sold.\r\nThornton has for long been regarded only as a reputed manor. The largest\r\nland proprietors at present are the Fleetwood Estate Company, Limited,\r\nand the trustees of the late John Horrocks, esq., of Preston, but in\r\naddition there is a number of smaller soil-owners and resident yeomen.\r\nBurn Hall is a building of the fifteenth century, and was occupied in\r\n1556 by John Westby, of Mowbreck, the owner.[95] In 1323 the land of Burn\r\nwas held by William Banastre at a rental of ten shillings per annum, and\r\nabout 1346 one carucate of the same land was held, as already stated, by\r\nWilliam de Heton for a similar yearly payment. Within the residence of\r\nBurn was a domestic chapel, over the doorway of which stood a polished\r\noaken slab or board inscribed—“Elegi abjectus esse in domo Dei mei, magis\r\nquam habitari in tabernaculis peccatorum.”[96] The walls were panelled\r\nwith oak and carved with shields and foliage, whilst the ceiling was\r\nembellished with representations of vine leaves and clusters of grapes.\r\nModern alterations have destroyed most, if not all, interesting relics\r\nof past ages. After the death of John Westby, of Burn Hall, a descendant\r\nof the John Westby before mentioned, in 1722, Burn passed to the Rev. J.\r\nBennison, of London, who had married Anne, his fourth daughter. It is\r\nsaid that Mr. Bennison utterly ruined his property, by attempting a style\r\nof agriculture similar to that described by Virgil in his Georgics. Burn\r\nHall is now, and has been for many years a farm-house, and the estate\r\nforms part of the large tract held by the representatives of the late\r\nJohn Horrocks, esq. The land lying towards the coast was formerly subject\r\nto occasional inundations of the sea, but an effectual barrier has been\r\nput by raising a mound round such exposed localities.\r\n\r\nThe extensive area known as Thornton Marsh, was a free open common, used\r\nas a pasture by the poor cottagers of the township until 1800, when it\r\nwas enclosed, together with Carleton Marsh, and has since by cultivation\r\nbeen converted into valuable and productive fields.\r\n\r\nA church and parsonage house were erected at Thornton in 1835, the\r\nformer being a neat whitewashed building in the early English style of\r\narchitecture, with a low square tower, but presenting externally no\r\nspecial features of attraction beyond its profuse covering of ivy, which\r\nrenders it a most picturesque object in the surrounding landscape. The\r\nchurchyard also is well worthy of notice, if only for the luxuriance\r\nof its foliage, the beauty of its flowers, and the taste and elegance\r\nexhibited in several of the monuments. This, like the church and\r\nparsonage, is embosomed in trees. The sacred edifice has been named\r\nChrist Church, and a separate parochial district was assigned to it in\r\n1862, the title of vicar being accorded to the incumbent.\r\n\r\n  CURATES AND VICARS OF THORNTON.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------\r\n    Date of   |          NAME.          |      Cause of vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                         |\r\n  ------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------\r\n      1835    |David H.

A marble tablet “To the\r\nmemory of Jacob Morris, a faithful warden for 20 years, who died Oct.,\r\n1871,” is fixed against the south wall, and over the mantel-piece in the\r\nvestry is a white-lettered black board stating that—“This Church was\r\nerected in the year 1835, containing 323 sittings; and, in consequence\r\nof a grant from the Incorporated Society for promoting the enlargement,\r\nbuilding, and repairing of churches and chapels, 193 of that number are\r\nhereby declared to be free and unappropriated for ever.—David Hilcock\r\nLeighton, minister; James Smith and Richard Wright, churchwardens.” On\r\nthe font is the following inscription:—“Presented to Thornton Church by\r\nElizabeth Nutter, of Rough Hall, Accrington, July 13th, 1874.”\r\n\r\nMr. James Baines, of Poulton, by will dated 6th of January, 1717, devised\r\nto Peter Woodhouse, of Thornton, and six others, and their heirs, the\r\nschool-house lately erected by him on Thornton Marsh, and the land\r\nwhereon it stood, to be used for ever as a free school for the children\r\nof the township; in addition he bequeathed to the same trustees several\r\ncloses in Carleton, called the Far Hall Field, the Middle Hall Field,\r\nand the Vicar’s Hey, amounting to about twenty-one acres, to the intent,\r\nthat the annual revenue therefrom, less 10s. to be expended each year\r\nin a dinner for the trustees, should be devoted to the payment of a\r\nsuitable master. In 1806, Richard Gaskell, the sole surviving trustee,\r\nconveyed by indenture to John Silcock, John Hull, Thomas Barton, of\r\nThornton, Charles Woodhouse of Great Carleton, Bickerstaff Hull, and\r\nThomas Hull, and the said Richard Gaskell, their heirs and assigns, the\r\npremises above-mentioned, for the purposes set forth in the will of the\r\nfounder.[97] A further endowment of £500 was left by Mr. Simpson, with a\r\nportion of which farm buildings have been erected on the school estate.\r\nThe school-house is situated on the east side of Cleveleys Station,\r\nand consists of a small single-storey building, having two windows and\r\na central doorway in front. To the west end is attached a two-storey\r\nteacher’s residence. The double erection was built some years ago, by\r\nsubscription amongst the inhabitants, on the site of the original fabric\r\nat a cost of rather more than £100. The master is elected and, when\r\nnecessary, dismissed by the trustees, who forego their claim on the\r\n10s. left for an annual dinner. In 1867 the number of scholars amounted\r\nto eighty-eight, fifty-nine of whom were boys, and twenty-nine girls,\r\npresenting about an average attendance since that date.\r\n\r\nThe small village of Thornton comprises only a limited cluster of\r\ndwellings and the old windmill. The Wesleyan Methodists had established\r\na place of worship in the township as early as 1812, and about ten years\r\nlater the Society of Friends opened a meeting-house here.\r\n\r\nThe arable land of Rossall, in Thornton township, or Rushale, as it was\r\nwritten, is estimated in the Domesday volume at two carucates. At that\r\ntime Rossall was included amongst the princely possessions of the Norman\r\nbaron, Roger de Poictou, after whose banishment it passed, by gift of\r\nRichard I., to Theobold Walter, and again reverted to the crown in 1206,\r\non his demise. King John, at the instigation of Ranulph de Blundeville,\r\nearl of Chester and Lincoln, presented the grange of Rossall to the\r\nStaffordshire convent of Deulacres, a monastic house founded by that\r\nnobleman; and in 1220-1 Henry III. issued a writ to the sheriff of this\r\ncounty, directing him to institute inquiries by discreet and lawful men,\r\ninto the extent of several specified places, one of which was the pasture\r\nof Rossall, recently, “granted by my father, King John, to the abbot of\r\nDeulacres.”[98] In 1227-8 a deed was drawn up between Henry III. and the\r\nabbot whereby the grange was conveyed, or confirmed, to the latter[99];\r\nand twenty years subsequently a fresh charter appears to have been framed\r\nand to have received the royal signature, for in the following reign of\r\nEdward I., when that monarch laid claim to the land as a descendant of\r\nKing John, the head of the Staffordshire convent produced a document of\r\n31 Henry III. (1247), at the trial, granting “to God, the church of St.\r\nMary, and the abbot of Deulacres and his successors for ever, the manor\r\nof Rossall with its appurtenances and with the wreck of the sea.”[100]\r\nSir Robert de Lathum, Sir Robert de Holaund, Sir John de Burun, Sir\r\nRoger de Burton, Sir John de Cornwall, Sir John de Elyas, and Sir Alan\r\nde Penyngton, knights; Alan de Storeys, Robert de Eccleston, William du\r\nLee, Hugh de Clyderhou, and Roger de Middleton, esquires, who composed\r\nthe jury in the above suit, decided in favour of the abbot’s title, but\r\nat the request of the king’s attorney, judgment was arrested, and it was\r\npleaded on behalf of the regal claimant that the abbot’s allegations\r\nseemed to imply that the manor of Rossall was formerly held by the monks\r\nof Deulacres in bailiwick of Kings, John and Henry; that thirty years\r\nat least of the reign of Henry had elapsed before the predecessors of\r\nthe present abbot held any fee or free tenement in the manor, which was\r\nworth 100 marks per annum; and that this rent had been in arrears during\r\nthe whole of the time; wherefore the king’s attorney demanded that the\r\naccumulation of these arrears, amounting to 3,000 marks, or £2,000,\r\nshould be paid by the abbey to Edward I. The jury stated in their verdict\r\nthat the manor had been held by the abbot’s predecessors as pleaded by\r\nthe king’s attorney, but that during the last seven years of King John,\r\nand the first twenty-four years of Henry III., the manor was only worth\r\n30 marks per annum, and in the remaining six years before the date of the\r\ncharter put in as evidence by the abbot in the first trial, they valued\r\nthe manor at 40 marks per annum, on which scales the abbey of Deulacres\r\nwas condemned to pay the accumulated arrearages. In 1539, during the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., the grange was valued in the Compotus of the king’s\r\nministers at £13 6s. 3d. per annum.\r\n\r\nThe site of the original Hall has long since been washed away by the\r\nwaves, but in earlier years, before the sea had made such encroachments\r\non the land, the foundations of red sandstone and the remnant of an\r\nold ivied wall were visible near the edge of the cliff, all being\r\nsufficiently traceable to indicate that the mansion had been one of no\r\nmean dimensions. A coat of arms of the Fleetwood family, rudely engraven\r\non a flat stone, some ornamental pinnacles, and other relics of the\r\nancient edifice, have also been discovered at different times. Numerous\r\nfoundations of large buildings were once scattered about the sandy soil\r\nof the grange, but most of them were removed eighty years since as\r\nimpediments to the course of the plough. In a plot of ground, known by\r\nthe title of “Churchyard field,” remains of a structure, running east\r\nand west, in length thirty and in breadth twelve yards, were taken up\r\nabout half a century or more ago by a farmer named John Ball, who whilst\r\nremoving them came upon some human bones. The fabric once standing there\r\nwas conjectured to have been a chapel or oratory, and the bones to have\r\nbeen those of priests or others buried within its precincts. Harrison,\r\nin describing the course of the Wyre, says “that at the Chapell of\r\nAllhallowes tenne myles from Garstone it goeth into the sea,” and Mr.\r\nThornber suggests, in his History of Blackpool and Neighbourhood, that\r\nthe foundations disturbed by Mr. Ball may have been the remains of the\r\noratory alluded to by the ancient topographer; but whilst admitting that\r\nthe character of the relics discovered points to there having been at one\r\ntime a religious edifice on the site, we cannot think that its claims to\r\nbe the missing chapel are nearly so great as those of Bispham, which is\r\nnow known, by an inscription on an old communion goblet, to have been\r\nactually dedicated to All-Hallows, or at least to have been commonly\r\ndesignated by that name in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Allens appear to have held Rossall on lease from the abbot of\r\nDeulacres about a century after the dispute between that monastery and\r\nEdward I. had been decided, for in 1397, during the reign of Richard\r\nII., the name of “Allen of Ross-hall” was entered in the list of donors\r\nto the fraternities of the Preston Guild of that year. George Allen,\r\nof Brookhouse, Staffordshire, who held Rossall at the date of the\r\nReformation, by virtue of a long lease granted to his ancestors by an\r\nabbot of Deulacres, is the earliest of this family to whom these tenants\r\nof the grange can be traced genealogically. The widow and daughters of\r\nthe grandson of George Allen were ejected from Rossall in 1583, before\r\nthe expiration of their lease, and despoiled of valuable documents and\r\nproperty by Edmund Fleetwood, whose father had purchased the reversion\r\nfrom Henry VIII., at the time of the dissolution of monasteries. On that\r\noccasion a neighbour, Anion, seized and appropriated £500 belonging to\r\nthe Allens on pretence of remitting it to Dr. William Allen, at Rheims.\r\nMrs. Allen made an attempt to recover possession of the grange, and a\r\ntrial for that purpose took place at Manchester, but her case broke\r\ndown through inability to produce the original deeds and papers, all of\r\nwhich had been either stolen or destroyed when the Hall was plundered\r\nduring the ejection.[101] The estate, or grange, of Rossall, remained in\r\nthe hands of the Fleetwoods until the death of Edward Fleetwood, when\r\nit passed to Roger Hesketh, of North Meols, who married Margaret, the\r\nonly child and heiress of that gentleman in 1733.[102] The Heskeths,\r\nof Rossall, were descended from the Heskeths of Rufford, through Hugh\r\nHesketh, an offspring of Sir Thomas Hesketh, of Rufford. Hugh Hesketh\r\nmarried the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Barneby Kytichene, or\r\nKitchen, and thus acquired a moiety of the manor of North Meols. At the\r\ndecease of Hugh Hesketh, in 1625, the lands of North Meols descended to\r\nhis son, Thomas Hesketh, then 56 years of age, whose son and heir, Robert\r\nHesketh, was already married to the daughter of—Formby, of Formby. The\r\nonly child of Robert Hesketh was the Roger Hesketh, mentioned above,\r\nwho also held Tulketh Hall and estate. The Heskeths continued to reside\r\nat Rossall until the lifetime of the late Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood,\r\nbart.; and under their proprietorship, at an early period, or in the\r\nlatest years of their predecessors, the ancient Hall was pulled or washed\r\ndown and another mansion erected more removed from the shore.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the design of establishing a school for the education of the\r\nsons of clergymen and other gentlemen, under the direct superintendence\r\nof the Church of England, but at a less cost than incurred at the public\r\nschools then in existence, was first promulgated by the Rev. St. Vincent\r\nBeechey, incumbent of Thornton and Fleetwood; and mainly through the\r\nexertions of that gentleman a provisional committee for arranging details\r\nand furthering the object in view, was formed in the first month of the\r\nensuing year. This committee consisted, amongst others, of the Rev. J.\r\nOwen Parr, vicar of Preston, chairman; the Revs. Charles Hesketh, vicar\r\nof North Meols; William Hornby, vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre; John\r\nHull, vicar of Poulton; R. B. Robinson, incumbent of Lytham; St. Vincent\r\nBeechey, incumbent of Thornton and Fleetwood, hon. sec. _pro. tem._; and\r\nMessrs. Thomas Clifton, of Lytham Hall; Daniel Elletson, of Parrox Hall,\r\nand T. R. Wilson-ffrance, of Rawcliffe Hall. At their first meeting it\r\nwas decided that the management of the school should be placed in the\r\nhands of a committee of twenty-four of the principal clergy and laity in\r\nthe neighbourhood, of whom fourteen should be clergymen and ten laymen,\r\nwith power to fill up vacancies; that the bishop of the diocese should\r\nalways be the visitor; that the provisional committee should be the first\r\nmembers of the council, with which should rest the appointment of the\r\nprincipal, who must be in holy orders, at such a liberal salary as would\r\ninsure the services of one eminently qualified for so important a post;\r\nthat the council should have power to dismiss the principal; that the\r\ninternal management, subject to certain regulations, should be committed\r\nto the principal, who should have the appointment and dismissal of all\r\nthe inferior or subordinate masters; and that the system of education\r\nshould resemble that in the school connected with King’s College,\r\nLondon, and in Marlborough school, consisting of systematic religious\r\ninstruction, sacred literature, classics, mathematics, modern languages,\r\ndrawing, music, etc.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the admission of pupils it was resolved that the school\r\nshould consist of not less than two hundred boys; that no child should\r\nbe admitted under eight years of age; that the mode of admission should\r\nbe by annual payment, nomination, or insurance; that any pupil should be\r\nadmitted on the payment, half-yearly in advance, of £50 per annum for\r\nthe sons of laymen, and £40 for the sons of clergymen; that nominations\r\nmight be procured, at the first opening of the school, in order to raise\r\nthe required capital, whereby pupils could be admitted on the yearly\r\npayment of £40 for the sons of laymen, and £30 for the sons and wards\r\nof clergymen; that a donation of £25, or the holding of two £25 shares,\r\nfully paid up, should entitle the donor or holder, to one nomination,\r\nand a donation of £50, or the holding of four shares of £25 each, should\r\nconstitute the donor, or holder, a life-governor, entitled to have always\r\none pupil in the school on his nomination; that the shares should be\r\nlimited to an annual interest of 5 per cent., and be paid off as soon\r\nas possible, the return of such capital, however, not to destroy the\r\nright of nomination during the life of a governor; that clergymen should\r\nbe able to provide for the admission of their children to the school\r\nat a reduced charge of £25 per annum, by paying, on the principle of\r\nlife-insurance, small sums for several years previous to, or one large\r\nsum at, the date of entry of each child into the establishment, such\r\npayments to be regulated according to certain tables, and, of course,\r\nforfeited in case the child died.\r\n\r\nThe committee stated that the outlay of capital required to erect a\r\nbuilding expressly for the purposes of the school would be greater than\r\nthey were likely to be able to meet at the low rate of nomination which\r\nit had been deemed expedient to adopt, and, therefore, it had been\r\ndetermined to take advantage of the offer of Rossall Hall by Sir P. H.\r\nFleetwood, bart., the mansion being eminently adapted to the purpose, on\r\naccount of its size and situation. It contained many suites of rooms,\r\nand an organ chamber, well suited for a chapel, and furnished with a\r\nfine instrument; and surrounding the Hall were meadows convenient for\r\nplay-grounds, and very productive gardens.\r\n\r\nThe title of the Northern Church of England School was given to the\r\ninstitution, and on Thursday, the 22nd of August, 1844, it was formally\r\nopened by the Head Master, Dr. Woolley, in the presence of the junior\r\nmasters and from forty to fifty pupils, with their parents. At that date\r\nthe school-buildings consisted of apartments in the old Hall for the\r\nprincipal, junior masters, and lady superintendent; a dining room, 44\r\nfeet long and 20 feet wide, fitted with a general and masters’ tables;\r\nfour dormitories, able to accommodate 100 boys; and a chapel, formerly\r\nthe organ-room above mentioned, having benches for the scholars and\r\nstalls for the masters, the school-house itself consisting of four lofty\r\nrooms, each about 34 feet long by 20 feet wide, being detached from the\r\nHall, and fitted up with handsome oak desks and benches, fixed upon\r\nbronzed cast-iron standards. The play-ground comprised many acres, and in\r\naddition there were convenient covered areas for the recreation of the\r\nboys in wet weather.\r\n\r\nThe school was opened with only 70 pupils, but at the beginning of the\r\nsecond six months the number had increased to 115, and the establishment\r\nwas self-supporting.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the school have undergone some slight modifications and\r\nadditions since they were first framed by the provisional committee,\r\nand no pupils are now admitted under ten or over fifteen years of age,\r\nwhilst the annual payments of all pupils have been raised £20 in each\r\ncase. The insurance plan of entrance was never adopted. A donation of\r\n50 guineas now entitles the donor to a single nomination, and one of\r\n100 guineas constitutes him a life-governor, with power to vote at all\r\ngeneral meetings, and to have always one pupil in the school on his\r\nnomination. Other rules for the internal management and government of the\r\nschool have been framed as the number of scholars has increased and their\r\nrequirements become greater.\r\n\r\nThere are three exhibitions connected with this institution, of £50\r\na year each, called respectively the Council, Beechey, and Osborne\r\nexhibitions, (the last two being named after the late Honorary Secretary\r\nand the late Head Master, through whose exertions the funds were mainly\r\ncontributed,) tenable for three years at any of the colleges of Oxford or\r\nCambridge; and one of £10 a year, in books, tenable for three years, and\r\nfounded by Lord Egerton, of Tatton. Besides these there are about eight\r\nor ten entrance scholarships offered for competition every year, ranging\r\nin value from £10 to £20 each. Of these seven were founded by George\r\nSwainson, esq., and one by the Bishop of Rupertsland. A number of other\r\nspecial prizes have been instituted by the present Head Master, the Rev.\r\nH. A. James, B.D.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the estate was purchased, and since then fresh buildings have\r\nbeen erected to provide accommodation for 400 boys. The old chapel, which\r\nwas built to supersede the one in the organ-room, has of late years\r\nbeen converted into a library and class-room. A dining hall, schools,\r\nclass-rooms for different branches of study, spacious dormitories, and\r\na swimming bath have all been added; whilst extensive enlargements and\r\nimprovements have taken place in the sanatorium, kitchens, laundries,\r\netc. The old school has been arranged and fitted up as a lecture-room\r\nand laboratory. The new chapel is a handsome edifice, containing stained\r\nglass windows and a richly decorated chancel; it is dedicated to the Holy\r\nTrinity. It should be added that the original name,—The Northern Church\r\nof England School,—has been discontinued, and that of Rossall School,\r\nsubstituted, as a more comprehensive title for a great public school.\r\n\r\n  HEAD MASTERS OF ROSSALL SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------\r\n    Date of   |         NAME.               |   Cause of vacancy.\r\n  Appointment.|                             |\r\n  ------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------\r\n      1844    |Rev.

In 1254 the manor of Carleton in Lancashire belonged to Emma de\r\nSt. John, and at that date there appears to have been some litigation\r\nconcerning her right of proprietorship, but how settled we have no means\r\nof discovering.[103] In the _Testa de Nevill_ it is recorded that Roger\r\nGernet had the 24th part, and Robert de Stokeport the 48th, of a knights’\r\nfee in Little Carleton of William de Lancaster’s fee.\r\n\r\nThe earliest allusion to the local territorial family occurs in 1221,\r\nwhen Michael de Carleton, as before stated under “Thornton,” paid a\r\nfine to Henry III. for having espoused Margaret Wynewick, or Winwick,\r\na royal ward, without first obtaining permission from the king. It has\r\nbeen conjectured that Much Carleton received its peculiar title from\r\nthis member of the family, and amongst the records of some ancient\r\npleadings is one of 1557 concerning certain lands in _Miche Carlton_, a\r\nmode of writing the name which lends considerable support to the theory.\r\nAlyce Hull, widow, was the plaintive in the dispute. The Carletons, of\r\nCarleton, were connected with the neighbourhood for a very long period\r\nas holders of the manor; Alicia, the daughter of William de Carleton\r\nmarried Sir Richard Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall, in 1281, and received the\r\nmanor of Inskip as her dowry; and in 1346 H. de Carleton possessed four\r\ncarucates and a half in Carleton.[104] Thomas de Carleton held the manor\r\nof Carleton up to the time of his death in 1500, when he was succeeded\r\nby his son and heir George Carleton, aged 22,[105] who died in 1516,\r\nleaving an only child, William, then eleven years of age.[106] William\r\nde Carleton came into possession of the property on attaining his legal\r\nmajority,[107] and died in 1557, being succeeded by Lawrence Carleton,\r\nprobably his brother. Lawrence Carleton, who had married Margaret, the\r\ndaughter of George Singleton, of Staining, held the estate for barely\r\ntwelve months, as he died in 1558 without issue, leaving his lands and\r\ntenements in Carleton, amounting to several extensive messuages and\r\nCarleton Hall, to his only surviving sister, Margaret, the wife of Thomas\r\nAlmond.[108] Thus Lawrence Carleton was the last of the manorial family\r\nof that name connected with the township. Of the ancient Hall of Carlton,\r\nthe seat of the Carletons for over three centuries, nothing can be learnt\r\nbeyond the fact that it stood opposite the Gezzerts farm, and that\r\nalmost, if not quite, within the recollection of the present generation\r\nsome ruins of the once noble mansion were visible on its former site,\r\nlong since enclosed and used for purposes of agriculture. In 1261 the\r\nabbey of Cockersand held some property in Carleton, as appears from an\r\nagreement entered into at that date between the abbot of Cockersand and\r\nH. de Singleton Parva, by which the latter transferred a messuage in\r\nCarleton, by the side of other messuages already belonging to the abbey,\r\nto the abbot, in exchange for messuages and an acre of ground in the\r\nvicinity of Stanlawe abbey in Cheshire.[109] Stanlawe abbey itself had\r\nsundry possessions in Carleton shortly after its foundation in 1175,[110]\r\nall of which were conveyed to the abbey of Whalley in 1296, when the two\r\nmonastic houses were united, and thus it happened that this township was\r\nincluded amongst the localities in which Whalley abbey held lands at the\r\ntime of its dissolution.\r\n\r\nSometime during the reign of Henry VIII. the Sherburnes, of Stonyhurst,\r\nHambledon, etc., became holders of soil in Carleton, and at a later\r\nperiod had acquired the manorial rights and privileges. In 1717 Sir\r\nNicholas Sherburne, bart., bequeathed the manor of Carleton, amongst\r\nnumerous other estates, to his only child and heiress, Maria Winifreda\r\nFrancisca, the duchess of Norfolk, and two years later the duke of\r\nNorfolk had obtained a settlement by which he held a life interest in\r\nCarleton, Stonyhurst, and other places, the duchess, however, having\r\nreserved to herself the power to dispose of the reversion or inheritance\r\nby will or deed, executed in the duke’s lifetime. The duchess of\r\nNorfolk bequeathed her real estate, including Carleton, on her death\r\nin 1745, to her cousin Edward Weld, esq., grandson of Sir John Weld,\r\nof Lulworth Castle, Dorsetshire, whose descendant Edward Joseph Weld,\r\nesq., has disposed of most of his inheritance in the township to various\r\npurchasers, chiefly amongst the local yeomanry and gentry.\r\n\r\nThe Bambers, of the Moor, in Carleton, were people of position in the\r\ntownship. Richard Bamber, during the latter half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, married Anne, the daughter of Thomas Singleton, of Staining\r\nHall, and consequently was the brother-in-law of John Leckonby, of\r\nLeckonby House, Great Eccleston, who had espoused Alice, another daughter\r\nof the same gentleman. It is impossible to affirm with certainty what\r\nchildren sprang from the union of Richard Bamber and Ann Singleton, but\r\nof one of them, Edward, who entered the Romish priesthood, we subjoin an\r\ninteresting and tragic account, extracted from the “Memoirs of Missionary\r\nPriests, by the Right Rev. Richard Challoner, D.D.”:—\r\n\r\n  “Edward Bamber, commonly known upon the commission by the name\r\n  of Reding, was the son of Mr. Richard Bamber, and born at a\r\n  place called the Moor, the ancient mansion-house of the family,\r\n  lying not far from Poulton, in that part of Lancashire called\r\n  the Fylde. Having made good progress with his grammar studies at\r\n  home, he was sent abroad into Spain, to the English college at\r\n  Valladolid, where he learnt his philosophy and divinity, and was\r\n  ordained priest. My short memoirs leave us much in the dark as to\r\n  many passages and particulars relating to the life and labours\r\n  of this good priest, as well as to the history of his trial; but\r\n  then short as they are they are very expressive of his zeal and\r\n  indefatigable labours, his unwearied diligence in instructing\r\n  the catholics under his charge, disputing with protestants, and\r\n  going about doing good everywhere, with a courage and firmness\r\n  of mind almost above the power and strength of man. When, how,\r\n  or where, he was apprehended, I have not found, but only this,\r\n  that he had lain three whole years a close prisoner at Lancaster\r\n  castle, before he was brought to the bar, where he stood with an\r\n  air of fortitude and resolution of suffering in defence of truth.\r\n  Two fallen catholics, Malden and Osbaldeston, made oath that\r\n  they had seen him administer baptism and perform the ceremonies\r\n  of marriage; and upon these slender proofs of his priesthood,\r\n  the jury, by the judge’s direction, found him guilty of the\r\n  indictment. Whereupon the judge sentenced him to be hanged, cut\r\n  down alive, drawn, quartered, etc., as in cases of high treason.\r\n  It was on the 7th of August, 1646, that he, with two fellow\r\n  priests, and a poor wretch, named Croft, condemned to death for\r\n  felony, were drawn upon sledges to the place of execution at\r\n  Lancaster. There Mr. Bamber exhorted Croft to repentance, and\r\n  besought him to declare himself a Catholic, confess some of his\r\n  more public sins, and be truly contrite and sorry for all—‘and\r\n  I, a priest and minister of Jesus Christ, will instantly in\r\n  his name, and by his authority, absolve thee.’ On hearing this\r\n  the officers of Justice began to storm but Mr. Bamber held his\r\n  ground, and finally absolved the man in sight and hearing of\r\n  the crowd. As Mr. Bamber mounted up the ladder, he paused after\r\n  ascending a few steps, and taking a handful of money from his\r\n  pocket, threw it amongst the people, saying, with a smiling\r\n  countenance, that ‘God loveth a cheerful giver.’ Mr. Bamber was\r\n  encouraging Mr. Whitaker, one of the other two priests about to\r\n  suffer, who appeared not a little terrified at the approach of\r\n  death, to be on his guard against the temptation to save his life\r\n  by renouncing his creed, when the sheriff called out hastily to\r\n  the executioner to dispatch him (Bamber); and so he was that\r\n  moment turned off the ladder, and permitted to hang but a very\r\n  short time, before the rope was cut, the confessor being still\r\n  alive; and thus he was butchered in a most cruel and savage\r\n  manner.”\r\n\r\nThe two following verses, relating to his death, form part of a long ode\r\nor sonnet written at the time:—\r\n\r\n  “Few words he spoke—they stopp’d his mouth,\r\n    And chok’d him with a cord;\r\n  And lest he should be dead too soon,\r\n    No mercy they afford.\r\n\r\n  “But quick and live they cut him down,\r\n    And butcher him full soon;\r\n  Behead, tear, and dismember straight,\r\n    And laugh when all was done.”\r\n\r\nThe free school of Carleton was founded towards the close of the\r\nseventeenth century. On the 17th of May, 1697, Richard Singleton, John\r\nWilson, John Davy, and six others recited in an indenture between them,\r\nthat Elizabeth Wilson, of Whiteholme, by her verbal will of the 22nd\r\nof September, 1680, declared it to be her wish that the interest of a\r\nfourth of her goods, which amounted to £59 2s. 0d., should be used by\r\nthe overseers of Carleton for the purpose of procuring instruction for\r\nso many of the poorest children of the town of Carleton as they should\r\nthink proper; and that one-quarter of her estate had been invested\r\nin land, and the annual revenue therefrom employed according to her\r\nlast directions and desire. William Bamber, by will dated 13th of\r\nOctober, 1688, bequeathed £40 to his wife Margaret Bamber, and Richard\r\nHarrison, vicar of Poulton, to the intent that they should lay out the\r\nsum in land or other safe investment, not to yield less than 40s. per\r\nannum, half of which was to be given, at their discretion, amongst the\r\nmost needful of the poor of Great Carleton, and the other moiety to\r\nbe expended in purchasing books, or obtaining tuition for such poor\r\nchildren of the same place as they might select. After the deaths of\r\nthe two original trustees, the will directed that the bequest should\r\npass under the management of the vicar of Poulton, for the time being,\r\nand the churchwarden of Carleton. The money was invested on the 11th of\r\nMay, 1689, in a messuage and appurtenances, a barn, and several closes,\r\ncalled the Old Yard, the Great Field, the Croft, the New Hey, the Two\r\nCarrs, and the third part of a meadow, named the Great Meadow, all being\r\nsituated in Blackpool, and containing by estimation six acres and a half.\r\nThe property was immediately leased to the vendor, John Gualter, at a\r\nrental of 40s. a year. By an indenture, dated the 31st of December, 1706,\r\nbetween Sir Nicholas Sherburne, of Carleton, Hambleton, and Stonyhurst,\r\nand John Wilson, with three others, of Carleton, it appears that Sir\r\nNicholas leased to the latter, and their assigns, the school-house, newly\r\nerected at a place called the Four Lane Ends, in Great Carleton, and the\r\nsite thereof, for a term of 500 years from the foregoing date, at the\r\nnominal rent of 1s. per annum; and John Wilson, with his co-trustees,\r\ncovenanted that the same should be used for no other purpose but that of\r\na school, excepting that Sir Nicholas Sherburne and his heirs should\r\nhave free liberty to hold the courts for the manor of Carleton within\r\nthe building. Margaret Bickerstaffe, by her will of the 19th of April,\r\n1716, left £20, the interest of which she directed to be employed by\r\nher executors in educating some of the poor children of Carleton. On\r\nthe 2nd of February, 1737, Richard Butler and Richard Dickson, trustees\r\nfor the sale of certain estates for paying the debts of James Addinson,\r\nconveyed to George Hull, John Sanderson, and others, and their heirs, in\r\nconsideration of £42, a close in Thornton, formerly called Rushey Full\r\nLong Meadow, and now Wheatcake, comprising one acre, in trust, to hold\r\nthe same and pay the annual proceeds to the master of the Four Lane Ends\r\nschool “for his care and pains in teaching such poor children of Carleton\r\nas should be appointed each year by the chief inhabitants or officers\r\nof the township.” The money seems to have been given by some persons\r\nnot wishing to disclose their names, and who selected George Hull, John\r\nSanderson, and five more, as their agents in the matter, and as first\r\ntrustees of the charity. When five of the trustees had died, it was\r\nordained that seven fresh ones should be elected, and the two remaining\r\nbe relieved of their trust. John Addinson, in return for £20, given by\r\nsome person, to the inhabitants of Carleton, conveyed to the same parties\r\na close called the Rough Hey, in Thornton, containing half an acre, to be\r\ndealt with and used as in the previous case. It is very likely that the\r\n£20 here concerned was the sum before mentioned as the legacy of Margaret\r\nBickerstaffe. All the premises belonging to the school were vested in six\r\nnew trustees by a deed, dated 3rd of June, 1777; and at the visit of the\r\nschool commissioners in 1867, the attendance of boys was 50, and of girls\r\n20, being somewhere about the usual average of later years. The trustees\r\nmanage the school property, and appoint or dismiss the master.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF GREAT AND LITTLE CARLETON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    269    308    356    319    378    400    363    433\r\n\r\nThe area of the township embraces 1,979 statute acres.\r\n\r\nMERETUN, or the town of the Mere, was estimated by the surveyors of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror to comprise six carucates of arable land, and\r\nshortly afterwards Sir Adam de Merton held half of it, on condition that\r\nhe performed military service when required.[111] Somewhere about 1200\r\nWilliam de Merton, a descendant of Sir Adam, was one of the witnesses to\r\na charter, concerning a local marsh, between Cecilia de Laton and the\r\nabbot of Stanlawe.[112] In 1207-8 the sheriff of Lancashire received\r\norders to give Matilda, widow of Theobald Walter, her third of the lands\r\nat Mereton, which her late husband had held up to the time of his death\r\nin 1206, at first for 12s. per annum, and subsequently for one hawk each\r\nyear.[113] According to the _Testa de Nevill_, Henry III. held three\r\ncarucates of the soil of Mereton for a few years, as guardian of the\r\nheir of Theobald Walter, and in 1249, during the thirty-third year of\r\nthe reign of that monarch, Merton cum Linholme was in the possession of\r\nTheobald Walter, or le Botiler as he was afterwards called, the heir\r\nhere mentioned.[114] Marton descended in the Botiler, or Butler, family\r\nuntil the time of Henry VIII., when it was sold by Sir Thomas Butler to\r\nJohn Brown, a merchant of London, in company with Great Layton, of which\r\nmanor it had for long been regarded as a parcel, although in 1323, Great\r\nMarton was alluded to as a distinct and separate manor held by Richard le\r\nBotiler.[115] Marton was purchased from John Brown by Thomas Fleetwood,\r\nesq., of Vach, in the county of Buckingham, whose descendants and heirs\r\nresided at Rossall Hall; and after remaining in the Fleetwood family for\r\nmany generations the manor of Layton, with its dependency Marton, was\r\nagain sold, and this time became the property of Thomas Clifton, esq., of\r\nLytham Hall, Sir P. H. Fleetwood, bart., being the vendor.\r\n\r\nLittle Marton was held in trust by William de Cokerham, in 1330, for the\r\nabbot and convent of Furness,[116] but eight years afterwards, the manor\r\nof Weeton and Little Marton, were held by James, the son of Edmund le\r\nBotiler, earl of Ormond.[117] What claim James Botiler had to include\r\nLittle Marton amongst his possessions in 1338, cannot now be ascertained,\r\nbut it is certain that later, at the dissolution of monasteries, it\r\npassed to the crown as part of the fortified lands of Furness Abbey.\r\nSubsequently Little Marton passed to the Holcrofts, and from them, in\r\n1505, to Sir Cuthbert Clifton, of Lytham Hall, by exchange. John Talbot\r\nClifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, a descendant of Sir Cuthbert, and the\r\nson of the late Thomas Clifton, esq., of Lytham, is the present owner\r\nof Great and Little Marton. As the moss and mere of Marton, perhaps the\r\nmost interesting objects in the township, have been fully described in\r\nan earlier chapter, devoted to the country, rivers, etc., of the Fylde,\r\nwe refer our readers to that portion of the volume for more detailed\r\ninformation concerning them. In this place we must content ourselves\r\nby stating that the mere was at one time a lake of no inconsiderable\r\ndimensions, having a fishery of some value attached to it, and that from\r\nthe number of trunks of trees, discovered on the clayey soil beneath\r\nthe original moss, which extended six miles by one and a half, there is\r\nconclusive evidence that in ancient times the whole of the wide tract was\r\ncovered by a dense forest, composed chiefly of oak, yew, and fir trees.\r\nSo enormous were some of the trunks discovered that it was impossible for\r\none labourer to grasp the hand of another over them. The hamlet of Peel,\r\nsituated within, but close to the Lytham border of the township, contains\r\nin a field called Hall-stede, traces of the ancient turreted manorial\r\nmansion of the Holcrofts, of Winwick and Marton,[118] and the remains\r\nof a moat out of which about sixty years ago a drawbridge and two gold\r\nrings were taken. The old lake of Curridmere, mentioned in the foundation\r\ncharter of Lytham priory in the reign of Richard I., was also located in\r\nthis neighbourhood, the site being indicated by the soil it once covered\r\nbearing the name of the _tarns_. A little more than half a century since\r\nthe _tarns_ formed nothing but a trackless bog, and beneath its surface\r\na husbandman discovered the remains of a small open boat, which had\r\ndoubtless been used in earlier days on the waters of Curridmere.\r\n\r\nAbout 1625 the inhabitants of Marton petitioned, that in conjunction\r\nwith “Layton, Layton Rakes, and Blackpool,”[119] the township might be\r\nconstituted a separate parish, stating in support of their prayer that\r\nthe parish church of Poulton was five miles distant, and during the\r\nwinter they were debarred by inundations from attending that place\r\nof worship. This reasonable request does not appear to have evoked a\r\nfavourable response from the parliamentary commissioners, and it was not\r\nuntil more than a century and a half later that the district had its\r\nclaims to the privilege desired practically acknowledged. The church\r\nof St. Paul, in Great Marton was erected by subscription in 1800, and\r\nopened by license the same year, but was not consecrated until 1804. It\r\nwas a plain, unpretending structure with front and side galleries, but\r\nhaving neither chancel nor tower, and capable of holding upwards of 400\r\nworshippers. In 1857 the increase of the population rendered it necessary\r\nto lengthen the church at the east end, and at the same time a neat and\r\nsimple tower was added. Within the tower is the vestry, above which a\r\nnumber of seats were raised for the Sunday school children, many of whom\r\nhad previously, for want of space, occupied forms in the aisles. A porch\r\nwas built over the entrance of the church about 1848, and in 1871 a\r\nchancel was erected. Three bells were purchased by the parishioners, and\r\nplaced in the tower in 1868, whilst the present reading desk and pulpit,\r\nwere the gift of Miss Heywood, the daughter of Sir Benjamin Heywood,\r\nbart., who formerly had a handsome marine residence at Blackpool.\r\nPrevious to 1845 the musical portion of the service was accompanied by\r\ntwo bassoons and another wind instrument, but about that date they were\r\nabolished, and a barrel organ substituted, which continued in force until\r\na few years ago, when it was succeeded by the more modern key organ at\r\npresent in use. The church of Marton has now an ecclesiastical district\r\nof its own, but was originally a chapelry under Poulton. A little\r\nanterior to the erection of the church divine service was conducted\r\nin the school-house of Baines’s Charity, Mr. Sawyer being the first\r\nappointed minister.\r\n\r\n  CURATES AND VICARS OF MARTON.\r\n\r\n  ------------+---------------------+--------------------------\r\n    Date of   |        NAME.        | Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                     |\r\n  ------------+---------------------+--------------------------\r\n  About 1762  | ⸺ Sawyer            |\r\n    ”   1772  | George Hall         |\r\n    In  1814  | Thomas Bryer        | Death of G.

In\r\n1846 this house was pulled down, and another, elegant and commodious,\r\nerected in its place, being completed the following year. Attached to the\r\nparsonage are eleven acres of glebe land.\r\n\r\nJames Baines, of Poulton, by will dated 6th of January, 1717, devised\r\nunto John Hull and six others, of Marton, their heirs and assigns,\r\nthe school-house lately erected by him in Marton, the land whereon it\r\nstood, a messuage or tenement in Warbreck, containing about six acres,\r\na messuage or dwelling-house in Hardhorn-with-Newton, with the smithy\r\nand two shippons thereto belonging, and several closes of land in the\r\nsame township, called the Sheep Field, the Croft, the Garden, being\r\nabout three acres; also the Many Pits, the Debdale, the Cross Butts, the\r\nWradle Meadow, and the field adjoining its north-west end, and the Carr,\r\ncontaining twelve and a half acres, to the intent that the rents arising\r\nfrom the foregoing should after the deduction of 10s. for an annual\r\ndinner to the trustees, be directed to the maintenance of a master to\r\ninstruct the children of the township in the above-mentioned building.\r\nThe revenue of the school was greatly impoverished for many years by\r\nthe expenses of a chancery suit about 1850, which arose on the question\r\nwhether the school should be continued as formerly or be divided, and\r\npart of its income be devoted to the establishment and support of a\r\nsimilar institution in the adjoining district of Little Marton. The whole\r\nof the funds were defrayed out of the funds of the charity. A scheme for\r\nits regulation was framed in 1863 by the Master of the Rolls, providing\r\namongst other matters that the school should be open to Government\r\ninspection, but in no way interfering with its gratuitous character. The\r\ncommissioner of 1869 reports:—“Sixty-three children were present on the\r\nday of my visit, of whom fifty-two were girls, who are taught in the same\r\nclasses as the boys, and are with them in play hours. The school being\r\nfree, no register of attendance is kept. In arithmetic, six boys (average\r\nage 11), and four girls (average age 10½), did fair papers; the questions\r\nof course were simple ones. Grammar and geography, in which subjects I\r\nexamined the highest class, were tolerably good. The girls read well; the\r\nboys (as usual) less so; spelling was up to the average. The girls are\r\ntaught to write a bad angular hand; the master says that it is to please\r\nthe parents. He has been in his present position five years, and receives\r\na salary of £50 a year.” The school property consists of forty acres of\r\nland, producing a gross annual income of about £130. Both a playground\r\nand gymnasium are attached to the school. There are now two masters. The\r\nvicar of Poulton and the vicar of Marton, _ex officio_, and five other\r\ntrustees self-electing, residing within the township, appoint and dismiss\r\nthe masters, admit and expel scholars, appoint an examiner, and regulate\r\nthe studies. The chief master must be a member of the Church of England,\r\nand is not permitted to take boarders.\r\n\r\nMargaret Whittam, widow, by will dated 26th of July, 1814, bequeathed to\r\nEdward Hull, Richard Sherson, and John Fair, of Marton, and her brothers,\r\ntheir executors and administrators, the sum of £40, duty free, in trust,\r\nthe interest to be applied to the benefit of the Sunday school in Marton\r\nso long as it should continue to be taught, and in the event of its being\r\nabolished, to use the same income for the relief of such necessitous\r\npersons of the township as received no alms from the poor rate. The\r\nSunday school established in 1814 is still kept at Marton, and the master\r\npaid, in part from the interest of the legacy, and the remainder from\r\nsubscriptions. About twenty years ago between £200 and £300 were obtained\r\nby means of a bazaar, and expended in the erection of a school building\r\non a piece of waste land in Marton, for the purpose of providing for the\r\neducation of children, both male and female, under the superintendence\r\nof a mistress. At Marton Moss there is another school, used also as a\r\nchurch, being served from South Shore, which was built a few years since\r\nthrough the munificence of Lady Eleanor Cicily Clifton, of Lytham Hall;\r\nand at Moss Side, a small Wesleyan Chapel was erected by subscription\r\nabout 1871.\r\n\r\nEdward Whiteside, of Little Marton, sailor, bequeathed by will, dated\r\n22nd December, 1721, as follows:—“It is my will, that my ground be kept\r\nin lease, according as my executors shall see fit, and what spares it is\r\nmy will that they buy cloth and give it to poor people that has nothing\r\nout of the town; it is my will that it be given in Little Marton, and if\r\nthere be a minister that preaches in Marton, that they give him something\r\nwhat they shall see fit: It is my will, that if they can buy land, that\r\nthey sell my personal estate, and buy as much as it will purchase: It is\r\nmy will, that two acres, which my father hath now in possession, that\r\nwhen it falls into my hands and possession, that it go the way above\r\nnamed: It is my mind and will, that my executors give it when they shall\r\nsee fit, and I hope they will choose faithful men, who will act according\r\nto themselves; and I make my well-beloved friends, Anthony Sherson and\r\nThomas Grimbalson, executors of my last will.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Whiteside left by will, dated 1742, £100 to be invested, and the\r\nannual proceeds to be spent in furnishing clothing to the poor of Marton,\r\nnot in receipt of parish relief. John Hull, Thomas Webster, and Robert\r\nBickerstaffe, were the original trustees of this charity.\r\n\r\nJohn Hodgson, by will dated 25th of September, 1761, devised his messuage\r\nand lands in Marton, and his personal estate, to John Hull and Richard\r\nWhittam, their heirs and assigns, in trust, to dispose of the same, and\r\nafter paying his debts and funeral expenses, to lay out at interest\r\nthe remainder of the money so acquired, and devote the yearly income\r\ntherefrom to the purchase of meal for poor housekeepers of Great Marton,\r\nnot relieved from the town’s rate. The meal to be distributed annually on\r\nthe 25th of December. The net amount of the legacy was £100.\r\n\r\nEdward Jolly, of Mythorp, by indenture, dated 13th of February, 1784,\r\nconveyed to James Jolly, James Sherson, and Thomas Fair, their executors\r\nand assigns, the sum of £60, to the intent that it should be placed on\r\ngood security, and one shilling of the yearly income derived be expended\r\nweekly in bread, to be distributed each Sunday to those poor persons\r\nwho had attended divine service in the morning at the chapel of Great\r\nMarton. The deed directed that the dole should be given at the door of\r\nthe chapel immediately after morning service, by the clerk or some other\r\nauthorised person, and that in the event of Marton Chapel, which was\r\nthen unconsecrated and supported by subscription, being closed for four\r\nsuccessive Sundays, or converted into a Dissenting place of worship, the\r\nbread money should be transferred to the townships of Great and Little\r\nSingleton, and Weeton-cum-Preese; and the weekly allowance of food\r\nbe distributed as above at the parochial chapel of Great and Little\r\nSingleton. The dole, however, had to return to Marton chapel as soon as\r\nservice, according to the Church of England, was again conducted there.\r\nThe chapel alluded to was Baines’s school-house, where it had been the\r\ncustom of Edward Jolly to distribute bread each Sunday for several years\r\npreviously, and it was with the intention of rendering this practice\r\nperpetual, that the indenture was made. No re-investment of the money can\r\nbe legally made without the approval of the minister of Marton church.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF GREAT AND LITTLE MARTON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    972  1,093  1,397  1,487  1,562  1,650  1,691  1,982\r\n\r\nThe area of the township amounts to 5,452 statute acres, inclusive of the\r\nsheet of water called Marton mere.\r\n\r\nHARDHORN-WITH-NEWTON contains within the limits of its township the\r\nthree hamlets or villages of Hardhorn, Newton, and Staining, of which\r\nthe last only is alluded to in the Domesday Survey, where Staininghe is\r\nmentioned as comprising six carucates of land in service. The Coucher\r\nBook of Whalley Abbey furnishes much valuable and interesting information\r\nrelating to the district of Staining, and from it we find that sometime\r\nbetween 1175 and 1296 John de Lascy, constable of Chester, “gave and by\r\nthis charter confirms to God and the Blessed Mary, and to the abbot and\r\nmonks of the Benedictine Monastery (Locus) of Stanlawe the _vill_ of\r\nSteyninges, with all things belonging to it, in the _vill_ itself, in\r\nthe field, in roads, in footpaths, in meadows, in pastures, in waters,\r\nin mills, and in all other easements which are or can be there, for the\r\nsafety of my soul and those of my antecessors and successors. To be held\r\nand possessed in pure and perpetual gift without any duty or exaction\r\npertaining to me or my heirs, the monks themselves performing the service\r\nwhich the _vill_ owes to the lord King.” The monks of Stanlawe retained\r\npossession until 1296, when their monastic institution, with all its\r\nproperty, including Staining, was united to, or appropriated by, the\r\nabbey of Whalley, shortly after which, in 1298, an agreement was arrived\r\nat between the prior of Lancaster, who held Poulton church, and the abbot\r\nof Whalley, concerning the tithes of Staining, Hardhorn, and Newton.\r\n“At length,” says the record, “by the advice of common friends they\r\nsubmitted the matter to the arbitration of Robert de Pikeringe, Elbor.\r\nOfficial,” who decided that the abbot and convent of Whalley, formerly\r\nof Stanlawe, should receive in perpetuity the major tithes of every and\r\nall their lands within the boundaries of Staining, Hardhorn, and Newton,\r\nwhether the harvests were cultivated by the monks themselves or by their\r\ntenants; but the minor tithes, personal and obligatory, whether of the\r\nabbey tenants or of the secular servants, were adjudged to the vicar of\r\nthe church of Poulton and the prior and monks of Lancaster. The abbot of\r\nWhalley was also directed to pay to the prior of Lancaster at the parish\r\nchurch of Poulton an annual sum of eighteen marks, as an acknowledgment,\r\nhalf at the festival of St. Martin and the remainder at Pentecost. The\r\nCoucher Book contains several deeds of arrangement touching marsh-land\r\nin the vicinity of Staining. Cecilia de Laton, widow, gave to the abbot\r\nand convent of Stanlawe, all her marsh between certain land of Staining\r\nand a long ditch, so that the latter might mark the division between\r\nStaining and Little Layton, the witnesses to the transfer being William\r\nde Carleton, William de Syngleton, and Alan, his son, William de Merton,\r\nand Richard de Thornton; Cecilia de Laton also quitclaimed to the same\r\nmonastery all her right to the mediety of a marsh between “Mattainsmure”\r\nand Little Carleton. William le Boteler exchanged with the Stanlawe\r\nbrotherhood all the marsh between the ditch above mentioned and the\r\nland of Staining for a similar tract beyond the trench towards Great\r\nLayton, stipulating that if at any time a fishery should be established\r\nin the ditch, which was doubtless both wide and deep, the monks and he,\r\nor his heirs, should participate equally in the benefits accruing from\r\nit. Theobald Walter granted power to the abbot of Stanlawe to make use\r\nof his mere of Marton for the purpose of conducting therefrom a stream\r\nto turn the mill at Staining, belonging to the monastery, care being\r\ntaken that the fish in the said mere were not injured or diminished.\r\nWithin the grange of Staining a chantry was in existence, and its\r\nservices were presided over by two resident priests, whose duty it also\r\nwas to superintend the property held by the convent of Stanlawe, and\r\nsubsequently by the abbey of Whalley, in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the conventual possessions and rentals in\r\nStaining at the date of the Reformation:—The house of Staining 6s.\r\n0d.; Scotfolde close, held by Lawrence Richardson, 5s. 0d., also Cach\r\nMeadow, of one acre, 1s. 8d.; a messuage, 30 acres of land, held by\r\nLawrence Archer, £1 10s. 4d; a messuage, 16 acres, held by Thomas\r\nSalthouse, 16s. 0d.; a messuage, 15 acres, held by John Johnson, 18s.\r\n2d.; a fishery, held by Richard Whiteside, 18s. 4d.; a messuage, 15\r\nacres, held by Richard Harrison, 18s. 10d.; a messuage, 18 acres, held\r\nby William Salfer, 18s. 2d.; a messuage, 8 acres, held by William Hall,\r\n10s. 4d.; a house and a windmill, held by Lawrence Rigson, £2 0s. 0d.;\r\na messuage, 18 acres, held by Robert Gaster, 18s. 2d.; a messuage, 30\r\nacres, held by Constance Singleton, widow, £1 13s. 0d.; a messuage, 20\r\nacres, held by Thomas Wilkinson, £1 0s. 0d.; a messuage, 10 acres, held\r\nby John Pearson, 10s. 0d.; a messuage, 10 acres, held by the wife of\r\nWilliam Pearson, 10s. 0d.; a messuage, 6 acres, held by Robert Walsh,\r\n6s. 8d.; a messuage, 13 acres, held by Thomas Dickson, 13s. 4d., and 4\r\nhens; a messuage, 20 acres, held by John Sander, £1 0s. 0d. and 6 hens; a\r\nmessuage, 10 acres, held by William Hey, 10s. 0d. and 3 hens; a messuage,\r\n6 acres, held by Ralph Dape, 7s. 6d. and 3 hens; a messuage, 8½ acres,\r\nheld by the wife of Richard Dane, 7s. 6d. and three hens. In Hardhorn the\r\nabbey possessed a messuage, 10 acres, held by William Lethum, at 10s.\r\nper annum; a messuage, 20 acres, held by Robert Lethum, £1 0s. 0d.; a\r\nmessuage, 10 acres, held by Henry ffisher, 10s.; a messuage, 10 acres,\r\nheld by William Pearson, 10s. 0d. and 3 hens; a messuage, 10 acres,\r\nheld by John ffisher, 10s. 0d. and 3 hens: a messuage, 10 acres, held\r\nby William Silcocke, 10s. 0d. and 3 hens; a messuage, 10 acres, held\r\nby Richard Hardman until “ye time that Richard Hardman, son of William\r\nHardman, come to ye age of 21 yeares,” 10s. 0d.; a messuage, 10 acres,\r\nheld by Richard Hardman, junior, 10s. 0d. and 3 hens; a messuage, 10\r\nacres, held by Robert Silcocke, 10s. 0d.; a messuage, 12 acres, held by\r\nRobert Whiteside, 12s. 6d. and 3 hens; a messuage, 12 acres, held by\r\nRichard Bale, 12s. 6d. and 3 hens; a messuage, 7 acres, held by Henry\r\nffisher, junior, 7s. 6d. and 2 hens; a messuage, 2 acres, held by John\r\nAllards, 2s. 0d. and 2 hens; a messuage, 10 acres, held by John Walch,\r\n10s. 0d. and three hens; a messuage, 10 acres, held by Robert Crow,\r\n10s. 0d. and 2 hens; a messuage, 20 acres, held by Richard Garlick, £1\r\n0s. 0d. and 6 hens; a messuage, 10 acres, held by John Ralke, 10s. 0d.\r\nand 3 hens; a messuage, 10 acres, held by Edmund Holle, 10s. 0d. In\r\nCarleton the abbey owned a close named Whitbent, which William Carleton\r\nrented at 1s. 6d., a year; and in Elswick, a barn and 3 acres of land,\r\nheld by Christopher Hennett, for an annual payment of 3s. 4d. In the\r\nCoucher Book of Whalley Abbey, from which the foregoing information has\r\nbeen obtained there occurs the following notice, relating to the Hall,\r\napparently written when the above survey was made:—“The house of Stayning\r\nis in length xxvii. yards, and lofted ou’r and slated; ye close called\r\nye little hey contains by estimation halfe an acre, and ye said house\r\npayeth yearly, 6s.” Sir Thomas Holt, of Grizlehurst, appears to have\r\nbeen the first proprietor of the conventual lands of Staining after they\r\nhad been confiscated to the crown at the dissolution of monasteries;\r\nand from him they were purchased, either towards the end of the reign\r\nof Henry VIII., or at the commencement of that of Edward VI., by George\r\nthe son of Robert Singleton, by his wife Helen, daughter of John Westby,\r\nof Mowbreck. The Singletons, of Staining, resided at the Hall until the\r\nclose of the seventeenth century, and during that long period formed\r\nalliances with several of the local families of gentry, as the Carletons\r\nof Carleton, the Fleetwoods of Rossall, the Bambers of Carleton, and\r\nthe Masseys of Layton. On the death of George Singleton, the last of\r\nthe male representatives of the Singletons of Staining, somewhere about\r\n1790, the estates descended to John Mayfield, the son of his sister\r\nMary, and subsequently, on his decease without issue, to his nephew and\r\nheir-at-law, William Blackburne. Staining Hall, now the property of\r\nW. H. Hornby, esq., of Blackburn, is a small and comparatively modern\r\nresidence, presenting in itself nothing calling for special notice or\r\ncomment from an antiquarian point of view. Remains of the old moat,\r\nhowever, are still in existence round the building, but beyond this there\r\nis no indication of the important station the Hall must have formerly\r\nheld in the surrounding country, both as the abode of some of its\r\npriestly proprietors, of Stanlawe and Whalley, and the seat of a family\r\nof wealth and position, like the Singletons would seem to have been.\r\n\r\nThe township of Hardhorn-with-Newton contains the free school erected\r\nand endowed by Mr. James Baines, which has already been fully noticed in\r\nthe chapter devoted to Poulton. In the hamlet of Staining a chapel and\r\nschool combined was erected by private munificence in 1865, the former\r\nbuilding used for such purposes being both inadequate and inappropriate.\r\nThe foundation stone was laid by Mrs. Clark, the wife of the late vicar\r\nof Poulton, on a site given by W. H. Hornby, esq., of Blackburn and\r\nStaining. The ceremony took place on the 26th of May, 1865, and on the\r\n3rd of December in that year service was first performed in the edifice\r\nby the Rev. Richard Tonge, of Manchester. The building is of brick, with\r\nstone dressings, and comprises a nave, apsis, and tower of considerable\r\naltitude, containing a fine toned bell.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February, 1748, Thomas Riding re-leased to John Hornby and\r\nThomas Whiteside, a dwelling-house and certain premises for the remainder\r\nof a term of 1,000 years, to be held in trust by them and their heirs\r\nfor the use and benefit of the poor housekeepers in Hardhorn-with-Newton\r\ntownship, in such manner as directed by the will of Ellen Whitehead. The\r\nproperty of this charity in 1817 consisted of half an acre of ground,\r\nand three cottages and a weaving shed standing upon it, together with\r\n£40 in money, out at interest. It cannot be ascertained either who Ellen\r\nWhitehead was or when she died.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF HARDHORN-WITH-NEWTON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    311    324    392    409    358    386    389    436\r\n\r\nThe area of the township extends over 2,605 statute acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH OF BISPHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiscopham was the appellation bestowed on the district now called\r\nBispham at and before the era of William the Conqueror, in whose survey\r\nit appears as embracing within its boundaries eight carucates of arable\r\nland. The original name is simply a compound of the two Anglo-Saxon\r\nwords _Biscop_, a bishop, and _Ham_, a habitation or settlement, the\r\nsignification of the whole being obviously the ‘Bishop’s town,’ or\r\n‘residence.’ Hence it is clear that some episcopal source must be\r\nlooked to as having been the means of conferring the peculiar title\r\non the place, and fortunately for the investigator, the annals of\r\nhistory furnish a ready clue to what otherwise might have proved a\r\nquestion difficult, or perhaps impossible, of satisfactory solution.\r\nIn a previous chapter it has been noted that for long after the reign\r\nof Athelstan Amounderness was held by the See of York, and nothing can\r\nbe more natural than to suppose, when regarding that circumstance in\r\nconjunction with the significance of the name under discussion, that the\r\narchbishops of the diocese had some residence on the soil of Bispham. It\r\nis quite possible, however, that there may have been merely a station of\r\necclesiastics who collected the rents and tithes of the Hundred on behalf\r\nof the bishopric, acting in fact as stewards and representatives of the\r\narchbishop for the time being, but in either case it is evident that\r\nthe name and, consequently, the town, are of diocesan origin, doubtless\r\nassociated with the proprietorship above mentioned. The presence of\r\npriests in residence within the manor of Bispham would necessarily lead\r\nto the establishment there of some chapel or oratory, and the absence\r\nof any allusion to such a structure by the investigators of William I.\r\nseems, at the first glance, a serious obstacle to the episcopal theory,\r\nbut Bispham was located between the two Danish colonies of Norbreck\r\nand Warbreck, a people whose hostility to all religious houses was\r\nalmost proverbial, and hence it is scarcely likely that a church so\r\nconveniently situated, as that of Bispham would be, could long escape\r\nspoliation and destruction after the prelates of York had removed their\r\nprotection from the neighbourhood, at some date anterior to the arrival\r\nof the Normans in England. The ravages of the Danes indeed, throughout\r\nthe Hundred of Amounderness are usually the reasons assigned why the\r\ndistrict was relinquished by the See of York, so that the non-existence\r\nof a sacred pile of any description at the period of the Domesday Survey,\r\nis in no way contradictory of such a building having been there, at an\r\nearlier epoch. At the close of the Saxon dynasty the number of acres\r\nin cultivation in the manor of Bispham exceeded those of the five next\r\nlargest manors in the Fylde by two hundred, thus Staining, Layton,\r\nSingleton, Marton, and Thornton, each contained six hundred acres of\r\narable soil, whilst Bispham had eight hundred in a similar condition.\r\nAbout thirty years after the Norman Survey, Geoffrey, the sheriff,\r\nbestowed the tithes of Biscopham, upon the newly founded priory of St.\r\nMary, in Lancaster, being incited thereto by the munificent example of\r\nRoger de Poictou. In this grant no allusion is made to any church, an\r\nomission which we should barely be justified in considering accidental,\r\nbut which would rather seem to indicate that the edifice was not erected\r\nuntil later. The earliest allusion to it is found in the reign of Richard\r\nI., 1189—1199, when Theobald Walter quitclaimed to the abbot of Sees,\r\nin Normandy, all his right in the advowson of Pulton and the church of\r\nBiscopham, pledging himself to pay to the abbey ten marks a year during\r\nthe period that any minister presented by him or his heirs held the\r\nliving.[120] In 1246 the mediety of Pulton and Biscopham churches was\r\nconveyed to the priory of St. Mary, in Lancaster, an offshoot from the\r\nabbey of Sees, by the archdeacon of Richmond; and in 1296 the grant was\r\nconfirmed to the monastery by John Romanus, then archdeacon of Richmond,\r\nwho supplemented the donation of his predecessor with a gift of the\r\nother mediety, to be appropriated after the decease of the person in\r\npossession, stipulating only that when the proprietorship became complete\r\nthe conventual superiors should appoint a vicar at an annual salary\r\nof twenty marks. At the suppression of alien priories the church of\r\nBispham was conveyed to the abbey of Syon, and remained attached to that\r\nfoundation until the Reformation of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe original church of Bispham, subsequently to the Norman invasion,\r\nwas built of red sandstone, and comprised a low tower, a nave, and one\r\naisle. A row of semicircular arches, resting on round, unornamented\r\npillars, supported the double-gabled roof, which was raised to no great\r\naltitude from the ground; whilst the walls were penetrated by narrow\r\nlancet windows, three of which were placed at the east end. The pews were\r\nsubstantial benches of black oak. In 1773 this venerable structure was\r\ndeprived of its flag roof and a slate one substituted, the walls at the\r\nsame time being raised to their present height. During the alterations\r\nthe pillars were removed and the interior thoroughly renovated, more\r\nmodern windows being inserted a little later. There is a traditional\r\nstatement that the church was erected by the monks of Furness, but beyond\r\nthe sandstone of which it was built having in all probability come from\r\nthat locality, there appears to be nothing to uphold such an idea. Over\r\nthe main entrance may still be seen an unmistakable specimen of the\r\nNorman arch, until recent years covered with plaster, and in that way\r\nretained in a very fair state of preservation.\r\n\r\nIn 1553 a commission, whose object was to investigate “whether ye belles\r\nbelongynge to certayne chapelles which be specified in a certayne shedule\r\nbe now remayning at ye said chapelles, or in whose hands or custodie\r\nthe same belles now be,” visited Bispham, and issued the following\r\nreport:—“William Thompson and Robert Anyan, of ye chapell of Byspham,\r\nsworne and examyned, deposen that one belle mentioned in ye said shedule\r\nwas solde by Edwarde Parker, named in ye former commission, unto James\r\nMassie, gent., for ye some of XXIIIˢ. IVᵈ.” Nothing is known respecting\r\nthe number or ultimate destination of the peal alluded to. The belfry can\r\nnow only boast a pair of bells.\r\n\r\nFormerly there were many and various opinions as to the dedication of\r\nthe church, Holy Trinity and All Saints having both been suggested, but\r\nthe question is finally set at rest by a part, in fact the sole remnant,\r\nof the ancient communion service, the chalice, which is of silver gilt,\r\nand bears the inscription:—“The gift of Ann, Daughter to John Bamber, to\r\nye Church of Allhallows, in Bispham; Delivered by John Corritt, 1704.”\r\nWithin the building, fastened to the east wall, and immediately to the\r\nright of the pulpit, are four monumental brasses inscribed as under:—\r\n\r\n  “Here lyes the body of John Veale, late of Whinney Heys, Esq.,\r\n  who dyed the 20th Jan., 1704, aged sixty.”\r\n\r\n  “Here lyes the body of Susannah, wife of the late John Veale,\r\n  Esq., of Whinney Heys, Esq., who departed this life the 20th of\r\n  May, 1718, aged 67 years.”\r\n\r\n  “Here lyes the body of Edward Veale, late of Whinney Heys, Esq.,\r\n  who departed this life the 11th of August, 1723, aged 43 years.”\r\n\r\n  “Here lyes the body of Dorothy Veale, eldest daughter of John\r\n  Veale, late of Whinney Heys, Esq., who departed this life the 9th\r\n  day of January, in the year of our Lord, 1747, and in the 77th\r\n  year of her age.”\r\n\r\nBeneath these tablets, the only ones in the church, was the family vault\r\nof the Veales, of Whinney Heys, now covered over by pews. During the\r\nyear 1875 the nave was re-seated, and at the time when the flooring was\r\ntaken up numerous skulls and bones were found in different parts of the\r\nbuilding, barely covered with earth, plainly indicating that interments\r\nhad once been very frequent within the walls, and causing us to wonder\r\nthat no mural or other monuments, beyond those just given, are now\r\nvisible, or, indeed, remembered by any of the old parishioners. None\r\nof the stones in the graveyard are of great antiquity, and the most\r\ninteresting object on that score is a portion of an ancient stone cross,\r\nhaving the letters I.H.S. carved upon it, on the broken summit of which\r\na sun-dial has been mounted. Tradition has long affirmed that Beatrice,\r\nor Bridget, the daughter of Oliver Cromwell, who espoused General Ireton,\r\nand after his death General Fleetwood, lies buried here, but this is\r\na mistake, probably arising from the proximity of the Rossall family,\r\nhaving the same name as her second husband; the lady was interred at\r\nStoke Newington on the 5th of September, 1681. There are no stained glass\r\nwindows, and the walls of the church are whitewashed externally.\r\n\r\n  PERPETUAL CURATES AND VICARS OF BISPHAM.\r\n\r\n  ------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------\r\n    Date of   |        NAME.       |   On whose        | Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                    |   Presentation.   |\r\n  ------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------\r\n  Before 1559 |Jerome Allen        |Abbey of Syon      |\r\n  About  1649 |John Fisher         |                   |\r\n  In     1650 |John Cavelay        |                   |Resignation of J.\r\n              |                    |                   |  Fisher\r\n  Before 1674 |Robert Brodbelt     |                   |Death of J.\r\n              |                    |                   |  Cavelay\r\n    ”    1689 |Robert Wayte        |                   |\r\n    ”    1691 |Thomas Rikay        |                   |Death of R.

Charles Hesketh, M.A., of North Meols, has\r\nbeen the patron for almost half a century. Divine worship, according to\r\nthe ritual of the Roman Catholics, was last celebrated in Bispham church\r\nduring March, 1559, immediately after the death of Queen Mary, when\r\nher protestant successor, Elizabeth, ascended the throne. The pastor,\r\nJerome Allen, a member of the Benedictine brotherhood, assembled his\r\nflock at nine in the morning of the 25th of that month, and previous\r\nto administering the holy sacrament, addressed a few words of farewell\r\nand advice to his congregation. “Suffused in tears,” records the diary\r\nof Rishton, “this holy and good man admonished his people to obey the\r\nnew queen, who had succeeded Mary, the late one, and besought them to\r\nlove God above all things, and their neighbours as themselves.” It is\r\nsaid that after vacating his cure at Bispham, the Rev. Jerome Allen,\r\nretired to Lambspring, in Germany, where he spent the remainder of his\r\nlife in the strictest religious observances enjoined by his creed. In\r\n1650 the following remarks concerning Bispham were recorded by the\r\necclesiastical commissioners of the Commonwealth:—“Bispham hath formerly\r\nbeen a parish church, containing two townships, Bispham-cum-Norbreck\r\nand Layton-cum-Warbreck, and consisting of three hundred families; the\r\ninhabitants of the said towns desire that they may be made a parish.” In\r\nthe survey of the Right Rev. Francis Gastrell, D.D., bishop of Chester,\r\nthe annexed notice occurs:—“Bispham. Certif. £8 0s. 0d., viz., a parcell\r\nof ground, given by Mr. R. Fleetwood, worth, taxes deducted, £5 per\r\nyear; Easter Reckonings, £3. Richard Fleetwood, esq., of Rossall Hall,\r\nsettled upon the church in 1687 a Rent Charge of £10 per ann. for ever.\r\nBispham-cum-Norbreck, and Layton-cum Warbreck, for which places serve\r\nfour Churchwardens, two chosen by the ministers and two by the parish.”\r\nIn 1725 Edward Veale, of Whinney Heys, gave £200 to augment the living,\r\nand a similar amount was granted from Queen Anne’s Bounty for a like\r\npurpose. Three years later £400 more were acquired, half from the fund\r\njust named, and half from Mr. S. Walter. The parish registers commence in\r\n1599.\r\n\r\nWilliam le Botiler, or Butler, held the manors of Layton, Bispham, and\r\nWarbreck, according to the Duchy Feordary, in the early part of the\r\nfourteenth century, and in 1365 his son, Sir John Botiler, granted the\r\nmanors of Great and Little Layton and Bispham, to Henry de Bispham and\r\nRichard de Carleton, chaplains. Great Bispham probably remained in the\r\npossession of the church until the dissolution of the monasteries.\r\nNorbreck and Little Bispham appear to have belonged to the convent of\r\nSalop, and were leased by William, abbot of that house, together with\r\ncertain tithes in Layton, to the abbot and convent of Deulacres, by an\r\nundated deed, for eight marks per annum, due at Martinmas.[121] In 1539\r\nthe brotherhood of Deulacres paid rent for lands in Little Bispham and\r\nNorbreck, and an additional sum of 2s. to Sir Thomas Butler, for lands in\r\nGreat Bispham.[122] After the Reformation, Bispham was granted by Edward\r\nVI., in the sixth year of his reign, to Sir Ralph Bagnell, by whom it was\r\nsold to John Fleetwood, of Rossall; and in 1571, Thomas Fleetwood, the\r\ndescendant of the last-named gentleman, held Great and Little Bispham and\r\nLayton.[123] The manors remained invested in the Rossall family until the\r\nlifetime of the late Sir P. H. Fleetwood, by whom they were sold to the\r\nCliftons, of Lytham, John Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, being the\r\npresent lord.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined account of a shipwreck on this coast is taken from the\r\njournal of William Stout, of Lancaster, and illustrates the uses to which\r\nthe church was occasionally put in similar cases of emergency:—\r\n\r\n  “Our ship, Employment, met with a French ship of some force,\r\n  bound to Newfoundland, who made a prize of her. The French\r\n  were determined to send her directly to St. Malo; when John\r\n  Gardner, the master, treated to ransome her, and agreed with the\r\n  captors for £1,000 sterling. The French did strip the sailors\r\n  of most of their clothes and provisions; and coming out of a\r\n  hot climate to cold, before they got home they were so weak\r\n  that they were scarce able to work the ship, and the mate being\r\n  not an experienced pilot, spent time in making the land, and\r\n  was embayed on the coast of Wales, but with difficulty got off,\r\n  and then made the Isle of Man, and stood for Peel Fouldrey, but\r\n  missed his course, so that he made Rossall Mill for Walna Mill,\r\n  and run in that mistake till he was embayed under the Red Banks,\r\n  behind Rossall, so as he could not get off; and it blowing hard,\r\n  and fearing she would beat, they endeavoured to launch their\r\n  boat; but were so weak that they could not do it, but came to an\r\n  anchor. She struck off her rudder, and at the high water mark\r\n  she slipped her cables and run on shore, in a very foul strong\r\n  place, where she beat till she was full of water, but the men\r\n  got well to land. But it was believed if they had been able to\r\n  launch the boat and attempted to land in her, the sea was so high\r\n  and the shore so foul, that they might have all perished. This\r\n  happened on the 8th month, 1702, and we had early notice of it to\r\n  Lancaster, and got horses and carts with empty casks to put the\r\n  damaged sugars in, and to get on shore what could be saved, which\r\n  was done with much expedition. We got the sugar into Esquire\r\n  Fleetwood’s barn, at Rossall, and the cotton wool into Bispham\r\n  chapel, and in the neap tides got the carpenters at work, but a\r\n  storm came with the rising tides and beat the ship to pieces. The\r\n  cotton wool was sent to Manchester and sold for £200.”\r\n\r\nIn the early years of this century Bispham contained a manufactory for\r\nthe production of linsey-woolsey. The building was three stories in\r\nheight, and employed a considerable number of hands. Subsequently it\r\nwas converted into a ladies’ school, and afterwards pulled down. Two or\r\nthree residences in the township near the site of the old manufactory\r\nstill retain the names of ‘factory houses,’ from their association with\r\nit. There is a small Nonconformist place of worship in the village,\r\nsurrounded by a wall, being partially covered with ivy and overshadowed\r\nby trees. This edifice is called Bethel Chapel, and a date over the\r\ndoorway fixes its origin at 1834. In 1868 a Temperance Hall, comprising\r\na reading room, library, and spacious lecture and assembly room, was\r\nerected here by subscription, and forms one of the most striking objects\r\nin the village. The Sunday school connected with the parish church, and\r\nsituated by its side, was erected also by subscription, in 1840, and\r\nrebuilt on a larger scale in 1873.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Norbreck is situated on the edge of the cliffs overhanging\r\nthe shore of the Irish Sea, and consists of several elegant residences\r\ntenanted by Messrs. Swain, Burton, Harrison, Wilson, and Richards. None\r\nof the houses present any features calling for special comment, but\r\nappear, like others at no great distance, as Bispham Lodge, the seat\r\nof Frederick Kemp, esq., J.P., to have been built within comparatively\r\nrecent years as marine retreats for the gentry of neighbouring towns, or\r\nothers more intimately associated with the locality.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF BISPHAM-WITH-NORBRECK.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    254    297    323    313    371    394    437    556\r\n\r\nThe area of the township includes 2,624 statute acres.\r\n\r\nThe Free Grammar School was established in 1659, when Richard Higginson,\r\nof St. Faith’s, London, bequeathed unto the parish of Bispham sundry\r\nannual gifts in perpetuity, and especially the yearly payment of £30 for\r\nand towards the support of a school-master and usher at the school of\r\nBispham, lately erected by him. From a subsequent deed it appears that\r\nthe annual sums were made chargeable on two messuages in Paternoster\r\nRow, London, belonging to the dean and chapter of St. Pauls, but as the\r\ninterest Higginson possessed in such property was acquired at the sale\r\nof the dean and chapter lands during the Commonwealth, it followed that\r\non the restoration of Charles II., the rentals forming his bequest were\r\nnot forthcoming. Further, the document recites that John Amburst, of\r\nGray’s-inn, esq., and Elizabeth, his wife, who was the widow and sole\r\nexecutrix of Richard Higginson, being desirous that the object of the\r\nfounder should be carried out, paid to John Bonny and others in trust\r\n£200, to be invested in land and the annual income thereof devoted to the\r\nmaintenance of an able and learned schoolmaster at the before-mentioned\r\nschool of Bispham. The costs of a chancery suit in 1686 reduced the\r\ndonation to £180, but the trustees made up the sum to the original\r\namount and reimbursed themselves by deducting £5 per annum from the\r\nsalary of the master for four years. In 1687, Henry Warbreck conveyed\r\nin consideration of £200, to James Bailey and five other trustees of\r\nthe charity, elected by a majority of the inhabitants, the closes known\r\nas the Two Tormer Carrs, the Two New Heys, the Great Hey, the Pasture,\r\nthe Boon Low Side, the Little Field, and 35 falls of ground on the west\r\nof the Meadow Shoot close, amounting to about 14 acres, and situated in\r\nLayton, “for the above-named pious use; and it was agreed, that when any\r\nthree of the five trustees, or six of any eight which should hereafter be\r\nchosen, should happen to die, the survivors should convey the premises\r\nto eight new trustees to be chosen, two out of each of the respective\r\ntownships of Layton, Warbreck, Bispham, and Norbreck, by the consent of\r\nthe major part of the inhabitants of those townships, and that the said\r\ntrustees should from time to time employ the rents for and towards the\r\nmaintenance and benefit of an able and learned schoolmaster, to teach\r\nat the school at Bispham.”[124] In 1817, Thomas Elston, and George\r\nHodgson, of Layton, Robert Bonny, and William Bonny, of Warbreck, William\r\nButcher, junior, and James Tinkler, of Bispham, and Thomas Wilson, and\r\nJoseph Hornby, of Norbreck, were appointed trustees at a public meeting\r\nconvened by William Bamber and William Butcher, the two surviving\r\ntrustees. The newly elected governors were directed “to permit the\r\ndwelling-house and school to be used as a residence for the schoolmaster\r\nand a public school for the instruction of the children of the parish of\r\nBispham-with-Norbreck, in reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar,\r\nand the principles of the English religion, gratuitously, as had been\r\nheretofore done, and to hold the residue of the premises upon the trust\r\nmentioned in the last deed.”[125] The commissioner who visited the\r\nschool in 1868 remarked:—“The building is an old house, through whose\r\nthatched roof the rain penetrates in winter, dropping all over the desks,\r\nand gathering in pools upon the floor; the room is very small, 30½ by\r\n14½ feet and 7½ feet high to the spring of the roof, and the air being\r\nso foul that I was obliged to keep the door open while examining the\r\nchildren.” The use of the dilapidated structure here alluded to has been\r\ndiscontinued, and the scholars assemble in a room in the Temperance Hall\r\nuntil a fresh school-house has been erected.\r\n\r\nLAYTON-WITH-WARBRECK is the second of the two townships comprised in\r\nthe ancient parish of Biscopham or Bispham. The Butlers, barons of\r\nWarrington, were the earliest lords of Layton. In 1251, Robert Botiler,\r\nor Butler, obtained a charter for a market and fair to be held in “his\r\nmanor of Latton.” The estate descended in the same family with some\r\ninterruptions, until the reign of Henry VIII., when it was sold by Sir\r\nThomas Butler to John Brown, of London, who on his part disposed of it,\r\nin 1553, to Thomas Fleetwood. The manor was retained by the Fleetwoods up\r\nto the time of the late Sir. P. Hesketh Fleetwood, of Rossall, by whom it\r\nwas conveyed, through purchase, to the Cliftons, of Lytham. The following\r\nabstract from the title deed touching the transfer of the property from\r\nJohn Brown to Thomas Fleetwood will not be without interest to the\r\nreader:—\r\n\r\n  “By Letters Patent under the Great Seal of England, bearing date\r\n  the 19th day of March, in the first year of the reign of Queen\r\n  Mary. After reciting that Sir Thomas Butler, Knight, was seized\r\n  in fee of the Mannour of Layton, otherwise Great Layton, with the\r\n  Appurtenances, in the county of Lancaster, and that his estate,\r\n  title, and interest therein by due course of Law, came to King\r\n  Henry the Eighth, who entered thereon and was seized in fee\r\n  thereof, and being so seized did by his letters patents under\r\n  the seal of his Duchy at Lancaster, bearing date the 5th day of\r\n  April, in the thirty-fourth year of his Reign, (amongst other\r\n  things) give, grant, and restore unto the said Sir Thomas Butler,\r\n  his heirs, and Assigns, the said Mannour and its Appurtenances,\r\n  by virtue whereof the said Sir Thomas Butler entered and was\r\n  seized in fee thereof, and granted the same to John Brown,\r\n  Citizen and Mercer of London, his heirs and assigns, and that\r\n  Brown entered and was seized thereof in fee, and granted and sold\r\n  the same to Thomas Fleetwood, Esq., his heirs and Assigns, and\r\n  that the said Thomas Fleetwood entered thereon and was at that\r\n  time seized in fee thereof. And further reciting that the said\r\n  Sir Thomas Butler held and enjoyed the said Mannour, with its\r\n  Appurtenances, from the time of making said Grant until he sold\r\n  and conveyed the same to the said Brown without disturbance, and\r\n  that the said Brown held the same until he sold and conveyed to\r\n  the said Thomas Fleetwood without disturbance, and that the said\r\n  Thomas Fleetwood had held and enjoyed the same for near four\r\n  years without disturbance, and was then seized in fee thereof.\r\n  But because it had been doubted whether the said Letters Patent\r\n  and Grant made by King Henry the Eighth to Sir Thomas Butler\r\n  were good and valid in the Law, because they were under the\r\n  Seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, and not under the Great Seal,\r\n  and because it appeared unto her said Majesty, that the said\r\n  King Henry the Eighth, her Father, had promised that the said\r\n  Sir Thomas Butler, should have the said Grant either under the\r\n  Great Seal or the seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, She willing\r\n  to perform her Father’s promise and to remove all doubts, and\r\n  for greater security of the said Mannour, unto the said Thomas\r\n  Fleetwood and his heirs, and in consideration of the faithful\r\n  services done by the said Thomas Fleetwood to her said Father,\r\n  and to her Brother King Edward the Sixth, and to her, did give,\r\n  grant, and confirm unto the said Thomas Fleetwood, his heirs and\r\n  assigns, the Mannour of Layton, otherwise Great Layton, with\r\n  its rights, members, and Appurtenances, in the said county of\r\n  Lancaster, and all and singular the Messuages, Houses, Buildings,\r\n  Tofts, Cottages, Lands, Tenements, Meadows, Feedings, Pastures,\r\n  &c. &c. &c., Fishing, Wrecks of the Sea, Woods, Underwoods, &c.\r\n  &c. &c., commodities, emoluments and Hereditaments whatsoever,\r\n  with their Appurtenances, situate, lying, and being in the Vill,\r\n  Fields, or Hamlets of Layton, otherwise Great Layton, aforesaid,\r\n  which were of the said Thomas Butler, and which the said John\r\n  Brown afterwards sold to the said Thomas Fleetwood as aforesaid,\r\n  To hold the same unto the said Thomas Fleetwood his heirs and\r\n  assigns for ever.”\r\n\r\nReverting to the market and fair above-mentioned we find that in 1292 Sir\r\nWilliam le Botiler was called upon to show upon what right he laid claim\r\nto free warren in Layton, and two other places. In proving his case, the\r\nknight stated that his privileges extended to markets, fairs, and assize\r\nof bread and beer, in addition to which he affirmed that wreck of the\r\nsea had been the hereditary rights of his ancestors from the accession\r\nof William the Conqueror. The jury acknowledged the title of Sir William\r\nin each instance, ordaining that the same markets, fairs, etc., should\r\ncontinue to be held or exercised as aforetime. It would appear that\r\nthe market took place each week on Wednesday, the chief merchandise\r\noffered for sale being most likely cattle and smallware. There are now\r\nno remnants of the market, which must at one era have been an assembly\r\nof no mean importance, beyond the names of the market-house and the\r\nmarket-field. The cross and stocks have also succumbed to the lapse of\r\nyears, the latter being a matter of tradition only, with all, even to the\r\noldest inhabitant.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 a petition was presented to the House of Parliament, setting\r\nforth that within the manor of Layton and parishes of Poulton and\r\nBispham there was situated an extensive tract of land containing about\r\n2,000 acres, called Layton Hawes, and begging on the part of those\r\nconcerned, for permission to enclose the whole of the common. The\r\ndocument states “that Fleetwood Hesketh, Esquire, is Lord of the Manor\r\nof Layton aforesaid; and Edmund Starkie, Esquire, is Impropriator of\r\nthe Great Tythes arising within that part of the Township of Marton\r\ncalled Great Marton, within the said Manor of Layton and Parish of\r\nPoulton, and of One Moiety of the Great Tythes arising in that part of\r\nthe Township of Bispham called Great Bispham, within the said Manor and\r\nParish of Bispham; and Thomas Cross, Esquire, and others, his partners,\r\nare proprietors of the other Moiety of the Great Tythes arising within\r\nGreat Bispham aforesaid; and Ashton Werden, Clerk, present Incumbent\r\nof the Parish Church of Bispham aforesaid, and his Successors for\r\nthe time being, of the Great Tythes, arising within the Township of\r\nLayton-with-Warbreck, within the said Manor and Parish of Bispham. Also\r\nthat the said Fleetwood Hesketh, Thomas Clifton, and other Owners and\r\nProprietors of divers ancient Farms, situate within the Manor of Layton,\r\nand the towns of Great Marton, Little Marton, Black Pool, and Bispham,\r\nhave an exclusive Right to turn and depasture their Beasts, Sheep, and\r\nother Commovable Cattle, in and upon the said Waste or Common, called\r\nLayton Hawes, at all Times of the Year; and the Parties interested are\r\nwilling and desirous that the said Waste or Common should be inclosed,\r\nallotted and divided, and therefore pray that the said Waste or Common\r\ncalled Layton Hawes, lying within the Manor of Layton, may be divided,\r\nset out, and allotted by Commissioners, to be appointed for that purpose\r\nand their Successors, in such manner, and subject to such rules, orders,\r\nregulations, and directions, as may be thought necessary.” Leave to carry\r\nout the object contained in the prayer was granted to the petitioners,\r\nand within a comparatively short time the work of dividing and\r\napportioning the soil accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the township of Layton-with-Warbreck being now\r\nabsorbed in the borough of Blackpool, to which the ensuing chapter will\r\nbe devoted, there is little further to notice beyond the ancient seats of\r\nthe families of Rigby and Veale. Layton Hall was probably the residence\r\nof the Butlers, of Layton, previous to the opening of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when it was sold to Edward Rigby, of Burgh; at least that\r\ngentleman was the first of the Rigbys whose _Inq. post mortem_ disclosed\r\nthat he held possessions in Layton. The Hall remained in the ownership\r\nand tenancy of the Rigbys until the lifetime of Sir Alexander Rigby, who\r\nmarried Alice, the daughter of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, and died about\r\n1700.[126] The original edifice, which was taken down and a farm-house\r\nerected on the site about one century ago, was a massive gabled building.\r\nAt the bottom of the main staircase was a gate, or grating, of iron, the\r\nwhole of the interior of the Hall being fitted with oak panels, etc., in\r\na very antique style.\r\n\r\nWhinney Heys was held by the Veales from the time of Francis Veale,\r\nliving in 1570, until the death of John Veale, about two hundred years\r\nlater, when it passed to Edward Fleetwood, of Rossall Hall, who had\r\nmarried the sister and heiress of John Veale.[127] The Hall of Whinney\r\nHeys was embosomed in trees and presented nothing of special moment to\r\nthe eye, being simply a large rough-cast country building of an early\r\ntype. It was partially taken down many years since and converted to\r\nfarming uses.\r\n\r\n“The village affords,” says Mr. Thornber,[128] “an example of\r\ncovetousness seldom equalled. John Bailey, better known by the name of\r\nthe Layton miser, resided in a cottage near the market-house. His habits\r\nwere most frugal, enduring hunger and privation to hoard up his beloved\r\npelf. Once, during every summer, his store was exposed to the beams of\r\nthe sun, to undergo purification, and he might be seen, on that occasion,\r\nwith a loaded gun, seated in the midst of his treasure, guarding it with\r\nthe eyes of Argus, from the passing intruder. Notwithstanding all this\r\nvigilance, upwards of £700 was stolen from his hoard; and this ignorant\r\nold man journeyed to some distance to consult the wise man in order to\r\nregain it; his manœuvre to avoid the income-tax also failed, for although\r\nhe converted his landed property into guineas, concealing them in his\r\nhouse, and then pleaded that he possessed no _income_, but a _capital_\r\nonly, the law compelled him to pay his due proportion. In the midst of\r\nhis savings, death smote this wretched being, and even then his ruling\r\npassion was strong in the very agony of departing nature. His gold watch,\r\nthe only portion of his property which remained unbequeathed, hung within\r\nhis reach; his greedy eye was riveted upon it; no he could not part with\r\nthat dear treasure—and, with an expiring effort, he snatched it from\r\nthe head of his bed, and it remained clenched in his hand and convulsed\r\nfingers long after warmth had forsaken his frame. Alas! His hidden store,\r\nall in gold, weighing 65lb, was discovered at the close of a tedious\r\nsearch, in a walled up window, to which the miser had had access from\r\nwithout, and was carried home in a malt sack, a purse not often used for\r\nsuch a purpose.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBLACKPOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackpool is situated in the township of Layton-with-Warbreck, and\r\noccupies a station on the west coast, about midway between the estuaries\r\nof the rivers Ribble and Wyre. The watering-place of to-day with its\r\nnoble promenade, elegant piers, handsome hotels, and princely terraces,\r\nforms a wonderful and pleasing contrast to the meagre group of thatched\r\ncabins which once reared their lowly heads near the peaty pool, whose\r\ndark waters gave rise to the name of the town. This pool, which was\r\nlocated at the south end of Blackpool, is stated to have been half a mile\r\nin breadth, and was due to the accumulation of black, or more correctly\r\nspeaking, chocolate-coloured waters,[129] from Marton Mere and the turf\r\nfields composing the swampy region usually designated the “Moss.” It\r\nremained until the supplies were cut off by diverting their currents\r\ntowards other and more convenient outlets, when its contents gradually\r\ndecreased, finally leaving no trace of their former site beyond a small\r\nstreamlet, which now discharges itself with the flows of Spendike into\r\nthe sea, opposite the point where the Lytham Road branches from the\r\npromenade. The principal portion of the town stands a little removed from\r\nthe edge of a long line of cliffs, whose altitude, trifling at first,\r\nconsiderably increases as they travel northwards; and from that broad\r\nrange of frontage streets and houses in compact masses run backwards\r\ntowards the country, covering an annually extending area.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest and most interesting relics of antiquity is still\r\npreserved in the Fox Hall Hotel, or Vaux Hall, as it is sometimes, but we\r\nopine, for reasons stated hereafter, incorrectly written, although its\r\nname, site, and long cobble wall are nearly the only mementoes that time\r\nand change have failed to remove. It was here in the reign of Charles\r\nII. that Edward, the son of the gallant and loyal Sir Thomas Tyldesley\r\nwho was slain at the battle of Wigan-lane in 1651, having been led to\r\nexpect a grant of the lands of Layton Hawes, or Heys Side, from the king,\r\nafter the restoration, in return for his own and his father’s staunch\r\nadherence to the royal cause, built a small sequestered residence as a\r\nsummer retreat for his family. Modest and unpretending as the dimensions\r\nappear to have been, no doubt at that time it was regarded as a stately\r\nmansion, and looked upon with becoming respect and admiration by the\r\ninhabitants of the few clay-built and rush-roofed huts which were\r\nscattered around it. The house itself was a three gabled structure with\r\na species of tower, affording an extensive survey over the neighbouring\r\ncountry; there were four or five rooms on each story, and one wing of\r\nthe building was fitted up and used as a chapel, the officiating priest\r\nbeing most probably the Rev. W. Westby, the “W. W.” of the diary kept by\r\nThomas Tyldesley during the years he resided there. The chapel portion\r\nof the old house was at a later period, when the remainder, after\r\nexperiencing various fortunes, had fallen into decay, converted into a\r\ncottage. Over the chief entrance Edward had inscribed the words—“Seris\r\nfactura Nepotibus,” the motto of an order of Knighthood, called the Royal\r\nOak, which Charles II. contemplated establishing when first he regained\r\nhis throne, but afterwards for certain reasons[130] altered his mind,\r\nas he also appears to have done in regard to the Hawes property, for it\r\nnever passed into the possession of the Tyldesleys by royal favour, or\r\nin any other way. A fox secured by a chain was allowed to ramble for\r\na short distance in front of the doorway, and whether the presence of\r\nthat animal, together with the use of the Hall as a hunting seat, as\r\nwell as a summer retreat, originated its name, or its first title was\r\nVaux, and by an easy and simple process of change became altered to\r\nFox, the reader must decide for himself; but after he has perused the\r\nfollowing extract from the Tyldesley Diary, in which the priest already\r\nmentioned is alluded to as “W. W.”, he will, we venture to think, have\r\nlittle difficulty in concluding that the cognomen Vaux is merely a modern\r\nadaptation when applied to this Hall:—\r\n\r\n  “May 14, 1712.—Left Lanʳ about ffive; pᵈ 3d. ffor a shooe at\r\n  Thurnham Cocking, having lost one. Thence to Great Singleton\r\n  to prayers, and ffrom thence to Litham to dinʳ, ffound Mr.\r\n  Blackborne, of Orford; stayed there 11 at night. Soe to ffox\r\n  hall. Gave W: W: 1s.”\r\n\r\nEdward Tyldesley surrounded the Hall with a high and massive wall of\r\ncobble stones, strongly cemented together, as a protection very needful\r\nin those times of turmoil and persecution. A large portion of the wall\r\nstill exists in an almost perfect state of preservation, notwithstanding\r\nthe fierce gales and boisterous tides that have, at intervals, battered\r\nagainst it for more than two centuries. This, with the additional\r\nsafeguards that nature had provided by means of the broad sea to the\r\nfront, a small stream running over swampy, almost impassable, ground to\r\nthe south, and a pool[131] under its east side, rendered the house a\r\nsecure asylum for those who were constrained to practise\r\n\r\n  “The better part of valour,”\r\n\r\nand remove themselves for a season from the eyes of the world and their\r\nenemies. Over the high gateway at the south end of the enclosure he\r\nplaced a stone carved with the crest of the Tyldesley family—a pelican\r\nfeeding its young—encircled by the loyal and patriotic motto—“Tantum\r\nvalet amor regis et patriæ”: for long the roughly finished piece of\r\ncarving was visible in the wall of an outbuilding, from which, however,\r\nit has recently been removed. Fox Hall was not without its plot of garden\r\nground, a considerable space, being devoted to the useful products, was\r\nknown as the kitchen garden, whilst another space was devoted to an\r\napiary, and flowers must be supposed to have been an accompanyment of\r\nbees. It also boasted a bowling green and an ancient fig tree.\r\n\r\nThomas, the son of Edward Tyldesley, born in 1657, succeeded to the\r\nfamily estates on the death of his father, and later married, as his\r\nsecond wife, Mary, sister and co-heiress, with Elizabeth Colley, of Sir\r\nAlexander Rigby, knt., of Layton Hall, High-sheriff of the county of\r\nLancashire in 1691, whose father had erected a monument to the memory of\r\nSir Thomas Tyldesley near the spot where he was slain.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1690, when the dethroned monarch James II. invaded\r\nIreland in the hope of regaining his crown, Thomas Tyldesley prepared\r\na secret chamber for his reception in the interior of the Hall. The\r\ncloset or hiding-place was afterwards known as the King’s Cupboard. The\r\nPretender, also, was reported to have been concealed for some time within\r\nFox Hall, and although it is certain that this aspirant to the British\r\nthrone was never within its friendly walls, still the secret recesses,\r\ncalled “priests’ holes,” with which it appears to have been liberally\r\nprovided, formed excellent refuges for the clergy and other members of\r\nthe Romish Church, who on the slightest alarm were enclosed therein, and\r\nso secluded from the prying eyes of their hostile countrymen until the\r\ndanger had passed. These latter incidents did not take place until after\r\nthe decease of Thomas Tyldesley, who died in 1715, shortly before the\r\noutbreak of the rebellion, and was buried at Churchtown, near Garstang.\r\nHis son Edward, who succeeded him, was arrested for taking part with\r\nthe rebels, and escaped conviction and punishment only by the mercy or\r\nsympathy of the jury, who after returning their verdict of acquittal\r\nwere severely censured by the presiding judge for their incompetency and\r\ndisaffection. Edward Tyldesley died in 1725.[132] At what date Fox Hall\r\npassed out of the hands of the Tyldesleys, it is impossible to trace, but\r\nit is doubtful whether the Edward here named ever resided there, as he is\r\nalways described as of Myerscough Lodge, another seat of the family. Mary\r\nTyldesley, the widow of his father, whom it will be remembered he married\r\nas his second wife, was living there as owner in 1720, and from that\r\ncircumstance we must infer that the Blackpool house was bequeathed to\r\nher by her husband Thomas Tyldesley, and that the other portion only of\r\nthe estates fell to Edward, the son of his first marriage and his heir.\r\nPoverty seems to have overtaken the family with rapid strides; their\r\ndifferent lands and residences were either mortgaged or sold, and whether\r\nFox Hall descended to the children of Mary Tyldesley, or returned again\r\ninto the more direct line, it is certain that not many years after the\r\ndeath of Thomas Tyldesley it had ceased to be one of their possessions.\r\n\r\nThus, the annals of the founders of this solitary mansion carry us back\r\nto the period between 1660 and 1685, that is from the restoration to the\r\ndeath of Charles II., but certain entries in the register of Bispham\r\nchurch show that there must have been dwellings and a population, however\r\nthinly scattered, on the soil anterior to that period, sometime during\r\nthe sixteenth century, and it was doubtless the descendants of these\r\npeople who inhabited the neighbourhood when Edward Tyldesley appeared\r\nupon the scene and erected Fox Hall. The primitive structures forming the\r\nhabitations of these aborigines were built of clay, roughly plastered\r\non to wattles, and thatched with rushes more frequently than straw, the\r\nwhole fabric being supported on crooks driven into the ground. About the\r\nepoch of Thomas Tyldesley drainage and cultivation began to render the\r\naspect of the country more inviting, and fresh families were tempted to\r\ncome down to the coast and rear their humble abodes under the wing of\r\nthe great mansion, so that after a while a small hamlet of clustering\r\nhuts was formed. It is more than probable that the morals and conduct\r\nof the dwellers in these huts were influenced in some way or other by\r\nthe sojourners at the Hall, but whether for good or evil we are unable\r\nto say, as the time is now so hopelessly remote and no records of their\r\nhabits and doings are extant, so that in the absence of any proof to the\r\ncontrary, it is only fair and charitable to surmise that their lives were\r\nas simple as their surroundings.\r\n\r\nWhether the Tyldesleys were induced to locate themselves on this spot\r\nsolely by a prospect of possessing some of the territory around, or were\r\nactuated also by a desire to have a retreat far removed from the scenes\r\nof disturbance with which the different factions were constantly vexing\r\nthe land, is a matter of little importance, but to their presence it was\r\ndue that the natural beauties of Blackpool were brought before the people\r\nat an early date. There can be no doubt that the priests and others,\r\nwho had fled to the Hall as a harbour of refuge, would, on returning\r\nto their own districts, circulate glowing and eulogistic accounts of\r\nthe place they had been visiting—of the glorious beauty of the sea, the\r\nendless stretch of level sands, and the bracing purity of the breeze. In\r\nsuch manner a desire would readily be implanted in the bosoms of their\r\nauditory to become personally acquainted with the new land, which had\r\ncreated such a deep and favourable impression on the minds of men, whose\r\npositions and education warranted the genuineness of their statements and\r\nenhanced the value of their opinions. There is one other circumstance\r\nworthy to be mentioned as having in all likelihood aided considerably in\r\nbringing the place into notice, and that is an annual race meeting, held\r\nfor long on Layton Hawes. The proximity of the site to the residences of\r\nso many families of wealth and distinction, as the Allens of Rossall, the\r\nWestbys of Burn Hall, the Rigbys of Layton Hall, the Veales of Whinney\r\nHeys, the Heskeths of Mains, the Cliftons of Lytham, and the Tyldesleys\r\nof Blackpool, must have rendered the assembly one of no mean importance,\r\nand we may picture in our minds the gay and brilliant scene presented\r\neach year on the outskirts of the present town, when our ancestors in\r\ntheir antique and many-hued costumes congregated to witness the contests\r\nof their favourite steeds, and the level turf echoed to the fleet hoofs\r\nof the horses as the varied colours of their riders flashed round the\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nAlthough these incidents must have greatly tended to give publicity to\r\nBlackpool, its early advances towards popularity were dilatory, but this\r\nis to be attributed rather to the unsettled state of the times than to\r\na tardy appreciation of its advantages by those who had enjoyed them or\r\nheard them described. During the reign of George I., 1714-1727, a mere\r\nsprinkling of visitors seems to have been attracted each summer to the\r\nhamlet, but a few years later, about 1735, they had become sufficiently\r\nnumerous to induce one Ethart à Whiteside to prepare a cottage specially\r\nfor their reception and entertainment. Common report whispers that he was\r\nfurther prompted to the venture by being the fortunate possessor of a\r\nwife whose skill in cookery far excelled that of any of her neighbours,\r\nbut be that as it may, whether he espoused the Welsh maiden because her\r\nculinary accomplishments were an additional recommendation to him in\r\nthe sphere in which he had embarked, or whether the lodging house was a\r\ncherished dream only converted into a reality on their discovery after\r\nmarriage, one thing is certain, his speculation prospered, and at the end\r\nof fifty years he retired on what at that era was considered a fortune.\r\nThe house in which he had laboured for half a century was situated in\r\nthe fields now occupied by General Street and the neighbouring houses,\r\non the site of what not long ago was a ladies’ school; in appearance,\r\nit was a very ordinary cottage with the usual straw thatch, somewhat\r\noblong in form and possessing few attractions to tempt the stranger to\r\nprolong his stay, but in spite of all its disadvantages, the fascination\r\nof the sea and the novelty of the surroundings filled it with guests\r\nsummer after summer. This dwelling claims the honour of having been the\r\nfirst ever fitted up and arranged as a lodging house in Blackpool. On\r\nthe retirement of Whiteside, who a few years afterwards died at Layton,\r\nit passed into the hands of a noted aboriginal, called Tom the Cobbler,\r\nwho appears to have held more ambitious views than his predecessor, and\r\nconverted the cottage into an inn, or at least embellished its exterior\r\nwith a rude lettered sign, and procured a license to supply exciseable\r\ncommodities within. Those who had been accustomed to the scrupulous care\r\nand cleanliness of Whiteside and his thrifty wife, must have experienced\r\na considerable shock from the eccentricities of the new proprietor;\r\neach day at the dinner hour he entered in working costume amongst the\r\nassembled guests, and with grimy fingers produced from the depths of\r\nhis well rosined apron the allotted portion of bread for each. How\r\nthis peculiarity was appreciated by his visitors there are no means of\r\nascertaining, but as his dwelling did not develope in the course of years\r\ninto a modern and commodious hotel like the other licensed houses which\r\nsprang up about that time and a little later, we are inclined to fear\r\nthat some internal mismanagement caused its collapse.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 the whole hamlet comprised no more than twenty-eight houses, or\r\nmore correctly speaking hovels, for, with the exception of four that had\r\nbeen raised to the dignity of slate roofs and a small inn on the site of\r\nthe present Clifton Arms Hotel, they were little if any better. These\r\nwere scattered widely apart along the beach, and one of them standing on\r\nthe ground now occupied by the Lane Ends Hotel, and adjoining a small\r\nblacksmith’s shed, was a favourite resort of visitors in search of\r\nrefreshment. Turf stacks fronted almost every door, and the refuse of\r\nthe household was either carelessly thrown forth or else accumulated\r\nin putrifying heaps by the sides of the huts, so that nothing but their\r\nisolated situations and the constant currents of pure air from the sea\r\nsweeping over and around them could possibly have prevented the outbreak\r\nof some infectious and fatal disorder.\r\n\r\nBonny’s Hotel, then known as old Margery’s, and standing in the fields\r\nto the south, some distance from the sea, sprang up a little anterior to\r\nthis time and received its share of patronage; later it was converted\r\ninto a boys’ school and during recent years has been divided into\r\ncottages, etc. The Gynn House, erected northwards near the extremity or\r\napex of a deep and wide fissure in the cliffs, formed another popular\r\nhaunt during the season; the landlord at that hostel created much\r\namusement by his oddities, and especially by his quaint method of casting\r\nup the reckoning on a horse-block in front of the door and speeding\r\nthe “parting guest” with—“and Sir, remember the servants.” A true and\r\nremarkable anecdote is related about the old inn; sometime during the\r\nsummer of 1833 a sudden and terrific storm burst over the western coast\r\nof this island, many vessels were lost and the shore off Blackpool was\r\nstrewn with the battered fragments of unfortunate ships, which had either\r\nfoundered in the deep or been dashed to pieces as they lay helplessly\r\nstranded on the outlying sandbanks. In the night as the gale raged\r\nwith its utmost fury, a Scotch sloop was beating off the coast, vainly\r\nendeavouring to battle with the hurricane, and driven by the force of\r\nwind and wave nearer and nearer to the precipitous cliffs. When all hope\r\nhad been abandoned and destruction seemed inevitable, some thoughtful\r\nperson placed a lighted candle in the window of the Gynn House; guided\r\nby this faint glimmer, the vessel passed safely up the creek, and the\r\nexhausted sailors were rescued from a dreadful death. Next morning a sad\r\nand harrowing scene presented itself along the coast; no less than eleven\r\nvessels were lying within a short distance of each other, with their torn\r\nrigging and shattered spars hanging from their sides; brigs, sloops, and\r\nschooners, the short but fearful gale had left little of them beyond\r\ntheir damaged hulls. Nor were these the only victims of the storm, for\r\nas the tide receded to its lowest the masts of two others rose above the\r\nsurface of the water; and during the next few days three large ships\r\ndrifted past the town in an apparently waterlogged condition.\r\n\r\nAbout that date, 1769, several heaps of mortar and other building\r\nmaterials, lying on the road which separated the front of the village\r\nfrom the edge of the cliffs, showed that more were anxious to follow in\r\nthe footsteps of Whiteside and his earlier imitators.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the class of people who visited Blackpool at\r\nthat period from the charges made at Bonny’s Hotel and the Gynn, the two\r\nprincipal inns, for board and lodging; at the latter eightpence per day\r\nsatisfied the modest demands of the host, while at the former the sum\r\nof tenpence was exacted, with a view no doubt of upholding its superior\r\nclaims to respectability. In drawing our conclusions from these facts\r\nwe must bear in mind that a shilling in those days represented much\r\ngreater value than it does at present, so that the charges may not have\r\nbeen really so inadequate as they now appear. The village contained\r\nneither shop nor store where the necessaries or luxuries of life, if such\r\nthings were ever dreamt of by the people, could be purchased, and large\r\nquantities of provisions had to be laid in at one time. Occasionally a\r\nsudden and unexpected influx of visitors occurred inopportunely, when\r\nthe larder was low, and as a consequence the hungry guests were forced\r\nto wait, temporising with their appetites as best they could, until a\r\njourney had been made to Poulton and fresh supplies procured.\r\n\r\nTen years later the hamlet had grown somewhat in size, and the annually\r\nincreasing numbers who flocked to its shores showed that its popularity\r\nwas steadily gaining ground. Intercourse with the world beyond their own\r\nlimited circle seems, however, to have had anything but an elevating or\r\ncivilising effect upon the inhabitants, for we find amongst them at that\r\ntime a band of professed atheists, whose blasphemous conduct called forth\r\nno rebuke or opposition from the rest, but was quietly tolerated, if not\r\nindeed approved. Each fortnight during the summer fairs were held on\r\nthe Sabbath to provide refreshment and amusement for the visitors, who\r\ncame in crowds to witness the magnificence of the highest spring tides.\r\nThese gatherings usually terminated in disgraceful scenes of revelry\r\nand debauchery. Smuggling was carried on between the coast opposite the\r\nStar-hills and the Isle of Man, but never to a great extent or for any\r\nlengthened period. These huge mounds of sand, much more numerous than\r\nin our day, formed excellent store-houses for the contraband goods,\r\ngenerally spirits, which were packed in hampers, and so overlaid with\r\nfish that their presence was never even suspected. The illicit cargoes\r\nwere brought across the channel in trading vessels, from which they\r\nwere landed by means of light open boats, and at once secreted in the\r\nmanner just indicated, until a suitable opportunity occurred for their\r\nremoval to one of the neighbouring towns. The success attending these\r\nventures induced the smugglers to construct a sloop of their own, with\r\nthe intention of prosecuting so profitable a trade on a larger scale,\r\nbut information of their proceedings having been conveyed by some one to\r\nofficial quarters, a detachment of soldiers was promptly despatched to\r\nput an end to the nefarious practices. So thoroughly did these men effect\r\ntheir purpose, that, although no capture is recorded as having taken\r\nplace, the whole band was dispersed, and from that date no more offences\r\nof this character have been known on the coast.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 the houses of Blackpool had increased to about thirty-five, and\r\nthese were arranged in an irregular line along the edge of the cliffs;\r\nthe intervals between the habitations being with few exceptions so\r\nwide that this small number stretched out from north to south, over a\r\ndistance of quite a mile. One group of six was especially remarkable as\r\npresenting a more respectable and modern exterior than any of the others,\r\nmost of which still retained a great deal of their original defective\r\nappearances, as though their owners were unwilling or unable to adapt\r\nthemselves and their abodes to the improved state of things springing up\r\naround them. The company during the busiest part of the season amounted\r\nto about four hundred persons, and a news-room had been established for\r\ntheir use in the small cottage, before mentioned, on the site of the\r\nLane Ends Hotel, the smith’s shop adjoining having been converted into a\r\ncoffee-room and kitchen, at which a public dinner was prepared each day\r\nduring the summer, and served at a dining-room erected across the way.\r\nThere were now four additional inns in the village, named respectively,\r\nBailey’s, Forshaw’s, Hull’s, and the Yorkshire House. The first of\r\nthese had sprung up on the cliffs towards the north, and was kept by an\r\nancestor of its present proprietor; the second was the nucleus from\r\nwhich has grown the Clifton Arms Hotel, whilst the third stood on the\r\nsite of the Royal Hotel. The roads leading to the hamlet were in such an\r\nunfinished state that after heavy falls of rain they could be travelled\r\nonly with the greatest difficulty, and often with considerable danger\r\nboth to the vehicle and its occupants; so that under these circumstances\r\nmost people deemed it more prudent and expedient to perform the journey\r\non horseback, some of them in the pillion fashion usual at that era. In\r\nan earlier part of this chapter we spoke of the troubled state of the\r\ntimes and the unsettled and harassed condition of the people as being\r\nthe most probable causes why Blackpool was so long neglected by many\r\nwho must have been well cognisant of its beauties in the days of the\r\nTyldesleys, and with equal probability may we now conjecture that the\r\ndilapidated and frequently unsafe state of the highways had a serious\r\neffect in preventing numbers from visiting the place at this period.\r\nRegarding the matter from another point of view, we are led to infer\r\nthat the four hundred composing the company of 1788, were people who,\r\neither in search of health or recreation, had willingly undergone the\r\ndiscomforts of a dreary and sometimes hazardous journey in order to\r\nmake but a brief sojourn by the shores of Blackpool. Here, then, there\r\nis evidence of the great estimation in which the place was held at that\r\nearly date by the dwellers in the inland towns, and of the rapidity with\r\nwhich its good fame was increasing and extending throughout a large\r\nsection of the county. As may be naturally supposed, the large influxes\r\nof visitors and their turn-outs during the height of the season very much\r\novertaxed the accommodation provided for them by the inhabitants, but\r\nthat difficulty was easily surmounted by turning the horses loose into a\r\nfield until their services were again required, whilst the surplus health\r\nor pleasure-seekers were lodged in barns or any outbuildings sufficiently\r\nprotected from the weather. The village possessed two bowling greens of\r\ndiminutive size, one of which occupied the land at the south-west corner\r\nof Lytham Street, whilst the other was in connection with the Yorkshire\r\nHouse, afterwards the York Hotel, and since purchased by a company of\r\ngentlemen, who razed it to the ground in order to erect more suitable\r\nbuildings on the site. There was also a theatre, if that will bear the\r\nname which during nine months of the year existed under the more modest\r\ntitle of a barn; rows of benches were placed one behind another, and\r\nseparated into a front and back division, designated respectively pit and\r\ngallery. This house is said to have been capable of holding six pounds,\r\nthe prices of admission being one and two shillings. At that period\r\nbathing vans were scarce, the majority of bathers making use of boxes,\r\nwhich were placed for their convenience along the shore, and as the mode\r\nin which they secured privacy and a proper separation of the sexes during\r\nindulgence in this pastime was both ingenious and entertaining, we will\r\ngive a brief sketch of their arrangements. At a certain hour each day,\r\nvarying according to the changes of the tide, a bell was rung when the\r\nwater had risen almost to its highest. On hearing the signal, the whole\r\nof the gentlemen, however agreeably occupied, were compelled, under a\r\npenalty of one bottle of wine for each offence, to vacate the shore and\r\nbetake themselves to their several hotels or apartments, whilst the\r\nladies, after sufficient time had elapsed for any stray member of the\r\nsterner sex to get safely and securely housed, emerged singly or in small\r\ngroups from the different doorways, and, hurrying down to the edge of the\r\nsea, quickly threw off their loose bathing robes, and in a moment were\r\nsporting amid the waves like a colony of nereids or mermaids. When these\r\nhad finished their revels and duly retired to their homes, the bell rang\r\na second time, and the males, released from _durance vile_, made their\r\nway to the beach, and were not long in following the example of their\r\nfair predecessors.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutton, in his small pamphlet descriptive of Blackpool in 1788,\r\nsays:—“The tables here are well supplied; if I say too well for the price\r\nI may please the innkeepers, but not their guests. Shrimps are plentiful;\r\nfive or six people make it their business to catch them at low water,\r\nand produce several gallons a day, which satisfy all but the catchers.\r\nThey excel in cooking, nor is it surprising, for forty pounds and her\r\nmaintenance is given to a cook for the season only. Though salt water\r\nis brought in plenty to their very doors, yet this is not the case with\r\nfresh. The place yields only one spring for family use; and the water is\r\ncarried by some half a mile, but is well worth carrying, for I thought it\r\nthe most pleasant I ever tasted.”\r\n\r\nThe prices at the inns and boarding-houses had risen as the\r\naccommodation they offered had improved in quality and increased in\r\nextent, so that it was no longer possible to subsist on the daily\r\nexpenditure of a few pence as in former times. In hotels of the first\r\nclass 3s. 4d. per day, exclusive of liquors, was the charge for board and\r\nlodging; dinner and supper being charged 1s. each to the casual visitor,\r\nand tea or breakfast 8d. In those of the second-class and some of the\r\nlodging-houses, 2s. 6d. per day covered everything with the exception\r\nof tea, coffee, sugar, and liquors; whilst the smaller lodging-houses,\r\ngenerally crowded with visitors who were either willing or compelled to\r\ncontent themselves with the more frugal fare provided, charged only 1s.\r\n6d. per day for each guest.\r\n\r\nA promenade, six yards wide, carpeted with grass and separated from\r\nthe road by white wooden railings, ran along the verge of the sea\r\nbank for a distance of two hundred yards, and was ornamented at one\r\nend with an alcove, whilst the other terminated abruptly at a rough\r\nclayey excavation, afterwards used as a brick croft. “Here,” says the\r\ntopographer already quoted, “is a full display of beauty and of fashion.\r\nHere the eye faithful to its trust, conveys intelligence from the heart\r\nof one sex to that of the other; gentle tumults rise in the breast;\r\nintercourse opens in tender language; the softer passions are called\r\ninto action; Hymen approaches, kindles his torch, and cements that union\r\nwhich continues for life. Here may be seen folly flushed with money,\r\nshoe-strings, and a phæton and four. Keen envy sparkles in the eye at the\r\ndisplay of a new bonnet. The heiress of eighteen trimmed in black, and a\r\nhundred thousand pounds, plentifully squanders her looks of disdain, or\r\nthe stale _Belle_, who has outstood her market, offers her fading charms\r\nupon easy terms.”\r\n\r\nThis parade was extended some years later by means of a bridge thrown\r\nfrom its south extremity over the road leading down to the shore, and\r\non to the cliffs of the opposite side. Riding or walking, for those who\r\nwere not fortunate enough to possess a horse or equipage, on the sands\r\nor promenade, and excursions into the country as far as the “Number 3\r\nHotel,” where many of the company amused themselves with drinking “fine\r\nale,” were the favourite pastimes during the day, varied, however, with\r\nan occasional practice at the butts for bow and arrow shooting, the\r\ndiurnal bathe, and contests on the bowling greens, to which we have\r\nalready alluded; in the evening or during unfavourable weather cards\r\nand backgammon, or the theatre, were the means with which the visitors\r\nbeguiled the wearisomeness of the quiet hours. The “Number 3 Hotel”\r\nabove-mentioned stood behind the present building bearing that name, at\r\nthe corner of the Layton and Marton roads.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutton relates several somewhat startling instances of the curative\r\nproperties of the sea at Blackpool; amongst them that of a man, by trade\r\na shoemaker and a resident of Lancaster, who having become, through some\r\nunexplained cause, totally blind, visited this watering-place for six\r\nweeks, during which he drank large quantities of the marine element,\r\ndaily bathing his eyes in the same, and at the end of that time had so\r\nfar recovered his sight that he could readily distinguish objects at a\r\ndistance of two miles. Another case was that of a gentleman, who, having\r\nbeen seized with a paralytic attack, which deprived him of the use of one\r\nside, was ordered by his physician to Bath, but finding, after a fair\r\ntrial, that he derived no benefit from the combined action of its climate\r\nand waters, he determined to travel northwards and make a short sojourn\r\nat Blackpool. Whilst there the invalid was daily carried into and out of\r\nthe sea, and even after this process had been only twice repeated he had\r\nlost the violent pains in his joints, recovered his sleep, and in some\r\nconsiderable degree the muscular power of the affected side, but of his\r\nfurther progress there is no account.\r\n\r\nThe following lines, written by a visitor a few years after the incidents\r\nwe have just narrated, also show in what great estimation the climate and\r\nsea of the village were held as remedial and invigorating agents:—\r\n\r\n  “Of all the gay places of public resort,\r\n  At Chatham, or Scarbro’, at Bath, or at Court,\r\n  There’s none like sweet Blackpool, of which I can boast,\r\n  So charming the sands, so healthful the coast;—\r\n  Rheumatics, scorbutics, and scrofulous kind,\r\n  Hysterics and vapours, disorders of mind,\r\n  By drinking and bathing you’re made quite anew,\r\n  As thousands have proved and know to be true.”\r\n\r\nAt this time Blackpool was not only without a church, but in the\r\nwhole place there was no room where the inhabitants or visitors were\r\naccustomed to assemble together for divine worship, and it was not until\r\n1821 that the sacred edifice of St. John was completed and opened. In\r\n1789 a subscription was started for the purpose of erecting a church, but\r\nwas soon closed for want of support, barely one hundred pounds having\r\nbeen promised. Some years later a large room at one of the hotels was\r\nused as a meeting house on each Sabbath, the officiating ministers being\r\nobtained alternately from Bispham and Poulton, and occasionally from\r\namongst the visitors themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1799, the poorer inhabitants of Blackpool and its neighbourhood\r\nsuffered severely, in common with others, from a failure in the grain\r\nand potato harvests. They, like most members of the working classes\r\nat that date, relied almost entirely upon good and plentiful crops of\r\nthese important articles of diet, to furnish them with the means of\r\nsustenance throughout the year, so that a small yield, raising the prices\r\nexorbitantly, became a matter of serious moment to them, and in most\r\ninstances, meant little less than ruin or starvation. After the cold and\r\ninclement approach of winter had banished the last stranger from their\r\nmidst, the sums demanded for their accustomed provisions soon swallowed\r\nup the little these people had saved during the summer, and such\r\noccasional trifles as could be earned on the farm lands around whenever\r\nextra services were required. Their condition, deplorable from the first,\r\ngradually grew worse, until, reduced to the deepest distress, they became\r\ndependent for the bare necessaries of existence upon the charity of\r\nthose whose positions, although seriously affected by the failure, were\r\nnot placed in such great jeopardy as their own. After this precarious\r\nand pitiable state of things had lasted some time without any signs of\r\namelioration, and it seemed difficult, if not impossible, to conjecture\r\nhow the remaining months were to be provided for until the returning\r\nseason brought fresh assistance to their homes, an unexpected, and, to\r\nthem, providential occurrence relieved their sufferings. A large vessel\r\nladen with peas was wrecked upon the coast, and the cargo, washing out\r\nof the hold, was strewn upon the beach, supplying them with abundance of\r\nfood until better days shone upon the impoverished village once more.\r\n\r\nReviewing the appearance of Blackpool at the opening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury we find that the whole hamlet was comprised between the Gynn\r\nto the north, and the ruins of the once aristocratic mansion of Fox\r\nHall to the south. The houses with the exception of Bonny’s Hotel and\r\na few scattered cottages, had all been erected along the sea bank, the\r\ngreat bulk lying to the south of Forshaw’s Hotel, and amounting to about\r\nthirty, whilst the space north of that spot as far as Bailey’s Hotel was\r\nonly occupied by one or two dwellings of very humble dimensions. These\r\nwith the Gynn and a few habitations standing south of it on Fumbler’s\r\nHill, made up the number of houses to about forty. A detailed description\r\nof the different erections at that epoch is impossible, but we may state\r\ngenerally that those of modern origin, especially the hotels, although\r\nunpretending externally, were so arranged and provided that the comforts\r\nof the guests were fully insured, and in every way the accommodation\r\nthey offered was immensely superior to any that could have been obtained\r\nthirty years before. The few old buildings that still remained had for\r\nthe most part undergone considerable alterations, and been rendered more\r\nsuitable for the purposes to which they were now devoted.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 the first official census of the inhabitants of the township\r\nof Layton-cum-Warbreck, in which Blackpool is situated, was taken, and\r\nfurnished a total of 473 persons.\r\n\r\nAt that period many people attracted by the rising reputation of the\r\nwatering-place were anxious to invest their capital in the purchase\r\nof land by its shores, and in the erection of houses adapted for the\r\nreception of visitors, but the proprietors of the hotels were the owners\r\nof a large portion of the soil, and fearing that the introduction of\r\nsubstantial and commodious apartments would interfere with the patronage\r\nof their inns, refused to dispose of any part of their lands, or at least\r\nplaced such obstacles in the way of the would-be purchasers that bargains\r\nwere seldom concluded. Had it not been for the energy and foresight\r\ndisplayed by one resident, Mr. H. Banks, who built several cottages and\r\nfitted them up with every convenience and requisite for summer dwellings,\r\nthe prosperity of the village would have received a sudden check and\r\ndoubtless a serious injury, for the provision made would have fallen\r\nfar short of the requirements of an ever-increasing throng of visitors,\r\nand thus repeated disappointments would in the end have led to disgust\r\nand the absence of many when the following seasons rolled round. The\r\nprobability of such a disastrous result seems at length to have been\r\nrealised by the landlords themselves, who discovered that the plan to\r\nenlarge their own business was not to drive visitors away from the place\r\nby limiting the accommodation, but to offer them every inducement to\r\ncome, and to have a sufficiency of houses ready to receive them when\r\nthey had arrived. Under this new and more liberal impression greater\r\nfacilities were offered both to purchasers of land and builders, so that\r\nthe early error into which they had fallen was rectified before any great\r\namount of harm had been done.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1808 the Preston volunteers were on duty at\r\nBlackpool for two weeks, and on the 4th of June celebrated the seventieth\r\nbirthday of His Majesty George III. with many demonstrations of loyalty\r\nand rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe small town now boasted five good class hotels, which, in their\r\norder from north to south, were named Dickson’s, Forshaw’s, Bank’s,\r\nSimpson’s, and the Yorkshire House. Simpson’s, formerly Hull’s, is now\r\nthe Royal Hotel; Bank’s the Land Ends Hotel, and Dickson’s was the\r\none already mentioned as Bailey’s Hotel. “Adjoining Forshaw’s Hotel,”\r\nwrites a gentleman who visited Blackpool about that date; “there are\r\ntwo or three houses of genteel appearance, compared with the many small\r\ncottages leading thence to the street, which is the principal entrance\r\nfrom Preston. There is a promenade with an arbour at the end of it, and\r\nbeyond it nearer to Dixon’s Hotel stands a cottage used as a warm bath.\r\nBeyond Dixon’s there is a public road where two four-wheeled vehicles can\r\npass each other.” At a later period both the road and cottage alluded to\r\nhad succumbed to the unchecked power of the advancing sea; and here it\r\nwill be convenient to mention other and much more serious encroachments\r\nmade by the same element in the course of years now long gone by. We\r\ncan scarcely conceive, when gazing on the indolent deep in its placid\r\nmood, that at any time it could have been possessed with such a demon of\r\nfury and destruction as to swallow up broad fields, acres upon acres,\r\nof the foreland of the Fylde, and in its blind anger sweep away whole\r\nvillages, levelling the house walls and uprooting the very foundations,\r\nso that no trace or vestige of their former existence should remain.\r\nHistory, however, points to a hamlet called Waddum Thorp, which once\r\nstood off the coast of Lytham, fenced from the sea by a broad area of\r\ngreen pasture-land, now known as the Horse-bank; and in more recent years\r\na long range of star-hills ran southward from opposite the Royal Hotel,\r\nprotecting a highway, fields, and four or five cottages from the waves,\r\nwhilst a little further north a boat-house afterwards a shoemaker’s shop,\r\nstood in the centre of a grassy plot, all of which have vanished, and\r\ntheir sites are now covered and obliterated by the sand and pebbles of\r\nthe beach. The several roads, which had been formed at different seasons,\r\nleading over the cliffs to Bispham, were sapped away and destroyed so\r\nrapidly by the incursions of the tide that one more inland and circuitous\r\nwas obliged to be made. On the sands, about three miles to the north of\r\nBlackpool, and so far distant from the shore that it is only visible when\r\nthe water has receded to its lowest ebb, stands the famous Penny-stone.\r\nNear the spot marked by the huge boulder, tradition affirms that in days\r\nof yore there existed a small road-side inn, celebrated far and wide for\r\nits strong ale, which was retailed at one penny per pot, and that whilst\r\nthe thirsty traveller was refreshing himself within, and listening to the\r\ngossip of “mine host,” his horse was tethered to an iron ring fixed in\r\nthis stone. It is stated that documents relating to the ancient hostelry\r\nare still preserved, but as the assertion is unsupported by any evidence\r\nof its veracity, we are prohibited from accepting it as conclusive proof\r\nthat the inn owes its reputed existence to something more substantial\r\nthan the lively imaginations of our ancestors. There is, certainly, one\r\nthing which gives some colouring of possibility, or perhaps, out of\r\nveneration for the antiquity of the tradition, we may advance a step and\r\nsay, reasonable probability, to the story, and that is the historic fact,\r\nthat at no very great distance from the locality there stood a village\r\ncalled Singleton Thorp until 1555, when it was submerged and annihilated\r\nby a sudden and fearful irruption of the sea. Several other boulders\r\nof various sizes are lying about in the neighbourhood of Penny-stone,\r\nbearing the names of Old Mother’s Head, Bear and Staff, Carlin and its\r\nColts, Higher and Lower Jingle, each of which is covered in a greater or\r\nless degree with shells, corallines, anemonies, and other treasures of\r\nthe deep.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 the census of the persons residing in the township before\r\nspecified, was again taken, and amounted to 580, showing an increase of\r\n107 in the number of inhabitants during the preceding ten years.\r\n\r\nThe year 1816 is remarkable as being the first in which public coaches\r\nran regularly between Preston and Blackpool. Previously the chief\r\ncommunication between the village and outlying places had been by means\r\nof pack-horses, carts, and private vehicles, with only occasional coaches.\r\n\r\nThe following description of Blackpool about the year 1816 was furnished\r\nby one of its oldest inhabitants, and, although unavoidably entailing\r\nsome repetition of what has been mentioned before, will, we trust, be\r\ninteresting in itself, as well as useful in confirming the earlier parts\r\nof this history, which have necessarily been compiled from previous\r\nwritings on the subject, and not from the evidence of living witnesses.\r\nThe Gynn House formed the most northerly boundary of the village, and,\r\npassing from that hostelry in a southerly direction, the next dwelling\r\narrived at was Hill-farm, which still exists, and is at present used as\r\na laundry for the Imperial Hotel. A few gabled cottages stood on the\r\neminence called Fumbler’s Hill, near the site of Carleton Terrace:—\r\n\r\n  “Old Ned, and Old Nanny, at Fumbler’s hill,\r\n  Will board you and lodge you e’en just as you will.”[133]\r\n\r\nThese cottages faced the south, as indeed did all the other dwellings at\r\nthat time, with the exception of two or three of the hotels and a few\r\nof the more recent buildings. Bailey’s, or rather Dickson’s, Hotel was\r\nbuilt in blocks of two and three stories, and possessed one bay window.\r\nIt must be remembered that the stories of that day were much lower than\r\nthose with which modern improvements have made us familiar. The next\r\nhotel was Forshaw’s, similar in its construction, but unadorned with even\r\none bay window; between these two large inns were two or three small\r\nthatched cottages. Continuing our survey southwards were Dobson’s Row,\r\nconsisting of several slated cottages, with a circulating library and\r\nbilliard room; and the Lane Ends Hotel, containing three bay-windows,\r\nbuilt, like the others, in parts of two and three stories each. In\r\nLane Ends Street there was a general shop and lodging house combined,\r\ntenanted by a person named Nickson. The Royal, then commonly called the\r\nHoundhill Hotel, comes next in order, and a little distance behind it\r\non the rising ground was a small thatched cottage for the reception of\r\nvisitors. South Beach contained only a few thatched cottages, and on the\r\nsite of the present Wellington Hotel stood a circular pinfold, built of\r\ncobble stone. Considerably west of the present line of frontage, and\r\nsouth of the pinfold, stood two rows of cottages almost on the edge\r\nof the shore; the last of these habitations was washed away or pulled\r\ndown in 1827. Beyond the Yorkshire House and its bowling green was the\r\ndilapidated remains of Fox Hall, part of which had been converted into a\r\nsmall farm-cottage, in the occupation of a person named Wignall. Between\r\nFox Hall and the Yorkshire House, but further removed from the beach,\r\nwas a thatched cottage adjoining a stable, in which Mr. Butcher, of\r\nRaikes Hall, kept two or three racehorses, the field now occupied by the\r\nManchester Hotel being used as an exercise ground for them. Chapel Street\r\ncontained a small farm-house and several cottages, in addition to Bonny’s\r\nHotel, which was situated in a field at the lower end of this lane. In\r\nChurch Street there were only three or four cottages, two of which,\r\nstanding at the south-west corner, were slated and used as shops. A few\r\nother cottages, whose exact sites could not be recalled with accuracy,\r\nwere scattered here and there, but the above will furnish the reader with\r\na fairly correct idea of the extent and appearance of Blackpool about the\r\nyear 1816.\r\n\r\nThe National Schools, at Raikes Hill, were the first provision made for\r\nthe education of the young, and were built in 1817, chiefly through\r\nthe exertions of Mr. Gisborne, then a temporary resident. They consist\r\nof two schools, for boys and girls respectively, with a teachers’ home\r\nbetween. The accommodation has since been considerably enlarged and the\r\ninstitution is now under government inspection.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. John, in course of erection in 1820, was built\r\nwith bricks from a croft situated on the cliffs between Dickson’s Hotel\r\nand the promenade. This place of worship, originally an episcopal chapel\r\nunder Bispham, with a perpetual curacy attached, was consecrated to St.\r\nJohn on July 6th, 1821, by Doctor Law, bishop of Chester. In 1860 a\r\nspecial district was assigned by order of Council to St. John’s, which\r\nin that manner became, under Lord Blanford’s Act, the parish church\r\nof Blackpool. The district thus cut off from the wide parochial area\r\nof Bispham, and constituted a distinct parish for all ecclesiastical\r\npurposes, was included between the Spen Dyke to the south and the central\r\nline of Talbot road to the north. The cost of the sacred edifice, which\r\nconsisted, externally, of a plain brick structure, having a low embattled\r\ntower with pinnacles at the angles, amounted to £1,072, the whole of\r\nwhich was defrayed by voluntary subscriptions, the following individuals\r\nbeing the principal contributors:—\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Dickson       £100\r\n  Mr. Robert Banks    100\r\n   ”  H. Banks        100\r\n   ”  John Hornby     100\r\n  A Friend            100\r\n  Mr. John Forshaw    100\r\n   ”  Robert Hesketh   50\r\n   ”  Fielding         50\r\n   ”  Jonathan Peel    50 10s.\r\n   ”  Bonny            50\r\n\r\nThe interior of the church, plain and neat, was lighted by small lamps\r\nfor evening service during the winter, and contained a font which had\r\nonce belonged to the old Roman Catholic chapel of Singleton; and, a few\r\nyears later, an organ built by Wren, of Manchester. In 1832 this building\r\nwas enlarged by drawing out the east end, into which a plain window was\r\ninserted. The still increasing popularity of the watering place demanded\r\nanother enlargement, which took place in 1847; but it was not until 1851\r\nthat the present chancel, containing a handsome stained glass memorial\r\nwindow to H. Banks, esq., who died in 1847, was added. The window\r\nembraces representations of Christ, the four evangelists, and the infant\r\nJesus, with Joseph and his mother, etc., below which is the following\r\ninscription, surmounted by a coat of arms and motto:—“In memoriam Henrii\r\nBanks de Blackpool patris, et unius ex hujus Ædis patronis, tres sui\r\nliberi hanc fenestram fieri fecerunt.” In 1862 it was thought desirable\r\nthat further improvements should be made, and an open domed roof of\r\npitch-pine was substituted for the old ceiling; the floors of the pews,\r\npreviously covered with asphalt, were boarded; new windows of ground\r\nglass, and a fresh pulpit and reading desk were added to the church;\r\nwhilst a substantial iron railing was erected round the yard in place of\r\nthe cobble wall, which had stood since the opening of the edifice, and\r\nin the same year the burial space was increased by including the plot\r\nof land lying to the west of the church, and now abutting on the houses\r\nof Abingdon Street. Four years later, in 1866, a new and larger tower,\r\nfurnished with a clock and a peal of eight bells, was completed on the\r\nsite of the original one, which had been pulled down for this purpose.\r\nThe interior of the church contains, in addition to the memorial window\r\nalready alluded to, mural tablets _in memoriam_ of Robert Banks, gent.,\r\ndied May 27th, 1838, aged 76 years,—“Ever mindful of the calls of general\r\nduty, he was also a liberal promoter of the erection and endowment of\r\nthis church, and by will bequeathed the sum of £100, for the perpetual\r\nsupport of the national school”; Edward, the son of Henry and Margaret\r\nBanks, died August 8th, 1845, aged 35 years; the Rev. Thomas Banks, “who\r\nwas for thirty-five years incumbent of Singleton church, and an eminent\r\ninstructor of youth,” died 1842, aged 73 years.\r\n\r\n  PERPETUAL CURATES AND VICARS OF ST.

Hesketh, of\r\nNorth Meols; the Vicar of Bispham; J. Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham\r\nHall; and the Raikes Hall Park, Gardens, and Aquarium Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the census returns of the population of Layton-with-Warbreck\r\nshowed a total of 749 persons. On the 19th of July in that year the\r\ncoronation of George IV. was celebrated by the inhabitants and visitors\r\nof Blackpool “in a manner most grateful to every benevolent heart.” A\r\nhandsome subscription, we are told by the gentleman whose words have\r\njust been quoted and who was present on the occasion, was expended in\r\nprocuring one day’s festivity for the poor and needy, the aged and the\r\nyoung. About ten in the morning, the children of the township, amounting\r\nto one hundred and thirty-nine, assembled at the national school, erected\r\nnear the church, where they were each presented with a coronation medal.\r\nAfterwards they paraded the beach, headed by two musicians, and sang the\r\nnational anthem at all the principal houses, followed by ringing cheers;\r\nreturning to the school-house, each child was regaled with a large bun,\r\nand spiced ale and coppers were distributed amongst them. When these\r\nhad been dismissed to their homes, upwards of thirty old people met in\r\nthe same room, where they sat down to an ample and excellent dinner,\r\nat the conclusion of which they each drank the king’s health in a pint\r\nof strong ale. The same kind-hearted ladies who had superintended the\r\nchildren in the procession, waited on this venerable company, and had\r\ntheir generosity rewarded by witnessing the amusing spectacle of three\r\nold women, upwards of seventy, who had probably danced at the coronation\r\nof George III., go through a Scotch reel, which they accomplished in\r\nexcellent style.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of March, 1825, the first stone of a small Independent\r\nchapel, situated at the lower end of Chapel Street, and lying on the\r\nsouth extremity of the village, was laid by the Rev. D. T. Carnson, and\r\non the 6th of the ensuing July it was opened for public worship by the\r\nRev. Dr. Raffles.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1827 is remarkable as having been an exceptionally\r\nprosperous season for Blackpool; vast numbers of carts and other vehicles\r\nladen with their living freights arrived from Blackburn, Burnley, Colne,\r\nPadiham, and the borders of Yorkshire, and during the month of August\r\nso crowded was the place that many were lodged in stables and barns,\r\nwhilst others sought refuge at Poulton. The following year a fine gravel\r\npromenade was tastefully laid out on the sea bank to a considerable\r\ndistance, occupying a large portion of the site of the old road. A\r\nbeautiful green turf walk was constructed from the beach to the church,\r\nleading through pleasant fields, and furnished at intervals with covered\r\nseats. The Albion Hotel was also erected at the north-west corner of Lane\r\nEnds Street.\r\n\r\nMr. Whittle, in his publication descriptive, amongst other resorts, of\r\nBlackpool in 1830, and entitled “Marina,” says:—“Blackpool is furnished\r\nwith excellent accommodation, although it is a pity but what there had\r\nbeen some kind of uniformity observed, as all sea-bathing stations ought\r\nto have their houses built upon a plan entirely unique. Four assemblies\r\nhave been known to take place in one week during the bathing season,\r\nextending from July to October. In fact the rooms at the hotels are very\r\nextensive. Bank’s is the most commodious. The inhabitants seem to have\r\nno taste for ornamenting their doorways or windows with trellis work\r\nor verandahs, or with jessamines, woodbines, or hollyhocks, similar to\r\nthose at Southport, and many of the sea-bathing situations in the south.\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that there are here frequently at the flux\r\nof the season, from eight hundred to a thousand visitors. Blackpool has\r\nmost certainly been honoured since its commencement as a watering-place\r\nby persons of distinction and fashion. The hotels and other houses of\r\nreception are scattered along the beach with an aspect towards the Irish\r\nSea; and in the rear are the dwellings of the villagers. The cottages on\r\nthe beach have of late years considerably increased, and they serve, with\r\nthe hotels in the centre, to give the place, when viewed from the sea, a\r\nlarge and imposing appearance.”\r\n\r\nThe ball and dining-room at Nickson’s Hotel, (the Clifton Arms,) was of\r\nlarge dimensions, and contained a neat orchestra at one end, whilst the\r\nfollowing notice was suspended in a prominent position against the inner\r\nwall:—\r\n\r\n  “The friends of Cuthbert Nickson will please to observe that the\r\n  senior person at the hotel is entitled to the president’s chair;\r\n  and the junior to the vice-president’s. Also the ladies to have\r\n  the preference of the bathing machines.”\r\n\r\nPlacards, similar in their import to this one, were to be seen in both\r\nDickson’s and Bank’s Hotels.\r\n\r\nThe new promenade was improved in 1830 by the addition of a wooden\r\nhand-rail along its entire length, whilst comfortable seats were placed\r\nopposite the hotels of Banks and Nickson. The fairs, to which we have\r\nalready alluded, continued to be held every second Sunday during the\r\nseason, but a few years later they were abolished by the action of the\r\nmore respectable portion of the residents. Letters arrived at half-past\r\neleven in the morning, and were despatched at noon, daily in the summer\r\nmonths, but only three times a week during winter. Mr. Cook, an American,\r\nwas the originator of the post, which he commenced some time before by\r\nhaving the letters carried to Kirkham three times a week during the\r\nseason. At that day the arrival of the letter-bag was made known to the\r\nanxious public by exposing a board on which was written or painted,\r\n“The post is arrived.” This ingenious device proclaimed, on reversing\r\nthe board, “The post is not yet arrived;” so that by a proper use of\r\nthe signal the postmaster was enabled to save himself much trouble in\r\nanswering the frequent inquiries of expectant visitors. Mr. Cook, who\r\nis described as having been the “Beau Nash” of Blackpool, died in 1820,\r\nand was buried at Bispham. The charges at the best hotels were 6s. per\r\nday in private and 5s. in public, with an addition of 1s. each night for\r\na front, or 6d. for a back, bedroom. At Bonny’s the price was 4s. 6d.\r\nper day; and at Nickson’s and the Yorkshire House 3s. 6d. per day at the\r\nfirst table, and 2s. 6d. at the second, subject to an additional charge\r\nfor extra attendance if required.\r\n\r\nThe census returns of 1831 showed that the population of the township had\r\nincreased to 943 persons since 1821, when, the reader may be reminded,\r\nthe total amounted to 749.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, a Wesleyan chapel, calculated to hold between 250 and 300\r\npersons, was erected and opened in Bank Hey Street. This building, having\r\nin the course of time become inadequate for the accommodation of its\r\nincreasing congregation, was pulled down, and the corner stone of the\r\npresent edifice laid by W. Heap, esq., of Halifax, on Friday, November\r\n1st., 1861. The chapel, which occupies a site near the old one, was\r\nopened for service on the 4th of July, 1862, and is capable of seating\r\n760 persons. The total expenditure for the erection and other incidental\r\nexpenses connected with it, amounted to £3,500. An organ, built by Mr. E.\r\nWadsworth, of Manchester, at a cost of £320, was obtained in 1872.\r\n\r\nDuring 1836 great improvements were made in the appearance of the town;\r\nshops were beautified and increased in number; many of the cottages\r\nwere rendered more ornamental, whilst others were constructed on modern\r\nprinciples, and on a moderate calculation it may be estimated that two\r\nhundred beds were added to the existing accommodation. Sir Benjamin\r\nHeywood, bart., of Claremont, purchased an extensive plot of land, now\r\noccupied by the Prince of Wales’s Market and Aquarium Buildings, on\r\nwhich he shortly afterwards raised a handsome marine family residence,\r\ncalled West Hey. Numerous and copious springs of fine fresh water were\r\nfound at a depth of fifteen yards from the surface; until which fortunate\r\ndiscovery, water for drinking purposes had been collected in cisterns dug\r\nout of the marl. Public Baths were also erected on the beach adjoining\r\nthe Lane Ends Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1837, the Victoria Terrace and Promenade, erected\r\nat the north-west corner of Victoria Street, were completed. This block\r\nof buildings was formed of seven shops, above them being the Promenade,\r\na room thirty-two yards long, which opened through folding windows upon\r\na balcony six feet wide; attached to it were a news-room, library, and\r\nbilliard table. The Promenade acquired its distinctive title from being\r\nfirst used on the 24th of May, 1837, when the Princess Victoria, the\r\npresent Queen, attained her legal majority; on that day the principal\r\ninhabitants of Blackpool assembled there to celebrate the important event\r\nwith a sumptuous dinner, and from the subjoined extract, taken from an\r\naccount of the gathering in a public print, we learn the great estimation\r\nin which the saloon was then held:—\r\n\r\n  “ ... dinner and excellent wine provided by Mr. C. Nickson, to\r\n  which fifty-two gentlemen sat down, in the splendid Promenade\r\n  Room newly erected by Doctor Cocker, who was highly extolled\r\n  for his taste in the architectural design and decorations of\r\n  the building, which is of the chaste Doric order, and for his\r\n  spirited liberality in providing the visitors of this celebrated\r\n  resort with so spacious and magnificent a saloon, where, as in\r\n  a common centre, they may meet each other and enjoy the social\r\n  pleasures of a _conversatione_ whenever they please; thus\r\n  evincing his wish to promote a more friendly intercourse amongst\r\n  the strangers collected here from all quarters of the kingdom\r\n  during the summer season—this has hitherto been a _desideratum_\r\n  at Blackpool.”\r\n\r\nFor long afterwards balls and all public meetings were held in this\r\nassembly room, which still exists in its original condition, although\r\nthe other parts of the block, especially the shops, have recently been\r\nimproved and beautified.\r\n\r\nFrom 1837 to 1840 the progress of the place was steady, but not rapid,\r\nas compared with more recent times. In the latter year the opening of\r\nthe Preston and Wyre Railway to Poulton, initiated a mode of travelling\r\nuntil then unknown in the Fylde district, and by its means Blackpool\r\nbecame nearer in point of time to Preston, Manchester, and many other\r\nlarge towns already possessing railway accommodation, a great accession\r\nof company being the immediate result. Omnibuses, coaches, and other\r\ncarriages met every train at Poulton station, and the four miles of\r\nroad were scampered over by splendid teams in less than half an hour.\r\nThen it was that the jolting, homely vehicles, and the through coaches,\r\nwhich had for long been the dashing wonders of the country roads, were\r\ndriven off, and a greatly multiplied number of visitors brought into\r\nthe town daily by the more expeditious route, at a less cost and with\r\ngreater personal convenience than had been possible in earlier days. More\r\naccommodation was soon called for and as readily supplied by the spirited\r\ninhabitants, who erected numerous houses at several points, which served,\r\nat no distant period, as the nucleus for new streets and terraces. The\r\ncensus of the township in 1841 had risen to 2,168. In 1844 the erection\r\nand opening of a Market House, evinced the growing importance and\r\nprosperity of the watering-place; this building has lately, since 1872,\r\nbeen enlarged by lateral extension to quite double its original capacity,\r\nwhilst the extensive unprotected area opposite, used for similar trading\r\npurposes and occupied by stalls, has been covered over with a transparent\r\nroof. Talbot Road was opened out and the lower end formed into a spacious\r\nsquare, (furnished with an elegant drinking fountain in 1870) by the\r\nremoval of a house from its centre. These improvements were effected at\r\nthe sole cost of John Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham, the owner of the\r\nsoil. The Adelphi and Victoria Hotels, which had sprung into being, were\r\naltered and enlarged; the former by raising it a story, and the latter by\r\nthe addition of a commodious dining room, two sitting rooms, and sundry\r\nbedrooms. Several spacious residences were finished on South Beach, and\r\na handsome terrace of habitations stretching south from Dickson’s Hotel,\r\nwas also erected about that time.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, several houses on a larger scale, including the Talbot Hotel,\r\nwere built, and great improvements and additions made to many former\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the branch line from Blackpool to join the main railroad\r\nat Poulton, on the 29th of April, 1846, gave another marked impetus to\r\nthe progress of the town; by its formation direct steam communication\r\nwas completed with the populous centres of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and\r\nmany, who had previously been deterred from visiting Blackpool by its\r\ncomparative inaccessibility, now flocked down to its shores in great\r\nnumbers; building increased, and dwellings arose, chiefly on the front,\r\nand in Church and Victoria Streets.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing year the first meeting of the Blackpool Agricultural\r\nSociety was held on the grounds of a recently built inn, the Manchester\r\nHotel, at South Shore; the attendance was both numerous and respectable,\r\nincluding many of the most influential gentlemen, yeomen, and farmers of\r\nthe neighbourhood, and several from the remoter localities of the Fylde.\r\nCows, horses, and pigs appear to have been the only stocks to which\r\nprizes were awarded. The first Lodge of Freemasons held their initiatory\r\nmeeting in that year at the Beach Hotel, another house of entertainment\r\nwhich had risen shortly before, on the site of some furnished cottage\r\nfacing the beach.\r\n\r\nA new Independent Chapel was commenced in Victoria Street, to supersede\r\nthe small one erected in Chapel Street in 1825; the edifice was finished\r\nand used for divine service in 1849. Serious differences seem to have\r\narisen a few years later between the pastor of that date, the Rev. J.\r\nNoall, and a limited section of his congregation, who were anxious to\r\ndeprive him of his charge, and even went so far, in 1860, as to publicly\r\nread in the chapel, after morning service, a notice convening a meeting\r\nfor that purpose. This act, being repeated on the ensuing Sabbath, led to\r\nretaliation on the part of the partizans of the minister, who, unknown to\r\nthat gentleman, paraded three figures, intended to represent the three\r\nprincipal opponents to the continuance of his pastorate, suspended from\r\na gibbet, which had been erected in a cart, through the streets of the\r\ntown, and afterwards gave them up to the flames on the sands. The Rev. J.\r\nNoall was shortly afterwards presented with a testimonial of esteem by\r\na number of sympathisers. Schools, in connection with the chapel, were\r\nbuilt in 1870.\r\n\r\nTwo years subsequently, the watering-place had grown, without the\r\nfostering care of a public governing body, into a large and prosperous\r\ntown, boasting a resident population of over two thousand persons, but\r\nthis very increase and popularity had rendered it impossible for private\r\nenterprise to provide the requisite comforts and conveniences for such\r\na mixture of classes as visited it during the summer. Acting under this\r\nnecessity and for the welfare of the resort a Local Board was formed,\r\ncomposed of gentlemen elected from amongst inhabitants, into whose hands\r\nwas entrusted the government and regulation of all matters connected with\r\nthe place. An accession of power was sought in 1853, and on Tuesday, the\r\n14th of June, the Blackpool Improvement Act received the royal assent.\r\nThe Board originally consisted of nine members, but in 1871 the number\r\nwas increased to eighteen.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest acts of the new commissioners of 1853 was to provide\r\nfor the proper lighting of the town by the erection of Gas Works, which\r\nthey accomplished in their first year of office; for some time it had\r\nbeen evident that the season was seriously curtailed by the absence of\r\nany illumination along the promenade and thoroughfares during the autumn\r\nevenings, but private speculation had for some reason held aloof from so\r\nimportant an undertaking, although the question had been much discussed\r\namongst the inhabitants. Here it may be stated, in order to avoid\r\nreverting to the subject again, that in 1863 there were 650 consumers of\r\ngas; in 1869, 1270; and in 1875, no less than 2,000; the miles of mains\r\nin those years being respectively 5, 7, and 12.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, the promenade, which had suffered much injury from frequent\r\nattacks of the sea, and perhaps from some amount of negligence in not\r\nbestowing due attention to its proper maintenance, was put in better\r\norder and extended from its northern extremity, opposite Talbot Square,\r\nalong the front of Albert Terrace as far as Rossall’s, formerly Dickson’s\r\nHotel. Four years later a portion of this walk opposite Central Beach\r\nwas asphalted and sprinkled over with fine white spar. The Infant\r\nSchool-house in Bank Hey Street, was opened in 1856.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church, situated in Talbot Road, was erected in 1857,\r\nfrom the design of Edwin W. Pugin, Esq., and at the sole expense of Miss\r\nM. Tempest, sister to Sir Charles Tempest, Bart., of Broughton Hall,\r\nYorkshire. It is in the Gothic style, the exterior being built with\r\nYorkshire flag in narrow courses, hammer dressed and tuck pointed. The\r\nchurch comprises a chancel, north and south transepts, two sacristies,\r\nconfessionals, nave, aisles, south porch, and central western tower. The\r\nchancel, which is separated from the nave and transepts by a richly\r\ndecorated and moulded arch, contains four side windows in addition to a\r\nlarge one at the east end. The nave is divided into five bays of fifteen\r\nfeet each, with massive arches ornamented with deeply cut mouldings.\r\nThe tower is of great solidity, and rises to a height of one hundred\r\nand twenty-four feet. Almost the whole of the windows are filled with\r\nrichly stained glass; and the altar within the chancel is beautified\r\nwith elaborately carved groups, designed by J. H. Powell, of Birmingham,\r\nof the “Agony in the Garden,” and the “Last Supper;” whilst that in\r\nthe lady chapel is adorned, from the pencil of the same artist, with\r\nillustrations of the “Assumption of the Virgin,” and the “Annunciation,”\r\nall of which are exquisitely carved by Lane. This church is dedicated\r\nto the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and was the first one ever\r\nerected in Blackpool for members of the Roman Catholic Faith, service\r\nhaving been previously celebrated in a room in Talbot Road. In 1866 an\r\nexcellent peal of cast steel bells was added to the tower; and ten years\r\nafterwards a magnificent organ was opened in the main building. Attached\r\nto the church, and within the same enclosure, were placed day and Sunday\r\nschools, as well as a residence for the officiating priests. The cost\r\nof this magnificent pile, without the internal decorations, amounted to\r\n£5,500.\r\n\r\nThe foundation stone of the Union Baptist Chapel, in Abingdon Street,\r\nwas laid on the 9th of April, 1860, and on Good Friday in the following\r\nyear it was opened for divine worship by the Rev. Dr. Raffles. The\r\nmain building, 80 feet long by 49 feet wide, is of brick, and finished\r\nwith moulded and polished stone dressings in the Grecian style of\r\narchitecture. The principal or west front is surmounted by a bold cornice\r\nand pediment, and contains the two chief entrances, which are approached\r\nby a long range of steps and a spacious landing. The interior is fitted\r\nwith substantial open pews of red pine in the body, and similar seats are\r\nplaced in the two end galleries, the whole being capable of providing\r\naccommodation for about 650 persons. The communion floor, under a portion\r\nof which is the Baptistry, is enclosed with an ornamental balustrade.\r\nThe edifice is well supplied with light through plain circular-headed\r\nwindows. A Sunday school was added in 1874, and an organ also purchased\r\nduring that year. From 1858 to the completion of the chapel the Baptists\r\nworshipped in the room formerly used by the Roman Catholics in Talbot\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, the progress and improvement of the town was well shown by\r\nthree events which occurred at that date—the first sod of the Lytham and\r\nBlackpool coast line was cut at Lytham Park, on the 4th of September; a\r\nlarge Market Hall, raised on South Beach, by Mr. W. Read, for the sale of\r\nuseful and fancy articles was completed; and the original Christ Church\r\nwas opened on Sunday the 23rd of June, by the Rev. C. H. Wainwright,\r\nM.A. This church, which stood until the erection of the present one,\r\nwas built of iron by Mr. Hemming, of London, at a cost of £1,000, which\r\nwas advanced by eight gentlemen, who were subsequently reimbursed by\r\ncontributions from the public and collections from the congregation at\r\nvarious times.\r\n\r\nThe population of Layton-with-Warbreck in 1861 amounted to 3,907 persons,\r\nof which number Blackpool contributed 3,506.\r\n\r\nThe passenger traffic on the Blackpool and Lytham Railway commenced\r\non the 6th of April, 1862, and between that date and the 30th of June\r\nover 35,000 persons had taken advantage of the line and been conveyed\r\nbetween the two watering-places. In 1862 a handsome Police Station and\r\nCourt-House sprang into being in Abingdon street, including residences,\r\nlock-ups, offices, magistrates’ room, etc.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Blackpool no longer presented the meagre and broken lines\r\nof earlier days, but were in most instances well filled on each side with\r\ncompact blocks of houses. In December, 1861, a few of the townpeople\r\nassembled at the Clifton Arms Hotel to consider the advisability of\r\nerecting a pier, to extend westward from the promenade opposite Talbot\r\nsquare; and on the 22nd of January, 1862, the memorandum of association\r\nwas signed with a capital of £12,000, being immediately registered.\r\nPlans were examined on the 10th of February, and the design of E. Birch,\r\nesq., C.E., selected, that gentleman being also appointed engineer. In\r\nApril, the tender of Messrs. Laidlaw, of Glasgow, to construct the pier\r\nfor £11,540 was accepted; and a grant of the foreshore required for the\r\nundertaking having been obtained from the Duchy of Lancaster for £120,\r\nand £7 paid to the Crown for the portion beyond low-water mark, the\r\nfirst pile of the North Pier was screwed into the marl on the 27th of\r\nJune, 1862, by Captain Francis Preston, the chairman of the company. A\r\nviolent storm in the ensuing October damaged the works to some extent,\r\nand induced the company to raise the deck of the pier three feet above\r\nthe altitude originally proposed, at an expense of £2,000. On the 21st\r\nof May, 1863, the pier was formally opened by Captain Preston, the\r\nauspicious event being celebrated by general rejoicings throughout the\r\ntown and a procession of the different schools and friendly societies.\r\nThe dimensions of the erection at that date were:—Approach, 80 feet\r\nlong; abutment, 120 feet long and 45 feet wide; main portion, 1,070 feet\r\nlong and 28 feet wide; and the head, 135 feet long and 55 feet wide,\r\ngiving a total length of 1,405 feet available as a promenade. The entire\r\nsuperstructure was placed upon clusters of iron piles, fixed vertically\r\ninto the ground by means of screws, those at the abutment and main body\r\nbeing wholly of cast, and those at the head partly of cast and partly of\r\nwrought iron. The largest of the cast-iron columns measured 12 inches\r\nin diameter, and 1⅓ inch in thickness, each column being filled in with\r\nconcrete. The piles were arranged in clusters at intervals of 60 feet,\r\nand firmly secured together longitudinally, transversely, and diagonally,\r\nby rods and braces. The main girders, of the sort known as plated, were\r\nrivetted on the clusters in lengths of 70 feet, and formed parapets,\r\npresenting a pleasing appearance and constituting a most efficient wind\r\nguard to the pier. The tops of the girders were turned to useful account\r\nby converting them into a continuous line of seats. Next to the chief\r\ngirders were fixed transverse wrought iron girders, upon the top of\r\nwhich the planking of the deck was laid, being arranged in longitudinal\r\nand transverse layers, so that no open spaces were left to admit the\r\npassage of wind or spray. The head of the pier, rectangular in form, was\r\nraised 50 feet above low-water mark, and leading from it to ample landing\r\nstages below, was a flight of steps 10 feet wide. The limits of the pier\r\nshore-wards were defined by ornamental iron gates with lamps, immediately\r\ninside which were the toll houses. Upon the main portion of the pier\r\nwere erected several ornamental shelter and refreshment houses of an\r\noctagonal shape, and standing on side projections. Another ornamental\r\nshelter house of much larger dimensions was placed, within a few months,\r\non the head. Lamps were provided along the entire length of the pier. In\r\n1867 the directors determined to erect an iron extension or jetty, and\r\nin less than two years the work was accomplished at a cost of £6,000.\r\nDuring the month of May, 1869, a tender for the formation of the present\r\nentrance for £2,700 was accepted, and the agreement promptly carried out\r\nby Messrs. Laidlaw, of Glasgow. In October, 1874, the company arranged\r\nwith the same contractors to enlarge the pierhead by putting out two\r\nwings, from the designs of E. Birch, esq., C.E., at an expenditure of\r\n£14,000. On the north wing it is intended to build a pavilion, 130 feet\r\nlong by 90 feet wide, in an eastern style of architecture, and estimated\r\nto hold 1,200 persons seated. The edifice, around which there will be a\r\npromenade, is to be supplied with an orchestra, refreshment rooms, etc.,\r\nand used as a concert room and fashionable marine lounge. The south wing,\r\nwhich is about 130 feet long, contains a bandstand, capable of holding\r\n30 performers, at the further end, and on the east and west side two\r\nother buildings 62 feet by 27 feet each, the former being designed for\r\nthe purposes of a restaurant, and the latter for the sale of fancy goods\r\nand other commodities. The unoccupied space, nearly 100 feet by 80 feet,\r\nwill be provided with seats in the centre, the remainder serving as a\r\npromenade. The contract for the foregoing erections was let in 1875,\r\nto Messrs. Robert Neill and Sons, of Manchester, for nearly £12,000.\r\nIn 1863, the capital of the company was raised to £15,000; in 1864,\r\nto £20,000; in 1865, to £25,000; in 1874, to £40,000; and in 1875, to\r\n£50,000.\r\n\r\nAbout the period when the North Pier was constructed, and for years\r\npreviously, the visitors to Blackpool could certainly complain of no lack\r\nof ordinary amusements during their brief residence by the sea. Horses,\r\ndonkeys, and vehicles were ever in readiness to administer to their\r\nentertainment, either by conveying them for short drives to explore such\r\nobjects of interest as the country afforded, or translating them for the\r\nday to the seaport of Fleetwood, or the neighbouring resort of Lytham.\r\nBathing machines abounded on the sands, and during suitable states of the\r\ntide were busily engaged in affording ready access to the briny element\r\nto numbers, who were anxious to experience the invigorating effects of\r\na bath in Neptune’s domain. In the evenings theatrical representations\r\nwere frequently held, since 1861, in the spacious room of Read’s Market.\r\nThe Crystal Palace, formerly the Victoria Promenade, was also devoted\r\nto similar purposes, having long been diverted from the use for which\r\nit was first intended. The Number 3 Hotel, under its old name, but in a\r\nmore modern building than that described by Mr. Hutton at the close of\r\nlast century, still flourished, and proved equally attractive, not so\r\nmuch, however, on account of its “fine ale” as the wealth of strawberries\r\nand floral beauties adorning its gardens. Carleton Terrace was built in\r\n1863; and on the 10th of March in that year the marriage of the Prince\r\nof Wales and the Princess Alexandra of Denmark, was celebrated with\r\nmany manifestations of loyalty and joy. Flags, banners, and ensigns\r\nwere suspended from the windows of almost every house, whilst sports of\r\nvarious kinds were held on the sands during the morning, after which\r\nthe school children, belonging to the different denominations, and a\r\nbody of Oddfellows, amounting in all to 900 persons, assembled in Talbot\r\nSquare, and sang the national anthem, previous to forming a procession\r\nand parading the streets of the town. Subsequently the children were\r\nregaled with tea, buns, etc. The Preston Banking Company established a\r\nbranch at Blackpool during 1863; and in the month of January a party\r\nof gentlemen purchased the whole of the land lying between the site\r\nof Carleton terrace and the Gynn, for the purpose of laying it out in\r\nbuilding plots and promenades, the main feature to be a large central\r\nhotel standing in its own grounds. The contracts were let by the company\r\nin October, 1863, for embanking, sewering, and forming the necessary\r\nroads and promenades on their estate, and shortly afterwards an agreement\r\nwas entered into for preparing the foundation of the hotel, the work in\r\nboth instances being promptly commenced. The magnitude of the scheme\r\nfar exceeded that of any undertaking which had ever yet been attempted\r\nin Blackpool, but undisturbed by the speculative character of their\r\nventure the proprietors carried the enterprise through its various phases\r\nwith a liberal and vigorous hand, succeeding in the course of time in\r\ncreating an acquisition of incalculable beauty and benefit to the town.\r\nThe Imperial Hotel has its station on the highest point of the land, now\r\ncalled Claremont Park, and is a palatial edifice, surrounded by elegant\r\nlawns and walks, walled off from the park outside. In 1876 an extensive\r\nenlargement, consisting of a south wing, containing 39 bedrooms and 6\r\nsitting-rooms, was made to the establishment. The cliffs fronting the\r\nestate, formerly rugged and uneven, were sloped and pitched to form a\r\nprotection from the inroads of the tide, whilst a broad marine promenade\r\nwas made along the whole length of the park, about a mile, and fenced\r\nwith an iron railing on its open aspect. The main promenade of the town\r\nwas continued round the west side of the park as far as the Gynn, but on\r\na lower level than the walk just indicated. Shrubs were planted and toll\r\nhouses, with gates, fixed at the entrances to the estate, all of which\r\nwas enclosed with railings. The splendid residences denominated Stanley\r\nVillas, Wilton Parade, Imperial Terrace, and Lansdowne Crescent were\r\nnot dilatory in rearing their several heads in a locality so congenial\r\nto their aristocratic proclivities, the foundations of the last being\r\nprepared in 1864.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the Lane Ends Hotel was levelled to the ground, and the present\r\nhandsome structure, in the Italian style of architecture, raised on the\r\nsite, being re-opened again two years later. The foundation stone of the\r\nUnited Methodist Free Church was laid in Adelaide Street on the 30th of\r\nMarch, in the year specified, by James Sidebottom, esq., of Manchester,\r\nservice being held in the building in the course of a few months; whilst\r\nthe newly-arrived lifeboat was launched, and the first supply of the\r\nFylde Waterworks Company passed through their pipes to Blackpool on the\r\n20th of July. The station of the lifeboat, named the “Robert William,” is\r\nsituated near the beach at South Shore, close to the Manchester Hotel;\r\nand here we may mention that this boat, under the skilful and intrepid\r\nmanagement of its crew and coxswain, has been instrumental on several\r\noccasions in affording aid in time of shipwreck. Amongst these instances\r\nmay be noted the rescue of a crew of fourteen persons belonging to the\r\nbarque “Susan L. Campbell,” wrecked on Salthouse Bank on the 11th April,\r\n1867, assistance being rendered also to the barque “A. L. Routh”; and the\r\nrescue of the crew of the schooner “Glyde,” stranded on the South Beach\r\non the same eventful morning. The annual expense incurred in the support\r\nof this valuable institution is defrayed by voluntary contributions.\r\n\r\nThe unflagging efforts of the inhabitants to promote the comfort of\r\ntheir visitors in matters of household convenience and accommodation,\r\nand to render their sojourns by the shore productive of pleasurable, as\r\nwell as healthful, sensations, were manifestly well appreciated by those\r\nfor whose benefit they were intended. The daily crowds parading the\r\nrecently-erected pier were satisfactory evidence of the high estimation\r\nin which that elegant addition to the attractions of the place was held,\r\nwhilst the thronged thoroughfares during the heat of summer bore witness\r\nto the growing affection which Blackpool was gaining for itself in the\r\nhearts of the million. Active exertions were necessary on the part of the\r\nbuilders to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for more extended\r\nresidential provision, houses being scarcely completed before the eager\r\ntenants had established themselves in their new domiciles. The greater\r\nportion of the Clifton Arms Hotel was pulled down in the autumn of 1865,\r\nand rebuilt on an enlarged and improved scale, being finished and ready\r\nfor occupation in the ensuing spring. On the 20th of June, 1865, the\r\nfirst members of the Blackpool Volunteer Artillery Corps, amounting to\r\nabout 60 men, took the oath customary on enrolment, and at the same\r\nmeeting appointed their officers. Ten years later a commodious drill-shed\r\nwas erected for their use.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the temporary iron church, to which allusion has been made in\r\na late page, was superseded by the existing substantial one in Queen\r\nStreet, bearing the name of its predecessor. The edifice was opened for\r\ndivine service on Thursday, the 3rd of May, by the Rev. E. B. Chalmers,\r\nM.A., of Salford, but was not consecrated until 1870. The architecture\r\nis an early and simple style of decorated Gothic, with thick walls and\r\nprominently projecting buttresses. The east and west ends are lighted\r\nrespectively by four and five-light traceried windows and lancets. The\r\nsteeple, which is well buttressed, has in its upper stage a belfry for\r\nsix bells, and is surmounted by a vane. Until recent additions were made,\r\nthe church contained sittings for 1,000 persons. The building originally\r\ncomprised a broad nave, with a central aisle and two side passages giving\r\naccess to the seats, all of which were open benches with sloping backs;\r\nnorth and south transepts with galleries, lighted by bay windows; a\r\nspacious chancel, with north and south aisles, the former being fitted up\r\nas a vestry, and the latter used as the organ-chamber; a spacious porch\r\nat the west end, with a wide double door; a west gallery extending over\r\nthe porch, and approached by a staircase along the basement of the tower;\r\nand a baptistry covered with a separate hipped roof. The alterations\r\njust alluded to were carried out in 1874, and consisted of the erection\r\nof north and south aisles to the nave, providing accommodation for about\r\n300 more worshippers. The district assigned to Christ Church in 1872 was\r\nconverted into a parish in 1874, and the title of vicar given to the\r\nincumbent. The Rev. C. H. Wainwright, M.A., to whose exertions the new\r\nstructure mainly owes its existence, was the first incumbent, and is the\r\npresent vicar. The schools connected with the church are situated in\r\nQueen Street, and were built in 1872.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1866 the Lancaster Banking Company and the Manchester and\r\nCounty Banking Company each opened a branch in Blackpool, and like the\r\nPreston Bank, previously referred to, now transact business daily.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1867, the Prince of Wales Arcade on Central Beach was finished\r\nand opened, comprising a block of building, with extensive market\r\naccommodation, assembly rooms, etc., erected on the site between\r\nthe Beach and Royal Hotels in an imposing and ornamental style of\r\narchitecture; and on the 19th of December, the corner stone of the\r\nTemperance Hall in Coronation Street was laid by the Rev. R. Crook,\r\nand in the following July the erection was completed and opened. The\r\ntemperance movement had been commenced in Blackpool four years anterior\r\nto that date, when a Band of Hope in connection with the United Methodist\r\nFree Church was formed, and the number of its members increased so\r\nrapidly in the intervening time that it was considered advisable to build\r\nthe present Hall for their meetings, and for those of others who were\r\ninterested in the same cause.\r\n\r\nThe marked success which had attended the construction of the North Pier\r\ninduced a company of gentlemen to erect a similar one, running seaward\r\nfrom the margin of the promenade at the south of Blackpool. The first\r\npile was screwed in July, 1867, and on the 30th of May, 1868, the South\r\nPier and Jetty were thrown open to the public without any inaugural\r\nceremony. It is built of wrought iron and timber, and has the following\r\ndimensions:—Total length 1,518 feet, the main promenade being 1,118\r\nfeet, and the lower promenade or jetty 400 feet; the entrance is on an\r\nabutment 60 feet wide, where there are gates, toll-houses, waiting and\r\nretiring-rooms; the pier head is rectangular in form, and composed of\r\nstrong timber, containing an area of 8,120 superficial feet. The chief\r\npromenade is furnished with seats on each side throughout its whole\r\nlength, together with twelve recesses, on which are shops for the sale\r\nof fancy articles and refreshments. On the head of the pier are placed\r\ntwo large waiting and refreshment rooms, as well as a commodious shelter\r\nand wind guard. At the extremity of the jetty is a beacon and light as\r\nrequired by the authorities at Trinity House.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 a magnificent pile of buildings, erected in Talbot Square, and\r\ncalled the Arcade and Assembly Rooms, was completed. This structure\r\ncontains a basement and arcade of very elegant shops, a restaurant,\r\nrefreshment and billiard rooms, together with a handsome and spacious\r\nsaloon, surrounded within by a gallery, and furnished with a neat stage\r\nfor theatrical representations and other entertainments. Several sleeping\r\napartments were added in 1874, and a certain section of the edifice\r\narranged as a private hotel.\r\n\r\nThe promenade had always been esteemed so much the property of the house\r\nand land owners on the front of the beach that to them was delegated\r\nthe onerous duty of maintaining in repair such portions of the hulking\r\nas ran before each of their possessions, the walk itself being kept\r\nin order and supported by subscriptions amongst the visitors and\r\nresidents generally. Under this arrangement although the embankment was\r\nensured from being carried away by the waves, there was no certainty\r\nthat its upper surface would invariably present that neat and finished\r\nappearance so necessary to the success of a marine promenade. Voluntary\r\ncontributions are in most instances but a precarious support on which\r\nto rely exclusively, and at Blackpool their unfortunate characteristic\r\nwas prominently exemplified, more particularly during the earlier years\r\nof the watering-place, when visitors, whom the summer had drawn to the\r\ncoast, too frequently discovered their favourite lounge in a state far\r\nfrom attractive to the pedestrian. Recently there had been comparatively\r\nlittle cause for complaint as to the condition in which each opening\r\nseason found the promenade, but it was felt on all sides that the day had\r\narrived when a new and much more extensive walk should be laid out, and\r\nthat the responsibility of maintaining both it and the fence in proper\r\norder should devolve upon the town, from the funds, or rather borrowing\r\npowers, of which it was proposed to carry out the undertaking. In 1865 a\r\nspecial act of parliament had been obtained with this object by the Local\r\nBoard of Health, at a cost of £2,159, by which permission to borrow up\r\nto £30,000 was granted, but no active steps were then taken, and three\r\nyears later a supplemental act was procured to borrow up to an amount\r\nwhich, when added to the amount already in hand under the former act,\r\nwould not exceed altogether two years’ assessable value, the whole to\r\nbe repaid within a period of fifty years from the date of receiving the\r\nloan. There were other difficulties to encounter, notwithstanding that\r\nthe Board had the power of compulsory purchased granted, in the buying of\r\nland to prosecute the purpose of the act. These were ultimately overcome\r\nby arbitration in cases where disputes had arisen. A supplemental act\r\nin 1867 allowed the board to amend and curtail several clauses in the\r\noriginal act, the first of which was to abridge the dimensions of the\r\nproposed work, the second to empower the levying of rates according to\r\nthe act of 1865 on the completion of each section of the undertaking,\r\nand the third to extend the time for the compulsory purchase of land\r\nfrom three to five years. According to the act the commissioners gained\r\na right to collect tolls for the usage of the promenade from all persons\r\nnot assessed or liable to be assessed by any rate leviable by the Local\r\nBoard of Health, with the exception of those crossing to the piers. This\r\npower, it may be stated, was not intended to be, and never has been, put\r\nin force. The promenade proposed to be made would reach from Carleton\r\nTerrace to the further end of South Shore, a distance of about two miles;\r\nand the work was divided into three sections, the first of which, begun\r\nin 1868, was let to Mr. Robert Carlisle, contractor, for £16,043, and\r\nextended from South Shore to the Fox Hall Hotel. The storm which occurred\r\non January 31st, 1869, washed away 350 yards of the newly-constructed sea\r\nfence and carriage-drive, with about 16,000 cubic yards of embankment,\r\nand about 6,000 square yards of pitching. Another storm which took place\r\non the 28th of February, added considerably to the damage just stated,\r\nby tearing down a length of 250 yards, which was entirely completed, so\r\nthat the total injury inflicted by the waves during the gale represented\r\n600 lineal yards of sea fence, carriage-drive, and promenade, comprising\r\n21,000 cubic yards of embankment, all of which had to be replaced from\r\nthe shore at a considerable expense, in addition to 9,500 square yards\r\nof pitching, etc., connected therewith. No. 2 section, running from\r\nthe Fox Hall Hotel to the New Inn, was contracted for by a Manchester\r\ngentleman at £3,964, but in consequence of his not being able to carry\r\nout the work, it was re-let, and Mr. Chatburn succeeded him on the\r\nincreased terms of £4,942. No. 3 section, stretching from the New Inn\r\nto the southern extremity of Carleton Terrace, was also constructed by\r\nMr. Robert Carlisle, at a cost of £10,356. The whole of the ironwork was\r\nsupplied by Mr. Clayton, of Preston, and necessitated an expenditure of\r\n£3,275. The sea fence consists of a sloping breastwork, pitched with\r\nstones on a thick bed of clay puddle, the interstices between the stones\r\nhaving been filled in with asphalt or cement concrete. The slope is\r\ncurvilinear, and one in four on an average. Next to the breast is the\r\npromenade and carriage-drive. The promenade is seven yards wide, and has\r\nan even surface of asphalting, being separated from the carriage-drive\r\nby a line of side stones. In order to obtain space between the houses\r\nand the sea for the promenade and carriage-drive, a part of the shore\r\nwas regained by an embankment along South Shore, and along the northern\r\ndistrict by an iron viaduct, which projects considerably over the sea\r\nfence, and encircles the marine aspect of Bailey’s Hotel. The floor\r\nof the viaduct is formed with patent buckled plates, filled in with\r\nconcrete, and finished with asphalt. The plates are fixed to rolled\r\njoists, and supported on neat cast-iron columns, screwed down into the\r\nsolid. The west front of the promenade is guarded by an iron railing, and\r\nfurnished at intervals with seats of the same material, situated on the\r\nembankment to the south, and on projecting ledges of the viaduct along\r\nthe northern length. The carriage-drive, twelve yards wide, runs parallel\r\nwith the promenade throughout the entire extent, and is formed of\r\nshingle, clay, and macadam. It has a footway along the frontages of the\r\nadjoining property, the whole being well drained and lighted with gas.\r\nThe complete structure was finished and formally opened to the public on\r\nEaster Monday, 18th of April, 1870, by Colonel Wilson-Patten, M.P., the\r\npresent Lord Winmarleigh. The town was profusely decorated with bunting\r\nof every hue; triumphal arches of evergreens and ensigns spanned many of\r\nthe thoroughfares, notably Talbot Road and along the front; whilst an\r\nimmense procession, consisting of the Artillery Volunteers, Yeomanry in\r\nuniform, trades with their emblems, friendly societies, schools, etc.,\r\nheaded by a band, and comprising in its ranks no less than twelve mayors\r\nfrom important towns of Lancashire, conducted Colonel Wilson-Patten to\r\nthat portion of the promenade opposite Talbot Square, where the ceremony\r\nof declaring the walk accessible for public traffic was gone through.\r\nDuring the evening the watering-place was illuminated, and the eventful\r\nday closed with a large ball, held in honour of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the authorities in having Blackpool provided with a marine\r\npromenade and a frontage unrivalled by any on the coasts of England was\r\nsoon evinced by the increase in the stream of visitors poured into the\r\nplace during the summer months. Fresh houses for their accommodation\r\nwere being rapidly erected in many parts of the town, and everywhere\r\nthere were ample evidences that prosperity was dealing liberally with the\r\ntown. The wooden railings, which heretofore had been deemed sufficiently\r\nornamental fences for the residences facing the sea, were removed, and\r\nelegant iron ones substituted, apportioning to each habitation its own\r\nplot of sward or garden. The proprietor of Bailey’s Hotel hastened to\r\nfollow the example which had been set by those who were interested in the\r\nClifton Arms and Lane Ends Hotels, and commenced a series of levellings\r\nand rebuildings, under the superintendence and according to the designs\r\nof Messrs. Speakman and Charlesworth, architects, of Manchester, which\r\nextended over several years, and have now rendered the hotel one of\r\nthe most imposing and handsome edifices in the watering-place. Further\r\nalterations, consisting in the erection of shops on a vacant piece\r\nof land lying on the north side of the hotel, in the same style of\r\narchitecture, and continuous with it, were carried out in 1876.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 a project was launched for purchasing Raikes Hall with the\r\nestate belonging thereto, situated on the east aspect of Blackpool, and\r\nconverting the latter into a park and pleasure gardens. In that year a\r\ncompany was formed, entitled the Raikes Hall Park, Gardens, and Aquarium\r\nCompany, and the land obtained without delay. Vigorous operations were\r\nat once commenced to render the grounds of the old mansion suitable for\r\nthe purposes held in view, whilst the building itself speedily underwent\r\nsundry alterations and additions in its transformation into a refreshment\r\nhouse on a large scale. A spacious terrace, walks, promenades, and flower\r\nbeds were laid out, and an extensive conservatory constructed with all\r\nhaste, and in the summer after gaining possession of the estate, the\r\nworks had so far progressed that the public were admitted at a small\r\ncharge per head. Since that date a dancing platform has been put down,\r\nan immense pavillion erected, and many other changes effected in the\r\nwide enclosure. Pyrotechnic displays, acrobatic performances, etc., are\r\nheld in the gardens, which comprise about 40 statute acres, during the\r\nseason, whilst agricultural shows and other meetings occasionally take\r\nplace within its boundaries. An extensive lake was formed in 1875, and\r\nan excellent race-course marked out. Raikes Hall has a brief history of\r\nits own, and was erected about the middle of the eighteenth century by\r\na Mr. Butcher, who resided there. Tradition affirms that this gentleman\r\nsprang suddenly into an ample fortune from a station of obscurity and\r\npoverty, giving rise to a supposition that he had appropriated to his own\r\nuses a large mass of wealth asserted to have been lost at that time in a\r\nvessel wrecked on the coast. It is probable, however, that the foregoing\r\nis merely an idle tale, utterly unworthy of credence. Mr. Butcher, who\r\nwas succeeded by his son, died in 1769, at the ripe age of 80, and was\r\ninterred in Bispham churchyard, the following words being inscribed on\r\nhis tombstone:—\r\n\r\n  “His pleasure was to give or lend,\r\n  He always stood a poor man’s friend.”\r\n\r\nThe mansion and estate were purchased by William Hornby, esq., of\r\nKirkham, shortly before his death in 1824, and by him bequeathed to his\r\nbrother John Hornby, esq., of Blackburn, who married Alice Kendall, a\r\nwidow, and the daughter of Daniel Backhouse, esq., of Liverpool. Daniel\r\nHornby, esq., the eldest son of that union, inherited the property on the\r\ndecease of his father in 1841, and took up his abode at the Hall until\r\nthe early part of 1860, when he left the neighbourhood. Raikes Hall then\r\nbecame the seat of a Roman Catholic Convent School, which continued in\r\npossession for several years, until the new and handsome edifice standing\r\non a rising ground in Little Layton was erected and ready for its\r\nreception. Shortly after the removal of the school the land and residence\r\nwere purchased by the company above named, and their aspects began to\r\nundergo the changes already indicated. The census returns of the township\r\ncollected in 1871, furnished a total of 7,902 persons, all of whom, with\r\nthe exception of an insignificant proportion, were resident in Blackpool.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a letter from the Secretary of State, giving notice\r\nthat the burial ground in connection with St. John’s Church must be\r\nclosed after the 31st of December, 1871, the responsibility of providing\r\na suitable place for interments was thrown upon the authorities, and the\r\nmembers of the Local Board of Health formed themselves into a Burial\r\nBoard, their first meeting being held on the 20th of June in the year\r\njust specified. A committee was appointed, and in the ensuing August\r\npurchased for £1,759 an eligible site of 8½ acres, lying by the side of\r\nthe New Road, into which the entrance gates of the cemetery now open.\r\nThe plans for the requisite erections were prepared by Messrs. Garlick,\r\nPark, and Sykes, architects, of Preston, and the work of preparing the\r\nground commenced in October, the contract for the chapels and lodge being\r\nlet in December. As such a brief interval had to elapse before the order\r\nfor closing the churchyard would be put in force, the Board applied,\r\nsuccessfully, for permission to keep it open six months longer. The\r\ncemetery, however, progressed so tardily that it was necessary to renew\r\nthe application on two future occasions, and the churchyard continued\r\nin use until the 31st of May, 1873. Five acres of the land were laid\r\nout from plans supplied by Mr. Gorst, surveyor to the board, and were\r\ndivided into nine sections, four of which were apportioned to the Church\r\nof England, three to the Nonconformists, and two to the Roman Catholics.\r\nThe cemetery was enclosed from the highway by stone palisadings and\r\nboundary walls, having massive iron railings. The approach to the grounds\r\nis through a spacious entrance, with a double iron gate in the centre,\r\nand a single gate on either side, hung to stone pillars. Inside the\r\ngate is the lodge, built of stone and comprising a residence for the\r\nkeeper, offices, etc. The mortuary chapels, which are all of stone, have\r\nan elegant appearance, that of the Church of England being stationed in\r\nthe middle, with the Nonconformists’ and Roman Catholics’ edifices lying\r\nrespectively west and east of it. The style of the buildings is Gothic\r\nof the first pointed period. The roofs are open-timbered, high-pitched,\r\nand covered with Welsh slates in bands of different colours, being\r\nalso crested with tiles. Entrance to the chapels is gained by a porch,\r\nand there is a vestry attached to each. The floors are laid with plain\r\ntiles of various tints. Evergreens, shrubs, and forest trees have been\r\nplanted on the borders of the grounds, whilst the walks are wide and\r\nwell cared for. The Nonconformists were the first to take possession of\r\ntheir portion, which was dedicated to its solemn uses by a service held\r\non the 7th of February, 1873, exactly one week after which an interment\r\ntook place, being the earliest not only in their land but in the whole\r\nground. On the 2nd of August in the same year the Right Rev. Dr. Fraser,\r\nbishop of Manchester, consecrated the division set apart for the Church\r\nof England, which had been licensed for burials in the previous May. The\r\nRoman Catholics deferred their ceremonial until the month of June, 1874,\r\nacting under license during the interval.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of August, 1872, the Blackpool Sea Water Company was\r\nregistered under the limited liability act, with a capital of £10,000,\r\nin shares of £10 each, for the purpose of supplying water from the deep,\r\ntogether with the requisite appliances for conducting it to the houses\r\nand elsewhere, to the inhabitants of Blackpool; and rather more than\r\ntwo years later a main of pipes had been laid along the front from the\r\nMerchants’ College in South Shore as far as their steam pumping works in\r\nUpper Braithwaite Street.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the watering-place had developed so rapidly during past years\r\nthat the members of the Local Board of Health felt that the powers\r\nappertaining to a body of that description were no longer adequate to\r\nthe proper government of the town, and a public meeting to ascertain the\r\nopinion of the ratepayers on the subject of incorporation was called\r\non Tuesday, the 6th of November, 1874. After considerable discussion,\r\nit was proposed by the Rev. N. S. Jeffreys: “That a petition be drawn\r\nup and signed by the chairman on behalf of the meeting, praying that\r\na Charter of Incorporation be granted for the town of Blackpool, and\r\nthat the same be forwarded to the proper authorities; and that the\r\nnecessary steps be taken to obtain such Charter.” The proposition was\r\nadopted without a dissentient; and at the ensuing assembly of the Local\r\nBoard of Health on Tuesday, the 10th of November, a similar motion was\r\nbrought forward by W. H. Cocker, esq., J.P., with an equally successful\r\nresult. The prayers were forwarded to the appropriate official quarters\r\nin London, and on the 26th of May, 1875, Major Donnelly, R.E., the\r\ncommissioner appointed by Her Majesty’s Privy Council, attended at\r\nthe Board-room to hold an inquiry as to whether the importance and\r\nnecessities of the place warranted a favourable answer to the request.\r\nIn the course of the examination, it was stated, amongst other things,\r\nthat the rateable value of the proposed borough was in 1863, £17,489;\r\n1866, £35,175; 1869, £45,755; 1872, £55,653; 1874, £63,848; and in 1875,\r\n£73,035. Also that the town contained three churches, seven chapels,\r\nthree rooms used for religious services, two markets under the Local\r\nBoard, other markets owned by private individuals, four public sea-water\r\nbaths, three banks, an aquarium, public gardens, etc. On the 16th of the\r\nfollowing July information was officially conveyed to W. M. Charnley,\r\nesq., the law-clerk of the board, that the lords of the Privy Council\r\nhad determined to accede to the prayer of the town, and that the borough\r\nshould consist of six wards, with one alderman and three councillors\r\nfor each. A draft of the scheme of incorporation was prepared by the\r\nlaw-clerk, and forwarded to London. On the 22nd January, 1876, the\r\ncharter, having passed through the necessary forms, obtained the royal\r\nassent, being received by W. M. Charnley, esq., two days later. The\r\ndocument, after quoting several acts of parliament, proceeds to “grant\r\nand declare that the inhabitants of the town of Blackpool and their\r\nsuccessors, shall be for ever hereafter one body politic and corporate in\r\ndeed, fact, and name, and that the said body corporate shall be called\r\nthe Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of Blackpool, who\r\nshall have and exercise all the acts, powers, authorities, immunities,\r\nand privileges which are now held and exercised by the bodies corporate\r\nof the several boroughs” similarly created. Further, the deed “grants\r\nand declares that the said Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses and their\r\nsuccessors shall and may for ever hereafter use a common seal to serve\r\nthem in transacting their business, and also have armorial bearings\r\nand devices, which shall be duly entered and enrolled in the Herald’s\r\nCollege;” also shall they have power “to purchase, take, and acquire\r\nsuch lands, tenements, and heriditaments, whatsoever, situate, lying,\r\nand being within the borough, as shall be necessary for the site of\r\nthe buildings and premises required for the official purposes of the\r\ncorporation.” The Council was ordained to consist of “a Mayor, six\r\nAldermen, and eighteen Councillors, to be respectively elected at such\r\ntimes and places, and in such manner” as those of other boroughs existing\r\nunder the same acts, in common with which they “shall have, exercise, and\r\nenjoy all the powers, immunities, and privileges, and be subject to the\r\nsame duties, penalties, liabilities, and disqualifications” appertaining\r\nto such positions. The first election of councillors was directed to\r\nbe held on the eleventh day of April, 1876, followed by another on the\r\n1st of November, at which latter date one-third part of the councillors\r\nshould go out of office each year, and the vacant seats be refilled as\r\nspecified; the councillors to retire in the November, 1876, being those\r\nwho had obtained the smallest number of votes, and in November, 1877,\r\nthose with the next smallest number of votes. The first aldermen of the\r\nborough “shall be elected and assigned to their respective wards on the\r\n19th day of April, 1876, and the councillors immediately afterwards shall\r\nappoint who shall be the aldermen to go out of office upon the 9th day\r\nof November ensuing,” and in subsequent years those so retiring to be\r\naldermen who have retained their seats for the longest period without\r\nre-election. The first mayor of the borough “shall be elected from and\r\nout of the aldermen and councillors of the said borough, on the 19th day\r\nof April, 1876,” the earliest appointment of auditors and assessors being\r\nmade on the 19th day of the following month. The subjoined extent and\r\nnames of the wards are also taken from the charter:—\r\n\r\n  CLAREMONT WARD.\r\n\r\n  “Commencing at the Sea beyond the Gynn, at the junction of the\r\n  old existing township boundary, thence running inland along the\r\n  same boundary across the fields, across Knowle-road, behind\r\n  Warbrick and Mill Inn, across Poulton-road to the centre of the\r\n  Dyke at Little Layton, thence along the Dyke to the centre of\r\n  Little Layton Bridge, thence westward along and including the\r\n  north side of Little Layton-road, north side of New-road, north\r\n  side of Talbot-road, to Station-road, thence along and including\r\n  the east side of Station-road to Queen-street, thence along and\r\n  including the north side of Queen-street, Queen’s-square, across\r\n  the Promenade to the sea.\r\n\r\n  TALBOT WARD.\r\n\r\n  “Commencing at the Sea opposite the centre of Queen’s-square,\r\n  thence along and including the south side of Queen’s-square,\r\n  south side of Queen-street to Station-road, thence running along\r\n  and including the west side of Station-road to Talbot-road,\r\n  thence along and including the south side of the upper portion\r\n  of Talbot-road, south side of New-road, the south side of Little\r\n  Layton-road to the centre of Little Layton Bridge, thence along\r\n  the Dyke to the old township boundary, thence south-east by the\r\n  township boundary to the centre of Dykes-lane, thence westward\r\n  along and including the north side of Dykes-lane, the north side\r\n  of Layton-road, the north side of Raikes-road, the north side of\r\n  Raikes Hill, the north side of Church-street to Abingdon-street,\r\n  thence along and including the east side of Abingdon-street\r\n  to Birley-street, thence along and including the north side\r\n  of Birley-street, the north side of West-street, across the\r\n  Promenade to the Sea.\r\n\r\n  BANK HEY WARD.\r\n\r\n  “Commencing at the Sea opposite the centre of West-street, thence\r\n  along and including the south side of West-street, the south side\r\n  of Birley-street to Abingdon-street, thence along and including\r\n  the west side of Abingdon-street to Church-street, thence\r\n  along and including the south side of Church-street to Lower\r\n  King-street, thence along and including the west side of Lower\r\n  King-street to Adelaide-street, thence along and including the\r\n  north side of Adelaide-street, the north side of Adelaide-place,\r\n  across the Promenade to the Sea.\r\n\r\n  BRUNSWICK WARD.\r\n\r\n  “Commencing at the Sea opposite the centre of Adelaide-place,\r\n  thence along and including the south side of Adelaide-place,\r\n  the south side of Adelaide-street to Lower King-street, thence\r\n  along and including the east side of Lower King-street to\r\n  Church-street, thence along and including the south side of\r\n  Church-street, the south side of Raikes Hill, the south side\r\n  of Raikes-road, the south side of Layton-road, the south side\r\n  of Dykes-lane to the existing township boundary, thence along\r\n  the same boundary beyond the Whinney Heys, around the Belle\r\n  Vue Gardens, southward of Raikes Hall Gardens to the centre\r\n  of Revoe-road, thence along and including the north side of\r\n  Revoe-road, the north side of Chapel-street, across the Promenade\r\n  to the Sea.\r\n\r\n  FOXHALL WARD.\r\n\r\n  “Commencing at the Sea opposite to the end of Chapel-street,\r\n  thence along and including the south side of Chapel-street, the\r\n  south side of Revoe-road to the existing township boundary,\r\n  thence south-westerly, and thence south-easterly along the\r\n  same boundary to the centre of Cow Gap-lane, thence west along\r\n  and including the north side of Cow Gap-lane to Lytham-road,\r\n  thence along and including the east side of Lytham-road to\r\n  Alexandra-road, thence along and including the north side of\r\n  Alexandra-road, across the Promenade to the Sea.\r\n\r\n  WATERLOO WARD.\r\n\r\n  “Commencing at the Sea opposite the centre of Alexandra-road,\r\n  thence along and including the south side of Alexandra-road\r\n  to Lytham-road, thence along and including the west side of\r\n  Lytham-road to Cow Gap-lane, thence eastward, along and including\r\n  the south side of Cow Gap-lane to the existing township boundary,\r\n  thence south-easterly, along the same boundary on the easterly\r\n  side of Hawes Side-road, the north side of Layton-lane, across\r\n  the Blackpool and Lytham Railway to the Sea at Star Hills.”\r\n\r\nThe election of councillors took place at the date specified in the\r\ncharter, under the superintendence of Mr. William Porter, of Fleetwood\r\nand Blackpool, who had been nominated by the authorities of the town as\r\nreturning officer. On the 19th of April the gentlemen elected assembled\r\nin the old board-room and appointed aldermen and a mayor from amongst\r\nthemselves, the vacancies thus created being supplied by another appeal\r\nto the burgesses of those wards whose representatives had been elevated\r\nto the aldermanic bench.

No longer\r\nsolitary erections, or even small groups, but whole streets have been\r\nadded to the expanding area of the place, consisting of handsome and\r\nspacious edifices, of, indeed, notwithstanding their being situated to\r\nthe rear, exteriors which would, not many years ago, have been deemed\r\nhighly ornamental to the beach itself. In 1874 the south section of the\r\nnoble market-hall, on Hygiene Terrace, was being arranged and fitted\r\nup with roomy tanks to form an aquarium on a fairly large scale by W.\r\nH. Cocker, Esq., J.P., who had recently acquired the proprietorship of\r\nthe entire pile. The open space in front of the building was fenced in,\r\nand furnished with three tanks for seals, and other novel features to\r\nrender it attractive and pleasing. The walls of the interior were adorned\r\nwith landscapes in the spacious saloon, where the main tank, divided\r\ninto numerous compartments, each being supplied with a variety of fish\r\ndiffering from its neighbours, occupies a central position. Subsidiary\r\ntanks, filled with curious specimens of animated nature from the “vasty\r\ndeep,” stand in the entrance hall and recesses. The aquarium was opened\r\nto the public on the 17th of May, in the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of May, 1875, the foundation stone of a Primitive Methodist\r\nchapel was laid in Chapel Street by Mr. J. Fairhurst, of Wigan.\r\nHeretofore the members of that sect had met for religious purposes in a\r\nmission room located in Foxhall Road. The earliest service in the new\r\nchapel was conducted by the resident minister, the Rev. E. Newsome, on\r\nSunday, the 29th of the following August. The Unitarians have a chapel\r\nin Bank Street, which was formally opened by the Rev. J. R. Smith, of\r\nHyde, also in August, 1875. During the same month a number of influential\r\ngentlemen purchased the estate of Bank Hey from W. H. Cocker, esq., J.P.,\r\nfor £23,000, with the intention of converting it into Winter Gardens.\r\nPossession was gained, according to agreement, on the 1st of October. The\r\ndesign of the company is to place on the land a concert room, promenades,\r\nconservatories, and other accessories calculated to convert the estate\r\ninto a pleasant lounge, especially desirous during inclement days.\r\n\r\nAlthough South Shore is now intimately connected and associated with\r\nBlackpool as one town, there was a period, and not a very remote one,\r\nwhen it flourished as a separate and distinct hamlet, widely divided\r\nfrom its more imposing neighbour. The first house of South Shore was\r\nerected in 1819 by Mr. Thomas Moore, who speedily added about ten more\r\nto the solitary edifice. The growth of the village in earlier years was\r\nnot characterised by any great rapidity, and in 1830 the whole of the\r\nbuildings comprised no more than a thin row of respectable cottages\r\noverlooking the sea, with a lawn or promenade in front. In 1836 a church\r\nwas built, partly by subscription and partly from Queen Anne’s Bounty,\r\nand dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Twenty-two years afterwards, owing to\r\nthe development of South Shore through the number of regular visitants\r\nwho preferred the quietude of its beach to the greater animation which\r\nprevailed at Blackpool, the building was enlarged by the erection of\r\ntransepts and a new chancel, alterations which supplied further sitting\r\nroom for about 380 worshippers. The church is of brick, and contains a\r\nhandsome stained-glass east window, representing the baptism of Christ\r\nby St. John the Baptist, another ornamental window being inserted in\r\nthe south wall. The mural tablets are in memory of William Wilkinson,\r\n“who for twenty-five years was an indefatigable teacher in the Sunday\r\nSchools of Marton and South Shore,—he served his country in the battles\r\nof Talavera, Busaco, Albuera, Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nive, Nivelle, and\r\nToulouse,” died 11th September, 1853, aged 66 years; and of James\r\nMetcalf, “curate of South Shore, who departed this life July 24th, 1875,\r\naged 42 years, and was interred at the Parish Church of Bolton-le-Sands.”\r\nThe font is of grey stone, massive and carved. The first organ obtained\r\nby the congregation was purchased in 1847. In 1872 a tasteful lectern\r\nwas forwarded to the church by the Rev. J. B. Wakefield, to whom it had\r\nbeen presented by his parishioners, as a token of esteem, about the close\r\nof his ministry amongst them in 1870. The burial ground encircling the\r\nchurch of Holy Trinity contains no monuments of special interest, if we\r\nexcept a stone pedestal, surmounted by a broken column, erected by public\r\nsubscription to the memories of three fishermen, drowned off Cross-slack,\r\nwhilst following their avocation on the 11th of October, 1860.\r\n\r\n  PERPETUAL CURATES AND VICARS OF HOLY TRINITY.\r\n\r\n  ------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n    Date of   |      NAME.       |   On whose       |Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                  |  Presentation.   |\r\n  ------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n     1837     |G.

For four or five years the members\r\nof this denomination had met on the Sabbath in a small room in Bolton\r\nStreet, originally designed for a coach-house, and the necessity for\r\nmore suitable and extended accommodation through growing numbers had of\r\nlate pressed urgently upon the limited and not over wealthy assembly, so\r\nthat the generous offer of their townsman was gratefully appreciated.\r\nThe structure is in the Gothic style of architecture, about fifty feet\r\nin length and forty feet in width, with brick walls and stone facings,\r\nand will contain upwards of three hundred persons. Service was first\r\nheld in the new place of worship, styled the Ebenezer Wesleyan Chapel,\r\non Thursday, the 2nd of September, 1869, the officiating minister being\r\nthe Rev. W. H. Taylor, of Manchester. The room in Bolton Street was\r\nsubsequently converted into a Temperance Hall, and remained in that\r\ncapacity until the 30th of March, 1873, when it was appropriated as a\r\nmeeting-house by the Baptist sect. The progress of South Shore has not\r\nuntil the last two or three years been marked by that wonderful rapidity\r\nwhich has already been noticed whilst delineating the prosperous career\r\nof Blackpool. Nevertheless a steadily-increasing patronage was always\r\nextended to the milder climate of the village under consideration, from\r\nits earliest existence. Terraces of pretty and commodious residences\r\narose at intervals along the marine frontage, whilst elegant villas\r\nhave been erected both opposite the sea and nearer to the Lytham\r\nRoad. Building is at present (1876) being pushed forward with great\r\nactivity, houses springing up in endless succession along the sides of\r\nthoroughfares but recently mapped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH OF KIRKHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRKHAM. The township of Kirkham was probably the earliest inhabited\r\nlocality in the Fylde district; and although it is impossible to assert\r\nthat the very site of the present town was a spot fixed upon by the\r\nRomans for erecting their habitations, still as the road formed by those\r\npeople passed over it, and many remnants of their domestic utensils,\r\nfunereal urns, and other relics have been discovered in the surrounding\r\nsoil, there is strong presumptive evidence that an ancient settlement\r\nwas at least close at hand. Amongst the traces of the old warriors\r\ndisinterred in this neighbourhood may be mentioned a large quantity of\r\nstones prepared for building purposes, and numerous fragments of urns,\r\nploughed up about half a mile from Kirkham. The Mill Hill Field has\r\nalso disclosed frequent witnesses to the former presence of the Romans,\r\nnotably abundant specimens of their pottery and coinage, but perhaps the\r\ngreatest curiosity found in the vicinity is the boss or umbo of a shield,\r\nwrought in brass, which was removed from a brook in the field specified\r\nduring the year 1792. In form the shield is somewhat oval, having its\r\ncentral portion semi-globular, whilst the outer rim is flat. The entire\r\ndiameter is about eight inches, of which the embossment supplies five.\r\nThe horizontal and encircling part is perforated in four separate places,\r\napparently for the passage of thongs or rivets. The highest surface of\r\nthe boss holds the representation of a human figure seated, with an eagle\r\nto the left, the sides being adorned with an athlete respectively.\r\nBirds, swords, diminutive shields, etc., complete the decorations.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 418, when the Romans vacated the island, up to the\r\ncompilation of the Domesday Book by William the Conqueror in 1080-86, a\r\nperiod of over six and a half centuries, history preserves no record of\r\nany matter or event directly connected with the town, as distinct from\r\nthe Hundred in which it is situated. Nevertheless it is obvious that\r\nKirkham must have sprung into being some time during that protracted\r\nera, insomuch as it appears amongst the places existing in Amounderness\r\nin the Norman survey just indicated. The name is a compound derived from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and although the syllable “Kirk,” coming from\r\nthe latter, and signifying a church, could not have been in use until\r\nthose pirates first invaded the land in 787, and probably was not applied\r\nuntil the mistaken policy of Alfred the Great allowed them to colonise\r\nthis and other parts of Northumbria, one hundred years later, still it\r\nwould scarcely be justifiable to conclude that there was no dwelling or\r\nvillage here, as the Anglo-Saxon “ham” implies, anterior to that date.\r\nThe location of the place on the margin of an open thoroughfare, and the\r\nformer establishment of the Romans within or near to its boundaries,\r\nincline us rather to the opinion that from the earliest arrival of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons they had selected this site for the foundation of a\r\nsmall settlement, and that the “ham” or hamlet so created bore a purely\r\nSaxon title until the advent of the Danes, under whose influence the\r\northography became altered by the substitution from their vocabulary of\r\nthe word “kirk” for the one originally bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the condition of Kirkham at the Norman Conquest may be\r\ngleaned from the report concerning the Fylde in the Domesday Book,\r\nin which it is stated that of the 840 statute acres comprised in the\r\ntownship, only 400 (four carucates) were under cultivation, the rest\r\nbeing waste, that is, untilled, but very possibly in service as forage\r\nground for swine. At that period the town undoubtedly possessed a church,\r\none of the three mentioned in the record above-named, as standing in\r\nAmounderness, but the era of its erection is conjectural merely. The name\r\nof Kirkham, however,—the church hamlet,—is manifestly of ecclesiastical\r\norigin, and the Danish derivation of “kirk” implies that some religious\r\nbuilding existed there, very likely about the year 900, when that nation\r\ncolonised the district, but that a sacred edifice of some description\r\nhad been constructed long before may be deduced from the fact that\r\nChristianity had been pretty generally embraced by the Anglo-Saxons\r\ndwelling in this locality about the middle of the seventh century.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the Norman dominion the history of Kirkham\r\nrises out of the mist which has obscured its earlier ages, and we are\r\nenabled from the disclosures of ancient documents, to follow out its\r\ncareer in a more satisfactory manner. The church and tithes of Kirkham\r\nwere presented amongst other possessions, as a portion of the Hundred of\r\nAmounderness, by William the Conqueror to the baron Roger de Poictou, and\r\nwere conferred by that nobleman about the year 1100, on the priory of St.\r\nMary’s, Lancaster,[134]—a monastic institution founded by him from the\r\nAbbey of Sees in Normandy. This priory retained possession of the church\r\nfor only a few years, when it reverted to its former owner, and was\r\nbestowed by him on the convent of Shrewsbury, as shown by the charter of\r\nWilliam, archbishop of York, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “The monks of Salop in the day of my ancestors were often making\r\n  complaints that their church was unjustly robbed of the church\r\n  of Kirckaham, because it had been legally bestowed upon it by\r\n  Roger, count of Poictou, and confirmed by Thomas, archbishop, by\r\n  authority of grants under seal. At length they have come before\r\n  us to state their complaints; and we, thus constrained and by the\r\n  command of lord Henry, legate of the apostolical see, committed\r\n  their cause to be laid before the synod of York.”\r\n\r\nThe archbishop Thomas here mentioned died either in 1100 or 1113, whilst\r\nWilliam, the writer of the charter, died in 1154. The York tribunal\r\ndecided, after seeing the writings touching the confirmation of the grant\r\nof the church of Kirkham to the Shrewsbury convent, which the monks of\r\nSalop had sealed with the seal of Thomas, the archbishop, that “the\r\naforesaid church should be restored to the church of Peter of Salop.”\r\n\r\nIn 1195 “a great controversy arose between Theobald Walter, on the one\r\npart, and the abbot of Shrewsbury, on the other, concerning the right\r\nof patronage of the church, which was thus settled: a certain fine was\r\nlevied in the king’s court that the abbot and his successors should\r\nreceive from the church of Kirkham a pension of twelve marks a year,\r\nand Theobald himself should for ever remain the true Patron of the said\r\nchurch.”[135]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Theobald Walter, king John, who had the guardianship\r\nof that nobleman’s heir, gave two parts of the church to Simon\r\nBlund,[136] and later, in 1213, he bestowed the church upon W. Gray,\r\nchancellor, for life.[137] Edward I. conferred the advowson of the church\r\nof Kirkham upon the abbey of Vale Royal, a monastic house founded by him\r\nin Cheshire; but the grant was not made without strenuous opposition on\r\nthe part of Sir Theobald Walter or le Botiler,[138] a descendant of the\r\nTheobald specified above, who maintained that the king had no legal right\r\nto the advowson, which belonged to him as heir-at-law and descendant\r\nof Theobald Walter, the first. A council assembled to investigate the\r\nrival claims, and Edward, having asserted that his father, Henry III.,\r\nhad granted the advowson to his clerk by right of his crown, and not\r\nthrough any temporary power he had as guardian of Theobald Walter’s heir,\r\na statement which Le Botiler’s attorney either could not or would not\r\ngainsay, the advowson was adjudged to him, and Sir Theobald lay under\r\nmercy.[139] This dispute probably occurred in the 8th year of Edward’s\r\nsovereignty, 1280, for we find from the Rot. Chart. that at that date the\r\nadvowson was granted by the monarch to the abbey of Vale Royal.\r\n\r\nIn 1286 Sir Otto de Grandison, who was ambassador at the apostolic see,\r\nobtained a bull from the pope, Honorius IV., by which the advowson of\r\nKirkham was conferred upon the abbey of Vale Royal for ever,[140] and on\r\nthe 27th of January in the ensuing year, Edward I. confirmed his former\r\ngrant.[141]\r\n\r\nIn the fifty-fourth year of the reign of Henry III., 1269, power was\r\ngranted by royal charter to the manorial lord of Kirkham to hold a\r\nmarket and fair,[142] and as such privileges were allowed at that time\r\nto only a few other towns in the whole county of Lancashire, we must\r\nconclude that even at such an early date Kirkham possessed some special\r\nadvantages or interest to be able so successfully to press its claims\r\nto this signal favour. That such important powers as the holding of\r\nmarkets and fairs were not allowed to be exercised without due and proper\r\nauthority is proved by a warrant which was issued twenty-three years\r\nlater, in the reign of Edward I., against the abbot of Vale Royal, to\r\nwhich convent the manor of Kirkham belonged, to appear before a judicial\r\ncourt to show by what authority he held those periodical assemblies of\r\nthe inhabitants. He pleaded that the right had been first conceded to\r\nhis predecessors by Henry III., and that subsequently the grant had been\r\nconfirmed by the present monarch, Edward I., in the fifteenth year of his\r\ndominion. These assertions having been verified, the abbot was exculpated\r\nfrom all blame, and orders were issued to the justices itinerant in this\r\ncounty to the effect that they were in no way to interfere with the\r\nexercise of those privileges, which were to be continued exactly as they\r\nhad been heretofore.[143] From a copy of a document[144] framed four\r\nyears later, in 1296, in which the whole of these rights are embodied\r\namongst other interesting matters, we learn that the manor of Kirkham\r\nwas granted to the abbot and convent of Vale Royal in _frank-al-moigne_,\r\nthat is, a tenure by which a religious corporation holds lands for\r\nthemselves and their successors for ever, on condition of praying for\r\nthe soul of the donor; that power was given or confirmed to hold a fair\r\nof five days duration at the Nativity of St. John the Baptist; that\r\nthe borough of Kirkham, which had been incorporated by the name of the\r\nburgesses of Kirkham in the year 1282, the tenth of the reign of Edward\r\nI., was to be a free borough; that the burgesses and their heirs were\r\nto have a free guild, with all the liberties which belonged to a free\r\nborough; that there was to be in the borough a pillory, a prison, and a\r\nducking stool, and other instruments for the punishment of evil doers;\r\nand that there were to be assizes of bread and ale, and weights and\r\nmeasures. Continuing the perusal of this document we find that the abbot\r\nof Vale Royal consented that the burgesses should elect two bailiffs\r\nfrom amongst themselves annually, and that these should be presented and\r\nsworn; on the other hand, however, the convent reserved to itself the\r\nperquisites arising from the courts, stallage, assizes of bread and ale,\r\netc., and annual rents due at the period of festival legally appointed as\r\nabove. The names of the following gentlemen are appended to the deed as\r\nwitnesses:—Radulphus de Mouroyd, William le Botyler, Robert de Holonde,\r\nHenry de Kytheleye, John Venyal, William de Clifton, Thomas Travers, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn 1327 an edict was published by the dean of Amounderness in the church\r\nof Kirkham on behalf of the archbishop of York, which commanded that\r\nthe abbot or some one connected with the convent of Vale Royal, should\r\nappear before that prelate at the cathedral of his see on “the third\r\nlawful day after the Sunday on which is sung _Quasi modo genite vira\r\net munimenta_,”[145] to show by what right and authority the Cheshire\r\nconvent held the church just mentioned. In answer to this summons a monk,\r\nnamed Walter Wallensis, from Vale Royal, appeared before the archbishop\r\non the day named, in 1328, and produced in proof of the title of his\r\nmonastery to the church, the charter of Edward I., the bull of the pope,\r\nand letters from several archdeacons, recognising the proprietorship\r\nof the convent. In addition he brought four witnesses, viz., William\r\nde Cotton, advocate in the court of York, who stated that for eighteen\r\nyears the abbot and convent of Vale Royal had supplied the rectors to\r\nthe church of Kirkham; John de Bradkirk, who said that he had known the\r\nchurch for forty years as a parishioner, and had on many occasions seen\r\nthe charter confirming the grant of the advowson, etc., to Vale Royal,\r\nas for fifteen years he had been in the service of that monastery, and\r\nat the time when the present archbishop of York farmed the church of\r\nKirkham, twelve years ago, from the convent of Vale Royal, had been the\r\nbearer of the money raised from this church to that dignitary at York;\r\nRobert de Staneford, of Kirkham, who gave similar evidence, and bore\r\nwitness to the existence of the charter of Edward I., which he had seen;\r\nand Robert de Blundeston, of Vale Royal, who gave evidence as to the\r\ngenuineness of the documents produced having been admitted by Roger de\r\nNasynton, public notary, etc. The result of these attestations was that\r\nthe case was dismissed against the abbot of Vale Royal, and his right to\r\nthe church of Kirkham, with all its chapels, fruits, rents, etc, allowed\r\nto have been fully proved.[146]\r\n\r\nIn 1334 a mandamus was issued by Edward III., at York, to Robert Foucher,\r\nthe sheriff of Lancashire, stating that, contrary to a charter of Edward\r\nI., which prohibited the sheriffs from making distraints on the rectors\r\nof churches or on estates with which the churches had been endowed,\r\nhe had “under pretext of his office lately entered into the lands and\r\ntenements near Kirkham, which are of the endowment of that church,\r\nand had heavily distrained the abbot of Vale Royal, parson of that\r\nchurch”; and ordering the said sheriff to abandon the claim, and to make\r\nrestitution of anything he might thus have illegally obtained, and “by no\r\nmeans to attempt to make any distraint in the lands and tenements which\r\nare of the endowment of the aforesaid church,” at any future time.[147]\r\n\r\nSomewhere about the year 1332 a monk, named Adam de Clebury, who held the\r\ntemporalities of Shrewsbury Abbey, sued Peter, the abbot of Vale Royal,\r\nfor five hundred marks, which he declared were the accumulated arrears\r\nof twelve marks, ordered to be paid annually by Theobald Walter, to the\r\nformer monastery, out of the funds of the church of Kirkham, according\r\nto the issue of a trial in the king’s court, between Theobald and the\r\nconvent of Shrewsbury, respecting the advowson, etc., of that church in\r\n1195. Peter is said, in the Harleian manuscript, from which this account\r\nis taken, to have “redeemed that writ and many others from the sheriff\r\nof Lancashire,” from which it may be understood that he had paid the\r\nsum demanded, or in some conciliatory way settled the case during his\r\nlifetime, for we hear no more of the matter until shortly after his death\r\nin 1342, when an action to enforce a similar payment was brought against\r\nhis successor, Robert de Cheyneston. This ecclesiastic, however, is said\r\nto “have manfully opposed the abbot of Shrewsbury,” and to have journied\r\nup to London to hold an interview with him on the subject, at which,\r\nafter “many allegations on each side, he gave to the abbot of Shrewsbury\r\n£100 to pay his labours and expenses,” and in that manner the dispute\r\nwas brought to a termination about the year 1343.\r\n\r\nIn 1337 Sir William de Clifton, of Westby, made an offer to the abbot of\r\nVale Royal to purchase certain tithes from him for twenty marks, and on\r\nthe ecclesiastic refusing to entertain this proposition, the indignant\r\nknight became most unruly and outrageous in his conduct, as shown by the\r\nfollowing charge which was that year preferred against him by the abbot,\r\nwho stated:—\r\n\r\n  “That he had thrust with a lance at a brother of the monastery\r\n  in the presence of the abbot and convent; that he had retained\r\n  twenty marks which he was pledged and bound to pay to the abbot,\r\n  in order to weary him with expenses and labours; that it was the\r\n  custom, from time immemorial, for the parishioners of Kirkham to\r\n  convey their tithe-corn to their barns, and there keep it until\r\n  the ministers of the rector came for it; but that he (Sir William\r\n  Clifton), in contempt of the church, had allowed his tithes and\r\n  those of his tenants to waste and rot in the fields, and very\r\n  often by force and arms had driven away the tithe-collectors;\r\n  he also had compelled a cart of the rector, laden with hay,\r\n  to remain on his land for upwards of a month, and in derision\r\n  had made the rector’s mare into a hunting palfrey; he also had\r\n  neglected to keep the tithes of his calves, pigeons, orchards,\r\n  huntings, and hawkings, and would not allow the procurator, under\r\n  threat of death, to enter his estate, but he and his satellites\r\n  had irreverently burst into the sanctuary of God, where they\r\n  had assailed the priests and clerks, and impeded them in the\r\n  discharge of their duties. Moreover the aforesaid knight would\r\n  not permit any of his tenants who were living in flagrant sin, to\r\n  be corrected or punished by the ordinaries.”[148]\r\n\r\nIn concluding the above list of misdemeanours, the abbot complained that\r\nSir William had ordered a severe flagellation “even to the effusion of\r\nblood,” to be inflicted on Thomas, the clerk, in the town of Preston, and\r\nthat this scourging had taken place as directed, in the presence of the\r\nunder-mentioned gentlemen, who seemed to have been well pleased with the\r\nvigorous measures adopted by the knight, and to have rendered him willing\r\nassistance when called upon:—\r\n\r\n  Richard de Plumpton,\r\n  Nicholas Catford,\r\n  William the provost,\r\n  William Jordan, junr.,\r\n  John Dence,\r\n  Robert Carter,\r\n  John Garleigh,\r\n  Richard de Tresale,\r\n  Henry de Tresale,\r\n  William Sictore,\r\n  William Sictore, junr.,\r\n  Adam de Scales,\r\n  Richard Walker,\r\n  John Mydelar,\r\n  Henry Thillon,\r\n  William Randell,\r\n  John de Reste,\r\n  William de Morhouse,\r\n  Thomas Adekoe,\r\n  Adam del Wodes,\r\n  William de Mydelar,\r\n  Thomas de Wytacres,\r\n  And several others, including Adam, the harper.\r\n\r\nThis charge was laid before the lord abbot of Westminster by the abbot\r\nof Vale Royal, and the former, after hearing the statement of offences,\r\ncommanded that Sir William de Clifton and others enumerated therein,\r\nshould appear before him to answer for their misdeeds; but as neither\r\nSir William nor any of his friends and abettors took the least notice\r\nof the summons, it was decided that an endeavour should be made to\r\narrange the quarrel by arbitration. To this the knight seems to have been\r\nfavourable, and nominated William Laurence, John de Crofton, and Robert\r\nMareys to act as his arbitrators; whilst those of the abbot were William\r\nBaldreston, rector of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre; Robert Baldreston, his\r\nbrother, and a rector also; and Richard de Ewyas, a monk of Deulacres.\r\nThe decision of the court thus constituted was that Sir William de\r\nClifton should acknowledge his guilt, and ask pardon and absolution for\r\nthe same from the abbot, unto whose will and grace he should submit\r\nhimself; in addition the knight was ordered to pay a fine of twenty\r\nmarks, and make good to the abbot the tithes which he had destroyed or\r\nrefused to pay. Sir William accepted the verdict, and bound himself to\r\nfulfil its conditions by oath; the rest were required to enter into a\r\npromise to abstain in future from making any attempt to injure the church\r\nof Kirkham, or anything connected with it, and to provide a large wax\r\ncandle, which was paraded round that church on the feast of palms, and\r\nafterwards presented as a peace-offering to St. Michael.[149]\r\n\r\nIn 1357 Cardinal John Thoresby, archbishop of York, made a new ordination\r\nof the vicarage of Kirkham, by which it was decreed that, instead of\r\nthe secular vicar appointed aforetime, the abbot and convent of Vale\r\nRoyal should select some one from their own monastery to fill the\r\noffice whenever a vacancy occurred. By this fresh regulation the abbot\r\nand convent of Vale Royal were bound to pay to the vicar forty marks\r\nper annum, and he on his part was pledged to keep the parsonage house\r\nin proper repair and perform all ecclesiastical duties. Three years\r\nafterwards a vicar of Kirkham was charged and convicted of having been\r\nguilty of maladministration in his position as dean of Amounderness, but\r\nsubsequently he received a full pardon from King Edward III.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1401, during the reign of Henry IV., the right to hold a\r\nmarket and fair was again confirmed to the abbot and convent of Vale\r\nRoyal; subjoined is a translated copy of the grant, which bore the date\r\nof the 2nd of July:—\r\n\r\n  “The king to all men greeting: We have inspected a charter made\r\n  by our progenitor, Lord Edward, formerly king of England, in\r\n  these words:—‘Edward, by the grace of God king of England, lord\r\n  of Ireland, and duke of Aquitaine, to the archbishops, bishops,\r\n  abbots, priors, earls, barons, justices, sheriffs, provosts,\r\n  ministers, and to all his bailiffs and subjects, health. Know\r\n  that we have granted and by this our present charter confirm\r\n  to our beloved in Christ the Abbot and Convent of Vale Royal,\r\n  that they and their successors for ever shall have a market in\r\n  each week on Thursday at their manor at Kirkham in the county\r\n  of Lancaster, and also in each year a fair at the same town of\r\n  five days duration, that is on the vigil, on the Day, and on the\r\n  morrow of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, and on the two\r\n  days succeeding; unless the market and fair be found injurious to\r\n  neighbouring markets and fairs. Therefore we desire and firmly\r\n  enjoin, both for ourselves and our heirs, that the aforesaid\r\n  Abbot and Convent and their successors for ever shall have the\r\n  aforesaid market and fair at the aforesaid manor with all the\r\n  liberties and free customs appertaining to similar institutions,\r\n  unless such market and fair be detrimental to neighbouring\r\n  interests as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n  “‘These being witnesses:—The venerable fathers Robert Bath and\r\n  Wells, John Winchester, and Anthony Durham, bishops; William\r\n  de Valence, our uncle; Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln; master\r\n  Henry de Newark, archdeacon of Richmond; master William de\r\n  Luda, archdeacon of Durham; master William de Cornere, dean of\r\n  Wymburne; John de St. John; William de Latymer; and others.\r\n\r\n  “‘Given under our hand at Bourdeaux on the 21st of January, in\r\n  the 15th year of our reign.’\r\n\r\n  “Holding the aforesaid charter and all matters contained in it\r\n  as authentic and acceptable both for ourselves and our heirs,\r\n  as far as our power extends, we accept, approve, grant, and\r\n  confirm to our beloved in Christ, the present Abbot and Convent\r\n  of the aforesaid place and their successors that the aforesaid\r\n  charter be considered just, also we affirm that the same Abbot\r\n  and Convent and their predecessors legally had and held the said\r\n  market and fair before this date.\r\n\r\n  “In testimony thereof, etc. Witness the king at Westminster on\r\n  the 2nd of July.”[150]\r\n\r\nAt the dissolution of monasteries the manor of Kirkham, together with\r\nthe advowson of the church, was transferred by Henry VIII. from the\r\nabbot and convent of Vale Royal to the dean and chapter of Christ Church,\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nIn 1560 Queen Elizabeth ratified and confirmed by letters patent all\r\nformer charters concerning Kirkham by a deed bearing the date of July\r\n2nd; and later, in 1619, the 17th year of the reign of James I., a record\r\nof the Duchy Court of Lancaster states that the bailiffs and burgesses\r\nof Kirkham presented a petition praying that they might elect into their\r\ngovernment some men of account dwelling near the town, and that it might\r\nbe declared that the bailiffs had lawful power and authority to correct\r\nall malefactors and offenders according to the laws and liberties of\r\nthe town, and to do and perform all other duties appertaining to their\r\noffice. They prefaced their prayer by asserting that “the town of Kirkham\r\nhad been used as an ancient market town and that the inhabitants thereof\r\nhad time out of mind been accounted a Corporation, incorporated by the\r\nname of Bailiffs and Burgesses, and that of late owing to some of the\r\nbailiffs being but simple and weak men, and the inhabitants but poor\r\nand numerous, it had been found impossible to govern in a proper and\r\nsatisfactory manner the large confluences of people at fair and market\r\nseasons,” for which reason they were desirous of gaining an extension\r\nof their existing powers as set forth in the plea. The court decreed\r\nthat “the then Bailiffs of Kirkham and the Burgesses of the same, and\r\ntheir successors, for ever, should and might from thenceforth have and\r\nenjoy their ancient usages and liberties by the name of the Bailiffs and\r\nBurgesses of the Town of Kirkham, and that the Bailiffs should yearly\r\nbe chosen out of the Burgesses according to the said usages, or as they\r\nin their discretion should think meet, for the better government of the\r\nsaid Town and the people thereunto resorting, also that the Bailiffs,\r\nBurgesses, and Inhabitants should be guildable, and have in the said Town\r\na prison, etc., as had been heretofore, and that the Dean and Chapter and\r\ntheir successors, farmers, and tenants, should and might from henceforth\r\nhave all their fairs, markets, liberties, privileges, jurisdictions,\r\nCourt Leets, Court Barons, Courts of Pleas, and the Fair Court, as\r\nheretofore had been.” The foregoing was ordered to be read in the parish\r\nchurch on the ensuing sabbath, and also in the market place.\r\n\r\nFrom the following ancient and somewhat lengthy document or lease, much\r\ninteresting matter may be gleaned, and for that reason it was deemed\r\nbetter to give it unabridged:—\r\n\r\n  “To all Christian people to whom this present writing shall\r\n  come the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Church of Christ of\r\n  King Henry the eighth’s foundation do send greeting in our Lord\r\n  God everlasting: Whereas we the said Dean and Chapter by our\r\n  Indenture of Lease, sealed with our common Seal, bearing date\r\n  the sixteenth day of July, in the three and fortieth year of\r\n  the reign of our sovereign lady Elizabeth (1601), late Queen of\r\n  England, &c., did, as much as in us was, demise, grant, and to\r\n  farm, lett unto Thomas ffleetwood, of Caldwich, in the County of\r\n  Stafford, esquire, all our Court Leets and view of franchpledge\r\n  within our parsonage and manor of Kirkham, in the County of\r\n  Lancaster, or in either of them, or to, or with them, or either\r\n  of them used, occupied, incident, or belonging appertaining,\r\n  with all and every thing (singular) there appertaining,\r\n  also the keeping of the Court Barons there, and all waifs,\r\n  strays, treasure trove, deodands, felons’ and outlaws’ goods,\r\n  forfeitures, fines, amercements, serving and executing of writs\r\n  and processes, and all royalties, liberties, perquisites and\r\n  profits of Court Leets, all commodities and advantages whatsoever\r\n  to the same Court Leets incident, due, or in any wise belonging,\r\n  or which heretofore have been, or of right ought to have been,\r\n  had and enjoyed by us, the said Dean and Chapter, or any of our\r\n  predecessors, or any other person or persons by or by means of\r\n  our estate, right, or title to the same or any part thereof, in\r\n  as large and ample manner as we, the said Dean and Chapter, or\r\n  our successors, may or ought to have or enjoy, together also with\r\n  the Stewardship, office of Steward, or authority for appointing\r\n  the Steward for the keeping of the said Courts;

In Witness whereof we, the said Dean\r\n  and Chapter, have hereunto put our common Seal. Proven in our\r\n  Chapter house at Oxford the fourth day of December in the years\r\n  of the reign of our sovereign lord James, by the Grace of God\r\n  king of England, Scotland, ffrance, and Ireland, Defender of the\r\n  Faith, &c.—That is to say, of England, ffrance, and Ireland the\r\n  eleventh, and of Scotland the seven and fortieth.”[151]\r\n\r\nThere is an old deed in the bailiffs’ chest, bearing the date 1725, and\r\nevidently a summary of charters, powers, etc., drawn up in order to be\r\nsubmitted to the inspection of some legal authority, whose opinions\r\non different points are appended, from which it appears that from\r\nthe earliest incorporation of the town it had been governed by two\r\nbailiffs and twelve burgesses in common council assembled, who were\r\nannually chosen within the borough, and that they “usually assessed\r\nsuch persons, not being free burgesses in the same borough, as had come\r\ninto and exercised trades within the borough (whether they had served\r\napprenticeships to such trades or not), in and with such reasonable\r\nannual payments to the Corporation as the bailiffs and burgesses thought\r\nfit”; persons born in the borough were treated in a similar manner. The\r\nbailiffs inflicted penalties on all breakers of the peace, the amount of\r\nfine imposed being regulated according to the condition of the offender,\r\nthus an esquire was mulcted in 40s., a gentleman 10s., and anyone of an\r\ninferior grade 5s. Profane cursing and swearing also came under their\r\njurisdiction. The collection of freedom money from traders commencing\r\nbusiness in Kirkham was a somewhat questionable act on the part of the\r\nlocal rulers, and indeed they themselves were evidently troubled with\r\ndoubts as to their right to levy the tax, for the muniment chest contains\r\nseveral opinions of eminent counsel as to the validity of such a course.\r\nIn 1738 a person named William Marsden started as a tanner in Kirkham,\r\nand obstinately refused to purchase his freedom or close his premises,\r\nbut, at the end of twelve months, the assembled bailiffs and burgesses\r\ninstructed and authorised the town or borough serjeant to collect and\r\nlevy the sum of two shillings and sixpence upon the goods and chattels of\r\nWilliam Marsden, by distress and sale. This impost was abolished during\r\nthe latter half of the eighteenth century. The bailiffs formed part of\r\nthe Court Leet held annually in the seventeenth century and were elected\r\nfrom amongst the jurors. Subjoined are a few extracts from the minute\r\nbook of the “Court leet of frank pledge of yᵉ foundation of Henry VIII.,”\r\nas it is styled in one place:—\r\n\r\n  “Oct. 1681.\r\n\r\n  The court leet houlden at Kirkham yᵉ day above written by Tho.\r\n  Hodgkinson Stuart.\r\n\r\n  “Juriars\r\n\r\n  James Smith, junior.\r\n  John Hanson.\r\n  Geffery Wood.\r\n  James Lawson.\r\n  Tho.

Given\r\n  under our Common Seal of the Towne this first Day of December,\r\n  1728.”\r\n\r\nAt a later period the burgesses neglected to choose and appoint bailiffs\r\nfor many years, or to use their privileges; and apprehensive at length\r\nthat such remissions were tantamount to a forfeiture of their charter\r\nby their own act, they determined to take legal advice as to the most\r\nexpeditious way to resume their powers. It was given as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “If any of those acting Burgesses are alive I would advise them\r\n  to assemble at their former Gild or usual Place of meeting, and\r\n  then and there choose other Burgesses, after which they may elect\r\n  from among them Two Bailiffs and make an entry of such choice\r\n  in one of the Old Books, and then proceed as formerly to act\r\n  in their corporate capacity; and let their first Punishment be\r\n  inflicted on some person unlikely to dispute their authority, for\r\n  instance a woman drunkard may be set in the stocks.\r\n\r\n  “Having done as above directed they may for the better Government\r\n  of the town make some Byelaws, and enter them ffair into a Book\r\n  to be kept for that purpose, but let none of these new Laws be\r\n  put in Execution till they are confirmed by the Chancelour, and\r\n  that will be some foundation ffor a petition to that Court.\r\n\r\n  “But if all the Burgesses are dead I can see no Remedy whatsoever\r\n  but by obtaining a new Charter, which will be very Difficult if\r\n  not Impracticable.”\r\n\r\nA statement as to manorial extent of Kirkham at the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century is preserved amongst the records of a court, further\r\nreference to which will be made anon, and reads as here given:—“The lands\r\nlying within the manor of Kirkham, belonging to the Dean and Chapter\r\nof Christ Church, in Oxford, and to the burgesses inhabitants of the\r\nborough of Kirkham, are bounded east by the lands of Edward Robinson and\r\nGeorge Brown, lying within Newton and Scales; westward by the lands of\r\nSir Thomas Clifton, within Westby, and the lands of Christopher Parker,\r\nesq., lying in Ribby with Wrea; northwards by the lands of Mrs. Dorʸ.\r\nWestby, of Mowbreck, and the lands of Mr. Edward Fleetwood, of Wesham;\r\nand southwards by the lands of Mr. George Sharples, of Freckleton.”\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the manor was conveyed by the authorities\r\nat Oxford to Thomas Fleetwood as fee-farmer in 1601, and that the lease\r\nwas subsequently renewed or confirmed to his son and heir Sir Richard\r\nFleetwood. Before 1700, however, probably about 1650, from the contents\r\nof a petition presented by the inhabitants to the dean and chapter in\r\n1705, the Cliftons, of Lytham, had the manor in a tenure similar to\r\nthat of their predecessors, and held each year, in the month of June,\r\na court leet, at which the two bailiffs were elected. The late Thomas\r\nLangton Birley, esq., of Carr Hill, Kirkham, acquired the lordship by\r\npurchase a short time previous to his death in 1874, when it descended\r\nto his son and heir, Henry Langton Birley, esq. Bailiffs still continue\r\nto be annually appointed, and have in their hands several charitable\r\nbequests, the interest arising therefrom being devoted to the service of\r\nthe poor of the township, either in the form of alms, or in maintaining\r\nsome useful convenience, as the parish pump, for their benefit. The\r\nproperty at present belonging to the bailiffs consists of one meadow,\r\nsituated behind the Roman Catholic church; a garden in front of the same\r\nedifice; a plot in the field called the “Iron Latch”; and a pew in the\r\nparish church of Kirkham. In 1676 the bishop of Chester acceded to a\r\npetition from the minister and churchwardens that a wainscot might be\r\nplaced so as to enclose the bailiffs’ pew, “which seat, for want thereof,\r\nwas pressed into and thronged by others to the disturbance of the said\r\nofficers.”[152]\r\n\r\nThe Moot Hall, in which all business relating to the town was transacted,\r\nstood in the Market-place until about the year 1790, when it was\r\naccidentally burnt down. This building was erected in two stories, the\r\nupper of which was divided into a small room, used for flax dressing\r\nat the time the Hall was destroyed, and a larger one, devoted to court\r\nmeetings and other public matters, which was separated from the remainder\r\nof the edifice insomuch as it could only be entered from the outside by\r\nmeans of a flight of stone steps. The ground floor or lower story was\r\nconverted into shops in the occupation of tradesmen of the town. The\r\noriginal borough seal, which still exists, although somewhat defective,\r\nrepresents a dove bearing an olive branch in its beak. Notwithstanding\r\nthat Kirkham was made a borough, during the last years of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, it never appears upon any occasion to have returned a Member\r\nof Parliament, and it may safely be conjectured that no writ for that\r\npurpose was ever issued to the burgesses, as the sheriffs exercised\r\na discretionary power in such matters, and consequently only those\r\nboroughs, whose inhabitants seemed affluent enough to support the\r\nexpenses of an election, were selected for the honour, amongst which it\r\nis scarcely likely Kirkham would be classed.\r\n\r\nA market cross stood in the centre of the town, near to the ancient Moot\r\nHall, about the beginning of this century, but has now, like the stocks,\r\nwhich originally had their place in the churchyard and afterwards were\r\nremoved to a more public site, been long numbered amongst the memories\r\nof a past and less refined age. There is no allusion to a whipping post\r\nin any of the old documents, but we have the authority of a gentleman\r\nwho witnessed the spectacle, that a man was publicly whipped in the\r\nMarket-place fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe “Thirty Sworn men of Kirkham” was the name given to a council which\r\ntook cognizance of parochial affairs, and of certain matters connected\r\nwith the church, amongst other things appointing the churchwardens. This\r\nassembly was composed of representatives from the different sections of\r\nthe parish, two persons being elected from each of the fifteen townships\r\nas under:—\r\n\r\n“Thirty Sworn Men in 1570.\r\n\r\n  Kirkham:\r\n    James Baine.\r\n    James Clayton.\r\n\r\n  Clifton:\r\n    William Porter.\r\n    Tho. Cardwell.\r\n\r\n  Freckleton:\r\n    Henʳʸ Colbron.\r\n    Rich. Browne.\r\n\r\n  Singletons:\r\n    James Davy.\r\n    Wᵐ Smith\r\n\r\n  Larbrick:\r\n    Robt. Johnson.\r\n    Will.

Porter.\r\n\r\n  Hambleton:\r\n    Robt. Bradshaw.\r\n    Wᵐ Bamber.”\r\n\r\nThe oath taken by the “Sworn men” was administered by the civil\r\nauthorities, and their tenure of office was for life, or until they\r\nthought proper to resign. The origin of “Sworn men,” or at least of the\r\nname, dates from the fourteenth century, and the institution itself seems\r\nto have been common in this part of Lancashire; Preston, Lancaster,\r\nGarstang, and Goosnargh, having had assemblies bearing similar titles and\r\nperforming similar duties, but consisting only of twenty-four men each.\r\n\r\nIn 1636 a serious dispute arose between the Thirty-men and the vicar,\r\nthe Rev. Edward Fleetwood, owing to the latter requiring the council to\r\nsubscribe to the following conditions:—\r\n\r\n  “1st. They shall lay no gauld themselves without the consent of\r\n  the vicar.\r\n\r\n  2nd. That the vicar shall have a negative voice in all their\r\n  proceedings, and that they shall determine nothing without the\r\n  consent of the said vicar.\r\n\r\n  3rd. They shall not put or elect any new 30-men without the\r\n  vicar’s consent.\r\n\r\n  4th. They shall not meet in the church upon any business\r\n  whatever, unless they acquaint the vicar before.\r\n\r\n  5th. If there be any turbulent or factious person, that the rest\r\n  of the company shall join with the vicar and turn him out.”[153]\r\n\r\nOn the Thirty-men refusing to comply with his request, the vicar excluded\r\nthem “by violence” from their usual meeting-place in the church,\r\nand on the 5th of November, 1638, when they were called upon by the\r\nchurchwardens to attend there in order to lay the necessary taxes for the\r\nrepair of the sacred edifice, then much decayed, Mr. Fleetwood “locked\r\nhimself in the church, as before he had many times done,” and compelled\r\nthem to conduct their business without the building.\r\n\r\nIncensed at the persistent hostility of the vicar an appeal against his\r\nconduct was made by the “men” to the archbishop of York, and by him\r\nreferred to the bishop of Chester, who replied:—“That the corporation or\r\ncompany of 30-men, not having any warranty from the king, was nothing\r\nin law; but if the parish or township did delegate the power to the\r\n30-men as to church matters, then their acts relating thereunto were as\r\neffectual and binding as if they had the king’s sanction; and wishing to\r\nknow the affection of the parishioners on this head, he issued an order\r\non 22 Nov. 1638, that public notice shᵈ be given in the church for all\r\nthe parishioners to meet and give their voices whether they chose that\r\nthe custom of the 30-men representing the whole parish two for every\r\ntownship, should continue, or they should be dissolved.”[154]\r\n\r\nMr. Fleetwood having ignored this order, the churchwardens took upon\r\nthemselves the duty of calling a general conference of the parishioners;\r\na great multitude assembled in the churchyard, where the meeting was\r\nheld, the vicar having locked the church door, and declared in favour of\r\ntheir ancient custom being continued and preserved to their posterity as\r\nit had come down to them, freely giving “their power and strength to the\r\nsaid 30-men, to confer and determine all church matters.”\r\n\r\nTo this resolution were appended the signatures of four hundred and\r\nninety-four persons, amongst whom were Thomas Clifton of Westby and\r\nClifton, John Westby of Mowbreck, Thomas Hesketh of Mains, Edward Veale\r\nof Whinney Heys, John Parker of Bradkirk, and Edward Bradley of Bryning.\r\n\r\nThe bishop of Chester, having received an official report of the result\r\nof the meeting, communicated with the archbishop of York, as below\r\nstated:—\r\n\r\n                                     “Chester palace, 14 Dec. 1638.\r\n\r\n  “Seeing the vicar (whom I have used with all gentleness and\r\n  lenity), continues still in his contempt, and addeth daily more\r\n  forwardness thereunto, I must return the petitioners to my lord’s\r\n  grace of York, to be ordered by the high commissioner according\r\n  to his grace’s intimation signified in his.... I wish well to the\r\n  sillie wilful man, but he makes himself incapable thereof.\r\n\r\n                                           “John Cestriensis.”[155]\r\n\r\nThis effort to obtain redress for their grievances does not appear to\r\nhave been attended with a success equal to the expectations of the\r\n“thirty,” for a little later they instituted a suit in the consistory\r\ncourt at Chester against the vicar, “and, having proved their practice\r\ngood, had sentence against him and £20 7s. 6d. allowed towards their\r\nexpenses.”[156] The “Thirty-men” were admitted into the church on Easter\r\nTuesday, 1639.\r\n\r\nDuring the period that Edward Fleetwood was vicar of Kirkham an event\r\noccurred in the parish which furnishes a forcible example of the\r\nsuperstitious feeling in religious matters existing amongst all ranks of\r\nthe people at that time. The whole of the details of the circumstance\r\nare embodied in a pamphlet entitled “Strange Signs from Heaven,” and by\r\nway of an introduction, the tract contains this certificate, “under the\r\nhand of Mr. Edward Fleetwood, minister of Kirkham parish in Lancashire,\r\nconcerning the monster brought forth by Mrs. Haughton, a papist, living\r\nin that parish:—\r\n\r\n  “As we must tell no lie, so we should conceal no truth;\r\n  especially when it tends to God’s glory: There was a great\r\n  papist, and of great parentage, within the parish of Kirkham,\r\n  and his wife’s mother, being of the same religion, did usually\r\n  scoff and mock the Roundheads, and, in derision of Mr. Prinne\r\n  and others, cut off the cat’s ears, and called it by his name:\r\n  But behold an example of the justice and equity of God in his\r\n  judgements; as Adonibezec was repaid in his own kind; Haman\r\n  hanged upon the same gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai;\r\n  and Pharoah and all his host drowned in the sea, into which he\r\n  had thought to have driven the Israelites. And likewise one of\r\n  the popish prelates, who said he would not dine till Ridley and\r\n  Latimer were burnt, was burnt in his own entrails. So it fell out\r\n  with this man’s wife, a popish creature, who being great with\r\n  child, when the time of her delivery came, she brought forth\r\n  a monstrous child without a head, ugly and deformed, myself\r\n  eyewitness thereof.\r\n\r\n                                          Edward Fleetwood, pastor.\r\n                                          W. Greenacres, midwife.”\r\n\r\nThe tract itself informs us that in the course of a conversation with\r\nsome gentlemen, Mrs. Haughton observed with great warmth that “the\r\nPuritans and Independents deserved all to be hanged,” and concluded her\r\nuncharitable remarks by uttering a fervent wish that neither she nor any\r\none belonging to her might ever become Roundheads; upon which “answer was\r\nmade to her, that her children, if she had any, might (if God so pleased)\r\nhave their eyes opened, and see that good which she was ignorant of. Mrs.\r\nHaughton retorted in these words: _I pray God that rather than I shall\r\nbe a Roundhead, or bear a Roundhead, I may bring forth a child without\r\na head._” In course of time, as we learn from the pamphlet, she was\r\ndelivered of a monster child, being attended in her confinement by “widow\r\nGreenacres, the midwife, formerly wife to Mr. Greenacres, some time vicar\r\nof this parish,” who, “being a godly woman, could not be eased in her\r\nmind until she had discharged her conscience in making it known to Mr.\r\nFleetwood.” “For better satisfaction Mr. Fleetwood caused the grave to be\r\nopened, and the child to be taken out and laid to view, and found there a\r\nbody without a head, as the midwife had said, only the child had a face\r\non the breast of it, two eyes near unto the place where the paps usually\r\nare, and a nose upon the chest, and a mouth a little above the navel, and\r\ntwo ears, upon each shoulder one.”\r\n\r\nThe certificate of the vicar relating to this discovery, together with a\r\nmanuscript account of the circumstances connected with it, were “brought\r\nup to London by Colonel Moore (of Liverpool) a member of the House of\r\nCommons, and shewed to divers of the House; who commanded the tract to be\r\nprinted so that all the kingdom might see the hand of God therein; to the\r\ncomfort of his people, and the terror of the wicked that deride and scorn\r\nthem.”[157]\r\n\r\nIn the context are enumerated a few records of the “Thirty men,” in\r\norder that the reader may have a clearer conception of their duties,\r\nand gain some information, not devoid of interest, respecting the more\r\ncommon-place matters associated with the history and regulation of\r\nparochial and church affairs in the town:—\r\n\r\n  “1571.\r\n\r\n  “Nov. 2.

Ordered that the curates of Lund, Warton, Ribby,\r\n  and Singleton shall not exceed 2 qts. of wine each day they\r\n  administer the sacrament until further orders.”\r\n\r\nThe first church of Kirkham is commonly said to have been erected by\r\nthe Saxons on Mill Hill, and subsequently rebuilt on its present site,\r\nbut as this statement is unsupported by any more reliable evidence than\r\ntradition, we give it simply for what it is worth. The earliest authentic\r\nword of Kirkham church is in 1512, when the edifice was in part rebuilt;\r\nand at that time, and doubtless for centuries before, it occupied the\r\nsame situation as to-day. After the alterations and renewals had been\r\ncompleted, the building comprised a nave, chancel, and side aisles,\r\nseparated by stone pillars, on which rested pointed arches. At the west\r\nend of the church, throughout its entire width, was erected a gallery,\r\nanother of less extent being placed at the east end for the accommodation\r\nof the organ. The north aisle contained a small gallery belonging to the\r\nffrance family, the private chapel of the Westbys of Mowbreck, and a\r\nspacious room or vestry, in which the “Thirty-men” held their meetings.\r\nIn the south aisle was located the private oratory of the Cliftons,\r\nof Westby and Clifton. The chancel extended the width of the nave and\r\nsouth aisle, and in 1780 the Clifton chapel was, with the consent of its\r\nproprietor, enclosed within the communion rails. The reading desk stood\r\nagainst the central pillar of the north side of the nave, and immediately\r\nabove it was placed the pulpit. The north wall was low, and contained\r\nseveral large windows. The whole of the building, with the exception of\r\nthe chancel, which possessed a double-gabled roof, was covered in by a\r\nsingle roof, which slanted from the south to the north wall, and was\r\npierced at each end with dormer windows. The main entrance was protected\r\nby a massive porch.\r\n\r\nThe tower was probably erected but little later, if not, indeed, at the\r\ntime the church was rebuilding, as appears from the will here quoted,\r\nbearing the date 29th of July, 1512:—“I, Cuthbert Clifton, Squyer, desire\r\nto be buryed at Kirkham in the tombe where Rychard Clifton, my great\r\ngrandfather was buryed; I bequeath £6 13s. 4d. towards buyldyng of the\r\nsteple of the saide churche.”\r\n\r\nThis tower was embattled with a short pinnacle at each corner, and stood\r\nabout sixty feet high; on a stone in one of the buttresses were carved\r\nthe arms and name of Cuthbert Clifton. In the inside wall of the present\r\ntower there is fixed a stone bearing traces of an inscription, and it is\r\nprobable, from the remnant of a name still discernible upon it, that this\r\nis the stone here referred to.\r\n\r\nFrom the records of the “Thirty-men” are learnt several things of\r\ninterest with regard to the church, and amongst them, that during the\r\nseventeenth century the edifice was used occasionally for scholastic\r\npurposes, thus:—\r\n\r\n  “1653-54.\r\n\r\n  “6 Jan. It was agreed (by the “Thirty-men”) that no scriffener\r\n  be suffered to teach in the church, unless he procure some\r\n  honest townsmen of Kirkham to pass their word that whatsoever\r\n  his scholars do, either in breaking glass or in abusing men’s\r\n  seats—and that they meddle not with the bells—he shall make good\r\n  what they abuse.”\r\n\r\nIn 1662 a font was erected at a cost of £2 5s. 4d., and most likely is\r\nthe one now stationed in the tower entrance to the church. A bone house\r\nwas built in 1679 in the recess or corner formed by the west wall of the\r\nnorth aisle and the north side of the tower, in obedience to the order of\r\nthe bishop of the diocese. In 1724 gates were placed at the entrance to\r\nthe churchyard, and in 1799 the old tithe barn which formed the westerly\r\nboundary of this plot of ground was blown down and destroyed; the stone\r\nfor the gate pillars was obtained from Ribchester. The following lists of\r\npersons buried in the Clifton and Westby chapels, or quyres, as they were\r\ncalled, were given in an old document which was copied in 1790 by Mr. W.\r\nLangton, who described it as “much defaced and torn:”—\r\n\r\n  “In the Clifton Quire.\r\n\r\n  “1597, sir Geo Cowbrone and Mr. Cuthbert Clifton; 1598, Henry\r\n  Colbron of Frekleton; 1601, Mr. Skillicorne; 1604, ould Dorothie\r\n  Skillicorne, Mr. Skillicorne’s daughter; 1602, Mr. Skillicorne,\r\n  his wiff, Mr. Skillicorne, his son, and Henry Brown of Scales;\r\n  1604, Lawrence Cowbrone, eldest son of above; 1616, Henry Porter\r\n  of Treales; 1621, Mrs. Jane Anderton, died at Westby; 1625, Mr.\r\n  John Sharples, of Frekleton; 1630, uxor Arthur Sharples, and\r\n  Matthew Colbron of Frekleton.”\r\n\r\n  “In the Westby Quyre.\r\n\r\n  “1605, Mr. Westby and Mr. John Westby (Mr. Thos. eldest brother);\r\n  1622, ould Mr. Hesketh; 1623, Mr. Hesketh of Maines.”\r\n\r\nIn a note we are told that when Mr. Skillicorne died in 1601, “and was\r\nto be buried, Seth Woods of Kirkham and another with him stood at Mr.\r\nClifton’s quyre dore to keep them from making a grave, and William Hull\r\nof Singleton did run at the door with wood and break it open—how it ended\r\nis forgotten, but he was buried there.”\r\n\r\nIn 1822 the nave of the church was pulled down and rebuilt by aid of a\r\nrate imposed on all the townships; an inscription commemorating this\r\nevent was placed over the arch of the old chancel. The tower and spire\r\nas they now exist were erected in 1844, whilst the present chancel\r\nwas built in 1853. The spire and tower together have an altitude of\r\none hundred and fifty feet, and the foundation stone of the latter\r\nwas laid by Thomas Clifton, esq., of Lytham, on the 21st of November,\r\n1843. The tower contains a peal of eight bells, but none of them are\r\nof ancient date, those alluded to in the records of the “Thirty-men”\r\nhaving been sold and replaced by fresh ones. The modern church of\r\nKirkham, which, like its predecessor, is dedicated to St. Michael, is a\r\nlarge and handsome structure, built of Longridge stone, and capable of\r\nholding about eighteen hundred persons; the chancel is ornamented with\r\na castellated parapet and fluted cornice. A stone coffin, which may be\r\nseen outside the church at the east, was taken out of the ground when\r\nthe chancel was rebuilt. In 1725 the sum of £500 was left in trust by\r\nWilliam Grimbaldson, M.D., to be expended in the purchase of land and\r\nother property, the income from which had to be devoted to providing a\r\nsuitable person or persons to read prayers twice every day of the week\r\nexcept Sunday, in the parish church of Kirkham; in the event of this\r\ncondition of the bequest not being fulfilled, it was decreed by the will\r\nthat the annual interest of the money should be distributed amongst the\r\npoor housekeepers of Treales; so far, however, the requirement of the\r\ntrust has been conformed to, and prayers are still read twice daily in\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nWithin the ancient church of Kirkham, doubtless in the Clifton chapel,\r\nwas a chantry founded during the fifteenth century by Richard Clifton,\r\nof Clifton, who married Alice, the daughter of John Butler, of Rawcliffe\r\nHall; and called the chantry of the “Holy Crucifix,” as well as that\r\nof “Our Blessed Laydy.” The commissioners of Henry VIII. issued the\r\nfollowing report concerning it:—\r\n\r\n  “The Chauntrie in the paroche Church of Kirkeham.\r\n\r\n  “Thomas Prymbet preyst Incumbent there of the foundation of the\r\n  antecessors of Sʳ Thomas Clifton, knight, to celebrate there for\r\n  their sowles and all crysten sowles.\r\n\r\n  “The same is at the altar of our lady wᵗhin the paroche church\r\n  of Kirkham, and the said Incumbent doth celebrate there\r\n  accordinglie.”\r\n\r\n  Sum totall of the rentall                                 £6 0s. 11d.\r\n\r\n  “Whereof—\r\n\r\n  “Payde to Sir Henry ffarington, knight, as farmour to\r\n    the kynge, our Sovereigne lord, of Penwarden fee, for\r\n    chief rente goynge forthe of the lands in ffryklyngton,\r\n    by yere                                                         4d.\r\n\r\n  “Payde to the Kinges Majestie, to the handes of the\r\n    receyvour of his late Monasteyre of Vale Royall, goynge\r\n    forthe of the burgages in Kirkeham, by yere, in\r\n    Christenmes and Mydsomur,                                  7s.  6d.\r\n\r\n  “Sum of the reprises                                         7s. 10d.\r\n\r\n  “And so remayneth                                        £5 13s.  1d.”\r\n\r\nThis chantry was in existence in 1452, for in that year, when the abbot\r\nand convent of Vale Royal presented Dom. Edmund Layche to the vicarage,\r\nthe archdeacon instructed John Clarke, the chaplain of the chantry, to\r\ninduct him.[160] Thomas Prymbett, the officiating priest, was sixty years\r\nof age in 1548, and at that date the town and parish of Kirkham contained\r\n1700 “houselinge people.” Five years later Thomas Prymbett received a\r\npension of £5.[161] His death occurred in 1564.\r\n\r\nAt the dissolution of monasteries, the chantry of Kirkham church was\r\nmulcted in an annual rent of 6s. 2d., which was ordered to be paid to the\r\nreceiver of the Duchy. A lease of the lands appertaining to the chantry\r\nwas granted to Lawrence Pembroke for a term of sixteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1291 the living of Kirkham church was estimated in the _Valor_ of\r\nPope Nicholas at £160 per annum, but at the dissolution aforesaid it was\r\nvalued at no more than £21 1s. 0½d. per annum.\r\n\r\nIn 1586 the advowson of the church was leased to James Smith, yeoman,\r\nof Kirkham; and in 1591 it was granted for a period of twenty-one years\r\nby the authorities of Christ Church, Oxford, to John Sharpies, of\r\nFreckleton.[162]\r\n\r\nWithin the church are several inscriptions, the oldest and most curious\r\nof which is to be seen on a stone forming part of the floor of the\r\nvestry, and covering the grave of vicar Clegg:—\r\n\r\n  “Rᵈ: Clegg came: V: M.: J666.\r\n  Began pooʳ loaves: E: J670.\r\n  Uxʳ Jennet nupᵗ E: j672.\r\n  Mary nᵗ 9ʳ: J673: nupᵗ, FEB: 96.\r\n  Doro nᵗ.

John Threlfall, B.A., for\r\n“56 years head-master of Kirkham School,” died 1801, aged 84 years; the\r\nRev. Phipps Gerard Slatter, M.A., “head-master of the Free School,” died\r\n1815, aged 25 years; the Rev. Charles Buck, M.A., for 27 years vicar of\r\nthe parish, died 1717; the Rev. Humphrey Shuttleworth, vicar of Kirkham,\r\ndied 1812, aged 76 years; Richard Bradkirk, esq., of Bryning Hall, died\r\n1813, aged 60 years; Henry Rishton Buck, B.A., “lieutenant 33rd Regiment,\r\nwho fell in battle at Waterloo, June 18, 1815,” aged 27 years; and James\r\nBuck, lieutenant 21st Light Dragoons, died January 7, 1815, aged 19 years.\r\n\r\nIn the church yard there are sundry inscribed stones, which, although\r\nlittle interesting on the score of antiquity, are worthy of mention\r\nas marking the burial places of persons of note in the parish at one\r\ntime; as—James Thistleton of Wrea, the founder of Wrea school, who was\r\ninterred on the 27th of February, 1693; William Harrison of Kirkham,\r\ngent., interred January 12th, 1767, aged 60, who “left an ample fortune\r\nto poor relations, and £140 to be vested in land, the yearly income to\r\nbe distributed in pious books to the poor of Kirkham, Little Eccleston,\r\nand Larbrick: may the trustees dispense with integrity and effect the\r\nsacred dole”; Edward King, esq., fourth son of the Very Rev. James King,\r\nD.D., dean of Raphoe, “formerly bencher of the honourable society of\r\nGray’s inn, and for above twenty years vice-chancellor of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster”; the “Rev.

Thomas Shepherd, John Birley, and John Langton were the\r\nearliest to commence manufacturing on any large scale there, which\r\nthey accomplished during the first half of the eighteenth century by\r\nestablishing conjointly the flax spinning mill still existing, but with\r\nmany additions, as the firm of John Birley and Sons. John Langton was\r\ndescended from John Langton, of Broughton Tower, through his fourth\r\nson, John, who resided at Preston, and of whom Cornelius Langton, of\r\nKirkham, was the third son. On the 31st of March, 1696, Cornelius Langton\r\npaid 30s. for his trade freedom in Kirkham, where he married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Zachary Taylor, M.A., head-master of the Grammar School, by\r\nwhom he had issue John, Abigail, Zachary, and Roger. Abigail died in\r\n1776; Zachary entered the church, and espoused the daughter of Alexander\r\nButler, of Kirkland; Roger died in 1727; and John, the eldest, opened,\r\nin conjunction with the two gentlemen just named, a mercantile house\r\nin Kirkham, and left issue by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas\r\nBrown, of Ashtree Hall, Kirkham,—Anne, Sarah, Cornelius, Thomas, of\r\nKirkham, and five other children. The children of Thomas Langton, by\r\nhis wife Jane, the eldest daughter of William Leyland, of Blackburn,\r\nwere Elizabeth, Leyland, Cornelius, Zachary, Cicely, and William, of\r\nKirkham, born 1758, died 1814. John Birley was the son of John Birley of\r\nSkippool, and the ancestor of the large families of Birley, at Kirkham,\r\nManchester, etc. The mills at present standing in the neighbourhood of\r\nKirkham are the flax mill of Messrs. John Birley and Sons, employing\r\nabout 1,600 hands; the weaving shed of Messrs. Walker and Barrett, 400\r\nhands; the cotton mill of Messrs. Harrison and Company, 150 hands; the\r\ncotton mill of Messrs. Richards and Parker, 180 hands; the weaving shed\r\nof Messrs. Richards Brothers, 84 hands; and the Fylde Manufacturing\r\nCompany in Orders Lane, a newly-established concern. John Langton, who\r\nstarted in business at Kirkham as a flax spinner, purchased, in company\r\nwith Ann Hankinson, in 1760, two years before his death, two closes of\r\nland, with their appurtenances, in Freckleton, called Bannister Flatt and\r\nFreckleton Croft, containing by estimate 1½ acres, and 12 beast-gates\r\nupon Freckleton Marsh, all of which they conveyed by indenture in four\r\nmonths to John Dannet, Thomas Langton, and William Shepherd, in trust\r\nfor the educating, teaching, and instructing, free from all charge,\r\nof such young girls within the township of Kirkham, as they in their\r\ndiscretion should make choice of, to read, knit, and sew; and that they\r\nshould for that purpose meet twice a year, on the 25th of December and\r\nthe 24th of June, at Kirkham, to make choice of proper subjects, and\r\nkeep a book, wherein should be entered the accounts of the receipts and\r\ndisbursements. During the ten years which elapsed after 1760 additional\r\nbenefactions were received amounting to £440. By indenture, dated 2nd\r\nof March, 1772, Joseph Brockholes and Constantia, his wife, conveyed to\r\nWilliam Shepherd and Thomas Langton, trustees of the school, their heirs\r\nand assigns, for the sum of £425, two cottages, with appurtenances, in\r\nFreckleton, with a garden containing 36 perches; a parcel of ground in\r\na meadow in Freckleton, called Birl Brick Meadow, embracing 30 perches;\r\none cowgate in Freckleton Marsh; five closes in Freckleton, named the Two\r\nBaker Meadows, the Two Lamma Leaches, and the Bank, holding six acres\r\nof customary measurement. From 1772 to 1813 further donations (£130)\r\nwere received. The trusteeship of the school appears to have descended\r\nin the Langton family, and was held by the late Thomas Langton Birley,\r\nesq., whose father, Thomas Birley, had married Anne, the daughter and\r\nco-heiress of John Langton, of Kirkham. Clothing, as well as education,\r\nis supplied gratuitously to the scholars, who usually amount to 40, or\r\nthereabouts. A new building for the purposes of the school was erected on\r\na fresh site a few years ago, in place of the former one, which had stood\r\nsince 1761.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholics, through the munificence of the Rev. Thomas\r\nSherburne, built a magnificent church at the Willows in 1844-5. The\r\nedifice comprises a nave, side aisles, chancel, south porch, and an\r\nelegant spire, having an altitude of 110 feet. On the south side of the\r\nchancel is the lady chapel, and opposite to it that of the holy cross.\r\nThe high altar is beautifully sculptured in Caen stone, and the reredos\r\nand tabernacle are covered with rich guilding. The walls contain\r\nseveral noble windows of stained glass. This church superseded one which\r\nhad been erected in the same locality in 1809, anterior to which the\r\nchapel attached to Mowbreck Hall had been used by the Romanists of the\r\nneighbourhood for their celebrations and services. The Independents and\r\nWesleyans also have places of worship in the town, situated respectively\r\nin Marsden and Freckleton Streets. The chapel of the Independents was\r\nconstructed about 1793, and rebuilt in 1818, but that of the Wesleyans is\r\nof more recent origin. At the Willows, it should be mentioned, there is a\r\nschool, open to all denominations, but under Roman Catholic supervision,\r\nwhich was established about 1828. Kirkham was first illuminated with gas\r\nin 1839. It contains a County Court House[163] and the Workhouse of the\r\nFylde Union,[164] in addition to several other public buildings, as a\r\nPolice Station, Waterworks’ Office, National and Infant Schools, etc. The\r\ntown is governed by a Local Board of Health.\r\n\r\nNo papers have so far been discovered throwing any light upon the origin\r\nof the Free Grammar School, and the earliest intimation of its existence\r\nis in 1551, when Thomas Clifton, of Westby, bequeathed “towards the\r\ngrammar scole xxˢ.” Thirty-four years later it was arranged amongst the\r\n“Thirty-men” that “40s. taken out of the clerk’s wages should be paid to\r\nthe schoolmaster, and that 4 of the 30-men in the name of the rest should\r\ntake possession of the school-house in right of the whole parish, to be\r\nkept in repair by it and used as a school-house;” also that “Richard\r\nWilkins, now schoolmaster,” should be retained in his office for a year\r\nor longer. In 1589 the above assembly “agreed that the 10s. a year pᵈ by\r\nGoosnargh to the church shᵈ in future be paid to the schoolmaster, and\r\nfor every burial (except one dying in childbed) he shᵈ have such sum as\r\nwas agreed by the 30-men, and also such sum as hath heretofore been paid\r\nfor the holy loaf, which is of every house 3d., every Sunday successively\r\ntowards repairs of the schoolhouse and help of his wages.” In 1592 this\r\norder, as far as regards the holy-loaf contributions, was rescinded, the\r\nmoney as in former times going to the vicar.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the copy of an ancient manuscript account of the\r\nschool, from 1621 to 1663, formerly in the possession of Thomas Martin,\r\nesq., of Lincoln’s Inn:—\r\n\r\n  “Isabell Birly, wife of Thomas Birly, born in Kirkham, daughter\r\n  of John Coulbron, an alehouse keeper all her life, and through\r\n  that employment attayned to a good personall estait above most\r\n  in that towne of that calling, being moved with a naturall\r\n  compassion to pore children shee saw often in that towne, was\r\n  heard to say dyvers tymes she would doe something for their good,\r\n  and in the yeare 1621, having gotten a good stock of money in her\r\n  hands, was moved to put her sayings into action. The 30-men of\r\n  the parish being assembled at the church, she, with £30 in her\r\n  apron, came to them, telling them she had brought that money to\r\n  give it towards the erecting of a free schole for pore children\r\n  to be taught gratis, whose parents were not able to lay out money\r\n  for their teaching, wishing them to take it and consider of\r\n  it. They were the men especially trusted by the parish for the\r\n  common benefits of the church, and therefore were the most like\r\n  persons to move their severall townships to contribute every one\r\n  something towards the accomplishment of so charitable a work,\r\n  and not doubting that their good examples in their contributions\r\n  would be a strong motive to excite others. This gift was\r\n  thankfully accepted, and wrought so with them that every one was\r\n  forward to promote it, especially Mr. Jno. Parker of Bredkirk, an\r\n  eminent man in the parish and one of that companie, being at that\r\n  tyme one of the earl of Derbie’s gentlemen and somewhat allied\r\n  to the said Isabell; he forwarded it very much, sparing neither\r\n  his paynes of his bodie nor his purse; for that end he travelled\r\n  all the parish over to every particular towne and house earnestly\r\n  persuading them to contribute to so good an use. Sir Cuthbert\r\n  Clifton gave £20, Maister Westby of Moulbreck £10, Mr. Parker\r\n  £5, Mr. Langtree of Swarbreck £5, Mr. Hesketh of Maines 40s.,\r\n  Mr. Greenacres, vicar of Kirkham, £4, and the several townships\r\n  in the parish gave as followeth:—Kirkham near £30, but not out;\r\n  Ribby and Wray £3 8s. 6d.; Westby and Plumpton 16s. 4d.; Weeton\r\n  £7 2s.; Singleton £1 13s. 6d.; Little Eccleston and Larbrick 4s.\r\n  4d.; Greenall and Thistleton £4 16s.; Roseacre £7 2s.; Wharles\r\n  £1 13s.; Treales £8 4s.; Medlar and Wesham £1 5s.; Hambleton 4s.\r\n  6d.; Salwick £3 5s.; Clifton £3 7s.; Newton and Scales £3 5s.;\r\n  Freckleton £8; Warton £1 8s.; Bryning and Kellamer £4 13s.—in the\r\n  whole £170 14s.”\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the selection of a suitable person to undertake\r\nthe charge and education of the pupils, it so happened “that at that\r\ninstant a young man, an honest, able scholar of good gifts and parts,\r\nhaving a lingering sickness upon him, was come over to Kirkham to Mr.\r\nWilliam Armesteed (the curate of Kirkham), his cozen, for change of air,\r\nhis name being Thomas Armesteed, and he was moved by some of the towne\r\nwhether he would accept to be schole master if suit were made to the\r\n30-men to elect him; he, in regard to the weakness of his bodie then\r\nyielded to the motion, otherwise he was a man well qualified for the\r\nministery and a moving preacher.”[165]\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the “Thirty-men” to fill up the appointment there\r\nwere two candidates, Mr. Armesteed and Mr. Sokell, but the former was\r\nelected. About the year 1628, when this gentleman resigned, Mr. Sokell\r\nwas elected to the vacancy after a contest. Until 1628 the management of\r\nall matters connected with the school had rested with the “Thirty-men,”\r\nbut at that date the Roman Catholic gentlemen, who had been most liberal\r\nin their contributions, came to the conclusion that “it was not for their\r\nreputation altogether to leave the care of it to others and they to have\r\nno hand in it, therefore they took upon them to have a hand about it, and\r\nupon their doing so the 30 men, being tenants most of them to some of\r\nthem, or dependant someway upon them, left it to them; only Mr. Parker\r\nwas not bound to the _gentlemen_, and he joined in with them.”[166]\r\n\r\nIsabell Birley and others had brought out a candidate, named Dugdall, at\r\nthe recent election of schoolmaster, and were so incensed at his defeat\r\nby Mr. Sokell, a Romanist, that they drew up a petition to the bishop of\r\nChester, complaining that “the gentlemen of the parish, being recusants\r\nall saving Mr. Parker, had intruded themselves to order all things”\r\nabout the free school, and begging his lordship to issue an order how\r\nthe future election of feofees for the school should be made, which he\r\naccordingly did, as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                       “Apud, Wigan, 31 July, 1628.\r\n\r\n  “At which day and place diverse of the Town and Parish of Kirkham\r\n  appeared about the ordering of a schole master thereof for the\r\n  time to come. At their request it is therefore ordered that the\r\n  whole parish, or as many as shall appear at some day prefixed,\r\n  after public notice given the Sunday before, shall elect six or\r\n  nine lawful and honest men feofees for that purpose, whereof a\r\n  third part to be chosen by the towne of Kirkham, and the two\r\n  other parts by the parishioners generally, of which feofees\r\n  Isabell Wilding’s (late Birley) husband and her heirs, because\r\n  she gave £30 to the schole maister, shall be one.\r\n\r\n                              “Johannes Cestrensis. Edwᵈ Russell.”\r\n\r\nThe command of the bishop to call a public meeting was carried out, and\r\nin answer to the summons, read in church as directed, only seven persons\r\npresented themselves in “the parlour of Mr. Brown the curate,” viz.,\r\nSir Cuthbert Clifton, knt., Mr. Thomas Westby, Mr. Thomas Hesketh, Mr.\r\nLangtree, Mr. John Parker, gentleman, and of the parishioners, “not one\r\nman saving Richard Harrison of Freckleton, and John Wilding of Kirkham;\r\nand then and there the gentlemen elected themselves feofees, as also they\r\nelected Mr. Edward Fleetwood, the vicar.”[167]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of John Wilding in 1634, as his widow, Isabell, found\r\nherself growing more infirm, she waited on the feofees with the intention\r\nof supplementing her original donation of £30 with an additional one of\r\nequal value, if she found them “favourable to her in something she willed\r\nof them, whereas Mr. Clifton gave her harsh words and such as sent her\r\nhome with much discontent and passion.” When she died in 1637, it was\r\ndiscovered, as the manuscript from which we have been quoting informs us,\r\nthat she had “left the £30 by will to buy land with, and the yearly rent\r\nto be divided to the poor of the town and parish of Kirkham.”\r\n\r\nDuring the struggles between king and parliament, the school was closed\r\nfor several years, and re-opened with fresh governors or feofees. At\r\nthat epoch the inhabitants were kept in a state of constant excitement\r\nand alarm by visits from either the royal or parliamentary forces, but\r\nfortunately no collision ever took place in the neighbourhood.[168]\r\n\r\nBy the will, dated 1655, of Henry Colborne, of London, a native of\r\nKirkham, his trustees were requested to purchase the lease of the rectory\r\nof this town, and invest the profits, with the exception of £100 per\r\nannum, for sixteen years, in lands for the benefit of schools; the\r\npurchases were to be settled on the Drapers’ Company of London. In 1673,\r\n£69 10s. was obtained for the school, being the rent of lands bought in\r\nthe metropolis by the Colborne trustees, £45 of which sum had to be paid\r\nto the head master, who was required to be “a university man, and obliged\r\nto preach once a month at least in the parish church or in some of the\r\nchapels;” £16 16s. of the remainder was apportioned to the second master;\r\nand £8 to provide an usher.[169]\r\n\r\nIn 1673 it was decreed by the Court of Chancery that the expense and\r\nduty of preserving the school-house in proper repair should devolve upon\r\nthe township of Kirkham, whilst the election of masters should rest\r\nexclusively with the Drapers’ Company.[170]\r\n\r\nIn that year also lands, etc., at Nether Methop in Westmoreland to the\r\nvalue of £530 were purchased, according to the directions of the will of\r\nthe Rev. James Barker, rector of Thrandeston, Suffolk, which required\r\nhis executors to buy lands sufficient to yield an annual rent of £30,\r\nand to settle such property on ten trustees, elected by the bailiffs and\r\nprincipal burgesses of Kirkham; the trustees were ordered to apply the\r\nrental to the following uses:—£10 yearly to the schoolmaster; £12 yearly\r\nin half-yearly instalments, as an “exhibition or allowance to such poor\r\nscholer of the towne as shall then be admitted to the university,” such\r\nexhibition to be open to any pupil born in Kirkham and educated at the\r\nschool, and in case no scholar was ready and fitted to take advantage\r\nof it the sum was to be used in binding out poor apprentices; £5 for\r\nthe purpose of binding apprentices; and the remainder to be expended in\r\ndefraying the cost of an annual dinner for the trustees when they met to\r\n“enquire concerning the demeanure of the scholler at the univerty,” in\r\nwhose case it was appointed that if they should find him “to be riotously\r\ngiven, or disordered and debauched, they should withdraw the exhibition.”\r\n\r\nIn 1701, the Drapers’ Company issued the following order touching the\r\nadmission of girls to the benefits of the charity:— “From henceforth no\r\nfemale sex shall have any conversation, or be taught, or partake of any\r\nmanner of learning whatsoever in the free school at Kirkham, any former\r\ncustom to the contrary notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nIn 1725 £400 was bequeathed to the trustees of the school by William\r\nGrimbaldson, M.D., to be invested in lands, and the rental to be added\r\nto the stipend of the head-master, if “he should be a scholar bred at\r\nWestminster, Winchester, or Eton, and a master of arts,” but if not the\r\nrental to be devoted to binding apprentices, for which purpose it is used\r\nat present. In addition this physician left £50 to be similarly invested,\r\nand the income to be spent in buying classical books for the school. The\r\nmanagement of the school has been in the hands of trustees from the time\r\nof Barker’s bequest.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the exhibition under Barker’s trust\r\ntwenty-eight youths have been assisted in their university careers by its\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n  HEAD MASTERS OF GRAMMAR SCHOOL SINCE 1800.\r\n\r\n  -------------+----------------------------+------------+-----------\r\n    Date of    |                            |            |By whom\r\n  Appointment. |           NAME.            |            |appointed.\r\n  -------------+----------------------------+------------+-----------\r\n  1801 to 1806 |Rev.

In 1867\r\nthe fund amounted to £102 2s., yielding an annual income of £5 13s. 3d.\r\n\r\nA sum of £12 was given by vicar Clegg, the interest to be paid to the\r\nclergyman preaching a sermon in Kirkham church on Easter Tuesday.\r\n\r\nRichard Brown, by indenture dated 1639, conveyed for a term of 999 years\r\na close called New Moor Hey with appurtenances, in Kirkham, to James\r\nSmith, upon condition that he, his heirs and executors, should pay\r\nthe yearly rent of 20s. at Martinmas. “It is witnessed, that the said\r\nRichard Brown, in consideration of the good will he bore to the town of\r\nKirkham, and the inhabitants thereof, and out of his zeal to God, and the\r\ncharitable relief of the poor, needful and impotent people within the\r\nsaid town, granted to William Robinson and three others, their heirs and\r\nassigns, the said yearly rent of 20s., to hold the same upon trust, and\r\nto dispose of it amongst so many of the people of the said town, as the\r\nbailiffs thereof for the time being should, in their discretion, think\r\nmost needful, on St. Thomas’s day.”[171]\r\n\r\nBy indenture, dated 1734, Joseph Hankinson, of Kirkham, in consideration\r\nof £45 released and conveyed to Robert Hankinson, and four others a close\r\nin Kirkham, called Swarbreck’s Old Earth, containing, by estimate, 1½\r\nacres, to hold the same to themselves and their heirs for ever; and in\r\nthe deed it was declared that the consideration money belonged to the\r\npoor of the township, and that the grantees were only trustees of the\r\nsame, and had laid it out by direction of the inhabitants for the benefit\r\nof the poor according to the wish of the benefactors. The indenture is\r\nendorsed:—“Conveyance of Swarbreck’s Old Earth, for the use of the poor\r\nof Kirkham, purchased by monies given by Mrs. Clegg, widow of the Rev.\r\nRichard Clegg, vicar, and Mrs. Phœbe Sayle, wife of Mr. Charles Sayle, to\r\nwit £20 by the former, and £20 by the latter.”\r\n\r\nThomas Brockholes, by an indenture of 1755, conveyed for £50 to John\r\nLangton and William Shepherd, their heirs and assigns, a close called\r\nMoor Hey, with appurtenances; and subsequently in 1768 William Shepherd\r\nconveyed the close then denominated the Bailiffs’ Moor Hey to Henry\r\nLawson, yeoman, of Kirkham, who in the following year being moved by\r\n“divers good causes and considerations” sold to the Rev. Charles Buck,\r\nvicar of Kirkham, and twelve others, all of Kirkham, gentlemen, for\r\nthe sum of five shillings, two plots of land in Kirkham township, one\r\nof which, called Moorcroft, contained a rood and four perches, and\r\nthe other, Swarbreck’s Old Earth, comprised an acre and an half. The\r\nconditions were that all profits or income accruing from the lands should\r\nbe used for the relief of the poor of the aforesaid township.[172]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December, 1739, a legacy of £40 was bequeathed to trustees\r\nby Elizabeth Brown, to be invested, and the interest applied to the\r\nrelief of the poor and necessitous widows of Kirkham, or the neighbouring\r\ntownships, at Michaelmas.\r\n\r\nThe sum of £140 was received under the will, dated 1767, of William\r\nHarrison of Kirkham, to be invested, and the interest to be expended\r\nin Common Prayer books, Bibles, etc., two-thirds of which were to be\r\ngiven to the poor of this town, and the remainder to the poor of Little\r\nEccleston and Larbrick.[173]\r\n\r\nIn 1816 Mrs. Mary Bradkirk placed £320 in the navy, five per cents. in\r\nher own name and that of Zachary Langton, esq., of Bedford Row, London;\r\nand subsequently trustees of this fund were appointed, whose duty it was\r\nto distribute the interest as follows:—\r\n\r\nThat of £100 amongst five necessitous persons in the township of Kirkham\r\nfor life, and each vacancy to be filled up immediately after the death of\r\nthe former recipient.\r\n\r\nThat of £20 to Joseph Brewer, then parish clerk of Kirkham, for life, and\r\nafter his demise to the person filling the office of sexton at the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThat of £100 to five poor persons of Ribby-with-Wrea, and that of the\r\nlast £100 to five poor persons of Bryning-with-Kellamergh, the vacancies\r\nto be treated as in those of Kirkham.\r\n\r\nThe only requirement on the part of the pensioners being that they should\r\nbe members of the Church of England. The income of this charity, which\r\namounts to more than £10 a year, like those of the five preceding it,\r\nforms part of the bailiffs’ fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nPARISH OF KIRKHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRECKLETON. In the Domesday Book Freckeltun is stated to contain four\r\ncarucates of arable soil. During the reign of Henry III. Richard de\r\nFreckleton, Allan de Singleton, and Iwan de Freckleton, with three\r\nothers, held land in Freckleton from the earl of Lincoln. In 1311 the\r\nheirs of Adam de Freckleton held Freckleton from Alice, the daughter and\r\nheiress of the earl of Lincoln, shortly after which Ralph de Freckleton\r\nwas lord of the manor. Gilbert de Singleton had a house with 12 acres of\r\nland and a mill there in 1325. In 1349 the manor was held under the earl\r\nof Lancaster as follows:—Robert de Freckleton, 1 messuage and 3 bovates;\r\nNicholas le Botiler, 1 messuage and 11 bovates; the heirs of Robert\r\nSherburne, 2 bovates; the heirs of Sir Adam de Banastre, 2 bovates; and\r\nThomas de Singleton, 1 bovate. During the first half of the 16th century\r\nthe Botilers or Butlers retained property in Freckleton, whilst the\r\nSherburnes held estates there until the early part of the 17th century.\r\nHugh Hilton Hornby, esq., of Ribby Hall, is the largest territorial\r\nproprietor at present, but there are several resident yeomen.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 a temporary episcopal chapel was erected, and 5 years later the\r\nexisting church was built, being a neat brick edifice, with a spire at\r\nthe west end, and containing an ancient pulpit from Kirkham church. The\r\nRev. G. H. Waterfall, M.A., was the earliest incumbent, and the Rev.\r\nWalter Scott, appointed in 1861, is now in charge. In 1718 a Quakers’\r\nburial ground was opened, but was closed in 1811. A meeting house was\r\nalso established by the same sect in 1720, and pulled down after standing\r\nnearly a century. A Wesleyan chapel was erected in 1814; and in 1862 the\r\nPrimitive Methodists opened another. A National school was built in 1839,\r\nand is supported mainly by subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe village is long and irregular, but contains sundry better class\r\nhouses, and a cotton manufactory, belonging to Mr. Sowerbutts, holding\r\n320 looms. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in making sacking,\r\nsailcloth, ropes, etc. There is also a shipbuilding yard, of which Mr.\r\nRawstorne is the proprietor, where vessels, mostly for the coasting\r\ntrade, are constructed.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF FRECKLETON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    561    701    875    909    995    968    879    930\r\n\r\nThe township comprises 2,659 statute acres.\r\n\r\nAndrew Freckleton and two more gave, about 1734, certain sums of money\r\nfor the poor of Freckleton, the interest from which, together with 10s.\r\nper annum left by Lawrence Webster for the same object, amounts to £2\r\n5s. a year. The township shares in a bequest of £5, with Clifton and\r\nNewton-with-Scales, from Elizabeth Clitherall, of Clifton, for the use of\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\nWARTON. Wartun is entered in the survey of William the Conqueror as\r\ncomprising four carucates, and later, when in the fee of the earl of\r\nLincoln, the township was held by the manorial lord of Wood Plumpton.\r\nDuring the reign of King John, Thomas de Betham had the third of a\r\nknight’s fee in Warton. Sir Ralph de Betham held Warton in the time of\r\nEdward III., and in 1296 Edmund Crouchback, earl of Lancaster, had a rent\r\ncharge of 3s. 4d. there. Gilbert de Singleton was possessed of a messuage\r\nwith six bovates of land in the township about 1325. The manor was held\r\nby Johanna Standish and Richard Singleton in 1515. John Talbot Clifton,\r\nesq., of Lytham Hall, is now the most extensive owner of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe church of Warton, dedicated to St. Paul, was completed in 1722, but\r\nnot consecrated until 1725. Within recent years it has been apportioned a\r\ndistinct parochial district under Lord Blandford’s act.\r\n\r\n  CURATES AND VICARS OF WARTON.\r\n\r\n  ------------+------------------------+------------------------\r\n    Date of   |                        |\r\n  Institution.|        NAME.           |   Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  ------------+------------------------+------------------------\r\n  Before 1773 |Wilfred Burton          |\r\n  In 1789     |Charles Buck, M.A.      |\r\n   ” 1790     |James Fox               |Resignation of C.

In\r\n1809, William Dobson, of Liverpool, bequeathed £500 to the trustees, and\r\nanother sum of £500 was also bequeathed by Mrs. Francis Hickson. In 1821\r\na new school-house was built.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF WARTON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    376    445    468    531    522    473    446    444\r\n\r\nThe area of the township contains 3,939 statute acres.\r\n\r\nBRYNING-WITH-KELLAMERGH. The earliest allusion to this township occurs in\r\n1200-1, when Matilda Stockhord and others held two carucates in Briscath\r\nBrunn and one carucate in Kelgmersberg. A few years later Robert de\r\nStockhord had the fourth of a knight’s fee there. In 1253 Ralph Betham\r\nheld Brininge, Kelgermsarche, etc.; and during the reign of Edward III.\r\nSir Ralph de Betham possessed the fourth of a knight’s fee in the same\r\nplaces, at which time John de Damport also held an eighth of a carucate.\r\nIn 1311 John Baskerville had 3½ bovates, and Thurstan de Norley 4\r\nbovates, in the hamlet of Kilgremargh.\r\n\r\nIn 1479 Sir Edward and William Betham had land in Bryning and Kellamergh;\r\nand two years afterwards half of the manor was granted by Edward IV. to\r\nThomas Molyneux and his heirs. Thomas Middleton held both Bryning and\r\nKellamergh in 1641. The Birley, Langton, Cross, and Smith families are\r\nnow the chief landowners in the township.\r\n\r\nBryning Hall and Leyland House are the only places of interest amongst\r\nthe scattered habitations. The Hall, now a farm-house, was formerly the\r\nseat of the Bradkirks, whilst Leyland House, also converted to farm\r\nuses, was the residence of the Leylands, of Kellamergh, during the 17th\r\nand part of the 18th centuries.[174]\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF BRYNING-WITH-KELLAMERGH.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    105    131    145    164    152    126    116    115\r\n\r\nThe area of the township in statute acres is 1,043.\r\n\r\nRIBBY-WITH-WREA. In Domesday Book _Rigbi_, for Ribby, is entered as\r\ncomprising six carucates. Roger de Poictou gave the tithes of “colts,\r\ncalves, lambs, kids, pigs, wheat, cheese, and butter of Ribbi and\r\nSingletone” to the priory of Lancaster to serve as food to the monks who\r\ncelebrated mass in that monastery. This grant was afterwards confirmed by\r\nJohn, earl of Moreton.[175] In 1201 Adam and Gerard de Wra paid two marks\r\nto King John in order to gain protection from the sheriff, who, it seems,\r\nwas in the habit of unjustly molesting them in their tenements.[176] The\r\nmanors of Preston, Riggeby, and Singleton were presented by Henry III. to\r\nEdmund, earl of Lancaster, who in 1286 became engaged in a dispute with\r\nthe abbot of Vale Royal, which ultimately led to a mandate being issued\r\nby Edward I., at Westminster, to the sheriff of Lancaster, commanding\r\nhim to draw a proper and just boundary line between the lands of the\r\ndisputants, because the abbot complained that the earl had taken more\r\nterritory than he was legally entitled to by his fee, thereby encroaching\r\non the conventual possessions in Kirkham parish.[177] In 1297 earl\r\nEdmund’s rents from Ribby-with-Wrea amounted in all to £19 19s.[178] per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nDuring the life of the first duke of Lancaster, Ribby contained twenty\r\nhouses, and twenty-one and three-fourths bovates of land held by bondsmen\r\nat a rental of £19 16s. 4d.; and at that time there were the following\r\ntenants in Ribby and Wrea:—Adam, the son of Richard the clerk, who held\r\nfive acres, and paid 4d. per annum; Adam, the son of Jordani, one acre\r\nfor 12d.; Roger Culbray, three acres for 9d.; Richard de Wra, half a\r\nbovate for 5d.; Adam de Kelyrumshagh, half a bovate for 4d.; William de\r\nWogher, six acres for 2d.; John de Bredkyrke, half a bovate for 9d.;\r\nWilliam le Harpour, one bovate for 15d.; Giles, two acres for 10d.; John\r\nde Bonk, one bovate and one acre for 10d.; John le Wise, eleven acres for\r\n7d.; and Adam de Parys, two bovates, which were those of John le Harpour,\r\nfor 3s., of free farm and two marks. After the demise of a tenant it was\r\nthe recognised custom for his successor to pay double rent.[179] The rent\r\ndays were the feasts of the Annunciation of the Blessed Mary and of St.\r\nMichael. H. H. Hornby, esq., of Ribby Hall, is the present lord of the\r\nmanor.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the ancient manor house on Wrea Green are now used as\r\na cottage; Ribby Hall, the seat of the Hornbys, is a modern mansion,\r\nand was erected rather more than half a century ago. The church of\r\nRibby-with-Wrea owes its origin to the trustees of Nicholas Sharples’s\r\ncharity, who purchased a piece of ground on Wrea Green in 1721, and,\r\nhaving subscribed sufficient funds amongst themselves, erected a small\r\nchapel upon it. The following year they obtained a license to hold\r\ndivine service in the building, and on the 20th of June, 1755, it was\r\nconsecrated by the bishop of Chester. At that date the church was endowed\r\nwith £400, half of which came from Queen Anne’s bounty, and the other in\r\nequal portions from the charities of Thistleton and Sharples. In 1762\r\nthe whole of this fund was invested in land in Warton, and other sums\r\namounting to £600, including a legacy of £100 under the will of Thomas\r\nBenson in 1761, and further donations from the Royal bounty before\r\nmentioned, were expended in the purchase of land at Thistleton.[180]\r\n\r\nIn 1846 the township of Westby, with the exception of Great and Little\r\nPlumptons, was joined, by order of Council, to that of Ribby-with-Wrea,\r\nand the whole converted into an ecclesiastical district. In 1869 the\r\ntitle of the incumbent was changed from that of perpetual curate to vicar.\r\n\r\nThe old church was pulled down and the foundation stone of the existing\r\nstructure laid in 1848, by the Rev. G. L. Parsons, vicar of Kirkham. On\r\nthe 23rd of September in the ensuing year, it was opened for worship,\r\nbut remained unconsecrated until the 4th of May, 1855. The church is\r\ndedicated to St. Nicholas.\r\n\r\n  CURATES AND VICARS OF RIBBY-WITH-WREA.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------\r\n    Date of   |                             |\r\n  Institution.|        NAME.                |   Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  ------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------\r\n  Before 1733 | Robert Willacy              |\r\n     ”   1756 | Samuel Smith                |\r\n     ”   1762 | James Anyon                 |\r\n    In   1770 | ⸺ Watts                     |\r\n     ”   1791 | John Thompson               |\r\n  About  1823 | James Fox                   |\r\n    In   1845 | George Thistlethwaite, M.A. | Resignation of J.

Wentworth\r\n  ------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Rev. George Thistlethwaite was the son of the Rev. T. Thistlethwaite,\r\nincumbent of St. George’s, Bolton-le-Moors, and in 1837 officiated _pro.\r\ntemp._ as head master of Kirkham Grammar School. The Rev. S. E. Wentworth\r\nheld the headmastership of the same school from 1845 to 1860, as well as\r\nhis curacy.\r\n\r\nThe free school of Ribby-with-Wrea owes its existence to the frugality\r\nand benevolence of a tailor, named James Thistleton, of Wrea, who,\r\nalthough his daily wages averaged no more than 4d. and his food, managed,\r\nby great care and self-denial, to accumulate a sufficient fund to\r\nestablish a school at his native place, an object to which he had in a\r\ngreat measure devoted his life. At his death in 1693, it was found that,\r\nafter a few small legacies, one being “10s. to Mr. Clegg, vicar, to\r\npreach at my funeral,” and another 6s. 8d. to each of the townships of\r\nKirkham, Bryning, and Westby, for the use of the poor, he had bequeathed\r\nthe remainder of his property “towards the making and maintaining of a\r\nfree school in the township of Ribby-cum-Wrea for ever,” stipulating only\r\nthat his surviving sister should receive annually from the profits of his\r\nestate a sum of money sufficient for her support during the rest of her\r\nlife. The executors appointed were Thomas Benson, Richard Shepherd, and\r\nCuthbert Bradkirk, whilst the money designed for the foundation of the\r\nschool amounted to £180.\r\n\r\nThe work thus commenced by Thistleton received, a few years later,\r\nsubstantial assistance under the will, dated 10th September, 1716,\r\nof Nicholas Sharples, who is described as a “citizen and innholder\r\nof London.” The bequest in this instance amounted to £850, and the\r\ntwo executors, Richard Wilson and Robert Pigot, were directed, “with\r\nall convenient speed to apply such sum of money towards the building\r\nor finishing of a school-house for educating of boys and girls in\r\nRibby-cum-Wrea,” and in the purchase of land for the benefit of such\r\nestablishment, and the remuneration of the master, “for educating such a\r\nnumber of boys and girls as nine of the most substantial men, chosen and\r\nelected out of Ribby-cum-Wrea for governors or elders, or the major part\r\nof them, shall think fit;” also that his name should be inscribed in some\r\nprominent place on one of the school walls.[181]\r\n\r\nIn 1780 a girls’ school was established in a building separate from\r\nthat of the boys, but in 1847 the trustees of the foundation gave the\r\n“materials of the boys’ school” and the plot of land as a site for the\r\nnew church, and in return the ecclesiastical party erected, according to\r\nagreement, another school-house on a piece of ground adjoining the girls’\r\nschool.[182]\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF RIBBY-WITH-WREA.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    307    398    500    482    442    406    444    446\r\n\r\nThe area of the township amounts to 1,366 statute acres.\r\n\r\nWESTBY, WITH GREAT AND LITTLE PLUMPTONS. Gilbert de Clifton held the\r\nmanor about 1280, and subsequently his son William de Clifton was in\r\npossession about 1292. During the reign of Edward III. John Fleetwood\r\nwas lord of Little Plumpton, and in 1394 his descendant, John Fleetwood,\r\nresided there. John Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, whose ancestor\r\nwas the Gilbert de Clifton just mentioned, holds the manor of Westby with\r\nPlumpton, by right of inheritance.\r\n\r\nBowen, the geographer, who wrote in 1717, alludes to a spa in Plumpton,\r\nand states that it was impregnated with sulphur, vitriol, ochre, iron,\r\nand a marine salt, united with a bitter purging salt. The site of the spa\r\nhas been lost in the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nWestby Hall, the seat of the Cliftons, has been supplanted by a\r\nfarm-house. The old chapel connected with it was opened in 1742 to\r\nthe Romanists of the district, but closed about a century later. The\r\npresent Catholic chapel was built in 1861. In 1849 a school, free to\r\nall denominations, was established by Thomas Clifton, esq., of Lytham,\r\nbut there seems to have been such an institution existing before, as Ann\r\nMoor, of Westby, bequeathed, in 1805, £40 to Plumpton school, and the\r\ninterest of £20 to the poor of Great Plumpton.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF WESTBY-WITH-PLUMPTONS.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    623    692    771    686    643    707    601    535\r\n\r\nThe area of the township is 3,426 statute acres.\r\n\r\nWEETON-WITH-PREESE. On the arrival of the Normans Weeton contained 300\r\nacres of arable land. In the 9th year of King John, Matilda, wife of\r\nTheobald Walter, obtained certain inheritances in Weeton, Treales, and\r\nRawcliffe. Theobald le Botiler, or Butler, held Weeton in 1249; and in\r\n1339, James, son of Edmund le Botiler, earl of Ormond, had possession of\r\nit, together with Treales, Little Marton, and Out Rawcliffe. The manor\r\ndescended in the same family until 1673, when it passed to the 9th earl\r\nof Derby on his marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Butler, the\r\nLord Ossory. The present earl of Derby is now the lord of the soil, and\r\nholds a court baron by deputy. There is a fair for cattle and small wares\r\non the first Tuesday after Trinity Sunday.\r\n\r\nPreese is the Pres of Domesday Book, and comprised at that time two\r\ncarucates. Henry, duke of Lancaster, held Preese at his death in 1361. In\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII. the manor was in the hands of the Skilicornes,\r\nwho for many generations were the coroners of Amounderness. Preese Hall,\r\nthe ancient seat of this family, was much damaged by a fire in 1732,\r\nwhich destroyed the private chapel. In 1864 that portion of the mansion,\r\nwhich had survived the conflagration and been repaired, was pulled down.\r\nThe site is now occupied by a farm-house, belonging to T. H. Miller,\r\nesq., of Singleton, who owns a large amount of the land.\r\n\r\nThe church of Weeton is dedicated to St. Michael, and was built in\r\n1843 by subscription, to which the late earl of Derby contributed\r\ngenerously. In 1852 the edifice was enlarged, and in 1861 the township\r\nof Weeton-with-Preese was united with the Plumptons and Greenhalgh, to\r\nform an ecclesiastical parish. The Rev. William Sutcliffe, when curate\r\nat Kirkham, performed the duties at Weeton church, and was appointed\r\nincumbent there in 1861. In 1862 he was succeeded by the present vicar,\r\nthe Rev. William Thorold. A National school was erected by subscription\r\nand a grant from the National Society of £30, in 1845. A Wesleyan chapel\r\nwas built about 1827.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF WEETON-WITH-PREESE.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    384    508    473    477    545    465    465    433\r\n\r\nThe area of the township is 2,876 statute acres.\r\n\r\nMEDLAR-WITH-WESHAM. The abbot and brethren of Cockersand Abbey became\r\npossessed of this township at an early date, and retained it until the\r\ndissolution of monasteries, when the manor of Medlar passed, by gift or\r\npurchase, to the Westbys, of Mowbreck Hall. The estates of the Westbys\r\nwere confiscated by the Commonwealth, and only redeemed on the payment\r\nof £1,000. The estate and Hall of Mowbreck are still held by the same\r\nfamily.[183] The mansion preserves many evidences of its great antiquity,\r\nincluding the old chapel and priests’ room.\r\n\r\nBradkirk, in Medlar, belonged to Theobald Walter in 1249, but in the\r\nreign of Edward III. it was held by a family bearing the name of\r\nBradkirk, a title acquired from the estate. The Bradkirks resided there\r\nas proprietors until somewhere about the opening of the 17th century,\r\nwhen the earl of Derby had obtained the soil. In 1723 Bradkirk was bought\r\nby John Richardson, of Preston, from Thomas Stanley, of Cross Hall, in\r\nOrmskirk parish, who held the manor by right of his wife Catherine,\r\nsister and heiress of Christopher Parker, of Bradkirk, deceased,\r\nunmarried, a few years before.[184] From John Richardson the manor passed\r\nsuccessively by will to William Richardson, Edward Hurst, of Preston, and\r\nJames Kearsley, of Over Hulton, by the last of whom it was sold in 1797\r\nto Joseph Hornby, esq., of Ribby, and his descendant, H. H. Hornby, esq.,\r\nof Ribby Hall, is the present holder. The original Bradkirk Hall, the\r\nseat of the Bradkirks and Parkers, has long since disappeared, and the\r\nedifice now bearing the name was erected or rebuilt by Edward Hurst in\r\n1764.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 an Independent Day and Sunday school was built by Benjamin\r\nWhitworth, esq., M.P., of London, on land given by R. C. Richards, esq.,\r\nJ.P., of Kirkham, and presented to the trustees of the chapel belonging\r\nto that sect at Kirkham. The railway station and several weaving sheds\r\nand cotton mills are situated in this township.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF MEDLAR-WITH-WESHAM.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    216    230    215    242    209    170    563    860\r\n\r\nGREENHALGH-WITH-THISTLETON. Greenhalgh is stated in the Domesday Book to\r\ncontain three carucates of soil. The township was held by the Butlers\r\nof the Fylde at an early epoch, and retained until 1626 at least, when\r\nHenry Butler, of Rawcliffe, was lord of Greenhalgh and Thistleton. During\r\nthe sovereignty of Edward I. the abbot of Cockersand had certain rights\r\nthere, including assize of bread and beer.\r\n\r\nHenry Colbourne, of London, bequeathed, in 1655, £5 10s. to establish\r\na school at Esprick in this township, but his wishes were not properly\r\ncarried out before 1679, at which date his legacy was supplemented by\r\ngifts from 41 yeomen in the neighbourhood, and a school erected to\r\nprovide free education to the children of Greenhalgh and Thistleton.\r\nFurther endowments of £60 in 1766 from John Cooper, and £80 a little\r\nlater by subscription, were given to the institution; and in 1805 Mary\r\nHankinson left £200, and Richard Burch, of Greenhalgh, £200, to the same\r\nobject. The original school-house, formed of clay and thatched with\r\nstraw, has been pulled down, and a fresh one built. Subsequent donations\r\nhave been received under the wills of the Misses Ellen and Hannah\r\nDewhirst, the former of whom left £200, in addition to a gift of £100\r\nduring her lifetime, and the latter the residue of her estate.\r\n\r\nThe interest of £20, bequeathed for that purpose by a person named\r\nLawrenson, is distributed annually to the poor of Greenhalgh.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF GREENHALGH-WITH-THISTLETON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    378    403    409    408    371    362    383    365\r\n\r\nThe township embraces 1,821 statute acres.\r\n\r\nGREAT AND LITTLE SINGLETONS. At the Domesday Survey, Singletun contained\r\nsix carucates of arable land, the lord of the manor being Roger de\r\nPoictou, who gave the tithes at the close of the eleventh century to the\r\npriory of St. Mary’s, Lancaster; this grant was subsequently confirmed\r\nby John, earl of Moreton.[185] During the reigns of kings John and Henry\r\nIII., Alan de Singleton held a carucate of land in the township by\r\nserjeanty of the wapentake of Amounderness.[186] In 20 Edward I. (1292)\r\nThomas de Singleton, a descendant of Alan, proved to the satisfaction\r\nof a jury, when his right to certain offices was called in question,\r\nthat the manor of Little Singleton had belonged to his family from time\r\nimmemorial, and that the serjeanty of Amounderness with its privileges\r\nand duties, was annexed and appurtenant to that manor. Thomas de\r\nSingleton admitted, however, when called upon by the king’s attorney\r\nto show by what title he held the manors of Singleton, Thornton, and\r\nBrughton, the same having been amongst the possessions of Richard I. at\r\nhis death, that he did not hold the whole of Singleton, as Thomas de\r\nClifton and Caterina his wife had one third of two bovates there; and\r\nurged this fact as a plea why he could not be summoned to answer the\r\ndemand as made on behalf of Edward I. His objection was allowed.[187]\r\nIn 1297 Edmund, earl of Lancaster received annually £21 from Singleton\r\nand 20s. from Singleton Grange. At the opening of the fourteenth century\r\nLittle Singleton had passed into the hands of the Banastres, for the\r\n“hamlet of Singleton Parva” was one of the estates of William Banastre at\r\nhis death in 17 Edward II. (1323-24).[188] Towards the end of the reign\r\nof Edward II. Thomas, the son of the notorious Sir Adam Banastre, held\r\nlittle Singleton and the serjeanty of Amounderness, and by the latter\r\nof these had a right to the services of two bailiffs and a boy to levy\r\nexecutions within the wapentake.[189]\r\n\r\nThe following notice of Singleton in the time of Henry, duke of\r\nLancaster, who died in 1361, occurs amongst the Lansdowne manuscripts:—\r\n\r\n  “In Syngleton there are 21 messuages and 26 bovates of land\r\n  held by bondsmen, who pay annually at the feasts of Easter and\r\n  St. Michael £21 9s. 3d. And there are 11 cottages with so many\r\n  inclosures, and one croft, and one piece of land in the hands\r\n  of tenants-at-will, paying annually 21s. 6d. All the aforesaid\r\n  bondsmen owe talliage, and give marchet and heriot,[190] and\r\n  on the death of her husband a widow gives one third part of\r\n  his property to the lord of the manor, but more is claimed in\r\n  cases where the deceased happen to be widowers. And if any one\r\n  possesses a male fowl it is forbidden to him to sell it without a\r\n  license. The duke of Lancaster owns the aforesaid tenements with\r\n  right to hold a court. It is to be noted that each of the above\r\n  mentioned bovates of land is to pay at first 2s. 7d. per annum,\r\n  with work at the plough and harrow, mowing meadows in Ryggeby,\r\n  and carrying elsewhere the lord’s provisions at Richmond, York,\r\n  Doncaster, Pontefract, and Newcastle, with 12 horses in Summer\r\n  and Winter. But afterwards the land was freed from this bondage,\r\n  and paid per bovate 14s. 3d. ob.”\r\n\r\nThe lands of Thomas Banastre, before named, in “Syngleton Parva,\r\nEthelswyk, Frekulton, Hamylton, Stalmyn,” etc., were escheated to John of\r\nGaunt, duke of Lancaster, in 1385, after the death of Banastre.[191]\r\n\r\nEdmund Dudley, who was attainted in 1509 and afterwards executed, held\r\nLittle Singleton, as well as lands in Elswick, Thornton, Wood Plumpton,\r\nFreckleton, etc.;[192] and in 1521 Thomas, earl of Derby, held the manor\r\nof Syngleton of Henry VIII.[193]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James I. Great Singleton appears to have belonged to\r\nthe crown, for amongst a number of estates purchased from the crown by\r\nEdward Badbie and William Weldon, of London, for the sum of £2,000, is\r\nthe “manor or lordship of Singleton, alias Singleton Magna,” the annual\r\nrent of which is stated to have been £16 17s. 0d. Subsequently the manor\r\npassed to the Fanshaws, and from them to the Shaws; William Cunliffe\r\nShaw, of Preston, esq., sold it to Joseph Hornby, of Ribby Hall, esq.,\r\nand afterwards it was purchased by Thomas Miller, esq., of Preston, who\r\ngreatly improved the property by draining the low lying lands known as\r\nSingleton Carrs, which in former days were frequently in a state of\r\npartial or complete inundation. Thomas H. Miller, esq., the present owner\r\nand eldest son of the late Thos. Miller, esq., has recently erected a\r\nnoble mansion on the estate, where he resides during most of the year.\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice to be discovered of Singleton Grange is in an old\r\nschedule of deeds, in which the land is mentioned as having been granted\r\nby King John in 1215. In 1297, during the reign of Edward I., Edmund\r\nCrouchback, earl of Lancaster, received yearly the sum of 20s. from the\r\nestate. Subsequently the Grange passed into the possession of the abbot\r\nand convent of Cockersand;[194] and at the dissolution of monasteries\r\nit became the property of Henry VIII., who in 1543 granted it to William\r\nEccleston, of Eccleston, gentleman.[195] The Grange descended to Thomas,\r\nthe son, and afterwards to Adam, the grandson, of William Eccleston.\r\nAdam Eccleston died sometime a little later than 1597. The estate after\r\nhis decease passed through several hands in rapid succession, and in\r\n1614 was sold by William Ireland, gent., to William Leigh, B.D., clerk\r\nin holy orders and rector of Standish. Theophilus Leigh, the eldest\r\nson of that gentleman, resided at Singleton Grange, and married Clare,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Brooke, of Norton, Cheshire, by whom he had one son,\r\nnamed William. William Leigh succeeded to the Grange on the death of his\r\nfather in 1658, and espoused Margaret, daughter of Edward Chisenhall, of\r\nChisenhall, Lancashire, and had issue, Charles and Edward.\r\n\r\nCharles Leigh, the elder of the two sons, became celebrated as a\r\nphysician and student of natural history and antiquities. He was born\r\nat the Grange in 1662, and at the age of 21 graduated as B.A. at the\r\nUniversity of Oxford; afterwards he removed to Cambridge to study\r\nmedicine, and in 1690 obtained the degree of M.D. In 1685 he was elected\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society. He married Dorothy, daughter of Edward\r\nShuttleworth, of Larbrick, and practised as a physician both in London\r\nand in the neighbourhood of his birthplace, on one occasion, according\r\nto his own version, performing a wonderful cure on Alexander Rigby, of\r\nLayton Hall. His published works were—_Physiologia Lancastriensis_, in\r\n1691, and the _Natural History of Lancashire, Cheshire, and the Peak\r\nof Derbyshire, with an account of the British, Phœnician, Armenian,\r\nGreek, and Roman Antiquities in those parts_, in 1700, of which latter\r\nDr. Whittaker remarks:—“Had this doctor filled his whole book, as he\r\nhas done nearly one-half of it, with medical cases, it might have been\r\nof some use; but how, with all possible allowances for the blindness\r\nand self-partiality of human nature, a man should have thought himself\r\nqualified to write and to publish critical remarks on a subject of which\r\nhe understood not the elementary principles, it is really difficult to\r\nconceive.”[196]\r\n\r\nSomewhere before the commencement of the eighteenth century, the estate\r\nof Bankfield was separated from the Grange, which, during the latter\r\nportion, at least, of the lifetime of Dr. Leigh, who died shortly after\r\nthe publication of his “Natural History,” was held by a person named\r\nJoseph Green. In 1701 the executors of Joseph Green sold a portion\r\nof Singleton Grange to Richard Harrison, of Bankfield, yeoman. The\r\nremainder of the Grange land was held by widow Green until her death,\r\nwhen it passed by her will, dated 1716, to her two sons, Richard and Paul\r\nGreen.[197]\r\n\r\nRichard Harrison, of Bankfield, obtained the whole of Singleton Grange\r\nin 1738, and left it on his decease to his son Richard, from whom it\r\ndescended about 1836 to his only surviving child, Agnes Elizabeth, the\r\nwife of Edwards Atkinson, of Fleetwood, justice of the peace for the\r\ncounty of Lancaster. Mrs. Atkinson died childless in 1850, and bequeathed\r\nSingleton Grange to her husband, who in his turn entailed the estate\r\nupon his eldest son, Charles Edward Dyson Atkinson, still a minor, the\r\noffspring of a second marriage, with Anne, daughter of Christopher\r\nThornton Clark, of Cross Hall, Lancashire, by whom he had issue two sons\r\nand a daughter,—Ann Elizabeth Ynocensia, John Henry Gladstone, and the\r\npresent heir. The old Hall of Singleton Grange has been modernised and\r\nconverted into a farm-house.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that there was a chapel in Singleton during the\r\nearlier years of the fourteenth century, for in 1358-59, Henry, duke\r\nof Lancaster, granted to John de Estwitton, hermit, the custody of the\r\nchapel of St. Mary, in Singleton; and in 1440 a license was granted to\r\ncelebrate mass to the inhabitants of Singleton in the chapel at the\r\nsame place for one year. Twelve years afterwards another license was\r\ngranted by the archdeacon of Richmond for an oratory to be established\r\nin the chapel for the use of the people of the township; and in 1456 the\r\nlicense was renewed by archdeacon Laurence Bothe to John Skilicorne, of\r\nKirkham. The chapel, with all its appurtenances, passed to the Crown\r\nat the Reformation; and in the report of the Commissioners of Edward\r\nVI., it is stated that “A Stipendarye is founded in the Chapelle of\r\nSyngleton, in Kirkeham, by vertue of a lease made out of the Duchie to\r\nSʳ Richarde Houghton, knight, the 26th day of Februarie, in the ffirst\r\nyere of the raigne of our soveraign lorde the kinge, that nowe is\r\n(1547), unto the ende of 21 yeres the next following; wherein the said\r\nSʳ Richarde covenanteth to pay yerely duringe the said time to a Pryest\r\ncelebrating in the said Chapelle the sum of 49s. The said Chapelle is\r\ndistant from the parishe Church of Kirkeham 4 myles; Richarde Godson,\r\nthe Incumbent, of the age of 38 yeres, hath the said yerely salarie of\r\n49s.” Thomas Houghton, of Lea, the son of the knight, appears to have had\r\nsome difficulty in inducing sundry of the Singleton tenants to recognise\r\nhis right of proprietorship after the death of his father, for we find\r\nhim pleading in the duchy court in 1560-61 that he held the “lands of\r\nthe late kynge in Singleton, also a house called the chapell house, with\r\nthree acres of land in the tenure of Wᵐ Yede, a chapell called Singleton\r\nchapell, in Singleton aforesaid, with the chapell yarde thereunto\r\nbelonging, one house or cottage called Corner-rawe, and a windmill; and\r\nthat the tenants thereof, Robert Carter and James Hall, had never paid\r\nany rent, and refused to do so.”[198]\r\n\r\nIn 1562 the Charity Commissioners of Edward VI. founded a “stipendarye in\r\nthe Chapelle of Syngleton in Kyrkeham.”\r\n\r\nAt the archiepiscopal visitation of the diocese of Chester in 1578,\r\nthe following list of charges was brought against the curate of\r\nSingleton:—“There is not servyse done in due tyme—He kepeth no hous nor\r\nreleveth the poore—He is not dyligent in visitinge the sycke—He doth\r\nnot teach the catechisme—There is no sermons—He churcheth fornycatours\r\nwithout doinge any penaunce—He maketh a donge hill of the chapel yeard,\r\nand he hath lately kepte a typlinge hous and a nowty woman in it.”[199]\r\n\r\nFrom that time we hear no more of the old chapel of Singleton, but the\r\nchapel-house, alluded to above, was at a later period flourishing as\r\nan inn, and bearing the same name; at the Oliverian survey, in 1650,\r\nit was stated that there was a newly erected chapel at Singleton, but\r\nthat it had no endowment or maintenance belonging to it, and that the\r\ninhabitants prayed that it might be constituted a parish church with a\r\n“minister and competent mayntenance allowed.”[200] It is probable that\r\nafter the decline of the Commonwealth this chapel fell into the hands\r\nof the Catholics, for Thomas Tyldesley, of Fox Hall, a Romanist, in\r\nhis diary of 1712, 13 and 14, speaks several times of going “to Great\r\nSingleton to prayers”; and doubtless it is the one alluded to in the\r\nfollowing indenture, bearing the date 29th August, 1749:—“William Shaw,\r\nesq., lord of the manor of Shingleton in yᵉ parish of Kirkham, gave a\r\nchapel belonging to him at Shingleton aforesaid, then used as a popish\r\nchapel, to be used for yᵉ future as a chapel of ease to yᵉ mother church\r\nof Kirkham, for yᵉ benefit of yᵉ inhabitants of Shingleton and of the\r\nadjacent townships; and that the said Wᵐ. Shaw proposed to give £200, to\r\nbe added to a similar sum from Queen Anne’s bounty, for yᵉ endowment of\r\nyᵉ said chapel, in consideration whereof Samuel, lord bishop of Chester\r\nas ordinary, the dean and chapter of Christ Church, Oxford, as patrons,\r\nand Chas. Buck as incumbent, by virtue of an act of George I., grant and\r\ndecree that yᵉ said William Shaw and his heirs and assigns for ever shall\r\nhave yᵉ nomination to and patronage of yᵉ said chapel, as often as it is\r\nvacant.”\r\n\r\nThis chapel was dedicated to St. Anne, and in 1756 it was agreed “by all\r\nparties that the chapel of Singleton should be always considered a place\r\nof public worship according to the liturgy of the Church of England,\r\nand the chapel yard always appropriated to the burying of the dead and\r\nthe support of the minister”; further, the chapel living was declared\r\na perpetual curacy, separate and independent of the mother church of\r\nKirkham, “save and except that the curate must assist the vicar of the\r\nlatter place on Christmas day, Easter day, Whitsunday, Good Friday, and\r\neach sabbath when it is customary to administer the sacrament; also the\r\ntythes, Easter dues, funeral sermons, and all other parochial rights and\r\nduties belonged to the vicarage of Kirkham.”[201]\r\n\r\nThe above is an authentic record of the way in which the chapel of\r\nSingleton passed out of the hands of the Romanists into those of\r\nthe Protestants, but the Rev. W. Thornber, to whom this document\r\nwas evidently unknown, has given in his _History of Blackpool and\r\nits neighbourhood_, a different version of the matter. He states,\r\nwith apparently no greater authority than tradition, that after the\r\nsuppression of the rebellion of 1745, the protestants of the village\r\ncelebrated the 5th of November more zealously than usual, raising\r\ncontributions of peat at every house, and amongst the rest had even\r\nthe presumption to call at that of the priest. The refusal of the\r\necclesiastic to provide his share of fuel so incensed the villagers that\r\nthey ejected him both from his house and the church; and the lord of the\r\nmanor seized this opportunity to convert the chapel into a protestant\r\nplace of worship.\r\n\r\nSingleton chapel was a low building with a thatched roof, the eaves of\r\nwhich came within a short distance of the ground; the priest’s house\r\nwas attached to the chapel and communicated with it by a door into the\r\nsacristy. In 1806 this ancient building, having become much dilapidated,\r\nwas pulled down and replaced, through the liberality of Joseph Hornby,\r\nof Ribby, esq., by a neat gothic structure, having a square tower at one\r\nend, in which was placed a peal of six bells; in 1859 the latter edifice\r\nwas levelled to the ground, and the present handsome and commodious\r\nchurch erected on the site, chiefly through the munificence of the\r\nlate Thomas Miller, esq. The few mural monuments within the church are\r\nnot of any great antiquity, and are _in memoriam_ of the Harrisons and\r\nAtkinsons, of Bankfield. There are no inscriptions of interest in the\r\nchurchyard, beyond those on the stones surmounting the vault belonging\r\nto the Bankfield families just named. In 1869 a separate district or\r\nparish was assigned to this cure, and the present incumbent of the church\r\nacquired the title of vicar.\r\n\r\n  THE CURATES AND VICARS OF SINGLETON.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-----------------------+--------------------------\r\n    Date of   |       NAME.           | Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                       |\r\n  ------------+-----------------------+--------------------------\r\n  About 1545  |Richard Godson         |\r\n   ”    1562  |Thomas Fieldhouse      |\r\n  In 1651     |Cuthbert Harrison, B.A.|\r\n   ” 1749     |John Threlfall, B.A.   |\r\n  About 1809  |Thomas Banks           |\r\n  Before 1843 |William Birley, M.A.   |\r\n  In 1843     |Leonard C. Wood, B.A.  | Resignation of W. Birley\r\n  ------------+-----------------------+--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Cuthbert Harrison was the son of Richard Harrison, of Newton,\r\nin Kirkham parish, and appears to have been the progenitor of the\r\nHarrisons, of Bankfield, being the first of the name on record as holder\r\nof that property. It is doubtful whether this minister was ejected from\r\nSingleton, as generally believed, or not, for in 1662, the date of the\r\nAct of Uniformity which drove so many of the clergy from their cures, he\r\nwas in Ireland, holding the office of minister at Shankel, near Lurgan;\r\nso that if his ejection ever did take place from Singleton it must have\r\nbeen anterior to, and consequently unconnected with, the obnoxious\r\nAct. According to a letter from his son, however, he was ejected from\r\nShankel, and it is probably that circumstance which has given rise to the\r\nsupposition and assertion that he was one of those who suffered in the\r\nFylde for conscience’s sake in 1662. After leaving Ireland he opened a\r\nmeeting-house at Elswick in 1672 by royal license, for the use “of such\r\nas do not conform to the Church of England and are of the persuasion\r\ncommonly called Congregational.” This place of worship was closed shortly\r\nafterwards by a decree of parliament, and Cuthbert Harrison, to escape\r\npersecution, was compelled to hold his services “very privately in the\r\nnight” in his own house, or in one belonging to some member of his\r\ncongregation. “He practysed physic,” says his son, “with good success,\r\nand by it supported his family and gained the favour of the neighbouring\r\ngentry. He baptized his own children, with many others.”\r\n\r\nVicar Clegg, of Kirkham, seems to have grown very wrathful at what he\r\ndoubtless regarded as the presumption of Cuthbert Harrison, in taking\r\nupon himself the right to baptize children and solemnize matrimony, and\r\npresented him before the ecclesiastical court on a charge of “marrying\r\none James Benson, of Warles, and baptizing a child of his.” The inquiry\r\nresulted in both Harrison and Benson being excommunicated; but the\r\nformer was not deterred by this ban from repairing to the church of\r\nKirkham, much to the indignation of Mr. Clegg, who on one occasion was\r\nso much disturbed on seeing the irrepressible excommunicant in the\r\nchancel, whilst he engaged with the sermon, that he lost the thread of\r\nhis discourse, and being unable to find the place amongst his notes,\r\n“was silent for some time.” Smarting under the additional annoyance\r\nthe vicar ordered the churchwardens to eject Mr. Harrison from the\r\nbuilding at once, but that gentleman refused to leave unless Mr. Clegg\r\nin person performed the duty of turning him out; incensed at his show of\r\nobstinacy, the vicar appealed to Christopher Parker, esq., of Bradkirk\r\nHall, a justice of the peace, who was seated within six feet of Mr.\r\nHarrison, to remove him, but the magistrate refused to act in the matter,\r\nand Mr. Clegg was obliged to descend from the pulpit and undertake the\r\nunpleasant task himself. He walked up to the offender, and, taking him\r\nby the sleeve, desired him to go out from the church; Mr. Harrison went\r\npeaceably with the vicar, but had no sooner passed out through the\r\nchancel door than he exclaimed in a loud voice “It is time to go when the\r\ndevil drives.”\r\n\r\nShortly after this episode Mr. Clegg sued Cuthbert Harrison for the sum\r\nof 120s., being a fine of 20s. per month extending over six months, for\r\nnon-attendance at the parish church. The defendant pleaded that when he\r\nhad attempted to attend the service at Kirkham he had been ejected from\r\nthe church by the plaintiff himself, and the judge who summed up the\r\nevidence in favour of the defendant, remarked—“There is fiddle to be\r\nhanged and fiddle not to be hanged.” The verdict went against Mr. Clegg,\r\nwho reaped only the payment of his own and defendant’s costs from this\r\npiece of persecution.\r\n\r\nCuthbert Harrison died in 1681, and “a great entreaty,” writes his son,\r\n“was made to Mr. Clegg to suffer his body to be buried in the church;\r\nhe-was prevailed with, and Mr. Harrison was interred a little within the\r\ngreat door, which has since been the burial place of the family.” The\r\nfirst epitaph below is said, by his son, to have been fixed upon “Cuth.\r\nHarrison’s grave by Mr. Clegg”; the second one is a retaliation, reported\r\nto have been substituted by some local rhymester, after effacing the\r\noriginal one:—\r\n\r\n  1\r\n\r\n    “Here lies Cud,\r\n    Who never did good,\r\n  But always was in strife;\r\n    Oh! let the Knave\r\n    Lie in his grave,\r\n  And ne’er return to life.”\r\n\r\n  2\r\n\r\n    “Here lies Cud,\r\n    Who still did good,\r\n  And never was in strife,\r\n    But with Dick Clegg,\r\n    Who furiously opposed\r\n  His holy life.”\r\n\r\nIn 1768 another chapel was erected by the Romanists at Singleton by\r\nsubscription, and almost immediately the officiating priest, the Rev.\r\nFather Watts, renounced his creed, publicly recanting at Kirkham; he died\r\nin 1773, when minister at the episcopal chapel of Wrea-green. According\r\nto Mr. Thornber, the priests of Singleton could seldom assign a better\r\nreason for desiring a removal to another sphere of labour, than that\r\nthey were surfeited with wild ducks from the “carrs.” The chapel was\r\nrebuilt subsequently, but closed when the present one at Poulton had been\r\ncompleted and opened a few years.\r\n\r\nMains or Maynes Hall is situated in the manor of Little Singleton, and\r\nappears on ancient maps as Monk’s Hall. The original Hall was built in\r\nthe form of a quadrangle, the chapel being on the right and the kitchen\r\non the left; the latter, taken down rather more than half a century ago,\r\nwas roofed with tiles, about six inches square, piled thickly upon one\r\nanother, and contained several secret recesses or hiding places, one of\r\nwhich was situated near the mantel-piece, and another, entered from the\r\nfloor above by means of a ladder, showed manifest evidences of having\r\nbeen occupied. The present Hall is less antique in its construction and\r\narrangements than its predecessor. In 1745 a party of Scotch rebels\r\nfeasted there; and George IV., when Prince of Wales, is said to have\r\nbeen an occasional visitor at the mansion. The mantel-piece of the\r\ndrawing-room was formerly adorned with a family painting of the Howards,\r\ndukes of Norfolk; and adjoining that spacious apartment is a small room,\r\nwhich appears to have been an oratory, containing relics of distinguished\r\nsaints. The outside wall of the old chapel bears the date 1686, and\r\nwithin are a gilded altar in a state of dilapidation, a large picture of\r\nthe ‘Virgin and Infant,’ a coat of arms, and various scraps of scriptural\r\ntexts and ordinances of the church of Rome.[202]\r\n\r\nCardinal Allen, of Rossall Hall, the brother-in-law of William Hesketh,\r\nwho was living at Mains Hall at the opening of the seventeenth century,\r\nis said to have frequently secreted himself in the hiding places there,\r\nduring the time he was engaged in endeavouring to alienate the loyalty of\r\nthe catholics of this district, and induce them to assist the invasion of\r\nPhilip of Spain, whose forces were expected to land at Peel in Morecambe\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nThe Heskeths were the first tenants of Mains Hall of whom we have any\r\nnotice, and the above William was the first of the family to reside\r\nthere; a full account of the descent and intermarriages of the Heskeths\r\nof Mains will be found in the chapter on ancient families of the Fylde.\r\n\r\nThe Hall and estate are now the property of Thomas Fitzherbert\r\nBrockholes, of Claughton, esq.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF GREAT AND LITTLE SINGLETON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    325    396    501    499    391    293    338    317\r\n\r\nThe area of the township comprises 2,860 statute acres.\r\n\r\nLITTLE ECCLESTON-WITH-LARBRICK. The _Testa de Nevill_ records that Adam\r\nde Eccleston and William de Molines, with three others, had part of a\r\nknight’s fee in Eccleston and Larbrick, about 1300. In 1500 Richard\r\nKerston had 60 acres in Little Eccleston, a portion of which passed on\r\nhis death in 1546 to John ffrance, who had married one of his daughters.\r\nThe ffrances retained their possessions until 1817, when they were\r\nbequeathed by the last of the line to Thomas Wilson, of Preston, who\r\nadopted their surname.[203] Larbrick was held in 1336 by William de\r\nCoucy, of Gynes, but in 1358 it belonged to Sir William Molyneux, of\r\nSefton, in whose family it remained until about 1601, at which date\r\nWilliam Burgh, of Burgh, near Chorley, died, holding it. Subsequently\r\nthe manor passed, through the daughter of William Burgh, to Edward\r\nShuttleworth, of Thornton Hall, who had espoused her grand-daughter. The\r\nlast proprietor here named died in 1673, and the estate was divided,\r\na moiety going to Dr. Charles Leigh, who had married one of his two\r\ndaughters and co-heiresses, and the second mediety to Richard Longworth,\r\nwho was the husband of the other. Dr. Leigh mortgaged his share, which\r\neventually was obtained by Richard Harrison, of Bankfield; whilst that\r\nof Richard Longworth, passed, about 1700, to the Hornbys, of Poulton,\r\nand afterwards to the Pedders, of Preston, who held it for more than\r\na century. Mr. Whiteside, who purchased it from the Rev. Jno. Pedder,\r\nis now owner. Larbrick Hall, for long a seat of the noble house of\r\nMolyneux, is at present represented by a farm-house. Dr. Leigh mentions\r\nan extremely cold well in Larbrick, in which fish were unable to survive\r\nbeyond a few seconds.\r\n\r\nIn 1697, William Gillow left 10s. a year, the rental of some land, to be\r\ngiven to two or more poor persons of the township at Christmas, and in\r\n1720, a further annual sum of 20s. was left for the same object by George\r\nGillow.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF LITTLE ECCLESTON-WITH-LARBRICK.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    178    192    224    230    199    215    209    192\r\n\r\nThe area of the township is 1,198 statute acres.\r\n\r\nCLIFTON-WITH-SALWICK. As early as 1100 William de Clifton had lands\r\nin Clifton and Salwick, and from that date to the present time, with\r\none short interval, the manors have descended in the same family, of\r\nwhich Jno. Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham, is the head.[204] Clifton\r\nand Salwick Halls, the ancient residences of the Cliftons, are now\r\ncomparatively modern buildings. The church of Lund is situated in\r\nSalwick, and possessed a chantry so far back as 1516. The first notice\r\nof any connection between Kirkham church and Lund chapel occurs amongst\r\nthe records of the “Thirty-men” in 1701, thus:—“Matt. Hall, ch warden, of\r\nKirkham, in 1688, set up a scandalous trough for a font in Lund chapel;\r\nand 4 sackfuls of moss he then carried from the church to repair the said\r\nchapel, and so it first began to be repaired at the parish charge.” The\r\nold chapel was pulled down in 1824, and a stone church erected. In 1852 a\r\nchancel was added, and more recently a tower. Lund and Newton-with-Scales\r\nwere constituted an ecclesiastical parish in 1840. The church is\r\ndedicated to St. John, and the dean and chapter of Christ Church, Oxford,\r\nare the patrons.\r\n\r\n  CURATES AND VICARS OF LUND.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------------------+--------------------------\r\n    Date of   |       NAME.       |    Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                   |\r\n  ------------+-------------------+--------------------------\r\n  Before 1648 |Joseph Harrison    |\r\n    ”    1732 |Thomas Cockin      |\r\n    ”    1769 |Benj.

Harrison, brother to Cuthbert Harrison, was ejected in the\r\nyear 1662, for refusing to comply with the Act of Uniformity.\r\n\r\nAlice Hankinson, left in 1680, £5 for the use of the minister, and Alice\r\nClitherall a like sum for the same purpose. Thomas Smith bequeathed,\r\nin 1685, the annual interest of £20 to Lund chapel. The sum of £10 is\r\nreceived yearly under a trust of 1668, 50s. being for the vicar, and the\r\nsurplus for the poor. The school was established about 1682, by a legacy\r\nof £60 left by John Dickson, half the interest to go to the minister of\r\nLund chapel, providing he belonged to the Church of England, and the\r\nother moiety to the master of the school. The interest of £10, origin\r\nunknown, is paid each year to the trustees of the school.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF CLIFTON-WITH-SALWICK.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    552    575    608    508    538    471    447    447\r\n\r\nThe township contains 3,776 statute acres.\r\n\r\nTREALES, ROSEACRE, AND WHARLES. The ancient manor of Treales embraced the\r\nthree estates of Treales, Roseacre, and Wharles, being computed in the\r\nDomesday Book to contain two carucates of arable soil. In 1207 Treales\r\nwas granted to Robert de Vavassour, the father-in-law of Theobald Walter,\r\nand subsequently it descended in the Butler family until 1673, when the\r\n9th earl of Derby acquired it with his wife, the daughter of Thomas\r\nButler, the lord Ossory. The present earl of Derby is lord of the manor,\r\nand holds a court annually.\r\n\r\nThe church, a plain stone building with nave and chancel only, was\r\nerected in 1853, and endowed five years later by the dean and chapter of\r\nChrist Church, Oxford. The Rev. J. Hodgkin is the incumbent.\r\n\r\nWilliam Grimbaldson, M.D., left £300 in 1725, the interest to be used\r\nfor binding out poor apprentices in Treales, whose parents received no\r\nparish relief. Boulton’s and Porter’s charities are rentals amounting to\r\nabout £12 a-year, to be given to poor persons of the township. Bridgett’s\r\ncharity is the interest of £15 for the poor of Wharles.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF TREALES, ROSEACRE, AND WHARLES.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    675    671    760    756    709    696    632    625\r\n\r\nThe township has an area of 4,015 statute acres.\r\n\r\nNEWTON-WITH-SCALES. Newton appears in the Domesday Book as containing two\r\ncarucates. In 1324 William de Clifton had 60 acres in Scales; and in 1354\r\nAdam de Bradkirk held land in Newton. John Hornby, of Newton-with-Scales,\r\nleft in 1707, the residue of his estate, after certain bequests, to six\r\ntrustees to found and endow the present Blue Coat School; and in 1809 the\r\nfunds of the institution were increased by a legacy of £800, under the\r\nwill of James Boys, of London, an old pupil.

Hambleton was held during the reign of King John by Geoffrey,\r\nthe Crossbowman, or de Hackensall, from whom it descended to his\r\nson-in-law Richard de Sherburne, and afterwards to Robert de Sherburne,\r\nthe son of the latter. The manor was held successively by different\r\nmembers of the Sherburne family until 1363, when it passed to Richard\r\nde Bailey, who had married the daughter and heiress of the last male\r\nSherburne, and adopted the maiden surname of his wife. Hence the title\r\nof the manorial lords remained unchanged up to 1717, when the property\r\nbecame the possession of the Duchess of Ormond, the sole child of Sir\r\nNicholas Sherburne, who died at that date. After the decease of the\r\nDuchess of Ormond, without issue, Hambleton passed to Edward, the son\r\nof William Weld, of Lulworth Castle, by his marriage with the sister\r\nof Sir Nicholas Sherburne. The descendants of Edward Weld still retain\r\nsome portion of the soil, but a considerable proportion has been sold in\r\nrecent years.\r\n\r\nBishop Gastrell affirms that the episcopal chapel of Hambleton\r\nwas consecrated in 1567. In 1650 the Parliamentary Commissioners\r\nreported:—“There is no allowance to the minister, but only £5 per an.\r\npayd by Richard Sherburne, esq., lord of the manor, and £40 per an. by\r\norder from the committee for plundered ministers. The inhabitants desire\r\nit may be made a parish, and the township of Rawcliffe, lying within a\r\nmyle of it and four miles from their parish church, may be annexed to\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe present church was erected in 1749, and is a plain whitewashed\r\nbuilding, without a tower or any attempt at architectural display.\r\nAttached to the south wall within are three tablets inscribed thus:—\r\n\r\n  “Beneath this marble are deposited the remains of Mary Ramsden,\r\n  daughter and heiress of the rev. Christʳ. Westby Alderston,\r\n  late vicar of St. Michael’s in this county, and wife of Rowland\r\n  Ramsden of Halifax. She was born Aug. 17ᵗʰ, 1768 and died Nov.\r\n  6ᵗʰ, 1764.”\r\n\r\n  “Sacred to the memory of George Bickerstaffe of Hambleton,\r\n  gent., died May 3ʳᵈ, 1766; Jenny Alderston, his granddaughter,\r\n  died May 16ᵗʰ, 1770; and Agnes, wife of the rev. Christʳ. Westby\r\n  Alderston, widow of Richᵈ. Harrison of Bankfield, and daughter of\r\n  George Bickerstaffe, died March 14ᵗʰ, 1820.”\r\n\r\n  “Sacred to the memory of the rev. Thomas Butcher, B.A., for 39\r\n  years the respected incumbent of this chapel. Erected by the\r\n  voluntary contributions of his parishioners.”\r\n\r\nOn the aisles of the church are three gravestones, bearing the following\r\ninscriptions:—\r\n\r\n  “In this aisle lie the remains of the rev. John Field, B.A. and\r\n  minister of this place, who died 21st April, 1765; also his wife\r\n  and children.”\r\n\r\n  “Here lies the body of Dorothy, wife of Richard Carter of\r\n  Hambleton, who died 14th May, 1807.”\r\n\r\n  “William, son of James Norris of Liverpool, buried the 29th of\r\n  June 1692—Though Boreas’ Blast and Neptune’s Waves have tost me\r\n  to and fro, yet a spite on both by God’s decree I harbour here\r\n  below: Here at anchor I doe ride with many of our fleet, yet once\r\n  again I must set sail my Generall Christ to meet.”[205]\r\n\r\nIn earlier days, when the church was held by the Roman Catholics, the\r\nburial ground was evidently of much greater extent than at present, and\r\nsurrounded by an immense moat, between six and seven yards wide, and of\r\na considerable depth. In a field lying to the east of the church can\r\nnow be seen the ancient limits of the ground in that direction, bounded\r\nby a long stretch of the old moat in a very fair state of preservation,\r\nbut of course somewhat contracted by accumulations of vegetation; and in\r\nanother plot of ground to the west, may be traced by a slight depression\r\nthe course of the same trench, marking the westerly extent of the yard.\r\nThe northerly length of the moat passed behind the present churchyard,\r\nand a portion of it, about two yards wide, is still to be seen there, the\r\nremainder of its breadth being filled in and included in the cemetery.\r\nThe southerly stretch of this ancient ditch or fosse ran just within\r\nthe railings, protecting the burial ground in front. When the existing\r\nwalls were built round the yard great difficulty was met with in forming\r\na good foundation over the site of the moat at different points, as it\r\nwas found to be filled in with fragments of bricks, mortar, and general\r\nrubbish, which seems to indicate that it was abolished when the church\r\nitself was in course of reconstruction, and that the old building\r\nmaterials and _debris_ were used for the purpose of raising it to the\r\ncommon level, indicating that the work must have been accomplished\r\neither at the rebuilding of 1749, or at some previous and unrecorded\r\none. The moat would be crossed by a bridge of fair dimensions, which was\r\nprobably situated on the west side, as the sexton lately discovered the\r\nwell-preserved remains of a straight footpath, paved with long tiles, and\r\nrunning from the church for some distance towards the site of the moat in\r\nthat direction; the path was between two and three feet below the surface\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\nThe church was separated from the mother edifice of Kirkham, and had an\r\nindependent district assigned to it in 1846. The incumbent has the title\r\nof vicar.\r\n\r\n  CURATES AND VICARS OF HAMBLETON.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------\r\n    Date of   |        NAME.          |    Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                       |\r\n  ------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------\r\n  About 1648  |Robert Cunningham      |\r\n  Before 1662 |William Bullock        |\r\n  About 1725  |William Whitehead, B.A.|\r\n  In  1735    |John Field, B.A.       | Resignation of W.

In 1797 the only endowment it can boast\r\nof was left by Matthew Lewtas, a native of Hambleton, and consisted of\r\n£200, the interest of which had to be given to John, the son of George\r\nHall, of Hambleton, until he reached the age of twenty-one; and if before\r\nor at that time he was appointed master of the school he had to continue\r\nto receive the whole of the income whilst he held such mastership, but\r\nif, although he was willing to accept the post, some other person should\r\nbe selected for it, then when he came of age, half of the income passed\r\nfrom him to the school, and he retained the other moiety until his death,\r\nwhen it also went to increase the stipend of the master. The other\r\ncondition of the will applied to the master, and obliged him in return\r\nfor the interest or income of the £200, to teach as many poor children\r\nof Hambleton as the money would pay for. John Hall never obtained the\r\nappointment, so that the present master receives the full interest of the\r\nbequest, which is invested on mortgage.\r\n\r\nThe poor of Hambleton have £2 annually distributed amongst them through\r\nthe generosity of Sir Nicholas Sherburne, of Stonyhurst, who in 1706,\r\nwhen lord of the manor of Hambleton, charged his estate of Lentworth Hall\r\nwith this charity.\r\n\r\nThe yearly interest of £10 was given for the benefit of poor housekeepers\r\nin Hambleton by Mary, the daughter of vicar Clegg, of Kirkham, and the\r\nwife of Emanuel Nightingale, of York, gent., who was born in 1673.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF HAMBLETON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    252    273    338    334    349    346    366    351\r\n\r\nThe statute acres of the township amount to 1,603.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPARISH OF LYTHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYTHAM. At the commencement of the Norman dynasty, when William I.\r\ninstituted a survey of his newly-conquered territory, the name of the\r\ntown and parish which will occupy our attention throughout the present\r\nchapter was written _Lidun_, and was estimated to contain two carucates\r\nof arable land. How long this orthography continued in use is difficult\r\nto say, but it could not have been for much more than a century, as\r\namongst certain legal documents in the reign of King John, the locality\r\nis referred to under the style of _Lethum_, an appellation which seems\r\nto have adhered to it until comparatively recent years. The derivation\r\nof the latter title is apparently from the Anglo-Saxon word _lethe_,\r\nsignifying a barn, and points obviously to an agricultural origin,\r\nwhilst the more antique name of _Lidun_ is possibly a corruption of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _lade_, implying a river discharging itself into the sea,\r\nthat is, its mouth or estuary, and _tun_, a town.\r\n\r\nShortly before the termination of the reign of Richard I. in 1199,\r\nRichard Fitz Roger, who is supposed to have belonged to the Banastre\r\nfamily, gave all his lands in Lethum, with the church of the same vill,\r\nand all things belonging to the church, to God, and the monks of Durham,\r\nthat they might establish a Benedictine cell there to the honour of St.\r\nMary and St. Cuthbert.[206] The following is a copy of the document by\r\nwhich the transfer was effected:—“Richard Fitz Roger, to all men, both\r\nFrench and English, who may see this letter, greeting: Let all and each\r\nof you know, that I, with the consent and wish of my wife, Margaret, and\r\nmy heirs, for the Salvation of my lord, Earl John, and for the souls of\r\nmy Father and Mother, and mine and my heirs, have given and granted, and\r\nwith these presents confirm as a pure and perpetual offering to God and\r\nthe Blessed Mary and St. Cuthbert, and the monks of Durham, all my estate\r\nof Lethum, with the church at the same vill, with all things appertaining\r\nto it, in order to build a house of their own order; namely, within\r\nthese divisions—From the ditch on the western side of the cemetery of\r\nKilgrimol (Lytham Common) over which I have erected a Cross, and from the\r\nsame ditch and Cross eastward, going along the Curridmere (Wild Moss or\r\nTarns) beyond the Great Moss, and the brook, as far as Balholme (Ballam),\r\nwhich brook runs towards Snincbrigg (Sluice Bridge). Likewise from\r\nBalholme directly across the moss, which my lord John, earl of Moreton,\r\ndivided between himself and me, as far as the northern part of Estholmker\r\n(Estham), going eastward as far as the division of the water which comes\r\nfrom Birckholme (Birks), and divides Etholmker and Brimaker (Bryning),\r\nfollowing this division of water southward as far as the middle point\r\nbetween Etholme and Coulurugh (Kellamergh), and thus returning towards\r\nthe west and going southward across the Moss as far as la Pull from the\r\nother side of Snartsalte (Saltcoats), as it falls upon the sand of the\r\nsea, and thus going southward across to Ribril to the waterside, and\r\nthus following the line of the water to the sea on the west, and so to\r\nthe ditch and across aforementioned,” etc., etc. In a charter dated\r\n1200-1, it is specified that the whole of the lands of Lytham, amounting\r\nto two carucates, had been presented by King John when earl of Moreton,\r\nto Richard Fitz Roger, by whom, as just shown, they were immediately\r\nconveyed to the monks of Durham.\r\n\r\nThere are unfortunately no means of ascertaining the extent or appearance\r\nof the Benedictine cell established at Lytham, but its site would seem to\r\nhave been that now occupied by Lytham Hall, in the walls of some of the\r\noffices attached to which remains of the ancient monastic edifice have\r\nbeen incorporated. Dr. Kuerden alludes, in a manuscript preserved in the\r\nChetham library, to an undated claim of feudal privileges in Lytham, by\r\nwhich the prior of Durham asserted his right to have view of frankpledge\r\nin his manor of Lytham, with waif, stray, and infangthefe[207];\r\nemendations of the assize of bread and beer; wrecks of the sea; exemption\r\nfor himself and tenants in Lytham from suit to the county and wapentake,\r\nand from fines and penalties; to have soc, sac, and theam;[208] and\r\nfinally, to have free warren over all his lands in Lytham, and all royal\r\nfish taken there. During the reign of Edward I. the legality of the\r\necclesiastic’s assumption of the sole right to wreckage was called in\r\nquestion, ultimately ending in litigation, and at Trinity Term, York,\r\nthe verdict of the jury was given against him. In the twenty-third year\r\nof his sovereignty, Edward I. granted the wreck, waif, and stray of\r\nLytham to his brother Edmund, the earl of Lancaster. Amongst the Rolls of\r\nthe Duchy is the record of an agreement, entered into in 1271, between\r\nRanulphus de Daker, sheriff of Lancaster, Richard le Botiler, and others,\r\nfor arranging and fixing, with the consent and approval of Stephen, the\r\nprior of Lytham, the boundaries between the land of Lytham and Kilgrimol,\r\nand that of Layton. The priors of Lytham were entirely dependent on the\r\nparent house until 1443, when they solicited and induced Pope Eugenius\r\nto issue an edict declaring the prior of that date and his successors\r\nperpetual in their office and no longer removable at the will and\r\ndictation of the monks of Durham. Afterwards, in the same year, letters\r\npatent were received at the Lytham cell, pardoning the application to the\r\npapal See and granting the request;[209] but the union between the two\r\nhouses was not absolutely dissolved, for we find that, in addition to the\r\nvarious properties at Lytham and Durham continuing to be valued together,\r\nthe cell and domain of the former place were granted in 2 Mary, 1554, to\r\nSir Thomas Holcroft as part of the possessions of the Durham convent.\r\nIn 1606 the knight transferred his rights and lands in Lytham to Sir\r\nCuthbert Clifton, in exchange for certain estates on the opposite side of\r\nthe river Ribble. John Talbot Clifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, a descendant\r\nof the latter gentleman, is the present lord of the manor. Reverting to\r\nthe Benedictine cell it is seen from an ecclesiastical valuation, taken\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII., probably about the time of the Reformation,\r\nthat the annual income of the institution was derived from the following\r\nsources:—\r\n\r\n                 “Cella de Lethum in com’ Lancastr’\r\n                     Rad’us Blaxton prior Ibd’m\r\n\r\n                                                               £ s. d.\r\n  Situ celle pdce cum pt’ pastur’ & terr’ arabilib 3 p annu    8  8 0\r\n\r\n  Redd’ & firmis in divs’ villis viz—villa de Lethum,\r\n  £21 11s. 0d.; Esthowme, £3 7s. 0d.; Medholm, £7 2s. 8d.;\r\n  Pilhowes cum Bankehousse, 12s. 11d.; Frekkylton cum\r\n  Ranklysse, 7s. 3d.; Bylsborrow cum Carleton, 13s. 0d.;\r\n  Warton, Goosenargh & Kyllermargh, £1 1s. 8d.                34 15 6\r\n                                                              -------\r\n                                         Total               £43  3 6”\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the wording of the foundation-charter of the cell of\r\nLytham that a church existed there at that date, and Reginald of Durham\r\naffirms that the grand-father of Richard Fitz Roger pulled down the\r\noriginal church of Lytham, which had been built of shingle, and erected\r\nanother of stone, dedicating it to St. Cuthbert.[210] This event must\r\nhave taken place anterior to the establishment of the Benedictines in\r\nthe locality, and is possibly related by the Durham ecclesiastic as a\r\nbrief account of the stone church standing there when the grant of lands,\r\netc., was made to his monastery by Fitz Roger. Amongst the number of\r\nhistorical fragments collected by Gregson is a notice to the effect that\r\nThomas de Thweng was rector of the church of Lytham in 22 Edward III.\r\n(1349), and founded a chantry of twelve in the parish church “to pray for\r\nthe good estate of himself and Henry, Lord Perci, and for the souls of\r\ntheir ancestors.” Thomas de Thweng was descended from Lucy, granddaughter\r\nof Helewise, the eldest sister of William de Lancaster, and in 1374,\r\nvery likely the year of his death, held the manor of Garstang.[211] The\r\nedifice existing until 1770, when another church, also dedicated to\r\nSt. Cuthbert, was erected on its site, was a low building, constructed\r\nof cobble stones, the walls being more than a yard in thickness and\r\npenetrated by five windows, one of which was situated at the east end,\r\nand the others at the sides. The main entrance was protected by a porch.\r\nFrom the scanty description preserved of the general features of this\r\nantique specimen of ecclesiastical architecture, it has been conjectured\r\nthat its origin might be traced back to the time of Henry VIII. Within\r\nthe erection the seats, which were of black oak, ornamented with scrolls,\r\nwere arranged in four rows, two running down the centre and one down each\r\nside, whilst the north side of a small chancel was set apart for the\r\nchoristers. The pulpit was fixed against the south wall; and the Cliftons\r\npossessed an old canopied seat, the precise station of which cannot be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nOn the demolition of this church in 1770, its successor arose with a\r\nsomewhat more pretentious exterior, having a low tower abutting the west\r\nextremity. The interior of the latter structure contained several objects\r\nof interest, amongst which may be noticed two tables fastened to the wall\r\nand inscribed as under:—\r\n\r\nFIRST TABLE.\r\n\r\n  “Charities to Lytham church.\r\n\r\n  “1765.\r\n\r\n  “The honourable Countess Dowager Gower, one hundred and fifty\r\n  pounds. Governors of Queen Anne’s Bounty, two hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n  “1768.\r\n\r\n  “Ryheads in Goosnargh, purchased with the above four hundred\r\n  pounds. Thomas Clifton, Esq., added seven pounds per annum, to be\r\n  paid of Bamber’s estate in Layton, to the old stipend of twenty\r\n  pounds per annum. Governors of Queen Anne’s Bounty purchased\r\n  six acres and three perches of land with the above two hundred\r\n  pounds, from Barker’s estate; it adjoins Ryheads.\r\n\r\n  “1770.\r\n\r\n  “This church was rebuilded. John Gibson, minister. William\r\n  Silcock and William Gaulter, churchwardens.”\r\n\r\nSECOND TABLE.\r\n\r\n  “1801.\r\n\r\n  “Subscriptions in the parish, two hundred pounds. Governors of\r\n  Queen Anne’s Bounty laid out the above two hundred pounds in the\r\n  purchase of a rent charge of five per cent. per annum, payable\r\n  off Bamber’s estate in Layton.\r\n\r\n  “1814.\r\n\r\n  “John Clifton, Esq., one hundred and thirty-one pounds. William\r\n  Hornby, Esq., sixty-five pounds eight shillings. Joseph, Thomas,\r\n  and John Hornby, Esqs., ten pounds each, making thirty pounds.\r\n  Rev. Robert Lister, fifty pounds. L. Webbe, Esq., ten pounds.\r\n  Joseph Benbow, five pounds. Captain Thomas Cookson, ten pounds.\r\n  Richard Cookson, ten pounds. Cornelius Crookall, ten pounds. John\r\n  Cardwell, ten pounds.\r\n\r\n  “Smaller subscriptions in the parish, sixty-eight pounds twelve\r\n  shillings. Governors of Queen Anne’s Bounty, six hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n  “Total amount, one thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n  “Purchased five acres, one rood, and two perches of land, of\r\n  eight yards to the perch, in Layton-cum-Warbreck, with the above\r\n  one thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n  “Rev. Robert Lister, B.A., minister. Thomas Cookson and John\r\n  Cookson, churchwardens.”\r\n\r\nOn each side of the altar, at the east end of the church, were several\r\nmural marble monuments erected in memory of certain members of the\r\nClifton family, whose remains had been interred within the walls of the\r\nsacred edifice. Thomas Clifton was the first of this family buried at\r\nLytham, and on his tomb was inscribed:—“Here lie interred the mortal\r\nremains of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, esquire; who died on the 16th of\r\nDec., 1784, in the 38th year of his age. Requiescat in pace.”\r\n\r\nAnother monument, near to the former one, bore the following\r\ninscription:—“D.O.M. Here lies dead the body of Ann Clifton, wife of\r\nThomas Clifton, of Lytham, esq.; daughter of Sir Carnaby Haggerstone,\r\nBaronet: but her name will live to future ages. Wonder not, reader; in\r\nher was seen whatever is amiable in a daughter, wife, mother, friend,\r\nand Christian. Admire her, man; a pattern to her sex. O! woman, imitate.\r\nShe died in the 37th year of her age, on the 22nd day of February, 1760.\r\nRequiescat in pace.”\r\n\r\nThe memorial writing over a third tomb ran thus:—“Here lies the body\r\nof Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, esq.; who departed this life in the 56th\r\nyear of his age, on the 11th day of May, 1783. R.I.P.;” whilst a fourth\r\nmonument had these lines upon it:—“Here lies the body of Jane Clifton,\r\nwife of Thomas Clifton, of Lytham, Esq.; daughter of the Right Hon. the\r\nEarl of Abingdon, who departed this life in the 61st year of her age, on\r\nthe 14th day of Feb., 1791. R.I.P.”\r\n\r\nA white marble tablet fixed against the south wall, contained the annexed\r\nnotice:—“In memory of Elizabeth Clifton, wife of John Clifton, of Lytham,\r\nEsq.; and daughter of Thomas Horsley Widdrington Riddell, of Swinburne\r\nCastle, in the county of Northumberland, esq.; who departed this life in\r\nthe 63rd year of her age, on the 19th day of November, 1825. Requiescat\r\nin pace.”\r\n\r\nSixty-four years from the date of its erection this church was also\r\npulled down, having become unable to accommodate the increasing influxes\r\nof visitors during the summer; and on the 20th of March, 1834, the\r\nfoundation stone of the existing pile was laid by the late Thomas\r\nClifton, esq., of Lytham Hall, who contributed £500 towards the cost of\r\nthe building. Mrs. Fisher, the widow of a local physician, contributed\r\n£300, and the subscriptions for the necessary work were further augmented\r\nby a grant from the Church Building and Extension Society. The church,\r\nwhich comprises nave, side aisles, chancel, and embattled tower, contains\r\nthe monuments of the Cliftons already enumerated, and three additional\r\nmarbles, one of which, at the entrance to the chancel, records that “in\r\nthe family vault near this place lies the body of Hetty, daughter of\r\nPelegrine Treves, esq., and widow of the late Thomas Clifton, esq., of\r\nClifton and Lytham; she died on the 4th of June, 1864, aged 68 years.”\r\nThe other attached to the opposite side of the entrance is _in memoriam_\r\nof “Thomas Clifton (eldest son of John Clifton, esq., by Elizabeth,\r\nhis wife) of Clifton and Lytham, who died 17th February, 1851, aged 63\r\nyears”; whilst the third, in the chancel itself, is to the memory of\r\n“John Clifton, of Lytham, esq., who departed this life on the 25th of\r\nMarch, 1832, aged 68 years. Requiescat in Pace.” Against the wall of\r\nthe south side aisle is a tablet surmounted by a cross and inscribed\r\nthus:—“In memory of Richard Barton Robinson, born July 28: A: D: 1804,\r\ndied August 9: A: D: 1872, vicar of Lytham for 36 years. This cross is\r\ngratefully erected by his parishioners, A.D. 1875.” A similar tablet\r\nin the north aisle is erected to the “memory of Edward and Sarah Jane\r\nHoughton, by their only surviving son. E. H. born April 23: 1807: died\r\nDecember 15: 1869. S. J. H. born September 26: 1803: died April 21:\r\n1872.” The east window, beautifully emblazoned, “is dedicated by her\r\nfriends and neighbours, to the memory of Ellen Fisher,” born 1759, died\r\n1837. Similar windows, north and south, in the chancel, were given by\r\nThomas Clifton, esq., in 1845, also a second, on the south side, by\r\nLady Eleanor Cecily Clifton, in 1871. The north side aisle contains six\r\nhandsome windows inserted respectively to the memories of Anne Shepherd\r\nBirley, died 1872; James Fair, died 1871, by J. T. Clifton, esq.; Sarah\r\nAgnes, wife of W. C. Dowding, clerk, M.A., died 1869, by her maternal\r\naunt, Agnes Newsham; her mother and sisters, by Anne Wilson, 1871;\r\nMargaret Hornby, died 1866; William and Agnes Birdsworth and of their\r\nfather and mother, by their surviving relatives. In the south side aisle\r\nare two memorial windows, one being to Henry Miller, died 1859, aged 46\r\nyears, and his infant son, died 1852, by his wife Caroline A. Miller; and\r\nthe other to John Stevenson, died 1872, aged 78 years; Jane Stevenson,\r\ndied 1872, aged 64 years; William Elsworth Stevenson, died 1869, aged\r\n31 years; and Jane Stevenson, died 1872, aged 25 years. The clerestory\r\nof the church is lighted by twelve single windows, each bearing the\r\nrepresentation of a saint, all of which were presented by private\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n  PERPETUAL CURATES AND VICARS OF ST.

The tower contains a peal of eight bells. John Talbot Clifton,\r\nesq., of Lytham Hall, is the patron of the living. The parish register\r\nbegins in 1679.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard, which is encircled by a thick plantation of trees,\r\npossesses many very handsome monuments, but none of historical\r\nimportance. The oldest gravestone still legible lies in close proximity\r\nto the ancient sun-dial, and bears the date 1672. The parish schools,\r\nerected in 1853, stand in Church Road.\r\n\r\nDodsworth informs us that in the neighbourhood of Lytham there existed,\r\nin 1601, a village called Waddum Thorp, and that eleven years previously\r\nthe Horsebank was a green pasture for cattle. Dr. Leigh affirms that the\r\nhamlet in question was peopled by some Saxon fishermen. The locality\r\nalluded to in the foundation document as Snartsalte is now denominated\r\nSaltcoats, and was, like several neighbouring places, the site of a\r\nsalt manufactory in remote days. Geoffrey Gillet worked the Saltcoats\r\nmanufactory. Cambden in describing the extractive process says:—“They\r\npour water from time to time upon heaps of sand till it grows brackish,\r\nand then with a turf fire they boil it into a white salt.” Bowden wrote,\r\nin 1722, concerning the same subject:—“On many places on the coast the\r\ninhabitants gather heaps of sand together which, having lain some time,\r\nthey put into troughs full of holes at the bottom, pour water upon them,\r\nand boil the lees into white salt.”\r\n\r\nAbout 1800 the hamlet comprised several mud and thatch cottages,\r\ninterspersed here and there with a fair number of habitations of\r\nrecent origin, built with bricks and slated. There were also two inns\r\nin existence, the Wheat Sheaf and the Clifton Arms, besides two small\r\nlicensed houses. The Wheat Sheaf was erected in Clifton Street during the\r\nyear 1794, and almost simultaneously, but a little later, the Clifton\r\nArms arose on the opposite side of the thoroughfare, facing the sea.\r\nThere were several shops in the village, and in Douglas Street a house of\r\nconfinement, containing separate cells, for the detention and punishment\r\nof any offenders against the law. The most pretentious dwellings stood\r\nupon the northern portion of the tract known as the Marsh, and all\r\nof them were newly constructed. One near the western extremity was a\r\nsubstantial house with gardens and plantation, inhabited by the clergyman\r\nof the parish, the Rev. Robt. Lister. In close proximity was a marine\r\nvilla with a Chinese porch, belonging to William Hornby, esq., of\r\nKirkham; and a row of white cottages, called Lizmahago, after a race\r\nhorse of John Clifton, esq., who had erected them for the accommodation\r\nof visitors. A pretty white villa was placed more to the rear, and\r\nseveral well-constructed lodging-houses studded the ground between those\r\njust mentioned and the old village, where clay and straw had been the\r\ntime-honoured building materials. The beach afforded no more than three\r\nbathing machines, but sundry improvements, both in multiplying the vans\r\nand in the establishment of a warm sea-water bath, were in contemplation.\r\nNo elegant promenade with its expansive sward, as at present, defined the\r\nlandward margin of the beach, but the whole space, at one end of which\r\nMr. Cookson had erected a windmill, was covered with miniature sand-hills\r\nand star-grass, unfolding a most uninviting and deterring aspect to the\r\npedestrian. The church of St. Cuthbert’s was built of rubble, rough cast\r\nand whitened, and certainly possessed, both externally and internally, no\r\nvery extensive claims to architectural beauty. The instrumental part of\r\nthe service was accomplished by means of a clarionet and a bass fiddle.\r\nThe religious edifice stood in the midst of fields, and was approached\r\nby a footpath, sufficiently wide to admit the passage of bathing vans,\r\nwhich were occasionally had recourse to by visitors on wet Sundays, in\r\norder to attend the service with dry garments, being then, and for some\r\ntime afterwards, the only covered vehicles in the place. Lytham Hall,\r\nembosomed in lofty trees and plantations, formed an imposing object,\r\nbeing situated half a mile inland, between the village and the church.\r\nThis noble mansion, comprising three fronts, of which the east is the\r\nprincipal, was commenced in 1757 and completed in 1764, by Thomas\r\nClifton, esq., and superseded the original Hall, erected about 1606, by\r\nSir Cuthbert Clifton. At the date now under examination, its possessor,\r\nJohn Clifton, esq., had laid out a race-course for training purposes,\r\nof three miles and a quarter in circumference, in the fields to the\r\nnorth-west of the church; and close at hand were excellent paddocks\r\nand stables, filled with a considerable stud of fine blood horses.\r\nThe residence of the trainer was an elegant villa near the stables,\r\nsurrounded with a shrubbery. Two steamers plied daily in the season\r\nbetween Preston and Lytham, but the larger share of the company arrived\r\nby the road, the journey having a few years previously been rendered more\r\ndirect by the opening of a route across the marshes, past Freckleton,\r\ninstead of the former circuitous one through Kirkham. In 1801 the\r\npopulation amounted to 920 persons.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing twenty years Lytham made steady, if not rapid,\r\nprogress. Buildings of modern and pretty designs sprang up along the\r\nbeach, whilst others of substantial workmanship were visible in the lines\r\nof various thoroughfares, especially in Clifton Street. The two hotels\r\nalready specified, underwent enlargements, owing to the growing pressure\r\non their accommodation, and a fresh inn, the Commercial, was erected on\r\nthe land behind the present Market Hotel, the front and main entrance\r\nof the house having an easterly aspect, overshadowed by several lofty\r\ntrees. A little beyond the north gable end of the inn, in a westerly\r\ndirection, were the old gates of the park attached to Lytham Hall, near\r\nto which, on the road side, was stationed the pinfold, constructed of\r\ncobble stones, in a quadrangular form, with an embattled tower rising\r\nabout eight feet above the height of the walls. A small Baptist chapel,\r\nhaving a school-room connected with it, also existed, standing on part\r\nof the ground now occupied by the premises of Mr. Edmondson, draper,\r\nthe remaining portion being covered by the residence and shop of that\r\ngentleman’s father, who owned the chapel, and acted as its minister. The\r\nchapel would hold about thirty worshippers, and contained three or four\r\nrows of forms and a pulpit; whilst the school-room, of equal dimensions,\r\nwas let to a person for a private day seminary.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months, hundreds of day visitors, in addition to\r\nthe more permanent ones who constituted the company, found their way\r\nin carts, waggons, or lighter vehicles, to the coast at Lytham, from\r\nPreston, Blackburn, Burnley, and other inland towns, for the pleasure\r\nof enjoying once, at least, a year, an invigorating bath in the sea.\r\nThe fortnightly spring tides were the signals which foretold the advent\r\nof these huge pic-nic parties, for such it seems appropriate to style\r\nthem, who flocked down to the shore, generally bringing their own\r\nprovisions with them, and after disporting themselves amidst the waves,\r\nand procuring amusement in various ways during the day, returned quietly\r\nor hilariously home to their several destinations, in the evening or\r\nfollowing morning, in the manner they had arrived. Some from the more\r\nremote places prolonged their sojourn for three days. Races for the\r\nbetter class of farmers’ horses were held annually on Wit-Monday, over\r\nthe sward which runs from the windmill to the site of an old lime kiln\r\nabout one mile distant, in the direction of Saltcoats, the course being\r\nround that spot to the starting point. These races, which are described\r\nas having been very fair contests, were kept up for many years. The\r\nprizes competed for were saddles, bridles, whips, etc. The bowling greens\r\nof Lytham amounted to two, which were attached to the Clifton Arms and\r\nCommercial Hotels, and were well patronised.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the attractions of Lytham, published in\r\n1821, furnishes a pretty correct idea of the recreations afforded by the\r\nwatering-place about that date:—“Lytham is a very salubrious place; its\r\nwalks are pleasant and diversified. You may walk for miles on the sand\r\nwestward. You may trip to the Hey-houses and get bad ale. Common-side\r\noffers a journey, which, if you please, ends at Blackpool. The walks are\r\nmany and various for those who love exercise; the lazy will soon tire\r\nhere, but the active will never be at a loss. The sands are fine—the sea\r\nbreeze pleasant—the air is impregnated with health. Sailing may be had\r\nat tide time; boats are occasionally going to Preston and over the water\r\nto Southport. There are baths, shower, cold, and warm for invalides. Old\r\nHugh Holmes, the shaver, doctor, and shopkeeper, is an old man, thin and\r\nmeagre, conceited to a tittle, and remarkably fond of chit-chat. The\r\npeople here bathe not at all, whilst those from a distance think it a\r\nblessing. Holmes, the barber, said he had never bathed in his life, nor\r\ncould I persuade him to do so. He said that he was sound in body, and if\r\nso, why dip in the briny sea at all.”\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the population of Lytham amounted to 1,292 persons, consisting\r\nof 258 families; and in 1825 the parish contained 258 houses, the\r\noccupants of 75 of which were employed chiefly in agriculture, and of\r\n55 in trade, fishing, or handicraft, those of the remaining 128 being\r\nunclassified. Three years later the Wheat Sheaf Inn and a wide range\r\nof thatched buildings adjoining were demolished, and after leaving the\r\nspacious opening, called Dicconson Terrace, leading down to the beach,\r\nseveral improved dwellings and a billiard-room were placed on the\r\nremainder of the ground. The greater part of the marine frontage had\r\nbeen levelled, and efforts commenced to lay out a species of walk or\r\npromenade. The houses standing along the shore line were usually hired\r\nfurnished by families for varying periods, at prices from one and a half\r\nto three guineas per week, their value being estimated by the number of\r\nbed-rooms, each of which represented ten shillings and sixpence a week.\r\nOther villas in the watering-place were similarly let, but lodgings could\r\nbe procured amongst the humble cottages on a weekly payment of four\r\nshillings and sixpence by each individual. The prices at the hotels for\r\nboard and lodging, exclusive of wine and liquors, were—at the Clifton\r\nArms, seven shillings a day in private, and six shillings in public; the\r\nCommercial, five shillings and sixpence; and the Ship, a new inn erected\r\nsince 1820, three shillings and sixpence. Of trades and professions in\r\nthe village there were three milliners, six drapers, three boot and shoe\r\nmakers, five joiners and cabinet makers, one druggist, two blacksmiths,\r\none ship carpenter, one custom-house officer, one tide-waiter, one corn\r\nmiller, three butchers, five grocers, two coal dealers, one confectioner,\r\none surgeon, one attorney, and one clergyman. In addition it should be\r\nmentioned that a solitary ladies’ seminary had been established within\r\nthe previous twelve months. “I recollect,” says Mr. Whittle, in his\r\n_Marina_, “visiting Lytham during July, 1824, when Mr. Lardner’s troop of\r\ncomedians were performing in what was termed the ‘New Theatre, Lytham,’\r\nCibber’s admired comedy of a ‘Journey to London, or a Bold Push for a\r\nFortune,’ and the laughable farce of the ‘Irish Tutor, or New Lights.’\r\nThe chief of the stage business was done by the Lardners, consisting\r\nof father, mother, son, and daughter. Likenesses were also taken in\r\nminiature by Mr. Lardner, senior, at from two to five guineas each! and\r\nthe polite art of dancing taught by Lardner, junior. We saw in succession\r\nperformed Morton’s comedy of ‘Speed the Plough, or the Farmer’s Glory;’\r\n‘Lovers’ Vows, or the Child of Love’; and Coleman’s admired and excellent\r\ncomedy of the ‘Poor Gentleman’; all of which were tolerably got up, but\r\nthe scenery was not of that kind which befitted a place of dramatic\r\nexhibition.” During the season three coaches ran regularly from Preston\r\nto Lytham and returned, their times of departure being—from Preston, at\r\n12 noon, 5 in the evening, and 7 in the evening; and from Lytham, at\r\n6 in the morning, 9 in the morning, and half-past 4 in the afternoon.\r\nIn addition to these coaches, occasional public conveyances and many\r\nprivate vehicles brought their loads of pleasure-seekers to the village,\r\nespecially during Easter and Whit-tides. Letters arrived at half-past\r\n9 in the morning and were despatched at 4 in the afternoon. In 1828\r\nthe buildings situated in the vicinity of the beach were, commencing\r\nat the eastern extremity of the line and travelling westward, a house,\r\noccupied by Miss Dennett, Rimmer’s and Butcher’s cottages, the Baths\r\nwith a house adjoining, two newly erected dwellings, Cookson’s cottages,\r\nRawstorne’s Marine Cottage, Craven’s and Hampson’s cottages, Clifton\r\nPlace, Buck’s cottages, Silcock’s and Miller’s cottages, Townend’s and\r\nCaptain Cookson’s residences, Mr. Barton’s house, Captain Fell’s and Mrs.\r\nBirdworth’s residences, Mr. Fisher’s house, Lizmahago houses, Hornby’s\r\nChinese villa, the Parsonage, in the occupation of the Rev. Robert\r\nLister; the Parish Church, situated more inland, and Church-house, a\r\nrural place. Mr. Corry, in his History of Lancashire, published about\r\nthat time, states:—“That the increase of Lytham has not been so rapid\r\nas in many villages, where the people are engaged in manufacture; but a\r\nconsiderable part of the visitors and settlers within the last twenty\r\nyears have been opulent individuals, who were induced by the beauty of\r\nthe spot and the benefit derived from bathing in the sea water, to resort\r\nto this pleasing village.” The houses were unnumbered and recognised\r\nby the titles bestowed upon them, or the names of their owners. Lamps\r\nfor the autumn and winter evenings were unknown in the streets, whilst\r\nlibraries, news-rooms, and livery stables were things of the future.\r\nThe Clifton Arms Hotel had recently been overlaid with a thick coating\r\nof cement resembling stone, and the Commercial Inn had undergone sundry\r\nenlargements. An ornamental enclosure or garden had been formed on the\r\nland of the present Market-house, surrounded by a palisading and planted\r\nwith flowers and shrubs. A carriage road also had been lately made from\r\nthe village to the church of St. Cuthbert.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the census of Lytham showed a total of 1,523 residents, being an\r\nincrease of 231 over the population ten years before; and three years\r\nsubsequently the ancient church of the parish was levelled to the ground\r\nand the erection of the present edifice commenced. The early growth of\r\nthe summer resort was much retarded by the exceedingly short terms upon\r\nwhich building leases were granted. Previous to 1820 all land reverted to\r\nthe lord of the manor forty years after its provisional purchase had been\r\neffected, so that there was little inducement for either the speculative\r\nor private individual to upraise habitations where the tenure was so\r\nunsatisfactory. About that date the duration of leases was extended to\r\nsixty years, and even this slight advance in a more liberal direction was\r\nnot without influence in promoting the development of the place, but no\r\ngreat rapidity characterised the multiplication of houses until a later\r\nepoch, when periods of 99 and 999 years were offered to purchasers. In\r\n1839 the Roman Catholics erected a chapel, dedicated to St. Peter, at\r\nthe east corner of Clifton Street. Previously the members of this sect\r\nhad worshipped in a small chapel belonging to Lytham Hall, which had\r\nsuperseded the domestic oratory of the Cliftons, in the days when they\r\nprofessed the Romish creed. The edifice in Clifton Street is of brick and\r\nhas a priests’ residence and schools attached, the whole being prettily\r\nencircled by willow trees and a low wall.\r\n\r\nThe returning seasons brought increasing streams of visitors to the\r\nshores of Lytham, and practically proved that the delightful and\r\ninvigorating influences of the climate and sea were well and widely\r\nappreciated by the populace of the large inland towns. The marine\r\nesplanade and the firm sands left by the receding tide were ever\r\nalive with crowds of people, who either for health or pleasure, or a\r\ncombination of the two, had arrived in the watering-place. The bathing\r\nvans were still unequal to the demands on their accommodation, and many\r\nwere compelled to dispense with their decorous shelter, and unrobe\r\nthemselves on the more secluded parts of the beach. To have returned\r\nhome again without immersing their body in the buoyant sea would to\r\nmost of them have been to omit the chief object of their journey,\r\nmany, indeed, having such an exalted idea of the remedial and hygienic\r\nproperties of the water that they imbibed huge draughts, and even filled\r\nbottles with it, for future use, or for friends who had been unable to\r\ncome themselves. There were few amusements for the visitors beyond those\r\nenumerated earlier, but had there been none other, the exhilarating\r\nbreeze and bath, coupled with the novel surroundings, would have\r\npossessed sufficient charm to insure a thronged season year after year.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the population numbered 2,047 persons, being a rise of no less\r\nthan 524 in the inhabitants during the preceding ten years, more than\r\ndouble the excess observed in the census of 1831 over its antecessor.\r\nDuring the previous twelve months the Clifton Arms Hotel, in Clifton\r\nStreet, had been abolished and a stately building, bearing the same name,\r\nerected on the front, where it now stands, very considerable enlarged\r\nand beautified under the proprietorship of the late Mr. John Knowles,\r\nwho purchased it on lease from the lord of the manor, and by whose\r\nrepresentatives the Hotel and appurtenances were sold to a company of\r\ngentlemen in 1875.\r\n\r\nThe 16th of February, 1846, initiated a new era in the history and\r\nprogress of Lytham, for on that day the branch line connecting this\r\npopular resort with the Preston and Wyre Railway was formally opened.\r\nAt an early hour the town evinced manifest signs that the inhabitants\r\nwere bent on doing full honour to the introduction of their invaluable\r\nally; flags and banners floated from the church and the residences of\r\nmany of the inhabitants, and later in the day the streets were thronged\r\nwith processions and spectators of all grades. The directors and a large\r\nparty of the neighbouring gentry assembled by invitation at Lytham Hall,\r\nand after partaking of luncheon proceeded to the newly erected station,\r\nwhere the “opening train,” consisting of an engine, gaily decorated,\r\nand fourteen carriages, awaited their arrival. Amongst the gentlemen\r\nwho accompanied Thomas Clifton, esq., and Mrs. Clifton, on the formal\r\ntrip to Kirkham and back, were John Laidlay, W. Taylor, J. Dewhurst,\r\nT. W. Nelson, Frederick Kemp, C. Swainson, James Fair, E. Houghton, W.\r\nH. Hornby, T. R. W. ffrance, P. Rycroft, W. Royds, and William Birley,\r\nesquires, the Revs. R. Moore and W. Birley, and Colonel Rawstorne.\r\nThe train departed amid a volley of cheers and discharge of cannon,\r\nand proceeded to Kirkham; the return journey was performed in fifteen\r\nminutes. The carriage station was 140 feet long by 53 feet wide, and\r\ncovered by a somewhat unique roof of twelve wooden arches, put together\r\nin segments and secured by nuts and screws, all the timber ends butting\r\nupon each other like the stones of an arch, but as solid, from their\r\npeculiar construction, as if the whole had been cut out of a single block\r\nof timber. The Lytham line diverged from the main railway at a point\r\nabout a mile to the north-west of Kirkham, and was nearly five miles in\r\nlength. It passed within a short distance of the village of Wrea, where a\r\nstation was built, and terminated in the immediate vicinity of the Roman\r\nCatholic chapel in this town.\r\n\r\nThe impetus given to the building trade of Lytham by the opening of the\r\nrailway and the almost simultaneous extension of ground leases was soon\r\nvisible in the erection of numerous houses. A Wesleyan chapel, capable\r\nof holding 200 hearers, was built, before the close of the year, in Bath\r\nStreet; but this structure having, as time progressed, become inadequate\r\nto the wants of the congregation, the foundation stone of a new one was\r\nlaid on the 12th of September, 1867, by T. C. Hincksman, esq., of Lytham,\r\nat the corner of Park and Westby Streets, service being first conducted\r\nthere on the 23rd of September in the ensuing year, by the Rev. John\r\nBedford, of Manchester. The chapel is faced with Longridge stone and\r\nwhite brick. In front are stone columns and pilasters nearly thirty feet\r\nhigh, surmounted by Corinthian caps, massive cornice, parapet, pediment,\r\netc. It contains seats for about 500 persons. The old Wesleyan chapel is\r\nnow used as a literary and social Institute, established in 1872. In 1847\r\nthe growth and prosperity of Lytham rendered it necessary that some form\r\nof local government should be adopted, and the inhabitants applied for\r\nand obtained an Improvement Act, by which the regulation of all public\r\nmatters was placed in the hands of a board of commissioners elected from\r\namongst the ratepayers. On the 13th of May in that year, the corner stone\r\nof a substantial lighthouse was laid on the “Double Stanner” bank, by\r\nPeter Haydock, esq., chairman of the Ribble Navigation Company, at whose\r\nexpense the work was accomplished; but on the 20th of January, 1863, a\r\nheavy storm swept over the coast, and amongst other damages effected\r\nby its fury was the overthrow of this pile, which was subsequently\r\nre-erected on the Star Hills, far removed from the destructive influence\r\nof the waves, and perhaps more efficacious, from its greater elevation,\r\nas a beacon. During the year 1848 a Market Hall was built on an open\r\nspace, formerly the ornamental garden referred to in a late page. In\r\nthe month of June the edifice was completed and ready for use, being\r\nconstructed of brick and supplied with stalls for various articles, such\r\nas fish, vegetables, toys, etc. The tower was elevated in 1872 to receive\r\na large clock, the gift of Lady Eleanor Cecily Clifton, and during the\r\nfollowing twelve months additional dials and illuminative power were\r\nadded. The Hall is prettily situated in an enclosure of elm trees.\r\n\r\nAnother church, dedicated to St. John, was erected on the east beach in\r\n1848-9, and consecrated on the 11th September, 1850. The site was granted\r\nby John Talbot Clifton, esq., who retains the patronage of the living,\r\nand the expense of construction defrayed by subscription. The edifice is\r\nof stone, and includes a nave, side aisles, transepts, chancel, porch,\r\nand tower, surmounted by a lofty spire. The side aisles are separated\r\nfrom the nave by pointed arches on circular columns. The chancel has\r\nsince been enlarged. Within the church are several memorial windows, one\r\nof which, in the west end, is in memory of “James and Elizabeth Fair, who\r\ndied August 16, 1871, and July 27, 1867,” inserted by their children.\r\nBy the side of this is a smaller stained window to Mr. Bannerman by his\r\nwidow. The east window of the chancel is magnificently illuminated, and\r\nanother, lighting the scholars’ chapel on the south of that part, was\r\nplaced by the Rev. W. H. Self “to his wife, Mary, ob. 1859.” The windows\r\nin the north and south transepts are, respectively, to “Thomas Miller,\r\nob. 1865,” and “Thomas Clifton, ob. 1851.” There are no mural tablets.\r\nThe organ was presented by William Bradshaw Swainson, esq., of Cooper\r\nHill, near Preston, “as a tribute of affection, in memory of his mother,\r\nCatherine Swainson, who died at Lytham on the 1st of February, 1848.” The\r\ninstrument was enlarged by the aid of public contributions in 1874. The\r\nlectern was presented by Margaret Ellen Clifford, the second wife of the\r\nRev. W. H. Self, _in memoriam_ of her mother, Mrs. Hannah Biddell, in\r\n1867. The tower contains a peal of six bells. An ecclesiastical parish\r\nwas apportioned to the church of St. John in 1870. The Rev. William Henry\r\nSelf, M.A., was the earliest incumbent and subsequently became the first\r\nvicar. The Rev. Gregory Smart, M.A., is the present vicar. The graveyard\r\nis a spacious area defined by a neat stone wall, and contains numerous\r\nelegant monuments. The vicarage house stands a very little distance to\r\nthe east side of the church, and is a handsome villa residence. To the\r\nrear of the burial ground, and separated therefrom by a narrow street,\r\nare the parish schools erected in 1851 by subscription, and grants from\r\nthe Council of Education and the National Society.\r\n\r\nThe want of proper illumination along the thoroughfares of Lytham during\r\nthe long evenings of the autumn months, was a source of considerable\r\ninconvenience to the visitors, and induced many to vacate the place\r\nearlier than otherwise they would have done, so that the commissioners\r\ndetermined to erect gas works by loans on the security of the rates,\r\nand remedy the evil as soon as possible. On the 28th of October, 1850,\r\nthe streets were lighted for the first time with gas. In 1851 the\r\nresidents of Lytham amounted to 2,695, showing an increase of 648 persons\r\nsince 1841. It was about this time that a lifeboat was stationed at\r\nLytham, purchased by subscription, and named the “Eleanor Cecily,” out\r\nof compliment to the lady of the manor. The boat-house stands on the\r\npromenade to the east, in close proximity to the old windmill, and is now\r\noccupied by a new and larger craft, presented by Thomas Clayton, esq., of\r\nWakefield, in 1863.\r\n\r\nThroughout the succeeding ten years the area of the town continued to\r\nexpand with fair rapidity. Many graceful villas were added to those\r\nalready existing on the front, whilst fresh shops and lodging houses\r\narose along the different thoroughfares, plainly evincing a determination\r\non the part of the inhabitants to keep pace with the spreading popularity\r\nof the place by creating ample accommodation for the crowds of visitors.\r\nA corps of Volunteer Riflemen was enrolled under Captain Lennox in 1860,\r\nduring the month of January. The census of 1861 furnished a total of\r\n3,189 residents.\r\n\r\nThe advisability of connecting the two watering-places of Blackpool and\r\nLytham by a coast railway was now freely discussed, and the scheme\r\nhaving been favourably entertained by a number of affluent gentlemen,\r\nthe requisite powers were sought from Parliament for its formation. In\r\nMay, 1861, the desired act received the royal assent, and on the ensuing\r\n4th of September the first sod of the new line was cut by T. H. Clifton,\r\nesq., M.P., the son and heir of the lord of the manor, in Lytham Park.\r\nThe directors of the company were E. C. Milne, esq., (chairman), of\r\nWarton Lodge; John Talbot Clifton, T. Langton Birley, Charles Birley,\r\nJames Fair, Robert Rawcliffe, and Thomas Fair, esqrs. The distance,\r\nabout 7½ miles, was spanned by a single line, stations being placed at\r\nthe two termini and at South Shore, in addition to which there was a\r\ngate-house at Andsell’s road, near the town, where it was proposed to\r\nhave a booking office. The railway was virtually finished in the autumn\r\nof 1862, but the formal opening was postponed until the 4th of April,\r\n1863. At that date, which occurred on Saturday, flags and banners floated\r\nfrom many of the windows, whilst the bells of St. Cuthbert’s church rang\r\nout merry peals at intervals throughout the day. No further ceremony,\r\nhowever, was observed on the occasion, than the running of a train to\r\nBlackpool and back with a select party of invited guests. Regular public\r\ntraffic commenced on Monday. During 1871 this line was amalgamated with\r\nthe Preston and Wyre, of which the Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the\r\nLondon and North Western Railway Companies are the lessees. The track was\r\ndoubled in 1874, by laying down another length of metals, and connected\r\nwith the Kirkham and Lytham branch. In the same year on the 1st of\r\nJuly, a spacious and handsome station which had been erected according\r\nto the design of C. Axon, esq., of Poulton, was brought into service,\r\nand the use of the original one belonging to the branch just specified\r\ndiscontinued for passenger traffic, the whole of which, both from Kirkham\r\nand Blackpool, is now directed to the recently built central edifice. It\r\nis expected that in course of time the coast line thus established from\r\nPreston through Kirkham, Lytham, St. Anne’s, South Shore, to Blackpool\r\nwill supersede the old route through Poulton to the last named resort\r\nfor the conveyance of passengers. Important alterations, it should be\r\nnoted, were effected in the course of the branch from Kirkham to Lytham\r\nimmediately preceding its junction with the Blackpool and Lytham line,\r\nby which the corner lying north of and between Kirkham and Wrea was cut\r\noff. The rails were also doubled.\r\n\r\nReverting to the town itself, we find that the day which gave the small\r\ncoast communication between Blackpool and Lytham to the public use, also\r\nwitnessed another event—the opening of the Baths and Assembly Rooms,\r\nsituated on the beach, about midway between the Clifton Arms and the\r\nNeptune Hotels. The building is of brick, with stone dressings, and\r\npresents an elegant and rather imposing appearance. It comprises private\r\nand swimming baths for both sexes; dressing-rooms, retiring-rooms, news\r\nand general reading-room, and a capacious saloon, able to contain 350\r\npersons, used for concerts, balls, and other entertainments. Early in\r\nthe same year a Congregational Church was completed in Bannister Street,\r\nthe corner stone of which had been laid on the 17th of October, 1861,\r\nby Sir James Watts, of Manchester. The edifice is formed of Longridge\r\nstone, in the ornamental Gothic style of architecture, with a spire, and\r\nwill hold about 500 worshippers. Within the enclosure wall surrounding\r\nthe church are the Sunday schools connected with it. The first pile\r\nof the marine pier, extending into the estuary of the Ribble from the\r\npromenade, was screwed into the ground on the 8th of June, 1864. The\r\nstructure was designed by E. Birch, esq., C.E., and is supported on\r\nhollow cylindrical columns, arranged in clusters. The length of the deck\r\nis 914 feet, the whole of which is encircled by a continuous line of\r\nside seats, whilst a lounging or waiting-room is stationed on the head.\r\nThe entrance is protected by gates and toll-houses. Easter Monday, the\r\n17th of April, 1865, was the day set apart for the ceremonious opening\r\nof the new erection. The town was gaily decorated with the bunting,\r\nand no efforts were spared to do full justice to the importance of so\r\nauspicious an event. Immense confluences of people arrived in excursion\r\ntrains, running at greatly reduced fares, from the business centres of\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire, and the streets and esplanade were literally\r\ninundated with spectators from all grades of society. To Lady Eleanor\r\nCecily Clifton was delegated the honourable duty of declaring the\r\npier accessible to promenaders, and at the selected time, that lady,\r\naccompanied by her son, T. H. Clifton, esq., proceeded to the spot, where\r\nthe necessary form was gone through; a large procession, headed by a\r\nmarshall, and consisting of the mayor and corporation of Preston, the\r\ndirectors of the Ribble Navigation Company, naval and military officers,\r\nclergy, the several directors of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway,\r\nthe Lytham and Blackpool Railway, the Blackpool and the Southport Pier\r\nCompanies, and numerous gentry. Unabated prosperity continued to shine\r\non the watering-place, whose limits were annually extended by additional\r\nbuildings, and in all parts there was to be observed that aspect of\r\nrecent improvements and embellishments which is ever indicative of a\r\npropitious fortune.\r\n\r\nThe population in 1871 had reached the high figure of 7,902, having more\r\nthan doubled during the previous ten years, and if further evidence\r\nwere required of the development of Lytham, none more irrefutable and\r\nconvincing could be given than this wonderful multiplication of the\r\ninhabitants. On the 3rd of August, 1871, a neat Gothic cottage hospital,\r\nerected at the east end of the resort, in Preston Road, at the sole\r\nexpense of the lord of the manor, was pronounced open for the reception\r\nof patients, and transferred to a committee of management. The building\r\nstands in three acres of land tastefully laid out, and comprises a\r\ncentral portion of two stories, with a wing on either side, containing\r\ntwo large wards (each with four beds), two sitting-rooms, surgery,\r\nbath-rooms, and laundry, on the ground floor; upstairs are four beds\r\nfor invalids and a sleeping apartment for the matron. The hospital is\r\nintended for the poor labouring under disease or accidents. Luke Fisher,\r\nesq., M.D., is the physician in charge. From 1871 up to the present\r\ndate (1876), there is nothing calling for separate comment beyond those\r\nmatters in connection with the railway and station already noticed,\r\nwith the exception of the beautiful park-garden, occupying the land\r\nformerly known as Hungry Moor, and instituted through the liberality of\r\nJ. T. Clifton, esq., who bestowed the name of the Lowther Gardens on\r\nthe enclosure so gracefully designed and planted, and gave free access\r\nto the public on its completion, about three years ago. The progress of\r\nthe town within the short interval at present under consideration, has\r\nbeen marked by even greater rapidity than that which shed such a halo of\r\nprosperity around the period more immediately preceding; and there is no\r\napparent prospect that the powerful impetus which has thus far exerted\r\nits beneficial influence on the place is likely to experience any\r\ndiminution. Indeed it may with reason be anticipated that when passenger\r\ntraffic is more thoroughly established along the coast line from Preston\r\nto Blackpool, the demand for residential accommodation will be still\r\ngreater than that which supplies abundant occupation to the builders\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe original endowment of Lytham Free School was derived from the\r\nfollowing sources:—In 1702, the Rev. James Threlfall, of St. Cuthbert’s\r\nchurch, gave £5; and somewhere about the same time, William Elston,\r\nwho died in 1704, presented £3 3s. 0d., for the use of the parish.\r\nSubsequently these sums of money were supplemented by a grant of £10 from\r\nJohn Shepherd, of Mythorp, and the whole invested, the interest being\r\napplied to local charitable purposes. The benefaction of John Shepherd\r\nwas bestowed in trust upon Thomas Shepherd and his heirs, to the intent\r\nthat the interest should be applied to the “use of such poor children’s\r\nschooling, as they, with two or three of the most substantial men of\r\nthe parish, whom they chose to consult, should think fit;”[212] but it\r\nis doubtful how it was disposed of until 1720, when the three separate\r\nsums mentioned were incorporated, for a motive stated directly, with a\r\ncollection made in aid of those who had suffered damage from a serious\r\ninundation in that year. The inhabitants were unable to agree upon an\r\nequable distribution of the collection specified, and decided, by way\r\nof settling the affair, to “make a free school,”[213] with it and the\r\nother sums. The total capital thus acquired amounted to more than £100.\r\nIn 1728 £60 was derived from the residue of John Harrison’s estate, by\r\nthe direction of his will. William Gaulter gave to Lytham school in 1745\r\nseveral securities for money, amounting in all to £99, and three years\r\nlater bequeathed the residue of his personal estate, except 20s., to\r\nthe same object, making a total benefaction of £335. The whole of the\r\nendowment fund has been invested in land, and the school has always been\r\nin the hands of trustees, who have control over the teachers and all\r\nmatters affecting its interest and government.\r\n\r\nCookson’s Charity is the interest of £10 bequeathed by Thomas Cookson at\r\nan unknown date before 1776, to purchase books for the poor children of\r\nthe parish.\r\n\r\nLeyland’s Charity represents the sum of £60 left by Elizabeth Leyland to\r\ntrustees, in 1734, in order that it might be laid out, and the annual\r\nrevenue therefrom devoted to the assistance of the poor, either in\r\nrelieving the elderly, or providing instruction for the young.\r\n\r\nST. ANNES-ON-THE-SEA. The locality in which the new watering-place is\r\nrapidly developing was indicated in the foundation charter of the Lytham\r\nBenedictine Cell as Kilgrimol. It has been suggested that the peculiar\r\northography of the word Kilgrimol points to there having been at some\r\nera a religious settlement, presided over by Culdees, the priests of\r\nColumba,[214] but it is more probable that the name is derived from the\r\ntwo British words _kilgury_, a corner, and _mul_ or _meol_, a sand-hill.\r\nAt a later epoch the district was known as Cross or Churchyard Slack,\r\nand tradition records that an oratory existed there until such time as\r\nit was swallowed up by an earthquake, long years ago. Mr. Thornber, in\r\ndiscussing the statement, advances the following fact as some evidence in\r\nfavour of its veracity:—“Churchyard Slack is situated in a hollow, having\r\non the north side a rising ground called Stony-hill, and at the distance\r\nof three-quarters of a mile a similar elevation, though not so marked. On\r\nthese ridges are found innumerable small boulders of grey granite, having\r\napparently been acted upon by fire; but it is particularly remarkable\r\nthat not one can be found amongst them entirely whole. Similar stones in\r\nless quantities are discovered in the intervening space, all more or less\r\nbroken.”\r\n\r\nOn the immediate outskirts of the embryo town is the small hamlet of\r\nHeyhouses, at which a school was established in 1821, and enlarged in\r\n1853; and it was there that Lady Eleanor Cecily Clifton erected a church,\r\nin memory of the late James Fair, esq., of Lytham, on a site presented\r\nby her husband, the lord of the manor. The foundation stone of the\r\nedifice was laid in June, 1872, and on Wednesday, the 6th of August, in\r\nthe ensuing year, the church and burial ground, occupying jointly 2½\r\nacres, were consecrated by the Lord Bishop of Manchester. The interior\r\ncontains accommodation for 300 persons, 145 seats being appropriated,\r\nand 155 free. The roof is of red tiles instead of slates. The building\r\nis at present a chapel of ease to St. Cuthbert’s, Lytham, but will, when\r\noccasion requires, have a separate ecclesiastical parish of its own.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the land of St. Annes-on-the-Sea was leased to a company of\r\ngentlemen for a term of 1,100 years by John Talbot Clifton, esq., and on\r\nthe 31st of March, 1875, the formality of laying the first stone of the\r\nfuture watering-place was gone through by Master John T. Clifton, the\r\neldest son of T. H. Clifton, esq., M.P. The ceremony was accomplished\r\namidst a large concourse of people, and was in fact the commencement of\r\nthe handsome and commodious hotel near to the railway station, which has\r\nsince been completed. The estate has been judiciously and tastefully\r\narranged by Messrs. Maxwell and Tuke, architects, of Bury, and is\r\nintersected by broad streets with gentle curves. The houses are intended\r\nto be built either singly or in pairs with few exceptions, but in no\r\ncase will any group comprise more than six; gardens in each instance\r\nare to front the dwellings. A promenade, 3,000 feet in length and 180\r\nfeet in width, has been formed with asphalt along the marine aspect, and\r\nalready between twenty and thirty villas have been raised on the sides\r\nof the recently made thoroughfares. A public garden with conservatories\r\nis also in course of formation, as well as efficient gas-works and other\r\nrequisites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPARISH OF ST. MICHAEL’S-ON-WYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER RAWCLIFFE-WITH-TARNACRE. In the Domesday Book no less than three\r\nRawcliffes are mentioned, and have been identified, respectively, with\r\nUpper, Middle, and Out Rawcliffes, the last being stated to contain\r\nthree carucates, and the others two carucates each. In the _Testa de\r\nNevill_ it is entered that the grandfather of Theobald Walter gave four\r\ncarucates of land in (Upper) Rawcliffe, Thistleton, and Greenhalgh,\r\nto his daughter Alice, on her marriage with Orm Magnus. William de\r\nLancaster held Upper Rawcliffe at the time of his death in 1240; and\r\nin 1248 Theobald Walter, or le Botiler, had lands in Upper Rawcliffe\r\nand Mid Rawcliffe, as well as the manor of Out Rawcliffe, the principal\r\nportion of which had doubtless descended to him from his ancestor\r\nalluded to above.[215] An inquiry was instituted in 1322, during the\r\nreign of Edward II., concerning the possessions in land and mills of\r\nJohn de Rigmayden in Upper Rawcliffe, Wyresdale, and Garstang; and a\r\nsimilar inquisition, with the exception of Garstang, was made, three\r\nyears later, in the case of widow Christiana de Coucy de Guynes.[216]\r\nIn the succeeding few years Joan, the daughter and heiress of John de\r\nRigmayden, and John de Coupland held Upper Rawcliffe between them. John\r\nde Coupland had married the widow of Sir William de Goucy, and was the\r\ngallant soldier who captured David II., king of Scotland, on the battle\r\nfield at Durham, and was rewarded for his bravery by Edward III., with\r\nthe rank of knight-banneret and a grant of land. Joan de Rigmayden, the\r\nheiress, probably married William Southworth, as he is described as lord\r\nof Upper Rawcliffe a little later; Ellen, the sole child and heiress of\r\nWilliam Southworth, became the wife of Robert Urswick, of Urswick, and\r\ntheir second son, Thomas, who succeeded to the estates of Rawcliffe,\r\netc., and was knighted, left at his decease a daughter, who espoused,\r\nabout 1430, John, the third son of Sir Richard Kirkby, of Kirkby. John\r\nKirkby resided at Upper Rawcliffe Hall,[217] or White Hall, as it was\r\nsubsequently designated, and was succeeded by his eldest son, William,\r\nwho in his turn left the lands and mansion to his heir and offspring\r\nJohn Kirkby. The eldest son of the last gentleman, by his wife, the\r\ndaughter of—Broughton, was William Kirkby; and he, in course of time,\r\ninherited the property, and married, in 1507, Elizabeth, the daughter of\r\nWilliam Thornborough, of Hampsfield, by whom he had issue John, George,\r\nWilliam, Richard, Henry, Anne, Elizabeth, and Jane. John Kirkby, the\r\nheir, was living in 1567, but died without offspring, as also did his\r\nbrother George, so that Upper Rawcliffe Hall and estate passed to the\r\nthird son, William Kirkby, who married Isabell, the daughter of John\r\nButler, of Kirkland.[218] The Kirkbys continued in sole possession of\r\nthe township until 1631, when Thomas Westby, of Mowbreck, purchased from\r\nthem Upper Rawcliffe Hall and the estate attached, both of which he\r\nsettled upon Major George Westby, the eldest son of his second marriage\r\nwith Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Preston, of Holkar, and widow of\r\nThomas Lathom, of Parbold. George Westby resided at White Hall, as the\r\nmanor house was now called, and was twice married, being succeeded by\r\nJohn, the only child by his first wife, Margaret, the daughter of Thomas\r\nHesketh, of Mains. Both George Westby and his third brother, Bernard,\r\nwere royalist officers. John Westby, of Upper Rawcliffe, espoused, in\r\n1684, Jane, the daughter of Thomas Bleasdale, of Alston, and had issue\r\nJohn, Joseph, James, and Alice, who became the wife of Thomas Gilibrand,\r\nof Dunken Hall, near Chorley. John Westby the eldest son, inherited the\r\nmansion and land on the death of his father in 1708, and married, in the\r\nfollowing year, Mary, the daughter of Thomas Hawett, of Ormskirk, by whom\r\nhe had Thomas; George, who died in 1776, leaving several children by his\r\nwife Mary, the daughter of ⸺ Field; John, died unmarried; Cuthbert, died\r\nchildless; and Jane. Thomas Westby came into the estate in 1745, when\r\nhis father was accidentally killed, and espoused Margaret, the daughter\r\nand heiress of William Shuttleworth, of Turnover Hall, and Bridget,\r\nhis wife, who was one of four daughters, the sole offspring of John\r\nWestby, of Mowbreck. The children of Thomas Westby, of White Hall, and,\r\nultimately, of one fourth of Mowbreck, were John, who died unmarried in\r\n1811; William, died unmarried in 1811, just before his brother; Joseph,\r\ndied young; Robert, died childless in 1800; Thomas; Bridget, an abbess\r\nat Liege; and two Marys, one of whom died in infancy. Thomas, the fifth\r\nson, held Mowbreck, White, and Turnover Halls and estates, on the decease\r\nof his eldest brother, and at his own death in 1829, without issue,\r\nwas succeeded, in Turnover, by Thomas the only surviving son of his\r\nuncle, George Westby, whose death occurred in 1776; whilst he bequeathed\r\nMowbreck and White Hall to George, the eldest son of this Thomas Westby,\r\nby his wife Anne, the daughter of John Ashley, of London. The Westbys,\r\nof White Hall and Mowbreck, sold their property at the former place in\r\nrecent years to the late John Stevenson, esq., of Preston and Lytham.\r\nReverting to the earlier Westbys, we find that the active parts played by\r\nGeorge and Bernard Westby in the Civil Wars resulted in the confiscation\r\nof the White Hall estate by Parliament; and in 1653 it was sold by the\r\nCommissioners of State, being purchased for the Westbys again by, and in\r\nthe names of, some of their Protestant friends.\r\n\r\nUpper Rawcliffe Hall was rebuilt about the time of its purchase by the\r\nWestbys, who conferred upon it the new title of White Hall. This mansion\r\nstood by the side of the river Wyre, and was approached through a noble\r\ngateway. The windows were mullioned, and two bays projected from the\r\nnorth-west front; within were secret chambers and a private chapel.\r\nThe Hall is now a farm house. Turnover Hall, the ancient seat of the\r\nShuttleworths, and afterwards one of the mansions of the Westbys, as\r\nalready shown, presents nothing of special interest to our notice.\r\nSt. Michael’s Hall, the residence of the Longworths[219] during the\r\nseventeenth century, and probably of the Kirkbys before them, has since\r\nbeen rebuilt in an antique style, and converted into a farm house.\r\n\r\nTarnacre was claimed, amongst other places, by the abbot of Cockersand in\r\n1292, during the reign of Edward I., and was, with Upper Rawcliffe, in\r\nearly days, a feudal appendage of Garstang.\r\n\r\nThe township of Upper Rawcliffe-with-Tarnacre contains the ancient\r\nparish church of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, which occupies a prominent and\r\npicturesque station on the banks of the narrowed Bleasdale stream, in\r\nthe midst of the rural village, to which its title has been extended.\r\nSt. Michael’s church, or _Michelescherche_, as it appears in the Survey\r\nof William the Conqueror, was obviously standing on the arrival of that\r\nwarrior in 1066, being, with the exception of a similar structure at\r\nKirkham, the only edifice of its kind existing in the Fylde at that time.\r\nThere are no records amongst the meagre annals of Amounderness during the\r\nSaxon era, to assist us in establishing beyond question the antiquity\r\nof this church, but it may reasonably be supposed that its erection\r\ntook place at no long interval after the year 627, when Paulinus was\r\nappointed bishop of the province of Northumbria, in which St. Michael’s\r\nwas situated. The zeal and piety displayed by Paulinus are said to have\r\nexercised an important influence in overcoming the pagan tendencies of\r\nthe inhabitants of Lancashire, and although it is far from probable\r\nthat the whole of the people of the Fylde at once became converts to\r\nChristianity, and renounced their heathenish and superstitious ritual,\r\nstill it would be idle to deny that the ministrations of so earnest\r\na prelate as Paulinus were fruitful to a considerable degree in our\r\ndistrict, more especially when history proclaims the success of his\r\nefforts in other portions of his diocese. The small band of professed\r\nChristians would gradually extend their circle, and at no remote date a\r\nbuilding would become necessary where divine worship could be conducted\r\nin a decent and orderly manner, according to the direction of the\r\nnewly-adopted creed; and it was, we opine, at such an epoch that the\r\nchurch of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre was first called into being. After the\r\nNorman Conquest the church formed an item of the princely estate of Roger\r\nde Poictou, acquired through the partial munificence of William I.; and\r\npossibly in 1094, or thereabouts, was conferred by him upon the priory\r\nof St. Mary’s, at Lancaster, in like manner to similar ecclesiastical\r\npossessions which he held in Kirkham and Poulton. However that may be,\r\nit is learnt from the _Testa de Nevill_ that rather more than a century\r\nafter the foundation of the monastic house in the year just named, the\r\nadvowson of St. Michael’s was vested in King John, who presented Master\r\nMacy to the living,[220] then valued at £66 13s. 4d. per annum. In 1326,\r\nWilliam de Walderston, rector of the church of St. Michael’s, and the\r\nprior of Lancaster, were engaged in a controversy before the authorities\r\nof Richmond, respecting the forest and other tithes of Myerscough, and\r\nthose of a place called Migchalgh, the suit being decided at Lancaster on\r\nthe 13th of October against the rector.[221] Nineteen years later, Henry,\r\nearl of Lancaster, was patron of the living, and in 1411 Henry IV., duke\r\nof Lancaster, who had claimed and obtained the crown resigned by Richard\r\nII., conveyed St. Michael’s church to the Master and Brethren of the\r\nCollege or Chantry of the Blessed Mary Magdalen, at Battlefield, near\r\nShrewsbury, nominally established by himself.[222] The letters-patent by\r\nwhich the transfer was effected, bore the Duchy seal, and stipulated that\r\nRoger Yve, of Leeton, Keeper and Master of the College concerned (really\r\nits founder), and his successors, should, in return for the grant, make\r\nthe following provision for the maintenance of a vicar at the church of\r\nSt. Michael’s:—\r\n\r\n  “The Vicar and his Successors to receive, have, and possess,\r\n  the offerings and revenues which are and belong to the church\r\n  of Michaelskirk, together with the fruits and offerings arising\r\n  from Hay and Revenues; the Tenth of Gardens dug with the foot,\r\n  of Lambs, Calves, Young Foals, Poultry, Young Pigs, Geese, Eggs,\r\n  Milk, Wool, Flax, Hemp, Mills, Apples, Garlick, Onions, Fishes,\r\n  and Pigeons; the first fruits of the Dead, otherwise called\r\n  Mortuaries, whether they consist of Animals, Clothes, or any\r\n  other thing whatsoever, together with our Pool and Mill, and also\r\n  the Pool upon Wyre near the Rectory of Michaelskirk; and further,\r\n  the same Vicar and his Successors to have for their Dwelling the\r\n  straw-thatched Porch below the Rectory, and the Door and House\r\n  adjoining, with the Dovecote and Orchard near the Porch, and the\r\n  Fishponds and Moats.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar on his part was required to pledge himself to pay all ordinary\r\ntaxes and expenses incumbent upon the church, excepting “the covering\r\nof the chancel of the church, the payment of 40s. to the Archdeacon of\r\nRichmond, and the Tenths payable to the King for ever,” for which the\r\nMaster of the College agreed on behalf of himself and his successors to\r\nbe answerable.[223] The foregoing grant and regulations were confirmed\r\nin 1425 and 1485 by Henry VI. and Henry VII. respectively. After the\r\nDissolution the right of presentation was exercised by King Charles\r\nin 1629, who appointed Nicholas Bray to the vicarage. Subsequently\r\nthe patronage of the living has descended through several private\r\nindividuals, and is now centred in the present vicar, the Venerable\r\nArchdeacon Hornby.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Michael’s contained two chantries, one of which,\r\ndedicated to St. Katherine, occupied the chapel still existing in the\r\nnorth aisle. This chantry was founded some time about the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century by John Botiler, or Butler, lord of the manor of Out\r\nRawcliffe. Canon Raines says that a portion of the body armour either of\r\nhim or one of his immediate descendants remained suspended in the chapel\r\nuntil long after 1700.\r\n\r\nAlice Butler, the daughter of Sir Thomas Radcliffe, and widow of Nicholas\r\nButler, the eldest son of the founder, bequeathed by will, dated the\r\n20th of November, 1504, “her sowll to God and hys Blessyd Mother and\r\nall the holye Cumpanie of heven, and her bodye to be beryd in Christian\r\nwyse in Saynt Katrine’s chapel, where her husband laye;” also “to the\r\nlyght brenning there 20d; to Thomas Walton, or some wel dysposed priest\r\nto synge for my sowll for one yeare £1 13s. 4d., solemn mass of requiem,\r\nand other obsequies to be done as becometh one of my degree, but not too\r\nmoche expendsive so that my executors let not (hinder not) my dowters\r\nadvancement in marryage; and to Sʳ John Butler, Clerk, 40s. a yeare\r\ntogider with meate and drynke whiles he is on lyfe.”[224] In the reign\r\nof Henry VIII., William Harrison was the officiating priest of this\r\nchantry, and at that time its tenants, possessions, and annual rentals\r\nwere, one tenement lying in Esprick, held by Thomas Dawson at 20s. per\r\nannum; another tenement in the same place held by William Hall at 19s.; a\r\nwindmill in Stainall at 26s. 8d., and several parcels of ground amounting\r\nto about an acre at 2s., held by Ralph Hull; one tenement in Stainall\r\nwith appurtenances held by Ralph Hodgeson at 12s.; an acre of ground\r\nlying in a field at Stainall held by William Hull at 2s. 8d.; two roods\r\nof land in Stainall held by the wife of Christopher Hull at 12d.; divers\r\nplots of ground estimated to comprise four acres in the same township\r\nheld by William Hull, the elder, at 19s.; one tenement with appurtenances\r\nin Great Eccleston held by the wife of William Stiholme at 13s. 4d.; and\r\none tenement in Little Eccleston held by Henry Wilkinson, at 20s. Hence\r\nit seems that the gross rentals amounted to £5 15s. 8d., out of which\r\n5s. per annum was paid to the wife of Robert Stannall for her jointure,\r\nleaving £5 10s. 8d. the actual yearly revenue of the chantry from its\r\nendowment.[225] At the accession of Edward VI., Henry Harrison was the\r\n“Priest Incumbent at St. Katherine’s Altar, being 54 years old, and he\r\ntaught a Grammar School according to his foundation.” When chantries\r\nwere suppressed the educational institution here alluded to was probably\r\nabandoned for want of funds and a master; in any case it ceased to exist\r\nabout that time. On the 29th of November, 1606, James I. granted to Henry\r\nButler, of Rawcliffe Hall, “all that Late Chantrie of the ffoundation of\r\nJohn Butler, at the Aulter of the Blessed Katherine within the Parishe\r\nChurche of St. Michaell-upon-Wyre, in the Countye of Lancaster, lately\r\ndissolved, and all the lands appertaining thereto.”\r\n\r\nThe second chantry in St. Michael’s church was founded sometime during\r\nthe fifteenth century by one of the earlier Kirkbys, of Upper Rawcliffe,\r\nand in the reign of Edward VI. its annual income from endowment property\r\nwas £4 13s. 10d., Thomas Crosse, of the age of 40 years, being the priest\r\nwho celebrated there and “assisted the Curate.” Nothing more precise\r\nconcerning the origin of this chantry can be ascertained, and even the\r\nsituation it occupied in the church is unknown. In 1553 Thomas Crosse\r\nreceived a pension of £4 13s. 10d. a year.[226]\r\n\r\n  VICARS OF ST.

Hugh de Horneby was the brother of Robert de Horneby, vicar of\r\nKirkham, and it may fairly be inferred that they belonged to the family\r\nof Hornbys, whose descendants are now settled at St. Michael’s, Ribby,\r\nand Winwick, but lapse of time has obliterated the connecting links.\r\nThe Rev. Nathaniel Baxter was ejected in 1662, for refusing to take the\r\noath required by the Act of Uniformity. Little only can be ascertained\r\nconcerning the Crombleholmes, but it is conjectured that they were\r\nassociated with the branch of that name seated at Goosnargh. The Rev.\r\nRichard Crombleholme had two sons—Edward and William, by the latter of\r\nwhom he was succeeded in the vicarage, whilst to the former seems to\r\nhave descended the patronage, acquired by purchase. The Rev. William\r\nCrombleholme married the daughter of Alexander Butler, of Kirkland, and\r\npossibly had no offspring beyond the Elizabeth Crombleholme, to whose\r\nmemory the mural monument shortly to be noticed, was erected. The Rev.\r\nAnthony Swainson was the son of the Rev. Christopher Swainson, B.A.,\r\nincumbent of Copp, and Elizabeth, his wife; he was a Fellow of Worcester\r\nCollege, Oxford. The Rev. Charles Buck was the son of the Rev. Charles\r\nBuck, M.A., vicar of Kirkham; he was afterwards curate of Warton and\r\nLund. The Rev. Hugh Hornby was the sixth son of Hugh Hornby, esq., of\r\nKirkham, whose eldest son was Joseph Hornby, esq., D.L., of Ribby Hall.\r\nHe married Ann, daughter and co-heiress of Joseph Starky, M.D., of\r\nRedvales, and had issue, one son, William, now the Venerable Archdeacon\r\nHornby, who succeeded him in the living, and is the present vicar and\r\npatron. The Ven. Archdeacon Hornby is an honorary canon of Manchester,\r\nand has been twice married, but further information respecting the family\r\nwill be found in the pedigree of “Hornby of Ribby Hall.”\r\n\r\nThe present church is a broad low building of rough stone, with a tower\r\nof similar character at the west end. Both the tower and church are\r\nsurmounted and surrounded by a castellated stone parapet and ornamental\r\npinnacles of the same material. The porch and the tower bear the date\r\n1611 and initial letters H:B. upon their exteriors, but it is evident\r\nthat much of the edifice can boast a considerably greater antiquity than\r\nthat indicated by the corresponding inscriptions. It is also obvious\r\nfrom the varieties displayed in the architecture of different portions,\r\nmore especially the windows, that the rebuilding of the church has not\r\nbeen accomplished all at once, but carried on at pretty long intervals,\r\nextending back certainly to the time of Henry VIII., and perhaps further.\r\nWithin, the south side aisle is separated from the nave by a succession\r\nof stone arches running from east to west, whilst the north side aisle\r\ncontains the chapel in which was placed the altar of St. Katherine, and\r\nwhere now is the following inscription:—“This Oratory, known before\r\nthe Dissolution to have been a Chantry dedicated to Saint Katherine,\r\nand competently endowed with lands in the neighbouring townships, was\r\nrepaired by John ffrance, esq., of Rawcliffe Hall, A.D. 1797, being an\r\nappendage to that ancient manor house.” The tower opens directly into\r\nthe nave without even the semblance of a partition, and on one wall is\r\nfixed a brass plate intimating that the large clock, whose huge pendulum\r\nvibrates opposite, and whose dials are visible without, was presented,\r\nin 1850, to the Ven. Archdeacon Hornby by his parishioners, as a mark of\r\nesteem. The mural tables occupying stations within the aisles and nave\r\nare erected to the memories of Edward Greenhalgh, of Myerscough Hall,\r\ndied in 1823, aged 53, and Margaret, his widow, died in 1853, aged 92,\r\nalso Mary, died in infancy, and Charlotte, died in 1823, aged 29, their\r\ndaughters; Thomas Westby, of White Hall, died in 1762, aged 47, and\r\nMargaret, his widow, died in 1802, aged 82, also their children—Mary,\r\ndied in infancy, Joseph, in 1769, aged 16, Bridget, in 1786, aged 37,\r\nRobert, in 1800, aged 45, Mary, in 1805, aged 45, William, in 1811,\r\naged 60, and John, in 1811, aged 65—Thomas, the only surviving child\r\nbeing the erector of the monument in 1812; Hugh Hornby, M.A., 56 years\r\nvicar of the parish, died in 1847, aged 81, and Anne, his widow, died in\r\n1850, aged 81 years, also Joseph Starkey Hornby, born in 1839, died in\r\n1858, and William Hornby, born in 1845, died in 1858—“They were lovely\r\nand pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided”;\r\nHenry Hornby, late Captain in the East India Service, died in 1794, aged\r\n54, “also near this place were interred the remains of his late father,\r\nThomas Hornby, of St. Michael’s, who died Mar. 8, 1785, aged 76, likewise\r\nElizabeth, wife and mother to the above, who died May 14th, 1798, aged\r\n84”; Elizabeth Crombleholme, daughter of the Rev. William Crombleholme,\r\nformerly vicar of the parish, “whose mortal remains were deposited in the\r\ngraveyard of this church near those of her beloved parents on the 21st\r\nof May, 1817—Erected as a tribute of esteem by her affectionate relative\r\nThomas Butler Cole, of Kirkland Hall.” The Baptistry was restored in 1852\r\nby the surviving children of John and Susannah Swainson, of Preston,\r\nand contains several tablets affixed to the north wall in memory of\r\nnumerous members of that family, amongst whom may be mentioned the Revs.\r\nChristopher Swainson, B.A., incumbent of Copp, died in 1775; Anthony\r\nSwainson, M.A., vicar of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre, died 1784, aged 42; and\r\nChristopher Swainson, M.A., prebendary of Hereford, and vicar of Clun,\r\nSalop, died in 1854. The burial ground surrounding the church presents\r\nnothing of much interest to the antiquarian beyond an old sun-dial, and\r\nthe Crombleholme grave lying under the shadow of the east wall. The\r\nliving is a discharged vicarage.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the ancient vestry books will doubtless be\r\ninteresting to our readers, although not of much importance as parish\r\nrecords:—\r\n\r\n  “April, 1683: To Ann Raby for washing surplice, 4s.; to John\r\n  Fisher for work for clock and bells, 8s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  “Ordered this 21st of June, 1683, that no person or persons for\r\n  the future be admitted to bury any dead corpse in the church\r\n  unless he or they, at whose instance such corpse shall be buried,\r\n  do in hand pay to the sexton of the parish for the same, being 12\r\n  pence for the use of the parish, or sufficiently secure the same\r\n  to him, the corpses of women dying in childbed only excepted,\r\n  which are hereby intended to be free, as is usual in other\r\n  parishes.—Thos.

At\r\nthat date Joseph Fielding induced the Rev. Hugh Hornby, vicar of St.\r\nMichael’s-on-Wyre, and William Harrison, of Upper Rawcliffe, to undertake\r\nthe trust with him on a fresh deed, the old one having been lost. A new\r\nschoolhouse was shortly erected on the site of the former building, and\r\nis now governed by the representatives of the trustees named. In 1813\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Crombleholme left £200 in trust to be invested, and the\r\nannual income therefrom paid to the master of St. Michael’s-on-Wyre\r\nschool for teaching three poor children of the parish to read, write, and\r\ncast accounts.\r\n\r\nBread-money was probably established during the lifetime of John ffrance,\r\nof Rawcliffe Hall, and arises from “two-sevenths of the clear rent of a\r\nclose of ground lying in Kirkham, purchased with £20, to be distributed\r\nto the poor attending divine service in the parish church of St.\r\nMichael’s, at the direction of John ffrance, esq., and his heirs; Thomas\r\nLangton, gent., and his heirs; and the vicar of St. Michael’s for the\r\ntime being.”[227]\r\n\r\nRalph Longworth, esq., of St. Michael’s Hall, left £5 per annum to the\r\nvicar, and £2 10s. to the poor of Upper Rawcliffe.\r\n\r\nThomas Knowles, gent., left £2 10s., and John Hudson, gent., £2 a-year to\r\nthe poor of the same township.\r\n\r\nThe Terleway’s Lands were given by some one unknown at a very early\r\ndate “for the use of the parish, as the vicar and vestry shall\r\ndirect,” and consist of lands in Claughton and a garden in Upper\r\nRawcliffe-with-Tarnacre.[228]\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF UPPER RAWCLIFFE-WITH-TARNACRE.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    494    617    643    665    671    697    682    700\r\n\r\nThe area of the township embraces 3,743 statute acres.\r\n\r\nGREAT ECCLESTON. Great Eccleston was anciently held by William de\r\nLancaster as an appendage of the fee of Wyresdale. William de Lancaster\r\ndied without issue, and Wyresdale, with its dependency Great Eccleston,\r\npassed to Walter de Lindsay, the eldest son of his second sister, Alice.\r\nThe Lindsay line terminated in the heiress Christiana de Lindsay, living\r\nin 1300, who married Ingelram de Guynes, Lord of Coucy, in France,\r\nwhose eldest son was created earl of Bedford in 1336, and whose second\r\nand third sons, Sir William de Coucy and Robert de Coucy, held Great\r\nEccleston as part of Wyresdale, their inheritance, in 1346. The widow of\r\nSir William de Coucy conveyed her portion of Great Eccleston in marriage\r\nto Sir John de Coupland, and the remainder was then held by Baldwin de\r\nGuynes and Joan, the heiress of John de Rigmayden. The whole of the\r\ntownship, with the exception of certain lands rented by the convent of\r\nDeulacres,[229] descended in the manner above described from William\r\nde Lancaster, through the Lindsays and Guynes or Coucys, to Coupland,\r\nBaldwin de Guynes, and Joan Rigmayden, and subsequently to their\r\nheirs. Amongst the _Familiæ Lancastrienses_ there are two families of\r\nEcclestons, one of which is described as of Eccleston, near Preston, and\r\nthe other of Eccleston simply, the latter doubtless being the Ecclestons\r\nwho were seated at Great Eccleston Hall anterior to the Stanleys, the\r\noccupants in the seventeenth century, whose pedigree will be found, with\r\nothers, in a former chapter of this volume. The Ecclestons, of Eccleston,\r\nnear Preston, would belong to the place of that name in the Hundred of\r\nLeyland. Thomas Stanley, an illegitimate son of the fourth earl of Derby,\r\nsettled, about 1600, at Great Eccleston Hall, which, together with the\r\nestate, was probably purchased; his descendants remained there until\r\nthe death of Richard Stanley, in 1714, when Thomas Westby, of Upper\r\nRawcliffe, obtained possession of the land and mansion, both of which\r\nhave since descended in his line.\r\n\r\nAn Episcopal chapel was erected, in 1723, on the summit of a hill at\r\nCopp, almost a mile from the village of Great Eccleston, and near to\r\nElswick chapel, “which,” says Bishop Gastrell, “being never consecrated\r\nand in the possession of the Dissenters, it was thought more proper to\r\nbuild a new one there than to seize upon that.” Subjoined is a letter\r\nfrom John ffrance, of Little Eccleston Hall, to William Stafford,\r\nCommissary of Richmond, and Secretary to Bishop Gastrell, called forth by\r\nsundry matters in connection with the newly completed place of worship:—\r\n\r\n                                     “Eccleston parva, Aug. 3, 1724.\r\n\r\n  “Upon some discourse with Mr. Dixon (vicar of Kirkham) about Cop\r\n  Chapell I will give you the trouble of this. When Subscriptions\r\n  were desired towards building the said Chapell it was proposed\r\n  and intended to be not only for the use of the Inhabitants of\r\n  St. Michael’s, but likewise for the use of several townships,\r\n  which lye in the Parish of Kirkham, remote from their\r\n  Parish Church; and the Inhabitants of this township (Little\r\n  Eccleston-with-Larbrick) have contributed more towards the\r\n  Building than those of St. Michael’s, and would have erected it\r\n  within Kirkham Parish, if the situation had been thought equally\r\n  convenient. And likewise the person, who promised to pay the\r\n  hundred pounds towards the Queen’s Bounty, gave a note touching\r\n  the same, with conditions in favour of Kirkham Parish.\r\n\r\n  “Before the Chapell was erected the two Vicars of the Parishes\r\n  aforesaid were together, seemed to encourage our proceedings,\r\n  and talked amicably and agreeably about Nomination, etc.; but\r\n  since the Chapell was built several proposals have been made\r\n  to which the Vicar of Kirkham has consented, but the Vicar of\r\n  St. Michael’s seems to dislike them. One of the proposals was\r\n  that the determination of the affair might be referred to the\r\n  Bishop of Chester, whose generous offer to procure £100 towards\r\n  the Endowment of this Chapell gave great encouragement to our\r\n  undertaking the building thereof. Some people have refused\r\n  to pay their Subscriptions on pretence that the Vicar of St.\r\n  Michael’s has departed from former proposals; but we hope (if\r\n  these differences could be amicably settled to the satisfaction\r\n  of the neighbourhood) that not only the old, but likewise several\r\n  new Subscriptions might be procured, especially if our grateful\r\n  behaviour for by-past favours may continue his Lordship’s\r\n  Countenance and Encouragement; and we desire you to represent the\r\n  matter to him as favourably as you think it will bear.”\r\n\r\n                                             (Signed)  John ffrance.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was a small plain brick building, dedicated to St. Anne, but\r\nin 1841 a tower was added, and at the same time a burial ground was\r\nenclosed and licensed in connection with it. Great Eccleston, Elswick,\r\nand Little Eccleston-with-Larbrick townships were, in 1849, constituted a\r\nseparate ecclesiastical district, known as the parish of Copp, of which\r\nthis chapel is the parochial church. There is a vicarage house.\r\n\r\n  CURATES AND VICARS OF COPP.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-----------------------+---------------------\r\n    Date of   |       NAME.           | Cause of Vacancy.\r\n  Institution.|                       |\r\n  ------------+-----------------------+---------------------\r\n  Before 1775 |Christopher Swainson,  |\r\n              |  B.A.                 |\r\n              |                       |\r\n     ”   1841 |Reginald Sharpe        |\r\n              |                       |\r\n     In  1841 |Thomas Hathornthwaite, | Resignation of\r\n              |  L.L.D.               |   R.

Three fairs are held each year on March 14th, April\r\n14th, and November 4th, for cattle.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the free school at Copp has not been discovered, but the\r\nearliest endowment to be found dates from 1719, when William Fyld,\r\nyeoman, of Great Eccleston, left the remainder of his personal estate,\r\namounting to about £250, to be invested in trustees, and the interest\r\nto be paid yearly “for a Master to teach Poor Children here, or in some\r\nother part of the township.” By his will, dated 1st of April, 1748,\r\nWilliam Gaulter bequeathed £242 14s. to certain trustees to augment the\r\nstipend of the master of this school, and directed that in case the\r\neducational establishment should ever be abandoned, or the terms of\r\nthe will not be observed, the annual income derived from his bequest\r\nshould be distributed amongst the poor inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\r\nIn 1866 the school was temporarily closed, whilst the charity was\r\nunder the revision of the Charity Commissioners; and in 1871 a new and\r\nmore commodious building was erected. There is also another school in\r\nthis township, called Lane Head school, held in a building erected by\r\nsubscription on the site of the original one, which had collapsed through\r\nage. The only endowment is a rent charge of £5 supposed to have been left\r\nby Thomas Clitherall.\r\n\r\nWilliam Fyld, of Great Eccleston, bequeathed £2 annually to the poor of\r\nthat township.\r\n\r\nEllen Longworth left the interest of £20 to be distributed in bread to\r\nthe poor people attending divine service at Copp church.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF GREAT ECCLESTON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    455    540    648    624    661    631    641    565\r\n\r\nThe area of the township in statute acres is 1,412\r\n\r\nOUT RAWCLIFFE. The manor of Out Rawcliffe was presented to Theobald\r\nWalter by Richard I., and from that time to 1715 remained in the hands of\r\nthe same family. Theobald Walter, the son of the above-named gentleman,\r\nand _Butler_ of Ireland, a title which, as elsewhere stated, he adopted\r\nas a surname, gave the whole of Out Rawcliffe, and one carucate of land\r\nin Stainall, to his relative, perhaps son, Sir Richard Butler, and from\r\nhim sprang the long line of Butlers of Rawcliffe.[230] In 1627 the\r\ninquisition _post mortem_ of Henry Butler, of Rawcliffe Hall, revealed\r\nthat his possessions consisted of the two manors of Out and Middle\r\nRawcliffes, and of lands in Upper Rawcliffe.[231] Henry and Richard\r\nButler of Rawcliffe, father and eldest son, joined the ranks of the\r\ninsurgents in 1715, and after the suppression of the rebellion, their\r\nestates were confiscated; Henry escaped, but Richard was seized, and died\r\nin prison at London in 1716, before the day appointed for his execution.\r\nThe sale of Out Rawcliffe by Government was enrolled on the 19th of\r\nSeptember, 1723, the purchasers being the Rev. Richard Crombleholme,\r\n(vicar of St. Michael’s), John Leyland, Cornelius Fox, and James Poole;\r\nand in the diary of the Rev. Thos. Parkinson, curate of Garstang,\r\nreference is made to the completion and terms of the transfer as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “April 1723.— ... At night I preached for T. Raby, of Tarnacre,\r\n  at St. Michael’s. His son paid me 10s. Mr. Crombleholm, the vicar\r\n  there, came from London, whilst I was there, who, in conjunction\r\n  with three more, had bought Rawcliffe demain and tenants, paying\r\n  to the board £11,260. It cost them near £1,000 more in hush\r\n  money, as they call it.”\r\n\r\nIn 1729 the Rev. Richard Crombleholme, who seems to have bought up the\r\nshares of his co-investors, died, and five years later his heir, Edward\r\nCrombleholme, disposed of the lordship of Out Rawcliffe, with its\r\ncourts, fishing in the Wyre, rents, etc., to Thomas Roe, whose only child\r\nand heiress married John ffrance, of Little Eccleston Hall. The only son\r\nand heir of John ffrance, of Rawcliffe and Little Eccleston, also called\r\nJohn, became lord of the manor on the decease of his father in 1774. He\r\nespoused Margaret, the daughter and heiress of ⸺ Rigg, of Lancaster,\r\nand, dying without issue, devised his property, after the death of his\r\nwidow, to Thomas Wilson, of Preston, whose wife, the daughter of ⸺ Cross,\r\nof Shaw Hall, Chorley, was his nearest relative. Thomas Wilson assumed\r\nthe surname of ffrance in addition to his own, and was succeeded, under\r\nthe will of John ffrance, by his son, Thomas Robert Wilson-ffrance, who\r\neffected great improvements on the land by draining and re-covering the\r\nmosses, thereby increasing the value of the estate considerably. T. R.\r\nWilson-ffrance died in 1853, and Rawcliffe descended to his only son,\r\nRobert Wilson-ffrance, who lived but six years afterwards, and bequeathed\r\nhis estates to his sole offspring, Robert John Barton Wilson-ffrance,\r\nesq., at that time an infant, and now in possession. Rawcliffe Hall\r\nlies on the south of the township, in a park-like enclosure, leading to\r\nthe banks of the river Wyre. The present mansion was built in the 17th\r\ncentury, but during more recent years has undergone material alterations.\r\nThe remains of the Catholic chapel attached to it are situated at the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThe church of Out Rawcliffe was consecrated in 1837, and was erected by\r\nsubscription and a donation from the late T. R. Wilson-ffrance, esq., who\r\nalso gave the site, and retained the patronage. The style of architecture\r\nis said to resemble some portions of the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey,\r\nwith a fine Norman arch over the west end. There are 250 sittings, of\r\nwhich 150 are free. The first incumbent was the Rev. W. Chadwick, who was\r\nsucceeded by the Rev. Joshua Waltham. The Rev. James C. Home, M.A., is\r\nthe third and present holder of the living.\r\n\r\nThere is a good day-school supported out of the Rawcliffe estate.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF OUT RAWCLIFFE.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    413    484    598    575    728    791    771    832\r\n\r\nThe area in statute acres of Out Rawcliffe is 4,340.\r\n\r\nELSWICK. From the _Testa de Nevill_ it appears that about 1400 Warin\r\nde Wytingham and Alin de Singilton held respectively the eighth and\r\nsixteenth parts of a knight’s fee in Elswick from the Earl of Lincoln.\r\nEdmund Dudley had the manor until his attainder at the beginning of the\r\nreign of Henry VIII.; and in 1521, Thomas, earl of Derby, held it of that\r\nmonarch. The soil is now in the possession of several landowners.\r\n\r\nIn 1650 the Parliamentary Commissioners of the Commonwealth reported\r\nthat the inhabitants, “being fifty families, and five miles from their\r\nparish church, had lately, with the voluntary and free assistance of\r\nsome neighbouring towns, erected a chapel.” The Rev. Cuthbert Harrison,\r\nwho had been ejected from his benefice in Ireland for refusing the oath\r\nof Uniformity, procured a license from Charles II. in 1672 for the same\r\nchapel, “for the use of such as did not conform to the Church of England,\r\ncommonly called Congregational.” Parliament, however, decreed that the\r\nKing’s authority was insufficient, and forbade divine service to be held\r\nthere a short time later. In 1702 the chapel seems to have been again\r\nopened, and continued in use amongst the Independents until 1753, when\r\nit was superseded by a new one, enlarged in 1838. The memorial stone\r\nof the present chapel, erected to commemorate the persecutions under\r\nthe Five Mile Act of two centuries ago, was laid by Sir James Watts, of\r\nManchester, on the 30th of July, 1873, and the building completed with\r\nall expedition. The chapel stands on a plot of ground presented by Mrs.\r\nHarrison, of Bankfield, adjoining the site of the former edifice, and is\r\na handsome stone Gothic structure. The mortuary, with tower and spire,\r\nwas given by R. C.

In the Domesday Book Pluntun is entered as comprising\r\ntwo carucates of arable land. Robert de Stokeport died possessed of\r\nthe manor in 1248, and his daughter and heiress married Nicholas de\r\nEton as her first husband, and John de Arderne as her second. Robert\r\nde Eton, a descendant of her first marriage, obtained Wood Plumpton in\r\n1340. Cecily de Stokeport, heiress of the Etons, conveyed the manor\r\nto Sir Edward Warren, of Poynton, in which family it remained until\r\ntransferred, in 1777, to Viscount Thomas James Bulkeley on his marriage\r\nwith Elizabeth Harriet, only child of Sir George Warren. The Bulkeley\r\nproperty ultimately passed to the Fleming-Leycesters, whence Lord de\r\nTabley obtained the lordship. Charles Birley, esq., of Bartle Hall, is\r\nthe present possessor of the manor. Wood Plumpton Hall was anciently the\r\nseat of the Warrens, whilst Ambrose Hall was occupied by a family of the\r\nsame name, from which descended the Rev. Isaac Ambrose, who was ejected\r\nfrom Garstang by the Act of Uniformity. Richard Ambrose, of Ambrose Hall,\r\nleft a son and heir, William, who married the daughter of ⸺ Curwen of\r\nLancaster, and had issue a son, Nicholas. Nicholas Ambrose espoused Jane,\r\ndaughter of John Singleton, of Gingle Hall, Lancashire, and left six sons\r\nand a daughter, the eldest of whom, William, resided at Ambrose Hall in\r\n1567, and was twice married, first to Anne, widow of Lawrence Cotham, of\r\nSt. Michael’s-on-Wyre, and after her decease to Margaret, widow of Sir\r\nRichard Houghton. Flower’s heraldic visitation, from which the foregoing\r\nis extracted, was made in 1567, and consequently the pedigree cannot be\r\ntraced further.\r\n\r\nThe church of Wood Plumpton is very ancient, being probably in existence\r\nduring the earlier years of the 14th century. It was rebuilt in 1630, and\r\nhas subsequently undergone numerous alterations, consisting now of nave,\r\nchancel, and two aisles. The communion table has the date and initials\r\n“W. A. 1635” upon it, and a beam in the roof is carved with the year\r\n“1639.” An organ was obtained in 1849. The principal window, the gift of\r\nR. Waterworth, esq., of Preston, is beautifully emblazoned, in addition\r\nto which there are several other richly stained windows. A handsome\r\nmonument of marble, representing a sailor mourning, is situated in the\r\nnorth aisle, and was erected in memory of Henry Foster, R.N., F.R.S., son\r\nof a former incumbent who was drowned in 1831, in the river Chagres,\r\nGulf of Mexico. The church is dedicated to St. Anne, and the Rev. Isaac\r\nMossop is the present vicar.\r\n\r\nThere is a Roman Catholic chapel at Cottam, erected in 1793. The date\r\nof the original one is unknown, but in 1768 it was almost completely\r\ndestroyed by an election mob. A Wesleyan chapel was built in 1815, and\r\nanother for the Primitive Methodists about 1819.\r\n\r\nThe township contains an auxiliary workhouse, connected with the Preston\r\nUnion, which was erected in 1823. Annual courts are held for the manor of\r\nWood Plumpton, which includes the hamlets of Catforth, Eaves, Bartle, and\r\nWood Plumpton.\r\n\r\nThe school at Catforth was established by Alice Nicholson, of Bartle,\r\nwho gave in 1661 the sum of £100 in trust for the maintenance of a free\r\nschool within the manor of Wood Plumpton. Subsequent benefactions have\r\nbeen received as follows:—The same Alice Nicholson £10 by will, in 1664;\r\nJohn Hudson, of Lea, £20 by will, in 1676; John Hall, of Catforth, £20\r\nby deed, in 1732; James Hall, of Catforth, £10 by will, in 1741; Richard\r\nEccles, £100 by will, in 1762; Elizabeth Bell, £100 by deed, in 1813;\r\nRichard Threlfall, £20 by deed in 1813; and Ann Robinson, £90 by will in\r\n1817. The total endowment up to 1813, amounting to £380, was invested on\r\nthe 21st of April in that year, in the navy five per cents., in the name\r\nof the trustees. The further bequest of £90 was placed out at interest.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, Ann Robinson, the benefactress just mentioned, also left £90 in\r\ntrust, the interest to be given to the master teaching the Sunday school\r\nat Wood Plumpton church.\r\n\r\nThomas Houghton gave, in 1649, the fourth part of the rental of an estate\r\nin Wood Plumpton to the poor of that township.\r\n\r\nIt is recited in an indenture, dated 9th January, 1709, that George\r\nNicholson bequeathed the rents of several closes of land, which he stood\r\npossessed of for a certain term of years, in trust, for the poor of Wood\r\nPlumpton, and also left for the same charitable object, the sum of £200,\r\nto be retained by his executors, and the interest only distributed,\r\nuntil the expiration of the above term, when the sum should be paid to\r\nthe churchwardens and overseers, and used as heretofore. The indenture\r\nfurther recites that on the death of George Nicholson in 1672, a Chancery\r\nsuit arose out of the will, the result being that the poor were awarded\r\n£210 as a settlement of their legal claims upon the property of the\r\ndeceased. The money was ordered to be invested, and the annual income\r\nbestowed as directed by the testator.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF WOOD PLUMPTON.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n  1,197  1,397  1,635  1,719  1,688  1,574  1,462  1,290\r\n\r\nThe township comprises 4,722 statute acres.\r\n\r\nINSKIP-WITH-SOWERBY. In the Domesday volume this township appears as\r\ncontaining three carucates of arable soil. Richard Butler, of Rawcliffe\r\nHall, obtained the manor of Inskip in 1281 as the dowry of his bride\r\nAlicia, daughter of William de Carleton. Inskip was held by Cuthbert\r\nClifton, of Clifton, in 1512, from whom it descended to Sir W. Molyneux,\r\nof Larbrick and Sefton, who had espoused his sole child and heiress.\r\nIn 1554-68 it was in the possession of Henry Kighley, and afterwards\r\npassed to William Cavendish, earl of Devonshire, on his marriage with the\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of that gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe fishery of “Saureby Mere” belonged to William Hoghton in 1519, at\r\nwhich epoch Thomas Rigmayden and the earl of Derby had lands in Sowerby.\r\nThe Stanleys have for long been lords of Sowerby and continue to hold a\r\ncourt-baron there. In Inskip also a court-baron takes place each year in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nA church, dedicated to St. Peter, was erected in 1848 at the joint\r\nexpense of the earl of Derby and the Ven. Archdeacon Hornby, vicar of\r\nSt. Michael’s-on-Wyre. The living, now a vicarage, is endowed with £100\r\nper annum out of the corn rents. The Rev. A. Sharples, B.A., appointed\r\nshortly after the church was built, is the present vicar.\r\n\r\nOne-fourth of the rentals from certain lands in Goosnargh and Chipping\r\nwas given by Thomas Knowles in 1686 to the poor of Inskip.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 John Jolly bequeathed the residue of his estate in trust, for\r\nthe use of such poor housekeepers of Inskip-with-Sowerby as received no\r\nparochial relief.\r\n\r\n  POPULATION OF INSKIP-WITH-SOWERBY.\r\n\r\n   1801.  1811.  1821.  1831.  1841.  1851.  1861.  1871.\r\n    635    647    739    798    735    680    663    593\r\n\r\nThe area of the township in statute acres amounts to 2,888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPAUPERISM AND THE FYLDE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it was not customary to\r\nrecognise the pauper as a person whose misfortunes, however brought\r\nabout, called for charitable aid, but all legislature was directed\r\nagainst his class under the common title of vagabonds. A statute of\r\n1384 decreed that all vagrants should be arrested and either placed in\r\nthe stocks, or imprisoned until the visit of the justices, who would do\r\nwith them whatever seemed best by law; and in 1496 the punishment of\r\nincarceration was abolished, but the stocks were retained. The sixteenth\r\ncentury initiated a little more considerate state of things, and justices\r\nof the peace were authorised in 1531 to grant begging licenses to any\r\nnecessitous persons in their districts unable to work for a livelihood.\r\nAn act of 1547 ordained that any vagabond, not incapacitated by old age\r\nor illness, loitering and not seeking work for three days should be\r\nbrought before a magistrate, who was directed to adjudge such vagrant\r\nto be, for two years, the slave of the person by whom he had been\r\napprehended, in addition to which he had to be branded with the letter\r\nV on the breast. In case he ran away the law ordered that a further\r\nbranding of the sign S should be inflicted, this time on his forehead\r\nor the ball of his cheek, and that slavery should be his perpetual\r\nportion. A third escape entailed death when re-captured. This enactment\r\nwas never really enforced as popular indignation at its extreme severity\r\nwas aroused at once, and after lingering two years it was repealed in\r\nfavour of the stocks-legislature. In 1551 it was decreed that a register\r\nof destitute persons should be kept in each parish, and that alms should\r\nbe collected in Whit-week, whilst on the Sunday following, during divine\r\nservice at church, “the collectors should gently ask and demand of every\r\nman and woman what they of their charity would give weekly towards\r\nthe relief of the poor.” The funds so obtained were to be distributed\r\namongst the poor “after such sort that the more impotent might have the\r\nmore help, and such as could get part of their living the less.” Eleven\r\nyears later a statute ordained that if any person refused to contribute\r\nalms when called upon he should be summoned before a justice, who would\r\ndetermine the amount he had to pay, and commit him to gaol in case of\r\nfurther refusal. The legislative body of Queen Elizabeth passed “An Act\r\nfor the punishment of vagabonds and the relief of the poor and impotent,”\r\nby which justices of the peace were instructed to register the names of\r\nall the impotent poor who had been born within their several districts,\r\nor been existing there on alms within the three preceding years; to\r\nassign to them convenient places for dwellings or lodgings, in case the\r\nparish had not already undertaken that duty of its own free will; to\r\nassess the inhabitants to a weekly charge; and to appoint overseers of\r\nthe poor, having authority to exact a certain amount of work from those\r\ncandidates for relief who were not entirely disabled from labour by age,\r\nsickness, or deformity. In 1575-6 it was ordered that a stock of wool\r\nor hemp should be provided in the different parishes for the purpose\r\nof “setting the poor at work,” and that “Houses of Correction” should\r\nbe established, in which vagrants or tramps were to be detained, the\r\nable-bodied being furnished with employment until a service was found for\r\nthem, and the infirm transferred to an alms-house as soon as practicable.\r\nThe “Houses of Correction,” the origin of our workhouses, were directed\r\nto be built in large cities, or in the central towns of wide districts,\r\nthus the one for the Fylde was situated at Preston, an old college of\r\nGrey Friars lying to the south of Marsh Lane being converted to that\r\nuse. Dr. Kuerden described this building more than two centuries ago\r\nas the “old Friary, now only reserved for the reforming of vagabonds,\r\nsturdy beggars, and petty larcenary thieves, and other people wanting\r\ngood behaviour; it is the country prison to entertain such persons\r\nwith hard work, spare diet, and whipping, and it is called the House of\r\nCorrection.” The present gaol of Preston was not completed until 1789,\r\nand by force of habit the expressive title of its predecessor has clung\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nIn 39 Elizabeth, 1597, an act came into force by which all previous\r\nlegislation on the subject under consideration was repealed, and which\r\ndecreed that overseers of the poor should be appointed in every parish,\r\nwhose duty it should be to levy a rate upon the inhabitants for the\r\nsupport of the indigent, under the direction and with the approval of the\r\nlocal magistrates; in addition there were special regulations for the\r\ntreatment of rogues, vagrants, and able beggars, for whom whipping and\r\nthe stocks were ordered, after undergoing which punishments these idlers\r\nwere to be returned at once to their native parishes and placed under the\r\nguardianship of the local authorities there.\r\n\r\nFour years later certain modifications were made in the early part of the\r\nlast statute, but the main principle of individual taxation by overseers,\r\nunder the superintendence of justices of the peace, was retained\r\nunaltered. The chief objects of the law as it stood at the end of 1601\r\nwere—to relieve the lame, sick, aged, impotent, and blind; to compel\r\nothers of the poor to work, and to put out their children as apprentices.\r\n\r\nAt that time any one leaving his employment and wandering beyond the\r\nboundaries of his parish without any ostensible means of gaining a\r\nlivelihood was liable to be arrested and punished as a vagabond, in\r\naddition he was compelled to return to his own district in disgrace;\r\nso that whether a law confining labourers to their own neighbourhoods\r\nexisted then or not, it is certain that they had little inducement to\r\nventure forth amongst strangers.\r\n\r\nIn 1662, during the reign of Charles II., the Law of Settlement was\r\npassed, by which all members of such classes as were likely to become\r\nat some period or other chargeable to the parish rates, were compelled\r\nto settle themselves on the parochial district to which they were\r\nconnected by birth, marriage, apprenticeship, or similar ties; and upon\r\nwhich parish alone they would subsequently have any claim. In this way\r\nthe unfortunate peasantry and labouring population were more securely\r\nthan ever imprisoned within their parishes, for if they escaped the\r\nfate of the rogue and vagabond, and obtained work in another part of\r\nthe country, they were generally hunted out and driven home for fear\r\nthey should become burdens on rates to which they had no title. Such a\r\ncondition of things went on with little change for nearly two centuries,\r\nbut the causes which finally brought about a material alteration in the\r\narrangement of pauper relief will be noticed in the context. The erection\r\nof workhouses for the different parishes of the kingdom was sanctioned\r\nin 1723 by the legislature, and three years later, as learnt from the\r\nfollowing extract out of the minute book of the bailiffs of Kirkham, the\r\ninhabitants of that town determined to establish one:—\r\n\r\n  “22 May, 1726:—Mem. That the town of Kirkham was summonsed from\r\n  house to house, and the inhabitants unanimously agreed to the\r\n  setting up of a workhouse.”\r\n\r\nThe act which decreed the building of workhouses for the employment\r\nof the poor, stated that if any one refused to enter those houses, or\r\nobjected to perform his share of labour, no relief should be apportioned\r\nto him. There can be little doubt that workhouses sprang up at Poulton\r\nand in the other parishes of the Fylde about that date, as well as at\r\nKirkham, but in their cases there are no bailiffs’ registers, or similar\r\nrecords, to fall back upon for proof as to the accuracy of the surmise,\r\nand consequently we are unable to speak with absolute certainty. In the\r\ntwenty-second year of the reign of George III. (1782), it was enacted\r\nthat the guardians of the poor should employ the paupers of their\r\nseparate parishes in labour on the land at small remuneration, and that\r\nthe poor rate should be used only to increase the payment to a sum\r\nlarge enough for the subsistence of each pauper thus employed. Country\r\njustices, desirous of standing well in the opinion of the peasantry, were\r\nnot over scrupulous in the discharge of their supervisionary functions,\r\nand granted or sanctioned the granting of relief orders without any\r\nminute inquiry into the merits of the cases. Immorality was encouraged\r\nby an allowance from the poor-rate to the mother for each illegitimate\r\nchild. Practical responsibility for the proper administration of the\r\nfund rested on no one, and about 1830 “the poor-rate had become public\r\nspoil, the ignorant believed it an inexhaustible source of wealth, which\r\nbelonged to them; the brutal bullied the administrators to obtain their\r\nshare; the profligate exhibited their bastards, which must be fed; the\r\nidle folded their arms and waited till they got it; ignorant boys and\r\ngirls married upon it; country justices lavished it for popularity, and\r\nguardians for convenience.”[232]\r\n\r\nIn 1832 a Royal Commission was appointed to visit the different parishes,\r\nand investigate the abuses which were being universally carried on; and\r\nin 1834 a bill was brought in to amend the laws relative to the Relief\r\nof the Poor in England and Wales, and passed that year, some of the main\r\nclauses being—an acknowledgment of the claims to the relief of the really\r\nnecessitous, the abolition of settlement by hiring and service, and of\r\nall out-door relief to the able-bodied. The enactment provided for the\r\nunion of small and neighbouring parishes, the rating and expenditure of\r\nthe rates remaining a distinct and separate matter; each union was to\r\nhave a common workhouse for all its parishes, in which the men, women,\r\nchildren, able-bodied, and infirm must be separated, and where the\r\nable-bodied inmates should do a certain amount of work for each meal. The\r\ndistribution of relief was left to the guardians and select vestries,\r\nand to the overseers in their absence. The whole system of unions and\r\nparish relief was placed under the control of a Central Board, by whom\r\neverything was arranged and settled, and to whom any appeals were to be\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nShortly after the passing of this act, the following twenty-three\r\ntownships of the Fylde were banded together for parochial\r\npurposes, and denominated the Fylde Union:—Bispham-with-Norbreck,\r\nBryning-with-Kellamergh, Carleton, Clifton-with-Salwick, Little\r\nEccleston-with-Larbrick, Elswick, Freckleton, Greenhalgh-with-Thistleton,\r\nHardhorn-with-Newton, Kirkham, Layton-with-Warbreck, Lytham, Marton,\r\nMedlam-with-Wesham, Newton-with-Scales, Poulton, Ribby-with-Wrea,\r\nSingleton, Thornton, Treales, Roseacre, Wharles, Warton,\r\nWeeton-with-Preese, and Westby-with-Plumptons. In 1844 the guardians\r\nerected the Union Workhouse at Kirkham, at a cost of about £5,400, and\r\nin 1864 the building was enlarged so as to be able to accommodate 250\r\npaupers. All small, local workhouses in the districts comprised in the\r\nunion were of course closed on the opening of the central one. The\r\nguardians of the different townships constitute a board, in whose hands\r\nrests the regulation of all matters concerning the union.\r\n\r\nBy a subsequent act, the original Central Board of Poor Law Commissioners\r\nwas superseded by a controlling board composed of four members of the\r\ngovernment, _ex officio_, and certain other commissioners appointed\r\nby Her Majesty in council, the inspectors, whom, it should have been\r\nmentioned, were provided under the previous act, were now invested with\r\nmore extended powers; workhouse visitors were appointed; annual reports\r\nwere ordered to be issued; and a clause forbidding the cohabitation of\r\nman and wife in the workhouses was dispensed with after the parties had\r\narrived at sixty years of age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] William Camden was born in London in 1551.

Sir Cuthbert purchased\r\nLittle Marton and the monastic portion of Lytham from Sir John Holcroft\r\nin 1606. He was knighted by James I. at Lathom House.\r\n\r\n[61] See Out Rawcliffe in the chapter on St. Michaels’ parish for the\r\nWilson-ffrance descent.\r\n\r\n[62] See page 72.\r\n\r\n[63] Dugdale’s Visitation.\r\n\r\n[64] Richard Longworth, of St. Michael’s Hall, a justice of the peace.\r\n\r\n[65] The small Lᵈ of Roshall was Edward Fleetwood, of Rossall Hall, who\r\nat this time was thirty years of age.\r\n\r\n[66] John Westby, of Mowbreck, was probably the builder or purchaser of\r\nBurn Hall about the middle of the sixteenth century. See pedigree above\r\nat that date.\r\n\r\n[67] Pawnage, or Pannage, signified the food of swine to be found in\r\nwoods, such as acorns and beech-mast, etc.\r\n\r\n[68] Regist. S. Mariæ de Lanc.

He retired from\r\npractice to his native town of Poulton in 1836, and remained there until\r\nhis demise.\r\n\r\n[74] “Enter and pray, if you have raised to heaven your open palms you\r\nwill have performed sacred duties, and will fly from evil things.”\r\n\r\n[75] Mr. Rudhall, as we learn from the following entry in the registers\r\nof the 30 men of Kirkham, was in business at Gloucester:—“1749, April\r\n14. Paid old Mr. Rudhall for coming from Gloucester to take notes of the\r\nbells when the 2nd. was recast, £3 3s. 0d.”\r\n\r\n[76] The Pancake Bell is usually rung by an apprentice of the town as a\r\nsignal for his _confreres_ to discontinue work for that day, but strange\r\nto say on a late occasion not one apprentice could be found in the whole\r\nof Poulton, and consequently the duty was performed by the ordinary\r\nbell-ringer.\r\n\r\n[77] In all previously issued lists of vicars, Richard Fleetwood has\r\nerroneously been named as patron in this instance. There was no Rich.\r\nFleetwood of Rossall at that time, and Edward, who had been patron at the\r\nformer institution, was probably still alive as he had no son and but one\r\ndaughter, who married Roger Hesketh, the next patron in right of his wife.\r\n\r\n[78] In 1876 a brass plate was found in Poulton church, near the site of\r\nthe old communion table, inscribed:—“Here lies the body of Anne, wife of\r\nRichard Harrison, vicar of Poolton, who dyed the 24th of December, 1679,\r\naged 55 years.”\r\n\r\n[79] From these entries it would seem that the regulation of 1782 soon\r\nbecame a dead letter, if indeed it were ever carried into practice.\r\n\r\n[80] The Battle and Victory of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[81] Visitation of St. George.\r\n\r\n[82] For a full description of the direction taken by this road, see page\r\n7.\r\n\r\n[83] The Rev.

Their present station in Abbot’s Walk was\r\nerected in 1864, and comprises cottage accommodation for six men, and\r\nanother residence for the officer in command.\r\n\r\n[86] Newly-built vessels registered for the first time, the other\r\nvessels belonging to the harbour being transferred from other parts and\r\nre-registered here.\r\n\r\n[87] Rot.
