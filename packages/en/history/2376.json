While they were appearing in that magazine I was constantly\r\nsurprised at the number of requests which came to me from all parts of\r\nthe country, asking that the articles be permanently preserved in book\r\nform. I am most grateful to the Outlook for permission to gratify these\r\nrequests.\r\n\r\nI have tried to tell a simple, straightforward story, with no attempt\r\nat embellishment. My regret is that what I have attempted to do has\r\nbeen done so imperfectly. The greater part of my time and strength is\r\nrequired for the executive work connected with the Tuskegee Normal and\r\nIndustrial Institute, and in securing the money necessary for the\r\nsupport of the institution. Much of what I have said has been written\r\non board trains, or at hotels or railroad stations while I have been\r\nwaiting for trains, or during the moments that I could spare from my\r\nwork while at Tuskegee. Without the painstaking and generous assistance\r\nof Mr. Max Bennett Thrasher I could not have succeeded in any\r\nsatisfactory degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe details of Mr. Washington’s early life, as frankly set down in “Up\r\nfrom Slavery,” do not give quite a whole view of his education. He had\r\nthe training that a coloured youth receives at Hampton, which, indeed,\r\nthe autobiography does explain. But the reader does not get his\r\nintellectual pedigree, for Mr. Washington himself, perhaps, does not as\r\nclearly understand it as another man might. The truth is he had a\r\ntraining during the most impressionable period of his life that was\r\nvery extraordinary, such a training as few men of his generation have\r\nhad. To see its full meaning one must start in the Hawaiian Islands\r\nhalf a century or more ago.* There Samuel Armstrong, a youth of\r\nmissionary parents, earned enough money to pay his expenses at an\r\nAmerican college. Equipped with this small sum and the earnestness that\r\nthe undertaking implied, he came to Williams College when Dr. Mark\r\nHopkins was president. Williams College had many good things for youth\r\nin that day, as it has in this, but the greatest was the strong\r\npersonality of its famous president. Every student does not profit by a\r\ngreat teacher; but perhaps no young man ever came under the influence\r\nof Dr. Hopkins, whose whole nature was so ripe for profit by such an\r\nexperience as young Armstrong. He lived in the family of President\r\nHopkins, and thus had a training that was wholly out of the common; and\r\nthis training had much to do with the development of his own strong\r\ncharacter, whose originality and force we are only beginning to\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\n   * For this interesting view of Mr. Washington’s education, I am\r\n   indebted to Robert C. Ogden, Esq., Chairman of the Board of Trustees\r\n   of Hampton Institute and the intimate friend of General Armstrong\r\n   during the whole period of his educational work.\r\n\r\nIn turn, Samuel Armstrong, the founder of Hampton Institute, took up\r\nhis work as a trainer of youth. He had very raw material, and doubtless\r\nmost of his pupils failed to get the greatest lessons from him; but, as\r\nhe had been a peculiarly receptive pupil of Dr. Hopkins, so Booker\r\nWashington became a peculiarly receptive pupil of his. To the formation\r\nof Mr. Washington’s character, then, went the missionary zeal of New\r\nEngland, influenced by one of the strongest personalities in modern\r\neducation, and the wide-reaching moral earnestness of General Armstrong\r\nhimself. These influences are easily recognizable in Mr. Washington\r\nto-day by men who knew Dr. Hopkins and General Armstrong.\r\n\r\nI got the cue to Mr. Washington’s character from a very simple incident\r\nmany years ago. I had never seen him, and I knew little about him,\r\nexcept that he was the head of a school at Tuskegee, Alabama. I had\r\noccasion to write to him, and I addressed him as “The Rev. Booker T.\r\nWashington.” In his reply there was no mention of my addressing him as\r\na clergyman. But when I had occasion to write to him again, and\r\npersisted in making him a preacher, his second letter brought a\r\npostscript: “I have no claim to ‘Rev.’” I knew most of the coloured men\r\nwho at that time had become prominent as leaders of their race, but I\r\nhad not then known one who was neither a politician nor a preacher; and\r\nI had not heard of the head of an important coloured school who was not\r\na preacher. “A new kind of man in the coloured world,” I said to\r\nmyself—“a new kind of man surely if he looks upon his task as an\r\neconomic one instead of a theological one.” I wrote him an apology for\r\nmistaking him for a preacher.\r\n\r\nThe first time that I went to Tuskegee I was asked to make an address\r\nto the school on Sunday evening. I sat upon the platform of the large\r\nchapel and looked forth on a thousand coloured faces, and the choir of\r\na hundred or more behind me sang a familiar religious melody, and the\r\nwhole company joined in the chorus with unction. I was the only white\r\nman under the roof, and the scene and the songs made an impression on\r\nme that I shall never forget. Mr. Washington arose and asked them to\r\nsing one after another of the old melodies that I had heard all my\r\nlife; but I had never before heard them sung by a thousand voices nor\r\nby the voices of educated Negroes. I had associated them with the Negro\r\nof the past, not with the Negro who was struggling upward. They brought\r\nto my mind the plantation, the cabin, the slave, not the freedman in\r\nquest of education. But on the plantation and in the cabin they had\r\nnever been sung as these thousand students sang them. I saw again all\r\nthe old plantations that I had ever seen; the whole history of the\r\nNegro ran through my mind; and the inexpressible pathos of his life\r\nfound expression in these songs as I had never before felt it.\r\n\r\nAnd the future? These were the ambitious youths of the race, at work\r\nwith an earnestness that put to shame the conventional student life of\r\nmost educational institutions. Another song rolled up along the\r\nrafters. And as soon as silence came, I found myself in front of this\r\nextraordinary mass of faces, thinking not of them, but of that long and\r\nunhappy chapter in our country’s history which followed the one great\r\nstructural mistake of the Fathers of the Republic; thinking of the one\r\ncontinuous great problem that generations of statesmen had wrangled\r\nover, and a million men fought about, and that had so dwarfed the mass\r\nof English men in the Southern States as to hold them back a hundred\r\nyears behind their fellows in every other part of the world—in England,\r\nin Australia, and in the Northern and Western States; I was thinking of\r\nthis dark shadow that had oppressed every large-minded statesman from\r\nJefferson to Lincoln. These thousand young men and women about me were\r\nvictims of it. I, too, was an innocent victim of it. The whole Republic\r\nwas a victim of that fundamental error of importing Africa into\r\nAmerica. I held firmly to the first article of my faith that the\r\nRepublic must stand fast by the principle of a fair ballot; but I\r\nrecalled the wretched mess that Reconstruction had made of it; I\r\nrecalled the low level of public life in all the “black” States. Every\r\neffort of philanthropy seemed to have miscarried, every effort at\r\ncorrecting abuses seemed of doubtful value, and the race friction\r\nseemed to become severer. Here was the century-old problem in all its\r\npathos seated singing before me. Who were the more to be pitied—these\r\ninnocent victims of an ancient wrong, or I and men like me, who had\r\ninherited the problem? I had long ago thrown aside illusions and\r\ntheories, and was willing to meet the facts face to face, and to do\r\nwhatever in God’s name a man might do towards saving the next\r\ngeneration from such a burden. But I felt the weight of twenty\r\nwell-nigh hopeless years of thought and reading and observation; for\r\nthe old difficulties remained and new ones had sprung up. Then I saw\r\nclearly that the way out of a century of blunders had been made by this\r\nman who stood beside me and was introducing me to this audience. Before\r\nme was the material he had used. All about me was the indisputable\r\nevidence that he had found the natural line of development. He had\r\nshown the way. Time and patience and encouragement and work would do\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nIt was then more clearly than ever before that I understood the\r\npatriotic significance of Mr. Washington’s work. It is this conception\r\nof it and of him that I have ever since carried with me. It is on this\r\nthat his claim to our gratitude rests.\r\n\r\nTo teach the Negro to read, whether English, or Greek, or Hebrew,\r\nbutters no parsnips. To make the Negro work, that is what his master\r\ndid in one way and hunger has done in another; yet both these left\r\nSouthern life where they found it. But to teach the Negro to do skilful\r\nwork, as men of all the races that have risen have worked,—responsible\r\nwork, which IS education and character; and most of all when Negroes so\r\nteach Negroes to do this that they will teach others with a missionary\r\nzeal that puts all ordinary philanthropic efforts to shame,—this is to\r\nchange the whole economic basis of life and the whole character of a\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe plan itself is not a new one. It was worked out at Hampton\r\nInstitute, but it was done at Hampton by white men. The plan had, in\r\nfact, been many times theoretically laid down by thoughtful students of\r\nSouthern life. Handicrafts were taught in the days of slavery on most\r\nwell-managed plantations. But Tuskegee is, nevertheless, a brand-new\r\nchapter in the history of the Negro, and in the history of the\r\nknottiest problem we have ever faced. It not only makes “a carpenter of\r\na man; it makes a man of a carpenter.” In one sense, therefore, it is\r\nof greater value than any other institution for the training of men and\r\nwomen that we have, from Cambridge to Palo Alto. It is almost the only\r\none of which it may be said that it points the way to a new epoch in a\r\nlarge area of our national life.\r\n\r\nTo work out the plan on paper, or at a distance—that is one thing. For\r\na white man to work it out—that too, is an easy thing. For a coloured\r\nman to work it out in the South, where, in its constructive period, he\r\nwas necessarily misunderstood by his own people as well as by the\r\nwhites, and where he had to adjust it at every step to the strained\r\nrace relations—that is so very different and more difficult a thing\r\nthat the man who did it put the country under lasting obligations to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was not and is not a mere educational task. Anybody could teach boys\r\ntrades and give them an elementary education. Such tasks have been done\r\nsince the beginning of civilization. But this task had to be done with\r\nthe rawest of raw material, done within the civilization of the\r\ndominant race, and so done as not to run across race lines and social\r\nlines that are the strongest forces in the community. It had to be done\r\nfor the benefit of the whole community. It had to be done, moreover,\r\nwithout local help, in the face of the direst poverty, done by begging,\r\nand done in spite of the ignorance of one race and the prejudice of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nNo man living had a harder task, and a task that called for more wisdom\r\nto do it right. The true measure of Mr. Washington’s success is, then,\r\nnot his teaching the pupils of Tuskegee, nor even gaining the support\r\nof philanthropic persons at a distance, but this—that every Southern\r\nwhite man of character and of wisdom has been won to a cordial\r\nrecognition of the value of the work, even men who held and still hold\r\nto the conviction that a mere book education for the Southern blacks\r\nunder present conditions is a positive evil. This is a demonstration of\r\nthe efficiency of the Hampton-Tuskegee idea that stands like the\r\ndemonstration of the value of democratic institutions themselves—a\r\ndemonstration made so clear in spite of the greatest odds that it is no\r\nlonger open to argument.\r\n\r\nConsider the change that has come in twenty years in the discussion of\r\nthe Negro problem. Two or three decades ago social philosophers and\r\nstatisticians and well-meaning philanthropists were still talking and\r\nwriting about the deportation of the Negroes, or about their settlement\r\nwithin some restricted area, or about their settling in all parts of\r\nthe Union, or about their decline through their neglect of their\r\nchildren, or about their rapid multiplication till they should expel\r\nthe whites from the South—of every sort of nonsense under heaven. All\r\nthis has given place to the simple plan of an indefinite extension\r\namong the neglected classes of both races of the Hampton-Tuskegee\r\nsystem of training. The “problem” in one sense has disappeared. The\r\nfuture will have for the South swift or slow development of its masses\r\nand of its soil in proportion to the swift or slow development of this\r\nkind of training. This change of view is a true measure of Mr.\r\nWashington’s work.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the Negro in America is colossal, from political\r\noratory through abolitionism to “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” and “Cotton is\r\nKing”—a vast mass of books which many men have read to the waste of\r\ngood years (and I among them); but the only books that I have read a\r\nsecond time or ever care again to read in the whole list (most of them\r\nby tiresome and unbalanced “reformers”) are “Uncle Remus” and “Up from\r\nSlavery”; for these are the great literature of the subject. One has\r\nall the best of the past, the other foreshadows a better future; and\r\nthe men who wrote them are the only men who have written of the subject\r\nwith that perfect frankness and perfect knowledge and perfect poise\r\nwhose other name is genius.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington has won a world-wide fame at an early age. His story of\r\nhis own life already has the distinction of translation into more\r\nlanguages, I think, than any other American book; and I suppose that he\r\nhas as large a personal acquaintance among men of influence as any\r\nprivate citizen now living.\r\n\r\nHis own teaching at Tuskegee is unique. He lectures to his advanced\r\nstudents on the art of right living, not out of text-books, but\r\nstraight out of life. Then he sends them into the country to visit\r\nNegro families. Such a student will come back with a minute report of\r\nthe way in which the family that he has seen lives, what their earnings\r\nare, what they do well and what they do ill; and he will explain how\r\nthey might live better. He constructs a definite plan for the\r\nbetterment of that particular family out of the resources that they\r\nhave. Such a student, if he be bright, will profit more by an\r\nexperience like this than he could profit by all the books on sociology\r\nand economics that ever were written. I talked with a boy at Tuskegee\r\nwho had made such a study as this, and I could not keep from\r\ncontrasting his knowledge and enthusiasm with what I heard in a class\r\nroom at a Negro university in one of the Southern cities, which is\r\nconducted on the idea that a college course will save the soul. Here\r\nthe class was reciting a lesson from an abstruse text-book on\r\neconomics, reciting it by rote, with so obvious a failure to assimilate\r\nit that the waste of labour was pitiful.\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Washington years ago what he regarded as the most important\r\nresult of his work, and he replied:\r\n\r\n“I do not know which to put first, the effect of Tuskegee’s work on the\r\nNegro, or the effect on the attitude of the white man to the Negro.”\r\n\r\nThe race divergence under the system of miseducation was fast getting\r\nwider. Under the influence of the Hampton-Tuskegee idea the races are\r\ncoming into a closer sympathy and into an honourable and helpful\r\nrelation. As the Negro becomes economically independent, he becomes a\r\nresponsible part of the Southern life; and the whites so recognize him.\r\nAnd this must be so from the nature of things. There is nothing\r\nartificial about it. It is development in a perfectly natural way. And\r\nthe Southern whites not only so recognize it, but they are imitating it\r\nin the teaching of the neglected masses of their own race. It has thus\r\ncome about that the school is taking a more direct and helpful hold on\r\nlife in the South than anywhere else in the country. Education is not a\r\nthing apart from life—not a “system,” nor a philosophy; it is direct\r\nteaching how to live and how to work.\r\n\r\nTo say that Mr. Washington has won the gratitude of all thoughtful\r\nSouthern white men, is to say that he has worked with the highest\r\npractical wisdom at a large constructive task; for no plan for the\r\nup-building of the freedman could succeed that ran counter to Southern\r\nopinion. To win the support of Southern opinion and to shape it was a\r\nnecessary part of the task; and in this he has so well succeeded that\r\nthe South has a sincere and high regard for him. He once said to me\r\nthat he recalled the day, and remembered it thankfully, when he grew\r\nlarge enough to regard a Southern white man as he regarded a Northern\r\none. It is well for our common country that the day is come when he and\r\nhis work are regarded as highly in the South as in any other part of\r\nthe Union. I think that no man of our generation has a more noteworthy\r\nachievement to his credit than this; and it is an achievement of moral\r\nearnestness of the strong character of a man who has done a great\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\nWalter H. Page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUP FROM SLAVERY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\nA Slave Among Slaves\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born a slave on a plantation in Franklin County, Virginia. I am\r\nnot quite sure of the exact place or exact date of my birth, but at any\r\nrate I suspect I must have been born somewhere and at some time. As\r\nnearly as I have been able to learn, I was born near a cross-roads\r\npost-office called Hale’s Ford, and the year was 1858 or 1859. I do not\r\nknow the month or the day. The earliest impressions I can now recall\r\nare of the plantation and the slave quarters—the latter being the part\r\nof the plantation where the slaves had their cabins.\r\n\r\nMy life had its beginning in the midst of the most miserable, desolate,\r\nand discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my\r\nowners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many\r\nothers. I was born in a typical log cabin, about fourteen by sixteen\r\nfeet square. In this cabin I lived with my mother and a brother and\r\nsister till after the Civil War, when we were all declared free.\r\n\r\nOf my ancestry I know almost nothing. In the slave quarters, and even\r\nlater, I heard whispered conversations among the coloured people of the\r\ntortures which the slaves, including, no doubt, my ancestors on my\r\nmother’s side, suffered in the middle passage of the slave ship while\r\nbeing conveyed from Africa to America. I have been unsuccessful in\r\nsecuring any information that would throw any accurate light upon the\r\nhistory of my family beyond my mother. She, I remember, had a\r\nhalf-brother and a half-sister. In the days of slavery not very much\r\nattention was given to family history and family records—that is, black\r\nfamily records. My mother, I suppose, attracted the attention of a\r\npurchaser who was afterward my owner and hers. Her addition to the\r\nslave family attracted about as much attention as the purchase of a new\r\nhorse or cow. Of my father I know even less than of my mother. I do not\r\neven know his name. I have heard reports to the effect that he was a\r\nwhite man who lived on one of the near-by plantations. Whoever he was,\r\nI never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in\r\nany way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He\r\nwas simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the\r\nNation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was not only our living-place, but was also used as the\r\nkitchen for the plantation. My mother was the plantation cook. The\r\ncabin was without glass windows; it had only openings in the side which\r\nlet in the light, and also the cold, chilly air of winter. There was a\r\ndoor to the cabin—that is, something that was called a door—but the\r\nuncertain hinges by which it was hung, and the large cracks in it, to\r\nsay nothing of the fact that it was too small, made the room a very\r\nuncomfortable one. In addition to these openings there was, in the\r\nlower right-hand corner of the room, the “cat-hole,”—a contrivance\r\nwhich almost every mansion or cabin in Virginia possessed during the\r\nante-bellum period. The “cat-hole” was a square opening, about seven by\r\neight inches, provided for the purpose of letting the cat pass in and\r\nout of the house at will during the night. In the case of our\r\nparticular cabin I could never understand the necessity for this\r\nconvenience, since there were at least a half-dozen other places in the\r\ncabin that would have accommodated the cats. There was no wooden floor\r\nin our cabin, the naked earth being used as a floor. In the centre of\r\nthe earthen floor there was a large, deep opening covered with boards,\r\nwhich was used as a place in which to store sweet potatoes during the\r\nwinter. An impression of this potato-hole is very distinctly engraved\r\nupon my memory, because I recall that during the process of putting the\r\npotatoes in or taking them out I would often come into possession of\r\none or two, which I roasted and thoroughly enjoyed. There was no\r\ncooking-stove on our plantation, and all the cooking for the whites and\r\nslaves my mother had to do over an open fireplace, mostly in pots and\r\n“skillets.” While the poorly built cabin caused us to suffer with cold\r\nin the winter, the heat from the open fireplace in summer was equally\r\ntrying.\r\n\r\nThe early years of my life, which were spent in the little cabin, were\r\nnot very different from those of thousands of other slaves. My mother,\r\nof course, had little time in which to give attention to the training\r\nof her children during the day. She snatched a few moments for our care\r\nin the early morning before her work began, and at night after the\r\nday’s work was done. One of my earliest recollections is that of my\r\nmother cooking a chicken late at night, and awakening her children for\r\nthe purpose of feeding them. How or where she got it I do not know. I\r\npresume, however, it was procured from our owner’s farm. Some people\r\nmay call this theft. If such a thing were to happen now, I should\r\ncondemn it as theft myself. But taking place at the time it did, and\r\nfor the reason that it did, no one could ever make me believe that my\r\nmother was guilty of thieving. She was simply a victim of the system of\r\nslavery. I cannot remember having slept in a bed until after our family\r\nwas declared free by the Emancipation Proclamation. Three\r\nchildren—John, my older brother, Amanda, my sister, and myself—had a\r\npallet on the dirt floor, or, to be more correct, we slept in and on a\r\nbundle of filthy rags laid upon the dirt floor.\r\n\r\nI was asked not long ago to tell something about the sports and\r\npastimes that I engaged in during my youth. Until that question was\r\nasked it had never occurred to me that there was no period of my life\r\nthat was devoted to play. From the time that I can remember anything,\r\nalmost every day of my life had been occupied in some kind of labour;\r\nthough I think I would now be a more useful man if I had had time for\r\nsports. During the period that I spent in slavery I was not large\r\nenough to be of much service, still I was occupied most of the time in\r\ncleaning the yards, carrying water to the men in the fields, or going\r\nto the mill to which I used to take the corn, once a week, to be\r\nground. The mill was about three miles from the plantation. This work I\r\nalways dreaded. The heavy bag of corn would be thrown across the back\r\nof the horse, and the corn divided about evenly on each side; but in\r\nsome way, almost without exception, on these trips, the corn would so\r\nshift as to become unbalanced and would fall off the horse, and often I\r\nwould fall with it. As I was not strong enough to reload the corn upon\r\nthe horse, I would have to wait, sometimes for many hours, till a\r\nchance passer-by came along who would help me out of my trouble. The\r\nhours while waiting for some one were usually spent in crying. The time\r\nconsumed in this way made me late in reaching the mill, and by the time\r\nI got my corn ground and reached home it would be far into the night.\r\nThe road was a lonely one, and often led through dense forests. I was\r\nalways frightened. The woods were said to be full of soldiers who had\r\ndeserted from the army, and I had been told that the first thing a\r\ndeserter did to a Negro boy when he found him alone was to cut off his\r\nears. Besides, when I was late in getting home I knew I would always\r\nget a severe scolding or a flogging.\r\n\r\nI had no schooling whatever while I was a slave, though I remember on\r\nseveral occasions I went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of my\r\nyoung mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys\r\nand girls in a schoolroom engaged in study made a deep impression upon\r\nme, and I had the feeling that to get into a schoolhouse and study in\r\nthis way would be about the same as getting into paradise.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can now recall, the first knowledge that I got of the fact\r\nthat we were slaves, and that freedom of the slaves was being\r\ndiscussed, was early one morning before day, when I was awakened by my\r\nmother kneeling over her children and fervently praying that Lincoln\r\nand his armies might be successful, and that one day she and her\r\nchildren might be free. In this connection I have never been able to\r\nunderstand how the slaves throughout the South, completely ignorant as\r\nwere the masses so far as books or newspapers were concerned, were able\r\nto keep themselves so accurately and completely informed about the\r\ngreat National questions that were agitating the country. From the time\r\nthat Garrison, Lovejoy, and others began to agitate for freedom, the\r\nslaves throughout the South kept in close touch with the progress of\r\nthe movement. Though I was a mere child during the preparation for the\r\nCivil War and during the war itself, I now recall the many\r\nlate-at-night whispered discussions that I heard my mother and the\r\nother slaves on the plantation indulge in. These discussions showed\r\nthat they understood the situation, and that they kept themselves\r\ninformed of events by what was termed the “grape-vine” telegraph.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign when Lincoln was first a candidate for the\r\nPresidency, the slaves on our far-off plantation, miles from any\r\nrailroad or large city or daily newspaper, knew what the issues\r\ninvolved were. When war was begun between the North and the South,\r\nevery slave on our plantation felt and knew that, though other issues\r\nwere discussed, the primal one was that of slavery. Even the most\r\nignorant members of my race on the remote plantations felt in their\r\nhearts, with a certainty that admitted of no doubt, that the freedom of\r\nthe slaves would be the one great result of the war, if the Northern\r\narmies conquered. Every success of the Federal armies and every defeat\r\nof the Confederate forces was watched with the keenest and most intense\r\ninterest. Often the slaves got knowledge of the results of great\r\nbattles before the white people received it. This news was usually\r\ngotten from the coloured man who was sent to the post-office for the\r\nmail. In our case the post-office was about three miles from the\r\nplantation, and the mail came once or twice a week. The man who was\r\nsent to the office would linger about the place long enough to get the\r\ndrift of the conversation from the group of white people who naturally\r\ncongregated there, after receiving their mail, to discuss the latest\r\nnews. The mail-carrier on his way back to our master’s house would as\r\nnaturally retail the news that he had secured among the slaves, and in\r\nthis way they often heard of important events before the white people\r\nat the “big house,” as the master’s house was called.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember a single instance during my childhood or early\r\nboyhood when our entire family sat down to the table together, and\r\nGod’s blessing was asked, and the family ate a meal in a civilized\r\nmanner. On the plantation in Virginia, and even later, meals were\r\ngotten by the children very much as dumb animals get theirs. It was a\r\npiece of bread here and a scrap of meat there. It was a cup of milk at\r\none time and some potatoes at another. Sometimes a portion of our\r\nfamily would eat out of the skillet or pot, while some one else would\r\neat from a tin plate held on the knees, and often using nothing but the\r\nhands with which to hold the food. When I had grown to sufficient size,\r\nI was required to go to the “big house” at meal-times to fan the flies\r\nfrom the table by means of a large set of paper fans operated by a\r\npulley. Naturally much of the conversation of the white people turned\r\nupon the subject of freedom and the war, and I absorbed a good deal of\r\nit. I remember that at one time I saw two of my young mistresses and\r\nsome lady visitors eating ginger-cakes, in the yard. At that time those\r\ncakes seemed to me to be absolutely the most tempting and desirable\r\nthings that I had ever seen; and I then and there resolved that, if I\r\never got free, the height of my ambition would be reached if I could\r\nget to the point where I could secure and eat ginger-cakes in the way\r\nthat I saw those ladies doing.\r\n\r\nOf course as the war was prolonged the white people, in many cases,\r\noften found it difficult to secure food for themselves. I think the\r\nslaves felt the deprivation less than the whites, because the usual\r\ndiet for slaves was corn bread and pork, and these could be raised on\r\nthe plantation; but coffee, tea, sugar, and other articles which the\r\nwhites had been accustomed to use could not be raised on the\r\nplantation, and the conditions brought about by the war frequently made\r\nit impossible to secure these things. The whites were often in great\r\nstraits. Parched corn was used for coffee, and a kind of black molasses\r\nwas used instead of sugar. Many times nothing was used to sweeten the\r\nso-called tea and coffee.\r\n\r\nThe first pair of shoes that I recall wearing were wooden ones. They\r\nhad rough leather on the top, but the bottoms, which were about an inch\r\nthick, were of wood. When I walked they made a fearful noise, and\r\nbesides this they were very inconvenient, since there was no yielding\r\nto the natural pressure of the foot. In wearing them one presented an\r\nexceedingly awkward appearance. The most trying ordeal that I was\r\nforced to endure as a slave boy, however, was the wearing of a flax\r\nshirt. In the portion of Virginia where I lived it was common to use\r\nflax as part of the clothing for the slaves. That part of the flax from\r\nwhich our clothing was made was largely the refuse, which of course was\r\nthe cheapest and roughest part. I can scarcely imagine any torture,\r\nexcept, perhaps, the pulling of a tooth, that is equal to that caused\r\nby putting on a new flax shirt for the first time. It is almost equal\r\nto the feeling that one would experience if he had a dozen or more\r\nchestnut burrs, or a hundred small pin-points, in contact with his\r\nflesh. Even to this day I can recall accurately the tortures that I\r\nunderwent when putting on one of these garments. The fact that my flesh\r\nwas soft and tender added to the pain. But I had no choice. I had to\r\nwear the flax shirt or none; and had it been left to me to choose, I\r\nshould have chosen to wear no covering. In connection with the flax\r\nshirt, my brother John, who is several years older than I am, performed\r\none of the most generous acts that I ever heard of one slave relative\r\ndoing for another. On several occasions when I was being forced to wear\r\na new flax shirt, he generously agreed to put it on in my stead and\r\nwear it for several days, till it was “broken in.” Until I had grown to\r\nbe quite a youth this single garment was all that I wore.\r\n\r\nOne may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was bitter\r\nfeeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the\r\nfact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which\r\nwould result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was\r\nsuccessful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true,\r\nand it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the\r\nSouth where the Negro was treated with anything like decency. During\r\nthe Civil War one of my young masters was killed, and two were severely\r\nwounded. I recall the feeling of sorrow which existed among the slaves\r\nwhen they heard of the death of “Mars’ Billy.” It was no sham sorrow,\r\nbut real. Some of the slaves had nursed “Mars’ Billy”; others had\r\nplayed with him when he was a child. “Mars’ Billy” had begged for mercy\r\nin the case of others when the overseer or master was thrashing them.\r\nThe sorrow in the slave quarter was only second to that in the “big\r\nhouse.” When the two young masters were brought home wounded, the\r\nsympathy of the slaves was shown in many ways. They were just as\r\nanxious to assist in the nursing as the family relatives of the\r\nwounded. Some of the slaves would even beg for the privilege of sitting\r\nup at night to nurse their wounded masters. This tenderness and\r\nsympathy on the part of those held in bondage was a result of their\r\nkindly and generous nature. In order to defend and protect the women\r\nand children who were left on the plantations when the white males went\r\nto war, the slaves would have laid down their lives. The slave who was\r\nselected to sleep in the “big house” during the absence of the males\r\nwas considered to have the place of honour. Any one attempting to harm\r\n“young Mistress” or “old Mistress” during the night would have had to\r\ncross the dead body of the slave to do so. I do not know how many have\r\nnoticed it, but I think that it will be found to be true that there are\r\nfew instances, either in slavery or freedom, in which a member of my\r\nrace has been known to betray a specific trust.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, not only did the members of my race entertain no feelings of\r\nbitterness against the whites before and during the war, but there are\r\nmany instances of Negroes tenderly caring for their former masters and\r\nmistresses who for some reason have become poor and dependent since the\r\nwar. I know of instances where the former masters of slaves have for\r\nyears been supplied with money by their former slaves to keep them from\r\nsuffering. I have known of still other cases in which the former slaves\r\nhave assisted in the education of the descendants of their former\r\nowners. I know of a case on a large plantation in the South in which a\r\nyoung white man, the son of the former owner of the estate, has become\r\nso reduced in purse and self-control by reason of drink that he is a\r\npitiable creature; and yet, notwithstanding the poverty of the coloured\r\npeople themselves on this plantation, they have for years supplied this\r\nyoung white man with the necessities of life. One sends him a little\r\ncoffee or sugar, another a little meat, and so on. Nothing that the\r\ncoloured people possess is too good for the son of “old Mars’ Tom,” who\r\nwill perhaps never be permitted to suffer while any remain on the place\r\nwho knew directly or indirectly of “old Mars’ Tom.”\r\n\r\nI have said that there are few instances of a member of my race\r\nbetraying a specific trust. One of the best illustrations of this which\r\nI know of is in the case of an ex-slave from Virginia whom I met not\r\nlong ago in a little town in the state of Ohio. I found that this man\r\nhad made a contract with his master, two or three years previous to the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, to the effect that the slave was to be\r\npermitted to buy himself, by paying so much per year for his body; and\r\nwhile he was paying for himself, he was to be permitted to labour where\r\nand for whom he pleased. Finding that he could secure better wages in\r\nOhio, he went there. When freedom came, he was still in debt to his\r\nmaster some three hundred dollars. Notwithstanding that the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation freed him from any obligation to his master,\r\nthis black man walked the greater portion of the distance back to where\r\nhis old master lived in Virginia, and placed the last dollar, with\r\ninterest, in his hands. In talking to me about this, the man told me\r\nthat he knew that he did not have to pay the debt, but that he had\r\ngiven his word to the master, and his word he had never broken. He felt\r\nthat he could not enjoy his freedom till he had fulfilled his promise.\r\n\r\nFrom some things that I have said one may get the idea that some of the\r\nslaves did not want freedom. This is not true. I have never seen one\r\nwho did not want to be free, or one who would return to slavery.\r\n\r\nI pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is\r\nso unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long\r\nsince ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the Southern\r\nwhite people on account of the enslavement of my race. No one section\r\nof our country was wholly responsible for its introduction, and,\r\nbesides, it was recognized and protected for years by the General\r\nGovernment. Having once got its tentacles fastened on to the economic\r\nand social life of the Republic, it was no easy matter for the country\r\nto relieve itself of the institution. Then, when we rid ourselves of\r\nprejudice, or racial feeling, and look facts in the face, we must\r\nacknowledge that, notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of\r\nslavery, the ten million Negroes inhabiting this country, who\r\nthemselves or whose ancestors went through the school of American\r\nslavery, are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially,\r\nintellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal\r\nnumber of black people in any other portion of the globe. This is so to\r\nsuch an extent that Negroes in this country, who themselves or whose\r\nforefathers went through the school of slavery, are constantly\r\nreturning to Africa as missionaries to enlighten those who remained in\r\nthe fatherland. This I say, not to justify slavery—on the other hand, I\r\ncondemn it as an institution, as we all know that in America it was\r\nestablished for selfish and financial reasons, and not from a\r\nmissionary motive—but to call attention to a fact, and to show how\r\nProvidence so often uses men and institutions to accomplish a purpose.\r\nWhen persons ask me in these days how, in the midst of what sometimes\r\nseem hopelessly discouraging conditions, I can have such faith in the\r\nfuture of my race in this country, I remind them of the wilderness\r\nthrough which and out of which, a good Providence has already led us.\r\n\r\nEver since I have been old enough to think for myself, I have\r\nentertained the idea that, notwithstanding the cruel wrongs inflicted\r\nupon us, the black man got nearly as much out of slavery as the white\r\nman did. The hurtful influences of the institution were not by any\r\nmeans confined to the Negro. This was fully illustrated by the life\r\nupon our own plantation. The whole machinery of slavery was so\r\nconstructed as to cause labour, as a rule, to be looked upon as a badge\r\nof degradation, of inferiority. Hence labour was something that both\r\nraces on the slave plantation sought to escape. The slave system on our\r\nplace, in a large measure, took the spirit of self-reliance and\r\nself-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and\r\ngirls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or\r\nspecial line of productive industry. The girls were not taught to cook,\r\nsew, or to take care of the house. All of this was left to the slaves.\r\nThe slaves, of course, had little personal interest in the life of the\r\nplantation, and their ignorance prevented them from learning how to do\r\nthings in the most improved and thorough manner. As a result of the\r\nsystem, fences were out of repair, gates were hanging half off the\r\nhinges, doors creaked, window-panes were out, plastering had fallen but\r\nwas not replaced, weeds grew in the yard. As a rule, there was food for\r\nwhites and blacks, but inside the house, and on the dining-room table,\r\nthere was wanting that delicacy and refinement of touch and finish\r\nwhich can make a home the most convenient, comfortable, and attractive\r\nplace in the world. Withal there was a waste of food and other\r\nmaterials which was sad. When freedom came, the slaves were almost as\r\nwell fitted to begin life anew as the master, except in the matter of\r\nbook-learning and ownership of property. The slave owner and his sons\r\nhad mastered no special industry. They unconsciously had imbibed the\r\nfeeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the\r\nother hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft,\r\nand none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\r\n\r\nFinally the war closed, and the day of freedom came. It was a momentous\r\nand eventful day to all upon our plantation. We had been expecting it.\r\nFreedom was in the air, and had been for months. Deserting soldiers\r\nreturning to their homes were to be seen every day. Others who had been\r\ndischarged, or whose regiments had been paroled, were constantly\r\npassing near our place. The “grape-vine telegraph” was kept busy night\r\nand day. The news and mutterings of great events were swiftly carried\r\nfrom one plantation to another. In the fear of “Yankee” invasions, the\r\nsilverware and other valuables were taken from the “big house,” buried\r\nin the woods, and guarded by trusted slaves. Woe be to any one who\r\nwould have attempted to disturb the buried treasure. The slaves would\r\ngive the Yankee soldiers food, drink, clothing—anything but that which\r\nhad been specifically intrusted to their care and honour. As the great\r\nday drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than\r\nusual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night.\r\nMost of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to\r\nfreedom. True, they had sung those same verses before, but they had\r\nbeen careful to explain that the “freedom” in these songs referred to\r\nthe next world, and had no connection with life in this world. Now they\r\ngradually threw off the mask, and were not afraid to let it be known\r\nthat the “freedom” in their songs meant freedom of the body in this\r\nworld. The night before the eventful day, word was sent to the slave\r\nquarters to the effect that something unusual was going to take place\r\nat the “big house” the next morning. There was little, if any, sleep\r\nthat night. All as excitement and expectancy. Early the next morning\r\nword was sent to all the slaves, old and young, to gather at the house.\r\nIn company with my mother, brother, and sister, and a large number of\r\nother slaves, I went to the master’s house. All of our master’s family\r\nwere either standing or seated on the veranda of the house, where they\r\ncould see what was to take place and hear what was said. There was a\r\nfeeling of deep interest, or perhaps sadness, on their faces, but not\r\nbitterness. As I now recall the impression they made upon me, they did\r\nnot at the moment seem to be sad because of the loss of property, but\r\nrather because of parting with those whom they had reared and who were\r\nin many ways very close to them. The most distinct thing that I now\r\nrecall in connection with the scene was that some man who seemed to be\r\na stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech\r\nand then read a rather long paper—the Emancipation Proclamation, I\r\nthink. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could\r\ngo when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side,\r\nleaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her\r\ncheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day\r\nfor which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would\r\nnever live to see.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes there was great rejoicing, and thanksgiving, and wild\r\nscenes of ecstasy. But there was no feeling of bitterness. In fact,\r\nthere was pity among the slaves for our former owners. The wild\r\nrejoicing on the part of the emancipated coloured people lasted but for\r\na brief period, for I noticed that by the time they returned to their\r\ncabins there was a change in their feelings. The great responsibility\r\nof being free, of having charge of themselves, of having to think and\r\nplan for themselves and their children, seemed to take possession of\r\nthem. It was very much like suddenly turning a youth of ten or twelve\r\nyears out into the world to provide for himself. In a few hours the\r\ngreat questions with which the Anglo-Saxon race had been grappling for\r\ncenturies had been thrown upon these people to be solved. These were\r\nthe questions of a home, a living, the rearing of children, education,\r\ncitizenship, and the establishment and support of churches. Was it any\r\nwonder that within a few hours the wild rejoicing ceased and a feeling\r\nof deep gloom seemed to pervade the slave quarters? To some it seemed\r\nthat, now that they were in actual possession of it, freedom was a more\r\nserious thing than they had expected to find it. Some of the slaves\r\nwere seventy or eighty years old; their best days were gone. They had\r\nno strength with which to earn a living in a strange place and among\r\nstrange people, even if they had been sure where to find a new place of\r\nabode. To this class the problem seemed especially hard. Besides, deep\r\ndown in their hearts there was a strange and peculiar attachment to\r\n“old Marster” and “old Missus,” and to their children, which they found\r\nit hard to think of breaking off. With these they had spent in some\r\ncases nearly a half-century, and it was no light thing to think of\r\nparting. Gradually, one by one, stealthily at first, the older slaves\r\nbegan to wander from the slave quarters back to the “big house” to have\r\na whispered conversation with their former owners as to the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\nBoyhood Days\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the coming of freedom there were two points upon which\r\npractically all the people on our place were agreed, and I found that\r\nthis was generally true throughout the South: that they must change\r\ntheir names, and that they must leave the old plantation for at least a\r\nfew days or weeks in order that they might really feel sure that they\r\nwere free.\r\n\r\nIn some way a feeling got among the coloured people that it was far\r\nfrom proper for them to bear the surname of their former owners, and a\r\ngreat many of them took other surnames. This was one of the first signs\r\nof freedom. When they were slaves, a coloured person was simply called\r\n“John” or “Susan.” There was seldom occasion for more than the use of\r\nthe one name. If “John” or “Susan” belonged to a white man by the name\r\nof “Hatcher,” sometimes he was called “John Hatcher,” or as often\r\n“Hatcher’s John.” But there was a feeling that “John Hatcher” or\r\n“Hatcher’s John” was not the proper title by which to denote a freeman;\r\nand so in many cases “John Hatcher” was changed to “John S. Lincoln” or\r\n“John S. Sherman,” the initial “S” standing for no name, it being\r\nsimply a part of what the coloured man proudly called his “entitles.”\r\n\r\nAs I have stated, most of the coloured people left the old plantation\r\nfor a short while at least, so as to be sure, it seemed, that they\r\ncould leave and try their freedom on to see how it felt. After they had\r\nremained away for a while, many of the older slaves, especially,\r\nreturned to their old homes and made some kind of contract with their\r\nformer owners by which they remained on the estate.\r\n\r\nMy mother’s husband, who was the stepfather of my brother John and\r\nmyself, did not belong to the same owners as did my mother. In fact, he\r\nseldom came to our plantation. I remember seeing him there perhaps once\r\na year, that being about Christmas time. In some way, during the war,\r\nby running away and following the Federal soldiers, it seems, he found\r\nhis way into the new state of West Virginia. As soon as freedom was\r\ndeclared, he sent for my mother to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West\r\nVirginia. At that time a journey from Virginia over the mountains to\r\nWest Virginia was rather a tedious and in some cases a painful\r\nundertaking. What little clothing and few household goods we had were\r\nplaced in a cart, but the children walked the greater portion of the\r\ndistance, which was several hundred miles.\r\n\r\nI do not think any of us ever had been very far from the plantation,\r\nand the taking of a long journey into another state was quite an event.\r\nThe parting from our former owners and the members of our own race on\r\nthe plantation was a serious occasion. From the time of our parting\r\ntill their death we kept up a correspondence with the older members of\r\nthe family, and in later years we have kept in touch with those who\r\nwere the younger members. We were several weeks making the trip, and\r\nmost of the time we slept in the open air and did our cooking over a\r\nlog fire out-of-doors. One night I recall that we camped near an\r\nabandoned log cabin, and my mother decided to build a fire in that for\r\ncooking, and afterward to make a “pallet” on the floor for our\r\nsleeping. Just as the fire had gotten well started a large black snake\r\nfully a yard and a half long dropped down the chimney and ran out on\r\nthe floor. Of course we at once abandoned that cabin. Finally we\r\nreached our destination—a little town called Malden, which is about\r\nfive miles from Charleston, the present capital of the state.\r\n\r\nAt that time salt-mining was the great industry in that part of West\r\nVirginia, and the little town of Malden was right in the midst of the\r\nsalt-furnaces. My stepfather had already secured a job at a\r\nsalt-furnace, and he had also secured a little cabin for us to live in.\r\nOur new house was no better than the one we had left on the old\r\nplantation in Virginia. In fact, in one respect it was worse.\r\nNotwithstanding the poor condition of our plantation cabin, we were at\r\nall times sure of pure air. Our new home was in the midst of a cluster\r\nof cabins crowded closely together, and as there were no sanitary\r\nregulations, the filth about the cabins was often intolerable. Some of\r\nour neighbours were coloured people, and some were the poorest and most\r\nignorant and degraded white people. It was a motley mixture. Drinking,\r\ngambling, quarrels, fights, and shockingly immoral practices were\r\nfrequent. All who lived in the little town were in one way or another\r\nconnected with the salt business. Though I was a mere child, my\r\nstepfather put me and my brother at work in one of the furnaces. Often\r\nI began work as early as four o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I ever learned in the way of book knowledge was while\r\nworking in this salt-furnace. Each salt-packer had his barrels marked\r\nwith a certain number. The number allotted to my stepfather was “18.”\r\nAt the close of the day’s work the boss of the packers would come\r\naround and put “18” on each of our barrels, and I soon learned to\r\nrecognize that figure wherever I saw it, and after a while got to the\r\npoint where I could make that figure, though I knew nothing about any\r\nother figures or letters.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that I can remember having any thoughts about anything, I\r\nrecall that I had an intense longing to learn to read. I determined,\r\nwhen quite a small child, that, if I accomplished nothing else in life,\r\nI would in some way get enough education to enable me to read common\r\nbooks and newspapers. Soon after we got settled in some manner in our\r\nnew cabin in West Virginia, I induced my mother to get hold of a book\r\nfor me. How or where she got it I do not know, but in some way she\r\nprocured an old copy of Webster’s “blue-back” spelling-book, which\r\ncontained the alphabet, followed by such meaningless words as “ab,”\r\n“ba,” “ca,” “da.” I began at once to devour this book, and I think that\r\nit was the first one I ever had in my hands. I had learned from\r\nsomebody that the way to begin to read was to learn the alphabet, so I\r\ntried in all the ways I could think of to learn it,—all of course\r\nwithout a teacher, for I could find no one to teach me. At that time\r\nthere was not a single member of my race anywhere near us who could\r\nread, and I was too timid to approach any of the white people. In some\r\nway, within a few weeks, I mastered the greater portion of the\r\nalphabet. In all my efforts to learn to read my mother shared fully my\r\nambition, and sympathized with me and aided me in every way that she\r\ncould. Though she was totally ignorant, she had high ambitions for her\r\nchildren, and a large fund of good, hard, common sense, which seemed to\r\nenable her to meet and master every situation. If I have done anything\r\nin life worth attention, I feel sure that I inherited the disposition\r\nfrom my mother.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of my struggles and longing for an education, a young\r\ncoloured boy who had learned to read in the state of Ohio came to\r\nMalden. As soon as the coloured people found out that he could read, a\r\nnewspaper was secured, and at the close of nearly every day’s work this\r\nyoung man would be surrounded by a group of men and women who were\r\nanxious to hear him read the news contained in the papers. How I used\r\nto envy this man! He seemed to me to be the one young man in all the\r\nworld who ought to be satisfied with his attainments.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the question of having some kind of a school opened for\r\nthe coloured children in the village began to be discussed by members\r\nof the race. As it would be the first school for Negro children that\r\nhad ever been opened in that part of Virginia, it was, of course, to be\r\na great event, and the discussion excited the wildest interest. The\r\nmost perplexing question was where to find a teacher. The young man\r\nfrom Ohio who had learned to read the papers was considered, but his\r\nage was against him. In the midst of the discussion about a teacher,\r\nanother young coloured man from Ohio, who had been a soldier, in some\r\nway found his way into town. It was soon learned that he possessed\r\nconsiderable education, and he was engaged by the coloured people to\r\nteach their first school. As yet no free schools had been started for\r\ncoloured people in that section, hence each family agreed to pay a\r\ncertain amount per month, with the understanding that the teacher was\r\nto “board ’round”—that is, spend a day with each family. This was not\r\nbad for the teacher, for each family tried to provide the very best on\r\nthe day the teacher was to be its guest. I recall that I looked forward\r\nwith an anxious appetite to the “teacher’s day” at our little cabin.\r\n\r\nThis experience of a whole race beginning to go to school for the first\r\ntime, presents one of the most interesting studies that has ever\r\noccurred in connection with the development of any race. Few people who\r\nwere not right in the midst of the scenes can form any exact idea of\r\nthe intense desire which the people of my race showed for an education.\r\nAs I have stated, it was a whole race trying to go to school. Few were\r\ntoo young, and none too old, to make the attempt to learn. As fast as\r\nany kind of teachers could be secured, not only were day-schools\r\nfilled, but night-schools as well. The great ambition of the older\r\npeople was to try to learn to read the Bible before they died. With\r\nthis end in view men and women who were fifty or seventy-five years old\r\nwould often be found in the night-school. Some day-schools were formed\r\nsoon after freedom, but the principal book studied in the Sunday-school\r\nwas the spelling-book. Day-school, night-school, Sunday-school, were\r\nalways crowded, and often many had to be turned away for want of room.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the school in the Kanawha Valley, however, brought to me\r\none of the keenest disappointments that I ever experienced. I had been\r\nworking in a salt-furnace for several months, and my stepfather had\r\ndiscovered that I had a financial value, and so, when the school\r\nopened, he decided that he could not spare me from my work. This\r\ndecision seemed to cloud my every ambition. The disappointment was made\r\nall the more severe by reason of the fact that my place of work was\r\nwhere I could see the happy children passing to and from school\r\nmornings and afternoons. Despite this disappointment, however, I\r\ndetermined that I would learn something, anyway. I applied myself with\r\ngreater earnestness than ever to the mastering of what was in the\r\n“blue-back” speller.\r\n\r\nMy mother sympathized with me in my disappointment, and sought to\r\ncomfort me in all the ways she could, and to help me find a way to\r\nlearn. After a while I succeeded in making arrangements with the\r\nteacher to give me some lessons at night, after the day’s work was\r\ndone. These night lessons were so welcome that I think I learned more\r\nat night than the other children did during the day. My own experiences\r\nin the night-school gave me faith in the night-school idea, with which,\r\nin after years, I had to do both at Hampton and Tuskegee. But my boyish\r\nheart was still set upon going to the day-school, and I let no\r\nopportunity slip to push my case. Finally I won, and was permitted to\r\ngo to the school in the day for a few months, with the understanding\r\nthat I was to rise early in the morning and work in the furnace till\r\nnine o’clock, and return immediately after school closed in the\r\nafternoon for at least two more hours of work.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse was some distance from the furnace, and as I had to\r\nwork till nine o’clock, and the school opened at nine, I found myself\r\nin a difficulty. School would always be begun before I reached it, and\r\nsometimes my class had recited. To get around this difficulty I yielded\r\nto a temptation for which most people, I suppose, will condemn me; but\r\nsince it is a fact, I might as well state it. I have great faith in the\r\npower and influence of facts. It is seldom that anything is permanently\r\ngained by holding back a fact. There was a large clock in a little\r\noffice in the furnace. This clock, of course, all the hundred or more\r\nworkmen depended upon to regulate their hours of beginning and ending\r\nthe day’s work. I got the idea that the way for me to reach school on\r\ntime was to move the clock hands from half-past eight up to the nine\r\no’clock mark. This I found myself doing morning after morning, till the\r\nfurnace “boss” discovered that something was wrong, and locked the\r\nclock in a case. I did not mean to inconvenience anybody. I simply\r\nmeant to reach that schoolhouse in time.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, I found myself at the school for the first time, I also\r\nfound myself confronted with two other difficulties. In the first\r\nplace, I found that all the other children wore hats or caps on their\r\nheads, and I had neither hat nor cap. In fact, I do not remember that\r\nup to the time of going to school I had ever worn any kind of covering\r\nupon my head, nor do I recall that either I or anybody else had even\r\nthought anything about the need of covering for my head. But, of\r\ncourse, when I saw how all the other boys were dressed, I began to feel\r\nquite uncomfortable. As usual, I put the case before my mother, and she\r\nexplained to me that she had no money with which to buy a “store hat,”\r\nwhich was a rather new institution at that time among the members of my\r\nrace and was considered quite the thing for young and old to own, but\r\nthat she would find a way to help me out of the difficulty. She\r\naccordingly got two pieces of “homespun” (jeans) and sewed them\r\ntogether, and I was soon the proud possessor of my first cap.\r\n\r\nThe lesson that my mother taught me in this has always remained with\r\nme, and I have tried as best as I could to teach it to others. I have\r\nalways felt proud, whenever I think of the incident, that my mother had\r\nstrength of character enough not to be led into the temptation of\r\nseeming to be that which she was not—of trying to impress my\r\nschoolmates and others with the fact that she was able to buy me a\r\n“store hat” when she was not. I have always felt proud that she refused\r\nto go into debt for that which she did not have the money to pay for.\r\nSince that time I have owned many kinds of caps and hats, but never one\r\nof which I have felt so proud as of the cap made of the two pieces of\r\ncloth sewed together by my mother. I have noted the fact, but without\r\nsatisfaction, I need not add, that several of the boys who began their\r\ncareers with “store hats” and who were my schoolmates and used to join\r\nin the sport that was made of me because I had only a “homespun” cap,\r\nhave ended their careers in the penitentiary, while others are not able\r\nnow to buy any kind of hat.\r\n\r\nMy second difficulty was with regard to my name, or rather _A_ name.\r\nFrom the time when I could remember anything, I had been called simply\r\n“Booker.” Before going to school it had never occurred to me that it\r\nwas needful or appropriate to have an additional name. When I heard the\r\nschool-roll called, I noticed that all of the children had at least two\r\nnames, and some of them indulged in what seemed to me the extravagance\r\nof having three. I was in deep perplexity, because I knew that the\r\nteacher would demand of me at least two names, and I had only one. By\r\nthe time the occasion came for the enrolling of my name, an idea\r\noccurred to me which I thought would make me equal to the situation;\r\nand so, when the teacher asked me what my full name was, I calmly told\r\nhim “Booker Washington,” as if I had been called by that name all my\r\nlife; and by that name I have since been known. Later in my life I\r\nfound that my mother had given me the name of “Booker Taliaferro” soon\r\nafter I was born, but in some way that part of my name seemed to\r\ndisappear and for a long while was forgotten, but as soon as I found\r\nout about it I revived it, and made my full name “Booker Taliaferro\r\nWashington.” I think there are not many men in our country who have had\r\nthe privilege of naming themselves in the way that I have.\r\n\r\nMore than once I have tried to picture myself in the position of a boy\r\nor man with an honoured and distinguished ancestry which I could trace\r\nback through a period of hundreds of years, and who had not only\r\ninherited a name, but fortune and a proud family homestead; and yet I\r\nhave sometimes had the feeling that if I had inherited these, and had\r\nbeen a member of a more popular race, I should have been inclined to\r\nyield to the temptation of depending upon my ancestry and my colour to\r\ndo that for me which I should do for myself. Years ago I resolved that\r\nbecause I had no ancestry myself I would leave a record of which my\r\nchildren would be proud, and which might encourage them to still higher\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe world should not pass judgment upon the Negro, and especially the\r\nNegro youth, too quickly or too harshly. The Negro boy has obstacles,\r\ndiscouragements, and temptations to battle with that are little known\r\nto those not situated as he is. When a white boy undertakes a task, it\r\nis taken for granted that he will succeed. On the other hand, people\r\nare usually surprised if the Negro boy does not fail. In a word, the\r\nNegro youth starts out with the presumption against him.\r\n\r\nThe influence of ancestry, however, is important in helping forward any\r\nindividual or race, if too much reliance is not placed upon it. Those\r\nwho constantly direct attention to the Negro youth’s moral weaknesses,\r\nand compare his advancement with that of white youths, do not consider\r\nthe influence of the memories which cling about the old family\r\nhomesteads. I have no idea, as I have stated elsewhere, who my\r\ngrandmother was. I have, or have had, uncles and aunts and cousins, but\r\nI have no knowledge as to where most of them are. My case will\r\nillustrate that of hundreds of thousands of black people in every part\r\nof our country. The very fact that the white boy is conscious that, if\r\nhe fails in life, he will disgrace the whole family record, extending\r\nback through many generations, is of tremendous value in helping him to\r\nresist temptations. The fact that the individual has behind and\r\nsurrounding him proud family history and connection serves as a\r\nstimulus to help him to overcome obstacles when striving for success.\r\n\r\nThe time that I was permitted to attend school during the day was\r\nshort, and my attendance was irregular. It was not long before I had to\r\nstop attending day-school altogether, and devote all of my time again\r\nto work. I resorted to the night-school again. In fact, the greater\r\npart of the education I secured in my boyhood was gathered through the\r\nnight-school after my day’s work was done. I had difficulty often in\r\nsecuring a satisfactory teacher. Sometimes, after I had secured some\r\none to teach me at night, I would find, much to my disappointment, that\r\nthe teacher knew but little more than I did. Often I would have to walk\r\nseveral miles at night in order to recite my night-school lessons.\r\nThere was never a time in my youth, no matter how dark and discouraging\r\nthe days might be, when one resolve did not continually remain with me,\r\nand that was a determination to secure an education at any cost.\r\n\r\nSoon after we moved to West Virginia, my mother adopted into our\r\nfamily, notwithstanding our poverty, an orphan boy, to whom afterward\r\nwe gave the name of James B. Washington. He has ever since remained a\r\nmember of the family.\r\n\r\nAfter I had worked in the salt-furnace for some time, work was secured\r\nfor me in a coal-mine which was operated mainly for the purpose of\r\nsecuring fuel for the salt-furnace. Work in the coal-mine I always\r\ndreaded. One reason for this was that any one who worked in a coal-mine\r\nwas always unclean, at least while at work, and it was a very hard job\r\nto get one’s skin clean after the day’s work was over. Then it was\r\nfully a mile from the opening of the coal-mine to the face of the coal,\r\nand all, of course, was in the blackest darkness. I do not believe that\r\none ever experiences anywhere else such darkness as he does in a\r\ncoal-mine. The mine was divided into a large number of different\r\n“rooms” or departments, and, as I never was able to learn the location\r\nof all these “rooms,” I many times found myself lost in the mine. To\r\nadd to the horror of being lost, sometimes my light would go out, and\r\nthen, if I did not happen to have a match, I would wander about in the\r\ndarkness until by chance I found some one to give me a light. The work\r\nwas not only hard, but it was dangerous. There was always the danger of\r\nbeing blown to pieces by a premature explosion of powder, or of being\r\ncrushed by falling slate. Accidents from one or the other of these\r\ncauses were frequently occurring, and this kept me in constant fear.\r\nMany children of the tenderest years were compelled then, as is now\r\ntrue I fear, in most coal-mining districts, to spend a large part of\r\ntheir lives in these coal-mines, with little opportunity to get an\r\neducation; and, what is worse, I have often noted that, as a rule,\r\nyoung boys who begin life in a coal-mine are often physically and\r\nmentally dwarfed. They soon lose ambition to do anything else than to\r\ncontinue as a coal-miner.\r\n\r\nIn those days, and later as a young man, I used to try to picture in my\r\nimagination the feelings and ambitions of a white boy with absolutely\r\nno limit placed upon his aspirations and activities. I used to envy the\r\nwhite boy who had no obstacles placed in the way of his becoming a\r\nCongressman, Governor, Bishop, or President by reason of the accident\r\nof his birth or race. I used to picture the way that I would act under\r\nsuch circumstances; how I would begin at the bottom and keep rising\r\nuntil I reached the highest round of success.\r\n\r\nIn later years, I confess that I do not envy the white boy as I once\r\ndid. I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the\r\nposition that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has\r\novercome while trying to succeed. Looked at from this standpoint, I\r\nalmost reached the conclusion that often the Negro boy’s birth and\r\nconnection with an unpopular race is an advantage, so far as real life\r\nis concerned. With few exceptions, the Negro youth must work harder and\r\nmust perform his tasks even better than a white youth in order to\r\nsecure recognition. But out of the hard and unusual struggle through\r\nwhich he is compelled to pass, he gets a strength, a confidence, that\r\none misses whose pathway is comparatively smooth by reason of birth and\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nFrom any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the\r\nNegro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of\r\nany other race. I have always been made sad when I have heard members\r\nof any race claiming rights or privileges, or certain badges of\r\ndistinction, on the ground simply that they were members of this or\r\nthat race, regardless of their own individual worth or attainments. I\r\nhave been made to feel sad for such persons because I am conscious of\r\nthe fact that mere connection with what is known as a superior race\r\nwill not permanently carry an individual forward unless he has\r\nindividual worth, and mere connection with what is regarded as an\r\ninferior race will not finally hold an individual back if he possesses\r\nintrinsic, individual merit. Every persecuted individual and race\r\nshould get much consolation out of the great human law, which is\r\nuniversal and eternal, that merit, no matter under what skin found, is,\r\nin the long run, recognized and rewarded. This I have said here, not to\r\ncall attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I\r\nam proud to belong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\nThe Struggle For An Education\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, while at work in the coal-mine, I happened to overhear two\r\nminers talking about a great school for coloured people somewhere in\r\nVirginia. This was the first time that I had ever heard anything about\r\nany kind of school or college that was more pretentious than the little\r\ncoloured school in our town.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the mine I noiselessly crept as close as I could to\r\nthe two men who were talking. I heard one tell the other that not only\r\nwas the school established for the members of any race, but the\r\nopportunities that it provided by which poor but worthy students could\r\nwork out all or a part of the cost of a board, and at the same time be\r\ntaught some trade or industry.\r\n\r\nAs they went on describing the school, it seemed to me that it must be\r\nthe greatest place on earth, and not even Heaven presented more\r\nattractions for me at that time than did the Hampton Normal and\r\nAgricultural Institute in Virginia, about which these men were talking.\r\nI resolved at once to go to that school, although I had no idea where\r\nit was, or how many miles away, or how I was going to reach it; I\r\nremembered only that I was on fire constantly with one ambition, and\r\nthat was to go to Hampton. This thought was with me day and night.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing of the Hampton Institute, I continued to work for a few\r\nmonths longer in the coal-mine. While at work there, I heard of a\r\nvacant position in the household of General Lewis Ruffner, the owner of\r\nthe salt-furnace and coal-mine. Mrs. Viola Ruffner, the wife of General\r\nRuffner, was a “Yankee” woman from Vermont. Mrs. Ruffner had a\r\nreputation all through the vicinity for being very strict with her\r\nservants, and especially with the boys who tried to serve her. Few of\r\nthem remained with her more than two or three weeks. They all left with\r\nthe same excuse: she was too strict. I decided, however, that I would\r\nrather try Mrs. Ruffner’s house than remain in the coal-mine, and so my\r\nmother applied to her for the vacant position. I was hired at a salary\r\nof $5 per month.\r\n\r\nI had heard so much about Mrs. Ruffner’s severity that I was almost\r\nafraid to see her, and trembled when I went into her presence. I had\r\nnot lived with her many weeks, however, before I began to understand\r\nher. I soon began to learn that, first of all, she wanted everything\r\nkept clean about her, that she wanted things done promptly and\r\nsystematically, and that at the bottom of everything she wanted\r\nabsolute honesty and frankness. Nothing must be sloven or slipshod;\r\nevery door, every fence, must be kept in repair.\r\n\r\nI cannot now recall how long I lived with Mrs. Ruffner before going to\r\nHampton, but I think it must have been a year and a half. At any rate,\r\nI here repeat what I have said more than once before, that the lessons\r\nthat I learned in the home of Mrs. Ruffner were as valuable to me as\r\nany education I have ever gotten anywhere else. Even to this day I\r\nnever see bits of paper scattered around a house or in the street that\r\nI do not want to pick them up at once. I never see a filthy yard that I\r\ndo not want to clean it, a paling off of a fence that I do not want to\r\nput it on, an unpainted or unwhitewashed house that I do not want to\r\npaint or whitewash it, or a button off one’s clothes, or a grease-spot\r\non them or on a floor, that I do not want to call attention to it.\r\n\r\nFrom fearing Mrs. Ruffner I soon learned to look upon her as one of my\r\nbest friends. When she found that she could trust me she did so\r\nimplicitly. During the one or two winters that I was with her she gave\r\nme an opportunity to go to school for an hour in the day during a\r\nportion of the winter months, but most of my studying was done at\r\nnight, sometimes alone, sometimes under some one whom I could hire to\r\nteach me. Mrs. Ruffner always encouraged and sympathized with me in all\r\nmy efforts to get an education. It was while living with her that I\r\nbegan to get together my first library. I secured a dry-goods box,\r\nknocked out one side of it, put some shelves in it, and began putting\r\ninto it every kind of book that I could get my hands upon, and called\r\nit my “library.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my success at Mrs. Ruffner’s I did not give up the idea\r\nof going to the Hampton Institute. In the fall of 1872 I determined to\r\nmake an effort to get there, although, as I have stated, I had no\r\ndefinite idea of the direction in which Hampton was, or of what it\r\nwould cost to go there. I do not think that any one thoroughly\r\nsympathized with me in my ambition to go to Hampton unless it was my\r\nmother, and she was troubled with a grave fear that I was starting out\r\non a “wild-goose chase.” At any rate, I got only a half-hearted consent\r\nfrom her that I might start. The small amount of money that I had\r\nearned had been consumed by my stepfather and the remainder of the\r\nfamily, with the exception of a very few dollars, and so I had very\r\nlittle with which to buy clothes and pay my travelling expenses. My\r\nbrother John helped me all that he could, but of course that was not a\r\ngreat deal, for his work was in the coal-mine, where he did not earn\r\nmuch, and most of what he did earn went in the direction of paying the\r\nhousehold expenses.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the thing that touched and pleased me most in connection with\r\nmy starting for Hampton was the interest that many of the older\r\ncoloured people took in the matter. They had spent the best days of\r\ntheir lives in slavery, and hardly expected to live to see the time\r\nwhen they would see a member of their race leave home to attend a\r\nboarding-school. Some of these older people would give me a nickel,\r\nothers a quarter, or a handkerchief.\r\n\r\nFinally the great day came, and I started for Hampton. I had only a\r\nsmall, cheap satchel that contained a few articles of clothing I could\r\nget. My mother at the time was rather weak and broken in health. I\r\nhardly expected to see her again, and thus our parting was all the more\r\nsad. She, however, was very brave through it all. At that time there\r\nwere no through trains connecting that part of West Virginia with\r\neastern Virginia. Trains ran only a portion of the way, and the\r\nremainder of the distance was travelled by stage-coaches.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Malden to Hampton is about five hundred miles. I had\r\nnot been away from home many hours before it began to grow painfully\r\nevident that I did not have enough money to pay my fare to Hampton. One\r\nexperience I shall long remember. I had been travelling over the\r\nmountains most of the afternoon in an old-fashion stage-coach, when,\r\nlate in the evening, the coach stopped for the night at a common,\r\nunpainted house called a hotel. All the other passengers except myself\r\nwere whites. In my ignorance I supposed that the little hotel existed\r\nfor the purpose of accommodating the passengers who travelled on the\r\nstage-coach. The difference that the colour of one’s skin would make I\r\nhad not thought anything about. After all the other passengers had been\r\nshown rooms and were getting ready for supper, I shyly presented myself\r\nbefore the man at the desk. It is true I had practically no money in my\r\npocket with which to pay for bed or food, but I had hoped in some way\r\nto beg my way into the good graces of the landlord, for at that season\r\nin the mountains of Virginia the weather was cold, and I wanted to get\r\nindoors for the night. Without asking as to whether I had any money,\r\nthe man at the desk firmly refused to even consider the matter of\r\nproviding me with food or lodging. This was my first experience in\r\nfinding out what the colour of my skin meant. In some way I managed to\r\nkeep warm by walking about, and so got through the night. My whole soul\r\nwas so bent upon reaching Hampton that I did not have time to cherish\r\nany bitterness toward the hotel-keeper.\r\n\r\nBy walking, begging rides both in wagons and in the cars, in some way,\r\nafter a number of days, I reached the city of Richmond, Virginia, about\r\neighty-two miles from Hampton. When I reached there, tired, hungry, and\r\ndirty, it was late in the night. I had never been in a large city, and\r\nthis rather added to my misery. When I reached Richmond, I was\r\ncompletely out of money. I had not a single acquaintance in the place,\r\nand, being unused to city ways, I did not know where to go. I applied\r\nat several places for lodging, but they all wanted money, and that was\r\nwhat I did not have. Knowing nothing else better to do, I walked the\r\nstreets. In doing this I passed by many food-stands where fried chicken\r\nand half-moon apple pies were piled high and made to present a most\r\ntempting appearance. At that time it seemed to me that I would have\r\npromised all that I expected to possess in the future to have gotten\r\nhold of one of those chicken legs or one of those pies. But I could not\r\nget either of these, nor anything else to eat.\r\n\r\nI must have walked the streets till after midnight. At last I became so\r\nexhausted that I could walk no longer. I was tired, I was hungry, I was\r\neverything but discouraged. Just about the time when I reached extreme\r\nphysical exhaustion, I came upon a portion of a street where the board\r\nsidewalk was considerably elevated. I waited for a few minutes, till I\r\nwas sure that no passers-by could see me, and then crept under the\r\nsidewalk and lay for the night upon the ground, with my satchel of\r\nclothing for a pillow. Nearly all night I could hear the tramp of feet\r\nover my head. The next morning I found myself somewhat refreshed, but I\r\nwas extremely hungry, because it had been a long time since I had had\r\nsufficient food. As soon as it became light enough for me to see my\r\nsurroundings I noticed that I was near a large ship, and that this ship\r\nseemed to be unloading a cargo of pig iron. I went at once to the\r\nvessel and asked the captain to permit me to help unload the vessel in\r\norder to get money for food. The captain, a white man, who seemed to be\r\nkind-hearted, consented. I worked long enough to earn money for my\r\nbreakfast, and it seems to me, as I remember it now, to have been about\r\nthe best breakfast that I have ever eaten.\r\n\r\nMy work pleased the captain so well that he told me if I desired I\r\ncould continue working for a small amount per day. This I was very glad\r\nto do. I continued working on this vessel for a number of days. After\r\nbuying food with the small wages I received there was not much left to\r\nadd on the amount I must get to pay my way to Hampton. In order to\r\neconomize in every way possible, so as to be sure to reach Hampton in a\r\nreasonable time, I continued to sleep under the same sidewalk that gave\r\nme shelter the first night I was in Richmond. Many years after that the\r\ncoloured citizens of Richmond very kindly tendered me a reception at\r\nwhich there must have been two thousand people present. This reception\r\nwas held not far from the spot where I slept the first night I spent in\r\nthe city, and I must confess that my mind was more upon the sidewalk\r\nthat first gave me shelter than upon the recognition, agreeable and\r\ncordial as it was.\r\n\r\nWhen I had saved what I considered enough money with which to reach\r\nHampton, I thanked the captain of the vessel for his kindness, and\r\nstarted again. Without any unusual occurrence I reached Hampton, with a\r\nsurplus of exactly fifty cents with which to begin my education. To me\r\nit had been a long, eventful journey; but the first sight of the large,\r\nthree-story, brick school building seemed to have rewarded me for all\r\nthat I had undergone in order to reach the place. If the people who\r\ngave the money to provide that building could appreciate the influence\r\nthe sight of it had upon me, as well as upon thousands of other youths,\r\nthey would feel all the more encouraged to make such gifts. It seemed\r\nto me to be the largest and most beautiful building I had ever seen.\r\nThe sight of it seemed to give me new life. I felt that a new kind of\r\nexistence had now begun—that life would now have a new meaning. I felt\r\nthat I had reached the promised land, and I resolved to let no obstacle\r\nprevent me from putting forth the highest effort to fit myself to\r\naccomplish the most good in the world.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible after reaching the grounds of the Hampton\r\nInstitute, I presented myself before the head teacher for an assignment\r\nto a class. Having been so long without proper food, a bath, and a\r\nchange of clothing, I did not, of course, make a very favourable\r\nimpression upon her, and I could see at once that there were doubts in\r\nher mind about the wisdom of admitting me as a student. I felt that I\r\ncould hardly blame her if she got the idea that I was a worthless\r\nloafer or tramp. For some time she did not refuse to admit me, neither\r\ndid she decide in my favour, and I continued to linger about her, and\r\nto impress her in all the ways I could with my worthiness. In the\r\nmeantime I saw her admitting other students, and that added greatly to\r\nmy discomfort, for I felt, deep down in my heart, that I could do as\r\nwell as they, if I could only get a chance to show what was in me.\r\n\r\nAfter some hours had passed, the head teacher said to me: “The\r\nadjoining recitation-room needs sweeping. Take the broom and sweep it.”\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me at once that here was my chance. Never did I receive\r\nan order with more delight. I knew that I could sweep, for Mrs. Ruffner\r\nhad thoroughly taught me how to do that when I lived with her.\r\n\r\nI swept the recitation-room three times. Then I got a dusting-cloth and\r\ndusted it four times. All the woodwork around the walls, every bench,\r\ntable, and desk, I went over four times with my dusting-cloth. Besides,\r\nevery piece of furniture had been moved and every closet and corner in\r\nthe room had been thoroughly cleaned. I had the feeling that in a large\r\nmeasure my future depended upon the impression I made upon the teacher\r\nin the cleaning of that room. When I was through, I reported to the\r\nhead teacher. She was a “Yankee” woman who knew just where to look for\r\ndirt. She went into the room and inspected the floor and closets; then\r\nshe took her handkerchief and rubbed it on the woodwork about the\r\nwalls, and over the table and benches. When she was unable to find one\r\nbit of dirt on the floor, or a particle of dust on any of the\r\nfurniture, she quietly remarked, “I guess you will do to enter this\r\ninstitution.”\r\n\r\nI was one of the happiest souls on Earth. The sweeping of that room was\r\nmy college examination, and never did any youth pass an examination for\r\nentrance into Harvard or Yale that gave him more genuine satisfaction.\r\nI have passed several examinations since then, but I have always felt\r\nthat this was the best one I ever passed.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of my own experience in entering the Hampton Institute.\r\nPerhaps few, if any, had anything like the same experience that I had,\r\nbut about the same period there were hundreds who found their way to\r\nHampton and other institutions after experiencing something of the same\r\ndifficulties that I went through. The young men and women were\r\ndetermined to secure an education at any cost.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping of the recitation-room in the manner that I did it seems\r\nto have paved the way for me to get through Hampton. Miss Mary F.\r\nMackie, the head teacher, offered me a position as janitor. This, of\r\ncourse, I gladly accepted, because it was a place where I could work\r\nout nearly all the cost of my board. The work was hard and taxing but I\r\nstuck to it. I had a large number of rooms to care for, and had to work\r\nlate into the night, while at the same time I had to rise by four\r\no’clock in the morning, in order to build the fires and have a little\r\ntime in which to prepare my lessons. In all my career at Hampton, and\r\never since I have been out in the world, Miss Mary F. Mackie, the head\r\nteacher to whom I have referred, proved one of my strongest and most\r\nhelpful friends. Her advice and encouragement were always helpful in\r\nstrengthening to me in the darkest hour.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the impression that was made upon me by the buildings\r\nand general appearance of the Hampton Institute, but I have not spoken\r\nof that which made the greatest and most lasting impression on me, and\r\nthat was a great man—the noblest, rarest human being that it has ever\r\nbeen my privilege to meet. I refer to the late General Samuel C.\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\nIt has been my fortune to meet personally many of what are called great\r\ncharacters, both in Europe and America, but I do not hesitate to say\r\nthat I never met any man who, in my estimation, was the equal of\r\nGeneral Armstrong. Fresh from the degrading influences of the slave\r\nplantation and the coal-mines, it was a rare privilege for me to be\r\npermitted to come into direct contact with such a character as General\r\nArmstrong. I shall always remember that the first time I went into his\r\npresence he made the impression upon me of being a perfect man: I was\r\nmade to feel that there was something about him that was superhuman. It\r\nwas my privilege to know the General personally from the time I entered\r\nHampton till he died, and the more I saw of him the greater he grew in\r\nmy estimation. One might have removed from Hampton all the buildings,\r\nclass-rooms, teachers, and industries, and given the men and women\r\nthere the opportunity of coming into daily contact with General\r\nArmstrong, and that alone would have been a liberal education. The\r\nolder I grow, the more I am convinced that there is no education which\r\none can get from books and costly apparatus that is equal to that which\r\ncan be gotten from contact with great men and women. Instead of\r\nstudying books so constantly, how I wish that our schools and colleges\r\nmight learn to study men and things!\r\n\r\nGeneral Armstrong spent two of the last six months of his life in my\r\nhome at Tuskegee. At that time he was paralyzed to the extent that he\r\nhad lost control of his body and voice in a very large degree.\r\nNotwithstanding his affliction, he worked almost constantly night and\r\nday for the cause to which he had given his life. I never saw a man who\r\nso completely lost sight of himself. I do not believe he ever had a\r\nselfish thought. He was just as happy in trying to assist some other\r\ninstitution in the South as he was when working for Hampton. Although\r\nhe fought the Southern white man in the Civil War, I never heard him\r\nutter a bitter word against him afterward. On the other hand, he was\r\nconstantly seeking to find ways by which he could be of service to the\r\nSouthern whites.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to describe the hold that he had upon the\r\nstudents at Hampton, or the faith they had in him. In fact, he was\r\nworshipped by his students. It never occurred to me that General\r\nArmstrong could fail in anything that he undertook. There is almost no\r\nrequest that he could have made that would not have been complied with.\r\nWhen he was a guest at my home in Alabama, and was so badly paralyzed\r\nthat he had to be wheeled about in an invalid’s chair, I recall that\r\none of the General’s former students had occasion to push his chair up\r\na long, steep hill that taxed his strength to the utmost. When the top\r\nof the hill was reached, the former pupil, with a glow of happiness on\r\nhis face, exclaimed, “I am so glad that I have been permitted to do\r\nsomething that was real hard for the General before he dies!” While I\r\nwas a student at Hampton, the dormitories became so crowded that it was\r\nimpossible to find room for all who wanted to be admitted. In order to\r\nhelp remedy the difficulty, the General conceived the plan of putting\r\nup tents to be used as rooms. As soon as it became known that General\r\nArmstrong would be pleased if some of the older students would live in\r\nthe tents during the winter, nearly every student in school volunteered\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nI was one of the volunteers. The winter that we spent in those tents\r\nwas an intensely cold one, and we suffered severely—how much I am sure\r\nGeneral Armstrong never knew, because we made no complaints. It was\r\nenough for us to know that we were pleasing General Armstrong, and that\r\nwe were making it possible for an additional number of students to\r\nsecure an education. More than once, during a cold night, when a stiff\r\ngale would be blowing, our tent was lifted bodily, and we would find\r\nourselves in the open air. The General would usually pay a visit to the\r\ntents early in the morning, and his earnest, cheerful, encouraging\r\nvoice would dispel any feeling of despondency.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of my admiration for General Armstrong, and yet he was\r\nbut a type of that Christlike body of men and women who went into the\r\nNegro schools at the close of the war by the hundreds to assist in\r\nlifting up my race. The history of the world fails to show a higher,\r\npurer, and more unselfish class of men and women than those who found\r\ntheir way into those Negro schools.\r\n\r\nLife at Hampton was a constant revelation to me; was constantly taking\r\nme into a new world. The matter of having meals at regular hours, of\r\neating on a tablecloth, using a napkin, the use of the bath-tub and of\r\nthe tooth-brush, as well as the use of sheets upon the bed, were all\r\nnew to me.\r\n\r\nI sometimes feel that almost the most valuable lesson I got at the\r\nHampton Institute was in the use and value of the bath. I learned there\r\nfor the first time some of its value, not only in keeping the body\r\nhealthy, but in inspiring self-respect and promoting virtue. In all my\r\ntravels in the South and elsewhere since leaving Hampton I have always\r\nin some way sought my daily bath. To get it sometimes when I have been\r\nthe guest of my own people in a single-roomed cabin has not always been\r\neasy to do, except by slipping away to some stream in the woods. I have\r\nalways tried to teach my people that some provision for bathing should\r\nbe a part of every house.\r\n\r\nFor some time, while a student at Hampton, I possessed but a single\r\npair of socks, but when I had worn these till they became soiled, I\r\nwould wash them at night and hang them by the fire to dry, so that I\r\nmight wear them again the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe charge for my board at Hampton was ten dollars per month. I was\r\nexpected to pay a part of this in cash and to work out the remainder.\r\nTo meet this cash payment, as I have stated, I had just fifty cents\r\nwhen I reached the institution. Aside from a very few dollars that my\r\nbrother John was able to send me once in a while, I had no money with\r\nwhich to pay my board. I was determined from the first to make my work\r\nas janitor so valuable that my services would be indispensable. This I\r\nsucceeded in doing to such an extent that I was soon informed that I\r\nwould be allowed the full cost of my board in return for my work. The\r\ncost of tuition was seventy dollars a year. This, of course, was wholly\r\nbeyond my ability to provide. If I had been compelled to pay the\r\nseventy dollars for tuition, in addition to providing for my board, I\r\nwould have been compelled to leave the Hampton school. General\r\nArmstrong, however, very kindly got Mr. S. Griffitts Morgan, of New\r\nBedford, Mass., to defray the cost of my tuition during the whole time\r\nthat I was at Hampton. After I finished the course at Hampton and had\r\nentered upon my lifework at Tuskegee, I had the pleasure of visiting\r\nMr. Morgan several times.\r\n\r\nAfter having been for a while at Hampton, I found myself in difficulty\r\nbecause I did not have books and clothing. Usually, however, I got\r\naround the trouble about books by borrowing from those who were more\r\nfortunate than myself. As to clothes, when I reached Hampton I had\r\npractically nothing. Everything that I possessed was in a small hand\r\nsatchel. My anxiety about clothing was increased because of the fact\r\nthat General Armstrong made a personal inspection of the young men in\r\nranks, to see that their clothes were clean. Shoes had to be polished,\r\nthere must be no buttons off the clothing, and no grease-spots. To wear\r\none suit of clothes continually, while at work and in the schoolroom,\r\nand at the same time keep it clean, was rather a hard problem for me to\r\nsolve. In some way I managed to get on till the teachers learned that I\r\nwas in earnest and meant to succeed, and then some of them were kind\r\nenough to see that I was partly supplied with second-hand clothing that\r\nhad been sent in barrels from the North. These barrels proved a\r\nblessing to hundreds of poor but deserving students. Without them I\r\nquestion whether I should ever have gotten through Hampton.\r\n\r\nWhen I first went to Hampton I do not recall that I had ever slept in a\r\nbed that had two sheets on it. In those days there were not many\r\nbuildings there, and room was very precious. There were seven other\r\nboys in the same room with me; most of them, however, students who had\r\nbeen there for some time. The sheets were quite a puzzle to me. The\r\nfirst night I slept under both of them, and the second night I slept on\r\ntop of them; but by watching the other boys I learned my lesson in\r\nthis, and have been trying to follow it ever since and to teach it to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nI was among the youngest of the students who were in Hampton at the\r\ntime. Most of the students were men and women—some as old as forty\r\nyears of age. As I now recall the scene of my first year, I do not\r\nbelieve that one often has the opportunity of coming into contact with\r\nthree or four hundred men and women who were so tremendously in earnest\r\nas these men and women were. Every hour was occupied in study or work.\r\nNearly all had had enough actual contact with the world to teach them\r\nthe need of education. Many of the older ones were, of course, too old\r\nto master the text-books very thoroughly, and it was often sad to watch\r\ntheir struggles; but they made up in earnest much of what they lacked\r\nin books. Many of them were as poor as I was, and, besides having to\r\nwrestle with their books, they had to struggle with a poverty which\r\nprevented their having the necessities of life. Many of them had aged\r\nparents who were dependent upon them, and some of them were men who had\r\nwives whose support in some way they had to provide for.\r\n\r\nThe great and prevailing idea that seemed to take possession of every\r\none was to prepare himself to lift up the people at his home. No one\r\nseemed to think of himself. And the officers and teachers, what a rare\r\nset of human beings they were! They worked for the students night and\r\nday, in seasons and out of season. They seemed happy only when they\r\nwere helping the students in some manner. Whenever it is written—and I\r\nhope it will be—the part that the Yankee teachers played in the\r\neducation of the Negroes immediately after the war will make one of the\r\nmost thrilling parts of the history off this country. The time is not\r\nfar distant when the whole South will appreciate this service in a way\r\nthat it has not yet been able to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\nHelping Others\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of my first year at Hampton I was confronted with another\r\ndifficulty. Most of the students went home to spend their vacation. I\r\nhad no money with which to go home, but I had to go somewhere. In those\r\ndays very few students were permitted to remain at the school during\r\nvacation. It made me feel very sad and homesick to see the other\r\nstudents preparing to leave and starting for home. I not only had no\r\nmoney with which to go home, but I had none with which to go anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn some way, however, I had gotten hold of an extra, second-hand coat\r\nwhich I thought was a pretty valuable coat. This I decided to sell, in\r\norder to get a little money for travelling expenses. I had a good deal\r\nof boyish pride, and I tried to hide, as far as I could, from the other\r\nstudents the fact that I had no money and nowhere to go. I made it\r\nknown to a few people in the town of Hampton that I had this coat to\r\nsell, and, after a good deal of persuading, one coloured man promised\r\nto come to my room to look the coat over and consider the matter of\r\nbuying it. This cheered my drooping spirits considerably. Early the\r\nnext morning my prospective customer appeared. After looking the\r\ngarment over carefully, he asked me how much I wanted for it. I told\r\nhim I thought it was worth three dollars. He seemed to agree with me as\r\nto price, but remarked in the most matter-of-fact way: “I tell you what\r\nI will do; I will take the coat, and will pay you five cents, cash\r\ndown, and pay you the rest of the money just as soon as I can get it.”\r\nIt is not hard to imagine what my feelings were at the time.\r\n\r\nWith this disappointment I gave up all hope of getting out of the town\r\nof Hampton for my vacation work. I wanted very much to go where I might\r\nsecure work that would at least pay me enough to purchase some\r\nmuch-needed clothing and other necessities. In a few days practically\r\nall the students and teachers had left for their homes, and this served\r\nto depress my spirits even more.\r\n\r\nAfter trying for several days in and near the town of Hampton, I\r\nfinally secured work in a restaurant at Fortress Monroe. The wages,\r\nhowever, were very little more than my board. At night, and between\r\nmeals, I found considerable time for study and reading; and in this\r\ndirection I improved myself very much during the summer.\r\n\r\nWhen I left school at the end of my first year, I owed the institution\r\nsixteen dollars that I had not been able to work out. It was my\r\ngreatest ambition during the summer to save money enough with which to\r\npay this debt. I felt that this was a debt of honour, and that I could\r\nhardly bring myself to the point of even trying to enter school again\r\ntill it was paid. I economized in every way that I could think of—did\r\nmy own washing, and went without necessary garments—but still I found\r\nmy summer vacation ending and I did not have the sixteen dollars.\r\n\r\nOne day, during the last week of my stay in the restaurant, I found\r\nunder one of the tables a crisp, new ten-dollar bill. I could hardly\r\ncontain myself, I was so happy. As it was not my place of business I\r\nfelt it to be the proper thing to show the money to the proprietor.\r\nThis I did. He seemed as glad as I was, but he coolly explained to me\r\nthat, as it was his place of business, he had a right to keep the\r\nmoney, and he proceeded to do so. This, I confess, was another pretty\r\nhard blow to me. I will not say that I became discouraged, for as I now\r\nlook back over my life I do not recall that I ever became discouraged\r\nover anything that I set out to accomplish. I have begun everything\r\nwith the idea that I could succeed, and I never had much patience with\r\nthe multitudes of people who are always ready to explain why one cannot\r\nsucceed. I determined to face the situation just as it was. At the end\r\nof the week I went to the treasurer of the Hampton Institute, General\r\nJ.F.B. Marshall, and told him frankly my condition. To my gratification\r\nhe told me that I could reenter the institution, and that he would\r\ntrust me to pay the debt when I could. During the second year I\r\ncontinued to work as a janitor.\r\n\r\nThe education that I received at Hampton out of the text-books was but\r\na small part of what I learned there. One of the things that impressed\r\nitself upon me deeply, the second year, was the unselfishness of the\r\nteachers. It was hard for me to understand how any individuals could\r\nbring themselves to the point where they could be so happy in working\r\nfor others. Before the end of the year, I think I began learning that\r\nthose who are happiest are those who do the most for others. This\r\nlesson I have tried to carry with me ever since.\r\n\r\nI also learned a valuable lesson at Hampton by coming into contact with\r\nthe best breeds of live stock and fowls. No student, I think, who has\r\nhad the opportunity of doing this could go out into the world and\r\ncontent himself with the poorest grades.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most valuable thing that I got out of my second year was an\r\nunderstanding of the use and value of the Bible. Miss Nathalie Lord,\r\none of the teachers, from Portland, Me., taught me how to use and love\r\nthe Bible. Before this I had never cared a great deal about it, but now\r\nI learned to love to read the Bible, not only for the spiritual help\r\nwhich it gives, but on account of it as literature. The lessons taught\r\nme in this respect took such a hold upon me that at the present time,\r\nwhen I am at home, no matter how busy I am, I always make it a rule to\r\nread a chapter or a portion of a chapter in the morning, before\r\nbeginning the work of the day.\r\n\r\nWhatever ability I may have as a public speaker I owe in a measure to\r\nMiss Lord. When she found out that I had some inclination in this\r\ndirection, she gave me private lessons in the matter of breathing,\r\nemphasis, and articulation. Simply to be able to talk in public for the\r\nsake of talking has never had the least attraction to me. In fact, I\r\nconsider that there is nothing so empty and unsatisfactory as mere\r\nabstract public speaking; but from my early childhood I have had a\r\ndesire to do something to make the world better, and then to be able to\r\nspeak to the world about that thing.\r\n\r\nThe debating societies at Hampton were a constant source of delight to\r\nme. These were held on Saturday evening; and during my whole life at\r\nHampton I do not recall that I missed a single meeting. I not only\r\nattended the weekly debating society, but was instrumental in\r\norganizing an additional society. I noticed that between the time when\r\nsupper was over and the time to begin evening study there were about\r\ntwenty minutes which the young men usually spent in idle gossip. About\r\ntwenty of us formed a society for the purpose of utilizing this time in\r\ndebate or in practice in public speaking. Few persons ever derived more\r\nhappiness or benefit from the use of twenty minutes of time than we did\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my second year at Hampton, by the help of some money sent\r\nme by my mother and brother John, supplemented by a small gift from one\r\nof the teachers at Hampton, I was enabled to return to my home in\r\nMalden, West Virginia, to spend my vacation. When I reached home I\r\nfound that the salt-furnaces were not running, and that the coal-mine\r\nwas not being operated on account of the miners being out on “strike.”\r\nThis was something which, it seemed, usually occurred whenever the men\r\ngot two or three months ahead in their savings. During the strike, of\r\ncourse, they spent all that they had saved, and would often return to\r\nwork in debt at the same wages, or would move to another mine at\r\nconsiderable expense. In either case, my observations convinced me that\r\nthe miners were worse off at the end of the strike. Before the days of\r\nstrikes in that section of the country, I knew miners who had\r\nconsiderable money in the bank, but as soon as the professional labour\r\nagitators got control, the savings of even the more thrifty ones began\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nMy mother and the other members of my family were, of course, much\r\nrejoiced to see me and to note the improvement that I had made during\r\nmy two years’ absence. The rejoicing on the part of all classes of the\r\ncoloured people, and especially the older ones, over my return, was\r\nalmost pathetic. I had to pay a visit to each family and take a meal\r\nwith each, and at each place tell the story of my experiences at\r\nHampton. In addition to this I had to speak before the church and\r\nSunday-school, and at various other places. The thing that I was most\r\nin search of, though, work, I could not find. There was no work on\r\naccount of the strike. I spent nearly the whole of the first month of\r\nmy vacation in an effort to find something to do by which I could earn\r\nmoney to pay my way back to Hampton and save a little money to use\r\nafter reaching there.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the first month, I went to a place a considerable\r\ndistance from my home, to try to find employment. I did not succeed,\r\nand it was night before I got started on my return. When I had gotten\r\nwithin a mile or so of my home I was so completely tired out that I\r\ncould not walk any farther, and I went into an old, abandoned house to\r\nspend the remainder of the night. About three o’clock in the morning my\r\nbrother John found me asleep in this house, and broke to me, as gently\r\nas he could, the sad news that our dear mother had died during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to me the saddest and blankest moment in my life. For\r\nseveral years my mother had not been in good health, but I had no idea,\r\nwhen I parted from her the previous day, that I should never see her\r\nalive again. Besides that, I had always had an intense desire to be\r\nwith her when she did pass away. One of the chief ambitions which\r\nspurred me on at Hampton was that I might be able to get to be in a\r\nposition in which I could better make my mother comfortable and happy.\r\nShe had so often expressed the wish that she might be permitted to live\r\nto see her children educated and started out in the world.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time after the death of my mother our little home was\r\nin confusion. My sister Amanda, although she tried to do the best she\r\ncould, was too young to know anything about keeping house, and my\r\nstepfather was not able to hire a housekeeper. Sometimes we had food\r\ncooked for us, and sometimes we did not. I remember that more than once\r\na can of tomatoes and some crackers constituted a meal. Our clothing\r\nwent uncared for, and everything about our home was soon in a\r\ntumble-down condition. It seems to me that this was the most dismal\r\nperiod of my life.\r\n\r\nMy good friend, Mrs. Ruffner, to whom I have already referred, always\r\nmade me welcome at her home, and assisted me in many ways during this\r\ntrying period. Before the end of the vacation she gave me some work,\r\nand this, together with work in a coal-mine at some distance from my\r\nhome, enabled me to earn a little money.\r\n\r\nAt one time it looked as if I would have to give up the idea of\r\nreturning to Hampton, but my heart was so set on returning that I\r\ndetermined not to give up going back without a struggle. I was very\r\nanxious to secure some clothes for the winter, but in this I was\r\ndisappointed, except for a few garments which my brother John secured\r\nfor me. Notwithstanding my need of money and clothing, I was very happy\r\nin the fact that I had secured enough money to pay my travelling\r\nexpenses back to Hampton. Once there, I knew that I could make myself\r\nso useful as a janitor that I could in some way get through the school\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThree weeks before the time for the opening of the term at Hampton, I\r\nwas pleasantly surprised to receive a letter from my good friend Miss\r\nMary F. Mackie, the lady principal, asking me to return to Hampton two\r\nweeks before the opening of the school, in order that I might assist\r\nher in cleaning the buildings and getting things in order for the new\r\nschool year. This was just the opportunity I wanted. It gave me a\r\nchance to secure a credit in the treasurer’s office. I started for\r\nHampton at once.\r\n\r\nDuring these two weeks I was taught a lesson which I shall never\r\nforget. Miss Mackie was a member of one of the oldest and most cultured\r\nfamilies of the North, and yet for two weeks she worked by my side\r\ncleaning windows, dusting rooms, putting beds in order, and what not.\r\nShe felt that things would not be in condition for the opening of\r\nschool unless every window-pane was perfectly clean, and she took the\r\ngreatest satisfaction in helping to clean them herself. The work which\r\nI have described she did every year that I was at Hampton.\r\n\r\nIt was hard for me at this time to understand how a woman of her\r\neducation and social standing could take such delight in performing\r\nsuch service, in order to assist in the elevation of an unfortunate\r\nrace. Ever since then I have had no patience with any school for my\r\nrace in the South which did not teach its students the dignity of\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nDuring my last year at Hampton every minute of my time that was not\r\noccupied with my duties as janitor was devoted to hard study. I was\r\ndetermined, if possible, to make such a record in my class as would\r\ncause me to be placed on the “honour roll” of Commencement speakers.\r\nThis I was successful in doing. It was June of 1875 when I finished the\r\nregular course of study at Hampton. The greatest benefits that I got\r\nout of my my life at the Hampton Institute, perhaps, may be classified\r\nunder two heads:—\r\n\r\nFirst was contact with a great man, General S.C. Armstrong, who, I\r\nrepeat, was, in my opinion, the rarest, strongest, and most beautiful\r\ncharacter that it has ever been my privilege to meet.\r\n\r\nSecond, at Hampton, for the first time, I learned what education was\r\nexpected to do for an individual. Before going there I had a good deal\r\nof the then rather prevalent idea among our people that to secure an\r\neducation meant to have a good, easy time, free from all necessity for\r\nmanual labour. At Hampton I not only learned that it was not a disgrace\r\nto labour, but learned to love labour, not alone for its financial\r\nvalue, but for labour’s own sake and for the independence and\r\nself-reliance which the ability to do something which the world wants\r\ndone brings. At that institution I got my first taste of what it meant\r\nto live a life of unselfishness, my first knowledge of the fact that\r\nthe happiest individuals are those who do the most to make others\r\nuseful and happy.\r\n\r\nI was completely out of money when I graduated. In company with other\r\nHampton students, I secured a place as a table waiter in a summer hotel\r\nin Connecticut, and managed to borrow enough money with which to get\r\nthere. I had not been in this hotel long before I found out that I knew\r\npractically nothing about waiting on a hotel table. The head waiter,\r\nhowever, supposed that I was an accomplished waiter. He soon gave me\r\ncharge of the table at which there sat four or five wealthy and rather\r\naristocratic people. My ignorance of how to wait upon them was so\r\napparent that they scolded me in such a severe manner that I became\r\nfrightened and left their table, leaving them sitting there without\r\nfood. As a result of this I was reduced from the position of waiter to\r\nthat of a dish-carrier.\r\n\r\nBut I determined to learn the business of waiting, and did so within a\r\nfew weeks and was restored to my former position. I have had the\r\nsatisfaction of being a guest in this hotel several times since I was a\r\nwaiter there.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the hotel season I returned to my former home in\r\nMalden, and was elected to teach the coloured school at that place.\r\nThis was the beginning of one of the happiest periods of my life. I now\r\nfelt that I had the opportunity to help the people of my home town to a\r\nhigher life. I felt from the first that mere book education was not all\r\nthat the young people of that town needed. I began my work at eight\r\no’clock in the morning, and, as a rule, it did not end until ten\r\no’clock at night. In addition to the usual routine of teaching, I\r\ntaught the pupils to comb their hair, and to keep their hands and faces\r\nclean, as well as their clothing. I gave special attention to teaching\r\nthem the proper use of the tooth-brush and the bath. In all my teaching\r\nI have watched carefully the influence of the tooth-brush, and I am\r\nconvinced that there are few single agencies of civilization that are\r\nmore far-reaching.\r\n\r\nThere were so many of the older boys and girls in the town, as well as\r\nmen and women, who had to work in the daytime and still were craving an\r\nopportunity for an education, that I soon opened a night-school. From\r\nthe first, this was crowded every night, being about as large as the\r\nschool that I taught in the day. The efforts of some of the men and\r\nwomen, who in many cases were over fifty years of age, to learn, were\r\nin some cases very pathetic.\r\n\r\nMy day and night school work was not all that I undertook. I\r\nestablished a small reading-room and a debating society. On Sundays I\r\ntaught two Sunday-schools, one in the town of Malden in the afternoon,\r\nand the other in the morning at a place three miles distant from\r\nMalden. In addition to this, I gave private lessons to several young\r\nmen whom I was fitting to send to the Hampton Institute. Without regard\r\nto pay and with little thought of it, I taught any one who wanted to\r\nlearn anything that I could teach him. I was supremely happy in the\r\nopportunity of being able to assist somebody else. I did receive,\r\nhowever, a small salary from the public fund, for my work as a\r\npublic-school teacher.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that I was a student at Hampton my older brother, John,\r\nnot only assisted me all that he could, but worked all of the time in\r\nthe coal-mines in order to support the family. He willingly neglected\r\nhis own education that he might help me. It was my earnest wish to help\r\nhim to prepare to enter Hampton, and to save money to assist him in his\r\nexpenses there. Both of these objects I was successful in\r\naccomplishing. In three years my brother finished the course at\r\nHampton, and he is now holding the important position of Superintendent\r\nof Industries at Tuskegee. When he returned from Hampton, we both\r\ncombined our efforts and savings to send our adopted brother, James,\r\nthrough the Hampton Institute. This we succeeded in doing, and he is\r\nnow the postmaster at the Tuskegee Institute. The year 1877, which was\r\nmy second year of teaching in Malden, I spent very much as I did the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nIt was while my home was at Malden that what was known as the “Ku Klux\r\nKlan” was in the height of its activity. The “Ku Klux” were bands of\r\nmen who had joined themselves together for the purpose of regulating\r\nthe conduct of the coloured people, especially with the object of\r\npreventing the members of the race from exercising any influence in\r\npolitics. They corresponded somewhat to the “patrollers” of whom I used\r\nto hear a great deal during the days of slavery, when I was a small\r\nboy. The “patrollers” were bands of white men—usually young men—who\r\nwere organized largely for the purpose of regulating the conduct of the\r\nslaves at night in such matters as preventing the slaves from going\r\nfrom one plantation to another without passes, and for preventing them\r\nfrom holding any kind of meetings without permission and without the\r\npresence at these meetings of at least one white man.\r\n\r\nLike the “patrollers” the “Ku Klux” operated almost wholly at night.\r\nThey were, however, more cruel than the “patrollers.” Their objects, in\r\nthe main, were to crush out the political aspirations of the Negroes,\r\nbut they did not confine themselves to this, because schoolhouses as\r\nwell as churches were burned by them, and many innocent persons were\r\nmade to suffer. During this period not a few coloured people lost their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, the acts of these lawless bands made a great impression\r\nupon me. I saw one open battle take place at Malden between some of the\r\ncoloured and white people. There must have been not far from a hundred\r\npersons engaged on each side; many on both sides were seriously\r\ninjured, among them General Lewis Ruffner, the husband of my friend\r\nMrs. Viola Ruffner. General Ruffner tried to defend the coloured\r\npeople, and for this he was knocked down and so seriously wounded that\r\nhe never completely recovered. It seemed to me as I watched this\r\nstruggle between members of the two races, that there was no hope for\r\nour people in this country. The “Ku Klux” period was, I think, the\r\ndarkest part of the Reconstruction days.\r\n\r\nI have referred to this unpleasant part of the history of the South\r\nsimply for the purpose of calling attention to the great change that\r\nhas taken place since the days of the “Ku Klux.” To-day there are no\r\nsuch organizations in the South, and the fact that such ever existed is\r\nalmost forgotten by both races. There are few places in the South now\r\nwhere public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\nThe Reconstruction Period\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years from 1867 to 1878 I think may be called the period of\r\nReconstruction. This included the time that I spent as a student at\r\nHampton and as a teacher in West Virginia. During the whole of the\r\nReconstruction period two ideas were constantly agitating in the minds\r\nof the coloured people, or, at least, in the minds of a large part of\r\nthe race. One of these was the craze for Greek and Latin learning, and\r\nthe other was a desire to hold office.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been expected that a people who had spent generations\r\nin slavery, and before that generations in the darkest heathenism,\r\ncould at first form any proper conception of what an education meant.\r\nIn every part of the South, during the Reconstruction period, schools,\r\nboth day and night, were filled to overflowing with people of all ages\r\nand conditions, some being as far along in age as sixty and seventy\r\nyears. The ambition to secure an education was most praiseworthy and\r\nencouraging. The idea, however, was too prevalent that, as soon as one\r\nsecured a little education, in some unexplainable way he would be free\r\nfrom most of the hardships of the world, and, at any rate, could live\r\nwithout manual labour. There was a further feeling that a knowledge,\r\nhowever little, of the Greek and Latin languages would make one a very\r\nsuperior human being, something bordering almost on the supernatural. I\r\nremember that the first coloured man whom I saw who knew something\r\nabout foreign languages impressed me at the time as being a man of all\r\nothers to be envied.\r\n\r\nNaturally, most of our people who received some little education became\r\nteachers or preachers. While among those two classes there were many\r\ncapable, earnest, godly men and women, still a large proportion took up\r\nteaching or preaching as an easy way to make a living. Many became\r\nteachers who could do little more than write their names. I remember\r\nthere came into our neighbourhood one of this class, who was in search\r\nof a school to teach, and the question arose while he was there as to\r\nthe shape of the earth and how he could teach the children concerning\r\nthe subject. He explained his position in the matter by saying that he\r\nwas prepared to teach that the earth was either flat or round,\r\naccording to the preference of a majority of his patrons.\r\n\r\nThe ministry was the profession that suffered most—and still suffers,\r\nthough there has been great improvement—on account of not only ignorant\r\nbut in many cases immoral men who claimed that they were “called to\r\npreach.” In the earlier days of freedom almost every coloured man who\r\nlearned to read would receive “a call to preach” within a few days\r\nafter he began reading. At my home in West Virginia the process of\r\nbeing called to the ministry was a very interesting one. Usually the\r\n“call” came when the individual was sitting in church. Without warning\r\nthe one called would fall upon the floor as if struck by a bullet, and\r\nwould lie there for hours, speechless and motionless. Then the news\r\nwould spread all through the neighborhood that this individual had\r\nreceived a “call.” If he were inclined to resist the summons, he would\r\nfall or be made to fall a second or third time. In the end he always\r\nyielded to the call. While I wanted an education badly, I confess that\r\nin my youth I had a fear that when I had learned to read and write very\r\nwell I would receive one of these “calls”; but, for some reason, my\r\ncall never came.\r\n\r\nWhen we add the number of wholly ignorant men who preached or\r\n“exhorted” to that of those who possessed something of an education, it\r\ncan be seen at a glance that the supply of ministers was large. In\r\nfact, some time ago I knew a certain church that had a total membership\r\nof about two hundred, and eighteen of that number were ministers. But,\r\nI repeat, in many communities in the South the character of the\r\nministry is being improved, and I believe that within the next two or\r\nthree decades a very large proportion of the unworthy ones will have\r\ndisappeared. The “calls” to preach, I am glad to say, are not nearly so\r\nnumerous now as they were formerly, and the calls to some industrial\r\noccupation are growing more numerous. The improvement that has taken\r\nplace in the character of the teachers is even more marked than in the\r\ncase of the ministers.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the Reconstruction period our people throughout the\r\nSouth looked to the Federal Government for everything, very much as a\r\nchild looks to its mother. This was not unnatural. The central\r\ngovernment gave them freedom, and the whole Nation had been enriched\r\nfor more than two centuries by the labour of the Negro. Even as a\r\nyouth, and later in manhood, I had the feeling that it was cruelly\r\nwrong in the central government, at the beginning of our freedom, to\r\nfail to make some provision for the general education of our people in\r\naddition to what the states might do, so that the people would be the\r\nbetter prepared for the duties of citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to find fault, to remark what might have been done, and\r\nperhaps, after all, and under all the circumstances, those in charge of\r\nthe conduct of affairs did the only thing that could be done at the\r\ntime. Still, as I look back now over the entire period of our freedom,\r\nI cannot help feeling that it would have been wiser if some plan could\r\nhave been put in operation which would have made the possession of a\r\ncertain amount of education or property, or both, a test for the\r\nexercise of the franchise, and a way provided by which this test should\r\nbe made to apply honestly and squarely to both the white and black\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nThough I was but little more than a youth during the period of\r\nReconstruction, I had the feeling that mistakes were being made, and\r\nthat things could not remain in the condition that they were in then\r\nvery long. I felt that the Reconstruction policy, so far as it related\r\nto my race, was in a large measure on a false foundation, was\r\nartificial and forced. In many cases it seemed to me that the ignorance\r\nof my race was being used as a tool with which to help white men into\r\noffice, and that there was an element in the North which wanted to\r\npunish the Southern white men by forcing the Negro into positions over\r\nthe heads of the Southern whites. I felt that the Negro would be the\r\none to suffer for this in the end. Besides, the general political\r\nagitation drew the attention of our people away from the more\r\nfundamental matters of perfecting themselves in the industries at their\r\ndoors and in securing property.\r\n\r\nThe temptations to enter political life were so alluring that I came\r\nvery near yielding to them at one time, but I was kept from doing so by\r\nthe feeling that I would be helping in a more substantial way by\r\nassisting in the laying of the foundation of the race through a\r\ngenerous education of the hand, head, and heart. I saw coloured men who\r\nwere members of the state legislatures, and county officers, who, in\r\nsome cases, could not read or write, and whose morals were as weak as\r\ntheir education. Not long ago, when passing through the streets of a\r\ncertain city in the South, I heard some brick-masons calling out, from\r\nthe top of a two-story brick building on which they were working, for\r\nthe “Governor” to “hurry up and bring up some more bricks.” Several\r\ntimes I heard the command, “Hurry up, Governor!” “Hurry up, Governor!”\r\nMy curiosity was aroused to such an extent that I made inquiry as to\r\nwho the “Governor” was, and soon found that he was a coloured man who\r\nat one time had held the position of Lieutenant-Governor of his state.\r\n\r\nBut not all the coloured people who were in office during\r\nReconstruction were unworthy of their positions, by any means. Some of\r\nthem, like the late Senator B.K. Bruce, Governor Pinchback, and many\r\nothers, were strong, upright, useful men. Neither were all the class\r\ndesignated as carpetbaggers dishonourable men. Some of them, like\r\nex-Governor Bullock, of Georgia, were men of high character and\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nOf course the coloured people, so largely without education, and wholly\r\nwithout experience in government, made tremendous mistakes, just as\r\nmany people similarly situated would have done. Many of the Southern\r\nwhites have a feeling that, if the Negro is permitted to exercise his\r\npolitical rights now to any degree, the mistakes of the Reconstruction\r\nperiod will repeat themselves. I do not think this would be true,\r\nbecause the Negro is a much stronger and wiser man than he was\r\nthirty-five years ago, and he is fast learning the lesson that he\r\ncannot afford to act in a manner that will alienate his Southern white\r\nneighbours from him. More and more I am convinced that the final\r\nsolution of the political end of our race problem will be for each\r\nstate that finds it necessary to change the law bearing upon the\r\nfranchise to make the law apply with absolute honesty, and without\r\nopportunity for double dealing or evasion, to both races alike. Any\r\nother course my daily observation in the South convinces me, will be\r\nunjust to the Negro, unjust to the white man, and unfair to the rest of\r\nthe state in the Union, and will be, like slavery, a sin that at some\r\ntime we shall have to pay for.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1878, after having taught school in Malden for two\r\nyears, and after I had succeeded in preparing several of the young men\r\nand women, besides my two brothers, to enter the Hampton Institute, I\r\ndecided to spend some months in study at Washington, D.C. I remained\r\nthere for eight months. I derived a great deal of benefit from the\r\nstudies which I pursued, and I came into contact with some strong men\r\nand women. At the institution I attended there was no industrial\r\ntraining given to the students, and I had an opportunity of comparing\r\nthe influence of an institution with no industrial training with that\r\nof one like the Hampton Institute, that emphasizes the industries. At\r\nthis school I found the students, in most cases, had more money, were\r\nbetter dressed, wore the latest style of all manner of clothing, and in\r\nsome cases were more brilliant mentally. At Hampton it was a standing\r\nrule that, while the institution would be responsible for securing some\r\none to pay the tuition for the students, the men and women themselves\r\nmust provide for their own board, books, clothing, and room wholly by\r\nwork, or partly by work and partly in cash. At the institution at which\r\nI now was, I found that a large portion of the students by some means\r\nhad their personal expenses paid for them. At Hampton the student was\r\nconstantly making the effort through the industries to help himself,\r\nand that very effort was of immense value in character-building. The\r\nstudents at the other school seemed to be less self-dependent. They\r\nseemed to give more attention to mere outward appearances. In a word,\r\nthey did not appear to me to be beginning at the bottom, on a real,\r\nsolid foundation, to the extent that they were at Hampton. They knew\r\nmore about Latin and Greek when they left school, but they seemed to\r\nknow less about life and its conditions as they would meet it at their\r\nhomes. Having lived for a number of years in the midst of comfortable\r\nsurroundings, they were not as much inclined as the Hampton students to\r\ngo into the country districts of the South, where there was little of\r\ncomfort, to take up work for our people, and they were more inclined to\r\nyield to the temptation to become hotel waiters and Pullman-car porters\r\nas their life-work.\r\n\r\nDuring the time I was a student at Washington the city was crowded with\r\ncoloured people, many of whom had recently come from the South. A large\r\nproportion of these people had been drawn to Washington because they\r\nfelt that they could lead a life of ease there. Others had secured\r\nminor government positions, and still another large class was there in\r\nthe hope of securing Federal positions. A number of coloured men—some\r\nof them very strong and brilliant—were in the House of Representatives\r\nat that time, and one, the Hon. B.K. Bruce, was in the Senate. All this\r\ntended to make Washington an attractive place for members of the\r\ncoloured race. Then, too, they knew that at all times they could have\r\nthe protection of the law in the District of Columbia. The public\r\nschools in Washington for coloured people were better then than they\r\nwere elsewhere. I took great interest in studying the life of our\r\npeople there closely at that time. I found that while among them there\r\nwas a large element of substantial, worthy citizens, there was also a\r\nsuperficiality about the life of a large class that greatly alarmed me.\r\nI saw young coloured men who were not earning more than four dollars a\r\nweek spend two dollars or more for a buggy on Sunday to ride up and\r\ndown Pennsylvania Avenue in, in order that they might try to convince\r\nthe world that they were worth thousands. I saw other young men who\r\nreceived seventy-five or one hundred dollars per month from the\r\nGovernment, who were in debt at the end of every month. I saw men who\r\nbut a few months previous were members of Congress, then without\r\nemployment and in poverty. Among a large class there seemed to be a\r\ndependence upon the Government for every conceivable thing. The members\r\nof this class had little ambition to create a position for themselves,\r\nbut wanted the Federal officials to create one for them. How many times\r\nI wished then, and have often wished since, that by some power of magic\r\nI might remove the great bulk of these people into the county districts\r\nand plant them upon the soil, upon the solid and never deceptive\r\nfoundation of Mother Nature, where all nations and races that have ever\r\nsucceeded have gotten their start,—a start that at first may be slow\r\nand toilsome, but one that nevertheless is real.\r\n\r\nIn Washington I saw girls whose mothers were earning their living by\r\nlaundrying. These girls were taught by their mothers, in rather a crude\r\nway it is true, the industry of laundrying. Later, these girls entered\r\nthe public schools and remained there perhaps six or eight years. When\r\nthe public school course was finally finished, they wanted more costly\r\ndresses, more costly hats and shoes. In a word, while their wants have\r\nbeen increased, their ability to supply their wants had not been\r\nincreased in the same degree. On the other hand, their six or eight\r\nyears of book education had weaned them away from the occupation of\r\ntheir mothers. The result of this was in too many cases that the girls\r\nwent to the bad. I often thought how much wiser it would have been to\r\ngive these girls the same amount of maternal training—and I favour any\r\nkind of training, whether in the languages or mathematics, that gives\r\nstrength and culture to the mind—but at the same time to give them the\r\nmost thorough training in the latest and best methods of laundrying and\r\nother kindred occupations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\nBlack Race And Red Race\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year that I spent in Washington, and for some little time\r\nbefore this, there had been considerable agitation in the state of West\r\nVirginia over the question of moving the capital of the state from\r\nWheeling to some other central point. As a result of this, the\r\nLegislature designated three cities to be voted upon by the citizens of\r\nthe state as the permanent seat of government. Among these cities was\r\nCharleston, only five miles from Malden, my home. At the close of my\r\nschool year in Washington I was very pleasantly surprised to receive,\r\nfrom a committee of three white people in Charleston, an invitation to\r\ncanvass the state in the interests of that city. This invitation I\r\naccepted, and spent nearly three months in speaking in various parts of\r\nthe state. Charleston was successful in winning the prize, and is now\r\nthe permanent seat of government.\r\n\r\nThe reputation that I made as a speaker during this campaign induced a\r\nnumber of persons to make an earnest effort to get me to enter\r\npolitical life, but I refused, still believing that I could find other\r\nservice which would prove of more permanent value to my race. Even then\r\nI had a strong feeling that what our people most needed was to get a\r\nfoundation in education, industry, and property, and for this I felt\r\nthat they could better afford to strive than for political preferment.\r\nAs for my individual self, it appeared to me to be reasonably certain\r\nthat I could succeed in political life, but I had a feeling that it\r\nwould be a rather selfish kind of success—individual success at the\r\ncost of failing to do my duty in assisting in laying a foundation for\r\nthe masses.\r\n\r\nAt this period in the progress of our race a very large proportion of\r\nthe young men who went to school or to college did so with the\r\nexpressed determination to prepare themselves to be great lawyers, or\r\nCongressmen, and many of the women planned to become music teachers;\r\nbut I had a reasonably fixed idea, even at that early period in my\r\nlife, that there was a need for something to be done to prepare the way\r\nfor successful lawyers, Congressmen, and music teachers.\r\n\r\nI felt that the conditions were a good deal like those of an old\r\ncoloured man, during the days of slavery, who wanted to learn how to\r\nplay on the guitar. In his desire to take guitar lessons he applied to\r\none of his young masters to teach him, but the young man, not having\r\nmuch faith in the ability of the slave to master the guitar at his age,\r\nsought to discourage him by telling him: “Uncle Jake, I will give you\r\nguitar lessons; but, Jake, I will have to charge you three dollars for\r\nthe first lesson, two dollars for the second lesson, and one dollar for\r\nthe third lesson. But I will charge you only twenty-five cents for the\r\nlast lesson.”\r\n\r\nUncle Jake answered: “All right, boss, I hires you on dem terms. But,\r\nboss! I wants yer to be sure an’ give me dat las’ lesson first.”\r\n\r\nSoon after my work in connection with the removal of the capital was\r\nfinished, I received an invitation which gave me great joy and which at\r\nthe same time was a very pleasant surprise. This was a letter from\r\nGeneral Armstrong, inviting me to return to Hampton at the next\r\nCommencement to deliver what was called the “post-graduate address.”\r\nThis was an honour which I had not dreamed of receiving. With much care\r\nI prepared the best address that I was capable of. I chose for my\r\nsubject “The Force That Wins.”\r\n\r\nAs I returned to Hampton for the purpose of delivering this address, I\r\nwent over much of the same ground—now, however, covered entirely by\r\nrailroad—that I had traversed nearly six years before, when I first\r\nsought entrance into Hampton Institute as a student. Now I was able to\r\nride the whole distance in the train. I was constantly contrasting this\r\nwith my first journey to Hampton. I think I may say, without seeming\r\negotism, that it is seldom that five years have wrought such a change\r\nin the life and aspirations of an individual.\r\n\r\nAt Hampton I received a warm welcome from teachers and students. I\r\nfound that during my absence from Hampton the institute each year had\r\nbeen getting closer to the real needs and conditions of our people;\r\nthat the industrial teaching, as well as that of the academic\r\ndepartment, had greatly improved. The plan of the school was not\r\nmodelled after that of any other institution then in existence, but\r\nevery improvement was made under the magnificent leadership of General\r\nArmstrong solely with the view of meeting and helping the needs of our\r\npeople as they presented themselves at the time. Too often, it seems to\r\nme, in missionary and educational work among underdeveloped races,\r\npeople yield to the temptation of doing that which was done a hundred\r\nyears before, or is being done in other communities a thousand miles\r\naway. The temptation often is to run each individual through a certain\r\neducational mould, regardless of the condition of the subject or the\r\nend to be accomplished. This was not so at Hampton Institute.\r\n\r\nThe address which I delivered on Commencement Day seems to have pleased\r\nevery one, and many kind and encouraging words were spoken to me\r\nregarding it. Soon after my return to my home in West Virginia, where I\r\nhad planned to continue teaching, I was again surprised to receive a\r\nletter from General Armstrong, asking me to return to Hampton partly as\r\na teacher and partly to pursue some supplementary studies. This was in\r\nthe summer of 1879. Soon after I began my first teaching in West\r\nVirginia I had picked out four of the brightest and most promising of\r\nmy pupils, in addition to my two brothers, to whom I have already\r\nreferred, and had given them special attention, with the view of having\r\nthem go to Hampton. They had gone there, and in each case the teachers\r\nhad found them so well prepared that they entered advanced classes.\r\nThis fact, it seems, led to my being called back to Hampton as a\r\nteacher. One of the young men that I sent to Hampton in this way is now\r\nDr. Samuel E. Courtney, a successful physician in Boston, and a member\r\nof the School Board of that city.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the experiment was being tried for the first time, by\r\nGeneral Armstrong, of educating Indians at Hampton. Few people then had\r\nany confidence in the ability of the Indians to receive education and\r\nto profit by it. General Armstrong was anxious to try the experiment\r\nsystematically on a large scale. He secured from the reservations in\r\nthe Western states over one hundred wild and for the most part\r\nperfectly ignorant Indians, the greater proportion of whom were young\r\nmen. The special work which the General desired me to do was to be a\r\nsort of “house father” to the Indian young men—that is, I was to live\r\nin the building with them and have the charge of their discipline,\r\nclothing, rooms, and so on. This was a very tempting offer, but I had\r\nbecome so much absorbed in my work in West Virginia that I dreaded to\r\ngive it up. However, I tore myself away from it. I did not know how to\r\nrefuse to perform any service that General Armstrong desired of me.\r\n\r\nOn going to Hampton, I took up my residence in a building with about\r\nseventy-five Indian youths. I was the only person in the building who\r\nwas not a member of their race. At first I had a good deal of doubt\r\nabout my ability to succeed. I knew that the average Indian felt\r\nhimself above the white man, and, of course, he felt himself far above\r\nthe Negro, largely on account of the fact of the Negro having submitted\r\nto slavery—a thing which the Indian would never do. The Indians, in the\r\nIndian Territory, owned a large number of slaves during the days of\r\nslavery. Aside from this, there was a general feeling that the attempt\r\nto educate and civilize the red men at Hampton would be a failure. All\r\nthis made me proceed very cautiously, for I felt keenly the great\r\nresponsibility. But I was determined to succeed. It was not long before\r\nI had the complete confidence of the Indians, and not only this, but I\r\nthink I am safe in saying that I had their love and respect. I found\r\nthat they were about like any other human beings; that they responded\r\nto kind treatment and resented ill-treatment. They were continually\r\nplanning to do something that would add to my happiness and comfort.\r\nThe things that they disliked most, I think, were to have their long\r\nhair cut, to give up wearing their blankets, and to cease smoking; but\r\nno white American ever thinks that any other race is wholly civilized\r\nuntil he wears the white man’s clothes, eats the white man’s food,\r\nspeaks the white man’s language, and professes the white man’s\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nWhen the difficulty of learning the English language was subtracted, I\r\nfound that in the matter of learning trades and in mastering academic\r\nstudies there was little difference between the coloured and Indian\r\nstudents. It was a constant delight to me to note the interest which\r\nthe coloured students took in trying to help the Indians in every way\r\npossible. There were a few of the coloured students who felt that the\r\nIndians ought not to be admitted to Hampton, but these were in the\r\nminority. Whenever they were asked to do so, the Negro students gladly\r\ntook the Indians as room-mates, in order that they might teach them to\r\nspeak English and to acquire civilized habits.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered if there was a white institution in this country\r\nwhose students would have welcomed the incoming of more than a hundred\r\ncompanions of another race in the cordial way that these black students\r\nat Hampton welcomed the red ones. How often I have wanted to say to\r\nwhite students that they lift themselves up in proportion as they help\r\nto lift others, and the more unfortunate the race, and the lower in the\r\nscale of civilization, the more does one raise one’s self by giving the\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a conversation which I once had with the Hon.\r\nFrederick Douglass. At one time Mr. Douglass was travelling in the\r\nstate of Pennsylvania, and was forced, on account of his colour, to\r\nride in the baggage-car, in spite of the fact that he had paid the same\r\nprice for his passage that the other passengers had paid. When some of\r\nthe white passengers went into the baggage-car to console Mr. Douglass,\r\nand one of them said to him: “I am sorry, Mr. Douglass, that you have\r\nbeen degraded in this manner,” Mr. Douglass straightened himself up on\r\nthe box upon which he was sitting, and replied: “They cannot degrade\r\nFrederick Douglass. The soul that is within me no man can degrade. I am\r\nnot the one that is being degraded on account of this treatment, but\r\nthose who are inflicting it upon me.”\r\n\r\nIn one part of the country, where the law demands the separation of the\r\nraces on the railroad trains, I saw at one time a rather amusing\r\ninstance which showed how difficult it sometimes is to know where the\r\nblack begins and the white ends.\r\n\r\nThere was a man who was well known in his community as a Negro, but who\r\nwas so white that even an expert would have hard work to classify him\r\nas a black man. This man was riding in the part of the train set aside\r\nfor the coloured passengers. When the train conductor reached him, he\r\nshowed at once that he was perplexed. If the man was a Negro, the\r\nconductor did not want to send him to the white people’s coach; at the\r\nsame time, if he was a white man, the conductor did not want to insult\r\nhim by asking him if he was a Negro. The official looked him over\r\ncarefully, examining his hair, eyes, nose, and hands, but still seemed\r\npuzzled. Finally, to solve the difficulty, he stooped over and peeped\r\nat the man’s feet. When I saw the conductor examining the feet of the\r\nman in question, I said to myself, “That will settle it;” and so it\r\ndid, for the trainman promptly decided that the passenger was a Negro,\r\nand let him remain where he was. I congratulated myself that my race\r\nwas fortunate in not losing one of its members.\r\n\r\nMy experience has been that the time to test a true gentleman is to\r\nobserve him when he is in contact with individuals of a race that is\r\nless fortunate than his own. This is illustrated in no better way than\r\nby observing the conduct of the old-school type of Southern gentleman\r\nwhen he is in contact with his former slaves or their descendants.\r\n\r\nAn example of what I mean is shown in a story told of George\r\nWashington, who, meeting a coloured man in the road once, who politely\r\nlifted his hat, lifted his own in return. Some of his white friends who\r\nsaw the incident criticised Washington for his action. In reply to\r\ntheir criticism George Washington said: “Do you suppose that I am going\r\nto permit a poor, ignorant, coloured man to be more polite than I am?”\r\n\r\nWhile I was in charge of the Indian boys at Hampton, I had one or two\r\nexperiences which illustrate the curious workings of caste in America.\r\nOne of the Indian boys was taken ill, and it became my duty to take him\r\nto Washington, deliver him over to the Secretary of the Interior, and\r\nget a receipt for him, in order that he might be returned to his\r\nWestern reservation. At that time I was rather ignorant of the ways of\r\nthe world. During my journey to Washington, on a steamboat, when the\r\nbell rang for dinner, I was careful to wait and not enter the dining\r\nroom until after the greater part of the passengers had finished their\r\nmeal. Then, with my charge, I went to the dining saloon. The man in\r\ncharge politely informed me that the Indian could be served, but that I\r\ncould not. I never could understand how he knew just where to draw the\r\ncolour line, since the Indian and I were of about the same complexion.\r\nThe steward, however, seemed to be an expert in this manner. I had been\r\ndirected by the authorities at Hampton to stop at a certain hotel in\r\nWashington with my charge, but when I went to this hotel the clerk\r\nstated that he would be glad to receive the Indian into the house, but\r\nsaid that he could not accommodate me.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of something of this same feeling came under my\r\nobservation afterward. I happened to find myself in a town in which so\r\nmuch excitement and indignation were being expressed that it seemed\r\nlikely for a time that there would be a lynching. The occasion of the\r\ntrouble was that a dark-skinned man had stopped at the local hotel.\r\nInvestigation, however, developed the fact that this individual was a\r\ncitizen of Morocco, and that while travelling in this country he spoke\r\nthe English language. As soon as it was learned that he was not an\r\nAmerican Negro, all the signs of indignation disappeared. The man who\r\nwas the innocent cause of the excitement, though, found it prudent\r\nafter that not to speak English.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my first year with the Indians there came another opening\r\nfor me at Hampton, which, as I look back over my life now, seems to\r\nhave come providentially, to help to prepare me for my work at Tuskegee\r\nlater. General Armstrong had found out that there was quite a number of\r\nyoung coloured men and women who were intensely in earnest in wishing\r\nto get an education, but who were prevented from entering Hampton\r\nInstitute because they were too poor to be able to pay any portion of\r\nthe cost of their board, or even to supply themselves with books. He\r\nconceived the idea of starting a night-school in connection with the\r\nInstitute, into which a limited number of the most promising of these\r\nyoung men and women would be received, on condition that they were to\r\nwork for ten hours during the day, and attend school for two hours at\r\nnight. They were to be paid something above the cost of their board for\r\ntheir work. The greater part of their earnings was to be reserved in\r\nthe school’s treasury as a fund to be drawn on to pay their board when\r\nthey had become students in the day-school, after they had spent one or\r\ntwo years in the night-school. In this way they would obtain a start in\r\ntheir books and a knowledge of some trade or industry, in addition to\r\nthe other far-reaching benefits of the institution.\r\n\r\nGeneral Armstrong asked me to take charge of the night-school, and I\r\ndid so. At the beginning of this school there were about twelve strong,\r\nearnest men and women who entered the class. During the day the greater\r\npart of the young men worked in the school’s sawmill, and the young\r\nwomen worked in the laundry. The work was not easy in either place, but\r\nin all my teaching I never taught pupils who gave me much genuine\r\nsatisfaction as these did. They were good students, and mastered their\r\nwork thoroughly. They were so much in earnest that only the ringing of\r\nthe retiring-bell would make them stop studying, and often they would\r\nurge me to continue the lessons after the usual hour for going to bed\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nThese students showed so much earnestness, both in their hard work\r\nduring the day, as well as in their application to their studies at\r\nnight, that I gave them the name of “The Plucky Class”—a name which\r\nsoon grew popular and spread throughout the institution. After a\r\nstudent had been in the night-school long enough to prove what was in\r\nhim, I gave him a printed certificate which read something like this:—\r\n\r\n“This is to certify that James Smith is a member of The Plucky Class of\r\nthe Hampton Institute, and is in good and regular standing.”\r\n\r\nThe students prized these certificates highly, and they added greatly\r\nto the popularity of the night-school. Within a few weeks this\r\ndepartment had grown to such an extent that there were about\r\ntwenty-five students in attendance. I have followed the course of many\r\nof these twenty-five men and women ever since then, and they are now\r\nholding important and useful positions in nearly every part of the\r\nSouth. The night-school at Hampton, which started with only twelve\r\nstudents, now numbers between three and four hundred, and is one of the\r\npermanent and most important features of the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\nEarly Days At Tuskegee\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the time that I had charge of the Indians and the night-school\r\nat Hampton, I pursued some studies myself, under the direction of the\r\ninstructors there. One of these instructors was the Rev. Dr. H.B.\r\nFrissell, the present Principal of the Hampton Institute, General\r\nArmstrong’s successor.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1881, near the close of my first year in teaching the\r\nnight-school, in a way that I had not dared expect, the opportunity\r\nopened for me to begin my life-work. One night in the chapel, after the\r\nusual chapel exercises were over, General Armstrong referred to the\r\nfact that he had received a letter from some gentlemen in Alabama\r\nasking him to recommend some one to take charge of what was to be a\r\nnormal school for the coloured people in the little town of Tuskegee in\r\nthat state. These gentlemen seemed to take it for granted that no\r\ncoloured man suitable for the position could be secured, and they were\r\nexpecting the General to recommend a white man for the place. The next\r\nday General Armstrong sent for me to come to his office, and, much to\r\nmy surprise, asked me if I thought I could fill the position in\r\nAlabama. I told him that I would be willing to try. Accordingly, he\r\nwrote to the people who had applied to him for the information, that he\r\ndid not know of any white man to suggest, but if they would be willing\r\nto take a coloured man, he had one whom he could recommend. In this\r\nletter he gave them my name.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed before anything more was heard about the matter.\r\nSome time afterward, one Sunday evening during the chapel exercises, a\r\nmessenger came in and handed the general a telegram. At the end of the\r\nexercises he read the telegram to the school. In substance, these were\r\nits words: “Booker T. Washington will suit us. Send him at once.”\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of joy expressed among the students and\r\nteachers, and I received very hearty congratulations. I began to get\r\nready at once to go to Tuskegee. I went by way of my old home in West\r\nVirginia, where I remained for several days, after which I proceeded to\r\nTuskegee. I found Tuskegee to be a town of about two thousand\r\ninhabitants, nearly one-half of whom were coloured. It was in what was\r\nknown as the Black Belt of the South. In the county in which Tuskegee\r\nis situated the coloured people outnumbered the whites by about three\r\nto one. In some of the adjoining and near-by counties the proportion\r\nwas not far from six coloured persons to one white.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked to define the term “Black Belt.” So far as I\r\ncan learn, the term was first used to designate a part of the country\r\nwhich was distinguished by the colour of the soil. The part of the\r\ncountry possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of\r\ncourse, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable,\r\nand consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers. Later,\r\nand especially since the war, the term seems to be used wholly in a\r\npolitical sense—that is, to designate the counties where the black\r\npeople outnumber the white.\r\n\r\nBefore going to Tuskegee I had expected to find there a building and\r\nall the necessary apparatus ready for me to begin teaching. To my\r\ndisappointment, I found nothing of the kind. I did find, though, that\r\nwhich no costly building and apparatus can supply,—hundreds of hungry,\r\nearnest souls who wanted to secure knowledge.\r\n\r\nTuskegee seemed an ideal place for the school. It was in the midst of\r\nthe great bulk of the Negro population, and was rather secluded, being\r\nfive miles from the main line of railroad, with which it was connected\r\nby a short line. During the days of slavery, and since, the town had\r\nbeen a centre for the education of the white people. This was an added\r\nadvantage, for the reason that I found the white people possessing a\r\ndegree of culture and education that is not surpassed by many\r\nlocalities. While the coloured people were ignorant, they had not, as a\r\nrule, degraded and weakened their bodies by vices such as are common to\r\nthe lower class of people in the large cities. In general, I found the\r\nrelations between the two races pleasant. For example, the largest, and\r\nI think at that time the only hardware store in the town was owned and\r\noperated jointly by a coloured man and a white man. This copartnership\r\ncontinued until the death of the white partner.\r\n\r\nI found that about a year previous to my going to Tuskegee some of the\r\ncoloured people who had heard something of the work of education being\r\ndone at Hampton had applied to the state Legislature, through their\r\nrepresentatives, for a small appropriation to be used in starting a\r\nnormal school in Tuskegee. This request the Legislature had complied\r\nwith to the extent of granting an annual appropriation of two thousand\r\ndollars. I soon learned, however, that this money could be used only\r\nfor the payment of the salaries of the instructors, and that there was\r\nno provision for securing land, buildings, or apparatus. The task\r\nbefore me did not seem a very encouraging one. It seemed much like\r\nmaking bricks without straw. The coloured people were overjoyed, and\r\nwere constantly offering their services in any way in which they could\r\nbe of assistance in getting the school started.\r\n\r\nMy first task was to find a place in which to open the school. After\r\nlooking the town over with some care, the most suitable place that\r\ncould be secured seemed to be a rather dilapidated shanty near the\r\ncoloured Methodist church, together with the church itself as a sort of\r\nassembly-room. Both the church and the shanty were in about as bad\r\ncondition as was possible. I recall that during the first months of\r\nschool that I taught in this building it was in such poor repair that,\r\nwhenever it rained, one of the older students would very kindly leave\r\nhis lessons and hold an umbrella over me while I heard the recitations\r\nof the others. I remember, also, that on more than one occasion my\r\nlandlady held an umbrella over me while I ate breakfast.\r\n\r\nAt the time I went to Alabama the coloured people were taking\r\nconsiderable interest in politics, and they were very anxious that I\r\nshould become one of them politically, in every respect. They seemed to\r\nhave a little distrust of strangers in this regard. I recall that one\r\nman, who seemed to have been designated by the others to look after my\r\npolitical destiny, came to me on several occasions and said, with a\r\ngood deal of earnestness: “We wants you to be sure to vote jes’ like we\r\nvotes. We can’t read de newspapers very much, but we knows how to vote,\r\nan’ we wants you to vote jes’ like we votes.” He added: “We watches de\r\nwhite man, and we keeps watching de white man till we finds out which\r\nway de white man’s gwine to vote; an’ when we finds out which way de\r\nwhite man’s gwine to vote, den we votes ’xactly de other way. Den we\r\nknows we’s right.”\r\n\r\nI am glad to add, however, that at the present time the disposition to\r\nvote against the white man merely because he is white is largely\r\ndisappearing, and the race is learning to vote from principle, for what\r\nthe voter considers to be for the best interests of both races.\r\n\r\nI reached Tuskegee, as I have said, early in June, 1881. The first\r\nmonth I spent in finding accommodations for the school, and in\r\ntravelling through Alabama, examining into the actual life of the\r\npeople, especially in the court districts, and in getting the school\r\nadvertised among the class of people that I wanted to have attend it.\r\nThe most of my travelling was done over the country roads, with a mule\r\nand a cart or a mule and a buggy wagon for conveyance. I ate and slept\r\nwith the people, in their little cabins. I saw their farms, their\r\nschools, their churches. Since, in the case of the most of these\r\nvisits, there had been no notice given in advance that a stranger was\r\nexpected, I had the advantage of seeing the real, everyday life of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the plantation districts I found that, as a rule, the whole family\r\nslept in one room, and that in addition to the immediate family there\r\nsometimes were relatives, or others not related to the family, who\r\nslept in the same room. On more than one occasion I went outside the\r\nhouse to get ready for bed, or to wait until the family had gone to\r\nbed. They usually contrived some kind of a place for me to sleep,\r\neither on the floor or in a special part of another’s bed. Rarely was\r\nthere any place provided in the cabin where one could bathe even the\r\nface and hands, but usually some provision was made for this outside\r\nthe house, in the yard.\r\n\r\nThe common diet of the people was fat pork and corn bread. At times I\r\nhave eaten in cabins where they had only corn bread and “black-eye\r\npeas” cooked in plain water. The people seemed to have no other idea\r\nthan to live on this fat meat and corn bread,—the meat, and the meal of\r\nwhich the bread was made, having been bought at a high price at a store\r\nin town, notwithstanding the fact that the land all about the cabin\r\nhomes could easily have been made to produce nearly every kind of\r\ngarden vegetable that is raised anywhere in the country. Their one\r\nobject seemed to be to plant nothing but cotton; and in many cases\r\ncotton was planted up to the very door of the cabin.\r\n\r\nIn these cabin homes I often found sewing-machines which had been\r\nbought, or were being bought, on instalments, frequently at a cost of\r\nas much as sixty dollars, or showy clocks for which the occupants of\r\nthe cabins had paid twelve or fourteen dollars. I remember that on one\r\noccasion when I went into one of these cabins for dinner, when I sat\r\ndown to the table for a meal with the four members of the family, I\r\nnoticed that, while there were five of us at the table, there was but\r\none fork for the five of us to use. Naturally there was an awkward\r\npause on my part. In the opposite corner of that same cabin was an\r\norgan for which the people told me they were paying sixty dollars in\r\nmonthly instalments. One fork, and a sixty-dollar organ!\r\n\r\nIn most cases the sewing-machine was not used, the clocks were so\r\nworthless that they did not keep correct time—and if they had, in nine\r\ncases out of ten there would have been no one in the family who could\r\nhave told the time of day—while the organ, of course, was rarely used\r\nfor want of a person who could play upon it.\r\n\r\nIn the case to which I have referred, where the family sat down to the\r\ntable for the meal at which I was their guest, I could see plainly that\r\nthis was an awkward and unusual proceeding, and was done in my honour.\r\nIn most cases, when the family got up in the morning, for example, the\r\nwife would put a piece of meat in a frying-pan and put a lump of dough\r\nin a “skillet,” as they called it. These utensils would be placed on\r\nthe fire, and in ten or fifteen minutes breakfast would be ready.\r\nFrequently the husband would take his bread and meat in his hand and\r\nstart for the field, eating as he walked. The mother would sit down in\r\na corner and eat her breakfast, perhaps from a plate and perhaps\r\ndirectly from the “skillet” or frying-pan, while the children would eat\r\ntheir portion of the bread and meat while running about the yard. At\r\ncertain seasons of the year, when meat was scarce, it was rarely that\r\nthe children who were not old enough or strong enough to work in the\r\nfields would have the luxury of meat.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast over, and with practically no attention given to the\r\nhouse, the whole family would, as a general thing, proceed to the\r\ncotton-field. Every child that was large enough to carry a hoe was put\r\nto work, and the baby—for usually there was at least one baby—would be\r\nlaid down at the end of the cotton row, so that its mother could give\r\nit a certain amount of attention when she had finished chopping her\r\nrow. The noon meal and the supper were taken in much the same way as\r\nthe breakfast.\r\n\r\nAll the days of the family would be spent after much this same routine,\r\nexcept Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday the whole family would spent at\r\nleast half a day, and often a whole day, in town. The idea in going to\r\ntown was, I suppose, to do shopping, but all the shopping that the\r\nwhole family had money for could have been attended to in ten minutes\r\nby one person. Still, the whole family remained in town for most of the\r\nday, spending the greater part of the time in standing on the streets,\r\nthe women, too often, sitting about somewhere smoking or dipping snuff.\r\nSunday was usually spent in going to some big meeting. With few\r\nexceptions, I found that the crops were mortgaged in the counties where\r\nI went, and that the most of the coloured farmers were in debt. The\r\nstate had not been able to build schoolhouses in the country districts,\r\nand, as a rule, the schools were taught in churches or in log cabins.\r\nMore than once, while on my journeys, I found that there was no\r\nprovision made in the house used for school purposes for heating the\r\nbuilding during the winter, and consequently a fire had to be built in\r\nthe yard, and teacher and pupils passed in and out of the house as they\r\ngot cold or warm. With few exceptions, I found the teachers in these\r\ncountry schools to be miserably poor in preparation for their work, and\r\npoor in moral character. The schools were in session from three to five\r\nmonths. There was practically no apparatus in the schoolhouses, except\r\nthat occasionally there was a rough blackboard. I recall that one day I\r\nwent into a schoolhouse—or rather into an abandoned log cabin that was\r\nbeing used as a schoolhouse—and found five pupils who were studying a\r\nlesson from one book. Two of these, on the front seat, were using the\r\nbook between them; behind these were two others peeping over the\r\nshoulders of the first two, and behind the four was a fifth little\r\nfellow who was peeping over the shoulders of all four.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said concerning the character of the schoolhouses and\r\nteachers will also apply quite accurately as a description of the\r\nchurch buildings and the ministers.\r\n\r\nI met some very interesting characters during my travels. As\r\nillustrating the peculiar mental processes of the country people, I\r\nremember that I asked one coloured man, who was about sixty years old,\r\nto tell me something of his history. He said that he had been born in\r\nVirginia, and sold into Alabama in 1845. I asked him how many were sold\r\nat the same time. He said, “There were five of us; myself and brother\r\nand three mules.”\r\n\r\nIn giving all these descriptions of what I saw during my month of\r\ntravel in the country around Tuskegee, I wish my readers to keep in\r\nmind the fact that there were many encouraging exceptions to the\r\nconditions which I have described. I have stated in such plain words\r\nwhat I saw, mainly for the reason that later I want to emphasize the\r\nencouraging changes that have taken place in the community, not wholly\r\nby the work of the Tuskegee school, but by that of other institutions\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\nTeaching School In A Stable And A Hen-House\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess that what I saw during my month of travel and investigation\r\nleft me with a very heavy heart. The work to be done in order to lift\r\nthese people up seemed almost beyond accomplishing. I was only one\r\nperson, and it seemed to me that the little effort which I could put\r\nforth could go such a short distance toward bringing about results. I\r\nwondered if I could accomplish anything, and if it were worth while for\r\nme to try.\r\n\r\nOf one thing I felt more strongly convinced than ever, after spending\r\nthis month in seeing the actual life of the coloured people, and that\r\nwas that, in order to lift them up, something must be done more than\r\nmerely to imitate New England education as it then existed. I saw more\r\nclearly than ever the wisdom of the system which General Armstrong had\r\ninaugurated at Hampton. To take the children of such people as I had\r\nbeen among for a month, and each day give them a few hours of mere book\r\neducation, I felt would be almost a waste of time.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation with the citizens of Tuskegee, I set July 4, 1881,\r\nas the day for the opening of the school in the little shanty and\r\nchurch which had been secured for its accommodation. The white people,\r\nas well as the coloured, were greatly interested in the starting of the\r\nnew school, and the opening day was looked forward to with much earnest\r\ndiscussion. There were not a few white people in the vicinity of\r\nTuskegee who looked with some disfavour upon the project. They\r\nquestioned its value to the coloured people, and had a fear that it\r\nmight result in bringing about trouble between the races. Some had the\r\nfeeling that in proportion as the Negro received education, in the same\r\nproportion would his value decrease as an economic factor in the state.\r\nThese people feared the result of education would be that the Negroes\r\nwould leave the farms, and that it would be difficult to secure them\r\nfor domestic service.\r\n\r\nThe white people who questioned the wisdom of starting this new school\r\nhad in their minds pictures of what was called an educated Negro, with\r\na high hat, imitation gold eye-glasses, a showy walking-stick, kid\r\ngloves, fancy boots, and what not—in a word, a man who was determined\r\nto live by his wits. It was difficult for these people to see how\r\neducation would produce any other kind of a coloured man.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all the difficulties which I encountered in getting the\r\nlittle school started, and since then through a period of nineteen\r\nyears, there are two men among all the many friends of the school in\r\nTuskegee upon whom I have depended constantly for advice and guidance;\r\nand the success of the undertaking is largely due to these men, from\r\nwhom I have never sought anything in vain. I mention them simply as\r\ntypes. One is a white man and an ex-slaveholder, Mr. George W.\r\nCampbell; the other is a black man and an ex-slave, Mr. Lewis Adams.\r\nThese were the men who wrote to General Armstrong for a teacher.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell is a merchant and banker, and had had little experience in\r\ndealing with matters pertaining to education. Mr. Adams was a mechanic,\r\nand had learned the trades of shoemaking, harness-making, and\r\ntinsmithing during the days of slavery. He had never been to school a\r\nday in his life, but in some way he had learned to read and write while\r\na slave. From the first, these two men saw clearly what my plan of\r\neducation was, sympathized with me, and supported me in every effort.\r\nIn the days which were darkest financially for the school, Mr. Campbell\r\nwas never appealed to when he was not willing to extend all the aid in\r\nhis power. I do not know two men, one an ex-slaveholder, one an\r\nex-slave, whose advice and judgment I would feel more like following in\r\neverything which concerns the life and development of the school at\r\nTuskegee than those of these two men.\r\n\r\nI have always felt that Mr. Adams, in a large degree, derived his\r\nunusual power of mind from the training given his hands in the process\r\nof mastering well three trades during the days of slavery. If one goes\r\nto-day into any Southern town, and asks for the leading and most\r\nreliable coloured man in the community, I believe that in five cases\r\nout of ten he will be directed to a Negro who learned a trade during\r\nthe days of slavery.\r\n\r\nOn the morning that the school opened, thirty students reported for\r\nadmission. I was the only teacher. The students were about equally\r\ndivided between the sexes. Most of them lived in Macon County, the\r\ncounty in which Tuskegee is situated, and of which it is the\r\ncounty-seat. A great many more students wanted to enter the school, but\r\nit had been decided to receive only those who were above fifteen years\r\nof age, and who had previously received some education. The greater\r\npart of the thirty were public-school teachers, and some of them were\r\nnearly forty years of age. With the teachers came some of their former\r\npupils, and when they were examined it was amusing to note that in\r\nseveral cases the pupil entered a higher class than did his former\r\nteacher. It was also interesting to note how many big books some of\r\nthem had studied, and how many high-sounding subjects some of them\r\nclaimed to have mastered. The bigger the book and the longer the name\r\nof the subject, the prouder they felt of their accomplishment. Some had\r\nstudied Latin, and one or two Greek. This they thought entitled them to\r\nspecial distinction.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the saddest things I saw during the month of travel\r\nwhich I have described was a young man, who had attended some high\r\nschool, sitting down in a one-room cabin, with grease on his clothing,\r\nfilth all around him, and weeds in the yard and garden, engaged in\r\nstudying a French grammar.\r\n\r\nThe students who came first seemed to be fond of memorizing long and\r\ncomplicated “rules” in grammar and mathematics, but had little thought\r\nor knowledge of applying these rules to their everyday affairs of their\r\nlife. One subject which they liked to talk about, and tell me that they\r\nhad mastered, in arithmetic, was “banking and discount,” but I soon\r\nfound out that neither they nor almost any one in the neighbourhood in\r\nwhich they had lived had ever had a bank account. In registering the\r\nnames of the students, I found that almost every one of them had one or\r\nmore middle initials. When I asked what the “J” stood for, in the name\r\nof John J. Jones, it was explained to me that this was a part of his\r\n“entitles.” Most of the students wanted to get an education because\r\nthey thought it would enable them to earn more money as\r\nschool-teachers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding what I have said about them in these respects, I have\r\nnever seen a more earnest and willing company of young men and women\r\nthan these students were. They were all willing to learn the right\r\nthing as soon as it was shown them what was right. I was determined to\r\nstart them off on a solid and thorough foundation, so far as their\r\nbooks were concerned. I soon learned that most of them had the merest\r\nsmattering of the high-sounding things that they had studied. While\r\nthey could locate the Desert of Sahara or the capital of China on an\r\nartificial globe, I found out that the girls could not locate the\r\nproper places for the knives and forks on an actual dinner-table, or\r\nthe places on which the bread and meat should be set.\r\n\r\nI had to summon a good deal of courage to take a student who had been\r\nstudying cube root and “banking and discount,” and explain to him that\r\nthe wisest thing for him to do first was thoroughly master the\r\nmultiplication table.\r\n\r\nThe number of pupils increased each week, until by the end of the first\r\nmonth there were nearly fifty. Many of them, however, said that, as\r\nthey could remain only for two or three months, they wanted to enter a\r\nhigh class and get a diploma the first year if possible.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first six weeks a new and rare face entered the\r\nschool as a co-teacher. This was Miss Olivia A. Davidson, who later\r\nbecame my wife. Miss Davidson was born in Ohio, and received her\r\npreparatory education in the public schools of that state. When little\r\nmore than a girl, she heard of the need of teachers in the South. She\r\nwent to the state of Mississippi and began teaching there. Later she\r\ntaught in the city of Memphis. While teaching in Mississippi, one of\r\nher pupils became ill with smallpox. Every one in the community was so\r\nfrightened that no one would nurse the boy. Miss Davidson closed her\r\nschool and remained by the bedside of the boy night and day until he\r\nrecovered. While she was at her Ohio home on her vacation, the worst\r\nepidemic of yellow fever broke out in Memphis, Tenn., that perhaps has\r\never occurred in the South. When she heard of this, she at once\r\ntelegraphed the Mayor of Memphis, offering her services as a\r\nyellow-fever nurse, although she had never had the disease.\r\n\r\nMiss Davidon’s experience in the South showed her that the people\r\nneeded something more than mere book-learning. She heard of the Hampton\r\nsystem of education, and decided that this was what she wanted in order\r\nto prepare herself for better work in the South. The attention of Mrs.\r\nMary Hemenway, of Boston, was attracted to her rare ability. Through\r\nMrs. Hemenway’s kindness and generosity, Miss Davidson, after\r\ngraduating at Hampton, received an opportunity to complete a two years’\r\ncourse of training at the Massachusetts State Normal School at\r\nFramingham.\r\n\r\nBefore she went to Framingham, some one suggested to Miss Davidson\r\nthat, since she was so very light in colour, she might find it more\r\ncomfortable not to be known as a coloured women in this school in\r\nMassachusetts. She at once replied that under no circumstances and for\r\nno considerations would she consent to deceive any one in regard to her\r\nracial identity.\r\n\r\nSoon after her graduation from the Framingham institution, Miss\r\nDavidson came to Tuskegee, bringing into the school many valuable and\r\nfresh ideas as to the best methods of teaching, as well as a rare moral\r\ncharacter and a life of unselfishness that I think has seldom been\r\nequalled. No single individual did more toward laying the foundations\r\nof the Tuskegee Institute so as to insure the successful work that has\r\nbeen done there than Olivia A. Davidson.\r\n\r\nMiss Davidson and I began consulting as to the future of the school\r\nfrom the first. The students were making progress in learning books and\r\nin developing their minds; but it became apparent at once that, if we\r\nwere to make any permanent impression upon those who had come to us for\r\ntraining we must do something besides teach them mere books. The\r\nstudents had come from homes where they had had no opportunities for\r\nlessons which would teach them how to care for their bodies. With few\r\nexceptions, the homes in Tuskegee in which the students boarded were\r\nbut little improvement upon those from which they had come. We wanted\r\nto teach the students how to bathe; how to care for their teeth and\r\nclothing. We wanted to teach them what to eat, and how to eat it\r\nproperly, and how to care for their rooms. Aside from this, we wanted\r\nto give them such a practical knowledge of some one industry, together\r\nwith the spirit of industry, thrift, and economy, that they would be\r\nsure of knowing how to make a living after they had left us. We wanted\r\nto teach them to study actual things instead of mere books alone.\r\n\r\nWe found that the most of our students came from the country districts,\r\nwhere agriculture in some form or other was the main dependence of the\r\npeople. We learned that about eighty-five per cent of the coloured\r\npeople in the Gulf states depended upon agriculture for their living.\r\nSince this was true, we wanted to be careful not to educate our\r\nstudents out of sympathy with agricultural life, so that they would be\r\nattracted from the country to the cities, and yield to the temptation\r\nof trying to live by their wits. We wanted to give them such an\r\neducation as would fit a large proportion of them to be teachers, and\r\nat the same time cause them to return to the plantation districts and\r\nshow the people there how to put new energy and new ideas into farming,\r\nas well as into the intellectual and moral and religious life of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAll these ideas and needs crowded themselves upon us with a seriousness\r\nthat seemed well-nigh overwhelming. What were we to do? We had only the\r\nlittle old shanty and the abandoned church which the good coloured\r\npeople of the town of Tuskegee had kindly loaned us for the\r\naccommodation of the classes. The number of students was increasing\r\ndaily. The more we saw of them, and the more we travelled through the\r\ncountry districts, the more we saw that our efforts were reaching, to\r\nonly a partial degree, the actual needs of the people whom we wanted to\r\nlift up through the medium of the students whom we should educate and\r\nsend out as leaders.\r\n\r\nThe more we talked with the students, who were then coming to us from\r\nseveral parts of the state, the more we found that the chief ambition\r\namong a large proportion of them was to get an education so that they\r\nwould not have to work any longer with their hands.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated by a story told of a coloured man in Alabama, who,\r\none hot day in July, while he was at work in a cotton-field, suddenly\r\nstopped, and, looking toward the skies, said: “O Lawd, de cotton am so\r\ngrassy, de work am so hard, and the sun am so hot dat I b’lieve dis\r\ndarky am called to preach!”\r\n\r\nAbout three months after the opening of the school, and at the time\r\nwhen we were in the greatest anxiety about our work, there came into\r\nmarket for sale an old and abandoned plantation which was situated\r\nabout a mile from the town of Tuskegee. The mansion house—or “big\r\nhouse,” as it would have been called—which had been occupied by the\r\nowners during slavery, had been burned. After making a careful\r\nexamination of the place, it seemed to be just the location that we\r\nwanted in order to make our work effective and permanent.\r\n\r\nBut how were we to get it? The price asked for it was very little—only\r\nfive hundred dollars—but we had no money, and we were strangers in the\r\ntown and had no credit. The owner of the land agreed to let us occupy\r\nthe place if we could make a payment of two hundred and fifty dollars\r\ndown, with the understanding that the remaining two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars must be paid within a year. Although five hundred dollars was\r\ncheap for the land, it was a large sum when one did not have any part\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the difficulty I summoned a great deal of courage and\r\nwrote to my friend General J.F.B. Marshall, the Treasurer of the\r\nHampton Institute, putting the situation before him and beseeching him\r\nto lend me the two hundred and fifty dollars on my own personal\r\nresponsibility. Within a few days a reply came to the effect that he\r\nhad no authority to lend me the money belonging to the Hampton\r\nInstitute, but that he would gladly lend me the amount needed from his\r\nown personal funds.\r\n\r\nI confess that the securing of this money in this way was a great\r\nsurprise to me, as well as a source of gratification. Up to that time I\r\nnever had had in my possession so much money as one hundred dollars at\r\na time, and the loan which I had asked General Marshall for seemed a\r\ntremendously large sum to me. The fact of my being responsible for the\r\nrepaying of such a large amount of money weighed very heavily upon me.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in getting ready to move the school on to the new farm.\r\nAt the time we occupied the place there were standing upon it a cabin,\r\nformerly used as a dining room, an old kitchen, a stable, and an old\r\nhen-house. Within a few weeks we had all of these structures in use.\r\nThe stable was repaired and used as a recitation-room, and very\r\npresently the hen-house was utilized for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nI recall that one morning, when I told an old coloured man who lived\r\nnear, and who sometimes helped me, that our school had grown so large\r\nthat it would be necessary for us to use the hen-house for school\r\npurposes, and that I wanted him to help me give it a thorough cleaning\r\nout the next day, he replied, in the most earnest manner: “What you\r\nmean, boss? You sholy ain’t gwine clean out de hen-house in de\r\nday-time?”\r\n\r\nNearly all the work of getting the new location ready for school\r\npurposes was done by the students after school was over in the\r\nafternoon. As soon as we got the cabins in condition to be used, I\r\ndetermined to clear up some land so that we could plant a crop. When I\r\nexplained my plan to the young men, I noticed that they did not seem to\r\ntake to it very kindly. It was hard for them to see the connection\r\nbetween clearing land and an education. Besides, many of them had been\r\nschool-teachers, and they questioned whether or not clearing land would\r\nbe in keeping with their dignity. In order to relieve them from any\r\nembarrassment, each afternoon after school I took my axe and led the\r\nway to the woods. When they saw that I was not afraid or ashamed to\r\nwork, they began to assist with more enthusiasm. We kept at the work\r\neach afternoon, until we had cleared about twenty acres and had planted\r\na crop.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Miss Davidson was devising plans to repay the loan. Her\r\nfirst effort was made by holding festivals, or “suppers.” She made a\r\npersonal canvass among the white and coloured families in the town of\r\nTuskegee, and got them to agree to give something, like a cake, a\r\nchicken, bread, or pies, that could be sold at the festival. Of course\r\nthe coloured people were glad to give anything that they could spare,\r\nbut I want to add that Miss Davidson did not apply to a single white\r\nfamily, so far as I now remember, that failed to donate something; and\r\nin many ways the white families showed their interest in the school.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these festivals were held, and quite a little sum of money\r\nwas raised. A canvass was also made among the people of both races for\r\ndirect gifts of money, and most of those applied to gave small sums. It\r\nwas often pathetic to note the gifts of the older coloured people, most\r\nof whom had spent their best days in slavery. Sometimes they would give\r\nfive cents, sometimes twenty-five cents. Sometimes the contribution was\r\na quilt, or a quantity of sugarcane. I recall one old coloured women\r\nwho was about seventy years of age, who came to see me when we were\r\nraising money to pay for the farm. She hobbled into the room where I\r\nwas, leaning on a cane. She was clad in rags; but they were clean. She\r\nsaid: “Mr. Washin’ton, God knows I spent de bes’ days of my life in\r\nslavery. God knows I’s ignorant an’ poor; but,” she added, “I knows\r\nwhat you an’ Miss Davidson is tryin’ to do. I knows you is tryin’ to\r\nmake better men an’ better women for de coloured race. I ain’t got no\r\nmoney, but I wants you to take dese six eggs, what I’s been savin’ up,\r\nan’ I wants you to put dese six eggs into the eddication of dese boys\r\nan’ gals.”\r\n\r\nSince the work at Tuskegee started, it has been my privilege to receive\r\nmany gifts for the benefit of the institution, but never any, I think,\r\nthat touched me so deeply as this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\nAnxious Days And Sleepless Nights\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coming of Christmas, that first year of our residence in Alabama,\r\ngave us an opportunity to get a farther insight into the real life of\r\nthe people. The first thing that reminded us that Christmas had arrived\r\nwas the “foreday” visits of scores of children rapping at our doors,\r\nasking for “Chris’mus gifts! Chris’mus gifts!” Between the hours of two\r\no’clock and five o’clock in the morning I presume that we must have had\r\na half-hundred such calls. This custom prevails throughout this portion\r\nof the South to-day.\r\n\r\nDuring the days of slavery it was a custom quite generally observed\r\nthroughout all the Southern states to give the coloured people a week\r\nof holiday at Christmas, or to allow the holiday to continue as long as\r\nthe “yule log” lasted. The male members of the race, and often the\r\nfemale members, were expected to get drunk. We found that for a whole\r\nweek the coloured people in and around Tuskegee dropped work the day\r\nbefore Christmas, and that it was difficult for any one to perform any\r\nservice from the time they stopped work until after the New Year.\r\nPersons who at other times did not use strong drink thought it quite\r\nthe proper thing to indulge in it rather freely during the Christmas\r\nweek. There was a widespread hilarity, and a free use of guns, pistols,\r\nand gunpowder generally. The sacredness of the season seemed to have\r\nbeen almost wholly lost sight of.\r\n\r\nDuring this first Christmas vacation I went some distance from the town\r\nto visit the people on one of the large plantations. In their poverty\r\nand ignorance it was pathetic to see their attempts to get joy out of\r\nthe season that in most parts of the country is so sacred and so dear\r\nto the heart. In one cabin I notice that all that the five children had\r\nto remind them of the coming of Christ was a single bunch of\r\nfirecrackers, which they had divided among them. In another cabin,\r\nwhere there were at least a half-dozen persons, they had only ten\r\ncents’ worth of ginger-cakes, which had been bought in the store the\r\nday before. In another family they had only a few pieces of sugarcane.\r\nIn still another cabin I found nothing but a new jug of cheap, mean\r\nwhiskey, which the husband and wife were making free use of,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the husband was one of the local\r\nministers. In a few instances I found that the people had gotten hold\r\nof some bright-coloured cards that had been designed for advertising\r\npurposes, and were making the most of these. In other homes some member\r\nof the family had bought a new pistol. In the majority of cases there\r\nwas nothing to be seen in the cabin to remind one of the coming of the\r\nSaviour, except that the people had ceased work in the fields and were\r\nlounging about their homes. At night, during Christmas week, they\r\nusually had what they called a “frolic,” in some cabin on the\r\nplantation. That meant a kind of rough dance, where there was likely to\r\nbe a good deal of whiskey used, and where there might be some shooting\r\nor cutting with razors.\r\n\r\nWhile I was making this Christmas visit I met an old coloured man who\r\nwas one of the numerous local preachers, who tried to convince me, from\r\nthe experience Adam had in the Garden of Eden, that God had cursed all\r\nlabour, and that, therefore, it was a sin for any man to work. For that\r\nreason this man sought to do as little work as possible. He seemed at\r\nthat time to be supremely happy, because he was living, as he expressed\r\nit, through one week that was free from sin.\r\n\r\nIn the school we made a special effort to teach our students the\r\nmeaning of Christmas, and to give them lessons in its proper\r\nobservance. In this we have been successful to a degree that makes me\r\nfeel safe in saying that the season now has a new meaning, not only\r\nthrough all that immediate region, but, in a measure, wherever our\r\ngraduates have gone.\r\n\r\nAt the present time one of the most satisfactory features of the\r\nChristmas and Thanksgiving season at Tuskegee is the unselfish and\r\nbeautiful way in which our graduates and students spend their time in\r\nadministering to the comfort and happiness of others, especially the\r\nunfortunate. Not long ago some of our young men spent a holiday in\r\nrebuilding a cabin for a helpless coloured women who was about\r\nseventy-five years old. At another time I remember that I made it known\r\nin chapel, one night, that a very poor student was suffering from cold,\r\nbecause he needed a coat. The next morning two coats were sent to my\r\noffice for him.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the disposition on the part of the white people in\r\nthe town of Tuskegee and vicinity to help the school. From the first, I\r\nresolved to make the school a real part of the community in which it\r\nwas located. I was determined that no one should have the feeling that\r\nit was a foreign institution, dropped down in the midst of the people,\r\nfor which they had no responsibility and in which they had no interest.\r\nI noticed that the very fact that they had been asking to contribute\r\ntoward the purchase of the land made them begin to feel as if it was\r\ngoing to be their school, to a large degree. I noted that just in\r\nproportion as we made the white people feel that the institution was a\r\npart of the life of the community, and that, while we wanted to make\r\nfriends in Boston, for example, we also wanted to make white friends in\r\nTuskegee, and that we wanted to make the school of real service to all\r\nthe people, their attitude toward the school became favourable.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I might add right here, what I hope to demonstrate later, that,\r\nso far as I know, the Tuskegee school at the present time has no warmer\r\nand more enthusiastic friends anywhere than it has among the white\r\ncitizens of Tuskegee and throughout the state of Alabama and the entire\r\nSouth. From the first, I have advised our people in the South to make\r\nfriends in every straightforward, manly way with their next-door\r\nneighbour, whether he be a black man or a white man. I have also\r\nadvised them, where no principle is at stake, to consult the interests\r\nof their local communities, and to advise with their friends in regard\r\nto their voting.\r\n\r\nFor several months the work of securing the money with which to pay for\r\nthe farm went on without ceasing. At the end of three months enough was\r\nsecured to repay the loan of two hundred and fifty dollars to General\r\nMarshall, and within two months more we had secured the entire five\r\nhundred dollars and had received a deed of the one hundred acres of\r\nland. This gave us a great deal of satisfaction. It was not only a\r\nsource of satisfaction to secure a permanent location for the school,\r\nbut it was equally satisfactory to know that the greater part of the\r\nmoney with which it was paid for had been gotten from the white and\r\ncoloured people in the town of Tuskegee. The most of this money was\r\nobtained by holding festivals and concerts, and from small individual\r\ndonations.\r\n\r\nOur next effort was in the direction of increasing the cultivation of\r\nthe land, so as to secure some return from it, and at the same time\r\ngive the students training in agriculture. All the industries at\r\nTuskegee have been started in natural and logical order, growing out of\r\nthe needs of a community settlement. We began with farming, because we\r\nwanted something to eat.\r\n\r\nMany of the students, also, were able to remain in school but a few\r\nweeks at a time, because they had so little money with which to pay\r\ntheir board. Thus another object which made it desirable to get an\r\nindustrial system started was in order to make it available as a means\r\nof helping the students to earn money enough so that they might be able\r\nto remain in school during the nine months’ session of the school year.\r\n\r\nThe first animal that the school came into possession of was an old\r\nblind horse given us by one of the white citizens of Tuskegee. Perhaps\r\nI may add here that at the present time the school owns over two\r\nhundred horses, colts, mules, cows, calves, and oxen, and about seven\r\nhundred hogs and pigs, as well as a large number of sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nThe school was constantly growing in numbers, so much so that, after we\r\nhad got the farm paid for, the cultivation of the land begun, and the\r\nold cabins which we had found on the place somewhat repaired, we turned\r\nour attention toward providing a large, substantial building. After\r\nhaving given a good deal of thought to the subject, we finally had the\r\nplans drawn for a building that was estimated to cost about six\r\nthousand dollars. This seemed to us a tremendous sum, but we knew that\r\nthe school must go backward or forward, and that our work would mean\r\nlittle unless we could get hold of the students in their home life.\r\n\r\nOne incident which occurred about this time gave me a great deal of\r\nsatisfaction as well as surprise. When it became known in the town that\r\nwe were discussing the plans for a new, large building, a Southern\r\nwhite man who was operating a sawmill not far from Tuskegee came to me\r\nand said that he would gladly put all the lumber necessary to erect the\r\nbuilding on the grounds, with no other guarantee for payment than my\r\nword that it would be paid for when we secured some money. I told the\r\nman frankly that at the time we did not have in our hands one dollar of\r\nthe money needed. Notwithstanding this, he insisted on being allowed to\r\nput the lumber on the grounds. After we had secured some portion of the\r\nmoney we permitted him to do this.\r\n\r\nMiss Davidson again began the work of securing in various ways small\r\ncontributions for the new building from the white and coloured people\r\nin and near Tuskegee. I think I never saw a community of people so\r\nhappy over anything as were the coloured people over the prospect of\r\nthis new building. One day, when we were holding a meeting to secure\r\nfunds for its erection, an old, ante-bellum coloured man came a\r\ndistance of twelve miles and brought in his ox-cart a large hog. When\r\nthe meeting was in progress, he rose in the midst of the company and\r\nsaid that he had no money which he could give, but he had raised two\r\nfine hogs, and that he had brought one of them as a contribution toward\r\nthe expenses of the building. He closed his announcement by saying:\r\n“Any nigger that’s got any love for his race, or any respect for\r\nhimself, will bring a hog to the next meeting.” Quite a number of men\r\nin the community also volunteered to give several days’ work, each,\r\ntoward the erection of the building.\r\n\r\nAfter we had secured all the help that we could in Tuskegee, Miss\r\nDavidson decided to go North for the purpose of securing additional\r\nfunds. For weeks she visited individuals and spoke in churches and\r\nbefore Sunday schools and other organizations. She found this work\r\nquite trying, and often embarrassing. The school was not known, but she\r\nwas not long in winning her way into the confidence of the best people\r\nin the North.\r\n\r\nThe first gift from any Northern person was received from a New York\r\nlady whom Miss Davidson met on the boat that was bringing her North.\r\nThey fell into a conversation, and the Northern lady became so much\r\ninterested in the effort being made at Tuskegee that before they parted\r\nMiss Davidson was handed a check for fifty dollars. For some time\r\nbefore our marriage, and also after it, Miss Davidson kept up the work\r\nof securing money in the North and in the South by interesting people\r\nby personal visits and through correspondence. At the same time she\r\nkept in close touch with the work at Tuskegee, as lady principal and\r\nclassroom teacher. In addition to this, she worked among the older\r\npeople in and near Tuskegee, and taught a Sunday school class in the\r\ntown. She was never very strong, but never seemed happy unless she was\r\ngiving all of her strength to the cause which she loved. Often, at\r\nnight, after spending the day in going from door to door trying to\r\ninterest persons in the work at Tuskegee, she would be so exhausted\r\nthat she could not undress herself. A lady upon whom she called, in\r\nBoston, afterward told me that at one time when Miss Davidson called\r\nher to see and send up her card the lady was detained a little before\r\nshe could see Miss Davidson, and when she entered the parlour she found\r\nMiss Davidson so exhausted that she had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nWhile putting up our first building, which was named Porter Hall, after\r\nMr. A.H. Porter, of Brooklyn, N.Y., who gave a generous sum toward its\r\nerection, the need for money became acute. I had given one of our\r\ncreditors a promise that upon a certain day he should be paid four\r\nhundred dollars. On the morning of that day we did not have a dollar.\r\nThe mail arrived at the school at ten o’clock, and in this mail there\r\nwas a check sent by Miss Davidson for exactly four hundred dollars. I\r\ncould relate many instances of almost the same character. This four\r\nhundred dollars was given by two ladies in Boston. Two years later,\r\nwhen the work at Tuskegee had grown considerably, and when we were in\r\nthe midst of a season when we were so much in need of money that the\r\nfuture looked doubtful and gloomy, the same two Boston ladies sent us\r\nsix thousand dollars. Words cannot describe our surprise, or the\r\nencouragement that the gift brought to us. Perhaps I might add here\r\nthat for fourteen years these same friends have sent us six thousand\r\ndollars a year.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plans were drawn for the new building, the students\r\nbegan digging out the earth where the foundations were to be laid,\r\nworking after the regular classes were over. They had not fully\r\noutgrown the idea that it was hardly the proper thing for them to use\r\ntheir hands, since they had come there, as one of them expressed it,\r\n“to be educated, and not to work.” Gradually, though, I noted with\r\nsatisfaction that a sentiment in favour of work was gaining ground.\r\nAfter a few weeks of hard work the foundations were ready, and a day\r\nwas appointed for the laying of the corner-stone.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that the laying of this corner-stone took place\r\nin the heart of the South, in the “Black Belt,” in the centre of that\r\npart of our country that was most devoted to slavery; that at that time\r\nslavery had been abolished only about sixteen years; that only sixteen\r\nyears before no Negro could be taught from books without the teacher\r\nreceiving the condemnation of the law or of public sentiment—when all\r\nthis is considered, the scene that was witnessed on that spring day at\r\nTuskegee was a remarkable one. I believe there are few places in the\r\nworld where it could have taken place.\r\n\r\nThe principal address was delivered by the Hon. Waddy Thompson, the\r\nSuperintendent of Education for the county. About the corner-stone were\r\ngathered the teachers, the students, their parents and friends, the\r\ncounty officials—who were white—and all the leading white men in that\r\nvicinity, together with many of the black men and women whom the same\r\nwhite people but a few years before had held a title to as property.\r\nThe members of both races were anxious to exercise the privilege of\r\nplacing under the corner-stone some momento.\r\n\r\nBefore the building was completed we passed through some very trying\r\nseasons. More than once our hearts were made to bleed, as it were,\r\nbecause bills were falling due that we did not have the money to meet.\r\nPerhaps no one who has not gone through the experience, month after\r\nmonth, of trying to erect buildings and provide equipment for a school\r\nwhen no one knew where the money was to come from, can properly\r\nappreciate the difficulties under which we laboured. During the first\r\nyears at Tuskegee I recall that night after night I would roll and toss\r\non my bed, without sleep, because of the anxiety and uncertainty which\r\nwe were in regarding money. I knew that, in a large degree, we were\r\ntrying an experiment—that of testing whether or not it was possible for\r\nNegroes to build up and control the affairs of a large education\r\ninstitution. I knew that if we failed it would injure the whole race. I\r\nknew that the presumption was against us. I knew that in the case of\r\nwhite people beginning such an enterprise it would be taken for granted\r\nthat they were going to succeed, but in our case I felt that people\r\nwould be surprised if we succeeded. All this made a burden which\r\npressed down on us, sometimes, it seemed, at the rate of a thousand\r\npounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\nIn all our difficulties and anxieties, however, I never went to a white\r\nor a black person in the town of Tuskegee for any assistance that was\r\nin their power to render, without being helped according to their\r\nmeans. More than a dozen times, when bills figuring up into the\r\nhundreds of dollars were falling due, I applied to the white men of\r\nTuskegee for small loans, often borrowing small amounts from as many as\r\na half-dozen persons, to meet our obligations. One thing I was\r\ndetermined to do from the first, and that was to keep the credit of the\r\nschool high; and this, I think I can say without boasting, we have done\r\nall through these years.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember a bit of advice given me by Mr. George W.\r\nCampbell, the white man to whom I have referred to as the one who\r\ninduced General Armstrong to send me to Tuskegee. Soon after I entered\r\nupon the work Mr. Campbell said to me, in his fatherly way:\r\n“Washington, always remember that credit is capital.”\r\n\r\nAt one time when we were in the greatest distress for money that we\r\never experienced, I placed the situation frankly before General\r\nArmstrong. Without hesitation he gave me his personal check for all the\r\nmoney which he had saved for his own use. This was not the only time\r\nthat General Armstrong helped Tuskegee in this way. I do not think I\r\nhave ever made this fact public before.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1882, at the end of the first year’s work of the\r\nschool, I was married to Miss Fannie N. Smith, of Malden, W. Va. We\r\nbegan keeping house in Tuskegee early in the fall. This made a home for\r\nour teachers, who now had been increased to four in number. My wife was\r\nalso a graduate of the Hampton Institute. After earnest and constant\r\nwork in the interests of the school, together with her housekeeping\r\nduties, my wife passed away in May, 1884. One child, Portia M.\r\nWashington, was born during our marriage.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, my wife most earnestly devoted her thoughts and time to\r\nthe work of the school, and was completely one with me in every\r\ninterest and ambition. She passed away, however, before she had an\r\nopportunity of seeing what the school was designed to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\nA Harder Task Than Making Bricks Without Straw\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, at Tuskegee, I was determined to have the\r\nstudents do not only the agricultural and domestic work, but to have\r\nthem erect their own buildings. My plan was to have them, while\r\nperforming this service, taught the latest and best methods of labour,\r\nso that the school would not only get the benefit of their efforts, but\r\nthe students themselves would be taught to see not only utility in\r\nlabour, but beauty and dignity; would be taught, in fact, how to lift\r\nlabour up from mere drudgery and toil, and would learn to love work for\r\nits own sake. My plan was not to teach them to work in the old way, but\r\nto show them how to make the forces of nature—air, water, steam,\r\nelectricity, horse-power—assist them in their labour.\r\n\r\nAt first many advised against the experiment of having the buildings\r\nerected by the labour of the students, but I was determined to stick to\r\nit. I told those who doubted the wisdom of the plan that I knew that\r\nour first buildings would not be so comfortable or so complete in their\r\nfinish as buildings erected by the experienced hands of outside\r\nworkmen, but that in the teaching of civilization, self-help, and\r\nself-reliance, the erection of buildings by the students themselves\r\nwould more than compensate for any lack of comfort or fine finish.\r\n\r\nI further told those who doubted the wisdom of this plan, that the\r\nmajority of our students came to us in poverty, from the cabins of the\r\ncotton, sugar, and rice plantations of the South, and that while I knew\r\nit would please the students very much to place them at once in finely\r\nconstructed buildings, I felt that it would be following out a more\r\nnatural process of development to teach them how to construct their own\r\nbuildings. Mistakes I knew would be made, but these mistakes would\r\nteach us valuable lessons for the future.\r\n\r\nDuring the now nineteen years’ existence of the Tuskegee school, the\r\nplan of having the buildings erected by student labour has been adhered\r\nto. In this time forty buildings, counting small and large, have been\r\nbuilt, and all except four are almost wholly the product of student\r\nlabour. As an additional result, hundreds of men are now scattered\r\nthroughout the South who received their knowledge of mechanics while\r\nbeing taught how to erect these buildings. Skill and knowledge are now\r\nhanded down from one set of students to another in this way, until at\r\nthe present time a building of any description or size can be\r\nconstructed wholly by our instructors and students, from the drawing of\r\nthe plans to the putting in of the electric fixtures, without going off\r\nthe grounds for a single workman.\r\n\r\nNot a few times, when a new student has been led into the temptation of\r\nmarring the looks of some building by leadpencil marks or by the cuts\r\nof a jack-knife, I have heard an old student remind him: “Don’t do\r\nthat. That is our building. I helped put it up.”\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the school I think my most trying experience was\r\nin the matter of brickmaking. As soon as we got the farm work\r\nreasonably well started, we directed our next efforts toward the\r\nindustry of making bricks. We needed these for use in connection with\r\nthe erection of our own buildings; but there was also another reason\r\nfor establishing this industry. There was no brickyard in the town, and\r\nin addition to our own needs there was a demand for bricks in the\r\ngeneral market.\r\n\r\nI had always sympathized with the “Children of Israel,” in their task\r\nof “making bricks without straw,” but ours was the task of making\r\nbricks with no money and no experience.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the work was hard and dirty, and it was difficult\r\nto get the students to help. When it came to brickmaking, their\r\ndistaste for manual labour in connection with book education became\r\nespecially manifest. It was not a pleasant task for one to stand in the\r\nmud-pit for hours, with the mud up to his knees. More than one man\r\nbecame disgusted and left the school.\r\n\r\nWe tried several locations before we opened up a pit that furnished\r\nbrick clay. I had always supposed that brickmaking was very simple, but\r\nI soon found out by bitter experience that it required special skill\r\nand knowledge, particularly in the burning of the bricks. After a good\r\ndeal of effort we moulded about twenty-five thousand bricks, and put\r\nthem into a kiln to be burned. This kiln turned out to be a failure,\r\nbecause it was not properly constructed or properly burned. We began at\r\nonce, however, on a second kiln. This, for some reason, also proved a\r\nfailure. The failure of this kiln made it still more difficult to get\r\nthe students to take part in the work. Several of the teachers,\r\nhowever, who had been trained in the industries at Hampton, volunteered\r\ntheir services, and in some way we succeeded in getting a third kiln\r\nready for burning. The burning of a kiln required about a week. Toward\r\nthe latter part of the week, when it seemed as if we were going to have\r\na good many thousand bricks in a few hours, in the middle of the night\r\nthe kiln fell. For the third time we had failed.\r\n\r\nThe failure of this last kiln left me without a single dollar with\r\nwhich to make another experiment. Most of the teachers advised the\r\nabandoning of the effort to make bricks. In the midst of my troubles I\r\nthought of a watch which had come into my possession years before. I\r\ntook the watch to the city of Montgomery, which was not far distant,\r\nand placed it in a pawn-shop. I secured cash upon it to the amount of\r\nfifteen dollars, with which to renew the brickmaking experiment. I\r\nreturned to Tuskegee, and, with the help of the fifteen dollars,\r\nrallied our rather demoralized and discouraged forces and began a\r\nfourth attempt to make bricks. This time, I am glad to say, we were\r\nsuccessful. Before I got hold of any money, the time-limit on my watch\r\nhad expired, and I have never seen it since; but I have never regretted\r\nthe loss of it.\r\n\r\nBrickmaking has now become such an important industry at the school\r\nthat last season our students manufactured twelve hundred thousand of\r\nfirst-class bricks, of a quality suitable to be sold in any market.\r\nAside from this, scores of young men have mastered the brickmaking\r\ntrade—both the making of bricks by hand and by machinery—and are now\r\nengaged in this industry in many parts of the South.\r\n\r\nThe making of these bricks taught me an important lesson in regard to\r\nthe relations of the two races in the South. Many white people who had\r\nhad no contact with the school, and perhaps no sympathy with it, came\r\nto us to buy bricks because they found out that ours were good bricks.\r\nThey discovered that we were supplying a real want in the community.\r\nThe making of these bricks caused many of the white residents of the\r\nneighbourhood to begin to feel that the education of the Negro was not\r\nmaking him worthless, but that in educating our students we were adding\r\nsomething to the wealth and comfort of the community. As the people of\r\nthe neighbourhood came to us to buy bricks, we got acquainted with\r\nthem; they traded with us and we with them. Our business interests\r\nbecame intermingled. We had something which they wanted; they had\r\nsomething which we wanted. This, in a large measure, helped to lay the\r\nfoundation for the pleasant relations that have continued to exist\r\nbetween us and the white people in that section, and which now extend\r\nthroughout the South.\r\n\r\nWherever one of our brickmakers has gone in the South, we find that he\r\nhas something to contribute to the well-being of the community into\r\nwhich he has gone; something that has made the community feel that, in\r\na degree, it is indebted to him, and perhaps, to a certain extent,\r\ndependent upon him. In this way pleasant relations between the races\r\nhave been stimulated.\r\n\r\nMy experience is that there is something in human nature which always\r\nmakes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what\r\ncolour of skin merit is found. I have found, too, that it is the\r\nvisible, the tangible, that goes a long ways in softening prejudices.\r\nThe actual sight of a first-class house that a Negro has built is ten\r\ntimes more potent than pages of discussion about a house that he ought\r\nto build, or perhaps could build.\r\n\r\nThe same principle of industrial education has been carried out in the\r\nbuilding of our own wagons, carts, and buggies, from the first. We now\r\nown and use on our farm and about the school dozens of these vehicles,\r\nand every one of them has been built by the hands of the students.\r\nAside from this, we help supply the local market with these vehicles.\r\nThe supplying of them to the people in the community has had the same\r\neffect as the supplying of bricks, and the man who learns at Tuskegee\r\nto build and repair wagons and carts is regarded as a benefactor by\r\nboth races in the community where he goes. The people with whom he\r\nlives and works are going to think twice before they part with such a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in\r\nthe end, make his way regardless of race. One man may go into a\r\ncommunity prepared to supply the people there with an analysis of Greek\r\nsentences. The community may not at the time be prepared for, or feel\r\nthe need of, Greek analysis, but it may feel its need of bricks and\r\nhouses and wagons. If the man can supply the need for those, then, it\r\nwill lead eventually to a demand for the first product, and with the\r\ndemand will come the ability to appreciate it and to profit by it.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that we succeeded in burning our first kiln of bricks we\r\nbegan facing in an emphasized form the objection of the students to\r\nbeing taught to work. By this time it had gotten to be pretty well\r\nadvertised throughout the state that every student who came to\r\nTuskegee, no matter what his financial ability might be, must learn\r\nsome industry. Quite a number of letters came from parents protesting\r\nagainst their children engaging in labour while they were in the\r\nschool. Other parents came to the school to protest in person. Most of\r\nthe new students brought a written or a verbal request from their\r\nparents to the effect that they wanted their children taught nothing\r\nbut books. The more books, the larger they were, and the longer the\r\ntitles printed upon them, the better pleased the students and their\r\nparents seemed to be.\r\n\r\nI gave little heed to these protests, except that I lost no opportunity\r\nto go into as many parts of the state as I could, for the purpose of\r\nspeaking to the parents, and showing them the value of industrial\r\neducation. Besides, I talked to the students constantly on the subject.\r\nNotwithstanding the unpopularity of industrial work, the school\r\ncontinued to increase in numbers to such an extent that by the middle\r\nof the second year there was an attendance of about one hundred and\r\nfifty, representing almost all parts of the state of Alabama, and\r\nincluding a few from other states.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1882 Miss Davidson and I both went North and engaged\r\nin the work of raising funds for the completion of our new building. On\r\nmy way North I stopped in New York to try to get a letter of\r\nrecommendation from an officer of a missionary organization who had\r\nbecome somewhat acquainted with me a few years previous. This man not\r\nonly refused to give me the letter, but advised me most earnestly to go\r\nback home at once, and not make any attempt to get money, for he was\r\nquite sure that I would never get more than enough to pay my travelling\r\nexpenses. I thanked him for his advice, and proceeded on my journey.\r\n\r\nThe first place I went to in the North, was Northampton, Mass., where I\r\nspent nearly a half-day in looking for a coloured family with whom I\r\ncould board, never dreaming that any hotel would admit me. I was\r\ngreatly surprised when I found that I would have no trouble in being\r\naccommodated at a hotel.\r\n\r\nWe were successful in getting money enough so that on Thanksgiving Day\r\nof that year we held our first service in the chapel of Porter Hall,\r\nalthough the building was not completed.\r\n\r\nIn looking about for some one to preach the Thanksgiving sermon, I\r\nfound one of the rarest men that it has ever been my privilege to know.\r\nThis was the Rev. Robert C. Bedford, a white man from Wisconsin, who\r\nwas then pastor of a little coloured Congregational church in\r\nMontgomery, Ala. Before going to Montgomery to look for some one to\r\npreach this sermon I had never heard of Mr. Bedford. He had never heard\r\nof me. He gladly consented to come to Tuskegee and hold the\r\nThanksgiving service. It was the first service of the kind that the\r\ncoloured people there had ever observed, and what a deep interest they\r\nmanifested in it! The sight of the new building made it a day of\r\nThanksgiving for them never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nMr. Bedford consented to become one of the trustees of the school, and\r\nin that capacity, and as a worker for it, he has been connected with it\r\nfor eighteen years. During this time he has borne the school upon his\r\nheart night and day, and is never so happy as when he is performing\r\nsome service, no matter how humble, for it. He completely obliterates\r\nhimself in everything, and looks only for permission to serve where\r\nservice is most disagreeable, and where others would not be attracted.\r\nIn all my relations with him he has seemed to me to approach as nearly\r\nto the spirit of the Master as almost any man I ever met.\r\n\r\nA little later there came into the service of the school another man,\r\nquite young at the time, and fresh from Hampton, without whose service\r\nthe school never could have become what it is. This was Mr. Warren\r\nLogan, who now for seventeen years has been the treasurer of the\r\nInstitute, and the acting principal during my absence. He has always\r\nshown a degree of unselfishness and an amount of business tact, coupled\r\nwith a clear judgment, that has kept the school in good condition no\r\nmatter how long I have been absent from it. During all the financial\r\nstress through which the school has passed, his patience and faith in\r\nour ultimate success have not left him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our first building was near enough to completion so that we\r\ncould occupy a portion of it—which was near the middle of the second\r\nyear of the school—we opened a boarding department. Students had begun\r\ncoming from quite a distance, and in such increasing numbers that we\r\nfelt more and more that we were merely skimming over the surface, in\r\nthat we were not getting hold of the students in their home life.\r\n\r\nWe had nothing but the students and their appetites with which to begin\r\na boarding department. No provision had been made in the new building\r\nfor a kitchen and dining room; but we discovered that by digging out a\r\nlarge amount of earth from under the building we could make a partially\r\nlighted basement room that could be used for a kitchen and dining room.\r\nAgain I called on the students to volunteer for work, this time to\r\nassist in digging out the basement. This they did, and in a few weeks\r\nwe had a place to cook and eat in, although it was very rough and\r\nuncomfortable. Any one seeing the place now would never believe that it\r\nwas once used for a dining room.\r\n\r\nThe most serious problem, though, was to get the boarding department\r\nstarted off in running order, with nothing to do with in the way of\r\nfurniture, and with no money with which to buy anything. The merchants\r\nin the town would let us have what food we wanted on credit. In fact,\r\nin those earlier years I was constantly embarrassed because people\r\nseemed to have more faith in me than I had in myself. It was pretty\r\nhard to cook, however, without stoves, and awkward to eat without\r\ndishes. At first the cooking was done out-of-doors, in the\r\nold-fashioned, primitive style, in pots and skillets placed over a\r\nfire. Some of the carpenters’ benches that had been used in the\r\nconstruction of the building were utilized for tables. As for dishes,\r\nthere were too few to make it worth while to spend time in describing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNo one connected with the boarding department seemed to have any idea\r\nthat meals must be served at certain fixed and regular hours, and this\r\nwas a source of great worry. Everything was so out of joint and so\r\ninconvenient that I feel safe in saying that for the first two weeks\r\nsomething was wrong at every meal. Either the meat was not done or had\r\nbeen burnt, or the salt had been left out of the bread, or the tea had\r\nbeen forgotten.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning I was standing near the dining-room door listening to\r\nthe complaints of the students. The complaints that morning were\r\nespecially emphatic and numerous, because the whole breakfast had been\r\na failure. One of the girls who had failed to get any breakfast came\r\nout and went to the well to draw some water to drink and take the place\r\nof the breakfast which she had not been able to get. When she reached\r\nthe well, she found that the rope was broken and that she could get no\r\nwater. She turned from the well and said, in the most discouraged tone,\r\nnot knowing that I was where I could hear her, “We can’t even get water\r\nto drink at this school.” I think no one remark ever came so near\r\ndiscouraging me as that one.\r\n\r\nAt another time, when Mr. Bedford—whom I have already spoken of as one\r\nof our trustees, and a devoted friend of the institution—was visiting\r\nthe school, he was given a bedroom immediately over the dining room.\r\nEarly in the morning he was awakened by a rather animated discussion\r\nbetween two boys in the dining room below. The discussion was over the\r\nquestion as to whose turn it was to use the coffee-cup that morning.\r\nOne boy won the case by proving that for three mornings he had not had\r\nan opportunity to use the cup at all.\r\n\r\nBut gradually, with patience and hard work, we brought order out of\r\nchaos, just as will be true of any problem if we stick to it with\r\npatience and wisdom and earnest effort.\r\n\r\nAs I look back now over that part of our struggle, I am glad to see\r\nthat we had it. I am glad that we endured all those discomforts and\r\ninconveniences. I am glad that our students had to dig out the place\r\nfor their kitchen and dining room. I am glad that our first\r\nboarding-place was in the dismal, ill-lighted, and damp basement. Had\r\nwe started in a fine, attractive, convenient room, I fear we would have\r\n“lost our heads” and become “stuck up.” It means a great deal, I think,\r\nto start off on a foundation which one has made for one’s self.\r\n\r\nWhen our old students return to Tuskegee now, as they often do, and go\r\ninto our large, beautiful, well-ventilated, and well-lighted dining\r\nroom, and see tempting, well-cooked food—largely grown by the students\r\nthemselves—and see tables, neat tablecloths and napkins, and vases of\r\nflowers upon the tables, and hear singing birds, and note that each\r\nmeal is served exactly upon the minute, with no disorder, and with\r\nalmost no complaint coming from the hundreds that now fill our dining\r\nroom, they, too, often say to me that they are glad that we started as\r\nwe did, and built ourselves up year by year, by a slow and natural\r\nprocess of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\nMaking Their Beds Before They Could Lie On Them\r\n\r\n\r\nA little later in the history of the school we had a visit from General\r\nJ.F.B. Marshall, the Treasurer of the Hampton Institute, who had had\r\nfaith enough to lend us the first two hundred and fifty dollars with\r\nwhich to make a payment down on the farm. He remained with us a week,\r\nand made a careful inspection of everything. He seemed well pleased\r\nwith our progress, and wrote back interesting and encouraging reports\r\nto Hampton. A little later Miss Mary F. Mackie, the teacher who had\r\ngiven me the “sweeping” examination when I entered Hampton, came to see\r\nus, and still later General Armstrong himself came.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the visits of these Hampton friends the number of\r\nteachers at Tuskegee had increased considerably, and the most of the\r\nnew teachers were graduates of the Hampton Institute. We gave our\r\nHampton friends, especially General Armstrong, a cordial welcome. They\r\nwere all surprised and pleased at the rapid progress that the school\r\nhad made within so short a time. The coloured people from miles around\r\ncame to the school to get a look at General Armstrong, about whom they\r\nhad heard so much. The General was not only welcomed by the members of\r\nmy own race, but by the Southern white people as well.\r\n\r\nThis first visit which General Armstrong made to Tuskegee gave me an\r\nopportunity to get an insight into his character such as I had not\r\nbefore had. I refer to his interest in the Southern white people.\r\nBefore this I had had the thought that General Armstrong, having fought\r\nthe Southern white man, rather cherished a feeling of bitterness toward\r\nthe white South, and was interested in helping only the coloured man\r\nthere. But this visit convinced me that I did not know the greatness\r\nand the generosity of the man. I soon learned, by his visits to the\r\nSouthern white people, and from his conversations with them, that he\r\nwas as anxious about the prosperity and the happiness of the white race\r\nas the black. He cherished no bitterness against the South, and was\r\nhappy when an opportunity offered for manifesting his sympathy. In all\r\nmy acquaintance with General Armstrong I never heard him speak, in\r\npublic or in private, a single bitter word against the white man in the\r\nSouth. From his example in this respect I learned the lesson that great\r\nmen cultivate love, and that only little men cherish a spirit of\r\nhatred. I learned that assistance given to the weak makes the one who\r\ngives it strong; and that oppression of the unfortunate makes one weak.\r\n\r\nIt is now long ago that I learned this lesson from General Armstrong,\r\nand resolved that I would permit no man, no matter what his colour\r\nmight be, to narrow and degrade my soul by making me hate him. With\r\nGod’s help, I believe that I have completely rid myself of any ill\r\nfeeling toward the Southern white man for any wrong that he may have\r\ninflicted upon my race. I am made to feel just as happy now when I am\r\nrendering service to Southern white men as when the service is rendered\r\nto a member of my own race. I pity from the bottom of my heart any\r\nindividual who is so unfortunate as to get into the habit of holding\r\nrace prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe more I consider the subject, the more strongly I am convinced that\r\nthe most harmful effect of the practice to which the people in certain\r\nsections of the South have felt themselves compelled to resort, in\r\norder to get rid of the force of the Negroes’ ballot, is not wholly in\r\nthe wrong done to the Negro, but in the permanent injury to the morals\r\nof the white man. The wrong to the Negro is temporary, but to the\r\nmorals of the white man the injury is permanent. I have noted time and\r\ntime again that when an individual perjures himself in order to break\r\nthe force of the black man’s ballot, he soon learns to practise\r\ndishonesty in other relations of life, not only where the Negro is\r\nconcerned, but equally so where a white man is concerned. The white man\r\nwho begins by cheating a Negro usually ends by cheating a white man.\r\nThe white man who begins to break the law by lynching a Negro soon\r\nyields to the temptation to lynch a white man. All this, it seems to\r\nme, makes it important that the whole Nation lend a hand in trying to\r\nlift the burden of ignorance from the South.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that is becoming more apparent each year in the\r\ndevelopment of education in the South is the influence of General\r\nArmstrong’s idea of education; and this not upon the blacks alone, but\r\nupon the whites also. At the present time there is almost no Southern\r\nstate that is not putting forth efforts in the direction of securing\r\nindustrial education for its white boys and girls, and in most cases it\r\nis easy to trace the history of these efforts back to General\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\nSoon after the opening of our humble boarding department students began\r\ncoming to us in still larger numbers. For weeks we not only had to\r\ncontend with the difficulty of providing board, with no money, but also\r\nwith that of providing sleeping accommodations. For this purpose we\r\nrented a number of cabins near the school. These cabins were in a\r\ndilapidated condition, and during the winter months the students who\r\noccupied them necessarily suffered from the cold. We charge the\r\nstudents eight dollars a month—all they were able to pay—for their\r\nboard. This included, besides board, room, fuel, and washing. We also\r\ngave the students credit on their board bills for all the work which\r\nthey did for the school which was of any value to the institution. The\r\ncost of tuition, which was fifty dollars a year for each student, we\r\nhad to secure then, as now, wherever we could.\r\n\r\nThis small charge in cash gave us no capital with which to start a\r\nboarding department. The weather during the second winter of our work\r\nwas very cold. We were not able to provide enough bed-clothes to keep\r\nthe students warm. In fact, for some time we were not able to provide,\r\nexcept in a few cases, bedsteads and mattresses of any kind. During the\r\ncoldest nights I was so troubled about the discomfort of the students\r\nthat I could not sleep myself. I recall that on several occasions I\r\nwent in the middle of the night to the shanties occupied by the young\r\nmen, for the purpose of confronting them. Often I found some of them\r\nsitting huddled around a fire, with the one blanket which we had been\r\nable to provide wrapped around them, trying in this way to keep warm.\r\nDuring the whole night some of them did not attempt to lie down. One\r\nmorning, when the night previous had been unusually cold, I asked those\r\nof the students in the chapel who thought that they had been\r\nfrostbitten during the night to raise their hands. Three hands went up.\r\nNotwithstanding these experiences, there was almost no complaining on\r\nthe part of the students. They knew that we were doing the best that we\r\ncould for them. They were happy in the privilege of being permitted to\r\nenjoy any kind of opportunity that would enable them to improve their\r\ncondition. They were constantly asking what they might do to lighten\r\nthe burdens of the teachers.\r\n\r\nI have heard it stated more than once, both in the North and in the\r\nSouth, that coloured people would not obey and respect each other when\r\none member of the race is placed in a position of authority over\r\nothers. In regard to this general belief and these statements, I can\r\nsay that during the nineteen years of my experience at Tuskegee I\r\nnever, either by word or act, have been treated with disrespect by any\r\nstudent or officer connected with the institution. On the other hand, I\r\nam constantly embarrassed by the many acts of thoughtful kindness. The\r\nstudents do not seem to want to see me carry a large book or a satchel\r\nor any kind of a burden through the grounds. In such cases more than\r\none always offers to relieve me. I almost never go out of my office\r\nwhen the rain is falling that some student does not come to my side\r\nwith an umbrella and ask to be allowed to hold it over me.\r\n\r\nWhile writing upon this subject, it is a pleasure for me to add that in\r\nall my contact with the white people of the South I have never received\r\na single personal insult. The white people in and near Tuskegee, to an\r\nespecial degree, seem to count it as a privilege to show me all the\r\nrespect within their power, and often go out of their way to do this.\r\n\r\nNot very long ago I was making a journey between Dallas (Texas) and\r\nHouston. In some way it became known in advance that I was on the\r\ntrain. At nearly every station at which the train stopped, numbers of\r\nwhite people, including in most cases of the officials of the town,\r\ncame aboard and introduced themselves and thanked me heartily for the\r\nwork that I was trying to do for the South.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when I was making a trip from Augusta, Georgia, to\r\nAtlanta, being rather tired from much travel, I rode in a Pullman\r\nsleeper. When I went into the car, I found there two ladies from Boston\r\nwhom I knew well. These good ladies were perfectly ignorant, it seems,\r\nof the customs of the South, and in the goodness of their hearts\r\ninsisted that I take a seat with them in their section. After some\r\nhesitation I consented. I had been there but a few minutes when one of\r\nthem, without my knowledge, ordered supper to be served for the three\r\nof us. This embarrassed me still further. The car was full of Southern\r\nwhite men, most of whom had their eyes on our party. When I found that\r\nsupper had been ordered, I tried to contrive some excuse that would\r\npermit me to leave the section, but the ladies insisted that I must eat\r\nwith them. I finally settled back in my seat with a sigh, and said to\r\nmyself, “I am in for it now, sure.”\r\n\r\nTo add further to the embarrassment of the situation, soon after the\r\nsupper was placed on the table one of the ladies remembered that she\r\nhad in her satchel a special kind of tea which she wished served, and\r\nas she said she felt quite sure the porter did not know how to brew it\r\nproperly, she insisted upon getting up and preparing and serving it\r\nherself. At last the meal was over; and it seemed the longest one that\r\nI had ever eaten. When we were through, I decided to get myself out of\r\nthe embarrassing situation and go to the smoking-room, where most of\r\nthe men were by that time, to see how the land lay. In the meantime,\r\nhowever, it had become known in some way throughout the car who I was.\r\nWhen I went into the smoking-room I was never more surprised in my life\r\nthan when each man, nearly every one of them a citizen of Georgia, came\r\nup and introduced himself to me and thanked me earnestly for the work\r\nthat I was trying to do for the whole South. This was not flattery,\r\nbecause each one of these individuals knew that he had nothing to gain\r\nby trying to flatter me.\r\n\r\nFrom the first I have sought to impress the students with the idea that\r\nTuskegee is not my institution, or that of the officers, but that it is\r\ntheir institution, and that they have as much interest in it as any of\r\nthe trustees or instructors. I have further sought to have them feel\r\nthat I am at the institution as their friend and adviser, and not as\r\ntheir overseer. It has been my aim to have them speak with directness\r\nand frankness about anything that concerns the life of the school. Two\r\nor three times a year I ask the students to write me a letter\r\ncriticising or making complaints or suggestions about anything\r\nconnected with the institution. When this is not done, I have them meet\r\nme in the chapel for a heart-to-heart talk about the conduct of the\r\nschool. There are no meetings with our students that I enjoy more than\r\nthese, and none are more helpful to me in planning for the future.\r\nThese meetings, it seems to me, enable me to get at the very heart of\r\nall that concerns the school. Few things help an individual more than\r\nto place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust\r\nhim. When I have read of labour troubles between employers and\r\nemployees, I have often thought that many strikes and similar\r\ndisturbances might be avoided if the employers would cultivate the\r\nhabit of getting nearer to their employees, of consulting and advising\r\nwith them, and letting them feel that the interests of the two are the\r\nsame. Every individual responds to confidence, and this is not more\r\ntrue of any race than of the Negroes. Let them once understand that you\r\nare unselfishly interested in them, and you can lead them to any\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nIt was my aim from the first at Tuskegee to not only have the buildings\r\nerected by the students themselves, but to have them make their own\r\nfurniture as far as was possible. I now marvel at the patience of the\r\nstudents while sleeping upon the floor while waiting for some kind of a\r\nbedstead to be constructed, or at their sleeping without any kind of a\r\nmattress while waiting for something that looked like a mattress to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIn the early days we had very few students who had been used to\r\nhandling carpenters’ tools, and the bedsteads made by the students then\r\nwere very rough and very weak. Not unfrequently when I went into the\r\nstudents’ rooms in the morning I would find at least two bedsteads\r\nlying about on the floor. The problem of providing mattresses was a\r\ndifficult one to solve. We finally mastered this, however, by getting\r\nsome cheap cloth and sewing pieces of this together as to make large\r\nbags. These bags we filled with the pine straw—or, as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, pine needles—which we secured from the forests near by. I am\r\nglad to say that the industry of mattress-making has grown steadily\r\nsince then, and has been improved to such an extent that at the present\r\ntime it is an important branch of the work which is taught\r\nsystematically to a number of our girls, and that the mattresses that\r\nnow come out of the mattress-shop at Tuskegee are about as good as\r\nthose bought in the average store. For some time after the opening of\r\nthe boarding department we had no chairs in the students’ bedrooms or\r\nin the dining rooms. Instead of chairs we used stools which the\r\nstudents constructed by nailing together three pieces of rough board.\r\nAs a rule, the furniture in the students’ rooms during the early days\r\nof the school consisted of a bed, some stools, and sometimes a rough\r\ntable made by the students. The plan of having the students make the\r\nfurniture is still followed, but the number of pieces in a room has\r\nbeen increased, and the workmanship has so improved that little fault\r\ncan be found with the articles now. One thing that I have always\r\ninsisted upon at Tuskegee is that everywhere there should be absolute\r\ncleanliness. Over and over again the students were reminded in those\r\nfirst years—and are reminded now—that people would excuse us for our\r\npoverty, for our lack of comforts and conveniences, but that they would\r\nnot excuse us for dirt.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that has been insisted upon at the school is the use of\r\nthe tooth-brush. “The gospel of the tooth-brush,” as General Armstrong\r\nused to call it, is part of our creed at Tuskegee. No student is\r\npermitted to retain who does not keep and use a tooth-brush. Several\r\ntimes, in recent years, students have come to us who brought with them\r\nalmost no other article except a tooth-brush. They had heard from the\r\nlips of other students about our insisting upon the use of this, and\r\nso, to make a good impression, they brought at least a tooth-brush with\r\nthem. I remember that one morning, not long ago, I went with the lady\r\nprincipal on her usual morning tour of inspection of the girls’ rooms.\r\nWe found one room that contained three girls who had recently arrived\r\nat the school. When I asked them if they had tooth-brushes, one of the\r\ngirls replied, pointing to a brush: “Yes, sir. That is our brush. We\r\nbought it together, yesterday.” It did not take them long to learn a\r\ndifferent lesson.\r\n\r\nIt has been interesting to note the effect that the use of the\r\ntooth-brush has had in bringing about a higher degree of civilization\r\namong the students. With few exceptions, I have noticed that, if we can\r\nget a student to the point where, when the first or second tooth-brush\r\ndisappears, he of his own motion buys another, I have not been\r\ndisappointed in the future of that individual. Absolute cleanliness of\r\nthe body has been insisted upon from the first. The students have been\r\ntaught to bathe as regularly as to take their meals. This lesson we\r\nbegan teaching before we had anything in the shape of a bath-house.\r\nMost of the students came from plantation districts, and often we had\r\nto teach them how to sleep at night; that is, whether between the two\r\nsheets—after we got to the point where we could provide them two\r\nsheets—or under both of them. Naturally I found it difficult to teach\r\nthem to sleep between two sheets when we were able to supply but one.\r\nThe importance of the use of the night-gown received the same\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nFor a long time one of the most difficult tasks was to teach the\r\nstudents that all the buttons were to be kept on their clothes, and\r\nthat there must be no torn places or grease-spots. This lesson, I am\r\npleased to be able to say, has been so thoroughly learned and so\r\nfaithfully handed down from year to year by one set of students to\r\nanother that often at the present time, when the students march out of\r\nthe chapel in the evening and their dress is inspected, as it is every\r\nnight, not one button is found to be missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\nRaising Money\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we opened our boarding department, we provided rooms in the attic\r\nof Porter Hall, our first building, for a number of girls. But the\r\nnumber of students, of both sexes, continued to increase. We could find\r\nrooms outside the school grounds for many of the young men, but the\r\ngirls we did not care to expose in this way. Very soon the problem of\r\nproviding more rooms for the girls, as well as a larger boarding\r\ndepartment for all the students, grew serious. As a result, we finally\r\ndecided to undertake the construction of a still larger building—a\r\nbuilding that would contain rooms for the girls and boarding\r\naccommodations for all.\r\n\r\nAfter having had a preliminary sketch of the needed building made, we\r\nfound that it would cost about ten thousand dollars. We had no money\r\nwhatever with which to begin; still we decided to give the needed\r\nbuilding a name. We knew we could name it, even though we were in doubt\r\nabout our ability to secure the means for its construction. We decided\r\nto call the proposed building Alabama Hall, in honour of the state in\r\nwhich we were labouring. Again Miss Davidson began making efforts to\r\nenlist the interest and help of the coloured and white people in and\r\nnear Tuskegee. They responded willingly, in proportion to their means.\r\nThe students, as in the case of our first building, Porter Hall, began\r\ndigging out the dirt in order to allow the laying of the foundations.\r\n\r\nWhen we seemed at the end of our resources, so far as securing money\r\nwas concerned, something occurred which showed the greatness of General\r\nArmstrong—something which proved how far he was above the ordinary\r\nindividual. When we were in the midst of great anxiety as to where and\r\nhow we were to get funds for the new building, I received a telegram\r\nfrom General Armstrong asking me if I could spend a month travelling\r\nwith him through the North, and asking me, if I could do so, to come to\r\nHampton at once. Of course I accepted General Armstrong’s invitation,\r\nand went to Hampton immediately. On arriving there I found that the\r\nGeneral had decided to take a quartette of singers through the North,\r\nand hold meetings for a month in important cities, at which meetings he\r\nand I were to speak. Imagine my surprise when the General told me,\r\nfurther, that these meetings were to be held, not in the interests of\r\nHampton, but in the interests of Tuskegee, and that the Hampton\r\nInstitute was to be responsible for all the expenses.\r\n\r\nAlthough he never told me so in so many words, I found that General\r\nArmstrong took this method of introducing me to the people of the\r\nNorth, as well as for the sake of securing some immediate funds to be\r\nused in the erection of Alabama Hall. A weak and narrow man would have\r\nreasoned that all the money which came to Tuskegee in this way would be\r\njust so much taken from the Hampton Institute; but none of these\r\nselfish or short-sighted feelings ever entered the breast of General\r\nArmstrong. He was too big to be little, too good to be mean. He knew\r\nthat the people in the North who gave money gave it for the purpose of\r\nhelping the whole cause of Negro civilization, and not merely for the\r\nadvancement of any one school. The General knew, too, that the way to\r\nstrengthen Hampton was to make it a centre of unselfish power in the\r\nworking out of the whole Southern problem.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the addresses which I was to make in the North, I recall\r\njust one piece of advice which the General gave me. He said: “Give them\r\nan idea for every word.” I think it would be hard to improve upon this\r\nadvice; and it might be made to apply to all public speaking. From that\r\ntime to the present I have always tried to keep his advice in mind.\r\n\r\nMeetings were held in New York, Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, and\r\nother large cities, and at all of these meetings General Armstrong\r\npleaded, together with myself, for help, not for Hampton, but for\r\nTuskegee. At these meetings an especial effort was made to secure help\r\nfor the building of Alabama Hall, as well as to introduce the school to\r\nthe attention of the general public. In both these respects the\r\nmeetings proved successful.\r\n\r\nAfter that kindly introduction I began going North alone to secure\r\nfunds. During the last fifteen years I have been compelled to spend a\r\nlarge proportion of my time away from the school, in an effort to\r\nsecure money to provide for the growing needs of the institution. In my\r\nefforts to get funds I have had some experiences that may be of\r\ninterest to my readers. Time and time again I have been asked, by\r\npeople who are trying to secure money for philanthropic purposes, what\r\nrule or rules I followed to secure the interest and help of people who\r\nwere able to contribute money to worthy objects. As far as the science\r\nof what is called begging can be reduced to rules, I would say that I\r\nhave had but two rules. First, always to do my whole duty regarding\r\nmaking our work known to individuals and organizations; and, second,\r\nnot to worry about the results. This second rule has been the hardest\r\nfor me to live up to. When bills are on the eve of falling due, with\r\nnot a dollar in hand with which to meet them, it is pretty difficult to\r\nlearn not to worry, although I think I am learning more and more each\r\nyear that all worry simply consumes, and to no purpose, just so much\r\nphysical and mental strength that might otherwise be given to effective\r\nwork. After considerable experience in coming into contact with wealthy\r\nand noted men, I have observed that those who have accomplished the\r\ngreatest results are those who “keep under the body”; are those who\r\nnever grow excited or lose self-control, but are always calm,\r\nself-possessed, patient, and polite. I think that President William\r\nMcKinley is the best example of a man of this class that I have ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nIn order to be successful in any kind of undertaking, I think the main\r\nthing is for one to grow to the point where he completely forgets\r\nhimself; that is, to lose himself in a great cause. In proportion as\r\none loses himself in the way, in the same degree does he get the\r\nhighest happiness out of his work.\r\n\r\nMy experience in getting money for Tuskegee has taught me to have no\r\npatience with those people who are always condemning the rich because\r\nthey are rich, and because they do not give more to objects of charity.\r\nIn the first place, those who are guilty of such sweeping criticisms do\r\nnot know how many people would be made poor, and how much suffering\r\nwould result, if wealthy people were to part all at once with any large\r\nproportion of their wealth in a way to disorganize and cripple great\r\nbusiness enterprises. Then very few persons have any idea of the large\r\nnumber of applications for help that rich people are constantly being\r\nflooded with. I know wealthy people who receive as much as twenty calls\r\na day for help. More than once when I have gone into the offices of\r\nrich men, I have found half a dozen persons waiting to see them, and\r\nall come for the same purpose, that of securing money. And all these\r\ncalls in person, to say nothing of the applications received through\r\nthe mails. Very few people have any idea of the amount of money given\r\naway by persons who never permit their names to be known. I have often\r\nheard persons condemned for not giving away money, who, to my own\r\nknowledge, were giving away thousands of dollars every year so quietly\r\nthat the world knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAs an example of this, there are two ladies in New York, whose names\r\nrarely appear in print, but who, in a quiet way, have given us the\r\nmeans with which to erect three large and important buildings during\r\nthe last eight years. Besides the gift of these buildings, they have\r\nmade other generous donations to the school. And they not only help\r\nTuskegee, but they are constantly seeking opportunities to help other\r\nworthy causes.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been my privilege to be the medium through which a good\r\nmany hundred thousand dollars have been received for the work at\r\nTuskegee, I have always avoided what the world calls “begging.” I often\r\ntell people that I have never “begged” any money, and that I am not a\r\n“beggar.” My experience and observation have convinced me that\r\npersistent asking outright for money from the rich does not, as a rule,\r\nsecure help. I have usually proceeded on the principle that persons who\r\npossess sense enough to earn money have sense enough to know how to\r\ngive it away, and that the mere making known of the facts regarding\r\nTuskegee, and especially the facts regarding the work of the graduates,\r\nhas been more effective than outright begging. I think that the\r\npresentation of facts, on a high, dignified plane, is all the begging\r\nthat most rich people care for.\r\n\r\nWhile the work of going from door to door and from office to office is\r\nhard, disagreeable, and costly in bodily strength, yet it has some\r\ncompensations. Such work gives one a rare opportunity to study human\r\nnature. It also has its compensations in giving one an opportunity to\r\nmeet some of the best people in the world—to be more correct, I think I\r\nshould say the best people in the world. When one takes a broad survey\r\nof the country, he will find that the most useful and influential\r\npeople in it are those who take the deepest interest in institutions\r\nthat exist for the purpose of making the world better.\r\n\r\nAt one time, when I was in Boston, I called at the door of a rather\r\nwealthy lady, and was admitted to the vestibule and sent up my card.\r\nWhile I was waiting for an answer, her husband came in, and asked me in\r\nthe most abrupt manner what I wanted. When I tried to explain the\r\nobject of my call, he became still more ungentlemanly in his words and\r\nmanner, and finally grew so excited that I left the house without\r\nwaiting for a reply from the lady. A few blocks from that house I\r\ncalled to see a gentleman who received me in the most cordial manner.\r\nHe wrote me his check for a generous sum, and then, before I had had an\r\nopportunity to thank him, said: “I am so grateful to you, Mr.\r\nWashington, for giving me the opportunity to help a good cause. It is a\r\nprivilege to have a share in it. We in Boston are constantly indebted\r\nto you for doing our work.” My experience in securing money convinces\r\nme that the first type of man is growing more rare all the time, and\r\nthat the latter type is increasing; that is, that, more and more, rich\r\npeople are coming to regard men and women who apply to them for help\r\nfor worthy objects, not as beggars, but as agents for doing their work.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Boston I have rarely called upon an individual for funds\r\nthat I have not been thanked for calling, usually before I could get an\r\nopportunity to thank the donor for the money. In that city the donors\r\nseem to feel, in a large degree, that an honour is being conferred upon\r\nthem in their being permitted to give. Nowhere else have I met with, in\r\nso large a measure, this fine and Christlike spirit as in the city of\r\nBoston, although there are many notable instances of it outside that\r\ncity. I repeat my belief that the world is growing in the direction of\r\ngiving. I repeat that the main rule by which I have been guided in\r\ncollecting money is to do my full duty in regard to giving people who\r\nhave money an opportunity for help.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the Tuskegee school I walked the streets or\r\ntravelled country roads in the North for days and days without\r\nreceiving a dollar. Often as it happened, when during the week I had\r\nbeen disappointed in not getting a cent from the very individuals from\r\nwhom I most expected help, and when I was almost broken down and\r\ndiscouraged, that generous help has come from some one who I had had\r\nlittle idea would give at all.\r\n\r\nI recall that on one occasion I obtained information that led me to\r\nbelieve that a gentleman who lived about two miles out in the country\r\nfrom Stamford, Conn., might become interested in our efforts at\r\nTuskegee if our conditions and needs were presented to him. On an\r\nunusually cold and stormy day I walked the two miles to see him. After\r\nsome difficulty I succeeded in securing an interview with him. He\r\nlistened with some degree of interest to what I had to say, but did not\r\ngive me anything. I could not help having the feeling that, in a\r\nmeasure, the three hours that I had spent in seeing him had been thrown\r\naway. Still, I had followed my usual rule of doing my duty. If I had\r\nnot seen him, I should have felt unhappy over neglect of duty.\r\n\r\nTwo years after this visit a letter came to Tuskegee from this man,\r\nwhich read like this: “Enclosed I send you a New York draft for ten\r\nthousand dollars, to be used in furtherance of your work. I had placed\r\nthis sum in my will for your school, but deem it wiser to give it to\r\nyou while I live. I recall with pleasure your visit to me two years\r\nago.”\r\n\r\nI can hardly imagine any occurrence which could have given me more\r\ngenuine satisfaction than the receipt of this draft. It was by far the\r\nlargest single donation which up to that time the school had ever\r\nreceived. It came at a time when an unusually long period had passed\r\nsince we had received any money. We were in great distress because of\r\nlack of funds, and the nervous strain was tremendous. It is difficult\r\nfor me to think of any situation that is more trying on the nerves than\r\nthat of conducting a large institution, with heavy obligations to meet,\r\nwithout knowing where the money is to come from to meet these\r\nobligations from month to month.\r\n\r\nIn our case I felt a double responsibility, and this made the anxiety\r\nall the more intense. If the institution had been officered by white\r\npersons, and had failed, it would have injured the cause of Negro\r\neducation; but I knew that the failure of our institution, officered by\r\nNegroes, would not only mean the loss of a school, but would cause\r\npeople, in a large degree, to lose faith in the ability of the entire\r\nrace. The receipt of this draft for ten thousand dollars, under all\r\nthese circumstances, partially lifted a burden that had been pressing\r\ndown upon me for days.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of our work to the present I have always had the\r\nfeeling, and lose no opportunity to impress our teachers with the same\r\nidea, that the school will always be supported in proportion as the\r\ninside of the institution is kept clean and pure and wholesome.\r\n\r\nThe first time I ever saw the late Collis P. Huntington, the great\r\nrailroad man, he gave me two dollars for our school. The last time I\r\nsaw him, which was a few months before he died, he gave me fifty\r\nthousand dollars toward our endowment fund. Between these two gifts\r\nthere were others of generous proportions which came every year from\r\nboth Mr. and Mrs. Huntington.\r\n\r\nSome people may say that it was Tuskegee’s good luck that brought to us\r\nthis gift of fifty thousand dollars. No, it was not luck. It was hard\r\nwork. Nothing ever comes to me, that is worth having, except as the\r\nresult of hard work. When Mr. Huntington gave me the first two dollars,\r\nI did not blame him for not giving me more, but made up my mind that I\r\nwas going to convince him by tangible results that we were worthy of\r\nlarger gifts. For a dozen years I made a strong effort to convince Mr.\r\nHuntington of the value of our work. I noted that just in proportion as\r\nthe usefulness of the school grew, his donations increased. Never did I\r\nmeet an individual who took a more kindly and sympathetic interest in\r\nour school than did Mr. Huntington. He not only gave money to us, but\r\ntook time in which to advise me, as a father would a son, about the\r\ngeneral conduct of the school.\r\n\r\nMore than once I have found myself in some pretty tight places while\r\ncollecting money in the North. The following incident I have never\r\nrelated but once before, for the reason that I feared that people would\r\nnot believe it. One morning I found myself in Providence, Rhode Island,\r\nwithout a cent of money with which to buy breakfast. In crossing the\r\nstreet to see a lady from whom I hoped to get some money, I found a\r\nbright new twenty-five-cent piece in the middle of the street track. I\r\nnot only had this twenty-five cents for my breakfast, but within a few\r\nminutes I had a donation from the lady on whom I had started to call.\r\n\r\nAt one of our Commencements I was bold enough to invite the Rev. E.\r\nWinchester Donald, D.D., rector of Trinity Church, Boston, to preach\r\nthe Commencement sermon. As we then had no room large enough to\r\naccommodate all who would be present, the place of meeting was under a\r\nlarge improvised arbour, built partly of brush and partly of rough\r\nboards. Soon after Dr. Donald had begun speaking, the rain came down in\r\ntorrents, and he had to stop, while someone held an umbrella over him.\r\n\r\nThe boldness of what I had done never dawned upon me until I saw the\r\npicture made by the rector of Trinity Church standing before that large\r\naudience under an old umbrella, waiting for the rain to cease so that\r\nhe could go on with his address.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before the rain ceased and Dr. Donald finished his\r\nsermon; and an excellent sermon it was, too, in spite of the weather.\r\nAfter he had gone to his room, and had gotten the wet threads of his\r\nclothes dry, Dr. Donald ventured the remark that a large chapel at\r\nTuskegee would not be out of place. The next day a letter came from two\r\nladies who were then travelling in Italy, saying that they had decided\r\nto give us the money for such a chapel as we needed.\r\n\r\nA short time ago we received twenty thousand dollars from Mr. Andrew\r\nCarnegie, to be used for the purpose of erecting a new library\r\nbuilding. Our first library and reading-room were in a corner of a\r\nshanty, and the whole thing occupied a space about five by twelve feet.\r\nIt required ten years of work before I was able to secure Mr.\r\nCarnegie’s interest and help. The first time I saw him, ten years ago,\r\nhe seemed to take but little interest in our school, but I was\r\ndetermined to show him that we were worthy of his help. After ten years\r\nof hard work I wrote him a letter reading as follows:\r\n\r\nDecember 15, 1900.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Carnegie, 5 W. Fifty-first St., New York.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: Complying with the request which you made of me when I saw\r\nyou at your residence a few days ago, I now submit in writing an appeal\r\nfor a library building for our institution.\r\n\r\nWe have 1100 students, 86 officers and instructors, together with their\r\nfamilies, and about 200 coloured people living near the school, all of\r\nwhom would make use of the library building.\r\n\r\nWe have over 12,000 books, periodicals, etc., gifts from our friends,\r\nbut we have no suitable place for them, and we have no suitable\r\nreading-room.\r\n\r\nOur graduates go to work in every section of the South, and whatever\r\nknowledge might be obtained in the library would serve to assist in the\r\nelevation of the whole Negro race.\r\n\r\nSuch a building as we need could be erected for about $20,000. All of\r\nthe work for the building, such as brickmaking, brick-masonry,\r\ncarpentry, blacksmithing, etc., would be done by the students. The\r\nmoney which you would give would not only supply the building, but the\r\nerection of the building would give a large number of students an\r\nopportunity to learn the building trades, and the students would use\r\nthe money paid to them to keep themselves in school. I do not believe\r\nthat a similar amount of money often could be made go so far in\r\nuplifting a whole race.\r\n\r\nIf you wish further information, I shall be glad to furnish it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nBooker T. Washington, Principal.\r\n\r\nThe next mail brought back the following reply: “I will be very glad to\r\npay the bills for the library building as they are incurred, to the\r\nextent of twenty thousand dollars, and I am glad of this opportunity to\r\nshow the interest I have in your noble work.”\r\n\r\nI have found that strict business methods go a long way in securing the\r\ninterest of rich people. It has been my constant aim at Tuskegee to\r\ncarry out, in our financial and other operations, such business methods\r\nas would be approved of by any New York banking house.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of several large gifts to the school; but by far the\r\ngreater proportion of the money that has built up the institution has\r\ncome in the form of small donations from persons of moderate means. It\r\nis upon these small gifts, which carry with them the interest of\r\nhundreds of donors, that any philanthropic work must depend largely for\r\nits support. In my efforts to get money I have often been surprised at\r\nthe patience and deep interest of the ministers, who are besieged on\r\nevery hand and at all hours of the day for help. If no other\r\nconsideration had convinced me of the value of the Christian life, the\r\nChristlike work which the Church of all denominations in America has\r\ndone during the last thirty-five years for the elevation of the black\r\nman would have made me a Christian. In a large degree it has been the\r\npennies, the nickels, and the dimes which have come from the\r\nSunday-schools, the Christian Endeavour societies, and the missionary\r\nsocieties, as well as from the church proper, that have helped to\r\nelevate the Negro at so rapid a rate.\r\n\r\nThis speaking of small gifts reminds me to say that very few Tuskegee\r\ngraduates fail to send us an annual contribution. These contributions\r\nrange from twenty-five cents up to ten dollars.\r\n\r\nSoon after beginning our third year’s work we were surprised to receive\r\nmoney from three special sources, and up to the present time we have\r\ncontinued to receive help from them. First, the State Legislature of\r\nAlabama increased its annual appropriation from two thousand dollars to\r\nthree thousand dollars; I might add that still later it increased this\r\nsum to four thousand five hundred dollars a year. The effort to secure\r\nthis increase was led by the Hon. M.F. Foster, the member of the\r\nLegislature from Tuskegee. Second, we received one thousand dollars\r\nfrom the John F. Slater Fund. Our work seemed to please the trustees of\r\nthis fund, as they soon began increasing their annual grant. This has\r\nbeen added to from time to time until at present we receive eleven\r\nthousand dollars annually from the Fund. The other help to which I have\r\nreferred came in the shape of an allowance from the Peabody Fund. This\r\nwas at first five hundred dollars, but it has since been increased to\r\nfifteen hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe effort to secure help from the Slater and Peabody Funds brought me\r\ninto contact with two rare men—men who have had much to do in shaping\r\nthe policy for the education of the Negro. I refer to the Hon. J.L.M.\r\nCurry, of Washington, who is the general agent for these two funds, and\r\nMr. Morris K. Jessup, of New York. Dr. Curry is a native of the South,\r\nan ex-Confederate soldier, yet I do not believe there is any man in the\r\ncountry who is more deeply interested in the highest welfare of the\r\nNegro than Dr. Curry, or one who is more free from race prejudice. He\r\nenjoys the unique distinction of possessing to an equal degree the\r\nconfidence of the black man and the Southern white man. I shall never\r\nforget the first time I met him. It was in Richmond, Va., where he was\r\nthen living. I had heard much about him. When I first went into his\r\npresence, trembling because of my youth and inexperience, he took me by\r\nthe hand so cordially, and spoke such encouraging words, and gave me\r\nsuch helpful advice regarding the proper course to pursue, that I came\r\nto know him then, as I have known him ever since, as a high example of\r\none who is constantly and unselfishly at work for the betterment of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris K. Jessup, the treasurer of the Slater Fund, I refer to\r\nbecause I know of no man of wealth and large and complicated business\r\nresponsibilities who gives not only money but his time and thought to\r\nthe subject of the proper method of elevating the Negro to the extent\r\nthat is true of Mr. Jessup. It is very largely through this effort and\r\ninfluence that during the last few years the subject of industrial\r\neducation has assumed the importance that it has, and been placed on\r\nits present footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\nTwo Thousand Miles For A Five-Minute Speech\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the opening of our boarding department, quite a number of\r\nstudents who evidently were worthy, but who were so poor that they did\r\nnot have any money to pay even the small charges at the school, began\r\napplying for admission. This class was composed of both men and women.\r\nIt was a great trial to refuse admission to these applicants, and in\r\n1884 we established a night-school to accommodate a few of them.\r\n\r\nThe night-school was organized on a plan similar to the one which I had\r\nhelped to establish at Hampton. At first it was composed of about a\r\ndozen students. They were admitted to the night-school only when they\r\nhad no money with which to pay any part of their board in the regular\r\nday-school. It was further required that they must work for ten hours\r\nduring the day at some trade or industry, and study academic branches\r\nfor two hours during the evening. This was the requirement for the\r\nfirst one or two years of their stay. They were to be paid something\r\nabove the cost of their board, with the understanding that all of their\r\nearnings, except a very small part, were to be reserved in the school’s\r\ntreasury, to be used for paying their board in the regular day-school\r\nafter they had entered that department. The night-school, started in\r\nthis manner, has grown until there are at present four hundred and\r\nfifty-seven students enrolled in it alone.\r\n\r\nThere could hardly be a more severe test of a student’s worth than this\r\nbranch of the Institute’s work. It is largely because it furnishes such\r\na good opportunity to test the backbone of a student that I place such\r\nhigh value upon our night-school. Any one who is willing to work ten\r\nhours a day at the brick-yard, or in the laundry, through one or two\r\nyears, in order that he or she may have the privilege of studying\r\nacademic branches for two hours in the evening, has enough bottom to\r\nwarrant being further educated.\r\n\r\nAfter the student has left the night-school he enters the day-school,\r\nwhere he takes academic branches four days in a week, and works at his\r\ntrade two days. Besides this he usually works at his trade during the\r\nthree summer months. As a rule, after a student has succeeded in going\r\nthrough the night-school test, he finds a way to finish the regular\r\ncourse in industrial and academic training. No student, no matter how\r\nmuch money he may be able to command, is permitted to go through school\r\nwithout doing manual labour. In fact, the industrial work is now as\r\npopular as the academic branches. Some of the most successful men and\r\nwomen who have graduated from the institution obtained their start in\r\nthe night-school.\r\n\r\nWhile a great deal of stress is laid upon the industrial side of the\r\nwork at Tuskegee, we do not neglect or overlook in any degree the\r\nreligious and spiritual side. The school is strictly undenominational,\r\nbut it is thoroughly Christian, and the spiritual training of the\r\nstudents is not neglected. Our preaching service, prayer-meetings,\r\nSunday-school, Christian Endeavour Society, Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociation, and various missionary organizations, testify to this.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, Miss Olivia Davidson, to whom I have already referred as being\r\nlargely responsible for the success of the school during its early\r\nhistory, and I were married. During our married life she continued to\r\ndivide her time and strength between our home and the work for the\r\nschool. She not only continued to work in the school at Tuskegee, but\r\nalso kept up her habit of going North to secure funds. In 1889 she\r\ndied, after four years of happy married life and eight years of hard\r\nand happy work for the school. She literally wore herself out in her\r\nnever ceasing efforts in behalf of the work that she so dearly loved.\r\nDuring our married life there were born to us two bright, beautiful\r\nboys, Booker Taliaferro and Ernest Davidson. The older of these,\r\nBooker, has already mastered the brick-maker’s trade at Tuskegee.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked how I began the practice of public speaking. In\r\nanswer I would say that I never planned to give any large part of my\r\nlife to speaking in public. I have always had more of an ambition to\r\n_do_ things than merely to talk _about_ doing them. It seems that when\r\nI went North with General Armstrong to speak at the series of public\r\nmeetings to which I have referred, the President of the National\r\nEducational Association, the Hon. Thomas W. Bicknell, was present at\r\none of those meetings and heard me speak. A few days afterward he sent\r\nme an invitation to deliver an address at the next meeting of the\r\nEducational Association. This meeting was to be held in Madison, Wis. I\r\naccepted the invitation. This was, in a sense, the beginning of my\r\npublic-speaking career.\r\n\r\nOn the evening that I spoke before the Association there must have been\r\nnot far from four thousand persons present. Without my knowing it,\r\nthere were a large number of people present from Alabama, and some from\r\nthe town of Tuskegee. These white people afterward frankly told me that\r\nthey went to this meeting expecting to hear the South roundly abused,\r\nbut were pleasantly surprised to find that there was no word of abuse\r\nin my address. On the contrary, the South was given credit for all the\r\npraiseworthy things that it had done. A white lady who was teacher in a\r\ncollege in Tuskegee wrote back to the local paper that she was\r\ngratified, as well as surprised, to note the credit which I gave the\r\nwhite people of Tuskegee for their help in getting the school started.\r\nThis address at Madison was the first that I had delivered that in any\r\nlarge measure dealt with the general problem of the races. Those who\r\nheard it seemed to be pleased with what I said and with the general\r\nposition that I took.\r\n\r\nWhen I first came to Tuskegee, I determined that I would make it my\r\nhome, that I would take as much pride in the right actions of the\r\npeople of the town as any white man could do, and that I would, at the\r\nsame time, deplore the wrong-doing of the people as much as any white\r\nman. I determined never to say anything in a public address in the\r\nNorth that I would not be willing to say in the South. I early learned\r\nthat it is a hard matter to convert an individual by abusing him, and\r\nthat this is more often accomplished by giving credit for all the\r\npraiseworthy actions performed than by calling attention alone to all\r\nthe evil done.\r\n\r\nWhile pursuing this policy I have not failed, at the proper time and in\r\nthe proper manner, to call attention, in no uncertain terms, to the\r\nwrongs which any part of the South has been guilty of. I have found\r\nthat there is a large element in the South that is quick to respond to\r\nstraightforward, honest criticism of any wrong policy. As a rule, the\r\nplace to criticise the South, when criticism is necessary, is in the\r\nSouth—not in Boston. A Boston man who came to Alabama to criticise\r\nBoston would not effect so much good, I think, as one who had his word\r\nof criticism to say in Boston.\r\n\r\nIn this address at Madison I took the ground that the policy to be\r\npursued with references to the races was, by every honourable means, to\r\nbring them together and to encourage the cultivation of friendly\r\nrelations, instead of doing that which would embitter. I further\r\ncontended that, in relation to his vote, the Negro should more and more\r\nconsider the interests of the community in which he lived, rather than\r\nseek alone to please some one who lived a thousand miles away from him\r\nand from his interests.\r\n\r\nIn this address I said that the whole future of the Negro rested\r\nlargely upon the question as to whether or not he should make himself,\r\nthrough his skill, intelligence, and character, of such undeniable\r\nvalue to the community in which he lived that the community could not\r\ndispense with his presence. I said that any individual who learned to\r\ndo something better than anybody else—learned to do a common thing in\r\nan uncommon manner—had solved his problem, regardless of the colour of\r\nhis skin, and that in proportion as the Negro learned to produce what\r\nother people wanted and must have, in the same proportion would he be\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nI spoke of an instance where one of our graduates had produced two\r\nhundred and sixty-six bushels of sweet potatoes from an acre of ground,\r\nin a community where the average production had been only forty-nine\r\nbushels to the acre. He had been able to do this by reason of his\r\nknowledge of the chemistry of the soil and by his knowledge of improved\r\nmethods of agriculture. The white farmers in the neighbourhood\r\nrespected him, and came to him for ideas regarding the raising of sweet\r\npotatoes. These white farmers honoured and respected him because he, by\r\nhis skill and knowledge, had added something to the wealth and the\r\ncomfort of the community in which he lived. I explained that my theory\r\nof education for the Negro would not, for example, confine him for all\r\ntime to farm life—to the production of the best and the most sweet\r\npotatoes—but that, if he succeeded in this line of industry, he could\r\nlay the foundations upon which his children and grand-children could\r\ngrow to higher and more important things in life.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, were some of the views I advocated in this first\r\naddress dealing with the broad question of the relations of the two\r\nraces, and since that time I have not found any reason for changing my\r\nviews on any important point.\r\n\r\nIn my early life I used to cherish a feeling of ill will toward any one\r\nwho spoke in bitter terms against the Negro, or who advocated measures\r\nthat tended to oppress the black man or take from him opportunities for\r\ngrowth in the most complete manner. Now, whenever I hear any one\r\nadvocating measures that are meant to curtail the development of\r\nanother, I pity the individual who would do this. I know that the one\r\nwho makes this mistake does so because of his own lack of opportunity\r\nfor the highest kind of growth. I pity him because I know that he is\r\ntrying to stop the progress of the world, and because I know that in\r\ntime the development and the ceaseless advance of humanity will make\r\nhim ashamed of his weak and narrow position. One might as well try to\r\nstop the progress of a mighty railroad train by throwing his body\r\nacross the track, as to try to stop the growth of the world in the\r\ndirection of giving mankind more intelligence, more culture, more\r\nskill, more liberty, and in the direction of extending more sympathy\r\nand more brotherly kindness.\r\n\r\nThe address which I delivered at Madison, before the National\r\nEducational Association, gave me a rather wide introduction in the\r\nNorth, and soon after that opportunities began offering themselves for\r\nme to address audiences there.\r\n\r\nI was anxious, however, that the way might also be opened for me to\r\nspeak directly to a representative Southern white audience. A partial\r\nopportunity of this kind, one that seemed to me might serve as an\r\nentering wedge, presented itself in 1893, when the international\r\nmeeting of Christian Workers was held at Atlanta, Ga. When this\r\ninvitation came to me, I had engagements in Boston that seemed to make\r\nit impossible for me to speak in Atlanta. Still, after looking over my\r\nlist of dates and places carefully, I found that I could take a train\r\nfrom Boston that would get me into Atlanta about thirty minutes before\r\nmy address was to be delivered, and that I could remain in that city\r\nbefore taking another train for Boston. My invitation to speak in\r\nAtlanta stipulated that I was to confine my address to five minutes.\r\nThe question, then, was whether or not I could put enough into a\r\nfive-minute address to make it worth while for me to make such a trip.\r\n\r\nI knew that the audience would be largely composed of the most\r\ninfluential class of white men and women, and that it would be a rare\r\nopportunity for me to let them know what we were trying to do at\r\nTuskegee, as well as to speak to them about the relations of the races.\r\nSo I decided to make the trip. I spoke for five minutes to an audience\r\nof two thousand people, composed mostly of Southern and Northern\r\nwhites. What I said seemed to be received with favour and enthusiasm.\r\nThe Atlanta papers of the next day commented in friendly terms on my\r\naddress, and a good deal was said about it in different parts of the\r\ncountry. I felt that I had in some degree accomplished my object—that\r\nof getting a hearing from the dominant class of the South.\r\n\r\nThe demands made upon me for public addresses continued to increase,\r\ncoming in about equal numbers from my own people and from Northern\r\nwhites. I gave as much time to these addresses as I could spare from\r\nthe immediate work at Tuskegee. Most of the addresses in the North were\r\nmade for the direct purpose of getting funds with which to support the\r\nschool. Those delivered before the coloured people had for their main\r\nobject the impressing upon them the importance of industrial and\r\ntechnical education in addition to academic and religious training.\r\n\r\nI now come to that one of the incidents in my life which seems to have\r\nexcited the greatest amount of interest, and which perhaps went further\r\nthan anything else in giving me a reputation that in a sense might be\r\ncalled National. I refer to the address which I delivered at the\r\nopening of the Atlanta Cotton states and International Exposition, at\r\nAtlanta, Ga., September 18, 1895.\r\n\r\nSo much has been said and written about this incident, and so many\r\nquestions have been asked me concerning the address, that perhaps I may\r\nbe excused for taking up the matter with some detail. The five-minute\r\naddress in Atlanta, which I came from Boston to deliver, was possibly\r\nthe prime cause for an opportunity being given me to make the second\r\naddress there. In the spring of 1895 I received a telegram from\r\nprominent citizens in Atlanta asking me to accompany a committee from\r\nthat city to Washington for the purpose of appearing before a committee\r\nof Congress in the interest of securing Government help for the\r\nExposition. The committee was composed of about twenty-five of the most\r\nprominent and most influential white men of Georgia. All the members of\r\nthis committee were white men except Bishop Grant, Bishop Gaines, and\r\nmyself. The Mayor and several other city and state officials spoke\r\nbefore the committee. They were followed by the two coloured bishops.\r\nMy name was the last on the list of speakers. I had never before\r\nappeared before such a committee, nor had I ever delivered any address\r\nin the capital of the Nation. I had many misgivings as to what I ought\r\nto say, and as to the impression that my address would make. While I\r\ncannot recall in detail what I said, I remember that I tried to impress\r\nupon the committee, with all the earnestness and plainness of any\r\nlanguage that I could command, that if Congress wanted to do something\r\nwhich would assist in ridding the South of the race question and making\r\nfriends between the two races, it should, in every proper way,\r\nencourage the material and intellectual growth of both races. I said\r\nthat the Atlanta Exposition would present an opportunity for both races\r\nto show what advance they had made since freedom, and would at the same\r\ntime afford encouragement to them to make still greater progress.\r\n\r\nI tried to emphasize the fact that while the Negro should not be\r\ndeprived by unfair means of the franchise, political agitation alone\r\nwould not save him, and that back of the ballot he must have property,\r\nindustry, skill, economy, intelligence, and character, and that no race\r\nwithout these elements could permanently succeed. I said that in\r\ngranting the appropriation Congress could do something that would prove\r\nto be of real and lasting value to both races, and that it was the\r\nfirst great opportunity of the kind that had been presented since the\r\nclose of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI spoke for fifteen or twenty minutes, and was surprised at the close\r\nof my address to receive the hearty congratulations of the Georgia\r\ncommittee and of the members of Congress who were present. The\r\nCommittee was unanimous in making a favourable report, and in a few\r\ndays the bill passed Congress. With the passing of this bill the\r\nsuccess of the Atlanta Exposition was assured.\r\n\r\nSoon after this trip to Washington the directors of the Exposition\r\ndecided that it would be a fitting recognition of the coloured race to\r\nerect a large and attractive building which should be devoted wholly to\r\nshowing the progress of the Negro since freedom. It was further decided\r\nto have the building designed and erected wholly by Negro mechanics.\r\nThis plan was carried out. In design, beauty, and general finish the\r\nNegro Building was equal to the others on the grounds.\r\n\r\nAfter it was decided to have a separate Negro exhibit, the question\r\narose as to who should take care of it. The officials of the Exposition\r\nwere anxious that I should assume this responsibility, but I declined\r\nto do so, on the plea that the work at Tuskegee at that time demanded\r\nmy time and strength. Largely at my suggestion, Mr. I. Garland Penn, of\r\nLynchburg, Va., was selected to be at the head of the Negro department.\r\nI gave him all the aid that I could. The Negro exhibit, as a whole, was\r\nlarge and creditable. The two exhibits in this department which\r\nattracted the greatest amount of attention were those from the Hampton\r\nInstitute and the Tuskegee Institute. The people who seemed to be the\r\nmost surprised, as well as pleased, at what they saw in the Negro\r\nBuilding were the Southern white people.\r\n\r\nAs the day for the opening of the Exposition drew near, the Board of\r\nDirectors began preparing the programme for the opening exercises. In\r\nthe discussion from day to day of the various features of this\r\nprogramme, the question came up as to the advisability of putting a\r\nmember of the Negro race on for one of the opening addresses, since the\r\nNegroes had been asked to take such a prominent part in the Exposition.\r\nIt was argued, further, that such recognition would mark the good\r\nfeeling prevailing between the two races. Of course there were those\r\nwho were opposed to any such recognition of the rights of the Negro,\r\nbut the Board of Directors, composed of men who represented the best\r\nand most progressive element in the South, had their way, and voted to\r\ninvite a black man to speak on the opening day. The next thing was to\r\ndecide upon the person who was thus to represent the Negro race. After\r\nthe question had been canvassed for several days, the directors voted\r\nunanimously to ask me to deliver one of the opening-day addresses, and\r\nin a few days after that I received the official invitation.\r\n\r\nThe receiving of this invitation brought to me a sense of\r\nresponsibility that it would be hard for any one not placed in my\r\nposition to appreciate. What were my feelings when this invitation came\r\nto me? I remembered that I had been a slave; that my early years had\r\nbeen spent in the lowest depths of poverty and ignorance, and that I\r\nhad had little opportunity to prepare me for such a responsibility as\r\nthis. It was only a few years before that time that any white man in\r\nthe audience might have claimed me as his slave; and it was easily\r\npossible that some of my former owners might be present to hear me\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nI knew, too, that this was the first time in the entire history of the\r\nNegro that a member of my race had been asked to speak from the same\r\nplatform with white Southern men and women on any important National\r\noccasion. I was asked now to speak to an audience composed of the\r\nwealth and culture of the white South, the representatives of my former\r\nmasters. I knew, too, that while the greater part of my audience would\r\nbe composed of Southern people, yet there would be present a large\r\nnumber of Northern whites, as well as a great many men and women of my\r\nown race.\r\n\r\nI was determined to say nothing that I did not feel from the bottom of\r\nmy heart to be true and right. When the invitation came to me, there\r\nwas not one word of intimation as to what I should say or as to what I\r\nshould omit. In this I felt that the Board of Directors had paid a\r\ntribute to me. They knew that by one sentence I could have blasted, in\r\na large degree, the success of the Exposition. I was also painfully\r\nconscious of the fact that, while I must be true to my own race in my\r\nutterances, I had it in my power to make such an ill-timed address as\r\nwould result in preventing any similar invitation being extended to a\r\nblack man again for years to come. I was equally determined to be true\r\nto the North, as well as to the best element of the white South, in\r\nwhat I had to say.\r\n\r\nThe papers, North and South, had taken up the discussion of my coming\r\nspeech, and as the time for it drew near this discussion became more\r\nand more widespread. Not a few of the Southern white papers were\r\nunfriendly to the idea of my speaking. From my own race I received many\r\nsuggestions as to what I ought to say. I prepared myself as best I\r\ncould for the address, but as the eighteenth of September drew nearer,\r\nthe heavier my heart became, and the more I feared that my effort would\r\nprove a failure and a disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe invitation had come at a time when I was very busy with my school\r\nwork, as it was the beginning of our school year. After preparing my\r\naddress, I went through it, as I usually do with those utterances which\r\nI consider particularly important, with Mrs. Washington, and she\r\napproved of what I intended to say. On the sixteenth of September, the\r\nday before I was to start for Atlanta, so many of the Tuskegee teachers\r\nexpressed a desire to hear my address that I consented to read it to\r\nthem in a body. When I had done so, and had heard their criticisms and\r\ncomments, I felt somewhat relieved, since they seemed to think well of\r\nwhat I had to say.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 17, together with Mrs. Washington and my\r\nthree children, I started for Atlanta. I felt a good deal as I suppose\r\na man feels when he is on his way to the gallows. In passing through\r\nthe town of Tuskegee I met a white farmer who lived some distance out\r\nin the country. In a jesting manner this man said: “Washington, you\r\nhave spoken before the Northern white people, the Negroes in the South,\r\nand to us country white people in the South; but Atlanta, to-morrow,\r\nyou will have before you the Northern whites, the Southern whites, and\r\nthe Negroes all together. I am afraid that you have got yourself in a\r\ntight place.” This farmer diagnosed the situation correctly, but his\r\nfrank words did not add anything to my comfort.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the journey from Tuskegee to Atlanta both coloured and\r\nwhite people came to the train to point me out, and discussed with\r\nperfect freedom, in my hearings, what was going to take place the next\r\nday. We were met by a committee in Atlanta. Almost the first thing that\r\nI heard when I got off the train in that city was an expression\r\nsomething like this, from an old coloured man near by: “Dat’s de man of\r\nmy race what’s gwine to make a speech at de Exposition to-morrow. I’se\r\nsho’ gwine to hear him.”\r\n\r\nAtlanta was literally packed, at the time, with people from all parts\r\nof the country, and with representatives of foreign governments, as\r\nwell as with military and civic organizations. The afternoon papers had\r\nforecasts of the next day’s proceedings in flaring headlines. All this\r\ntended to add to my burden. I did not sleep much that night. The next\r\nmorning, before day, I went carefully over what I planned to say. I\r\nalso kneeled down and asked God’s blessing upon my effort. Right here,\r\nperhaps, I ought to add that I make it a rule never to go before an\r\naudience, on any occasion, without asking the blessing of God upon what\r\nI want to say.\r\n\r\nI always make it a rule to make especial preparation for each separate\r\naddress. No two audiences are exactly alike. It is my aim to reach and\r\ntalk to the heart of each individual audience, taking it into my\r\nconfidence very much as I would a person. When I am speaking to an\r\naudience, I care little for how what I am saying is going to sound in\r\nthe newspapers, or to another audience, or to an individual. At the\r\ntime, the audience before me absorbs all my sympathy, thought, and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning a committee called to escort me to my place in the\r\nprocession which was to march to the Exposition grounds. In this\r\nprocession were prominent coloured citizens in carriages, as well as\r\nseveral Negro military organizations. I noted that the Exposition\r\nofficials seemed to go out of their way to see that all of the coloured\r\npeople in the procession were properly placed and properly treated. The\r\nprocession was about three hours in reaching the Exposition grounds,\r\nand during all of this time the sun was shining down upon us\r\ndisagreeably hot. When we reached the grounds, the heat, together with\r\nmy nervous anxiety, made me feel as if I were about ready to collapse,\r\nand to feel that my address was not going to be a success. When I\r\nentered the audience-room, I found it packed with humanity from bottom\r\nto top, and there were thousands outside who could not get in.\r\n\r\nThe room was very large, and well suited to public speaking. When I\r\nentered the room, there were vigorous cheers from the coloured portion\r\nof the audience, and faint cheers from some of the white people. I had\r\nbeen told, while I had been in Atlanta, that while many white people\r\nwere going to be present to hear me speak, simply out of curiosity, and\r\nthat others who would be present would be in full sympathy with me,\r\nthere was a still larger element of the audience which would consist of\r\nthose who were going to be present for the purpose of hearing me make a\r\nfool of myself, or, at least, of hearing me say some foolish thing so\r\nthat they could say to the officials who had invited me to speak, “I\r\ntold you so!”\r\n\r\nOne of the trustees of the Tuskegee Institute, as well as my personal\r\nfriend, Mr. William H. Baldwin, Jr. was at the time General Manager of\r\nthe Southern Railroad, and happened to be in Atlanta on that day. He\r\nwas so nervous about the kind of reception that I would have, and the\r\neffect that my speech would produce, that he could not persuade himself\r\nto go into the building, but walked back and forth in the grounds\r\noutside until the opening exercises were over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\nThe Atlanta Exposition Address\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta Exposition, at which I had been asked to make an address as\r\na representative of the Negro race, as stated in the last chapter, was\r\nopened with a short address from Governor Bullock. After other\r\ninteresting exercises, including an invocation from Bishop Nelson, of\r\nGeorgia, a dedicatory ode by Albert Howell, Jr., and addresses by the\r\nPresident of the Exposition and Mrs. Joseph Thompson, the President of\r\nthe Woman’s Board, Governor Bullock introduce me with the words, “We\r\nhave with us to-day a representative of Negro enterprise and Negro\r\ncivilization.”\r\n\r\nWhen I arose to speak, there was considerable cheering, especially from\r\nthe coloured people. As I remember it now, the thing that was uppermost\r\nin my mind was the desire to say something that would cement the\r\nfriendship of the races and bring about hearty cooperation between\r\nthem. So far as my outward surroundings were concerned, the only thing\r\nthat I recall distinctly now is that when I got up, I saw thousands of\r\neyes looking intently into my face. The following is the address which\r\nI delivered:—\r\n\r\nMr. President and Gentlemen of the Board of Directors and Citizens.\r\n\r\nOne-third of the population of the South is of the Negro race. No\r\nenterprise seeking the material, civil, or moral welfare of this\r\nsection can disregard this element of our population and reach the\r\nhighest success. I but convey to you, Mr. President and Directors, the\r\nsentiment of the masses of my race when I say that in no way have the\r\nvalue and manhood of the American Negro been more fittingly and\r\ngenerously recognized than by the managers of this magnificent\r\nExposition at every stage of its progress. It is a recognition that\r\nwill do more to cement the friendship of the two races than any\r\noccurrence since the dawn of our freedom.\r\n\r\nNot only this, but the opportunity here afforded will awaken among us a\r\nnew era of industrial progress. Ignorant and inexperienced, it is not\r\nstrange that in the first years of our new life we began at the top\r\ninstead of at the bottom; that a seat in Congress or the state\r\nlegislature was more sought than real estate or industrial skill; that\r\nthe political convention or stump speaking had more attractions than\r\nstarting a dairy farm or truck garden.\r\n\r\nA ship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly vessel.\r\nFrom the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal, “Water,\r\nwater; we die of thirst!” The answer from the friendly vessel at once\r\ncame back, “Cast down your bucket where you are.” A second time the\r\nsignal, “Water, water; send us water!” ran up from the distressed\r\nvessel, and was answered, “Cast down your bucket where you are.” And a\r\nthird and fourth signal for water was answered, “Cast down your bucket\r\nwhere you are.” The captain of the distressed vessel, at last heeding\r\nthe injunction, cast down his bucket, and it came up full of fresh,\r\nsparkling water from the mouth of the Amazon River. To those of my race\r\nwho depend on bettering their condition in a foreign land or who\r\nunderestimate the importance of cultivating friendly relations with the\r\nSouthern white man, who is their next-door neighbour, I would say:\r\n“Cast down your bucket where you are”—cast it down in making friends in\r\nevery manly way of the people of all races by whom we are surrounded.\r\n\r\nCast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in domestic\r\nservice, and in the professions. And in this connection it is well to\r\nbear in mind that whatever other sins the South may be called to bear,\r\nwhen it comes to business, pure and simple, it is in the South that the\r\nNegro is given a man’s chance in the commercial world, and in nothing\r\nis this Exposition more eloquent than in emphasizing this chance. Our\r\ngreatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we\r\nmay overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the\r\nproductions of our hands, and fail to keep in mind that we shall\r\nprosper in proportion as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour\r\nand put brains and skill into the common occupations of life; shall\r\nprosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between the\r\nsuperficial and the substantial, the ornamental gewgaws of life and the\r\nuseful. No race can prosper till it learns that there is as much\r\ndignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem. It is at the bottom of\r\nlife we must begin, and not at the top. Nor should we permit our\r\ngrievances to overshadow our opportunities.\r\n\r\nTo those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign\r\nbirth and strange tongue and habits of the prosperity of the South,\r\nwere I permitted I would repeat what I say to my own race: “Cast down\r\nyour bucket where you are.” Cast it down among the eight millions of\r\nNegroes whose habits you know, whose fidelity and love you have tested\r\nin days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your\r\nfiresides. Cast down your bucket among these people who have, without\r\nstrikes and labour wars, tilled your fields, cleared your forests,\r\nbuilded your railroads and cities, and brought forth treasures from the\r\nbowels of the earth, and helped make possible this magnificent\r\nrepresentation of the progress of the South. Casting down your bucket\r\namong my people, helping and encouraging them as you are doing on these\r\ngrounds, and to education of head, hand, and heart, you will find that\r\nthey will buy your surplus land, make blossom the waste places in your\r\nfields, and run your factories. While doing this, you can be sure in\r\nthe future, as in the past, that you and your families will be\r\nsurrounded by the most patient, faithful, law-abiding, and unresentful\r\npeople that the world has seen. As we have proved our loyalty to you in\r\nthe past, nursing your children, watching by the sick-bed of your\r\nmothers and fathers, and often following them with tear-dimmed eyes to\r\ntheir graves, so in the future, in our humble way, we shall stand by\r\nyou with a devotion that no foreigner can approach, ready to lay down\r\nour lives, if need be, in defence of yours, interlacing our industrial,\r\ncommercial, civil, and religious life with yours in a way that shall\r\nmake the interests of both races one. In all things that are purely\r\nsocial we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all\r\nthings essential to mutual progress.\r\n\r\nThere is no defence or security for any of us except in the highest\r\nintelligence and development of all. If anywhere there are efforts\r\ntending to curtail the fullest growth of the Negro, let these efforts\r\nbe turned into stimulating, encouraging, and making him the most useful\r\nand intelligent citizen. Effort or means so invested will pay a\r\nthousand per cent interest. These efforts will be twice\r\nblessed—“blessing him that gives and him that takes.”\r\n\r\nThere is no escape through law of man or God from the inevitable:—\r\n\r\n    The laws of changeless justice bind\r\n        Oppressor with oppressed;\r\n    And close as sin and suffering joined\r\n        We march to fate abreast.\r\n\r\nNearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load\r\nupward, or they will pull against you the load downward. We shall\r\nconstitute one-third and more of the ignorance and crime of the South,\r\nor one-third its intelligence and progress; we shall contribute\r\none-third to the business and industrial prosperity of the South, or we\r\nshall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing,\r\nretarding every effort to advance the body politic.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Exposition, as we present to you our humble effort at\r\nan exhibition of our progress, you must not expect overmuch. Starting\r\nthirty years ago with ownership here and there in a few quilts and\r\npumpkins and chickens (gathered from miscellaneous sources), remember\r\nthe path that has led from these to the inventions and production of\r\nagricultural implements, buggies, steam-engines, newspapers, books,\r\nstatuary, carving, paintings, the management of drug-stores and banks,\r\nhas not been trodden without contact with thorns and thistles. While we\r\ntake pride in what we exhibit as a result of our independent efforts,\r\nwe do not for a moment forget that our part in this exhibition would\r\nfall far short of your expectations but for the constant help that has\r\ncome to our education life, not only from the Southern states, but\r\nespecially from Northern philanthropists, who have made their gifts a\r\nconstant stream of blessing and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of\r\nsocial equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the\r\nenjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result\r\nof severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing. No\r\nrace that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is\r\nlong in any degree ostracized. It is important and right that all\r\nprivileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more important that we\r\nbe prepared for the exercises of these privileges. The opportunity to\r\nearn a dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the\r\nopportunity to spend a dollar in an opera-house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, may I repeat that nothing in thirty years has given us\r\nmore hope and encouragement, and drawn us so near to you of the white\r\nrace, as this opportunity offered by the Exposition; and here bending,\r\nas it were, over the altar that represents the results of the struggles\r\nof your race and mine, both starting practically empty-handed three\r\ndecades ago, I pledge that in your effort to work out the great and\r\nintricate problem which God has laid at the doors of the South, you\r\nshall have at all times the patient, sympathetic help of my race; only\r\nlet this be constantly in mind, that, while from representations in\r\nthese buildings of the product of field, of forest, of mine, of\r\nfactory, letters, and art, much good will come, yet far above and\r\nbeyond material benefits will be that higher good, that, let us pray\r\nGod, will come, in a blotting out of sectional differences and racial\r\nanimosities and suspicions, in a determination to administer absolute\r\njustice, in a willing obedience among all classes to the mandates of\r\nlaw. This, this, coupled with our material prosperity, will bring into\r\nour beloved South a new heaven and a new earth.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I remember, after I had finished speaking, was\r\nthat Governor Bullock rushed across the platform and took me by the\r\nhand, and that others did the same. I received so many and such hearty\r\ncongratulations that I found it difficult to get out of the building. I\r\ndid not appreciate to any degree, however, the impression which my\r\naddress seemed to have made, until the next morning, when I went into\r\nthe business part of the city. As soon as I was recognized, I was\r\nsurprised to find myself pointed out and surrounded by a crowd of men\r\nwho wished to shake hands with me. This was kept up on every street on\r\nto which I went, to an extent which embarrassed me so much that I went\r\nback to my boarding-place. The next morning I returned to Tuskegee. At\r\nthe station in Atlanta, and at almost all of the stations at which the\r\ntrain stopped between that city and Tuskegee, I found a crowd of people\r\nanxious to shake hands with me.\r\n\r\nThe papers in all parts of the United States published the address in\r\nfull, and for months afterward there were complimentary editorial\r\nreferences to it. Mr. Clark Howell, the editor of the Atlanta\r\nConstitution, telegraphed to a New York paper, among other words, the\r\nfollowing, “I do not exaggerate when I say that Professor Booker T.\r\nWashington’s address yesterday was one of the most notable speeches,\r\nboth as to character and as to the warmth of its reception, ever\r\ndelivered to a Southern audience. The address was a revelation. The\r\nwhole speech is a platform upon which blacks and whites can stand with\r\nfull justice to each other.”\r\n\r\nThe Boston Transcript said editorially: “The speech of Booker T.\r\nWashington at the Atlanta Exposition, this week, seems to have dwarfed\r\nall the other proceedings and the Exposition itself. The sensation that\r\nit has caused in the press has never been equalled.”\r\n\r\nI very soon began receiving all kinds of propositions from lecture\r\nbureaus, and editors of magazines and papers, to take the lecture\r\nplatform, and to write articles. One lecture bureau offered me fifty\r\nthousand dollars, or two hundred dollars a night and expenses, if I\r\nwould place my services at its disposal for a given period. To all\r\nthese communications I replied that my life-work was at Tuskegee; and\r\nthat whenever I spoke it must be in the interests of Tuskegee school\r\nand my race, and that I would enter into no arrangements that seemed to\r\nplace a mere commercial value upon my services.\r\n\r\nSome days after its delivery I sent a copy of my address to the\r\nPresident of the United States, the Hon. Grover Cleveland. I received\r\nfrom him the following autograph reply:—\r\n\r\nGray Gables, Buzzard’s Bay, Mass.,\r\n\r\nOctober 6, 1895.\r\n\r\nBooker T. Washington, Esq.:\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir: I thank you for sending me a copy of your address\r\ndelivered at the Atlanta Exposition.\r\n\r\nI thank you with much enthusiasm for making the address. I have read it\r\nwith intense interest, and I think the Exposition would be fully\r\njustified if it did not do more than furnish the opportunity for its\r\ndelivery. Your words cannot fail to delight and encourage all who wish\r\nwell for your race; and if our coloured fellow-citizens do not from\r\nyour utterances gather new hope and form new determinations to gain\r\nevery valuable advantage offered them by their citizenship, it will be\r\nstrange indeed.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland.\r\n\r\nLater I met Mr. Cleveland, for the first time, when, as President, he\r\nvisited the Atlanta Exposition. At the request of myself and others he\r\nconsented to spend an hour in the Negro Building, for the purpose of\r\ninspecting the Negro exhibit and of giving the coloured people in\r\nattendance an opportunity to shake hands with him. As soon as I met Mr.\r\nCleveland I became impressed with his simplicity, greatness, and rugged\r\nhonesty. I have met him many times since then, both at public functions\r\nand at his private residence in Princeton, and the more I see of him\r\nthe more I admire him. When he visited the Negro Building in Atlanta he\r\nseemed to give himself up wholly, for that hour, to the coloured\r\npeople. He seemed to be as careful to shake hands with some old\r\ncoloured “auntie” clad partially in rags, and to take as much pleasure\r\nin doing so, as if he were greeting some millionaire. Many of the\r\ncoloured people took advantage of the occasion to get him to write his\r\nname in a book or on a slip of paper. He was as careful and patient in\r\ndoing this as if he were putting his signature to some great state\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland has not only shown his friendship for me in many personal\r\nways, but has always consented to do anything I have asked of him for\r\nour school. This he has done, whether it was to make a personal\r\ndonation or to use his influence in securing the donations of others.\r\nJudging from my personal acquaintance with Mr. Cleveland, I do not\r\nbelieve that he is conscious of possessing any colour prejudice. He is\r\ntoo great for that. In my contact with people I find that, as a rule,\r\nit is only the little, narrow people who live for themselves, who never\r\nread good books, who do not travel, who never open up their souls in a\r\nway to permit them to come into contact with other souls—with the great\r\noutside world. No man whose vision is bounded by colour can come into\r\ncontact with what is highest and best in the world. In meeting men, in\r\nmany places, I have found that the happiest people are those who do the\r\nmost for others; the most miserable are those who do the least. I have\r\nalso found that few things, if any, are capable of making one so blind\r\nand narrow as race prejudice. I often say to our students, in the\r\ncourse of my talks to them on Sunday evenings in the chapel, that the\r\nlonger I live and the more experience I have of the world, the more I\r\nam convinced that, after all, the one thing that is most worth living\r\nfor—and dying for, if need be—is the opportunity of making some one\r\nelse more happy and more useful.\r\n\r\nThe coloured people and the coloured newspapers at first seemed to be\r\ngreatly pleased with the character of my Atlanta address, as well as\r\nwith its reception. But after the first burst of enthusiasm began to\r\ndie away, and the coloured people began reading the speech in cold\r\ntype, some of them seemed to feel that they had been hypnotized. They\r\nseemed to feel that I had been too liberal in my remarks toward the\r\nSouthern whites, and that I had not spoken out strongly enough for what\r\nthey termed the “rights” of my race. For a while there was a reaction,\r\nso far as a certain element of my own race was concerned, but later\r\nthese reactionary ones seemed to have been won over to my way of\r\nbelieving and acting.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of changes in public sentiment, I recall that about ten\r\nyears after the school at Tuskegee was established, I had an experience\r\nthat I shall never forget. Dr. Lyman Abbott, then the pastor of\r\nPlymouth Church, and also editor of the Outlook (then the Christian\r\nUnion), asked me to write a letter for his paper giving my opinion of\r\nthe exact condition, mental and moral, of the coloured ministers in the\r\nSouth, as based upon my observations. I wrote the letter, giving the\r\nexact facts as I conceived them to be. The picture painted was a rather\r\nblack one—or, since I am black, shall I say “white”? It could not be\r\notherwise with a race but a few years out of slavery, a race which had\r\nnot had time or opportunity to produce a competent ministry.\r\n\r\nWhat I said soon reached every Negro minister in the country, I think,\r\nand the letters of condemnation which I received from them were not\r\nfew. I think that for a year after the publication of this article\r\nevery association and every conference or religious body of any kind,\r\nof my race, that met, did not fail before adjourning to pass a\r\nresolution condemning me, or calling upon me to retract or modify what\r\nI had said. Many of these organizations went so far in their\r\nresolutions as to advise parents to cease sending their children to\r\nTuskegee. One association even appointed a “missionary” whose duty it\r\nwas to warn the people against sending their children to Tuskegee. This\r\nmissionary had a son in the school, and I noticed that, whatever the\r\n“missionary” might have said or done with regard to others, he was\r\ncareful not to take his son away from the institution. Many of the\r\ncoloured papers, especially those that were the organs of religious\r\nbodies, joined in the general chorus of condemnation or demands for\r\nretraction.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time of the excitement, and through all the criticism,\r\nI did not utter a word of explanation or retraction. I knew that I was\r\nright, and that time and the sober second thought of the people would\r\nvindicate me. It was not long before the bishops and other church\r\nleaders began to make careful investigation of the conditions of the\r\nministry, and they found out that I was right. In fact, the oldest and\r\nmost influential bishop in one branch of the Methodist Church said that\r\nmy words were far too mild. Very soon public sentiment began making\r\nitself felt, in demanding a purifying of the ministry. While this is\r\nnot yet complete by any means, I think I may say, without egotism, and\r\nI have been told by many of our most influential ministers, that my\r\nwords had much to do with starting a demand for the placing of a higher\r\ntype of men in the pulpit. I have had the satisfaction of having many\r\nwho once condemned me thank me heartily for my frank words.\r\n\r\nThe change of the attitude of the Negro ministry, so far as regards\r\nmyself, is so complete that at the present time I have no warmer\r\nfriends among any class than I have among the clergymen. The\r\nimprovement in the character and life of the Negro ministers is one of\r\nthe most gratifying evidences of the progress of the race. My\r\nexperience with them, as well as other events in my life, convince me\r\nthat the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the\r\nright thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he\r\nis right, time will show it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the discussion which was going on concerning my Atlanta\r\nspeech, I received the letter which I give below, from Dr. Gilman, the\r\nPresident of Johns Hopkins University, who had been made chairman of\r\nthe judges of award in connection with the Atlanta Exposition:—\r\n\r\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore,\r\n\r\nPresident’s Office, September 30, 1895.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Washington: Would it be agreeable to you to be one of the\r\nJudges of Award in the Department of Education at Atlanta? If so, I\r\nshall be glad to place your name upon the list. A line by telegraph\r\nwill be welcomed.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nD.C. Gilman\r\n\r\nI think I was even more surprised to receive this invitation than I had\r\nbeen to receive the invitation to speak at the opening of the\r\nExposition. It was to be a part of my duty, as one of the jurors, to\r\npass not only upon the exhibits of the coloured schools, but also upon\r\nthose of the white schools. I accepted the position, and spent a month\r\nin Atlanta in performance of the duties which it entailed. The board of\r\njurors was a large one, containing in all of sixty members. It was\r\nabout equally divided between Southern white people and Northern white\r\npeople. Among them were college presidents, leading scientists and men\r\nof letters, and specialists in many subjects. When the group of jurors\r\nto which I was assigned met for organization, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page,\r\nwho was one of the number, moved that I be made secretary of that\r\ndivision, and the motion was unanimously adopted. Nearly half of our\r\ndivision were Southern people. In performing my duties in the\r\ninspection of the exhibits of white schools I was in every case treated\r\nwith respect, and at the close of our labours I parted from my\r\nassociates with regret.\r\n\r\nI am often asked to express myself more freely than I do upon the\r\npolitical condition and the political future of my race. These\r\nrecollections of my experience in Atlanta give me the opportunity to do\r\nso briefly. My own belief is, although I have never before said so in\r\nso many words, that the time will come when the Negro in the South will\r\nbe accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and\r\nmaterial possessions entitle him to. I think, though, that the\r\nopportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in\r\nany large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be\r\naccorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that\r\nthey will protect him in the exercise of those rights. Just as soon as\r\nthe South gets over the old feeling that it is being forced by\r\n“foreigners,” or “aliens,” to do something which it does not want to\r\ndo, I believe that the change in the direction that I have indicated is\r\ngoing to begin. In fact, there are indications that it is already\r\nbeginning in a slight degree.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate my meaning. Suppose that some months before the\r\nopening of the Atlanta Exposition there had been a general demand from\r\nthe press and public platform outside the South that a Negro be given a\r\nplace on the opening programme, and that a Negro be placed upon the\r\nboard of jurors of award. Would any such recognition of the race have\r\ntaken place? I do not think so. The Atlanta officials went as far as\r\nthey did because they felt it to be a pleasure, as well as a duty, to\r\nreward what they considered merit in the Negro race. Say what we will,\r\nthere is something in human nature which we cannot blot out, which\r\nmakes one man, in the end, recognize and reward merit in another,\r\nregardless of colour or race.\r\n\r\nI believe it is the duty of the Negro—as the greater part of the race\r\nis already doing—to deport himself modestly in regard to political\r\nclaims, depending upon the slow but sure influences that proceed from\r\nthe possession of property, intelligence, and high character for the\r\nfull recognition of his political rights. I think that the according of\r\nthe full exercise of political rights is going to be a matter of\r\nnatural, slow growth, not an over-night, gourd-vine affair. I do not\r\nbelieve that the Negro should cease voting, for a man cannot learn the\r\nexercise of self-government by ceasing to vote, any more than a boy can\r\nlearn to swim by keeping out of the water, but I do believe that in his\r\nvoting he should more and more be influenced by those of intelligence\r\nand character who are his next-door neighbours.\r\n\r\nI know coloured men who, through the encouragement, help, and advice of\r\nSouthern white people, have accumulated thousands of dollars’ worth of\r\nproperty, but who, at the same time, would never think of going to\r\nthose same persons for advice concerning the casting of their ballots.\r\nThis, it seems to me, is unwise and unreasonable, and should cease. In\r\nsaying this I do not mean that the Negro should truckle, or not vote\r\nfrom principle, for the instant he ceases to vote from principle he\r\nloses the confidence and respect of the Southern white man even.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that any state should make a law that permits an\r\nignorant and poverty-stricken white man to vote, and prevents a black\r\nman in the same condition from voting. Such a law is not only unjust,\r\nbut it will react, as all unjust laws do, in time; for the effect of\r\nsuch a law is to encourage the Negro to secure education and property,\r\nand at the same time it encourages the white man to remain in ignorance\r\nand poverty. I believe that in time, through the operation of\r\nintelligence and friendly race relations, all cheating at the\r\nballot-box in the South will cease. It will become apparent that the\r\nwhite man who begins by cheating a Negro out of his ballot soon learns\r\nto cheat a white man out of his, and that the man who does this ends\r\nhis career of dishonesty by the theft of property or by some equally\r\nserious crime. In my opinion, the time will come when the South will\r\nencourage all of its citizens to vote. It will see that it pays better,\r\nfrom every standpoint, to have healthy, vigorous life than to have that\r\npolitical stagnation which always results when one-half of the\r\npopulation has no share and no interest in the Government.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, I believe in universal, free suffrage, but I believe that in\r\nthe South we are confronted with peculiar conditions that justify the\r\nprotection of the ballot in many of the states, for a while at least,\r\neither by an education test, a property test, or by both combined; but\r\nwhatever tests are required, they should be made to apply with equal\r\nand exact justice to both races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\nThe Secret Of Success In Public Speaking\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to how my address at Atlanta was received by the audience in the\r\nExposition building, I think I prefer to let Mr. James Creelman, the\r\nnoted war correspondent, tell. Mr. Creelman was present, and\r\ntelegraphed the following account to the New York World:—\r\n\r\nAtlanta, September 18.\r\n\r\nWhile President Cleveland was waiting at Gray Gables to-day, to send\r\nthe electric spark that started the machinery of the Atlanta\r\nExposition, a Negro Moses stood before a great audience of white people\r\nand delivered an oration that marks a new epoch in the history of the\r\nSouth; and a body of Negro troops marched in a procession with the\r\ncitizen soldiery of Georgia and Louisiana. The whole city is thrilling\r\nto-night with a realization of the extraordinary significance of these\r\ntwo unprecedented events. Nothing has happened since Henry Grady’s\r\nimmortal speech before the New England society in New York that\r\nindicates so profoundly the spirit of the New South, except, perhaps,\r\nthe opening of the Exposition itself.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Booker T. Washington, Principal of an industrial school\r\nfor coloured people in Tuskegee, Ala. stood on the platform of the\r\nAuditorium, with the sun shining over the heads of his auditors into\r\nhis eyes, and with his whole face lit up with the fire of prophecy,\r\nClark Howell, the successor of Henry Grady, said to me, “That man’s\r\nspeech is the beginning of a moral revolution in America.”\r\n\r\nIt is the first time that a Negro has made a speech in the South on any\r\nimportant occasion before an audience composed of white men and women.\r\nIt electrified the audience, and the response was as if it had come\r\nfrom the throat of a whirlwind.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson had hardly taken her seat when all eyes were turned on a\r\ntall tawny Negro sitting in the front row of the platform. It was\r\nProfessor Booker T. Washington, President of the Tuskegee (Alabama)\r\nNormal and Industrial Institute, who must rank from this time forth as\r\nthe foremost man of his race in America. Gilmore’s Band played the\r\n“Star-Spangled Banner,” and the audience cheered. The tune changed to\r\n“Dixie” and the audience roared with shrill “hi-yis.” Again the music\r\nchanged, this time to “Yankee Doodle,” and the clamour lessened.\r\n\r\nAll this time the eyes of the thousands present looked straight at the\r\nNegro orator. A strange thing was to happen. A black man was to speak\r\nfor his people, with none to interrupt him. As Professor Washington\r\nstrode to the edge of the stage, the low, descending sun shot fiery\r\nrays through the windows into his face. A great shout greeted him. He\r\nturned his head to avoid the blinding light, and moved about the\r\nplatform for relief. Then he turned his wonderful countenance to the\r\nsun without a blink of the eyelids, and began to talk.\r\n\r\nThere was a remarkable figure; tall, bony, straight as a Sioux chief,\r\nhigh forehead, straight nose, heavy jaws, and strong, determined mouth,\r\nwith big white teeth, piercing eyes, and a commanding manner. The\r\nsinews stood out on his bronzed neck, and his muscular right arm swung\r\nhigh in the air, with a lead-pencil grasped in the clinched brown fist.\r\nHis big feet were planted squarely, with the heels together and the\r\ntoes turned out. His voice range out clear and true, and he paused\r\nimpressively as he made each point. Within ten minutes the multitude\r\nwas in an uproar of enthusiasm—handkerchiefs were waved, canes were\r\nflourished, hats were tossed in the air. The fairest women of Georgia\r\nstood up and cheered. It was as if the orator had bewitched them.\r\n\r\nAnd when he held his dusky hand high above his head, with the fingers\r\nstretched wide apart, and said to the white people of the South on\r\nbehalf of his race, “In all things that are purely social we can be as\r\nseparate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to\r\nmutual progress,” the great wave of sound dashed itself against the\r\nwalls, and the whole audience was on its feet in a delirium of\r\napplause, and I thought at that moment of the night when Henry Grady\r\nstood among the curling wreaths of tobacco-smoke in Delmonico’s\r\nbanquet-hall and said, “I am a Cavalier among Roundheads.”\r\n\r\nI have heard the great orators of many countries, but not even\r\nGladstone himself could have pleased a cause with most consummate power\r\nthan did this angular Negro, standing in a nimbus of sunshine,\r\nsurrounded by the men who once fought to keep his race in bondage. The\r\nroar might swell ever so high, but the expression of his earnest face\r\nnever changed.\r\n\r\nA ragged, ebony giant, squatted on the floor in one of the aisles,\r\nwatched the orator with burning eyes and tremulous face until the\r\nsupreme burst of applause came, and then the tears ran down his face.\r\nMost of the Negroes in the audience were crying, perhaps without\r\nknowing just why.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the speech Governor Bullock rushed across the stage and\r\nseized the orator’s hand. Another shout greeted this demonstration, and\r\nfor a few minutes the two men stood facing each other, hand in hand.\r\n\r\nSo far as I could spare the time from the immediate work at Tuskegee,\r\nafter my Atlanta address, I accepted some of the invitations to speak\r\nin public which came to me, especially those that would take me into\r\nterritory where I thought it would pay to plead the cause of my race,\r\nbut I always did this with the understanding that I was to be free to\r\ntalk about my life-work and the needs of my people. I also had it\r\nunderstood that I was not to speak in the capacity of a professional\r\nlecturer, or for mere commercial gain.\r\n\r\nIn my efforts on the public platform I never have been able to\r\nunderstand why people come to hear me speak. This question I never can\r\nrid myself of. Time and time again, as I have stood in the street in\r\nfront of a building and have seen men and women passing in large\r\nnumbers into the audience room where I was to speak, I have felt\r\nashamed that I should be the cause of people—as it seemed to me—wasting\r\na valuable hour of their time. Some years ago I was to deliver an\r\naddress before a literary society in Madison, Wis. An hour before the\r\ntime set for me to speak, a fierce snow-storm began, and continued for\r\nseveral hours. I made up my mind that there would be no audience, and\r\nthat I should not have to speak, but, as a matter of duty, I went to\r\nthe church, and found it packed with people. The surprise gave me a\r\nshock that I did not recover from during the whole evening.\r\n\r\nPeople often ask me if I feel nervous before speaking, or else they\r\nsuggest that, since I speak often, they suppose that I get used to it.\r\nIn answer to this question I have to say that I always suffer intensely\r\nfrom nervousness before speaking. More than once, just before I was to\r\nmake an important address, this nervous strain has been so great that I\r\nhave resolved never again to speak in public. I not only feel nervous\r\nbefore speaking, but after I have finished I usually feel a sense of\r\nregret, because it seems to me as if I had left out of my address the\r\nmain thing and the best thing that I had meant to say.\r\n\r\nThere is a great compensation, though, for this preliminary nervous\r\nsuffering, that comes to me after I have been speaking for about ten\r\nminutes, and have come to feel that I have really mastered my audience,\r\nand that we have gotten into full and complete sympathy with each\r\nother. It seems to me that there is rarely such a combination of mental\r\nand physical delight in any effort as that which comes to a public\r\nspeaker when he feels that he has a great audience completely within\r\nhis control. There is a thread of sympathy and oneness that connects a\r\npublic speaker with his audience, that is just as strong as though it\r\nwas something tangible and visible. If in an audience of a thousand\r\npeople there is one person who is not in sympathy with my views, or is\r\ninclined to be doubtful, cold, or critical, I can pick him out. When I\r\nhave found him I usually go straight at him, and it is a great\r\nsatisfaction to watch the process of his thawing out. I find that the\r\nmost effective medicine for such individuals is administered at first\r\nin the form of a story, although I never tell an anecdote simply for\r\nthe sake of telling one. That kind of thing, I think, is empty and\r\nhollow, and an audience soon finds it out.\r\n\r\nI believe that one always does himself and his audience an injustice\r\nwhen he speaks merely for the sake of speaking. I do not believe that\r\none should speak unless, deep down in his heart, he feels convinced\r\nthat he has a message to deliver. When one feels, from the bottom of\r\nhis feet to the top of his head, that he has something to say that is\r\ngoing to help some individual or some cause, then let him say it; and\r\nin delivering his message I do not believe that many of the artificial\r\nrules of elocution can, under such circumstances, help him very much.\r\nAlthough there are certain things, such as pauses, breathing, and pitch\r\nof voice, that are very important, none of these can take the place of\r\nsoul in an address. When I have an address to deliver, I like to forget\r\nall about the rules for the proper use of the English language, and all\r\nabout rhetoric and that sort of thing, and I like to make the audience\r\nforget all about these things, too.\r\n\r\nNothing tends to throw me off my balance so quickly, when I am\r\nspeaking, as to have some one leave the room. To prevent this, I make\r\nup my mind, as a rule, that I will try to make my address so\r\ninteresting, will try to state so many interesting facts one after\r\nanother, that no one can leave. The average audience, I have come to\r\nbelieve, wants facts rather than generalities or sermonizing. Most\r\npeople, I think, are able to draw proper conclusions if they are given\r\nthe facts in an interesting form on which to base them.\r\n\r\nAs to the kind of audience that I like best to talk to, I would put at\r\nthe top of the list an organization of strong, wide-awake, business\r\nmen, such, for example, as is found in Boston, New York, Chicago, and\r\nBuffalo. I have found no other audience so quick to see a point, and so\r\nresponsive. Within the last few years I have had the privilege of\r\nspeaking before most of the leading organizations of this kind in the\r\nlarge cities of the United States. The best time to get hold of an\r\norganization of business men is after a good dinner, although I think\r\nthat one of the worst instruments of torture that was ever invented is\r\nthe custom which makes it necessary for a speaker to sit through a\r\nfourteen-course dinner, every minute of the time feeling sure that his\r\nspeech is going to prove a dismal failure and disappointment.\r\n\r\nI rarely take part in one of these long dinners that I do not wish that\r\nI could put myself back in the little cabin where I was a slave boy,\r\nand again go through the experience there—one that I shall never\r\nforget—of getting molasses to eat once a week from the “big house.” Our\r\nusual diet on the plantation was corn bread and pork, but on Sunday\r\nmorning my mother was permitted to bring down a little molasses from\r\nthe “big house” for her three children, and when it was received how I\r\ndid wish that every day was Sunday! I would get my tin plate and hold\r\nit up for the sweet morsel, but I would always shut my eyes while the\r\nmolasses was being poured out into the plate, with the hope that when I\r\nopened them I would be surprised to see how much I had got. When I\r\nopened my eyes I would tip the plate in one direction and another, so\r\nas to make the molasses spread all over it, in the full belief that\r\nthere would be more of it and that it would last longer if spread out\r\nin this way. So strong are my childish impressions of those Sunday\r\nmorning feasts that it would be pretty hard for any one to convince me\r\nthat there is not more molasses on a plate when it is spread all over\r\nthe plate than when it occupies a little corner—if there is a corner in\r\na plate. At any rate, I have never believed in “cornering” syrup. My\r\nshare of the syrup was usually about two tablespoonfuls, and those two\r\nspoonfuls of molasses were much more enjoyable to me than is a\r\nfourteen-course dinner after which I am to speak.\r\n\r\nNext to a company of business men, I prefer to speak to an audience of\r\nSouthern people, of either race, together or taken separately. Their\r\nenthusiasm and responsiveness are a constant delight. The “amens” and\r\n“dat’s de truf” that come spontaneously from the coloured individuals\r\nare calculated to spur any speaker on to his best efforts. I think that\r\nnext in order of preference I would place a college audience. It has\r\nbeen my privilege to deliver addresses at many of our leading colleges\r\nincluding Harvard, Yale, Williams, Amherst, Fisk University, the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Wellesley, the University of Michigan,\r\nTrinity College in North Carolina, and many others.\r\n\r\nIt has been a matter of deep interest to me to note the number of\r\npeople who have come to shake hands with me after an address, who say\r\nthat this is the first time they have ever called a Negro “Mister.”\r\n\r\nWhen speaking directly in the interests of the Tuskegee Institute, I\r\nusually arrange, some time in advance, a series of meetings in\r\nimportant centres. This takes me before churches, Sunday-schools,\r\nChristian Endeavour Societies, and men’s and women’s clubs. When doing\r\nthis I sometimes speak before as many as four organizations in a single\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, at the suggestion of Mr. Morris K. Jessup, of New\r\nYork, and Dr. J.L.M. Curry, the general agent of the fund, the trustees\r\nof the John F. Slater Fund voted a sum of money to be used in paying\r\nthe expenses of Mrs. Washington and myself while holding a series of\r\nmeetings among the coloured people in the large centres of Negro\r\npopulation, especially in the large cities of the ex-slaveholding\r\nstates. Each year during the last three years we have devoted some\r\nweeks to this work. The plan that we have followed has been for me to\r\nspeak in the morning to the ministers, teachers, and professional men.\r\nIn the afternoon Mrs. Washington would speak to the women alone, and in\r\nthe evening I spoke to a large mass-meeting. In almost every case the\r\nmeetings have been attended not only by the coloured people in large\r\nnumbers, but by the white people. In Chattanooga, Tenn., for example,\r\nthere was present at the mass-meeting an audience of not less than\r\nthree thousand persons, and I was informed that eight hundred of these\r\nwere white. I have done no work that I really enjoyed more than this,\r\nor that I think has accomplished more good.\r\n\r\nThese meetings have given Mrs. Washington and myself an opportunity to\r\nget first-hand, accurate information as to the real condition of the\r\nrace, by seeing the people in their homes, their churches, their\r\nSunday-schools, and their places of work, as well as in the prisons and\r\ndens of crime. These meetings also gave us an opportunity to see the\r\nrelations that exist between the races. I never feel so hopeful about\r\nthe race as I do after being engaged in a series of these meetings. I\r\nknow that on such occasions there is much that comes to the surface\r\nthat is superficial and deceptive, but I have had experience enough not\r\nto be deceived by mere signs and fleeting enthusiasms. I have taken\r\npains to go to the bottom of things and get facts, in a cold,\r\nbusiness-like manner.\r\n\r\nI have seen the statement made lately, by one who claims to know what\r\nhe is talking about, that, taking the whole Negro race into account,\r\nninety per cent of the Negro women are not virtuous. There never was a\r\nbaser falsehood uttered concerning a race, or a statement made that was\r\nless capable of being proved by actual facts.\r\n\r\nNo one can come into contact with the race for twenty years, as I have\r\ndone in the heart of the South, without being convinced that the race\r\nis constantly making slow but sure progress materially, educationally,\r\nand morally. One might take up the life of the worst element in New\r\nYork City, for example, and prove almost anything he wanted to prove\r\nconcerning the white man, but all will agree that this is not a fair\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1897 I received a letter inviting me to deliver an\r\naddress at the dedication of the Robert Gould Shaw monument in Boston.\r\nI accepted the invitation. It is not necessary for me, I am sure, to\r\nexplain who Robert Gould Shaw was, and what he did. The monument to his\r\nmemory stands near the head of the Boston Common, facing the State\r\nHouse. It is counted to be the most perfect piece of art of the kind to\r\nbe found in the country.\r\n\r\nThe exercises connected with the dedication were held in Music Hall, in\r\nBoston, and the great hall was packed from top to bottom with one of\r\nthe most distinguished audiences that ever assembled in the city. Among\r\nthose present were more persons representing the famous old\r\nanti-slavery element that it is likely will ever be brought together in\r\nthe country again. The late Hon. Roger Wolcott, then Governor of\r\nMassachusetts, was the presiding officer, and on the platform with him\r\nwere many other officials and hundreds of distinguished men. A report\r\nof the meeting which appeared in the Boston Transcript will describe it\r\nbetter than any words of mine could do:—\r\n\r\nThe core and kernel of yesterday’s great noon meeting, in honour of the\r\nBrotherhood of Man, in Music Hall, was the superb address of the Negro\r\nPresident of Tuskegee. “Booker T. Washington received his Harvard A.M.\r\nlast June, the first of his race,” said Governor Wolcott, “to receive\r\nan honorary degree from the oldest university in the land, and this for\r\nthe wise leadership of his people.” When Mr. Washington rose in the\r\nflag-filled, enthusiasm-warmed, patriotic, and glowing atmosphere of\r\nMusic Hall, people felt keenly that here was the civic justification of\r\nthe old abolition spirit of Massachusetts; in his person the proof of\r\nher ancient and indomitable faith; in his strong thought and rich\r\noratory, the crown and glory of the old war days of suffering and\r\nstrife. The scene was full of historic beauty and deep significance.\r\n“Cold” Boston was alive with the fire that is always hot in her heart\r\nfor righteousness and truth. Rows and rows of people who are seldom\r\nseen at any public function, whole families of those who are certain to\r\nbe out of town on a holiday, crowded the place to overflowing. The city\r\nwas at her birthright _fête_ in the persons of hundreds of her best\r\ncitizens, men and women whose names and lives stand for the virtues\r\nthat make for honourable civic pride.\r\n\r\nBattle-music had filled the air. Ovation after ovation, applause warm\r\nand prolonged, had greeted the officers and friends of Colonel Shaw,\r\nthe sculptor, St. Gaudens, the memorial Committee, the Governor and his\r\nstaff, and the Negro soldiers of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts as they\r\ncame upon the platform or entered the hall. Colonel Henry Lee, of\r\nGovernor Andrew’s old staff, had made a noble, simple presentation\r\nspeech for the committee, paying tribute to Mr. John M. Forbes, in\r\nwhose stead he served. Governor Wolcott had made his short, memorable\r\nspeech, saying, “Fort Wagner marked an epoch in the history of a race,\r\nand called it into manhood.” Mayor Quincy had received the monument for\r\nthe city of Boston. The story of Colonel Shaw and his black regiment\r\nhad been told in gallant words, and then, after the singing of\r\n\r\n    Mine eyes have seen the glory\r\n    Of the coming of the Lord,\r\n\r\nBooker Washington arose. It was, of course, just the moment for him.\r\nThe multitude, shaken out of its usual symphony-concert calm, quivered\r\nwith an excitement that was not suppressed. A dozen times it had sprung\r\nto its feet to cheer and wave and hurrah, as one person. When this man\r\nof culture and voice and power, as well as a dark skin, began, and\r\nuttered the names of Stearns and of Andrew, feeling began to mount. You\r\ncould see tears glisten in the eyes of soldiers and civilians. When the\r\norator turned to the coloured soldiers on the platform, to the\r\ncolour-bearer of Fort Wagner, who smilingly bore still the flag he had\r\nnever lowered even when wounded, and said, “To you, to the scarred and\r\nscattered remnants of the Fifty-fourth, who, with empty sleeve and\r\nwanting leg, have honoured this occasion with your presence, to you,\r\nyour commander is not dead. Though Boston erected no monument and\r\nhistory recorded no story, in you and in the loyal race which you\r\nrepresent, Robert Gould Shaw would have a monument which time could not\r\nwear away,” then came the climax of the emotion of the day and the\r\nhour. It was Roger Wolcott, as well as the Governor of Massachusetts,\r\nthe individual representative of the people’s sympathy as well as the\r\nchief magistrate, who had sprung first to his feet and cried, “Three\r\ncheers to Booker T. Washington!”\r\n\r\nAmong those on the platform was Sergeant William H. Carney, of New\r\nBedford, Mass., the brave coloured officer who was the colour-bearer at\r\nFort Wagner and held the American flag. In spite of the fact that a\r\nlarge part of his regiment was killed, he escaped, and exclaimed, after\r\nthe battle was over, “The old flag never touched the ground.”\r\n\r\nThis flag Sergeant Carney held in his hands as he sat on the platform,\r\nand when I turned to address the survivors of the coloured regiment who\r\nwere present, and referred to Sergeant Carney, he rose, as if by\r\ninstinct, and raised the flag. It has been my privilege to witness a\r\ngood many satisfactory and rather sensational demonstrations in\r\nconnection with some of my public addresses, but in dramatic effect I\r\nhave never seen or experienced anything which equalled this. For a\r\nnumber of minutes the audience seemed to entirely lose control of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn the general rejoicing throughout the country which followed the\r\nclose of the Spanish-American war, peace celebrations were arranged in\r\nseveral of the large cities. I was asked by President William R.\r\nHarper, of the University of Chicago, who was chairman of the committee\r\nof invitations for the celebration to be held in the city of Chicago,\r\nto deliver one of the addresses at the celebration there. I accepted\r\nthe invitation, and delivered two addresses there during the Jubilee\r\nweek. The first of these, and the principal one, was given in the\r\nAuditorium, on the evening of Sunday, October 16. This was the largest\r\naudience that I have ever addressed, in any part of the country; and\r\nbesides speaking in the main Auditorium, I also addressed, that same\r\nevening, two overflow audiences in other parts of the city.\r\n\r\nIt was said that there were sixteen thousand persons in the Auditorium,\r\nand it seemed to me as if there were as many more on the outside trying\r\nto get in. It was impossible for any one to get near the entrance\r\nwithout the aid of a policeman. President William McKinley attended\r\nthis meeting, as did also the members of his Cabinet, many foreign\r\nministers, and a large number of army and navy officers, many of whom\r\nhad distinguished themselves in the war which had just closed. The\r\nspeakers, besides myself, on Sunday evening, were Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch,\r\nFather Thomas P. Hodnett, and Dr. John H. Barrows.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Times-Herald, in describing the meeting, said of my\r\naddress:—\r\n\r\nHe pictured the Negro choosing slavery rather than extinction; recalled\r\nCrispus Attucks shedding his blood at the beginning of the American\r\nRevolution, that white Americans might be free, while black Americans\r\nremained in slavery; rehearsed the conduct of the Negroes with Jackson\r\nat New Orleans; drew a vivid and pathetic picture of the Southern\r\nslaves protecting and supporting the families of their masters while\r\nthe latter were fighting to perpetuate black slavery; recounted the\r\nbravery of coloured troops at Port Hudson and Forts Wagner and Pillow,\r\nand praised the heroism of the black regiments that stormed El Caney\r\nand Santiago to give freedom to the enslaved people of Cuba,\r\nforgetting, for the time being, the unjust discrimination that law and\r\ncustom make against them in their own country.\r\n\r\nIn all of these things, the speaker declared, his race had chosen the\r\nbetter part. And then he made his eloquent appeal to the consciences of\r\nthe white Americans: “When you have gotten the full story of the heroic\r\nconduct of the Negro in the Spanish-American war, have heard it from\r\nthe lips of Northern soldier and Southern soldier, from ex-abolitionist\r\nand ex-masters, then decide within yourselves whether a race that is\r\nthus willing to die for its country should not be given the highest\r\nopportunity to live for its country.”\r\n\r\nThe part of the speech which seems to arouse the wildest and most\r\nsensational enthusiasm was that in which I thanked the President for\r\nhis recognition of the Negro in his appointments during the\r\nSpanish-American war. The President was sitting in a box at the right\r\nof the stage. When I addressed him I turned toward the box, and as I\r\nfinished the sentence thanking him for his generosity, the whole\r\naudience rose and cheered again and again, waving handkerchiefs and\r\nhats and canes, until the President arose in the box and bowed his\r\nacknowledgements. At that the enthusiasm broke out again, and the\r\ndemonstration was almost indescribable.\r\n\r\nOne portion of my address at Chicago seemed to have been misunderstood\r\nby the Southern press, and some of the Southern papers took occasion to\r\ncriticise me rather strongly. These criticisms continued for several\r\nweeks, until I finally received a letter from the editor of the\r\nAge-Herald, published in Birmingham, Ala., asking me if I would say\r\njust what I meant by this part of the address. I replied to him in a\r\nletter which seemed to satisfy my critics. In this letter I said that I\r\nhad made it a rule never to say before a Northern audience anything\r\nthat I would not say before an audience in the South. I said that I did\r\nnot think it was necessary for me to go into extended explanations; if\r\nmy seventeen years of work in the heart of the South had not been\r\nexplanation enough, I did not see how words could explain. I said that\r\nI made the same plea that I had made in my address at Atlanta, for the\r\nblotting out of race prejudice in “commercial and civil relations.” I\r\nsaid that what is termed social recognition was a question which I\r\nnever discussed, and then I quoted from my Atlanta address what I had\r\nsaid there in regard to that subject.\r\n\r\nIn meeting crowds of people at public gatherings, there is one type of\r\nindividual that I dread. I mean the crank. I have become so accustomed\r\nto these people now that I can pick them out at a distance when I see\r\nthem elbowing their way up to me. The average crank has a long beard,\r\npoorly cared for, a lean, narrow face, and wears a black coat. The\r\nfront of his vest and coat are slick with grease, and his trousers bag\r\nat the knees.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, after I had spoken at a meeting, I met one of these\r\nfellows. They usually have some process for curing all of the ills of\r\nthe world at once. This Chicago specimen had a patent process by which\r\nhe said Indian corn could be kept through a period of three or four\r\nyears, and he felt sure that if the Negro race in the South would, as a\r\nwhole, adopt his process, it would settle the whole race question. It\r\nmattered nothing that I tried to convince him that our present problem\r\nwas to teach the Negroes how to produce enough corn to last them\r\nthrough one year. Another Chicago crank had a scheme by which he wanted\r\nme to join him in an effort to close up all the National banks in the\r\ncountry. If that was done, he felt sure it would put the Negro on his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe number of people who stand ready to consume one’s time, to no\r\npurpose, is almost countless. At one time I spoke before a large\r\naudience in Boston in the evening. The next morning I was awakened by\r\nhaving a card brought to my room, and with it a message that some one\r\nwas anxious to see me. Thinking that it must be something very\r\nimportant, I dressed hastily and went down. When I reached the hotel\r\noffice I found a blank and innocent-looking individual waiting for me,\r\nwho coolly remarked: “I heard you talk at a meeting last night. I\r\nrather liked your talk, and so I came in this morning to hear you talk\r\nsome more.”\r\n\r\nI am often asked how it is possible for me to superintend the work at\r\nTuskegee and at the same time be so much away from the school. In\r\npartial answer to this I would say that I think I have learned, in some\r\ndegree at least, to disregard the old maxim which says, “Do not get\r\nothers to do that which you can do yourself.” My motto, on the other\r\nhand, is, “Do not do that which others can do as well.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most encouraging signs in connection with the Tuskegee\r\nschool is found in the fact that the organization is so thorough that\r\nthe daily work of the school is not dependent upon the presence of any\r\none individual. The whole executive force, including instructors and\r\nclerks, now numbers eighty-six. This force is so organized and\r\nsubdivided that the machinery of the school goes on day by day like\r\nclockwork. Most of our teachers have been connected with the\r\ninstitutions for a number of years, and are as much interested in it as\r\nI am. In my absence, Mr. Warren Logan, the treasurer, who has been at\r\nthe school seventeen years, is the executive. He is efficiently\r\nsupported by Mrs. Washington, and by my faithful secretary, Mr. Emmett\r\nJ. Scott, who handles the bulk of my correspondence and keeps me in\r\ndaily touch with the life of the school, and who also keeps me informed\r\nof whatever takes place in the South that concerns the race. I owe more\r\nto his tact, wisdom, and hard work than I can describe.\r\n\r\nThe main executive work of the school, whether I am at Tuskegee or not,\r\ncentres in what we call the executive council. This council meets twice\r\na week, and is composed of the nine persons who are at the head of the\r\nnine departments of the school. For example: Mrs. B.K. Bruce, the Lady\r\nPrincipal, the widow of the late ex-senator Bruce, is a member of the\r\ncouncil, and represents in it all that pertains to the life of the\r\ngirls at the school. In addition to the executive council there is a\r\nfinancial committee of six, that meets every week and decides upon the\r\nexpenditures for the week. Once a month, and sometimes oftener, there\r\nis a general meeting of all the instructors. Aside from these there are\r\ninnumerable smaller meetings, such as that of the instructors in the\r\nPhelps Hall Bible Training School, or of the instructors in the\r\nagricultural department.\r\n\r\nIn order that I may keep in constant touch with the life of the\r\ninstitution, I have a system of reports so arranged that a record of\r\nthe school’s work reaches me every day of the year, no matter in what\r\npart of the country I am. I know by these reports even what students\r\nare excused from school, and why they are excused—whether for reasons\r\nof ill health or otherwise. Through the medium of these reports I know\r\neach day what the income of the school in money is; I know how many\r\ngallons of milk and how many pounds of butter come from the dairy; what\r\nthe bill of fare for the teachers and students is; whether a certain\r\nkind of meat was boiled or baked, and whether certain vegetables served\r\nin the dining room were bought from a store or procured from our own\r\nfarm. Human nature I find to be very much the same the world over, and\r\nit is sometimes not hard to yield to the temptation to go to a barrel\r\nof rice that has come from the store—with the grain all prepared to go\r\nin the pot—rather than to take the time and trouble to go to the field\r\nand dig and wash one’s own sweet potatoes, which might be prepared in a\r\nmanner to take the place of the rice.\r\n\r\nI am often asked how, in the midst of so much work, a large part of\r\nwhich is for the public, I can find time for any rest or recreation,\r\nand what kind of recreation or sports I am fond of. This is rather a\r\ndifficult question to answer. I have a strong feeling that every\r\nindividual owes it to himself, and to the cause which he is serving, to\r\nkeep a vigorous, healthy body, with the nerves steady and strong,\r\nprepared for great efforts and prepared for disappointments and trying\r\npositions. As far as I can, I make it a rule to plan for each day’s\r\nwork—not merely to go through with the same routine of daily duties,\r\nbut to get rid of the routine work as early in the day as possible, and\r\nthen to enter upon some new or advance work. I make it a rule to clear\r\nmy desk every day, before leaving my office, of all correspondence and\r\nmemoranda, so that on the morrow I can begin a _new_ day of work. I\r\nmake it a rule never to let my work drive me, but to so master it, and\r\nkeep it in such complete control, and to keep so far ahead of it, that\r\nI will be the master instead of the servant. There is a physical and\r\nmental and spiritual enjoyment that comes from a consciousness of being\r\nthe absolute master of one’s work, in all its details, that is very\r\nsatisfactory and inspiring. My experience teaches me that, if one\r\nlearns to follow this plan, he gets a freshness of body and vigour of\r\nmind out of work that goes a long way toward keeping him strong and\r\nhealthy. I believe that when one can grow to the point where he loves\r\nhis work, this gives him a kind of strength that is most valuable.\r\n\r\nWhen I begin my work in the morning, I expect to have a successful and\r\npleasant day of it, but at the same time I prepare myself for\r\nunpleasant and unexpected hard places. I prepared myself to hear that\r\none of our school buildings is on fire, or has burned, or that some\r\ndisagreeable accident has occurred, or that some one has abused me in a\r\npublic address or printed article, for something that I have done or\r\nomitted to do, or for something that he had heard that I had\r\nsaid—probably something that I had never thought of saying.\r\n\r\nIn nineteen years of continuous work I have taken but one vacation.\r\nThat was two years ago, when some of my friends put the money into my\r\nhands and forced Mrs. Washington and myself to spend three months in\r\nEurope. I have said that I believe it is the duty of every one to keep\r\nhis body in good condition. I try to look after the little ills, with\r\nthe idea that if I take care of the little ills the big ones will not\r\ncome. When I find myself unable to sleep well, I know that something is\r\nwrong. If I find any part of my system the least weak, and not\r\nperforming its duty, I consult a good physician. The ability to sleep\r\nwell, at any time and in any place, I find of great advantage. I have\r\nso trained myself that I can lie down for a nap of fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, and get up refreshed in body and mind.\r\n\r\nI have said that I make it a rule to finish up each day’s work before\r\nleaving it. There is, perhaps, one exception to this. When I have an\r\nunusually difficult question to decide—one that appeals strongly to the\r\nemotions—I find it a safe rule to sleep over it for a night, or to wait\r\nuntil I have had an opportunity to talk it over with my wife and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAs to my reading; the most time I get for solid reading is when I am on\r\nthe cars. Newspapers are to me a constant source of delight and\r\nrecreation. The only trouble is that I read too many of them. Fiction I\r\ncare little for. Frequently I have to almost force myself to read a\r\nnovel that is on every one’s lips. The kind of reading that I have the\r\ngreatest fondness for is biography. I like to be sure that I am reading\r\nabout a real man or a real thing. I think I do not go too far when I\r\nsay that I have read nearly every book and magazine article that has\r\nbeen written about Abraham Lincoln. In literature he is my patron\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nOut of the twelve months in a year I suppose that, on an average, I\r\nspend six months away from Tuskegee. While my being absent from the\r\nschool so much unquestionably has its disadvantages, yet there are at\r\nthe same time some compensations. The change of work brings a certain\r\nkind of rest. I enjoy a ride of a long distance on the cars, when I am\r\npermitted to ride where I can be comfortable. I get rest on the cars,\r\nexcept when the inevitable individual who seems to be on every train\r\napproaches me with the now familiar phrase: “Isn’t this Booker\r\nWashington? I want to introduce myself to you.” Absence from the school\r\nenables me to lose sight of the unimportant details of the work, and\r\nstudy it in a broader and more comprehensive manner than I could do on\r\nthe grounds. This absence also brings me into contact with the best\r\nwork being done in educational lines, and into contact with the best\r\neducators in the land.\r\n\r\nBut, after all this is said, the time when I get the most solid rest\r\nand recreation is when I can be at Tuskegee, and, after our evening\r\nmeal is over, can sit down, as is our custom, with my wife and Portia\r\nand Baker and Davidson, my three children, and read a story, or each\r\ntake turns in telling a story. To me there is nothing on earth equal to\r\nthat, although what is nearly equal to it is to go with them for an\r\nhour or more, as we like to do on Sunday afternoons, into the woods,\r\nwhere we can live for a while near the heart of nature, where no one\r\ncan disturb or vex us, surrounded by pure air, the trees, the\r\nshrubbery, the flowers, and the sweet fragrance that springs from a\r\nhundred plants, enjoying the chirp of the crickets and the songs of the\r\nbirds. This is solid rest.\r\n\r\nMy garden, also, what little time I can be at Tuskegee, is another\r\nsource of rest and enjoyment. Somehow I like, as often as possible, to\r\ntouch nature, not something that is artificial or an imitation, but the\r\nreal thing. When I can leave my office in time so that I can spend\r\nthirty or forty minutes in spading the ground, in planting seeds, in\r\ndigging about the plants, I feel that I am coming into contact with\r\nsomething that is giving me strength for the many duties and hard\r\nplaces that await me out in the big world. I pity the man or woman who\r\nhas never learned to enjoy nature and to get strength and inspiration\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nAside from the large number of fowls and animals kept by the school, I\r\nkeep individually a number of pigs and fowls of the best grades, and in\r\nraising these I take a great deal of pleasure. I think the pig is my\r\nfavourite animal. Few things are more satisfactory to me than a\r\nhigh-grade Berkshire or Poland China pig.\r\n\r\nGames I care little for. I have never seen a game of football. In cards\r\nI do not know one card from another. A game of old-fashioned marbles\r\nwith my two boys, once in a while, is all I care for in this direction.\r\nI suppose I would care for games now if I had had any time in my youth\r\nto give to them, but that was not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\nEurope\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1893 I was married to Miss Margaret James Murray, a native of\r\nMississippi, and a graduate of Fisk University, in Nashville, Tenn.,\r\nwho had come to Tuskegee as a teacher several years before, and at the\r\ntime we were married was filling the position of Lady Principal. Not\r\nonly is Mrs. Washington completely one with me in the work directly\r\nconnected with the school, relieving me of many burdens and\r\nperplexities, but aside from her work on the school grounds, she\r\ncarries on a mothers’ meeting in the town of Tuskegee, and a plantation\r\nwork among the women, children, and men who live in a settlement\r\nconnected with a large plantation about eight miles from Tuskegee. Both\r\nthe mothers’ meeting and the plantation work are carried on, not only\r\nwith a view to helping those who are directly reached, but also for the\r\npurpose of furnishing object-lessons in these two kinds of work that\r\nmay be followed by our students when they go out into the world for\r\ntheir own life-work.\r\n\r\nAside from these two enterprises, Mrs. Washington is also largely\r\nresponsible for a woman’s club at the school which brings together,\r\ntwice a month, the women who live on the school grounds and those who\r\nlive near, for the discussion of some important topic. She is also the\r\nPresident of what is known as the Federation of Southern Coloured\r\nWomen’s Clubs, and is Chairman of the Executive Committee of the\r\nNational Federation of Coloured Women’s Clubs.\r\n\r\nPortia, the oldest of my three children, has learned dressmaking. She\r\nhas unusual ability in instrumental music. Aside from her studies at\r\nTuskegee, she has already begun to teach there.\r\n\r\nBooker Taliaferro is my next oldest child. Young as he is, he has\r\nalready nearly mastered the brickmason’s trade. He began working at\r\nthis trade when he was quite small, dividing his time between this and\r\nclass work; and he has developed great skill in the trade and a\r\nfondness for it. He says that he is going to be an architect and\r\nbrickmason. One of the most satisfactory letters that I have ever\r\nreceived from any one came to me from Booker last summer. When I left\r\nhome for the summer, I told him that he must work at his trade half of\r\neach day, and that the other half of the day he could spend as he\r\npleased. When I had been away from home two weeks, I received the\r\nfollowing letter from him:\r\n\r\nTuskegee, Alabama.\r\n\r\nMy dear Papa: Before you left home you told me to work at my trade half\r\nof each day. I like my work so much that I want to work at my trade all\r\nday. Besides, I want to earn all the money I can, so that when I go to\r\nanother school I shall have money to pay my expenses.\r\n\r\nYour son,\r\n\r\nBooker.\r\n\r\nMy youngest child, Ernest Davidson Washington, says that he is going to\r\nbe a physician. In addition to going to school, where he studies books\r\nand has manual training, he regularly spends a portion of his time in\r\nthe office of our resident physician, and has already learned to do\r\nmany of the duties which pertain to a doctor’s office.\r\n\r\nThe thing in my life which brings me the keenest regret is that my work\r\nin connection with public affairs keeps me for so much of the time away\r\nfrom my family, where, of all places in the world, I delight to be. I\r\nalways envy the individual whose life-work is so laid that he can spend\r\nhis evenings at home. I have sometimes thought that people who have\r\nthis rare privilege do not appreciate it as they should. It is such a\r\nrest and relief to get away from crowds of people, and handshaking, and\r\ntravelling, to get home, even if it be for but a very brief while.\r\n\r\nAnother thing at Tuskegee out of which I get a great deal of pleasure\r\nand satisfaction is in the meeting with our students, and teachers, and\r\ntheir families, in the chapel for devotional exercises every evening at\r\nhalf-past eight, the last thing before retiring for the night. It is an\r\ninspiring sight when one stands on the platform there and sees before\r\nhim eleven or twelve hundred earnest young men and women; and one\r\ncannot but feel that it is a privilege to help to guide them to a\r\nhigher and more useful life.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1899 there came to me what I might describe as almost\r\nthe greatest surprise of my life. Some good ladies in Boston arranged a\r\npublic meeting in the interests of Tuskegee, to be held in the Hollis\r\nStreet Theatre. This meeting was attended by large numbers of the best\r\npeople of Boston, of both races. Bishop Lawrence presided. In addition\r\nto an address made by myself, Mr. Paul Lawrence Dunbar read from his\r\npoems, and Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois read an original sketch.\r\n\r\nSome of those who attended this meeting noticed that I seemed unusually\r\ntired, and some little time after the close of the meeting, one of the\r\nladies who had been interested in it asked me in a casual way if I had\r\never been to Europe. I replied that I never had. She asked me if I had\r\never thought of going, and I told her no; that it was something\r\nentirely beyond me. This conversation soon passed out of my mind, but a\r\nfew days afterward I was informed that some friends in Boston,\r\nincluding Mr. Francis J. Garrison, had raised a sum of money sufficient\r\nto pay all the expenses of Mrs. Washington and myself during a three or\r\nfour months’ trip to Europe. It was added with emphasis that we _must_\r\ngo. A year previous to this Mr. Garrison had attempted to get me to\r\npromise to go to Europe for a summer’s rest, with the understanding\r\nthat he would be responsible for raising the money among his friends\r\nfor the expenses of the trip. At that time such a journey seemed so\r\nentirely foreign to anything that I should ever be able to undertake\r\nthat I did confess I did not give the matter very serious attention;\r\nbut later Mr. Garrison joined his efforts to those of the ladies whom I\r\nhave mentioned, and when their plans were made known to me Mr. Garrison\r\nnot only had the route mapped out, but had, I believe, selected the\r\nsteamer upon which we were to sail.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was so sudden and so unexpected that I was completely\r\ntaken off my feet. I had been at work steadily for eighteen years in\r\nconnection with Tuskegee, and I had never thought of anything else but\r\nending my life in that way. Each day the school seemed to depend upon\r\nme more largely for its daily expenses, and I told these Boston friends\r\nthat, while I thanked them sincerely for their thoughtfulness and\r\ngenerosity, I could not go to Europe, for the reason that the school\r\ncould not live financially while I was absent. They then informed me\r\nthat Mr. Henry L. Higginson, and some other good friends who I know do\r\nnot want their names made public, were then raising a sum of money\r\nwhich would be sufficient to keep the school in operation while I was\r\naway. At this point I was compelled to surrender. Every avenue of\r\nescape had been closed.\r\n\r\nDeep down in my heart the whole thing seemed more like a dream than\r\nlike reality, and for a long time it was difficult for me to make\r\nmyself believe that I was actually going to Europe. I had been born and\r\nlargely reared in the lowest depths of slavery, ignorance, and poverty.\r\nIn my childhood I had suffered for want of a place to sleep, for lack\r\nof food, clothing, and shelter. I had not had the privilege of sitting\r\ndown to a dining-table until I was quite well grown. Luxuries had\r\nalways seemed to me to be something meant for white people, not for my\r\nrace. I had always regarded Europe, and London, and Paris, much as I\r\nregarded heaven. And now could it be that I was actually going to\r\nEurope? Such thoughts as these were constantly with me.\r\n\r\nTwo other thoughts troubled me a good deal. I feared that people who\r\nheard that Mrs. Washington and I were going to Europe might not know\r\nall the circumstances, and might get the idea that we had become, as\r\nsome might say, “stuck up,” and were trying to “show off.” I recalled\r\nthat from my youth I had heard it said that too often, when people of\r\nmy race reached any degree of success, they were inclined to unduly\r\nexalt themselves; to try and ape the wealthy, and in so doing to lose\r\ntheir heads. The fear that people might think this of us haunted me a\r\ngood deal. Then, too, I could not see how my conscience would permit me\r\nto spare the time from my work and be happy. It seemed mean and selfish\r\nin me to be taking a vacation while others were at work, and while\r\nthere was so much that needed to be done. From the time I could\r\nremember, I had always been at work, and I did not see how I could\r\nspend three or four months in doing nothing. The fact was that I did\r\nnot know how to take a vacation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Washington had much the same difficulty in getting away, but she\r\nwas anxious to go because she thought that I needed the rest. There\r\nwere many important National questions bearing upon the life of the\r\nrace which were being agitated at that time, and this made it all the\r\nharder for us to decide to go. We finally gave our Boston friends our\r\npromise that we would go, and then they insisted that the date of our\r\ndeparture be set as soon as possible. So we decided upon May 10. My\r\ngood friend Mr. Garrison kindly took charge of all the details\r\nnecessary for the success of the trip, and he, as well as other\r\nfriends, gave us a great number of letters of introduction to people in\r\nFrance and England, and made other arrangements for our comfort and\r\nconvenience abroad. Good-bys were said at Tuskegee, and we were in New\r\nYork May 9, ready to sail the next day. Our daughter Portia, who was\r\nthen studying in South Framingham, Mass., came to New York to see us\r\noff. Mr. Scott, my secretary, came with me to New York, in order that I\r\nmight clear up the last bit of business before I left. Other friends\r\nalso came to New York to see us off. Just before we went on board the\r\nsteamer another pleasant surprise came to us in the form of a letter\r\nfrom two generous ladies, stating that they had decided to give us the\r\nmoney with which to erect a new building to be used in properly housing\r\nall our industries for girls at Tuskegee.\r\n\r\nWe were to sail on the Friesland, of the Red Star Line, and a beautiful\r\nvessel she was. We went on board just before noon, the hour of sailing.\r\nI had never before been on board a large ocean steamer, and the feeling\r\nwhich took possession of me when I found myself there is rather hard to\r\ndescribe. It was a feeling, I think, of awe mingled with delight. We\r\nwere agreeably surprised to find that the captain, as well as several\r\nof the other officers, not only knew who we were, but was expecting us\r\nand gave us a pleasant greeting. There were several passengers whom we\r\nknew, including Senator Sewell, of New Jersey, and Edward Marshall, the\r\nnewspaper correspondent. I had just a little fear that we would not be\r\ntreated civilly by some of the passengers. This fear was based upon\r\nwhat I had heard other people of my race, who had crossed the ocean,\r\nsay about unpleasant experiences in crossing the ocean in American\r\nvessels. But in our case, from the captain down to the most humble\r\nservant, we were treated with the greatest kindness. Nor was this\r\nkindness confined to those who were connected with the steamer; it was\r\nshown by all the passengers also. There were not a few Southern men and\r\nwomen on board, and they were as cordial as those from other parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last good-bys were said, and the steamer had cut loose\r\nfrom the wharf, the load of care, anxiety, and responsibility which I\r\nhad carried for eighteen years began to lift itself from my shoulders\r\nat the rate, it seemed to me, of a pound a minute. It was the first\r\ntime in all those years that I had felt, even in a measure, free from\r\ncare; and my feeling of relief it is hard to describe on paper. Added\r\nto this was the delightful anticipation of being in Europe soon. It all\r\nseemed more like a dream than like a reality.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrison had thoughtfully arranged to have us have one of the most\r\ncomfortable rooms on the ship. The second or third day out I began to\r\nsleep, and I think that I slept at the rate of fifteen hours a day\r\nduring the remainder of the ten days’ passage. Then it was that I began\r\nto understand how tired I really was. These long sleeps I kept up for a\r\nmonth after we landed on the other side. It was such an unusual feeling\r\nto wake up in the morning and realize that I had no engagements; did\r\nnot have to take a train at a certain hour; did not have an appointment\r\nto meet some one, or to make an address, at a certain hour. How\r\ndifferent all this was from the experiences that I have been through\r\nwhen travelling, when I have sometimes slept in three different beds in\r\na single night!\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday came, the captain invited me to conduct the religious\r\nservices, but, not being a minister, I declined. The passengers,\r\nhowever, began making requests that I deliver an address to them in the\r\ndining-saloon some time during the voyage, and this I consented to do.\r\nSenator Sewell presided at this meeting. After ten days of delightful\r\nweather, during which I was not seasick for a day, we landed at the\r\ninteresting old city of Antwerp, in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe next day after we landed happened to be one of those numberless\r\nholidays which the people of those countries are in the habit of\r\nobserving. It was a bright, beautiful day. Our room in the hotel faced\r\nthe main public square, and the sights there—the people coming in from\r\nthe country with all kinds of beautiful flowers to sell, the women\r\ncoming in with their dogs drawing large, brightly polished cans filled\r\nwith milk, the people streaming into the cathedral—filled me with a\r\nsense of newness that I had never before experienced.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some time in Antwerp, we were invited to go with a part\r\nof a half-dozen persons on a trip through Holland. This party included\r\nEdward Marshall and some American artists who had come over on the same\r\nsteamer with us. We accepted the invitation, and enjoyed the trip\r\ngreatly. I think it was all the more interesting and instructive\r\nbecause we went for most of the way on one of the slow, old-fashioned\r\ncanal-boats. This gave us an opportunity of seeing and studying the\r\nreal life of the people in the country districts. We went in this way\r\nas far as Rotterdam, and later went to The Hague, where the Peace\r\nConference was then in session, and where we were kindly received by\r\nthe American representatives.\r\n\r\nThe thing that impressed itself most on me in Holland was the\r\nthoroughness of the agriculture and the excellence of the Holstein\r\ncattle. I never knew, before visiting Holland, how much it was possible\r\nfor people to get out of a small plot of ground. It seemed to me that\r\nabsolutely no land was wasted. It was worth a trip to Holland, too,\r\njust to get a sight of three or four hundred fine Holstein cows grazing\r\nin one of those intensely green fields.\r\n\r\nFrom Holland we went to Belgium, and made a hasty trip through that\r\ncountry, stopping at Brussels, where we visited the battlefield of\r\nWaterloo. From Belgium we went direct to Paris, where we found that Mr.\r\nTheodore Stanton, the son of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, had kindly\r\nprovided accommodations for us. We had barely got settled in Paris\r\nbefore an invitation came to me from the University Club of Paris to be\r\nits guest at a banquet which was soon to be given. The other guests\r\nwere ex-President Benjamin Harrison and Archbishop Ireland, who were in\r\nParis at the time. The American Ambassador, General Horace Porter,\r\npresided at the banquet. My address on this occasion seemed to give\r\nsatisfaction to those who heard it. General Harrison kindly devoted a\r\nlarge portion of his remarks at dinner to myself and to the influence\r\nof the work at Tuskegee on the American race question. After my address\r\nat this banquet other invitations came to me, but I declined the most\r\nof them, knowing that if I accepted them all, the object of my visit\r\nwould be defeated. I did, however, consent to deliver an address in the\r\nAmerican chapel the following Sunday morning, and at this meeting\r\nGeneral Harrison, General Porter, and other distinguished Americans\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\nLater we received a formal call from the American Ambassador, and were\r\ninvited to attend a reception at his residence. At this reception we\r\nmet many Americans, among them Justices Fuller and Harlan, of the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court. During our entire stay of a month in\r\nParis, both the American Ambassador and his wife, as well as several\r\nother Americans, were very kind to us.\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris we saw a good deal of the now famous American Negro\r\npainter, Mr. Henry O. Tanner, whom we had formerly known in America. It\r\nwas very satisfactory to find how well known Mr. Tanner was in the\r\nfield of art, and to note the high standing which all classes accorded\r\nto him. When we told some Americans that we were going to the\r\nLuxembourg Palace to see a painting by an American Negro, it was hard\r\nto convince them that a Negro had been thus honoured. I do not believe\r\nthat they were really convinced of the fact until they saw the picture\r\nfor themselves. My acquaintance with Mr. Tanner reenforced in my mind\r\nthe truth which I am constantly trying to impress upon our students at\r\nTuskegee—and on our people throughout the country, as far as I can\r\nreach them with my voice—that any man, regardless of colour, will be\r\nrecognized and rewarded just in proportion as he learns to do something\r\nwell—learns to do it better than some one else—however humble the thing\r\nmay be. As I have said, I believe that my race will succeed in\r\nproportion as it learns to do a common thing in an uncommon manner;\r\nlearns to do a thing so thoroughly that no one can improve upon what it\r\nhas done; learns to make its services of indispensable value. This was\r\nthe spirit that inspired me in my first effort at Hampton, when I was\r\ngiven the opportunity to sweep and dust that schoolroom. In a degree I\r\nfelt that my whole future life depended upon the thoroughness with\r\nwhich I cleaned that room, and I was determined to do it so well that\r\nno one could find any fault with the job. Few people ever stopped, I\r\nfound, when looking at his pictures, to inquire whether Mr. Tanner was\r\na Negro painter, a French painter, or a German painter. They simply\r\nknew that he was able to produce something which the world wanted—a\r\ngreat painting—and the matter of his colour did not enter into their\r\nminds. When a Negro girl learns to cook, to wash dishes, to sew, or\r\nwrite a book, or a Negro boy learns to groom horses, or to grow sweet\r\npotatoes, or to produce butter, or to build a house, or to be able to\r\npractise medicine, as well or better than some one else, they will be\r\nrewarded regardless of race or colour. In the long run, the world is\r\ngoing to have the best, and any difference in race, religion, or\r\nprevious history will not long keep the world from what it wants.\r\n\r\nI think that the whole future of my race hinges on the question as to\r\nwhether or not it can make itself of such indispensable value that the\r\npeople in the town and the state where we reside will feel that our\r\npresence is necessary to the happiness and well-being of the community.\r\nNo man who continues to add something to the material, intellectual,\r\nand moral well-being of the place in which he lives is long left\r\nwithout proper reward. This is a great human law which cannot be\r\npermanently nullified.\r\n\r\nThe love of pleasure and excitement which seems in a large measure to\r\npossess the French people impressed itself upon me. I think they are\r\nmore noted in this respect than is true of the people of my own race.\r\nIn point of morality and moral earnestness I do not believe that the\r\nFrench are ahead of my own race in America. Severe competition and the\r\ngreat stress of life have led them to learn to do things more\r\nthoroughly and to exercise greater economy; but time, I think, will\r\nbring my race to the same point. In the matter of truth and high honour\r\nI do not believe that the average Frenchman is ahead of the American\r\nNegro; while so far as mercy and kindness to dumb animals go, I believe\r\nthat my race is far ahead. In fact, when I left France, I had more\r\nfaith in the future of the black man in America than I had ever\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris we went to London, and reached there early in July, just\r\nabout the height of the London social season. Parliament was in\r\nsession, and there was a great deal of gaiety. Mr. Garrison and other\r\nfriends had provided us with a large number of letters of introduction,\r\nand they had also sent letters to other persons in different parts of\r\nthe United Kingdom, apprising these people of our coming. Very soon\r\nafter reaching London we were flooded with invitations to attend all\r\nmanner of social functions, and a great many invitations came to me\r\nasking that I deliver public addresses. The most of these invitations I\r\ndeclined, for the reason that I wanted to rest. Neither were we able to\r\naccept more than a small proportion of the other invitations. The Rev.\r\nDr. Brooke Herford and Mrs. Herford, whom I had known in Boston,\r\nconsulted with the American Ambassador, the Hon. Joseph Choate, and\r\narranged for me to speak at a public meeting to be held in Essex Hall.\r\nMr. Choate kindly consented to preside. The meeting was largely\r\nattended. There were many distinguished persons present, among them\r\nseveral members of Parliament, including Mr. James Bryce, who spoke at\r\nthe meeting. What the American Ambassador said in introducing me, as\r\nwell as a synopsis of what I said, was widely published in England and\r\nin the American papers at the time. Dr. and Mrs. Herford gave Mrs.\r\nWashington and myself a reception, at which we had the privilege of\r\nmeeting some of the best people in England. Throughout our stay in\r\nLondon Ambassador Choate was most kind and attentive to us. At the\r\nAmbassador’s reception I met, for the first time, Mark Twain.\r\n\r\nWe were the guests several times of Mrs. T. Fisher Unwin, the daughter\r\nof the English statesman, Richard Cobden. It seemed as if both Mr. and\r\nMrs. Unwin could not do enough for our comfort and happiness. Later,\r\nfor nearly a week, we were the guests of the daughter of John Bright,\r\nnow Mrs. Clark, of Street, England. Both Mr. and Mrs. Clark, with their\r\ndaughter, visited us at Tuskegee the next year. In Birmingham, England,\r\nwe were the guests for several days of Mr. Joseph Sturge, whose father\r\nwas a great abolitionist and friend of Whittier and Garrison. It was a\r\ngreat privilege to meet throughout England those who had known and\r\nhonoured the late William Lloyd Garrison, the Hon. Frederick Douglass,\r\nand other abolitionists. The English abolitionists with whom we came in\r\ncontact never seemed to tire of talking about these two Americans.\r\nBefore going to England I had had no proper conception of the deep\r\ninterest displayed by the abolitionists of England in the cause of\r\nfreedom, nor did I realize the amount of substantial help given by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn Bristol, England, both Mrs. Washington and I spoke at the Women’s\r\nLiberal Club. I was also the principal speaker at the Commencement\r\nexercises of the Royal College for the Blind. These exercises were held\r\nin the Crystal Palace, and the presiding officer was the late Duke of\r\nWestminster, who was said to be, I believe, the richest man in England,\r\nif not in the world. The Duke, as well as his wife and their daughter,\r\nseemed to be pleased with what I said, and thanked me heartily. Through\r\nthe kindness of Lady Aberdeen, my wife and I were enabled to go with a\r\nparty of those who were attending the International Congress of Women,\r\nthen in session in London, to see Queen Victoria, at Windsor Castle,\r\nwhere, afterward, we were all the guests of her Majesty at tea. In our\r\nparty was Miss Susan B. Anthony, and I was deeply impressed with the\r\nfact that one did not often get an opportunity to see, during the same\r\nhour, two women so remarkable in different ways as Susan B. Anthony and\r\nQueen Victoria.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, which we visited several times, we met Sir\r\nHenry M. Stanley. I talked with him about Africa and its relation to\r\nthe American Negro, and after my interview with him I became more\r\nconvinced than ever that there was no hope of the American Negro’s\r\nimproving his condition by emigrating to Africa.\r\n\r\nOn various occasions Mrs. Washington and I were the guests of\r\nEnglishmen in their country homes, where, I think, one sees the\r\nEnglishman at his best. In one thing, at least, I feel sure that the\r\nEnglish are ahead of Americans, and that is, that they have learned how\r\nto get more out of life. The home life of the English seems to me to be\r\nabout as perfect as anything can be. Everything moves like clockwork. I\r\nwas impressed, too, with the deference that the servants show to their\r\n“masters” and “mistresses,”—terms which I suppose would not be\r\ntolerated in America. The English servant expects, as a rule, to be\r\nnothing but a servant, and so he perfects himself in the art to a\r\ndegree that no class of servants in America has yet reached. In our\r\ncountry the servant expects to become, in a few years, a “master”\r\nhimself. Which system is preferable? I will not venture an answer.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that impressed itself upon me throughout England was the\r\nhigh regard that all classes have for law and order, and the ease and\r\nthoroughness with which everything is done. The Englishmen, I found,\r\ntook plenty of time for eating, as for everything else. I am not sure\r\nif, in the long run, they do not accomplish as much or more than\r\nrushing, nervous Americans do.\r\n\r\nMy visit to England gave me a higher regard for the nobility than I had\r\nhad. I had no idea that they were so generally loved and respected by\r\nthe classes, nor had I any correct conception of how much time and\r\nmoney they spent in works of philanthropy, and how much real heart they\r\nput into this work. My impression had been that they merely spent money\r\nfreely and had a “good time.”\r\n\r\nIt was hard for me to get accustomed to speaking to English audiences.\r\nThe average Englishman is so serious, and is so tremendously in earnest\r\nabout everything, that when I told a story that would have made an\r\nAmerican audience roar with laughter, the Englishmen simply looked me\r\nstraight in the face without even cracking a smile.\r\n\r\nWhen the Englishman takes you into his heart and friendship, he binds\r\nyou there as with cords of steel, and I do not believe that there are\r\nmany other friendships that are so lasting or so satisfactory. Perhaps\r\nI can illustrate this point in no better way than by relating the\r\nfollowing incident. Mrs. Washington and I were invited to attend a\r\nreception given by the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, at Stafford\r\nHouse—said to be the finest house in London; I may add that I believe\r\nthe Duchess of Sutherland is said to be the most beautiful woman in\r\nEngland. There must have been at least three hundred persons at this\r\nreception. Twice during the evening the Duchess sought us out for a\r\nconversation, and she asked me to write her when we got home, and tell\r\nher more about the work at Tuskegee. This I did. When Christmas came we\r\nwere surprised and delighted to receive her photograph with her\r\nautograph on it. The correspondence has continued, and we now feel that\r\nin the Duchess of Sutherland we have one of our warmest friends.\r\n\r\nAfter three months in Europe we sailed from Southampton in the\r\nsteamship St. Louis. On this steamer there was a fine library that had\r\nbeen presented to the ship by the citizens of St. Louis, Mo. In this\r\nlibrary I found a life of Frederick Douglass, which I began reading. I\r\nbecame especially interested in Mr. Douglass’s description of the way\r\nhe was treated on shipboard during his first or second visit to\r\nEngland. In this description he told how he was not permitted to enter\r\nthe cabin, but had to confine himself to the deck of the ship. A few\r\nminutes after I had finished reading this description I was waited on\r\nby a committee of ladies and gentlemen with the request that I deliver\r\nan address at a concert which was to begin the following evening. And\r\nyet there are people who are bold enough to say that race feeling in\r\nAmerica is not growing less intense! At this concert the Hon. Benjamin\r\nB. Odell, Jr., the present governor of New York, presided. I was never\r\ngiven a more cordial hearing anywhere. A large proportion of the\r\npassengers were Southern people. After the concert some of the\r\npassengers proposed that a subscription be raised to help the work at\r\nTuskegee, and the money to support several scholarships was the result.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in Paris I was very pleasantly surprised to receive the\r\nfollowing invitation from the citizens of West Virginia and of the city\r\nnear which I had spent my boyhood days:—\r\n\r\nCharleston, W. Va., May 16, 1899.\r\n\r\nProfessor Booker T. Washington, Paris, France:\r\n\r\nDear Sir: Many of the best citizens of West Virginia have united in\r\nliberal expressions of admiration and praise of your worth and work,\r\nand desire that on your return from Europe you should favour them with\r\nyour presence and with the inspiration of your words. We must sincerely\r\nindorse this move, and on behalf of the citizens of Charleston extend\r\nto your our most cordial invitation to have you come to us, that we may\r\nhonour you who have done so much by your life and work to honour us.\r\n\r\nWe are,\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nThe Common Council of the City of Charleston,\r\n\r\nBy W. Herman Smith, Mayor.\r\n\r\nThis invitation from the City Council of Charleston was accompanied by\r\nthe following:—\r\n\r\nProfessor Booker T. Washington, Paris, France:\r\n\r\nDear Sir: We, the citizens of Charleston and West Virginia, desire to\r\nexpress our pride in you and the splendid career that you have thus far\r\naccomplished, and ask that we be permitted to show our pride and\r\ninterest in a substantial way.\r\n\r\nYour recent visit to your old home in our midst awoke within us the\r\nkeenest regret that we were not permitted to hear you and render some\r\nsubstantial aid to your work, before you left for Europe.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, we earnestly invite you to share the\r\nhospitality of our city upon your return from Europe, and give us the\r\nopportunity to hear you and put ourselves in touch with your work in a\r\nway that will be most gratifying to yourself, and that we may receive\r\nthe inspiration of your words and presence.\r\n\r\nAn early reply to this invitation, with an indication of the time you\r\nmay reach our city, will greatly oblige,\r\n\r\nYours very respectfully,\r\n\r\nThe Charleston Daily Gazette, The Daily Mail-Tribune; G.W. Atkinson,\r\nGovernor; E.L. Boggs, Secretary to Governor; Wm. M.O. Dawson, Secretary\r\nof State; L.M. La Follette, Auditor; J.R. Trotter, Superintendent of\r\nSchools; E.W. Wilson, ex-Governor; W.A. MacCorkle, ex-Governor; John Q.\r\nDickinson, President Kanawha Valley Bank; L. Prichard, President\r\nCharleston National Bank; Geo. S. Couch, President Kanawha National\r\nBank; Ed. Reid, Cashier Kanawha National Bank; Geo. S. Laidley,\r\nSuperintended City Schools; L.E. McWhorter, President Board of\r\nEducation; Chas. K. Payne, wholesale merchant; and many others.\r\n\r\nThis invitation, coming as it did from the City Council, the state\r\nofficers, and all the substantial citizens of both races of the\r\ncommunity where I had spent my boyhood, and from which I had gone a few\r\nyears before, unknown, in poverty and ignorance, in quest of an\r\neducation, not only surprised me, but almost unmanned me. I could not\r\nunderstand what I had done to deserve it all.\r\n\r\nI accepted the invitation, and at the appointed day was met at the\r\nrailway station at Charleston by a committee headed by ex-Governor W.A.\r\nMacCorkle, and composed of men of both races. The public reception was\r\nheld in the Opera-House at Charleston. The Governor of the state, the\r\nHon. George W. Atkinson, presided, and an address of welcome was made\r\nby ex-Governor MacCorkle. A prominent part in the reception was taken\r\nby the coloured citizens. The Opera-House was filled with citizens of\r\nboth races, and among the white people were many for whom I had worked\r\nwhen I was a boy. The next day Governor and Mrs. Atkinson gave me a\r\npublic reception at the State House, which was attended by all classes.\r\n\r\nNot long after this the coloured people in Atlanta, Georgia, gave me a\r\nreception at which the Governor of the state presided, and a similar\r\nreception was given me in New Orleans, which was presided over by the\r\nMayor of the city. Invitations came from many other places which I was\r\nnot able to accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\nLast Words\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore going to Europe some events came into my life which were great\r\nsurprises to me. In fact, my whole life has largely been one of\r\nsurprises. I believe that any man’s life will be filled with constant,\r\nunexpected encouragements of this kind if he makes up his mind to do\r\nhis level best each day of his life—that is, tries to make each day\r\nreach as nearly as possible the high-water mark of pure, unselfish,\r\nuseful living. I pity the man, black or white, who has never\r\nexperienced the joy and satisfaction that come to one by reason of an\r\neffort to assist in making some one else more useful and more happy.\r\n\r\nSix months before he died, and nearly a year after he had been stricken\r\nwith paralysis, General Armstrong expressed a wish to visit Tuskegee\r\nagain before he passed away. Notwithstanding the fact that he had lost\r\nthe use of his limbs to such an extent that he was practically\r\nhelpless, his wish was gratified, and he was brought to Tuskegee. The\r\nowners of the Tuskegee Railroad, white men living in the town, offered\r\nto run a special train, without cost, out of the main station—Chehaw,\r\nfive miles away—to meet him. He arrived on the school grounds about\r\nnine o’clock in the evening. Some one had suggested that we give the\r\nGeneral a “pine-knot torchlight reception.” This plan was carried out,\r\nand the moment that his carriage entered the school grounds he began\r\npassing between two lines of lighted and waving “fat pine” wood knots\r\nheld by over a thousand students and teachers. The whole thing was so\r\nnovel and surprising that the General was completely overcome with\r\nhappiness. He remained a guest in my home for nearly two months, and,\r\nalthough almost wholly without the use of voice or limb, he spent\r\nnearly every hour in devising ways and means to help the South. Time\r\nand time again he said to me, during this visit, that it was not only\r\nthe duty of the country to assist in elevating the Negro of the South,\r\nbut the poor white man as well. At the end of his visit I resolved anew\r\nto devote myself more earnestly than ever to the cause which was so\r\nnear his heart. I said that if a man in his condition was willing to\r\nthink, work, and act, I should not be wanting in furthering in every\r\npossible way the wish of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Armstrong, a few weeks later, gave me the\r\nprivilege of getting acquainted with one of the finest, most unselfish,\r\nand most attractive men that I have ever come in contact with. I refer\r\nto the Rev. Dr. Hollis B. Frissell, now the Principal of the Hampton\r\nInstitute, and General Armstrong’s successor. Under the clear, strong,\r\nand almost perfect leadership of Dr. Frissell, Hampton has had a career\r\nof prosperity and usefulness that is all that the General could have\r\nwished for. It seems to be the constant effort of Dr. Frissell to hide\r\nhis own great personality behind that of General Armstrong—to make\r\nhimself of “no reputation” for the sake of the cause.\r\n\r\nMore than once I have been asked what was the greatest surprise that\r\never came to me. I have little hesitation in answering that question.\r\nIt was the following letter, which came to me one Sunday morning when I\r\nwas sitting on the veranda of my home at Tuskegee, surrounded by my\r\nwife and three children:—\r\n\r\nHarvard University, Cambridge, May 28, 1896.\r\n\r\nPresident Booker T. Washington,\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir: Harvard University desired to confer on you at the\r\napproaching Commencement an honorary degree; but it is our custom to\r\nconfer degrees only on gentlemen who are present. Our Commencement\r\noccurs this year on June 24, and your presence would be desirable from\r\nabout noon till about five o’clock in the afternoon. Would it be\r\npossible for you to be in Cambridge on that day?\r\n\r\nBelieve me, with great regard,\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nCharles W. Eliot.\r\n\r\nThis was a recognition that had never in the slightest manner entered\r\ninto my mind, and it was hard for me to realize that I was to be\r\nhonoured by a degree from the oldest and most renowned university in\r\nAmerica. As I sat upon my veranda, with this letter in my hand, tears\r\ncame into my eyes. My whole former life—my life as a slave on the\r\nplantation, my work in the coal-mine, the times when I was without food\r\nand clothing, when I made my bed under a sidewalk, my struggles for an\r\neducation, the trying days I had had at Tuskegee, days when I did not\r\nknow where to turn for a dollar to continue the work there, the\r\nostracism and sometimes oppression of my race,—all this passed before\r\nme and nearly overcame me.\r\n\r\nI had never sought or cared for what the world calls fame. I have\r\nalways looked upon fame as something to be used in accomplishing good.\r\nI have often said to my friends that if I can use whatever prominence\r\nmay have come to me as an instrument with which to do good, I am\r\ncontent to have it. I care for it only as a means to be used for doing\r\ngood, just as wealth may be used. The more I come into contact with\r\nwealthy people, the more I believe that they are growing in the\r\ndirection of looking upon their money simply as an instrument which God\r\nhas placed in their hand for doing good with. I never go to the office\r\nof Mr. John D. Rockefeller, who more than once has been generous to\r\nTuskegee, without being reminded of this. The close, careful, and\r\nminute investigation that he always makes in order to be sure that\r\nevery dollar that he gives will do the most good—an investigation that\r\nis just as searching as if he were investing money in a business\r\nenterprise—convinces me that the growth in this direction is most\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock, on the morning of June 24, I met President Eliot, the\r\nBoard of Overseers of Harvard University, and the other guests, at the\r\ndesignated place on the university grounds, for the purpose of being\r\nescorted to Sanders Theatre, where the Commencement exercises were to\r\nbe held and degrees conferred. Among others invited to be present for\r\nthe purpose of receiving a degree at this time were General Nelson A.\r\nMiles, Dr. Bell, the inventor of the Bell telephone, Bishop Vincent,\r\nand the Rev. Minot J. Savage. We were placed in line immediately behind\r\nthe President and the Board of Overseers, and directly afterward the\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts, escorted by the Lancers, arrived and took\r\nhis place in the line of march by the side of President Eliot. In the\r\nline there were also various other officers and professors, clad in cap\r\nand gown. In this order we marched to Sanders Theatre, where, after the\r\nusual Commencement exercises, came the conferring of the honorary\r\ndegrees. This, it seems, is always considered the most interesting\r\nfeature at Harvard. It is not known, until the individuals appear, upon\r\nwhom the honorary degrees are to be conferred, and those receiving\r\nthese honours are cheered by the students and others in proportion to\r\ntheir popularity. During the conferring of the degrees excitement and\r\nenthusiasm are at the highest pitch.\r\n\r\nWhen my name was called, I rose, and President Eliot, in beautiful and\r\nstrong English, conferred upon me the degree of Master of Arts. After\r\nthese exercises were over, those who had received honorary degrees were\r\ninvited to lunch with the President. After the lunch we were formed in\r\nline again, and were escorted by the Marshal of the day, who that year\r\nhappened to be Bishop William Lawrence, through the grounds, where, at\r\ndifferent points, those who had been honoured were called by name and\r\nreceived the Harvard yell. This march ended at Memorial Hall, where the\r\nalumni dinner was served. To see over a thousand strong men,\r\nrepresenting all that is best in State, Church, business, and\r\neducation, with the glow and enthusiasm of college loyalty and college\r\npride,—which has, I think, a peculiar Harvard flavour,—is a sight that\r\ndoes not easily fade from memory.\r\n\r\nAmong the speakers after dinner were President Eliot, Governor Roger\r\nWolcott, General Miles, Dr. Minot J. Savage, the Hon. Henry Cabot\r\nLodge, and myself. When I was called upon, I said, among other things:—\r\n\r\nIt would in some measure relieve my embarrassment if I could, even in a\r\nslight degree, feel myself worthy of the great honour which you do me\r\nto-day. Why you have called me from the Black Belt of the South, from\r\namong my humble people, to share in the honours of this occasion, is\r\nnot for me to explain; and yet it may not be inappropriate for me to\r\nsuggest that it seems to me that one of the most vital questions that\r\ntouch our American life is how to bring the strong, wealthy, and\r\nlearned into helpful touch with the poorest, most ignorant, and\r\nhumblest, and at the same time make one appreciate the vitalizing,\r\nstrengthening influence of the other. How shall we make the mansion on\r\nyon Beacon Street feel and see the need of the spirits in the lowliest\r\ncabin in Alabama cotton-fields or Louisiana sugar-bottoms? This problem\r\nHarvard University is solving, not by bringing itself down, but by\r\nbringing the masses up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my life in the past has meant anything in the lifting up of my\r\npeople and the bringing about of better relations between your race and\r\nmine, I assure you from this day it will mean doubly more. In the\r\neconomy of God there is but one standard by which an individual can\r\nsucceed—there is but one for a race. This country demands that every\r\nrace shall measure itself by the American standard. By it a race must\r\nrise or fall, succeed or fail, and in the last analysis mere sentiment\r\ncounts for little. During the next half-century and more, my race must\r\ncontinue passing through the severe American crucible. We are to be\r\ntested in our patience, our forbearance, our perseverance, our power to\r\nendure wrong, to withstand temptations, to economize, to acquire and\r\nuse skill; in our ability to compete, to succeed in commerce, to\r\ndisregard the superficial for the real, the appearance for the\r\nsubstance, to be great and yet small, learned and yet simple, high and\r\nyet the servant of all.\r\n\r\nAs this was the first time that a New England university had conferred\r\nan honorary degree upon a Negro, it was the occasion of much newspaper\r\ncomment throughout the country. A correspondent of a New York paper\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\nWhen the name of Booker T. Washington was called, and he arose to\r\nacknowledge and accept, there was such an outburst of applause as\r\ngreeted no other name except that of the popular soldier patriot,\r\nGeneral Miles. The applause was not studied and stiff, sympathetic and\r\ncondoling; it was enthusiasm and admiration. Every part of the audience\r\nfrom pit to gallery joined in, and a glow covered the cheeks of those\r\naround me, proving sincere appreciation of the rising struggle of an\r\nex-slave and the work he has accomplished for his race.\r\n\r\nA Boston paper said, editorially:—\r\n\r\nIn conferring the honorary degree of Master of Arts upon the Principal\r\nof Tuskegee Institute, Harvard University has honoured itself as well\r\nas the object of this distinction. The work which Professor Booker T.\r\nWashington has accomplished for the education, good citizenship, and\r\npopular enlightenment in his chosen field of labour in the South\r\nentitles him to rank with our national benefactors. The university\r\nwhich can claim him on its list of sons, whether in regular course or\r\nhonoris causa, may be proud.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that Mr. Washington is the first of his race to\r\nreceive an honorary degree from a New England university. This, in\r\nitself, is a distinction. But the degree was not conferred because Mr.\r\nWashington is a coloured man, or because he was born in slavery, but\r\nbecause he has shown, by his work for the elevation of the people of\r\nthe Black Belt of the South, a genius and a broad humanity which count\r\nfor greatness in any man, whether his skin be white or black.\r\n\r\nAnother Boston paper said:—\r\n\r\nIt is Harvard which, first among New England colleges, confers an\r\nhonorary degree upon a black man. No one who has followed the history\r\nof Tuskegee and its work can fail to admire the courage, persistence,\r\nand splendid common sense of Booker T. Washington. Well may Harvard\r\nhonour the ex-slave, the value of whose services, alike to his race and\r\ncountry, only the future can estimate.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the New York Times wrote:—\r\n\r\nAll the speeches were enthusiastically received, but the coloured man\r\ncarried off the oratorical honours, and the applause which broke out\r\nwhen he had finished was vociferous and long-continued.\r\n\r\nSoon after I began work at Tuskegee I formed a resolution, in the\r\nsecret of my heart, that I would try to build up a school that would be\r\nof so much service to the country that the President of the United\r\nStates would one day come to see it. This was, I confess, rather a bold\r\nresolution, and for a number of years I kept it hidden in my own\r\nthoughts, not daring to share it with any one.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1897, I made the first move in this direction, and that\r\nwas in securing a visit from a member of President McKinley’s Cabinet,\r\nthe Hon. James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture. He came to deliver an\r\naddress at the formal opening of the Slater-Armstrong Agricultural\r\nBuilding, our first large building to be used for the purpose of giving\r\ntraining to our students in agriculture and kindred branches.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1898 I heard that President McKinley was likely to visit\r\nAtlanta, Georgia, for the purpose of taking part in the Peace Jubilee\r\nexercises to be held there to commemorate the successful close of the\r\nSpanish-American war. At this time I had been hard at work, together\r\nwith our teachers, for eighteen years, trying to build up a school that\r\nwe thought would be of service to the Nation, and I determined to make\r\na direct effort to secure a visit from the President and his Cabinet. I\r\nwent to Washington, and I was not long in the city before I found my\r\nway to the White House. When I got there I found the waiting rooms full\r\nof people, and my heart began to sink, for I feared there would not be\r\nmuch chance of my seeing the President that day, if at all. But, at any\r\nrate, I got an opportunity to see Mr. J. Addison Porter, the secretary\r\nto the President, and explained to him my mission. Mr. Porter kindly\r\nsent my card directly to the President, and in a few minutes word came\r\nfrom Mr. McKinley that he would see me.\r\n\r\nHow any man can see so many people of all kinds, with all kinds of\r\nerrands, and do so much hard work, and still keep himself calm,\r\npatient, and fresh for each visitor in the way that President McKinley\r\ndoes, I cannot understand. When I saw the President he kindly thanked\r\nme for the work which we were doing at Tuskegee for the interests of\r\nthe country. I then told him, briefly, the object of my visit. I\r\nimpressed upon him the fact that a visit from the Chief Executive of\r\nthe Nation would not only encourage our students and teachers, but\r\nwould help the entire race. He seemed interested, but did not make a\r\npromise to go to Tuskegee, for the reason that his plans about going to\r\nAtlanta were not then fully made; but he asked me to call the matter to\r\nhis attention a few weeks later.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the following month the President had definitely\r\ndecided to attend the Peace Jubilee at Atlanta. I went to Washington\r\nagain and saw him, with a view of getting him to extend his trip to\r\nTuskegee. On this second visit Mr. Charles W. Hare, a prominent white\r\ncitizen of Tuskegee, kindly volunteered to accompany me, to reenforce\r\nmy invitation with one from the white people of Tuskegee and the\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nJust previous to my going to Washington the second time, the country\r\nhad been excited, and the coloured people greatly depressed, because of\r\nseveral severe race riots which had occurred at different points in the\r\nSouth. As soon as I saw the President, I perceived that his heart was\r\ngreatly burdened by reason of these race disturbances. Although there\r\nwere many people waiting to see him, he detained me for some time,\r\ndiscussing the condition and prospects of the race. He remarked several\r\ntimes that he was determined to show his interest and faith in the\r\nrace, not merely in words, but by acts. When I told him that I thought\r\nthat at that time scarcely anything would go farther in giving hope and\r\nencouragement to the race than the fact that the President of the\r\nNation would be willing to travel one hundred and forty miles out of\r\nhis way to spend a day at a Negro institution, he seemed deeply\r\nimpressed.\r\n\r\nWhile I was with the President, a white citizen of Atlanta, a Democrat\r\nand an ex-slaveholder, came into the room, and the President asked his\r\nopinion as to the wisdom of his going to Tuskegee. Without hesitation\r\nthe Atlanta man replied that it was the proper thing for him to do.\r\nThis opinion was reenforced by that friend of the race, Dr. J.L.M.\r\nCurry. The President promised that he would visit our school on the\r\n16th of December.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that the President was going to visit our school,\r\nthe white citizens of the town of Tuskegee—a mile distant from the\r\nschool—were as much pleased as were our students and teachers. The\r\nwhite people of this town, including both men and women, began\r\narranging to decorate the town, and to form themselves into committees\r\nfor the purpose of cooperating with the officers of our school in order\r\nthat the distinguished visitor might have a fitting reception. I think\r\nI never realized before this how much the white people of Tuskegee and\r\nvicinity thought of our institution. During the days when we were\r\npreparing for the President’s reception, dozens of these people came to\r\nme and said that, while they did not want to push themselves into\r\nprominence, if there was anything they could do to help, or to relieve\r\nme personally, I had but to intimate it and they would be only too glad\r\nto assist. In fact, the thing that touched me almost as deeply as the\r\nvisit of the President itself was the deep pride which all classes of\r\ncitizens in Alabama seemed to take in our work.\r\n\r\nThe morning of December 16th brought to the little city of Tuskegee\r\nsuch a crowd as it had never seen before. With the President came Mrs.\r\nMcKinley and all of the Cabinet officers but one; and most of them\r\nbrought their wives or some members of their families. Several\r\nprominent generals came, including General Shafter and General Joseph\r\nWheeler, who were recently returned from the Spanish-American war.\r\nThere was also a host of newspaper correspondents. The Alabama\r\nLegislature was in session in Montgomery at this time. This body passed\r\na resolution to adjourn for the purpose of visiting Tuskegee. Just\r\nbefore the arrival of the President’s party the Legislature arrived,\r\nheaded by the governor and other state officials.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Tuskegee had decorated the town from the station to the\r\nschool in a generous manner. In order to economize in the matter of\r\ntime, we arranged to have the whole school pass in review before the\r\nPresident. Each student carried a stalk of sugar-cane with some open\r\nbolls of cotton fastened to the end of it. Following the students the\r\nwork of all departments of the school passed in review, displayed on\r\n“floats” drawn by horses, mules, and oxen. On these floats we tried to\r\nexhibit not only the present work of the school, but to show the\r\ncontrasts between the old methods of doing things and the new. As an\r\nexample, we showed the old method of dairying in contrast with the\r\nimproved methods, the old methods of tilling the soil in contrast with\r\nthe new, the old methods of cooking and housekeeping in contrast with\r\nthe new. These floats consumed an hour and a half of time in passing.\r\n\r\nIn his address in our large, new chapel, which the students had\r\nrecently completed, the President said, among other things:—\r\n\r\nTo meet you under such pleasant auspices and to have the opportunity of\r\na personal observation of your work is indeed most gratifying. The\r\nTuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute is ideal in its conception,\r\nand has already a large and growing reputation in the country, and is\r\nnot unknown abroad. I congratulate all who are associated in this\r\nundertaking for the good work which it is doing in the education of its\r\nstudents to lead lives of honour and usefulness, thus exalting the race\r\nfor which it was established.\r\n\r\nNowhere, I think, could a more delightful location have been chosen for\r\nthis unique educational experiment, which has attracted the attention\r\nand won the support even of conservative philanthropists in all\r\nsections of the country.\r\n\r\nTo speak of Tuskegee without paying special tribute to Booker T.\r\nWashington’s genius and perseverance would be impossible. The inception\r\nof this noble enterprise was his, and he deserves high credit for it.\r\nHis was the enthusiasm and enterprise which made its steady progress\r\npossible and established in the institution its present high standard\r\nof accomplishment. He has won a worthy reputation as one of the great\r\nleaders of his race, widely known and much respected at home and abroad\r\nas an accomplished educator, a great orator, and a true philanthropist.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John D. Long, the Secretary of the Navy, said in part:—\r\n\r\nI cannot make a speech to-day. My heart is too full—full of hope,\r\nadmiration, and pride for my countrymen of both sections and both\r\ncolours. I am filled with gratitude and admiration for your work, and\r\nfrom this time forward I shall have absolute confidence in your\r\nprogress and in the solution of the problem in which you are engaged.\r\n\r\nThe problem, I say, has been solved. A picture has been presented\r\nto-day which should be put upon canvas with the pictures of Washington\r\nand Lincoln, and transmitted to future time and generations—a picture\r\nwhich the press of the country should spread broadcast over the land, a\r\nmost dramatic picture, and that picture is this: The President of the\r\nUnited States standing on this platform; on one side the Governor of\r\nAlabama, on the other, completing the trinity, a representative of a\r\nrace only a few years ago in bondage, the coloured President of the\r\nTuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute.\r\n\r\nGod bless the President under whose majesty such a scene as that is\r\npresented to the American people. God bless the state of Alabama, which\r\nis showing that it can deal with this problem for itself. God bless the\r\norator, philanthropist, and disciple of the Great Master—who, if he\r\nwere on earth, would be doing the same work—Booker T. Washington.\r\n\r\nPostmaster General Smith closed the address which he made with these\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\nWe have witnessed many spectacles within the last few days. We have\r\nseen the magnificent grandeur and the magnificent achievements of one\r\nof the great metropolitan cities of the South. We have seen heroes of\r\nthe war pass by in procession. We have seen floral parades. But I am\r\nsure my colleagues will agree with me in saying that we have witnessed\r\nno spectacle more impressive and more encouraging, more inspiring for\r\nour future, than that which we have witnessed here this morning.\r\n\r\nSome days after the President returned to Washington I received the\r\nletter which follows:—\r\n\r\nExecutive Mansion, Washington, Dec. 23, 1899.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: By this mail I take pleasure in sending you engrossed copies\r\nof the souvenir of the visit of the President to your institution.\r\nThese sheets bear the autographs of the President and the members of\r\nthe Cabinet who accompanied him on the trip. Let me take this\r\nopportunity of congratulating you most heartily and sincerely upon the\r\ngreat success of the exercises provided for and entertainment furnished\r\nus under your auspices during our visit to Tuskegee. Every feature of\r\nthe programme was perfectly executed and was viewed or participated in\r\nwith the heartiest satisfaction by every visitor present. The unique\r\nexhibition which you gave of your pupils engaged in their industrial\r\nvocations was not only artistic but thoroughly impressive. The tribute\r\npaid by the President and his Cabinet to your work was none too high,\r\nand forms a most encouraging augury, I think, for the future prosperity\r\nof your institution. I cannot close without assuring you that the\r\nmodesty shown by yourself in the exercises was most favourably\r\ncommented upon by all the members of our party.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes for the continued advance of your most useful and\r\npatriotic undertaking, kind personal regards, and the compliments of\r\nthe season, believe me, always,\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nJohn Addison Porter,\r\n\r\nSecretary to the President.\r\n\r\nTo President Booker T. Washington, Tuskegee Normal and Industrial\r\nInstitute, Tuskegee, Ala.\r\n\r\nTwenty years have now passed since I made the first humble effort at\r\nTuskegee, in a broken-down shanty and an old hen-house, without owning\r\na dollar’s worth of property, and with but one teacher and thirty\r\nstudents. At the present time the institution owns twenty-three hundred\r\nacres of land, one thousand of which are under cultivation each year,\r\nentirely by student labour. There are now upon the grounds, counting\r\nlarge and small, sixty-six buildings; and all except four of these have\r\nbeen almost wholly erected by the labour of our students. While the\r\nstudents are at work upon the land and in erecting buildings, they are\r\ntaught, by competent instructors, the latest methods of agriculture and\r\nthe trades connected with building.\r\n\r\nThere are in constant operation at the school, in connection with\r\nthorough academic and religious training, thirty industrial\r\ndepartments. All of these teach industries at which our men and women\r\ncan find immediate employment as soon as they leave the institution.\r\nThe only difficulty now is that the demand for our graduates from both\r\nwhite and black people in the South is so great that we cannot supply\r\nmore than one-half the persons for whom applications come to us.\r\nNeither have we the buildings nor the money for current expenses to\r\nenable us to admit to the school more than one-half the young men and\r\nwomen who apply to us for admission.\r\n\r\nIn our industrial teaching we keep three things in mind: first, that\r\nthe student shall be so educated that he shall be enabled to meet\r\nconditions as they exist now, in the part of the South where he\r\nlives—in a word, to be able to do the thing which the world wants done;\r\nsecond, that every student who graduates from the school shall have\r\nenough skill, coupled with intelligence and moral character, to enable\r\nhim to make a living for himself and others; third, to send every\r\ngraduate out feeling and knowing that labour is dignified and\r\nbeautiful—to make each one love labour instead of trying to escape it.\r\nIn addition to the agricultural training which we give to young men,\r\nand the training given to our girls in all the usual domestic\r\nemployments, we now train a number of girls in agriculture each year.\r\nThese girls are taught gardening, fruit-growing, dairying, bee-culture,\r\nand poultry-raising.\r\n\r\nWhile the institution is in no sense denominational, we have a\r\ndepartment known as the Phelps Hall Bible Training School, in which a\r\nnumber of students are prepared for the ministry and other forms of\r\nChristian work, especially work in the country districts. What is\r\nequally important, each one of the students works half of each day at\r\nsome industry, in order to get skill and the love of work, so that when\r\nhe goes out from the institution he is prepared to set the people with\r\nwhom he goes to labour a proper example in the matter of industry.\r\n\r\nThe value of our property is now over $700,000. If we add to this our\r\nendowment fund, which at present is $1,000,000, the value of the total\r\nproperty is now $1,700,000. Aside from the need for more buildings and\r\nfor money for current expenses, the endowment fund should be increased\r\nto at least $3,000,000. The annual current expenses are now about\r\n$150,000. The greater part of this I collect each year by going from\r\ndoor to door and from house to house. All of our property is free from\r\nmortgage, and is deeded to an undenominational board of trustees who\r\nhave the control of the institution.\r\n\r\nFrom thirty students the number has grown to fourteen hundred, coming\r\nfrom twenty-seven states and territories, from Africa, Cuba, Porto\r\nRico, Jamaica, and other foreign countries. In our departments there\r\nare one hundred and ten officers and instructors; and if we add the\r\nfamilies of our instructors, we have a constant population upon our\r\ngrounds of not far from seventeen hundred people.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked how we keep so large a body of people together,\r\nand at the same time keep them out of mischief. There are two answers:\r\nthat the men and women who come to us for an education are in earnest;\r\nand that everybody is kept busy. The following outline of our daily\r\nwork will testify to this:—\r\n\r\n5 a.m., rising bell; 5.50 a.m., warning breakfast bell; 6 a.m.,\r\nbreakfast bell; 6.20 a.m., breakfast over; 6.20 to 6.50 a.m., rooms are\r\ncleaned; 6.50, work bell; 7.30, morning study hours; 8.20, morning\r\nschool bell; 8.25, inspection of young men’s toilet in ranks; 8.40,\r\ndevotional exercises in chapel; 8.55, “five minutes with the daily\r\nnews;” 9 a.m., class work begins; 12, class work closes; 12.15 p.m.,\r\ndinner; 1 p.m., work bell; 1.30 p.m., class work begins; 3.30 p.m.,\r\nclass work ends; 5.30 p.m., bell to “knock off” work; 6 p.m., supper;\r\n7.10 p.m., evening prayers; 7.30 p.m., evening study hours; 8.45 p.m.,\r\nevening study hour closes; 9.20 p.m., warning retiring bell; 9.30 p.m.,\r\nretiring bell.\r\n\r\nWe try to keep constantly in mind the fact that the worth of the school\r\nis to be judged by its graduates. Counting those who have finished the\r\nfull course, together with those who have taken enough training to\r\nenable them to do reasonably good work, we can safely say that at least\r\nsix thousand men and women from Tuskegee are now at work in different\r\nparts of the South; men and women who, by their own example or by\r\ndirect efforts, are showing the masses of our race now to improve their\r\nmaterial, educational, and moral and religious life. What is equally\r\nimportant, they are exhibiting a degree of common sense and\r\nself-control which is causing better relations to exist between the\r\nraces, and is causing the Southern white man to learn to believe in the\r\nvalue of educating the men and women of my race. Aside from this, there\r\nis the influence that is constantly being exerted through the mothers’\r\nmeeting and the plantation work conducted by Mrs. Washington.\r\n\r\nWherever our graduates go, the changes which soon begin to appear in\r\nthe buying of land, improving homes, saving money, in education, and in\r\nhigh moral characters are remarkable. Whole communities are fast being\r\nrevolutionized through the instrumentality of these men and women.\r\n\r\nTen years ago I organized at Tuskegee the first Negro Conference. This\r\nis an annual gathering which now brings to the school eight or nine\r\nhundred representative men and women of the race, who come to spend a\r\nday in finding out what the actual industrial, mental, and moral\r\nconditions of the people are, and in forming plans for improvement. Out\r\nfrom this central Negro Conference at Tuskegee have grown numerous\r\nstate and local conferences which are doing the same kind of work. As a\r\nresult of the influence of these gatherings, one delegate reported at\r\nthe last annual meeting that ten families in his community had bought\r\nand paid for homes. On the day following the annual Negro Conference,\r\nthere is the “Workers’ Conference.” This is composed of officers and\r\nteachers who are engaged in educational work in the larger institutions\r\nin the South. The Negro Conference furnishes a rare opportunity for\r\nthese workers to study the real condition of the rank and file of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1900, with the assistance of such prominent coloured\r\nmen as Mr. T. Thomas Fortune, who has always upheld my hands in every\r\neffort, I organized the National Negro Business League, which held its\r\nfirst meeting in Boston, and brought together for the first time a\r\nlarge number of the coloured men who are engaged in various lines of\r\ntrade or business in different parts of the United States. Thirty\r\nstates were represented at our first meeting. Out of this national\r\nmeeting grew state and local business leagues.\r\n\r\nIn addition to looking after the executive side of the work at\r\nTuskegee, and raising the greater part of the money for the support of\r\nthe school, I cannot seem to escape the duty of answering at least a\r\npart of the calls which come to me unsought to address Southern white\r\naudiences and audiences of my own race, as well as frequent gatherings\r\nin the North. As to how much of my time is spent in this way, the\r\nfollowing clipping from a Buffalo (N.Y.) paper will tell. This has\r\nreference to an occasion when I spoke before the National Educational\r\nAssociation in that city.\r\n\r\nBooker T. Washington, the foremost educator among the coloured people\r\nof the world, was a very busy man from the time he arrived in the city\r\nthe other night from the West and registered at the Iroquois. He had\r\nhardly removed the stains of travel when it was time to partake of\r\nsupper. Then he held a public levee in the parlours of the Iroquois\r\nuntil eight o’clock. During that time he was greeted by over two\r\nhundred eminent teachers and educators from all parts of the United\r\nStates. Shortly after eight o’clock he was driven in a carriage to\r\nMusic Hall, and in one hour and a half he made two ringing addresses,\r\nto as many as five thousand people, on Negro education. Then Mr.\r\nWashington was taken in charge by a delegation of coloured citizens,\r\nheaded by the Rev. Mr. Watkins, and hustled off to a small informal\r\nreception, arranged in honour of the visitor by the people of his race.\r\n\r\nNor can I, in addition to making these addresses, escape the duty of\r\ncalling the attention of the South and of the country in general,\r\nthrough the medium of the press, to matters that pertain to the\r\ninterests of both races. This, for example, I have done in regard to\r\nthe evil habit of lynching. When the Louisiana State Constitutional\r\nConvention was in session, I wrote an open letter to that body pleading\r\nfor justice for the race. In all such efforts I have received warm and\r\nhearty support from the Southern newspapers, as well as from those in\r\nall other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nDespite superficial and temporary signs which might lead one to\r\nentertain a contrary opinion, there was never a time when I felt more\r\nhopeful for the race than I do at the present. The great human law that\r\nin the end recognizes and rewards merit is everlasting and universal.\r\nThe outside world does not know, neither can it appreciate, the\r\nstruggle that is constantly going on in the hearts of both the Southern\r\nwhite people and their former slaves to free themselves from racial\r\nprejudice; and while both races are thus struggling they should have\r\nthe sympathy, the support, and the forbearance of the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs I write the closing words of this autobiography I find myself—not by\r\ndesign—in the city of Richmond, Virginia: the city which only a few\r\ndecades ago was the capital of the Southern Confederacy, and where,\r\nabout twenty-five years ago, because of my poverty I slept night after\r\nnight under a sidewalk.\r\n\r\nThis time I am in Richmond as the guest of the coloured people of the\r\ncity; and came at their request to deliver an address last night to\r\nboth races in the Academy of Music, the largest and finest audience\r\nroom in the city. This was the first time that the coloured people had\r\never been permitted to use this hall. The day before I came, the City\r\nCouncil passed a vote to attend the meeting in a body to hear me speak.\r\nThe state Legislature, including the House of Delegates and the Senate,\r\nalso passed a unanimous vote to attend in a body. In the presence of\r\nhundreds of coloured people, many distinguished white citizens, the\r\nCity Council, the state Legislature, and state officials, I delivered\r\nmy message, which was one of hope and cheer; and from the bottom of my\r\nheart I thanked both races for this welcome back to the state that gave\r\nme birth.",
