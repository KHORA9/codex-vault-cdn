I am also\r\ngreatly indebted to a large number of correspondents for the\r\ncommunication of a surprising number of new facts and remarks. These\r\nhave been so numerous, that I have been able to use only the more\r\nimportant ones; and of these, as well as of the more important\r\ncorrections, I will append a list. Some new illustrations have been\r\nintroduced, and four of the old drawings have been replaced by better\r\nones, done from life by Mr. T.W. Wood. I must especially call attention\r\nto some observations which I owe to the kindness of Prof. Huxley (given\r\nas a supplement at the end of Part I.), on the nature of the\r\ndifferences between the brains of man and the higher apes. I have been\r\nparticularly glad to give these observations, because during the last\r\nfew years several memoirs on the subject have appeared on the\r\nContinent, and their importance has been, in some cases, greatly\r\nexaggerated by popular writers.\r\n\r\nI may take this opportunity of remarking that my critics frequently\r\nassume that I attribute all changes of corporeal structure and mental\r\npower exclusively to the natural selection of such variations as are\r\noften called spontaneous; whereas, even in the first edition of the\r\n‘Origin of Species,’ I distinctly stated that great weight must be\r\nattributed to the inherited effects of use and disuse, with respect\r\nboth to the body and mind. I also attributed some amount of\r\nmodification to the direct and prolonged action of changed conditions\r\nof life. Some allowance, too, must be made for occasional reversions of\r\nstructure; nor must we forget what I have called “correlated” growth,\r\nmeaning, thereby, that various parts of the organisation are in some\r\nunknown manner so connected, that when one part varies, so do others;\r\nand if variations in the one are accumulated by selection, other parts\r\nwill be modified. Again, it has been said by several critics, that when\r\nI found that many details of structure in man could not be explained\r\nthrough natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave,\r\nhowever, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first\r\nedition of the ‘Origin of Species,’ and I there stated that it was\r\napplicable to man. This subject of sexual selection has been treated at\r\nfull length in the present work, simply because an opportunity was here\r\nfirst afforded me. I have been struck with the likeness of many of the\r\nhalf-favourable criticisms on sexual selection, with those which\r\nappeared at first on natural selection; such as, that it would explain\r\nsome few details, but certainly was not applicable to the extent to\r\nwhich I have employed it. My conviction of the power of sexual\r\nselection remains unshaken; but it is probable, or almost certain, that\r\nseveral of my conclusions will hereafter be found erroneous; this can\r\nhardly fail to be the case in the first treatment of a subject. When\r\nnaturalists have become familiar with the idea of sexual selection, it\r\nwill, as I believe, be much more largely accepted; and it has already\r\nbeen fully and favourably received by several capable judges.\r\n\r\nDOWN, BECKENHAM, KENT, September, 1874.\r\n\r\nFirst Edition February 24, 1871.

During many years I collected\r\nnotes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of\r\npublishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to\r\npublish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices\r\nagainst my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first\r\nedition of my ‘Origin of Species,’ that by this work “light would be\r\nthrown on the origin of man and his history;” and this implies that man\r\nmust be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion\r\nrespecting his manner of appearance on this earth. Now the case wears a\r\nwholly different aspect. When a naturalist like Carl Vogt ventures to\r\nsay in his address as President of the National Institution of Geneva\r\n(1869), “personne, en Europe au moins, n’ose plus soutenir la creation\r\nindépendante et de toutes pièces, des espèces,” it is manifest that at\r\nleast a large number of naturalists must admit that species are the\r\nmodified descendants of other species; and this especially holds good\r\nwith the younger and rising naturalists. The greater number accept the\r\nagency of natural selection; though some urge, whether with justice the\r\nfuture must decide, that I have greatly overrated its importance. Of\r\nthe older and honoured chiefs in natural science, many unfortunately\r\nare still opposed to evolution in every form.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the views now adopted by most naturalists, and which\r\nwill ultimately, as in every other case, be followed by others who are\r\nnot scientific, I have been led to put together my notes, so as to see\r\nhow far the general conclusions arrived at in my former works were\r\napplicable to man. This seemed all the more desirable, as I had never\r\ndeliberately applied these views to a species taken singly. When we\r\nconfine our attention to any one form, we are deprived of the weighty\r\narguments derived from the nature of the affinities which connect\r\ntogether whole groups of organisms—their geographical distribution in\r\npast and present times, and their geological succession. The\r\nhomological structure, embryological development, and rudimentary\r\norgans of a species remain to be considered, whether it be man or any\r\nother animal, to which our attention may be directed; but these great\r\nclasses of facts afford, as it appears to me, ample and conclusive\r\nevidence in favour of the principle of gradual evolution. The strong\r\nsupport derived from the other arguments should, however, always be\r\nkept before the mind.\r\n\r\nThe sole object of this work is to consider, firstly, whether man, like\r\nevery other species, is descended from some pre-existing form;\r\nsecondly, the manner of his development; and thirdly, the value of the\r\ndifferences between the so-called races of man. As I shall confine\r\nmyself to these points, it will not be necessary to describe in detail\r\nthe differences between the several races—an enormous subject which has\r\nbeen fully described in many valuable works. The high antiquity of man\r\nhas recently been demonstrated by the labours of a host of eminent men,\r\nbeginning with M. Boucher de Perthes; and this is the indispensable\r\nbasis for understanding his origin. I shall, therefore, take this\r\nconclusion for granted, and may refer my readers to the admirable\r\ntreatises of Sir Charles Lyell, Sir John Lubbock, and others. Nor shall\r\nI have occasion to do more than to allude to the amount of difference\r\nbetween man and the anthropomorphous apes; for Prof. Huxley, in the\r\nopinion of most competent judges, has conclusively shewn that in every\r\nvisible character man differs less from the higher apes, than these do\r\nfrom the lower members of the same order of Primates.\r\n\r\nThis work contains hardly any original facts in regard to man; but as\r\nthe conclusions at which I arrived, after drawing up a rough draft,\r\nappeared to me interesting, I thought that they might interest others.\r\nIt has often and confidently been asserted, that man’s origin can never\r\nbe known: but ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does\r\nknowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much,\r\nwho so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved\r\nby science. The conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other\r\nspecies of some ancient, lower, and extinct form, is not in any degree\r\nnew. Lamarck long ago came to this conclusion, which has lately been\r\nmaintained by several eminent naturalists and philosophers; for\r\ninstance, by Wallace, Huxley, Lyell, Vogt, Lubbock, Buchner, Rolle,\r\netc. (1. As the works of the first-named authors are so well known, I\r\nneed not give the titles; but as those of the latter are less well\r\nknown in England, I will give them:—‘Sechs Vorlesungen über die\r\nDarwin’sche Theorie:’ zweite Auflage, 1868, von Dr L. Buchner;\r\ntranslated into French under the title ‘Conférences sur la Théorie\r\nDarwinienne,’ 1869. ‘Der Mensch im Lichte der Darwin’sche Lehre,’ 1865,\r\nvon Dr. F. Rolle. I will not attempt to give references to all the\r\nauthors who have taken the same side of the question. Thus G.\r\nCanestrini has published (‘Annuario della Soc. d. Nat.,’ Modena, 1867,\r\npage 81) a very curious paper on rudimentary characters, as bearing on\r\nthe origin of man. Another work has (1869) been published by Dr.\r\nFrancesco Barrago, bearing in Italian the title of “Man, made in the\r\nimage of God, was also made in the image of the ape.”), and especially\r\nby Haeckel. This last naturalist, besides his great work, ‘Generelle\r\nMorphologie’ (1866), has recently (1868, with a second edition in\r\n1870), published his ‘Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte,’ in which he\r\nfully discusses the genealogy of man. If this work had appeared before\r\nmy essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it.\r\nAlmost all the conclusions at which I have arrived I find confirmed by\r\nthis naturalist, whose knowledge on many points is much fuller than\r\nmine. Wherever I have added any fact or view from Prof. Haeckel’s\r\nwritings, I give his authority in the text; other statements I leave as\r\nthey originally stood in my manuscript, occasionally giving in the\r\nfoot-notes references to his works, as a confirmation of the more\r\ndoubtful or interesting points.\r\n\r\nDuring many years it has seemed to me highly probable that sexual\r\nselection has played an important part in differentiating the races of\r\nman; but in my ‘Origin of Species’ (first edition, page 199) I\r\ncontented myself by merely alluding to this belief. When I came to\r\napply this view to man, I found it indispensable to treat the whole\r\nsubject in full detail. (2. Prof. Haeckel was the only author who, at\r\nthe time when this work first appeared, had discussed the subject of\r\nsexual selection, and had seen its full importance, since the\r\npublication of the ‘Origin’; and this he did in a very able manner in\r\nhis various works.) Consequently the second part of the present work,\r\ntreating of sexual selection, has extended to an inordinate length,\r\ncompared with the first part; but this could not be avoided.\r\n\r\nI had intended adding to the present volumes an essay on the expression\r\nof the various emotions by man and the lower animals. My attention was\r\ncalled to this subject many years ago by Sir Charles Bell’s admirable\r\nwork. This illustrious anatomist maintains that man is endowed with\r\ncertain muscles solely for the sake of expressing his emotions. As this\r\nview is obviously opposed to the belief that man is descended from some\r\nother and lower form, it was necessary for me to consider it. I\r\nlikewise wished to ascertain how far the emotions are expressed in the\r\nsame manner by the different races of man. But owing to the length of\r\nthe present work, I have thought it better to reserve my essay for\r\nseparate publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\nTHE DESCENT OR ORIGIN OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTHE EVIDENCE OF THE DESCENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature of the evidence bearing on the origin of man—Homologous\r\nstructures in man and the lower animals—Miscellaneous points of\r\ncorrespondence—Development—Rudimentary structures, muscles, sense-\r\norgans, hair, bones, reproductive organs, etc.—The bearing of these\r\nthree great classes of facts on the origin of man.\r\n\r\nHe who wishes to decide whether man is the modified descendant of some\r\npre-existing form, would probably first enquire whether man varies,\r\nhowever slightly, in bodily structure and in mental faculties; and if\r\nso, whether the variations are transmitted to his offspring in\r\naccordance with the laws which prevail with the lower animals. Again,\r\nare the variations the result, as far as our ignorance permits us to\r\njudge, of the same general causes, and are they governed by the same\r\ngeneral laws, as in the case of other organisms; for instance, by\r\ncorrelation, the inherited effects of use and disuse, etc.? Is man\r\nsubject to similar malconformations, the result of arrested\r\ndevelopment, of reduplication of parts, etc., and does he display in\r\nany of his anomalies reversion to some former and ancient type of\r\nstructure? It might also naturally be enquired whether man, like so\r\nmany other animals, has given rise to varieties and sub-races,\r\ndiffering but slightly from each other, or to races differing so much\r\nthat they must be classed as doubtful species? How are such races\r\ndistributed over the world; and how, when crossed, do they react on\r\neach other in the first and succeeding generations? And so with many\r\nother points.\r\n\r\nThe enquirer would next come to the important point, whether man tends\r\nto increase at so rapid a rate, as to lead to occasional severe\r\nstruggles for existence; and consequently to beneficial variations,\r\nwhether in body or mind, being preserved, and injurious ones\r\neliminated. Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be\r\napplied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally\r\nbecome extinct? We shall see that all these questions, as indeed is\r\nobvious in respect to most of them, must be answered in the\r\naffirmative, in the same manner as with the lower animals. But the\r\nseveral considerations just referred to may be conveniently deferred\r\nfor a time: and we will first see how far the bodily structure of man\r\nshews traces, more or less plain, of his descent from some lower form.\r\nIn succeeding chapters the mental powers of man, in comparison with\r\nthose of the lower animals, will be considered.\r\n\r\nTHE BODILY STRUCTURE OF MAN.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that man is constructed on the same general type or\r\nmodel as other mammals. All the bones in his skeleton can be compared\r\nwith corresponding bones in a monkey, bat, or seal. So it is with his\r\nmuscles, nerves, blood-vessels and internal viscera. The brain, the\r\nmost important of all the organs, follows the same law, as shewn by\r\nHuxley and other anatomists. Bischoff (1. ‘Grosshirnwindungen des\r\nMenschen,’ 1868, s. 96. The conclusions of this author, as well as\r\nthose of Gratiolet and Aeby, concerning the brain, will be discussed by\r\nProf. Huxley in the Appendix alluded to in the Preface to this\r\nedition.), who is a hostile witness, admits that every chief fissure\r\nand fold in the brain of man has its analogy in that of the orang; but\r\nhe adds that at no period of development do their brains perfectly\r\nagree; nor could perfect agreement be expected, for otherwise their\r\nmental powers would have been the same. Vulpian (2. ‘Lec. sur la Phys.’\r\n1866, page 890, as quoted by M. Dally, ‘L’Ordre des Primates et le\r\nTransformisme,’ 1868, page 29.), remarks: “Les différences réelles qui\r\nexistent entre l’encephale de l’homme et celui des singes supérieurs,\r\nsont bien minimes. Il ne faut pas se faire d’illusions a cet égard.\r\nL’homme est bien plus près des singes anthropomorphes par les\r\ncaractères anatomiques de son cerveau que ceux-ci ne le sont non\r\nseulement des autres mammifères, mais même de certains quadrumanes, des\r\nguenons et des macaques.” But it would be superfluous here to give\r\nfurther details on the correspondence between man and the higher\r\nmammals in the structure of the brain and all other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be worth while to specify a few points, not directly\r\nor obviously connected with structure, by which this correspondence or\r\nrelationship is well shewn.\r\n\r\nMan is liable to receive from the lower animals, and to communicate to\r\nthem, certain diseases, as hydrophobia, variola, the glanders,\r\nsyphilis, cholera, herpes, etc. (3. Dr. W. Lauder Lindsay has treated\r\nthis subject at some length in the ‘Journal of Mental Science,’ July\r\n1871; and in the ‘Edinburgh Veterinary Review,’ July 1858.); and this\r\nfact proves the close similarity (4. A Reviewer has criticised\r\n(‘British Quarterly Review,’ Oct. 1st, 1871, page 472) what I have here\r\nsaid with much severity and contempt; but as I do not use the term\r\nidentity, I cannot see that I am greatly in error. There appears to me\r\na strong analogy between the same infection or contagion producing the\r\nsame result, or one closely similar, in two distinct animals, and the\r\ntesting of two distinct fluids by the same chemical reagent.) of their\r\ntissues and blood, both in minute structure and composition, far more\r\nplainly than does their comparison under the best microscope, or by the\r\naid of the best chemical analysis. Monkeys are liable to many of the\r\nsame non-contagious diseases as we are; thus Rengger (5.\r\n‘Naturgeschichte der Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ 1830, s. 50.), who\r\ncarefully observed for a long time the Cebus Azarae in its native land,\r\nfound it liable to catarrh, with the usual symptoms, and which, when\r\noften recurrent, led to consumption. These monkeys suffered also from\r\napoplexy, inflammation of the bowels, and cataract in the eye. The\r\nyounger ones when shedding their milk-teeth often died from fever.\r\nMedicines produced the same effect on them as on us. Many kinds of\r\nmonkeys have a strong taste for tea, coffee, and spiritous liquors:\r\nthey will also, as I have myself seen, smoke tobacco with pleasure. (6.\r\nThe same tastes are common to some animals much lower in the scale. Mr.\r\nA. Nichols informs me that he kept in Queensland, in Australia, three\r\nindividuals of the Phaseolarctus cinereus; and that, without having\r\nbeen taught in any way, they acquired a strong taste for rum, and for\r\nsmoking tobacco.) Brehm asserts that the natives of north-eastern\r\nAfrica catch the wild baboons by exposing vessels with strong beer, by\r\nwhich they are made drunk. He has seen some of these animals, which he\r\nkept in confinement, in this state; and he gives a laughable account of\r\ntheir behaviour and strange grimaces. On the following morning they\r\nwere very cross and dismal; they held their aching heads with both\r\nhands, and wore a most pitiable expression: when beer or wine was\r\noffered them, they turned away with disgust, but relished the juice of\r\nlemons. (7. Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. i. 1864, s. 75, 86. On the Ateles,\r\ns. 105. For other analogous statements, see s. 25, 107.) An American\r\nmonkey, an Ateles, after getting drunk on brandy, would never touch it\r\nagain, and thus was wiser than many men. These trifling facts prove how\r\nsimilar the nerves of taste must be in monkeys and man, and how\r\nsimilarly their whole nervous system is affected.\r\n\r\nMan is infested with internal parasites, sometimes causing fatal\r\neffects; and is plagued by external parasites, all of which belong to\r\nthe same genera or families as those infesting other mammals, and in\r\nthe case of scabies to the same species. (8. Dr. W. Lauder Lindsay,\r\n‘Edinburgh Vet. Review,’ July 1858, page 13.) Man is subject, like\r\nother mammals, birds, and even insects (9. With respect to insects see\r\nDr. Laycock, “On a General Law of Vital Periodicity,” ‘British\r\nAssociation,’ 1842. Dr. Macculloch, ‘Silliman’s North American Journal\r\nof Science,’ vol. XVII. page 305, has seen a dog suffering from tertian\r\nague. Hereafter I shall return to this subject.), to that mysterious\r\nlaw, which causes certain normal processes, such as gestation, as well\r\nas the maturation and duration of various diseases, to follow lunar\r\nperiods. His wounds are repaired by the same process of healing; and\r\nthe stumps left after the amputation of his limbs, especially during an\r\nearly embryonic period, occasionally possess some power of\r\nregeneration, as in the lowest animals. (10. I have given the evidence\r\non this head in my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. page 15, and more could be added.)\r\n\r\nThe whole process of that most important function, the reproduction of\r\nthe species, is strikingly the same in all mammals, from the first act\r\nof courtship by the male (11. Mares e diversis generibus Quadrumanorum\r\nsine dubio dignoscunt feminas humanas a maribus. Primum, credo,\r\nodoratu, postea aspectu. Mr. Youatt, qui diu in Hortis Zoologicis\r\n(Bestiariis) medicus animalium erat, vir in rebus observandis cautus et\r\nsagax, hoc mihi certissime probavit, et curatores ejusdem loci et alii\r\ne ministris confirmaverunt. Sir Andrew Smith et Brehm notabant idem in\r\nCynocephalo. Illustrissimus Cuvier etiam narrat multa de hac re, qua ut\r\nopinor, nihil turpius potest indicari inter omnia hominibus et\r\nQuadrumanis communia. Narrat enim Cynocephalum quendam in furorem\r\nincidere aspectu feminarum aliquarem, sed nequaquam accendi tanto\r\nfurore ab omnibus. Semper eligebat juniores, et dignoscebat in turba,\r\net advocabat voce gestuque.), to the birth and nurturing of the young.\r\nMonkeys are born in almost as helpless a condition as our own infants;\r\nand in certain genera the young differ fully as much in appearance from\r\nthe adults, as do our children from their full-grown parents. (12. This\r\nremark is made with respect to Cynocephalus and the anthropomorphous\r\napes by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and F. Cuvier, ‘Histoire Nat. des\r\nMammifères,’ tom. i. 1824.) It has been urged by some writers, as an\r\nimportant distinction, that with man the young arrive at maturity at a\r\nmuch later age than with any other animal: but if we look to the races\r\nof mankind which inhabit tropical countries the difference is not\r\ngreat, for the orang is believed not to be adult till the age of from\r\nten to fifteen years. (13. Huxley, ‘Man’s Place in Nature,’ 1863, p.\r\n34.) Man differs from woman in size, bodily strength, hairiness, etc.,\r\nas well as in mind, in the same manner as do the two sexes of many\r\nmammals. So that the correspondence in general structure, in the minute\r\nstructure of the tissues, in chemical composition and in constitution,\r\nbetween man and the higher animals, especially the anthropomorphous\r\napes, is extremely close.\r\n\r\nEMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 1.

Tail or os coccyx.]\r\n\r\nMan is developed from an ovule, about the 125th of an inch in diameter,\r\nwhich differs in no respect from the ovules of other animals. The\r\nembryo itself at a very early period can hardly be distinguished from\r\nthat of other members of the vertebrate kingdom. At this period the\r\narteries run in arch-like branches, as if to carry the blood to\r\nbranchiae which are not present in the higher Vertebrata, though the\r\nslits on the sides of the neck still remain (see f, g, fig. 1), marking\r\ntheir former position. At a somewhat later period, when the extremities\r\nare developed, “the feet of lizards and mammals,” as the illustrious\r\nVon Baer remarks, “the wings and feet of birds, no less than the hands\r\nand feet of man, all arise from the same fundamental form.” It is, says\r\nProf. Huxley (14. ‘Man’s Place in Nature,’ 1863, p. 67.), “quite in the\r\nlater stages of development that the young human being presents marked\r\ndifferences from the young ape, while the latter departs as much from\r\nthe dog in its developments, as the man does. Startling as this last\r\nassertion may appear to be, it is demonstrably true.”\r\n\r\nAs some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I\r\nhave given one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early\r\nstage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted\r\naccuracy. (15. The human embryo (upper fig.) is from Ecker, ‘Icones\r\nPhys.,’ 1851-1859, tab. xxx. fig. 2. This embryo was ten lines in\r\nlength, so that the drawing is much magnified. The embryo of the dog is\r\nfrom Bischoff, ‘Entwicklungsgeschichte des Hunde-Eies,’ 1845, tab. xi.\r\nfig. 42B. This drawing is five times magnified, the embryo being\r\ntwenty-five days old. The internal viscera have been omitted, and the\r\nuterine appendages in both drawings removed. I was directed to these\r\nfigures by Prof. Huxley, from whose work, ‘Man’s Place in Nature,’ the\r\nidea of giving them was taken. Haeckel has also given analogous\r\ndrawings in his ‘Schopfungsgeschichte.’)\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing statements made by such high authorities, it would\r\nbe superfluous on my part to give a number of borrowed details, shewing\r\nthat the embryo of man closely resembles that of other mammals. It may,\r\nhowever, be added, that the human embryo likewise resembles certain low\r\nforms when adult in various points of structure. For instance, the\r\nheart at first exists as a simple pulsating vessel; the excreta are\r\nvoided through a cloacal passage; and the os coccyx projects like a\r\ntrue tail, “extending considerably beyond the rudimentary legs.” (16.\r\nProf. Wyman in ‘Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences,’ vol.\r\niv. 1860, p. 17.) In the embryos of all air-breathing vertebrates,\r\ncertain glands, called the corpora Wolffiana, correspond with, and act\r\nlike the kidneys of mature fishes. (17. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’\r\nvol. i. p. 533.) Even at a later embryonic period, some striking\r\nresemblances between man and the lower animals may be observed.\r\nBischoff says that “the convolutions of the brain in a human foetus at\r\nthe end of the seventh month reach about the same stage of development\r\nas in a baboon when adult.” (18. ‘Die Grosshirnwindungen des Menschen,’\r\n1868, s. 95.) The great toe, as Professor Owen remarks (19. ‘Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. ii. p. 553.), “which forms the fulcrum when standing\r\nor walking, is perhaps the most characteristic peculiarity in the human\r\nstructure;” but in an embryo, about an inch in length, Prof. Wyman (20.\r\n‘Proc. Soc. Nat. Hist.’ Boston, 1863, vol. ix. p. 185.) found “that the\r\ngreat toe was shorter than the others; and, instead of being parallel\r\nto them, projected at an angle from the side of the foot, thus\r\ncorresponding with the permanent condition of this part in the\r\nquadrumana.” I will conclude with a quotation from Huxley (21. ‘Man’s\r\nPlace in Nature,’ p. 65.) who after asking, does man originate in a\r\ndifferent way from a dog, bird, frog or fish? says, “the reply is not\r\ndoubtful for a moment; without question, the mode of origin, and the\r\nearly stages of the development of man, are identical with those of the\r\nanimals immediately below him in the scale: without a doubt in these\r\nrespects, he is far nearer to apes than the apes are to the dog.”\r\n\r\nRUDIMENTS.\r\n\r\nThis subject, though not intrinsically more important than the two\r\nlast, will for several reasons be treated here more fully. (22. I had\r\nwritten a rough copy of this chapter before reading a valuable paper,\r\n“Caratteri rudimentali in ordine all’ origine dell’ uomo” (‘Annuario\r\ndella Soc. d. Naturalisti,’ Modena, 1867, p. 81), by G. Canestrini, to\r\nwhich paper I am considerably indebted. Haeckel has given admirable\r\ndiscussions on this whole subject, under the title of Dysteleology, in\r\nhis ‘Generelle Morphologie’ and ‘Schöpfungsgeschichte.’) Not one of the\r\nhigher animals can be named which does not bear some part in a\r\nrudimentary condition; and man forms no exception to the rule.\r\nRudimentary organs must be distinguished from those that are nascent;\r\nthough in some cases the distinction is not easy. The former are either\r\nabsolutely useless, such as the mammae of male quadrupeds, or the\r\nincisor teeth of ruminants which never cut through the gums; or they\r\nare of such slight service to their present possessors, that we can\r\nhardly suppose that they were developed under the conditions which now\r\nexist. Organs in this latter state are not strictly rudimentary, but\r\nthey are tending in this direction. Nascent organs, on the other hand,\r\nthough not fully developed, are of high service to their possessors,\r\nand are capable of further development. Rudimentary organs are\r\neminently variable; and this is partly intelligible, as they are\r\nuseless, or nearly useless, and consequently are no longer subjected to\r\nnatural selection. They often become wholly suppressed. When this\r\noccurs, they are nevertheless liable to occasional reappearance through\r\nreversion—a circumstance well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nThe chief agents in causing organs to become rudimentary seem to have\r\nbeen disuse at that period of life when the organ is chiefly used (and\r\nthis is generally during maturity), and also inheritance at a\r\ncorresponding period of life. The term “disuse” does not relate merely\r\nto the lessened action of muscles, but includes a diminished flow of\r\nblood to a part or organ, from being subjected to fewer alternations of\r\npressure, or from becoming in any way less habitually active.\r\nRudiments, however, may occur in one sex of those parts which are\r\nnormally present in the other sex; and such rudiments, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, have often originated in a way distinct from those here\r\nreferred to. In some cases, organs have been reduced by means of\r\nnatural selection, from having become injurious to the species under\r\nchanged habits of life. The process of reduction is probably often\r\naided through the two principles of compensation and economy of growth;\r\nbut the later stages of reduction, after disuse has done all that can\r\nfairly be attributed to it, and when the saving to be effected by the\r\neconomy of growth would be very small (23. Some good criticisms on this\r\nsubject have been given by Messrs. Murie and Mivart, in ‘Transact.\r\nZoological Society,’ 1869, vol. vii. p. 92.), are difficult to\r\nunderstand. The final and complete suppression of a part, already\r\nuseless and much reduced in size, in which case neither compensation\r\nnor economy can come into play, is perhaps intelligible by the aid of\r\nthe hypothesis of pangenesis. But as the whole subject of rudimentary\r\norgans has been discussed and illustrated in my former works (24.\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii pp. 317\r\nand 397. See also ‘Origin of Species,’ 5th Edition p. 535.), I need\r\nhere say no more on this head.\r\n\r\nRudiments of various muscles have been observed in many parts of the\r\nhuman body (25. For instance, M. Richard (‘Annales des Sciences Nat.,’\r\n3rd series, Zoolog. 1852, tom. xviii. p. 13) describes and figures\r\nrudiments of what he calls the “muscle pedieux de la main,” which he\r\nsays is sometimes “infiniment petit.” Another muscle, called “le tibial\r\nposterieur,” is generally quite absent in the hand, but appears from\r\ntime to time in a more or less rudimentary condition.); and not a few\r\nmuscles, which are regularly present in some of the lower animals can\r\noccasionally be detected in man in a greatly reduced condition. Every\r\none must have noticed the power which many animals, especially horses,\r\npossess of moving or twitching their skin; and this is effected by the\r\npanniculus carnosus. Remnants of this muscle in an efficient state are\r\nfound in various parts of our bodies; for instance, the muscle on the\r\nforehead, by which the eyebrows are raised. The platysma myoides, which\r\nis well developed on the neck, belongs to this system. Prof. Turner, of\r\nEdinburgh, has occasionally detected, as he informs me, muscular\r\nfasciculi in five different situations, namely in the axillae, near the\r\nscapulae, etc., all of which must be referred to the system of the\r\npanniculus. He has also shewn (26. Prof. W. Turner, ‘Proceedings of the\r\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh,’ 1866-67, p. 65.) that the musculus\r\nsternalis or sternalis brutorum, which is not an extension of the\r\nrectus abdominalis, but is closely allied to the panniculus, occurred\r\nin the proportion of about three per cent. in upwards of 600 bodies: he\r\nadds, that this muscle affords “an excellent illustration of the\r\nstatement that occasional and rudimentary structures are especially\r\nliable to variation in arrangement.”\r\n\r\nSome few persons have the power of contracting the superficial muscles\r\non their scalps; and these muscles are in a variable and partially\r\nrudimentary condition. M. A. de Candolle has communicated to me a\r\ncurious instance of the long-continued persistence or inheritance of\r\nthis power, as well as of its unusual development. He knows a family,\r\nin which one member, the present head of the family, could, when a\r\nyouth, pitch several heavy books from his head by the movement of the\r\nscalp alone; and he won wagers by performing this feat. His father,\r\nuncle, grandfather, and his three children possess the same power to\r\nthe same unusual degree. This family became divided eight generations\r\nago into two branches; so that the head of the above-mentioned branch\r\nis cousin in the seventh degree to the head of the other branch. This\r\ndistant cousin resides in another part of France; and on being asked\r\nwhether he possessed the same faculty, immediately exhibited his power.\r\nThis case offers a good illustration how persistent may be the\r\ntransmission of an absolutely useless faculty, probably derived from\r\nour remote semi-human progenitors; since many monkeys have, and\r\nfrequently use the power, of largely moving their scalps up and down.\r\n(27. See my ‘Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,’ 1872, p.\r\n144.)\r\n\r\nThe extrinsic muscles which serve to move the external ear, and the\r\nintrinsic muscles which move the different parts, are in a rudimentary\r\ncondition in man, and they all belong to the system of the panniculus;\r\nthey are also variable in development, or at least in function. I have\r\nseen one man who could draw the whole ear forwards; other men can draw\r\nit upwards; another who could draw it backwards (28. Canestrini quotes\r\nHyrtl. (‘Annuario della Soc. dei Naturalisti,’ Modena, 1867, p. 97) to\r\nthe same effect.); and from what one of these persons told me, it is\r\nprobable that most of us, by often touching our ears, and thus\r\ndirecting our attention towards them, could recover some power of\r\nmovement by repeated trials. The power of erecting and directing the\r\nshell of the ears to the various points of the compass, is no doubt of\r\nthe highest service to many animals, as they thus perceive the\r\ndirection of danger; but I have never heard, on sufficient evidence, of\r\na man who possessed this power, the one which might be of use to him.\r\nThe whole external shell may be considered a rudiment, together with\r\nthe various folds and prominences (helix and anti-helix, tragus and\r\nanti-tragus, etc.) which in the lower animals strengthen and support\r\nthe ear when erect, without adding much to its weight. Some authors,\r\nhowever, suppose that the cartilage of the shell serves to transmit\r\nvibrations to the acoustic nerve; but Mr. Toynbee (29. ‘The Diseases of\r\nthe Ear,’ by J. Toynbee, F.R.S., 1860, p. 12. A distinguished\r\nphysiologist, Prof. Preyer, informs me that he had lately been\r\nexperimenting on the function of the shell of the ear, and has come to\r\nnearly the same conclusion as that given here.), after collecting all\r\nthe known evidence on this head, concludes that the external shell is\r\nof no distinct use. The ears of the chimpanzee and orang are curiously\r\nlike those of man, and the proper muscles are likewise but very\r\nslightly developed. (30. Prof. A. Macalister, ‘Annals and Magazine of\r\nNatural History,’ vol. vii. 1871, p. 342.) I am also assured by the\r\nkeepers in the Zoological Gardens that these animals never move or\r\nerect their ears; so that they are in an equally rudimentary condition\r\nwith those of man, as far as function is concerned. Why these animals,\r\nas well as the progenitors of man, should have lost the power of\r\nerecting their ears, we cannot say. It may be, though I am not\r\nsatisfied with this view, that owing to their arboreal habits and great\r\nstrength they were but little exposed to danger, and so during a\r\nlengthened period moved their ears but little, and thus gradually lost\r\nthe power of moving them. This would be a parallel case with that of\r\nthose large and heavy birds, which, from inhabiting oceanic islands,\r\nhave not been exposed to the attacks of beasts of prey, and have\r\nconsequently lost the power of using their wings for flight. The\r\ninability to move the ears in man and several apes is, however, partly\r\ncompensated by the freedom with which they can move the head in a\r\nhorizontal plane, so as to catch sounds from all directions. It has\r\nbeen asserted that the ear of man alone possesses a lobule; but “a\r\nrudiment of it is found in the gorilla” (31. Mr. St. George Mivart,\r\n‘Elementary Anatomy,’ 1873, p. 396.); and, as I hear from Prof. Preyer,\r\nit is not rarely absent in the negro.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 2. Human Ear, modelled and drawn by Mr. Woolner. The projecting\r\npoint is labelled a.]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated sculptor, Mr. Woolner, informs me of one little\r\npeculiarity in the external ear, which he has often observed both in\r\nmen and women, and of which he perceived the full significance. His\r\nattention was first called to the subject whilst at work on his figure\r\nof Puck, to which he had given pointed ears. He was thus led to examine\r\nthe ears of various monkeys, and subsequently more carefully those of\r\nman. The peculiarity consists in a little blunt point, projecting from\r\nthe inwardly folded margin, or helix. When present, it is developed at\r\nbirth, and, according to Prof. Ludwig Meyer, more frequently in man\r\nthan in woman. Mr. Woolner made an exact model of one such case, and\r\nsent me the accompanying drawing. (Fig. 2). These points not only\r\nproject inwards towards the centre of the ear, but often a little\r\noutwards from its plane, so as to be visible when the head is viewed\r\nfrom directly in front or behind. They are variable in size, and\r\nsomewhat in position, standing either a little higher or lower; and\r\nthey sometimes occur on one ear and not on the other. They are not\r\nconfined to mankind, for I observed a case in one of the spider-monkeys\r\n(Ateles beelzebuth) in our Zoological Gardens; and Mr. E. Ray Lankester\r\ninforms me of another case in a chimpanzee in the gardens at Hamburg.\r\nThe helix obviously consists of the extreme margin of the ear folded\r\ninwards; and this folding appears to be in some manner connected with\r\nthe whole external ear being permanently pressed backwards. In many\r\nmonkeys, which do not stand high in the order, as baboons and some\r\nspecies of macacus (32. See also some remarks, and the drawings of the\r\nears of the Lemuroidea, in Messrs. Murie and Mivart’s excellent paper\r\nin ‘Transactions of the Zoological Society,’ vol. vii. 1869, pp. 6 and\r\n90.), the upper portion of the ear is slightly pointed, and the margin\r\nis not at all folded inwards; but if the margin were to be thus folded,\r\na slight point would necessarily project inwards towards the centre,\r\nand probably a little outwards from the plane of the ear; and this I\r\nbelieve to be their origin in many cases. On the other hand, Prof. L.\r\nMeyer, in an able paper recently published (33. ‘Über das Darwin’sche\r\nSpitzohr,’ Archiv fur Path. Anat. und Phys., 1871, p. 485.), maintains\r\nthat the whole case is one of mere variability; and that the\r\nprojections are not real ones, but are due to the internal cartilage on\r\neach side of the points not having been fully developed. I am quite\r\nready to admit that this is the correct explanation in many instances,\r\nas in those figured by Prof. Meyer, in which there are several minute\r\npoints, or the whole margin is sinuous. I have myself seen, through the\r\nkindness of Dr. L. Down, the ear of a microcephalous idiot, on which\r\nthere is a projection on the outside of the helix, and not on the\r\ninward folded edge, so that this point can have no relation to a former\r\napex of the ear. Nevertheless in some cases, my original view, that the\r\npoints are vestiges of the tips of formerly erect and pointed ears,\r\nstill seems to me probable. I think so from the frequency of their\r\noccurrence, and from the general correspondence in position with that\r\nof the tip of a pointed ear. In one case, of which a photograph has\r\nbeen sent me, the projection is so large, that supposing, in accordance\r\nwith Prof. Meyer’s view, the ear to be made perfect by the equal\r\ndevelopment of the cartilage throughout the whole extent of the margin,\r\nit would have covered fully one-third of the whole ear. Two cases have\r\nbeen communicated to me, one in North America, and the other in\r\nEngland, in which the upper margin is not at all folded inwards, but is\r\npointed, so that it closely resembles the pointed ear of an ordinary\r\nquadruped in outline. In one of these cases, which was that of a young\r\nchild, the father compared the ear with the drawing which I have given\r\n(34. ‘The Expression of the Emotions,’ p. 136.) of the ear of a monkey,\r\nthe Cynopithecus niger, and says that their outlines are closely\r\nsimilar. If, in these two cases, the margin had been folded inwards in\r\nthe normal manner, an inward projection must have been formed. I may\r\nadd that in two other cases the outline still remains somewhat pointed,\r\nalthough the margin of the upper part of the ear is normally folded\r\ninwards—in one of them, however, very narrowly. [Fig.3. Foetus of an\r\nOrang(?). Exact copy of a photograph, shewing the form of the ear at\r\nthis early age.] The following woodcut (No. 3) is an accurate copy of a\r\nphotograph of the foetus of an orang (kindly sent me by Dr. Nitsche),\r\nin which it may be seen how different the pointed outline of the ear is\r\nat this period from its adult condition, when it bears a close general\r\nresemblance to that of man. It is evident that the folding over of the\r\ntip of such an ear, unless it changed greatly during its further\r\ndevelopment, would give rise to a point projecting inwards. On the\r\nwhole, it still seems to me probable that the points in question are in\r\nsome cases, both in man and apes, vestiges of a former condition.\r\n\r\nThe nictitating membrane, or third eyelid, with its accessory muscles\r\nand other structures, is especially well developed in birds, and is of\r\nmuch functional importance to them, as it can be rapidly drawn across\r\nthe whole eye-ball. It is found in some reptiles and amphibians, and in\r\ncertain fishes, as in sharks. It is fairly well developed in the two\r\nlower divisions of the mammalian series, namely, in the monotremata and\r\nmarsupials, and in some few of the higher mammals, as in the walrus.\r\nBut in man, the quadrumana, and most other mammals, it exists, as is\r\nadmitted by all anatomists, as a mere rudiment, called the semilunar\r\nfold. (35. Muller’s ‘Elements of Physiology,’ Eng. translat. 1842, vol.\r\nii. p. 1117. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 260; ibid. on\r\nthe Walrus, ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ November 8, 1854.\r\nSee also R. Knox, ‘Great Artists and Anatomists,’ p. 106. This rudiment\r\napparently is somewhat larger in Negroes and Australians than in\r\nEuropeans, see Carl Vogt, ‘Lectures on Man,’ Eng. translat. p. 129.)\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell is of the highest importance to the greater number\r\nof mammals—to some, as the ruminants, in warning them of danger; to\r\nothers, as the Carnivora, in finding their prey; to others, again, as\r\nthe wild boar, for both purposes combined. But the sense of smell is of\r\nextremely slight service, if any, even to the dark coloured races of\r\nmen, in whom it is much more highly developed than in the white and\r\ncivilised races. (36. The account given by Humboldt of the power of\r\nsmell possessed by the natives of South America is well known, and has\r\nbeen confirmed by others. M. Houzeau (‘Études sur les Facultés\r\nMentales,’ etc., tom. i. 1872, p. 91) asserts that he repeatedly made\r\nexperiments, and proved that Negroes and Indians could recognise\r\npersons in the dark by their odour. Dr. W. Ogle has made some curious\r\nobservations on the connection between the power of smell and the\r\ncolouring matter of the mucous membrane of the olfactory region as well\r\nas of the skin of the body. I have, therefore, spoken in the text of\r\nthe dark-coloured races having a finer sense of smell than the white\r\nraces. See his paper, ‘Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,’ London, vol.\r\nliii. 1870, p. 276.) Nevertheless it does not warn them of danger, nor\r\nguide them to their food; nor does it prevent the Esquimaux from\r\nsleeping in the most fetid atmosphere, nor many savages from eating\r\nhalf-putrid meat. In Europeans the power differs greatly in different\r\nindividuals, as I am assured by an eminent naturalist who possesses\r\nthis sense highly developed, and who has attended to the subject. Those\r\nwho believe in the principle of gradual evolution, will not readily\r\nadmit that the sense of smell in its present state was originally\r\nacquired by man, as he now exists. He inherits the power in an\r\nenfeebled and so far rudimentary condition, from some early progenitor,\r\nto whom it was highly serviceable, and by whom it was continually used.\r\nIn those animals which have this sense highly developed, such as dogs\r\nand horses, the recollection of persons and of places is strongly\r\nassociated with their odour; and we can thus perhaps understand how it\r\nis, as Dr. Maudsley has truly remarked (37. ‘The Physiology and\r\nPathology of Mind,’ 2nd ed. 1868, p. 134.), that the sense of smell in\r\nman “is singularly effective in recalling vividly the ideas and images\r\nof forgotten scenes and places.”\r\n\r\nMan differs conspicuously from all the other primates in being almost\r\nnaked. But a few short straggling hairs are found over the greater part\r\nof the body in the man, and fine down on that of the woman. The\r\ndifferent races differ much in hairiness; and in the individuals of the\r\nsame race the hairs are highly variable, not only in abundance, but\r\nlikewise in position: thus in some Europeans the shoulders are quite\r\nnaked, whilst in others they bear thick tufts of hair. (38. Eschricht,\r\nÜber die Richtung der Haare am menschlichen Körper, Muller’s ‘Archiv\r\nfur Anat. und Phys.’ 1837, s. 47. I shall often have to refer to this\r\nvery curious paper.) There can be little doubt that the hairs thus\r\nscattered over the body are the rudiments of the uniform hairy coat of\r\nthe lower animals. This view is rendered all the more probable, as it\r\nis known that fine, short, and pale-coloured hairs on the limbs and\r\nother parts of the body, occasionally become developed into “thickset,\r\nlong, and rather coarse dark hairs,” when abnormally nourished near\r\nold-standing inflamed surfaces. (39. Paget, ‘Lectures on Surgical\r\nPathology,’ 1853, vol. i. p. 71.)\r\n\r\nI am informed by Sir James Paget that often several members of a family\r\nhave a few hairs in their eyebrows much longer than the others; so that\r\neven this slight peculiarity seems to be inherited. These hairs, too,\r\nseem to have their representatives; for in the chimpanzee, and in\r\ncertain species of Macacus, there are scattered hairs of considerable\r\nlength rising from the naked skin above the eyes, and corresponding to\r\nour eyebrows; similar long hairs project from the hairy covering of the\r\nsuperciliary ridges in some baboons.\r\n\r\nThe fine wool-like hair, or so-called lanugo, with which the human\r\nfoetus during the sixth month is thickly covered, offers a more curious\r\ncase. It is first developed, during the fifth month, on the eyebrows\r\nand face, and especially round the mouth, where it is much longer than\r\nthat on the head. A moustache of this kind was observed by Eschricht\r\n(40. Eschricht, ibid. s. 40, 47.) on a female foetus; but this is not\r\nso surprising a circumstance as it may at first appear, for the two\r\nsexes generally resemble each other in all external characters during\r\nan early period of growth. The direction and arrangement of the hairs\r\non all parts of the foetal body are the same as in the adult, but are\r\nsubject to much variability. The whole surface, including even the\r\nforehead and ears, is thus thickly clothed; but it is a significant\r\nfact that the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are quite\r\nnaked, like the inferior surfaces of all four extremities in most of\r\nthe lower animals. As this can hardly be an accidental coincidence, the\r\nwoolly covering of the foetus probably represents the first permanent\r\ncoat of hair in those mammals which are born hairy. Three or four cases\r\nhave been recorded of persons born with their whole bodies and faces\r\nthickly covered with fine long hairs; and this strange condition is\r\nstrongly inherited, and is correlated with an abnormal condition of the\r\nteeth. (41. See my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. p. 327. Prof. Alex. Brandt has recently sent\r\nme an additional case of a father and son, born in Russia, with these\r\npeculiarities. I have received drawings of both from Paris.) Prof.\r\nAlex. Brandt informs me that he has compared the hair from the face of\r\na man thus characterised, aged thirty-five, with the lanugo of a\r\nfoetus, and finds it quite similar in texture; therefore, as he\r\nremarks, the case may be attributed to an arrest of development in the\r\nhair, together with its continued growth. Many delicate children, as I\r\nhave been assured by a surgeon to a hospital for children, have their\r\nbacks covered by rather long silky hairs; and such cases probably come\r\nunder the same head.\r\n\r\nIt appears as if the posterior molar or wisdom-teeth were tending to\r\nbecome rudimentary in the more civilised races of man. These teeth are\r\nrather smaller than the other molars, as is likewise the case with the\r\ncorresponding teeth in the chimpanzee and orang; and they have only two\r\nseparate fangs. They do not cut through the gums till about the\r\nseventeenth year, and I have been assured that they are much more\r\nliable to decay, and are earlier lost than the other teeth; but this is\r\ndenied by some eminent dentists. They are also much more liable to\r\nvary, both in structure and in the period of their development, than\r\nthe other teeth. (42. Dr. Webb, ‘Teeth in Man and the Anthropoid Apes,’\r\nas quoted by Dr. C. Carter Blake in Anthropological Review, July 1867,\r\np. 299.) In the Melanian races, on the other hand, the wisdom-teeth are\r\nusually furnished with three separate fangs, and are generally sound;\r\nthey also differ from the other molars in size, less than in the\r\nCaucasian races. (43. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. pp.\r\n320, 321, and 325.) Prof. Schaaffhausen accounts for this difference\r\nbetween the races by “the posterior dental portion of the jaw being\r\nalways shortened” in those that are civilised (44. ‘On the Primitive\r\nForm of the Skull,’ Eng. translat., in ‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct.\r\n1868, p. 426), and this shortening may, I presume, be attributed to\r\ncivilised men habitually feeding on soft, cooked food, and thus using\r\ntheir jaws less. I am informed by Mr. Brace that it is becoming quite a\r\ncommon practice in the United States to remove some of the molar teeth\r\nof children, as the jaw does not grow large enough for the perfect\r\ndevelopment of the normal number. (45. Prof. Montegazza writes to me\r\nfrom Florence, that he has lately been studying the last molar teeth in\r\nthe different races of man, and has come to the same conclusion as that\r\ngiven in my text, viz., that in the higher or civilised races they are\r\non the road towards atrophy or elimination.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the alimentary canal, I have met with an account of\r\nonly a single rudiment, namely the vermiform appendage of the caecum.\r\nThe caecum is a branch or diverticulum of the intestine, ending in a\r\ncul-de-sac, and is extremely long in many of the lower\r\nvegetable-feeding mammals. In the marsupial koala it is actually more\r\nthan thrice as long as the whole body. (46. Owen, ‘Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. iii. pp. 416, 434, 441.) It is sometimes produced\r\ninto a long gradually-tapering point, and is sometimes constricted in\r\nparts. It appears as if, in consequence of changed diet or habits, the\r\ncaecum had become much shortened in various animals, the vermiform\r\nappendage being left as a rudiment of the shortened part. That this\r\nappendage is a rudiment, we may infer from its small size, and from the\r\nevidence which Prof. Canestrini (47. ‘Annuario della Soc. d. Nat.’\r\nModena, 1867, p. 94.) has collected of its variability in man. It is\r\noccasionally quite absent, or again is largely developed. The passage\r\nis sometimes completely closed for half or two-thirds of its length,\r\nwith the terminal part consisting of a flattened solid expansion. In\r\nthe orang this appendage is long and convoluted: in man it arises from\r\nthe end of the short caecum, and is commonly from four to five inches\r\nin length, being only about the third of an inch in diameter. Not only\r\nis it useless, but it is sometimes the cause of death, of which fact I\r\nhave lately heard two instances: this is due to small hard bodies, such\r\nas seeds, entering the passage, and causing inflammation. (48. M. C.\r\nMartins (“De l’Unité Organique,” in ‘Revue des Deux Mondes,’ June 15,\r\n1862, p. 16) and Haeckel (‘Generelle Morphologie,’ B. ii. s. 278), have\r\nboth remarked on the singular fact of this rudiment sometimes causing\r\ndeath.)\r\n\r\nIn some of the lower Quadrumana, in the Lemuridae and Carnivora, as\r\nwell as in many marsupials, there is a passage near the lower end of\r\nthe humerus, called the supra-condyloid foramen, through which the\r\ngreat nerve of the fore limb and often the great artery pass. Now in\r\nthe humerus of man, there is generally a trace of this passage, which\r\nis sometimes fairly well developed, being formed by a depending\r\nhook-like process of bone, completed by a band of ligament. Dr.\r\nStruthers (49. With respect to inheritance, see Dr. Struthers in the\r\n‘Lancet,’ Feb. 15, 1873, and another important paper, ibid. Jan. 24,\r\n1863, p. 83. Dr. Knox, as I am informed, was the first anatomist who\r\ndrew attention to this peculiar structure in man; see his ‘Great\r\nArtists and Anatomists,’ p. 63. See also an important memoir on this\r\nprocess by Dr. Gruber, in the ‘Bulletin de l’Acad. Imp. de St.\r\nPetersbourg,’ tom. xii. 1867, p. 448.), who has closely attended to the\r\nsubject, has now shewn that this peculiarity is sometimes inherited, as\r\nit has occurred in a father, and in no less than four out of his seven\r\nchildren. When present, the great nerve invariably passes through it;\r\nand this clearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment of the\r\nsupra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. Prof. Turner estimates,\r\nas he informs me, that it occurs in about one per cent. of recent\r\nskeletons. But if the occasional development of this structure in man\r\nis, as seems probable, due to reversion, it is a return to a very\r\nancient state of things, because in the higher Quadrumana it is absent.\r\n\r\nThere is another foramen or perforation in the humerus, occasionally\r\npresent in man, which may be called the inter-condyloid. This occurs,\r\nbut not constantly, in various anthropoid and other apes (50. Mr. St.\r\nGeorge Mivart, ‘Transactions Phil. Soc.’ 1867, p. 310.), and likewise\r\nin many of the lower animals. It is remarkable that this perforation\r\nseems to have been present in man much more frequently during ancient\r\ntimes than recently. Mr. Busk (51. “On the Caves of Gibraltar,”\r\n‘Transactions of the International Congress of Prehistoric\r\nArchaeology,’ Third Session, 1869, p. 159. Prof. Wyman has lately shewn\r\n(Fourth Annual Report, Peabody Museum, 1871, p. 20), that this\r\nperforation is present in thirty-one per cent. of some human remains\r\nfrom ancient mounds in the Western United States, and in Florida. It\r\nfrequently occurs in the negro.) has collected the following evidence\r\non this head: Prof. Broca “noticed the perforation in four and a half\r\nper cent. of the arm-bones collected in the ‘Cimetière du Sud,’ at\r\nParis; and in the Grotto of Orrony, the contents of which are referred\r\nto the Bronze period, as many as eight humeri out of thirty-two were\r\nperforated; but this extraordinary proportion, he thinks, might be due\r\nto the cavern having been a sort of ‘family vault.’ Again, M. Dupont\r\nfound thirty per cent. of perforated bones in the caves of the Valley\r\nof the Lesse, belonging to the Reindeer period; whilst M. Leguay, in a\r\nsort of dolmen at Argenteuil, observed twenty-five per cent. to be\r\nperforated; and M. Pruner-Bey found twenty-six per cent. in the same\r\ncondition in bones from Vaureal. Nor should it be left unnoticed that\r\nM. Pruner-Bey states that this condition is common in Guanche\r\nskeletons.” It is an interesting fact that ancient races, in this and\r\nseveral other cases, more frequently present structures which resemble\r\nthose of the lower animals than do the modern. One chief cause seems to\r\nbe that the ancient races stand somewhat nearer in the long line of\r\ndescent to their remote animal-like progenitors.\r\n\r\nIn man, the os coccyx, together with certain other vertebrae hereafter\r\nto be described, though functionless as a tail, plainly represent this\r\npart in other vertebrate animals. At an early embryonic period it is\r\nfree, and projects beyond the lower extremities; as may be seen in the\r\ndrawing (Fig. 1.) of a human embryo. Even after birth it has been\r\nknown, in certain rare and anomalous cases (52. Quatrefages has lately\r\ncollected the evidence on this subject. ‘Revue des Cours\r\nScientifiques,’ 1867-1868, p. 625. In 1840 Fleischmann exhibited a\r\nhuman foetus bearing a free tail, which, as is not always the case,\r\nincluded vertebral bodies; and this tail was critically examined by the\r\nmany anatomists present at the meeting of naturalists at Erlangen (see\r\nMarshall in Niederlandischen Archiv für Zoologie, December 1871).), to\r\nform a small external rudiment of a tail. The os coccyx is short,\r\nusually including only four vertebrae, all anchylosed together: and\r\nthese are in a rudimentary condition, for they consist, with the\r\nexception of the basal one, of the centrum alone. (53. Owen, ‘On the\r\nNature of Limbs,’ 1849, p. 114.) They are furnished with some small\r\nmuscles; one of which, as I am informed by Prof. Turner, has been\r\nexpressly described by Theile as a rudimentary repetition of the\r\nextensor of the tail, a muscle which is so largely developed in many\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord in man extends only as far downwards as the last dorsal\r\nor first lumbar vertebra; but a thread-like structure (the filum\r\nterminale) runs down the axis of the sacral part of the spinal canal,\r\nand even along the back of the coccygeal bones. The upper part of this\r\nfilament, as Prof. Turner informs me, is undoubtedly homologous with\r\nthe spinal cord; but the lower part apparently consists merely of the\r\npia mater, or vascular investing membrane. Even in this case the os\r\ncoccyx may be said to possess a vestige of so important a structure as\r\nthe spinal cord, though no longer enclosed within a bony canal. The\r\nfollowing fact, for which I am also indebted to Prof. Turner, shews how\r\nclosely the os coccyx corresponds with the true tail in the lower\r\nanimals: Luschka has recently discovered at the extremity of the\r\ncoccygeal bones a very peculiar convoluted body, which is continuous\r\nwith the middle sacral artery; and this discovery led Krause and Meyer\r\nto examine the tail of a monkey (Macacus), and of a cat, in both of\r\nwhich they found a similarly convoluted body, though not at the\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive system offers various rudimentary structures; but\r\nthese differ in one important respect from the foregoing cases. Here we\r\nare not concerned with the vestige of a part which does not belong to\r\nthe species in an efficient state, but with a part efficient in the one\r\nsex, and represented in the other by a mere rudiment. Nevertheless, the\r\noccurrence of such rudiments is as difficult to explain, on the belief\r\nof the separate creation of each species, as in the foregoing cases.\r\nHereafter I shall have to recur to these rudiments, and shall shew that\r\ntheir presence generally depends merely on inheritance, that is, on\r\nparts acquired by one sex having been partially transmitted to the\r\nother. I will in this place only give some instances of such rudiments.\r\nIt is well known that in the males of all mammals, including man,\r\nrudimentary mammae exist. These in several instances have become well\r\ndeveloped, and have yielded a copious supply of milk. Their essential\r\nidentity in the two sexes is likewise shewn by their occasional\r\nsympathetic enlargement in both during an attack of the measles. The\r\nvesicula prostatica, which has been observed in many male mammals, is\r\nnow universally acknowledged to be the homologue of the female uterus,\r\ntogether with the connected passage. It is impossible to read\r\nLeuckart’s able description of this organ, and his reasoning, without\r\nadmitting the justness of his conclusion. This is especially clear in\r\nthe case of those mammals in which the true female uterus bifurcates,\r\nfor in the males of these the vesicula likewise bifurcates. (54.\r\nLeuckart, in Todd’s ‘Cyclopaedia of Anatomy’ 1849-52, vol. iv. p. 1415.\r\nIn man this organ is only from three to six lines in length, but, like\r\nso many other rudimentary parts, it is variable in development as well\r\nas in other characters.) Some other rudimentary structures belonging to\r\nthe reproductive system might have been here adduced. (55. See, on this\r\nsubject, Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. pp. 675, 676, 706.)\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the three great classes of facts now given is\r\nunmistakeable. But it would be superfluous fully to recapitulate the\r\nline of argument given in detail in my ‘Origin of Species.’ The\r\nhomological construction of the whole frame in the members of the same\r\nclass is intelligible, if we admit their descent from a common\r\nprogenitor, together with their subsequent adaptation to diversified\r\nconditions. On any other view, the similarity of pattern between the\r\nhand of a man or monkey, the foot of a horse, the flipper of a seal,\r\nthe wing of a bat, etc., is utterly inexplicable. (56. Prof. Bianconi,\r\nin a recently published work, illustrated by admirable engravings (‘La\r\nThéorie Darwinienne et la création dite indépendante,’ 1874),\r\nendeavours to shew that homological structures, in the above and other\r\ncases, can be fully explained on mechanical principles, in accordance\r\nwith their uses. No one has shewn so well, how admirably such\r\nstructures are adapted for their final purpose; and this adaptation\r\ncan, as I believe, be explained through natural selection. In\r\nconsidering the wing of a bat, he brings forward (p. 218) what appears\r\nto me (to use Auguste Comte’s words) a mere metaphysical principle,\r\nnamely, the preservation “in its integrity of the mammalian nature of\r\nthe animal.” In only a few cases does he discuss rudiments, and then\r\nonly those parts which are partially rudimentary, such as the little\r\nhoofs of the pig and ox, which do not touch the ground; these he shews\r\nclearly to be of service to the animal. It is unfortunate that he did\r\nnot consider such cases as the minute teeth, which never cut through\r\nthe jaw in the ox, or the mammae of male quadrupeds, or the wings of\r\ncertain beetles, existing under the soldered wing-covers, or the\r\nvestiges of the pistil and stamens in various flowers, and many other\r\nsuch cases. Although I greatly admire Prof. Bianconi’s work, yet the\r\nbelief now held by most naturalists seems to me left unshaken, that\r\nhomological structures are inexplicable on the principle of mere\r\nadaptation.) It is no scientific explanation to assert that they have\r\nall been formed on the same ideal plan. With respect to development, we\r\ncan clearly understand, on the principle of variations supervening at a\r\nrather late embryonic period, and being inherited at a corresponding\r\nperiod, how it is that the embryos of wonderfully different forms\r\nshould still retain, more or less perfectly, the structure of their\r\ncommon progenitor. No other explanation has ever been given of the\r\nmarvellous fact that the embryos of a man, dog, seal, bat, reptile,\r\netc., can at first hardly be distinguished from each other. In order to\r\nunderstand the existence of rudimentary organs, we have only to suppose\r\nthat a former progenitor possessed the parts in question in a perfect\r\nstate, and that under changed habits of life they became greatly\r\nreduced, either from simple disuse, or through the natural selection of\r\nthose individuals which were least encumbered with a superfluous part,\r\naided by the other means previously indicated.\r\n\r\nThus we can understand how it has come to pass that man and all other\r\nvertebrate animals have been constructed on the same general model, why\r\nthey pass through the same early stages of development, and why they\r\nretain certain rudiments in common. Consequently we ought frankly to\r\nadmit their community of descent: to take any other view, is to admit\r\nthat our own structure, and that of all the animals around us, is a\r\nmere snare laid to entrap our judgment. This conclusion is greatly\r\nstrengthened, if we look to the members of the whole animal series, and\r\nconsider the evidence derived from their affinities or classification,\r\ntheir geographical distribution and geological succession. It is only\r\nour natural prejudice, and that arrogance which made our forefathers\r\ndeclare that they were descended from demi-gods, which leads us to\r\ndemur to this conclusion. But the time will before long come, when it\r\nwill be thought wonderful that naturalists, who were well acquainted\r\nwith the comparative structure and development of man, and other\r\nmammals, should have believed that each was the work of a separate act\r\nof creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nON THE MANNER OF DEVELOPMENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariability of body and mind in man—Inheritance—Causes of\r\nvariability—Laws of variation the same in man as in the lower\r\nanimals—Direct action of the conditions of life—Effects of the\r\nincreased use and disuse of parts—Arrested\r\ndevelopment—Reversion—Correlated variation—Rate of increase—Checks to\r\nincrease—Natural selection—Man the most dominant animal in the\r\nworld—Importance of his corporeal structure—The causes which have led\r\nto his becoming erect—Consequent changes of structure—Decrease in size\r\nof the canine teeth—Increased size and altered shape of the\r\nskull—Nakedness —Absence of a tail—Defenceless condition of man.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that man is now subject to much variability. No two\r\nindividuals of the same race are quite alike. We may compare millions\r\nof faces, and each will be distinct. There is an equally great amount\r\nof diversity in the proportions and dimensions of the various parts of\r\nthe body; the length of the legs being one of the most variable points.\r\n(1. ‘Investigations in Military and Anthropological Statistics of\r\nAmerican Soldiers,’ by B.A. Gould, 1869, p. 256.) Although in some\r\nquarters of the world an elongated skull, and in other quarters a short\r\nskull prevails, yet there is great diversity of shape even within the\r\nlimits of the same race, as with the aborigines of America and South\r\nAustralia—the latter a race “probably as pure and homogeneous in blood,\r\ncustoms, and language as any in existence”—and even with the\r\ninhabitants of so confined an area as the Sandwich Islands. (2. With\r\nrespect to the “Cranial forms of the American aborigines,” see Dr.\r\nAitken Meigs in ‘Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.’ Philadelphia, May 1868. On the\r\nAustralians, see Huxley, in Lyell’s ‘Antiquity of Man,’ 1863, p. 87. On\r\nthe Sandwich Islanders, Prof. J. Wyman, ‘Observations on Crania,’\r\nBoston, 1868, p. 18.) An eminent dentist assures me that there is\r\nnearly as much diversity in the teeth as in the features. The chief\r\narteries so frequently run in abnormal courses, that it has been found\r\nuseful for surgical purposes to calculate from 1040 corpses how often\r\neach course prevails. (3. ‘Anatomy of the Arteries,’ by R. Quain.\r\nPreface, vol. i. 1844.) The muscles are eminently variable: thus those\r\nof the foot were found by Prof. Turner (4. ‘Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh,’ vol. xxiv. pp. 175, 189.) not to be strictly\r\nalike in any two out of fifty bodies; and in some the deviations were\r\nconsiderable. He adds, that the power of performing the appropriate\r\nmovements must have been modified in accordance with the several\r\ndeviations. Mr. J. Wood has recorded (5. ‘Proceedings Royal Society,’\r\n1867, p. 544; also 1868, pp. 483, 524. There is a previous paper, 1866,\r\np. 229.) the occurrence of 295 muscular variations in thirty-six\r\nsubjects, and in another set of the same number no less than 558\r\nvariations, those occurring on both sides of the body being only\r\nreckoned as one. In the last set, not one body out of the thirty-six\r\nwas “found totally wanting in departures from the standard descriptions\r\nof the muscular system given in anatomical text books.” A single body\r\npresented the extraordinary number of twenty-five distinct\r\nabnormalities. The same muscle sometimes varies in many ways: thus\r\nProf. Macalister describes (6. ‘Proc. R. Irish Academy,’ vol. x. 1868,\r\np. 141.) no less than twenty distinct variations in the palmaris\r\naccessorius.\r\n\r\nThe famous old anatomist, Wolff (7. ‘Act. Acad. St. Petersburg,’ 1778,\r\npart ii. p. 217.), insists that the internal viscera are more variable\r\nthan the external parts: Nulla particula est quae non aliter et aliter\r\nin aliis se habeat hominibus. He has even written a treatise on the\r\nchoice of typical examples of the viscera for representation. A\r\ndiscussion on the beau-ideal of the liver, lungs, kidneys, etc., as of\r\nthe human face divine, sounds strange in our ears.\r\n\r\nThe variability or diversity of the mental faculties in men of the same\r\nrace, not to mention the greater differences between the men of\r\ndistinct races, is so notorious that not a word need here be said. So\r\nit is with the lower animals. All who have had charge of menageries\r\nadmit this fact, and we see it plainly in our dogs and other domestic\r\nanimals. Brehm especially insists that each individual monkey of those\r\nwhich he kept tame in Africa had its own peculiar disposition and\r\ntemper: he mentions one baboon remarkable for its high intelligence;\r\nand the keepers in the Zoological Gardens pointed out to me a monkey,\r\nbelonging to the New World division, equally remarkable for\r\nintelligence. Rengger, also, insists on the diversity in the various\r\nmental characters of the monkeys of the same species which he kept in\r\nParaguay; and this diversity, as he adds, is partly innate, and partly\r\nthe result of the manner in which they have been treated or educated.\r\n(8. Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. i. ss. 58, 87. Rengger, ‘Säugethiere von\r\nParaguay,’ s. 57.)\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere (9. ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. chap. xii.) so fully discussed the subject of\r\nInheritance, that I need here add hardly anything. A greater number of\r\nfacts have been collected with respect to the transmission of the most\r\ntrifling, as well as of the most important characters in man, than in\r\nany of the lower animals; though the facts are copious enough with\r\nrespect to the latter. So in regard to mental qualities, their\r\ntransmission is manifest in our dogs, horses, and other domestic\r\nanimals. Besides special tastes and habits, general intelligence,\r\ncourage, bad and good temper, etc., are certainly transmitted. With man\r\nwe see similar facts in almost every family; and we now know, through\r\nthe admirable labours of Mr. Galton (10. ‘Hereditary Genius: an Inquiry\r\ninto its Laws and Consequences,’ 1869.), that genius which implies a\r\nwonderfully complex combination of high faculties, tends to be\r\ninherited; and, on the other hand, it is too certain that insanity and\r\ndeteriorated mental powers likewise run in families.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the causes of variability, we are in all cases very\r\nignorant; but we can see that in man as in the lower animals, they\r\nstand in some relation to the conditions to which each species has been\r\nexposed, during several generations. Domesticated animals vary more\r\nthan those in a state of nature; and this is apparently due to the\r\ndiversified and changing nature of the conditions to which they have\r\nbeen subjected. In this respect the different races of man resemble\r\ndomesticated animals, and so do the individuals of the same race, when\r\ninhabiting a very wide area, like that of America. We see the influence\r\nof diversified conditions in the more civilised nations; for the\r\nmembers belonging to different grades of rank, and following different\r\noccupations, present a greater range of character than do the members\r\nof barbarous nations. But the uniformity of savages has often been\r\nexaggerated, and in some cases can hardly be said to exist. (11. Mr.\r\nBates remarks (‘The Naturalist on the Amazons,’ 1863, vol. ii p. 159),\r\nwith respect to the Indians of the same South American tribe, “no two\r\nof them were at all similar in the shape of the head; one man had an\r\noval visage with fine features, and another was quite Mongolian in\r\nbreadth and prominence of cheek, spread of nostrils, and obliquity of\r\neyes.”) It is, nevertheless, an error to speak of man, even if we look\r\nonly to the conditions to which he has been exposed, as “far more\r\ndomesticated” (12. Blumenbach, ‘Treatises on Anthropology.’ Eng.\r\ntranslat., 1865, p. 205.) than any other animal. Some savage races,\r\nsuch as the Australians, are not exposed to more diversified conditions\r\nthan are many species which have a wide range. In another and much more\r\nimportant respect, man differs widely from any strictly domesticated\r\nanimal; for his breeding has never long been controlled, either by\r\nmethodical or unconscious selection. No race or body of men has been so\r\ncompletely subjugated by other men, as that certain individuals should\r\nbe preserved, and thus unconsciously selected, from somehow excelling\r\nin utility to their masters. Nor have certain male and female\r\nindividuals been intentionally picked out and matched, except in the\r\nwell-known case of the Prussian grenadiers; and in this case man\r\nobeyed, as might have been expected, the law of methodical selection;\r\nfor it is asserted that many tall men were reared in the villages\r\ninhabited by the grenadiers and their tall wives. In Sparta, also, a\r\nform of selection was followed, for it was enacted that all children\r\nshould be examined shortly after birth; the well-formed and vigorous\r\nbeing preserved, the others left to perish. (13. Mitford’s ‘History of\r\nGreece,’ vol. i. p. 282. It appears also from a passage in Xenophon’s\r\n‘Memorabilia,’ B. ii. 4 (to which my attention has been called by the\r\nRev. J.N. Hoare), that it was a well recognised principle with the\r\nGreeks, that men ought to select their wives with a view to the health\r\nand vigour of their children. The Grecian poet, Theognis, who lived 550\r\nB.C., clearly saw how important selection, if carefully applied, would\r\nbe for the improvement of mankind. He saw, likewise, that wealth often\r\nchecks the proper action of sexual selection. He thus writes:\r\n\r\n    “With kine and horses, Kurnus! we proceed\r\n    By reasonable rules, and choose a breed\r\n    For profit and increase, at any price:\r\n    Of a sound stock, without defect or vice.\r\n    But, in the daily matches that we make,\r\n    The price is everything:  for money’s sake,\r\n    Men marry:  women are in marriage given\r\n    The churl or ruffian, that in wealth has thriven,\r\n    May match his offspring with the proudest race:\r\n    Thus everything is mix’d, noble and base!\r\n    If then in outward manner, form, and mind,\r\n    You find us a degraded, motley kind,\r\n    Wonder no more, my friend! the cause is plain,\r\n    And to lament the consequence is vain.”\r\n\r\n(The Works of J. Hookham Frere, vol. ii. 1872, p. 334.))\r\n\r\nIf we consider all the races of man as forming a single species, his\r\nrange is enormous; but some separate races, as the Americans and\r\nPolynesians, have very wide ranges. It is a well-known law that\r\nwidely-ranging species are much more variable than species with\r\nrestricted ranges; and the variability of man may with more truth be\r\ncompared with that of widely-ranging species, than with that of\r\ndomesticated animals.\r\n\r\nNot only does variability appear to be induced in man and the lower\r\nanimals by the same general causes, but in both the same parts of the\r\nbody are affected in a closely analogous manner. This has been proved\r\nin such full detail by Godron and Quatrefages, that I need here only\r\nrefer to their works. (14. Godron, ‘De l’Espèce,’ 1859, tom. ii. livre\r\n3. Quatrefages, ‘Unité de l’Espèce Humaine,’ 1861. Also Lectures on\r\nAnthropology, given in the ‘Revue des Cours Scientifiques,’ 1866-1868.)\r\nMonstrosities, which graduate into slight variations, are likewise so\r\nsimilar in man and the lower animals, that the same classification and\r\nthe same terms can be used for both, as has been shewn by Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire. (15. ‘Hist. Gen. et Part. des Anomalies de\r\nl’Organisation,’ in three volumes, tom. i. 1832.) In my work on the\r\nvariation of domestic animals, I have attempted to arrange in a rude\r\nfashion the laws of variation under the following heads:—The direct and\r\ndefinite action of changed conditions, as exhibited by all or nearly\r\nall the individuals of the same species, varying in the same manner\r\nunder the same circumstances. The effects of the long-continued use or\r\ndisuse of parts. The cohesion of homologous parts. The variability of\r\nmultiple parts. Compensation of growth; but of this law I have found no\r\ngood instance in the case of man. The effects of the mechanical\r\npressure of one part on another; as of the pelvis on the cranium of the\r\ninfant in the womb. Arrests of development, leading to the diminution\r\nor suppression of parts. The reappearance of long-lost characters\r\nthrough reversion. And lastly, correlated variation. All these\r\nso-called laws apply equally to man and the lower animals; and most of\r\nthem even to plants. It would be superfluous here to discuss all of\r\nthem (16. I have fully discussed these laws in my ‘Variation of Animals\r\nand Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. chap. xxii. and xxiii. M.\r\nJ.P. Durand has lately (1868) published a valuable essay, ‘De\r\nl’Influence des Milieux,’ etc. He lays much stress, in the case of\r\nplants, on the nature of the soil.); but several are so important, that\r\nthey must be treated at considerable length.\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECT AND DEFINITE ACTION OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\nThis is a most perplexing subject. It cannot be denied that changed\r\nconditions produce some, and occasionally a considerable effect, on\r\norganisms of all kinds; and it seems at first probable that if\r\nsufficient time were allowed this would be the invariable result. But I\r\nhave failed to obtain clear evidence in favour of this conclusion; and\r\nvalid reasons may be urged on the other side, at least as far as the\r\ninnumerable structures are concerned, which are adapted for special\r\nends. There can, however, be no doubt that changed conditions induce an\r\nalmost indefinite amount of fluctuating variability, by which the whole\r\norganisation is rendered in some degree plastic.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, above 1,000,000 soldiers, who served in the late\r\nwar, were measured, and the States in which they were born and reared\r\nwere recorded. (17. ‘Investigations in Military and Anthrop.\r\nStatistics,’ etc., 1869, by B.A. Gould, pp. 93, 107, 126, 131, 134.)\r\nFrom this astonishing number of observations it is proved that local\r\ninfluences of some kind act directly on stature; and we further learn\r\nthat “the State where the physical growth has in great measure taken\r\nplace, and the State of birth, which indicates the ancestry, seem to\r\nexert a marked influence on the stature.” For instance, it is\r\nestablished, “that residence in the Western States, during the years of\r\ngrowth, tends to produce increase of stature.” On the other hand, it is\r\ncertain that with sailors, their life delays growth, as shewn “by the\r\ngreat difference between the statures of soldiers and sailors at the\r\nages of seventeen and eighteen years.” Mr. B.A. Gould endeavoured to\r\nascertain the nature of the influences which thus act on stature; but\r\nhe arrived only at negative results, namely that they did not relate to\r\nclimate, the elevation of the land, soil, nor even “in any controlling\r\ndegree” to the abundance or the need of the comforts of life. This\r\nlatter conclusion is directly opposed to that arrived at by Villerme,\r\nfrom the statistics of the height of the conscripts in different parts\r\nof France. When we compare the differences in stature between the\r\nPolynesian chiefs and the lower orders within the same islands, or\r\nbetween the inhabitants of the fertile volcanic and low barren coral\r\nislands of the same ocean (18. For the Polynesians, see Prichard’s\r\n‘Physical History of Mankind,’ vol. v. 1847, pp. 145, 283. Also Godron,\r\n‘De l’Espèce,’ tom. ii. p. 289. There is also a remarkable difference\r\nin appearance between the closely-allied Hindoos inhabiting the Upper\r\nGanges and Bengal; see Elphinstone’s ‘History of India,’ vol. i. p.\r\n324.) or again between the Fuegians on the eastern and western shores\r\nof their country, where the means of subsistence are very different, it\r\nis scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that better food and\r\ngreater comfort do influence stature. But the preceding statements shew\r\nhow difficult it is to arrive at any precise result. Dr. Beddoe has\r\nlately proved that, with the inhabitants of Britain, residence in towns\r\nand certain occupations have a deteriorating influence on height; and\r\nhe infers that the result is to a certain extent inherited, as is\r\nlikewise the case in the United States. Dr. Beddoe further believes\r\nthat wherever a “race attains its maximum of physical development, it\r\nrises highest in energy and moral vigour.” (19. ‘Memoirs,\r\nAnthropological Society,’ vol. iii. 1867-69, pp. 561, 565, 567.)\r\n\r\nWhether external conditions produce any other direct effect on man is\r\nnot known. It might have been expected that differences of climate\r\nwould have had a marked influence, inasmuch as the lungs and kidneys\r\nare brought into activity under a low temperature, and the liver and\r\nskin under a high one. (20. Dr. Brakenridge, ‘Theory of Diathesis,’\r\n‘Medical Times,’ June 19 and July 17, 1869.) It was formerly thought\r\nthat the colour of the skin and the character of the hair were\r\ndetermined by light or heat; and although it can hardly be denied that\r\nsome effect is thus produced, almost all observers now agree that the\r\neffect has been very small, even after exposure during many ages. But\r\nthis subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the\r\ndifferent races of mankind. With our domestic animals there are grounds\r\nfor believing that cold and damp directly affect the growth of the\r\nhair; but I have not met with any evidence on this head in the case of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF A PARTS.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that use strengthens the muscles in the individual,\r\nand complete disuse, or the destruction of the proper nerve, weakens\r\nthem. When the eye is destroyed, the optic nerve often becomes\r\natrophied. When an artery is tied, the lateral channels increase not\r\nonly in diameter, but in the thickness and strength of their coats.\r\nWhen one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in\r\nsize, and does double work. Bones increase not only in thickness, but\r\nin length, from carrying a greater weight. (21. I have given\r\nauthorities for these several statements in my ‘Variation of Animals\r\nand Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. pp. 297-300. Dr. Jaeger,\r\n“Über das Langenwachsthum der Knochen,” ‘Jenäischen Zeitschrift,’ B. v.\r\nHeft. i.) Different occupations, habitually followed, lead to changed\r\nproportions in various parts of the body. Thus it was ascertained by\r\nthe United States Commission (22. ‘Investigations,’ etc., by B.A.\r\nGould, 1869, p. 288.) that the legs of the sailors employed in the late\r\nwar were longer by 0.217 of an inch than those of the soldiers, though\r\nthe sailors were on an average shorter men; whilst their arms were\r\nshorter by 1.09 of an inch, and therefore, out of proportion, shorter\r\nin relation to their lesser height. This shortness of the arms is\r\napparently due to their greater use, and is an unexpected result: but\r\nsailors chiefly use their arms in pulling, and not in supporting\r\nweights. With sailors, the girth of the neck and the depth of the\r\ninstep are greater, whilst the circumference of the chest, waist, and\r\nhips is less, than in soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhether the several foregoing modifications would become hereditary, if\r\nthe same habits of life were followed during many generations, is not\r\nknown, but it is probable. Rengger (23. ‘Säugethiere von Paraguay,’\r\n1830, s. 4.) attributes the thin legs and thick arms of the Payaguas\r\nIndians to successive generations having passed nearly their whole\r\nlives in canoes, with their lower extremities motionless. Other writers\r\nhave come to a similar conclusion in analogous cases. According to\r\nCranz (24. ‘History of Greenland,’ Eng. translat., 1767, vol. i. p.\r\n230.), who lived for a long time with the Esquimaux, “the natives\r\nbelieve that ingenuity and dexterity in seal-catching (their highest\r\nart and virtue) is hereditary; there is really something in it, for the\r\nson of a celebrated seal-catcher will distinguish himself, though he\r\nlost his father in childhood.” But in this case it is mental aptitude,\r\nquite as much as bodily structure, which appears to be inherited. It is\r\nasserted that the hands of English labourers are at birth larger than\r\nthose of the gentry. (25. ‘Intermarriage,’ by Alex. Walker, 1838, p.\r\n377.) From the correlation which exists, at least in some cases (26.\r\n‘The Variation of Animals under Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 173.),\r\nbetween the development of the extremities and of the jaws, it is\r\npossible that in those classes which do not labour much with their\r\nhands and feet, the jaws would be reduced in size from this cause. That\r\nthey are generally smaller in refined and civilised men than in\r\nhard-working men or savages, is certain. But with savages, as Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer (27. ‘Principles of Biology,’ vol. i. p. 455.) has\r\nremarked, the greater use of the jaws in chewing coarse, uncooked food,\r\nwould act in a direct manner on the masticatory muscles, and on the\r\nbones to which they are attached. In infants, long before birth, the\r\nskin on the soles of the feet is thicker than on any other part of the\r\nbody; (28. Paget, ‘Lectures on Surgical Pathology,’ vol. ii, 1853, p.\r\n209.) and it can hardly be doubted that this is due to the inherited\r\neffects of pressure during a long series of generations.\r\n\r\nIt is familiar to every one that watchmakers and engravers are liable\r\nto be short-sighted, whilst men living much out of doors, and\r\nespecially savages, are generally long-sighted. (29. It is a singular\r\nand unexpected fact that sailors are inferior to landsmen in their mean\r\ndistance of distinct vision. Dr. B.A. Gould (‘Sanitary Memoirs of the\r\nWar of the Rebellion,’ 1869, p. 530), has proved this to be the case;\r\nand he accounts for it by the ordinary range of vision in sailors being\r\n“restricted to the length of the vessel and the height of the masts.”)\r\nShort-sight and long-sight certainly tend to be inherited. (30. ‘The\r\nVariation of Animals under Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 8.) The\r\ninferiority of Europeans, in comparison with savages, in eyesight and\r\nin the other senses, is no doubt the accumulated and transmitted effect\r\nof lessened use during many generations; for Rengger (31. ‘Säugethiere\r\nvon Paraguay,’ s. 8, 10. I have had good opportunities for observing\r\nthe extraordinary power of eyesight in the Fuegians. See also Lawrence\r\n(‘Lectures on Physiology,’ etc., 1822, p. 404) on this same subject. M.\r\nGiraud-Teulon has recently collected (‘Revue des Cours Scientifiques,’\r\n1870, p. 625) a large and valuable body of evidence proving that the\r\ncause of short-sight, “C’est le travail assidu, de près.”) states that\r\nhe has repeatedly observed Europeans, who had been brought up and spent\r\ntheir whole lives with the wild Indians, who nevertheless did not equal\r\nthem in the sharpness of their senses. The same naturalist observes\r\nthat the cavities in the skull for the reception of the several\r\nsense-organs are larger in the American aborigines than in Europeans;\r\nand this probably indicates a corresponding difference in the\r\ndimensions of the organs themselves. Blumenbach has also remarked on\r\nthe large size of the nasal cavities in the skulls of the American\r\naborigines, and connects this fact with their remarkably acute power of\r\nsmell. The Mongolians of the plains of northern Asia, according to\r\nPallas, have wonderfully perfect senses; and Prichard believes that the\r\ngreat breadth of their skulls across the zygomas follows from their\r\nhighly-developed sense organs. (32. Prichard, ‘Physical History of\r\nMankind,’ on the authority of Blumenbach, vol. i. 1851, p. 311; for the\r\nstatement by Pallas, vol. iv. 1844, p. 407.)\r\n\r\nThe Quechua Indians inhabit the lofty plateaux of Peru; and Alcide\r\nd’Orbigny states (33. Quoted by Prichard, ‘Researches into the Physical\r\nHistory of Mankind,’ vol. v. p. 463.) that, from continually breathing\r\na highly rarefied atmosphere, they have acquired chests and lungs of\r\nextraordinary dimensions. The cells, also, of the lungs are larger and\r\nmore numerous than in Europeans. These observations have been doubted,\r\nbut Mr. D. Forbes carefully measured many Aymaras, an allied race,\r\nliving at the height of between 10,000 and 15,000 feet; and he informs\r\nme (34. Mr. Forbes’ valuable paper is now published in the ‘Journal of\r\nthe Ethnological Society of London,’ new series, vol. ii. 1870, p.193.)\r\nthat they differ conspicuously from the men of all other races seen by\r\nhim in the circumference and length of their bodies. In his table of\r\nmeasurements, the stature of each man is taken at 1000, and the other\r\nmeasurements are reduced to this standard. It is here seen that the\r\nextended arms of the Aymaras are shorter than those of Europeans, and\r\nmuch shorter than those of Negroes. The legs are likewise shorter; and\r\nthey present this remarkable peculiarity, that in every Aymara\r\nmeasured, the femur is actually shorter than the tibia. On an average,\r\nthe length of the femur to that of the tibia is as 211 to 252; whilst\r\nin two Europeans, measured at the same time, the femora to the tibiae\r\nwere as 244 to 230; and in three Negroes as 258 to 241. The humerus is\r\nlikewise shorter relatively to the forearm. This shortening of that\r\npart of the limb which is nearest to the body, appears to be, as\r\nsuggested to me by Mr. Forbes, a case of compensation in relation with\r\nthe greatly increased length of the trunk. The Aymaras present some\r\nother singular points of structure, for instance, the very small\r\nprojection of the heel.\r\n\r\nThese men are so thoroughly acclimatised to their cold and lofty abode,\r\nthat when formerly carried down by the Spaniards to the low eastern\r\nplains, and when now tempted down by high wages to the gold-washings,\r\nthey suffer a frightful rate of mortality. Nevertheless Mr. Forbes\r\nfound a few pure families which had survived during two generations:\r\nand he observed that they still inherited their characteristic\r\npeculiarities. But it was manifest, even without measurement, that\r\nthese peculiarities had all decreased; and on measurement, their bodies\r\nwere found not to be so much elongated as those of the men on the high\r\nplateau; whilst their femora had become somewhat lengthened, as had\r\ntheir tibiae, although in a less degree. The actual measurements may be\r\nseen by consulting Mr. Forbes’s memoir. From these observations, there\r\ncan, I think, be no doubt that residence during many generations at a\r\ngreat elevation tends, both directly and indirectly, to induce\r\ninherited modifications in the proportions of the body. (35. Dr.\r\nWilckens (‘Landwirthschaft. Wochenblatt,’ No. 10, 1869) has lately\r\npublished an interesting essay shewing how domestic animals, which live\r\nin mountainous regions, have their frames modified.)\r\n\r\nAlthough man may not have been much modified during the latter stages\r\nof his existence through the increased or decreased use of parts, the\r\nfacts now given shew that his liability in this respect has not been\r\nlost; and we positively know that the same law holds good with the\r\nlower animals. Consequently we may infer that when at a remote epoch\r\nthe progenitors of man were in a transitional state, and were changing\r\nfrom quadrupeds into bipeds, natural selection would probably have been\r\ngreatly aided by the inherited effects of the increased or diminished\r\nuse of the different parts of the body.\r\n\r\nARRESTS OF DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between arrested development and arrested growth,\r\nfor parts in the former state continue to grow whilst still retaining\r\ntheir early condition. Various monstrosities come under this head; and\r\nsome, as a cleft palate, are known to be occasionally inherited. It\r\nwill suffice for our purpose to refer to the arrested brain-development\r\nof microcephalous idiots, as described in Vogt’s memoir. (36. ‘Mémoire\r\nsur les Microcephales,’ 1867, pp. 50, 125, 169, 171, 184-198.) Their\r\nskulls are smaller, and the convolutions of the brain are less complex\r\nthan in normal men. The frontal sinus, or the projection over the\r\neye-brows, is largely developed, and the jaws are prognathous to an\r\n“effrayant” degree; so that these idiots somewhat resemble the lower\r\ntypes of mankind. Their intelligence, and most of their mental\r\nfaculties, are extremely feeble. They cannot acquire the power of\r\nspeech, and are wholly incapable of prolonged attention, but are much\r\ngiven to imitation. They are strong and remarkably active, continually\r\ngambolling and jumping about, and making grimaces. They often ascend\r\nstairs on all-fours; and are curiously fond of climbing up furniture or\r\ntrees. We are thus reminded of the delight shewn by almost all boys in\r\nclimbing trees; and this again reminds us how lambs and kids,\r\noriginally alpine animals, delight to frisk on any hillock, however\r\nsmall. Idiots also resemble the lower animals in some other respects;\r\nthus several cases are recorded of their carefully smelling every\r\nmouthful of food before eating it. One idiot is described as often\r\nusing his mouth in aid of his hands, whilst hunting for lice. They are\r\noften filthy in their habits, and have no sense of decency; and several\r\ncases have been published of their bodies being remarkably hairy. (37.\r\nProf. Laycock sums up the character of brute-like idiots by calling\r\nthem “theroid;” ‘Journal of Mental Science,’ July 1863. Dr. Scott (‘The\r\nDeaf and Dumb,’ 2nd ed. 1870, p. 10) has often observed the imbecile\r\nsmelling their food. See, on this same subject, and on the hairiness of\r\nidiots, Dr. Maudsley, ‘Body and Mind,’ 1870, pp. 46-51. Pinel has also\r\ngiven a striking case of hairiness in an idiot.)\r\n\r\nREVERSION.\r\n\r\nMany of the cases to be here given, might have been introduced under\r\nthe last heading. When a structure is arrested in its development, but\r\nstill continues growing, until it closely resembles a corresponding\r\nstructure in some lower and adult member of the same group, it may in\r\none sense be considered as a case of reversion. The lower members in a\r\ngroup give us some idea how the common progenitor was probably\r\nconstructed; and it is hardly credible that a complex part, arrested at\r\nan early phase of embryonic development, should go on growing so as\r\nultimately to perform its proper function, unless it had acquired such\r\npower during some earlier state of existence, when the present\r\nexceptional or arrested structure was normal. The simple brain of a\r\nmicrocephalous idiot, in as far as it resembles that of an ape, may in\r\nthis sense be said to offer a case of reversion. (38. In my ‘Variation\r\nof Animals under Domestication’ (vol. ii. p. 57), I attributed the not\r\nvery rare cases of supernumerary mammae in women to reversion. I was\r\nled to this as a probable conclusion, by the additional mammae being\r\ngenerally placed symmetrically on the breast; and more especially from\r\none case, in which a single efficient mamma occurred in the inguinal\r\nregion of a woman, the daughter of another woman with supernumerary\r\nmammae. But I now find (see, for instance, Prof. Preyer, ‘Der Kampf um\r\ndas Dasein,’ 1869, s. 45) that mammae erraticae, occur in other\r\nsituations, as on the back, in the armpit, and on the thigh; the mammae\r\nin this latter instance having given so much milk that the child was\r\nthus nourished. The probability that the additional mammae are due to\r\nreversion is thus much weakened; nevertheless, it still seems to me\r\nprobable, because two pairs are often found symmetrically on the\r\nbreast; and of this I myself have received information in several\r\ncases. It is well known that some Lemurs normally have two pairs of\r\nmammae on the breast. Five cases have been recorded of the presence of\r\nmore than a pair of mammae (of course rudimentary) in the male sex of\r\nmankind; see ‘Journal of Anat. and Physiology,’ 1872, p. 56, for a case\r\ngiven by Dr. Handyside, in which two brothers exhibited this\r\npeculiarity; see also a paper by Dr. Bartels, in ‘Reichert’s and du\r\nBois-Reymond’s Archiv.,’ 1872, p. 304. In one of the cases alluded to\r\nby Dr. Bartels, a man bore five mammae, one being medial and placed\r\nabove the navel; Meckel von Hemsbach thinks that this latter case is\r\nillustrated by a medial mamma occurring in certain Cheiroptera. On the\r\nwhole, we may well doubt if additional mammae would ever have been\r\ndeveloped in both sexes of mankind, had not his early progenitors been\r\nprovided with more than a single pair.\r\n\r\nIn the above work (vol. ii. p. 12), I also attributed, though with much\r\nhesitation, the frequent cases of polydactylism in men and various\r\nanimals to reversion. I was partly led to this through Prof. Owen’s\r\nstatement, that some of the Ichthyopterygia possess more than five\r\ndigits, and therefore, as I supposed, had retained a primordial\r\ncondition; but Prof. Gegenbaur (‘Jenaischen Zeitschrift,’ B. v. Heft 3,\r\ns. 341), disputes Owen’s conclusion. On the other hand, according to\r\nthe opinion lately advanced by Dr. Gunther, on the paddle of Ceratodus,\r\nwhich is provided with articulated bony rays on both sides of a central\r\nchain of bones, there seems no great difficulty in admitting that six\r\nor more digits on one side, or on both sides, might reappear through\r\nreversion. I am informed by Dr. Zouteveen that there is a case on\r\nrecord of a man having twenty-four fingers and twenty-four toes! I was\r\nchiefly led to the conclusion that the presence of supernumerary digits\r\nmight be due to reversion from the fact that such digits, not only are\r\nstrongly inherited, but, as I then believed, had the power of regrowth\r\nafter amputation, like the normal digits of the lower vertebrata. But I\r\nhave explained in the second edition of my Variation under\r\nDomestication why I now place little reliance on the recorded cases of\r\nsuch regrowth. Nevertheless it deserves notice, inasmuch as arrested\r\ndevelopment and reversion are intimately related processes; that\r\nvarious structures in an embryonic or arrested condition, such as a\r\ncleft palate, bifid uterus, etc., are frequently accompanied by\r\npolydactylism. This has been strongly insisted on by Meckel and Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire. But at present it is the safest course to give up\r\naltogether the idea that there is any relation between the development\r\nof supernumerary digits and reversion to some lowly organised\r\nprogenitor of man.) There are other cases which come more strictly\r\nunder our present head of reversion. Certain structures, regularly\r\noccurring in the lower members of the group to which man belongs,\r\noccasionally make their appearance in him, though not found in the\r\nnormal human embryo; or, if normally present in the human embryo, they\r\nbecome abnormally developed, although in a manner which is normal in\r\nthe lower members of the group. These remarks will be rendered clearer\r\nby the following illustrations.\r\n\r\nIn various mammals the uterus graduates from a double organ with two\r\ndistinct orifices and two passages, as in the marsupials, into a single\r\norgan, which is in no way double except from having a slight internal\r\nfold, as in the higher apes and man. The rodents exhibit a perfect\r\nseries of gradations between these two extreme states. In all mammals\r\nthe uterus is developed from two simple primitive tubes, the inferior\r\nportions of which form the cornua; and it is in the words of Dr. Farre,\r\n“by the coalescence of the two cornua at their lower extremities that\r\nthe body of the uterus is formed in man; while in those animals in\r\nwhich no middle portion or body exists, the cornua remain ununited. As\r\nthe development of the uterus proceeds, the two cornua become gradually\r\nshorter, until at length they are lost, or, as it were, absorbed into\r\nthe body of the uterus.” The angles of the uterus are still produced\r\ninto cornua, even in animals as high up in the scale as the lower apes\r\nand lemurs.\r\n\r\nNow in women, anomalous cases are not very infrequent, in which the\r\nmature uterus is furnished with cornua, or is partially divided into\r\ntwo organs; and such cases, according to Owen, repeat “the grade of\r\nconcentrative development,” attained by certain rodents. Here perhaps\r\nwe have an instance of a simple arrest of embryonic development, with\r\nsubsequent growth and perfect functional development; for either side\r\nof the partially double uterus is capable of performing the proper\r\noffice of gestation. In other and rarer cases, two distinct uterine\r\ncavities are formed, each having its proper orifice and passage. (39.\r\nSee Dr. A. Farre’s well-known article in the ‘Cyclopaedia of Anatomy\r\nand Physiology,’ vol. v. 1859, p. 642. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’\r\nvol. iii. 1868, p. 687. Professor Turner, in ‘Edinburgh Medical\r\nJournal,’ February, 1865.) No such stage is passed through during the\r\nordinary development of the embryo; and it is difficult to believe,\r\nthough perhaps not impossible, that the two simple, minute, primitive\r\ntubes should know how (if such an expression may be used) to grow into\r\ntwo distinct uteri, each with a well-constructed orifice and passage,\r\nand each furnished with numerous muscles, nerves, glands and vessels,\r\nif they had not formerly passed through a similar course of\r\ndevelopment, as in the case of existing marsupials. No one will pretend\r\nthat so perfect a structure as the abnormal double uterus in woman\r\ncould be the result of mere chance. But the principle of reversion, by\r\nwhich a long-lost structure is called back into existence, might serve\r\nas the guide for its full development, even after the lapse of an\r\nenormous interval of time.\r\n\r\nProfessor Canestrini, after discussing the foregoing and various\r\nanalogous cases, arrives at the same conclusion as that just given. He\r\nadduces another instance, in the case of the malar bone (40. ‘Annuario\r\ndella Soc. dei Naturalisti,’ Modena, 1867, p. 83. Prof. Canestrini\r\ngives extracts on this subject from various authorities. Laurillard\r\nremarks, that as he has found a complete similarity in the form,\r\nproportions, and connection of the two malar bones in several human\r\nsubjects and in certain apes, he cannot consider this disposition of\r\nthe parts as simply accidental. Another paper on this same anomaly has\r\nbeen published by Dr. Saviotti in the ‘Gazzetta delle Cliniche,’ Turin,\r\n1871, where he says that traces of the division may be detected in\r\nabout two per cent. of adult skulls; he also remarks that it more\r\nfrequently occurs in prognathous skulls, not of the Aryan race, than in\r\nothers. See also G. Delorenzi on the same subject; ‘Tre nuovi casi\r\nd’anomalia dell’ osso malare,’ Torino, 1872. Also, E. Morselli, ‘Sopra\r\nuna rara anomalia dell’ osso malare,’ Modena, 1872. Still more recently\r\nGruber has written a pamphlet on the division of this bone. I give\r\nthese references because a reviewer, without any grounds or scruples,\r\nhas thrown doubts on my statements.), which, in some of the Quadrumana\r\nand other mammals, normally consists of two portions. This is its\r\ncondition in the human foetus when two months old; and through arrested\r\ndevelopment, it sometimes remains thus in man when adult, more\r\nespecially in the lower prognathous races. Hence Canestrini concludes\r\nthat some ancient progenitor of man must have had this bone normally\r\ndivided into two portions, which afterwards became fused together. In\r\nman the frontal bone consists of a single piece, but in the embryo, and\r\nin children, and in almost all the lower mammals, it consists of two\r\npieces separated by a distinct suture. This suture occasionally\r\npersists more or less distinctly in man after maturity; and more\r\nfrequently in ancient than in recent crania, especially, as Canestrini\r\nhas observed, in those exhumed from the Drift, and belonging to the\r\nbrachycephalic type. Here again he comes to the same conclusion as in\r\nthe analogous case of the malar bones. In this, and other instances\r\npresently to be given, the cause of ancient races approaching the lower\r\nanimals in certain characters more frequently than do the modern races,\r\nappears to be, that the latter stand at a somewhat greater distance in\r\nthe long line of descent from their early semi-human progenitors.\r\n\r\nVarious other anomalies in man, more or less analogous to the\r\nforegoing, have been advanced by different authors, as cases of\r\nreversion; but these seem not a little doubtful, for we have to descend\r\nextremely low in the mammalian series, before we find such structures\r\nnormally present. (41. A whole series of cases is given by Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire, ‘Hist. des Anomalies,’ tom, iii, p. 437. A\r\nreviewer (‘Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,’ 1871, p. 366) blames me\r\nmuch for not having discussed the numerous cases, which have been\r\nrecorded, of various parts arrested in their development. He says that,\r\naccording to my theory, “every transient condition of an organ, during\r\nits development, is not only a means to an end, but once was an end in\r\nitself.” This does not seem to me necessarily to hold good. Why should\r\nnot variations occur during an early period of development, having no\r\nrelation to reversion; yet such variations might be preserved and\r\naccumulated, if in any way serviceable, for instance, in shortening and\r\nsimplifying the course of development? And again, why should not\r\ninjurious abnormalities, such as atrophied or hypertrophied parts,\r\nwhich have no relation to a former state of existence, occur at an\r\nearly period, as well as during maturity?)\r\n\r\nIn man, the canine teeth are perfectly efficient instruments for\r\nmastication. But their true canine character, as Owen (42. ‘Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. iii. 1868, p. 323.) remarks, “is indicated by the\r\nconical form of the crown, which terminates in an obtuse point, is\r\nconvex outward and flat or sub-concave within, at the base of which\r\nsurface there is a feeble prominence. The conical form is best\r\nexpressed in the Melanian races, especially the Australian. The canine\r\nis more deeply implanted, and by a stronger fang than the incisors.”\r\nNevertheless, this tooth no longer serves man as a special weapon for\r\ntearing his enemies or prey; it may, therefore, as far as its proper\r\nfunction is concerned, be considered as rudimentary. In every large\r\ncollection of human skulls some may be found, as Haeckel (43.\r\n‘Generelle Morphologie,’ 1866, B. ii. s. clv.) observes, with the\r\ncanine teeth projecting considerably beyond the others in the same\r\nmanner as in the anthropomorphous apes, but in a less degree. In these\r\ncases, open spaces between the teeth in the one jaw are left for the\r\nreception of the canines of the opposite jaw. An inter-space of this\r\nkind in a Kaffir skull, figured by Wagner, is surprisingly wide. (44.\r\nCarl Vogt’s ‘Lectures on Man,’ Eng. translat., 1864, p. 151.)\r\nConsidering how few are the ancient skulls which have been examined,\r\ncompared to recent skulls, it is an interesting fact that in at least\r\nthree cases the canines project largely; and in the Naulette jaw they\r\nare spoken of as enormous. (45. C. Carter Blake, on a jaw from La\r\nNaulette, ‘Anthropological Review,’ 1867, p. 295. Schaaffhausen, ibid.\r\n1868, p. 426.)\r\n\r\nOf the anthropomorphous apes the males alone have their canines fully\r\ndeveloped; but in the female gorilla, and in a less degree in the\r\nfemale orang, these teeth project considerably beyond the others;\r\ntherefore the fact, of which I have been assured, that women sometimes\r\nhave considerably projecting canines, is no serious objection to the\r\nbelief that their occasional great development in man is a case of\r\nreversion to an ape-like progenitor. He who rejects with scorn the\r\nbelief that the shape of his own canines, and their occasional great\r\ndevelopment in other men, are due to our early forefathers having been\r\nprovided with these formidable weapons, will probably reveal, by\r\nsneering, the line of his descent. For though he no longer intends, nor\r\nhas the power, to use these teeth as weapons, he will unconsciously\r\nretract his “snarling muscles” (thus named by Sir C. Bell) (46. The\r\nAnatomy of Expression, 1844, pp. 110, 131.), so as to expose them ready\r\nfor action, like a dog prepared to fight.\r\n\r\nMany muscles are occasionally developed in man, which are proper to the\r\nQuadrumana or other mammals. Professor Vlacovich (47. Quoted by Prof.\r\nCanestrini in the ‘Annuario della Soc. dei Naturalisti,’ 1867, p. 90.)\r\nexamined forty male subjects, and found a muscle, called by him the\r\nischio-pubic, in nineteen of them; in three others there was a ligament\r\nwhich represented this muscle; and in the remaining eighteen no trace\r\nof it. In only two out of thirty female subjects was this muscle\r\ndeveloped on both sides, but in three others the rudimentary ligament\r\nwas present. This muscle, therefore, appears to be much more common in\r\nthe male than in the female sex; and on the belief in the descent of\r\nman from some lower form, the fact is intelligible; for it has been\r\ndetected in several of the lower animals, and in all of these it serves\r\nexclusively to aid the male in the act of reproduction.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Wood, in his valuable series of papers (48. These papers deserve\r\ncareful study by any one who desires to learn how frequently our\r\nmuscles vary, and in varying come to resemble those of the Quadrumana.\r\nThe following references relate to the few points touched on in my\r\ntext: ‘Proc. Royal Soc.’ vol. xiv. 1865, pp. 379-384; vol. xv. 1866,\r\npp. 241, 242; vol. xv. 1867, p. 544; vol. xvi. 1868, p. 524. I may here\r\nadd that Dr. Murie and Mr. St. George Mivart have shewn in their Memoir\r\non the Lemuroidea (‘Transactions, Zoological Society,’ vol. vii. 1869,\r\np. 96), how extraordinarily variable some of the muscles are in these\r\nanimals, the lowest members of the Primates. Gradations, also, in the\r\nmuscles leading to structures found in animals still lower in the\r\nscale, are numerous in the Lemuroidea.), has minutely described a vast\r\nnumber of muscular variations in man, which resemble normal structures\r\nin the lower animals. The muscles which closely resemble those\r\nregularly present in our nearest allies, the Quadrumana, are too\r\nnumerous to be here even specified. In a single male subject, having a\r\nstrong bodily frame, and well-formed skull, no less than seven muscular\r\nvariations were observed, all of which plainly represented muscles\r\nproper to various kinds of apes. This man, for instance, had on both\r\nsides of his neck a true and powerful “levator claviculae,” such as is\r\nfound in all kinds of apes, and which is said to occur in about one out\r\nof sixty human subjects. (49. See also Prof. Macalister in\r\n‘Proceedings, Royal Irish Academy,’ vol. x. 1868, p. 124.) Again, this\r\nman had “a special abductor of the metatarsal bone of the fifth digit,\r\nsuch as Professor Huxley and Mr. Flower have shewn to exist uniformly\r\nin the higher and lower apes.” I will give only two additional cases;\r\nthe acromio-basilar muscle is found in all mammals below man, and seems\r\nto be correlated with a quadrupedal gait, (50. Mr. Champneys in\r\n‘Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,’ Nov. 1871, p. 178.) and it occurs\r\nin about one out of sixty human subjects. In the lower extremities Mr.\r\nBradley (51. Ibid. May 1872, p. 421.) found an abductor ossis metatarsi\r\nquinti in both feet of man; this muscle had not up to that time been\r\nrecorded in mankind, but is always present in the anthropomorphous\r\napes. The muscles of the hands and arms—parts which are so eminently\r\ncharacteristic of man—are extremely liable to vary, so as to resemble\r\nthe corresponding muscles in the lower animals. (52. Prof. Macalister\r\n(ibid. p. 121) has tabulated his observations, and finds that muscular\r\nabnormalities are most frequent in the fore-arms, secondly, in the\r\nface, thirdly, in the foot, etc.) Such resemblances are either perfect\r\nor imperfect; yet in the latter case they are manifestly of a\r\ntransitional nature. Certain variations are more common in man, and\r\nothers in woman, without our being able to assign any reason. Mr. Wood,\r\nafter describing numerous variations, makes the following pregnant\r\nremark. “Notable departures from the ordinary type of the muscular\r\nstructures run in grooves or directions, which must be taken to\r\nindicate some unknown factor, of much importance to a comprehensive\r\nknowledge of general and scientific anatomy.” (53. The Rev. Dr.\r\nHaughton, after giving (‘Proc. R. Irish Academy,’ June 27, 1864, p.\r\n715) a remarkable case of variation in the human flexor pollicis\r\nlongus, adds, “This remarkable example shews that man may sometimes\r\npossess the arrangement of tendons of thumb and fingers characteristic\r\nof the macaque; but whether such a case should be regarded as a macaque\r\npassing upwards into a man, or a man passing downwards into a macaque,\r\nor as a congenital freak of nature, I cannot undertake to say.” It is\r\nsatisfactory to hear so capable an anatomist, and so embittered an\r\nopponent of evolutionism, admitting even the possibility of either of\r\nhis first propositions. Prof. Macalister has also described\r\n(‘Proceedings Royal Irish Academy,’ vol. x. 1864, p. 138) variations in\r\nthe flexor pollicis longus, remarkable from their relations to the same\r\nmuscle in the Quadrumana.)\r\n\r\nThat this unknown factor is reversion to a former state of existence\r\nmay be admitted as in the highest degree probable. (54. Since the first\r\nedition of this book appeared, Mr. Wood has published another memoir in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions, 1870, p. 83, on the varieties of the\r\nmuscles of the human neck, shoulder, and chest. He here shews how\r\nextremely variable these muscles are, and how often and how closely the\r\nvariations resemble the normal muscles of the lower animals. He sums up\r\nby remarking, “It will be enough for my purpose if I have succeeded in\r\nshewing the more important forms which, when occurring as varieties in\r\nthe human subject, tend to exhibit in a sufficiently marked manner what\r\nmay be considered as proofs and examples of the Darwinian principle of\r\nreversion, or law of inheritance, in this department of anatomical\r\nscience.”) It is quite incredible that a man should through mere\r\naccident abnormally resemble certain apes in no less than seven of his\r\nmuscles, if there had been no genetic connection between them. On the\r\nother hand, if man is descended from some ape-like creature, no valid\r\nreason can be assigned why certain muscles should not suddenly reappear\r\nafter an interval of many thousand generations, in the same manner as\r\nwith horses, asses, and mules, dark-coloured stripes suddenly reappear\r\non the legs, and shoulders, after an interval of hundreds, or more\r\nprobably of thousands of generations.\r\n\r\nThese various cases of reversion are so closely related to those of\r\nrudimentary organs given in the first chapter, that many of them might\r\nhave been indifferently introduced either there or here. Thus a human\r\nuterus furnished with cornua may be said to represent, in a rudimentary\r\ncondition, the same organ in its normal state in certain mammals. Some\r\nparts which are rudimentary in man, as the os coccyx in both sexes, and\r\nthe mammae in the male sex, are always present; whilst others, such as\r\nthe supracondyloid foramen, only occasionally appear, and therefore\r\nmight have been introduced under the head of reversion. These several\r\nreversionary structures, as well as the strictly rudimentary ones,\r\nreveal the descent of man from some lower form in an unmistakable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nCORRELATED VARIATION.\r\n\r\nIn man, as in the lower animals, many structures are so intimately\r\nrelated, that when one part varies so does another, without our being\r\nable, in most cases, to assign any reason. We cannot say whether the\r\none part governs the other, or whether both are governed by some\r\nearlier developed part. Various monstrosities, as I. Geoffroy\r\nrepeatedly insists, are thus intimately connected. Homologous\r\nstructures are particularly liable to change together, as we see on the\r\nopposite sides of the body, and in the upper and lower extremities.\r\nMeckel long ago remarked, that when the muscles of the arm depart from\r\ntheir proper type, they almost always imitate those of the leg; and so,\r\nconversely, with the muscles of the legs. The organs of sight and\r\nhearing, the teeth and hair, the colour of the skin and of the hair,\r\ncolour and constitution, are more or less correlated. (55. The\r\nauthorities for these several statements are given in my ‘Variation of\r\nAnimals under Domestication,’ vol. ii. pp. 320-335.) Professor\r\nSchaaffhausen first drew attention to the relation apparently existing\r\nbetween a muscular frame and the strongly-pronounced supra-orbital\r\nridges, which are so characteristic of the lower races of man.\r\n\r\nBesides the variations which can be grouped with more or less\r\nprobability under the foregoing heads, there is a large class of\r\nvariations which may be provisionally called spontaneous, for to our\r\nignorance they appear to arise without any exciting cause. It can,\r\nhowever, be shewn that such variations, whether consisting of slight\r\nindividual differences, or of strongly-marked and abrupt deviations of\r\nstructure, depend much more on the constitution of the organism than on\r\nthe nature of the conditions to which it has been subjected. (56. This\r\nwhole subject has been discussed in chap. xxiii. vol. ii. of my\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication.’)\r\n\r\nRATE OF INCREASE.\r\n\r\nCivilised populations have been known under favourable conditions, as\r\nin the United States, to double their numbers in twenty-five years;\r\nand, according to a calculation, by Euler, this might occur in a little\r\nover twelve years. (57. See the ever memorable ‘Essay on the Principle\r\nof Population,’ by the Rev. T. Malthus, vol. i. 1826. pp. 6, 517.) At\r\nthe former rate, the present population of the United States (thirty\r\nmillions), would in 657 years cover the whole terraqueous globe so\r\nthickly, that four men would have to stand on each square yard of\r\nsurface. The primary or fundamental check to the continued increase of\r\nman is the difficulty of gaining subsistence, and of living in comfort.\r\nWe may infer that this is the case from what we see, for instance, in\r\nthe United States, where subsistence is easy, and there is plenty of\r\nroom. If such means were suddenly doubled in Great Britain, our number\r\nwould be quickly doubled. With civilised nations this primary check\r\nacts chiefly by restraining marriages. The greater death-rate of\r\ninfants in the poorest classes is also very important; as well as the\r\ngreater mortality, from various diseases, of the inhabitants of crowded\r\nand miserable houses, at all ages. The effects of severe epidemics and\r\nwars are soon counterbalanced, and more than counterbalanced, in\r\nnations placed under favourable conditions. Emigration also comes in\r\naid as a temporary check, but, with the extremely poor classes, not to\r\nany great extent.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect, as Malthus has remarked, that the\r\nreproductive power is actually less in barbarous, than in civilised\r\nraces. We know nothing positively on this head, for with savages no\r\ncensus has been taken; but from the concurrent testimony of\r\nmissionaries, and of others who have long resided with such people, it\r\nappears that their families are usually small, and large ones rare.\r\nThis may be partly accounted for, as it is believed, by the women\r\nsuckling their infants during a long time; but it is highly probable\r\nthat savages, who often suffer much hardship, and who do not obtain so\r\nmuch nutritious food as civilised men, would be actually less prolific.\r\nI have shewn in a former work (58. ‘Variation of Animals and Plants\r\nunder Domestication,’ vol ii. pp. 111-113, 163.), that all our\r\ndomesticated quadrupeds and birds, and all our cultivated plants, are\r\nmore fertile than the corresponding species in a state of nature. It is\r\nno valid objection to this conclusion that animals suddenly supplied\r\nwith an excess of food, or when grown very fat; and that most plants on\r\nsudden removal from very poor to very rich soil, are rendered more or\r\nless sterile. We might, therefore, expect that civilised men, who in\r\none sense are highly domesticated, would be more prolific than wild\r\nmen. It is also probable that the increased fertility of civilised\r\nnations would become, as with our domestic animals, an inherited\r\ncharacter: it is at least known that with mankind a tendency to produce\r\ntwins runs in families. (59. Mr. Sedgwick, ‘British and Foreign\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Review,’ July 1863, p. 170.)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that savages appear to be less prolific than civilised\r\npeople, they would no doubt rapidly increase if their numbers were not\r\nby some means rigidly kept down. The Santali, or hill-tribes of India,\r\nhave recently afforded a good illustration of this fact; for, as shewn\r\nby Mr. Hunter (60. ‘The Annals of Rural Bengal,’ by W.W. Hunter, 1868,\r\np. 259.), they have increased at an extraordinary rate since\r\nvaccination has been introduced, other pestilences mitigated, and war\r\nsternly repressed. This increase, however, would not have been possible\r\nhad not these rude people spread into the adjoining districts, and\r\nworked for hire. Savages almost always marry; yet there is some\r\nprudential restraint, for they do not commonly marry at the earliest\r\npossible age. The young men are often required to shew that they can\r\nsupport a wife; and they generally have first to earn the price with\r\nwhich to purchase her from her parents. With savages the difficulty of\r\nobtaining subsistence occasionally limits their number in a much more\r\ndirect manner than with civilised people, for all tribes periodically\r\nsuffer from severe famines. At such times savages are forced to devour\r\nmuch bad food, and their health can hardly fail to be injured. Many\r\naccounts have been published of their protruding stomachs and emaciated\r\nlimbs after and during famines. They are then, also, compelled to\r\nwander much, and, as I was assured in Australia, their infants perish\r\nin large numbers. As famines are periodical, depending chiefly on\r\nextreme seasons, all tribes must fluctuate in number. They cannot\r\nsteadily and regularly increase, as there is no artificial increase in\r\nthe supply of food. Savages, when hard pressed, encroach on each\r\nother’s territories, and war is the result; but they are indeed almost\r\nalways at war with their neighbours. They are liable to many accidents\r\non land and water in their search for food; and in some countries they\r\nsuffer much from the larger beasts of prey. Even in India, districts\r\nhave been depopulated by the ravages of tigers.\r\n\r\nMalthus has discussed these several checks, but he does not lay stress\r\nenough on what is probably the most important of all, namely\r\ninfanticide, especially of female infants, and the habit of procuring\r\nabortion. These practices now prevail in many quarters of the world;\r\nand infanticide seems formerly to have prevailed, as Mr. M’Lennan (61.\r\n‘Primitive Marriage,’ 1865.) has shewn, on a still more extensive\r\nscale. These practices appear to have originated in savages recognising\r\nthe difficulty, or rather the impossibility of supporting all the\r\ninfants that are born. Licentiousness may also be added to the\r\nforegoing checks; but this does not follow from failing means of\r\nsubsistence; though there is reason to believe that in some cases (as\r\nin Japan) it has been intentionally encouraged as a means of keeping\r\ndown the population.\r\n\r\nIf we look back to an extremely remote epoch, before man had arrived at\r\nthe dignity of manhood, he would have been guided more by instinct and\r\nless by reason than are the lowest savages at the present time. Our\r\nearly semi-human progenitors would not have practised infanticide or\r\npolyandry; for the instincts of the lower animals are never so\r\nperverted (62. A writer in the ‘Spectator’ (March 12, 1871, p. 320)\r\ncomments as follows on this passage:—“Mr. Darwin finds himself\r\ncompelled to reintroduce a new doctrine of the fall of man. He shews\r\nthat the instincts of the higher animals are far nobler than the habits\r\nof savage races of men, and he finds himself, therefore, compelled to\r\nre-introduce,—in a form of the substantial orthodoxy of which he\r\nappears to be quite unconscious,—and to introduce as a scientific\r\nhypothesis the doctrine that man’s gain of KNOWLEDGE was the cause of a\r\ntemporary but long-enduring moral deterioration as indicated by the\r\nmany foul customs, especially as to marriage, of savage tribes. What\r\ndoes the Jewish tradition of the moral degeneration of man through his\r\nsnatching at a knowledge forbidden him by his highest instinct assert\r\nbeyond this?”) as to lead them regularly to destroy their own\r\noffspring, or to be quite devoid of jealousy. There would have been no\r\nprudential restraint from marriage, and the sexes would have freely\r\nunited at an early age. Hence the progenitors of man would have tended\r\nto increase rapidly; but checks of some kind, either periodical or\r\nconstant, must have kept down their numbers, even more severely than\r\nwith existing savages. What the precise nature of these checks were, we\r\ncannot say, any more than with most other animals. We know that horses\r\nand cattle, which are not extremely prolific animals, when first turned\r\nloose in South America, increased at an enormous rate. The elephant,\r\nthe slowest breeder of all known animals, would in a few thousand years\r\nstock the whole world. The increase of every species of monkey must be\r\nchecked by some means; but not, as Brehm remarks, by the attacks of\r\nbeasts of prey. No one will assume that the actual power of\r\nreproduction in the wild horses and cattle of America, was at first in\r\nany sensible degree increased; or that, as each district became fully\r\nstocked, this same power was diminished. No doubt, in this case, and in\r\nall others, many checks concur, and different checks under different\r\ncircumstances; periodical dearths, depending on unfavourable seasons,\r\nbeing probably the most important of all. So it will have been with the\r\nearly progenitors of man.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that man is variable in body and mind; and that the\r\nvariations are induced, either directly or indirectly, by the same\r\ngeneral causes, and obey the same general laws, as with the lower\r\nanimals. Man has spread widely over the face of the earth, and must\r\nhave been exposed, during his incessant migrations (63. See some good\r\nremarks to this effect by W. Stanley Jevons, “A Deduction from Darwin’s\r\nTheory,” ‘Nature,’ 1869, p. 231.), to the most diversified conditions.\r\nThe inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nTasmania in the one hemisphere, and of the arctic regions in the other,\r\nmust have passed through many climates, and changed their habits many\r\ntimes, before they reached their present homes. (64. Latham, ‘Man and\r\nhis Migrations,’ 1851, p. 135.) The early progenitors of man must also\r\nhave tended, like all other animals, to have increased beyond their\r\nmeans of subsistence; they must, therefore, occasionally have been\r\nexposed to a struggle for existence, and consequently to the rigid law\r\nof natural selection. Beneficial variations of all kinds will thus,\r\neither occasionally or habitually, have been preserved and injurious\r\nones eliminated. I do not refer to strongly-marked deviations of\r\nstructure, which occur only at long intervals of time, but to mere\r\nindividual differences. We know, for instance, that the muscles of our\r\nhands and feet, which determine our powers of movement, are liable,\r\nlike those of the lower animals, (65. Messrs. Murie and Mivart in their\r\n‘Anatomy of the Lemuroidea’ (‘Transact. Zoolog. Soc.’ vol. vii. 1869,\r\npp. 96-98) say, “some muscles are so irregular in their distribution\r\nthat they cannot be well classed in any of the above groups.” These\r\nmuscles differ even on the opposite sides of the same individual.) to\r\nincessant variability. If then the progenitors of man inhabiting any\r\ndistrict, especially one undergoing some change in its conditions, were\r\ndivided into two equal bodies, the one half which included all the\r\nindividuals best adapted by their powers of movement for gaining\r\nsubsistence, or for defending themselves, would on an average survive\r\nin greater numbers, and procreate more offspring than the other and\r\nless well endowed half.\r\n\r\nMan in the rudest state in which he now exists is the most dominant\r\nanimal that has ever appeared on this earth. He has spread more widely\r\nthan any other highly organised form: and all others have yielded\r\nbefore him. He manifestly owes this immense superiority to his\r\nintellectual faculties, to his social habits, which lead him to aid and\r\ndefend his fellows, and to his corporeal structure. The supreme\r\nimportance of these characters has been proved by the final arbitrament\r\nof the battle for life. Through his powers of intellect, articulate\r\nlanguage has been evolved; and on this his wonderful advancement has\r\nmainly depended. As Mr. Chauncey Wright remarks (66. Limits of Natural\r\nSelection, ‘North American Review,’ Oct. 1870, p. 295.): “a\r\npsychological analysis of the faculty of language shews, that even the\r\nsmallest proficiency in it might require more brain power than the\r\ngreatest proficiency in any other direction.” He has invented and is\r\nable to use various weapons, tools, traps, etc., with which he defends\r\nhimself, kills or catches prey, and otherwise obtains food. He has made\r\nrafts or canoes for fishing or crossing over to neighbouring fertile\r\nislands. He has discovered the art of making fire, by which hard and\r\nstringy roots can be rendered digestible, and poisonous roots or herbs\r\ninnocuous. This discovery of fire, probably the greatest ever made by\r\nman, excepting language, dates from before the dawn of history. These\r\nseveral inventions, by which man in the rudest state has become so\r\npre-eminent, are the direct results of the development of his powers of\r\nobservation, memory, curiosity, imagination, and reason. I cannot,\r\ntherefore, understand how it is that Mr. Wallace (67. ‘Quarterly\r\nReview,’ April 1869, p. 392. This subject is more fully discussed in\r\nMr. Wallace’s ‘Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,’ 1870,\r\nin which all the essays referred to in this work are re-published. The\r\n‘Essay on Man,’ has been ably criticised by Prof. Claparede, one of the\r\nmost distinguished zoologists in Europe, in an article published in the\r\n‘Bibliotheque Universelle,’ June 1870. The remark quoted in my text\r\nwill surprise every one who has read Mr. Wallace’s celebrated paper on\r\n‘The Origin of Human Races Deduced from the Theory of Natural\r\nSelection,’ originally published in the ‘Anthropological Review,’ May\r\n1864, p. clviii. I cannot here resist quoting a most just remark by Sir\r\nJ. Lubbock (‘Prehistoric Times,’ 1865, p. 479) in reference to this\r\npaper, namely, that Mr. Wallace, “with characteristic unselfishness,\r\nascribes it (i.e. the idea of natural selection) unreservedly to Mr.\r\nDarwin, although, as is well known, he struck out the idea\r\nindependently, and published it, though not with the same elaboration,\r\nat the same time.”) maintains, that “natural selection could only have\r\nendowed the savage with a brain a little superior to that of an ape.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the intellectual powers and social habits of man are of\r\nparamount importance to him, we must not underrate the importance of\r\nhis bodily structure, to which subject the remainder of this chapter\r\nwill be devoted; the development of the intellectual and social or\r\nmoral faculties being discussed in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nEven to hammer with precision is no easy matter, as every one who has\r\ntried to learn carpentry will admit. To throw a stone with as true an\r\naim as a Fuegian in defending himself, or in killing birds, requires\r\nthe most consummate perfection in the correlated action of the muscles\r\nof the hand, arm, and shoulder, and, further, a fine sense of touch. In\r\nthrowing a stone or spear, and in many other actions, a man must stand\r\nfirmly on his feet; and this again demands the perfect co-adaptation of\r\nnumerous muscles. To chip a flint into the rudest tool, or to form a\r\nbarbed spear or hook from a bone, demands the use of a perfect hand;\r\nfor, as a most capable judge, Mr. Schoolcraft (68. Quoted by Mr. Lawson\r\nTait in his ‘Law of Natural Selection,’ ‘Dublin Quarterly Journal of\r\nMedical Science,’ Feb. 1869. Dr. Keller is likewise quoted to the same\r\neffect.), remarks, the shaping fragments of stone into knives, lances,\r\nor arrow-heads, shews “extraordinary ability and long practice.” This\r\nis to a great extent proved by the fact that primeval men practised a\r\ndivision of labour; each man did not manufacture his own flint tools or\r\nrude pottery, but certain individuals appear to have devoted themselves\r\nto such work, no doubt receiving in exchange the produce of the chase.\r\nArchaeologists are convinced that an enormous interval of time elapsed\r\nbefore our ancestors thought of grinding chipped flints into smooth\r\ntools. One can hardly doubt, that a man-like animal who possessed a\r\nhand and arm sufficiently perfect to throw a stone with precision, or\r\nto form a flint into a rude tool, could, with sufficient practice, as\r\nfar as mechanical skill alone is concerned, make almost anything which\r\na civilised man can make. The structure of the hand in this respect may\r\nbe compared with that of the vocal organs, which in the apes are used\r\nfor uttering various signal-cries, or, as in one genus, musical\r\ncadences; but in man the closely similar vocal organs have become\r\nadapted through the inherited effects of use for the utterance of\r\narticulate language.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the nearest allies of men, and therefore to the best\r\nrepresentatives of our early progenitors, we find that the hands of the\r\nQuadrumana are constructed on the same general pattern as our own, but\r\nare far less perfectly adapted for diversified uses. Their hands do not\r\nserve for locomotion so well as the feet of a dog; as may be seen in\r\nsuch monkeys as the chimpanzee and orang, which walk on the outer\r\nmargins of the palms, or on the knuckles. (69. Owen, ‘Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 71.) Their hands, however, are admirably\r\nadapted for climbing trees. Monkeys seize thin branches or ropes, with\r\nthe thumb on one side and the fingers and palm on the other, in the\r\nsame manner as we do. They can thus also lift rather large objects,\r\nsuch as the neck of a bottle, to their mouths. Baboons turn over\r\nstones, and scratch up roots with their hands. They seize nuts,\r\ninsects, or other small objects with the thumb in opposition to the\r\nfingers, and no doubt they thus extract eggs and young from the nests\r\nof birds. American monkeys beat the wild oranges on the branches until\r\nthe rind is cracked, and then tear it off with the fingers of the two\r\nhands. In a wild state they break open hard fruits with stones. Other\r\nmonkeys open mussel-shells with the two thumbs. With their fingers they\r\npull out thorns and burs, and hunt for each other’s parasites. They\r\nroll down stones, or throw them at their enemies: nevertheless, they\r\nare clumsy in these various actions, and, as I have myself seen, are\r\nquite unable to throw a stone with precision.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me far from true that because “objects are grasped\r\nclumsily” by monkeys, “a much less specialised organ of prehension”\r\nwould have served them (70. ‘Quarterly Review,’ April 1869, p. 392.)\r\nequally well with their present hands. On the contrary, I see no reason\r\nto doubt that more perfectly constructed hands would have been an\r\nadvantage to them, provided that they were not thus rendered less\r\nfitted for climbing trees. We may suspect that a hand as perfect as\r\nthat of man would have been disadvantageous for climbing; for the most\r\narboreal monkeys in the world, namely, Ateles in America, Colobus in\r\nAfrica, and Hylobates in Asia, are either thumbless, or their toes\r\npartially cohere, so that their limbs are converted into mere grasping\r\nhooks. (71. In Hylobates syndactylus, as the name expresses, two of the\r\ntoes regularly cohere; and this, as Mr. Blyth informs me, is\r\noccasionally the case with the toes of H. agilis, lar, and leuciscus.\r\nColobus is strictly arboreal and extraordinarily active (Brehm,\r\n‘Thierleben,’ B. i. s. 50), but whether a better climber than the\r\nspecies of the allied genera, I do not know. It deserves notice that\r\nthe feet of the sloths, the most arboreal animals in the world, are\r\nwonderfully hook-like.\r\n\r\nAs soon as some ancient member in the great series of the Primates came\r\nto be less arboreal, owing to a change in its manner of procuring\r\nsubsistence, or to some change in the surrounding conditions, its\r\nhabitual manner of progression would have been modified: and thus it\r\nwould have been rendered more strictly quadrupedal or bipedal. Baboons\r\nfrequent hilly and rocky districts, and only from necessity climb high\r\ntrees (72. Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. i. s. 80.); and they have acquired\r\nalmost the gait of a dog. Man alone has become a biped; and we can, I\r\nthink, partly see how he has come to assume his erect attitude, which\r\nforms one of his most conspicuous characters. Man could not have\r\nattained his present dominant position in the world without the use of\r\nhis hands, which are so admirably adapted to act in obedience to his\r\nwill. Sir C. Bell (73. ‘The Hand,’ etc., ‘Bridgewater Treatise,’ 1833,\r\np. 38.) insists that “the hand supplies all instruments, and by its\r\ncorrespondence with the intellect gives him universal dominion.” But\r\nthe hands and arms could hardly have become perfect enough to have\r\nmanufactured weapons, or to have hurled stones and spears with a true\r\naim, as long as they were habitually used for locomotion and for\r\nsupporting the whole weight of the body, or, as before remarked, so\r\nlong as they were especially fitted for climbing trees. Such rough\r\ntreatment would also have blunted the sense of touch, on which their\r\ndelicate use largely depends. From these causes alone it would have\r\nbeen an advantage to man to become a biped; but for many actions it is\r\nindispensable that the arms and whole upper part of the body should be\r\nfree; and he must for this end stand firmly on his feet. To gain this\r\ngreat advantage, the feet have been rendered flat; and the great toe\r\nhas been peculiarly modified, though this has entailed the almost\r\ncomplete loss of its power of prehension. It accords with the principle\r\nof the division of physiological labour, prevailing throughout the\r\nanimal kingdom, that as the hands became perfected for prehension, the\r\nfeet should have become perfected for support and locomotion. With some\r\nsavages, however, the foot has not altogether lost its prehensile\r\npower, as shewn by their manner of climbing trees, and of using them in\r\nother ways. (74. Haeckel has an excellent discussion on the steps by\r\nwhich man became a biped: ‘Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte,’ 1868, s.\r\n507. Dr. Buchner (‘Conférences sur la Théorie Darwinienne,’ 1869, p.\r\n135) has given good cases of the use of the foot as a prehensile organ\r\nby man; and has also written on the manner of progression of the higher\r\napes, to which I allude in the following paragraph: see also Owen\r\n(‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 71) on this latter subject.)\r\n\r\nIf it be an advantage to man to stand firmly on his feet and to have\r\nhis hands and arms free, of which, from his pre-eminent success in the\r\nbattle of life there can be no doubt, then I can see no reason why it\r\nshould not have been advantageous to the progenitors of man to have\r\nbecome more and more erect or bipedal. They would thus have been better\r\nable to defend themselves with stones or clubs, to attack their prey,\r\nor otherwise to obtain food. The best built individuals would in the\r\nlong run have succeeded best, and have survived in larger numbers. If\r\nthe gorilla and a few allied forms had become extinct, it might have\r\nbeen argued, with great force and apparent truth, that an animal could\r\nnot have been gradually converted from a quadruped into a biped, as all\r\nthe individuals in an intermediate condition would have been miserably\r\nill-fitted for progression. But we know (and this is well worthy of\r\nreflection) that the anthropomorphous apes are now actually in an\r\nintermediate condition; and no one doubts that they are on the whole\r\nwell adapted for their conditions of life. Thus the gorilla runs with a\r\nsidelong shambling gait, but more commonly progresses by resting on its\r\nbent hands. The long-armed apes occasionally use their arms like\r\ncrutches, swinging their bodies forward between them, and some kinds of\r\nHylobates, without having been taught, can walk or run upright with\r\ntolerable quickness; yet they move awkwardly, and much less securely\r\nthan man. We see, in short, in existing monkeys a manner of progression\r\nintermediate between that of a quadruped and a biped; but, as an\r\nunprejudiced judge (75. Prof. Broca, La Constitution des Vertèbres\r\ncaudales; ‘La Revue d’Anthropologie,’ 1872, p. 26, (separate copy).)\r\ninsists, the anthropomorphous apes approach in structure more nearly to\r\nthe bipedal than to the quadrupedal type.\r\n\r\nAs the progenitors of man became more and more erect, with their hands\r\nand arms more and more modified for prehension and other purposes, with\r\ntheir feet and legs at the same time transformed for firm support and\r\nprogression, endless other changes of structure would have become\r\nnecessary. The pelvis would have to be broadened, the spine peculiarly\r\ncurved, and the head fixed in an altered position, all which changes\r\nhave been attained by man. Prof. Schaaffhausen (76. ‘On the Primitive\r\nForm of the Skull,’ translated in ‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct. 1868,\r\np. 428. Owen (‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. ii. 1866, p. 551) on the\r\nmastoid processes in the higher apes.) maintains that “the powerful\r\nmastoid processes of the human skull are the result of his erect\r\nposition;” and these processes are absent in the orang, chimpanzee,\r\netc., and are smaller in the gorilla than in man. Various other\r\nstructures, which appear connected with man’s erect position, might\r\nhere have been added. It is very difficult to decide how far these\r\ncorrelated modifications are the result of natural selection, and how\r\nfar of the inherited effects of the increased use of certain parts, or\r\nof the action of one part on another. No doubt these means of change\r\noften co-operate: thus when certain muscles, and the crests of bone to\r\nwhich they are attached, become enlarged by habitual use, this shews\r\nthat certain actions are habitually performed and must be serviceable.\r\nHence the individuals which performed them best, would tend to survive\r\nin greater numbers.\r\n\r\nThe free use of the arms and hands, partly the cause and partly the\r\nresult of man’s erect position, appears to have led in an indirect\r\nmanner to other modifications of structure. The early male forefathers\r\nof man were, as previously stated, probably furnished with great canine\r\nteeth; but as they gradually acquired the habit of using stones, clubs,\r\nor other weapons, for fighting with their enemies or rivals, they would\r\nuse their jaws and teeth less and less. In this case, the jaws,\r\ntogether with the teeth, would become reduced in size, as we may feel\r\nalmost sure from innumerable analogous cases. In a future chapter we\r\nshall meet with a closely parallel case, in the reduction or complete\r\ndisappearance of the canine teeth in male ruminants, apparently in\r\nrelation with the development of their horns; and in horses, in\r\nrelation to their habit of fighting with their incisor teeth and hoofs.\r\n\r\nIn the adult male anthropomorphous apes, as Rutimeyer (77. ‘Die Grenzen\r\nder Thierwelt, eine Betrachtung zu Darwin’s Lehre,’ 1868, s. 51.), and\r\nothers, have insisted, it is the effect on the skull of the great\r\ndevelopment of the jaw-muscles that causes it to differ so greatly in\r\nmany respects from that of man, and has given to these animals “a truly\r\nfrightful physiognomy.” Therefore, as the jaws and teeth in man’s\r\nprogenitors gradually become reduced in size, the adult skull would\r\nhave come to resemble more and more that of existing man. As we shall\r\nhereafter see, a great reduction of the canine teeth in the males would\r\nalmost certainly affect the teeth of the females through inheritance.\r\n\r\nAs the various mental faculties gradually developed themselves the\r\nbrain would almost certainly become larger. No one, I presume, doubts\r\nthat the large proportion which the size of man’s brain bears to his\r\nbody, compared to the same proportion in the gorilla or orang, is\r\nclosely connected with his higher mental powers. We meet with closely\r\nanalogous facts with insects, for in ants the cerebral ganglia are of\r\nextraordinary dimensions, and in all the Hymenoptera these ganglia are\r\nmany times larger than in the less intelligent orders, such as beetles.\r\n(78. Dujardin, ‘Annales des Sciences Nat.’ 3rd series, Zoolog., tom.\r\nxiv. 1850, p. 203. See also Mr. Lowne, ‘Anatomy and Phys. of the Musca\r\nvomitoria,’ 1870, p. 14. My son, Mr. F. Darwin, dissected for me the\r\ncerebral ganglia of the Formica rufa.) On the other hand, no one\r\nsupposes that the intellect of any two animals or of any two men can be\r\naccurately gauged by the cubic contents of their skulls. It is certain\r\nthat there may be extraordinary mental activity with an extremely small\r\nabsolute mass of nervous matter: thus the wonderfully diversified\r\ninstincts, mental powers, and affections of ants are notorious, yet\r\ntheir cerebral ganglia are not so large as the quarter of a small pin’s\r\nhead. Under this point of view, the brain of an ant is one of the most\r\nmarvellous atoms of matter in the world, perhaps more so than the brain\r\nof a man.\r\n\r\nThe belief that there exists in man some close relation between the\r\nsize of the brain and the development of the intellectual faculties is\r\nsupported by the comparison of the skulls of savage and civilised\r\nraces, of ancient and modern people, and by the analogy of the whole\r\nvertebrate series. Dr. J. Barnard Davis has proved (79. ‘Philosophical\r\nTransactions,’ 1869, p. 513.), by many careful measurements, that the\r\nmean internal capacity of the skull in Europeans is 92.3 cubic inches;\r\nin Americans 87.5; in Asiatics 87.1; and in Australians only 81.9 cubic\r\ninches. Professor Broca (80. ‘Les Selections,’ M. P. Broca, ‘Revue\r\nd’Anthropologies,’ 1873; see also, as quoted in C. Vogt’s ‘Lectures on\r\nMan,’ Engl. translat., 1864, pp. 88, 90. Prichard, ‘Physical History of\r\nMankind,’ vol. i. 1838, p. 305.) found that the nineteenth century\r\nskulls from graves in Paris were larger than those from vaults of the\r\ntwelfth century, in the proportion of 1484 to 1426; and that the\r\nincreased size, as ascertained by measurements, was exclusively in the\r\nfrontal part of the skull—the seat of the intellectual faculties.\r\nPrichard is persuaded that the present inhabitants of Britain have\r\n“much more capacious brain-cases” than the ancient inhabitants.\r\nNevertheless, it must be admitted that some skulls of very high\r\nantiquity, such as the famous one of Neanderthal, are well developed\r\nand capacious. (81. In the interesting article just referred to, Prof.\r\nBroca has well remarked, that in civilised nations, the average\r\ncapacity of the skull must be lowered by the preservation of a\r\nconsiderable number of individuals, weak in mind and body, who would\r\nhave been promptly eliminated in the savage state. On the other hand,\r\nwith savages, the average includes only the more capable individuals,\r\nwho have been able to survive under extremely hard conditions of life.\r\nBroca thus explains the otherwise inexplicable fact, that the mean\r\ncapacity of the skull of the ancient Troglodytes of Lozere is greater\r\nthan that of modern Frenchmen.) With respect to the lower animals, M.E.\r\nLartet (82. ‘Comptes-rendus des Sciences,’ etc., June 1, 1868.), by\r\ncomparing the crania of tertiary and recent mammals belonging to the\r\nsame groups, has come to the remarkable conclusion that the brain is\r\ngenerally larger and the convolutions are more complex in the more\r\nrecent forms. On the other hand, I have shewn (83. The ‘Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. i. pp. 124-129.) that the\r\nbrains of domestic rabbits are considerably reduced in bulk, in\r\ncomparison with those of the wild rabbit or hare; and this may be\r\nattributed to their having been closely confined during many\r\ngenerations, so that they have exerted their intellect, instincts,\r\nsenses and voluntary movements but little.\r\n\r\nThe gradually increasing weight of the brain and skull in man must have\r\ninfluenced the development of the supporting spinal column, more\r\nespecially whilst he was becoming erect. As this change of position was\r\nbeing brought about, the internal pressure of the brain will also have\r\ninfluenced the form of the skull; for many facts shew how easily the\r\nskull is thus affected. Ethnologists believe that it is modified by the\r\nkind of cradle in which infants sleep. Habitual spasms of the muscles,\r\nand a cicatrix from a severe burn, have permanently modified the facial\r\nbones. In young persons whose heads have become fixed either sideways\r\nor backwards, owing to disease, one of the two eyes has changed its\r\nposition, and the shape of the skull has been altered apparently by the\r\npressure of the brain in a new direction. (84. Schaaffhausen gives from\r\nBlumenbach and Busch, the cases of the spasms and cicatrix, in\r\n‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct. 1868, p. 420. Dr. Jarrold\r\n(‘Anthropologia,’ 1808, pp. 115, 116) adduces from Camper and from his\r\nown observations, cases of the modification of the skull from the head\r\nbeing fixed in an unnatural position. He believes that in certain\r\ntrades, such as that of a shoemaker, where the head is habitually held\r\nforward, the forehead becomes more rounded and prominent.) I have shewn\r\nthat with long-eared rabbits even so trifling a cause as the lopping\r\nforward of one ear drags forward almost every bone of the skull on that\r\nside; so that the bones on the opposite side no longer strictly\r\ncorrespond. Lastly, if any animal were to increase or diminish much in\r\ngeneral size, without any change in its mental powers, or if the mental\r\npowers were to be much increased or diminished, without any great\r\nchange in the size of the body, the shape of the skull would almost\r\ncertainly be altered. I infer this from my observations on domestic\r\nrabbits, some kinds of which have become very much larger than the wild\r\nanimal, whilst others have retained nearly the same size, but in both\r\ncases the brain has been much reduced relatively to the size of the\r\nbody. Now I was at first much surprised on finding that in all these\r\nrabbits the skull had become elongated or dolichocephalic; for\r\ninstance, of two skulls of nearly equal breadth, the one from a wild\r\nrabbit and the other from a large domestic kind, the former was 3.15\r\nand the latter 4.3 inches in length. (85. ‘Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants under Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 117, on the elongation of the\r\nskull; p. 119, on the effect of the lopping of one ear.) One of the\r\nmost marked distinctions in different races of men is that the skull in\r\nsome is elongated, and in others rounded; and here the explanation\r\nsuggested by the case of the rabbits may hold good; for Welcker finds\r\nthat short “men incline more to brachycephaly, and tall men to\r\ndolichocephaly” (86. Quoted by Schaaffhausen, in ‘Anthropological\r\nReview,’ Oct. 1868, p. 419.); and tall men may be compared with the\r\nlarger and longer-bodied rabbits, all of which have elongated skulls or\r\nare dolichocephalic.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts we can understand, to a certain extent, the\r\nmeans by which the great size and more or less rounded form of the\r\nskull have been acquired by man; and these are characters eminently\r\ndistinctive of him in comparison with the lower animals.\r\n\r\nAnother most conspicuous difference between man and the lower animals\r\nis the nakedness of his skin. Whales and porpoises (Cetacea), dugongs\r\n(Sirenia) and the hippopotamus are naked; and this may be advantageous\r\nto them for gliding through the water; nor would it be injurious to\r\nthem from the loss of warmth, as the species, which inhabit the colder\r\nregions, are protected by a thick layer of blubber, serving the same\r\npurpose as the fur of seals and otters. Elephants and rhinoceroses are\r\nalmost hairless; and as certain extinct species, which formerly lived\r\nunder an Arctic climate, were covered with long wool or hair, it would\r\nalmost appear as if the existing species of both genera had lost their\r\nhairy covering from exposure to heat. This appears the more probable,\r\nas the elephants in India which live on elevated and cool districts are\r\nmore hairy (87. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 619.) than\r\nthose on the lowlands. May we then infer that man became divested of\r\nhair from having aboriginally inhabited some tropical land? That the\r\nhair is chiefly retained in the male sex on the chest and face, and in\r\nboth sexes at the junction of all four limbs with the trunk, favours\r\nthis inference—on the assumption that the hair was lost before man\r\nbecame erect; for the parts which now retain most hair would then have\r\nbeen most protected from the heat of the sun. The crown of the head,\r\nhowever, offers a curious exception, for at all times it must have been\r\none of the most exposed parts, yet it is thickly clothed with hair. The\r\nfact, however, that the other members of the order of Primates, to\r\nwhich man belongs, although inhabiting various hot regions, are well\r\nclothed with hair, generally thickest on the upper surface (88. Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire remarks (‘Histoire Nat. Generale,’ tom. ii. 1859,\r\npp. 215-217) on the head of man being covered with long hair; also on\r\nthe upper surfaces of monkeys and of other mammals being more thickly\r\nclothed than the lower surfaces. This has likewise been observed by\r\nvarious authors. Prof. P. Gervais (‘Histoire Nat. des Mammifères,’ tom.\r\ni. 1854, p. 28), however, states that in the Gorilla the hair is\r\nthinner on the back, where it is partly rubbed off, than on the lower\r\nsurface.), is opposed to the supposition that man became naked through\r\nthe action of the sun. Mr. Belt believes (89. The ‘Naturalist in\r\nNicaragua,’ 1874, p. 209. As some confirmation of Mr. Belt’s view, I\r\nmay quote the following passage from Sir W. Denison (‘Varieties of\r\nVice-Regal Life,’ vol. i. 1870, p. 440): “It is said to be a practice\r\nwith the Australians, when the vermin get troublesome, to singe\r\nthemselves.”) that within the tropics it is an advantage to man to be\r\ndestitute of hair, as he is thus enabled to free himself of the\r\nmultitude of ticks (acari) and other parasites, with which he is often\r\ninfested, and which sometimes cause ulceration. But whether this evil\r\nis of sufficient magnitude to have led to the denudation of his body\r\nthrough natural selection, may be doubted, since none of the many\r\nquadrupeds inhabiting the tropics have, as far as I know, acquired any\r\nspecialised means of relief. The view which seems to me the most\r\nprobable is that man, or rather primarily woman, became divested of\r\nhair for ornamental purposes, as we shall see under Sexual Selection;\r\nand, according to this belief, it is not surprising that man should\r\ndiffer so greatly in hairiness from all other Primates, for characters,\r\ngained through sexual selection, often differ to an extraordinary\r\ndegree in closely related forms.\r\n\r\nAccording to a popular impression, the absence of a tail is eminently\r\ndistinctive of man; but as those apes which come nearest to him are\r\ndestitute of this organ, its disappearance does not relate exclusively\r\nto man. The tail often differs remarkably in length within the same\r\ngenus: thus in some species of Macacus it is longer than the whole\r\nbody, and is formed of twenty-four vertebrae; in others it consists of\r\na scarcely visible stump, containing only three or four vertebrae. In\r\nsome kinds of baboons there are twenty-five, whilst in the mandrill\r\nthere are ten very small stunted caudal vertebrae, or, according to\r\nCuvier (90. Mr. St. George Mivart, ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1865, pp. 562,\r\n583. Dr. J.E. Gray, ‘Cat. Brit. Mus.: ‘Skeletons.’ Owen, ‘Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. ii. p. 517. Isidore Geoffroy, ‘Hist. Nat. Gen.’ tom.\r\nii. p. 244.), sometimes only five. The tail, whether it be long or\r\nshort, almost always tapers towards the end; and this, I presume,\r\nresults from the atrophy of the terminal muscles, together with their\r\narteries and nerves, through disuse, leading to the atrophy of the\r\nterminal bones. But no explanation can at present be given of the great\r\ndiversity which often occurs in its length. Here, however, we are more\r\nspecially concerned with the complete external disappearance of the\r\ntail. Professor Broca has recently shewn (91. ‘Revue d’Anthropologie,’\r\n1872; ‘La Constitution des vertèbres caudales.’) that the tail in all\r\nquadrupeds consists of two portions, generally separated abruptly from\r\neach other; the basal portion consists of vertebrae, more or less\r\nperfectly channelled and furnished with apophyses like ordinary\r\nvertebrae; whereas those of the terminal portion are not channelled,\r\nare almost smooth, and scarcely resemble true vertebrae. A tail, though\r\nnot externally visible, is really present in man and the\r\nanthropomorphous apes, and is constructed on exactly the same pattern\r\nin both. In the terminal portion the vertebrae, constituting the os\r\ncoccyx, are quite rudimentary, being much reduced in size and number.\r\nIn the basal portion, the vertebrae are likewise few, are united firmly\r\ntogether, and are arrested in development; but they have been rendered\r\nmuch broader and flatter than the corresponding vertebrae in the tails\r\nof other animals: they constitute what Broca calls the accessory sacral\r\nvertebrae. These are of functional importance by supporting certain\r\ninternal parts and in other ways; and their modification is directly\r\nconnected with the erect or semi-erect attitude of man and the\r\nanthropomorphous apes. This conclusion is the more trustworthy, as\r\nBroca formerly held a different view, which he has now abandoned. The\r\nmodification, therefore, of the basal caudal vertebrae in man and the\r\nhigher apes may have been effected, directly or indirectly, through\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to say about the rudimentary and variable vertebrae of\r\nthe terminal portion of the tail, forming the os coccyx? A notion which\r\nhas often been, and will no doubt again be ridiculed, namely, that\r\nfriction has had something to do with the disappearance of the external\r\nportion of the tail, is not so ridiculous as it at first appears. Dr.\r\nAnderson (92. ‘Proceedings Zoological Society,’ 1872, p. 210.) states\r\nthat the extremely short tail of Macacus brunneus is formed of eleven\r\nvertebrae, including the imbedded basal ones. The extremity is\r\ntendinous and contains no vertebrae; this is succeeded by five\r\nrudimentary ones, so minute that together they are only one line and a\r\nhalf in length, and these are permanently bent to one side in the shape\r\nof a hook. The free part of the tail, only a little above an inch in\r\nlength, includes only four more small vertebrae. This short tail is\r\ncarried erect; but about a quarter of its total length is doubled on to\r\nitself to the left; and this terminal part, which includes the\r\nhook-like portion, serves “to fill up the interspace between the upper\r\ndivergent portion of the callosities;” so that the animal sits on it,\r\nand thus renders it rough and callous. Dr. Anderson thus sums up his\r\nobservations: “These facts seem to me to have only one explanation;\r\nthis tail, from its short size, is in the monkey’s way when it sits\r\ndown, and frequently becomes placed under the animal while it is in\r\nthis attitude; and from the circumstance that it does not extend beyond\r\nthe extremity of the ischial tuberosities, it seems as if the tail\r\noriginally had been bent round by the will of the animal, into the\r\ninterspace between the callosities, to escape being pressed between\r\nthem and the ground, and that in time the curvature became permanent,\r\nfitting in of itself when the organ happens to be sat upon.” Under\r\nthese circumstances it is not surprising that the surface of the tail\r\nshould have been roughened and rendered callous, and Dr. Murie (93.\r\n‘Proceedings Zoological Society,’ 1872, p. 786.), who carefully\r\nobserved this species in the Zoological Gardens, as well as three other\r\nclosely allied forms with slightly longer tails, says that when the\r\nanimal sits down, the tail “is necessarily thrust to one side of the\r\nbuttocks; and whether long or short its root is consequently liable to\r\nbe rubbed or chafed.” As we now have evidence that mutilations\r\noccasionally produce an inherited effect (94. I allude to Dr.\r\nBrown-Sequard’s observations on the transmitted effect of an operation\r\ncausing epilepsy in guinea-pigs, and likewise more recently on the\r\nanalogous effects of cutting the sympathetic nerve in the neck. I shall\r\nhereafter have occasion to refer to Mr. Salvin’s interesting case of\r\nthe apparently inherited effects of mot-mots biting off the barbs of\r\ntheir own tail-feathers. See also on the general subject ‘Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. pp. 22-24.), it is\r\nnot very improbable that in short-tailed monkeys, the projecting part\r\nof the tail, being functionally useless, should after many generations\r\nhave become rudimentary and distorted, from being continually rubbed\r\nand chafed. We see the projecting part in this condition in the Macacus\r\nbrunneus, and absolutely aborted in the M. ecaudatus and in several of\r\nthe higher apes. Finally, then, as far as we can judge, the tail has\r\ndisappeared in man and the anthropomorphous apes, owing to the terminal\r\nportion having been injured by friction during a long lapse of time;\r\nthe basal and embedded portion having been reduced and modified, so as\r\nto become suitable to the erect or semi-erect position.\r\n\r\nI have now endeavoured to shew that some of the most distinctive\r\ncharacters of man have in all probability been acquired, either\r\ndirectly, or more commonly indirectly, through natural selection. We\r\nshould bear in mind that modifications in structure or constitution\r\nwhich do not serve to adapt an organism to its habits of life, to the\r\nfood which it consumes, or passively to the surrounding conditions,\r\ncannot have been thus acquired. We must not, however, be too confident\r\nin deciding what modifications are of service to each being: we should\r\nremember how little we know about the use of many parts, or what\r\nchanges in the blood or tissues may serve to fit an organism for a new\r\nclimate or new kinds of food. Nor must we forget the principle of\r\ncorrelation, by which, as Isidore Geoffroy has shewn in the case of\r\nman, many strange deviations of structure are tied together.\r\nIndependently of correlation, a change in one part often leads, through\r\nthe increased or decreased use of other parts, to other changes of a\r\nquite unexpected nature. It is also well to reflect on such facts, as\r\nthe wonderful growth of galls on plants caused by the poison of an\r\ninsect, and on the remarkable changes of colour in the plumage of\r\nparrots when fed on certain fishes, or inoculated with the poison of\r\ntoads (95. The ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’\r\nvol. ii. pp. 280, 282.); for we can thus see that the fluids of the\r\nsystem, if altered for some special purpose, might induce other\r\nchanges. We should especially bear in mind that modifications acquired\r\nand continually used during past ages for some useful purpose, would\r\nprobably become firmly fixed, and might be long inherited.\r\n\r\nThus a large yet undefined extension may safely be given to the direct\r\nand indirect results of natural selection; but I now admit, after\r\nreading the essay by Nageli on plants, and the remarks by various\r\nauthors with respect to animals, more especially those recently made by\r\nProfessor Broca, that in the earlier editions of my ‘Origin of Species’\r\nI perhaps attributed too much to the action of natural selection or the\r\nsurvival of the fittest. I have altered the fifth edition of the\r\n‘Origin’ so as to confine my remarks to adaptive changes of structure;\r\nbut I am convinced, from the light gained during even the last few\r\nyears, that very many structures which now appear to us useless, will\r\nhereafter be proved to be useful, and will therefore come within the\r\nrange of natural selection. Nevertheless, I did not formerly consider\r\nsufficiently the existence of structures, which, as far as we can at\r\npresent judge, are neither beneficial nor injurious; and this I believe\r\nto be one of the greatest oversights as yet detected in my work. I may\r\nbe permitted to say, as some excuse, that I had two distinct objects in\r\nview; firstly, to shew that species had not been separately created,\r\nand secondly, that natural selection had been the chief agent of\r\nchange, though largely aided by the inherited effects of habit, and\r\nslightly by the direct action of the surrounding conditions. I was not,\r\nhowever, able to annul the influence of my former belief, then almost\r\nuniversal, that each species had been purposely created; and this led\r\nto my tacit assumption that every detail of structure, excepting\r\nrudiments, was of some special, though unrecognised, service. Any one\r\nwith this assumption in his mind would naturally extend too far the\r\naction of natural selection, either during past or present times. Some\r\nof those who admit the principle of evolution, but reject natural\r\nselection, seem to forget, when criticising my book, that I had the\r\nabove two objects in view; hence if I have erred in giving to natural\r\nselection great power, which I am very far from admitting, or in having\r\nexaggerated its power, which is in itself probable, I have at least, as\r\nI hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate\r\ncreations.\r\n\r\nIt is, as I can now see, probable that all organic beings, including\r\nman, possess peculiarities of structure, which neither are now, nor\r\nwere formerly of any service to them, and which, therefore, are of no\r\nphysiological importance. We know not what produces the numberless\r\nslight differences between the individuals of each species, for\r\nreversion only carries the problem a few steps backwards, but each\r\npeculiarity must have had its efficient cause. If these causes,\r\nwhatever they may be, were to act more uniformly and energetically\r\nduring a lengthened period (and against this no reason can be\r\nassigned), the result would probably be not a mere slight individual\r\ndifference, but a well-marked and constant modification, though one of\r\nno physiological importance. Changed structures, which are in no way\r\nbeneficial, cannot be kept uniform through natural selection, though\r\nthe injurious will be thus eliminated. Uniformity of character would,\r\nhowever, naturally follow from the assumed uniformity of the exciting\r\ncauses, and likewise from the free intercrossing of many individuals.\r\nDuring successive periods, the same organism might in this manner\r\nacquire successive modifications, which would be transmitted in a\r\nnearly uniform state as long as the exciting causes remained the same\r\nand there was free intercrossing. With respect to the exciting causes\r\nwe can only say, as when speaking of so-called spontaneous variations,\r\nthat they relate much more closely to the constitution of the varying\r\norganism, than to the nature of the conditions to which it has been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\n—CONCLUSION—\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have seen that as man at the present day is liable,\r\nlike every other animal, to multiform individual differences or slight\r\nvariations, so no doubt were the early progenitors of man; the\r\nvariations being formerly induced by the same general causes, and\r\ngoverned by the same general and complex laws as at present. As all\r\nanimals tend to multiply beyond their means of subsistence, so it must\r\nhave been with the progenitors of man; and this would inevitably lead\r\nto a struggle for existence and to natural selection. The latter\r\nprocess would be greatly aided by the inherited effects of the\r\nincreased use of parts, and these two processes would incessantly react\r\non each other. It appears, also, as we shall hereafter see, that\r\nvarious unimportant characters have been acquired by man through sexual\r\nselection. An unexplained residuum of change must be left to the\r\nassumed uniform action of those unknown agencies, which occasionally\r\ninduce strongly marked and abrupt deviations of structure in our\r\ndomestic productions.\r\n\r\nJudging from the habits of savages and of the greater number of the\r\nQuadrumana, primeval men, and even their ape-like progenitors, probably\r\nlived in society. With strictly social animals, natural selection\r\nsometimes acts on the individual, through the preservation of\r\nvariations which are beneficial to the community. A community which\r\nincludes a large number of well-endowed individuals increases in\r\nnumber, and is victorious over other less favoured ones; even although\r\neach separate member gains no advantage over the others of the same\r\ncommunity. Associated insects have thus acquired many remarkable\r\nstructures, which are of little or no service to the individual, such\r\nas the pollen-collecting apparatus, or the sting of the worker-bee, or\r\nthe great jaws of soldier-ants. With the higher social animals, I am\r\nnot aware that any structure has been modified solely for the good of\r\nthe community, though some are of secondary service to it. For\r\ninstance, the horns of ruminants and the great canine teeth of baboons\r\nappear to have been acquired by the males as weapons for sexual strife,\r\nbut they are used in defence of the herd or troop. In regard to certain\r\nmental powers the case, as we shall see in the fifth chapter, is wholly\r\ndifferent; for these faculties have been chiefly, or even exclusively,\r\ngained for the benefit of the community, and the individuals thereof\r\nhave at the same time gained an advantage indirectly.\r\n\r\nIt has often been objected to such views as the foregoing, that man is\r\none of the most helpless and defenceless creatures in the world; and\r\nthat during his early and less well-developed condition, he would have\r\nbeen still more helpless. The Duke of Argyll, for instance, insists\r\n(96. ‘Primeval Man,’ 1869, p. 66.) that “the human frame has diverged\r\nfrom the structure of brutes, in the direction of greater physical\r\nhelplessness and weakness. That is to say, it is a divergence which of\r\nall others it is most impossible to ascribe to mere natural selection.”\r\nHe adduces the naked and unprotected state of the body, the absence of\r\ngreat teeth or claws for defence, the small strength and speed of man,\r\nand his slight power of discovering food or of avoiding danger by\r\nsmell. To these deficiencies there might be added one still more\r\nserious, namely, that he cannot climb quickly, and so escape from\r\nenemies. The loss of hair would not have been a great injury to the\r\ninhabitants of a warm country. For we know that the unclothed Fuegians\r\ncan exist under a wretched climate. When we compare the defenceless\r\nstate of man with that of apes, we must remember that the great canine\r\nteeth with which the latter are provided, are possessed in their full\r\ndevelopment by the males alone, and are chiefly used by them for\r\nfighting with their rivals; yet the females, which are not thus\r\nprovided, manage to survive.\r\n\r\nIn regard to bodily size or strength, we do not know whether man is\r\ndescended from some small species, like the chimpanzee, or from one as\r\npowerful as the gorilla; and, therefore, we cannot say whether man has\r\nbecome larger and stronger, or smaller and weaker, than his ancestors.\r\nWe should, however, bear in mind that an animal possessing great size,\r\nstrength, and ferocity, and which, like the gorilla, could defend\r\nitself from all enemies, would not perhaps have become social: and this\r\nwould most effectually have checked the acquirement of the higher\r\nmental qualities, such as sympathy and the love of his fellows. Hence\r\nit might have been an immense advantage to man to have sprung from some\r\ncomparatively weak creature.\r\n\r\nThe small strength and speed of man, his want of natural weapons, etc.,\r\nare more than counterbalanced, firstly, by his intellectual powers,\r\nthrough which he has formed for himself weapons, tools, etc., though\r\nstill remaining in a barbarous state, and, secondly, by his social\r\nqualities which lead him to give and receive aid from his fellow-men.\r\nNo country in the world abounds in a greater degree with dangerous\r\nbeasts than Southern Africa; no country presents more fearful physical\r\nhardships than the Arctic regions; yet one of the puniest of races,\r\nthat of the Bushmen, maintains itself in Southern Africa, as do the\r\ndwarfed Esquimaux in the Arctic regions. The ancestors of man were, no\r\ndoubt, inferior in intellect, and probably in social disposition, to\r\nthe lowest existing savages; but it is quite conceivable that they\r\nmight have existed, or even flourished, if they had advanced in\r\nintellect, whilst gradually losing their brute-like powers, such as\r\nthat of climbing trees, etc. But these ancestors would not have been\r\nexposed to any special danger, even if far more helpless and\r\ndefenceless than any existing savages, had they inhabited some warm\r\ncontinent or large island, such as Australia, New Guinea, or Borneo,\r\nwhich is now the home of the orang. And natural selection arising from\r\nthe competition of tribe with tribe, in some such large area as one of\r\nthese, together with the inherited effects of habit, would, under\r\nfavourable conditions, have sufficed to raise man to his present high\r\nposition in the organic scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE MENTAL POWERS OF MAN AND THE LOWER ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference in mental power between the highest ape and the lowest\r\nsavage, immense—Certain instincts in common—The\r\nemotions—Curiosity—Imitation—Attention—Memory—\r\nImagination—Reason—Progressive improvement —Tools and weapons used by\r\nanimals—Abstraction, Self-consciousness—Language—Sense of beauty—Belief\r\nin God, spiritual agencies, superstitions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last two chapters that man bears in his bodily\r\nstructure clear traces of his descent from some lower form; but it may\r\nbe urged that, as man differs so greatly in his mental power from all\r\nother animals, there must be some error in this conclusion. No doubt\r\nthe difference in this respect is enormous, even if we compare the mind\r\nof one of the lowest savages, who has no words to express any number\r\nhigher than four, and who uses hardly any abstract terms for common\r\nobjects or for the affections (1. See the evidence on those points, as\r\ngiven by Lubbock, ‘Prehistoric Times,’ p. 354, etc.), with that of the\r\nmost highly organised ape. The difference would, no doubt, still remain\r\nimmense, even if one of the higher apes had been improved or civilised\r\nas much as a dog has been in comparison with its parent-form, the wolf\r\nor jackal. The Fuegians rank amongst the lowest barbarians; but I was\r\ncontinually struck with surprise how closely the three natives on board\r\nH.M.S. “Beagle,” who had lived some years in England, and could talk a\r\nlittle English, resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental\r\nfaculties. If no organic being excepting man had possessed any mental\r\npower, or if his powers had been of a wholly different nature from\r\nthose of the lower animals, then we should never have been able to\r\nconvince ourselves that our high faculties had been gradually\r\ndeveloped. But it can be shewn that there is no fundamental difference\r\nof this kind. We must also admit that there is a much wider interval in\r\nmental power between one of the lowest fishes, as a lamprey or\r\nlancelet, and one of the higher apes, than between an ape and man; yet\r\nthis interval is filled up by numberless gradations.\r\n\r\nNor is the difference slight in moral disposition between a barbarian,\r\nsuch as the man described by the old navigator Byron, who dashed his\r\nchild on the rocks for dropping a basket of sea-urchins, and a Howard\r\nor Clarkson; and in intellect, between a savage who uses hardly any\r\nabstract terms, and a Newton or Shakspeare. Differences of this kind\r\nbetween the highest men of the highest races and the lowest savages,\r\nare connected by the finest gradations. Therefore it is possible that\r\nthey might pass and be developed into each other.\r\n\r\nMy object in this chapter is to shew that there is no fundamental\r\ndifference between man and the higher mammals in their mental\r\nfaculties. Each division of the subject might have been extended into a\r\nseparate essay, but must here be treated briefly. As no classification\r\nof the mental powers has been universally accepted, I shall arrange my\r\nremarks in the order most convenient for my purpose; and will select\r\nthose facts which have struck me most, with the hope that they may\r\nproduce some effect on the reader.\r\n\r\nWith respect to animals very low in the scale, I shall give some\r\nadditional facts under Sexual Selection, shewing that their mental\r\npowers are much higher than might have been expected. The variability\r\nof the faculties in the individuals of the same species is an important\r\npoint for us, and some few illustrations will here be given. But it\r\nwould be superfluous to enter into many details on this head, for I\r\nhave found on frequent enquiry, that it is the unanimous opinion of all\r\nthose who have long attended to animals of many kinds, including birds,\r\nthat the individuals differ greatly in every mental characteristic. In\r\nwhat manner the mental powers were first developed in the lowest\r\norganisms, is as hopeless an enquiry as how life itself first\r\noriginated. These are problems for the distant future, if they are ever\r\nto be solved by man.\r\n\r\nAs man possesses the same senses as the lower animals, his fundamental\r\nintuitions must be the same. Man has also some few instincts in common,\r\nas that of self-preservation, sexual love, the love of the mother for\r\nher new-born offspring, the desire possessed by the latter to suck, and\r\nso forth. But man, perhaps, has somewhat fewer instincts than those\r\npossessed by the animals which come next to him in the series. The\r\norang in the Eastern islands, and the chimpanzee in Africa, build\r\nplatforms on which they sleep; and, as both species follow the same\r\nhabit, it might be argued that this was due to instinct, but we cannot\r\nfeel sure that it is not the result of both animals having similar\r\nwants, and possessing similar powers of reasoning. These apes, as we\r\nmay assume, avoid the many poisonous fruits of the tropics, and man has\r\nno such knowledge: but as our domestic animals, when taken to foreign\r\nlands, and when first turned out in the spring, often eat poisonous\r\nherbs, which they afterwards avoid, we cannot feel sure that the apes\r\ndo not learn from their own experience or from that of their parents\r\nwhat fruits to select. It is, however, certain, as we shall presently\r\nsee, that apes have an instinctive dread of serpents, and probably of\r\nother dangerous animals.\r\n\r\nThe fewness and the comparative simplicity of the instincts in the\r\nhigher animals are remarkable in contrast with those of the lower\r\nanimals. Cuvier maintained that instinct and intelligence stand in an\r\ninverse ratio to each other; and some have thought that the\r\nintellectual faculties of the higher animals have been gradually\r\ndeveloped from their instincts. But Pouchet, in an interesting essay\r\n(2. ‘L’Instinct chez les Insectes,’ ‘Revue des Deux Mondes,’ Feb. 1870,\r\np. 690.), has shewn that no such inverse ratio really exists. Those\r\ninsects which possess the most wonderful instincts are certainly the\r\nmost intelligent. In the vertebrate series, the least intelligent\r\nmembers, namely fishes and amphibians, do not possess complex\r\ninstincts; and amongst mammals the animal most remarkable for its\r\ninstincts, namely the beaver, is highly intelligent, as will be\r\nadmitted by every one who has read Mr. Morgan’s excellent work. (3.\r\n‘The American Beaver and His Works,’ 1868.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the first dawnings of intelligence, according to Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer (4. ‘The Principles of Psychology,’ 2nd edit., 1870, pp.\r\n418-443.), have been developed through the multiplication and\r\nco-ordination of reflex actions, and although many of the simpler\r\ninstincts graduate into reflex actions, and can hardly be distinguished\r\nfrom them, as in the case of young animals sucking, yet the more\r\ncomplex instincts seem to have originated independently of\r\nintelligence. I am, however, very far from wishing to deny that\r\ninstinctive actions may lose their fixed and untaught character, and be\r\nreplaced by others performed by the aid of the free will. On the other\r\nhand, some intelligent actions, after being performed during several\r\ngenerations, become converted into instincts and are inherited, as when\r\nbirds on oceanic islands learn to avoid man. These actions may then be\r\nsaid to be degraded in character, for they are no longer performed\r\nthrough reason or from experience. But the greater number of the more\r\ncomplex instincts appear to have been gained in a wholly different\r\nmanner, through the natural selection of variations of simpler\r\ninstinctive actions. Such variations appear to arise from the same\r\nunknown causes acting on the cerebral organisation, which induce slight\r\nvariations or individual differences in other parts of the body; and\r\nthese variations, owing to our ignorance, are often said to arise\r\nspontaneously. We can, I think, come to no other conclusion with\r\nrespect to the origin of the more complex instincts, when we reflect on\r\nthe marvellous instincts of sterile worker-ants and bees, which leave\r\nno offspring to inherit the effects of experience and of modified\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we learn from the above-mentioned insects and the beaver,\r\na high degree of intelligence is certainly compatible with complex\r\ninstincts, and although actions, at first learnt voluntarily can soon\r\nthrough habit be performed with the quickness and certainty of a reflex\r\naction, yet it is not improbable that there is a certain amount of\r\ninterference between the development of free intelligence and of\r\ninstinct,—which latter implies some inherited modification of the\r\nbrain. Little is known about the functions of the brain, but we can\r\nperceive that as the intellectual powers become highly developed, the\r\nvarious parts of the brain must be connected by very intricate channels\r\nof the freest intercommunication; and as a consequence each separate\r\npart would perhaps tend to be less well fitted to answer to particular\r\nsensations or associations in a definite and inherited—that is\r\ninstinctive—manner. There seems even to exist some relation between a\r\nlow degree of intelligence and a strong tendency to the formation of\r\nfixed, though not inherited habits; for as a sagacious physician\r\nremarked to me, persons who are slightly imbecile tend to act in\r\neverything by routine or habit; and they are rendered much happier if\r\nthis is encouraged.\r\n\r\nI have thought this digression worth giving, because we may easily\r\nunderrate the mental powers of the higher animals, and especially of\r\nman, when we compare their actions founded on the memory of past\r\nevents, on foresight, reason, and imagination, with exactly similar\r\nactions instinctively performed by the lower animals; in this latter\r\ncase the capacity of performing such actions has been gained, step by\r\nstep, through the variability of the mental organs and natural\r\nselection, without any conscious intelligence on the part of the animal\r\nduring each successive generation. No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has argued\r\n(5. ‘Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,’ 1870, p. 212.),\r\nmuch of the intelligent work done by man is due to imitation and not to\r\nreason; but there is this great difference between his actions and many\r\nof those performed by the lower animals, namely, that man cannot, on\r\nhis first trial, make, for instance, a stone hatchet or a canoe,\r\nthrough his power of imitation. He has to learn his work by practice; a\r\nbeaver, on the other hand, can make its dam or canal, and a bird its\r\nnest, as well, or nearly as well, and a spider its wonderful web, quite\r\nas well (6. For the evidence on this head, see Mr. J. Traherne\r\nMoggridge’s most interesting work, ‘Harvesting Ants and Trap-Door\r\nSpiders,’ 1873, pp. 126, 128.), the first time it tries as when old and\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nTo return to our immediate subject: the lower animals, like man,\r\nmanifestly feel pleasure and pain, happiness and misery. Happiness is\r\nnever better exhibited than by young animals, such as puppies, kittens,\r\nlambs, etc., when playing together, like our own children. Even insects\r\nplay together, as has been described by that excellent observer, P.\r\nHuber (7. ‘Recherches sur les Moeurs des Fourmis,’ 1810, p. 173.), who\r\nsaw ants chasing and pretending to bite each other, like so many\r\npuppies.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the lower animals are excited by the same emotions as\r\nourselves is so well established, that it will not be necessary to\r\nweary the reader by many details. Terror acts in the same manner on\r\nthem as on us, causing the muscles to tremble, the heart to palpitate,\r\nthe sphincters to be relaxed, and the hair to stand on end. Suspicion,\r\nthe offspring of fear, is eminently characteristic of most wild\r\nanimals. It is, I think, impossible to read the account given by Sir E.\r\nTennent, of the behaviour of the female elephants, used as decoys,\r\nwithout admitting that they intentionally practise deceit, and well\r\nknow what they are about. Courage and timidity are extremely variable\r\nqualities in the individuals of the same species, as is plainly seen in\r\nour dogs. Some dogs and horses are ill-tempered, and easily turn sulky;\r\nothers are good-tempered; and these qualities are certainly inherited.\r\nEvery one knows how liable animals are to furious rage, and how plainly\r\nthey shew it. Many, and probably true, anecdotes have been published on\r\nthe long-delayed and artful revenge of various animals. The accurate\r\nRengger, and Brehm (8. All the following statements, given on the\r\nauthority of these two naturalists, are taken from Rengger’s\r\n‘Naturgesch. der Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ 1830, s. 41-57, and from\r\nBrehm’s ‘Thierleben,’ B. i. s. 10-87.) state that the American and\r\nAfrican monkeys which they kept tame, certainly revenged themselves.\r\nSir Andrew Smith, a zoologist whose scrupulous accuracy was known to\r\nmany persons, told me the following story of which he was himself an\r\neye-witness; at the Cape of Good Hope an officer had often plagued a\r\ncertain baboon, and the animal, seeing him approaching one Sunday for\r\nparade, poured water into a hole and hastily made some thick mud, which\r\nhe skilfully dashed over the officer as he passed by, to the amusement\r\nof many bystanders. For long afterwards the baboon rejoiced and\r\ntriumphed whenever he saw his victim.\r\n\r\nThe love of a dog for his master is notorious; as an old writer\r\nquaintly says (9. Quoted by Dr. Lauder Lindsay, in his ‘Physiology of\r\nMind in the Lower Animals,’ ‘Journal of Mental Science,’ April 1871, p.\r\n38.), “A dog is the only thing on this earth that luvs you more than he\r\nluvs himself.”\r\n\r\nIn the agony of death a dog has been known to caress his master, and\r\nevery one has heard of the dog suffering under vivisection, who licked\r\nthe hand of the operator; this man, unless the operation was fully\r\njustified by an increase of our knowledge, or unless he had a heart of\r\nstone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life.\r\n\r\nAs Whewell (10. ‘Bridgewater Treatise,’ p. 263.) has well asked, “who\r\nthat reads the touching instances of maternal affection, related so\r\noften of the women of all nations, and of the females of all animals,\r\ncan doubt that the principle of action is the same in the two cases?”\r\nWe see maternal affection exhibited in the most trifling details; thus\r\nRengger observed an American monkey (a Cebus) carefully driving away\r\nthe flies which plagued her infant; and Duvaucel saw a Hylobates\r\nwashing the faces of her young ones in a stream. So intense is the\r\ngrief of female monkeys for the loss of their young, that it invariably\r\ncaused the death of certain kinds kept under confinement by Brehm in N.\r\nAfrica. Orphan monkeys were always adopted and carefully guarded by the\r\nother monkeys, both males and females. One female baboon had so\r\ncapacious a heart that she not only adopted young monkeys of other\r\nspecies, but stole young dogs and cats, which she continually carried\r\nabout. Her kindness, however, did not go so far as to share her food\r\nwith her adopted offspring, at which Brehm was surprised, as his\r\nmonkeys always divided everything quite fairly with their own young\r\nones. An adopted kitten scratched this affectionate baboon, who\r\ncertainly had a fine intellect, for she was much astonished at being\r\nscratched, and immediately examined the kitten’s feet, and without more\r\nado bit off the claws. (11. A critic, without any grounds (‘Quarterly\r\nReview,’ July 1871, p. 72), disputes the possibility of this act as\r\ndescribed by Brehm, for the sake of discrediting my work. Therefore I\r\ntried, and found that I could readily seize with my own teeth the sharp\r\nlittle claws of a kitten nearly five weeks old.) In the Zoological\r\nGardens, I heard from the keeper that an old baboon (C. chacma) had\r\nadopted a Rhesus monkey; but when a young drill and mandrill were\r\nplaced in the cage, she seemed to perceive that these monkeys, though\r\ndistinct species, were her nearer relatives, for she at once rejected\r\nthe Rhesus and adopted both of them. The young Rhesus, as I saw, was\r\ngreatly discontented at being thus rejected, and it would, like a\r\nnaughty child, annoy and attack the young drill and mandrill whenever\r\nit could do so with safety; this conduct exciting great indignation in\r\nthe old baboon. Monkeys will also, according to Brehm, defend their\r\nmaster when attacked by any one, as well as dogs to whom they are\r\nattached, from the attacks of other dogs. But we here trench on the\r\nsubjects of sympathy and fidelity, to which I shall recur. Some of\r\nBrehm’s monkeys took much delight in teasing a certain old dog whom\r\nthey disliked, as well as other animals, in various ingenious ways.\r\n\r\nMost of the more complex emotions are common to the higher animals and\r\nourselves. Every one has seen how jealous a dog is of his master’s\r\naffection, if lavished on any other creature; and I have observed the\r\nsame fact with monkeys. This shews that animals not only love, but have\r\ndesire to be loved. Animals manifestly feel emulation. They love\r\napprobation or praise; and a dog carrying a basket for his master\r\nexhibits in a high degree self-complacency or pride. There can, I\r\nthink, be no doubt that a dog feels shame, as distinct from fear, and\r\nsomething very like modesty when begging too often for food. A great\r\ndog scorns the snarling of a little dog, and this may be called\r\nmagnanimity. Several observers have stated that monkeys certainly\r\ndislike being laughed at; and they sometimes invent imaginary offences.\r\nIn the Zoological Gardens I saw a baboon who always got into a furious\r\nrage when his keeper took out a letter or book and read it aloud to\r\nhim; and his rage was so violent that, as I witnessed on one occasion,\r\nhe bit his own leg till the blood flowed. Dogs shew what may be fairly\r\ncalled a sense of humour, as distinct from mere play; if a bit of stick\r\nor other such object be thrown to one, he will often carry it away for\r\na short distance; and then squatting down with it on the ground close\r\nbefore him, will wait until his master comes quite close to take it\r\naway. The dog will then seize it and rush away in triumph, repeating\r\nthe same manoeuvre, and evidently enjoying the practical joke.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the more intellectual emotions and faculties, which\r\nare very important, as forming the basis for the development of the\r\nhigher mental powers. Animals manifestly enjoy excitement, and suffer\r\nfrom ennui, as may be seen with dogs, and, according to Rengger, with\r\nmonkeys. All animals feel WONDER, and many exhibit CURIOSITY. They\r\nsometimes suffer from this latter quality, as when the hunter plays\r\nantics and thus attracts them; I have witnessed this with deer, and so\r\nit is with the wary chamois, and with some kinds of wild-ducks. Brehm\r\ngives a curious account of the instinctive dread, which his monkeys\r\nexhibited, for snakes; but their curiosity was so great that they could\r\nnot desist from occasionally satiating their horror in a most human\r\nfashion, by lifting up the lid of the box in which the snakes were\r\nkept. I was so much surprised at his account, that I took a stuffed and\r\ncoiled-up snake into the monkey-house at the Zoological Gardens, and\r\nthe excitement thus caused was one of the most curious spectacles which\r\nI ever beheld. Three species of Cercopithecus were the most alarmed;\r\nthey dashed about their cages, and uttered sharp signal cries of\r\ndanger, which were understood by the other monkeys. A few young monkeys\r\nand one old Anubis baboon alone took no notice of the snake. I then\r\nplaced the stuffed specimen on the ground in one of the larger\r\ncompartments. After a time all the monkeys collected round it in a\r\nlarge circle, and staring intently, presented a most ludicrous\r\nappearance. They became extremely nervous; so that when a wooden ball,\r\nwith which they were familiar as a plaything, was accidentally moved in\r\nthe straw, under which it was partly hidden, they all instantly started\r\naway. These monkeys behaved very differently when a dead fish, a mouse\r\n(12. I have given a short account of their behaviour on this occasion\r\nin my ‘Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,’ p. 43.), a\r\nliving turtle, and other new objects were placed in their cages; for\r\nthough at first frightened, they soon approached, handled and examined\r\nthem. I then placed a live snake in a paper bag, with the mouth loosely\r\nclosed, in one of the larger compartments. One of the monkeys\r\nimmediately approached, cautiously opened the bag a little, peeped in,\r\nand instantly dashed away. Then I witnessed what Brehm has described,\r\nfor monkey after monkey, with head raised high and turned on one side,\r\ncould not resist taking a momentary peep into the upright bag, at the\r\ndreadful object lying quietly at the bottom. It would almost appear as\r\nif monkeys had some notion of zoological affinities, for those kept by\r\nBrehm exhibited a strange, though mistaken, instinctive dread of\r\ninnocent lizards and frogs. An orang, also, has been known to be much\r\nalarmed at the first sight of a turtle. (13. W.C.L. Martin, ‘Natural\r\nHistory of Mammalia,’ 1841, p. 405.)\r\n\r\nThe principle of IMITATION is strong in man, and especially, as I have\r\nmyself observed, with savages. In certain morbid states of the brain\r\nthis tendency is exaggerated to an extraordinary degree: some\r\nhemiplegic patients and others, at the commencement of inflammatory\r\nsoftening of the brain, unconsciously imitate every word which is\r\nuttered, whether in their own or in a foreign language, and every\r\ngesture or action which is performed near them. (14. Dr. Bateman, ‘On\r\nAphasia,’ 1870, p. 110.) Desor (15. Quoted by Vogt, ‘Mémoire sur les\r\nMicrocephales,’ 1867, p. 168.) has remarked that no animal voluntarily\r\nimitates an action performed by man, until in the ascending scale we\r\ncome to monkeys, which are well known to be ridiculous mockers.\r\nAnimals, however, sometimes imitate each other’s actions: thus two\r\nspecies of wolves, which had been reared by dogs, learned to bark, as\r\ndoes sometimes the jackal (16. The ‘Variation of Animals and Plants\r\nunder Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 27.), but whether this can be called\r\nvoluntary imitation is another question. Birds imitate the songs of\r\ntheir parents, and sometimes of other birds; and parrots are notorious\r\nimitators of any sound which they often hear. Dureau de la Malle gives\r\nan account (17. ‘Annales des Sciences Nat.’ (1st Series), tom. xxii. p.\r\n397.) of a dog reared by a cat, who learnt to imitate the well-known\r\naction of a cat licking her paws, and thus washing her ears and face;\r\nthis was also witnessed by the celebrated naturalist Audouin. I have\r\nreceived several confirmatory accounts; in one of these, a dog had not\r\nbeen suckled by a cat, but had been brought up with one, together with\r\nkittens, and had thus acquired the above habit, which he ever\r\nafterwards practised during his life of thirteen years. Dureau de la\r\nMalle’s dog likewise learnt from the kittens to play with a ball by\r\nrolling it about with his fore paws, and springing on it. A\r\ncorrespondent assures me that a cat in his house used to put her paws\r\ninto jugs of milk having too narrow a mouth for her head. A kitten of\r\nthis cat soon learned the same trick, and practised it ever afterwards,\r\nwhenever there was an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe parents of many animals, trusting to the principle of imitation in\r\ntheir young, and more especially to their instinctive or inherited\r\ntendencies, may be said to educate them. We see this when a cat brings\r\na live mouse to her kittens; and Dureau de la Malle has given a curious\r\naccount (in the paper above quoted) of his observations on hawks which\r\ntaught their young dexterity, as well as judgment of distances, by\r\nfirst dropping through the air dead mice and sparrows, which the young\r\ngenerally failed to catch, and then bringing them live birds and\r\nletting them loose.\r\n\r\nHardly any faculty is more important for the intellectual progress of\r\nman than ATTENTION. Animals clearly manifest this power, as when a cat\r\nwatches by a hole and prepares to spring on its prey. Wild animals\r\nsometimes become so absorbed when thus engaged, that they may be easily\r\napproached. Mr. Bartlett has given me a curious proof how variable this\r\nfaculty is in monkeys. A man who trains monkeys to act in plays, used\r\nto purchase common kinds from the Zoological Society at the price of\r\nfive pounds for each; but he offered to give double the price, if he\r\nmight keep three or four of them for a few days, in order to select\r\none. When asked how he could possibly learn so soon, whether a\r\nparticular monkey would turn out a good actor, he answered that it all\r\ndepended on their power of attention. If when he was talking and\r\nexplaining anything to a monkey, its attention was easily distracted,\r\nas by a fly on the wall or other trifling object, the case was\r\nhopeless. If he tried by punishment to make an inattentive monkey act,\r\nit turned sulky. On the other hand, a monkey which carefully attended\r\nto him could always be trained.\r\n\r\nIt is almost superfluous to state that animals have excellent MEMORIES\r\nfor persons and places. A baboon at the Cape of Good Hope, as I have\r\nbeen informed by Sir Andrew Smith, recognised him with joy after an\r\nabsence of nine months. I had a dog who was savage and averse to all\r\nstrangers, and I purposely tried his memory after an absence of five\r\nyears and two days. I went near the stable where he lived, and shouted\r\nto him in my old manner; he shewed no joy, but instantly followed me\r\nout walking, and obeyed me, exactly as if I had parted with him only\r\nhalf an hour before. A train of old associations, dormant during five\r\nyears, had thus been instantaneously awakened in his mind. Even ants,\r\nas P. Huber (18. ‘Les Moeurs des Fourmis,’ 1810, p. 150.) has clearly\r\nshewn, recognised their fellow-ants belonging to the same community\r\nafter a separation of four months. Animals can certainly by some means\r\njudge of the intervals of time between recurrent events.\r\n\r\nThe IMAGINATION is one of the highest prerogatives of man. By this\r\nfaculty he unites former images and ideas, independently of the will,\r\nand thus creates brilliant and novel results. A poet, as Jean Paul\r\nRichter remarks (19. Quoted in Dr. Maudsley’s ‘Physiology and Pathology\r\nof Mind,’ 1868, pp. 19, 220.), “who must reflect whether he shall make\r\na character say yes or no—to the devil with him; he is only a stupid\r\ncorpse.” Dreaming gives us the best notion of this power; as Jean Paul\r\nagain says, “The dream is an involuntary art of poetry.” The value of\r\nthe products of our imagination depends of course on the number,\r\naccuracy, and clearness of our impressions, on our judgment and taste\r\nin selecting or rejecting the involuntary combinations, and to a\r\ncertain extent on our power of voluntarily combining them. As dogs,\r\ncats, horses, and probably all the higher animals, even birds (20. Dr.\r\nJerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. 1862, p. xxi. Houzeau says that his\r\nparokeets and canary-birds dreamt: ‘Etudes sur les Facultes Mentales\r\ndes Animaux,’ tom. ii. p. 136.) have vivid dreams, and this is shewn by\r\ntheir movements and the sounds uttered, we must admit that they possess\r\nsome power of imagination. There must be something special, which\r\ncauses dogs to howl in the night, and especially during moonlight, in\r\nthat remarkable and melancholy manner called baying. All dogs do not do\r\nso; and, according to Houzeau (21. ibid. 1872, tom. ii. p. 181.), they\r\ndo not then look at the moon, but at some fixed point near the horizon.\r\nHouzeau thinks that their imaginations are disturbed by the vague\r\noutlines of the surrounding objects, and conjure up before them\r\nfantastic images: if this be so, their feelings may almost be called\r\nsuperstitious.\r\n\r\nOf all the faculties of the human mind, it will, I presume, be admitted\r\nthat REASON stands at the summit. Only a few persons now dispute that\r\nanimals possess some power of reasoning. Animals may constantly be seen\r\nto pause, deliberate, and resolve. It is a significant fact, that the\r\nmore the habits of any particular animal are studied by a naturalist,\r\nthe more he attributes to reason and the less to unlearnt instincts.\r\n(22. Mr. L.H. Morgan’s work on ‘The American Beaver,’ 1868, offers a\r\ngood illustration of this remark. I cannot help thinking, however, that\r\nhe goes too far in underrating the power of instinct.) In future\r\nchapters we shall see that some animals extremely low in the scale\r\napparently display a certain amount of reason. No doubt it is often\r\ndifficult to distinguish between the power of reason and that of\r\ninstinct. For instance, Dr. Hayes, in his work on ‘The Open Polar Sea,’\r\nrepeatedly remarks that his dogs, instead of continuing to draw the\r\nsledges in a compact body, diverged and separated when they came to\r\nthin ice, so that their weight might be more evenly distributed. This\r\nwas often the first warning which the travellers received that the ice\r\nwas becoming thin and dangerous. Now, did the dogs act thus from the\r\nexperience of each individual, or from the example of the older and\r\nwiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from instinct? This\r\ninstinct, may possibly have arisen since the time, long ago, when dogs\r\nwere first employed by the natives in drawing their sledges; or the\r\nArctic wolves, the parent-stock of the Esquimaux dog, may have acquired\r\nan instinct impelling them not to attack their prey in a close pack,\r\nwhen on thin ice.\r\n\r\nWe can only judge by the circumstances under which actions are\r\nperformed, whether they are due to instinct, or to reason, or to the\r\nmere association of ideas: this latter principle, however, is\r\nintimately connected with reason. A curious case has been given by\r\nProf. Mobius (23. ‘Die Bewegungen der Thiere,’ etc., 1873, p. 11.), of\r\na pike, separated by a plate of glass from an adjoining aquarium\r\nstocked with fish, and who often dashed himself with such violence\r\nagainst the glass in trying to catch the other fishes, that he was\r\nsometimes completely stunned. The pike went on thus for three months,\r\nbut at last learnt caution, and ceased to do so. The plate of glass was\r\nthen removed, but the pike would not attack these particular fishes,\r\nthough he would devour others which were afterwards introduced; so\r\nstrongly was the idea of a violent shock associated in his feeble mind\r\nwith the attempt on his former neighbours. If a savage, who had never\r\nseen a large plate-glass window, were to dash himself even once against\r\nit, he would for a long time afterwards associate a shock with a\r\nwindow-frame; but very differently from the pike, he would probably\r\nreflect on the nature of the impediment, and be cautious under\r\nanalogous circumstances. Now with monkeys, as we shall presently see, a\r\npainful or merely a disagreeable impression, from an action once\r\nperformed, is sometimes sufficient to prevent the animal from repeating\r\nit. If we attribute this difference between the monkey and the pike\r\nsolely to the association of ideas being so much stronger and more\r\npersistent in the one than the other, though the pike often received\r\nmuch the more severe injury, can we maintain in the case of man that a\r\nsimilar difference implies the possession of a fundamentally different\r\nmind?\r\n\r\nHouzeau relates (24. ‘Études sur les Facultés Mentales des Animaux,’\r\n1872, tom. ii. p. 265.) that, whilst crossing a wide and arid plain in\r\nTexas, his two dogs suffered greatly from thirst, and that between\r\nthirty and forty times they rushed down the hollows to search for\r\nwater. These hollows were not valleys, and there were no trees in them,\r\nor any other difference in the vegetation, and as they were absolutely\r\ndry there could have been no smell of damp earth. The dogs behaved as\r\nif they knew that a dip in the ground offered them the best chance of\r\nfinding water, and Houzeau has often witnessed the same behaviour in\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\nI have seen, as I daresay have others, that when a small object is\r\nthrown on the ground beyond the reach of one of the elephants in the\r\nZoological Gardens, he blows through his trunk on the ground beyond the\r\nobject, so that the current reflected on all sides may drive the object\r\nwithin his reach. Again a well-known ethnologist, Mr. Westropp, informs\r\nme that he observed in Vienna a bear deliberately making with his paw a\r\ncurrent in some water, which was close to the bars of his cage, so as\r\nto draw a piece of floating bread within his reach. These actions of\r\nthe elephant and bear can hardly be attributed to instinct or inherited\r\nhabit, as they would be of little use to an animal in a state of\r\nnature. Now, what is the difference between such actions, when\r\nperformed by an uncultivated man, and by one of the higher animals?\r\n\r\nThe savage and the dog have often found water at a low level, and the\r\ncoincidence under such circumstances has become associated in their\r\nminds. A cultivated man would perhaps make some general proposition on\r\nthe subject; but from all that we know of savages it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether they would do so, and a dog certainly would not. But a\r\nsavage, as well as a dog, would search in the same way, though\r\nfrequently disappointed; and in both it seems to be equally an act of\r\nreason, whether or not any general proposition on the subject is\r\nconsciously placed before the mind. (25. Prof. Huxley has analysed with\r\nadmirable clearness the mental steps by which a man, as well as a dog,\r\narrives at a conclusion in a case analogous to that given in my text.\r\nSee his article, ‘Mr. Darwin’s Critics,’ in the ‘Contemporary Review,’\r\nNov. 1871, p. 462, and in his ‘Critiques and Essays,’ 1873, p. 279.)\r\nThe same would apply to the elephant and the bear making currents in\r\nthe air or water. The savage would certainly neither know nor care by\r\nwhat law the desired movements were effected; yet his act would be\r\nguided by a rude process of reasoning, as surely as would a philosopher\r\nin his longest chain of deductions. There would no doubt be this\r\ndifference between him and one of the higher animals, that he would\r\ntake notice of much slighter circumstances and conditions, and would\r\nobserve any connection between them after much less experience, and\r\nthis would be of paramount importance. I kept a daily record of the\r\nactions of one of my infants, and when he was about eleven months old,\r\nand before he could speak a single word, I was continually struck with\r\nthe greater quickness, with which all sorts of objects and sounds were\r\nassociated together in his mind, compared with that of the most\r\nintelligent dogs I ever knew. But the higher animals differ in exactly\r\nthe same way in this power of association from those low in the scale,\r\nsuch as the pike, as well as in that of drawing inferences and of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe promptings of reason, after very short experience, are well shewn\r\nby the following actions of American monkeys, which stand low in their\r\norder. Rengger, a most careful observer, states that when he first gave\r\neggs to his monkeys in Paraguay, they smashed them, and thus lost much\r\nof their contents; afterwards they gently hit one end against some hard\r\nbody, and picked off the bits of shell with their fingers. After\r\ncutting themselves only ONCE with any sharp tool, they would not touch\r\nit again, or would handle it with the greatest caution. Lumps of sugar\r\nwere often given them wrapped up in paper; and Rengger sometimes put a\r\nlive wasp in the paper, so that in hastily unfolding it they got stung;\r\nafter this had ONCE happened, they always first held the packet to\r\ntheir ears to detect any movement within. (26. Mr. Belt, in his most\r\ninteresting work, ‘The Naturalist in Nicaragua,’ 1874, (p. 119),\r\nlikewise describes various actions of a tamed Cebus, which, I think,\r\nclearly shew that this animal possessed some reasoning power.)\r\n\r\nThe following cases relate to dogs. Mr. Colquhoun (27. ‘The Moor and\r\nthe Loch,’ p. 45. Col. Hutchinson on ‘Dog Breaking,’ 1850, p. 46.)\r\nwinged two wild-ducks, which fell on the further side of a stream; his\r\nretriever tried to bring over both at once, but could not succeed; she\r\nthen, though never before known to ruffle a feather, deliberately\r\nkilled one, brought over the other, and returned for the dead bird.\r\nCol. Hutchinson relates that two partridges were shot at once, one\r\nbeing killed, the other wounded; the latter ran away, and was caught by\r\nthe retriever, who on her return came across the dead bird; “she\r\nstopped, evidently greatly puzzled, and after one or two trials,\r\nfinding she could not take it up without permitting the escape of the\r\nwinged bird, she considered a moment, then deliberately murdered it by\r\ngiving it a severe crunch, and afterwards brought away both together.\r\nThis was the only known instance of her ever having wilfully injured\r\nany game.” Here we have reason though not quite perfect, for the\r\nretriever might have brought the wounded bird first and then returned\r\nfor the dead one, as in the case of the two wild-ducks. I give the\r\nabove cases, as resting on the evidence of two independent witnesses,\r\nand because in both instances the retrievers, after deliberation, broke\r\nthrough a habit which is inherited by them (that of not killing the\r\ngame retrieved), and because they shew how strong their reasoning\r\nfaculty must have been to overcome a fixed habit.\r\n\r\nI will conclude by quoting a remark by the illustrious Humboldt. (28.\r\n‘Personal Narrative,’ Eng. translat., vol. iii. p. 106.) “The muleteers\r\nin S. America say, ‘I will not give you the mule whose step is easiest,\r\nbut la mas racional,—the one that reasons best’”; and; as, he adds,\r\n“this popular expression, dictated by long experience, combats the\r\nsystem of animated machines, better perhaps than all the arguments of\r\nspeculative philosophy.” Nevertheless some writers even yet deny that\r\nthe higher animals possess a trace of reason; and they endeavour to\r\nexplain away, by what appears to be mere verbiage, (29. I am glad to\r\nfind that so acute a reasoner as Mr. Leslie Stephen (‘Darwinism and\r\nDivinity, Essays on Free Thinking,’ 1873, p. 80), in speaking of the\r\nsupposed impassable barrier between the minds of man and the lower\r\nanimals, says, “The distinctions, indeed, which have been drawn, seem\r\nto us to rest upon no better foundation than a great many other\r\nmetaphysical distinctions; that is, the assumption that because you can\r\ngive two things different names, they must therefore have different\r\nnatures. It is difficult to understand how anybody who has ever kept a\r\ndog, or seen an elephant, can have any doubt as to an animal’s power of\r\nperforming the essential processes of reasoning.”) all such facts as\r\nthose above given.\r\n\r\nIt has, I think, now been shewn that man and the higher animals,\r\nespecially the Primates, have some few instincts in common. All have\r\nthe same senses, intuitions, and sensations,—similar passions,\r\naffections, and emotions, even the more complex ones, such as jealousy,\r\nsuspicion, emulation, gratitude, and magnanimity; they practise deceit\r\nand are revengeful; they are sometimes susceptible to ridicule, and\r\neven have a sense of humour; they feel wonder and curiosity; they\r\npossess the same faculties of imitation, attention, deliberation,\r\nchoice, memory, imagination, the association of ideas, and reason,\r\nthough in very different degrees. The individuals of the same species\r\ngraduate in intellect from absolute imbecility to high excellence. They\r\nare also liable to insanity, though far less often than in the case of\r\nman. (30. See ‘Madness in Animals,’ by Dr. W. Lauder Lindsay, in\r\n‘Journal of Mental Science,’ July 1871.) Nevertheless, many authors\r\nhave insisted that man is divided by an insuperable barrier from all\r\nthe lower animals in his mental faculties. I formerly made a collection\r\nof above a score of such aphorisms, but they are almost worthless, as\r\ntheir wide difference and number prove the difficulty, if not the\r\nimpossibility, of the attempt. It has been asserted that man alone is\r\ncapable of progressive improvement; that he alone makes use of tools or\r\nfire, domesticates other animals, or possesses property; that no animal\r\nhas the power of abstraction, or of forming general concepts, is\r\nself-conscious and comprehends itself; that no animal employs language;\r\nthat man alone has a sense of beauty, is liable to caprice, has the\r\nfeeling of gratitude, mystery, etc.; believes in God, or is endowed\r\nwith a conscience. I will hazard a few remarks on the more important\r\nand interesting of these points.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Sumner formerly maintained (31. Quoted by Sir C. Lyell,\r\n‘Antiquity of Man,’ p. 497.) that man alone is capable of progressive\r\nimprovement. That he is capable of incomparably greater and more rapid\r\nimprovement than is any other animal, admits of no dispute; and this is\r\nmainly due to his power of speaking and handing down his acquired\r\nknowledge. With animals, looking first to the individual, every one who\r\nhas had any experience in setting traps, knows that young animals can\r\nbe caught much more easily than old ones; and they can be much more\r\neasily approached by an enemy. Even with respect to old animals, it is\r\nimpossible to catch many in the same place and in the same kind of\r\ntrap, or to destroy them by the same kind of poison; yet it is\r\nimprobable that all should have partaken of the poison, and impossible\r\nthat all should have been caught in a trap. They must learn caution by\r\nseeing their brethren caught or poisoned. In North America, where the\r\nfur-bearing animals have long been pursued, they exhibit, according to\r\nthe unanimous testimony of all observers, an almost incredible amount\r\nof sagacity, caution and cunning; but trapping has been there so long\r\ncarried on, that inheritance may possibly have come into play. I have\r\nreceived several accounts that when telegraphs are first set up in any\r\ndistrict, many birds kill themselves by flying against the wires, but\r\nthat in the course of a very few years they learn to avoid this danger,\r\nby seeing, as it would appear, their comrades killed. (32. For\r\nadditional evidence, with details, see M. Houzeau, ‘Études sur les\r\nFacultés Mentales des Animaux,’ tom. ii. 1872, p. 147.)\r\n\r\nIf we look to successive generations, or to the race, there is no doubt\r\nthat birds and other animals gradually both acquire and lose caution in\r\nrelation to man or other enemies (33. See, with respect to birds on\r\noceanic islands, my ‘Journal of Researches during the Voyage of the\r\n“Beagle,”’ 1845, p. 398. ‘Origin of Species,’ 5th ed. p. 260.); and\r\nthis caution is certainly in chief part an inherited habit or instinct,\r\nbut in part the result of individual experience. A good observer, Leroy\r\n(34. ‘Lettres Phil. sur l’Intelligence des Animaux,’ nouvelle edit.,\r\n1802, p. 86.), states, that in districts where foxes are much hunted,\r\nthe young, on first leaving their burrows, are incontestably much more\r\nwary than the old ones in districts where they are not much disturbed.\r\n\r\nOur domestic dogs are descended from wolves and jackals (35. See the\r\nevidence on this head in chap. i. vol. i., ‘On the Variation of Animals\r\nand Plants under Domestication.’), and though they may not have gained\r\nin cunning, and may have lost in wariness and suspicion, yet they have\r\nprogressed in certain moral qualities, such as in affection,\r\ntrust-worthiness, temper, and probably in general intelligence. The\r\ncommon rat has conquered and beaten several other species throughout\r\nEurope, in parts of North America, New Zealand, and recently in\r\nFormosa, as well as on the mainland of China. Mr. Swinhoe (36.\r\n‘Proceedings Zoological Society,’ 1864, p. 186.), who describes these\r\ntwo latter cases, attributes the victory of the common rat over the\r\nlarge Mus coninga to its superior cunning; and this latter quality may\r\nprobably be attributed to the habitual exercise of all its faculties in\r\navoiding extirpation by man, as well as to nearly all the less cunning\r\nor weak-minded rats having been continuously destroyed by him. It is,\r\nhowever, possible that the success of the common rat may be due to its\r\nhaving possessed greater cunning than its fellow-species, before it\r\nbecame associated with man. To maintain, independently of any direct\r\nevidence, that no animal during the course of ages has progressed in\r\nintellect or other mental faculties, is to beg the question of the\r\nevolution of species. We have seen that, according to Lartet, existing\r\nmammals belonging to several orders have larger brains than their\r\nancient tertiary prototypes.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that no animal uses any tool; but the chimpanzee\r\nin a state of nature cracks a native fruit, somewhat like a walnut,\r\nwith a stone. (37. Savage and Wyman in ‘Boston Journal of Natural\r\nHistory,’ vol. iv. 1843-44, p. 383.) Rengger (38. ‘Säugethiere von\r\nParaguay,’ 1830, s. 51-56.) easily taught an American monkey thus to\r\nbreak open hard palm-nuts; and afterwards of its own accord, it used\r\nstones to open other kinds of nuts, as well as boxes. It thus also\r\nremoved the soft rind of fruit that had a disagreeable flavour. Another\r\nmonkey was taught to open the lid of a large box with a stick, and\r\nafterwards it used the stick as a lever to move heavy bodies; and I\r\nhave myself seen a young orang put a stick into a crevice, slip his\r\nhand to the other end, and use it in the proper manner as a lever. The\r\ntamed elephants in India are well known to break off branches of trees\r\nand use them to drive away the flies; and this same act has been\r\nobserved in an elephant in a state of nature. (39. The Indian Field,\r\nMarch 4, 1871.) I have seen a young orang, when she thought she was\r\ngoing to be whipped, cover and protect herself with a blanket or straw.\r\nIn these several cases stones and sticks were employed as implements;\r\nbut they are likewise used as weapons. Brehm (40. ‘Thierleben,’ B. i.\r\ns. 79, 82.) states, on the authority of the well-known traveller\r\nSchimper, that in Abyssinia when the baboons belonging to one species\r\n(C. gelada) descend in troops from the mountains to plunder the fields,\r\nthey sometimes encounter troops of another species (C. hamadryas), and\r\nthen a fight ensues. The Geladas roll down great stones, which the\r\nHamadryas try to avoid, and then both species, making a great uproar,\r\nrush furiously against each other. Brehm, when accompanying the Duke of\r\nCoburg-Gotha, aided in an attack with fire-arms on a troop of baboons\r\nin the pass of Mensa in Abyssinia. The baboons in return rolled so many\r\nstones down the mountain, some as large as a man’s head, that the\r\nattackers had to beat a hasty retreat; and the pass was actually closed\r\nfor a time against the caravan. It deserves notice that these baboons\r\nthus acted in concert. Mr. Wallace (41. ‘The Malay Archipelago,’ vol.\r\ni. 1869, p. 87.) on three occasions saw female orangs, accompanied by\r\ntheir young, “breaking off branches and the great spiny fruit of the\r\nDurian tree, with every appearance of rage; causing such a shower of\r\nmissiles as effectually kept us from approaching too near the tree.” As\r\nI have repeatedly seen, a chimpanzee will throw any object at hand at a\r\nperson who offends him; and the before-mentioned baboon at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope prepared mud for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the Zoological Gardens, a monkey, which had weak teeth, used to\r\nbreak open nuts with a stone; and I was assured by the keepers that\r\nafter using the stone, he hid it in the straw, and would not let any\r\nother monkey touch it. Here, then, we have the idea of property; but\r\nthis idea is common to every dog with a bone, and to most or all birds\r\nwith their nests.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll (42. ‘Primeval Man,’ 1869, pp. 145, 147.) remarks,\r\nthat the fashioning of an implement for a special purpose is absolutely\r\npeculiar to man; and he considers that this forms an immeasurable gulf\r\nbetween him and the brutes. This is no doubt a very important\r\ndistinction; but there appears to me much truth in Sir J. Lubbock’s\r\nsuggestion (43. ‘Prehistoric Times,’ 1865, p. 473, etc.), that when\r\nprimeval man first used flint-stones for any purpose, he would have\r\naccidentally splintered them, and would then have used the sharp\r\nfragments. From this step it would be a small one to break the flints\r\non purpose, and not a very wide step to fashion them rudely. This\r\nlatter advance, however, may have taken long ages, if we may judge by\r\nthe immense interval of time which elapsed before the men of the\r\nneolithic period took to grinding and polishing their stone tools. In\r\nbreaking the flints, as Sir J. Lubbock likewise remarks, sparks would\r\nhave been emitted, and in grinding them heat would have been evolved:\r\nthus the two usual methods of “obtaining fire may have originated.” The\r\nnature of fire would have been known in the many volcanic regions where\r\nlava occasionally flows through forests. The anthropomorphous apes,\r\nguided probably by instinct, build for themselves temporary platforms;\r\nbut as many instincts are largely controlled by reason, the simpler\r\nones, such as this of building a platform, might readily pass into a\r\nvoluntary and conscious act. The orang is known to cover itself at\r\nnight with the leaves of the Pandanus; and Brehm states that one of his\r\nbaboons used to protect itself from the heat of the sun by throwing a\r\nstraw-mat over its head. In these several habits, we probably see the\r\nfirst steps towards some of the simpler arts, such as rude architecture\r\nand dress, as they arose amongst the early progenitors of man.\r\n\r\nABSTRACTION, GENERAL CONCEPTIONS, SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, MENTAL\r\nINDIVIDUALITY.\r\n\r\nIt would be very difficult for any one with even much more knowledge\r\nthan I possess, to determine how far animals exhibit any traces of\r\nthese high mental powers. This difficulty arises from the impossibility\r\nof judging what passes through the mind of an animal; and again, the\r\nfact that writers differ to a great extent in the meaning which they\r\nattribute to the above terms, causes a further difficulty. If one may\r\njudge from various articles which have been published lately, the\r\ngreatest stress seems to be laid on the supposed entire absence in\r\nanimals of the power of abstraction, or of forming general concepts.\r\nBut when a dog sees another dog at a distance, it is often clear that\r\nhe perceives that it is a dog in the abstract; for when he gets nearer\r\nhis whole manner suddenly changes, if the other dog be a friend. A\r\nrecent writer remarks, that in all such cases it is a pure assumption\r\nto assert that the mental act is not essentially of the same nature in\r\nthe animal as in man. If either refers what he perceives with his\r\nsenses to a mental concept, then so do both. (44. Mr. Hookham, in a\r\nletter to Prof. Max Muller, in the ‘Birmingham News,’ May 1873.) When I\r\nsay to my terrier, in an eager voice (and I have made the trial many\r\ntimes), “Hi, hi, where is it?” she at once takes it as a sign that\r\nsomething is to be hunted, and generally first looks quickly all\r\naround, and then rushes into the nearest thicket, to scent for any\r\ngame, but finding nothing, she looks up into any neighbouring tree for\r\na squirrel. Now do not these actions clearly shew that she had in her\r\nmind a general idea or concept that some animal is to be discovered and\r\nhunted?\r\n\r\nIt may be freely admitted that no animal is self-conscious, if by this\r\nterm it is implied, that he reflects on such points, as whence he comes\r\nor whither he will go, or what is life and death, and so forth. But how\r\ncan we feel sure that an old dog with an excellent memory and some\r\npower of imagination, as shewn by his dreams, never reflects on his\r\npast pleasures or pains in the chase? And this would be a form of\r\nself-consciousness. On the other hand, as Buchner (45. ‘Conférences sur\r\nla Théorie Darwinienne,’ French translat. 1869, p. 132.) has remarked,\r\nhow little can the hard-worked wife of a degraded Australian savage,\r\nwho uses very few abstract words, and cannot count above four, exert\r\nher self-consciousness, or reflect on the nature of her own existence.\r\nIt is generally admitted, that the higher animals possess memory,\r\nattention, association, and even some imagination and reason. If these\r\npowers, which differ much in different animals, are capable of\r\nimprovement, there seems no great improbability in more complex\r\nfaculties, such as the higher forms of abstraction, and\r\nself-consciousness, etc., having been evolved through the development\r\nand combination of the simpler ones. It has been urged against the\r\nviews here maintained that it is impossible to say at what point in the\r\nascending scale animals become capable of abstraction, etc.; but who\r\ncan say at what age this occurs in our young children? We see at least\r\nthat such powers are developed in children by imperceptible degrees.\r\n\r\nThat animals retain their mental individuality is unquestionable. When\r\nmy voice awakened a train of old associations in the mind of the\r\nbefore-mentioned dog, he must have retained his mental individuality,\r\nalthough every atom of his brain had probably undergone change more\r\nthan once during the interval of five years. This dog might have\r\nbrought forward the argument lately advanced to crush all\r\nevolutionists, and said, “I abide amid all mental moods and all\r\nmaterial changes...The teaching that atoms leave their impressions as\r\nlegacies to other atoms falling into the places they have vacated is\r\ncontradictory of the utterance of consciousness, and is therefore\r\nfalse; but it is the teaching necessitated by evolutionism,\r\nconsequently the hypothesis is a false one.” (46. The Rev. Dr. J.\r\nM’Cann, ‘Anti-Darwinism,’ 1869, p. 13.)\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nThis faculty has justly been considered as one of the chief\r\ndistinctions between man and the lower animals. But man, as a highly\r\ncompetent judge, Archbishop Whately remarks, “is not the only animal\r\nthat can make use of language to express what is passing in his mind,\r\nand can understand, more or less, what is so expressed by another.”\r\n(47. Quoted in ‘Anthropological Review,’ 1864, p. 158.) In Paraguay the\r\nCebus azarae when excited utters at least six distinct sounds, which\r\nexcite in other monkeys similar emotions. (48. Rengger, ibid. s. 45.)\r\nThe movements of the features and gestures of monkeys are understood by\r\nus, and they partly understand ours, as Rengger and others declare. It\r\nis a more remarkable fact that the dog, since being domesticated, has\r\nlearnt to bark (49. See my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. i. p. 27.) in at least four or five distinct\r\ntones. Although barking is a new art, no doubt the wild parent-species\r\nof the dog expressed their feelings by cries of various kinds. With the\r\ndomesticated dog we have the bark of eagerness, as in the chase; that\r\nof anger, as well as growling; the yelp or howl of despair, as when\r\nshut up; the baying at night; the bark of joy, as when starting on a\r\nwalk with his master; and the very distinct one of demand or\r\nsupplication, as when wishing for a door or window to be opened.\r\nAccording to Houzeau, who paid particular attention to the subject, the\r\ndomestic fowl utters at least a dozen significant sounds. (50.\r\n‘Facultés Mentales des Animaux,’ tom. ii. 1872, p. 346-349.)\r\n\r\nThe habitual use of articulate language is, however, peculiar to man;\r\nbut he uses, in common with the lower animals, inarticulate cries to\r\nexpress his meaning, aided by gestures and the movements of the muscles\r\nof the face. (51. See a discussion on this subject in Mr. E.B. Tylor’s\r\nvery interesting work, ‘Researches into the Early History of Mankind,’\r\n1865, chaps. ii. to iv.) This especially holds good with the more\r\nsimple and vivid feelings, which are but little connected with our\r\nhigher intelligence. Our cries of pain, fear, surprise, anger, together\r\nwith their appropriate actions, and the murmur of a mother to her\r\nbeloved child are more expressive than any words. That which\r\ndistinguishes man from the lower animals is not the understanding of\r\narticulate sounds, for, as every one knows, dogs understand many words\r\nand sentences. In this respect they are at the same stage of\r\ndevelopment as infants, between the ages of ten and twelve months, who\r\nunderstand many words and short sentences, but cannot yet utter a\r\nsingle word. It is not the mere articulation which is our\r\ndistinguishing character, for parrots and other birds possess this\r\npower. Nor is it the mere capacity of connecting definite sounds with\r\ndefinite ideas; for it is certain that some parrots, which have been\r\ntaught to speak, connect unerringly words with things, and persons with\r\nevents. (52. I have received several detailed accounts to this effect.\r\nAdmiral Sir B.J. Sulivan, whom I know to be a careful observer, assures\r\nme that an African parrot, long kept in his father’s house, invariably\r\ncalled certain persons of the household, as well as visitors, by their\r\nnames. He said “good morning” to every one at breakfast, and “good\r\nnight” to each as they left the room at night, and never reversed these\r\nsalutations. To Sir B.J. Sulivan’s father, he used to add to the “ good\r\nmorning” a short sentence, which was never once repeated after his\r\nfather’s death. He scolded violently a strange dog which came into the\r\nroom through the open window; and he scolded another parrot (saying\r\n“you naughty polly”) which had got out of its cage, and was eating\r\napples on the kitchen table. See also, to the same effect, Houzeau on\r\nparrots, ‘Facultés Mentales,’ tom. ii. p. 309. Dr. A. Moschkau informs\r\nme that he knew a starling which never made a mistake in saying in\r\nGerman “good morning” to persons arriving, and “good bye, old fellow,”\r\nto those departing. I could add several other such cases.) The lower\r\nanimals differ from man solely in his almost infinitely larger power of\r\nassociating together the most diversified sounds and ideas; and this\r\nobviously depends on the high development of his mental powers.\r\n\r\nAs Horne Tooke, one of the founders of the noble science of philology,\r\nobserves, language is an art, like brewing or baking; but writing would\r\nhave been a better simile. It certainly is not a true instinct, for\r\nevery language has to be learnt. It differs, however, widely from all\r\nordinary arts, for man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see\r\nin the babble of our young children; whilst no child has an instinctive\r\ntendency to brew, bake, or write. Moreover, no philologist now supposes\r\nthat any language has been deliberately invented; it has been slowly\r\nand unconsciously developed by many steps. (53. See some good remarks\r\non this head by Prof. Whitney, in his ‘Oriental and Linguistic\r\nStudies,’ 1873, p. 354. He observes that the desire of communication\r\nbetween man is the living force, which, in the development of language,\r\n“works both consciously and unconsciously; consciously as regards the\r\nimmediate end to be attained; unconsciously as regards the further\r\nconsequences of the act.”) The sounds uttered by birds offer in several\r\nrespects the nearest analogy to language, for all the members of the\r\nsame species utter the same instinctive cries expressive of their\r\nemotions; and all the kinds which sing, exert their power\r\ninstinctively; but the actual song, and even the call-notes, are learnt\r\nfrom their parents or foster-parents. These sounds, as Daines\r\nBarrington (54. Hon. Daines Barrington in ‘Philosoph. Transactions,’\r\n1773, p. 262. See also Dureau de la Malle, in ‘Ann. des. Sc. Nat.’ 3rd\r\nseries, Zoolog., tom. x. p. 119.) has proved, “are no more innate than\r\nlanguage is in man.” The first attempts to sing “may be compared to the\r\nimperfect endeavour in a child to babble.” The young males continue\r\npractising, or as the bird-catchers say, “recording,” for ten or eleven\r\nmonths. Their first essays shew hardly a rudiment of the future song;\r\nbut as they grow older we can perceive what they are aiming at; and at\r\nlast they are said “to sing their song round.” Nestlings which have\r\nlearnt the song of a distinct species, as with the canary-birds\r\neducated in the Tyrol, teach and transmit their new song to their\r\noffspring. The slight natural differences of song in the same species\r\ninhabiting different districts may be appositely compared, as\r\nBarrington remarks, “to provincial dialects”; and the songs of allied,\r\nthough distinct species may be compared with the languages of distinct\r\nraces of man. I have given the foregoing details to shew that an\r\ninstinctive tendency to acquire an art is not peculiar to man.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of articulate language, after having read on\r\nthe one side the highly interesting works of Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood,\r\nthe Rev. F. Farrar, and Prof. Schleicher (55. ‘On the Origin of\r\nLanguage,’ by H. Wedgwood, 1866. ‘Chapters on Language,’ by the Rev.\r\nF.W. Farrar, 1865. These works are most interesting. See also ‘De la\r\nPhys. et de Parole,’ par Albert Lemoine, 1865, p. 190. The work on this\r\nsubject, by the late Prof. Aug. Schleicher, has been translated by Dr.\r\nBikkers into English, under the title of ‘Darwinism tested by the\r\nScience of Language,’ 1869.), and the celebrated lectures of Prof. Max\r\nMuller on the other side, I cannot doubt that language owes its origin\r\nto the imitation and modification of various natural sounds, the voices\r\nof other animals, and man’s own instinctive cries, aided by signs and\r\ngestures. When we treat of sexual selection we shall see that primeval\r\nman, or rather some early progenitor of man, probably first used his\r\nvoice in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing, as do\r\nsome of the gibbon-apes at the present day; and we may conclude from a\r\nwidely-spread analogy, that this power would have been especially\r\nexerted during the courtship of the sexes,—would have expressed various\r\nemotions, such as love, jealousy, triumph,—and would have served as a\r\nchallenge to rivals. It is, therefore, probable that the imitation of\r\nmusical cries by articulate sounds may have given rise to words\r\nexpressive of various complex emotions. The strong tendency in our\r\nnearest allies, the monkeys, in microcephalous idiots (56. Vogt,\r\n‘Mémoire sur les Microcephales,’ 1867, p. 169. With respect to savages,\r\nI have given some facts in my ‘Journal of Researches,’ etc., 1845, p.\r\n206.), and in the barbarous races of mankind, to imitate whatever they\r\nhear deserves notice, as bearing on the subject of imitation. Since\r\nmonkeys certainly understand much that is said to them by man, and when\r\nwild, utter signal-cries of danger to their fellows (57. See clear\r\nevidence on this head in the two works so often quoted, by Brehm and\r\nRengger.); and since fowls give distinct warnings for danger on the\r\nground, or in the sky from hawks (both, as well as a third cry,\r\nintelligible to dogs) (58. Houzeau gives a very curious account of his\r\nobservations on this subject in his ‘Facultés Mentales des Animaux,’\r\ntom. ii. p. 348.), may not some unusually wise ape-like animal have\r\nimitated the growl of a beast of prey, and thus told his fellow-monkeys\r\nthe nature of the expected danger? This would have been a first step in\r\nthe formation of a language.\r\n\r\nAs the voice was used more and more, the vocal organs would have been\r\nstrengthened and perfected through the principle of the inherited\r\neffects of use; and this would have reacted on the power of speech. But\r\nthe relation between the continued use of language and the development\r\nof the brain, has no doubt been far more important. The mental powers\r\nin some early progenitor of man must have been more highly developed\r\nthan in any existing ape, before even the most imperfect form of speech\r\ncould have come into use; but we may confidently believe that the\r\ncontinued use and advancement of this power would have reacted on the\r\nmind itself, by enabling and encouraging it to carry on long trains of\r\nthought. A complex train of thought can no more be carried on without\r\nthe aid of words, whether spoken or silent, than a long calculation\r\nwithout the use of figures or algebra. It appears, also, that even an\r\nordinary train of thought almost requires, or is greatly facilitated by\r\nsome form of language, for the dumb, deaf, and blind girl, Laura\r\nBridgman, was observed to use her fingers whilst dreaming. (59. See\r\nremarks on this head by Dr. Maudsley, ‘The Physiology and Pathology of\r\nMind,’ 2nd ed., 1868, p. 199.) Nevertheless, a long succession of vivid\r\nand connected ideas may pass through the mind without the aid of any\r\nform of language, as we may infer from the movements of dogs during\r\ntheir dreams. We have, also, seen that animals are able to reason to a\r\ncertain extent, manifestly without the aid of language. The intimate\r\nconnection between the brain, as it is now developed in us, and the\r\nfaculty of speech, is well shewn by those curious cases of\r\nbrain-disease in which speech is specially affected, as when the power\r\nto remember substantives is lost, whilst other words can be correctly\r\nused, or where substantives of a certain class, or all except the\r\ninitial letters of substantives and proper names are forgotten. (60.\r\nMany curious cases have been recorded. See, for instance, Dr. Bateman\r\n‘On Aphasia,’ 1870, pp. 27, 31, 53, 100, etc. Also, ‘Inquiries\r\nConcerning the Intellectual Powers,’ by Dr. Abercrombie, 1838, p. 150.)\r\nThere is no more improbability in the continued use of the mental and\r\nvocal organs leading to inherited changes in their structure and\r\nfunctions, than in the case of hand-writing, which depends partly on\r\nthe form of the hand and partly on the disposition of the mind; and\r\nhandwriting is certainly inherited. (61. ‘The Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. p. 6.’)\r\n\r\nSeveral writers, more especially Prof. Max Muller (62. Lectures on ‘Mr.\r\nDarwin’s Philosophy of Language,’ 1873.), have lately insisted that the\r\nuse of language implies the power of forming general concepts; and that\r\nas no animals are supposed to possess this power, an impassable barrier\r\nis formed between them and man. (63. The judgment of a distinguished\r\nphilologist, such as Prof. Whitney, will have far more weight on this\r\npoint than anything that I can say. He remarks (‘Oriental and\r\nLinguistic Studies,’ 1873, p. 297), in speaking of Bleek’s views:\r\n“Because on the grand scale language is the necessary auxiliary of\r\nthought, indispensable to the development of the power of thinking, to\r\nthe distinctness and variety and complexity of cognitions to the full\r\nmastery of consciousness; therefore he would fain make thought\r\nabsolutely impossible without speech, identifying the faculty with its\r\ninstrument. He might just as reasonably assert that the human hand\r\ncannot act without a tool. With such a doctrine to start from, he\r\ncannot stop short of Max Muller’s worst paradoxes, that an infant (in\r\nfans, not speaking) is not a human being, and that deaf-mutes do not\r\nbecome possessed of reason until they learn to twist their fingers into\r\nimitation of spoken words.” Max Muller gives in italics (‘Lectures on\r\nMr. Darwin’s Philosophy of Language,’ 1873, third lecture) this\r\naphorism: “There is no thought without words, as little as there are\r\nwords without thought.” What a strange definition must here be given to\r\nthe word thought!) With respect to animals, I have already endeavoured\r\nto shew that they have this power, at least in a rude and incipient\r\ndegree. As far as concerns infants of from ten to eleven months old,\r\nand deaf-mutes, it seems to me incredible, that they should be able to\r\nconnect certain sounds with certain general ideas as quickly as they\r\ndo, unless such ideas were already formed in their minds. The same\r\nremark may be extended to the more intelligent animals; as Mr. Leslie\r\nStephen observes (64. ‘Essays on Free Thinking,’ etc., 1873, p. 82.),\r\n“A dog frames a general concept of cats or sheep, and knows the\r\ncorresponding words as well as a philosopher. And the capacity to\r\nunderstand is as good a proof of vocal intelligence, though in an\r\ninferior degree, as the capacity to speak.”\r\n\r\nWhy the organs now used for speech should have been originally\r\nperfected for this purpose, rather than any other organs, it is not\r\ndifficult to see. Ants have considerable powers of intercommunication\r\nby means of their antennae, as shewn by Huber, who devotes a whole\r\nchapter to their language. We might have used our fingers as efficient\r\ninstruments, for a person with practice can report to a deaf man every\r\nword of a speech rapidly delivered at a public meeting; but the loss of\r\nour hands, whilst thus employed, would have been a serious\r\ninconvenience. As all the higher mammals possess vocal organs,\r\nconstructed on the same general plan as ours, and used as a means of\r\ncommunication, it was obviously probable that these same organs would\r\nbe still further developed if the power of communication had to be\r\nimproved; and this has been effected by the aid of adjoining and well\r\nadapted parts, namely the tongue and lips. (65. See some good remarks\r\nto this effect by Dr. Maudsley, ‘The Physiology and Pathology of Mind,’\r\n1868, p. 199.) The fact of the higher apes not using their vocal organs\r\nfor speech, no doubt depends on their intelligence not having been\r\nsufficiently advanced. The possession by them of organs, which with\r\nlong-continued practice might have been used for speech, although not\r\nthus used, is paralleled by the case of many birds which possess organs\r\nfitted for singing, though they never sing. Thus, the nightingale and\r\ncrow have vocal organs similarly constructed, these being used by the\r\nformer for diversified song, and by the latter only for croaking. (66.\r\nMacgillivray, ‘Hist. of British Birds,’ vol. ii. 1839, p. 29. An\r\nexcellent observer, Mr. Blackwall, remarks that the magpie learns to\r\npronounce single words, and even short sentences, more readily than\r\nalmost any other British bird; yet, as he adds, after long and closely\r\ninvestigating its habits, he has never known it, in a state of nature,\r\ndisplay any unusual capacity for imitation. ‘Researches in Zoology,’\r\n1834, p. 158.) If it be asked why apes have not had their intellects\r\ndeveloped to the same degree as that of man, general causes only can be\r\nassigned in answer, and it is unreasonable to expect any thing more\r\ndefinite, considering our ignorance with respect to the successive\r\nstages of development through which each creature has passed.\r\n\r\nThe formation of different languages and of distinct species, and the\r\nproofs that both have been developed through a gradual process, are\r\ncuriously parallel. (67. See the very interesting parallelism between\r\nthe development of species and languages, given by Sir C. Lyell in ‘The\r\nGeological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man,’ 1863, chap. xxiii.) But\r\nwe can trace the formation of many words further back than that of\r\nspecies, for we can perceive how they actually arose from the imitation\r\nof various sounds. We find in distinct languages striking homologies\r\ndue to community of descent, and analogies due to a similar process of\r\nformation. The manner in which certain letters or sounds change when\r\nothers change is very like correlated growth. We have in both cases the\r\nreduplication of parts, the effects of long-continued use, and so\r\nforth. The frequent presence of rudiments, both in languages and in\r\nspecies, is still more remarkable. The letter m in the word am, means\r\nI; so that in the expression I am, a superfluous and useless rudiment\r\nhas been retained. In the spelling also of words, letters often remain\r\nas the rudiments of ancient forms of pronunciation. Languages, like\r\norganic beings, can be classed in groups under groups; and they can be\r\nclassed either naturally according to descent, or artificially by other\r\ncharacters. Dominant languages and dialects spread widely, and lead to\r\nthe gradual extinction of other tongues. A language, like a species,\r\nwhen once extinct, never, as Sir C. Lyell remarks, reappears. The same\r\nlanguage never has two birth-places. Distinct languages may be crossed\r\nor blended together. (68. See remarks to this effect by the Rev. F.W.\r\nFarrar, in an interesting article, entitled ‘Philology and Darwinism,’\r\nin ‘Nature,’ March 24th, 1870, p. 528.) We see variability in every\r\ntongue, and new words are continually cropping up; but as there is a\r\nlimit to the powers of the memory, single words, like whole languages,\r\ngradually become extinct. As Max Muller (69. ‘Nature,’ January 6th,\r\n1870, p. 257.) has well remarked:—“A struggle for life is constantly\r\ngoing on amongst the words and grammatical forms in each language. The\r\nbetter, the shorter, the easier forms are constantly gaining the upper\r\nhand, and they owe their success to their own inherent virtue.” To\r\nthese more important causes of the survival of certain words, mere\r\nnovelty and fashion may be added; for there is in the mind of man a\r\nstrong love for slight changes in all things. The survival or\r\npreservation of certain favoured words in the struggle for existence is\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nThe perfectly regular and wonderfully complex construction of the\r\nlanguages of many barbarous nations has often been advanced as a proof,\r\neither of the divine origin of these languages, or of the high art and\r\nformer civilisation of their founders. Thus F. von Schlegel writes: “In\r\nthose languages which appear to be at the lowest grade of intellectual\r\nculture, we frequently observe a very high and elaborate degree of art\r\nin their grammatical structure. This is especially the case with the\r\nBasque and the Lapponian, and many of the American languages.” (70.\r\nQuoted by C.S. Wake, ‘Chapters on Man,’ 1868, p. 101.) But it is\r\nassuredly an error to speak of any language as an art, in the sense of\r\nits having been elaborately and methodically formed. Philologists now\r\nadmit that conjugations, declensions, etc., originally existed as\r\ndistinct words, since joined together; and as such words express the\r\nmost obvious relations between objects and persons, it is not\r\nsurprising that they should have been used by the men of most races\r\nduring the earliest ages. With respect to perfection, the following\r\nillustration will best shew how easily we may err: a Crinoid sometimes\r\nconsists of no less than 150,000 pieces of shell (71. Buckland,\r\n‘Bridgewater Treatise,’ p. 411.), all arranged with perfect symmetry in\r\nradiating lines; but a naturalist does not consider an animal of this\r\nkind as more perfect than a bilateral one with comparatively few parts,\r\nand with none of these parts alike, excepting on the opposite sides of\r\nthe body. He justly considers the differentiation and specialisation of\r\norgans as the test of perfection. So with languages: the most\r\nsymmetrical and complex ought not to be ranked above irregular,\r\nabbreviated, and bastardised languages, which have borrowed expressive\r\nwords and useful forms of construction from various conquering,\r\nconquered, or immigrant races.\r\n\r\nFrom these few and imperfect remarks I conclude that the extremely\r\ncomplex and regular construction of many barbarous languages, is no\r\nproof that they owe their origin to a special act of creation. (72. See\r\nsome good remarks on the simplification of languages, by Sir J.\r\nLubbock, ‘Origin of Civilisation,’ 1870, p. 278.) Nor, as we have seen,\r\ndoes the faculty of articulate speech in itself offer any insuperable\r\nobjection to the belief that man has been developed from some lower\r\nform.\r\n\r\nSENSE OF BEAUTY.\r\n\r\nThis sense has been declared to be peculiar to man. I refer here only\r\nto the pleasure given by certain colours, forms, and sounds, and which\r\nmay fairly be called a sense of the beautiful; with cultivated men such\r\nsensations are, however, intimately associated with complex ideas and\r\ntrains of thought. When we behold a male bird elaborately displaying\r\nhis graceful plumes or splendid colours before the female, whilst other\r\nbirds, not thus decorated, make no such display, it is impossible to\r\ndoubt that she admires the beauty of her male partner. As women\r\neverywhere deck themselves with these plumes, the beauty of such\r\nornaments cannot be disputed. As we shall see later, the nests of\r\nhumming-birds, and the playing passages of bower-birds are tastefully\r\nornamented with gaily-coloured objects; and this shews that they must\r\nreceive some kind of pleasure from the sight of such things. With the\r\ngreat majority of animals, however, the taste for the beautiful is\r\nconfined, as far as we can judge, to the attractions of the opposite\r\nsex. The sweet strains poured forth by many male birds during the\r\nseason of love, are certainly admired by the females, of which fact\r\nevidence will hereafter be given. If female birds had been incapable of\r\nappreciating the beautiful colours, the ornaments, and voices of their\r\nmale partners, all the labour and anxiety exhibited by the latter in\r\ndisplaying their charms before the females would have been thrown away;\r\nand this it is impossible to admit. Why certain bright colours should\r\nexcite pleasure cannot, I presume, be explained, any more than why\r\ncertain flavours and scents are agreeable; but habit has something to\r\ndo with the result, for that which is at first unpleasant to our\r\nsenses, ultimately becomes pleasant, and habits are inherited. With\r\nrespect to sounds, Helmholtz has explained to a certain extent on\r\nphysiological principles, why harmonies and certain cadences are\r\nagreeable. But besides this, sounds frequently recurring at irregular\r\nintervals are highly disagreeable, as every one will admit who has\r\nlistened at night to the irregular flapping of a rope on board ship.\r\nThe same principle seems to come into play with vision, as the eye\r\nprefers symmetry or figures with some regular recurrence. Patterns of\r\nthis kind are employed by even the lowest savages as ornaments; and\r\nthey have been developed through sexual selection for the adornment of\r\nsome male animals. Whether we can or not give any reason for the\r\npleasure thus derived from vision and hearing, yet man and many of the\r\nlower animals are alike pleased by the same colours, graceful shading\r\nand forms, and the same sounds.\r\n\r\nThe taste for the beautiful, at least as far as female beauty is\r\nconcerned, is not of a special nature in the human mind; for it differs\r\nwidely in the different races of man, and is not quite the same even in\r\nthe different nations of the same race. Judging from the hideous\r\nornaments, and the equally hideous music admired by most savages, it\r\nmight be urged that their aesthetic faculty was not so highly developed\r\nas in certain animals, for instance, as in birds. Obviously no animal\r\nwould be capable of admiring such scenes as the heavens at night, a\r\nbeautiful landscape, or refined music; but such high tastes are\r\nacquired through culture, and depend on complex associations; they are\r\nnot enjoyed by barbarians or by uneducated persons.\r\n\r\nMany of the faculties, which have been of inestimable service to man\r\nfor his progressive advancement, such as the powers of the imagination,\r\nwonder, curiosity, an undefined sense of beauty, a tendency to\r\nimitation, and the love of excitement or novelty, could hardly fail to\r\nlead to capricious changes of customs and fashions. I have alluded to\r\nthis point, because a recent writer (73. ‘The Spectator,’ Dec. 4th,\r\n1869, p. 1430.) has oddly fixed on Caprice “as one of the most\r\nremarkable and typical differences between savages and brutes.” But not\r\nonly can we partially understand how it is that man is from various\r\nconflicting influences rendered capricious, but that the lower animals\r\nare, as we shall hereafter see, likewise capricious in their\r\naffections, aversions, and sense of beauty. There is also reason to\r\nsuspect that they love novelty, for its own sake.\r\n\r\nBELIEF IN GOD—RELIGION.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the\r\nennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God. On the contrary\r\nthere is ample evidence, derived not from hasty travellers, but from\r\nmen who have long resided with savages, that numerous races have\r\nexisted, and still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and who\r\nhave no words in their languages to express such an idea. (74. See an\r\nexcellent article on this subject by the Rev. F.W. Farrar, in the\r\n‘Anthropological Review,’ Aug. 1864, p. ccxvii. For further facts see\r\nSir J. Lubbock, ‘Prehistoric Times,’ 2nd edit., 1869, p. 564; and\r\nespecially the chapters on Religion in his ‘Origin of Civilisation,’\r\n1870.) The question is of course wholly distinct from that higher one,\r\nwhether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe; and this has\r\nbeen answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that\r\nhave ever existed.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we include under the term “religion” the belief in unseen\r\nor spiritual agencies, the case is wholly different; for this belief\r\nseems to be universal with the less civilised races. Nor is it\r\ndifficult to comprehend how it arose. As soon as the important\r\nfaculties of the imagination, wonder, and curiosity, together with some\r\npower of reasoning, had become partially developed, man would naturally\r\ncrave to understand what was passing around him, and would have vaguely\r\nspeculated on his own existence. As Mr. M’Lennan (75. ‘The Worship of\r\nAnimals and Plants,’ in the ‘Fortnightly Review,’ Oct. 1, 1869, p.\r\n422.) has remarked, “Some explanation of the phenomena of life, a man\r\nmust feign for himself, and to judge from the universality of it, the\r\nsimplest hypothesis, and the first to occur to men, seems to have been\r\nthat natural phenomena are ascribable to the presence in animals,\r\nplants, and things, and in the forces of nature, of such spirits\r\nprompting to action as men are conscious they themselves possess.” It\r\nis also probable, as Mr. Tylor has shewn, that dreams may have first\r\ngiven rise to the notion of spirits; for savages do not readily\r\ndistinguish between subjective and objective impressions. When a savage\r\ndreams, the figures which appear before him are believed to have come\r\nfrom a distance, and to stand over him; or “the soul of the dreamer\r\ngoes out on its travels, and comes home with a remembrance of what it\r\nhas seen.” (76. Tylor, ‘Early History of Mankind,’ 1865, p. 6. See also\r\nthe three striking chapters on the ‘Development of Religion,’ in\r\nLubbock’s ‘Origin of Civilisation,’ 1870. In a like manner Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer, in his ingenious essay in the ‘Fortnightly Review’ (May 1st,\r\n1870, p. 535), accounts for the earliest forms of religious belief\r\nthroughout the world, by man being led through dreams, shadows, and\r\nother causes, to look at himself as a double essence, corporeal and\r\nspiritual. As the spiritual being is supposed to exist after death and\r\nto be powerful, it is propitiated by various gifts and ceremonies, and\r\nits aid invoked. He then further shews that names or nicknames given\r\nfrom some animal or other object, to the early progenitors or founders\r\nof a tribe, are supposed after a long interval to represent the real\r\nprogenitor of the tribe; and such animal or object is then naturally\r\nbelieved still to exist as a spirit, is held sacred, and worshipped as\r\na god. Nevertheless I cannot but suspect that there is a still earlier\r\nand ruder stage, when anything which manifests power or movement is\r\nthought to be endowed with some form of life, and with mental faculties\r\nanalogous to our own.) But until the faculties of imagination,\r\ncuriosity, reason, etc., had been fairly well developed in the mind of\r\nman, his dreams would not have led him to believe in spirits, any more\r\nthan in the case of a dog.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in savages to imagine that natural objects and agencies\r\nare animated by spiritual or living essences, is perhaps illustrated by\r\na little fact which I once noticed: my dog, a full-grown and very\r\nsensible animal, was lying on the lawn during a hot and still day; but\r\nat a little distance a slight breeze occasionally moved an open\r\nparasol, which would have been wholly disregarded by the dog, had any\r\none stood near it. As it was, every time that the parasol slightly\r\nmoved, the dog growled fiercely and barked. He must, I think, have\r\nreasoned to himself in a rapid and unconscious manner, that movement\r\nwithout any apparent cause indicated the presence of some strange\r\nliving agent, and that no stranger had a right to be on his territory.\r\n\r\nThe belief in spiritual agencies would easily pass into the belief in\r\nthe existence of one or more gods. For savages would naturally\r\nattribute to spirits the same passions, the same love of vengeance or\r\nsimplest form of justice, and the same affections which they themselves\r\nfeel. The Fuegians appear to be in this respect in an intermediate\r\ncondition, for when the surgeon on board the “Beagle” shot some young\r\nducklings as specimens, York Minster declared in the most solemn\r\nmanner, “Oh, Mr. Bynoe, much rain, much snow, blow much”; and this was\r\nevidently a retributive punishment for wasting human food. So again he\r\nrelated how, when his brother killed a “wild man,” storms long raged,\r\nmuch rain and snow fell. Yet we could never discover that the Fuegians\r\nbelieved in what we should call a God, or practised any religious\r\nrites; and Jemmy Button, with justifiable pride, stoutly maintained\r\nthat there was no devil in his land. This latter assertion is the more\r\nremarkable, as with savages the belief in bad spirits is far more\r\ncommon than that in good ones.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of religious devotion is a highly complex one, consisting\r\nof love, complete submission to an exalted and mysterious superior, a\r\nstrong sense of dependence (77. See an able article on the ‘Physical\r\nElements of Religion,’ by Mr. L. Owen Pike, in ‘Anthropological\r\nReview,’ April 1870, p. lxiii.), fear, reverence, gratitude, hope for\r\nthe future, and perhaps other elements. No being could experience so\r\ncomplex an emotion until advanced in his intellectual and moral\r\nfaculties to at least a moderately high level. Nevertheless, we see\r\nsome distant approach to this state of mind in the deep love of a dog\r\nfor his master, associated with complete submission, some fear, and\r\nperhaps other feelings. The behaviour of a dog when returning to his\r\nmaster after an absence, and, as I may add, of a monkey to his beloved\r\nkeeper, is widely different from that towards their fellows. In the\r\nlatter case the transports of joy appear to be somewhat less, and the\r\nsense of equality is shewn in every action. Professor Braubach goes so\r\nfar as to maintain that a dog looks on his master as on a god. (78.\r\n‘Religion, Moral, etc., der Darwin’schen Art-Lehre,’ 1869, s. 53. It is\r\nsaid (Dr. W. Lauder Lindsay, ‘Journal of Mental Science,’ 1871, p. 43),\r\nthat Bacon long ago, and the poet Burns, held the same notion.)\r\n\r\nThe same high mental faculties which first led man to believe in unseen\r\nspiritual agencies, then in fetishism, polytheism, and ultimately in\r\nmonotheism, would infallibly lead him, as long as his reasoning powers\r\nremained poorly developed, to various strange superstitions and\r\ncustoms. Many of these are terrible to think of—such as the sacrifice\r\nof human beings to a blood-loving god; the trial of innocent persons by\r\nthe ordeal of poison or fire; witchcraft, etc.—yet it is well\r\noccasionally to reflect on these superstitions, for they shew us what\r\nan infinite debt of gratitude we owe to the improvement of our reason,\r\nto science, and to our accumulated knowledge. As Sir J. Lubbock (79.\r\n‘Prehistoric Times,’ 2nd edit., p. 571. In this work (p. 571) there\r\nwill be found an excellent account of the many strange and capricious\r\ncustoms of savages.) has well observed, “it is not too much to say that\r\nthe horrible dread of unknown evil hangs like a thick cloud over savage\r\nlife, and embitters every pleasure.” These miserable and indirect\r\nconsequences of our highest faculties may be compared with the\r\nincidental and occasional mistakes of the instincts of the lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE MENTAL POWERS OF MAN AND THE LOWER ANIMALS—continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moral sense—Fundamental proposition—The qualities of social\r\nanimals—Origin of sociability—Struggle between opposed instincts—Man a\r\nsocial animal—The more enduring social instincts conquer other less\r\npersistent instincts—The social virtues alone regarded by savages—The\r\nself-regarding virtues acquired at a later stage of development—The\r\nimportance of the judgment of the members of the same community on\r\nconduct—Transmission of moral tendencies—Summary.\r\n\r\nI fully subscribe to the judgment of those writers (1. See, for\r\ninstance, on this subject, Quatrefages, ‘Unité de l’Espèce Humaine,’\r\n1861, p. 21, etc.) who maintain that of all the differences between man\r\nand the lower animals, the moral sense or conscience is by far the most\r\nimportant. This sense, as Mackintosh (2. ‘Dissertation on Ethical\r\nPhilosophy,’ 1837, p. 231, etc.) remarks, “has a rightful supremacy\r\nover every other principle of human action”; it is summed up in that\r\nshort but imperious word “ought,” so full of high significance. It is\r\nthe most noble of all the attributes of man, leading him without a\r\nmoment’s hesitation to risk his life for that of a fellow-creature; or\r\nafter due deliberation, impelled simply by the deep feeling of right or\r\nduty, to sacrifice it in some great cause. Immanuel Kant exclaims,\r\n“Duty! Wondrous thought, that workest neither by fond insinuation,\r\nflattery, nor by any threat, but merely by holding up thy naked law in\r\nthe soul, and so extorting for thyself always reverence, if not always\r\nobedience; before whom all appetites are dumb, however secretly they\r\nrebel; whence thy original?” (3. ‘Metaphysics of Ethics,’ translated by\r\nJ.W. Semple, Edinburgh, 1836, p. 136.)\r\n\r\nThis great question has been discussed by many writers (4. Mr. Bain\r\ngives a list (‘Mental and Moral Science,’ 1868, pp. 543-725) of\r\ntwenty-six British authors who have written on this subject, and whose\r\nnames are familiar to every reader; to these, Mr. Bain’s own name, and\r\nthose of Mr. Lecky, Mr. Shadworth Hodgson, Sir J. Lubbock, and others,\r\nmight be added.) of consummate ability; and my sole excuse for touching\r\non it, is the impossibility of here passing it over; and because, as\r\nfar as I know, no one has approached it exclusively from the side of\r\nnatural history. The investigation possesses, also, some independent\r\ninterest, as an attempt to see how far the study of the lower animals\r\nthrows light on one of the highest psychical faculties of man.\r\n\r\nThe following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable—namely,\r\nthat any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts (5.\r\nSir B. Brodie, after observing that man is a social animal\r\n(‘Psychological Enquiries,’ 1854, p. 192), asks the pregnant question,\r\n“ought not this to settle the disputed question as to the existence of\r\na moral sense?” Similar ideas have probably occurred to many persons,\r\nas they did long ago to Marcus Aurelius. Mr. J.S. Mill speaks, in his\r\ncelebrated work, ‘Utilitarianism,’ (1864, pp. 45, 46), of the social\r\nfeelings as a “powerful natural sentiment,” and as “the natural basis\r\nof sentiment for utilitarian morality.” Again he says, “Like the other\r\nacquired capacities above referred to, the moral faculty, if not a part\r\nof our nature, is a natural out-growth from it; capable, like them, in\r\na certain small degree of springing up spontaneously.” But in\r\nopposition to all this, he also remarks, “if, as in my own belief, the\r\nmoral feelings are not innate, but acquired, they are not for that\r\nreason less natural.” It is with hesitation that I venture to differ at\r\nall from so profound a thinker, but it can hardly be disputed that the\r\nsocial feelings are instinctive or innate in the lower animals; and why\r\nshould they not be so in man? Mr. Bain (see, for instance, ‘The\r\nEmotions and the Will,’ 1865, p. 481) and others believe that the moral\r\nsense is acquired by each individual during his lifetime. On the\r\ngeneral theory of evolution this is at least extremely improbable. The\r\nignoring of all transmitted mental qualities will, as it seems to me,\r\nbe hereafter judged as a most serious blemish in the works of Mr.\r\nMill.), the parental and filial affections being here included, would\r\ninevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its\r\nintellectual powers had become as well, or nearly as well developed, as\r\nin man. For, FIRSTLY, the social instincts lead an animal to take\r\npleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of\r\nsympathy with them, and to perform various services for them. The\r\nservices may be of a definite and evidently instinctive nature; or\r\nthere may be only a wish and readiness, as with most of the higher\r\nsocial animals, to aid their fellows in certain general ways. But these\r\nfeelings and services are by no means extended to all the individuals\r\nof the same species, only to those of the same association. SECONDLY,\r\nas soon as the mental faculties had become highly developed, images of\r\nall past actions and motives would be incessantly passing through the\r\nbrain of each individual: and that feeling of dissatisfaction, or even\r\nmisery, which invariably results, as we shall hereafter see, from any\r\nunsatisfied instinct, would arise, as often as it was perceived that\r\nthe enduring and always present social instinct had yielded to some\r\nother instinct, at the time stronger, but neither enduring in its\r\nnature, nor leaving behind it a very vivid impression. It is clear that\r\nmany instinctive desires, such as that of hunger, are in their nature\r\nof short duration; and after being satisfied, are not readily or\r\nvividly recalled. THIRDLY, after the power of language had been\r\nacquired, and the wishes of the community could be expressed, the\r\ncommon opinion how each member ought to act for the public good, would\r\nnaturally become in a paramount degree the guide to action. But it\r\nshould be borne in mind that however great weight we may attribute to\r\npublic opinion, our regard for the approbation and disapprobation of\r\nour fellows depends on sympathy, which, as we shall see, forms an\r\nessential part of the social instinct, and is indeed its\r\nfoundation-stone. LASTLY, habit in the individual would ultimately play\r\na very important part in guiding the conduct of each member; for the\r\nsocial instinct, together with sympathy, is, like any other instinct,\r\ngreatly strengthened by habit, and so consequently would be obedience\r\nto the wishes and judgment of the community. These several subordinate\r\npropositions must now be discussed, and some of them at considerable\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIt may be well first to premise that I do not wish to maintain that any\r\nstrictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to become as\r\nactive and as highly developed as in man, would acquire exactly the\r\nsame moral sense as ours. In the same manner as various animals have\r\nsome sense of beauty, though they admire widely-different objects, so\r\nthey might have a sense of right and wrong, though led by it to follow\r\nwidely different lines of conduct. If, for instance, to take an extreme\r\ncase, men were reared under precisely the same conditions as hive-bees,\r\nthere can hardly be a doubt that our unmarried females would, like the\r\nworker-bees, think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers\r\nwould strive to kill their fertile daughters; and no one would think of\r\ninterfering. (6. Mr. H. Sidgwick remarks, in an able discussion on this\r\nsubject (the ‘Academy,’ June 15, 1872, p. 231), “a superior bee, we may\r\nfeel sure, would aspire to a milder solution of the population\r\nquestion.” Judging, however, from the habits of many or most savages,\r\nman solves the problem by female infanticide, polyandry and promiscuous\r\nintercourse; therefore it may well be doubted whether it would be by a\r\nmilder method. Miss Cobbe, in commenting (‘Darwinism in Morals,’\r\n‘Theological Review,’ April 1872, pp. 188-191) on the same\r\nillustration, says, the PRINCIPLES of social duty would be thus\r\nreversed; and by this, I presume, she means that the fulfilment of a\r\nsocial duty would tend to the injury of individuals; but she overlooks\r\nthe fact, which she would doubtless admit, that the instincts of the\r\nbee have been acquired for the good of the community. She goes so far\r\nas to say that if the theory of ethics advocated in this chapter were\r\never generally accepted, “I cannot but believe that in the hour of\r\ntheir triumph would be sounded the knell of the virtue of mankind!” It\r\nis to be hoped that the belief in the permanence of virtue on this\r\nearth is not held by many persons on so weak a tenure.) Nevertheless,\r\nthe bee, or any other social animal, would gain in our supposed case,\r\nas it appears to me, some feeling of right or wrong, or a conscience.\r\nFor each individual would have an inward sense of possessing certain\r\nstronger or more enduring instincts, and others less strong or\r\nenduring; so that there would often be a struggle as to which impulse\r\nshould be followed; and satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or even misery\r\nwould be felt, as past impressions were compared during their incessant\r\npassage through the mind. In this case an inward monitor would tell the\r\nanimal that it would have been better to have followed the one impulse\r\nrather than the other. The one course ought to have been followed, and\r\nthe other ought not; the one would have been right and the other wrong;\r\nbut to these terms I shall recur.\r\n\r\nSOCIABILITY.\r\n\r\nAnimals of many kinds are social; we find even distinct species living\r\ntogether; for example, some American monkeys; and united flocks of\r\nrooks, jackdaws, and starlings. Man shews the same feeling in his\r\nstrong love for the dog, which the dog returns with interest. Every one\r\nmust have noticed how miserable horses, dogs, sheep, etc., are when\r\nseparated from their companions, and what strong mutual affection the\r\ntwo former kinds, at least, shew on their reunion. It is curious to\r\nspeculate on the feelings of a dog, who will rest peacefully for hours\r\nin a room with his master or any of the family, without the least\r\nnotice being taken of him; but if left for a short time by himself,\r\nbarks or howls dismally. We will confine our attention to the higher\r\nsocial animals; and pass over insects, although some of these are\r\nsocial, and aid one another in many important ways. The most common\r\nmutual service in the higher animals is to warn one another of danger\r\nby means of the united senses of all. Every sportsman knows, as Dr.\r\nJaeger remarks (7. ‘Die Darwin’sche Theorie,’ s. 101.), how difficult\r\nit is to approach animals in a herd or troop. Wild horses and cattle do\r\nnot, I believe, make any danger-signal; but the attitude of any one of\r\nthem who first discovers an enemy, warns the others. Rabbits stamp\r\nloudly on the ground with their hind-feet as a signal: sheep and\r\nchamois do the same with their forefeet, uttering likewise a whistle.\r\nMany birds, and some mammals, post sentinels, which in the case of\r\nseals are said (8. Mr. R. Brown in ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1868, p. 409.)\r\ngenerally to be the females. The leader of a troop of monkeys acts as\r\nthe sentinel, and utters cries expressive both of danger and of safety.\r\n(9. Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. i. 1864, s. 52, 79. For the case of the\r\nmonkeys extracting thorns from each other, see s. 54. With respect to\r\nthe Hamadryas turning over stones, the fact is given (s. 76), on the\r\nevidence of Alvarez, whose observations Brehm thinks quite trustworthy.\r\nFor the cases of the old male baboons attacking the dogs, see s. 79;\r\nand with respect to the eagle, s. 56.) Social animals perform many\r\nlittle services for each other: horses nibble, and cows lick each\r\nother, on any spot which itches: monkeys search each other for external\r\nparasites; and Brehm states that after a troop of the Cercopithecus\r\ngriseo-viridis has rushed through a thorny brake, each monkey stretches\r\nitself on a branch, and another monkey sitting by, “conscientiously”\r\nexamines its fur, and extracts every thorn or burr.\r\n\r\nAnimals also render more important services to one another: thus wolves\r\nand some other beasts of prey hunt in packs, and aid one another in\r\nattacking their victims. Pelicans fish in concert. The Hamadryas\r\nbaboons turn over stones to find insects, etc.; and when they come to a\r\nlarge one, as many as can stand round, turn it over together and share\r\nthe booty. Social animals mutually defend each other. Bull bisons in N.\r\nAmerica, when there is danger, drive the cows and calves into the\r\nmiddle of the herd, whilst they defend the outside. I shall also in a\r\nfuture chapter give an account of two young wild bulls at Chillingham\r\nattacking an old one in concert, and of two stallions together trying\r\nto drive away a third stallion from a troop of mares. In Abyssinia,\r\nBrehm encountered a great troop of baboons who were crossing a valley:\r\nsome had already ascended the opposite mountain, and some were still in\r\nthe valley; the latter were attacked by the dogs, but the old males\r\nimmediately hurried down from the rocks, and with mouths widely opened,\r\nroared so fearfully, that the dogs quickly drew back. They were again\r\nencouraged to the attack; but by this time all the baboons had\r\nreascended the heights, excepting a young one, about six months old,\r\nwho, loudly calling for aid, climbed on a block of rock, and was\r\nsurrounded. Now one of the largest males, a true hero, came down again\r\nfrom the mountain, slowly went to the young one, coaxed him, and\r\ntriumphantly led him away—the dogs being too much astonished to make an\r\nattack. I cannot resist giving another scene which was witnessed by\r\nthis same naturalist; an eagle seized a young Cercopithecus, which, by\r\nclinging to a branch, was not at once carried off; it cried loudly for\r\nassistance, upon which the other members of the troop, with much\r\nuproar, rushed to the rescue, surrounded the eagle, and pulled out so\r\nmany feathers, that he no longer thought of his prey, but only how to\r\nescape. This eagle, as Brehm remarks, assuredly would never again\r\nattack a single monkey of a troop. (10. Mr. Belt gives the case of a\r\nspider-monkey (Ateles) in Nicaragua, which was heard screaming for\r\nnearly two hours in the forest, and was found with an eagle perched\r\nclose by it. The bird apparently feared to attack as long as it\r\nremained face to face; and Mr. Belt believes, from what he has seen of\r\nthe habits of these monkeys, that they protect themselves from eagles\r\nby keeping two or three together. ‘The Naturalist in Nicaragua,’ 1874,\r\np. 118.)\r\n\r\nIt is certain that associated animals have a feeling of love for each\r\nother, which is not felt by non-social adult animals. How far in most\r\ncases they actually sympathise in the pains and pleasures of others, is\r\nmore doubtful, especially with respect to pleasures. Mr. Buxton,\r\nhowever, who had excellent means of observation (11. ‘Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History,’ November 1868, p. 382.), states that his\r\nmacaws, which lived free in Norfolk, took “an extravagant interest” in\r\na pair with a nest; and whenever the female left it, she was surrounded\r\nby a troop “screaming horrible acclamations in her honour.” It is often\r\ndifficult to judge whether animals have any feeling for the sufferings\r\nof others of their kind. Who can say what cows feel, when they surround\r\nand stare intently on a dying or dead companion; apparently, however,\r\nas Houzeau remarks, they feel no pity. That animals sometimes are far\r\nfrom feeling any sympathy is too certain; for they will expel a wounded\r\nanimal from the herd, or gore or worry it to death. This is almost the\r\nblackest fact in natural history, unless, indeed, the explanation which\r\nhas been suggested is true, that their instinct or reason leads them to\r\nexpel an injured companion, lest beasts of prey, including man, should\r\nbe tempted to follow the troop. In this case their conduct is not much\r\nworse than that of the North American Indians, who leave their feeble\r\ncomrades to perish on the plains; or the Fijians, who, when their\r\nparents get old, or fall ill, bury them alive. (12. Sir J. Lubbock,\r\n‘Prehistoric Times,’ 2nd ed., p. 446.)\r\n\r\nMany animals, however, certainly sympathise with each other’s distress\r\nor danger. This is the case even with birds. Captain Stansbury (13. As\r\nquoted by Mr. L.H. Morgan, ‘The American Beaver,’ 1868, p. 272. Capt.\r\nStansbury also gives an interesting account of the manner in which a\r\nvery young pelican, carried away by a strong stream, was guided and\r\nencouraged in its attempts to reach the shore by half a dozen old\r\nbirds.) found on a salt lake in Utah an old and completely blind\r\npelican, which was very fat, and must have been well fed for a long\r\ntime by his companions. Mr. Blyth, as he informs me, saw Indian crows\r\nfeeding two or three of their companions which were blind; and I have\r\nheard of an analogous case with the domestic cock. We may, if we\r\nchoose, call these actions instinctive; but such cases are much too\r\nrare for the development of any special instinct. (14. As Mr. Bain\r\nstates, “effective aid to a sufferer springs from sympathy proper:”\r\n‘Mental and Moral Science,’ 1868, p. 245.) I have myself seen a dog,\r\nwho never passed a cat who lay sick in a basket, and was a great friend\r\nof his, without giving her a few licks with his tongue, the surest sign\r\nof kind feeling in a dog.\r\n\r\nIt must be called sympathy that leads a courageous dog to fly at any\r\none who strikes his master, as he certainly will. I saw a person\r\npretending to beat a lady, who had a very timid little dog on her lap,\r\nand the trial had never been made before; the little creature instantly\r\njumped away, but after the pretended beating was over, it was really\r\npathetic to see how perseveringly he tried to lick his mistress’s face,\r\nand comfort her. Brehm (15. ‘Thierleben,’ B. i. s. 85.) states that\r\nwhen a baboon in confinement was pursued to be punished, the others\r\ntried to protect him. It must have been sympathy in the cases above\r\ngiven which led the baboons and Cercopitheci to defend their young\r\ncomrades from the dogs and the eagle. I will give only one other\r\ninstance of sympathetic and heroic conduct, in the case of a little\r\nAmerican monkey. Several years ago a keeper at the Zoological Gardens\r\nshewed me some deep and scarcely healed wounds on the nape of his own\r\nneck, inflicted on him, whilst kneeling on the floor, by a fierce\r\nbaboon. The little American monkey, who was a warm friend of this\r\nkeeper, lived in the same large compartment, and was dreadfully afraid\r\nof the great baboon. Nevertheless, as soon as he saw his friend in\r\nperil, he rushed to the rescue, and by screams and bites so distracted\r\nthe baboon that the man was able to escape, after, as the surgeon\r\nthought, running great risk of his life.\r\n\r\nBesides love and sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities connected\r\nwith the social instincts, which in us would be called moral; and I\r\nagree with Agassiz (16. ‘De l’Espèce et de la Classe,’ 1869, p. 97.)\r\nthat dogs possess something very like a conscience.\r\n\r\nDogs possess some power of self-command, and this does not appear to be\r\nwholly the result of fear. As Braubach (17. ‘Die Darwin’sche\r\nArt-Lehre,’ 1869, s. 54.) remarks, they will refrain from stealing food\r\nin the absence of their master. They have long been accepted as the\r\nvery type of fidelity and obedience. But the elephant is likewise very\r\nfaithful to his driver or keeper, and probably considers him as the\r\nleader of the herd. Dr. Hooker informs me that an elephant, which he\r\nwas riding in India, became so deeply bogged that he remained stuck\r\nfast until the next day, when he was extricated by men with ropes.\r\nUnder such circumstances elephants will seize with their trunks any\r\nobject, dead or alive, to place under their knees, to prevent their\r\nsinking deeper in the mud; and the driver was dreadfully afraid lest\r\nthe animal should have seized Dr. Hooker and crushed him to death. But\r\nthe driver himself, as Dr. Hooker was assured, ran no risk. This\r\nforbearance under an emergency so dreadful for a heavy animal, is a\r\nwonderful proof of noble fidelity. (18. See also Hooker’s ‘Himalayan\r\nJournals,’ vol. ii. 1854, p. 333.)\r\n\r\nAll animals living in a body, which defend themselves or attack their\r\nenemies in concert, must indeed be in some degree faithful to one\r\nanother; and those that follow a leader must be in some degree\r\nobedient. When the baboons in Abyssinia (19. Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. i.\r\ns. 76.) plunder a garden, they silently follow their leader; and if an\r\nimprudent young animal makes a noise, he receives a slap from the\r\nothers to teach him silence and obedience. Mr. Galton, who has had\r\nexcellent opportunities for observing the half-wild cattle in S.\r\nAfrica, says (20. See his extremely interesting paper on\r\n‘Gregariousness in Cattle, and in Man,’ ‘Macmillan’s Magazine,’ Feb.\r\n1871, p. 353.), that they cannot endure even a momentary separation\r\nfrom the herd. They are essentially slavish, and accept the common\r\ndetermination, seeking no better lot than to be led by any one ox who\r\nhas enough self-reliance to accept the position. The men who break in\r\nthese animals for harness, watch assiduously for those who, by grazing\r\napart, shew a self-reliant disposition, and these they train as\r\nfore-oxen. Mr. Galton adds that such animals are rare and valuable; and\r\nif many were born they would soon be eliminated, as lions are always on\r\nthe look-out for the individuals which wander from the herd.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the impulse which leads certain animals to associate\r\ntogether, and to aid one another in many ways, we may infer that in\r\nmost cases they are impelled by the same sense of satisfaction or\r\npleasure which they experience in performing other instinctive actions;\r\nor by the same sense of dissatisfaction as when other instinctive\r\nactions are checked. We see this in innumerable instances, and it is\r\nillustrated in a striking manner by the acquired instincts of our\r\ndomesticated animals; thus a young shepherd-dog delights in driving and\r\nrunning round a flock of sheep, but not in worrying them; a young\r\nfox-hound delights in hunting a fox, whilst some other kinds of dogs,\r\nas I have witnessed, utterly disregard foxes. What a strong feeling of\r\ninward satisfaction must impel a bird, so full of activity, to brood\r\nday after day over her eggs. Migratory birds are quite miserable if\r\nstopped from migrating; perhaps they enjoy starting on their long\r\nflight; but it is hard to believe that the poor pinioned goose,\r\ndescribed by Audubon, which started on foot at the proper time for its\r\njourney of probably more than a thousand miles, could have felt any joy\r\nin doing so. Some instincts are determined solely by painful feelings,\r\nas by fear, which leads to self-preservation, and is in some cases\r\ndirected towards special enemies. No one, I presume, can analyse the\r\nsensations of pleasure or pain. In many instances, however, it is\r\nprobable that instincts are persistently followed from the mere force\r\nof inheritance, without the stimulus of either pleasure or pain. A\r\nyoung pointer, when it first scents game, apparently cannot help\r\npointing. A squirrel in a cage who pats the nuts which it cannot eat,\r\nas if to bury them in the ground, can hardly be thought to act thus,\r\neither from pleasure or pain. Hence the common assumption that men must\r\nbe impelled to every action by experiencing some pleasure or pain may\r\nbe erroneous. Although a habit may be blindly and implicitly followed,\r\nindependently of any pleasure or pain felt at the moment, yet if it be\r\nforcibly and abruptly checked, a vague sense of dissatisfaction is\r\ngenerally experienced.\r\n\r\nIt has often been assumed that animals were in the first place rendered\r\nsocial, and that they feel as a consequence uncomfortable when\r\nseparated from each other, and comfortable whilst together; but it is a\r\nmore probable view that these sensations were first developed, in order\r\nthat those animals which would profit by living in society, should be\r\ninduced to live together, in the same manner as the sense of hunger and\r\nthe pleasure of eating were, no doubt, first acquired in order to\r\ninduce animals to eat. The feeling of pleasure from society is probably\r\nan extension of the parental or filial affections, since the social\r\ninstinct seems to be developed by the young remaining for a long time\r\nwith their parents; and this extension may be attributed in part to\r\nhabit, but chiefly to natural selection. With those animals which were\r\nbenefited by living in close association, the individuals which took\r\nthe greatest pleasure in society would best escape various dangers,\r\nwhilst those that cared least for their comrades, and lived solitary,\r\nwould perish in greater numbers. With respect to the origin of the\r\nparental and filial affections, which apparently lie at the base of the\r\nsocial instincts, we know not the steps by which they have been gained;\r\nbut we may infer that it has been to a large extent through natural\r\nselection. So it has almost certainly been with the unusual and\r\nopposite feeling of hatred between the nearest relations, as with the\r\nworker-bees which kill their brother drones, and with the queen-bees\r\nwhich kill their daughter-queens; the desire to destroy their nearest\r\nrelations having been in this case of service to the community.\r\nParental affection, or some feeling which replaces it, has been\r\ndeveloped in certain animals extremely low in the scale, for example,\r\nin star-fishes and spiders. It is also occasionally present in a few\r\nmembers alone in a whole group of animals, as in the genus Forficula,\r\nor earwigs.\r\n\r\nThe all-important emotion of sympathy is distinct from that of love. A\r\nmother may passionately love her sleeping and passive infant, but she\r\ncan hardly at such times be said to feel sympathy for it. The love of a\r\nman for his dog is distinct from sympathy, and so is that of a dog for\r\nhis master. Adam Smith formerly argued, as has Mr. Bain recently, that\r\nthe basis of sympathy lies in our strong retentiveness of former states\r\nof pain or pleasure. Hence, “the sight of another person enduring\r\nhunger, cold, fatigue, revives in us some recollection of these states,\r\nwhich are painful even in idea.” We are thus impelled to relieve the\r\nsufferings of another, in order that our own painful feelings may be at\r\nthe same time relieved. In like manner we are led to participate in the\r\npleasures of others. (21. See the first and striking chapter in Adam\r\nSmith’s ‘Theory of Moral Sentiments.’ Also ‘Mr. Bain’s Mental and Moral\r\nScience,’ 1868, pp. 244, and 275-282. Mr. Bain states, that, “sympathy\r\nis, indirectly, a source of pleasure to the sympathiser”; and he\r\naccounts for this through reciprocity. He remarks that “the person\r\nbenefited, or others in his stead, may make up, by sympathy and good\r\noffices returned, for all the sacrifice.” But if, as appears to be the\r\ncase, sympathy is strictly an instinct, its exercise would give direct\r\npleasure, in the same manner as the exercise, as before remarked, of\r\nalmost every other instinct.) But I cannot see how this view explains\r\nthe fact that sympathy is excited, in an immeasurably stronger degree,\r\nby a beloved, than by an indifferent person. The mere sight of\r\nsuffering, independently of love, would suffice to call up in us vivid\r\nrecollections and associations. The explanation may lie in the fact\r\nthat, with all animals, sympathy is directed solely towards the members\r\nof the same community, and therefore towards known, and more or less\r\nbeloved members, but not to all the individuals of the same species.\r\nThis fact is not more surprising than that the fears of many animals\r\nshould be directed against special enemies. Species which are not\r\nsocial, such as lions and tigers, no doubt feel sympathy for the\r\nsuffering of their own young, but not for that of any other animal.\r\nWith mankind, selfishness, experience, and imitation, probably add, as\r\nMr. Bain has shewn, to the power of sympathy; for we are led by the\r\nhope of receiving good in return to perform acts of sympathetic\r\nkindness to others; and sympathy is much strengthened by habit. In\r\nhowever complex a manner this feeling may have originated, as it is one\r\nof high importance to all those animals which aid and defend one\r\nanother, it will have been increased through natural selection; for\r\nthose communities, which included the greatest number of the most\r\nsympathetic members, would flourish best, and rear the greatest number\r\nof offspring.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, impossible to decide in many cases whether certain\r\nsocial instincts have been acquired through natural selection, or are\r\nthe indirect result of other instincts and faculties, such as sympathy,\r\nreason, experience, and a tendency to imitation; or again, whether they\r\nare simply the result of long-continued habit. So remarkable an\r\ninstinct as the placing sentinels to warn the community of danger, can\r\nhardly have been the indirect result of any of these faculties; it\r\nmust, therefore, have been directly acquired. On the other hand, the\r\nhabit followed by the males of some social animals of defending the\r\ncommunity, and of attacking their enemies or their prey in concert, may\r\nperhaps have originated from mutual sympathy; but courage, and in most\r\ncases strength, must have been previously acquired, probably through\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nOf the various instincts and habits, some are much stronger than\r\nothers; that is, some either give more pleasure in their performance,\r\nand more distress in their prevention, than others; or, which is\r\nprobably quite as important, they are, through inheritance, more\r\npersistently followed, without exciting any special feeling of pleasure\r\nor pain. We are ourselves conscious that some habits are much more\r\ndifficult to cure or change than others. Hence a struggle may often be\r\nobserved in animals between different instincts, or between an instinct\r\nand some habitual disposition; as when a dog rushes after a hare, is\r\nrebuked, pauses, hesitates, pursues again, or returns ashamed to his\r\nmaster; or as between the love of a female dog for her young puppies\r\nand for her master,—for she may be seen to slink away to them, as if\r\nhalf ashamed of not accompanying her master. But the most curious\r\ninstance known to me of one instinct getting the better of another, is\r\nthe migratory instinct conquering the maternal instinct. The former is\r\nwonderfully strong; a confined bird will at the proper season beat her\r\nbreast against the wires of her cage, until it is bare and bloody. It\r\ncauses young salmon to leap out of the fresh water, in which they could\r\ncontinue to exist, and thus unintentionally to commit suicide. Every\r\none knows how strong the maternal instinct is, leading even timid birds\r\nto face great danger, though with hesitation, and in opposition to the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation. Nevertheless, the migratory instinct is\r\nso powerful, that late in the autumn swallows, house-martins, and\r\nswifts frequently desert their tender young, leaving them to perish\r\nmiserably in their nests. (22. This fact, the Rev. L. Jenyns states\r\n(see his edition of ‘White’s Nat. Hist. of Selborne,’ 1853, p. 204) was\r\nfirst recorded by the illustrious Jenner, in ‘Phil. Transact.’ 1824,\r\nand has since been confirmed by several observers, especially by Mr.\r\nBlackwall. This latter careful observer examined, late in the autumn,\r\nduring two years, thirty-six nests; he found that twelve contained\r\nyoung dead birds, five contained eggs on the point of being hatched,\r\nand three, eggs not nearly hatched. Many birds, not yet old enough for\r\na prolonged flight, are likewise deserted and left behind. See\r\nBlackwall, ‘Researches in Zoology,’ 1834, pp. 108, 118. For some\r\nadditional evidence, although this is not wanted, see Leroy, ‘Lettres\r\nPhil.’ 1802, p. 217. For Swifts, Gould’s ‘Introduction to the Birds of\r\nGreat Britain,’ 1823, p. 5. Similar cases have been observed in Canada\r\nby Mr. Adams; ‘Pop. Science Review,’ July 1873, p. 283.)\r\n\r\nWe can perceive that an instinctive impulse, if it be in any way more\r\nbeneficial to a species than some other or opposed instinct, would be\r\nrendered the more potent of the two through natural selection; for the\r\nindividuals which had it most strongly developed would survive in\r\nlarger numbers. Whether this is the case with the migratory in\r\ncomparison with the maternal instinct, may be doubted. The great\r\npersistence, or steady action of the former at certain seasons of the\r\nyear during the whole day, may give it for a time paramount force.\r\n\r\nMAN A SOCIAL ANIMAL.\r\n\r\nEvery one will admit that man is a social being. We see this in his\r\ndislike of solitude, and in his wish for society beyond that of his own\r\nfamily. Solitary confinement is one of the severest punishments which\r\ncan be inflicted. Some authors suppose that man primevally lived in\r\nsingle families; but at the present day, though single families, or\r\nonly two or three together, roam the solitudes of some savage lands,\r\nthey always, as far as I can discover, hold friendly relations with\r\nother families inhabiting the same district. Such families occasionally\r\nmeet in council, and unite for their common defence. It is no argument\r\nagainst savage man being a social animal, that the tribes inhabiting\r\nadjacent districts are almost always at war with each other; for the\r\nsocial instincts never extend to all the individuals of the same\r\nspecies. Judging from the analogy of the majority of the Quadrumana, it\r\nis probable that the early ape-like progenitors of man were likewise\r\nsocial; but this is not of much importance for us. Although man, as he\r\nnow exists, has few special instincts, having lost any which his early\r\nprogenitors may have possessed, this is no reason why he should not\r\nhave retained from an extremely remote period some degree of\r\ninstinctive love and sympathy for his fellows. We are indeed all\r\nconscious that we do possess such sympathetic feelings (23. Hume\r\nremarks (‘An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,’ edit. of\r\n1751, p. 132), “There seems a necessity for confessing that the\r\nhappiness and misery of others are not spectacles altogether\r\nindifferent to us, but that the view of the former...communicates a\r\nsecret joy; the appearance of the latter... throws a melancholy damp\r\nover the imagination.”); but our consciousness does not tell us whether\r\nthey are instinctive, having originated long ago in the same manner as\r\nwith the lower animals, or whether they have been acquired by each of\r\nus during our early years. As man is a social animal, it is almost\r\ncertain that he would inherit a tendency to be faithful to his\r\ncomrades, and obedient to the leader of his tribe; for these qualities\r\nare common to most social animals. He would consequently possess some\r\ncapacity for self-command. He would from an inherited tendency be\r\nwilling to defend, in concert with others, his fellow-men; and would be\r\nready to aid them in any way, which did not too greatly interfere with\r\nhis own welfare or his own strong desires.\r\n\r\nThe social animals which stand at the bottom of the scale are guided\r\nalmost exclusively, and those which stand higher in the scale are\r\nlargely guided, by special instincts in the aid which they give to the\r\nmembers of the same community; but they are likewise in part impelled\r\nby mutual love and sympathy, assisted apparently by some amount of\r\nreason. Although man, as just remarked, has no special instincts to\r\ntell him how to aid his fellow-men, he still has the impulse, and with\r\nhis improved intellectual faculties would naturally be much guided in\r\nthis respect by reason and experience. Instinctive sympathy would also\r\ncause him to value highly the approbation of his fellows; for, as Mr.\r\nBain has clearly shewn (24. ‘Mental and Moral Science,’ 1868, p. 254.),\r\nthe love of praise and the strong feeling of glory, and the still\r\nstronger horror of scorn and infamy, “are due to the workings of\r\nsympathy.” Consequently man would be influenced in the highest degree\r\nby the wishes, approbation, and blame of his fellow-men, as expressed\r\nby their gestures and language. Thus the social instincts, which must\r\nhave been acquired by man in a very rude state, and probably even by\r\nhis early ape-like progenitors, still give the impulse to some of his\r\nbest actions; but his actions are in a higher degree determined by the\r\nexpressed wishes and judgment of his fellow-men, and unfortunately very\r\noften by his own strong selfish desires. But as love, sympathy and\r\nself-command become strengthened by habit, and as the power of\r\nreasoning becomes clearer, so that man can value justly the judgments\r\nof his fellows, he will feel himself impelled, apart from any\r\ntransitory pleasure or pain, to certain lines of conduct. He might then\r\ndeclare—not that any barbarian or uncultivated man could thus think—I\r\nam the supreme judge of my own conduct, and in the words of Kant, I\r\nwill not in my own person violate the dignity of humanity.\r\n\r\nTHE MORE ENDURING SOCIAL INSTINCTS CONQUER THE LESS PERSISTENT\r\nINSTINCTS.\r\n\r\nWe have not, however, as yet considered the main point, on which, from\r\nour present point of view, the whole question of the moral sense turns.\r\nWhy should a man feel that he ought to obey one instinctive desire\r\nrather than another? Why is he bitterly regretful, if he has yielded to\r\na strong sense of self-preservation, and has not risked his life to\r\nsave that of a fellow-creature? or why does he regret having stolen\r\nfood from hunger?\r\n\r\nIt is evident in the first place, that with mankind the instinctive\r\nimpulses have different degrees of strength; a savage will risk his own\r\nlife to save that of a member of the same community, but will be wholly\r\nindifferent about a stranger: a young and timid mother urged by the\r\nmaternal instinct will, without a moment’s hesitation, run the greatest\r\ndanger for her own infant, but not for a mere fellow-creature.\r\nNevertheless many a civilised man, or even boy, who never before risked\r\nhis life for another, but full of courage and sympathy, has disregarded\r\nthe instinct of self-preservation, and plunged at once into a torrent\r\nto save a drowning man, though a stranger. In this case man is impelled\r\nby the same instinctive motive, which made the heroic little American\r\nmonkey, formerly described, save his keeper, by attacking the great and\r\ndreaded baboon. Such actions as the above appear to be the simple\r\nresult of the greater strength of the social or maternal instincts\r\nrather than that of any other instinct or motive; for they are\r\nperformed too instantaneously for reflection, or for pleasure or pain\r\nto be felt at the time; though, if prevented by any cause, distress or\r\neven misery might be felt. In a timid man, on the other hand, the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation might be so strong, that he would be\r\nunable to force himself to run any such risk, perhaps not even for his\r\nown child.\r\n\r\nI am aware that some persons maintain that actions performed\r\nimpulsively, as in the above cases, do not come under the dominion of\r\nthe moral sense, and cannot be called moral. They confine this term to\r\nactions done deliberately, after a victory over opposing desires, or\r\nwhen prompted by some exalted motive. But it appears scarcely possible\r\nto draw any clear line of distinction of this kind. (25. I refer here\r\nto the distinction between what has been called MATERIAL and FORMAL\r\nmorality. I am glad to find that Professor Huxley (‘Critiques and\r\nAddresses,’ 1873, p. 287) takes the same view on this subject as I do.\r\nMr. Leslie Stephen remarks (‘Essays on Freethinking and Plain\r\nSpeaking,’ 1873, p. 83), “the metaphysical distinction, between\r\nmaterial and formal morality is as irrelevant as other such\r\ndistinctions.”) As far as exalted motives are concerned, many instances\r\nhave been recorded of savages, destitute of any feeling of general\r\nbenevolence towards mankind, and not guided by any religious motive,\r\nwho have deliberately sacrificed their lives as prisoners(26. I have\r\ngiven one such case, namely of three Patagonian Indians who preferred\r\nbeing shot, one after the other, to betraying the plans of their\r\ncompanions in war (‘Journal of Researches,’ 1845, p. 103).), rather\r\nthan betray their comrades; and surely their conduct ought to be\r\nconsidered as moral. As far as deliberation, and the victory over\r\nopposing motives are concerned, animals may be seen doubting between\r\nopposed instincts, in rescuing their offspring or comrades from danger;\r\nyet their actions, though done for the good of others, are not called\r\nmoral. Moreover, anything performed very often by us, will at last be\r\ndone without deliberation or hesitation, and can then hardly be\r\ndistinguished from an instinct; yet surely no one will pretend that\r\nsuch an action ceases to be moral. On the contrary, we all feel that an\r\nact cannot be considered as perfect, or as performed in the most noble\r\nmanner, unless it be done impulsively, without deliberation or effort,\r\nin the same manner as by a man in whom the requisite qualities are\r\ninnate. He who is forced to overcome his fear or want of sympathy\r\nbefore he acts, deserves, however, in one way higher credit than the\r\nman whose innate disposition leads him to a good act without effort. As\r\nwe cannot distinguish between motives, we rank all actions of a certain\r\nclass as moral, if performed by a moral being. A moral being is one who\r\nis capable of comparing his past and future actions or motives, and of\r\napproving or disapproving of them. We have no reason to suppose that\r\nany of the lower animals have this capacity; therefore, when a\r\nNewfoundland dog drags a child out of the water, or a monkey faces\r\ndanger to rescue its comrade, or takes charge of an orphan monkey, we\r\ndo not call its conduct moral. But in the case of man, who alone can\r\nwith certainty be ranked as a moral being, actions of a certain class\r\nare called moral, whether performed deliberately, after a struggle with\r\nopposing motives, or impulsively through instinct, or from the effects\r\nof slowly-gained habit.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our more immediate subject. Although some instincts\r\nare more powerful than others, and thus lead to corresponding actions,\r\nyet it is untenable, that in man the social instincts (including the\r\nlove of praise and fear of blame) possess greater strength, or have,\r\nthrough long habit, acquired greater strength than the instincts of\r\nself-preservation, hunger, lust, vengeance, etc. Why then does man\r\nregret, even though trying to banish such regret, that he has followed\r\nthe one natural impulse rather than the other; and why does he further\r\nfeel that he ought to regret his conduct? Man in this respect differs\r\nprofoundly from the lower animals. Nevertheless we can, I think, see\r\nwith some degree of clearness the reason of this difference.\r\n\r\nMan, from the activity of his mental faculties, cannot avoid\r\nreflection: past impressions and images are incessantly and clearly\r\npassing through his mind. Now with those animals which live permanently\r\nin a body, the social instincts are ever present and persistent. Such\r\nanimals are always ready to utter the danger-signal, to defend the\r\ncommunity, and to give aid to their fellows in accordance with their\r\nhabits; they feel at all times, without the stimulus of any special\r\npassion or desire, some degree of love and sympathy for them; they are\r\nunhappy if long separated from them, and always happy to be again in\r\ntheir company. So it is with ourselves. Even when we are quite alone,\r\nhow often do we think with pleasure or pain of what others think of\r\nus,—of their imagined approbation or disapprobation; and this all\r\nfollows from sympathy, a fundamental element of the social instincts. A\r\nman who possessed no trace of such instincts would be an unnatural\r\nmonster. On the other hand, the desire to satisfy hunger, or any\r\npassion such as vengeance, is in its nature temporary, and can for a\r\ntime be fully satisfied. Nor is it easy, perhaps hardly possible, to\r\ncall up with complete vividness the feeling, for instance, of hunger;\r\nnor indeed, as has often been remarked, of any suffering. The instinct\r\nof self-preservation is not felt except in the presence of danger; and\r\nmany a coward has thought himself brave until he has met his enemy face\r\nto face. The wish for another man’s property is perhaps as persistent a\r\ndesire as any that can be named; but even in this case the satisfaction\r\nof actual possession is generally a weaker feeling than the desire:\r\nmany a thief, if not a habitual one, after success has wondered why he\r\nstole some article. (27. Enmity or hatred seems also to be a highly\r\npersistent feeling, perhaps more so than any other that can be named.\r\nEnvy is defined as hatred of another for some excellence or success;\r\nand Bacon insists (Essay ix.), “Of all other affections envy is the\r\nmost importune and continual.” Dogs are very apt to hate both strange\r\nmen and strange dogs, especially if they live near at hand, but do not\r\nbelong to the same family, tribe, or clan; this feeling would thus seem\r\nto be innate, and is certainly a most persistent one. It seems to be\r\nthe complement and converse of the true social instinct. From what we\r\nhear of savages, it would appear that something of the same kind holds\r\ngood with them. If this be so, it would be a small step in any one to\r\ntransfer such feelings to any member of the same tribe if he had done\r\nhim an injury and had become his enemy. Nor is it probable that the\r\nprimitive conscience would reproach a man for injuring his enemy;\r\nrather it would reproach him, if he had not revenged himself. To do\r\ngood in return for evil, to love your enemy, is a height of morality to\r\nwhich it may be doubted whether the social instincts would, by\r\nthemselves, have ever led us. It is necessary that these instincts,\r\ntogether with sympathy, should have been highly cultivated and extended\r\nby the aid of reason, instruction, and the love or fear of God, before\r\nany such golden rule would ever be thought of and obeyed.)\r\n\r\nA man cannot prevent past impressions often repassing through his mind;\r\nhe will thus be driven to make a comparison between the impressions of\r\npast hunger, vengeance satisfied, or danger shunned at other men’s\r\ncost, with the almost ever-present instinct of sympathy, and with his\r\nearly knowledge of what others consider as praiseworthy or blameable.\r\nThis knowledge cannot be banished from his mind, and from instinctive\r\nsympathy is esteemed of great moment. He will then feel as if he had\r\nbeen baulked in following a present instinct or habit, and this with\r\nall animals causes dissatisfaction, or even misery.\r\n\r\nThe above case of the swallow affords an illustration, though of a\r\nreversed nature, of a temporary though for the time strongly persistent\r\ninstinct conquering another instinct, which is usually dominant over\r\nall others. At the proper season these birds seem all day long to be\r\nimpressed with the desire to migrate; their habits change; they become\r\nrestless, are noisy and congregate in flocks. Whilst the mother-bird is\r\nfeeding, or brooding over her nestlings, the maternal instinct is\r\nprobably stronger than the migratory; but the instinct which is the\r\nmore persistent gains the victory, and at last, at a moment when her\r\nyoung ones are not in sight, she takes flight and deserts them. When\r\narrived at the end of her long journey, and the migratory instinct has\r\nceased to act, what an agony of remorse the bird would feel, if, from\r\nbeing endowed with great mental activity, she could not prevent the\r\nimage constantly passing through her mind, of her young ones perishing\r\nin the bleak north from cold and hunger.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of action, man will no doubt be apt to follow the\r\nstronger impulse; and though this may occasionally prompt him to the\r\nnoblest deeds, it will more commonly lead him to gratify his own\r\ndesires at the expense of other men. But after their gratification when\r\npast and weaker impressions are judged by the ever-enduring social\r\ninstinct, and by his deep regard for the good opinion of his fellows,\r\nretribution will surely come. He will then feel remorse, repentance,\r\nregret, or shame; this latter feeling, however, relates almost\r\nexclusively to the judgment of others. He will consequently resolve\r\nmore or less firmly to act differently for the future; and this is\r\nconscience; for conscience looks backwards, and serves as a guide for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThe nature and strength of the feelings which we call regret, shame,\r\nrepentance or remorse, depend apparently not only on the strength of\r\nthe violated instinct, but partly on the strength of the temptation,\r\nand often still more on the judgment of our fellows. How far each man\r\nvalues the appreciation of others, depends on the strength of his\r\ninnate or acquired feeling of sympathy; and on his own capacity for\r\nreasoning out the remote consequences of his acts. Another element is\r\nmost important, although not necessary, the reverence or fear of the\r\nGods, or Spirits believed in by each man: and this applies especially\r\nin cases of remorse. Several critics have objected that though some\r\nslight regret or repentance may be explained by the view advocated in\r\nthis chapter, it is impossible thus to account for the soul-shaking\r\nfeeling of remorse. But I can see little force in this objection. My\r\ncritics do not define what they mean by remorse, and I can find no\r\ndefinition implying more than an overwhelming sense of repentance.\r\nRemorse seems to bear the same relation to repentance, as rage does to\r\nanger, or agony to pain. It is far from strange that an instinct so\r\nstrong and so generally admired, as maternal love, should, if\r\ndisobeyed, lead to the deepest misery, as soon as the impression of the\r\npast cause of disobedience is weakened. Even when an action is opposed\r\nto no special instinct, merely to know that our friends and equals\r\ndespise us for it is enough to cause great misery. Who can doubt that\r\nthe refusal to fight a duel through fear has caused many men an agony\r\nof shame? Many a Hindoo, it is said, has been stirred to the bottom of\r\nhis soul by having partaken of unclean food. Here is another case of\r\nwhat must, I think, be called remorse. Dr. Landor acted as a magistrate\r\nin West Australia, and relates (28. ‘Insanity in Relation to Law,’\r\nOntario, United States, 1871, p. 1.), that a native on his farm, after\r\nlosing one of his wives from disease, came and said that, “he was going\r\nto a distant tribe to spear a woman, to satisfy his sense of duty to\r\nhis wife. I told him that if he did so, I would send him to prison for\r\nlife. He remained about the farm for some months, but got exceedingly\r\nthin, and complained that he could not rest or eat, that his wife’s\r\nspirit was haunting him, because he had not taken a life for hers. I\r\nwas inexorable, and assured him that nothing should save him if he\r\ndid.” Nevertheless the man disappeared for more than a year, and then\r\nreturned in high condition; and his other wife told Dr. Landor that her\r\nhusband had taken the life of a woman belonging to a distant tribe; but\r\nit was impossible to obtain legal evidence of the act. The breach of a\r\nrule held sacred by the tribe, will thus, as it seems, give rise to the\r\ndeepest feelings,—and this quite apart from the social instincts,\r\nexcepting in so far as the rule is grounded on the judgment of the\r\ncommunity. How so many strange superstitions have arisen throughout the\r\nworld we know not; nor can we tell how some real and great crimes, such\r\nas incest, have come to be held in an abhorrence (which is not however\r\nquite universal) by the lowest savages. It is even doubtful whether in\r\nsome tribes incest would be looked on with greater horror, than would\r\nthe marriage of a man with a woman bearing the same name, though not a\r\nrelation. “To violate this law is a crime which the Australians hold in\r\nthe greatest abhorrence, in this agreeing exactly with certain tribes\r\nof North America. When the question is put in either district, is it\r\nworse to kill a girl of a foreign tribe, or to marry a girl of one’s\r\nown, an answer just opposite to ours would be given without\r\nhesitation.” (29. E.B. Tylor, in ‘Contemporary Review,’ April 1873, p.\r\n707.) We may, therefore, reject the belief, lately insisted on by some\r\nwriters, that the abhorrence of incest is due to our possessing a\r\nspecial God-implanted conscience. On the whole it is intelligible, that\r\na man urged by so powerful a sentiment as remorse, though arising as\r\nabove explained, should be led to act in a manner, which he has been\r\ntaught to believe serves as an expiation, such as delivering himself up\r\nto justice.\r\n\r\nMan prompted by his conscience, will through long habit acquire such\r\nperfect self-command, that his desires and passions will at last yield\r\ninstantly and without a struggle to his social sympathies and\r\ninstincts, including his feeling for the judgment of his fellows. The\r\nstill hungry, or the still revengeful man will not think of stealing\r\nfood, or of wreaking his vengeance. It is possible, or as we shall\r\nhereafter see, even probable, that the habit of self-command may, like\r\nother habits, be inherited. Thus at last man comes to feel, through\r\nacquired and perhaps inherited habit, that it is best for him to obey\r\nhis more persistent impulses. The imperious word “ought” seems merely\r\nto imply the consciousness of the existence of a rule of conduct,\r\nhowever it may have originated. Formerly it must have been often\r\nvehemently urged that an insulted gentleman OUGHT to fight a duel. We\r\neven say that a pointer OUGHT to point, and a retriever to retrieve\r\ngame. If they fail to do so, they fail in their duty and act wrongly.\r\n\r\nIf any desire or instinct leading to an action opposed to the good of\r\nothers still appears, when recalled to mind, as strong as, or stronger\r\nthan, the social instinct, a man will feel no keen regret at having\r\nfollowed it; but he will be conscious that if his conduct were known to\r\nhis fellows, it would meet with their disapprobation; and few are so\r\ndestitute of sympathy as not to feel discomfort when this is realised.\r\nIf he has no such sympathy, and if his desires leading to bad actions\r\nare at the time strong, and when recalled are not over-mastered by the\r\npersistent social instincts, and the judgment of others, then he is\r\nessentially a bad man (30. Dr. Prosper Despine, in his Psychologie\r\nNaturelle, 1868 (tom. i. p. 243; tom. ii. p. 169) gives many curious\r\ncases of the worst criminals, who apparently have been entirely\r\ndestitute of conscience.); and the sole restraining motive left is the\r\nfear of punishment, and the conviction that in the long run it would be\r\nbest for his own selfish interests to regard the good of others rather\r\nthan his own.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that every one may with an easy conscience gratify his\r\nown desires, if they do not interfere with his social instincts, that\r\nis with the good of others; but in order to be quite free from\r\nself-reproach, or at least of anxiety, it is almost necessary for him\r\nto avoid the disapprobation, whether reasonable or not, of his\r\nfellow-men. Nor must he break through the fixed habits of his life,\r\nespecially if these are supported by reason; for if he does, he will\r\nassuredly feel dissatisfaction. He must likewise avoid the reprobation\r\nof the one God or gods in whom, according to his knowledge or\r\nsuperstition, he may believe; but in this case the additional fear of\r\ndivine punishment often supervenes.\r\n\r\nTHE STRICTLY SOCIAL VIRTUES AT FIRST ALONE REGARDED.\r\n\r\nThe above view of the origin and nature of the moral sense, which tells\r\nus what we ought to do, and of the conscience which reproves us if we\r\ndisobey it, accords well with what we see of the early and undeveloped\r\ncondition of this faculty in mankind. The virtues which must be\r\npractised, at least generally, by rude men, so that they may associate\r\nin a body, are those which are still recognised as the most important.\r\nBut they are practised almost exclusively in relation to the men of the\r\nsame tribe; and their opposites are not regarded as crimes in relation\r\nto the men of other tribes. No tribe could hold together if murder,\r\nrobbery, treachery, etc., were common; consequently such crimes within\r\nthe limits of the same tribe “are branded with everlasting infamy” (31.\r\nSee an able article in the ‘North British Review,’ 1867, p. 395. See\r\nalso Mr. W. Bagehot’s articles on the Importance of Obedience and\r\nCoherence to Primitive Man, in the ‘Fortnightly Review,’ 1867, p. 529,\r\nand 1868, p. 457, etc.); but excite no such sentiment beyond these\r\nlimits. A North-American Indian is well pleased with himself, and is\r\nhonoured by others, when he scalps a man of another tribe; and a Dyak\r\ncuts off the head of an unoffending person, and dries it as a trophy.\r\nThe murder of infants has prevailed on the largest scale throughout the\r\nworld (32. The fullest account which I have met with is by Dr. Gerland,\r\nin his ‘Ueber den Aussterben der Naturvölker,’ 1868; but I shall have\r\nto recur to the subject of infanticide in a future chapter.), and has\r\nmet with no reproach; but infanticide, especially of females, has been\r\nthought to be good for the tribe, or at least not injurious. Suicide\r\nduring former times was not generally considered as a crime (33. See\r\nthe very interesting discussion on suicide in Lecky’s ‘History of\r\nEuropean Morals,’ vol. i. 1869, p. 223. With respect to savages, Mr.\r\nWinwood Reade informs me that the negroes of West Africa often commit\r\nsuicide. It is well known how common it was amongst the miserable\r\naborigines of South America after the Spanish conquest. For New\r\nZealand, see the voyage of the Novara, and for the Aleutian Islands,\r\nMüller, as quoted by Houzeau, ‘Les Facultés Mentales,’ etc., tom. ii.\r\np. 136.), but rather, from the courage displayed, as an honourable act;\r\nand it is still practised by some semi-civilised and savage nations\r\nwithout reproach, for it does not obviously concern others of the\r\ntribe. It has been recorded that an Indian Thug conscientiously\r\nregretted that he had not robbed and strangled as many travellers as\r\ndid his father before him. In a rude state of civilisation the robbery\r\nof strangers is, indeed, generally considered as honourable.\r\n\r\nSlavery, although in some ways beneficial during ancient times (34. See\r\nMr. Bagehot, ‘Physics and Politics,’ 1872, p. 72.), is a great crime;\r\nyet it was not so regarded until quite recently, even by the most\r\ncivilised nations. And this was especially the case, because the slaves\r\nbelonged in general to a race different from that of their masters. As\r\nbarbarians do not regard the opinion of their women, wives are commonly\r\ntreated like slaves. Most savages are utterly indifferent to the\r\nsufferings of strangers, or even delight in witnessing them. It is well\r\nknown that the women and children of the North-American Indians aided\r\nin torturing their enemies. Some savages take a horrid pleasure in\r\ncruelty to animals (35. See, for instance, Mr. Hamilton’s account of\r\nthe Kaffirs, ‘Anthropological Review,’ 1870, p. xv.), and humanity is\r\nan unknown virtue. Nevertheless, besides the family affections,\r\nkindness is common, especially during sickness, between the members of\r\nthe same tribe, and is sometimes extended beyond these limits. Mungo\r\nPark’s touching account of the kindness of the negro women of the\r\ninterior to him is well known. Many instances could be given of the\r\nnoble fidelity of savages towards each other, but not to strangers;\r\ncommon experience justifies the maxim of the Spaniard, “Never, never\r\ntrust an Indian.” There cannot be fidelity without truth; and this\r\nfundamental virtue is not rare between the members of the same tribe:\r\nthus Mungo Park heard the negro women teaching their young children to\r\nlove the truth. This, again, is one of the virtues which becomes so\r\ndeeply rooted in the mind, that it is sometimes practised by savages,\r\neven at a high cost, towards strangers; but to lie to your enemy has\r\nrarely been thought a sin, as the history of modern diplomacy too\r\nplainly shews. As soon as a tribe has a recognised leader, disobedience\r\nbecomes a crime, and even abject submission is looked at as a sacred\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nAs during rude times no man can be useful or faithful to his tribe\r\nwithout courage, this quality has universally been placed in the\r\nhighest rank; and although in civilised countries a good yet timid man\r\nmay be far more useful to the community than a brave one, we cannot\r\nhelp instinctively honouring the latter above a coward, however\r\nbenevolent. Prudence, on the other hand, which does not concern the\r\nwelfare of others, though a very useful virtue, has never been highly\r\nesteemed. As no man can practise the virtues necessary for the welfare\r\nof his tribe without self-sacrifice, self-command, and the power of\r\nendurance, these qualities have been at all times highly and most\r\njustly valued. The American savage voluntarily submits to the most\r\nhorrid tortures without a groan, to prove and strengthen his fortitude\r\nand courage; and we cannot help admiring him, or even an Indian Fakir,\r\nwho, from a foolish religious motive, swings suspended by a hook buried\r\nin his flesh.\r\n\r\nThe other so-called self-regarding virtues, which do not obviously,\r\nthough they may really, affect the welfare of the tribe, have never\r\nbeen esteemed by savages, though now highly appreciated by civilised\r\nnations. The greatest intemperance is no reproach with savages. Utter\r\nlicentiousness, and unnatural crimes, prevail to an astounding extent.\r\n(36. Mr. M’Lennan has given (‘Primitive Marriage,’ 1865, p. 176) a good\r\ncollection of facts on this head.) As soon, however, as marriage,\r\nwhether polygamous, or monogamous, becomes common, jealousy will lead\r\nto the inculcation of female virtue; and this, being honoured, will\r\ntend to spread to the unmarried females. How slowly it spreads to the\r\nmale sex, we see at the present day. Chastity eminently requires\r\nself-command; therefore it has been honoured from a very early period\r\nin the moral history of civilised man. As a consequence of this, the\r\nsenseless practice of celibacy has been ranked from a remote period as\r\na virtue. (38. Lecky, ‘History of European Morals,’ vol. i. 1869, p.\r\n109.) The hatred of indecency, which appears to us so natural as to be\r\nthought innate, and which is so valuable an aid to chastity, is a\r\nmodern virtue, appertaining exclusively, as Sir G. Staunton remarks\r\n(38. ‘Embassy to China,’ vol. ii. p. 348.), to civilised life. This is\r\nshewn by the ancient religious rites of various nations, by the\r\ndrawings on the walls of Pompeii, and by the practices of many savages.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that actions are regarded by savages, and were\r\nprobably so regarded by primeval man, as good or bad, solely as they\r\nobviously affect the welfare of the tribe,—not that of the species, nor\r\nthat of an individual member of the tribe. This conclusion agrees well\r\nwith the belief that the so-called moral sense is aboriginally derived\r\nfrom the social instincts, for both relate at first exclusively to the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe chief causes of the low morality of savages, as judged by our\r\nstandard, are, firstly, the confinement of sympathy to the same tribe.\r\nSecondly, powers of reasoning insufficient to recognise the bearing of\r\nmany virtues, especially of the self-regarding virtues, on the general\r\nwelfare of the tribe. Savages, for instance, fail to trace the\r\nmultiplied evils consequent on a want of temperance, chastity, etc.\r\nAnd, thirdly, weak power of self-command; for this power has not been\r\nstrengthened through long-continued, perhaps inherited, habit,\r\ninstruction and religion.\r\n\r\nI have entered into the above details on the immorality of savages (39.\r\nSee on this subject copious evidence in Chap. vii. of Sir J. Lubbock,\r\n‘Origin of Civilisation,’ 1870.), because some authors have recently\r\ntaken a high view of their moral nature, or have attributed most of\r\ntheir crimes to mistaken benevolence. (40. For instance Lecky, ‘History\r\nof European Morals,’ vol. i. p. 124.) These authors appear to rest\r\ntheir conclusion on savages possessing those virtues which are\r\nserviceable, or even necessary, for the existence of the family and of\r\nthe tribe,—qualities which they undoubtedly do possess, and often in a\r\nhigh degree.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed formerly by philosophers of the derivative (41. This\r\nterm is used in an able article in the ‘Westminster Review,’ Oct. 1869,\r\np. 498. For the “Greatest happiness principle,” see J.S. Mill,\r\n‘Utilitarianism,’ p. 17.) school of morals that the foundation of\r\nmorality lay in a form of Selfishness; but more recently the “Greatest\r\nhappiness principle” has been brought prominently forward. It is,\r\nhowever, more correct to speak of the latter principle as the standard,\r\nand not as the motive of conduct. Nevertheless, all the authors whose\r\nworks I have consulted, with a few exceptions (42. Mill recognises\r\n(‘System of Logic,’ vol. ii. p. 422) in the clearest manner, that\r\nactions may be performed through habit without the anticipation of\r\npleasure. Mr. H. Sidgwick also, in his Essay on Pleasure and Desire\r\n(‘The Contemporary Review,’ April 1872, p. 671), remarks: “To sum up,\r\nin contravention of the doctrine that our conscious active impulses are\r\nalways directed towards the production of agreeable sensations in\r\nourselves, I would maintain that we find everywhere in consciousness\r\nextra-regarding impulse, directed towards something that is not\r\npleasure; that in many cases the impulse is so far incompatible with\r\nthe self-regarding that the two do not easily co-exist in the same\r\nmoment of consciousness.” A dim feeling that our impulses do not by any\r\nmeans always arise from any contemporaneous or anticipated pleasure,\r\nhas, I cannot but think, been one chief cause of the acceptance of the\r\nintuitive theory of morality, and of the rejection of the utilitarian\r\nor “Greatest happiness” theory. With respect to the latter theory the\r\nstandard and the motive of conduct have no doubt often been confused,\r\nbut they are really in some degree blended.), write as if there must be\r\na distinct motive for every action, and that this must be associated\r\nwith some pleasure or displeasure. But man seems often to act\r\nimpulsively, that is from instinct or long habit, without any\r\nconsciousness of pleasure, in the same manner as does probably a bee or\r\nant, when it blindly follows its instincts. Under circumstances of\r\nextreme peril, as during a fire, when a man endeavours to save a\r\nfellow-creature without a moment’s hesitation, he can hardly feel\r\npleasure; and still less has he time to reflect on the dissatisfaction\r\nwhich he might subsequently experience if he did not make the attempt.\r\nShould he afterwards reflect over his own conduct, he would feel that\r\nthere lies within him an impulsive power widely different from a search\r\nafter pleasure or happiness; and this seems to be the deeply planted\r\nsocial instinct.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the lower animals it seems much more appropriate to\r\nspeak of their social instincts, as having been developed for the\r\ngeneral good rather than for the general happiness of the species. The\r\nterm, general good, may be defined as the rearing of the greatest\r\nnumber of individuals in full vigour and health, with all their\r\nfaculties perfect, under the conditions to which they are subjected. As\r\nthe social instincts both of man and the lower animals have no doubt\r\nbeen developed by nearly the same steps, it would be advisable, if\r\nfound practicable, to use the same definition in both cases, and to\r\ntake as the standard of morality, the general good or welfare of the\r\ncommunity, rather than the general happiness; but this definition would\r\nperhaps require some limitation on account of political ethics.\r\n\r\nWhen a man risks his life to save that of a fellow-creature, it seems\r\nalso more correct to say that he acts for the general good, rather than\r\nfor the general happiness of mankind. No doubt the welfare and the\r\nhappiness of the individual usually coincide; and a contented, happy\r\ntribe will flourish better than one that is discontented and unhappy.\r\nWe have seen that even at an early period in the history of man, the\r\nexpressed wishes of the community will have naturally influenced to a\r\nlarge extent the conduct of each member; and as all wish for happiness,\r\nthe “greatest happiness principle” will have become a most important\r\nsecondary guide and object; the social instinct, however, together with\r\nsympathy (which leads to our regarding the approbation and\r\ndisapprobation of others), having served as the primary impulse and\r\nguide. Thus the reproach is removed of laying the foundation of the\r\nnoblest part of our nature in the base principle of selfishness;\r\nunless, indeed, the satisfaction which every animal feels, when it\r\nfollows its proper instincts, and the dissatisfaction felt when\r\nprevented, be called selfish.\r\n\r\nThe wishes and opinions of the members of the same community, expressed\r\nat first orally, but later by writing also, either form the sole guides\r\nof our conduct, or greatly reinforce the social instincts; such\r\nopinions, however, have sometimes a tendency directly opposed to these\r\ninstincts. This latter fact is well exemplified by the LAW OF HONOUR,\r\nthat is, the law of the opinion of our equals, and not of all our\r\ncountrymen. The breach of this law, even when the breach is known to be\r\nstrictly accordant with true morality, has caused many a man more agony\r\nthan a real crime. We recognise the same influence in the burning sense\r\nof shame which most of us have felt, even after the interval of years,\r\nwhen calling to mind some accidental breach of a trifling, though\r\nfixed, rule of etiquette. The judgment of the community will generally\r\nbe guided by some rude experience of what is best in the long run for\r\nall the members; but this judgment will not rarely err from ignorance\r\nand weak powers of reasoning. Hence the strangest customs and\r\nsuperstitions, in complete opposition to the true welfare and happiness\r\nof mankind, have become all-powerful throughout the world. We see this\r\nin the horror felt by a Hindoo who breaks his caste, and in many other\r\nsuch cases. It would be difficult to distinguish between the remorse\r\nfelt by a Hindoo who has yielded to the temptation of eating unclean\r\nfood, from that felt after committing a theft; but the former would\r\nprobably be the more severe.\r\n\r\nHow so many absurd rules of conduct, as well as so many absurd\r\nreligious beliefs, have originated, we do not know; nor how it is that\r\nthey have become, in all quarters of the world, so deeply impressed on\r\nthe mind of men; but it is worthy of remark that a belief constantly\r\ninculcated during the early years of life, whilst the brain is\r\nimpressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an instinct; and\r\nthe very essence of an instinct is that it is followed independently of\r\nreason. Neither can we say why certain admirable virtues, such as the\r\nlove of truth, are much more highly appreciated by some savage tribes\r\nthan by others (43. Good instances are given by Mr. Wallace in\r\n‘Scientific Opinion,’ Sept. 15, 1869; and more fully in his\r\n‘Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,’ 1870, p. 353.);\r\nnor, again, why similar differences prevail even amongst highly\r\ncivilised nations. Knowing how firmly fixed many strange customs and\r\nsuperstitions have become, we need feel no surprise that the\r\nself-regarding virtues, supported as they are by reason, should now\r\nappear to us so natural as to be thought innate, although they were not\r\nvalued by man in his early condition.\r\n\r\nNot withstanding many sources of doubt, man can generally and readily\r\ndistinguish between the higher and lower moral rules. The higher are\r\nfounded on the social instincts, and relate to the welfare of others.\r\nThey are supported by the approbation of our fellow-men and by reason.\r\nThe lower rules, though some of them when implying self-sacrifice\r\nhardly deserve to be called lower, relate chiefly to self, and arise\r\nfrom public opinion, matured by experience and cultivation; for they\r\nare not practised by rude tribes.\r\n\r\nAs man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united into\r\nlarger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that\r\nhe ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the\r\nmembers of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This\r\npoint being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to\r\nprevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races.\r\nIf, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in\r\nappearance or habits, experience unfortunately shews us how long it is,\r\nbefore we look at them as our fellow-creatures. Sympathy beyond the\r\nconfines of man, that is, humanity to the lower animals, seems to be\r\none of the latest moral acquisitions. It is apparently unfelt by\r\nsavages, except towards their pets. How little the old Romans knew of\r\nit is shewn by their abhorrent gladiatorial exhibitions. The very idea\r\nof humanity, as far as I could observe, was new to most of the Gauchos\r\nof the Pampas. This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is\r\nendowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more\r\ntender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all\r\nsentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honoured and practised by\r\nsome few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young,\r\nand eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that\r\nwe ought to control our thoughts, and “not even in inmost thought to\r\nthink again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us.” (44.\r\nTennyson, Idylls of the King, p. 244.) Whatever makes any bad action\r\nfamiliar to the mind, renders its performance by so much the easier. As\r\nMarcus Aurelius long ago said, “Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such\r\nalso will be the character of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the\r\nthoughts.” (45. ‘The Thoughts of the Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus,’\r\nEnglish translation, 2nd edit., 1869. p. 112. Marcus Aurelius was born\r\nA.D. 121.)\r\n\r\nOur great philosopher, Herbert Spencer, has recently explained his\r\nviews on the moral sense. He says (46. Letter to Mr. Mill in Bain’s\r\n‘Mental and Moral Science,’ 1868, p. 722.), “I believe that the\r\nexperiences of utility organised and consolidated through all past\r\ngenerations of the human race, have been producing corresponding\r\nmodifications, which, by continued transmission and accumulation, have\r\nbecome in us certain faculties of moral intuition—certain emotions\r\nresponding to right and wrong conduct, which have no apparent basis in\r\nthe individual experiences of utility.” There is not the least inherent\r\nimprobability, as it seems to me, in virtuous tendencies being more or\r\nless strongly inherited; for, not to mention the various dispositions\r\nand habits transmitted by many of our domestic animals to their\r\noffspring, I have heard of authentic cases in which a desire to steal\r\nand a tendency to lie appeared to run in families of the upper ranks;\r\nand as stealing is a rare crime in the wealthy classes, we can hardly\r\naccount by accidental coincidence for the tendency occurring in two or\r\nthree members of the same family. If bad tendencies are transmitted, it\r\nis probable that good ones are likewise transmitted. That the state of\r\nthe body by affecting the brain, has great influence on the moral\r\ntendencies is known to most of those who have suffered from chronic\r\nderangements of the digestion or liver. The same fact is likewise shewn\r\nby the “perversion or destruction of the moral sense being often one of\r\nthe earliest symptoms of mental derangement” (47. Maudsley, ‘Body and\r\nMind,’ 1870, p. 60.); and insanity is notoriously often inherited.\r\nExcept through the principle of the transmission of moral tendencies,\r\nwe cannot understand the differences believed to exist in this respect\r\nbetween the various races of mankind.\r\n\r\nEven the partial transmission of virtuous tendencies would be an\r\nimmense assistance to the primary impulse derived directly and\r\nindirectly from the social instincts. Admitting for a moment that\r\nvirtuous tendencies are inherited, it appears probable, at least in\r\nsuch cases as chastity, temperance, humanity to animals, etc., that\r\nthey become first impressed on the mental organization through habit,\r\ninstruction and example, continued during several generations in the\r\nsame family, and in a quite subordinate degree, or not at all, by the\r\nindividuals possessing such virtues having succeeded best in the\r\nstruggle for life. My chief source of doubt with respect to any such\r\ninheritance, is that senseless customs, superstitions, and tastes, such\r\nas the horror of a Hindoo for unclean food, ought on the same principle\r\nto be transmitted. I have not met with any evidence in support of the\r\ntransmission of superstitious customs or senseless habits, although in\r\nitself it is perhaps not less probable than that animals should acquire\r\ninherited tastes for certain kinds of food or fear of certain foes.\r\n\r\nFinally the social instincts, which no doubt were acquired by man as by\r\nthe lower animals for the good of the community, will from the first\r\nhave given to him some wish to aid his fellows, some feeling of\r\nsympathy, and have compelled him to regard their approbation and\r\ndisapprobation. Such impulses will have served him at a very early\r\nperiod as a rude rule of right and wrong. But as man gradually advanced\r\nin intellectual power, and was enabled to trace the more remote\r\nconsequences of his actions; as he acquired sufficient knowledge to\r\nreject baneful customs and superstitions; as he regarded more and more,\r\nnot only the welfare, but the happiness of his fellow-men; as from\r\nhabit, following on beneficial experience, instruction and example, his\r\nsympathies became more tender and widely diffused, extending to men of\r\nall races, to the imbecile, maimed, and other useless members of\r\nsociety, and finally to the lower animals,—so would the standard of his\r\nmorality rise higher and higher. And it is admitted by moralists of the\r\nderivative school and by some intuitionists, that the standard of\r\nmorality has risen since an early period in the history of man. (48. A\r\nwriter in the ‘North British Review’ (July 1869, p. 531), well capable\r\nof forming a sound judgment, expresses himself strongly in favour of\r\nthis conclusion. Mr. Lecky (‘History of Morals,’ vol. i. p. 143) seems\r\nto a certain extent to coincide therein.)\r\n\r\nAs a struggle may sometimes be seen going on between the various\r\ninstincts of the lower animals, it is not surprising that there should\r\nbe a struggle in man between his social instincts, with their derived\r\nvirtues, and his lower, though momentarily stronger impulses or\r\ndesires. This, as Mr. Galton (49. See his remarkable work on\r\n‘Hereditary Genius,’ 1869, p. 349. The Duke of Argyll (‘Primeval Man,’\r\n1869, p. 188) has some good remarks on the contest in man’s nature\r\nbetween right and wrong.) has remarked, is all the less surprising, as\r\nman has emerged from a state of barbarism within a comparatively recent\r\nperiod. After having yielded to some temptation we feel a sense of\r\ndissatisfaction, shame, repentance, or remorse, analogous to the\r\nfeelings caused by other powerful instincts or desires, when left\r\nunsatisfied or baulked. We compare the weakened impression of a past\r\ntemptation with the ever present social instincts, or with habits,\r\ngained in early youth and strengthened during our whole lives, until\r\nthey have become almost as strong as instincts. If with the temptation\r\nstill before us we do not yield, it is because either the social\r\ninstinct or some custom is at the moment predominant, or because we\r\nhave learnt that it will appear to us hereafter the stronger, when\r\ncompared with the weakened impression of the temptation, and we realise\r\nthat its violation would cause us suffering. Looking to future\r\ngenerations, there is no cause to fear that the social instincts will\r\ngrow weaker, and we may expect that virtuous habits will grow stronger,\r\nbecoming perhaps fixed by inheritance. In this case the struggle\r\nbetween our higher and lower impulses will be less severe, and virtue\r\nwill be triumphant.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY OF THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the difference between the mind of the\r\nlowest man and that of the highest animal is immense. An\r\nanthropomorphous ape, if he could take a dispassionate view of his own\r\ncase, would admit that though he could form an artful plan to plunder a\r\ngarden—though he could use stones for fighting or for breaking open\r\nnuts, yet that the thought of fashioning a stone into a tool was quite\r\nbeyond his scope. Still less, as he would admit, could he follow out a\r\ntrain of metaphysical reasoning, or solve a mathematical problem, or\r\nreflect on God, or admire a grand natural scene. Some apes, however,\r\nwould probably declare that they could and did admire the beauty of the\r\ncoloured skin and fur of their partners in marriage. They would admit,\r\nthat though they could make other apes understand by cries some of\r\ntheir perceptions and simpler wants, the notion of expressing definite\r\nideas by definite sounds had never crossed their minds. They might\r\ninsist that they were ready to aid their fellow-apes of the same troop\r\nin many ways, to risk their lives for them, and to take charge of their\r\norphans; but they would be forced to acknowledge that disinterested\r\nlove for all living creatures, the most noble attribute of man, was\r\nquite beyond their comprehension.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals,\r\ngreat as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. We have\r\nseen that the senses and intuitions, the various emotions and\r\nfaculties, such as love, memory, attention, curiosity, imitation,\r\nreason, etc., of which man boasts, may be found in an incipient, or\r\neven sometimes in a well-developed condition, in the lower animals.\r\nThey are also capable of some inherited improvement, as we see in the\r\ndomestic dog compared with the wolf or jackal. If it could be proved\r\nthat certain high mental powers, such as the formation of general\r\nconcepts, self-consciousness, etc., were absolutely peculiar to man,\r\nwhich seems extremely doubtful, it is not improbable that these\r\nqualities are merely the incidental results of other highly-advanced\r\nintellectual faculties; and these again mainly the result of the\r\ncontinued use of a perfect language. At what age does the new-born\r\ninfant possess the power of abstraction, or become self-conscious, and\r\nreflect on its own existence? We cannot answer; nor can we answer in\r\nregard to the ascending organic scale. The half-art, half-instinct of\r\nlanguage still bears the stamp of its gradual evolution. The ennobling\r\nbelief in God is not universal with man; and the belief in spiritual\r\nagencies naturally follows from other mental powers. The moral sense\r\nperhaps affords the best and highest distinction between man and the\r\nlower animals; but I need say nothing on this head, as I have so lately\r\nendeavoured to shew that the social instincts,—the prime principle of\r\nman’s moral constitution (50. ‘The Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius,’ etc.,\r\np. 139.)—with the aid of active intellectual powers and the effects of\r\nhabit, naturally lead to the golden rule, “As ye would that men should\r\ndo to you, do ye to them likewise;” and this lies at the foundation of\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter I shall make some few remarks on the probable steps\r\nand means by which the several mental and moral faculties of man have\r\nbeen gradually evolved. That such evolution is at least possible, ought\r\nnot to be denied, for we daily see these faculties developing in every\r\ninfant; and we may trace a perfect gradation from the mind of an utter\r\nidiot, lower than that of an animal low in the scale, to the mind of a\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL FACULTIES DURING\r\nPRIMEVAL AND CIVILISED TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvancement of the intellectual powers through natural\r\nselection—Importance of imitation—Social and moral faculties—Their\r\ndevelopment within the limits of the same tribe—Natural selection as\r\naffecting civilised nations—Evidence that civilised nations were once\r\nbarbarous.\r\n\r\nThe subjects to be discussed in this chapter are of the highest\r\ninterest, but are treated by me in an imperfect and fragmentary manner.\r\nMr. Wallace, in an admirable paper before referred to (1.\r\nAnthropological Review, May 1864, p. clviii.), argues that man, after\r\nhe had partially acquired those intellectual and moral faculties which\r\ndistinguish him from the lower animals, would have been but little\r\nliable to bodily modifications through natural selection or any other\r\nmeans. For man is enabled through his mental faculties “to keep with an\r\nunchanged body in harmony with the changing universe.” He has great\r\npower of adapting his habits to new conditions of life. He invents\r\nweapons, tools, and various stratagems to procure food and to defend\r\nhimself. When he migrates into a colder climate he uses clothes, builds\r\nsheds, and makes fires; and by the aid of fire cooks food otherwise\r\nindigestible. He aids his fellow-men in many ways, and anticipates\r\nfuture events. Even at a remote period he practised some division of\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThe lower animals, on the other hand, must have their bodily structure\r\nmodified in order to survive under greatly changed conditions. They\r\nmust be rendered stronger, or acquire more effective teeth or claws,\r\nfor defence against new enemies; or they must be reduced in size, so as\r\nto escape detection and danger. When they migrate into a colder\r\nclimate, they must become clothed with thicker fur, or have their\r\nconstitutions altered. If they fail to be thus modified, they will\r\ncease to exist.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is widely different, as Mr. Wallace has with justice\r\ninsisted, in relation to the intellectual and moral faculties of man.\r\nThese faculties are variable; and we have every reason to believe that\r\nthe variations tend to be inherited. Therefore, if they were formerly\r\nof high importance to primeval man and to his ape-like progenitors,\r\nthey would have been perfected or advanced through natural selection.\r\nOf the high importance of the intellectual faculties there can be no\r\ndoubt, for man mainly owes to them his predominant position in the\r\nworld. We can see, that in the rudest state of society, the individuals\r\nwho were the most sagacious, who invented and used the best weapons or\r\ntraps, and who were best able to defend themselves, would rear the\r\ngreatest number of offspring. The tribes, which included the largest\r\nnumber of men thus endowed, would increase in number and supplant other\r\ntribes. Numbers depend primarily on the means of subsistence, and this\r\ndepends partly on the physical nature of the country, but in a much\r\nhigher degree on the arts which are there practised. As a tribe\r\nincreases and is victorious, it is often still further increased by the\r\nabsorption of other tribes. (2. After a time the members or tribes\r\nwhich are absorbed into another tribe assume, as Sir Henry Maine\r\nremarks (‘Ancient Law,’ 1861, p. 131), that they are the co-descendants\r\nof the same ancestors.) The stature and strength of the men of a tribe\r\nare likewise of some importance for its success, and these depend in\r\npart on the nature and amount of the food which can be obtained. In\r\nEurope the men of the Bronze period were supplanted by a race more\r\npowerful, and, judging from their sword-handles, with larger hands (3.\r\nMorlot, ‘Soc. Vaud. Sc. Nat.’ 1860, p. 294.); but their success was\r\nprobably still more due to their superiority in the arts.\r\n\r\nAll that we know about savages, or may infer from their traditions and\r\nfrom old monuments, the history of which is quite forgotten by the\r\npresent inhabitants, shew that from the remotest times successful\r\ntribes have supplanted other tribes. Relics of extinct or forgotten\r\ntribes have been discovered throughout the civilised regions of the\r\nearth, on the wild plains of America, and on the isolated islands in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. At the present day civilised nations are everywhere\r\nsupplanting barbarous nations, excepting where the climate opposes a\r\ndeadly barrier; and they succeed mainly, though not exclusively,\r\nthrough their arts, which are the products of the intellect. It is,\r\ntherefore, highly probable that with mankind the intellectual faculties\r\nhave been mainly and gradually perfected through natural selection; and\r\nthis conclusion is sufficient for our purpose. Undoubtedly it would be\r\ninteresting to trace the development of each separate faculty from the\r\nstate in which it exists in the lower animals to that in which it\r\nexists in man; but neither my ability nor knowledge permits the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nIt deserves notice that, as soon as the progenitors of man became\r\nsocial (and this probably occurred at a very early period), the\r\nprinciple of imitation, and reason, and experience would have\r\nincreased, and much modified the intellectual powers in a way, of which\r\nwe see only traces in the lower animals. Apes are much given to\r\nimitation, as are the lowest savages; and the simple fact previously\r\nreferred to, that after a time no animal can be caught in the same\r\nplace by the same sort of trap, shews that animals learn by experience,\r\nand imitate the caution of others. Now, if some one man in a tribe,\r\nmore sagacious than the others, invented a new snare or weapon, or\r\nother means of attack or defence, the plainest self-interest, without\r\nthe assistance of much reasoning power, would prompt the other members\r\nto imitate him; and all would thus profit. The habitual practice of\r\neach new art must likewise in some slight degree strengthen the\r\nintellect. If the new invention were an important one, the tribe would\r\nincrease in number, spread, and supplant other tribes. In a tribe thus\r\nrendered more numerous there would always be a rather greater chance of\r\nthe birth of other superior and inventive members. If such men left\r\nchildren to inherit their mental superiority, the chance of the birth\r\nof still more ingenious members would be somewhat better, and in a very\r\nsmall tribe decidedly better. Even if they left no children, the tribe\r\nwould still include their blood-relations; and it has been ascertained\r\nby agriculturists (4. I have given instances in my Variation of Animals\r\nunder Domestication, vol. ii. p. 196.) that by preserving and breeding\r\nfrom the family of an animal, which when slaughtered was found to be\r\nvaluable, the desired character has been obtained.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the social and moral faculties. In order that primeval\r\nmen, or the ape-like progenitors of man, should become social, they\r\nmust have acquired the same instinctive feelings, which impel other\r\nanimals to live in a body; and they no doubt exhibited the same general\r\ndisposition. They would have felt uneasy when separated from their\r\ncomrades, for whom they would have felt some degree of love; they would\r\nhave warned each other of danger, and have given mutual aid in attack\r\nor defence. All this implies some degree of sympathy, fidelity, and\r\ncourage. Such social qualities, the paramount importance of which to\r\nthe lower animals is disputed by no one, were no doubt acquired by the\r\nprogenitors of man in a similar manner, namely, through natural\r\nselection, aided by inherited habit. When two tribes of primeval man,\r\nliving in the same country, came into competition, if (other\r\ncircumstances being equal) the one tribe included a great number of\r\ncourageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to\r\nwarn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe\r\nwould succeed better and conquer the other. Let it be borne in mind how\r\nall-important in the never-ceasing wars of savages, fidelity and\r\ncourage must be. The advantage which disciplined soldiers have over\r\nundisciplined hordes follows chiefly from the confidence which each man\r\nfeels in his comrades. Obedience, as Mr. Bagehot has well shewn (5. See\r\na remarkable series of articles on ‘Physics and Politics,’ in the\r\n‘Fortnightly Review,’ Nov. 1867; April 1, 1868; July 1, 1869, since\r\nseparately published.), is of the highest value, for any form of\r\ngovernment is better than none. Selfish and contentious people will not\r\ncohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected. A tribe rich in\r\nthe above qualities would spread and be victorious over other tribes:\r\nbut in the course of time it would, judging from all past history, be\r\nin its turn overcome by some other tribe still more highly endowed.\r\nThus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly to advance and be\r\ndiffused throughout the world.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, how within the limits of the same tribe did a\r\nlarge number of members first become endowed with these social and\r\nmoral qualities, and how was the standard of excellence raised? It is\r\nextremely doubtful whether the offspring of the more sympathetic and\r\nbenevolent parents, or of those who were the most faithful to their\r\ncomrades, would be reared in greater numbers than the children of\r\nselfish and treacherous parents belonging to the same tribe. He who was\r\nready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather than\r\nbetray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his\r\nnoble nature. The bravest men, who were always willing to come to the\r\nfront in war, and who freely risked their lives for others, would on an\r\naverage perish in larger numbers than other men. Therefore, it hardly\r\nseems probable, that the number of men gifted with such virtues, or\r\nthat the standard of their excellence, could be increased through\r\nnatural selection, that is, by the survival of the fittest; for we are\r\nnot here speaking of one tribe being victorious over another.\r\n\r\nAlthough the circumstances, leading to an increase in the number of\r\nthose thus endowed within the same tribe, are too complex to be clearly\r\nfollowed out, we can trace some of the probable steps. In the first\r\nplace, as the reasoning powers and foresight of the members became\r\nimproved, each man would soon learn that if he aided his fellow-men, he\r\nwould commonly receive aid in return. From this low motive he might\r\nacquire the habit of aiding his fellows; and the habit of performing\r\nbenevolent actions certainly strengthens the feeling of sympathy which\r\ngives the first impulse to benevolent actions. Habits, moreover,\r\nfollowed during many generations probably tend to be inherited.\r\n\r\nBut another and much more powerful stimulus to the development of the\r\nsocial virtues, is afforded by the praise and the blame of our\r\nfellow-men. To the instinct of sympathy, as we have already seen, it is\r\nprimarily due, that we habitually bestow both praise and blame on\r\nothers, whilst we love the former and dread the latter when applied to\r\nourselves; and this instinct no doubt was originally acquired, like all\r\nthe other social instincts, through natural selection. At how early a\r\nperiod the progenitors of man in the course of their development,\r\nbecame capable of feeling and being impelled by, the praise or blame of\r\ntheir fellow-creatures, we cannot of course say. But it appears that\r\neven dogs appreciate encouragement, praise, and blame. The rudest\r\nsavages feel the sentiment of glory, as they clearly shew by preserving\r\nthe trophies of their prowess, by their habit of excessive boasting,\r\nand even by the extreme care which they take of their personal\r\nappearance and decorations; for unless they regarded the opinion of\r\ntheir comrades, such habits would be senseless.\r\n\r\nThey certainly feel shame at the breach of some of their lesser rules,\r\nand apparently remorse, as shewn by the case of the Australian who grew\r\nthin and could not rest from having delayed to murder some other woman,\r\nso as to propitiate his dead wife’s spirit. Though I have not met with\r\nany other recorded case, it is scarcely credible that a savage, who\r\nwill sacrifice his life rather than betray his tribe, or one who will\r\ndeliver himself up as a prisoner rather than break his parole (6. Mr.\r\nWallace gives cases in his ‘Contributions to the Theory of Natural\r\nSelection,’ 1870, p. 354.), would not feel remorse in his inmost soul,\r\nif he had failed in a duty, which he held sacred.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore conclude that primeval man, at a very remote period,\r\nwas influenced by the praise and blame of his fellows. It is obvious,\r\nthat the members of the same tribe would approve of conduct which\r\nappeared to them to be for the general good, and would reprobate that\r\nwhich appeared evil. To do good unto others—to do unto others as ye\r\nwould they should do unto you—is the foundation-stone of morality. It\r\nis, therefore, hardly possible to exaggerate the importance during rude\r\ntimes of the love of praise and the dread of blame. A man who was not\r\nimpelled by any deep, instinctive feeling, to sacrifice his life for\r\nthe good of others, yet was roused to such actions by a sense of glory,\r\nwould by his example excite the same wish for glory in other men, and\r\nwould strengthen by exercise the noble feeling of admiration. He might\r\nthus do far more good to his tribe than by begetting offspring with a\r\ntendency to inherit his own high character.\r\n\r\nWith increased experience and reason, man perceives the more remote\r\nconsequences of his actions, and the self-regarding virtues, such as\r\ntemperance, chastity, etc., which during early times are, as we have\r\nbefore seen, utterly disregarded, come to be highly esteemed or even\r\nheld sacred. I need not, however, repeat what I have said on this head\r\nin the fourth chapter. Ultimately our moral sense or conscience becomes\r\na highly complex sentiment—originating in the social instincts, largely\r\nguided by the approbation of our fellow-men, ruled by reason,\r\nself-interest, and in later times by deep religious feelings, and\r\nconfirmed by instruction and habit.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that although a high standard of morality\r\ngives but a slight or no advantage to each individual man and his\r\nchildren over the other men of the same tribe, yet that an increase in\r\nthe number of well-endowed men and an advancement in the standard of\r\nmorality will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over\r\nanother. A tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high\r\ndegree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and\r\nsympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice\r\nthemselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other\r\ntribes; and this would be natural selection. At all times throughout\r\nthe world tribes have supplanted other tribes; and as morality is one\r\nimportant element in their success, the standard of morality and the\r\nnumber of well-endowed men will thus everywhere tend to rise and\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, very difficult to form any judgment why one particular\r\ntribe and not another has been successful and has risen in the scale of\r\ncivilisation. Many savages are in the same condition as when first\r\ndiscovered several centuries ago. As Mr. Bagehot has remarked, we are\r\napt to look at progress as normal in human society; but history refutes\r\nthis. The ancients did not even entertain the idea, nor do the Oriental\r\nnations at the present day. According to another high authority, Sir\r\nHenry Maine (7. ‘Ancient Law,’ 1861, p. 22. For Mr. Bagehot’s remarks,\r\n‘Fortnightly Review,’ April 1, 1868, p. 452.), “the greatest part of\r\nmankind has never shewn a particle of desire that its civil\r\ninstitutions should be improved.” Progress seems to depend on many\r\nconcurrent favourable conditions, far too complex to be followed out.\r\nBut it has often been remarked, that a cool climate, from leading to\r\nindustry and to the various arts, has been highly favourable thereto.\r\nThe Esquimaux, pressed by hard necessity, have succeeded in many\r\ningenious inventions, but their climate has been too severe for\r\ncontinued progress. Nomadic habits, whether over wide plains, or\r\nthrough the dense forests of the tropics, or along the shores of the\r\nsea, have in every case been highly detrimental. Whilst observing the\r\nbarbarous inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, it struck me that the\r\npossession of some property, a fixed abode, and the union of many\r\nfamilies under a chief, were the indispensable requisites for\r\ncivilisation. Such habits almost necessitate the cultivation of the\r\nground; and the first steps in cultivation would probably result, as I\r\nhave elsewhere shewn (8. ‘The Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. i. p. 309.), from some such accident as the seeds\r\nof a fruit-tree falling on a heap of refuse, and producing an unusually\r\nfine variety. The problem, however, of the first advance of savages\r\ntowards civilisation is at present much too difficult to be solved.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SELECTION AS AFFECTING CIVILISED NATIONS.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto only considered the advancement of man from a\r\nsemi-human condition to that of the modern savage. But some remarks on\r\nthe action of natural selection on civilised nations may be worth\r\nadding. This subject has been ably discussed by Mr. W.R. Greg (9.\r\n‘Fraser’s Magazine,’ Sept. 1868, p. 353. This article seems to have\r\nstruck many persons, and has given rise to two remarkable essays and a\r\nrejoinder in the ‘Spectator,’ Oct. 3rd and 17th, 1868. It has also been\r\ndiscussed in the ‘Quarterly Journal of Science,’ 1869, p. 152, and by\r\nMr. Lawson Tait in the ‘Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science,’\r\nFeb. 1869, and by Mr. E. Ray Lankester in his ‘Comparative Longevity,’\r\n1870, p. 128. Similar views appeared previously in the ‘Australasian,’\r\nJuly 13, 1867. I have borrowed ideas from several of these writers.),\r\nand previously by Mr. Wallace and Mr. Galton. (10. For Mr. Wallace, see\r\n‘Anthropological Review,’ as before cited. Mr. Galton in ‘Macmillan’s\r\nMagazine,’ Aug. 1865, p. 318; also his great work, ‘Hereditary Genius,’\r\n1870.) Most of my remarks are taken from these three authors. With\r\nsavages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that\r\nsurvive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men,\r\non the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination;\r\nwe build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we\r\ninstitute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to\r\nsave the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak\r\nconstitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak\r\nmembers of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has\r\nattended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must\r\nbe highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a\r\nwant of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a\r\ndomestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one\r\nis so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.\r\n\r\nThe aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an\r\nincidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally\r\nacquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in\r\nthe manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused.\r\nNor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason,\r\nwithout deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon\r\nmay harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he\r\nis acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to\r\nneglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent\r\nbenefit, with an overwhelming present evil. We must therefore bear the\r\nundoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their\r\nkind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action,\r\nnamely that the weaker and inferior members of society do not marry so\r\nfreely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased by\r\nthe weak in body or mind refraining from marriage, though this is more\r\nto be hoped for than expected.\r\n\r\nIn every country in which a large standing army is kept up, the finest\r\nyoung men are taken by the conscription or are enlisted. They are thus\r\nexposed to early death during war, are often tempted into vice, and are\r\nprevented from marrying during the prime of life. On the other hand the\r\nshorter and feebler men, with poor constitutions, are left at home, and\r\nconsequently have a much better chance of marrying and propagating\r\ntheir kind. (11. Prof. H. Fick (‘Einfluss der Naturwissenschaft auf das\r\nRecht,’ June 1872) has some good remarks on this head, and on other\r\nsuch points.)\r\n\r\nMan accumulates property and bequeaths it to his children, so that the\r\nchildren of the rich have an advantage over the poor in the race for\r\nsuccess, independently of bodily or mental superiority. On the other\r\nhand, the children of parents who are short-lived, and are therefore on\r\nan average deficient in health and vigour, come into their property\r\nsooner than other children, and will be likely to marry earlier, and\r\nleave a larger number of offspring to inherit their inferior\r\nconstitutions. But the inheritance of property by itself is very far\r\nfrom an evil; for without the accumulation of capital the arts could\r\nnot progress; and it is chiefly through their power that the civilised\r\nraces have extended, and are now everywhere extending their range, so\r\nas to take the place of the lower races. Nor does the moderate\r\naccumulation of wealth interfere with the process of selection. When a\r\npoor man becomes moderately rich, his children enter trades or\r\nprofessions in which there is struggle enough, so that the able in body\r\nand mind succeed best. The presence of a body of well-instructed men,\r\nwho have not to labour for their daily bread, is important to a degree\r\nwhich cannot be over-estimated; as all high intellectual work is\r\ncarried on by them, and on such work, material progress of all kinds\r\nmainly depends, not to mention other and higher advantages. No doubt\r\nwealth when very great tends to convert men into useless drones, but\r\ntheir number is never large; and some degree of elimination here\r\noccurs, for we daily see rich men, who happen to be fools or\r\nprofligate, squandering away their wealth.\r\n\r\nPrimogeniture with entailed estates is a more direct evil, though it\r\nmay formerly have been a great advantage by the creation of a dominant\r\nclass, and any government is better than none. Most eldest sons, though\r\nthey may be weak in body or mind, marry, whilst the younger sons,\r\nhowever superior in these respects, do not so generally marry. Nor can\r\nworthless eldest sons with entailed estates squander their wealth. But\r\nhere, as elsewhere, the relations of civilised life are so complex that\r\nsome compensatory checks intervene. The men who are rich through\r\nprimogeniture are able to select generation after generation the more\r\nbeautiful and charming women; and these must generally be healthy in\r\nbody and active in mind. The evil consequences, such as they may be, of\r\nthe continued preservation of the same line of descent, without any\r\nselection, are checked by men of rank always wishing to increase their\r\nwealth and power; and this they effect by marrying heiresses. But the\r\ndaughters of parents who have produced single children, are themselves,\r\nas Mr. Galton (12. ‘Hereditary Genius,’ 1870, pp. 132-140.) has shewn,\r\napt to be sterile; and thus noble families are continually cut off in\r\nthe direct line, and their wealth flows into some side channel; but\r\nunfortunately this channel is not determined by superiority of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAlthough civilisation thus checks in many ways the action of natural\r\nselection, it apparently favours the better development of the body, by\r\nmeans of good food and the freedom from occasional hardships. This may\r\nbe inferred from civilised men having been found, wherever compared, to\r\nbe physically stronger than savages. (13. Quatrefages, ‘Revue des Cours\r\nScientifiques,’ 1867-68, p. 659.) They appear also to have equal powers\r\nof endurance, as has been proved in many adventurous expeditions. Even\r\nthe great luxury of the rich can be but little detrimental; for the\r\nexpectation of life of our aristocracy, at all ages and of both sexes,\r\nis very little inferior to that of healthy English lives in the lower\r\nclasses. (14. See the fifth and sixth columns, compiled from good\r\nauthorities, in the table given in Mr. E.R. Lankester’s ‘Comparative\r\nLongevity,’ 1870, p. 115.)\r\n\r\nWe will now look to the intellectual faculties. If in each grade of\r\nsociety the members were divided into two equal bodies, the one\r\nincluding the intellectually superior and the other the inferior, there\r\ncan be little doubt that the former would succeed best in all\r\noccupations, and rear a greater number of children. Even in the lowest\r\nwalks of life, skill and ability must be of some advantage; though in\r\nmany occupations, owing to the great division of labour, a very small\r\none. Hence in civilised nations there will be some tendency to an\r\nincrease both in the number and in the standard of the intellectually\r\nable. But I do not wish to assert that this tendency may not be more\r\nthan counterbalanced in other ways, as by the multiplication of the\r\nreckless and improvident; but even to such as these, ability must be\r\nsome advantage.\r\n\r\nIt has often been objected to views like the foregoing, that the most\r\neminent men who have ever lived have left no offspring to inherit their\r\ngreat intellect. Mr. Galton says, “I regret I am unable to solve the\r\nsimple question whether, and how far, men and women who are prodigies\r\nof genius are infertile. I have, however, shewn that men of eminence\r\nare by no means so.” (15. ‘Hereditary Genius,’ 1870, p. 330.) Great\r\nlawgivers, the founders of beneficent religions, great philosophers and\r\ndiscoverers in science, aid the progress of mankind in a far higher\r\ndegree by their works than by leaving a numerous progeny. In the case\r\nof corporeal structures, it is the selection of the slightly\r\nbetter-endowed and the elimination of the slightly less well-endowed\r\nindividuals, and not the preservation of strongly-marked and rare\r\nanomalies, that leads to the advancement of a species. (16. ‘Origin of\r\nSpecies’ (fifth edition, 1869), p. 104.) So it will be with the\r\nintellectual faculties, since the somewhat abler men in each grade of\r\nsociety succeed rather better than the less able, and consequently\r\nincrease in number, if not otherwise prevented. When in any nation the\r\nstandard of intellect and the number of intellectual men have\r\nincreased, we may expect from the law of the deviation from an average,\r\nthat prodigies of genius will, as shewn by Mr. Galton, appear somewhat\r\nmore frequently than before.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the moral qualities, some elimination of the worst\r\ndispositions is always in progress even in the most civilised nations.\r\nMalefactors are executed, or imprisoned for long periods, so that they\r\ncannot freely transmit their bad qualities. Melancholic and insane\r\npersons are confined, or commit suicide. Violent and quarrelsome men\r\noften come to a bloody end. The restless who will not follow any steady\r\noccupation—and this relic of barbarism is a great check to civilisation\r\n(17. ‘Hereditary Genius,’ 1870, p. 347.)—emigrate to newly-settled\r\ncountries; where they prove useful pioneers. Intemperance is so highly\r\ndestructive, that the expectation of life of the intemperate, at the\r\nage of thirty for instance, is only 13.8 years; whilst for the rural\r\nlabourers of England at the same age it is 40.59 years. (18. E. Ray\r\nLankester, ‘Comparative Longevity,’ 1870, p. 115. The table of the\r\nintemperate is from Neison’s ‘Vital Statistics.’ In regard to\r\nprofligacy, see Dr. Farr, ‘Influence of Marriage on Mortality,’ ‘Nat.\r\nAssoc. for the Promotion of Social Science,’ 1858.) Profligate women\r\nbear few children, and profligate men rarely marry; both suffer from\r\ndisease. In the breeding of domestic animals, the elimination of those\r\nindividuals, though few in number, which are in any marked manner\r\ninferior, is by no means an unimportant element towards success. This\r\nespecially holds good with injurious characters which tend to reappear\r\nthrough reversion, such as blackness in sheep; and with mankind some of\r\nthe worst dispositions, which occasionally without any assignable cause\r\nmake their appearance in families, may perhaps be reversions to a\r\nsavage state, from which we are not removed by very many generations.\r\nThis view seems indeed recognised in the common expression that such\r\nmen are the black sheep of the family.\r\n\r\nWith civilised nations, as far as an advanced standard of morality, and\r\nan increased number of fairly good men are concerned, natural selection\r\napparently effects but little; though the fundamental social instincts\r\nwere originally thus gained. But I have already said enough, whilst\r\ntreating of the lower races, on the causes which lead to the advance of\r\nmorality, namely, the approbation of our fellow-men—the strengthening\r\nof our sympathies by habit—example and imitation—reason—experience, and\r\neven self-interest—instruction during youth, and religious feelings.\r\n\r\nA most important obstacle in civilised countries to an increase in the\r\nnumber of men of a superior class has been strongly insisted on by Mr.\r\nGreg and Mr. Galton (19. ‘Fraser’s Magazine,’ Sept. 1868, p. 353.\r\n‘Macmillan’s Magazine,’ Aug. 1865, p. 318. The Rev. F.W. Farrar\r\n(‘Fraser’s Magazine,’ Aug. 1870, p. 264) takes a different view.),\r\nnamely, the fact that the very poor and reckless, who are often\r\ndegraded by vice, almost invariably marry early, whilst the careful and\r\nfrugal, who are generally otherwise virtuous, marry late in life, so\r\nthat they may be able to support themselves and their children in\r\ncomfort. Those who marry early produce within a given period not only a\r\ngreater number of generations, but, as shewn by Dr. Duncan (20. ‘On the\r\nLaws of the Fertility of Women,’ in ‘Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety,’ Edinburgh, vol. xxiv. p. 287; now published separately under\r\nthe title of ‘Fecundity, Fertility, and Sterility,’ 1871. See, also,\r\nMr. Galton, ‘Hereditary Genius,’ pp. 352-357, for observations to the\r\nabove effect.), they produce many more children. The children,\r\nmoreover, that are borne by mothers during the prime of life are\r\nheavier and larger, and therefore probably more vigorous, than those\r\nborn at other periods. Thus the reckless, degraded, and often vicious\r\nmembers of society, tend to increase at a quicker rate than the\r\nprovident and generally virtuous members. Or as Mr. Greg puts the case:\r\n“The careless, squalid, unaspiring Irishman multiplies like rabbits:\r\nthe frugal, foreseeing, self-respecting, ambitious Scot, stern in his\r\nmorality, spiritual in his faith, sagacious and disciplined in his\r\nintelligence, passes his best years in struggle and in celibacy,\r\nmarries late, and leaves few behind him. Given a land originally\r\npeopled by a thousand Saxons and a thousand Celts—and in a dozen\r\ngenerations five-sixths of the population would be Celts, but\r\nfive-sixths of the property, of the power, of the intellect, would\r\nbelong to the one-sixth of Saxons that remained. In the eternal\r\n‘struggle for existence,’ it would be the inferior and LESS favoured\r\nrace that had prevailed—and prevailed by virtue not of its good\r\nqualities but of its faults.”\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some checks to this downward tendency. We have seen\r\nthat the intemperate suffer from a high rate of mortality, and the\r\nextremely profligate leave few offspring. The poorest classes crowd\r\ninto towns, and it has been proved by Dr. Stark from the statistics of\r\nten years in Scotland (21. ‘Tenth Annual Report of Births, Deaths,\r\netc., in Scotland,’ 1867, p. xxix.), that at all ages the death-rate is\r\nhigher in towns than in rural districts, “and during the first five\r\nyears of life the town death-rate is almost exactly double that of the\r\nrural districts.” As these returns include both the rich and the poor,\r\nno doubt more than twice the number of births would be requisite to\r\nkeep up the number of the very poor inhabitants in the towns,\r\nrelatively to those in the country. With women, marriage at too early\r\nan age is highly injurious; for it has been found in France that,\r\n“Twice as many wives under twenty die in the year, as died out of the\r\nsame number of the unmarried.” The mortality, also, of husbands under\r\ntwenty is “excessively high” (22. These quotations are taken from our\r\nhighest authority on such questions, namely, Dr. Farr, in his paper ‘On\r\nthe Influence of Marriage on the Mortality of the French People,’ read\r\nbefore the Nat. Assoc. for the Promotion of Social Science, 1858.), but\r\nwhat the cause of this may be, seems doubtful. Lastly, if the men who\r\nprudently delay marrying until they can bring up their families in\r\ncomfort, were to select, as they often do, women in the prime of life,\r\nthe rate of increase in the better class would be only slightly\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\nIt was established from an enormous body of statistics, taken during\r\n1853, that the unmarried men throughout France, between the ages of\r\ntwenty and eighty, die in a much larger proportion than the married:\r\nfor instance, out of every 1000 unmarried men, between the ages of\r\ntwenty and thirty, 11.3 annually died, whilst of the married, only 6.5\r\ndied. (23. Dr. Farr, ibid. The quotations given below are extracted\r\nfrom the same striking paper.) A similar law was proved to hold good,\r\nduring the years 1863 and 1864, with the entire population above the\r\nage of twenty in Scotland: for instance, out of every 1000 unmarried\r\nmen, between the ages of twenty and thirty, 14.97 annually died, whilst\r\nof the married only 7.24 died, that is less than half. (24. I have\r\ntaken the mean of the quinquennial means, given in ‘The Tenth Annual\r\nReport of Births, Deaths, etc., in Scotland,’ 1867. The quotation from\r\nDr. Stark is copied from an article in the ‘Daily News,’ Oct. 17, 1868,\r\nwhich Dr. Farr considers very carefully written.) Dr. Stark remarks on\r\nthis, “Bachelorhood is more destructive to life than the most\r\nunwholesome trades, or than residence in an unwholesome house or\r\ndistrict where there has never been the most distant attempt at\r\nsanitary improvement.” He considers that the lessened mortality is the\r\ndirect result of “marriage, and the more regular domestic habits which\r\nattend that state.” He admits, however, that the intemperate,\r\nprofligate, and criminal classes, whose duration of life is low, do not\r\ncommonly marry; and it must likewise be admitted that men with a weak\r\nconstitution, ill health, or any great infirmity in body or mind, will\r\noften not wish to marry, or will be rejected. Dr. Stark seems to have\r\ncome to the conclusion that marriage in itself is a main cause of\r\nprolonged life, from finding that aged married men still have a\r\nconsiderable advantage in this respect over the unmarried of the same\r\nadvanced age; but every one must have known instances of men, who with\r\nweak health during youth did not marry, and yet have survived to old\r\nage, though remaining weak, and therefore always with a lessened chance\r\nof life or of marrying. There is another remarkable circumstance which\r\nseems to support Dr. Stark’s conclusion, namely, that widows and\r\nwidowers in France suffer in comparison with the married a very heavy\r\nrate of mortality; but Dr. Farr attributes this to the poverty and evil\r\nhabits consequent on the disruption of the family, and to grief. On the\r\nwhole we may conclude with Dr. Farr that the lesser mortality of\r\nmarried than of unmarried men, which seems to be a general law, “is\r\nmainly due to the constant elimination of imperfect types, and to the\r\nskilful selection of the finest individuals out of each successive\r\ngeneration;” the selection relating only to the marriage state, and\r\nacting on all corporeal, intellectual, and moral qualities. (25. Dr.\r\nDuncan remarks (‘Fecundity, Fertility, etc.’ 1871, p. 334) on this\r\nsubject: “At every age the healthy and beautiful go over from the\r\nunmarried side to the married, leaving the unmarried columns crowded\r\nwith the sickly and unfortunate.”) We may, therefore, infer that sound\r\nand good men who out of prudence remain for a time unmarried, do not\r\nsuffer a high rate of mortality.\r\n\r\nIf the various checks specified in the two last paragraphs, and perhaps\r\nothers as yet unknown, do not prevent the reckless, the vicious and\r\notherwise inferior members of society from increasing at a quicker rate\r\nthan the better class of men, the nation will retrograde, as has too\r\noften occurred in the history of the world. We must remember that\r\nprogress is no invariable rule. It is very difficult to say why one\r\ncivilised nation rises, becomes more powerful, and spreads more widely,\r\nthan another; or why the same nation progresses more quickly at one\r\ntime than at another. We can only say that it depends on an increase in\r\nthe actual number of the population, on the number of men endowed with\r\nhigh intellectual and moral faculties, as well as on their standard of\r\nexcellence. Corporeal structure appears to have little influence,\r\nexcept so far as vigour of body leads to vigour of mind.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged by several writers that as high intellectual powers\r\nare advantageous to a nation, the old Greeks, who stood some grades\r\nhigher in intellect than any race that has ever existed (26. See the\r\ningenious and original argument on this subject by Mr. Galton,\r\n‘Hereditary Genius,’ pp. 340-342.), ought, if the power of natural\r\nselection were real, to have risen still higher in the scale, increased\r\nin number, and stocked the whole of Europe. Here we have the tacit\r\nassumption, so often made with respect to corporeal structures, that\r\nthere is some innate tendency towards continued development in mind and\r\nbody. But development of all kinds depends on many concurrent\r\nfavourable circumstances. Natural selection acts only tentatively.\r\nIndividuals and races may have acquired certain indisputable\r\nadvantages, and yet have perished from failing in other characters. The\r\nGreeks may have retrograded from a want of coherence between the many\r\nsmall states, from the small size of their whole country, from the\r\npractice of slavery, or from extreme sensuality; for they did not\r\nsuccumb until “they were enervated and corrupt to the very core.” (27.\r\nMr. Greg, ‘Fraser’s Magazine,’ Sept. 1868, p. 357.) The western nations\r\nof Europe, who now so immeasurably surpass their former savage\r\nprogenitors, and stand at the summit of civilisation, owe little or\r\nnone of their superiority to direct inheritance from the old Greeks,\r\nthough they owe much to the written works of that wonderful people.\r\n\r\nWho can positively say why the Spanish nation, so dominant at one time,\r\nhas been distanced in the race. The awakening of the nations of Europe\r\nfrom the dark ages is a still more perplexing problem. At that early\r\nperiod, as Mr. Galton has remarked, almost all the men of a gentle\r\nnature, those given to meditation or culture of the mind, had no refuge\r\nexcept in the bosom of a Church which demanded celibacy (28.\r\n‘Hereditary Genius,’ 1870, pp. 357-359. The Rev. F.W. Farrar (‘Fraser’s\r\nMagazine,’ Aug. 1870, p. 257) advances arguments on the other side. Sir\r\nC. Lyell had already (‘Principles of Geology,’ vol. ii. 1868, p. 489),\r\nin a striking passage called attention to the evil influence of the\r\nHoly Inquisition in having, through selection, lowered the general\r\nstandard of intelligence in Europe.); and this could hardly fail to\r\nhave had a deteriorating influence on each successive generation.\r\nDuring this same period the Holy Inquisition selected with extreme care\r\nthe freest and boldest men in order to burn or imprison them. In Spain\r\nalone some of the best men—those who doubted and questioned, and\r\nwithout doubting there can be no progress—were eliminated during three\r\ncenturies at the rate of a thousand a year. The evil which the Catholic\r\nChurch has thus effected is incalculable, though no doubt\r\ncounterbalanced to a certain, perhaps to a large, extent in other ways;\r\nnevertheless, Europe has progressed at an unparalleled rate.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable success of the English as colonists, compared to other\r\nEuropean nations, has been ascribed to their “daring and persistent\r\nenergy”; a result which is well illustrated by comparing the progress\r\nof the Canadians of English and French extraction; but who can say how\r\nthe English gained their energy? There is apparently much truth in the\r\nbelief that the wonderful progress of the United States, as well as the\r\ncharacter of the people, are the results of natural selection; for the\r\nmore energetic, restless, and courageous men from all parts of Europe\r\nhave emigrated during the last ten or twelve generations to that great\r\ncountry, and have there succeeded best. (29. Mr. Galton, ‘Macmillan’s\r\nMagazine,’ August 1865, p. 325. See also, ‘Nature,’ ‘On Darwinism and\r\nNational Life,’ Dec. 1869, p. 184.) Looking to the distant future, I do\r\nnot think that the Rev. Mr. Zincke takes an exaggerated view when he\r\nsays (30. ‘Last Winter in the United States,’ 1868, p. 29.): “All other\r\nseries of events—as that which resulted in the culture of mind in\r\nGreece, and that which resulted in the empire of Rome—only appear to\r\nhave purpose and value when viewed in connection with, or rather as\r\nsubsidiary to...the great stream of Anglo-Saxon emigration to the\r\nwest.” Obscure as is the problem of the advance of civilisation, we can\r\nat least see that a nation which produced during a lengthened period\r\nthe greatest number of highly intellectual, energetic, brave,\r\npatriotic, and benevolent men, would generally prevail over less\r\nfavoured nations.\r\n\r\nNatural selection follows from the struggle for existence; and this\r\nfrom a rapid rate of increase. It is impossible not to regret bitterly,\r\nbut whether wisely is another question, the rate at which man tends to\r\nincrease; for this leads in barbarous tribes to infanticide and many\r\nother evils, and in civilised nations to abject poverty, celibacy, and\r\nto the late marriages of the prudent. But as man suffers from the same\r\nphysical evils as the lower animals, he has no right to expect an\r\nimmunity from the evils consequent on the struggle for existence. Had\r\nhe not been subjected during primeval times to natural selection,\r\nassuredly he would never have attained to his present rank. Since we\r\nsee in many parts of the world enormous areas of the most fertile land\r\ncapable of supporting numerous happy homes, but peopled only by a few\r\nwandering savages, it might be argued that the struggle for existence\r\nhad not been sufficiently severe to force man upwards to his highest\r\nstandard. Judging from all that we know of man and the lower animals,\r\nthere has always been sufficient variability in their intellectual and\r\nmoral faculties, for a steady advance through natural selection. No\r\ndoubt such advance demands many favourable concurrent circumstances;\r\nbut it may well be doubted whether the most favourable would have\r\nsufficed, had not the rate of increase been rapid, and the consequent\r\nstruggle for existence extremely severe. It even appears from what we\r\nsee, for instance, in parts of S. America, that a people which may be\r\ncalled civilised, such as the Spanish settlers, is liable to become\r\nindolent and to retrograde, when the conditions of life are very easy.\r\nWith highly civilised nations continued progress depends in a\r\nsubordinate degree on natural selection; for such nations do not\r\nsupplant and exterminate one another as do savage tribes. Nevertheless\r\nthe more intelligent members within the same community will succeed\r\nbetter in the long run than the inferior, and leave a more numerous\r\nprogeny, and this is a form of natural selection. The more efficient\r\ncauses of progress seem to consist of a good education during youth\r\nwhilst the brain is impressible, and of a high standard of excellence,\r\ninculcated by the ablest and best men, embodied in the laws, customs\r\nand traditions of the nation, and enforced by public opinion. It\r\nshould, however, be borne in mind, that the enforcement of public\r\nopinion depends on our appreciation of the approbation and\r\ndisapprobation of others; and this appreciation is founded on our\r\nsympathy, which it can hardly be doubted was originally developed\r\nthrough natural selection as one of the most important elements of the\r\nsocial instincts. (31. I am much indebted to Mr. John Morley for some\r\ngood criticisms on this subject: see, also Broca, ‘Les Selections,’\r\n‘Revue d’Anthropologie,’ 1872.)\r\n\r\nON THE EVIDENCE THAT ALL CIVILISED NATIONS WERE ONCE BARBAROUS.\r\n\r\nThe present subject has been treated in so full and admirable a manner\r\nby Sir J. Lubbock (32. ‘On the Origin of Civilisation,’ ‘Proceedings of\r\nthe Ethnological Society,’ Nov. 26, 1867.), Mr. Tylor, Mr. M’Lennan,\r\nand others, that I need here give only the briefest summary of their\r\nresults. The arguments recently advanced by the Duke of Argyll (33.\r\n‘Primeval Man,’ 1869.) and formerly by Archbishop Whately, in favour of\r\nthe belief that man came into the world as a civilised being, and that\r\nall savages have since undergone degradation, seem to me weak in\r\ncomparison with those advanced on the other side. Many nations, no\r\ndoubt, have fallen away in civilisation, and some may have lapsed into\r\nutter barbarism, though on this latter head I have met with no\r\nevidence. The Fuegians were probably compelled by other conquering\r\nhordes to settle in their inhospitable country, and they may have\r\nbecome in consequence somewhat more degraded; but it would be difficult\r\nto prove that they have fallen much below the Botocudos, who inhabit\r\nthe finest parts of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe evidence that all civilised nations are the descendants of\r\nbarbarians, consists, on the one side, of clear traces of their former\r\nlow condition in still-existing customs, beliefs, language, etc.; and\r\non the other side, of proofs that savages are independently able to\r\nraise themselves a few steps in the scale of civilisation, and have\r\nactually thus risen. The evidence on the first head is extremely\r\ncurious, but cannot be here given: I refer to such cases as that of the\r\nart of enumeration, which, as Mr. Tylor clearly shews by reference to\r\nthe words still used in some places, originated in counting the\r\nfingers, first of one hand and then of the other, and lastly of the\r\ntoes. We have traces of this in our own decimal system, and in the\r\nRoman numerals, where, after the V, which is supposed to be an\r\nabbreviated picture of a human hand, we pass on to VI, etc., when the\r\nother hand no doubt was used. So again, “when we speak of three-score\r\nand ten, we are counting by the vigesimal system, each score thus\r\nideally made, standing for 20—for ‘one man’ as a Mexican or Carib would\r\nput it.” (34. ‘Royal Institution of Great Britain,’ March 15, 1867.\r\nAlso, ‘Researches into the Early History of Mankind,’ 1865.) According\r\nto a large and increasing school of philologists, every language bears\r\nthe marks of its slow and gradual evolution. So it is with the art of\r\nwriting, for letters are rudiments of pictorial representations. It is\r\nhardly possible to read Mr. M’Lennan’s work (35. ‘Primitive Marriage,’\r\n1865. See, likewise, an excellent article, evidently by the same\r\nauthor, in the ‘North British Review,’ July 1869. Also, Mr. L.H.\r\nMorgan, ‘A Conjectural Solution of the Origin of the Class. System of\r\nRelationship,’ in ‘Proc. American Acad. of Sciences,’ vol. vii. Feb.\r\n1868. Prof. Schaaffhausen (‘Anthropolog. Review,’ Oct. 1869, p. 373)\r\nremarks on “the vestiges of human sacrifices found both in Homer and\r\nthe Old Testament.”) and not admit that almost all civilised nations\r\nstill retain traces of such rude habits as the forcible capture of\r\nwives. What ancient nation, as the same author asks, can be named that\r\nwas originally monogamous? The primitive idea of justice, as shewn by\r\nthe law of battle and other customs of which vestiges still remain, was\r\nlikewise most rude. Many existing superstitions are the remnants of\r\nformer false religious beliefs. The highest form of religion—the grand\r\nidea of God hating sin and loving righteousness—was unknown during\r\nprimeval times.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other kind of evidence: Sir J. Lubbock has shewn that\r\nsome savages have recently improved a little in some of their simpler\r\narts. From the extremely curious account which he gives of the weapons,\r\ntools, and arts, in use amongst savages in various parts of the world,\r\nit cannot be doubted that these have nearly all been independent\r\ndiscoveries, excepting perhaps the art of making fire. (36. Sir J.\r\nLubbock, ‘Prehistoric Times,’ 2nd edit. 1869, chaps. xv. and xvi. et\r\npassim. See also the excellent 9th Chapter in Tylor’s ‘Early History of\r\nMankind,’ 2nd edit., 1870.) The Australian boomerang is a good instance\r\nof one such independent discovery. The Tahitians when first visited had\r\nadvanced in many respects beyond the inhabitants of most of the other\r\nPolynesian islands. There are no just grounds for the belief that the\r\nhigh culture of the native Peruvians and Mexicans was derived from\r\nabroad (37. Dr. F. Müller has made some good remarks to this effect in\r\nthe ‘Reise der Novara: Anthropolog. Theil,’ Abtheil. iii. 1868, s.\r\n127.); many native plants were there cultivated, and a few native\r\nanimals domesticated. We should bear in mind that, judging from the\r\nsmall influence of most missionaries, a wandering crew from some\r\nsemi-civilised land, if washed to the shores of America, would not have\r\nproduced any marked effect on the natives, unless they had already\r\nbecome somewhat advanced. Looking to a very remote period in the\r\nhistory of the world, we find, to use Sir J. Lubbock’s well-known\r\nterms, a paleolithic and neolithic period; and no one will pretend that\r\nthe art of grinding rough flint tools was a borrowed one. In all parts\r\nof Europe, as far east as Greece, in Palestine, India, Japan, New\r\nZealand, and Africa, including Egypt, flint tools have been discovered\r\nin abundance; and of their use the existing inhabitants retain no\r\ntradition. There is also indirect evidence of their former use by the\r\nChinese and ancient Jews. Hence there can hardly be a doubt that the\r\ninhabitants of these countries, which include nearly the whole\r\ncivilised world, were once in a barbarous condition. To believe that\r\nman was aboriginally civilised and then suffered utter degradation in\r\nso many regions, is to take a pitiably low view of human nature. It is\r\napparently a truer and more cheerful view that progress has been much\r\nmore general than retrogression; that man has risen, though by slow and\r\ninterrupted steps, from a lowly condition to the highest standard as\r\nyet attained by him in knowledge, morals and religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nON THE AFFINITIES AND GENEALOGY OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition of man in the animal series—The natural system\r\ngenealogical—Adaptive characters of slight value—Various small points\r\nof resemblance between man and the Quadrumana—Rank of man in the\r\nnatural system—Birthplace and antiquity of man—Absence of fossil\r\nconnecting links—Lower stages in the genealogy of man, as inferred,\r\nfirstly from his affinities and secondly from his structure—Early\r\nandrogynous condition of the Vertebrata—Conclusion.\r\n\r\nEven if it be granted that the difference between man and his nearest\r\nallies is as great in corporeal structure as some naturalists maintain,\r\nand although we must grant that the difference between them is immense\r\nin mental power, yet the facts given in the earlier chapters appear to\r\ndeclare, in the plainest manner, that man is descended from some lower\r\nform, notwithstanding that connecting-links have not hitherto been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nMan is liable to numerous, slight, and diversified variations, which\r\nare induced by the same general causes, are governed and transmitted in\r\naccordance with the same general laws, as in the lower animals. Man has\r\nmultiplied so rapidly, that he has necessarily been exposed to struggle\r\nfor existence, and consequently to natural selection. He has given rise\r\nto many races, some of which differ so much from each other, that they\r\nhave often been ranked by naturalists as distinct species. His body is\r\nconstructed on the same homological plan as that of other mammals. He\r\npasses through the same phases of embryological development. He retains\r\nmany rudimentary and useless structures, which no doubt were once\r\nserviceable. Characters occasionally make their re-appearance in him,\r\nwhich we have reason to believe were possessed by his early\r\nprogenitors. If the origin of man had been wholly different from that\r\nof all other animals, these various appearances would be mere empty\r\ndeceptions; but such an admission is incredible. These appearances, on\r\nthe other hand, are intelligible, at least to a large extent, if man is\r\nthe co-descendant with other mammals of some unknown and lower form.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists, from being deeply impressed with the mental and\r\nspiritual powers of man, have divided the whole organic world into\r\nthree kingdoms, the Human, the Animal, and the Vegetable, thus giving\r\nto man a separate kingdom. (1. Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire gives a\r\ndetailed account of the position assigned to man by various naturalists\r\nin their classifications: ‘Hist. Nat. Gen.’ tom. ii. 1859, pp.\r\n170-189.) Spiritual powers cannot be compared or classed by the\r\nnaturalist: but he may endeavour to shew, as I have done, that the\r\nmental faculties of man and the lower animals do not differ in kind,\r\nalthough immensely in degree. A difference in degree, however great,\r\ndoes not justify us in placing man in a distinct kingdom, as will\r\nperhaps be best illustrated by comparing the mental powers of two\r\ninsects, namely, a coccus or scale-insect and an ant, which undoubtedly\r\nbelong to the same class. The difference is here greater than, though\r\nof a somewhat different kind from, that between man and the highest\r\nmammal. The female coccus, whilst young, attaches itself by its\r\nproboscis to a plant; sucks the sap, but never moves again; is\r\nfertilised and lays eggs; and this is its whole history. On the other\r\nhand, to describe the habits and mental powers of worker-ants, would\r\nrequire, as Pierre Huber has shewn, a large volume; I may, however,\r\nbriefly specify a few points. Ants certainly communicate information to\r\neach other, and several unite for the same work, or for games of play.\r\nThey recognise their fellow-ants after months of absence, and feel\r\nsympathy for each other. They build great edifices, keep them clean,\r\nclose the doors in the evening, and post sentries. They make roads as\r\nwell as tunnels under rivers, and temporary bridges over them, by\r\nclinging together. They collect food for the community, and when an\r\nobject, too large for entrance, is brought to the nest, they enlarge\r\nthe door, and afterwards build it up again. They store up seeds, of\r\nwhich they prevent the germination, and which, if damp, are brought up\r\nto the surface to dry. They keep aphides and other insects as\r\nmilch-cows. They go out to battle in regular bands, and freely\r\nsacrifice their lives for the common weal. They emigrate according to a\r\npreconcerted plan. They capture slaves. They move the eggs of their\r\naphides, as well as their own eggs and cocoons, into warm parts of the\r\nnest, in order that they may be quickly hatched; and endless similar\r\nfacts could be given. (2. Some of the most interesting facts ever\r\npublished on the habits of ants are given by Mr. Belt, in his\r\n‘Naturalist in Nicaragua,’ 1874. See also Mr. Moggridge’s admirable\r\nwork, ‘Harvesting Ants,’ etc., 1873, also ‘L’Instinct chez les\r\nInsectes,’ by M. George Pouchet, ‘Revue des Deux Mondes,’ Feb. 1870, p.\r\n682.) On the whole, the difference in mental power between an ant and a\r\ncoccus is immense; yet no one has ever dreamed of placing these insects\r\nin distinct classes, much less in distinct kingdoms. No doubt the\r\ndifference is bridged over by other insects; and this is not the case\r\nwith man and the higher apes. But we have every reason to believe that\r\nthe breaks in the series are simply the results of many forms having\r\nbecome extinct.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen, relying chiefly on the structure of the brain, has\r\ndivided the mammalian series into four sub-classes. One of these he\r\ndevotes to man; in another he places both the marsupials and the\r\nMonotremata; so that he makes man as distinct from all other mammals as\r\nare these two latter groups conjoined. This view has not been accepted,\r\nas far as I am aware, by any naturalist capable of forming an\r\nindependent judgment, and therefore need not here be further\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nWe can understand why a classification founded on any single character\r\nor organ—even an organ so wonderfully complex and important as the\r\nbrain—or on the high development of the mental faculties, is almost\r\nsure to prove unsatisfactory. This principle has indeed been tried with\r\nhymenopterous insects; but when thus classed by their habits or\r\ninstincts, the arrangement proved thoroughly artificial. (3. Westwood,\r\n‘Modern Classification of Insects,’ vol. ii. 1840, p. 87.)\r\nClassifications may, of course, be based on any character whatever, as\r\non size, colour, or the element inhabited; but naturalists have long\r\nfelt a profound conviction that there is a natural system. This system,\r\nit is now generally admitted, must be, as far as possible, genealogical\r\nin arrangement,—that is, the co-descendants of the same form must be\r\nkept together in one group, apart from the co-descendants of any other\r\nform; but if the parent-forms are related, so will be their\r\ndescendants, and the two groups together will form a larger group. The\r\namount of difference between the several groups—that is the amount of\r\nmodification which each has undergone—is expressed by such terms as\r\ngenera, families, orders, and classes. As we have no record of the\r\nlines of descent, the pedigree can be discovered only by observing the\r\ndegrees of resemblance between the beings which are to be classed. For\r\nthis object numerous points of resemblance are of much more importance\r\nthan the amount of similarity or dissimilarity in a few points. If two\r\nlanguages were found to resemble each other in a multitude of words and\r\npoints of construction, they would be universally recognised as having\r\nsprung from a common source, notwithstanding that they differed greatly\r\nin some few words or points of construction. But with organic beings\r\nthe points of resemblance must not consist of adaptations to similar\r\nhabits of life: two animals may, for instance, have had their whole\r\nframes modified for living in the water, and yet they will not be\r\nbrought any nearer to each other in the natural system. Hence we can\r\nsee how it is that resemblances in several unimportant structures, in\r\nuseless and rudimentary organs, or not now functionally active, or in\r\nan embryological condition, are by far the most serviceable for\r\nclassification; for they can hardly be due to adaptations within a late\r\nperiod; and thus they reveal the old lines of descent or of true\r\naffinity.\r\n\r\nWe can further see why a great amount of modification in some one\r\ncharacter ought not to lead us to separate widely any two organisms. A\r\npart which already differs much from the same part in other allied\r\nforms has already, according to the theory of evolution, varied much;\r\nconsequently it would (as long as the organism remained exposed to the\r\nsame exciting conditions) be liable to further variations of the same\r\nkind; and these, if beneficial, would be preserved, and thus be\r\ncontinually augmented. In many cases the continued development of a\r\npart, for instance, of the beak of a bird, or of the teeth of a mammal,\r\nwould not aid the species in gaining its food, or for any other object;\r\nbut with man we can see no definite limit to the continued development\r\nof the brain and mental faculties, as far as advantage is concerned.\r\nTherefore in determining the position of man in the natural or\r\ngenealogical system, the extreme development of his brain ought not to\r\noutweigh a multitude of resemblances in other less important or quite\r\nunimportant points.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the\r\nwhole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed\r\nBlumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under\r\nthe title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders\r\nof the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best\r\nnaturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so\r\nremarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with\r\nthe Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this\r\nconclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in\r\nmind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great\r\ndevelopment of the brain in man, and that the strongly-marked\r\ndifferences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately\r\ninsisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from\r\ntheir differently developed brains. In the second place, we must\r\nremember that nearly all the other and more important differences\r\nbetween man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature,\r\nand relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure\r\nof his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the\r\nposition of his head. The family of Seals offers a good illustration of\r\nthe small importance of adaptive characters for classification. These\r\nanimals differ from all other Carnivora in the form of their bodies and\r\nin the structure of their limbs, far more than does man from the higher\r\napes; yet in most systems, from that of Cuvier to the most recent one\r\nby Mr. Flower (4. ‘Proceedings Zoological Society,’ 1863, p. 4.), seals\r\nare ranked as a mere family in the Order of the Carnivora. If man had\r\nnot been his own classifier, he would never have thought of founding a\r\nseparate order for his own reception.\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond my limits, and quite beyond my knowledge, even to\r\nname the innumerable points of structure in which man agrees with the\r\nother Primates. Our great anatomist and philosopher, Prof. Huxley, has\r\nfully discussed this subject (5. ‘Evidence as to Man’s Place in\r\nNature,’ 1863, p. 70, et passim.), and concludes that man in all parts\r\nof his organization differs less from the higher apes, than these do\r\nfrom the lower members of the same group. Consequently there “is no\r\njustification for placing man in a distinct order.”\r\n\r\nIn an early part of this work I brought forward various facts, shewing\r\nhow closely man agrees in constitution with the higher mammals; and\r\nthis agreement must depend on our close similarity in minute structure\r\nand chemical composition. I gave, as instances, our liability to the\r\nsame diseases, and to the attacks of allied parasites; our tastes in\r\ncommon for the same stimulants, and the similar effects produced by\r\nthem, as well as by various drugs, and other such facts.\r\n\r\nAs small unimportant points of resemblance between man and the\r\nQuadrumana are not commonly noticed in systematic works, and as, when\r\nnumerous, they clearly reveal our relationship, I will specify a few\r\nsuch points. The relative position of our features is manifestly the\r\nsame; and the various emotions are displayed by nearly similar\r\nmovements of the muscles and skin, chiefly above the eyebrows and round\r\nthe mouth. Some few expressions are, indeed, almost the same, as in the\r\nweeping of certain kinds of monkeys and in the laughing noise made by\r\nothers, during which the corners of the mouth are drawn backwards, and\r\nthe lower eyelids wrinkled. The external ears are curiously alike. In\r\nman the nose is much more prominent than in most monkeys; but we may\r\ntrace the commencement of an aquiline curvature in the nose of the\r\nHoolock Gibbon; and this in the Semnopithecus nasica is carried to a\r\nridiculous extreme.\r\n\r\nThe faces of many monkeys are ornamented with beards, whiskers, or\r\nmoustaches. The hair on the head grows to a great length in some\r\nspecies of Semnopithecus (6. Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, ‘Hist. Nat.\r\nGen.’ tom. ii. 1859, p. 217.); and in the Bonnet monkey (Macacus\r\nradiatus) it radiates from a point on the crown, with a parting down\r\nthe middle. It is commonly said that the forehead gives to man his\r\nnoble and intellectual appearance; but the thick hair on the head of\r\nthe Bonnet monkey terminates downwards abruptly, and is succeeded by\r\nhair so short and fine that at a little distance the forehead, with the\r\nexception of the eyebrows, appears quite naked. It has been erroneously\r\nasserted that eyebrows are not present in any monkey. In the species\r\njust named the degree of nakedness of the forehead differs in different\r\nindividuals; and Eschricht states (7. ‘Über die Richtung der Haare,’\r\netc., Müller’s ‘Archiv fur Anat. und Phys.’ 1837, s. 51.) that in our\r\nchildren the limit between the hairy scalp and the naked forehead is\r\nsometimes not well defined; so that here we seem to have a trifling\r\ncase of reversion to a progenitor, in whom the forehead had not as yet\r\nbecome quite naked.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the hair on our arms tends to converge from above\r\nand below to a point at the elbow. This curious arrangement, so unlike\r\nthat in most of the lower mammals, is common to the gorilla,\r\nchimpanzee, orang, some species of Hylobates, and even to some few\r\nAmerican monkeys. But in Hylobates agilis the hair on the fore-arm is\r\ndirected downwards or towards the wrist in the ordinary manner; and in\r\nH. lar it is nearly erect, with only a very slight forward inclination;\r\nso that in this latter species it is in a transitional state. It can\r\nhardly be doubted that with most mammals the thickness of the hair on\r\nthe back and its direction, is adapted to throw off the rain; even the\r\ntransverse hairs on the fore-legs of a dog may serve for this end when\r\nhe is coiled up asleep. Mr. Wallace, who has carefully studied the\r\nhabits of the orang, remarks that the convergence of the hair towards\r\nthe elbow on the arms of the orang may be explained as serving to throw\r\noff the rain, for this animal during rainy weather sits with its arms\r\nbent, and with the hands clasped round a branch or over its head.\r\nAccording to Livingstone, the gorilla also “sits in pelting rain with\r\nhis hands over his head.” (8. Quoted by Reade, ‘The African Sketch\r\nBook,’ vol i. 1873, p. 152.) If the above explanation is correct, as\r\nseems probable, the direction of the hair on our own arms offers a\r\ncurious record of our former state; for no one supposes that it is now\r\nof any use in throwing off the rain; nor, in our present erect\r\ncondition, is it properly directed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be rash to trust too much to the principle of\r\nadaptation in regard to the direction of the hair in man or his early\r\nprogenitors; for it is impossible to study the figures given by\r\nEschricht of the arrangement of the hair on the human foetus (this\r\nbeing the same as in the adult) and not agree with this excellent\r\nobserver that other and more complex causes have intervened. The points\r\nof convergence seem to stand in some relation to those points in the\r\nembryo which are last closed in during development. There appears,\r\nalso, to exist some relation between the arrangement of the hair on the\r\nlimbs, and the course of the medullary arteries. (9. On the hair in\r\nHylobates, see ‘Natural History of Mammals,’ by C.L. Martin, 1841, p.\r\n415. Also, Isidore Geoffroy on the American monkeys and other kinds,\r\n‘Hist. Nat. Gen.’ vol. ii. 1859, pp. 216, 243. Eschricht, ibid. s. 46,\r\n55, 61. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 619. Wallace,\r\n‘Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,’ 1870, p. 344.)\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the resemblances between man and certain\r\napes in the above and in many other points—such as in having a naked\r\nforehead, long tresses on the head, etc.,—are all necessarily the\r\nresult of unbroken inheritance from a common progenitor, or of\r\nsubsequent reversion. Many of these resemblances are more probably due\r\nto analogous variation, which follows, as I have elsewhere attempted to\r\nshew (10. ‘Origin of Species,’ 5th edit. 1869, p.194. ‘The Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. 1868, p. 348.), from\r\nco-descended organisms having a similar constitution, and having been\r\nacted on by like causes inducing similar modifications. With respect to\r\nthe similar direction of the hair on the fore-arms of man and certain\r\nmonkeys, as this character is common to almost all the anthropomorphous\r\napes, it may probably be attributed to inheritance; but this is not\r\ncertain, as some very distinct American monkeys are thus characterised.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have now seen, man has no just right to form a separate\r\nOrder for his own reception, he may perhaps claim a distinct Sub-order\r\nor Family. Prof. Huxley, in his last work (11. ‘An Introduction to the\r\nClassification of Animals,’ 1869, p. 99.), divides the primates into\r\nthree Sub-orders; namely, the Anthropidae with man alone, the Simiadae\r\nincluding monkeys of all kinds, and the Lemuridae with the diversified\r\ngenera of lemurs. As far as differences in certain important points of\r\nstructure are concerned, man may no doubt rightly claim the rank of a\r\nSub-order; and this rank is too low, if we look chiefly to his mental\r\nfaculties. Nevertheless, from a genealogical point of view it appears\r\nthat this rank is too high, and that man ought to form merely a Family,\r\nor possibly even only a Sub-family. If we imagine three lines of\r\ndescent proceeding from a common stock, it is quite conceivable that\r\ntwo of them might after the lapse of ages be so slightly changed as\r\nstill to remain as species of the same genus, whilst the third line\r\nmight become so greatly modified as to deserve to rank as a distinct\r\nSub-family, Family, or even Order. But in this case it is almost\r\ncertain that the third line would still retain through inheritance\r\nnumerous small points of resemblance with the other two. Here, then,\r\nwould occur the difficulty, at present insoluble, how much weight we\r\nought to assign in our classifications to strongly-marked differences\r\nin some few points,—that is, to the amount of modification undergone;\r\nand how much to close resemblance in numerous unimportant points, as\r\nindicating the lines of descent or genealogy. To attach much weight to\r\nthe few but strong differences is the most obvious and perhaps the\r\nsafest course, though it appears more correct to pay great attention to\r\nthe many small resemblances, as giving a truly natural classification.\r\n\r\nIn forming a judgment on this head with reference to man, we must\r\nglance at the classification of the Simiadae. This family is divided by\r\nalmost all naturalists into the Catarrhine group, or Old World monkeys,\r\nall of which are characterised (as their name expresses) by the\r\npeculiar structure of their nostrils, and by having four premolars in\r\neach jaw; and into the Platyrrhine group or New World monkeys\r\n(including two very distinct sub-groups), all of which are\r\ncharacterised by differently constructed nostrils, and by having six\r\npremolars in each jaw. Some other small differences might be mentioned.\r\nNow man unquestionably belongs in his dentition, in the structure of\r\nhis nostrils, and some other respects, to the Catarrhine or Old World\r\ndivision; nor does he resemble the Platyrrhines more closely than the\r\nCatarrhines in any characters, excepting in a few of not much\r\nimportance and apparently of an adaptive nature. It is therefore\r\nagainst all probability that some New World species should have\r\nformerly varied and produced a man-like creature, with all the\r\ndistinctive characters proper to the Old World division; losing at the\r\nsame time all its own distinctive characters. There can, consequently,\r\nhardly be a doubt that man is an off-shoot from the Old World Simian\r\nstem; and that under a genealogical point of view he must be classed\r\nwith the Catarrhine division. (12. This is nearly the same\r\nclassification as that provisionally adopted by Mr. St. George Mivart,\r\n(‘Transactions, Philosophical Society,” 1867, p. 300), who, after\r\nseparating the Lemuridae, divides the remainder of the Primates into\r\nthe Hominidae, the Simiadae which answer to the Catarrhines, the\r\nCebidae, and the Hapalidae,—these two latter groups answering to the\r\nPlatyrrhines. Mr. Mivart still abides by the same view; see ‘Nature,’\r\n1871, p. 481.)\r\n\r\nThe anthropomorphous apes, namely the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and\r\nhylobates, are by most naturalists separated from the other Old World\r\nmonkeys, as a distinct sub-group. I am aware that Gratiolet, relying on\r\nthe structure of the brain, does not admit the existence of this\r\nsub-group, and no doubt it is a broken one. Thus the orang, as Mr. St.\r\nG. Mivart remarks, “is one of the most peculiar and aberrant forms to\r\nbe found in the Order.” (13. ‘Transactions, Zoolog. Soc.’ vol. vi.\r\n1867, p. 214.) The remaining non-anthropomorphous Old World monkeys,\r\nare again divided by some naturalists into two or three smaller\r\nsub-groups; the genus Semnopithecus, with its peculiar sacculated\r\nstomach, being the type of one sub-group. But it appears from M.\r\nGaudry’s wonderful discoveries in Attica, that during the Miocene\r\nperiod a form existed there, which connected Semnopithecus and Macacus;\r\nand this probably illustrates the manner in which the other and higher\r\ngroups were once blended together.\r\n\r\nIf the anthropomorphous apes be admitted to form a natural sub-group,\r\nthen as man agrees with them, not only in all those characters which he\r\npossesses in common with the whole Catarrhine group, but in other\r\npeculiar characters, such as the absence of a tail and of callosities,\r\nand in general appearance, we may infer that some ancient member of the\r\nanthropomorphous sub-group gave birth to man. It is not probable that,\r\nthrough the law of analogous variation, a member of one of the other\r\nlower sub-groups should have given rise to a man-like creature,\r\nresembling the higher anthropomorphous apes in so many respects. No\r\ndoubt man, in comparison with most of his allies, has undergone an\r\nextraordinary amount of modification, chiefly in consequence of the\r\ngreat development of his brain and his erect position; nevertheless, we\r\nshould bear in mind that he “is but one of several exceptional forms of\r\nPrimates.” (14. Mr. St. G. Mivart, ‘Transactions of the Philosophical\r\nSociety,’ 1867, p. 410.)\r\n\r\nEvery naturalist, who believes in the principle of evolution, will\r\ngrant that the two main divisions of the Simiadae, namely the\r\nCatarrhine and Platyrrhine monkeys, with their sub-groups, have all\r\nproceeded from some one extremely ancient progenitor. The early\r\ndescendants of this progenitor, before they had diverged to any\r\nconsiderable extent from each other, would still have formed a single\r\nnatural group; but some of the species or incipient genera would have\r\nalready begun to indicate by their diverging characters the future\r\ndistinctive marks of the Catarrhine and Platyrrhine divisions. Hence\r\nthe members of this supposed ancient group would not have been so\r\nuniform in their dentition, or in the structure of their nostrils, as\r\nare the existing Catarrhine monkeys in one way and the Platyrrhines in\r\nanother way, but would have resembled in this respect the allied\r\nLemuridae, which differ greatly from each other in the form of their\r\nmuzzles (15. Messrs. Murie and Mivart on the Lemuroidea, ‘Transactions,\r\nZoological Society,’ vol. vii, 1869, p. 5.), and to an extraordinary\r\ndegree in their dentition.\r\n\r\nThe Catarrhine and Platyrrhine monkeys agree in a multitude of\r\ncharacters, as is shewn by their unquestionably belonging to one and\r\nthe same Order. The many characters which they possess in common can\r\nhardly have been independently acquired by so many distinct species; so\r\nthat these characters must have been inherited. But a naturalist would\r\nundoubtedly have ranked as an ape or a monkey, an ancient form which\r\npossessed many characters common to the Catarrhine and Platyrrhine\r\nmonkeys, other characters in an intermediate condition, and some few,\r\nperhaps, distinct from those now found in either group. And as man from\r\na genealogical point of view belongs to the Catarrhine or Old World\r\nstock, we must conclude, however much the conclusion may revolt our\r\npride, that our early progenitors would have been properly thus\r\ndesignated. (16. Haeckel has come to this same conclusion. See ‘Über\r\ndie Entstehung des Menschengeschlechts,’ in Virchow’s ‘Sammlung.\r\ngemein. wissen. Vorträge,’ 1868, s. 61. Also his ‘Natürliche\r\nSchöpfungsgeschichte,’ 1868, in which he gives in detail his views on\r\nthe genealogy of man.) But we must not fall into the error of supposing\r\nthat the early progenitor of the whole Simian stock, including man, was\r\nidentical with, or even closely resembled, any existing ape or monkey.\r\n\r\nON THE BIRTHPLACE AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN.\r\n\r\nWe are naturally led to enquire, where was the birthplace of man at\r\nthat stage of descent when our progenitors diverged from the Catarrhine\r\nstock? The fact that they belonged to this stock clearly shews that\r\nthey inhabited the Old World; but not Australia nor any oceanic island,\r\nas we may infer from the laws of geographical distribution. In each\r\ngreat region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the\r\nextinct species of the same region. It is therefore probable that\r\nAfrica was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the\r\ngorilla and chimpanzee; and as these two species are now man’s nearest\r\nallies, it is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived\r\non the African continent than elsewhere. But it is useless to speculate\r\non this subject; for two or three anthropomorphous apes, one the\r\nDryopithecus (17. Dr. C. Forsyth Major, ‘Sur les Singes fossiles\r\ntrouvés en Italie:’ ‘Soc. Ital. des Sc. Nat.’ tom. xv. 1872.) of\r\nLartet, nearly as large as a man, and closely allied to Hylobates,\r\nexisted in Europe during the Miocene age; and since so remote a period\r\nthe earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has\r\nbeen ample time for migration on the largest scale.\r\n\r\nAt the period and place, whenever and wherever it was, when man first\r\nlost his hairy covering, he probably inhabited a hot country; a\r\ncircumstance favourable for the frugiferous diet on which, judging from\r\nanalogy, he subsisted. We are far from knowing how long ago it was when\r\nman first diverged from the Catarrhine stock; but it may have occurred\r\nat an epoch as remote as the Eocene period; for that the higher apes\r\nhad diverged from the lower apes as early as the Upper Miocene period\r\nis shewn by the existence of the Dryopithecus. We are also quite\r\nignorant at how rapid a rate organisms, whether high or low in the\r\nscale, may be modified under favourable circumstances; we know,\r\nhowever, that some have retained the same form during an enormous lapse\r\nof time. From what we see going on under domestication, we learn that\r\nsome of the co-descendants of the same species may be not at all, some\r\na little, and some greatly changed, all within the same period. Thus it\r\nmay have been with man, who has undergone a great amount of\r\nmodification in certain characters in comparison with the higher apes.\r\n\r\nThe great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest\r\nallies, which cannot be bridged over by any extinct or living species,\r\nhas often been advanced as a grave objection to the belief that man is\r\ndescended from some lower form; but this objection will not appear of\r\nmuch weight to those who, from general reasons, believe in the general\r\nprinciple of evolution. Breaks often occur in all parts of the series,\r\nsome being wide, sharp and defined, others less so in various degrees;\r\nas between the orang and its nearest allies—between the Tarsius and the\r\nother Lemuridae—between the elephant, and in a more striking manner\r\nbetween the Ornithorhynchus or Echidna, and all other mammals. But\r\nthese breaks depend merely on the number of related forms which have\r\nbecome extinct. At some future period, not very distant as measured by\r\ncenturies, the civilised races of man will almost certainly\r\nexterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the\r\nsame time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has\r\nremarked (18. ‘Anthropological Review,’ April 1867, p. 236.), will no\r\ndoubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies\r\nwill then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more\r\ncivilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape\r\nas low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian\r\nand the gorilla.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the absence of fossil remains, serving to connect man\r\nwith his ape-like progenitors, no one will lay much stress on this fact\r\nwho reads Sir C. Lyell’s discussion (19. ‘Elements of Geology,’ 1865,\r\npp. 583-585. ‘Antiquity of Man,’ 1863, p. 145.), where he shews that in\r\nall the vertebrate classes the discovery of fossil remains has been a\r\nvery slow and fortuitous process. Nor should it be forgotten that those\r\nregions which are the most likely to afford remains connecting man with\r\nsome extinct ape-like creature, have not as yet been searched by\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nLOWER STAGES IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that man appears to have diverged from the Catarrhine or\r\nOld World division of the Simiadae, after these had diverged from the\r\nNew World division. We will now endeavour to follow the remote traces\r\nof his genealogy, trusting principally to the mutual affinities between\r\nthe various classes and orders, with some slight reference to the\r\nperiods, as far as ascertained, of their successive appearance on the\r\nearth. The Lemuridae stand below and near to the Simiadae, and\r\nconstitute a very distinct family of the primates, or, according to\r\nHaeckel and others, a distinct Order. This group is diversified and\r\nbroken to an extraordinary degree, and includes many aberrant forms. It\r\nhas, therefore, probably suffered much extinction. Most of the remnants\r\nsurvive on islands, such as Madagascar and the Malayan archipelago,\r\nwhere they have not been exposed to so severe a competition as they\r\nwould have been on well-stocked continents. This group likewise\r\npresents many gradations, leading, as Huxley remarks (20. ‘Man’s Place\r\nin Nature,’ p. 105.), “insensibly from the crown and summit of the\r\nanimal creation down to creatures from which there is but a step, as it\r\nseems, to the lowest, smallest, and least intelligent of the placental\r\nmammalia.” From these various considerations it is probable that the\r\nSimiadae were originally developed from the progenitors of the existing\r\nLemuridae; and these in their turn from forms standing very low in the\r\nmammalian series.\r\n\r\nThe Marsupials stand in many important characters below the placental\r\nmammals. They appeared at an earlier geological period, and their range\r\nwas formerly much more extensive than at present. Hence the Placentata\r\nare generally supposed to have been derived from the Implacentata or\r\nMarsupials; not, however, from forms closely resembling the existing\r\nMarsupials, but from their early progenitors. The Monotremata are\r\nplainly allied to the Marsupials, forming a third and still lower\r\ndivision in the great mammalian series. They are represented at the\r\npresent day solely by the Ornithorhynchus and Echidna; and these two\r\nforms may be safely considered as relics of a much larger group,\r\nrepresentatives of which have been preserved in Australia through some\r\nfavourable concurrence of circumstances. The Monotremata are eminently\r\ninteresting, as leading in several important points of structure\r\ntowards the class of reptiles.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to trace the genealogy of the Mammalia, and therefore of\r\nman, lower down in the series, we become involved in greater and\r\ngreater obscurity; but as a most capable judge, Mr. Parker, has\r\nremarked, we have good reason to believe, that no true bird or reptile\r\nintervenes in the direct line of descent. He who wishes to see what\r\ningenuity and knowledge can effect, may consult Prof. Haeckel’s works.\r\n(21. Elaborate tables are given in his ‘Generelle Morphologie’ (B. ii.\r\ns. cliii. and s. 425); and with more especial reference to man in his\r\n‘Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte,’ 1868. Prof. Huxley, in reviewing\r\nthis latter work (‘The Academy,’ 1869, p. 42) says, that he considers\r\nthe phylum or lines of descent of the Vertebrata to be admirably\r\ndiscussed by Haeckel, although he differs on some points. He expresses,\r\nalso, his high estimate of the general tenor and spirit of the whole\r\nwork.) I will content myself with a few general remarks. Every\r\nevolutionist will admit that the five great vertebrate classes, namely,\r\nmammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes, are descended from\r\nsome one prototype; for they have much in common, especially during\r\ntheir embryonic state. As the class of fishes is the most lowly\r\norganised, and appeared before the others, we may conclude that all the\r\nmembers of the vertebrate kingdom are derived from some fishlike\r\nanimal. The belief that animals so distinct as a monkey, an elephant, a\r\nhumming-bird, a snake, a frog, and a fish, etc., could all have sprung\r\nfrom the same parents, will appear monstrous to those who have not\r\nattended to the recent progress of natural history. For this belief\r\nimplies the former existence of links binding closely together all\r\nthese forms, now so utterly unlike.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is certain that groups of animals have existed, or do\r\nnow exist, which serve to connect several of the great vertebrate\r\nclasses more or less closely. We have seen that the Ornithorhynchus\r\ngraduates towards reptiles; and Prof. Huxley has discovered, and is\r\nconfirmed by Mr. Cope and others, that the Dinosaurians are in many\r\nimportant characters intermediate between certain reptiles and certain\r\nbirds—the birds referred to being the ostrich-tribe (itself evidently a\r\nwidely-diffused remnant of a larger group) and the Archeopteryx, that\r\nstrange Secondary bird, with a long lizard-like tail. Again, according\r\nto Prof. Owen (22. ‘Palaeontology’ 1860, p. 199.), the\r\nIchthyosaurians—great sea-lizards furnished with paddles—present many\r\naffinities with fishes, or rather, according to Huxley, with\r\namphibians; a class which, including in its highest division frogs and\r\ntoads, is plainly allied to the Ganoid fishes. These latter fishes\r\nswarmed during the earlier geological periods, and were constructed on\r\nwhat is called a generalised type, that is, they presented diversified\r\naffinities with other groups of organisms. The Lepidosiren is also so\r\nclosely allied to amphibians and fishes, that naturalists long disputed\r\nin which of these two classes to rank it; it, and also some few Ganoid\r\nfishes, have been preserved from utter extinction by inhabiting rivers,\r\nwhich are harbours of refuge, and are related to the great waters of\r\nthe ocean in the same way that islands are to continents.\r\n\r\nLastly, one single member of the immense and diversified class of\r\nfishes, namely, the lancelet or amphioxus, is so different from all\r\nother fishes, that Haeckel maintains that it ought to form a distinct\r\nclass in the vertebrate kingdom. This fish is remarkable for its\r\nnegative characters; it can hardly be said to possess a brain,\r\nvertebral column, or heart, etc.; so that it was classed by the older\r\nnaturalists amongst the worms. Many years ago Prof. Goodsir perceived\r\nthat the lancelet presented some affinities with the Ascidians, which\r\nare invertebrate, hermaphrodite, marine creatures permanently attached\r\nto a support. They hardly appear like animals, and consist of a simple,\r\ntough, leathery sack, with two small projecting orifices. They belong\r\nto the Mulluscoida of Huxley—a lower division of the great kingdom of\r\nthe Mollusca; but they have recently been placed by some naturalists\r\namongst the Vermes or worms. Their larvae somewhat resemble tadpoles in\r\nshape (23. At the Falkland Islands I had the satisfaction of seeing, in\r\nApril, 1833, and therefore some years before any other naturalist, the\r\nlocomotive larvae of a compound Ascidian, closely allied to Synoicum,\r\nbut apparently generically distinct from it. The tail was about five\r\ntimes as long as the oblong head, and terminated in a very fine\r\nfilament. It was, as sketched by me under a simple microscope, plainly\r\ndivided by transverse opaque partitions, which I presume represent the\r\ngreat cells figured by Kovalevsky. At an early stage of development the\r\ntail was closely coiled round the head of the larva.), and have the\r\npower of swimming freely about. Mr. Kovalevsky (24. ‘Memoires de\r\nl’Acad. des Sciences de St. Petersbourg,’ tom. x. No. 15, 1866.) has\r\nlately observed that the larvae of Ascidians are related to the\r\nVertebrata, in their manner of development, in the relative position of\r\nthe nervous system, and in possessing a structure closely like the\r\nchorda dorsalis of vertebrate animals; and in this he has been since\r\nconfirmed by Prof. Kupffer. M. Kovalevsky writes to me from Naples,\r\nthat he has now carried these observations yet further, and should his\r\nresults be well established, the whole will form a discovery of the\r\nvery greatest value. Thus, if we may rely on embryology, ever the\r\nsafest guide in classification, it seems that we have at last gained a\r\nclue to the source whence the Vertebrata were derived. (25. But I am\r\nbound to add that some competent judges dispute this conclusion; for\r\ninstance, M. Giard, in a series of papers in the ‘Archives de Zoologie\r\nExperimentale,’ for 1872. Nevertheless, this naturalist remarks, p.\r\n281, “L’organisation de la larve ascidienne en dehors de toute\r\nhypothèse et de toute théorie, nous montre comment la nature peut\r\nproduire la disposition fondamentale du type vertébré (l’existence\r\nd’une corde dorsale) chez un invertébré par la seule condition vitale\r\nde l’adaptation, et cette simple possibilité du passage supprime\r\nl’abîme entre les deux sous-règnes, encore bien qu’en ignore par où le\r\npassage s’est fait en realité.”) We should then be justified in\r\nbelieving that at an extremely remote period a group of animals\r\nexisted, resembling in many respects the larvae of our present\r\nAscidians, which diverged into two great branches—the one retrograding\r\nin development and producing the present class of Ascidians, the other\r\nrising to the crown and summit of the animal kingdom by giving birth to\r\nthe Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far endeavoured rudely to trace the genealogy of the\r\nVertebrata by the aid of their mutual affinities. We will now look to\r\nman as he exists; and we shall, I think, be able partially to restore\r\nthe structure of our early progenitors, during successive periods, but\r\nnot in due order of time. This can be effected by means of the\r\nrudiments which man still retains, by the characters which occasionally\r\nmake their appearance in him through reversion, and by the aid of the\r\nprinciples of morphology and embryology. The various facts, to which I\r\nshall here allude, have been given in the previous chapters.\r\n\r\nThe early progenitors of man must have been once covered with hair,\r\nboth sexes having beards; their ears were probably pointed, and capable\r\nof movement; and their bodies were provided with a tail, having the\r\nproper muscles. Their limbs and bodies were also acted on by many\r\nmuscles which now only occasionally reappear, but are normally present\r\nin the Quadrumana. At this or some earlier period, the great artery and\r\nnerve of the humerus ran through a supra-condyloid foramen. The\r\nintestine gave forth a much larger diverticulum or caecum than that now\r\nexisting. The foot was then prehensile, judging from the condition of\r\nthe great toe in the foetus; and our progenitors, no doubt, were\r\narboreal in their habits, and frequented some warm, forest-clad land.\r\nThe males had great canine teeth, which served them as formidable\r\nweapons. At a much earlier period the uterus was double; the excreta\r\nwere voided through a cloaca; and the eye was protected by a third\r\neyelid or nictitating membrane. At a still earlier period the\r\nprogenitors of man must have been aquatic in their habits; for\r\nmorphology plainly tells us that our lungs consist of a modified\r\nswim-bladder, which once served as a float. The clefts on the neck in\r\nthe embryo of man shew where the branchiae once existed. In the lunar\r\nor weekly recurrent periods of some of our functions we apparently\r\nstill retain traces of our primordial birthplace, a shore washed by the\r\ntides. At about this same early period the true kidneys were replaced\r\nby the corpora wolffiana. The heart existed as a simple pulsating\r\nvessel; and the chorda dorsalis took the place of a vertebral column.\r\nThese early ancestors of man, thus seen in the dim recesses of time,\r\nmust have been as simply, or even still more simply organised than the\r\nlancelet or amphioxus.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point deserving a fuller notice. It has long been\r\nknown that in the vertebrate kingdom one sex bears rudiments of various\r\naccessory parts, appertaining to the reproductive system, which\r\nproperly belong to the opposite sex; and it has now been ascertained\r\nthat at a very early embryonic period both sexes possess true male and\r\nfemale glands. Hence some remote progenitor of the whole vertebrate\r\nkingdom appears to have been hermaphrodite or androgynous. (26. This is\r\nthe conclusion of Prof. Gegenbaur, one of the highest authorities in\r\ncomparative anatomy: see ‘Grundzüge der vergleich. Anat.’ 1870, s. 876.\r\nThe result has been arrived at chiefly from the study of the Amphibia;\r\nbut it appears from the researches of Waldeyer (as quoted in ‘Journal\r\nof Anat. and Phys.’ 1869, p. 161), that the sexual organs of even “the\r\nhigher vertebrata are, in their early condition, hermaphrodite.”\r\nSimilar views have long been held by some authors, though until\r\nrecently without a firm basis.) But here we encounter a singular\r\ndifficulty. In the mammalian class the males possess rudiments of a\r\nuterus with the adjacent passage, in their vesiculae prostaticae; they\r\nbear also rudiments of mammae, and some male Marsupials have traces of\r\na marsupial sack. (27. The male Thylacinus offers the best instance.\r\nOwen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 771.) Other analogous\r\nfacts could be added. Are we, then, to suppose that some extremely\r\nancient mammal continued androgynous, after it had acquired the chief\r\ndistinctions of its class, and therefore after it had diverged from the\r\nlower classes of the vertebrate kingdom? This seems very improbable,\r\nfor we have to look to fishes, the lowest of all the classes, to find\r\nany still existent androgynous forms. (28. Hermaphroditism has been\r\nobserved in several species of Serranus, as well as in some other\r\nfishes, where it is either normal and symmetrical, or abnormal and\r\nunilateral. Dr. Zouteveen has given me references on this subject, more\r\nespecially to a paper by Prof. Halbertsma, in the ‘Transact. of the\r\nDutch Acad. of Sciences,’ vol. xvi. Dr. Gunther doubts the fact, but it\r\nhas now been recorded by too many good observers to be any longer\r\ndisputed. Dr. M. Lessona writes to me, that he has verified the\r\nobservations made by Cavolini on Serranus. Prof. Ercolani has recently\r\nshewn (‘Accad. delle Scienze,’ Bologna, Dec. 28, 1871) that eels are\r\nandrogynous.) That various accessory parts, proper to each sex, are\r\nfound in a rudimentary condition in the opposite sex, may be explained\r\nby such organs having been gradually acquired by the one sex, and then\r\ntransmitted in a more or less imperfect state to the other. When we\r\ntreat of sexual selection, we shall meet with innumerable instances of\r\nthis form of transmission,—as in the case of the spurs, plumes, and\r\nbrilliant colours, acquired for battle or ornament by male birds, and\r\ninherited by the females in an imperfect or rudimentary condition.\r\n\r\nThe possession by male mammals of functionally imperfect mammary organs\r\nis, in some respects, especially curious. The Monotremata have the\r\nproper milk-secreting glands with orifices, but no nipples; and as\r\nthese animals stand at the very base of the mammalian series, it is\r\nprobable that the progenitors of the class also had milk-secreting\r\nglands, but no nipples. This conclusion is supported by what is known\r\nof their manner of development; for Professor Turner informs me, on the\r\nauthority of Kolliker and Langer, that in the embryo the mammary glands\r\ncan be distinctly traced before the nipples are in the least visible;\r\nand the development of successive parts in the individual generally\r\nrepresents and accords with the development of successive beings in the\r\nsame line of descent. The Marsupials differ from the Monotremata by\r\npossessing nipples; so that probably these organs were first acquired\r\nby the Marsupials, after they had diverged from, and risen above, the\r\nMonotremata, and were then transmitted to the placental mammals. (29.\r\nProf. Gegenbaur has shewn (‘Jenäische Zeitschrift,’ Bd. vii. p. 212)\r\nthat two distinct types of nipples prevail throughout the several\r\nmammalian orders, but that it is quite intelligible how both could have\r\nbeen derived from the nipples of the Marsupials, and the latter from\r\nthose of the Monotremata. See, also, a memoir by Dr. Max Huss, on the\r\nmammary glands, ibid. B. viii. p. 176.) No one will suppose that the\r\nmarsupials still remained androgynous, after they had approximately\r\nacquired their present structure. How then are we to account for male\r\nmammals possessing mammae? It is possible that they were first\r\ndeveloped in the females and then transferred to the males, but from\r\nwhat follows this is hardly probable.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested, as another view, that long after the progenitors\r\nof the whole mammalian class had ceased to be androgynous, both sexes\r\nyielded milk, and thus nourished their young; and in the case of the\r\nMarsupials, that both sexes carried their young in marsupial sacks.\r\nThis will not appear altogether improbable, if we reflect that the\r\nmales of existing syngnathous fishes receive the eggs of the females in\r\ntheir abdominal pouches, hatch them, and afterwards, as some believe,\r\nnourish the young (30. Mr. Lockwood believes (as quoted in ‘Quart.\r\nJournal of Science,’ April 1868, p. 269), from what he has observed of\r\nthe development of Hippocampus, that the walls of the abdominal pouch\r\nof the male in some way afford nourishment. On male fishes hatching the\r\nova in their mouths, see a very interesting paper by Prof. Wyman, in\r\n‘Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.’ Sept. 15, 1857; also Prof. Turner, in\r\n‘Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,’ Nov. 1, 1866, p. 78. Dr. Gunther\r\nhas likewise described similar cases.);—that certain other male fishes\r\nhatch the eggs within their mouths or branchial cavities;—that certain\r\nmale toads take the chaplets of eggs from the females, and wind them\r\nround their own thighs, keeping them there until the tadpoles are\r\nborn;—that certain male birds undertake the whole duty of incubation,\r\nand that male pigeons, as well as the females, feed their nestlings\r\nwith a secretion from their crops. But the above suggestion first\r\noccurred to me from mammary glands of male mammals being so much more\r\nperfectly developed than the rudiments of the other accessory\r\nreproductive parts, which are found in the one sex though proper to the\r\nother. The mammary glands and nipples, as they exist in male mammals,\r\ncan indeed hardly be called rudimentary; they are merely not fully\r\ndeveloped, and not functionally active. They are sympathetically\r\naffected under the influence of certain diseases, like the same organs\r\nin the female. They often secrete a few drops of milk at birth and at\r\npuberty: this latter fact occurred in the curious case, before referred\r\nto, where a young man possessed two pairs of mammae. In man and some\r\nother male mammals these organs have been known occasionally to become\r\nso well developed during maturity as to yield a fair supply of milk.\r\nNow if we suppose that during a former prolonged period male mammals\r\naided the females in nursing their offspring (31. Mlle. C. Royer has\r\nsuggested a similar view in her ‘Origine de l’homme,’ etc., 1870.), and\r\nthat afterwards from some cause (as from the production of a smaller\r\nnumber of young) the males ceased to give this aid, disuse of the\r\norgans during maturity would lead to their becoming inactive; and from\r\ntwo well-known principles of inheritance, this state of inactivity\r\nwould probably be transmitted to the males at the corresponding age of\r\nmaturity. But at an earlier age these organs would be left unaffected,\r\nso that they would be almost equally well developed in the young of\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\n—CONCLUSION—\r\n\r\nVon Baer has defined advancement or progress in the organic scale\r\nbetter than any one else, as resting on the amount of differentiation\r\nand specialisation of the several parts of a being,—when arrived at\r\nmaturity, as I should be inclined to add. Now as organisms have become\r\nslowly adapted to diversified lines of life by means of natural\r\nselection, their parts will have become more and more differentiated\r\nand specialised for various functions from the advantage gained by the\r\ndivision of physiological labour. The same part appears often to have\r\nbeen modified first for one purpose, and then long afterwards for some\r\nother and quite distinct purpose; and thus all the parts are rendered\r\nmore and more complex. But each organism still retains the general type\r\nof structure of the progenitor from which it was aboriginally derived.\r\nIn accordance with this view it seems, if we turn to geological\r\nevidence, that organisation on the whole has advanced throughout the\r\nworld by slow and interrupted steps. In the great kingdom of the\r\nVertebrata it has culminated in man. It must not, however, be supposed\r\nthat groups of organic beings are always supplanted, and disappear as\r\nsoon as they have given birth to other and more perfect groups. The\r\nlatter, though victorious over their predecessors, may not have become\r\nbetter adapted for all places in the economy of nature. Some old forms\r\nappear to have survived from inhabiting protected sites, where they\r\nhave not been exposed to very severe competition; and these often aid\r\nus in constructing our genealogies, by giving us a fair idea of former\r\nand lost populations. But we must not fall into the error of looking at\r\nthe existing members of any lowly-organised group as perfect\r\nrepresentatives of their ancient predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient progenitors in the kingdom of the Vertebrata, at which\r\nwe are able to obtain an obscure glance, apparently consisted of a\r\ngroup of marine animals (32. The inhabitants of the seashore must be\r\ngreatly affected by the tides; animals living either about the MEAN\r\nhigh-water mark, or about the MEAN low-water mark, pass through a\r\ncomplete cycle of tidal changes in a fortnight. Consequently, their\r\nfood supply will undergo marked changes week by week. The vital\r\nfunctions of such animals, living under these conditions for many\r\ngenerations, can hardly fail to run their course in regular weekly\r\nperiods. Now it is a mysterious fact that in the higher and now\r\nterrestrial Vertebrata, as well as in other classes, many normal and\r\nabnormal processes have one or more whole weeks as their periods; this\r\nwould be rendered intelligible if the Vertebrata are descended from an\r\nanimal allied to the existing tidal Ascidians. Many instances of such\r\nperiodic processes might be given, as the gestation of mammals, the\r\nduration of fevers, etc. The hatching of eggs affords also a good\r\nexample, for, according to Mr. Bartlett (‘Land and Water,’ Jan. 7,\r\n1871), the eggs of the pigeon are hatched in two weeks; those of the\r\nfowl in three; those of the duck in four; those of the goose in five;\r\nand those of the ostrich in seven weeks. As far as we can judge, a\r\nrecurrent period, if approximately of the right duration for any\r\nprocess or function, would not, when once gained, be liable to change;\r\nconsequently it might be thus transmitted through almost any number of\r\ngenerations. But if the function changed, the period would have to\r\nchange, and would be apt to change almost abruptly by a whole week.\r\nThis conclusion, if sound, is highly remarkable; for the period of\r\ngestation in each mammal, and the hatching of each bird’s eggs, and\r\nmany other vital processes, thus betray to us the primordial birthplace\r\nof these animals.), resembling the larvae of existing Ascidians. These\r\nanimals probably gave rise to a group of fishes, as lowly organised as\r\nthe lancelet; and from these the Ganoids, and other fishes like the\r\nLepidosiren, must have been developed. From such fish a very small\r\nadvance would carry us on to the Amphibians. We have seen that birds\r\nand reptiles were once intimately connected together; and the\r\nMonotremata now connect mammals with reptiles in a slight degree. But\r\nno one can at present say by what line of descent the three higher and\r\nrelated classes, namely, mammals, birds, and reptiles, were derived\r\nfrom the two lower vertebrate classes, namely, amphibians and fishes.\r\nIn the class of mammals the steps are not difficult to conceive which\r\nled from the ancient Monotremata to the ancient Marsupials; and from\r\nthese to the early progenitors of the placental mammals. We may thus\r\nascend to the Lemuridae; and the interval is not very wide from these\r\nto the Simiadae. The Simiadae then branched off into two great stems,\r\nthe New World and Old World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote\r\nperiod, Man, the wonder and glory of the Universe, proceeded.\r\n\r\nThus we have given to man a pedigree of prodigious length, but not, it\r\nmay be said, of noble quality. The world, it has often been remarked,\r\nappears as if it had long been preparing for the advent of man: and\r\nthis, in one sense is strictly true, for he owes his birth to a long\r\nline of progenitors. If any single link in this chain had never\r\nexisted, man would not have been exactly what he now is. Unless we\r\nwilfully close our eyes, we may, with our present knowledge,\r\napproximately recognise our parentage; nor need we feel ashamed of it.\r\nThe most humble organism is something much higher than the inorganic\r\ndust under our feet; and no one with an unbiassed mind can study any\r\nliving creature, however humble, without being struck with enthusiasm\r\nat its marvellous structure and properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nON THE RACES OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature and value of specific characters—Application to the races of\r\nman—Arguments in favour of, and opposed to, ranking the so-called races\r\nof man as distinct species—Sub-species—Monogenists and\r\npolygenists—Convergence of character—Numerous points of resemblance in\r\nbody and mind between the most distinct races of man—The state of man\r\nwhen he first spread over the earth—Each race not descended from a\r\nsingle pair—The extinction of races—The formation of races—The effects\r\nof crossing—Slight influence of the direct action of the conditions of\r\nlife—Slight or no influence of natural selection—Sexual selection.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention here to describe the several so-called races of\r\nmen; but I am about to enquire what is the value of the differences\r\nbetween them under a classificatory point of view, and how they have\r\noriginated. In determining whether two or more allied forms ought to be\r\nranked as species or varieties, naturalists are practically guided by\r\nthe following considerations; namely, the amount of difference between\r\nthem, and whether such differences relate to few or many points of\r\nstructure, and whether they are of physiological importance; but more\r\nespecially whether they are constant. Constancy of character is what is\r\nchiefly valued and sought for by naturalists. Whenever it can be shewn,\r\nor rendered probable, that the forms in question have remained distinct\r\nfor a long period, this becomes an argument of much weight in favour of\r\ntreating them as species. Even a slight degree of sterility between any\r\ntwo forms when first crossed, or in their offspring, is generally\r\nconsidered as a decisive test of their specific distinctness; and their\r\ncontinued persistence without blending within the same area, is usually\r\naccepted as sufficient evidence, either of some degree of mutual\r\nsterility, or in the case of animals of some mutual repugnance to\r\npairing.\r\n\r\nIndependently of fusion from intercrossing, the complete absence, in a\r\nwell-investigated region, of varieties linking together any two\r\nclosely-allied forms, is probably the most important of all the\r\ncriterions of their specific distinctness; and this is a somewhat\r\ndifferent consideration from mere constancy of character, for two forms\r\nmay be highly variable and yet not yield intermediate varieties.\r\nGeographical distribution is often brought into play unconsciously and\r\nsometimes consciously; so that forms living in two widely separated\r\nareas, in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically\r\ndistinct, are themselves usually looked at as distinct; but in truth\r\nthis affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from so-called\r\ngood or true species.\r\n\r\nNow let us apply these generally-admitted principles to the races of\r\nman, viewing him in the same spirit as a naturalist would any other\r\nanimal. In regard to the amount of difference between the races, we\r\nmust make some allowance for our nice powers of discrimination gained\r\nby the long habit of observing ourselves. In India, as Elphinstone\r\nremarks, although a newly-arrived European cannot at first distinguish\r\nthe various native races, yet they soon appear to him extremely\r\ndissimilar (1. ‘History of India,’ 1841, vol. i. p. 323. Father Ripa\r\nmakes exactly the same remark with respect to the Chinese.); and the\r\nHindoo cannot at first perceive any difference between the several\r\nEuropean nations. Even the most distinct races of man are much more\r\nlike each other in form than would at first be supposed; certain negro\r\ntribes must be excepted, whilst others, as Dr. Rohlfs writes to me, and\r\nas I have myself seen, have Caucasian features. This general similarity\r\nis well shewn by the French photographs in the Collection\r\nAnthropologique du Museum de Paris of the men belonging to various\r\nraces, the greater number of which might pass for Europeans, as many\r\npersons to whom I have shewn them have remarked. Nevertheless, these\r\nmen, if seen alive, would undoubtedly appear very distinct, so that we\r\nare clearly much influenced in our judgment by the mere colour of the\r\nskin and hair, by slight differences in the features, and by\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no doubt that the various races, when carefully\r\ncompared and measured, differ much from each other,—as in the texture\r\nof the hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body (2. A\r\nvast number of measurements of Whites, Blacks, and Indians, are given\r\nin the ‘Investigations in the Military and Anthropolog. Statistics of\r\nAmerican Soldiers,’ by B.A. Gould, 1869, pp. 298-358; ‘On the capacity\r\nof the lungs,’ p. 471. See also the numerous and valuable tables, by\r\nDr. Weisbach, from the observations of Dr. Scherzer and Dr. Schwarz, in\r\nthe ‘Reise der Novara: Anthropolog. Theil,’ 1867.), the capacity of the\r\nlungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even in the convolutions\r\nof the brain. (3. See, for instance, Mr. Marshall’s account of the\r\nbrain of a Bushwoman, in ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1864, p. 519.)\r\nBut it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of\r\ndifference. The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation\r\nand in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are\r\nlikewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional,\r\nbut partly in their intellectual faculties. Every one who has had the\r\nopportunity of comparison, must have been struck with the contrast\r\nbetween the taciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and the\r\nlight-hearted, talkative negroes. There is a nearly similar contrast\r\nbetween the Malays and the Papuans (4. Wallace, ‘The Malay\r\nArchipelago,’ vol. ii. 1869, p. 178.), who live under the same physical\r\nconditions, and are separated from each other only by a narrow space of\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider the arguments which may be advanced in favour of\r\nclassing the races of man as distinct species, and then the arguments\r\non the other side. If a naturalist, who had never before seen a Negro,\r\nHottentot, Australian, or Mongolian, were to compare them, he would at\r\nonce perceive that they differed in a multitude of characters, some of\r\nslight and some of considerable importance. On enquiry he would find\r\nthat they were adapted to live under widely different climates, and\r\nthat they differed somewhat in bodily constitution and mental\r\ndisposition. If he were then told that hundreds of similar specimens\r\ncould be brought from the same countries, he would assuredly declare\r\nthat they were as good species as many to which he had been in the\r\nhabit of affixing specific names. This conclusion would be greatly\r\nstrengthened as soon as he had ascertained that these forms had all\r\nretained the same character for many centuries; and that negroes,\r\napparently identical with existing negroes, had lived at least 4000\r\nyears ago. (5. With respect to the figures in the famous Egyptian caves\r\nof Abou-Simbel, M. Pouchet says (‘The Plurality of the Human Races,’\r\nEng. translat., 1864, p. 50), that he was far from finding recognisable\r\nrepresentations of the dozen or more nations which some authors believe\r\nthat they can recognise. Even some of the most strongly-marked races\r\ncannot be identified with that degree of unanimity which might have\r\nbeen expected from what has been written on the subject. Thus Messrs.\r\nNott and Gliddon (‘Types of Mankind,’ p. 148), state that Rameses II.,\r\nor the Great, has features superbly European; whereas Knox, another\r\nfirm believer in the specific distinctness of the races of man (‘Races\r\nof Man,’ 1850, p. 201), speaking of young Memnon (the same as Rameses\r\nII., as I am informed by Mr. Birch), insists in the strongest manner\r\nthat he is identical in character with the Jews of Antwerp. Again, when\r\nI looked at the statue of Amunoph III., I agreed with two officers of\r\nthe establishment, both competent judges, that he had a strongly-marked\r\nnegro type of features; but Messrs. Nott and Gliddon (ibid. p. 146,\r\nfig. 53), describe him as a hybrid, but not of “negro intermixture.”)\r\nHe would also hear, on the authority of an excellent observer, Dr. Lund\r\n(6. As quoted by Nott and Gliddon, ‘Types of Mankind,’ 1854, p. 439.\r\nThey give also corroborative evidence; but C. Vogt thinks that the\r\nsubject requires further investigation.), that the human skulls found\r\nin the caves of Brazil, entombed with many extinct mammals, belonged to\r\nthe same type as that now prevailing throughout the American Continent.\r\n\r\nOur naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution,\r\nand he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct\r\nspecies, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot,\r\nas well as damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions. He might\r\nappeal to the fact that no species in the group next to man—namely, the\r\nQuadrumana, can resist a low temperature, or any considerable change of\r\nclimate; and that the species which come nearest to man have never been\r\nreared to maturity, even under the temperate climate of Europe. He\r\nwould be deeply impressed with the fact, first noticed by Agassiz (7.\r\n‘Diversity of Origin of the Human Races,’ in the ‘Christian Examiner,’\r\nJuly 1850.), that the different races of man are distributed over the\r\nworld in the same zoological provinces, as those inhabited by\r\nundoubtedly distinct species and genera of mammals. This is manifestly\r\nthe case with the Australian, Mongolian, and Negro races of man; in a\r\nless well-marked manner with the Hottentots; but plainly with the\r\nPapuans and Malays, who are separated, as Mr. Wallace has shewn, by\r\nnearly the same line which divides the great Malayan and Australian\r\nzoological provinces. The Aborigines of America range throughout the\r\nContinent; and this at first appears opposed to the above rule, for\r\nmost of the productions of the Southern and Northern halves differ\r\nwidely: yet some few living forms, as the opossum, range from the one\r\ninto the other, as did formerly some of the gigantic Edentata. The\r\nEsquimaux, like other Arctic animals, extend round the whole polar\r\nregions. It should be observed that the amount of difference between\r\nthe mammals of the several zoological provinces does not correspond\r\nwith the degree of separation between the latter; so that it can hardly\r\nbe considered as an anomaly that the Negro differs more, and the\r\nAmerican much less from the other races of man, than do the mammals of\r\nthe African and American continents from the mammals of the other\r\nprovinces. Man, it may be added, does not appear to have aboriginally\r\ninhabited any oceanic island; and in this respect, he resembles the\r\nother members of his class.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of\r\ndomestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct,\r\nthat is, whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species,\r\nevery naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external\r\nparasites being specifically distinct. All the more stress would be\r\nlaid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for I am informed\r\nby Mr. Denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons,\r\nin England, are infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice. Now\r\nMr. A. Murray has carefully examined the Pediculi collected in\r\ndifferent countries from the different races of man (8. ‘Transactions\r\nof the Royal Society of Edinburgh,’ vol. xxii, 1861, p. 567.); and he\r\nfinds that they differ, not only in colour, but in the structure of\r\ntheir claws and limbs. In every case in which many specimens were\r\nobtained the differences were constant. The surgeon of a whaling ship\r\nin the Pacific assured me that when the Pediculi, with which some\r\nSandwich Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the\r\nEnglish sailors, they died in the course of three or four days. These\r\nPediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper\r\nto the natives of Chiloe in South America, of which he gave me\r\nspecimens. These, again, appeared larger and much softer than European\r\nlice. Mr. Murray procured four kinds from Africa, namely, from the\r\nNegroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and\r\nKaffirs; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two from North and\r\ntwo from South America. In these latter cases it may be presumed that\r\nthe Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts. With\r\ninsects slight structural differences, if constant, are generally\r\nesteemed of specific value: and the fact of the races of man being\r\ninfested by parasites, which appear to be specifically distinct, might\r\nfairly be urged as an argument that the races themselves ought to be\r\nclassed as distinct species.\r\n\r\nOur supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far in his investigation,\r\nwould next enquire whether the races of men, when crossed, were in any\r\ndegree sterile. He might consult the work (9. ‘On the Phenomena of\r\nHybridity in the Genus Homo,’ Eng. translat., 1864.) of Professor\r\nBroca, a cautious and philosophical observer, and in this he would find\r\ngood evidence that some races were quite fertile together, but evidence\r\nof an opposite nature in regard to other races. Thus it has been\r\nasserted that the native women of Australia and Tasmania rarely produce\r\nchildren to European men; the evidence, however, on this head has now\r\nbeen shewn to be almost valueless. The half-castes are killed by the\r\npure blacks: and an account has lately been published of eleven\r\nhalf-caste youths murdered and burnt at the same time, whose remains\r\nwere found by the police. (10. See the interesting letter by Mr. T.A.\r\nMurray, in the ‘Anthropological Review,’ April 1868, p. liii. In this\r\nletter Count Strzelecki’s statement that Australian women who have\r\nborne children to a white man, are afterwards sterile with their own\r\nrace, is disproved. M. A. de Quatrefages has also collected (Revue des\r\nCours Scientifiques, March, 1869, p. 239), much evidence that\r\nAustralians and Europeans are not sterile when crossed.) Again, it has\r\noften been said that when mulattoes intermarry, they produce few\r\nchildren; on the other hand, Dr. Bachman, of Charleston (11. ‘An\r\nExamination of Prof. Agassiz’s Sketch of the Nat. Provinces of the\r\nAnimal World,’ Charleston, 1855, p. 44.), positively asserts that he\r\nhas known mulatto families which have intermarried for several\r\ngenerations, and have continued on an average as fertile as either pure\r\nwhites or pure blacks. Enquiries formerly made by Sir C. Lyell on this\r\nsubject led him, as he informs me, to the same conclusion. (12. Dr.\r\nRohlfs writes to me that he found the mixed races in the Great Sahara,\r\nderived from Arabs, Berbers, and Negroes of three tribes,\r\nextraordinarily fertile. On the other hand, Mr. Winwood Reade informs\r\nme that the Negroes on the Gold Coast, though admiring white men and\r\nmulattoes, have a maxim that mulattoes should not intermarry, as the\r\nchildren are few and sickly. This belief, as Mr. Reade remarks,\r\ndeserves attention, as white men have visited and resided on the Gold\r\nCoast for four hundred years, so that the natives have had ample time\r\nto gain knowledge through experience.) In the United States the census\r\nfor the year 1854 included, according to Dr. Bachman, 405,751\r\nmulattoes; and this number, considering all the circumstances of the\r\ncase, seems small; but it may partly be accounted for by the degraded\r\nand anomalous position of the class, and by the profligacy of the\r\nwomen. A certain amount of absorption of mulattoes into negroes must\r\nalways be in progress; and this would lead to an apparent diminution of\r\nthe former. The inferior vitality of mulattoes is spoken of in a\r\ntrustworthy work (13. ‘Military and Anthropological Statistics of\r\nAmerican Soldiers,’ by B.A. Gould, 1869, p. 319.) as a well-known\r\nphenomenon; and this, although a different consideration from their\r\nlessened fertility, may perhaps be advanced as a proof of the specific\r\ndistinctness of the parent races. No doubt both animal and vegetable\r\nhybrids, when produced from extremely distinct species, are liable to\r\npremature death; but the parents of mulattoes cannot be put under the\r\ncategory of extremely distinct species. The common Mule, so notorious\r\nfor long life and vigour, and yet so sterile, shews how little\r\nnecessary connection there is in hybrids between lessened fertility and\r\nvitality; other analogous cases could be cited.\r\n\r\nEven if it should hereafter be proved that all the races of men were\r\nperfectly fertile together, he who was inclined from other reasons to\r\nrank them as distinct species, might with justice argue that fertility\r\nand sterility are not safe criterions of specific distinctness. We know\r\nthat these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life,\r\nor by close inter-breeding, and that they are governed by highly\r\ncomplex laws, for instance, that of the unequal fertility of converse\r\ncrosses between the same two species. With forms which must be ranked\r\nas undoubted species, a perfect series exists from those which are\r\nabsolutely sterile when crossed, to those which are almost or\r\ncompletely fertile. The degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly\r\nwith the degrees of difference between the parents in external\r\nstructure or habits of life. Man in many respects may be compared with\r\nthose animals which have long been domesticated, and a large body of\r\nevidence can be advanced in favour of the Pallasian doctrine (14. The\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. p. 109.\r\nI may here remind the reader that the sterility of species when crossed\r\nis not a specially-acquired quality, but, like the incapacity of\r\ncertain trees to be grafted together, is incidental on other acquired\r\ndifferences. The nature of these differences is unknown, but they\r\nrelate more especially to the reproductive system, and much less so to\r\nexternal structure or to ordinary differences in constitution. One\r\nimportant element in the sterility of crossed species apparently lies\r\nin one or both having been long habituated to fixed conditions; for we\r\nknow that changed conditions have a special influence on the\r\nreproductive system, and we have good reason to believe (as before\r\nremarked) that the fluctuating conditions of domestication tend to\r\neliminate that sterility which is so general with species, in a natural\r\nstate, when crossed. It has elsewhere been shewn by me (ibid. vol. ii.\r\np. 185, and ‘Origin of Species,’ 5th edit. p. 317), that the sterility\r\nof crossed species has not been acquired through natural selection: we\r\ncan see that when two forms have already been rendered very sterile, it\r\nis scarcely possible that their sterility should be augmented by the\r\npreservation or survival of the more and more sterile individuals; for,\r\nas the sterility increases, fewer and fewer offspring will be produced\r\nfrom which to breed, and at last only single individuals will be\r\nproduced at the rarest intervals. But there is even a higher grade of\r\nsterility than this. Both Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in\r\ngenera of plants, including many species, a series can be formed from\r\nspecies which, when crossed, yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species\r\nwhich never produce a single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen\r\nof the other species, as shewn by the swelling of the germen. It is\r\nhere manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals,\r\nwhich have already ceased to yield seeds; so that the acme of\r\nsterility, when the germen alone is affected, cannot have been gained\r\nthrough selection. This acme, and no doubt the other grades of\r\nsterility, are the incidental results of certain unknown differences in\r\nthe constitution of the reproductive system of the species which are\r\ncrossed.), that domestication tends to eliminate the sterility which is\r\nso general a result of the crossing of species in a state of nature.\r\nFrom these several considerations, it may be justly urged that the\r\nperfect fertility of the intercrossed races of man, if established,\r\nwould not absolutely preclude us from ranking them as distinct species.\r\n\r\nIndependently of fertility, the characters presented by the offspring\r\nfrom a cross have been thought to indicate whether or not the\r\nparent-forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties; but after\r\ncarefully studying the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that no\r\ngeneral rules of this kind can be trusted. The ordinary result of a\r\ncross is the production of a blended or intermediate form; but in\r\ncertain cases some of the offspring take closely after one parent-form,\r\nand some after the other. This is especially apt to occur when the\r\nparents differ in characters which first appeared as sudden variations\r\nor monstrosities. (15. ‘The Variation of Animals,’ etc., vol. ii. p.\r\n92.) I refer to this point, because Dr. Rohlfs informs me that he has\r\nfrequently seen in Africa the offspring of negroes crossed with members\r\nof other races, either completely black or completely white, or rarely\r\npiebald. On the other hand, it is notorious that in America mulattoes\r\ncommonly present an intermediate appearance.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that a naturalist might feel himself fully justified\r\nin ranking the races of man as distinct species; for he has found that\r\nthey are distinguished by many differences in structure and\r\nconstitution, some being of importance. These differences have, also,\r\nremained nearly constant for very long periods of time. Our naturalist\r\nwill have been in some degree influenced by the enormous range of man,\r\nwhich is a great anomaly in the class of mammals, if mankind be viewed\r\nas a single species. He will have been struck with the distribution of\r\nthe several so-called races, which accords with that of other\r\nundoubtedly distinct species of mammals. Finally, he might urge that\r\nthe mutual fertility of all the races has not as yet been fully proved,\r\nand even if proved would not be an absolute proof of their specific\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the question, if our supposed naturalist were to\r\nenquire whether the forms of man keep distinct like ordinary species,\r\nwhen mingled together in large numbers in the same country, he would\r\nimmediately discover that this was by no means the case. In Brazil he\r\nwould behold an immense mongrel population of Negroes and Portuguese;\r\nin Chiloe, and other parts of South America, he would behold the whole\r\npopulation consisting of Indians and Spaniards blended in various\r\ndegrees. (16. M. de Quatrefages has given (‘Anthropological Review,’\r\nJan. 1869, p. 22), an interesting account of the success and energy of\r\nthe Paulistas in Brazil, who are a much crossed race of Portuguese and\r\nIndians, with a mixture of the blood of other races.) In many parts of\r\nthe same continent he would meet with the most complex crosses between\r\nNegroes, Indians, and Europeans; and judging from the vegetable\r\nkingdom, such triple crosses afford the severest test of the mutual\r\nfertility of the parent forms. In one island of the Pacific he would\r\nfind a small population of mingled Polynesian and English blood; and in\r\nthe Fiji Archipelago a population of Polynesian and Negritos crossed in\r\nall degrees. Many analogous cases could be added; for instance, in\r\nAfrica. Hence the races of man are not sufficiently distinct to inhabit\r\nthe same country without fusion; and the absence of fusion affords the\r\nusual and best test of specific distinctness.\r\n\r\nOur naturalist would likewise be much disturbed as soon as he perceived\r\nthat the distinctive characters of all the races were highly variable.\r\nThis fact strikes every one on first beholding the negro slaves in\r\nBrazil, who have been imported from all parts of Africa. The same\r\nremark holds good with the Polynesians, and with many other races. It\r\nmay be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive\r\nof a race and is constant. Savages, even within the limits of the same\r\ntribe, are not nearly so uniform in character, as has been often\r\nasserted. Hottentot women offer certain peculiarities, more strongly\r\nmarked than those occurring in any other race, but these are known not\r\nto be of constant occurrence. In the several American tribes, colour\r\nand hairiness differ considerably; as does colour to a certain degree,\r\nand the shape of the features greatly, in the Negroes of Africa. The\r\nshape of the skull varies much in some races (17. For instance, with\r\nthe aborigines of America and Australia, Prof. Huxley says (‘Transact.\r\nInternat. Congress of Prehist. Arch.’ 1868, p. 105), that the skulls of\r\nmany South Germans and Swiss are “as short and as broad as those of the\r\nTartars,” etc.); and so it is with every other character. Now all\r\nnaturalists have learnt by dearly bought experience, how rash it is to\r\nattempt to define species by the aid of inconstant characters.\r\n\r\nBut the most weighty of all the arguments against treating the races of\r\nman as distinct species, is that they graduate into each other,\r\nindependently in many cases, as far as we can judge, of their having\r\nintercrossed. Man has been studied more carefully than any other\r\nanimal, and yet there is the greatest possible diversity amongst\r\ncapable judges whether he should be classed as a single species or\r\nrace, or as two (Virey), as three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five\r\n(Blumenbach), six (Buffon), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven\r\n(Pickering), fifteen (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Desmoulins),\r\ntwenty-two (Morton), sixty (Crawfurd), or as sixty-three, according to\r\nBurke. (18. See a good discussion on this subject in Waitz,\r\n‘Introduction to Anthropology,’ Eng. translat., 1863, pp. 198-208, 227.\r\nI have taken some of the above statements from H. Tuttle’s ‘Origin and\r\nAntiquity of Physical Man,’ Boston, 1866, p. 35.) This diversity of\r\njudgment does not prove that the races ought not to be ranked as\r\nspecies, but it shews that they graduate into each other, and that it\r\nis hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEvery naturalist who has had the misfortune to undertake the\r\ndescription of a group of highly varying organisms, has encountered\r\ncases (I speak after experience) precisely like that of man; and if of\r\na cautious disposition, he will end by uniting all the forms which\r\ngraduate into each other, under a single species; for he will say to\r\nhimself that he has no right to give names to objects which he cannot\r\ndefine. Cases of this kind occur in the Order which includes man,\r\nnamely in certain genera of monkeys; whilst in other genera, as in\r\nCercopithecus, most of the species can be determined with certainty. In\r\nthe American genus Cebus, the various forms are ranked by some\r\nnaturalists as species, by others as mere geographical races. Now if\r\nnumerous specimens of Cebus were collected from all parts of South\r\nAmerica, and those forms which at present appear to be specifically\r\ndistinct, were found to graduate into each other by close steps, they\r\nwould usually be ranked as mere varieties or races; and this course has\r\nbeen followed by most naturalists with respect to the races of man.\r\nNevertheless, it must be confessed that there are forms, at least in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom (19. Prof. Nageli has carefully described several\r\nstriking cases in his ‘Botanische Mittheilungen,’ B. ii. 1866, ss.\r\n294-369. Prof. Asa Gray has made analogous remarks on some intermediate\r\nforms in the Compositae of N. America.), which we cannot avoid naming\r\nas species, but which are connected together by numberless gradations,\r\nindependently of intercrossing.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have lately employed the term “sub-species” to\r\ndesignate forms which possess many of the characteristics of true\r\nspecies, but which hardly deserve so high a rank. Now if we reflect on\r\nthe weighty arguments above given, for raising the races of man to the\r\ndignity of species, and the insuperable difficulties on the other side\r\nin defining them, it seems that the term “sub-species” might here be\r\nused with propriety. But from long habit the term “race” will perhaps\r\nalways be employed. The choice of terms is only so far important in\r\nthat it is desirable to use, as far as possible, the same terms for the\r\nsame degrees of difference. Unfortunately this can rarely be done: for\r\nthe larger genera generally include closely-allied forms, which can be\r\ndistinguished only with much difficulty, whilst the smaller genera\r\nwithin the same family include forms that are perfectly distinct; yet\r\nall must be ranked equally as species. So again, species within the\r\nsame large genus by no means resemble each other to the same degree: on\r\nthe contrary, some of them can generally be arranged in little groups\r\nround other species, like satellites round planets. (20. ‘Origin of\r\nSpecies,’ 5th edit. p. 68.)\r\n\r\nThe question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of\r\nlate years been much discussed by anthropologists, who are divided into\r\nthe two schools of monogenists and polygenists. Those who do not admit\r\nthe principle of evolution, must look at species as separate creations,\r\nor in some manner as distinct entities; and they must decide what forms\r\nof man they will consider as species by the analogy of the method\r\ncommonly pursued in ranking other organic beings as species. But it is\r\na hopeless endeavour to decide this point, until some definition of the\r\nterm “species” is generally accepted; and the definition must not\r\ninclude an indeterminate element such as an act of creation. We might\r\nas well attempt without any definition to decide whether a certain\r\nnumber of houses should be called a village, town, or city. We have a\r\npractical illustration of the difficulty in the never-ending doubts\r\nwhether many closely-allied mammals, birds, insects, and plants, which\r\nrepresent each other respectively in North America and Europe, should\r\nbe ranked as species or geographical races; and the like holds true of\r\nthe productions of many islands situated at some little distance from\r\nthe nearest continent.\r\n\r\nThose naturalists, on the other hand, who admit the principle of\r\nevolution, and this is now admitted by the majority of rising men, will\r\nfeel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single\r\nprimitive stock; whether or not they may think fit to designate the\r\nraces as distinct species, for the sake of expressing their amount of\r\ndifference. (21. See Prof. Huxley to this effect in the ‘Fortnightly\r\nReview,’ 1865, p. 275.) With our domestic animals the question whether\r\nthe various races have arisen from one or more species is somewhat\r\ndifferent. Although it may be admitted that all the races, as well as\r\nall the natural species within the same genus, have sprung from the\r\nsame primitive stock, yet it is a fit subject for discussion, whether\r\nall the domestic races of the dog, for instance, have acquired their\r\npresent amount of difference since some one species was first\r\ndomesticated by man; or whether they owe some of their characters to\r\ninheritance from distinct species, which had already been\r\ndifferentiated in a state of nature. With man no such question can\r\narise, for he cannot be said to have been domesticated at any\r\nparticular period.\r\n\r\nDuring an early stage in the divergence of the races of man from a\r\ncommon stock, the differences between the races and their number must\r\nhave been small; consequently as far as their distinguishing characters\r\nare concerned, they then had less claim to rank as distinct species\r\nthan the existing so-called races. Nevertheless, so arbitrary is the\r\nterm of species, that such early races would perhaps have been ranked\r\nby some naturalists as distinct species, if their differences, although\r\nextremely slight, had been more constant than they are at present, and\r\nhad not graduated into each other.\r\n\r\nIt is however possible, though far from probable, that the early\r\nprogenitors of man might formerly have diverged much in character,\r\nuntil they became more unlike each other than any now existing races;\r\nbut that subsequently, as suggested by Vogt (22. ‘Lectures on Man,’\r\nEng. translat., 1864, p. 468.), they converged in character. When man\r\nselects the offspring of two distinct species for the same object, he\r\nsometimes induces a considerable amount of convergence, as far as\r\ngeneral appearance is concerned. This is the case, as shewn by von\r\nNathusius (23. ‘Die Rassen des Schweines,’ 1860, s. 46. ‘Vorstudien für\r\nGeschichte,’ etc., Schweinesschädel, 1864, s. 104. With respect to\r\ncattle, see M. de Quatrefages, ‘Unité de l’Espèce Humaine,’ 1861, p.\r\n119.), with the improved breeds of the pig, which are descended from\r\ntwo distinct species; and in a less marked manner with the improved\r\nbreeds of cattle. A great anatomist, Gratiolet, maintains that the\r\nanthropomorphous apes do not form a natural sub-group; but that the\r\norang is a highly developed gibbon or semnopithecus, the chimpanzee a\r\nhighly developed macacus, and the gorilla a highly developed mandrill.\r\nIf this conclusion, which rests almost exclusively on brain-characters,\r\nbe admitted, we should have a case of convergence at least in external\r\ncharacters, for the anthropomorphous apes are certainly more like each\r\nother in many points, than they are to other apes. All analogical\r\nresemblances, as of a whale to a fish, may indeed be said to be cases\r\nof convergence; but this term has never been applied to superficial and\r\nadaptive resemblances. It would, however, be extremely rash to\r\nattribute to convergence close similarity of character in many points\r\nof structure amongst the modified descendants of widely distinct\r\nbeings. The form of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular\r\nforces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should\r\nsometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should bear\r\nin mind that the form of each depends on an infinity of complex\r\nrelations, namely on variations, due to causes far too intricate to be\r\nfollowed,—on the nature of the variations preserved, these depending on\r\nthe physical conditions, and still more on the surrounding organisms\r\nwhich compete with each,—and lastly, on inheritance (in itself a\r\nfluctuating element) from innumerable progenitors, all of which have\r\nhad their forms determined through equally complex relations. It\r\nappears incredible that the modified descendants of two organisms, if\r\nthese differed from each other in a marked manner, should ever\r\nafterwards converge so closely as to lead to a near approach to\r\nidentity throughout their whole organisation. In the case of the\r\nconvergent races of pigs above referred to, evidence of their descent\r\nfrom two primitive stocks is, according to von Nathusius, still plainly\r\nretained, in certain bones of their skulls. If the races of man had\r\ndescended, as is supposed by some naturalists, from two or more\r\nspecies, which differed from each other as much, or nearly as much, as\r\ndoes the orang from the gorilla, it can hardly be doubted that marked\r\ndifferences in the structure of certain bones would still be\r\ndiscoverable in man as he now exists.\r\n\r\nAlthough the existing races of man differ in many respects, as in\r\ncolour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, etc., yet if\r\ntheir whole structure be taken into consideration they are found to\r\nresemble each other closely in a multitude of points. Many of these are\r\nof so unimportant or of so singular a nature, that it is extremely\r\nimprobable that they should have been independently acquired by\r\naboriginally distinct species or races. The same remark holds good with\r\nequal or greater force with respect to the numerous points of mental\r\nsimilarity between the most distinct races of man. The American\r\naborigines, Negroes and Europeans are as different from each other in\r\nmind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly\r\nstruck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the “Beagle,” with the\r\nmany little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were\r\nto ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened\r\nonce to be intimate.\r\n\r\nHe who will read Mr. Tylor’s and Sir J. Lubbock’s interesting works\r\n(24. Tylor’s ‘Early History of Mankind,’ 1865: with respect to\r\ngesture-language, see p. 54. Lubbock’s ‘Prehistoric Times,’ 2nd edit.\r\n1869.) can hardly fail to be deeply impressed with the close similarity\r\nbetween the men of all races in tastes, dispositions and habits. This\r\nis shewn by the pleasure which they all take in dancing, rude music,\r\nacting, painting, tattooing, and otherwise decorating themselves; in\r\ntheir mutual comprehension of gesture-language, by the same expression\r\nin their features, and by the same inarticulate cries, when excited by\r\nthe same emotions. This similarity, or rather identity, is striking,\r\nwhen contrasted with the different expressions and cries made by\r\ndistinct species of monkeys. There is good evidence that the art of\r\nshooting with bows and arrows has not been handed down from any common\r\nprogenitor of mankind, yet as Westropp and Nilsson have remarked (25.\r\n‘On Analogous Forms of Implements,’ in ‘Memoirs of Anthropological\r\nSociety’ by H.M. Westropp. ‘The Primitive Inhabitants of Scandinavia,’\r\nEng. translat., edited by Sir J. Lubbock, 1868, p. 104.), the stone\r\narrow-heads, brought from the most distant parts of the world, and\r\nmanufactured at the most remote periods, are almost identical; and this\r\nfact can only be accounted for by the various races having similar\r\ninventive or mental powers. The same observation has been made by\r\narchaeologists (26. Westropp ‘On Cromlechs,’ etc., ‘Journal of\r\nEthnological Soc.’ as given in ‘Scientific Opinion,’ June 2nd, 1869, p.\r\n3.) with respect to certain widely-prevalent ornaments, such as\r\nzig-zags, etc.; and with respect to various simple beliefs and customs,\r\nsuch as the burying of the dead under megalithic structures. I remember\r\nobserving in South America (27. ‘Journal of Researches: Voyage of the\r\n“Beagle,”’ p. 46.), that there, as in so many other parts of the world,\r\nmen have generally chosen the summits of lofty hills, to throw up piles\r\nof stones, either as a record of some remarkable event, or for burying\r\ntheir dead.\r\n\r\nNow when naturalists observe a close agreement in numerous small\r\ndetails of habits, tastes, and dispositions between two or more\r\ndomestic races, or between nearly-allied natural forms, they use this\r\nfact as an argument that they are descended from a common progenitor\r\nwho was thus endowed; and consequently that all should be classed under\r\nthe same species. The same argument may be applied with much force to\r\nthe races of man.\r\n\r\nAs it is improbable that the numerous and unimportant points of\r\nresemblance between the several races of man in bodily structure and\r\nmental faculties (I do not here refer to similar customs) should all\r\nhave been independently acquired, they must have been inherited from\r\nprogenitors who had these same characters. We thus gain some insight\r\ninto the early state of man, before he had spread step by step over the\r\nface of the earth. The spreading of man to regions widely separated by\r\nthe sea, no doubt, preceded any great amount of divergence of character\r\nin the several races; for otherwise we should sometimes meet with the\r\nsame race in distinct continents; and this is never the case. Sir J.\r\nLubbock, after comparing the arts now practised by savages in all parts\r\nof the world, specifies those which man could not have known, when he\r\nfirst wandered from his original birthplace; for if once learnt they\r\nwould never have been forgotten. (28. ‘Prehistoric Times,’ 1869, p.\r\n574.) He thus shews that “the spear, which is but a development of the\r\nknife-point, and the club, which is but a long hammer, are the only\r\nthings left.” He admits, however, that the art of making fire probably\r\nhad been already discovered, for it is common to all the races now\r\nexisting, and was known to the ancient cave-inhabitants of Europe.\r\nPerhaps the art of making rude canoes or rafts was likewise known; but\r\nas man existed at a remote epoch, when the land in many places stood at\r\na very different level to what it does now, he would have been able,\r\nwithout the aid of canoes, to have spread widely. Sir J. Lubbock\r\nfurther remarks how improbable it is that our earliest ancestors could\r\nhave “counted as high as ten, considering that so many races now in\r\nexistence cannot get beyond four.” Nevertheless, at this early period,\r\nthe intellectual and social faculties of man could hardly have been\r\ninferior in any extreme degree to those possessed at present by the\r\nlowest savages; otherwise primeval man could not have been so eminently\r\nsuccessful in the struggle for life, as proved by his early and wide\r\ndiffusion.\r\n\r\nFrom the fundamental differences between certain languages, some\r\nphilologists have inferred that when man first became widely diffused,\r\nhe was not a speaking animal; but it may be suspected that languages,\r\nfar less perfect than any now spoken, aided by gestures, might have\r\nbeen used, and yet have left no traces on subsequent and more\r\nhighly-developed tongues. Without the use of some language, however\r\nimperfect, it appears doubtful whether man’s intellect could have risen\r\nto the standard implied by his dominant position at an early period.\r\n\r\nWhether primeval man, when he possessed but few arts, and those of the\r\nrudest kind, and when his power of language was extremely imperfect,\r\nwould have deserved to be called man, must depend on the definition\r\nwhich we employ. In a series of forms graduating insensibly from some\r\nape-like creature to man as he now exists, it would be impossible to\r\nfix on any definite point where the term “man” ought to be used. But\r\nthis is a matter of very little importance. So again, it is almost a\r\nmatter of indifference whether the so-called races of man are thus\r\ndesignated, or are ranked as species or sub-species; but the latter\r\nterm appears the more appropriate. Finally, we may conclude that when\r\nthe principle of evolution is generally accepted, as it surely will be\r\nbefore long, the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists\r\nwill die a silent and unobserved death.\r\n\r\nOne other question ought not to be passed over without notice, namely,\r\nwhether, as is sometimes assumed, each sub-species or race of man has\r\nsprung from a single pair of progenitors. With our domestic animals a\r\nnew race can readily be formed by carefully matching the varying\r\noffspring from a single pair, or even from a single individual\r\npossessing some new character; but most of our races have been formed,\r\nnot intentionally from a selected pair, but unconsciously by the\r\npreservation of many individuals which have varied, however slightly,\r\nin some useful or desired manner. If in one country stronger and\r\nheavier horses, and in another country lighter and fleeter ones, were\r\nhabitually preferred, we may feel sure that two distinct sub-breeds\r\nwould be produced in the course of time, without any one pair having\r\nbeen separated and bred from, in either country. Many races have been\r\nthus formed, and their manner of formation is closely analogous to that\r\nof natural species. We know, also, that the horses taken to the\r\nFalkland Islands have, during successive generations, become smaller\r\nand weaker, whilst those which have run wild on the Pampas have\r\nacquired larger and coarser heads; and such changes are manifestly due,\r\nnot to any one pair, but to all the individuals having been subjected\r\nto the same conditions, aided, perhaps, by the principle of reversion.\r\nThe new sub-breeds in such cases are not descended from any single\r\npair, but from many individuals which have varied in different degrees,\r\nbut in the same general manner; and we may conclude that the races of\r\nman have been similarly produced, the modifications being either the\r\ndirect result of exposure to different conditions, or the indirect\r\nresult of some form of selection. But to this latter subject we shall\r\npresently return.\r\n\r\nON THE EXTINCTION OF THE RACES OF MAN.\r\n\r\nThe partial or complete extinction of many races and sub-races of man\r\nis historically known. Humboldt saw in South America a parrot which was\r\nthe sole living creature that could speak a word of the language of a\r\nlost tribe. Ancient monuments and stone implements found in all parts\r\nof the world, about which no tradition has been preserved by the\r\npresent inhabitants, indicate much extinction. Some small and broken\r\ntribes, remnants of former races, still survive in isolated and\r\ngenerally mountainous districts. In Europe the ancient races were all,\r\naccording to Shaaffhausen (29. Translation in ‘Anthropological Review,’\r\nOct. 1868, p. 431.), “lower in the scale than the rudest living\r\nsavages”; they must therefore have differed, to a certain extent, from\r\nany existing race. The remains described by Professor Broca from Les\r\nEyzies, though they unfortunately appear to have belonged to a single\r\nfamily, indicate a race with a most singular combination of low or\r\nsimious, and of high characteristics. This race is “entirely different\r\nfrom any other, ancient or modern, that we have heard of.” (30.\r\n‘Transactions, International Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology’ 1868,\r\npp. 172-175. See also Broca (tr.) in ‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct.\r\n1868, p. 410.) It differed, therefore, from the quaternary race of the\r\ncaverns of Belgium.\r\n\r\nMan can long resist conditions which appear extremely unfavourable for\r\nhis existence. (31. Dr. Gerland, ‘Ueber das Aussterben der\r\nNaturvölker,’ 1868, s. 82.) He has long lived in the extreme regions of\r\nthe North, with no wood for his canoes or implements, and with only\r\nblubber as fuel, and melted snow as drink. In the southern extremity of\r\nAmerica the Fuegians survive without the protection of clothes, or of\r\nany building worthy to be called a hovel. In South Africa the\r\naborigines wander over arid plains, where dangerous beasts abound. Man\r\ncan withstand the deadly influence of the Terai at the foot of the\r\nHimalaya, and the pestilential shores of tropical Africa.\r\n\r\nExtinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe,\r\nand race with race. Various checks are always in action, serving to\r\nkeep down the numbers of each savage tribe,—such as periodical famines,\r\nnomadic habits and the consequent deaths of infants, prolonged\r\nsuckling, wars, accidents, sickness, licentiousness, the stealing of\r\nwomen, infanticide, and especially lessened fertility. If any one of\r\nthese checks increases in power, even slightly, the tribe thus affected\r\ntends to decrease; and when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less\r\nnumerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled\r\nby war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption. Even when a\r\nweaker tribe is not thus abruptly swept away, if it once begins to\r\ndecrease, it generally goes on decreasing until it becomes extinct.\r\n(32. Gerland (ibid. s. 12) gives facts in support of this statement.)\r\n\r\nWhen civilised nations come into contact with barbarians the struggle\r\nis short, except where a deadly climate gives its aid to the native\r\nrace. Of the causes which lead to the victory of civilised nations,\r\nsome are plain and simple, others complex and obscure. We can see that\r\nthe cultivation of the land will be fatal in many ways to savages, for\r\nthey cannot, or will not, change their habits. New diseases and vices\r\nhave in some cases proved highly destructive; and it appears that a new\r\ndisease often causes much death, until those who are most susceptible\r\nto its destructive influence are gradually weeded out (33. See remarks\r\nto this effect in Sir H. Holland’s ‘Medical Notes and Reflections,’\r\n1839, p. 390.); and so it may be with the evil effects from spirituous\r\nliquors, as well as with the unconquerably strong taste for them shewn\r\nby so many savages. It further appears, mysterious as is the fact, that\r\nthe first meeting of distinct and separated people generates disease.\r\n(34. I have collected (‘Journal of Researches: Voyage of the “Beagle,”’\r\np. 435) a good many cases bearing on this subject; see also Gerland,\r\nibid. s. 8. Poeppig speaks of the “breath of civilisation as poisonous\r\nto savages.”) Mr. Sproat, who in Vancouver Island closely attended to\r\nthe subject of extinction, believed that changed habits of life,\r\nconsequent on the advent of Europeans, induces much ill health. He\r\nlays, also, great stress on the apparently trifling cause that the\r\nnatives become “bewildered and dull by the new life around them; they\r\nlose the motives for exertion, and get no new ones in their place.”\r\n(35. Sproat, ‘Scenes and Studies of Savage Life,’ 1868, p. 284.)\r\n\r\nThe grade of their civilisation seems to be a most important element in\r\nthe success of competing nations. A few centuries ago Europe feared the\r\ninroads of Eastern barbarians; now any such fear would be ridiculous.\r\nIt is a more curious fact, as Mr. Bagehot has remarked, that savages\r\ndid not formerly waste away before the classical nations, as they now\r\ndo before modern civilised nations; had they done so, the old moralists\r\nwould have mused over the event; but there is no lament in any writer\r\nof that period over the perishing barbarians. (36. Bagehot, ‘Physics\r\nand Politics,’ ‘Fortnightly Review,’ April 1, 1868, p. 455.) The most\r\npotent of all the causes of extinction, appears in many cases to be\r\nlessened fertility and ill-health, especially amongst the children,\r\narising from changed conditions of life, notwithstanding that the new\r\nconditions may not be injurious in themselves. I am much indebted to\r\nMr. H.H. Howorth for having called my attention to this subject, and\r\nfor having given me information respecting it. I have collected the\r\nfollowing cases.\r\n\r\nWhen Tasmania was first colonised the natives were roughly estimated by\r\nsome at 7000 and by others at 20,000. Their number was soon greatly\r\nreduced, chiefly by fighting with the English and with each other.\r\nAfter the famous hunt by all the colonists, when the remaining natives\r\ndelivered themselves up to the government, they consisted only of 120\r\nindividuals (37. All the statements here given are taken from ‘The Last\r\nof the Tasmanians,’ by J. Bonwick, 1870.), who were in 1832 transported\r\nto Flinders Island. This island, situated between Tasmania and\r\nAustralia, is forty miles long, and from twelve to eighteen miles\r\nbroad: it seems healthy, and the natives were well treated.\r\nNevertheless, they suffered greatly in health. In 1834 they consisted\r\n(Bonwick, p. 250) of forty-seven adult males, forty-eight adult\r\nfemales, and sixteen children, or in all of 111 souls. In 1835 only one\r\nhundred were left. As they continued rapidly to decrease, and as they\r\nthemselves thought that they should not perish so quickly elsewhere,\r\nthey were removed in 1847 to Oyster Cove in the southern part of\r\nTasmania. They then consisted (Dec. 20th, 1847) of fourteen men,\r\ntwenty-two women and ten children. (38. This is the statement of the\r\nGovernor of Tasmania, Sir W. Denison, ‘Varieties of Vice-Regal Life,’\r\n1870, vol. i. p. 67.) But the change of site did no good. Disease and\r\ndeath still pursued them, and in 1864 one man (who died in 1869), and\r\nthree elderly women alone survived. The infertility of the women is\r\neven a more remarkable fact than the liability of all to ill-health and\r\ndeath. At the time when only nine women were left at Oyster Cove, they\r\ntold Mr. Bonwick (p. 386), that only two had ever borne children: and\r\nthese two had together produced only three children!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the cause of this extraordinary state of things, Dr.\r\nStory remarks that death followed the attempts to civilise the natives.\r\n“If left to themselves to roam as they were wont and undisturbed, they\r\nwould have reared more children, and there would have been less\r\nmortality.” Another careful observer of the natives, Mr. Davis,\r\nremarks, “The births have been few and the deaths numerous. This may\r\nhave been in a great measure owing to their change of living and food;\r\nbut more so to their banishment from the mainland of Van Diemen’s Land,\r\nand consequent depression of spirits” (Bonwick, pp. 388, 390).\r\n\r\nSimilar facts have been observed in two widely different parts of\r\nAustralia. The celebrated explorer, Mr. Gregory, told Mr. Bonwick, that\r\nin Queensland “the want of reproduction was being already felt with the\r\nblacks, even in the most recently settled parts, and that decay would\r\nset in.” Of thirteen aborigines from Shark’s Bay who visited Murchison\r\nRiver, twelve died of consumption within three months. (39. For these\r\ncases, see Bonwick’s ‘Daily Life of the Tasmanians,’ 1870, p. 90: and\r\nthe ‘Last of the Tasmanians,’ 1870, p. 386.)\r\n\r\nThe decrease of the Maories of New Zealand has been carefully\r\ninvestigated by Mr. Fenton, in an admirable Report, from which all the\r\nfollowing statements, with one exception, are taken. (40. ‘Observations\r\non the Aboriginal Inhabitants of New Zealand,’ published by the\r\nGovernment, 1859.) The decrease in number since 1830 is admitted by\r\nevery one, including the natives themselves, and is still steadily\r\nprogressing. Although it has hitherto been found impossible to take an\r\nactual census of the natives, their numbers were carefully estimated by\r\nresidents in many districts. The result seems trustworthy, and shows\r\nthat during the fourteen years, previous to 1858, the decrease was\r\n19.42 per cent. Some of the tribes, thus carefully examined, lived\r\nabove a hundred miles apart, some on the coast, some inland; and their\r\nmeans of subsistence and habits differed to a certain extent (p. 28).\r\nThe total number in 1858 was believed to be 53,700, and in 1872, after\r\na second interval of fourteen years, another census was taken, and the\r\nnumber is given as only 36,359, shewing a decrease of 32.29 per cent!\r\n(41. ‘New Zealand,’ by Alex. Kennedy, 1873, p. 47.) Mr. Fenton, after\r\nshewing in detail the insufficiency of the various causes, usually\r\nassigned in explanation of this extraordinary decrease, such as new\r\ndiseases, the profligacy of the women, drunkenness, wars, etc.,\r\nconcludes on weighty grounds that it depends chiefly on the\r\nunproductiveness of the women, and on the extraordinary mortality of\r\nthe young children (pp. 31, 34). In proof of this he shews (p. 33) that\r\nin 1844 there was one non-adult for every 2.57 adults; whereas in 1858\r\nthere was only one non-adult for every 3.27 adults. The mortality of\r\nthe adults is also great. He adduces as a further cause of the decrease\r\nthe inequality of the sexes; for fewer females are born than males. To\r\nthis latter point, depending perhaps on a widely distinct cause, I\r\nshall return in a future chapter. Mr. Fenton contrasts with\r\nastonishment the decrease in New Zealand with the increase in Ireland;\r\ncountries not very dissimilar in climate, and where the inhabitants now\r\nfollow nearly similar habits. The Maories themselves (p. 35) “attribute\r\ntheir decadence, in some measure, to the introduction of new food and\r\nclothing, and the attendant change of habits”; and it will be seen,\r\nwhen we consider the influence of changed conditions on fertility, that\r\nthey are probably right. The diminution began between the years 1830\r\nand 1840; and Mr. Fenton shews (p. 40) that about 1830, the art of\r\nmanufacturing putrid corn (maize), by long steeping in water, was\r\ndiscovered and largely practised; and this proves that a change of\r\nhabits was beginning amongst the natives, even when New Zealand was\r\nonly thinly inhabited by Europeans. When I visited the Bay of Islands\r\nin 1835, the dress and food of the inhabitants had already been much\r\nmodified: they raised potatoes, maize, and other agricultural produce,\r\nand exchanged them for English manufactured goods and tobacco.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from many statements in the life of Bishop Patteson (42.\r\n‘Life of J.C. Patteson,’ by C.M. Younge, 1874; see more especially vol.\r\ni. p. 530.), that the Melanesians of the New Hebrides and neighbouring\r\narchipelagoes, suffered to an extraordinary degree in health, and\r\nperished in large numbers, when they were removed to New Zealand,\r\nNorfolk Island, and other salubrious places, in order to be educated as\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of the native population of the Sandwich Islands is as\r\nnotorious as that of New Zealand. It has been roughly estimated by those\r\nbest capable of judging, that when Cook discovered the Islands in 1779, the\r\npopulation amounted to about 300,000. According to a loose census in 1823,\r\nthe numbers then were 142,050. In 1832, and at several subsequent periods,\r\nan accurate census was officially taken, but I have been able to obtain\r\nonly the following returns:\r\n                Native Population          Annual rate of decrease\r\n                                           per cent., assuming it to\r\n              (Except during 1832 and      have been uniform between\r\n              1836, when the few           the successive censuses;\r\n              foreigners in the islands    these censuses being taken\r\n  Year        were included.)              at irregular intervals.\r\n\r\n  1832              130,313\r\n                                                   4.46\r\n  1836              108,579\r\n                                                   2.47\r\n  1853               71,019\r\n                                                   0.81\r\n  1860               67,084\r\n                                                   2.18\r\n  1866               58,765\r\n                                                   2.17\r\n  1872               51,531\r\n\r\nWe here see that in the interval of forty years, between 1832 and 1872,\r\nthe population has decreased no less than sixty-eight per cent.! This\r\nhas been attributed by most writers to the profligacy of the women, to\r\nformer bloody wars, and to the severe labour imposed on conquered\r\ntribes and to newly introduced diseases, which have been on several\r\noccasions extremely destructive. No doubt these and other such causes\r\nhave been highly efficient, and may account for the extraordinary rate\r\nof decrease between the years 1832 and 1836; but the most potent of all\r\nthe causes seems to be lessened fertility. According to Dr.\r\nRuschenberger of the U.S. Navy, who visited these islands between 1835\r\nand 1837, in one district of Hawaii, only twenty-five men out of 1134,\r\nand in another district only ten out of 637, had a family with as many\r\nas three children. Of eighty married women, only thirty-nine had ever\r\nborne children; and “the official report gives an average of half a\r\nchild to each married couple in the whole island.” This is almost\r\nexactly the same average as with the Tasmanians at Oyster Cove. Jarves,\r\nwho published his History in 1843, says that “families who have three\r\nchildren are freed from all taxes; those having more, are rewarded by\r\ngifts of land and other encouragements.” This unparalleled enactment by\r\nthe government well shews how infertile the race had become. The Rev.\r\nA. Bishop stated in the Hawaiian ‘Spectator’ in 1839, that a large\r\nproportion of the children die at early ages, and Bishop Staley informs\r\nme that this is still the case, just as in New Zealand. This has been\r\nattributed to the neglect of the children by the women, but it is\r\nprobably in large part due to innate weakness of constitution in the\r\nchildren, in relation to the lessened fertility of their parents. There\r\nis, moreover, a further resemblance to the case of New Zealand, in the\r\nfact that there is a large excess of male over female births: the\r\ncensus of 1872 gives 31,650 males to 25,247 females of all ages, that\r\nis 125.36 males for every 100 females; whereas in all civilised\r\ncountries the females exceed the males. No doubt the profligacy of the\r\nwomen may in part account for their small fertility; but their changed\r\nhabits of life is a much more probable cause, and which will at the\r\nsame time account for the increased mortality, especially of the\r\nchildren. The islands were visited by Cook in 1779, Vancouver in 1794,\r\nand often subsequently by whalers. In 1819 missionaries arrived, and\r\nfound that idolatry had been already abolished, and other changes\r\neffected by the king. After this period there was a rapid change in\r\nalmost all the habits of life of the natives, and they soon became “the\r\nmost civilised of the Pacific Islanders.” One of my informants, Mr.\r\nCoan, who was born on the islands, remarks that the natives have\r\nundergone a greater change in their habits of life in the course of\r\nfifty years than Englishmen during a thousand years. From information\r\nreceived from Bishop Staley, it does not appear that the poorer classes\r\nhave ever much changed their diet, although many new kinds of fruit\r\nhave been introduced, and the sugar-cane is in universal use. Owing,\r\nhowever, to their passion for imitating Europeans, they altered their\r\nmanner of dressing at an early period, and the use of alcoholic drinks\r\nbecame very general. Although these changes appear inconsiderable, I\r\ncan well believe, from what is known with respect to animals, that they\r\nmight suffice to lessen the fertility of the natives. (43. The\r\nforegoing statements are taken chiefly from the following works:\r\nJarves’ ‘History of the Hawaiian Islands,’ 1843, pp. 400-407. Cheever,\r\n‘Life in the Sandwich Islands,’ 1851, p. 277. Ruschenberger is quoted\r\nby Bonwick, ‘Last of the Tasmanians,’ 1870, p. 378. Bishop is quoted by\r\nSir E. Belcher, ‘Voyage Round the World,’ 1843, vol. i. p. 272. I owe\r\nthe census of the several years to the kindness of Mr. Coan, at the\r\nrequest of Dr. Youmans of New York; and in most cases I have compared\r\nthe Youmans figures with those given in several of the above-named\r\nworks. I have omitted the census for 1850, as I have seen two widely\r\ndifferent numbers given.)\r\n\r\nLastly, Mr. Macnamara states (44. ‘The Indian Medical Gazette,’ Nov. 1,\r\n1871, p. 240.) that the low and degraded inhabitants of the Andaman\r\nIslands, on the eastern side of the Gulf of Bengal, are “eminently\r\nsusceptible to any change of climate: in fact, take them away from\r\ntheir island homes, and they are almost certain to die, and that\r\nindependently of diet or extraneous influences.” He further states that\r\nthe inhabitants of the Valley of Nepal, which is extremely hot in\r\nsummer, and also the various hill-tribes of India, suffer from\r\ndysentery and fever when on the plains; and they die if they attempt to\r\npass the whole year there.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that many of the wilder races of man are apt to suffer much\r\nin health when subjected to changed conditions or habits of life, and\r\nnot exclusively from being transported to a new climate. Mere\r\nalterations in habits, which do not appear injurious in themselves,\r\nseem to have this same effect; and in several cases the children are\r\nparticularly liable to suffer. It has often been said, as Mr. Macnamara\r\nremarks, that man can resist with impunity the greatest diversities of\r\nclimate and other changes; but this is true only of the civilised\r\nraces. Man in his wild condition seems to be in this respect almost as\r\nsusceptible as his nearest allies, the anthropoid apes, which have\r\nnever yet survived long, when removed from their native country.\r\n\r\nLessened fertility from changed conditions, as in the case of the\r\nTasmanians, Maories, Sandwich Islanders, and apparently the\r\nAustralians, is still more interesting than their liability to\r\nill-health and death; for even a slight degree of infertility, combined\r\nwith those other causes which tend to check the increase of every\r\npopulation, would sooner or later lead to extinction. The diminution of\r\nfertility may be explained in some cases by the profligacy of the women\r\n(as until lately with the Tahitians), but Mr. Fenton has shewn that\r\nthis explanation by no means suffices with the New Zealanders, nor does\r\nit with the Tasmanians.\r\n\r\nIn the paper above quoted, Mr. Macnamara gives reasons for believing\r\nthat the inhabitants of districts subject to malaria are apt to be\r\nsterile; but this cannot apply in several of the above cases. Some\r\nwriters have suggested that the aborigines of islands have suffered in\r\nfertility and health from long continued inter-breeding; but in the\r\nabove cases infertility has coincided too closely with the arrival of\r\nEuropeans for us to admit this explanation. Nor have we at present any\r\nreason to believe that man is highly sensitive to the evil effects of\r\ninter-breeding, especially in areas so large as New Zealand, and the\r\nSandwich archipelago with its diversified stations. On the contrary, it\r\nis known that the present inhabitants of Norfolk Island are nearly all\r\ncousins or near relations, as are the Todas in India, and the\r\ninhabitants of some of the Western Islands of Scotland; and yet they\r\nseem not to have suffered in fertility. (45. On the close relationship\r\nof the Norfolk Islanders, Sir W. Denison, ‘Varieties of Vice-Regal\r\nLife,’ vol. i. 1870, p. 410. For the Todas, see Col. Marshall’s work\r\n1873, p. 110. For the Western Islands of Scotland, Dr. Mitchell,\r\n‘Edinburgh Medical Journal,’ March to June, 1865.)\r\n\r\nA much more probable view is suggested by the analogy of the lower\r\nanimals. The reproductive system can be shewn to be susceptible to an\r\nextraordinary degree (though why we know not) to changed conditions of\r\nlife; and this susceptibility leads both to beneficial and to evil\r\nresults. A large collection of facts on this subject is given in chap.\r\nxviii. of vol. ii. of my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication.’ I can here give only the briefest abstract; and every\r\none interested in the subject may consult the above work. Very slight\r\nchanges increase the health, vigour, and fertility of most or all\r\norganic beings, whilst other changes are known to render a large number\r\nof animals sterile. One of the most familiar cases, is that of tamed\r\nelephants not breeding in India; though they often breed in Ava, where\r\nthe females are allowed to roam about the forests to some extent, and\r\nare thus placed under more natural conditions. The case of various\r\nAmerican monkeys, both sexes of which have been kept for many years\r\ntogether in their own countries, and yet have very rarely or never\r\nbred, is a more apposite instance, because of their relationship to\r\nman. It is remarkable how slight a change in the conditions often\r\ninduces sterility in a wild animal when captured; and this is the more\r\nstrange as all our domesticated animals have become more fertile than\r\nthey were in a state of nature; and some of them can resist the most\r\nunnatural conditions with undiminished fertility. (46. For the evidence\r\non this head, see ‘Variation of Animals,’ etc., vol. ii. p. 111.)\r\nCertain groups of animals are much more liable than others to be\r\naffected by captivity; and generally all the species of the same group\r\nare affected in the same manner. But sometimes a single species in a\r\ngroup is rendered sterile, whilst the others are not so; on the other\r\nhand, a single species may retain its fertility whilst most of the\r\nothers fail to breed. The males and females of some species when\r\nconfined, or when allowed to live almost, but not quite free, in their\r\nnative country, never unite; others thus circumstanced frequently unite\r\nbut never produce offspring; others again produce some offspring, but\r\nfewer than in a state of nature; and as bearing on the above cases of\r\nman, it is important to remark that the young are apt to be weak and\r\nsickly, or malformed, and to perish at an early age.\r\n\r\nSeeing how general is this law of the susceptibility of the\r\nreproductive system to changed conditions of life, and that it holds\r\ngood with our nearest allies, the Quadrumana, I can hardly doubt that\r\nit applies to man in his primeval state. Hence if savages of any race\r\nare induced suddenly to change their habits of life, they become more\r\nor less sterile, and their young offspring suffer in health, in the\r\nsame manner and from the same cause, as do the elephant and\r\nhunting-leopard in India, many monkeys in America, and a host of\r\nanimals of all kinds, on removal from their natural conditions.\r\n\r\nWe can see why it is that aborigines, who have long inhabited islands,\r\nand who must have been long exposed to nearly uniform conditions,\r\nshould be specially affected by any change in their habits, as seems to\r\nbe the case. Civilised races can certainly resist changes of all kinds\r\nfar better than savages; and in this respect they resemble domesticated\r\nanimals, for though the latter sometimes suffer in health (for instance\r\nEuropean dogs in India), yet they are rarely rendered sterile, though a\r\nfew such instances have been recorded. (47. ‘Variation of Animals,’\r\netc., vol. ii. p. 16.) The immunity of civilised races and domesticated\r\nanimals is probably due to their having been subjected to a greater\r\nextent, and therefore having grown somewhat more accustomed, to\r\ndiversified or varying conditions, than the majority of wild animals;\r\nand to their having formerly immigrated or been carried from country to\r\ncountry, and to different families or sub-races having inter-crossed.\r\nIt appears that a cross with civilised races at once gives to an\r\naboriginal race an immunity from the evil consequences of changed\r\nconditions. Thus the crossed offspring from the Tahitians and English,\r\nwhen settled in Pitcairn Island, increased so rapidly that the island\r\nwas soon overstocked; and in June 1856 they were removed to Norfolk\r\nIsland. They then consisted of 60 married persons and 134 children,\r\nmaking a total of 194. Here they likewise increased so rapidly, that\r\nalthough sixteen of them returned to Pitcairn Island in 1859, they\r\nnumbered in January 1868, 300 souls; the males and females being in\r\nexactly equal numbers. What a contrast does this case present with that\r\nof the Tasmanians; the Norfolk Islanders INCREASED in only twelve and a\r\nhalf years from 194 to 300; whereas the Tasmanians DECREASED during\r\nfifteen years from 120 to 46, of which latter number only ten were\r\nchildren. (48. These details are taken from ‘The Mutineers of the\r\n“Bounty,”’ by Lady Belcher, 1870; and from ‘Pitcairn Island,’ ordered\r\nto be printed by the House of Commons, May 29, 1863. The following\r\nstatements about the Sandwich Islanders are from the ‘Honolulu\r\nGazette,’ and from Mr. Coan.)\r\n\r\nSo again in the interval between the census of 1866 and 1872 the\r\nnatives of full blood in the Sandwich Islands decreased by 8081, whilst\r\nthe half-castes, who are believed to be healthier, increased by 847;\r\nbut I do not know whether the latter number includes the offspring from\r\nthe half-castes, or only the half-castes of the first generation.\r\n\r\nThe cases which I have here given all relate to aborigines, who have\r\nbeen subjected to new conditions as the result of the immigration of\r\ncivilised men. But sterility and ill-health would probably follow, if\r\nsavages were compelled by any cause, such as the inroad of a conquering\r\ntribe, to desert their homes and to change their habits. It is an\r\ninteresting circumstance that the chief check to wild animals becoming\r\ndomesticated, which implies the power of their breeding freely when\r\nfirst captured, and one chief check to wild men, when brought into\r\ncontact with civilisation, surviving to form a civilised race, is the\r\nsame, namely, sterility from changed conditions of life.\r\n\r\nFinally, although the gradual decrease and ultimate extinction of the\r\nraces of man is a highly complex problem, depending on many causes\r\nwhich differ in different places and at different times; it is the same\r\nproblem as that presented by the extinction of one of the higher\r\nanimals—of the fossil horse, for instance, which disappeared from South\r\nAmerica, soon afterwards to be replaced, within the same districts, by\r\ncountless troups of the Spanish horse. The New Zealander seems\r\nconscious of this parallelism, for he compares his future fate with\r\nthat of the native rat now almost exterminated by the European rat.\r\nThough the difficulty is great to our imagination, and really great, if\r\nwe wish to ascertain the precise causes and their manner of action, it\r\nought not to be so to our reason, as long as we keep steadily in mind\r\nthat the increase of each species and each race is constantly checked\r\nin various ways; so that if any new check, even a slight one, be\r\nsuperadded, the race will surely decrease in number; and decreasing\r\nnumbers will sooner or later lead to extinction; the end, in most\r\ncases, being promptly determined by the inroads of conquering tribes.\r\n\r\nON THE FORMATION OF THE RACES OF MAN.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the crossing of distinct races has led to the formation\r\nof a new race. The singular fact that the Europeans and Hindoos, who\r\nbelong to the same Aryan stock, and speak a language fundamentally the\r\nsame, differ widely in appearance, whilst Europeans differ but little\r\nfrom Jews, who belong to the Semitic stock, and speak quite another\r\nlanguage, has been accounted for by Broca (49. ‘On Anthropology,’\r\ntranslation, ‘Anthropological Review,’ Jan. 1868, p. 38.), through\r\ncertain Aryan branches having been largely crossed by indigenous tribes\r\nduring their wide diffusion. When two races in close contact cross, the\r\nfirst result is a heterogeneous mixture: thus Mr. Hunter, in describing\r\nthe Santali or hill-tribes of India, says that hundreds of\r\nimperceptible gradations may be traced “from the black, squat tribes of\r\nthe mountains to the tall olive-coloured Brahman, with his intellectual\r\nbrow, calm eyes, and high but narrow head”; so that it is necessary in\r\ncourts of justice to ask the witnesses whether they are Santalis or\r\nHindoos. (50. ‘The Annals of Rural Bengal,’ 1868, p. 134.) Whether a\r\nheterogeneous people, such as the inhabitants of some of the Polynesian\r\nislands, formed by the crossing of two distinct races, with few or no\r\npure members left, would ever become homogeneous, is not known from\r\ndirect evidence. But as with our domesticated animals, a cross-breed\r\ncan certainly be fixed and made uniform by careful selection (51. ‘The\r\nVariation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. p. 95.)\r\nin the course of a few generations, we may infer that the free\r\nintercrossing of a heterogeneous mixture during a long descent would\r\nsupply the place of selection, and overcome any tendency to reversion;\r\nso that the crossed race would ultimately become homogeneous, though it\r\nmight not partake in an equal degree of the characters of the two\r\nparent-races.\r\n\r\nOf all the differences between the races of man, the colour of the skin\r\nis the most conspicuous and one of the best marked. It was formerly\r\nthought that differences of this kind could be accounted for by long\r\nexposure to different climates; but Pallas first shewed that this is\r\nnot tenable, and he has since been followed by almost all\r\nanthropologists. (52. Pallas, ‘Act. Acad. St. Petersburg,’ 1780, part\r\nii. p. 69. He was followed by Rudolphi, in his ‘Beytrage zur\r\nAnthropologie,’ 1812. An excellent summary of the evidence is given by\r\nGodron, ‘De l’Espèce,’ 1859, vol. ii. p. 246, etc.) This view has been\r\nrejected chiefly because the distribution of the variously coloured\r\nraces, most of whom must have long inhabited their present homes, does\r\nnot coincide with corresponding differences of climate. Some little\r\nweight may be given to such cases as that of the Dutch families, who,\r\nas we hear on excellent authority (53. Sir Andrew Smith, as quoted by\r\nKnox, ‘Races of Man,’ 1850, p. 473.), have not undergone the least\r\nchange of colour after residing for three centuries in South Africa. An\r\nargument on the same side may likewise be drawn from the uniform\r\nappearance in various parts of the world of gipsies and Jews, though\r\nthe uniformity of the latter has been somewhat exaggerated. (54. See De\r\nQuatrefages on this head, ‘Revue des Cours Scientifiques,’ Oct. 17,\r\n1868, p. 731.) A very damp or a very dry atmosphere has been supposed\r\nto be more influential in modifying the colour of the skin than mere\r\nheat; but as D’Orbigny in South America, and Livingstone in Africa,\r\narrived at diametrically opposite conclusions with respect to dampness\r\nand dryness, any conclusion on this head must be considered as very\r\ndoubtful. (55. Livingstone’s ‘Travels and Researches in S. Africa,’\r\n1857, pp. 338, 339. D’Orbigny, as quoted by Godron, ‘De l’Espece,’ vol.\r\nii. p. 266.)\r\n\r\nVarious facts, which I have given elsewhere, prove that the colour of\r\nthe skin and hair is sometimes correlated in a surprising manner with a\r\ncomplete immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons, and\r\nfrom the attacks of certain parasites. Hence it occurred to me, that\r\nnegroes and other dark races might have acquired their dark tints by\r\nthe darker individuals escaping from the deadly influence of the miasma\r\nof their native countries, during a long series of generations.\r\n\r\nI afterwards found that this same idea had long ago occurred to Dr.\r\nWells. (56. See a paper read before the Royal Soc. in 1813, and\r\npublished in his Essays in 1818. I have given an account of Dr. Wells’\r\nviews in the Historical Sketch (p. xvi.) to my ‘Origin of Species.’\r\nVarious cases of colour correlated with constitutional peculiarities\r\nare given in my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’\r\nvol. ii. pp. 227, 335.) It has long been known that negroes, and even\r\nmulattoes, are almost completely exempt from the yellow-fever, so\r\ndestructive in tropical America. (57. See, for instance, Nott and\r\nGliddon, ‘Types of Mankind,’ p. 68.) They likewise escape to a large\r\nextent the fatal intermittent fevers, that prevail along at least 2600\r\nmiles of the shores of Africa, and which annually cause one-fifth of\r\nthe white settlers to die, and another fifth to return home invalided.\r\n(58. Major Tulloch, in a paper read before the Statistical Society,\r\nApril 20, 1840, and given in the ‘Athenaeum,’ 1840, p. 353.) This\r\nimmunity in the negro seems to be partly inherent, depending on some\r\nunknown peculiarity of constitution, and partly the result of\r\nacclimatisation. Pouchet (59. ‘The Plurality of the Human Race’\r\n(translat.), 1864, p. 60.) states that the negro regiments recruited\r\nnear the Soudan, and borrowed from the Viceroy of Egypt for the Mexican\r\nwar, escaped the yellow-fever almost equally with the negroes\r\noriginally brought from various parts of Africa and accustomed to the\r\nclimate of the West Indies. That acclimatisation plays a part, is shewn\r\nby the many cases in which negroes have become somewhat liable to\r\ntropical fevers, after having resided for some time in a colder\r\nclimate. (60. Quatrefages, ‘Unité de l’Espèce Humaine,’ 1861, p. 205.\r\nWaitz, ‘Introduction to Anthropology,’ translat., vol. i. 1863, p. 124.\r\nLivingstone gives analogous cases in his ‘Travels.’) The nature of the\r\nclimate under which the white races have long resided, likewise has\r\nsome influence on them; for during the fearful epidemic of yellow fever\r\nin Demerara during 1837, Dr. Blair found that the death-rate of the\r\nimmigrants was proportional to the latitude of the country whence they\r\nhad come. With the negro the immunity, as far as it is the result of\r\nacclimatisation, implies exposure during a prodigious length of time;\r\nfor the aborigines of tropical America who have resided there from time\r\nimmemorial, are not exempt from yellow fever; and the Rev. H.B.\r\nTristram states, that there are districts in Northern Africa which the\r\nnative inhabitants are compelled annually to leave, though the negroes\r\ncan remain with safety.\r\n\r\nThat the immunity of the negro is in any degree correlated with the\r\ncolour of his skin is a mere conjecture: it may be correlated with some\r\ndifference in his blood, nervous system, or other tissues.\r\nNevertheless, from the facts above alluded to, and from some connection\r\napparently existing between complexion and a tendency to consumption,\r\nthe conjecture seemed to me not improbable. Consequently I endeavoured,\r\nwith but little success (61. In the spring of 1862 I obtained\r\npermission from the Director-General of the Medical department of the\r\nArmy, to transmit to the surgeons of the various regiments on foreign\r\nservice a blank table, with the following appended remarks, but I have\r\nreceived no returns. “As several well-marked cases have been recorded\r\nwith our domestic animals of a relation between the colour of the\r\ndermal appendages and the constitution; and it being notorious that\r\nthere is some limited degree of relation between the colour of the\r\nraces of man and the climate inhabited by them; the following\r\ninvestigation seems worth consideration. Namely, whether there is any\r\nrelation in Europeans between the colour of their hair, and their\r\nliability to the diseases of tropical countries. If the surgeons of the\r\nseveral regiments, when stationed in unhealthy tropical districts,\r\nwould be so good as first to count, as a standard of comparison, how\r\nmany men, in the force whence the sick are drawn, have dark and\r\nlight-coloured hair, and hair of intermediate or doubtful tints; and if\r\na similar account were kept by the same medical gentlemen, of all the\r\nmen who suffered from malarious and yellow fevers, or from dysentery,\r\nit would soon be apparent, after some thousand cases had been\r\ntabulated, whether there exists any relation between the colour of the\r\nhair and constitutional liability to tropical diseases. Perhaps no such\r\nrelation would be discovered, but the investigation is well worth\r\nmaking. In case any positive result were obtained, it might be of some\r\npractical use in selecting men for any particular service.\r\nTheoretically the result would be of high interest, as indicating one\r\nmeans by which a race of men inhabiting from a remote period an\r\nunhealthy tropical climate, might have become dark-coloured by the\r\nbetter preservation of dark-haired or dark-complexioned individuals\r\nduring a long succession of generations.”), to ascertain how far it\r\nholds good. The late Dr. Daniell, who had long lived on the West Coast\r\nof Africa, told me that he did not believe in any such relation. He was\r\nhimself unusually fair, and had withstood the climate in a wonderful\r\nmanner. When he first arrived as a boy on the coast, an old and\r\nexperienced negro chief predicted from his appearance that this would\r\nprove the case. Dr. Nicholson, of Antigua, after having attended to\r\nthis subject, writes to me that dark-coloured Europeans escape the\r\nyellow fever more than those that are light-coloured. Mr. J.M. Harris\r\naltogether denies that Europeans with dark hair withstand a hot climate\r\nbetter than other men: on the contrary, experience has taught him in\r\nmaking a selection of men for service on the coast of Africa, to choose\r\nthose with red hair. (62. ‘Anthropological Review,’ Jan. 1866, p. xxi.\r\nDr. Sharpe also says, with respect to India (‘Man a Special Creation,’\r\n1873, p. 118), “that it has been noticed by some medical officers that\r\nEuropeans with light hair and florid complexions suffer less from\r\ndiseases of tropical countries than persons with dark hair and sallow\r\ncomplexions; and, so far as I know, there appear to be good grounds for\r\nthis remark.” On the other hand, Mr. Heddle, of Sierra Leone, “who has\r\nhad more clerks killed under him than any other man,” by the climate of\r\nthe West African Coast (W. Reade, ‘African Sketch Book,’ vol. ii. p.\r\n522), holds a directly opposite view, as does Capt. Burton.) As far,\r\ntherefore, as these slight indications go, there seems no foundation\r\nfor the hypothesis, that blackness has resulted from the darker and\r\ndarker individuals having survived better during long exposure to\r\nfever-generating miasma.\r\n\r\nDr. Sharpe remarks (63. ‘Man a Special Creation,’ 1873, p. 119.), that\r\na tropical sun, which burns and blisters a white skin, does not injure\r\na black one at all; and, as he adds, this is not due to habit in the\r\nindividual, for children only six or eight months old are often carried\r\nabout naked, and are not affected. I have been assured by a medical\r\nman, that some years ago during each summer, but not during the winter,\r\nhis hands became marked with light brown patches, like, although larger\r\nthan freckles, and that these patches were never affected by\r\nsun-burning, whilst the white parts of his skin have on several\r\noccasions been much inflamed and blistered. With the lower animals\r\nthere is, also, a constitutional difference in liability to the action\r\nof the sun between those parts of the skin clothed with white hair and\r\nother parts. (64. ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. pp. 336, 337.) Whether the saving of the skin\r\nfrom being thus burnt is of sufficient importance to account for a dark\r\ntint having been gradually acquired by man through natural selection, I\r\nam unable to judge. If it be so, we should have to assume that the\r\nnatives of tropical America have lived there for a much shorter time\r\nthan the Negroes in Africa, or the Papuans in the southern parts of the\r\nMalay archipelago, just as the lighter-coloured Hindoos have resided in\r\nIndia for a shorter time than the darker aborigines of the central and\r\nsouthern parts of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nAlthough with our present knowledge we cannot account for the\r\ndifferences of colour in the races of man, through any advantage thus\r\ngained, or from the direct action of climate; yet we must not quite\r\nignore the latter agency, for there is good reason to believe that some\r\ninherited effect is thus produced. (65. See, for instance, Quatrefages\r\n(‘Revue des Cours Scientifiques,’ Oct. 10, 1868, p. 724) on the effects\r\nof residence in Abyssinia and Arabia, and other analogous cases. Dr.\r\nRolle (‘Der Mensch, seine Abstammung,’ etc., 1865, s. 99) states, on\r\nthe authority of Khanikof, that the greater number of German families\r\nsettled in Georgia, have acquired in the course of two generations dark\r\nhair and eyes. Mr. D. Forbes informs me that the Quichuas in the Andes\r\nvary greatly in colour, according to the position of the valleys\r\ninhabited by them.)\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the second chapter that the conditions of life affect\r\nthe development of the bodily frame in a direct manner, and that the\r\neffects are transmitted. Thus, as is generally admitted, the European\r\nsettlers in the United States undergo a slight but extraordinary rapid\r\nchange of appearance. Their bodies and limbs become elongated; and I\r\nhear from Col. Bernys that during the late war in the United States,\r\ngood evidence was afforded of this fact by the ridiculous appearance\r\npresented by the German regiments, when dressed in ready-made clothes\r\nmanufactured for the American market, and which were much too long for\r\nthe men in every way. There is, also, a considerable body of evidence\r\nshewing that in the Southern States the house-slaves of the third\r\ngeneration present a markedly different appearance from the\r\nfield-slaves. (66. Harlan, ‘Medical Researches,’ p. 532. Quatrefages\r\n(‘Unité de l’Espèce Humaine,’ 1861, p. 128) has collected much evidence\r\non this head.)\r\n\r\nIf, however, we look to the races of man as distributed over the world,\r\nwe must infer that their characteristic differences cannot be accounted\r\nfor by the direct action of different conditions of life, even after\r\nexposure to them for an enormous period of time. The Esquimaux live\r\nexclusively on animal food; they are clothed in thick fur, and are\r\nexposed to intense cold and to prolonged darkness; yet they do not\r\ndiffer in any extreme degree from the inhabitants of Southern China,\r\nwho live entirely on vegetable food, and are exposed almost naked to a\r\nhot, glaring climate. The unclothed Fuegians live on the marine\r\nproductions of their inhospitable shores; the Botocudos of Brazil\r\nwander about the hot forests of the interior and live chiefly on\r\nvegetable productions; yet these tribes resemble each other so closely\r\nthat the Fuegians on board the “Beagle” were mistaken by some\r\nBrazilians for Botocudos. The Botocudos again, as well as the other\r\ninhabitants of tropical America, are wholly different from the Negroes\r\nwho inhabit the opposite shores of the Atlantic, are exposed to a\r\nnearly similar climate, and follow nearly the same habits of life.\r\n\r\nNor can the differences between the races of man be accounted for by\r\nthe inherited effects of the increased or decreased use of parts,\r\nexcept to a quite insignificant degree. Men who habitually live in\r\ncanoes, may have their legs somewhat stunted; those who inhabit lofty\r\nregions may have their chests enlarged; and those who constantly use\r\ncertain sense-organs may have the cavities in which they are lodged\r\nsomewhat increased in size, and their features consequently a little\r\nmodified. With civilised nations, the reduced size of the jaws from\r\nlessened use—the habitual play of different muscles serving to express\r\ndifferent emotions—and the increased size of the brain from greater\r\nintellectual activity, have together produced a considerable effect on\r\ntheir general appearance when compared with savages. (67. See Prof.\r\nSchaaffhausen, translat., in ‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct. 1868, p.\r\n429.) Increased bodily stature, without any corresponding increase in\r\nthe size of the brain, may (judging from the previously adduced case of\r\nrabbits), have given to some races an elongated skull of the\r\ndolichocephalic type.\r\n\r\nLastly, the little-understood principle of correlated development has\r\nsometimes come into action, as in the case of great muscular\r\ndevelopment and strongly projecting supra-orbital ridges. The colour of\r\nthe skin and hair are plainly correlated, as is the texture of the hair\r\nwith its colour in the Mandans of North America. (68. Mr. Catlin states\r\n(‘N. American Indians,’ 3rd ed., 1842, vol. i. p. 49) that in the whole\r\ntribe of the Mandans, about one in ten or twelve of the members, of all\r\nages and both sexes, have bright silvery grey hair, which is\r\nhereditary. Now this hair is as coarse and harsh as that of a horse’s\r\nmane, whilst the hair of other colours is fine and soft.) The colour\r\nalso of the skin, and the odour emitted by it, are likewise in some\r\nmanner connected. With the breeds of sheep the number of hairs within a\r\ngiven space and the number of excretory pores are related. (69. On the\r\nodour of the skin, Godron, ‘Sur l’Espèce,’ tom. ii. p. 217. On the\r\npores in the skin, Dr. Wilckens, ‘Die Aufgaben der Landwirth.\r\nZootechnik,’ 1869, s. 7.) If we may judge from the analogy of our\r\ndomesticated animals, many modifications of structure in man probably\r\ncome under this principle of correlated development.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that the external characteristic differences between\r\nthe races of man cannot be accounted for in a satisfactory manner by\r\nthe direct action of the conditions of life, nor by the effects of the\r\ncontinued use of parts, nor through the principle of correlation. We\r\nare therefore led to enquire whether slight individual differences, to\r\nwhich man is eminently liable, may not have been preserved and\r\naugmented during a long series of generations through natural\r\nselection. But here we are at once met by the objection that beneficial\r\nvariations alone can be thus preserved; and as far as we are enabled to\r\njudge, although always liable to err on this head, none of the\r\ndifferences between the races of man are of any direct or special\r\nservice to him. The intellectual and moral or social faculties must of\r\ncourse be excepted from this remark. The great variability of all the\r\nexternal differences between the races of man, likewise indicates that\r\nthey cannot be of much importance; for if important, they would long\r\nago have been either fixed and preserved, or eliminated. In this\r\nrespect man resembles those forms, called by naturalists protean or\r\npolymorphic, which have remained extremely variable, owing, as it\r\nseems, to such variations being of an indifferent nature, and to their\r\nhaving thus escaped the action of natural selection.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far been baffled in all our attempts to account for the\r\ndifferences between the races of man; but there remains one important\r\nagency, namely Sexual Selection, which appears to have acted powerfully\r\non man, as on many other animals. I do not intend to assert that sexual\r\nselection will account for all the differences between the races. An\r\nunexplained residuum is left, about which we can only say, in our\r\nignorance, that as individuals are continually born with, for instance,\r\nheads a little rounder or narrower, and with noses a little longer or\r\nshorter, such slight differences might become fixed and uniform, if the\r\nunknown agencies which induced them were to act in a more constant\r\nmanner, aided by long-continued intercrossing. Such variations come\r\nunder the provisional class, alluded to in our second chapter, which\r\nfor want of a better term are often called spontaneous. Nor do I\r\npretend that the effects of sexual selection can be indicated with\r\nscientific precision; but it can be shewn that it would be an\r\ninexplicable fact if man had not been modified by this agency, which\r\nappears to have acted powerfully on innumerable animals. It can further\r\nbe shewn that the differences between the races of man, as in colour,\r\nhairiness, form of features, etc., are of a kind which might have been\r\nexpected to come under the influence of sexual selection. But in order\r\nto treat this subject properly, I have found it necessary to pass the\r\nwhole animal kingdom in review. I have therefore devoted to it the\r\nSecond Part of this work. At the close I shall return to man, and,\r\nafter attempting to shew how far he has been modified through sexual\r\nselection, will give a brief summary of the chapters in this First\r\nPart.\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE RESEMBLANCES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE STRUCTURE AND THE\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN IN MAN AND APES BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nThe controversy respecting the nature and the extent of the differences\r\nin the structure of the brain in man and the apes, which arose some\r\nfifteen years ago, has not yet come to an end, though the subject\r\nmatter of the dispute is, at present, totally different from what it\r\nwas formerly. It was originally asserted and re-asserted, with singular\r\npertinacity, that the brain of all the apes, even the highest, differs\r\nfrom that of man, in the absence of such conspicuous structures as the\r\nposterior lobes of the cerebral hemispheres, with the posterior cornu\r\nof the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor, contained in those\r\nlobes, which are so obvious in man.\r\n\r\nBut the truth that the three structures in question are as well\r\ndeveloped in apes’ as in human brains, or even better; and that it is\r\ncharacteristic of all the Primates (if we exclude the Lemurs) to have\r\nthese parts well developed, stands at present on as secure a basis as\r\nany proposition in comparative anatomy. Moreover, it is admitted by\r\nevery one of the long series of anatomists who, of late years, have\r\npaid special attention to the arrangement of the complicated sulci and\r\ngyri which appear upon the surface of the cerebral hemispheres in man\r\nand the higher apes, that they are disposed after the very same pattern\r\nin him, as in them. Every principal gyrus and sulcus of a chimpanzee’s\r\nbrain is clearly represented in that of a man, so that the terminology\r\nwhich applies to the one answers for the other. On this point there is\r\nno difference of opinion. Some years since, Professor Bischoff\r\npublished a memoir (70. ‘Die Grosshirn-Windungen des Menschen;’\r\n‘Abhandlungen der K. Bayerischen Akademie,’ B. x. 1868.) on the\r\ncerebral convolutions of man and apes; and as the purpose of my learned\r\ncolleague was certainly not to diminish the value of the differences\r\nbetween apes and men in this respect, I am glad to make a citation from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“That the apes, and especially the orang, chimpanzee and gorilla, come\r\nvery close to man in their organisation, much nearer than to any other\r\nanimal, is a well known fact, disputed by nobody. Looking at the matter\r\nfrom the point of view of organisation alone, no one probably would\r\never have disputed the view of Linnaeus, that man should be placed,\r\nmerely as a peculiar species, at the head of the mammalia and of those\r\napes. Both shew, in all their organs, so close an affinity, that the\r\nmost exact anatomical investigation is needed in order to demonstrate\r\nthose differences which really exist. So it is with the brains. The\r\nbrains of man, the orang, the chimpanzee, the gorilla, in spite of all\r\nthe important differences which they present, come very close to one\r\nanother” (loc. cit. p. 101).\r\n\r\nThere remains, then, no dispute as to the resemblance in fundamental\r\ncharacters, between the ape’s brain and man’s: nor any as to the\r\nwonderfully close similarity between the chimpanzee, orang and man, in\r\neven the details of the arrangement of the gyri and sulci of the\r\ncerebral hemispheres. Nor, turning to the differences between the\r\nbrains of the highest apes and that of man, is there any serious\r\nquestion as to the nature and extent of these differences. It is\r\nadmitted that the man’s cerebral hemispheres are absolutely and\r\nrelatively larger than those of the orang and chimpanzee; that his\r\nfrontal lobes are less excavated by the upward protrusion of the roof\r\nof the orbits; that his gyri and sulci are, as a rule, less\r\nsymmetrically disposed, and present a greater number of secondary\r\nplications. And it is admitted that, as a rule, in man, the\r\ntemporo-occipital or “external perpendicular” fissure, which is usually\r\nso strongly marked a feature of the ape’s brain is but faintly marked.\r\nBut it is also clear, that none of these differences constitutes a\r\nsharp demarcation between the man’s and the ape’s brain. In respect to\r\nthe external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet, in the human brain for\r\ninstance, Professor Turner remarks: (71. ‘Convolutions of the Human\r\nCerebrum Topographically Considered,’ 1866, p. 12.)\r\n\r\n“In some brains it appears simply as an indentation of the margin of\r\nthe hemisphere, but, in others, it extends for some distance more or\r\nless transversely outwards. I saw it in the right hemisphere of a\r\nfemale brain pass more than two inches outwards; and on another\r\nspecimen, also the right hemisphere, it proceeded for four-tenths of an\r\ninch outwards, and then extended downwards, as far as the lower margin\r\nof the outer surface of the hemisphere. The imperfect definition of\r\nthis fissure in the majority of human brains, as compared with its\r\nremarkable distinctness in the brain of most Quadrumana, is owing to\r\nthe presence, in the former, of certain superficial, well marked,\r\nsecondary convolutions which bridge it over and connect the parietal\r\nwith the occipital lobe. The closer the first of these bridging gyri\r\nlies to the longitudinal fissure, the shorter is the external\r\nparieto-occipital fissure” (loc. cit. p. 12).\r\n\r\nThe obliteration of the external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet,\r\ntherefore, is not a constant character of the human brain. On the other\r\nhand, its full development is not a constant character of the higher\r\nape’s brain. For, in the chimpanzee, the more or less extensive\r\nobliteration of the external perpendicular sulcus by “bridging\r\nconvolutions,” on one side or the other, has been noted over and over\r\nagain by Prof. Rolleston, Mr. Marshall, M. Broca and Professor Turner.\r\nAt the conclusion of a special paper on this subject the latter writes:\r\n(72. Notes more especially on the bridging convolutions in the Brain of\r\nthe Chimpanzee, ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,’\r\n1865-6.)\r\n\r\n“The three specimens of the brain of a chimpanzee, just described,\r\nprove, that the generalisation which Gratiolet has attempted to draw of\r\nthe complete absence of the first connecting convolution and the\r\nconcealment of the second, as essentially characteristic features in\r\nthe brain of this animal, is by no means universally applicable. In\r\nonly one specimen did the brain, in these particulars, follow the law\r\nwhich Gratiolet has expressed. As regards the presence of the superior\r\nbridging convolution, I am inclined to think that it has existed in one\r\nhemisphere, at least, in a majority of the brains of this animal which\r\nhave, up to this time, been figured or described. The superficial\r\nposition of the second bridging convolution is evidently less frequent,\r\nand has as yet, I believe, only been seen in the brain (A) recorded in\r\nthis communication. The asymmetrical arrangement in the convolutions of\r\nthe two hemispheres, which previous observers have referred to in their\r\ndescriptions, is also well illustrated in these specimens” (pp. 8, 9).\r\n\r\nEven were the presence of the temporo-occipital, or external\r\nperpendicular, sulcus, a mark of distinction between the higher apes\r\nand man, the value of such a distinctive character would be rendered\r\nvery doubtful by the structure of the brain in the Platyrrhine apes. In\r\nfact, while the temporo-occipital is one of the most constant of sulci\r\nin the Catarrhine, or Old World, apes, it is never very strongly\r\ndeveloped in the New World apes; it is absent in the smaller\r\nPlatyrrhini; rudimentary in Pithecia (73. Flower, ‘On the Anatomy of\r\nPithecia Monachus,’ ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1862.);\r\nand more or less obliterated by bridging convolutions in Ateles.\r\n\r\nA character which is thus variable within the limits of a single group\r\ncan have no great taxonomic value.\r\n\r\nIt is further established, that the degree of asymmetry of the\r\nconvolution of the two sides in the human brain is subject to much\r\nindividual variation; and that, in those individuals of the Bushman\r\nrace who have been examined, the gyri and sulci of the two hemispheres\r\nare considerably less complicated and more symmetrical than in the\r\nEuropean brain, while, in some individuals of the chimpanzee, their\r\ncomplexity and asymmetry become notable. This is particularly the case\r\nin the brain of a young male chimpanzee figured by M. Broca. (‘L’ordre\r\ndes Primates,’ p. 165, fig. 11.)\r\n\r\nAgain, as respects the question of absolute size, it is established\r\nthat the difference between the largest and the smallest healthy human\r\nbrain is greater than the difference between the smallest healthy human\r\nbrain and the largest chimpanzee’s or orang’s brain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is one circumstance in which the orang’s and\r\nchimpanzee’s brains resemble man’s, but in which they differ from the\r\nlower apes, and that is the presence of two corpora candicantia—the\r\nCynomorpha having but one.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts I do not hesitate in this year 1874, to repeat\r\nand insist upon the proposition which I enunciated in 1863: (74. ‘Man’s\r\nPlace in Nature,’ p. 102.)\r\n\r\n“So far as cerebral structure goes, therefore, it is clear that man\r\ndiffers less from the chimpanzee or the orang, than these do even from\r\nthe monkeys, and that the difference between the brain of the\r\nchimpanzee and of man is almost insignificant when compared with that\r\nbetween the chimpanzee brain and that of a Lemur.”\r\n\r\nIn the paper to which I have referred, Professor Bischoff does not deny\r\nthe second part of this statement, but he first makes the irrelevant\r\nremark that it is not wonderful if the brains of an orang and a Lemur\r\nare very different; and secondly, goes on to assert that, “If we\r\nsuccessively compare the brain of a man with that of an orang; the\r\nbrain of this with that of a chimpanzee; of this with that of a\r\ngorilla, and so on of a Hylobates, Semnopithecus, Cynocephalus,\r\nCercopithecus, Macacus, Cebus, Callithrix, Lemur, Stenops, Hapale, we\r\nshall not meet with a greater, or even as great a, break in the degree\r\nof development of the convolutions, as we find between the brain of a\r\nman and that of an orang or chimpanzee.”\r\n\r\nTo which I reply, firstly, that whether this assertion be true or\r\nfalse, it has nothing whatever to do with the proposition enunciated in\r\n‘Man’s Place in Nature,’ which refers not to the development of the\r\nconvolutions alone, but to the structure of the whole brain. If\r\nProfessor Bischoff had taken the trouble to refer to p. 96 of the work\r\nhe criticises, in fact, he would have found the following passage: “And\r\nit is a remarkable circumstance that though, so far as our present\r\nknowledge extends, there IS one true structural break in the series of\r\nforms of Simian brains, this hiatus does not lie between man and the\r\nmanlike apes, but between the lower and the lowest Simians, or in other\r\nwords, between the Old and New World apes and monkeys and the Lemurs.\r\nEvery Lemur which has yet been examined, in fact, has its cerebellum\r\npartially visible from above; and its posterior lobe, with the\r\ncontained posterior cornu and hippocampus minor, more or less\r\nrudimentary. Every marmoset, American monkey, Old World monkey, baboon\r\nor manlike ape, on the contrary, has its cerebellum entirely hidden,\r\nposteriorly, by the cerebral lobes, and possesses a large posterior\r\ncornu with a well-developed hippocampus minor.”\r\n\r\nThis statement was a strictly accurate account of what was known when\r\nit was made; and it does not appear to me to be more than apparently\r\nweakened by the subsequent discovery of the relatively small\r\ndevelopment of the posterior lobes in the Siamang and in the Howling\r\nmonkey. Notwithstanding the exceptional brevity of the posterior lobes\r\nin these two species, no one will pretend that their brains, in the\r\nslightest degree, approach those of the Lemurs. And if, instead of\r\nputting Hapale out of its natural place, as Professor Bischoff most\r\nunaccountably does, we write the series of animals he has chosen to\r\nmention as follows: Homo, Pithecus, Troglodytes, Hylobates,\r\nSemnopithecus, Cynocephalus, Cercopithecus, Macacus, Cebus, Callithrix,\r\nHapale, Lemur, Stenops, I venture to reaffirm that the great break in\r\nthis series lies between Hapale and Lemur, and that this break is\r\nconsiderably greater than that between any other two terms of that\r\nseries. Professor Bischoff ignores the fact that long before he wrote,\r\nGratiolet had suggested the separation of the Lemurs from the other\r\nPrimates on the very ground of the difference in their cerebral\r\ncharacters; and that Professor Flower had made the following\r\nobservations in the course of his description of the brain of the Javan\r\nLoris: (75. ‘Transactions of the Zoological Society,’ vol. v. 1862.)\r\n\r\n“And it is especially remarkable that, in the development of the\r\nposterior lobes, there is no approximation to the Lemurine, short\r\nhemisphered brain, in those monkeys which are commonly supposed to\r\napproach this family in other respects, viz. the lower members of the\r\nPlatyrrhine group.”\r\n\r\nSo far as the structure of the adult brain is concerned, then, the very\r\nconsiderable additions to our knowledge, which have been made by the\r\nresearches of so many investigators, during the past ten years, fully\r\njustify the statement which I made in 1863. But it has been said, that,\r\nadmitting the similarity between the adult brains of man and apes, they\r\nare nevertheless, in reality, widely different, because they exhibit\r\nfundamental differences in the mode of their development. No one would\r\nbe more ready than I to admit the force of this argument, if such\r\nfundamental differences of development really exist. But I deny that\r\nthey do exist. On the contrary, there is a fundamental agreement in the\r\ndevelopment of the brain in men and apes.\r\n\r\nGratiolet originated the statement that there is a fundamental\r\ndifference in the development of the brains of apes and that of\r\nman—consisting in this; that, in the apes, the sulci which first make\r\ntheir appearance are situated on the posterior region of the cerebral\r\nhemispheres, while, in the human foetus, the sulci first become visible\r\non the frontal lobes. (76. Chez tous les singes, les plis postérieurs\r\nse developpent les premiers; les plis antérieurs se developpent plus\r\ntard, aussi la vertèbre occipitale et la parietale sont-elles\r\nrelativement tres-grandes chez le foetus. L’Homme présente une\r\nexception remarquable quant a l’époque de l’apparition des plis\r\nfrontaux, qui sont les premiers indiqués; mais le développement general\r\ndu lobe frontal, envisagé seulement par rapport a son volume, suit les\r\nmêmes lois que dans les singes: Gratiolet, ‘Mémoire sur les plis\r\ncérèbres de l’Homme et des Primateaux,’ p. 39, Tab. iv, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThis general statement is based upon two observations, the one of a\r\nGibbon almost ready to be born, in which the posterior gyri were “well\r\ndeveloped,” while those of the frontal lobes were “hardly indicated”\r\n(77. Gratiolet’s words are (loc. cit. p. 39): “Dans le foetus dont il\r\ns’agit les plis cérébraux posterieurs sont bien developpés, tandis que\r\nles plis du lobe frontal sont a peine indiqués.” The figure, however\r\n(Pl. iv, fig. 3), shews the fissure of Rolando, and one of the frontal\r\nsulci plainly enough. Nevertheless, M. Alix, in his ‘Notice sur les\r\ntravaux anthropologiques de Gratiolet’ (‘Mem. de la Societé\r\nd’Anthropologie de Paris,’ 1868, page 32), writes thus: “Gratiolet a eu\r\nentre les mains le cerveau d’un foetus de Gibbon, singe eminemment\r\nsupérieur, et tellement rapproché de l’orang, que des naturalistes\r\ntres-compétents l’ont rangé parmi les anthropoides. M. Huxley, par\r\nexemple, n’hesite pas sur ce point. Eh bien, c’est sur le cerveau d’un\r\nfoetus de Gibbon que Gratiolet a vu LES CIRCONVOLUTIONS DU LOBE\r\nTEMPORO-SPHENOIDAL DÉJÀ DEVELOPPÉES LORSQU’IL N’EXISTENT PAS ENCORE DE\r\nPLIS SUR LE LOBE FRONTAL. Il etait donc bien autorisé a dire que, chez\r\nl’homme les circonvolutions apparaissent d’a en w, tandis que chez les\r\nsinges elles se developpent d’w en a.”), and the other of a human\r\nfoetus at the 22nd or 23rd week of uterogestation, in which Gratiolet\r\nnotes that the insula was uncovered, but that nevertheless “des\r\nincisures sement de lobe anterieur, une scissure peu profonde indique\r\nla separation du lobe occipital, tres-reduit, d’ailleurs dès cette\r\népoque. Le reste de la surface cérébrale est encore absolument lisse.”\r\n\r\nThree views of this brain are given in Plate II, figs. 1, 2, 3, of the\r\nwork cited, shewing the upper, lateral and inferior views of the\r\nhemispheres, but not the inner view. It is worthy of note that the\r\nfigure by no means bears out Gratiolet’s description, inasmuch as the\r\nfissure (antero-temporal) on the posterior half of the face of the\r\nhemisphere is more marked than any of those vaguely indicated in the\r\nanterior half. If the figure is correct, it in no way justifies\r\nGratiolet’s conclusion: “Il y a donc entre ces cerveaux [those of a\r\nCallithrix and of a Gibbon] et celui du foetus humain une différence\r\nfondamental. Chez celui-ci, longtemps avant que les plis temporaux\r\napparaissent, les plis frontaux, ESSAYENT d’exister.”\r\n\r\nSince Gratiolet’s time, however, the development of the gyri and sulci\r\nof the brain has been made the subject of renewed investigation by\r\nSchmidt, Bischoff, Pansch (78. ‘Ueber die typische Anordnung der\r\nFurchen und Windungen auf den Grosshirn-Hemisphären des Menschen und\r\nder Affen,’ ‘Archiv für Anthropologie,’ iii. 1868.), and more\r\nparticularly by Ecker (79. ‘Zur Entwicklungs Geschichte der Furchen und\r\nWindungen der Grosshirn-Hemisphären im Foetus des Menschen,’ ‘Archiv\r\nfür Anthropologie,’ iii. 1868.), whose work is not only the latest, but\r\nby far the most complete, memoir on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe final results of their inquiries may be summed up as follows:— 1.\r\nIn the human foetus, the sylvian fissure is formed in the course of the\r\nthird month of uterogestation. In this, and in the fourth month, the\r\ncerebral hemispheres are smooth and rounded (with the exception of the\r\nsylvian depression), and they project backwards far beyond the\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\n2. The sulci, properly so called, begin to appear in the interval\r\nbetween the end of the fourth and the beginning of the sixth month of\r\nfoetal life, but Ecker is careful to point out that, not only the time,\r\nbut the order, of their appearance is subject to considerable\r\nindividual variation. In no case, however, are either the frontal or\r\nthe temporal sulci the earliest.\r\n\r\nThe first which appears, in fact, lies on the inner face of the\r\nhemisphere (whence doubtless Gratiolet, who does not seem to have\r\nexamined that face in his foetus, overlooked it), and is either the\r\ninternal perpendicular (occipito-parietal), or the calcarine sulcus,\r\nthese two being close together and eventually running into one another.\r\nAs a rule the occipito-parietal is the earlier of the two.\r\n\r\n3. At the latter part of this period, another sulcus, the\r\n“posterio-parietal,” or “Fissure of Rolando” is developed, and it is\r\nfollowed, in the course of the sixth month, by the other principal\r\nsulci of the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. There is,\r\nhowever, no clear evidence that one of these constantly appears before\r\nthe other; and it is remarkable that, in the brain at the period\r\ndescribed and figured by Ecker (loc. cit. pp. 212-213, Taf. II, figs.\r\n1, 2, 3, 4), the antero-temporal sulcus (scissure parallele) so\r\ncharacteristic of the ape’s brain, is as well, if not better developed\r\nthan the fissure of Rolando, and is much more marked than the proper\r\nfrontal sulci.\r\n\r\nTaking the facts as they now stand, it appears to me that the order of\r\nthe appearance of the sulci and gyri in the foetal human brain is in\r\nperfect harmony with the general doctrine of evolution, and with the\r\nview that man has been evolved from some ape-like form; though there\r\ncan be no doubt that form was, in many respects, different from any\r\nmember of the Primates now living.\r\n\r\nVon Baer taught us, half a century ago, that, in the course of their\r\ndevelopment, allied animals put on at first, the characters of the\r\ngreater groups to which they belong, and, by degrees, assume those\r\nwhich restrict them within the limits of their family, genus, and\r\nspecies; and he proved, at the same time, that no developmental stage\r\nof a higher animal is precisely similar to the adult condition of any\r\nlower animal. It is quite correct to say that a frog passes through the\r\ncondition of a fish, inasmuch as at one period of its life the tadpole\r\nhas all the characters of a fish, and if it went no further, would have\r\nto be grouped among fishes. But it is equally true that a tadpole is\r\nvery different from any known fish.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the brain of a human foetus, at the fifth month, may\r\ncorrectly be said to be, not only the brain of an ape, but that of an\r\nArctopithecine or marmoset-like ape; for its hemispheres, with their\r\ngreat posterior lobster, and with no sulci but the sylvian and the\r\ncalcarine, present the characteristics found only in the group of the\r\nArctopithecine Primates. But it is equally true, as Gratiolet remarks,\r\nthat, in its widely open sylvian fissure, it differs from the brain of\r\nany actual marmoset. No doubt it would be much more similar to the\r\nbrain of an advanced foetus of a marmoset. But we know nothing whatever\r\nof the development of the brain in the marmosets. In the Platyrrhini\r\nproper, the only observation with which I am acquainted is due to\r\nPansch, who found in the brain of a foetal Cebus Apella, in addition to\r\nthe sylvian fissure and the deep calcarine fissure, only a very shallow\r\nantero-temporal fissure (scissure parallele of Gratiolet).\r\n\r\nNow this fact, taken together with the circumstance that the\r\nantero-temporal sulcus is present in such Platyrrhini as the Saimiri,\r\nwhich present mere traces of sulci on the anterior half of the exterior\r\nof the cerebral hemispheres, or none at all, undoubtedly, so far as it\r\ngoes, affords fair evidence in favour of Gratiolet’s hypothesis, that\r\nthe posterior sulci appear before the anterior, in the brains of the\r\nPlatyrrhini. But, it by no means follows, that the rule which may hold\r\ngood for the Platyrrhini extends to the Catarrhini. We have no\r\ninformation whatever respecting the development of the brain in the\r\nCynomorpha; and, as regards the Anthropomorpha, nothing but the account\r\nof the brain of the Gibbon, near birth, already referred to. At the\r\npresent moment there is not a shadow of evidence to shew that the sulci\r\nof a chimpanzee’s, or orang’s, brain do not appear in the same order as\r\na man’s.\r\n\r\nGratiolet opens his preface with the aphorism: “Il est dangereux dans\r\nles sciences de conclure trop vite.” I fear he must have forgotten this\r\nsound maxim by the time he had reached the discussion of the\r\ndifferences between men and apes, in the body of his work. No doubt,\r\nthe excellent author of one of the most remarkable contributions to the\r\njust understanding of the mammalian brain which has ever been made,\r\nwould have been the first to admit the insufficiency of his data had he\r\nlived to profit by the advance of inquiry. The misfortune is that his\r\nconclusions have been employed by persons incompetent to appreciate\r\ntheir foundation, as arguments in favour of obscurantism. (80. For\r\nexample, M. l’Abbe Lecomte in his terrible pamphlet, ‘Le Darwinisme et\r\nl’origine de l’Homme,’ 1873.)\r\n\r\nBut it is important to remark that, whether Gratiolet was right or\r\nwrong in his hypothesis respecting the relative order of appearance of\r\nthe temporal and frontal sulci, the fact remains; that before either\r\ntemporal or frontal sulci, appear, the foetal brain of man presents\r\ncharacters which are found only in the lowest group of the Primates\r\n(leaving out the Lemurs); and that this is exactly what we should\r\nexpect to be the case, if man has resulted from the gradual\r\nmodification of the same form as that from which the other Primates\r\nhave sprung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nPRINCIPLES OF SEXUAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary sexual characters—Sexual selection—Manner of action—Excess of\r\nmales—Polygamy—The male alone generally modified through sexual\r\nselection—Eagerness of the male—Variability of the male—Choice exerted\r\nby the female—Sexual compared with natural selection—Inheritance, at\r\ncorresponding periods of life, at corresponding seasons of the year,\r\nand as limited by sex—Relations between the several forms of\r\ninheritance—Causes why one sex and the young are not modified through\r\nsexual selection—Supplement on the proportional numbers of the two\r\nsexes throughout the animal kingdom—The proportion of the sexes in\r\nrelation to natural selection.\r\n\r\nWith animals which have their sexes separated, the males necessarily\r\ndiffer from the females in their organs of reproduction; and these are\r\nthe primary sexual characters. But the sexes often differ in what\r\nHunter has called secondary sexual characters, which are not directly\r\nconnected with the act of reproduction; for instance, the male\r\npossesses certain organs of sense or locomotion, of which the female is\r\nquite destitute, or has them more highly-developed, in order that he\r\nmay readily find or reach her; or again the male has special organs of\r\nprehension for holding her securely. These latter organs, of infinitely\r\ndiversified kinds, graduate into those which are commonly ranked as\r\nprimary, and in some cases can hardly be distinguished from them; we\r\nsee instances of this in the complex appendages at the apex of the\r\nabdomen in male insects. Unless indeed we confine the term “primary” to\r\nthe reproductive glands, it is scarcely possible to decide which ought\r\nto be called primary and which secondary.\r\n\r\nThe female often differs from the male in having organs for the\r\nnourishment or protection of her young, such as the mammary glands of\r\nmammals, and the abdominal sacks of the marsupials. In some few cases\r\nalso the male possesses similar organs, which are wanting in the\r\nfemale, such as the receptacles for the ova in certain male fishes, and\r\nthose temporarily developed in certain male frogs. The females of most\r\nbees are provided with a special apparatus for collecting and carrying\r\npollen, and their ovipositor is modified into a sting for the defence\r\nof the larvae and the community. Many similar cases could be given, but\r\nthey do not here concern us. There are, however, other sexual\r\ndifferences quite unconnected with the primary reproductive organs, and\r\nit is with these that we are more especially concerned—such as the\r\ngreater size, strength, and pugnacity of the male, his weapons of\r\noffence or means of defence against rivals, his gaudy colouring and\r\nvarious ornaments, his power of song, and other such characters.\r\n\r\nBesides the primary and secondary sexual differences, such as the\r\nforegoing, the males and females of some animals differ in structures\r\nrelated to different habits of life, and not at all, or only\r\nindirectly, to the reproductive functions. Thus the females of certain\r\nflies (Culicidae and Tabanidae) are blood-suckers, whilst the males,\r\nliving on flowers, have mouths destitute of mandibles. (1. Westwood,\r\n‘Modern Classification of Insects,’ vol. ii. 1840, p. 541. For the\r\nstatement about Tanais, mentioned below, I am indebted to Fritz\r\nMuller.) The males of certain moths and of some crustaceans (e.g.\r\nTanais) have imperfect, closed mouths, and cannot feed. The\r\ncomplemental males of certain Cirripedes live like epiphytic plants\r\neither on the female or the hermaphrodite form, and are destitute of a\r\nmouth and of prehensile limbs. In these cases it is the male which has\r\nbeen modified, and has lost certain important organs, which the females\r\npossess. In other cases it is the female which has lost such parts; for\r\ninstance, the female glow-worm is destitute of wings, as also are many\r\nfemale moths, some of which never leave their cocoons. Many female\r\nparasitic crustaceans have lost their natatory legs. In some\r\nweevil-beetles (Curculionidae) there is a great difference between the\r\nmale and female in the length of the rostrum or snout (2. Kirby and\r\nSpence, ‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. iii. 1826, p. 309.); but the\r\nmeaning of this and of many analogous differences, is not at all\r\nunderstood. Differences of structure between the two sexes in relation\r\nto different habits of life are generally confined to the lower\r\nanimals; but with some few birds the beak of the male differs from that\r\nof the female. In the Huia of New Zealand the difference is wonderfully\r\ngreat, and we hear from Dr. Buller (3. ‘Birds of New Zealand,’ 1872, p.\r\n66.) that the male uses his strong beak in chiselling the larvae of\r\ninsects out of decayed wood, whilst the female probes the softer parts\r\nwith her far longer, much curved and pliant beak: and thus they\r\nmutually aid each other. In most cases, differences of structure\r\nbetween the sexes are more or less directly connected with the\r\npropagation of the species: thus a female, which has to nourish a\r\nmultitude of ova, requires more food than the male, and consequently\r\nrequires special means for procuring it. A male animal, which lives for\r\na very short time, might lose its organs for procuring food through\r\ndisuse, without detriment; but he would retain his locomotive organs in\r\na perfect state, so that he might reach the female. The female, on the\r\nother hand, might safely lose her organs for flying, swimming, or\r\nwalking, if she gradually acquired habits which rendered such powers\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, here concerned only with sexual selection. This\r\ndepends on the advantage which certain individuals have over others of\r\nthe same sex and species solely in respect of reproduction. When, as in\r\nthe cases above mentioned, the two sexes differ in structure in\r\nrelation to different habits of life, they have no doubt been modified\r\nthrough natural selection, and by inheritance limited to one and the\r\nsame sex. So again the primary sexual organs, and those for nourishing\r\nor protecting the young, come under the same influence; for those\r\nindividuals which generated or nourished their offspring best, would\r\nleave, ceteris paribus, the greatest number to inherit their\r\nsuperiority; whilst those which generated or nourished their offspring\r\nbadly, would leave but few to inherit their weaker powers. As the male\r\nhas to find the female, he requires organs of sense and locomotion, but\r\nif these organs are necessary for the other purposes of life, as is\r\ngenerally the case, they will have been developed through natural\r\nselection. When the male has found the female, he sometimes absolutely\r\nrequires prehensile organs to hold her; thus Dr. Wallace informs me\r\nthat the males of certain moths cannot unite with the females if their\r\ntarsi or feet are broken. The males of many oceanic crustaceans, when\r\nadult, have their legs and antennae modified in an extraordinary manner\r\nfor the prehension of the female; hence we may suspect that it is\r\nbecause these animals are washed about by the waves of the open sea,\r\nthat they require these organs in order to propagate their kind, and if\r\nso, their development has been the result of ordinary or natural\r\nselection. Some animals extremely low in the scale have been modified\r\nfor this same purpose; thus the males of certain parasitic worms, when\r\nfully grown, have the lower surface of the terminal part of their\r\nbodies roughened like a rasp, and with this they coil round and\r\npermanently hold the females. (4. M. Perrier advances this case (‘Revue\r\nScientifique,’ Feb. 1, 1873, p. 865) as one fatal to the belief in\r\nsexual election, inasmuch as he supposes that I attribute all the\r\ndifferences between the sexes to sexual selection. This distinguished\r\nnaturalist, therefore, like so many other Frenchmen, has not taken the\r\ntrouble to understand even the first principles of sexual selection. An\r\nEnglish naturalist insists that the claspers of certain male animals\r\ncould not have been developed through the choice of the female! Had I\r\nnot met with this remark, I should not have thought it possible for any\r\none to have read this chapter and to have imagined that I maintain that\r\nthe choice of the female had anything to do with the development of the\r\nprehensile organs in the male.)\r\n\r\nWhen the two sexes follow exactly the same habits of life, and the male\r\nhas the sensory or locomotive organs more highly developed than those\r\nof the female, it may be that the perfection of these is indispensable\r\nto the male for finding the female; but in the vast majority of cases,\r\nthey serve only to give one male an advantage over another, for with\r\nsufficient time, the less well-endowed males would succeed in pairing\r\nwith the females; and judging from the structure of the female, they\r\nwould be in all other respects equally well adapted for their ordinary\r\nhabits of life. Since in such cases the males have acquired their\r\npresent structure, not from being better fitted to survive in the\r\nstruggle for existence, but from having gained an advantage over other\r\nmales, and from having transmitted this advantage to their male\r\noffspring alone, sexual selection must here have come into action. It\r\nwas the importance of this distinction which led me to designate this\r\nform of selection as Sexual Selection. So again, if the chief service\r\nrendered to the male by his prehensile organs is to prevent the escape\r\nof the female before the arrival of other males, or when assaulted by\r\nthem, these organs will have been perfected through sexual selection,\r\nthat is by the advantage acquired by certain individuals over their\r\nrivals. But in most cases of this kind it is impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween the effects of natural and sexual selection. Whole chapters\r\ncould be filled with details on the differences between the sexes in\r\ntheir sensory, locomotive, and prehensile organs. As, however, these\r\nstructures are not more interesting than others adapted for the\r\nordinary purposes of life I shall pass them over almost entirely,\r\ngiving only a few instances under each class.\r\n\r\nThere are many other structures and instincts which must have been\r\ndeveloped through sexual selection—such as the weapons of offence and\r\nthe means of defence of the males for fighting with and driving away\r\ntheir rivals—their courage and pugnacity—their various ornaments—their\r\ncontrivances for producing vocal or instrumental music—and their glands\r\nfor emitting odours, most of these latter structures serving only to\r\nallure or excite the female. It is clear that these characters are the\r\nresult of sexual and not of ordinary selection, since unarmed,\r\nunornamented, or unattractive males would succeed equally well in the\r\nbattle for life and in leaving a numerous progeny, but for the presence\r\nof better endowed males. We may infer that this would be the case,\r\nbecause the females, which are unarmed and unornamented, are able to\r\nsurvive and procreate their kind. Secondary sexual characters of the\r\nkind just referred to, will be fully discussed in the following\r\nchapters, as being in many respects interesting, but especially as\r\ndepending on the will, choice, and rivalry of the individuals of either\r\nsex. When we behold two males fighting for the possession of the\r\nfemale, or several male birds displaying their gorgeous plumage, and\r\nperforming strange antics before an assembled body of females, we\r\ncannot doubt that, though led by instinct, they know what they are\r\nabout, and consciously exert their mental and bodily powers.\r\n\r\nJust as man can improve the breeds of his game-cocks by the selection\r\nof those birds which are victorious in the cockpit, so it appears that\r\nthe strongest and most vigorous males, or those provided with the best\r\nweapons, have prevailed under nature, and have led to the improvement\r\nof the natural breed or species. A slight degree of variability leading\r\nto some advantage, however slight, in reiterated deadly contests would\r\nsuffice for the work of sexual selection; and it is certain that\r\nsecondary sexual characters are eminently variable. Just as man can\r\ngive beauty, according to his standard of taste, to his male poultry,\r\nor more strictly can modify the beauty originally acquired by the\r\nparent species, can give to the Sebright bantam a new and elegant\r\nplumage, an erect and peculiar carriage—so it appears that female birds\r\nin a state of nature, have by a long selection of the more attractive\r\nmales, added to their beauty or other attractive qualities. No doubt\r\nthis implies powers of discrimination and taste on the part of the\r\nfemale which will at first appear extremely improbable; but by the\r\nfacts to be adduced hereafter, I hope to be able to shew that the\r\nfemales actually have these powers. When, however, it is said that the\r\nlower animals have a sense of beauty, it must not be supposed that such\r\nsense is comparable with that of a cultivated man, with his multiform\r\nand complex associated ideas. A more just comparison would be between\r\nthe taste for the beautiful in animals, and that in the lowest savages,\r\nwho admire and deck themselves with any brilliant, glittering, or\r\ncurious object.\r\n\r\nFrom our ignorance on several points, the precise manner in which\r\nsexual selection acts is somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless if those\r\nnaturalists who already believe in the mutability of species, will read\r\nthe following chapters, they will, I think, agree with me, that sexual\r\nselection has played an important part in the history of the organic\r\nworld. It is certain that amongst almost all animals there is a\r\nstruggle between the males for the possession of the female. This fact\r\nis so notorious that it would be superfluous to give instances. Hence\r\nthe females have the opportunity of selecting one out of several males,\r\non the supposition that their mental capacity suffices for the exertion\r\nof a choice. In many cases special circumstances tend to make the\r\nstruggle between the males particularly severe. Thus the males of our\r\nmigratory birds generally arrive at their places of breeding before the\r\nfemales, so that many males are ready to contend for each female. I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Jenner Weir, that the bird-catchers assert that this is\r\ninvariably the case with the nightingale and blackcap, and with respect\r\nto the latter he can himself confirm the statement.\r\n\r\nMr. Swaysland of Brighton has been in the habit, during the last forty\r\nyears, of catching our migratory birds on their first arrival, and he\r\nhas never known the females of any species to arrive before their\r\nmales. During one spring he shot thirty-nine males of Ray’s wagtail\r\n(Budytes Raii) before he saw a single female. Mr. Gould has ascertained\r\nby the dissection of those snipes which arrive the first in this\r\ncountry, that the males come before the females. And the like holds\r\ngood with most of the migratory birds of the United States. (5. J.A.\r\nAllen, on the ‘Mammals and Winter Birds of Florida,’ Bulletin of\r\nComparative Zoology, Harvard College, p. 268.) The majority of the male\r\nsalmon in our rivers, on coming up from the sea, are ready to breed\r\nbefore the females. So it appears to be with frogs and toads.\r\nThroughout the great class of insects the males almost always are the\r\nfirst to emerge from the pupal state, so that they generally abound for\r\na time before any females can be seen. (6. Even with those plants in\r\nwhich the sexes are separate, the male flowers are generally mature\r\nbefore the female. As first shewn by C.K. Sprengel, many hermaphrodite\r\nplants are dichogamous; that is, their male and female organs are not\r\nready at the same time, so that they cannot be self-fertilised. Now in\r\nsuch flowers, the pollen is in general matured before the stigma,\r\nthough there are exceptional cases in which the female organs are\r\nbeforehand.) The cause of this difference between the males and females\r\nin their periods of arrival and maturity is sufficiently obvious. Those\r\nmales which annually first migrated into any country, or which in the\r\nspring were first ready to breed, or were the most eager, would leave\r\nthe largest number of offspring; and these would tend to inherit\r\nsimilar instincts and constitutions. It must be borne in mind that it\r\nwould have been impossible to change very materially the time of sexual\r\nmaturity in the females, without at the same time interfering with the\r\nperiod of the production of the young—a period which must be determined\r\nby the seasons of the year. On the whole there can be no doubt that\r\nwith almost all animals, in which the sexes are separate, there is a\r\nconstantly recurrent struggle between the males for the possession of\r\nthe females.\r\n\r\nOur difficulty in regard to sexual selection lies in understanding how\r\nit is that the males which conquer other males, or those which prove\r\nthe most attractive to the females, leave a greater number of offspring\r\nto inherit their superiority than their beaten and less attractive\r\nrivals. Unless this result does follow, the characters which give to\r\ncertain males an advantage over others, could not be perfected and\r\naugmented through sexual selection. When the sexes exist in exactly\r\nequal numbers, the worst-endowed males will (except where polygamy\r\nprevails), ultimately find females, and leave as many offspring, as\r\nwell fitted for their general habits of life, as the best-endowed\r\nmales. From various facts and considerations, I formerly inferred that\r\nwith most animals, in which secondary sexual characters are well\r\ndeveloped, the males considerably exceeded the females in number; but\r\nthis is not by any means always true. If the males were to the females\r\nas two to one, or as three to two, or even in a somewhat lower ratio,\r\nthe whole affair would be simple; for the better-armed or more\r\nattractive males would leave the largest number of offspring. But after\r\ninvestigating, as far as possible, the numerical proportion of the\r\nsexes, I do not believe that any great inequality in number commonly\r\nexists. In most cases sexual selection appears to have been effective\r\nin the following manner.\r\n\r\nLet us take any species, a bird for instance, and divide the females\r\ninhabiting a district into two equal bodies, the one consisting of the\r\nmore vigorous and better-nourished individuals, and the other of the\r\nless vigorous and healthy. The former, there can be little doubt, would\r\nbe ready to breed in the spring before the others; and this is the\r\nopinion of Mr. Jenner Weir, who has carefully attended to the habits of\r\nbirds during many years. There can also be no doubt that the most\r\nvigorous, best-nourished and earliest breeders would on an average\r\nsucceed in rearing the largest number of fine offspring. (7. Here is\r\nexcellent evidence on the character of the offspring from an\r\nexperienced ornithologist. Mr. J.A. Allen, in speaking (‘Mammals and\r\nWinter Birds of E. Florida,’ p. 229) of the later broods, after the\r\naccidental destruction of the first, says, that these “are found to be\r\nsmaller and paler-coloured than those hatched earlier in the season. In\r\ncases where several broods are reared each year, as a general rule the\r\nbirds of the earlier broods seem in all respects the most perfect and\r\nvigorous.”) The males, as we have seen, are generally ready to breed\r\nbefore the females; the strongest, and with some species the best armed\r\nof the males, drive away the weaker; and the former would then unite\r\nwith the more vigorous and better-nourished females, because they are\r\nthe first to breed. (8. Hermann Müller has come to this same conclusion\r\nwith respect to those female bees which are the first to emerge from\r\nthe pupa each year. See his remarkable essay, ‘Anwendung der\r\nDarwin’schen Lehre auf Bienen,’ ‘Verh. d. V. Jahrg.’ xxix. p. 45.) Such\r\nvigorous pairs would surely rear a larger number of offspring than the\r\nretarded females, which would be compelled to unite with the conquered\r\nand less powerful males, supposing the sexes to be numerically equal;\r\nand this is all that is wanted to add, in the course of successive\r\ngenerations, to the size, strength and courage of the males, or to\r\nimprove their weapons.\r\n\r\nBut in very many cases the males which conquer their rivals, do not\r\nobtain possession of the females, independently of the choice of the\r\nlatter. The courtship of animals is by no means so simple and short an\r\naffair as might be thought. The females are most excited by, or prefer\r\npairing with, the more ornamented males, or those which are the best\r\nsongsters, or play the best antics; but it is obviously probable that\r\nthey would at the same time prefer the more vigorous and lively males,\r\nand this has in some cases been confirmed by actual observation. (9.\r\nWith respect to poultry, I have received information, hereafter to be\r\ngiven, to this effect. Even with birds, such as pigeons, which pair for\r\nlife, the female, as I hear from Mr. Jenner Weir, will desert her mate\r\nif he is injured or grows weak.) Thus the more vigorous females, which\r\nare the first to breed, will have the choice of many males; and though\r\nthey may not always select the strongest or best armed, they will\r\nselect those which are vigorous and well armed, and in other respects\r\nthe most attractive. Both sexes, therefore, of such early pairs would\r\nas above explained, have an advantage over others in rearing offspring;\r\nand this apparently has sufficed during a long course of generations to\r\nadd not only to the strength and fighting powers of the males, but\r\nlikewise to their various ornaments or other attractions.\r\n\r\nIn the converse and much rarer case of the males selecting particular\r\nfemales, it is plain that those which were the most vigorous and had\r\nconquered others, would have the freest choice; and it is almost\r\ncertain that they would select vigorous as well as attractive females.\r\nSuch pairs would have an advantage in rearing offspring, more\r\nespecially if the male had the power to defend the female during the\r\npairing-season as occurs with some of the higher animals, or aided her\r\nin providing for the young. The same principles would apply if each sex\r\npreferred and selected certain individuals of the opposite sex;\r\nsupposing that they selected not only the more attractive, but likewise\r\nthe more vigorous individuals.\r\n\r\nNUMERICAL PROPORTION OF THE TWO SEXES.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that sexual selection would be a simple affair if the\r\nmales were considerably more numerous than the females. Hence I was led\r\nto investigate, as far as I could, the proportions between the two\r\nsexes of as many animals as possible; but the materials are scanty. I\r\nwill here give only a brief abstract of the results, retaining the\r\ndetails for a supplementary discussion, so as not to interfere with the\r\ncourse of my argument. Domesticated animals alone afford the means of\r\nascertaining the proportional numbers at birth; but no records have\r\nbeen specially kept for this purpose. By indirect means, however, I\r\nhave collected a considerable body of statistics, from which it appears\r\nthat with most of our domestic animals the sexes are nearly equal at\r\nbirth. Thus 25,560 births of race-horses have been recorded during\r\ntwenty-one years, and the male births were to the female births as 99.7\r\nto 100. In greyhounds the inequality is greater than with any other\r\nanimal, for out of 6878 births during twelve years, the male births\r\nwere to the female as 110.1 to 100. It is, however, in some degree\r\ndoubtful whether it is safe to infer that the proportion would be the\r\nsame under natural conditions as under domestication; for slight and\r\nunknown differences in the conditions affect the proportion of the\r\nsexes. Thus with mankind, the male births in England are as 104.5, in\r\nRussia as 108.9, and with the Jews of Livonia as 120, to 100 female\r\nbirths. But I shall recur to this curious point of the excess of male\r\nbirths in the supplement to this chapter. At the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nhowever, male children of European extraction have been born during\r\nseveral years in the proportion of between 90 and 99 to 100 female\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose we are concerned with the proportions of the\r\nsexes, not only at birth, but also at maturity, and this adds another\r\nelement of doubt; for it is a well-ascertained fact that with man the\r\nnumber of males dying before or during birth, and during the first two\r\nyears of infancy, is considerably larger than that of females. So it\r\nalmost certainly is with male lambs, and probably with some other\r\nanimals. The males of some species kill one another by fighting; or\r\nthey drive one another about until they become greatly emaciated. They\r\nmust also be often exposed to various dangers, whilst wandering about\r\nin eager search for the females. In many kinds of fish the males are\r\nmuch smaller than the females, and they are believed often to be\r\ndevoured by the latter, or by other fishes. The females of some birds\r\nappear to die earlier than the males; they are also liable to be\r\ndestroyed on their nests, or whilst in charge of their young. With\r\ninsects the female larvae are often larger than those of the males, and\r\nwould consequently be more likely to be devoured. In some cases the\r\nmature females are less active and less rapid in their movements than\r\nthe males, and could not escape so well from danger. Hence, with\r\nanimals in a state of nature, we must rely on mere estimation, in order\r\nto judge of the proportions of the sexes at maturity; and this is but\r\nlittle trustworthy, except when the inequality is strongly marked.\r\nNevertheless, as far as a judgment can be formed, we may conclude from\r\nthe facts given in the supplement, that the males of some few mammals,\r\nof many birds, of some fish and insects, are considerably more numerous\r\nthan the females.\r\n\r\nThe proportion between the sexes fluctuates slightly during successive\r\nyears: thus with race-horses, for every 100 mares born the stallions\r\nvaried from 107.1 in one year to 92.6 in another year, and with\r\ngreyhounds from 116.3 to 95.3. But had larger numbers been tabulated\r\nthroughout an area more extensive than England, these fluctuations\r\nwould probably have disappeared; and such as they are, would hardly\r\nsuffice to lead to effective sexual selection in a state of nature.\r\nNevertheless, in the cases of some few wild animals, as shewn in the\r\nsupplement, the proportions seem to fluctuate either during different\r\nseasons or in different localities in a sufficient degree to lead to\r\nsuch selection. For it should be observed that any advantage, gained\r\nduring certain years or in certain localities by those males which were\r\nable to conquer their rivals, or were the most attractive to the\r\nfemales, would probably be transmitted to the offspring, and would not\r\nsubsequently be eliminated. During the succeeding seasons, when, from\r\nthe equality of the sexes, every male was able to procure a female, the\r\nstronger or more attractive males previously produced would still have\r\nat least as good a chance of leaving offspring as the weaker or less\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nPOLYGAMY.\r\n\r\nThe practice of polygamy leads to the same results as would follow from\r\nan actual inequality in the number of the sexes; for if each male\r\nsecures two or more females, many males cannot pair; and the latter\r\nassuredly will be the weaker or less attractive individuals. Many\r\nmammals and some few birds are polygamous, but with animals belonging\r\nto the lower classes I have found no evidence of this habit. The\r\nintellectual powers of such animals are, perhaps, not sufficient to\r\nlead them to collect and guard a harem of females. That some relation\r\nexists between polygamy and the development of secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, appears nearly certain; and this supports the view that a\r\nnumerical preponderance of males would be eminently favourable to the\r\naction of sexual selection. Nevertheless many animals, which are\r\nstrictly monogamous, especially birds, display strongly-marked\r\nsecondary sexual characters; whilst some few animals, which are\r\npolygamous, do not have such characters.\r\n\r\nWe will first briefly run through the mammals, and then turn to birds.\r\nThe gorilla seems to be polygamous, and the male differs considerably\r\nfrom the female; so it is with some baboons, which live in herds\r\ncontaining twice as many adult females as males. In South America the\r\nMycetes caraya presents well-marked sexual differences, in colour,\r\nbeard, and vocal organs; and the male generally lives with two or three\r\nwives: the male of the Cebus capucinus differs somewhat from the\r\nfemale, and appears to be polygamous. (10. On the Gorilla, Savage and\r\nWyman, ‘Boston Journal of Natural History,’ vol. v. 1845-47, p. 423. On\r\nCynocephalus, Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. i. 1864, s. 77. On Mycetes,\r\nRengger, ‘Naturgeschichte der Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ 1830, ss. 14,\r\n20. On Cebus, Brehm, ibid. s. 108.) Little is known on this head with\r\nrespect to most other monkeys, but some species are strictly\r\nmonogamous. The ruminants are eminently polygamous, and they present\r\nsexual differences more frequently than almost any other group of\r\nmammals; this holds good, especially in their weapons, but also in\r\nother characters. Most deer, cattle, and sheep are polygamous; as are\r\nmost antelopes, though some are monogamous. Sir Andrew Smith, in\r\nspeaking of the antelopes of South Africa, says that in herds of about\r\na dozen there was rarely more than one mature male. The Asiatic\r\nAntilope saiga appears to be the most inordinate polygamist in the\r\nworld; for Pallas (11. Pallas, ‘Spicilegia Zoolog., Fasc.’ xii. 1777,\r\np. 29. Sir Andrew Smith, ‘Illustrations of the Zoology of S. Africa,’\r\n1849, pl. 29, on the Kobus. Owen, in his ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates’ (vol.\r\niii. 1868, p. 633) gives a table shewing incidentally which species of\r\nantelopes are gregarious.) states that the male drives away all rivals,\r\nand collects a herd of about a hundred females and kids together; the\r\nfemale is hornless and has softer hair, but does not otherwise differ\r\nmuch from the male. The wild horse of the Falkland Islands and of the\r\nWestern States of N. America is polygamous, but, except in his greater\r\nsize and in the proportions of his body, differs but little from the\r\nmare. The wild boar presents well-marked sexual characters, in his\r\ngreat tusks and some other points. In Europe and in India he leads a\r\nsolitary life, except during the breeding-season; but as is believed by\r\nSir W. Elliot, who has had many opportunities in India of observing\r\nthis animal, he consorts at this season with several females. Whether\r\nthis holds good in Europe is doubtful, but it is supported by some\r\nevidence. The adult male Indian elephant, like the boar, passes much of\r\nhis time in solitude; but as Dr. Campbell states, when with others, “It\r\nis rare to find more than one male with a whole herd of females”; the\r\nlarger males expelling or killing the smaller and weaker ones. The male\r\ndiffers from the female in his immense tusks, greater size, strength,\r\nand endurance; so great is the difference in these respects that the\r\nmales when caught are valued at one-fifth more than the females. (12.\r\nDr. Campbell, in ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1869, p. 138. See also an\r\ninteresting paper by Lieut. Johnstone, in ‘Proceedings, Asiatic Society\r\nof Bengal,’ May 1868.) The sexes of other pachydermatous animals differ\r\nvery little or not at all, and, as far as known, they are not\r\npolygamists. Nor have I heard of any species in the Orders of\r\nCheiroptera, Edentata, Insectivora and Rodents being polygamous,\r\nexcepting that amongst the Rodents, the common rat, according to some\r\nrat-catchers, lives with several females. Nevertheless the two sexes of\r\nsome sloths (Edentata) differ in the character and colour of certain\r\npatches of hair on their shoulders. (13. Dr. Gray, in ‘Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History,’ 1871, p. 302.) And many kinds of bats\r\n(Cheiroptera) present well-marked sexual differences, chiefly in the\r\nmales possessing odoriferous glands and pouches, and by their being of\r\na lighter colour. (14. See Dr. Dobson’s excellent paper in ‘Proceedings\r\nof the Zoological Society,’ 1873, p. 241.) In the great order of\r\nRodents, as far as I can learn, the sexes rarely differ, and when they\r\ndo so, it is but slightly in the tint of the fur.\r\n\r\nAs I hear from Sir Andrew Smith, the lion in South Africa sometimes\r\nlives with a single female, but generally with more, and, in one case,\r\nwas found with as many as five females; so that he is polygamous. As\r\nfar as I can discover, he is the only polygamist amongst all the\r\nterrestrial Carnivora, and he alone presents well-marked sexual\r\ncharacters. If, however, we turn to the marine Carnivora, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, the case is widely different; for many species of seals\r\noffer extraordinary sexual differences, and they are eminently\r\npolygamous. Thus, according to Peron, the male sea-elephant of the\r\nSouthern Ocean always possesses several females, and the sea-lion of\r\nForster is said to be surrounded by from twenty to thirty females. In\r\nthe North, the male sea-bear of Steller is accompanied by even a\r\ngreater number of females. It is an interesting fact, as Dr. Gill\r\nremarks (15. ‘The Eared Seals,’ American Naturalist, vol. iv. Jan.\r\n1871.), that in the monogamous species, “or those living in small\r\ncommunities, there is little difference in size between the males and\r\nfemales; in the social species, or rather those of which the males have\r\nharems, the males are vastly larger than the females.”\r\n\r\nAmongst birds, many species, the sexes of which differ greatly from\r\neach other, are certainly monogamous. In Great Britain we see\r\nwell-marked sexual differences, for instance, in the wild-duck which\r\npairs with a single female, the common blackbird, and the bullfinch\r\nwhich is said to pair for life. I am informed by Mr. Wallace that the\r\nlike is true of the Chatterers or Cotingidae of South America, and of\r\nmany other birds. In several groups I have not been able to discover\r\nwhether the species are polygamous or monogamous. Lesson says that\r\nbirds of paradise, so remarkable for their sexual differences, are\r\npolygamous, but Mr. Wallace doubts whether he had sufficient evidence.\r\nMr. Salvin tells me he has been led to believe that humming-birds are\r\npolygamous. The male widow-bird, remarkable for his caudal plumes,\r\ncertainly seems to be a polygamist. (16. ‘The Ibis,’ vol. iii. 1861, p.\r\n133, on the Progne Widow-bird. See also on the Vidua axillaris, ibid.\r\nvol. ii. 1860, p. 211. On the polygamy of the Capercailzie and Great\r\nBustard, see L. Lloyd, ‘Game Birds of Sweden,’ 1867, pp. 19, and 182.\r\nMontagu and Selby speak of the Black Grouse as polygamous and of the\r\nRed Grouse as monogamous.) I have been assured by Mr. Jenner Weir and\r\nby others, that it is somewhat common for three starlings to frequent\r\nthe same nest; but whether this is a case of polygamy or polyandry has\r\nnot been ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe Gallinaceae exhibit almost as strongly marked sexual differences as\r\nbirds of paradise or humming-birds, and many of the species are, as is\r\nwell known, polygamous; others being strictly monogamous. What a\r\ncontrast is presented between the sexes of the polygamous peacock or\r\npheasant, and the monogamous guinea-fowl or partridge! Many similar\r\ncases could be given, as in the grouse tribe, in which the males of the\r\npolygamous capercailzie and black-cock differ greatly from the females;\r\nwhilst the sexes of the monogamous red grouse and ptarmigan differ very\r\nlittle. In the Cursores, except amongst the bustards, few species offer\r\nstrongly-marked sexual differences, and the great bustard (Otis tarda)\r\nis said to be polygamous. With the Grallatores, extremely few species\r\ndiffer sexually, but the ruff (Machetes pugnax) affords a marked\r\nexception, and this species is believed by Montagu to be a polygamist.\r\nHence it appears that amongst birds there often exists a close relation\r\nbetween polygamy and the development of strongly-marked sexual\r\ndifferences. I asked Mr. Bartlett, of the Zoological Gardens, who has\r\nhad very large experience with birds, whether the male tragopan (one of\r\nthe Gallinaceae) was polygamous, and I was struck by his answering, “I\r\ndo not know, but should think so from his splendid colours.”\r\n\r\nIt deserves notice that the instinct of pairing with a single female is\r\neasily lost under domestication. The wild-duck is strictly monogamous,\r\nthe domestic-duck highly polygamous. The Rev. W.D. Fox informs me that\r\nout of some half-tamed wild-ducks, on a large pond in his\r\nneighbourhood, so many mallards were shot by the gamekeeper that only\r\none was left for every seven or eight females; yet unusually large\r\nbroods were reared. The guinea-fowl is strictly monogamous; but Mr. Fox\r\nfinds that his birds succeed best when he keeps one cock to two or\r\nthree hens. Canary-birds pair in a state of nature, but the breeders in\r\nEngland successfully put one male to four or five females. I have\r\nnoticed these cases, as rendering it probable that wild monogamous\r\nspecies might readily become either temporarily or permanently\r\npolygamous.\r\n\r\nToo little is known of the habits of reptiles and fishes to enable us\r\nto speak of their marriage arrangements. The stickle-back\r\n(Gasterosteus), however, is said to be a polygamist (17. Noel\r\nHumphreys, ‘River Gardens,’ 1857.); and the male during the\r\nbreeding-season differs conspicuously from the female.\r\n\r\nTo sum up on the means through which, as far as we can judge, sexual\r\nselection has led to the development of secondary sexual characters. It\r\nhas been shewn that the largest number of vigorous offspring will be\r\nreared from the pairing of the strongest and best-armed males,\r\nvictorious in contests over other males, with the most vigorous and\r\nbest-nourished females, which are the first to breed in the spring. If\r\nsuch females select the more attractive, and at the same time vigorous\r\nmales, they will rear a larger number of offspring than the retarded\r\nfemales, which must pair with the less vigorous and less attractive\r\nmales. So it will be if the more vigorous males select the more\r\nattractive and at the same time healthy and vigorous females; and this\r\nwill especially hold good if the male defends the female, and aids in\r\nproviding food for the young. The advantage thus gained by the more\r\nvigorous pairs in rearing a larger number of offspring has apparently\r\nsufficed to render sexual selection efficient. But a large numerical\r\npreponderance of males over females will be still more efficient;\r\nwhether the preponderance is only occasional and local, or permanent;\r\nwhether it occurs at birth, or afterwards from the greater destruction\r\nof the females; or whether it indirectly follows from the practice of\r\npolygamy.\r\n\r\nTHE MALE GENERALLY MORE MODIFIED THAN THE FEMALE.\r\n\r\nThroughout the animal kingdom, when the sexes differ in external\r\nappearance, it is, with rare exceptions, the male which has been the\r\nmore modified; for, generally, the female retains a closer resemblance\r\nto the young of her own species, and to other adult members of the same\r\ngroup. The cause of this seems to lie in the males of almost all\r\nanimals having stronger passions than the females. Hence it is the\r\nmales that fight together and sedulously display their charms before\r\nthe females; and the victors transmit their superiority to their male\r\noffspring. Why both sexes do not thus acquire the characters of their\r\nfathers, will be considered hereafter. That the males of all mammals\r\neagerly pursue the females is notorious to every one. So it is with\r\nbirds; but many cock birds do not so much pursue the hen, as display\r\ntheir plumage, perform strange antics, and pour forth their song in her\r\npresence. The male in the few fish observed seems much more eager than\r\nthe female; and the same is true of alligators, and apparently of\r\nBatrachians. Throughout the enormous class of insects, as Kirby\r\nremarks, “the law is that the male shall seek the female.” (18. Kirby\r\nand Spence, ‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. iii. 1826, p. 342.) Two\r\ngood authorities, Mr. Blackwall and Mr. C. Spence Bate, tell me that\r\nthe males of spiders and crustaceans are more active and more erratic\r\nin their habits than the females. When the organs of sense or\r\nlocomotion are present in the one sex of insects and crustaceans and\r\nabsent in the other, or when, as is frequently the case, they are more\r\nhighly developed in the one than in the other, it is, as far as I can\r\ndiscover, almost invariably the male which retains such organs, or has\r\nthem most developed; and this shews that the male is the more active\r\nmember in the courtship of the sexes. (19. One parasitic Hymenopterous\r\ninsect (Westwood, ‘Modern Class. of Insects,’ vol. ii. p. 160) forms an\r\nexception to the rule, as the male has rudimentary wings, and never\r\nquits the cell in which it is born, whilst the female has\r\nwell-developed wings. Audouin believes that the females of this species\r\nare impregnated by the males which are born in the same cells with\r\nthem; but it is much more probable that the females visit other cells,\r\nso that close inter-breeding is thus avoided. We shall hereafter meet\r\nin various classes, with a few exceptional cases, in which the female,\r\ninstead of the male, is the seeker and wooer.)\r\n\r\nThe female, on the other hand, with the rarest exceptions, is less\r\neager than the male. As the illustrious Hunter (20. ‘Essays and\r\nObservations,’ edited by Owen, vol. i. 1861, p. 194.) long ago\r\nobserved, she generally “requires to be courted;” she is coy, and may\r\noften be seen endeavouring for a long time to escape from the male.\r\nEvery observer of the habits of animals will be able to call to mind\r\ninstances of this kind. It is shewn by various facts, given hereafter,\r\nand by the results fairly attributable to sexual selection, that the\r\nfemale, though comparatively passive, generally exerts some choice and\r\naccepts one male in preference to others. Or she may accept, as\r\nappearances would sometimes lead us to believe, not the male which is\r\nthe most attractive to her, but the one which is the least distasteful.\r\nThe exertion of some choice on the part of the female seems a law\r\nalmost as general as the eagerness of the male.\r\n\r\nWe are naturally led to enquire why the male, in so many and such\r\ndistinct classes, has become more eager than the female, so that he\r\nsearches for her, and plays the more active part in courtship. It would\r\nbe no advantage and some loss of power if each sex searched for the\r\nother; but why should the male almost always be the seeker? The ovules\r\nof plants after fertilisation have to be nourished for a time; hence\r\nthe pollen is necessarily brought to the female organs—being placed on\r\nthe stigma, by means of insects or the wind, or by the spontaneous\r\nmovements of the stamens; and in the Algae, etc., by the locomotive\r\npower of the antherozooids. With lowly-organised aquatic animals,\r\npermanently affixed to the same spot and having their sexes separate,\r\nthe male element is invariably brought to the female; and of this we\r\ncan see the reason, for even if the ova were detached before\r\nfertilisation, and did not require subsequent nourishment or\r\nprotection, there would yet be greater difficulty in transporting them\r\nthan the male element, because, being larger than the latter, they are\r\nproduced in far smaller numbers. So that many of the lower animals are,\r\nin this respect, analogous with plants. (21. Prof. Sachs (‘Lehrbuch der\r\nBotanik,’ 1870, S. 633) in speaking of the male and female reproductive\r\ncells, remarks, “verhält sich die eine bei der Vereinigung activ,...die\r\nandere erscheint bei der Vereinigung passiv.”) The males of affixed and\r\naquatic animals having been led to emit their fertilising element in\r\nthis way, it is natural that any of their descendants, which rose in\r\nthe scale and became locomotive, should retain the same habit; and they\r\nwould approach the female as closely as possible, in order not to risk\r\nthe loss of the fertilising element in a long passage of it through the\r\nwater. With some few of the lower animals, the females alone are fixed,\r\nand the males of these must be the seekers. But it is difficult to\r\nunderstand why the males of species, of which the progenitors were\r\nprimordially free, should invariably have acquired the habit of\r\napproaching the females, instead of being approached by them. But in\r\nall cases, in order that the males should seek efficiently, it would be\r\nnecessary that they should be endowed with strong passions; and the\r\nacquirement of such passions would naturally follow from the more eager\r\nleaving a larger number of offspring than the less eager.\r\n\r\nThe great eagerness of the males has thus indirectly led to their much\r\nmore frequently developing secondary sexual characters than the\r\nfemales. But the development of such characters would be much aided, if\r\nthe males were more liable to vary than the females—as I concluded they\r\nwere—after a long study of domesticated animals. Von Nathusius, who has\r\nhad very wide experience, is strongly of the same opinion. (22.\r\n‘Vorträge uber Viehzucht,’ 1872, p. 63.) Good evidence also in favour\r\nof this conclusion can be produced by a comparison of the two sexes in\r\nmankind. During the Novara Expedition (23. ‘Reise der Novara:\r\nAnthropolog. Theil,’ 1867, ss. 216-269. The results were calculated by\r\nDr. Weisbach from measurements made by Drs. K. Scherzer and Schwarz. On\r\nthe greater variability of the males of domesticated animals, see my\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. 1868,\r\np. 75.) a vast number of measurements was made of various parts of the\r\nbody in different races, and the men were found in almost every case to\r\npresent a greater range of variation than the women; but I shall have\r\nto recur to this subject in a future chapter. Mr. J. Wood (24.\r\n‘Proceedings of the Royal Society,’ vol. xvi. July 1868, pp. 519 and\r\n524.), who has carefully attended to the variation of the muscles in\r\nman, puts in italics the conclusion that “the greatest number of\r\nabnormalities in each subject is found in the males.” He had previously\r\nremarked that “altogether in 102 subjects, the varieties of redundancy\r\nwere found to be half as many again as in females, contrasting widely\r\nwith the greater frequency of deficiency in females before described.”\r\nProfessor Macalister likewise remarks (25. ‘Proc. Royal Irish Academy,’\r\nvol. x. 1868, p. 123.) that variations in the muscles “are probably\r\nmore common in males than females.” Certain muscles which are not\r\nnormally present in mankind are also more frequently developed in the\r\nmale than in the female sex, although exceptions to this rule are said\r\nto occur. Dr. Burt Wilder (26. ‘Massachusetts Medical Society,’ vol.\r\nii. No. 3, 1868, p. 9.) has tabulated the cases of 152 individuals with\r\nsupernumerary digits, of which 86 were males, and 39, or less than\r\nhalf, females, the remaining 27 being of unknown sex. It should not,\r\nhowever, be overlooked that women would more frequently endeavour to\r\nconceal a deformity of this kind than men. Again, Dr. L. Meyer asserts\r\nthat the ears of man are more variable in form than those of a woman.\r\n(27. ‘Archiv fur Path. Anat. und Phys.’ 1871, p. 488.) Lastly the\r\ntemperature is more variable in man than in woman. (28. The conclusions\r\nrecently arrived at by Dr. J. Stockton Hough, on the temperature of\r\nman, are given in the ‘Pop. Sci. Review,’ Jan. 1st, 1874, p. 97.)\r\n\r\nThe cause of the greater general variability in the male sex, than in\r\nthe female is unknown, except in so far as secondary sexual characters\r\nare extraordinarily variable, and are usually confined to the males;\r\nand, as we shall presently see, this fact is, to a certain extent,\r\nintelligible. Through the action of sexual and natural selection male\r\nanimals have been rendered in very many instances widely different from\r\ntheir females; but independently of selection the two sexes, from\r\ndiffering constitutionally, tend to vary in a somewhat different\r\nmanner. The female has to expend much organic matter in the formation\r\nof her ova, whereas the male expends much force in fierce contests with\r\nhis rivals, in wandering about in search of the female, in exerting his\r\nvoice, pouring out odoriferous secretions, etc.: and this expenditure\r\nis generally concentrated within a short period. The great vigour of\r\nthe male during the season of love seems often to intensify his\r\ncolours, independently of any marked difference from the female. (29.\r\nProf. Mantegazza is inclined to believe (‘Lettera a Carlo Darwin,’\r\n‘Archivio per l’Anthropologia,’ 1871, p. 306) that the bright colours,\r\ncommon in so many male animals, are due to the presence and retention\r\nby them of the spermatic fluid; but this can hardly be the case; for\r\nmany male birds, for instance young pheasants, become brightly coloured\r\nin the autumn of their first year.) In mankind, and even as low down in\r\nthe organic scale as in the Lepidoptera, the temperature of the body is\r\nhigher in the male than in the female, accompanied in the case of man\r\nby a slower pulse. (30. For mankind, see Dr. J. Stockton Hough, whose\r\nconclusions are given in the ‘Popular Science Review,’ 1874, p. 97. See\r\nGirard’s observations on the Lepidoptera, as given in the ‘Zoological\r\nRecord,’ 1869, p. 347.) On the whole the expenditure of matter and\r\nforce by the two sexes is probably nearly equal, though effected in\r\nvery different ways and at different rates.\r\n\r\nFrom the causes just specified the two sexes can hardly fail to differ\r\nsomewhat in constitution, at least during the breeding-season; and,\r\nalthough they may be subjected to exactly the same conditions, they\r\nwill tend to vary in a different manner. If such variations are of no\r\nservice to either sex, they will not be accumulated and increased by\r\nsexual or natural selection. Nevertheless, they may become permanent if\r\nthe exciting cause acts permanently; and in accordance with a frequent\r\nform of inheritance they may be transmitted to that sex alone in which\r\nthey first appeared. In this case the two sexes will come to present\r\npermanent, yet unimportant, differences of character. For instance, Mr.\r\nAllen shews that with a large number of birds inhabiting the northern\r\nand southern United States, the specimens from the south are\r\ndarker-coloured than those from the north; and this seems to be the\r\ndirect result of the difference in temperature, light, etc., between\r\nthe two regions. Now, in some few cases, the two sexes of the same\r\nspecies appear to have been differently affected; in the Agelaeus\r\nphoeniceus the males have had their colours greatly intensified in the\r\nsouth; whereas with Cardinalis virginianus it is the females which have\r\nbeen thus affected; with Quiscalus major the females have been rendered\r\nextremely variable in tint, whilst the males remain nearly uniform.\r\n(31. ‘Mammals and Birds of E. Florida,’ pp. 234, 280, 295.)\r\n\r\nA few exceptional cases occur in various classes of animals, in which\r\nthe females instead of the males have acquired well pronounced\r\nsecondary sexual characters, such as brighter colours, greater size,\r\nstrength, or pugnacity. With birds there has sometimes been a complete\r\ntransposition of the ordinary characters proper to each sex; the\r\nfemales having become the more eager in courtship, the males remaining\r\ncomparatively passive, but apparently selecting the more attractive\r\nfemales, as we may infer from the results. Certain hen birds have thus\r\nbeen rendered more highly coloured or otherwise ornamented, as well as\r\nmore powerful and pugnacious than the cocks; these characters being\r\ntransmitted to the female offspring alone.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that in some cases a double process of selection\r\nhas been carried on; that the males have selected the more attractive\r\nfemales, and the latter the more attractive males. This process,\r\nhowever, though it might lead to the modification of both sexes, would\r\nnot make the one sex different from the other, unless indeed their\r\ntastes for the beautiful differed; but this is a supposition too\r\nimprobable to be worth considering in the case of any animal, excepting\r\nman. There are, however, many animals in which the sexes resemble each\r\nother, both being furnished with the same ornaments, which analogy\r\nwould lead us to attribute to the agency of sexual selection. In such\r\ncases it may be suggested with more plausibility, that there has been a\r\ndouble or mutual process of sexual selection; the more vigorous and\r\nprecocious females selecting the more attractive and vigorous males,\r\nthe latter rejecting all except the more attractive females. But from\r\nwhat we know of the habits of animals, this view is hardly probable,\r\nfor the male is generally eager to pair with any female. It is more\r\nprobable that the ornaments common to both sexes were acquired by one\r\nsex, generally the male, and then transmitted to the offspring of both\r\nsexes. If, indeed, during a lengthened period the males of any species\r\nwere greatly to exceed the females in number, and then during another\r\nlengthened period, but under different conditions, the reverse were to\r\noccur, a double, but not simultaneous, process of sexual selection\r\nmight easily be carried on, by which the two sexes might be rendered\r\nwidely different.\r\n\r\nWe shall hereafter see that many animals exist, of which neither sex is\r\nbrilliantly coloured or provided with special ornaments, and yet the\r\nmembers of both sexes or of one alone have probably acquired simple\r\ncolours, such as white or black, through sexual selection. The absence\r\nof bright tints or other ornaments may be the result of variations of\r\nthe right kind never having occurred, or of the animals themselves\r\nhaving preferred plain black or white. Obscure tints have often been\r\ndeveloped through natural selection for the sake of protection, and the\r\nacquirement through sexual selection of conspicuous colours, appears to\r\nhave been sometimes checked from the danger thus incurred. But in other\r\ncases the males during long ages may have struggled together for the\r\npossession of the females, and yet no effect will have been produced,\r\nunless a larger number of offspring were left by the more successful\r\nmales to inherit their superiority, than by the less successful: and\r\nthis, as previously shewn, depends on many complex contingencies.\r\n\r\nSexual selection acts in a less rigorous manner than natural selection.\r\nThe latter produces its effects by the life or death at all ages of the\r\nmore or less successful individuals. Death, indeed, not rarely ensues\r\nfrom the conflicts of rival males. But generally the less successful\r\nmale merely fails to obtain a female, or obtains a retarded and less\r\nvigorous female later in the season, or, if polygamous, obtains fewer\r\nfemales; so that they leave fewer, less vigorous, or no offspring. In\r\nregard to structures acquired through ordinary or natural selection,\r\nthere is in most cases, as long as the conditions of life remain the\r\nsame, a limit to the amount of advantageous modification in relation to\r\ncertain special purposes; but in regard to structures adapted to make\r\none male victorious over another, either in fighting or in charming the\r\nfemale, there is no definite limit to the amount of advantageous\r\nmodification; so that as long as the proper variations arise the work\r\nof sexual selection will go on. This circumstance may partly account\r\nfor the frequent and extraordinary amount of variability presented by\r\nsecondary sexual characters. Nevertheless, natural selection will\r\ndetermine that such characters shall not be acquired by the victorious\r\nmales, if they would be highly injurious, either by expending too much\r\nof their vital powers, or by exposing them to any great danger. The\r\ndevelopment, however, of certain structures—of the horns, for instance,\r\nin certain stags—has been carried to a wonderful extreme; and in some\r\ncases to an extreme which, as far as the general conditions of life are\r\nconcerned, must be slightly injurious to the male. From this fact we\r\nlearn that the advantages which favoured males derive from conquering\r\nother males in battle or courtship, and thus leaving a numerous\r\nprogeny, are in the long run greater than those derived from rather\r\nmore perfect adaptation to their conditions of life. We shall further\r\nsee, and it could never have been anticipated, that the power to charm\r\nthe female has sometimes been more important than the power to conquer\r\nother males in battle.\r\n\r\nLAWS OF INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how sexual selection has acted on many animals\r\nof many classes, and in the course of ages has produced a conspicuous\r\nresult, it is necessary to bear in mind the laws of inheritance, as far\r\nas they are known. Two distinct elements are included under the term\r\n“inheritance”—the transmission, and the development of characters; but\r\nas these generally go together, the distinction is often overlooked. We\r\nsee this distinction in those characters which are transmitted through\r\nthe early years of life, but are developed only at maturity or during\r\nold age. We see the same distinction more clearly with secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, for these are transmitted through both sexes, though\r\ndeveloped in one alone. That they are present in both sexes, is\r\nmanifest when two species, having strongly-marked sexual characters,\r\nare crossed, for each transmits the characters proper to its own male\r\nand female sex to the hybrid offspring of either sex. The same fact is\r\nlikewise manifest, when characters proper to the male are occasionally\r\ndeveloped in the female when she grows old or becomes diseased, as, for\r\ninstance, when the common hen assumes the flowing tail-feathers,\r\nhackles, comb, spurs, voice, and even pugnacity of the cock.\r\nConversely, the same thing is evident, more or less plainly, with\r\ncastrated males. Again, independently of old age or disease, characters\r\nare occasionally transferred from the male to the female, as when, in\r\ncertain breeds of the fowl, spurs regularly appear in the young and\r\nhealthy females. But in truth they are simply developed in the female;\r\nfor in every breed each detail in the structure of the spur is\r\ntransmitted through the female to her male offspring. Many cases will\r\nhereafter be given, where the female exhibits, more or less perfectly,\r\ncharacters proper to the male, in whom they must have been first\r\ndeveloped, and then transferred to the female. The converse case of the\r\nfirst development of characters in the female and of transference to\r\nthe male, is less frequent; it will therefore be well to give one\r\nstriking instance. With bees the pollen-collecting apparatus is used by\r\nthe female alone for gathering pollen for the larvae, yet in most of\r\nthe species it is partially developed in the males to whom it is quite\r\nuseless, and it is perfectly developed in the males of Bombus or the\r\nhumble-bee. (32. H. Muller, ‘Anwendung der Darwin’schen Lehre,’ etc.,\r\nVerh. d. n. V. Jahrg., xxix. p. 42.) As not a single other\r\nHymenopterous insect, not even the wasp, which is closely allied to the\r\nbee, is provided with a pollen-collecting apparatus, we have no grounds\r\nfor supposing that male bees primordially collected pollen as well as\r\nthe females; although we have some reason to suspect that male mammals\r\nprimordially suckled their young as well as the females. Lastly, in all\r\ncases of reversion, characters are transmitted through two, three, or\r\nmany more generations, and are then developed under certain unknown\r\nfavourable conditions. This important distinction between transmission\r\nand development will be best kept in mind by the aid of the hypothesis\r\nof pangenesis. According to this hypothesis, every unit or cell of the\r\nbody throws off gemmules or undeveloped atoms, which are transmitted to\r\nthe offspring of both sexes, and are multiplied by self-division. They\r\nmay remain undeveloped during the early years of life or during\r\nsuccessive generations; and their development into units or cells, like\r\nthose from which they were derived, depends on their affinity for, and\r\nunion with other units or cells previously developed in the due order\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE AT CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nThis tendency is well established. A new character, appearing in a\r\nyoung animal, whether it lasts throughout life or is only transient,\r\nwill, in general, reappear in the offspring at the same age and last\r\nfor the same time. If, on the other hand, a new character appears at\r\nmaturity, or even during old age, it tends to reappear in the offspring\r\nat the same advanced age. When deviations from this rule occur, the\r\ntransmitted characters much oftener appear before, than after the\r\ncorresponding age. As I have dwelt on this subject sufficiently in\r\nanother work (33. The ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. 1868, p. 75. In the last chapter but one, the\r\nprovisional hypothesis of pangenesis, above alluded to, is fully\r\nexplained.), I will here merely give two or three instances, for the\r\nsake of recalling the subject to the reader’s mind. In several breeds\r\nof the Fowl, the down-covered chickens, the young birds in their first\r\ntrue plumage, and the adults differ greatly from one another, as well\r\nas from their common parent-form, the Gallus bankiva; and these\r\ncharacters are faithfully transmitted by each breed to their offspring\r\nat the corresponding periods of life. For instance, the chickens of\r\nspangled Hamburgs, whilst covered with down, have a few dark spots on\r\nthe head and rump, but are not striped longitudinally, as in many other\r\nbreeds; in their first true plumage, “they are beautifully pencilled,”\r\nthat is each feather is transversely marked by numerous dark bars; but\r\nin their second plumage the feathers all become spangled or tipped with\r\na dark round spot. (34. These facts are given on the high authority of\r\na great breeder, Mr. Teebay; see Tegetmeier’s ‘Poultry Book,’ 1868, p.\r\n158. On the characters of chickens of different breeds, and on the\r\nbreeds of the pigeon, alluded to in the following paragraph, see\r\n‘Variation of Animals,’ etc., vol. i. pp. 160, 249; vol. ii. p. 77.)\r\nHence in this breed variations have occurred at, and been transmitted\r\nto, three distinct periods of life. The Pigeon offers a more remarkable\r\ncase, because the aboriginal parent species does not undergo any change\r\nof plumage with advancing age, excepting that at maturity the breast\r\nbecomes more iridescent; yet there are breeds which do not acquire\r\ntheir characteristic colours until they have moulted two, three, or\r\nfour times; and these modifications of plumage are regularly\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE AT CORRESPONDING SEASONS OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\nWith animals in a state of nature, innumerable instances occur of\r\ncharacters appearing periodically at different seasons. We see this in\r\nthe horns of the stag, and in the fur of Arctic animals which becomes\r\nthick and white during the winter. Many birds acquire bright colours\r\nand other decorations during the breeding-season alone. Pallas states\r\n(35. ‘Novae species Quadrupedum e Glirium ordine,’ 1778, p. 7. On the\r\ntransmission of colour by the horse, see ‘Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants under Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 51. Also vol. ii. p. 71, for a\r\ngeneral discussion on ‘Inheritance as limited by Sex.’), that in\r\nSiberia domestic cattle and horses become lighter-coloured during the\r\nwinter; and I have myself observed, and heard of similar strongly\r\nmarked changes of colour, that is, from brownish cream-colour or\r\nreddish-brown to a perfect white, in several ponies in England.\r\nAlthough I do not know that this tendency to change the colour of the\r\ncoat during different seasons is transmitted, yet it probably is so, as\r\nall shades of colour are strongly inherited by the horse. Nor is this\r\nform of inheritance, as limited by the seasons, more remarkable than\r\nits limitation by age or sex.\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE AS LIMITED BY SEX. — The equal transmission of characters\r\nto both sexes is the commonest form of inheritance, at least with those\r\nanimals which do not present strongly-marked sexual differences, and\r\nindeed with many of these. But characters are somewhat commonly\r\ntransferred exclusively to that sex, in which they first appear. Ample\r\nevidence on this head has been advanced in my work on ‘Variation under\r\nDomestication,’ but a few instances may here be given. There are breeds\r\nof the sheep and goat, in which the horns of the male differ greatly in\r\nshape from those of the female; and these differences, acquired under\r\ndomestication, are regularly transmitted to the same sex. As a rule, it\r\nis the females alone in cats which are tortoise-shell, the\r\ncorresponding colour in the males being rusty-red. With most breeds of\r\nthe fowl, the characters proper to each sex are transmitted to the same\r\nsex alone. So general is this form of transmission that it is an\r\nanomaly when variations in certain breeds are transmitted equally to\r\nboth sexes. There are also certain sub-breeds of the fowl in which the\r\nmales can hardly be distinguished from one another, whilst the females\r\ndiffer considerably in colour. The sexes of the pigeon in the\r\nparent-species do not differ in any external character; nevertheless,\r\nin certain domesticated breeds the male is coloured differently from\r\nthe female. (36. Dr. Chapuis, ‘Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge,’ 1865, p. 87.\r\nBoitard et Corbie, ‘Les Pigeons de Volière,’ etc., 1824, p. 173. See,\r\nalso, on similar differences in certain breeds at Modena, ‘Le\r\nvariazioni dei Colombi domestici,’ del Paolo Bonizzi, 1873.) The wattle\r\nin the English Carrier pigeon, and the crop in the Pouter, are more\r\nhighly developed in the male than in the female; and although these\r\ncharacters have been gained through long-continued selection by man,\r\nthe slight differences between the sexes are wholly due to the form of\r\ninheritance which has prevailed; for they have arisen, not from, but\r\nrather in opposition to, the wish of the breeder.\r\n\r\nMost of our domestic races have been formed by the accumulation of many\r\nslight variations; and as some of the successive steps have been\r\ntransmitted to one sex alone, and some to both sexes, we find in the\r\ndifferent breeds of the same species all gradations between great\r\nsexual dissimilarity and complete similarity. Instances have already\r\nbeen given with the breeds of the fowl and pigeon, and under nature\r\nanalogous cases are common. With animals under domestication, but\r\nwhether in nature I will not venture to say, one sex may lose\r\ncharacters proper to it, and may thus come somewhat to resemble the\r\nopposite sex; for instance, the males of some breeds of the fowl have\r\nlost their masculine tail-plumes and hackles. On the other hand, the\r\ndifferences between the sexes may be increased under domestication, as\r\nwith merino sheep, in which the ewes have lost their horns. Again,\r\ncharacters proper to one sex may suddenly appear in the other sex; as\r\nin those sub-breeds of the fowl in which the hens acquire spurs whilst\r\nyoung; or, as in certain Polish sub-breeds, in which the females, as\r\nthere is reason to believe, originally acquired a crest, and\r\nsubsequently transferred it to the males. All these cases are\r\nintelligible on the hypothesis of pangenesis; for they depend on the\r\ngemmules of certain parts, although present in both sexes, becoming,\r\nthrough the influence of domestication, either dormant or developed in\r\neither sex.\r\n\r\nThere is one difficult question which it will be convenient to defer to\r\na future chapter; namely, whether a character at first developed in\r\nboth sexes, could through selection be limited in its development to\r\none sex alone. If, for instance, a breeder observed that some of his\r\npigeons (of which the characters are usually transferred in an equal\r\ndegree to both sexes) varied into pale blue, could he by long-continued\r\nselection make a breed, in which the males alone should be of this\r\ntint, whilst the females remained unchanged? I will here only say, that\r\nthis, though perhaps not impossible, would be extremely difficult; for\r\nthe natural result of breeding from the pale-blue males would be to\r\nchange the whole stock of both sexes to this tint. If, however,\r\nvariations of the desired tint appeared, which were from the first\r\nlimited in their development to the male sex, there would not be the\r\nleast difficulty in making a breed with the two sexes of a different\r\ncolour, as indeed has been effected with a Belgian breed, in which the\r\nmales alone are streaked with black. In a similar manner, if any\r\nvariation appeared in a female pigeon, which was from the first\r\nsexually limited in its development to the females, it would be easy to\r\nmake a breed with the females alone thus characterised; but if the\r\nvariation was not thus originally limited, the process would be\r\nextremely difficult, perhaps impossible. (37. Since the publication of\r\nthe first edition of this work, it has been highly satisfactory to me\r\nto find the following remarks (the ‘Field,’ Sept. 1872) from so\r\nexperienced a breeder as Mr. Tegetmeier. After describing some curious\r\ncases in pigeons, of the transmission of colour by one sex alone, and\r\nthe formation of a sub-breed with this character, he says: “It is a\r\nsingular circumstance that Mr. Darwin should have suggested the\r\npossibility of modifying the sexual colours of birds by a course of\r\nartificial selection. When he did so, he was in ignorance of these\r\nfacts that I have related; but it is remarkable how very closely he\r\nsuggested the right method of procedure.”)\r\n\r\nON THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT OF A CHARACTER AND\r\nITS TRANSMISSION TO ONE SEX OR TO BOTH SEXES.\r\n\r\nWhy certain characters should be inherited by both sexes, and other\r\ncharacters by one sex alone, namely by that sex in which the character\r\nfirst appeared, is in most cases quite unknown. We cannot even\r\nconjecture why with certain sub-breeds of the pigeon, black striae,\r\nthough transmitted through the female, should be developed in the male\r\nalone, whilst every other character is equally transferred to both\r\nsexes. Why, again, with cats, the tortoise-shell colour should, with\r\nrare exceptions, be developed in the female alone. The very same\r\ncharacter, such as deficient or supernumerary digits, colour-blindness,\r\netc., may with mankind be inherited by the males alone of one family,\r\nand in another family by the females alone, though in both cases\r\ntransmitted through the opposite as well as through the same sex. (38.\r\nReferences are given in my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. p. 72.) Although we are thus ignorant, the two\r\nfollowing rules seem often to hold good—that variations which first\r\nappear in either sex at a late period of life, tend to be developed in\r\nthe same sex alone; whilst variations which first appear early in life\r\nin either sex tend to be developed in both sexes. I am, however, far\r\nfrom supposing that this is the sole determining cause. As I have not\r\nelsewhere discussed this subject, and it has an important bearing on\r\nsexual selection, I must here enter into lengthy and somewhat intricate\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nIt is in itself probable that any character appearing at an early age\r\nwould tend to be inherited equally by both sexes, for the sexes do not\r\ndiffer much in constitution before the power of reproduction is gained.\r\nOn the other hand, after this power has been gained and the sexes have\r\ncome to differ in constitution, the gemmules (if I may again use the\r\nlanguage of pangenesis) which are cast off from each varying part in\r\nthe one sex would be much more likely to possess the proper affinities\r\nfor uniting with the tissues of the same sex, and thus becoming\r\ndeveloped, than with those of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nI was first led to infer that a relation of this kind exists, from the\r\nfact that whenever and in whatever manner the adult male differs from\r\nthe adult female, he differs in the same manner from the young of both\r\nsexes. The generality of this fact is quite remarkable: it holds good\r\nwith almost all mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes; also with many\r\ncrustaceans, spiders, and some few insects, such as certain orthoptera\r\nand libellulae. In all these cases the variations, through the\r\naccumulation of which the male acquired his proper masculine\r\ncharacters, must have occurred at a somewhat late period of life;\r\notherwise the young males would have been similarly characterised; and\r\nconformably with our rule, the variations are transmitted to and\r\ndeveloped in the adult males alone. When, on the other hand, the adult\r\nmale closely resembles the young of both sexes (these, with rare\r\nexceptions, being alike), he generally resembles the adult female; and\r\nin most of these cases the variations through which the young and old\r\nacquired their present characters, probably occurred, according to our\r\nrule, during youth. But there is here room for doubt, for characters\r\nare sometimes transferred to the offspring at an earlier age than that\r\nat which they first appeared in the parents, so that the parents may\r\nhave varied when adult, and have transferred their characters to their\r\noffspring whilst young. There are, moreover, many animals, in which the\r\ntwo sexes closely resemble each other, and yet both differ from their\r\nyoung: and here the characters of the adults must have been acquired\r\nlate in life; nevertheless, these characters, in apparent contradiction\r\nto our rule, are transferred to both sexes. We must not however,\r\noverlook the possibility or even probability of successive variations\r\nof the same nature occurring, under exposure to similar conditions,\r\nsimultaneously in both sexes at a rather late period of life; and in\r\nthis case the variations would be transferred to the offspring of both\r\nsexes at a corresponding late age; and there would then be no real\r\ncontradiction to the rule that variations occurring late in life are\r\ntransferred exclusively to the sex in which they first appeared. This\r\nlatter rule seems to hold true more generally than the second one,\r\nnamely, that variations which occur in either sex early in life tend to\r\nbe transferred to both sexes. As it was obviously impossible even to\r\nestimate in how large a number of cases throughout the animal kingdom\r\nthese two propositions held good, it occurred to me to investigate some\r\nstriking or crucial instances, and to rely on the result.\r\n\r\nAn excellent case for investigation is afforded by the Deer family. In\r\nall the species, but one, the horns are developed only in the males,\r\nthough certainly transmitted through the females, and capable of\r\nabnormal development in them. In the reindeer, on the other hand, the\r\nfemale is provided with horns; so that in this species, the horns\r\nought, according to our rule, to appear early in life, long before the\r\ntwo sexes are mature and have come to differ much in constitution. In\r\nall the other species the horns ought to appear later in life, which\r\nwould lead to their development in that sex alone, in which they first\r\nappeared in the progenitor of the whole Family. Now in seven species,\r\nbelonging to distinct sections of the family and inhabiting different\r\nregions, in which the stags alone bear horns, I find that the horns\r\nfirst appear at periods, varying from nine months after birth in the\r\nroebuck, to ten, twelve or even more months in the stags of the six\r\nother and larger species. (39. I am much obliged to Mr. Cupples for\r\nhaving made enquiries for me in regard to the Roebuck and Red Deer of\r\nScotland from Mr. Robertson, the experienced head-forester to the\r\nMarquis of Breadalbane. In regard to Fallow-deer, I have to thank Mr.\r\nEyton and others for information. For the Cervus alces of N. America,\r\nsee ‘Land and Water,’ 1868, pp. 221 and 254; and for the C. Virginianus\r\nand strongyloceros of the same continent, see J.D. Caton, in ‘Ottawa\r\nAcad. of Nat. Sc.’ 1868, p. 13. For Cervus Eldi of Pegu, see Lieut.\r\nBeaven, ‘Proccedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1867, p. 762.) But\r\nwith the reindeer the case is widely different; for, as I hear from\r\nProf. Nilsson, who kindly made special enquiries for me in Lapland, the\r\nhorns appear in the young animals within four or five weeks after\r\nbirth, and at the same time in both sexes. So that here we have a\r\nstructure, developed at a most unusually early age in one species of\r\nthe family, and likewise common to both sexes in this one species\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIn several kinds of antelopes, only the males are provided with horns,\r\nwhilst in the greater number both sexes bear horns. With respect to the\r\nperiod of development, Mr. Blyth informs me that there was at one time\r\nin the Zoological Gardens a young koodoo (Ant. strepsiceros), of which\r\nthe males alone are horned, and also the young of a closely-allied\r\nspecies, the eland (Ant. oreas), in which both sexes are horned. Now it\r\nis in strict conformity with our rule, that in the young male koodoo,\r\nalthough ten months old, the horns were remarkably small, considering\r\nthe size ultimately attained by them; whilst in the young male eland,\r\nalthough only three months old, the horns were already very much larger\r\nthan in the koodoo. It is also a noticeable fact that in the\r\nprong-horned antelope (40. Antilocapra Americana. I have to thank Dr.\r\nCanfield for information with respect to the horns of the female: see\r\nalso his paper in ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1866, p.\r\n109. Also Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 627), only a few\r\nof the females, about one in five, have horns, and these are in a\r\nrudimentary state, though sometimes above four inches long: so that as\r\nfar as concerns the possession of horns by the males alone, this\r\nspecies is in an intermediate condition, and the horns do not appear\r\nuntil about five or six months after birth. Therefore in comparison\r\nwith what little we know of the development of the horns in other\r\nantelopes, and from what we do know with respect to the horns of deer,\r\ncattle, etc., those of the prong-horned antelope appear at an\r\nintermediate period of life,—that is, not very early, as in cattle and\r\nsheep, nor very late, as in the larger deer and antelopes. The horns of\r\nsheep, goats, and cattle, which are well developed in both sexes,\r\nthough not quite equal in size, can be felt, or even seen, at birth or\r\nsoon afterwards. (41. I have been assured that the horns of the sheep\r\nin North Wales can always be felt, and are sometimes even an inch in\r\nlength, at birth. Youatt says (‘Cattle,’ 1834, p. 277), that the\r\nprominence of the frontal bone in cattle penetrates the cutis at birth,\r\nand that the horny matter is soon formed over it.) Our rule, however,\r\nseems to fail in some breeds of sheep, for instance merinos, in which\r\nthe rams alone are horned; for I cannot find on enquiry (42. I am\r\ngreatly indebted to Prof. Victor Carus for having made enquiries for\r\nme, from the highest authorities, with respect to the merino sheep of\r\nSaxony. On the Guinea coast of Africa there is, however, a breed of\r\nsheep in which, as with merinos, the rams alone bear horns; and Mr.\r\nWinwood Reade informs me that in one case observed by him, a young ram,\r\nborn on Feb. 10th, first shewed horns on March 6th, so that in this\r\ninstance, in conformity with rule, the development of the horns\r\noccurred at a later period of life than in Welsh sheep, in which both\r\nsexes are horned.), that the horns are developed later in life in this\r\nbreed than in ordinary sheep in which both sexes are horned. But with\r\ndomesticated sheep the presence or absence of horns is not a firmly\r\nfixed character; for a certain proportion of the merino ewes bear small\r\nhorns, and some of the rams are hornless; and in most breeds hornless\r\newes are occasionally produced.\r\n\r\nDr. W. Marshall has lately made a special study of the protuberances so\r\ncommon on the heads of birds (43. ‘Über die knochernen Schädelhöcker\r\nder Vögel,’ in the ‘Niederland. Archiv fur Zoologie,’ B.i. Heft 2,\r\n1872.), and he comes to the following conclusion:—that with those\r\nspecies in which they are confined to the males, they are developed\r\nlate in life; whereas with those species in which they are common to\r\nthe two sexes, they are developed at a very early period. This is\r\ncertainly a striking confirmation of my two laws of inheritance.\r\n\r\nIn most of the species of the splendid family of the Pheasants, the\r\nmales differ conspicuously from the females, and they acquire their\r\nornaments at a rather late period of life. The eared pheasant\r\n(Crossoptilon auritum), however, offers a remarkable exception, for\r\nboth sexes possess the fine caudal plumes, the large ear-tufts and the\r\ncrimson velvet about the head; I find that all these characters appear\r\nvery early in life in accordance with rule. The adult male can,\r\nhowever, be distinguished from the adult female by the presence of\r\nspurs; and conformably with our rule, these do not begin to be\r\ndeveloped before the age of six months, as I am assured by Mr.\r\nBartlett, and even at this age, the two sexes can hardly be\r\ndistinguished. (44. In the common peacock (Pavo cristatus) the male\r\nalone possesses spurs, whilst both sexes of the Java Peacock (P.\r\nmuticus) offer the unusual case of being furnished with spurs. Hence I\r\nfully expected that in the latter species they would have been\r\ndeveloped earlier in life than in the common peacock; but M. Hegt of\r\nAmsterdam informs me, that with young birds of the previous year, of\r\nboth species, compared on April 23rd, 1869, there was no difference in\r\nthe development of the spurs. The spurs, however, were as yet\r\nrepresented merely by slight knobs or elevations. I presume that I\r\nshould have been informed if any difference in the rate of development\r\nhad been observed subsequently.) The male and female Peacock differ\r\nconspicuously from each other in almost every part of their plumage,\r\nexcept in the elegant head-crest, which is common to both sexes; and\r\nthis is developed very early in life, long before the other ornaments,\r\nwhich are confined to the male. The wild-duck offers an analogous case,\r\nfor the beautiful green speculum on the wings is common to both sexes,\r\nthough duller and somewhat smaller in the female, and it is developed\r\nearly in life, whilst the curled tail-feathers and other ornaments of\r\nthe male are developed later. (45. In some other species of the Duck\r\nfamily the speculum differs in a greater degree in the two sexes; but I\r\nhave not been able to discover whether its full development occurs\r\nlater in life in the males of such species, than in the male of the\r\ncommon duck, as ought to be the case according to our rule. With the\r\nallied Mergus cucullatus we have, however, a case of this kind: the two\r\nsexes differ conspicuously in general plumage, and to a considerable\r\ndegree in the speculum, which is pure white in the male and\r\ngreyish-white in the female. Now the young males at first entirely\r\nresemble the females, and have a greyish-white speculum, which becomes\r\npure white at an earlier age than that at which the adult male acquires\r\nhis other and more strongly-marked sexual differences: see Audubon,\r\n‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. iii. 1835, pp. 249-250.) Between such\r\nextreme cases of close sexual resemblance and wide dissimilarity, as\r\nthose of the Crossoptilon and peacock, many intermediate ones could be\r\ngiven, in which the characters follow our two rules in their order of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nAs most insects emerge from the pupal state in a mature condition, it\r\nis doubtful whether the period of development can determine the\r\ntransference of their characters to one or to both sexes. But we do not\r\nknow that the coloured scales, for instance, in two species of\r\nbutterflies, in one of which the sexes differ in colour, whilst in the\r\nother they are alike, are developed at the same relative age in the\r\ncocoon. Nor do we know whether all the scales are simultaneously\r\ndeveloped on the wings of the same species of butterfly, in which\r\ncertain coloured marks are confined to one sex, whilst others are\r\ncommon to both sexes. A difference of this kind in the period of\r\ndevelopment is not so improbable as it may at first appear; for with\r\nthe Orthoptera, which assume their adult state, not by a single\r\nmetamorphosis, but by a succession of moults, the young males of some\r\nspecies at first resemble the females, and acquire their distinctive\r\nmasculine characters only at a later moult. Strictly analogous cases\r\noccur at the successive moults of certain male crustaceans.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet considered the transference of characters, relatively to\r\ntheir period of development, only in species in a natural state; we\r\nwill now turn to domesticated animals, and first touch on monstrosities\r\nand diseases. The presence of supernumerary digits, and the absence of\r\ncertain phalanges, must be determined at an early embryonic period—the\r\ntendency to profuse bleeding is at least congenital, as is probably\r\ncolour-blindness—yet these peculiarities, and other similar ones, are\r\noften limited in their transmission to one sex; so that the rule that\r\ncharacters, developed at an early period, tend to be transmitted to\r\nboth sexes, here wholly fails. But this rule, as before remarked, does\r\nnot appear to be nearly so general as the converse one, namely, that\r\ncharacters which appear late in life in one sex are transmitted\r\nexclusively to the same sex. From the fact of the above abnormal\r\npeculiarities becoming attached to one sex, long before the sexual\r\nfunctions are active, we may infer that there must be some difference\r\nbetween the sexes at an extremely early age. With respect to\r\nsexually-limited diseases, we know too little of the period at which\r\nthey originate, to draw any safe conclusion. Gout, however, seems to\r\nfall under our rule, for it is generally caused by intemperance during\r\nmanhood, and is transmitted from the father to his sons in a much more\r\nmarked manner than to his daughters.\r\n\r\nIn the various domestic breeds of sheep, goats, and cattle, the males\r\ndiffer from their respective females in the shape or development of\r\ntheir horns, forehead, mane, dewlap, tail, and hump on the shoulders;\r\nand these peculiarities, in accordance with our rule, are not fully\r\ndeveloped until a rather late period of life. The sexes of dogs do not\r\ndiffer, except that in certain breeds, especially in the Scotch\r\ndeer-hound, the male is much larger and heavier than the female; and,\r\nas we shall see in a future chapter, the male goes on increasing in\r\nsize to an unusually late period of life, which, according to rule,\r\nwill account for his increased size being transmitted to his male\r\noffspring alone. On the other hand, the tortoise-shell colour, which is\r\nconfined to female cats, is quite distinct at birth, and this case\r\nviolates the rule. There is a breed of pigeons in which the males alone\r\nare streaked with black, and the streaks can be detected even in the\r\nnestlings; but they become more conspicuous at each successive moult,\r\nso that this case partly opposes and partly supports the rule. With the\r\nEnglish Carrier and Pouter pigeons, the full development of the wattle\r\nand the crop occurs rather late in life, and conformably with the rule,\r\nthese characters are transmitted in full perfection to the males alone.\r\nThe following cases perhaps come within the class previously alluded\r\nto, in which both sexes have varied in the same manner at a rather late\r\nperiod of life, and have consequently transferred their new characters\r\nto both sexes at a corresponding late period; and if so, these cases\r\nare not opposed to our rule:—there exist sub-breeds of the pigeon,\r\ndescribed by Neumeister (46. ‘Das Ganze der Taubenzucht,’ 1837, ss. 21,\r\n24. For the case of the streaked pigeons, see Dr. Chapuis, ‘Le pigeon\r\nvoyageur Belge,’ 1865, p. 87.), in which both sexes change their colour\r\nduring two or three moults (as is likewise the case with the Almond\r\nTumbler); nevertheless, these changes, though occurring rather late in\r\nlife, are common to both sexes. One variety of the Canary-bird, namely\r\nthe London Prize, offers a nearly analogous case.\r\n\r\nWith the breeds of the Fowl the inheritance of various characters by\r\none or both sexes, seems generally determined by the period at which\r\nsuch characters are developed. Thus in all the many breeds in which the\r\nadult male differs greatly in colour from the female, as well as from\r\nthe wild parent-species, he differs also from the young male, so that\r\nthe newly-acquired characters must have appeared at a rather late\r\nperiod of life. On the other hand, in most of the breeds in which the\r\ntwo sexes resemble each other, the young are coloured in nearly the\r\nsame manner as their parents, and this renders it probable that their\r\ncolours first appeared early in life. We have instances of this fact in\r\nall black and white breeds, in which the young and old of both sexes\r\nare alike; nor can it be maintained that there is something peculiar in\r\na black or white plumage, which leads to its transference to both\r\nsexes; for the males alone of many natural species are either black or\r\nwhite, the females being differently coloured. With the so-called\r\nCuckoo sub-breeds of the fowl, in which the feathers are transversely\r\npencilled with dark stripes, both sexes and the chickens are coloured\r\nin nearly the same manner. The laced plumage of the Sebright bantam is\r\nthe same in both sexes, and in the young chickens the wing-feathers are\r\ndistinctly, though imperfectly laced. Spangled Hamburgs, however, offer\r\na partial exception; for the two sexes, though not quite alike,\r\nresemble each other more closely than do the sexes of the aboriginal\r\nparent-species; yet they acquire their characteristic plumage late in\r\nlife, for the chickens are distinctly pencilled. With respect to other\r\ncharacters besides colour, in the wild-parent species and in most of\r\nthe domestic breeds, the males alone possess a well-developed comb; but\r\nin the young of the Spanish fowl it is largely developed at a very\r\nearly age, and, in accordance with this early development in the male,\r\nit is of unusual size in the adult female. In the Game breeds pugnacity\r\nis developed at a wonderfully early age, of which curious proofs could\r\nbe given; and this character is transmitted to both sexes, so that the\r\nhens, from their extreme pugnacity, are now generally exhibited in\r\nseparate pens. With the Polish breeds the bony protuberance of the\r\nskull which supports the crest is partially developed even before the\r\nchickens are hatched, and the crest itself soon begins to grow, though\r\nat first feebly (47. For full particulars and references on all these\r\npoints respecting the several breeds of the Fowl, see ‘Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. i. pp. 250, 256. In\r\nregard to the higher animals, the sexual differences which have arisen\r\nunder domestication are described in the same work under the head of\r\neach species.); and in this breed the adults of both sexes are\r\ncharacterised by a great bony protuberance and an immense crest.\r\n\r\nFinally, from what we have now seen of the relation which exists in\r\nmany natural species and domesticated races, between the period of the\r\ndevelopment of their characters and the manner of their\r\ntransmission—for example, the striking fact of the early growth of the\r\nhorns in the reindeer, in which both sexes bear horns, in comparison\r\nwith their much later growth in the other species in which the male\r\nalone bears horns—we may conclude that one, though not the sole cause\r\nof characters being exclusively inherited by one sex, is their\r\ndevelopment at a late age. And secondly, that one, though apparently a\r\nless efficient cause of characters being inherited by both sexes, is\r\ntheir development at an early age, whilst the sexes differ but little\r\nin constitution. It appears, however, that some difference must exist\r\nbetween the sexes even during a very early embryonic period, for\r\ncharacters developed at this age not rarely become attached to one sex.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing discussion on the various laws of inheritance, we\r\nlearn that the characters of the parents often, or even generally, tend\r\nto become developed in the offspring of the same sex, at the same age,\r\nand periodically at the same season of the year, in which they first\r\nappeared in the parents. But these rules, owing to unknown causes, are\r\nfar from being fixed. Hence during the modification of a species, the\r\nsuccessive changes may readily be transmitted in different ways; some\r\nto one sex, and some to both; some to the offspring at one age, and\r\nsome to the offspring at all ages. Not only are the laws of inheritance\r\nextremely complex, but so are the causes which induce and govern\r\nvariability. The variations thus induced are preserved and accumulated\r\nby sexual selection, which is in itself an extremely complex affair,\r\ndepending, as it does, on the ardour in love, the courage, and the\r\nrivalry of the males, as well as on the powers of perception, the\r\ntaste, and will of the female. Sexual selection will also be largely\r\ndominated by natural selection tending towards the general welfare of\r\nthe species. Hence the manner in which the individuals of either or\r\nboth sexes have been affected through sexual selection cannot fail to\r\nbe complex in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nWhen variations occur late in life in one sex, and are transmitted to\r\nthe same sex at the same age, the other sex and the young are left\r\nunmodified. When they occur late in life, but are transmitted to both\r\nsexes at the same age, the young alone are left unmodified. Variations,\r\nhowever, may occur at any period of life in one sex or in both, and be\r\ntransmitted to both sexes at all ages, and then all the individuals of\r\nthe species are similarly modified. In the following chapters it will\r\nbe seen that all these cases frequently occur in nature.\r\n\r\nSexual selection can never act on any animal before the age for\r\nreproduction arrives. From the great eagerness of the male it has\r\ngenerally acted on this sex and not on the females. The males have thus\r\nbecome provided with weapons for fighting with their rivals, with\r\norgans for discovering and securely holding the female, and for\r\nexciting or charming her. When the sexes differ in these respects, it\r\nis also, as we have seen, an extremely general law that the adult male\r\ndiffers more or less from the young male; and we may conclude from this\r\nfact that the successive variations, by which the adult male became\r\nmodified, did not generally occur much before the age for reproduction.\r\nWhenever some or many of the variations occurred early in life, the\r\nyoung males would partake more or less of the characters of the adult\r\nmales; and differences of this kind between the old and young males may\r\nbe observed in many species of animals.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that young male animals have often tended to vary in a\r\nmanner which would not only have been of no use to them at an early\r\nage, but would have been actually injurious—as by acquiring bright\r\ncolours, which would render them conspicuous to their enemies, or by\r\nacquiring structures, such as great horns, which would expend much\r\nvital force in their development. Variations of this kind occurring in\r\nthe young males would almost certainly be eliminated through natural\r\nselection. With the adult and experienced males, on the other hand, the\r\nadvantages derived from the acquisition of such characters, would more\r\nthan counterbalance some exposure to danger, and some loss of vital\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nAs variations which give to the male a better chance of conquering\r\nother males, or of finding, securing, or charming the opposite sex,\r\nwould, if they happened to arise in the female, be of no service to\r\nher, they would not be preserved in her through sexual selection. We\r\nhave also good evidence with domesticated animals, that variations of\r\nall kinds are, if not carefully selected, soon lost through\r\nintercrossing and accidental deaths. Consequently in a state of nature,\r\nif variations of the above kind chanced to arise in the female line,\r\nand to be transmitted exclusively in this line, they would be extremely\r\nliable to be lost. If, however, the females varied and transmitted\r\ntheir newly acquired characters to their offspring of both sexes, the\r\ncharacters which were advantageous to the males would be preserved by\r\nthem through sexual selection, and the two sexes would in consequence\r\nbe modified in the same manner, although such characters were of no use\r\nto the females: but I shall hereafter have to recur to these more\r\nintricate contingencies. Lastly, the females may acquire, and\r\napparently have often acquired by transference, characters from the\r\nmale sex.\r\n\r\nAs variations occurring later in life, and transmitted to one sex\r\nalone, have incessantly been taken advantage of and accumulated through\r\nsexual selection in relation to the reproduction of the species;\r\ntherefore it appears, at first sight, an unaccountable fact that\r\nsimilar variations have not frequently been accumulated through natural\r\nselection, in relation to the ordinary habits of life. If this had\r\noccurred, the two sexes would often have been differently modified, for\r\nthe sake, for instance, of capturing prey or of escaping from danger.\r\nDifferences of this kind between the two sexes do occasionally occur,\r\nespecially in the lower classes. But this implies that the two sexes\r\nfollow different habits in their struggles for existence, which is a\r\nrare circumstance with the higher animals. The case, however, is widely\r\ndifferent with the reproductive functions, in which respect the sexes\r\nnecessarily differ. For variations in structure which are related to\r\nthese functions, have often proved of value to one sex, and from having\r\narisen at a late period of life, have been transmitted to one sex\r\nalone; and such variations, thus preserved and transmitted, have given\r\nrise to secondary sexual characters.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters, I shall treat of the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters in animals of all classes, and shall endeavour in each case\r\nto apply the principles explained in the present chapter. The lowest\r\nclasses will detain us for a very short time, but the higher animals,\r\nespecially birds, must be treated at considerable length. It should be\r\nborne in mind that for reasons already assigned, I intend to give only\r\na few illustrative instances of the innumerable structures by the aid\r\nof which the male finds the female, or, when found, holds her. On the\r\nother hand, all structures and instincts by the aid of which the male\r\nconquers other males, and by which he allures or excites the female,\r\nwill be fully discussed, as these are in many ways the most\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT ON THE PROPORTIONAL NUMBERS OF THE TWO SEXES IN ANIMALS\r\nBELONGING TO VARIOUS CLASSES.\r\n\r\nAs no one, as far as I can discover, has paid attention to the relative\r\nnumbers of the two sexes throughout the animal kingdom, I will here\r\ngive such materials as I have been able to collect, although they are\r\nextremely imperfect. They consist in only a few instances of actual\r\nenumeration, and the numbers are not very large. As the proportions are\r\nknown with certainty only in mankind, I will first give them as a\r\nstandard of comparison.\r\n\r\nMAN.\r\n\r\nIn England during ten years (from 1857 to 1866) the average number of\r\nchildren born alive yearly was 707,120, in the proportion of 104.5\r\nmales to 100 females. But in 1857 the male births throughout England\r\nwere as 105.2, and in 1865 as 104.0 to 100. Looking to separate\r\ndistricts, in Buckinghamshire (where about 5000 children are annually\r\nborn) the MEAN proportion of male to female births, during the whole\r\nperiod of the above ten years, was as 102.8 to 100; whilst in N. Wales\r\n(where the average annual births are 12,873) it was as high as 106.2 to\r\n100. Taking a still smaller district, viz., Rutlandshire (where the\r\nannual births average only 739), in 1864 the male births were as 114.6,\r\nand in 1862 as only 97.0 to 100; but even in this small district the\r\naverage of the 7385 births during the whole ten years, was as 104.5 to\r\n100: that is in the same ratio as throughout England. (48.\r\n‘Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the Registrar-General for 1866.’ In this\r\nreport (p. xii.) a special decennial table is given.) The proportions\r\nare sometimes slightly disturbed by unknown causes; thus Prof. Faye\r\nstates “that in some districts of Norway there has been during a\r\ndecennial period a steady deficiency of boys, whilst in others the\r\nopposite condition has existed.” In France during forty-four years the\r\nmale to the female births have been as 106.2 to 100; but during this\r\nperiod it has occurred five times in one department, and six times in\r\nanother, that the female births have exceeded the males. In Russia the\r\naverage proportion is as high as 108.9, and in Philadelphia in the\r\nUnited States as 110.5 to 100. (49. For Norway and Russia, see abstract\r\nof Prof. Faye’s researches, in ‘British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg.\r\nReview,’ April 1867, pp. 343, 345. For France, the ‘Annuaire pour l’An\r\n1867,’ p. 213. For Philadelphia, Dr. Stockton Hough, ‘Social Science\r\nAssoc.’ 1874. For the Cape of Good Hope, Quetelet as quoted by Dr. H.H.\r\nZouteveen, in the Dutch Translation of this work (vol. i. p. 417),\r\nwhere much information is given on the proportion of the sexes.) The\r\naverage for Europe, deduced by Bickes from about seventy million\r\nbirths, is 106 males to 100 females. On the other hand, with white\r\nchildren born at the Cape of Good Hope, the proportion of males is so\r\nlow as to fluctuate during successive years between 90 and 99 males for\r\nevery 100 females. It is a singular fact that with Jews the proportion\r\nof male births is decidedly larger than with Christians: thus in\r\nPrussia the proportion is as 113, in Breslau as 114, and in Livonia as\r\n120 to 100; the Christian births in these countries being the same as\r\nusual, for instance, in Livonia as 104 to 100. (50. In regard to the\r\nJews, see M. Thury, ‘La Loi de Production des Sexes,’ 1863, p. 25.)\r\n\r\nProf. Faye remarks that “a still greater preponderance of males would\r\nbe met with, if death struck both sexes in equal proportion in the womb\r\nand during birth. But the fact is, that for every 100 still-born\r\nfemales, we have in several countries from 134.6 to 144.9 still-born\r\nmales. During the first four or five years of life, also, more male\r\nchildren die than females, for example in England, during the first\r\nyear, 126 boys die for every 100 girls—a proportion which in France is\r\nstill more unfavourable.” (51. ‘British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg.\r\nReview,’ April 1867, p. 343. Dr. Stark also remarks (‘Tenth Annual\r\nReport of Births, Deaths, etc., in Scotland,’ 1867, p. xxviii.) that\r\n“These examples may suffice to show that, at almost every stage of\r\nlife, the males in Scotland have a greater liability to death and a\r\nhigher death-rate than the females. The fact, however, of this\r\npeculiarity being most strongly developed at that infantile period of\r\nlife when the dress, food, and general treatment of both sexes are\r\nalike, seems to prove that the higher male death-rate is an impressed,\r\nnatural, and constitutional peculiarity due to sex alone.”) Dr.\r\nStockton Hough accounts for these facts in part by the more frequent\r\ndefective development of males than of females. We have before seen\r\nthat the male sex is more variable in structure than the female; and\r\nvariations in important organs would generally be injurious. But the\r\nsize of the body, and especially of the head, being greater in male\r\nthan female infants is another cause: for the males are thus more\r\nliable to be injured during parturition. Consequently the still-born\r\nmales are more numerous; and, as a highly competent judge, Dr. Crichton\r\nBrowne (52. ‘West Riding Lunatic Asylum Reports,’ vol. i. 1871, p. 8.\r\nSir J. Simpson has proved that the head of the male infant exceeds that\r\nof the female by 3/8ths of an inch in circumference, and by 1/8th in\r\ntransverse diameter. Quetelet has shewn that woman is born smaller than\r\nman; see Dr. Duncan, ‘Fecundity, Fertility, and Sterility,’ 1871, p.\r\n382.), believes, male infants often suffer in health for some years\r\nafter birth. Owing to this excess in the death-rate of male children,\r\nboth at birth and for some time subsequently, and owing to the exposure\r\nof grown men to various dangers, and to their tendency to emigrate, the\r\nfemales in all old-settled countries, where statistical records have\r\nbeen kept, are found to preponderate considerably over the males. (53.\r\nWith the savage Guaranys of Paraguay, according to the accurate Azara\r\n(‘Voyages dans l’Amerique merid.’ tom. ii. 1809, pp. 60, 179), the\r\nwomen are to the men in the proportion of 14 to 13.)\r\n\r\nIt seems at first sight a mysterious fact that in different nations,\r\nunder different conditions and climates, in Naples, Prussia,\r\nWestphalia, Holland, France, England and the United States, the excess\r\nof male over female births is less when they are illegitimate than when\r\nlegitimate. (54. Babbage, ‘Edinburgh Journal of Science,’ 1829, vol. i.\r\np. 88; also p. 90, on still-born children. On illegitimate children in\r\nEngland, see ‘Report of Registrar-General for 1866,’ p. xv.) This has\r\nbeen explained by different writers in many different ways, as from the\r\nmothers being generally young, from the large proportion of first\r\npregnancies, etc. But we have seen that male infants, from the large\r\nsize of their heads, suffer more than female infants during\r\nparturition; and as the mothers of illegitimate children must be more\r\nliable than other women to undergo bad labours, from various causes,\r\nsuch as attempts at concealment by tight lacing, hard work, distress of\r\nmind, etc., their male infants would proportionably suffer. And this\r\nprobably is the most efficient of all the causes of the proportion of\r\nmales to females born alive being less amongst illegitimate children\r\nthan amongst the legitimate. With most animals the greater size of the\r\nadult male than of the female, is due to the stronger males having\r\nconquered the weaker in their struggles for the possession of the\r\nfemales, and no doubt it is owing to this fact that the two sexes of at\r\nleast some animals differ in size at birth. Thus we have the curious\r\nfact that we may attribute the more frequent deaths of male than female\r\ninfants, especially amongst the illegitimate, at least in part to\r\nsexual selection.\r\n\r\nIt has often been supposed that the relative age of the two parents\r\ndetermine the sex of the offspring; and Prof. Leuckart (55. Leuckart,\r\nin Wagner ‘Handwörterbuch der Phys.’ B. iv. 1853, s. 774.) has advanced\r\nwhat he considers sufficient evidence, with respect to man and certain\r\ndomesticated animals, that this is one important though not the sole\r\nfactor in the result. So again the period of impregnation relatively to\r\nthe state of the female has been thought by some to be the efficient\r\ncause; but recent observations discountenance this belief. According to\r\nDr. Stockton Hough (56. ‘Social Science Association of Philadelphia,’\r\n1874.), the season of the year, the poverty or wealth of the parents,\r\nresidence in the country or in cities, the crossing of foreign\r\nimmigrants, etc., all influence the proportion of the sexes. With\r\nmankind, polygamy has also been supposed to lead to the birth of a\r\ngreater proportion of female infants; but Dr. J. Campbell (57.\r\n‘Anthropological Review,’ April 1870, p. cviii.) carefully attended to\r\nthis subject in the harems of Siam, and concludes that the proportion\r\nof male to female births is the same as from monogamous unions. Hardly\r\nany animal has been rendered so highly polygamous as the English\r\nrace-horse, and we shall immediately see that his male and female\r\noffspring are almost exactly equal in number. I will now give the facts\r\nwhich I have collected with respect to the proportional numbers of the\r\nsexes of various animals; and will then briefly discuss how far\r\nselection has come into play in determining the result.\r\n\r\nHORSES.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier has been so kind as to tabulate for me from the ‘Racing\r\nCalendar’ the births of race-horses during a period of twenty-one\r\nyears, viz., from 1846 to 1867; 1849 being omitted, as no returns were\r\nthat year published. The total births were 25,560 (58. During eleven\r\nyears a record was kept of the number of mares which proved barren or\r\nprematurely slipped their foals; and it deserves notice, as shewing how\r\ninfertile these highly-nurtured and rather closely-interbred animals\r\nhave become, that not far from one-third of the mares failed to produce\r\nliving foals. Thus during 1866, 809 male colts and 816 female colts\r\nwere born, and 743 mares failed to produce offspring. During 1867, 836\r\nmales and 902 females were born, and 794 mares failed.), consisting of\r\n12,763 males and 12,797 females, or in the proportion of 99.7 males to\r\n100 females. As these numbers are tolerably large, and as they are\r\ndrawn from all parts of England, during several years, we may with much\r\nconfidence conclude that with the domestic horse, or at least with the\r\nrace-horse, the two sexes are produced in almost equal numbers. The\r\nfluctuations in the proportions during successive years are closely\r\nlike those which occur with mankind, when a small and thinly-populated\r\narea is considered; thus in 1856 the male horses were as 107.1, and in\r\n1867 as only 92.6 to 100 females. In the tabulated returns the\r\nproportions vary in cycles, for the males exceeded the females during\r\nsix successive years; and the females exceeded the males during two\r\nperiods each of four years; this, however, may be accidental; at least\r\nI can detect nothing of the kind with man in the decennial table in the\r\nRegistrar’s Report for 1866.\r\n\r\nDOGS.\r\n\r\nDuring a period of twelve years, from 1857 to 1868, the births of a\r\nlarge number of greyhounds, throughout England, were sent to the\r\n‘Field’ newspaper; and I am again indebted to Mr. Tegetmeier for\r\ncarefully tabulating the results. The recorded births were 6878,\r\nconsisting of 3605 males and 3273 females, that is, in the proportion\r\nof 110.1 males to 100 females. The greatest fluctuations occurred in\r\n1864, when the proportion was as 95.3 males, and in 1867, as 116.3\r\nmales to 100 females. The above average proportion of 110.1 to 100 is\r\nprobably nearly correct in the case of the greyhound, but whether it\r\nwould hold with other domesticated breeds is in some degree doubtful.\r\nMr. Cupples has enquired from several great breeders of dogs, and finds\r\nthat all without exception believe that females are produced in excess;\r\nbut he suggests that this belief may have arisen from females being\r\nless valued, and from the consequent disappointment producing a\r\nstronger impression on the mind.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\nThe sexes of sheep are not ascertained by agriculturists until several\r\nmonths after birth, at the period when the males are castrated; so that\r\nthe following returns do not give the proportions at birth. Moreover, I\r\nfind that several great breeders in Scotland, who annually raise some\r\nthousand sheep, are firmly convinced that a larger proportion of males\r\nthan of females die during the first year or two. Therefore the\r\nproportion of males would be somewhat larger at birth than at the age\r\nof castration. This is a remarkable coincidence with what, as we have\r\nseen, occurs with mankind, and both cases probably depend on the same\r\ncause. I have received returns from four gentlemen in England who have\r\nbred Lowland sheep, chiefly Leicesters, during the last ten to sixteen\r\nyears; they amount altogether to 8965 births, consisting of 4407 males\r\nand 4558 females; that is in the proportion of 96.7 males to 100\r\nfemales. With respect to Cheviot and black-faced sheep bred in\r\nScotland, I have received returns from six breeders, two of them on a\r\nlarge scale, chiefly for the years 1867-1869, but some of the returns\r\nextend back to 1862. The total number recorded amounts to 50,685,\r\nconsisting of 25,071 males and 25,614 females or in the proportion of\r\n97.9 males to 100 females. If we take the English and Scotch returns\r\ntogether, the total number amounts to 59,650, consisting of 29,478\r\nmales and 30,172 females, or as 97.7 to 100. So that with sheep at the\r\nage of castration the females are certainly in excess of the males, but\r\nprobably this would not hold good at birth. (59. I am much indebted to\r\nMr. Cupples for having procured for me the above returns from Scotland,\r\nas well as some of the following returns on cattle. Mr. R. Elliot, of\r\nLaighwood, first called my attention to the premature deaths of the\r\nmales, —a statement subsequently confirmed by Mr. Aitchison and others.\r\nTo this latter gentleman, and to Mr. Payan, I owe my thanks for large\r\nreturns as to sheep.)\r\n\r\nOf CATTLE I have received returns from nine gentlemen of 982 births,\r\ntoo few to be trusted; these consisted of 477 bull-calves and 505\r\ncow-calves; i.e., in the proportion of 94.4 males to 100 females. The\r\nRev. W.D. Fox informs me that in 1867 out of 34 calves born on a farm\r\nin Derbyshire only one was a bull. Mr. Harrison Weir has enquired from\r\nseveral breeders of PIGS, and most of them estimate the male to the\r\nfemale births as about 7 to 6. This same gentleman has bred RABBITS for\r\nmany years, and has noticed that a far greater number of bucks are\r\nproduced than does. But estimations are of little value.\r\n\r\nOf mammalia in a state of nature I have been able to learn very little.\r\nIn regard to the common rat, I have received conflicting statements.\r\nMr. R. Elliot, of Laighwood, informs me that a rat-catcher assured him\r\nthat he had always found the males in great excess, even with the young\r\nin the nest. In consequence of this, Mr. Elliot himself subsequently\r\nexamined some hundred old ones, and found the statement true. Mr. F.\r\nBuckland has bred a large number of white rats, and he also believes\r\nthat the males greatly exceed the females. In regard to Moles, it is\r\nsaid that “the males are much more numerous than the females” (60.\r\nBell, ‘History of British Quadrupeds,’ p. 100.): and as the catching of\r\nthese animals is a special occupation, the statement may perhaps be\r\ntrusted. Sir A. Smith, in describing an antelope of S. Africa (61.\r\n‘Illustrations of the Zoology of S. Africa,’ 1849, pl. 29.) (Kobus\r\nellipsiprymnus), remarks, that in the herds of this and other species,\r\nthe males are few in number compared with the females: the natives\r\nbelieve that they are born in this proportion; others believe that the\r\nyounger males are expelled from the herds, and Sir A. Smith says, that\r\nthough he has himself never seen herds consisting of young males alone,\r\nothers affirm that this does occur. It appears probable that the young\r\nwhen expelled from the herd, would often fall a prey to the many beasts\r\nof prey of the country.\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the FOWL, I have received only one account, namely,\r\nthat out of 1001 chickens of a highly-bred stock of Cochins, reared\r\nduring eight years by Mr. Stretch, 487 proved males and 514 females;\r\ni.e., as 94.7 to 100. In regard to domestic pigeons there is good\r\nevidence either that the males are produced in excess, or that they\r\nlive longer; for these birds invariably pair, and single males, as Mr.\r\nTegetmeier informs me, can always be purchased cheaper than females.\r\nUsually the two birds reared from the two eggs laid in the same nest\r\nare a male and a female; but Mr. Harrison Weir, who has been so large a\r\nbreeder, says that he has often bred two cocks from the same nest, and\r\nseldom two hens; moreover, the hen is generally the weaker of the two,\r\nand more liable to perish.\r\n\r\nWith respect to birds in a state of nature, Mr. Gould and others (62.\r\nBrehm (‘Thierleben,’ B. iv. s. 990) comes to the same conclusion.) are\r\nconvinced that the males are generally the more numerous; and as the\r\nyoung males of many species resemble the females, the latter would\r\nnaturally appear to be the more numerous. Large numbers of pheasants\r\nare reared by Mr. Baker of Leadenhall from eggs laid by wild birds, and\r\nhe informs Mr. Jenner Weir that four or five males to one female are\r\ngenerally produced. An experienced observer remarks (63. On the\r\nauthority of L. Lloyd, ‘Game Birds of Sweden,’ 1867, pp. 12, 132.),\r\nthat in Scandinavia the broods of the capercailzie and black-cock\r\ncontain more males than females; and that with the Dal-ripa (a kind of\r\nptarmigan) more males than females attend the leks or places of\r\ncourtship; but this latter circumstance is accounted for by some\r\nobservers by a greater number of hen birds being killed by vermin. From\r\nvarious facts given by White of Selborne (64. ‘Nat. Hist. of Selborne,’\r\nletter xxix. edit. of 1825, vol. i. p. 139.), it seems clear that the\r\nmales of the partridge must be in considerable excess in the south of\r\nEngland; and I have been assured that this is the case in Scotland. Mr.\r\nWeir on enquiring from the dealers, who receive at certain seasons\r\nlarge numbers of ruffs (Machetes pugnax), was told that the males are\r\nmuch the more numerous. This same naturalist has also enquired for me\r\nfrom the birdcatchers, who annually catch an astonishing number of\r\nvarious small species alive for the London market, and he was\r\nunhesitatingly answered by an old and trustworthy man, that with the\r\nchaffinch the males are in large excess: he thought as high as 2 males\r\nto 1 female, or at least as high as 5 to 3. (65. Mr. Jenner Weir\r\nreceived similar information, on making enquiries during the following\r\nyear. To shew the number of living chaffinches caught, I may mention\r\nthat in 1869 there was a match between two experts, and one man caught\r\nin a day 62, and another 40, male chaffinches. The greatest number ever\r\ncaught by one man in a single day was 70.) The males of the blackbird,\r\nhe likewise maintained, were by far the more numerous, whether caught\r\nby traps or by netting at night. These statements may apparently be\r\ntrusted, because this same man said that the sexes are about equal with\r\nthe lark, the twite (Linaria montana), and goldfinch. On the other\r\nhand, he is certain that with the common linnet, the females\r\npreponderate greatly, but unequally during different years; during some\r\nyears he has found the females to the males as four to one. It should,\r\nhowever, be borne in mind, that the chief season for catching birds\r\ndoes not begin till September, so that with some species partial\r\nmigrations may have begun, and the flocks at this period often consist\r\nof hens alone. Mr. Salvin paid particular attention to the sexes of the\r\nhumming-birds in Central America, and is convinced that with most of\r\nthe species the males are in excess; thus one year he procured 204\r\nspecimens belonging to ten species, and these consisted of 166 males\r\nand of only 38 females. With two other species the females were in\r\nexcess: but the proportions apparently vary either during different\r\nseasons or in different localities; for on one occasion the males of\r\nCampylopterus hemileucurus were to the females as 5 to 2, and on\r\nanother occasion (66. ‘Ibis,’ vol. ii. p. 260, as quoted in Gould’s\r\n‘Trochilidae,’ 1861, p. 52. For the foregoing proportions, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Salvin for a table of his results.) in exactly the\r\nreversed ratio. As bearing on this latter point, I may add, that Mr.\r\nPowys found in Corfu and Epirus the sexes of the chaffinch keeping\r\napart, and “the females by far the most numerous”; whilst in Palestine\r\nMr. Tristram found “the male flocks appearing greatly to exceed the\r\nfemale in number.” (67. ‘Ibis,’ 1860, p. 137; and 1867, p. 369.) So\r\nagain with the Quiscalus major, Mr. G. Taylor says, that in Florida\r\nthere were “very few females in proportion to the males,” (68. ‘Ibis,’\r\n1862, p. 187.) whilst in Honduras the proportion was the other way, the\r\nspecies there having the character of a polygamist.\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\nWith fish the proportional numbers of the sexes can be ascertained only\r\nby catching them in the adult or nearly adult state; and there are many\r\ndifficulties in arriving at any just conclusion. (69. Leuckart quotes\r\nBloch (Wagner, ‘Handwörterbuch der Phys.’ B. iv. 1853, s. 775), that\r\nwith fish there are twice as many males as females.) Infertile females\r\nmight readily be mistaken for males, as Dr. Gunther has remarked to me\r\nin regard to trout. With some species the males are believed to die\r\nsoon after fertilising the ova. With many species the males are of much\r\nsmaller size than the females, so that a large number of males would\r\nescape from the same net by which the females were caught. M.\r\nCarbonnier (70. Quoted in the ‘Farmer,’ March 18, 1869, p. 369.), who\r\nhas especially attended to the natural history of the pike (Esox\r\nlucius), states that many males, owing to their small size, are\r\ndevoured by the larger females; and he believes that the males of\r\nalmost all fish are exposed from this same cause to greater danger than\r\nthe females. Nevertheless, in the few cases in which the proportional\r\nnumbers have been actually observed, the males appear to be largely in\r\nexcess. Thus Mr. R. Buist, the superintendent of the Stormontfield\r\nexperiments, says that in 1865, out of 70 salmon first landed for the\r\npurpose of obtaining the ova, upwards of 60 were males. In 1867 he\r\nagain “calls attention to the vast disproportion of the males to the\r\nfemales. We had at the outset at least ten males to one female.”\r\nAfterwards females sufficient for obtaining ova were procured. He adds,\r\n“from the great proportion of the males, they are constantly fighting\r\nand tearing each other on the spawning-beds.” (71. ‘The Stormontfield\r\nPiscicultural Experiments,’ 1866, p. 23. The ‘Field’ newspaper, June\r\n29, 1867.) This disproportion, no doubt, can be accounted for in part,\r\nbut whether wholly is doubtful, by the males ascending the rivers\r\nbefore the females. Mr. F. Buckland remarks in regard to trout, that\r\n“it is a curious fact that the males preponderate very largely in\r\nnumber over the females. It INVARIABLY happens that when the first rush\r\nof fish is made to the net, there will be at least seven or eight males\r\nto one female found captive. I cannot quite account for this; either\r\nthe males are more numerous than the females, or the latter seek safety\r\nby concealment rather than flight.” He then adds, that by carefully\r\nsearching the banks sufficient females for obtaining ova can be found.\r\n(72. ‘Land and Water,’ 1868, p. 41.) Mr. H. Lee informs me that out of\r\n212 trout, taken for this purpose in Lord Portsmouth’s park, 150 were\r\nmales and 62 females.\r\n\r\nThe males of the Cyprinidae likewise seem to be in excess; but several\r\nmembers of this Family, viz., the carp, tench, bream and minnow, appear\r\nregularly to follow the practice, rare in the animal kingdom, of\r\npolyandry; for the female whilst spawning is always attended by two\r\nmales, one on each side, and in the case of the bream by three or four\r\nmales. This fact is so well known, that it is always recommended to\r\nstock a pond with two male tenches to one female, or at least with\r\nthree males to two females. With the minnow, an excellent observer\r\nstates, that on the spawning-beds the males are ten times as numerous\r\nas the females; when a female comes amongst the males, “she is\r\nimmediately pressed closely by a male on each side; and when they have\r\nbeen in that situation for a time, are superseded by other two males.”\r\n(73. Yarrell, ‘Hist. British Fishes,’ vol. i. 1826, p. 307; on the\r\nCyprinus carpio, p. 331; on the Tinca vulgaris, p. 331; on the Abramis\r\nbrama, p. 336. See, for the minnow (Leuciscus phoxinus), ‘Loudon’s\r\nMagazine of Natural History,’ vol. v. 1832, p. 682.)\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\nIn this great Class, the Lepidoptera almost alone afford means for\r\njudging of the proportional numbers of the sexes; for they have been\r\ncollected with special care by many good observers, and have been\r\nlargely bred from the egg or caterpillar state. I had hoped that some\r\nbreeders of silk-moths might have kept an exact record, but after\r\nwriting to France and Italy, and consulting various treatises, I cannot\r\nfind that this has ever been done. The general opinion appears to be\r\nthat the sexes are nearly equal, but in Italy, as I hear from Professor\r\nCanestrini, many breeders are convinced that the females are produced\r\nin excess. This same naturalist, however, informs me, that in the two\r\nyearly broods of the Ailanthus silk-moth (Bombyx cynthia), the males\r\ngreatly preponderate in the first, whilst in the second the two sexes\r\nare nearly equal, or the females rather in excess.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Butterflies in a state of nature, several observers have\r\nbeen much struck by the apparently enormous preponderance of the males.\r\n(74. Leuckart quotes Meinecke (Wagner, ‘Handwörterbuch der Phys.’ B.\r\niv. 1853, s. 775) that the males of Butterflies are three or four times\r\nas numerous as the females.) Thus Mr. Bates (75. ‘The Naturalist on the\r\nAmazons,’ vol. ii. 1863, pp. 228, 347.), in speaking of several\r\nspecies, about a hundred in number, which inhabit the upper Amazons,\r\nsays that the males are much more numerous than the females, even in\r\nthe proportion of a hundred to one. In North America, Edwards, who had\r\ngreat experience, estimates in the genus Papilio the males to the\r\nfemales as four to one; and Mr. Walsh, who informed me of this\r\nstatement, says that with P. turnus this is certainly the case. In\r\nSouth Africa, Mr. R. Trimen found the males in excess in 19 species\r\n(76. Four of these cases are given by Mr. Trimen in his ‘Rhopalocera\r\nAfricae Australis.’); and in one of these, which swarms in open places,\r\nhe estimated the number of males as fifty to one female. With another\r\nspecies, in which the males are numerous in certain localities, he\r\ncollected only five females during seven years. In the island of\r\nBourbon, M. Maillard states that the males of one species of Papilio\r\nare twenty times as numerous as the females. (77. Quoted by Trimen,\r\n‘Transactions of the Ent. Society,’ vol. v. part iv. 1866, p. 330.) Mr.\r\nTrimen informs me that as far as he has himself seen, or heard from\r\nothers, it is rare for the females of any butterfly to exceed the males\r\nin number; but three South African species perhaps offer an exception.\r\nMr. Wallace (78. ‘Transactions, Linnean Society,’ vol. xxv. p. 37.)\r\nstates that the females of Ornithoptera croesus, in the Malay\r\narchipelago, are more common and more easily caught than the males; but\r\nthis is a rare butterfly. I may here add, that in Hyperythra, a genus\r\nof moths, Guenee says, that from four to five females are sent in\r\ncollections from India for one male.\r\n\r\nWhen this subject of the proportional numbers of the sexes of insects\r\nwas brought before the Entomological Society (79. ‘Proceedings,\r\nEntomological Society,’ Feb. 17, 1868.), it was generally admitted that\r\nthe males of most Lepidoptera, in the adult or imago state, are caught\r\nin greater numbers than the females: but this fact was attributed by\r\nvarious observers to the more retiring habits of the females, and to\r\nthe males emerging earlier from the cocoon. This latter circumstance is\r\nwell known to occur with most Lepidoptera, as well as with other\r\ninsects. So that, as M. Personnat remarks, the males of the\r\ndomesticated Bombyx Yamamai, are useless at the beginning of the\r\nseason, and the females at the end, from the want of mates. (80. Quoted\r\nby Dr. Wallace in ‘Proceedings, Entomological Society,’ 3rd series,\r\nvol. v. 1867, p. 487.) I cannot, however, persuade myself that these\r\ncauses suffice to explain the great excess of males, in the above cases\r\nof certain butterflies which are extremely common in their native\r\ncountries. Mr. Stainton, who has paid very close attention during many\r\nyears to the smaller moths, informs me that when he collected them in\r\nthe imago state, he thought that the males were ten times as numerous\r\nas the females, but that since he has reared them on a large scale from\r\nthe caterpillar state, he is convinced that the females are the more\r\nnumerous. Several entomologists concur in this view. Mr. Doubleday,\r\nhowever, and some others, take an opposite view, and are convinced that\r\nthey have reared from the eggs and caterpillars a larger proportion of\r\nmales than of females.\r\n\r\nBesides the more active habits of the males, their earlier emergence\r\nfrom the cocoon, and in some cases their frequenting more open\r\nstations, other causes may be assigned for an apparent or real\r\ndifference in the proportional numbers of the sexes of Lepidoptera,\r\nwhen captured in the imago state, and when reared from the egg or\r\ncaterpillar state. I hear from Professor Canestrini, that it is\r\nbelieved by many breeders in Italy, that the female caterpillar of the\r\nsilk-moth suffers more from the recent disease than the male; and Dr.\r\nStaudinger informs me that in rearing Lepidoptera more females die in\r\nthe cocoon than males. With many species the female caterpillar is\r\nlarger than the male, and a collector would naturally choose the finest\r\nspecimens, and thus unintentionally collect a larger number of females.\r\nThree collectors have told me that this was their practice; but Dr.\r\nWallace is sure that most collectors take all the specimens which they\r\ncan find of the rarer kinds, which alone are worth the trouble of\r\nrearing. Birds when surrounded by caterpillars would probably devour\r\nthe largest; and Professor Canestrini informs me that in Italy some\r\nbreeders believe, though on insufficient evidence, that in the first\r\nbroods of the Ailanthus silk-moth, the wasps destroy a larger number of\r\nthe female than of the male caterpillars. Dr. Wallace further remarks\r\nthat female caterpillars, from being larger than the males, require\r\nmore time for their development, and consume more food and moisture:\r\nand thus they would be exposed during a longer time to danger from\r\nichneumons, birds, etc., and in times of scarcity would perish in\r\ngreater numbers. Hence it appears quite possible that in a state of\r\nnature, fewer female Lepidoptera may reach maturity than males; and for\r\nour special object we are concerned with their relative numbers at\r\nmaturity, when the sexes are ready to propagate their kind.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the males of certain moths congregate in\r\nextraordinary numbers round a single female, apparently indicates a\r\ngreat excess of males, though this fact may perhaps be accounted for by\r\nthe earlier emergence of the males from their cocoons. Mr. Stainton\r\ninforms me that from twelve to twenty males, may often be seen\r\ncongregated round a female Elachista rufocinerea. It is well known that\r\nif a virgin Lasiocampa quercus or Saturnia carpini be exposed in a\r\ncage, vast numbers of males collect round her, and if confined in a\r\nroom will even come down the chimney to her. Mr. Doubleday believes\r\nthat he has seen from fifty to a hundred males of both these species\r\nattracted in the course of a single day by a female in confinement. In\r\nthe Isle of Wight Mr. Trimen exposed a box in which a female of the\r\nLasiocampa had been confined on the previous day, and five males soon\r\nendeavoured to gain admittance. In Australia, Mr. Verreaux, having\r\nplaced the female of a small Bombyx in a box in his pocket, was\r\nfollowed by a crowd of males, so that about 200 entered the house with\r\nhim. (81. Blanchard, ‘Metamorphoses, Moeurs des Insectes,’ 1868, pp.\r\n225-226.)\r\n\r\nMr. Doubleday has called my attention to M. Staudinger’s (82.\r\n‘Lepidopteren-Doubletten Liste,’ Berlin, No. x. 1866.) list of\r\nLepidoptera, which gives the prices of the males and females of 300\r\nspecies or well-marked varieties of butterflies (Rhopalocera). The\r\nprices for both sexes of the very common species are of course the\r\nsame; but in 114 of the rarer species they differ; the males being in\r\nall cases, excepting one, the cheaper. On an average of the prices of\r\nthe 113 species, the price of the male to that of the female is as 100\r\nto 149; and this apparently indicates that inversely the males exceed\r\nthe females in the same proportion. About 2000 species or varieties of\r\nmoths (Heterocera) are catalogued, those with wingless females being\r\nhere excluded on account of the difference in habits between the two\r\nsexes: of these 2000 species, 141 differ in price according to sex, the\r\nmales of 130 being cheaper, and those of only 11 being dearer than the\r\nfemales. The average price of the males of the 130 species, to that of\r\nthe females, is as 100 to 143. With respect to the butterflies in this\r\npriced list, Mr. Doubleday thinks (and no man in England has had more\r\nexperience), that there is nothing in the habits of the species which\r\ncan account for the difference in the prices of the two sexes, and that\r\nit can be accounted for only by an excess in the number of the males.\r\nBut I am bound to add that Dr. Staudinger informs me, that he is\r\nhimself of a different opinion. He thinks that the less active habits\r\nof the females and the earlier emergence of the males will account for\r\nhis collectors securing a larger number of males than of females, and\r\nconsequently for the lower prices of the former. With respect to\r\nspecimens reared from the caterpillar-state, Dr. Staudinger believes,\r\nas previously stated, that a greater number of females than of males\r\ndie whilst confined to the cocoons. He adds that with certain species\r\none sex seems to preponderate over the other during certain years.\r\n\r\nOf direct observations on the sexes of Lepidoptera, reared either from\r\neggs or caterpillars, I have received only the few following cases:\r\n(See following table.)\r\n\r\nSo that in these eight lots of cocoons and eggs, males were produced in\r\nexcess. Taken together the proportion of males is as 122.7 to 100\r\nfemales. But the numbers are hardly large enough to be trustworthy.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, from these various sources of evidence, all pointing in\r\nthe same direction, I infer that with most species of Lepidoptera, the\r\nmature males generally exceed the females in number, whatever the\r\nproportions may be at their first emergence from the egg.\r\n\r\n                                                   Males   Females\r\n  The Rev.

This naturalist has been so kind as to send me some results from\r\nformer years, in which the females seemed to preponderate; but so many\r\nof the figures were estimates, that I found it impossible to tabulate\r\nthem.)\r\n\r\nWith reference to the other Orders of insects, I have been able to\r\ncollect very little reliable information. With the stag-beetle (Lucanus\r\ncervus) “the males appear to be much more numerous than the females”;\r\nbut when, as Cornelius remarked during 1867, an unusual number of these\r\nbeetles appeared in one part of Germany, the females appeared to exceed\r\nthe males as six to one. With one of the Elateridae, the males are said\r\nto be much more numerous than the females, and “two or three are often\r\nfound united with one female (84. Gunther’s ‘Record of Zoological\r\nLiterature,’ 1867, p. 260. On the excess of female Lucanus, ibid, p.\r\n250. On the males of Lucanus in England, Westwood,’ ‘Modern\r\nClassification of Insects,’ vol. i. p. 187. On the Siagonium, ibid. p.\r\n172.); so that here polyandry seems to prevail.” With Siagonium\r\n(Staphylinidae), in which the males are furnished with horns, “the\r\nfemales are far more numerous than the opposite sex.” Mr. Janson stated\r\nat the Entomological Society that the females of the bark feeding\r\nTomicus villosus are so common as to be a plague, whilst the males are\r\nso rare as to be hardly known.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while saying anything about the proportion of the\r\nsexes in certain species and even groups of insects, for the males are\r\nunknown or very rare, and the females are parthenogenetic, that is,\r\nfertile without sexual union; examples of this are afforded by several\r\nof the Cynipidae. (85. Walsh in ‘The American Entomologist,’ vol. i.\r\n1869, p. 103. F. Smith, ‘Record of Zoological Lit.’ 1867, p. 328.) In\r\nall the gall-making Cynipidae known to Mr. Walsh, the females are four\r\nor five times as numerous as the males; and so it is, as he informs me,\r\nwith the gall-making Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). With some common species\r\nof Saw-flies (Tenthredinae) Mr. F. Smith has reared hundreds of\r\nspecimens from larvae of all sizes, but has never reared a single male;\r\non the other hand, Curtis says (86. ‘Farm Insects,’ pp. 45-46.), that\r\nwith certain species (Athalia), bred by him, the males were to the\r\nfemales as six to one; whilst exactly the reverse occurred with the\r\nmature insects of the same species caught in the fields. In the family\r\nof bees, Hermann Müller (87. ‘Anwendung der Darwin’schen Lehre,’ Verh.\r\nd. n. Jahrg., xxiv.), collected a large number of specimens of many\r\nspecies, and reared others from the cocoons, and counted the sexes. He\r\nfound that the males of some species greatly exceeded the females in\r\nnumber; in others the reverse occurred; and in others the two sexes\r\nwere nearly equal. But as in most cases the males emerge from the\r\ncocoons before the females, they are at the commencement of the\r\nbreeding-season practically in excess. Müller also observed that the\r\nrelative number of the two sexes in some species differed much in\r\ndifferent localities. But as H. Müller has himself remarked to me,\r\nthese remarks must be received with some caution, as one sex might more\r\neasily escape observation than the other. Thus his brother Fritz Müller\r\nhas noticed in Brazil that the two sexes of the same species of bee\r\nsometimes frequent different kinds of flowers. With respect to the\r\nOrthoptera, I know hardly anything about the relative number of the\r\nsexes: Korte (88. ‘Die Strich, Zug oder Wanderheuschrecke,’ 1828, p.\r\n20.), however, says that out of 500 locusts which he examined, the\r\nmales were to the females as five to six. With the Neuroptera, Mr.\r\nWalsh states that in many, but by no means in all the species of the\r\nOdonatous group, there is a great overplus of males: in the genus\r\nHetaerina, also, the males are generally at least four times as\r\nnumerous as the females. In certain species in the genus Gomphus the\r\nmales are equally in excess, whilst in two other species, the females\r\nare twice or thrice as numerous as the males. In some European species\r\nof Psocus thousands of females may be collected without a single male,\r\nwhilst with other species of the same genus both sexes are common. (89.\r\n‘Observations on N. American Neuroptera,’ by H. Hagen and B.D. Walsh,\r\n‘Proceedings, Ent. Soc. Philadelphia,’ Oct. 1863, pp. 168, 223, 239.)\r\nIn England, Mr. MacLachlan has captured hundreds of the female Apatania\r\nmuliebris, but has never seen the male; and of Boreus hyemalis only\r\nfour or five males have been seen here. (90. ‘Proceedings, Ent. Soc.\r\nLondon,’ Feb. 17, 1868.) With most of these species (excepting the\r\nTenthredinae) there is at present no evidence that the females are\r\nsubject to parthenogenesis; and thus we see how ignorant we are of the\r\ncauses of the apparent discrepancy in the proportion of the two sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the other classes of the Articulata I have been able to collect\r\nstill less information. With spiders, Mr. Blackwall, who has carefully\r\nattended to this class during many years, writes to me that the males\r\nfrom their more erratic habits are more commonly seen, and therefore\r\nappear more numerous. This is actually the case with a few species; but\r\nhe mentions several species in six genera, in which the females appear\r\nto be much more numerous than the males. (91. Another great authority\r\nwith respect to this class, Prof. Thorell of Upsala (‘On European\r\nSpiders,’ 1869-70, part i. p. 205), speaks as if female spiders were\r\ngenerally commoner than the males.) The small size of the males in\r\ncomparison with the females (a peculiarity which is sometimes carried\r\nto an extreme degree), and their widely different appearance, may\r\naccount in some instances for their rarity in collections. (92. See, on\r\nthis subject, Mr. O.P. Cambridge, as quoted in ‘Quarterly Journal of\r\nScience,’ 1868, page 429.)\r\n\r\nSome of the lower Crustaceans are able to propagate their kind\r\nsexually, and this will account for the extreme rarity of the males;\r\nthus von Siebold (93. ‘Beiträge zur Parthenogenesis,’ p. 174.)\r\ncarefully examined no less than 13,000 specimens of Apus from\r\ntwenty-one localities, and amongst these he found only 319 males. With\r\nsome other forms (as Tanais and Cypris), as Fritz Müller informs me,\r\nthere is reason to believe that the males are much shorter-lived than\r\nthe females; and this would explain their scarcity, supposing the two\r\nsexes to be at first equal in number. On the other hand, Müller has\r\ninvariably taken far more males than females of the Diastylidae and of\r\nCypridina on the shores of Brazil: thus with a species in the latter\r\ngenus, 63 specimens caught the same day included 57 males; but he\r\nsuggests that this preponderance may be due to some unknown difference\r\nin the habits of the two sexes. With one of the higher Brazilian crabs,\r\nnamely a Gelasimus, Fritz Müller found the males to be more numerous\r\nthan the females. According to the large experience of Mr. C. Spence\r\nBate, the reverse seems to be the case with six common British crabs,\r\nthe names of which he has given me.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES IN RELATION TO NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect that in some cases man has by selection\r\nindirectly influenced his own sex-producing powers. Certain women tend\r\nto produce during their whole lives more children of one sex than of\r\nthe other: and the same holds good of many animals, for instance, cows\r\nand horses; thus Mr. Wright of Yeldersley House informs me that one of\r\nhis Arab mares, though put seven times to different horses, produced\r\nseven fillies. Though I have very little evidence on this head, analogy\r\nwould lead to the belief, that the tendency to produce either sex would\r\nbe inherited like almost every other peculiarity, for instance, that of\r\nproducing twins; and concerning the above tendency a good authority,\r\nMr. J. Downing, has communicated to me facts which seem to prove that\r\nthis does occur in certain families of short-horn cattle. Col. Marshall\r\n(94. ‘The Todas,’ 1873, pp. 100, 111, 194, 196.) has recently found on\r\ncareful examination that the Todas, a hill-tribe of India, consist of\r\n112 males and 84 females of all ages—that is in a ratio of 133.3 males\r\nto 100 females. The Todas, who are polyandrous in their marriages,\r\nduring former times invariably practised female infanticide; but this\r\npractice has now been discontinued for a considerable period. Of the\r\nchildren born within late years, the males are more numerous than the\r\nfemales, in the proportion of 124 to 100. Colonel Marshall accounts for\r\nthis fact in the following ingenious manner. “Let us for the purpose of\r\nillustration take three families as representing an average of the\r\nentire tribe; say that one mother gives birth to six daughters and no\r\nsons; a second mother has six sons only, whilst the third mother has\r\nthree sons and three daughters. The first mother, following the tribal\r\ncustom, destroys four daughters and preserves two. The second retains\r\nher six sons. The third kills two daughters and keeps one, as also her\r\nthree sons. We have then from the three families, nine sons and three\r\ndaughters, with which to continue the breed. But whilst the males\r\nbelong to families in which the tendency to produce sons is great, the\r\nfemales are of those of a converse inclination. Thus the bias\r\nstrengthens with each generation, until, as we find, families grow to\r\nhave habitually more sons than daughters.”\r\n\r\nThat this result would follow from the above form of infanticide seems\r\nalmost certain; that is if we assume that a sex-producing tendency is\r\ninherited. But as the above numbers are so extremely scanty, I have\r\nsearched for additional evidence, but cannot decide whether what I have\r\nfound is trustworthy; nevertheless the facts are, perhaps, worth\r\ngiving. The Maories of New Zealand have long practised infanticide; and\r\nMr. Fenton (95. ‘Aboriginal Inhabitants of New Zealand: Government\r\nReport,’ 1859, p. 36.) states that he “has met with instances of women\r\nwho have destroyed four, six, and even seven children, mostly females.\r\nHowever, the universal testimony of those best qualified to judge, is\r\nconclusive that this custom has for many years been almost extinct.\r\nProbably the year 1835 may be named as the period of its ceasing to\r\nexist.” Now amongst the New Zealanders, as with the Todas, male births\r\nare considerably in excess. Mr. Fenton remarks (p. 30), “One fact is\r\ncertain, although the exact period of the commencement of this singular\r\ncondition of the disproportion of the sexes cannot be demonstratively\r\nfixed, it is quite clear that this course of decrease was in full\r\noperation during the years 1830 to 1844, when the non-adult population\r\nof 1844 was being produced, and has continued with great energy up to\r\nthe present time.” The following statements are taken from Mr. Fenton\r\n(p. 26), but as the numbers are not large, and as the census was not\r\naccurate, uniform results cannot be expected. It should be borne in\r\nmind in this and the following cases, that the normal state of every\r\npopulation is an excess of women, at least in all civilised countries,\r\nchiefly owing to the greater mortality of the male sex during youth,\r\nand partly to accidents of all kinds later in life. In 1858, the native\r\npopulation of New Zealand was estimated as consisting of 31,667 males\r\nand 24,303 females of all ages, that is in the ratio of 130.3 males to\r\n100 females. But during this same year, and in certain limited\r\ndistricts, the numbers were ascertained with much care, and the males\r\nof all ages were here 753 and the females 616; that is in the ratio of\r\n122.2 males to 100 females. It is more important for us that during\r\nthis same year of 1858, the NON-ADULT males within the same district\r\nwere found to be 178, and the NON-ADULT females 142, that is in the\r\nratio of 125.3 to 100. It may be added that in 1844, at which period\r\nfemale infanticide had only lately ceased, the NON-ADULT males in one\r\ndistrict were 281, and the NON-ADULT females only 194, that is in the\r\nratio of 144.8 males to 100 females.\r\n\r\nIn the Sandwich Islands, the males exceed the females in number.\r\nInfanticide was formerly practised there to a frightful extent, but was\r\nby no means confined to female infants, as is shewn by Mr. Ellis (96.\r\n‘Narrative of a Tour through Hawaii,’ 1826, p. 298.), and as I have\r\nbeen informed by Bishop Staley and the Rev. Mr. Coan. Nevertheless,\r\nanother apparently trustworthy writer, Mr. Jarves (97. ‘History of the\r\nSandwich Islands,’ 1843, p. 93.), whose observations apply to the whole\r\narchipelago, remarks:—“Numbers of women are to be found, who confess to\r\nthe murder of from three to six or eight children,” and he adds,\r\n“females from being considered less useful than males were more often\r\ndestroyed.” From what is known to occur in other parts of the world,\r\nthis statement is probable; but must be received with much caution. The\r\npractice of infanticide ceased about the year 1819, when idolatry was\r\nabolished and missionaries settled in the Islands. A careful census in\r\n1839 of the adult and taxable men and women in the island of Kauai and\r\nin one district of Oahu (Jarves, p. 404), gives 4723 males and 3776\r\nfemales; that is in the ratio of 125.08 to 100. At the same time the\r\nnumber of males under fourteen years in Kauai and under eighteen in\r\nOahu was 1797, and of females of the same ages 1429; and here we have\r\nthe ratio of 125.75 males to 100 females.\r\n\r\nIn a census of all the islands in 1850 (98. This is given in the Rev.\r\nH.T. Cheever’s ‘Life in the Sandwich Islands,’ 1851, p. 277.), the\r\nmales of all ages amount to 36,272, and the females to 33,128, or as\r\n109.49 to 100. The males under seventeen years amounted to 10,773, and\r\nthe females under the same age to 9593, or as 112.3 to 100. From the\r\ncensus of 1872, the proportion of males of all ages (including\r\nhalf-castes) to females, is as 125.36 to 100. It must be borne in mind\r\nthat all these returns for the Sandwich Islands give the proportion of\r\nliving males to living females, and not of the births; and judging from\r\nall civilised countries the proportion of males would have been\r\nconsiderably higher if the numbers had referred to births. (99. Dr.\r\nCoulter, in describing (‘Journal R. Geograph. Soc.’ vol. v. 1835, p.\r\n67) the state of California about the year 1830, says that the natives,\r\nreclaimed by the Spanish missionaries, have nearly all perished, or are\r\nperishing, although well treated, not driven from their native land,\r\nand kept from the use of spirits. He attributes this, in great part, to\r\nthe undoubted fact that the men greatly exceed the women in number; but\r\nhe does not know whether this is due to a failure of female offspring,\r\nor to more females dying during early youth. The latter alternative,\r\naccording to all analogy, is very improbable. He adds that\r\n“infanticide, properly so called, is not common, though very frequent\r\nrecourse is had to abortion.” If Dr. Coulter is correct about\r\ninfanticide, this case cannot be advanced in support of Colonel\r\nMarshall’s view. From the rapid decrease of the reclaimed natives, we\r\nmay suspect that, as in the cases lately given, their fertility has\r\nbeen diminished from changed habits of life.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to gain some light on this subject from the breeding of\r\ndogs; inasmuch as in most breeds, with the exception, perhaps, of\r\ngreyhounds, many more female puppies are destroyed than males, just as\r\nwith the Toda infants. Mr. Cupples assures me that this is usual with\r\nScotch deer-hounds. Unfortunately, I know nothing of the proportion of\r\nthe sexes in any breed, excepting greyhounds, and there the male births\r\nare to the females as 110.1 to 100. Now from enquiries made from many\r\nbreeders, it seems that the females are in some respects more esteemed,\r\nthough otherwise troublesome; and it does not appear that the female\r\npuppies of the best-bred dogs are systematically destroyed more than\r\nthe males, though this does sometimes take place to a limited extent.\r\nTherefore I am unable to decide whether we can, on the above\r\nprinciples, account for the preponderance of male births in greyhounds.\r\nOn the other hand, we have seen that with horses, cattle, and sheep,\r\nwhich are too valuable for the young of either sex to be destroyed, if\r\nthere is any difference, the females are slightly in excess.)\r\n\r\nFrom the several foregoing cases we have some reason to believe that\r\ninfanticide practised in the manner above explained, tends to make a\r\nmale-producing race; but I am far from supposing that this practice in\r\nthe case of man, or some analogous process with other species, has been\r\nthe sole determining cause of an excess of males. There may be some\r\nunknown law leading to this result in decreasing races, which have\r\nalready become somewhat infertile. Besides the several causes\r\npreviously alluded to, the greater facility of parturition amongst\r\nsavages, and the less consequent injury to their male infants, would\r\ntend to increase the proportion of live-born males to females. There\r\ndoes not, however, seem to be any necessary connection between savage\r\nlife and a marked excess of males; that is if we may judge by the\r\ncharacter of the scanty offspring of the lately existing Tasmanians and\r\nof the crossed offspring of the Tahitians now inhabiting Norfolk\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nAs the males and females of many animals differ somewhat in habits and\r\nare exposed in different degrees to danger, it is probable that in many\r\ncases, more of one sex than of the other are habitually destroyed. But\r\nas far as I can trace out the complication of causes, an indiscriminate\r\nthough large destruction of either sex would not tend to modify the\r\nsex-producing power of the species. With strictly social animals, such\r\nas bees or ants, which produce a vast number of sterile and fertile\r\nfemales in comparison with the males, and to whom this preponderance is\r\nof paramount importance, we can see that those communities would\r\nflourish best which contained females having a strong inherited\r\ntendency to produce more and more females; and in such cases an unequal\r\nsex-producing tendency would be ultimately gained through natural\r\nselection. With animals living in herds or troops, in which the males\r\ncome to the front and defend the herd, as with the bisons of North\r\nAmerica and certain baboons, it is conceivable that a male-producing\r\ntendency might be gained by natural selection; for the individuals of\r\nthe better defended herds would leave more numerous descendants. In the\r\ncase of mankind the advantage arising from having a preponderance of\r\nmen in the tribe is supposed to be one chief cause of the practice of\r\nfemale infanticide.\r\n\r\nIn no case, as far as we can see, would an inherited tendency to\r\nproduce both sexes in equal numbers or to produce one sex in excess, be\r\na direct advantage or disadvantage to certain individuals more than to\r\nothers; for instance, an individual with a tendency to produce more\r\nmales than females would not succeed better in the battle for life than\r\nan individual with an opposite tendency; and therefore a tendency of\r\nthis kind could not be gained through natural selection. Nevertheless,\r\nthere are certain animals (for instance, fishes and cirripedes) in\r\nwhich two or more males appear to be necessary for the fertilisation of\r\nthe female; and the males accordingly largely preponderate, but it is\r\nby no means obvious how this male-producing tendency could have been\r\nacquired. I formerly thought that when a tendency to produce the two\r\nsexes in equal numbers was advantageous to the species, it would follow\r\nfrom natural selection, but I now see that the whole problem is so\r\nintricate that it is safer to leave its solution for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS IN THE LOWER CLASSES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese characters absent in the lowest classes—Brilliant\r\ncolours—Mollusca —Annelids—Crustacea, secondary sexual characters\r\nstrongly developed; dimorphism; colour; characters not acquired before\r\nmaturity—Spiders, sexual colours of; stridulation by the\r\nmales—Myriapoda.\r\n\r\nWith animals belonging to the lower classes, the two sexes are not\r\nrarely united in the same individual, and therefore secondary sexual\r\ncharacters cannot be developed. In many cases where the sexes are\r\nseparate, both are permanently attached to some support, and the one\r\ncannot search or struggle for the other. Moreover it is almost certain\r\nthat these animals have too imperfect senses and much too low mental\r\npowers to appreciate each other’s beauty or other attractions, or to\r\nfeel rivalry.\r\n\r\nHence in these classes or sub-kingdoms, such as the Protozoa,\r\nCoelenterata, Echinodermata, Scolecida, secondary sexual characters, of\r\nthe kind which we have to consider, do not occur: and this fact agrees\r\nwith the belief that such characters in the higher classes have been\r\nacquired through sexual selection, which depends on the will, desire,\r\nand choice of either sex. Nevertheless some few apparent exceptions\r\noccur; thus, as I hear from Dr. Baird, the males of certain Entozoa, or\r\ninternal parasitic worms, differ slightly in colour from the females;\r\nbut we have no reason to suppose that such differences have been\r\naugmented through sexual selection. Contrivances by which the male\r\nholds the female, and which are indispensable for the propagation of\r\nthe species, are independent of sexual selection, and have been\r\nacquired through ordinary selection.\r\n\r\nMany of the lower animals, whether hermaphrodites or with separate\r\nsexes, are ornamented with the most brilliant tints, or are shaded and\r\nstriped in an elegant manner; for instance, many corals and\r\nsea-anemones (Actiniae), some jelly-fish (Medusae, Porpita, etc.), some\r\nPlanariae, many star-fishes, Echini, Ascidians, etc.; but we may\r\nconclude from the reasons already indicated, namely, the union of the\r\ntwo sexes in some of these animals, the permanently affixed condition\r\nof others, and the low mental powers of all, that such colours do not\r\nserve as a sexual attraction, and have not been acquired through sexual\r\nselection. It should be borne in mind that in no case have we\r\nsufficient evidence that colours have been thus acquired, except where\r\none sex is much more brilliantly or conspicuously coloured than the\r\nother, and where there is no difference in habits between the sexes\r\nsufficient to account for their different colours. But the evidence is\r\nrendered as complete as it can ever be, only when the more ornamented\r\nindividuals, almost always the males, voluntarily display their\r\nattractions before the other sex; for we cannot believe that such\r\ndisplay is useless, and if it be advantageous, sexual selection will\r\nalmost inevitably follow. We may, however, extend this conclusion to\r\nboth sexes, when coloured alike, if their colours are plainly analogous\r\nto those of one sex alone in certain other species of the same group.\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to account for the beautiful or even gorgeous colours\r\nof many animals in the lowest classes? It appears doubtful whether such\r\ncolours often serve as a protection; but that we may easily err on this\r\nhead, will be admitted by every one who reads Mr. Wallace’s excellent\r\nessay on this subject. It would not, for instance, at first occur to\r\nany one that the transparency of the Medusae, or jelly-fish, is of the\r\nhighest service to them as a protection; but when we are reminded by\r\nHaeckel that not only the Medusae, but many floating Mollusca,\r\ncrustaceans, and even small oceanic fishes partake of this same\r\nglass-like appearance, often accompanied by prismatic colours, we can\r\nhardly doubt that they thus escape the notice of pelagic birds and\r\nother enemies. M. Giard is also convinced (1. ‘Archives de Zoolog.\r\nExper.’ Oct. 1872, p. 563.) that the bright tints of certain sponges\r\nand ascidians serve as a protection. Conspicuous colours are likewise\r\nbeneficial to many animals as a warning to their would-be devourers\r\nthat they are distasteful, or that they possess some special means of\r\ndefence; but this subject will be discussed more conveniently\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nWe can, in our ignorance of most of the lowest animals, only say that\r\ntheir bright tints result either from the chemical nature or the minute\r\nstructure of their tissues, independently of any benefit thus derived.\r\nHardly any colour is finer than that of arterial blood; but there is no\r\nreason to suppose that the colour of the blood is in itself any\r\nadvantage; and though it adds to the beauty of the maiden’s cheek, no\r\none will pretend that it has been acquired for this purpose. So again\r\nwith many animals, especially the lower ones, the bile is richly\r\ncoloured; thus, as I am informed by Mr. Hancock, the extreme beauty of\r\nthe Eolidae (naked sea-slugs) is chiefly due to the biliary glands\r\nbeing seen through the translucent integuments—this beauty being\r\nprobably of no service to these animals. The tints of the decaying\r\nleaves in an American forest are described by every one as gorgeous;\r\nyet no one supposes that these tints are of the least advantage to the\r\ntrees. Bearing in mind how many substances closely analogous to natural\r\norganic compounds have been recently formed by chemists, and which\r\nexhibit the most splendid colours, it would have been a strange fact if\r\nsubstances similarly coloured had not often originated, independently\r\nof any useful end thus gained, in the complex laboratory of living\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nTHE SUB-KINGDOM OF THE MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\nThroughout this great division of the animal kingdom, as far as I can\r\ndiscover, secondary sexual characters, such as we are here considering,\r\nnever occur. Nor could they be expected in the three lowest classes,\r\nnamely, in the Ascidians, Polyzoa, and Brachiopods (constituting the\r\nMolluscoida of some authors), for most of these animals are permanently\r\naffixed to a support or have their sexes united in the same individual.\r\nIn the Lamellibranchiata, or bivalve shells, hermaphroditism is not\r\nrare. In the next higher class of the Gasteropoda, or univalve shells,\r\nthe sexes are either united or separate. But in the latter case the\r\nmales never possess special organs for finding, securing, or charming\r\nthe females, or for fighting with other males. As I am informed by Mr.\r\nGwyn Jeffreys, the sole external difference between the sexes consists\r\nin the shell sometimes differing a little in form; for instance, the\r\nshell of the male periwinkle (Littorina littorea) is narrower and has a\r\nmore elongated spire than that of the female. But differences of this\r\nnature, it may be presumed, are directly connected with the act of\r\nreproduction, or with the development of the ova.\r\n\r\nThe Gasteropoda, though capable of locomotion and furnished with\r\nimperfect eyes, do not appear to be endowed with sufficient mental\r\npowers for the members of the same sex to struggle together in rivalry,\r\nand thus to acquire secondary sexual characters. Nevertheless with the\r\npulmoniferous gasteropods, or land-snails, the pairing is preceded by\r\ncourtship; for these animals, though hermaphrodites, are compelled by\r\ntheir structure to pair together. Agassiz remarks, “Quiconque a eu\r\nl’occasion d’observer les amours des limaçons, ne saurait mettre en\r\ndoute la séduction deployée dans les mouvements et les allures qui\r\npréparent et accomplissent le double embrassement de ces\r\nhermaphrodites.” (2. ‘De l’Espèce et de la Class.’ etc., 1869, p. 106.)\r\nThese animals appear also susceptible of some degree of permanent\r\nattachment: an accurate observer, Mr. Lonsdale, informs me that he\r\nplaced a pair of land-snails, (Helix pomatia), one of which was weakly,\r\ninto a small and ill-provided garden. After a short time the strong and\r\nhealthy individual disappeared, and was traced by its track of slime\r\nover a wall into an adjoining well-stocked garden. Mr. Lonsdale\r\nconcluded that it had deserted its sickly mate; but after an absence of\r\ntwenty-four hours it returned, and apparently communicated the result\r\nof its successful exploration, for both then started along the same\r\ntrack and disappeared over the wall.\r\n\r\nEven in the highest class of the Mollusca, the Cephalopoda or\r\ncuttle-fishes, in which the sexes are separate, secondary sexual\r\ncharacters of the present kind do not, as far as I can discover, occur.\r\nThis is a surprising circumstance, as these animals possess\r\nhighly-developed sense-organs and have considerable mental powers, as\r\nwill be admitted by every one who has watched their artful endeavours\r\nto escape from an enemy. (3. See, for instance, the account which I\r\nhave given in my ‘Journal of Researches,’ 1845, p. 7.) Certain\r\nCephalopoda, however, are characterised by one extraordinary sexual\r\ncharacter, namely that the male element collects within one of the arms\r\nor tentacles, which is then cast off, and clinging by its sucking-discs\r\nto the female, lives for a time an independent life. So completely does\r\nthe cast-off arm resemble a separate animal, that it was described by\r\nCuvier as a parasitic worm under the name of Hectocotyle. But this\r\nmarvellous structure may be classed as a primary rather than as a\r\nsecondary sexual character.\r\n\r\nAlthough with the Mollusca sexual selection does not seem to have come\r\ninto play; yet many univalve and bivalve shells, such as volutes,\r\ncones, scallops, etc., are beautifully coloured and shaped. The colours\r\ndo not appear in most cases to be of any use as a protection; they are\r\nprobably the direct result, as in the lowest classes, of the nature of\r\nthe tissues; the patterns and the sculpture of the shell depending on\r\nits manner of growth. The amount of light seems to be influential to a\r\ncertain extent; for although, as repeatedly stated by Mr. Gwyn\r\nJeffreys, the shells of some species living at a profound depth are\r\nbrightly coloured, yet we generally see the lower surfaces, as well as\r\nthe parts covered by the mantle, less highly-coloured than the upper\r\nand exposed surfaces. (4. I have given (‘Geological Observations on\r\nVolcanic Islands,’ 1844, p. 53) a curious instance of the influence of\r\nlight on the colours of a frondescent incrustation, deposited by the\r\nsurf on the coast-rocks of Ascension and formed by the solution of\r\ntriturated sea-shells.) In some cases, as with shells living amongst\r\ncorals or brightly-tinted seaweeds, the bright colours may serve as a\r\nprotection. (5. Dr. Morse has lately discussed this subject in his\r\npaper on the ‘Adaptive Coloration of Mollusca,’ ‘Proc. Boston Soc. of\r\nNat. Hist.’ vol. xiv. April 1871.) But that many of the nudibranch\r\nMollusca, or sea-slugs, are as beautifully coloured as any shells, may\r\nbe seen in Messrs. Alder and Hancock’s magnificent work; and from\r\ninformation kindly given me by Mr. Hancock, it seems extremely doubtful\r\nwhether these colours usually serve as a protection. With some species\r\nthis may be the case, as with one kind which lives on the green leaves\r\nof algae, and is itself bright-green. But many brightly-coloured,\r\nwhite, or otherwise conspicuous species, do not seek concealment;\r\nwhilst again some equally conspicuous species, as well as other\r\ndull-coloured kinds live under stones and in dark recesses. So that\r\nwith these nudibranch molluscs, colour apparently does not stand in any\r\nclose relation to the nature of the places which they inhabit.\r\n\r\nThese naked sea-slugs are hermaphrodites, yet they pair together, as do\r\nland-snails, many of which have extremely pretty shells. It is\r\nconceivable that two hermaphrodites, attracted by each other’s greater\r\nbeauty, might unite and leave offspring which would inherit their\r\nparents’ greater beauty. But with such lowly-organised creatures this\r\nis extremely improbable. Nor is it at all obvious how the offspring\r\nfrom the more beautiful pairs of hermaphrodites would have any\r\nadvantage over the offspring of the less beautiful, so as to increase\r\nin number, unless indeed vigour and beauty generally coincided. We have\r\nnot here the case of a number of males becoming mature before the\r\nfemales, with the more beautiful males selected by the more vigorous\r\nfemales. If, indeed, brilliant colours were beneficial to a\r\nhermaphrodite animal in relation to its general habits of life, the\r\nmore brightly-tinted individuals would succeed best and would increase\r\nin number; but this would be a case of natural and not of sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM OF THE VERMES: CLASS, ANNELIDA (OR SEA-WORMS).\r\n\r\nIn this class, although the sexes, when separate, sometimes differ from\r\neach other in characters of such importance that they have been placed\r\nunder distinct genera or even families, yet the differences do not seem\r\nof the kind which can be safely attributed to sexual selection. These\r\nanimals are often beautifully coloured, but as the sexes do not differ\r\nin this respect, we are but little concerned with them. Even the\r\nNemertians, though so lowly organised, “vie in beauty and variety of\r\ncolouring with any other group in the invertebrate series”; yet Dr.\r\nMcIntosh (6. See his beautiful monograph on ‘British Annelids,’ part i.\r\n1873, p. 3.) cannot discover that these colours are of any service. The\r\nsedentary annelids become duller-coloured, according to M. Quatrefages\r\n(7. See M. Perrier: ‘L’Origine de l’Homme d’après Darwin,’ ‘Revue\r\nScientifique’, Feb. 1873, p. 866.), after the period of reproduction;\r\nand this I presume may be attributed to their less vigorous condition\r\nat that time. All these worm-like animals apparently stand too low in\r\nthe scale for the individuals of either sex to exert any choice in\r\nselecting a partner, or for the individuals of the same sex to struggle\r\ntogether in rivalry.\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM OF THE ARTHROPODA: CLASS, CRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\nIn this great class we first meet with undoubted secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, often developed in a remarkable manner. Unfortunately the\r\nhabits of crustaceans are very imperfectly known, and we cannot explain\r\nthe uses of many structures peculiar to one sex. With the lower\r\nparasitic species the males are of small size, and they alone are\r\nfurnished with perfect swimming-legs, antennae and sense-organs; the\r\nfemales being destitute of these organs, with their bodies often\r\nconsisting of a mere distorted mass. But these extraordinary\r\ndifferences between the two sexes are no doubt related to their widely\r\ndifferent habits of life, and consequently do not concern us. In\r\nvarious crustaceans, belonging to distinct families, the anterior\r\nantennae are furnished with peculiar thread-like bodies, which are\r\nbelieved to act as smelling-organs, and these are much more numerous in\r\nthe males than in the females. As the males, without any unusual\r\ndevelopment of their olfactory organs, would almost certainly be able\r\nsooner or later to find the females, the increased number of the\r\nsmelling-threads has probably been acquired through sexual selection,\r\nby the better provided males having been the more successful in finding\r\npartners and in producing offspring. Fritz Müller has described a\r\nremarkable dimorphic species of Tanais, in which the male is\r\nrepresented by two distinct forms, which never graduate into each\r\nother. In the one form the male is furnished with more numerous\r\nsmelling-threads, and in the other form with more powerful and more\r\nelongated chelae or pincers, which serve to hold the female. Fritz\r\nMüller suggests that these differences between the two male forms of\r\nthe same species may have originated in certain individuals having\r\nvaried in the number of the smelling-threads, whilst other individuals\r\nvaried in the shape and size of their chelae; so that of the former,\r\nthose which were best able to find the female, and of the latter, those\r\nwhich were best able to hold her, have left the greatest number of\r\nprogeny to inherit their respective advantages. (8. ‘Facts and\r\nArguments for Darwin,’ English translat., 1869, p. 20. See the previous\r\ndiscussion on the olfactory threads. Sars has described a somewhat\r\nanalogous case (as quoted in ‘Nature,’ 1870, p. 455) in a Norwegian\r\ncrustacean, the Pontoporeia affinis.)\r\n\r\n[Fig.4. Labidocera Darwinii (from Lubbock). Labelled are: a. Part of\r\nright anterior antenna of male, forming a prehensile organ. b.\r\nPosterior pair of thoracic legs of male. c. Ditto of female.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the lower crustaceans, the right anterior antenna of the\r\nmale differs greatly in structure from the left, the latter resembling\r\nin its simple tapering joints the antennae of the female. In the male\r\nthe modified antenna is either swollen in the middle or angularly bent,\r\nor converted (Fig. 4) into an elegant, and sometimes wonderfully\r\ncomplex, prehensile organ. (9. See Sir J. Lubbock in ‘Annals and Mag.\r\nof Nat. Hist.’ vol. xi. 1853, pl. i. and x.; and vol. xii. (1853), pl.\r\nvii. See also Lubbock in ‘Transactions, Entomological Society,’ vol.\r\niv. new series, 1856-1858, p. 8. With respect to the zigzagged antennae\r\nmentioned below, see Fritz Müller, ‘Facts and Arguments for Darwin,’\r\n1869, p. 40, foot-note.) It serves, as I hear from Sir J. Lubbock, to\r\nhold the female, and for this same purpose one of the two posterior\r\nlegs (b) on the same side of the body is converted into a forceps. In\r\nanother family the inferior or posterior antennae are “curiously\r\nzigzagged” in the males alone.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 5. Anterior part of body of Callianassa (from Milne-Edwards),\r\nshowing the unequal and differently-constructed right and left-hand\r\nchelae of the male. N.B.—The artist by mistake has reversed the\r\ndrawing, and made the left-hand chela the largest.\r\n\r\nFig. 6. Second leg of male Orchestia Tucuratinga (from Fritz Müller).\r\n\r\nFig. 7. Ditto of female.]\r\n\r\nIn the higher crustaceans the anterior legs are developed into chelae\r\nor pincers; and these are generally larger in the male than in the\r\nfemale,—so much so that the market value of the male edible crab\r\n(Cancer pagurus), according to Mr. C. Spence Bate, is five times as\r\ngreat as that of the female. In many species the chelae are of unequal\r\nsize on the opposite side of the body, the right-hand one being, as I\r\nam informed by Mr. Bate, generally, though not invariably, the largest.\r\nThis inequality is also often much greater in the male than in the\r\nfemale. The two chelae of the male often differ in structure (Figs. 5,\r\n6, and 7), the smaller one resembling that of the female. What\r\nadvantage is gained by their inequality in size on the opposite sides\r\nof the body, and by the inequality being much greater in the male than\r\nin the female; and why, when they are of equal size, both are often\r\nmuch larger in the male than in the female, is not known. As I hear\r\nfrom Mr. Bate, the chelae are sometimes of such length and size that\r\nthey cannot possibly be used for carrying food to the mouth. In the\r\nmales of certain fresh-water prawns (Palaemon) the right leg is\r\nactually longer than the whole body. (10. See a paper by Mr. C. Spence\r\nBate, with figures, in ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1868, p. 363;\r\nand on the nomenclature of the genus, ibid. p. 585. I am greatly\r\nindebted to Mr. Spence Bate for nearly all the above statements with\r\nrespect to the chelae of the higher crustaceans.) The great size of the\r\none leg with its chelae may aid the male in fighting with his rivals;\r\nbut this will not account for their inequality in the female on the\r\nopposite sides of the body. In Gelasimus, according to a statement\r\nquoted by Milne Edwards (11. ‘Hist. Nat. des Crust.’ tom. ii. 1837, p.\r\n50.), the male and the female live in the same burrow, and this shews\r\nthat they pair; the male closes the mouth of the burrow with one of its\r\nchelae, which is enormously developed; so that here it indirectly\r\nserves as a means of defence. Their main use, however, is probably to\r\nseize and to secure the female, and this in some instances, as with\r\nGammarus, is known to be the case. The male of the hermit or soldier\r\ncrab (Pagurus) for weeks together, carries about the shell inhabited by\r\nthe female. (12. Mr. C. Spence Bate, ‘British Association, Fourth\r\nReport on the Fauna of S. Devon.’) The sexes, however, of the common\r\nshore-crab (Carcinus maenas), as Mr. Bate informs me, unite directly\r\nafter the female has moulted her hard shell, when she is so soft that\r\nshe would be injured if seized by the strong pincers of the male; but\r\nas she is caught and carried about by the male before moulting, she\r\ncould then be seized with impunity.\r\n\r\n[Fig.8. Orchestia Darwinii (from Fritz Müller), showing the\r\ndifferently-constructed chelae of the two male forms.]\r\n\r\nFritz Müller states that certain species of Melita are distinguished\r\nfrom all other amphipods by the females having “the coxal lamellae of\r\nthe penultimate pair of feet produced into hook-like processes, of\r\nwhich the males lay hold with the hands of the first pair.” The\r\ndevelopment of these hook-like processes has probably followed from\r\nthose females which were the most securely held during the act of\r\nreproduction, having left the largest number of offspring. Another\r\nBrazilian amphipod (see Orchestia darwinii, Fig. 8) presents a case of\r\ndimorphism, like that of Tanais; for there are two male forms, which\r\ndiffer in the structure of their chelae. (13. Fritz Müller, ‘Facts and\r\nArguments for Darwin,’ 1869, pp. 25-28.) As either chela would\r\ncertainly suffice to hold the female,—for both are now used for this\r\npurpose,—the two male forms probably originated by some having varied\r\nin one manner and some in another; both forms having derived certain\r\nspecial, but nearly equal advantages, from their differently shaped\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nIt is not known that male crustaceans fight together for the possession\r\nof the females, but it is probably the case; for with most animals when\r\nthe male is larger than the female, he seems to owe his greater size to\r\nhis ancestors having fought with other males during many generations.\r\nIn most of the orders, especially in the highest or the Brachyura, the\r\nmale is larger than the female; the parasitic genera, however, in which\r\nthe sexes follow different habits of life, and most of the Entomostraca\r\nmust be excepted. The chelae of many crustaceans are weapons well\r\nadapted for fighting. Thus when a Devil-crab (Portunus puber) was seen\r\nby a son of Mr. Bate fighting with a Carcinus maenas, the latter was\r\nsoon thrown on its back, and had every limb torn from its body. When\r\nseveral males of a Brazilian Gelasimus, a species furnished with\r\nimmense pincers, were placed together in a glass vessel by Fritz\r\nMüller, they mutilated and killed one another. Mr. Bate put a large\r\nmale Carcinus maenas into a pan of water, inhabited by a female which\r\nwas paired with a smaller male; but the latter was soon dispossessed.\r\nMr. Bate adds, “if they fought, the victory was a bloodless one, for I\r\nsaw no wounds.” This same naturalist separated a male sand-skipper (so\r\ncommon on our sea-shores), Gammarus marinus, from its female, both of\r\nwhom were imprisoned in the same vessel with many individuals of the\r\nsame species. The female, when thus divorced, soon joined the others.\r\nAfter a time the male was put again into the same vessel; and he then,\r\nafter swimming about for a time, dashed into the crowd, and without any\r\nfighting at once took away his wife. This fact shews that in the\r\nAmphipoda, an order low in the scale, the males and females recognise\r\neach other, and are mutually attached.\r\n\r\nThe mental powers of the Crustacea are probably higher than at first\r\nsight appears probable. Any one who tries to catch one of the\r\nshore-crabs, so common on tropical coasts, will perceive how wary and\r\nalert they are. There is a large crab (Birgus latro), found on coral\r\nislands, which makes a thick bed of the picked fibres of the cocoa-nut,\r\nat the bottom of a deep burrow. It feeds on the fallen fruit of this\r\ntree by tearing off the husk, fibre by fibre; and it always begins at\r\nthat end where the three eye-like depressions are situated. It then\r\nbreaks through one of these eyes by hammering with its heavy front\r\npincers, and turning round, extracts the albuminous core with its\r\nnarrow posterior pincers. But these actions are probably instinctive,\r\nso that they would be performed as well by a young animal as by an old\r\none. The following case, however, can hardly be so considered: a\r\ntrustworthy naturalist, Mr. Gardner (14. ‘Travels in the Interior of\r\nBrazil,’ 1846, p. 111. I have given, in my ‘Journal of Researches,’ p.\r\n463, an account of the habits of the Birgus.), whilst watching a\r\nshore-crab (Gelasimus) making its burrow, threw some shells towards the\r\nhole. One rolled in, and three other shells remained within a few\r\ninches of the mouth. In about five minutes the crab brought out the\r\nshell which had fallen in, and carried it away to a distance of a foot;\r\nit then saw the three other shells lying near, and evidently thinking\r\nthat they might likewise roll in, carried them to the spot where it had\r\nlaid the first. It would, I think, be difficult to distinguish this act\r\nfrom one performed by man by the aid of reason.\r\n\r\nMr. Bate does not know of any well-marked case of difference of colour\r\nin the two sexes of our British crustaceans, in which respect the sexes\r\nof the higher animals so often differ. In some cases, however, the\r\nmales and females differ slightly in tint, but Mr. Bate thinks not more\r\nthan may be accounted for by their different habits of life, such as by\r\nthe male wandering more about, and being thus more exposed to the\r\nlight. Dr. Power tried to distinguish by colour the sexes of the\r\nseveral species which inhabit the Mauritius, but failed, except with\r\none species of Squilla, probably S. stylifera, the male of which is\r\ndescribed as being “of a beautiful bluish-green,” with some of the\r\nappendages cherry-red, whilst the female is clouded with brown and\r\ngrey, “with the red about her much less vivid than in the male.” (15.\r\nMr. Ch. Fraser, in ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1869, p. 3. I am indebted to\r\nMr. Bate for Dr. Power’s statement.) In this case, we may suspect the\r\nagency of sexual selection. From M. Bert’s observations on Daphnia,\r\nwhen placed in a vessel illuminated by a prism, we have reason to\r\nbelieve that even the lowest crustaceans can distinguish colours. With\r\nSaphirina (an oceanic genus of Entomostraca), the males are furnished\r\nwith minute shields or cell-like bodies, which exhibit beautiful\r\nchanging colours; these are absent in the females, and in both sexes of\r\none species. (16. Claus, ‘Die freilebenden Copepoden,’ 1863, s. 35.) It\r\nwould, however, be extremely rash to conclude that these curious organs\r\nserve to attract the females. I am informed by Fritz Müller, that in\r\nthe female of a Brazilian species of Gelasimus, the whole body is of a\r\nnearly uniform greyish-brown. In the male the posterior part of the\r\ncephalo-thorax is pure white, with the anterior part of a rich green,\r\nshading into dark brown; and it is remarkable that these colours are\r\nliable to change in the course of a few minutes—the white becoming\r\ndirty grey or even black, the green “losing much of its brilliancy.” It\r\ndeserves especial notice that the males do not acquire their bright\r\ncolours until they become mature. They appear to be much more numerous\r\nthan the females; they differ also in the larger size of their chelae.\r\nIn some species of the genus, probably in all, the sexes pair and\r\ninhabit the same burrow. They are also, as we have seen, highly\r\nintelligent animals. From these various considerations it seems\r\nprobable that the male in this species has become gaily ornamented in\r\norder to attract or excite the female.\r\n\r\nIt has just been stated that the male Gelasimus does not acquire his\r\nconspicuous colours until mature and nearly ready to breed. This seems\r\na general rule in the whole class in respect to the many remarkable\r\nstructural differences between the sexes. We shall hereafter find the\r\nsame law prevailing throughout the great sub-kingdom of the Vertebrata;\r\nand in all cases it is eminently distinctive of characters which have\r\nbeen acquired through sexual selection. Fritz Müller (17. ‘Facts and\r\nArguments,’ etc., p. 79.) gives some striking instances of this law;\r\nthus the male sand-hopper (Orchestia) does not, until nearly full\r\ngrown, acquire his large claspers, which are very differently\r\nconstructed from those of the female; whilst young, his claspers\r\nresemble those of the female.\r\n\r\nCLASS, ARACHNIDA (SPIDERS).\r\n\r\nThe sexes do not generally differ much in colour, but the males are\r\noften darker than the females, as may be seen in Mr. Blackwall’s\r\nmagnificent work. (18. ‘A History of the Spiders of Great Britain,’\r\n1861-64. For the following facts, see pp. 77, 88, 102.) In some\r\nspecies, however, the difference is conspicuous: thus the female of\r\nSparassus smaragdulus is dullish green, whilst the adult male has the\r\nabdomen of a fine yellow, with three longitudinal stripes of rich red.\r\nIn certain species of Thomisus the sexes closely resemble each other,\r\nin others they differ much; and analogous cases occur in many other\r\ngenera. It is often difficult to say which of the two sexes departs\r\nmost from the ordinary coloration of the genus to which the species\r\nbelong; but Mr. Blackwall thinks that, as a general rule, it is the\r\nmale; and Canestrini (19. This author has recently published a valuable\r\nessay on the ‘Caratteri sessuali secondarii degli Arachnidi,’ in the\r\n‘Atti della Soc. Veneto-Trentina di Sc. Nat. Padova,’ vol. i. Fasc. 3,\r\n1873.) remarks that in certain genera the males can be specifically\r\ndistinguished with ease, but the females with great difficulty. I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Blackwall that the sexes whilst young usually resemble\r\neach other; and both often undergo great changes in colour during their\r\nsuccessive moults, before arriving at maturity. In other cases the male\r\nalone appears to change colour. Thus the male of the above\r\nbright-coloured Sparassus at first resembles the female, and acquires\r\nhis peculiar tints only when nearly adult. Spiders are possessed of\r\nacute senses, and exhibit much intelligence; as is well known, the\r\nfemales often shew the strongest affection for their eggs, which they\r\ncarry about enveloped in a silken web. The males search eagerly for the\r\nfemales, and have been seen by Canestrini and others to fight for\r\npossession of them. This same author says that the union of the two\r\nsexes has been observed in about twenty species; and he asserts\r\npositively that the female rejects some of the males who court her,\r\nthreatens them with open mandibles, and at last after long hesitation\r\naccepts the chosen one. From these several considerations, we may admit\r\nwith some confidence that the well-marked differences in colour between\r\nthe sexes of certain species are the results of sexual selection;\r\nthough we have not here the best kind of evidence,—the display by the\r\nmale of his ornaments. From the extreme variability of colour in the\r\nmale of some species, for instance of Theridion lineatum, it would\r\nappear that these sexual characters of the males have not as yet become\r\nwell fixed. Canestrini draws the same conclusion from the fact that the\r\nmales of certain species present two forms, differing from each other\r\nin the size and length of their jaws; and this reminds us of the above\r\ncases of dimorphic crustaceans.\r\n\r\nThe male is generally much smaller than the female, sometimes to an\r\nextraordinary degree (20. Aug. Vinson (‘Araneides des Iles de la\r\nReunion,’ pl. vi. figs. 1 and 2) gives a good instance of the small\r\nsize of the male, in Epeira nigra. In this species, as I may add, the\r\nmale is testaceous and the female black with legs banded with red.\r\nOther even more striking cases of inequality in size between the sexes\r\nhave been recorded (‘Quarterly Journal of Science,’ July 1868, p. 429);\r\nbut I have not seen the original accounts.), and he is forced to be\r\nextremely cautious in making his advances, as the female often carries\r\nher coyness to a dangerous pitch. De Geer saw a male that “in the midst\r\nof his preparatory caresses was seized by the object of his attentions,\r\nenveloped by her in a web and then devoured, a sight which, as he adds,\r\nfilled him with horror and indignation.” (21. Kirby and Spence,\r\n‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. i. 1818, p. 280.) The Rev. O.P.\r\nCambridge (22. ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1871, p. 621.)\r\naccounts in the following manner for the extreme smallness of the male\r\nin the genus Nephila. “M. Vinson gives a graphic account of the agile\r\nway in which the diminutive male escapes from the ferocity of the\r\nfemale, by gliding about and playing hide and seek over her body and\r\nalong her gigantic limbs: in such a pursuit it is evident that the\r\nchances of escape would be in favour of the smallest males, while the\r\nlarger ones would fall early victims; thus gradually a diminutive race\r\nof males would be selected, until at last they would dwindle to the\r\nsmallest possible size compatible with the exercise of their generative\r\nfunctions,—in fact, probably to the size we now see them, i.e., so\r\nsmall as to be a sort of parasite upon the female, and either beneath\r\nher notice, or too agile and too small for her to catch without great\r\ndifficulty.”\r\n\r\nWestring has made the interesting discovery that the males of several\r\nspecies of Theridion (23. Theridion (Asagena, Sund.) serratipes,\r\n4-punctatum et guttatum; see Westring, in Kroyer, ‘Naturhist.\r\nTidskrift,’ vol. iv. 1842-1843, p. 349; and vol. ii. 1846-1849, p. 342.\r\nSee, also, for other species, ‘Araneae Suecicae,’ p. 184.) have the\r\npower of making a stridulating sound, whilst the females are mute. The\r\napparatus consists of a serrated ridge at the base of the abdomen,\r\nagainst which the hard hinder part of the thorax is rubbed; and of this\r\nstructure not a trace can be detected in the females. It deserves\r\nnotice that several writers, including the well-known arachnologist\r\nWalckenaer, have declared that spiders are attracted by music. (24. Dr.\r\nH.H. van Zouteveen, in his Dutch translation of this work (vol. i. p.\r\n444), has collected several cases.) From the analogy of the Orthoptera\r\nand Homoptera, to be described in the next chapter, we may feel almost\r\nsure that the stridulation serves, as Westring also believes, to call\r\nor to excite the female; and this is the first case known to me in the\r\nascending scale of the animal kingdom of sounds emitted for this\r\npurpose. (25. Hilgendorf, however, has lately called attention to an\r\nanalogous structure in some of the higher crustaceans, which seems\r\nadapted to produce sound; see ‘Zoological Record,’ 1869, p. 603.)\r\n\r\nCLASS, MYRIAPODA.\r\n\r\nIn neither of the two orders in this class, the millipedes and\r\ncentipedes, can I find any well-marked instances of such sexual\r\ndifferences as more particularly concern us. In Glomeris limbata,\r\nhowever, and perhaps in some few other species, the males differ\r\nslightly in colour from the females; but this Glomeris is a highly\r\nvariable species. In the males of the Diplopoda, the legs belonging\r\neither to one of the anterior or of the posterior segments of the body\r\nare modified into prehensile hooks which serve to secure the female. In\r\nsome species of Iulus the tarsi of the male are furnished with\r\nmembranous suckers for the same purpose. As we shall see when we treat\r\nof Insects, it is a much more unusual circumstance, that it is the\r\nfemale in Lithobius, which is furnished with prehensile appendages at\r\nthe extremity of her body for holding the male. (26. Walckenaer et P.\r\nGervais, ‘Hist. Nat. des Insectes: Apteres,’ tom. iv. 1847, pp. 17, 19,\r\n68.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiversified structures possessed by the males for seizing the\r\nfemales—Differences between the sexes, of which the meaning is not\r\nunderstood—Difference in size between the\r\nsexes—Thysanura—Diptera—Hemiptera—Homoptera, musical powers possessed\r\nby the males alone—Orthoptera, musical instruments of the males, much\r\ndiversified in structure; pugnacity; colours—Neuroptera, sexual\r\ndifferences in colour—Hymenoptera, pugnacity and odours—Coleoptera,\r\ncolours; furnished with great horns, apparently as an ornament;\r\nbattles, stridulating organs generally common to both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the immense class of insects the sexes sometimes differ in their\r\nlocomotive-organs, and often in their sense-organs, as in the\r\npectinated and beautifully plumose antennae of the males of many\r\nspecies. In Chloeon, one of the Ephemerae, the male has great pillared\r\neyes, of which the female is entirely destitute. (1. Sir J. Lubbock,\r\n‘Transact. Linnean Soc.’ vol. xxv, 1866, p. 484. With respect to the\r\nMutillidae see Westwood, ‘Modern Class. of Insects,’ vol. ii. p. 213.)\r\nThe ocelli are absent in the females of certain insects, as in the\r\nMutillidae; and here the females are likewise wingless. But we are\r\nchiefly concerned with structures by which one male is enabled to\r\nconquer another, either in battle or courtship, through his strength,\r\npugnacity, ornaments, or music. The innumerable contrivances,\r\ntherefore, by which the male is able to seize the female, may be\r\nbriefly passed over. Besides the complex structures at the apex of the\r\nabdomen, which ought perhaps to be ranked as primary organs (2. These\r\norgans in the male often differ in closely-allied species, and afford\r\nexcellent specific characters. But their importance, from a functional\r\npoint of view, as Mr. R. MacLachlan has remarked to me, has probably\r\nbeen overrated. It has been suggested, that slight differences in these\r\norgans would suffice to prevent the intercrossing of well-marked\r\nvarieties or incipient species, and would thus aid in their\r\ndevelopment. That this can hardly be the case, we may infer from the\r\nmany recorded cases (see, for instance, Bronn, ‘Geschichte der Natur,’\r\nB. ii. 1843, s. 164; and Westwood, ‘Transact. Ent. Soc.’ vol. iii.\r\n1842, p. 195) of distinct species having been observed in union. Mr.\r\nMacLachlan informs me (vide ‘Stett. Ent. Zeitung,’ 1867, s. 155) that\r\nwhen several species of Phryganidae, which present strongly-pronounced\r\ndifferences of this kind, were confined together by Dr. Aug. Meyer,\r\nTHEY COUPLED, and one pair produced fertile ova.), “it is astonishing,”\r\nas Mr. B.D. Walsh (3. ‘The Practical Entomologist,’ Philadelphia, vol.\r\nii. May 1867, p. 88.) has remarked, “how many different organs are\r\nworked in by nature for the seemingly insignificant object of enabling\r\nthe male to grasp the female firmly.” The mandibles or jaws are\r\nsometimes used for this purpose; thus the male Corydalis cornutus (a\r\nneuropterous insect in some degree allied to the Dragon flies, etc.)\r\nhas immense curved jaws, many times longer than those of the female;\r\nand they are smooth instead of being toothed, so that he is thus\r\nenabled to seize her without injury. (4. Mr. Walsh, ibid. p. 107.) One\r\nof the stag-beetles of North America (Lucanus elaphus) uses his jaws,\r\nwhich are much larger than those of the female, for the same purpose,\r\nbut probably likewise for fighting. In one of the sand-wasps\r\n(Ammophila) the jaws in the two sexes are closely alike, but are used\r\nfor widely different purposes: the males, as Professor Westwood\r\nobserves, “are exceedingly ardent, seizing their partners round the\r\nneck with their sickle-shaped jaws” (5. ‘Modern Classification of\r\nInsects,’ vol. ii. 1840, pp. 205, 206. Mr. Walsh, who called my\r\nattention to the double use of the jaws, says that he has repeatedly\r\nobserved this fact.); whilst the females use these organs for burrowing\r\nin sand-banks and making their nests.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 9. Crabro cribrarius. Upper figure, male; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nThe tarsi of the front-legs are dilated in many male beetles, or are\r\nfurnished with broad cushions of hairs; and in many genera of\r\nwater-beetles they are armed with a round flat sucker, so that the male\r\nmay adhere to the slippery body of the female. It is a much more\r\nunusual circumstance that the females of some water-beetles (Dytiscus)\r\nhave their elytra deeply grooved, and in Acilius sulcatus thickly set\r\nwith hairs, as an aid to the male. The females of some other\r\nwater-beetles (Hydroporus) have their elytra punctured for the same\r\npurpose. (6. We have here a curious and inexplicable case of\r\ndimorphism, for some of the females of four European species of\r\nDytiscus, and of certain species of Hydroporus, have their elytra\r\nsmooth; and no intermediate gradations between the sulcated or\r\npunctured, and the quite smooth elytra have been observed. See Dr. H.\r\nSchaum, as quoted in the ‘Zoologist,’ vols. v.-vi. 1847-48, p. 1896.\r\nAlso Kirby and Spence, ‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. iii. 1826, p.\r\n305.) In the male of Crabro cribrarius (Fig. 9), it is the tibia which\r\nis dilated into a broad horny plate, with minute membraneous dots,\r\ngiving to it a singular appearance like that of a riddle. (7. Westwood,\r\n‘Modern Class.’ vol. ii. p. 193. The following statement about Penthe,\r\nand others in inverted commas, are taken from Mr. Walsh, ‘Practical\r\nEntomologist,’ Philadelphia, vol. iii. p. 88.) In the male of Penthe (a\r\ngenus of beetles) a few of the middle joints of the antennae are\r\ndilated and furnished on the inferior surface with cushions of hair,\r\nexactly like those on the tarsi of the Carabidae, “and obviously for\r\nthe same end.” In male dragon-flies, “the appendages at the tip of the\r\ntail are modified in an almost infinite variety of curious patterns to\r\nenable them to embrace the neck of the female.” Lastly, in the males of\r\nmany insects, the legs are furnished with peculiar spines, knobs or\r\nspurs; or the whole leg is bowed or thickened, but this is by no means\r\ninvariably a sexual character; or one pair, or all three pairs are\r\nelongated, sometimes to an extravagant length. (8. Kirby and Spence,\r\n‘Introduct.’ etc., vol. iii. pp. 332-336.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 10. Taphroderes distortus (much enlarged). Upper figure, male;\r\nlower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nThe sexes of many species in all the orders present differences, of\r\nwhich the meaning is not understood. One curious case is that of a\r\nbeetle (Fig. 10), the male of which has left mandible much enlarged; so\r\nthat the mouth is greatly distorted. In another Carabidous beetle,\r\nEurygnathus (9. ‘Insecta Maderensia,’ 1854, page 20.), we have the\r\ncase, unique as far as known to Mr. Wollaston, of the head of the\r\nfemale being much broader and larger, though in a variable degree, than\r\nthat of the male. Any number of such cases could be given. They abound\r\nin the Lepidoptera: one of the most extraordinary is that certain male\r\nbutterflies have their fore-legs more or less atrophied, with the\r\ntibiae and tarsi reduced to mere rudimentary knobs. The wings, also, in\r\nthe two sexes often differ in neuration (10. E. Doubleday, ‘Annals and\r\nMag. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. i. 1848, p. 379. I may add that the wings in\r\ncertain Hymenoptera (see Shuckard, ‘Fossorial Hymenoptera,’ 1837, pp.\r\n39-43) differ in neuration according to sex.), and sometimes\r\nconsiderably in outline, as in the Aricoris epitus, which was shewn to\r\nme in the British Museum by Mr. A. Butler. The males of certain South\r\nAmerican butterflies have tufts of hair on the margins of the wings,\r\nand horny excrescences on the discs of the posterior pair. (11. H.W.\r\nBates, in ‘Journal of Proc. Linn. Soc.’ vol. vi. 1862, p. 74. Mr.\r\nWonfor’s observations are quoted in ‘Popular Science Review,’ 1868, p.\r\n343.) In several British butterflies, as shewn by Mr. Wonfor, the males\r\nalone are in parts clothed with peculiar scales.\r\n\r\nThe use of the bright light of the female glow-worm has been subject to\r\nmuch discussion. The male is feebly luminous, as are the larvae and\r\neven the eggs. It has been supposed by some authors that the light\r\nserves to frighten away enemies, and by others to guide the male to the\r\nfemale. At last, Mr. Belt (12. ‘The Naturalist in Nicaragua,’ 1874, pp.\r\n316-320. On the phosphorescence of the eggs, see ‘Annals and Magazine\r\nof Natural History,’ Nov. 1871, p. 372.) appears to have solved the\r\ndifficulty: he finds that all the Lampyridae which he has tried are\r\nhighly distasteful to insectivorous mammals and birds. Hence it is in\r\naccordance with Mr. Bates’ view, hereafter to be explained, that many\r\ninsects mimic the Lampyridae closely, in order to be mistaken for them,\r\nand thus to escape destruction. He further believes that the luminous\r\nspecies profit by being at once recognised as unpalatable. It is\r\nprobable that the same explanation may be extended to the Elaters, both\r\nsexes of which are highly luminous. It is not known why the wings of\r\nthe female glow-worm have not been developed; but in her present state\r\nshe closely resembles a larva, and as larvae are so largely preyed on\r\nby many animals, we can understand why she has been rendered so much\r\nmore luminous and conspicuous than the male; and why the larvae\r\nthemselves are likewise luminous.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE IN SIZE BETWEEN THE SEXES.\r\n\r\nWith insects of all kinds the males are commonly smaller than the\r\nfemales; and this difference can often be detected even in the larval\r\nstate. So considerable is the difference between the male and female\r\ncocoons of the silk-moth (Bombyx mori), that in France they are\r\nseparated by a particular mode of weighing. (13. Robinet, ‘Vers a\r\nSoie,’ 1848, p. 207.) In the lower classes of the animal kingdom, the\r\ngreater size of the females seems generally to depend on their\r\ndeveloping an enormous number of ova; and this may to a certain extent\r\nhold good with insects. But Dr. Wallace has suggested a much more\r\nprobable explanation. He finds, after carefully attending to the\r\ndevelopment of the caterpillars of Bombyx cynthia and yamamai, and\r\nespecially to that of some dwarfed caterpillars reared from a second\r\nbrood on unnatural food, “that in proportion as the individual moth is\r\nfiner, so is the time required for its metamorphosis longer; and for\r\nthis reason the female, which is the larger and heavier insect, from\r\nhaving to carry her numerous eggs, will be preceded by the male, which\r\nis smaller and has less to mature.” (14. ‘Transact. Ent. Soc.’ 3rd\r\nseries, vol. v. p. 486.) Now as most insects are short-lived, and as\r\nthey are exposed to many dangers, it would manifestly be advantageous\r\nto the female to be impregnated as soon as possible. This end would be\r\ngained by the males being first matured in large numbers ready for the\r\nadvent of the females; and this again would naturally follow, as Mr.\r\nA.R. Wallace has remarked (15. ‘Journal of Proc. Ent. Soc.’ Feb. 4,\r\n1867, p. lxxi.), through natural selection; for the smaller males would\r\nbe first matured, and thus would procreate a large number of offspring\r\nwhich would inherit the reduced size of their male parents, whilst the\r\nlarger males from being matured later would leave fewer offspring.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, exceptions to the rule of male insects being\r\nsmaller than the females: and some of these exceptions are\r\nintelligible. Size and strength would be an advantage to the males,\r\nwhich fight for the possession of the females; and in these cases, as\r\nwith the stag-beetle (Lucanus), the males are larger than the females.\r\nThere are, however, other beetles which are not known to fight\r\ntogether, of which the males exceed the females in size; and the\r\nmeaning of this fact is not known; but in some of these cases, as with\r\nthe huge Dynastes and Megasoma, we can at least see that there would be\r\nno necessity for the males to be smaller than the females, in order to\r\nbe matured before them, for these beetles are not short-lived, and\r\nthere would be ample time for the pairing of the sexes. So again, male\r\ndragon-flies (Libellulidae) are sometimes sensibly larger, and never\r\nsmaller, than the females (16. For this and other statements on the\r\nsize of the sexes, see Kirby and Spence, ibid. vol. iii. p. 300; on the\r\nduration of life in insects, see p. 344.); and as Mr. MacLachlan\r\nbelieves, they do not generally pair with the females until a week or\r\nfortnight has elapsed, and until they have assumed their proper\r\nmasculine colours. But the most curious case, shewing on what complex\r\nand easily-overlooked relations, so trifling a character as difference\r\nin size between the sexes may depend, is that of the aculeate\r\nHymenoptera; for Mr. F. Smith informs me that throughout nearly the\r\nwhole of this large group, the males, in accordance with the general\r\nrule, are smaller than the females, and emerge about a week before\r\nthem; but amongst the Bees, the males of Apis mellifica, Anthidium\r\nmanicatum, and Anthophora acervorum, and amongst the Fossores, the\r\nmales of the Methoca ichneumonides, are larger than the females. The\r\nexplanation of this anomaly is that a marriage flight is absolutely\r\nnecessary with these species, and the male requires great strength and\r\nsize in order to carry the female through the air. Increased size has\r\nhere been acquired in opposition to the usual relation between size and\r\nthe period of development, for the males, though larger, emerge before\r\nthe smaller females.\r\n\r\nWe will now review the several Orders, selecting such facts as more\r\nparticularly concern us. The Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths) will\r\nbe retained for a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nORDER, THYSANURA.\r\n\r\nThe members of this lowly organised order are wingless, dull-coloured,\r\nminute insects, with ugly, almost misshapen heads and bodies. Their\r\nsexes do not differ, but they are interesting as shewing us that the\r\nmales pay sedulous court to the females even low down in the animal\r\nscale. Sir J. Lubbock (17. ‘Transact. Linnean Soc.’ vol. xxvi. 1868, p.\r\n296.) says: “it is very amusing to see these little creatures\r\n(Smynthurus luteus) coquetting together. The male, which is much\r\nsmaller than the female, runs round her, and they butt one another,\r\nstanding face to face and moving backward and forward like two playful\r\nlambs. Then the female pretends to run away and the male runs after her\r\nwith a queer appearance of anger, gets in front and stands facing her\r\nagain; then she turns coyly round, but he, quicker and more active,\r\nscuttles round too, and seems to whip her with his antennae; then for a\r\nbit they stand face to face, play with their antennae, and seem to be\r\nall in all to one another.”\r\n\r\nORDER, DIPTERA (FLIES).\r\n\r\nThe sexes differ little in colour. The greatest difference, known to\r\nMr. F. Walker, is in the genus Bibio, in which the males are blackish\r\nor quite black, and the females obscure brownish-orange. The genus\r\nElaphomyia, discovered by Mr. Wallace (18. ‘The Malay Archipelago,’\r\nvol. ii. 1869, p. 313.) in New Guinea, is highly remarkable, as the\r\nmales are furnished with horns, of which the females are quite\r\ndestitute. The horns spring from beneath the eyes, and curiously\r\nresemble those of a stag, being either branched or palmated. In one of\r\nthe species, they equal the whole body in length. They might be thought\r\nto be adapted for fighting, but as in one species they are of a\r\nbeautiful pink colour, edged with black, with a pale central stripe,\r\nand as these insects have altogether a very elegant appearance, it is\r\nperhaps more probable that they serve as ornaments. That the males of\r\nsome Diptera fight together is certain; Prof. Westwood (19. ‘Modern\r\nClassification of Insects,’ vol. ii. 1840, p. 526.) has several times\r\nseen this with the Tipulae. The males of other Diptera apparently try\r\nto win the females by their music: H. Müller (20. ‘Anwendung,’ etc.,\r\n‘Verh. d. n. V. Jahrg.’ xxix. p. 80. Mayer, in ‘American Naturalist,’\r\n1874, p. 236.) watched for some time two males of an Eristalis courting\r\na female; they hovered above her, and flew from side to side, making a\r\nhigh humming noise at the same time. Gnats and mosquitoes (Culicidae)\r\nalso seem to attract each other by humming; and Prof. Mayer has\r\nrecently ascertained that the hairs on the antennae of the male vibrate\r\nin unison with the notes of a tuning-fork, within the range of the\r\nsounds emitted by the female. The longer hairs vibrate sympathetically\r\nwith the graver notes, and the shorter hairs with the higher ones.\r\nLandois also asserts that he has repeatedly drawn down a whole swarm of\r\ngnats by uttering a particular note. It may be added that the mental\r\nfaculties of the Diptera are probably higher than in most other\r\ninsects, in accordance with their highly-developed nervous system. (21.\r\nSee Mr. B.T. Lowne’s interesting work, ‘On the Anatomy of the Blow-fly,\r\nMusca vomitoria,’ 1870, p. 14. He remarks (p. 33) that, “the captured\r\nflies utter a peculiar plaintive note, and that this sound causes other\r\nflies to disappear.”)\r\n\r\nORDER, HEMIPTERA (FIELD-BUGS).\r\n\r\nMr. J.W. Douglas, who has particularly attended to the British species,\r\nhas kindly given me an account of their sexual differences. The males\r\nof some species are furnished with wings, whilst the females are\r\nwingless; the sexes differ in the form of their bodies, elytra,\r\nantennae and tarsi; but as the signification of these differences are\r\nunknown, they may be here passed over. The females are generally larger\r\nand more robust than the males. With British, and, as far as Mr.\r\nDouglas knows, with exotic species, the sexes do not commonly differ\r\nmuch in colour; but in about six British species the male is\r\nconsiderably darker than the female, and in about four other species\r\nthe female is darker than the male. Both sexes of some species are\r\nbeautifully coloured; and as these insects emit an extremely nauseous\r\nodour, their conspicuous colours may serve as a signal that they are\r\nunpalatable to insectivorous animals. In some few cases their colours\r\nappear to be directly protective: thus Prof. Hoffmann informs me that\r\nhe could hardly distinguish a small pink and green species from the\r\nbuds on the trunks of lime-trees, which this insect frequents.\r\n\r\nSome species of Reduvidae make a stridulating noise; and, in the case\r\nof Pirates stridulus, this is said (22. Westwood, ‘Modern\r\nClassification of Insects,’ vol. ii. p. 473.) to be effected by the\r\nmovement of the neck within the pro-thoracic cavity. According to\r\nWestring, Reduvius personatus also stridulates. But I have no reason to\r\nsuppose that this is a sexual character, excepting that with non-social\r\ninsects there seems to be no use for sound-producing organs, unless it\r\nbe as a sexual call.\r\n\r\nORDER: HOMOPTERA.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has wandered in a tropical forest must have been\r\nastonished at the din made by the male Cicadae. The females are mute;\r\nas the Grecian poet Xenarchus says, “Happy the Cicadas live, since they\r\nall have voiceless wives.” The noise thus made could be plainly heard\r\non board the “Beagle,” when anchored at a quarter of a mile from the\r\nshore of Brazil; and Captain Hancock says it can be heard at the\r\ndistance of a mile. The Greeks formerly kept, and the Chinese now keep\r\nthese insects in cages for the sake of their song, so that it must be\r\npleasing to the ears of some men. (23. These particulars are taken from\r\nWestwood’s ‘Modern Classification of Insects,’ vol. ii. 1840, p. 422.\r\nSee, also, on the Fulgoridae, Kirby and Spence, ‘Introduct.’ vol. ii.\r\np. 401.) The Cicadidae usually sing during the day, whilst the\r\nFulgoridae appear to be night-songsters. The sound, according to\r\nLandois (24. ‘Zeitschrift für wissenschaft. Zoolog.’ B. xvii. 1867, ss.\r\n152-158.), is produced by the vibration of the lips of the spiracles,\r\nwhich are set into motion by a current of air emitted from the\r\ntracheae; but this view has lately been disputed. Dr. Powell appears to\r\nhave proved (25. ‘Transactions of the New Zealand Institute,’ vol. v.\r\n1873, p. 286.) that it is produced by the vibration of a membrane, set\r\ninto action by a special muscle. In the living insect, whilst\r\nstridulating, this membrane can be seen to vibrate; and in the dead\r\ninsect the proper sound is heard, if the muscle, when a little dried\r\nand hardened, is pulled with the point of a pin. In the female the\r\nwhole complex musical apparatus is present, but is much less developed\r\nthan in the male, and is never used for producing sound.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the object of the music, Dr. Hartman, in speaking of\r\nthe Cicada septemdecim of the United States, says (26. I am indebted to\r\nMr. Walsh for having sent me this extract from ‘A Journal of the Doings\r\nof Cicada septemdecim,’ by Dr. Hartman.), “the drums are now (June 6th\r\nand 7th, 1851) heard in all directions. This I believe to be the\r\nmarital summons from the males. Standing in thick chestnut sprouts\r\nabout as high as my head, where hundreds were around me, I observed the\r\nfemales coming around the drumming males.” He adds, “this season (Aug.\r\n1868) a dwarf pear-tree in my garden produced about fifty larvae of\r\nCic. pruinosa; and I several times noticed the females to alight near a\r\nmale while he was uttering his clanging notes.” Fritz Müller writes to\r\nme from S. Brazil that he has often listened to a musical contest\r\nbetween two or three males of a species with a particularly loud voice,\r\nseated at a considerable distance from each other: as soon as one had\r\nfinished his song, another immediately began, and then another. As\r\nthere is so much rivalry between the males, it is probable that the\r\nfemales not only find them by their sounds, but that, like female\r\nbirds, they are excited or allured by the male with the most attractive\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nI have not heard of any well-marked cases of ornamental differences\r\nbetween the sexes of the Homoptera. Mr. Douglas informs me that there\r\nare three British species, in which the male is black or marked with\r\nblack bands, whilst the females are pale-coloured or obscure.\r\n\r\nORDER, ORTHOPTERA (CRICKETS AND GRASSHOPPERS).\r\n\r\nThe males in the three saltatorial families in this Order are\r\nremarkable for their musical powers, namely the Achetidae or crickets,\r\nthe Locustidae for which there is no equivalent English name, and the\r\nAcridiidae or grasshoppers. The stridulation produced by some of the\r\nLocustidae is so loud that it can be heard during the night at the\r\ndistance of a mile (27. L. Guilding, ‘Transactions of the Linnean\r\nSociety,’ vol. xv. p. 154.); and that made by certain species is not\r\nunmusical even to the human ear, so that the Indians on the Amazons\r\nkeep them in wicker cages. All observers agree that the sounds serve\r\neither to call or excite the mute females. With respect to the\r\nmigratory locusts of Russia, Korte has given (28. I state this on the\r\nauthority of Koppen, ‘Über die Heuschrecken in Südrussland,’ 1866, p.\r\n32, for I have in vain endeavoured to procure Korte’s work.) an\r\ninteresting case of selection by the female of a male. The males of\r\nthis species (Pachytylus migratorius) whilst coupled with the female\r\nstridulate from anger or jealousy, if approached by other males. The\r\nhouse-cricket when surprised at night uses its voice to warn its\r\nfellows. (29. Gilbert White, ‘Natural History of Selborne,’ vol. ii.\r\n1825, p. 262.) In North America the Katy-did (Platyphyllum concavum,\r\none of the Locustidae) is described (30. Harris, ‘Insects of New\r\nEngland,’ 1842, p. 128.) as mounting on the upper branches of a tree,\r\nand in the evening beginning “his noisy babble, while rival notes issue\r\nfrom the neighbouring trees, and the groves resound with the call of\r\nKaty-did-she-did the live-long night.” Mr. Bates, in speaking of the\r\nEuropean field-cricket (one of the Achetidae), says “the male has been\r\nobserved to place himself in the evening at the entrance of his burrow,\r\nand stridulate until a female approaches, when the louder notes are\r\nsucceeded by a more subdued tone, whilst the successful musician\r\ncaresses with his antennae the mate he has won.” (31. ‘The Naturalist\r\non the Amazons,’ vol. i. 1863, p. 252. Mr. Bates gives a very\r\ninteresting discussion on the gradations in the musical apparatus of\r\nthe three families. See also Westwood, ‘Modern Classification of\r\nInsects,’ vol. ii. pp. 445 and 453.) Dr. Scudder was able to excite one\r\nof these insects to answer him, by rubbing on a file with a quill. (32.\r\n‘Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History,’ vol. xi. April\r\n1868.) In both sexes a remarkable auditory apparatus has been\r\ndiscovered by Von Siebold, situated in the front legs. (33. ‘Nouveau\r\nManuel d’Anat. Comp.’ (French translat.), tom. 1, 1850, p. 567.)\r\n\r\n[Fig.11. Gryllus campestris (from Landois). Right-hand figure, under\r\nside of part of a wing-nervure, much magnified, showing the teeth, st.\r\nLeft-hand figure, upper surface of wing-cover, with the projecting,\r\nsmooth nervure, r, across which the teeth (st) are scraped.\r\n\r\nFig.12. Teeth of Nervure of Gryllus domesticus (from Landois).]\r\n\r\nIn the three Families the sounds are differently produced. In the males\r\nof the Achetidae both wing-covers have the same apparatus; and this in\r\nthe field-cricket (see Gryllus campestris, Fig. 11) consists, as\r\ndescribed by Landois (34. ‘Zeitschrift für wissenschaft. Zoolog.’ B.\r\nxvii. 1867, s. 117.), of from 131 to 138 sharp, transverse ridges or\r\nteeth (st) on the under side of one of the nervures of the wing-cover.\r\nThis toothed nervure is rapidly scraped across a projecting, smooth,\r\nhard nervure (r) on the upper surface of the opposite wing. First one\r\nwing is rubbed over the other, and then the movement is reversed. Both\r\nwings are raised a little at the same time, so as to increase the\r\nresonance. In some species the wing-covers of the males are furnished\r\nat the base with a talc-like plate. (35. Westwood, ‘Modern\r\nClassification of Insects,’ vol. i. p. 440.) I here give a drawing\r\n(Fig. 12) of the teeth on the under side of the nervure of another\r\nspecies of Gryllus, viz., G. domesticus. With respect to the formation\r\nof these teeth, Dr. Gruber has shewn (36. ‘Ueber der Tonapparat der\r\nLocustiden, ein Beitrag zum Darwinismus,’ ‘Zeitschrift für\r\nwissenschaft. Zoolog.’ B. xxii. 1872, p. 100.) that they have been\r\ndeveloped by the aid of selection, from the minute scales and hairs\r\nwith which the wings and body are covered, and I came to the same\r\nconclusion with respect to those of the Coleoptera. But Dr. Gruber\r\nfurther shews that their development is in part directly due to the\r\nstimulus from the friction of one wing over the other.\r\n\r\n[Fig.13. Chlorocoelus Tanana (from Bates). a,b. Lobes of opposite\r\nwing-covers.]\r\n\r\nIn the Locustidae the opposite wing-covers differ from each other in\r\nstructure (Fig. 13), and the action cannot, as in the last family, be\r\nreversed. The left wing, which acts as the bow, lies over the right\r\nwing which serves as the fiddle. One of the nervures (a) on the under\r\nsurface of the former is finely serrated, and is scraped across the\r\nprominent nervures on the upper surface of the opposite or right wing.\r\nIn our British Phasgonura viridissima it appeared to me that the\r\nserrated nervure is rubbed against the rounded hind-corner of the\r\nopposite wing, the edge of which is thickened, coloured brown, and very\r\nsharp. In the right wing, but not in the left, there is a little plate,\r\nas transparent as talc, surrounded by nervures, and called the\r\nspeculum. In Ephippiger vitium, a member of this same family, we have a\r\ncurious subordinate modification; for the wing-covers are greatly\r\nreduced in size, but “the posterior part of the pro-thorax is elevated\r\ninto a kind of dome over the wing-covers, and which has probably the\r\neffect of increasing the sound.” (37. Westwood ‘Modern Classification\r\nof Insects,’ vol. i. p. 453.)\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the musical apparatus is more differentiated or\r\nspecialised in the Locustidae (which include, I believe, the most\r\npowerful performers in the Order), than in the Achetidae, in which both\r\nwing-covers have the same structure and the same function. (38.\r\nLandois, ‘Zeitschrift für wissenschaft. Zoolog.’ B. xvii. 1867, ss.\r\n121, 122.) Landois, however, detected in one of the Locustidae, namely\r\nin Decticus, a short and narrow row of small teeth, mere rudiments, on\r\nthe inferior surface of the right wing-cover, which underlies the other\r\nand is never used as the bow. I observed the same rudimentary structure\r\non the under side of the right wing-cover in Phasgonura viridissima.\r\nHence we may infer with confidence that the Locustidae are descended\r\nfrom a form, in which, as in the existing Achetidae, both wing-covers\r\nhad serrated nervures on the under surface, and could be indifferently\r\nused as the bow; but that in the Locustidae the two wing-covers\r\ngradually became differentiated and perfected, on the principle of the\r\ndivision of labour, the one to act exclusively as the bow, and the\r\nother as the fiddle. Dr. Gruber takes the same view, and has shewn that\r\nrudimentary teeth are commonly found on the inferior surface of the\r\nright wing. By what steps the more simple apparatus in the Achetidae\r\noriginated, we do not know, but it is probable that the basal portions\r\nof the wing-covers originally overlapped each other as they do at\r\npresent; and that the friction of the nervures produced a grating\r\nsound, as is now the case with the wing-covers of the females. (39. Mr.\r\nWalsh also informs me that he has noticed that the female of the\r\nPlatyphyllum concavum, “when captured makes a feeble grating noise by\r\nshuffling her wing-covers together.”) A grating sound thus occasionally\r\nand accidentally made by the males, if it served them ever so little as\r\na love-call to the females, might readily have been intensified through\r\nsexual selection, by variations in the roughness of the nervures having\r\nbeen continually preserved.\r\n\r\n[Fig.14. Hind-leg of Stenobothrus pratorum: r, the stridulating ridge;\r\nlower figure, the teeth forming the ridge, much magnified (from\r\nLandois).\r\n\r\nFig.15. Pneumora (from specimens in the British Museum). Upper figure,\r\nmale; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nIn the last and third family, namely the Acridiidae or grasshoppers,\r\nthe stridulation is produced in a very different manner, and according\r\nto Dr. Scudder, is not so shrill as in the preceding Families. The\r\ninner surface of the femur (Fig. 14, r) is furnished with a\r\nlongitudinal row of minute, elegant, lancet-shaped, elastic teeth, from\r\n85 to 93 in number (40. Landois, ibid. s. 113.); and these are scraped\r\nacross the sharp, projecting nervures on the wing-covers, which are\r\nthus made to vibrate and resound. Harris (41. ‘Insects of New England,’\r\n1842, p. 133.) says that when one of the males begins to play, he first\r\n“bends the shank of the hind-leg beneath the thigh, where it is lodged\r\nin a furrow designed to receive it, and then draws the leg briskly up\r\nand down. He does not play both fiddles together, but alternately,\r\nfirst upon one and then on the other.” In many species, the base of the\r\nabdomen is hollowed out into a great cavity which is believed to act as\r\na resounding board. In Pneumora (Fig. 15), a S. African genus belonging\r\nto the same family, we meet with a new and remarkable modification; in\r\nthe males a small notched ridge projects obliquely from each side of\r\nthe abdomen, against which the hind femora are rubbed. (42. Westwood,\r\n‘Modern Classification,’ vol i. p. 462.) As the male is furnished with\r\nwings (the female being wingless), it is remarkable that the thighs are\r\nnot rubbed in the usual manner against the wing-covers; but this may\r\nperhaps be accounted for by the unusually small size of the hind-legs.\r\nI have not been able to examine the inner surface of the thighs, which,\r\njudging from analogy, would be finely serrated. The species of Pneumora\r\nhave been more profoundly modified for the sake of stridulation than\r\nany other orthopterous insect; for in the male the whole body has been\r\nconverted into a musical instrument, being distended with air, like a\r\ngreat pellucid bladder, so as to increase the resonance. Mr. Trimen\r\ninforms me that at the Cape of Good Hope these insects make a wonderful\r\nnoise during the night.\r\n\r\nIn the three foregoing families, the females are almost always\r\ndestitute of an efficient musical apparatus. But there are a few\r\nexceptions to this rule, for Dr. Gruber has shewn that both sexes of\r\nEphippiger vitium are thus provided; though the organs differ in the\r\nmale and female to a certain extent. Hence we cannot suppose that they\r\nhave been transferred from the male to the female, as appears to have\r\nbeen the case with the secondary sexual characters of many other\r\nanimals. They must have been independently developed in the two sexes,\r\nwhich no doubt mutually call to each other during the season of love.\r\nIn most other Locustidae (but not according to Landois in Decticus) the\r\nfemales have rudiments of the stridulatory organs proper to the male;\r\nfrom whom it is probable that these have been transferred. Landois also\r\nfound such rudiments on the under surface of the wing-covers of the\r\nfemale Achetidae, and on the femora of the female Acridiidae. In the\r\nHomoptera, also, the females have the proper musical apparatus in a\r\nfunctionless state; and we shall hereafter meet in other divisions of\r\nthe animal kingdom with many instances of structures proper to the male\r\nbeing present in a rudimentary condition in the female.\r\n\r\nLandois has observed another important fact, namely, that in the\r\nfemales of the Acridiidae, the stridulating teeth on the femora remain\r\nthroughout life in the same condition in which they first appear during\r\nthe larval state in both sexes. In the males, on the other hand, they\r\nbecome further developed, and acquire their perfect structure at the\r\nlast moult, when the insect is mature and ready to breed.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts now given, we see that the means by which the males of\r\nthe Orthoptera produce their sounds are extremely diversified, and are\r\naltogether different from those employed by the Homoptera. (43. Landois\r\nhas recently found in certain Orthoptera rudimentary structures closely\r\nsimilar to the sound-producing organs in the Homoptera; and this is a\r\nsurprising fact. See ‘Zeitschrift für wissenschaft, Zoolog.’ B. xxii.\r\nHeft 3, 1871, p. 348.) But throughout the animal kingdom we often find\r\nthe same object gained by the most diversified means; this seems due to\r\nthe whole organisation having undergone multifarious changes in the\r\ncourse of ages, and as part after part varied different variations were\r\ntaken advantage of for the same general purpose. The diversity of means\r\nfor producing sound in the three families of the Orthoptera and in the\r\nHomoptera, impresses the mind with the high importance of these\r\nstructures to the males, for the sake of calling or alluring the\r\nfemales. We need feel no surprise at the amount of modification which\r\nthe Orthoptera have undergone in this respect, as we now know, from Dr.\r\nScudder’s remarkable discovery (44. ‘Transactions, Entomological\r\nSociety,’ 3rd series, vol. ii. (‘Journal of Proceedings,’ p. 117).),\r\nthat there has been more than ample time. This naturalist has lately\r\nfound a fossil insect in the Devonian formation of New Brunswick, which\r\nis furnished with “the well-known tympanum or stridulating apparatus of\r\nthe male Locustidae.” The insect, though in most respects related to\r\nthe Neuroptera, appears, as is so often the case with very ancient\r\nforms, to connect the two related Orders of the Neuroptera and\r\nOrthoptera.\r\n\r\nI have but little more to say on the Orthoptera. Some of the species\r\nare very pugnacious: when two male field-crickets (Gryllus campestris)\r\nare confined together, they fight till one kills the other; and the\r\nspecies of Mantis are described as manoeuvring with their sword-like\r\nfront-limbs, like hussars with their sabres. The Chinese keep these\r\ninsects in little bamboo cages, and match them like game-cocks. (45.\r\nWestwood, ‘Modern Classification of Insects,’ vol. i. p. 427; for\r\ncrickets, p. 445.) With respect to colour, some exotic locusts are\r\nbeautifully ornamented; the posterior wings being marked with red,\r\nblue, and black; but as throughout the Order the sexes rarely differ\r\nmuch in colour, it is not probable that they owe their bright tints to\r\nsexual selection. Conspicuous colours may be of use to these insects,\r\nby giving notice that they are unpalatable. Thus it has been observed\r\n(46. Mr. Ch. Horne, in ‘Proceedings of the Entomological Society,’ May\r\n3, 1869, p. xii.) that a bright-coloured Indian locust was invariably\r\nrejected when offered to birds and lizards. Some cases, however, are\r\nknown of sexual differences in colour in this Order. The male of an\r\nAmerican cricket (47. The Oecanthus nivalis, Harris, ‘Insects of New\r\nEngland,’ 1842, p. 124. The two sexes of OE. pellucidus of Europe\r\ndiffer, as I hear from Victor Carus, in nearly the same manner.) is\r\ndescribed as being as white as ivory, whilst the female varies from\r\nalmost white to greenish-yellow or dusky. Mr. Walsh informs me that the\r\nadult male of Spectrum femoratum (one of the Phasmidae) “is of a\r\nshining brownish-yellow colour; the adult female being of a dull,\r\nopaque, cinereous brown; the young of both sexes being green.” Lastly,\r\nI may mention that the male of one curious kind of cricket (48.\r\nPlatyblemnus: Westwood, ‘Modern Classification,’ vol. i. p. 447.) is\r\nfurnished with “a long membranous appendage, which falls over the face\r\nlike a veil;” but what its use may be, is not known.\r\n\r\nORDER, NEUROPTERA.\r\n\r\nLittle need here be said, except as to colour. In the Ephemeridae the\r\nsexes often differ slightly in their obscure tints (49. B.D. Walsh, the\r\n‘Pseudo-neuroptera of Illinois,’ in ‘Proceedings of the Entomological\r\nSociety of Philadelphia,’ 1862, p. 361.); but it is not probable that\r\nthe males are thus rendered attractive to the females. The\r\nLibellulidae, or dragon-flies, are ornamented with splendid green,\r\nblue, yellow, and vermilion metallic tints; and the sexes often differ.\r\nThus, as Prof. Westwood remarks (50. ‘Modern Classification,’ vol. ii.\r\np. 37.), the males of some of the Agrionidae, “are of a rich blue with\r\nblack wings, whilst the females are fine green with colourless wings.”\r\nBut in Agrion Ramburii these colours are exactly reversed in the two\r\nsexes. (51. Walsh, ibid. p. 381. I am indebted to this naturalist for\r\nthe following facts on Hetaerina, Anax, and Gomphus.) In the extensive\r\nN. American genus of Hetaerina, the males alone have a beautiful\r\ncarmine spot at the base of each wing. In Anax junius the basal part of\r\nthe abdomen in the male is a vivid ultramarine blue, and in the female\r\ngrass-green. In the allied genus Gomphus, on the other hand, and in\r\nsome other genera, the sexes differ but little in colour. In\r\nclosely-allied forms throughout the animal kingdom, similar cases of\r\nthe sexes differing greatly, or very little, or not at all, are of\r\nfrequent occurrence. Although there is so wide a difference in colour\r\nbetween the sexes of many Libellulidae, it is often difficult to say\r\nwhich is the more brilliant; and the ordinary coloration of the two\r\nsexes is reversed, as we have just seen, in one species of Agrion. It\r\nis not probable that their colours in any case have been gained as a\r\nprotection. Mr. MacLachlan, who has closely attended to this family,\r\nwrites to me that dragon-flies—the tyrants of the insect-world—are the\r\nleast liable of any insect to be attacked by birds or other enemies,\r\nand he believes that their bright colours serve as a sexual attraction.\r\nCertain dragon-flies apparently are attracted by particular colours:\r\nMr. Patterson observed (52. ‘Transactions, Ent. Soc.’ vol. i. 1836, p.\r\nlxxxi.) that the Agrionidae, of which the males are blue, settled in\r\nnumbers on the blue float of a fishing line; whilst two other species\r\nwere attracted by shining white colours.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, first noticed by Schelver, that, in several\r\ngenera belonging to two sub-families, the males on first emergence from\r\nthe pupal state, are coloured exactly like the females; but that their\r\nbodies in a short time assume a conspicuous milky-blue tint, owing to\r\nthe exudation of a kind of oil, soluble in ether and alcohol. Mr.\r\nMacLachlan believes that in the male of Libellula depressa this change\r\nof colour does not occur until nearly a fortnight after the\r\nmetamorphosis, when the sexes are ready to pair.\r\n\r\nCertain species of Neurothemis present, according to Brauer (53. See\r\nabstract in the ‘Zoological Record’ for 1867, p. 450.), a curious case\r\nof dimorphism, some of the females having ordinary wings, whilst others\r\nhave them “very richly netted, as in the males of the same species.”\r\nBrauer “explains the phenomenon on Darwinian principles by the\r\nsupposition that the close netting of the veins is a secondary sexual\r\ncharacter in the males, which has been abruptly transferred to some of\r\nthe females, instead of, as generally occurs, to all of them.” Mr.\r\nMacLachlan informs me of another instance of dimorphism in several\r\nspecies of Agrion, in which some individuals are of an orange colour,\r\nand these are invariably females. This is probably a case of reversion;\r\nfor in the true Libellulae, when the sexes differ in colour, the\r\nfemales are orange or yellow; so that supposing Agrion to be descended\r\nfrom some primordial form which resembled the typical Libellulae in its\r\nsexual characters, it would not be surprising that a tendency to vary\r\nin this manner should occur in the females alone.\r\n\r\nAlthough many dragon-flies are large, powerful, and fierce insects, the\r\nmales have not been observed by Mr. MacLachlan to fight together,\r\nexcepting, as he believes, in some of the smaller species of Agrion. In\r\nanother group in this Order, namely, the Termites or white ants, both\r\nsexes at the time of swarming may be seen running about, “the male\r\nafter the female, sometimes two chasing one female, and contending with\r\ngreat eagerness who shall win the prize.” (54. Kirby and Spence,\r\n‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. ii. 1818, p. 35.) The Atropos\r\npulsatorius is said to make a noise with its jaws, which is answered by\r\nother individuals. (55. Houzeau, ‘Les Facultés Mentales,’ etc. Tom. i.\r\np. 104.)\r\n\r\nORDER, HYMENOPTERA.\r\n\r\nThat inimitable observer, M. Fabre (56. See an interesting article,\r\n‘The Writings of Fabre,’ in ‘Nat. Hist. Review,’ April 1862, p. 122.),\r\nin describing the habits of Cerceris, a wasp-like insect, remarks that\r\n“fights frequently ensue between the males for the possession of some\r\nparticular female, who sits an apparently unconcerned beholder of the\r\nstruggle for supremacy, and when the victory is decided, quietly flies\r\naway in company with the conqueror.” Westwood (57. ‘Journal of\r\nProceedings of Entomological Society,’ Sept. 7, 1863, p. 169.) says\r\nthat the males of one of the saw-flies (Tenthredinae) “have been found\r\nfighting together, with their mandibles locked.” As M. Fabre speaks of\r\nthe males of Cerceris striving to obtain a particular female, it may be\r\nwell to bear in mind that insects belonging to this Order have the\r\npower of recognising each other after long intervals of time, and are\r\ndeeply attached. For instance, Pierre Huber, whose accuracy no one\r\ndoubts, separated some ants, and when, after an interval of four\r\nmonths, they met others which had formerly belonged to the same\r\ncommunity, they recognised and caressed one another with their\r\nantennae. Had they been strangers they would have fought together.\r\nAgain, when two communities engage in a battle, the ants on the same\r\nside sometimes attack each other in the general confusion, but they\r\nsoon perceive their mistake, and the one ant soothes the other. (58. P.\r\nHuber, ‘Recherches sur les Moeurs des Fourmis,’ 1810, pp. 150, 165.)\r\n\r\nIn this Order slight differences in colour, according to sex, are\r\ncommon, but conspicuous differences are rare except in the family of\r\nBees; yet both sexes of certain groups are so brilliantly coloured—for\r\ninstance in Chrysis, in which vermilion and metallic greens\r\nprevail—that we are tempted to attribute the result to sexual\r\nselection. In the Ichneumonidae, according to Mr. Walsh (59.\r\n‘Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia,’ 1866, pp.\r\n238, 239.), the males are almost universally lighter-coloured than the\r\nfemales. On the other hand, in the Tenthredinidae the males are\r\ngenerally darker than the females. In the Siricidae the sexes\r\nfrequently differ; thus the male of Sirex juvencus is banded with\r\norange, whilst the female is dark purple; but it is difficult to say\r\nwhich sex is the more ornamented. In Tremex columbae the female is much\r\nbrighter coloured than the male. I am informed by Mr. F. Smith, that\r\nthe male ants of several species are black, the females being\r\ntestaceous.\r\n\r\nIn the family of Bees, especially in the solitary species, as I hear\r\nfrom the same entomologist, the sexes often differ in colour. The males\r\nare generally the brighter, and in Bombus as well as in Apathus, much\r\nmore variable in colour than the females. In Anthophora retusa the male\r\nis of a rich fulvous-brown, whilst the female is quite black: so are\r\nthe females of several species of Xylocopa, the males being bright\r\nyellow. On the other hand the females of some species, as of Andraena\r\nfulva, are much brighter coloured than the males. Such differences in\r\ncolour can hardly be accounted for by the males being defenceless and\r\nthus requiring protection, whilst the females are well defended by\r\ntheir stings. H. Müller (60. ‘Anwendung der Darwinschen Lehre auf\r\nBienen,’ Verh. d. n. V. Jahrg. xxix.), who has particularly attended to\r\nthe habits of bees, attributes these differences in colour in chief\r\npart to sexual selection. That bees have a keen perception of colour is\r\ncertain. He says that the males search eagerly and fight for the\r\npossession of the females; and he accounts through such contests for\r\nthe mandibles of the males being in certain species larger than those\r\nof the females. In some cases the males are far more numerous than the\r\nfemales, either early in the season, or at all times and places, or\r\nlocally; whereas the females in other cases are apparently in excess.\r\nIn some species the more beautiful males appear to have been selected\r\nby the females; and in others the more beautiful females by the males.\r\nConsequently in certain genera (Müller, p. 42), the males of the\r\nseveral species differ much in appearance, whilst the females are\r\nalmost indistinguishable; in other genera the reverse occurs. H. Müller\r\nbelieves (p. 82) that the colours gained by one sex through sexual\r\nselection have often been transferred in a variable degree to the other\r\nsex, just as the pollen-collecting apparatus of the female has often\r\nbeen transferred to the male, to whom it is absolutely useless. (61. M.\r\nPerrier in his article ‘la Selection sexuelle d’après Darwin’ (‘Revue\r\nScientifique,’ Feb. 1873, p. 868), without apparently having reflected\r\nmuch on the subject, objects that as the males of social bees are known\r\nto be produced from unfertilised ova, they could not transmit new\r\ncharacters to their male offspring. This is an extraordinary objection.\r\nA female bee fertilised by a male, which presented some character\r\nfacilitating the union of the sexes, or rendering him more attractive\r\nto the female, would lay eggs which would produce only females; but\r\nthese young females would next year produce males; and will it be\r\npretended that such males would not inherit the characters of their\r\nmale grandfathers? To take a case with ordinary animals as nearly\r\nparallel as possible: if a female of any white quadruped or bird were\r\ncrossed by a male of a black breed, and the male and female offspring\r\nwere paired together, will it be pretended that the grandchildren would\r\nnot inherit a tendency to blackness from their male grandfather? The\r\nacquirement of new characters by the sterile worker-bees is a much more\r\ndifficult case, but I have endeavoured to shew in my ‘Origin of\r\nSpecies,’ how these sterile beings are subjected to the power of\r\nnatural selection.)\r\n\r\nMutilla Europaea makes a stridulating noise; and according to Goureau\r\n(62. Quoted by Westwood, ‘Modern Classification of Insects,’ vol. ii.\r\np. 214.) both sexes have this power. He attributes the sound to the\r\nfriction of the third and preceding abdominal segments, and I find that\r\nthese surfaces are marked with very fine concentric ridges; but so is\r\nthe projecting thoracic collar into which the head articulates, and\r\nthis collar, when scratched with the point of a needle, emits the\r\nproper sound. It is rather surprising that both sexes should have the\r\npower of stridulating, as the male is winged and the female wingless.\r\nIt is notorious that Bees express certain emotions, as of anger, by the\r\ntone of their humming; and according to H. Müller (p. 80), the males of\r\nsome species make a peculiar singing noise whilst pursuing the females.\r\n\r\nORDER, COLEOPTERA (BEETLES).\r\n\r\nMany beetles are coloured so as to resemble the surfaces which they\r\nhabitually frequent, and they thus escape detection by their enemies.\r\nOther species, for instance diamond-beetles, are ornamented with\r\nsplendid colours, which are often arranged in stripes, spots, crosses,\r\nand other elegant patterns. Such colours can hardly serve directly as a\r\nprotection, except in the case of certain flower-feeding species; but\r\nthey may serve as a warning or means of recognition, on the same\r\nprinciple as the phosphorescence of the glow-worm. As with beetles the\r\ncolours of the two sexes are generally alike, we have no evidence that\r\nthey have been gained through sexual selection; but this is at least\r\npossible, for they have been developed in one sex and then transferred\r\nto the other; and this view is even in some degree probable in those\r\ngroups which possess other well-marked secondary sexual characters.\r\nBlind beetles, which cannot of course behold each other’s beauty,\r\nnever, as I hear from Mr. Waterhouse, jun., exhibit bright colours,\r\nthough they often have polished coats; but the explanation of their\r\nobscurity may be that they generally inhabit caves and other obscure\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nSome Longicorns, especially certain Prionidae, offer an exception to\r\nthe rule that the sexes of beetles do not differ in colour. Most of\r\nthese insects are large and splendidly coloured. The males in the genus\r\nPyrodes (63. Pyrodes pulcherrimus, in which the sexes differ\r\nconspicuously, has been described by Mr. Bates in ‘Transact. Ent. Soc.’\r\n1869, p. 50. I will specify the few other cases in which I have heard\r\nof a difference in colour between the sexes of beetles. Kirby and\r\nSpence (‘Introduct. to Entomology,’ vol. iii. p. 301) mention a\r\nCantharis, Meloe, Rhagium, and the Leptura testacea; the male of the\r\nlatter being testaceous, with a black thorax, and the female of a dull\r\nred all over. These two latter beetles belong to the family of\r\nLongicorns. Messrs. R. Trimen and Waterhouse, jun., inform me of two\r\nLamellicorns, viz., a Peritrichia and Trichius, the male of the latter\r\nbeing more obscurely coloured than the female. In Tillus elongatus the\r\nmale is black, and the female always, as it is believed, of a dark blue\r\ncolour, with a red thorax. The male, also, of Orsodacna atra, as I hear\r\nfrom Mr. Walsh, is black, the female (the so-called O. ruficollis)\r\nhaving a rufous thorax.), which I saw in Mr. Bates’s collection, are\r\ngenerally redder but rather duller than the females, the latter being\r\ncoloured of a more or less splendid golden-green. On the other hand, in\r\none species the male is golden-green, the female being richly tinted\r\nwith red and purple. In the genus Esmeralda the sexes differ so greatly\r\nin colour that they have been ranked as distinct species; in one\r\nspecies both are of a beautiful shining green, but the male has a red\r\nthorax. On the whole, as far as I could judge, the females of those\r\nPrionidae, in which the sexes differ, are coloured more richly than the\r\nmales, and this does not accord with the common rule in regard to\r\ncolour, when acquired through sexual selection.\r\n\r\n[Fig.16. Chalcosoma atlas. Upper figure, male (reduced); lower figure,\r\nfemale (nat. size).\r\n\r\nFig. 17. Copris isidis.\r\n\r\nFig. 18. Phanaeus faunus.\r\n\r\nFig. 19. Dipelicus cantori.\r\n\r\nFig. 20. Onthophagus rangifer, enlarged. (In Figs. 17 to 20 the\r\nleft-hand figures are males.)]\r\n\r\nA most remarkable distinction between the sexes of many beetles is\r\npresented by the great horns which rise from the head, thorax, and\r\nclypeus of the males; and in some few cases from the under surface of\r\nthe body. These horns, in the great family of the Lamellicorns,\r\nresemble those of various quadrupeds, such as stags, rhinoceroses,\r\netc., and are wonderful both from their size and diversified shapes.\r\nInstead of describing them, I have given figures of the males and\r\nfemales of some of the more remarkable forms. (Figs. 16 to 20.) The\r\nfemales generally exhibit rudiments of the horns in the form of small\r\nknobs or ridges; but some are destitute of even the slightest rudiment.\r\nOn the other hand, the horns are nearly as well developed in the female\r\nas in the male Phanaeus lancifer; and only a little less well developed\r\nin the females of some other species of this genus and of Copris. I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Bates that the horns do not differ in any manner\r\ncorresponding with the more important characteristic differences\r\nbetween the several subdivisions of the family: thus within the same\r\nsection of the genus Onthophagus, there are species which have a single\r\nhorn, and others which have two.\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases, the horns are remarkable from their excessive\r\nvariability; so that a graduated series can be formed, from the most\r\nhighly developed males to others so degenerate that they can barely be\r\ndistinguished from the females. Mr. Walsh (64. ‘Proceedings of the\r\nEntomological Society of Philadephia,’ 1864, p. 228.) found that in\r\nPhanaeus carnifex the horns were thrice as long in some males as in\r\nothers. Mr. Bates, after examining above a hundred males of Onthophagus\r\nrangifer (Fig. 20), thought that he had at last discovered a species in\r\nwhich the horns did not vary; but further research proved the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary size of the horns, and their widely different\r\nstructure in closely-allied forms, indicate that they have been formed\r\nfor some purpose; but their excessive variability in the males of the\r\nsame species leads to the inference that this purpose cannot be of a\r\ndefinite nature. The horns do not shew marks of friction, as if used\r\nfor any ordinary work. Some authors suppose (65. Kirby and Spence,\r\n‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. iii. p. 300.) that as the males\r\nwander about much more than the females, they require horns as a\r\ndefence against their enemies; but as the horns are often blunt, they\r\ndo not seem well adapted for defence. The most obvious conjecture is\r\nthat they are used by the males for fighting together; but the males\r\nhave never been observed to fight; nor could Mr. Bates, after a careful\r\nexamination of numerous species, find any sufficient evidence, in their\r\nmutilated or broken condition, of their having been thus used. If the\r\nmales had been habitual fighters, the size of their bodies would\r\nprobably have been increased through sexual selection, so as to have\r\nexceeded that of the females; but Mr. Bates, after comparing the two\r\nsexes in above a hundred species of the Copridae, did not find any\r\nmarked difference in this respect amongst well-developed individuals.\r\nIn Lethrus, moreover, a beetle belonging to the same great division of\r\nthe Lamellicorns, the males are known to fight, but are not provided\r\nwith horns, though their mandibles are much larger than those of the\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that the horns have been acquired as ornaments is that\r\nwhich best agrees with the fact of their having been so immensely, yet\r\nnot fixedly, developed,—as shewn by their extreme variability in the\r\nsame species, and by their extreme diversity in closely-allied species.\r\nThis view will at first appear extremely improbable; but we shall\r\nhereafter find with many animals standing much higher in the scale,\r\nnamely fishes, amphibians, reptiles and birds, that various kinds of\r\ncrests, knobs, horns and combs have been developed apparently for this\r\nsole purpose.\r\n\r\n[Fig.21. Onitis furcifer, male viewed from beneath.\r\n\r\nFig.22. Onitis furcifer. Left-hand figure, male, viewed laterally.\r\nRight-hand figure, female. a. Rudiment of cephalic horn. b. Trace of\r\nthoracic horn or crest.]\r\n\r\nThe males of Onitis furcifer (Fig. 21), and of some other species of\r\nthe genus, are furnished with singular projections on their anterior\r\nfemora, and with a great fork or pair of horns on the lower surface of\r\nthe thorax. Judging from other insects, these may aid the male in\r\nclinging to the female. Although the males have not even a trace of a\r\nhorn on the upper surface of the body, yet the females plainly exhibit\r\na rudiment of a single horn on the head (Fig. 22, a), and of a crest\r\n(b) on the thorax. That the slight thoracic crest in the female is a\r\nrudiment of a projection proper to the male, though entirely absent in\r\nthe male of this particular species, is clear: for the female of Bubas\r\nbison (a genus which comes next to Onitis) has a similar slight crest\r\non the thorax, and the male bears a great projection in the same\r\nsituation. So, again, there can hardly be a doubt that the little point\r\n(a) on the head of the female Onitis furcifer, as well as on the head\r\nof the females of two or three allied species, is a rudimentary\r\nrepresentative of the cephalic horn, which is common to the males of so\r\nmany Lamellicorn beetles, as in Phanaeus (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\nThe old belief that rudiments have been created to complete the scheme\r\nof nature is here so far from holding good, that we have a complete\r\ninversion of the ordinary state of things in the family. We may\r\nreasonably suspect that the males originally bore horns and transferred\r\nthem to the females in a rudimentary condition, as in so many other\r\nLamellicorns. Why the males subsequently lost their horns, we know not;\r\nbut this may have been caused through the principle of compensation,\r\nowing to the development of the large horns and projections on the\r\nlower surface; and as these are confined to the males, the rudiments of\r\nthe upper horns on the females would not have been thus obliterated.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 23. Bledius taurus, magnified. Left-hand figure, male; right-hand\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nThe cases hitherto given refer to the Lamellicorns, but the males of\r\nsome few other beetles, belonging to two widely distinct groups,\r\nnamely, the Curculionidae and Staphylinidae, are furnished with\r\nhorns—in the former on the lower surface of the body (66. Kirby and\r\nSpence, ‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. iii. p. 329.), in the latter\r\non the upper surface of the head and thorax. In the Staphylinidae, the\r\nhorns of the males are extraordinarily variable in the same species,\r\njust as we have seen with the Lamellicorns. In Siagonium we have a case\r\nof dimorphism, for the males can be divided into two sets, differing\r\ngreatly in the size of their bodies and in the development of their\r\nhorns, without intermediate gradations. In a species of Bledius (Fig.\r\n23), also belonging to the Staphylinidae, Professor Westwood states\r\nthat, “male specimens can be found in the same locality in which the\r\ncentral horn of the thorax is very large, but the horns of the head\r\nquite rudimental; and others, in which the thoracic horn is much\r\nshorter, whilst the protuberances on the head are long.” (67. ‘Modern\r\nClassification of Insects,’ vol. i. p. 172: Siagonium, p. 172. In the\r\nBritish Museum I noticed one male specimen of Siagonium in an\r\nintermediate condition, so that the dimorphism is not strict.) Here we\r\napparently have a case of compensation, which throws light on that just\r\ngiven, of the supposed loss of the upper horns by the males of Onitis.\r\n\r\nLAW OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\nSome male beetles, which seem ill-fitted for fighting, nevertheless\r\nengage in conflicts for the possession of the females. Mr. Wallace (68.\r\n‘The Malay Archipelago,’ vol. ii. 1869, p. 276. Riley, Sixth ‘Report on\r\nInsects of Missouri,’ 1874, p. 115.) saw two males of Leptorhynchus\r\nangustatus, a linear beetle with a much elongated rostrum, “fighting\r\nfor a female, who stood close by busy at her boring. They pushed at\r\neach other with their rostra, and clawed and thumped, apparently in the\r\ngreatest rage.” The smaller male, however, “soon ran away,\r\nacknowledging himself vanquished.” In some few cases male beetles are\r\nwell adapted for fighting, by possessing great toothed mandibles, much\r\nlarger than those of the females. This is the case with the common\r\nstag-beetle (Lucanus cervus), the males of which emerge from the pupal\r\nstate about a week before the other sex, so that several may often be\r\nseen pursuing the same female. At this season they engage in fierce\r\nconflicts. When Mr. A.H. Davis (69. ‘Entomological Magazine,’ vol. i.\r\n1833, p. 82. See also on the conflicts of this species, Kirby and\r\nSpence, ibid. vol. iii. p. 314; and Westwood, ibid. vol. i. p. 187.)\r\nenclosed two males with one female in a box, the larger male severely\r\npinched the smaller one, until he resigned his pretensions. A friend\r\ninforms me that when a boy he often put the males together to see them\r\nfight, and he noticed that they were much bolder and fiercer than the\r\nfemales, as with the higher animals. The males would seize hold of his\r\nfinger, if held in front of them, but not so the females, although they\r\nhave stronger jaws. The males of many of the Lucanidae, as well as of\r\nthe above-mentioned Leptorhynchus, are larger and more powerful insects\r\nthan the females. The two sexes of Lethrus cephalotes (one of the\r\nLamellicorns) inhabit the same burrow; and the male has larger\r\nmandibles than the female. If, during the breeding-season, a strange\r\nmale attempts to enter the burrow, he is attacked; the female does not\r\nremain passive, but closes the mouth of the burrow, and encourages her\r\nmate by continually pushing him on from behind; and the battle lasts\r\nuntil the aggressor is killed or runs away. (70. Quoted from Fischer,\r\nin ‘Dict. Class. d’Hist. Nat.’ tom. x. p. 324.) The two sexes of\r\nanother Lamellicorn beetle, the Ateuchus cicatricosus, live in pairs,\r\nand seem much attached to each other; the male excites the females to\r\nroll the balls of dung in which the ova are deposited; and if she is\r\nremoved, he becomes much agitated. If the male is removed the female\r\nceases all work, and as M. Brulerie believes, would remain on the same\r\nspot until she died. (71. ‘Ann. Soc. Entomolog. France,’ 1866, as\r\nquoted in ‘Journal of Travel,’ by A. Murray, 1868, p. 135.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 24. Chiasognathus Grantii, reduced. Upper figure, male; lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nThe great mandibles of the male Lucanidae are extremely variable both\r\nin size and structure, and in this respect resemble the horns on the\r\nhead and thorax of many male Lamellicorns and Staphylinidae. A perfect\r\nseries can be formed from the best-provided to the worst-provided or\r\ndegenerate males. Although the mandibles of the common stag-beetle, and\r\nprobably of many other species, are used as efficient weapons for\r\nfighting, it is doubtful whether their great size can thus be accounted\r\nfor. We have seen that they are used by the Lucanus elaphus of N.\r\nAmerica for seizing the female. As they are so conspicuous and so\r\nelegantly branched, and as owing to their great length they are not\r\nwell adapted for pinching, the suspicion has crossed my mind that they\r\nmay in addition serve as an ornament, like the horns on the head and\r\nthorax of the various species above described. The male Chiasognathus\r\ngrantii of S. Chile—a splendid beetle belonging to the same family—has\r\nenormously developed mandibles (Fig. 24); he is bold and pugnacious;\r\nwhen threatened he faces round, opens his great jaws, and at the same\r\ntime stridulates loudly. But the mandibles were not strong enough to\r\npinch my finger so as to cause actual pain.\r\n\r\nSexual selection, which implies the possession of considerable\r\nperceptive powers and of strong passions, seems to have been more\r\neffective with the Lamellicorns than with any other family of beetles.\r\nWith some species the males are provided with weapons for fighting;\r\nsome live in pairs and shew mutual affection; many have the power of\r\nstridulating when excited; many are furnished with the most\r\nextraordinary horns, apparently for the sake of ornament; and some,\r\nwhich are diurnal in their habits, are gorgeously coloured. Lastly,\r\nseveral of the largest beetles in the world belong to this family,\r\nwhich was placed by Linnaeus and Fabricius as the head of the Order.\r\n(72. Westwood, ‘Modern Classification,’ vol. i. p. 184.)\r\n\r\nSTRIDULATING ORGANS.\r\n\r\nBeetles belonging to many and widely distinct families possess these\r\norgans. The sound thus produced can sometimes be heard at the distance\r\nof several feet or even yards (73. Wollaston, ‘On Certain Musical\r\nCurculionidae,’ ‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. vi. 1860, p. 14.),\r\nbut it is not comparable with that made by the Orthoptera. The rasp\r\ngenerally consists of a narrow, slightly-raised surface, crossed by\r\nvery fine, parallel ribs, sometimes so fine as to cause iridescent\r\ncolours, and having a very elegant appearance under the microscope. In\r\nsome cases, as with Typhoeus, minute, bristly or scale-like\r\nprominences, with which the whole surrounding surface is covered in\r\napproximately parallel lines, could be traced passing into the ribs of\r\nthe rasp. The transition takes place by their becoming confluent and\r\nstraight, and at the same time more prominent and smooth. A hard ridge\r\non an adjoining part of the body serves as the scraper for the rasp,\r\nbut this scraper in some cases has been specially modified for the\r\npurpose. It is rapidly moved across the rasp, or conversely the rasp\r\nacross the scraper.\r\n\r\n[Fig.25. Necrophorus (from Landois). r. The two rasps. Left-hand\r\nfigure, part of the rasp highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThese organs are situated in widely different positions. In the\r\ncarrion-beetles (Necrophorus) two parallel rasps (r, Fig. 25) stand on\r\nthe dorsal surface of the fifth abdominal segment, each rasp (74.\r\nLandois, ‘Zeitschrift fur wissenschaft Zoolog.’ B. xvii. 1867, s. 127.)\r\nconsisting of 126 to 140 fine ribs. These ribs are scraped against the\r\nposterior margins of the elytra, a small portion of which projects\r\nbeyond the general outline. In many Crioceridae, and in Clythra\r\n4-punctata (one of the Chrysomelidae), and in some Tenebrionidae, etc.\r\n(75. I am greatly indebted to Mr. G.R. Crotch for having sent me many\r\nprepared specimens of various beetles belonging to these three families\r\nand to others, as well as for valuable information. He believes that\r\nthe power of stridulation in the Clythra has not been previously\r\nobserved. I am also much indebted to Mr. E.W. Janson, for information\r\nand specimens. I may add that my son, Mr. F. Darwin, finds that\r\nDermestes murinus stridulates, but he searched in vain for the\r\napparatus. Scolytus has lately been described by Dr. Chapman as a\r\nstridulator, in the ‘Entomologist’s Monthly Magazine,’ vol. vi. p.\r\n130.), the rasp is seated on the dorsal apex of the abdomen, on the\r\npygidium or pro-pygidium, and is scraped in the same manner by the\r\nelytra. In Heterocerus, which belongs to another family, the rasps are\r\nplaced on the sides of the first abdominal segment, and are scraped by\r\nridges on the femora. (76. Schiodte, translated, in ‘Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History,’ vol. xx. 1867, p. 37.) In certain\r\nCurculionidae and Carabidae (77. Westring has described (Kroyer,\r\n‘Naturhist. Tidskrift,’ B. ii. 1848-49, p. 334) the stridulating organs\r\nin these two, as well as in other families. In the Carabidae I have\r\nexamined Elaphrus uliginosus and Blethisa multipunctata, sent to me by\r\nMr. Crotch. In Blethisa the transverse ridges on the furrowed border of\r\nthe abdominal segment do not, as far as I could judge, come into play\r\nin scraping the rasps on the elytra.), the parts are completely\r\nreversed in position, for the rasps are seated on the inferior surface\r\nof the elytra, near their apices, or along their outer margins, and the\r\nedges of the abdominal segments serve as the scrapers. In Pelobius\r\nHermanni (one of Dytiscidae or water-beetles) a strong ridge runs\r\nparallel and near to the sutural margin of the elytra, and is crossed\r\nby ribs, coarse in the middle part, but becoming gradually finer at\r\nboth ends, especially at the upper end; when this insect is held under\r\nwater or in the air, a stridulating noise is produced by the extreme\r\nhorny margin of the abdomen being scraped against the rasps. In a great\r\nnumber of long-horned beetles (Longicornia) the organs are situated\r\nquite otherwise, the rasp being on the meso-thorax, which is rubbed\r\nagainst the pro-thorax; Landois counted 238 very fine ribs on the rasp\r\nof Cerambyx heros.\r\n\r\n[Fig.26. Hind-leg of Geotrupes stercorarius (from Landois). r. Rasp. c.\r\nCoxa. f. Femur. t. Tibia. tr. Tarsi.]\r\n\r\nMany Lamellicorns have the power of stridulating, and the organs differ\r\ngreatly in position. Some species stridulate very loudly, so that when\r\nMr. F. Smith caught a Trox sabulosus, a gamekeeper, who stood by,\r\nthought he had caught a mouse; but I failed to discover the proper\r\norgans in this beetle. In Geotrupes and Typhoeus, a narrow ridge runs\r\nobliquely across (r, Fig. 26) the coxa of each hind-leg (having in G.\r\nstercorarius 84 ribs), which is scraped by a specially projecting part\r\nof one of the abdominal segments. In the nearly allied Copris lunaris,\r\nan excessively narrow fine rasp runs along the sutural margin of the\r\nelytra, with another short rasp near the basal outer margin; but in\r\nsome other Coprini the rasp is seated, according to Leconte (78. I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Walsh, of Illinois, for having sent me extracts from\r\nLeconte’s ‘Introduction to Entomology,’ pp. 101, 143.), on the dorsal\r\nsurface of the abdomen. In Oryctes it is seated on the pro-pygidium;\r\nand, according to the same entomologist, in some other Dynastini, on\r\nthe under surface of the elytra. Lastly, Westring states that in\r\nOmaloplia brunnea the rasp is placed on the pro-sternum, and the\r\nscraper on the meta-sternum, the parts thus occupying the under surface\r\nof the body, instead of the upper surface as in the Longicorns.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that in the different coleopterous families the\r\nstridulating organs are wonderfully diversified in position, but not\r\nmuch in structure. Within the same family some species are provided\r\nwith these organs, and others are destitute of them. This diversity is\r\nintelligible, if we suppose that originally various beetles made a\r\nshuffling or hissing noise by the rubbing together of any hard and\r\nrough parts of their bodies, which happened to be in contact; and that\r\nfrom the noise thus produced being in some way useful, the rough\r\nsurfaces were gradually developed into regular stridulating organs.\r\nSome beetles as they move, now produce, either intentionally or\r\nunintentionally, a shuffling noise, without possessing any proper\r\norgans for the purpose. Mr. Wallace informs me that the Euchirus\r\nlongimanus (a Lamellicorn, with the anterior legs wonderfully elongated\r\nin the male) “makes, whilst moving, a low hissing sound by the\r\nprotrusion and contraction of the abdomen; and when seized it produces\r\na grating sound by rubbing its hind-legs against the edges of the\r\nelytra.” The hissing sound is clearly due to a narrow rasp running\r\nalong the sutural margin of each elytron; and I could likewise make the\r\ngrating sound by rubbing the shagreened surface of the femur against\r\nthe granulated margin of the corresponding elytron; but I could not\r\nhere detect any proper rasp; nor is it likely that I could have\r\noverlooked it in so large an insect. After examining Cychrus, and\r\nreading what Westring has written about this beetle, it seems very\r\ndoubtful whether it possesses any true rasp, though it has the power of\r\nemitting a sound.\r\n\r\nFrom the analogy of the Orthoptera and Homoptera, I expected to find\r\nthe stridulating organs in the Coleoptera differing according to sex;\r\nbut Landois, who has carefully examined several species, observed no\r\nsuch difference; nor did Westring; nor did Mr. G.R. Crotch in preparing\r\nthe many specimens which he had the kindness to send me. Any difference\r\nin these organs, if slight, would, however, be difficult to detect, on\r\naccount of their great variability. Thus, in the first pair of\r\nspecimens of Necrophorus humator and of Pelobius which I examined, the\r\nrasp was considerably larger in the male than in the female; but not so\r\nwith succeeding specimens. In Geotrupes stercorarius the rasp appeared\r\nto me thicker, opaquer, and more prominent in three males than in the\r\nsame number of females; in order, therefore, to discover whether the\r\nsexes differed in their power of stridulating, my son, Mr. F. Darwin,\r\ncollected fifty-seven living specimens, which he separated into two\r\nlots, according as they made a greater or lesser noise, when held in\r\nthe same manner. He then examined all these specimens, and found that\r\nthe males were very nearly in the same proportion to the females in\r\nboth the lots. Mr. F. Smith has kept alive numerous specimens of\r\nMonoynchus pseudacori (Curculionidae), and is convinced that both sexes\r\nstridulate, and apparently in an equal degree.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the power of stridulating is certainly a sexual character\r\nin some few Coleoptera. Mr. Crotch discovered that the males alone of\r\ntwo species of Heliopathes (Tenebrionidae) possess stridulating organs.\r\nI examined five males of H. gibbus, and in all these there was a\r\nwell-developed rasp, partially divided into two, on the dorsal surface\r\nof the terminal abdominal segment; whilst in the same number of females\r\nthere was not even a rudiment of the rasp, the membrane of this segment\r\nbeing transparent, and much thinner than in the male. In H.\r\ncribratostriatus the male has a similar rasp, excepting that it is not\r\npartially divided into two portions, and the female is completely\r\ndestitute of this organ; the male in addition has on the apical margins\r\nof the elytra, on each side of the suture, three or four short\r\nlongitudinal ridges, which are crossed by extremely fine ribs, parallel\r\nto and resembling those on the abdominal rasp; whether these ridges\r\nserve as an independent rasp, or as a scraper for the abdominal rasp, I\r\ncould not decide: the female exhibits no trace\r\n\r\nof this latter structure.\r\n\r\nAgain, in three species of the Lamellicorn genus Oryctes, we have a\r\nnearly parallel case. In the females of O. gryphus and nasicornis the\r\nribs on the rasp of the pro-pygidium are less continuous and less\r\ndistinct than in the males; but the chief difference is that the whole\r\nupper surface of this segment, when held in the proper light, is seen\r\nto be clothed with hairs, which are absent or are represented by\r\nexcessively fine down in the males. It should be noticed that in all\r\nColeoptera the effective part of the rasp is destitute of hairs. In O.\r\nsenegalensis the difference between the sexes is more strongly marked,\r\nand this is best seen when the proper abdominal segment is cleaned and\r\nviewed as a transparent object. In the female the whole surface is\r\ncovered with little separate crests, bearing spines; whilst in the male\r\nthese crests in proceeding towards the apex, become more and more\r\nconfluent, regular, and naked; so that three-fourths of the segment is\r\ncovered with extremely fine parallel ribs, which are quite absent in\r\nthe female. In the females, however, of all three species of Oryctes, a\r\nslight grating or stridulating sound is produced, when the abdomen of a\r\nsoftened specimen is pushed backwards and forwards.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Heliopathes and Oryctes there can hardly be a doubt\r\nthat the males stridulate in order to call or to excite the females;\r\nbut with most beetles the stridulation apparently serves both sexes as\r\na mutual call. Beetles stridulate under various emotions, in the same\r\nmanner as birds use their voices for many purposes besides singing to\r\ntheir mates. The great Chiasognathus stridulates in anger or defiance;\r\nmany species do the same from distress or fear, if held so that they\r\ncannot escape; by striking the hollow stems of trees in the Canary\r\nIslands, Messrs. Wollaston and Crotch were able to discover the\r\npresence of beetles belonging to the genus Acalles by their\r\nstridulation. Lastly, the male Ateuchus stridulates to encourage the\r\nfemale in her work, and from distress when she is removed. (79. M. P.\r\nde la Brulerie, as quoted in ‘Journal of Travel,’ A. Murray, vol. i.\r\n1868, p. 135.) Some naturalists believe that beetles make this noise to\r\nfrighten away their enemies; but I cannot think that a quadruped or\r\nbird, able to devour a large beetle, would be frightened by so slight a\r\nsound. The belief that the stridulation serves as a sexual call is\r\nsupported by the fact that death-ticks (Anobium tessellatum) are well\r\nknown to answer each other’s ticking, and, as I have myself observed, a\r\ntapping noise artificially made. Mr. Doubleday also informs me that he\r\nhas sometimes observed a female ticking (80. According to Mr.\r\nDoubleday, “the noise is produced by the insect raising itself on its\r\nlegs as high as it can, and then striking its thorax five or six times,\r\nin rapid succession, against the substance upon which it is sitting.”\r\nFor references on this subject see Landois, ‘Zeitschrift für wissen.\r\nZoolog.’ B. xvii. s. 131. Olivier says (as quoted by Kirby and Spence,\r\n‘Introduction to Entomology,’ vol. ii. p. 395) that the female of\r\nPimelia striata produces a rather loud sound by striking her abdomen\r\nagainst any hard substance, “and that the male, obedient to this call,\r\nsoon attends her, and they pair.”), and in an hour or two afterwards\r\nhas found her united with a male, and on one occasion surrounded by\r\nseveral males. Finally, it is probable that the two sexes of many kinds\r\nof beetles were at first enabled to find each other by the slight\r\nshuffling noise produced by the rubbing together of the adjoining hard\r\nparts of their bodies; and that as those males or females which made\r\nthe greatest noise succeeded best in finding partners, rugosities on\r\nvarious parts of their bodies were gradually developed by means of\r\nsexual selection into true stridulating organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nINSECTS, continued. ORDER LEPIDOPTERA. (BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCourtship of butterflies—Battles—Ticking noise—Colours common to both\r\n\r\nsexes, or more brilliant in the males—Examples—Not due to the direct\r\naction of the conditions of life—Colours adapted for protection—Colours\r\nof moths—Display—Perceptive powers of the\r\nLepidoptera—Variability—Causes of the difference in colour between the\r\nmales and females—Mimicry, female butterflies more brilliantly coloured\r\nthan the males—Bright colours of caterpillars—Summary and concluding\r\nremarks on the secondary sexual characters of insects—Birds and insects\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\nIn this great Order the most interesting points for us are the\r\ndifferences in colour between the sexes of the same species, and\r\nbetween the distinct species of the same genus. Nearly the whole of the\r\nfollowing chapter will be devoted to this subject; but I will first\r\nmake a few remarks on one or two other points. Several males may often\r\nbe seen pursuing and crowding round the same female. Their courtship\r\nappears to be a prolonged affair, for I have frequently watched one or\r\nmore males pirouetting round a female until I was tired, without seeing\r\nthe end of the courtship. Mr. A.G. Butler also informs me that he has\r\nseveral times watched a male courting a female for a full quarter of an\r\nhour; but she pertinaciously refused him, and at last settled on the\r\nground and closed her wings, so as to escape from his addresses.\r\n\r\nAlthough butterflies are weak and fragile creatures, they are\r\npugnacious, and an emperor butterfly (1. Apatura Iris: ‘The\r\nEntomologist’s Weekly Intelligence,’ 1859, p. 139. For the Bornean\r\nButterflies, see C. Collingwood, ‘Rambles of a Naturalist,’ 1868, p.\r\n183.) has been captured with the tips of its wings broken from a\r\nconflict with another male. Mr. Collingwood, in speaking of the\r\nfrequent battles between the butterflies of Borneo, says, “They whirl\r\nround each other with the greatest rapidity, and appear to be incited\r\nby the greatest ferocity.”\r\n\r\nThe Ageronia feronia makes a noise like that produced by a toothed\r\nwheel passing under a spring catch, and which can be heard at the\r\ndistance of several yards: I noticed this sound at Rio de Janeiro, only\r\nwhen two of these butterflies were chasing each other in an irregular\r\ncourse, so that it is probably made during the courtship of the sexes.\r\n(2. See my ‘Journal of Researches,’ 1845, p. 33. Mr. Doubleday has\r\ndetected (‘Proc. Ent. Soc.’ March 3, 1845, p. 123) a peculiar\r\nmembranous sac at the base of the front wings, which is probably\r\nconnected with the production of the sound. For the case of Thecophora,\r\nsee ‘Zoological Record,’ 1869, p. 401. For Mr. Buchanan White’s\r\nobservations, the Scottish Naturalist, July 1872, p. 214.)\r\n\r\nSome moths also produce sounds; for instance, the males Theocophora\r\nfovea. On two occasions Mr. F. Buchanan White (3. ‘The Scottish\r\nNaturalist,’ July 1872, p. 213.) heard a sharp quick noise made by the\r\nmale of Hylophila prasinana, and which he believes to be produced, as\r\nin Cicada, by an elastic membrane, furnished with a muscle. He quotes,\r\nalso, Guenee, that Setina produces a sound like the ticking of a watch,\r\napparently by the aid of “two large tympaniform vesicles, situated in\r\nthe pectoral region”; and these “are much more developed in the male\r\nthan in the female.” Hence the sound-producing organs in the\r\nLepidoptera appear to stand in some relation with the sexual functions.\r\nI have not alluded to the well-known noise made by the Death’s Head\r\nSphinx, for it is generally heard soon after the moth has emerged from\r\nits cocoon.\r\n\r\nGiard has always observed that the musky odour, which is emitted by two\r\nspecies of Sphinx moths, is peculiar to the males (4. ‘Zoological\r\nRecord,’ 1869, p. 347.); and in the higher classes we shall meet with\r\nmany instances of the males alone being odoriferous.\r\n\r\nEvery one must have admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies and\r\nof some moths; and it may be asked, are their colours and diversified\r\npatterns the result of the direct action of the physical conditions to\r\nwhich these insects have been exposed, without any benefit being thus\r\nderived? Or have successive variations been accumulated and determined\r\nas a protection, or for some unknown purpose, or that one sex may be\r\nattractive to the other? And, again, what is the meaning of the colours\r\nbeing widely different in the males and females of certain species, and\r\nalike in the two sexes of other species of the same genus? Before\r\nattempting to answer these questions a body of facts must be given.\r\n\r\nWith our beautiful English butterflies, the admiral, peacock, and\r\npainted lady (Vanessae), as well as many others, the sexes are alike.\r\nThis is also the case with the magnificent Heliconidae, and most of the\r\nDanaidae in the tropics. But in certain other tropical groups, and in\r\nsome of our English butterflies, as the purple emperor, orange-tip,\r\netc. (Apatura Iris and Anthocharis cardamines), the sexes differ either\r\ngreatly or slightly in colour. No language suffices to describe the\r\nsplendour of the males of some tropical species. Even within the same\r\ngenus we often find species presenting extraordinary differences\r\nbetween the sexes, whilst others have their sexes closely alike. Thus\r\nin the South American genus Epicalia, Mr. Bates, to whom I am indebted\r\nfor most of the following facts, and for looking over this whole\r\ndiscussion, informs me that he knows twelve species, the two sexes of\r\nwhich haunt the same stations (and this is not always the case with\r\nbutterflies), and which, therefore, cannot have been differently\r\naffected by external conditions. (5. See also Mr. Bates’s paper in\r\n‘Proc. Ent. Soc. of Philadelphia,’ 1865, p. 206. Also Mr. Wallace on\r\nthe same subject, in regard to Diadema, in ‘Transactions, Entomological\r\nSociety of London,’ 1869, p. 278.) In nine of these twelve species the\r\nmales rank amongst the most brilliant of all butterflies, and differ so\r\ngreatly from the comparatively plain females that they were formerly\r\nplaced in distinct genera. The females of these nine species resemble\r\neach other in their general type of coloration; and they likewise\r\nresemble both sexes of the species in several allied genera found in\r\nvarious parts of the world. Hence we may infer that these nine species,\r\nand probably all the others of the genus, are descended from an\r\nancestral form which was coloured in nearly the same manner. In the\r\ntenth species the female still retains the same general colouring, but\r\nthe male resembles her, so that he is coloured in a much less gaudy and\r\ncontrasted manner than the males of the previous species. In the\r\neleventh and twelfth species, the females depart from the usual type,\r\nfor they are gaily decorated almost like the males, but in a somewhat\r\nless degree. Hence in these two latter species the bright colours of\r\nthe males seem to have been transferred to the females; whilst in the\r\ntenth species the male has either retained or recovered the plain\r\ncolours of the female, as well as of the parent-form of the genus. The\r\nsexes in these three cases have thus been rendered nearly alike, though\r\nin an opposite manner. In the allied genus Eubagis, both sexes of some\r\nof the species are plain-coloured and nearly alike; whilst with the\r\ngreater number the males are decorated with beautiful metallic tints in\r\na diversified manner, and differ much from their females. The females\r\nthroughout the genus retain the same general style of colouring, so\r\nthat they resemble one another much more closely than they resemble\r\ntheir own males.\r\n\r\nIn the genus Papilio, all the species of the Aeneas group are\r\nremarkable for their conspicuous and strongly contrasted colours, and\r\nthey illustrate the frequent tendency to gradation in the amount of\r\ndifference between the sexes. In a few species, for instance in P.\r\nascanius, the males and females are alike; in others the males are\r\neither a little brighter, or very much more superb than the females.\r\nThe genus Junonia, allied to our Vanessae, offers a nearly parallel\r\ncase, for although the sexes of most of the species resemble each\r\nother, and are destitute of rich colours, yet in certain species, as in\r\nJ. oenone, the male is rather more bright-coloured than the female, and\r\nin a few (for instance J. andremiaja) the male is so different from the\r\nfemale that he might be mistaken for an entirely distinct species.\r\n\r\nAnother striking case was pointed out to me in the British Museum by\r\nMr. A. Butler, namely, one of the tropical American Theclae, in which\r\nboth sexes are nearly alike and wonderfully splendid; in another\r\nspecies the male is coloured in a similarly gorgeous manner, whilst the\r\nwhole upper surface of the female is of a dull uniform brown. Our\r\ncommon little English blue butterflies of the genus Lycaena, illustrate\r\nthe various differences in colour between the sexes, almost as well,\r\nthough not in so striking a manner, as the above exotic genera. In\r\nLycaena agestis both sexes have wings of a brown colour, bordered with\r\nsmall ocellated orange spots, and are thus alike. In L. oegon the wings\r\nof the males are of a fine blue, bordered with black, whilst those of\r\nthe female are brown, with a similar border, closely resembling the\r\nwings of L. agestis. Lastly, in L. arion both sexes are of a blue\r\ncolour and are very like, though in the female the edges of the wings\r\nare rather duskier, with the black spots plainer; and in a bright blue\r\nIndian species both sexes are still more alike.\r\n\r\nI have given the foregoing details in order to shew, in the first\r\nplace, that when the sexes of butterflies differ, the male as a general\r\nrule is the more beautiful, and departs more from the usual type of\r\ncolouring of the group to which the species belongs. Hence in most\r\ngroups the females of the several species resemble each other much more\r\nclosely than do the males. In some cases, however, to which I shall\r\nhereafter allude, the females are coloured more splendidly than the\r\nmales. In the second place, these details have been given to bring\r\nclearly before the mind that within the same genus, the two sexes\r\nfrequently present every gradation from no difference in colour, to so\r\ngreat a difference that it was long before the two were placed by\r\nentomologists in the same genus. In the third place, we have seen that\r\nwhen the sexes nearly resemble each other, this appears due either to\r\nthe male having transferred his colours to the female, or to the male\r\nhaving retained, or perhaps recovered, the primordial colours of the\r\ngroup. It also deserves notice that in those groups in which the sexes\r\ndiffer, the females usually somewhat resemble the males, so that when\r\nthe males are beautiful to an extraordinary degree, the females almost\r\ninvariably exhibit some degree of beauty. From the many cases of\r\ngradation in the amount of difference between the sexes, and from the\r\nprevalence of the same general type of coloration throughout the whole\r\nof the same group, we may conclude that the causes have generally been\r\nthe same which have determined the brilliant colouring of the males\r\nalone of some species, and of both sexes of other species.\r\n\r\nAs so many gorgeous butterflies inhabit the tropics, it has often been\r\nsupposed that they owe their colours to the great heat and moisture of\r\nthese zones; but Mr. Bates (6. ‘The Naturalist on the Amazons,’ vol. i.\r\n1863, p. 19.) has shown by the comparison of various closely-allied\r\ngroups of insects from the temperate and tropical regions, that this\r\nview cannot be maintained; and the evidence becomes conclusive when\r\nbrilliantly-coloured males and plain-coloured females of the same\r\nspecies inhabit the same district, feed on the same food, and follow\r\nexactly the same habits of life. Even when the sexes resemble each\r\nother, we can hardly believe that their brilliant and\r\nbeautifully-arranged colours are the purposeless result of the nature\r\nof the tissues and of the action of the surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nWith animals of all kinds, whenever colour has been modified for some\r\nspecial purpose, this has been, as far as we can judge, either for\r\ndirect or indirect protection, or as an attraction between the sexes.\r\nWith many species of butterflies the upper surfaces of the wings are\r\nobscure; and this in all probability leads to their escaping\r\nobservation and danger. But butterflies would be particularly liable to\r\nbe attacked by their enemies when at rest; and most kinds whilst\r\nresting raise their wings vertically over their backs, so that the\r\nlower surface alone is exposed to view. Hence it is this side which is\r\noften coloured so as to imitate the objects on which these insects\r\ncommonly rest. Dr. Rossler, I believe, first noticed the similarity of\r\nthe closed wings of certain Vanessae and other butterflies to the bark\r\nof trees. Many analogous and striking facts could be given. The most\r\ninteresting one is that recorded by Mr. Wallace (7. See the interesting\r\narticle in the ‘Westminster Review,’ July 1867, p. 10. A woodcut of the\r\nKallima is given by Mr. Wallace in ‘Hardwicke’s Science Gossip,’\r\nSeptember 1867, p. 196.) of a common Indian and Sumatran butterfly\r\n(Kallima) which disappears like magic when it settles on a bush; for it\r\nhides its head and antennae between its closed wings, which, in form,\r\ncolour and veining, cannot be distinguished from a withered leaf with\r\nits footstalk. In some other cases the lower surfaces of the wings are\r\nbrilliantly coloured, and yet are protective; thus in Thecla rubi the\r\nwings when closed are of an emerald green, and resemble the young\r\nleaves of the bramble, on which in spring this butterfly may often be\r\nseen seated. It is also remarkable that in very many species in which\r\nthe sexes differ greatly in colour on their upper surface, the lower\r\nsurface is closely similar or identical in both sexes, and serves as a\r\nprotection. (8. Mr. G. Fraser, in ‘Nature,’ April 1871, p. 489.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the obscure tints both of the upper and under sides of many\r\nbutterflies no doubt serve to conceal them, yet we cannot extend this\r\nview to the brilliant and conspicuous colours on the upper surface of\r\nsuch species as our admiral and peacock Vanessae, our white\r\ncabbage-butterflies (Pieris), or the great swallow-tail Papilio which\r\nhaunts the open fens—for these butterflies are thus rendered visible to\r\nevery living creature. In these species both sexes are alike; but in\r\nthe common brimstone butterfly (Gonepteryx rhamni), the male is of an\r\nintense yellow, whilst the female is much paler; and in the orange-tip\r\n(Anthocharis cardamines) the males alone have their wings tipped with\r\nbright orange. Both the males and females in these cases are\r\nconspicuous, and it is not credible that their difference in colour\r\nshould stand in any relation to ordinary protection. Prof. Weismann\r\nremarks (9. ‘Einfluss der Isolirung auf die Artbildung,’ 1872, p. 58.),\r\nthat the female of one of the Lycaenae expands her brown wings when she\r\nsettles on the ground, and is then almost invisible; the male, on the\r\nother hand, as if aware of the danger incurred from the bright blue of\r\nthe upper surface of his wings, rests with them closed; and this shows\r\nthat the blue colour cannot be in any way protective. Nevertheless, it\r\nis probable that conspicuous colours are indirectly beneficial to many\r\nspecies, as a warning that they are unpalatable. For in certain other\r\ncases, beauty has been gained through the imitation of other beautiful\r\nspecies, which inhabit the same district and enjoy an immunity from\r\nattack by being in some way offensive to their enemies; but then we\r\nhave to account for the beauty of the imitated species.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Walsh has remarked to me, the females of our orange-tip\r\nbutterfly, above referred to, and of an American species (Anth.\r\ngenutia) probably shew us the primordial colours of the parent-species\r\nof the genus; for both sexes of four or five widely-distributed species\r\nare coloured in nearly the same manner. As in several previous cases,\r\nwe may here infer that it is the males of Anth. cardamines and genutia\r\nwhich have departed from the usual type of the genus. In the Anth. sara\r\nfrom California, the orange-tips to the wings have been partially\r\ndeveloped in the female; but they are paler than in the male, and\r\nslightly different in some other respects. In an allied Indian form,\r\nthe Iphias glaucippe, the orange-tips are fully developed in both\r\nsexes. In this Iphias, as pointed out to me by Mr. A. Butler, the under\r\nsurface of the wings marvellously resembles a pale-coloured leaf; and\r\nin our English orange-tip, the under surface resembles the flower-head\r\nof the wild parsley, on which the butterfly often rests at night. (10.\r\nSee the interesting observations by T.W. Wood, ‘The Student,’ Sept.\r\n1868, p. 81.) The same reason which compels us to believe that the\r\nlower surfaces have here been coloured for the sake of protection,\r\nleads us to deny that the wings have been tipped with bright orange for\r\nthe same purpose, especially when this character is confined to the\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nMost Moths rest motionless during the whole or greater part of the day\r\nwith their wings depressed; and the whole upper surface is often shaded\r\nand coloured in an admirable manner, as Mr. Wallace has remarked, for\r\nescaping detection. The front-wings of the Bombycidae and Noctuidae\r\n(11. Mr. Wallace in ‘Hardwicke’s Science Gossip,’ September 1867, p.\r\n193.), when at rest, generally overlap and conceal the hind-wings; so\r\nthat the latter might be brightly coloured without much risk; and they\r\nare in fact often thus coloured. During flight, moths would often be\r\nable to escape from their enemies; nevertheless, as the hind-wings are\r\nthen fully exposed to view, their bright colours must generally have\r\nbeen acquired at some little risk. But the following fact shews how\r\ncautious we ought to be in drawing conclusions on this head. The common\r\nYellow Under-wings (Triphaena) often fly about during the day or early\r\nevening, and are then conspicuous from the colour of their hind-wings.\r\nIt would naturally be thought that this would be a source of danger;\r\nbut Mr. J. Jenner Weir believes that it actually serves them as a means\r\nof escape, for birds strike at these brightly coloured and fragile\r\nsurfaces, instead of at the body. For instance, Mr. Weir turned into\r\nhis aviary a vigorous specimen of Triphaena pronuba, which was\r\ninstantly pursued by a robin; but the bird’s attention being caught by\r\nthe coloured wings, the moth was not captured until after about fifty\r\nattempts, and small portions of the wings were repeatedly broken off.\r\nHe tried the same experiment, in the open air, with a swallow and T.\r\nfimbria; but the large size of this moth probably interfered with its\r\ncapture. (12. See also, on this subject, Mr. Weir’s paper in\r\n‘Transactions, Entomological Society,’ 1869, p. 23.) We are thus\r\nreminded of a statement made by Mr. Wallace (13. ‘Westminster Review,’\r\nJuly 1867, p. 16.), namely, that in the Brazilian forests and Malayan\r\nislands, many common and highly-decorated butterflies are weak flyers,\r\nthough furnished with a broad expanse of wing; and they “are often\r\ncaptured with pierced and broken wings, as if they had been seized by\r\nbirds, from which they had escaped: if the wings had been much smaller\r\nin proportion to the body, it seems probable that the insect would more\r\nfrequently have been struck or pierced in a vital part, and thus the\r\nincreased expanse of the wings may have been indirectly beneficial.”\r\n\r\nDISPLAY.\r\n\r\nThe bright colours of many butterflies and of some moths are specially\r\narranged for display, so that they may be readily seen. During the\r\nnight colours are not visible, and there can be no doubt that the\r\nnocturnal moths, taken as a body, are much less gaily decorated than\r\nbutterflies, all of which are diurnal in their habits. But the moths of\r\ncertain families, such as the Zygaenidae, several Sphingidae,\r\nUraniidae, some Arctiidae and Saturniidae, fly about during the day or\r\nearly evening, and many of these are extremely beautiful, being far\r\nbrighter coloured than the strictly nocturnal kinds. A few exceptional\r\ncases, however, of bright-coloured nocturnal species have been\r\nrecorded. (14. For instance, Lithosia; but Prof. Westwood (‘Modern\r\nClass. of Insects,’ vol. ii. p. 390) seems surprised at this case. On\r\nthe relative colours of diurnal and nocturnal Lepidoptera, see ibid.\r\npp. 333 and 392; also Harris, ‘Treatise on the Insects of New England,’\r\n1842, p. 315.)\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of another kind in regard to display. Butterflies, as\r\nbefore remarked, elevate their wings when at rest, but whilst basking\r\nin the sunshine often alternately raise and depress them, thus exposing\r\nboth surfaces to full view; and although the lower surface is often\r\ncoloured in an obscure manner as a protection, yet in many species it\r\nis as highly decorated as the upper surface, and sometimes in a very\r\ndifferent manner. In some tropical species the lower surface is even\r\nmore brilliantly coloured than the upper. (15. Such differences between\r\nthe upper and lower surfaces of the wings of several species of Papilio\r\nmay be seen in the beautiful plates to Mr. Wallace’s ‘Memoir on the\r\nPapilionidae of the Malayan Region,’ in ‘Transactions of the Linnean\r\nSociety,’ vol. xxv. part i. 1865.) In the English fritillaries\r\n(Argynnis) the lower surface alone is ornamented with shining silver.\r\nNevertheless, as a general rule, the upper surface, which is probably\r\nmore fully exposed, is coloured more brightly and diversely than the\r\nlower. Hence the lower surface generally affords to entomologists the\r\nmore useful character for detecting the affinities of the various\r\nspecies. Fritz Müller informs me that three species of Castnia are\r\nfound near his house in S. Brazil: of two of them the hind-wings are\r\nobscure, and are always covered by the front-wings when these\r\nbutterflies are at rest; but the third species has black hind-wings,\r\nbeautifully spotted with red and white, and these are fully expanded\r\nand displayed whenever the butterfly rests. Other such cases could be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the enormous group of moths, which, as I hear from\r\nMr. Stainton, do not habitually expose the under surface of their wings\r\nto full view, we find this side very rarely coloured with a brightness\r\ngreater than, or even equal to, that of the upper side. Some exceptions\r\nto the rule, either real or apparent, must be noticed, as the case of\r\nHypopyra. (16. See Mr. Wormald on this moth: ‘Proceedings of the\r\nEntomological Society,’ March 2, 1868.) Mr. Trimen informs me that in\r\nGuenee’s great work, three moths are figured, in which the under\r\nsurface is much the more brilliant. For instance, in the Australian\r\nGastrophora the upper surface of the fore-wing is pale\r\ngreyish-ochreous, while the lower surface is magnificently ornamented\r\nby an ocellus of cobalt-blue, placed in the midst of a black mark,\r\nsurrounded by orange-yellow, and this by bluish-white. But the habits\r\nof these three moths are unknown; so that no explanation can be given\r\nof their unusual style of colouring. Mr. Trimen also informs me that\r\nthe lower surface of the wings in certain other Geometrae (17. See also\r\nan account of the S. American genus Erateina (one of the Geometrae) in\r\n‘Transactions, Ent. Soc.’ new series, vol. v. pl. xv. and xvi.) and\r\nquadrifid Noctuae are either more variegated or more brightly-coloured\r\nthan the upper surface; but some of these species have the habit of\r\n“holding their wings quite erect over their backs, retaining them in\r\nthis position for a considerable time,” and thus exposing the under\r\nsurface to view. Other species, when settled on the ground or herbage,\r\nnow and then suddenly and slightly lift up their wings. Hence the lower\r\nsurface of the wings being brighter than the upper surface in certain\r\nmoths is not so anomalous as it at first appears. The Saturniidae\r\ninclude some of the most beautiful of all moths, their wings being\r\ndecorated, as in our British Emperor moth, with fine ocelli; and Mr.\r\nT.W. Wood (18. ‘Proc Ent. Soc. of London,’ July 6, 1868, p. xxvii.)\r\nobserves that they resemble butterflies in some of their movements;\r\n“for instance, in the gentle waving up and down of the wings as if for\r\ndisplay, which is more characteristic of diurnal than of nocturnal\r\nLepidoptera.”\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that no British moths which are brilliantly\r\ncoloured, and, as far as I can discover, hardly any foreign species,\r\ndiffer much in colour according to sex; though this is the case with\r\nmany brilliant butterflies. The male, however, of one American moth,\r\nthe Saturnia Io, is described as having its fore-wings deep yellow,\r\ncuriously marked with purplish-red spots; whilst the wings of the\r\nfemale are purple-brown, marked with grey lines. (19. Harris,\r\n‘Treatise,’ etc., edited by Flint, 1862, p. 395.) The British moths\r\nwhich differ sexually in colour are all brown, or of various dull\r\nyellow tints, or nearly white. In several species the males are much\r\ndarker than the females (20. For instance, I observe in my son’s\r\ncabinet that the males are darker than the females in the Lasiocampa\r\nquercus, Odonestis potatoria, Hypogymna dispar, Dasychira pudibunda,\r\nand Cycnia mendica. In this latter species the difference in colour\r\nbetween the two sexes is strongly marked; and Mr. Wallace informs me\r\nthat we here have, as he believes, an instance of protective mimicry\r\nconfined to one sex, as will hereafter be more fully explained. The\r\nwhite female of the Cycnia resembles the very common Spilosoma\r\nmenthrasti, both sexes of which are white; and Mr. Stainton observed\r\nthat this latter moth was rejected with utter disgust by a whole brood\r\nof young turkeys, which were fond of eating other moths; so that if the\r\nCycnia was commonly mistaken by British birds for the Spilosoma, it\r\nwould escape being devoured, and its white deceptive colour would thus\r\nbe highly beneficial.), and these belong to groups which generally fly\r\nabout during the afternoon. On the other hand, in many genera, as Mr.\r\nStainton informs me, the males have the hind-wings whiter than those of\r\nthe female—of which fact Agrotis exclamationis offers a good instance.\r\nIn the Ghost Moth (Hepialus humuli) the difference is more strongly\r\nmarked; the males being white, and the females yellow with darker\r\nmarkings. (21. It is remarkable, that in the Shetland Islands the male\r\nof this moth, instead of differing widely from the female, frequently\r\nresembles her closely in colour (see Mr. MacLachlan, ‘Transactions,\r\nEntomological Society,’ vol. ii. 1866, p. 459). Mr. G. Fraser suggests\r\n(‘Nature,’ April 1871, p. 489) that at the season of the year when the\r\nghost-moth appears in these northern islands, the whiteness of the\r\nmales would not be needed to render them visible to the females in the\r\ntwilight night.) It is probable that in these cases the males are thus\r\nrendered more conspicuous, and more easily seen by the females whilst\r\nflying about in the dusk.\r\n\r\nFrom the several foregoing facts it is impossible to admit that the\r\nbrilliant colours of butterflies, and of some few moths, have commonly\r\nbeen acquired for the sake of protection. We have seen that their\r\ncolours and elegant patterns are arranged and exhibited as if for\r\ndisplay. Hence I am led to believe that the females prefer or are most\r\nexcited by the more brilliant males; for on any other supposition the\r\nmales would, as far as we can see, be ornamented to no purpose. We know\r\nthat ants and certain Lamellicorn beetles are capable of feeling an\r\nattachment for each other, and that ants recognise their fellows after\r\nan interval of several months. Hence there is no abstract improbability\r\nin the Lepidoptera, which probably stand nearly or quite as high in the\r\nscale as these insects, having sufficient mental capacity to admire\r\nbright colours. They certainly discover flowers by colour. The\r\nHumming-bird Sphinx may often be seen to swoop down from a distance on\r\na bunch of flowers in the midst of green foliage; and I have been\r\nassured by two persons abroad, that these moths repeatedly visit\r\nflowers painted on the walls of a room, and vainly endeavour to insert\r\ntheir proboscis into them. Fritz Müller informs me that several kinds\r\nof butterflies in S. Brazil shew an unmistakable preference for certain\r\ncolours over others: he observed that they very often visited the\r\nbrilliant red flowers of five or six genera of plants, but never the\r\nwhite or yellow flowering species of the same and other genera, growing\r\nin the same garden; and I have received other accounts to the same\r\neffect. As I hear from Mr. Doubleday, the common white butterfly often\r\nflies down to a bit of paper on the ground, no doubt mistaking it for\r\none of its own species. Mr. Collingwood (22. ‘Rambles of a Naturalist\r\nin the Chinese Seas,’ 1868, p. 182.) in speaking of the difficulty in\r\ncollecting certain butterflies in the Malay Archipelago, states that “a\r\ndead specimen pinned upon a conspicuous twig will often arrest an\r\ninsect of the same species in its headlong flight, and bring it down\r\nwithin easy reach of the net, especially if it be of the opposite sex.”\r\n\r\nThe courtship of butterflies is, as before remarked, a prolonged\r\naffair. The males sometimes fight together in rivalry; and many may be\r\nseen pursuing or crowding round the same female. Unless, then, the\r\nfemales prefer one male to another, the pairing must be left to mere\r\nchance, and this does not appear probable. If, on the other band, the\r\nfemales habitually, or even occasionally, prefer the more beautiful\r\nmales, the colours of the latter will have been rendered brighter by\r\ndegrees, and will have been transmitted to both sexes or to one sex,\r\naccording to the law of inheritance which has prevailed. The process of\r\nsexual selection will have been much facilitated, if the conclusion can\r\nbe trusted, arrived at from various kinds of evidence in the supplement\r\nto the ninth chapter; namely, that the males of many Lepidoptera, at\r\nleast in the imago state, greatly exceed the females in number.\r\n\r\nSome facts, however, are opposed to the belief that female butterflies\r\nprefer the more beautiful males; thus, as I have been assured by\r\nseveral collectors, fresh females may frequently be seen paired with\r\nbattered, faded, or dingy males; but this is a circumstance which could\r\nhardly fail often to follow from the males emerging from their cocoons\r\nearlier than the females. With moths of the family of the Bombycidae,\r\nthe sexes pair immediately after assuming the imago state; for they\r\ncannot feed, owing to the rudimentary condition of their mouths. The\r\nfemales, as several entomologists have remarked to me, lie in an almost\r\ntorpid state, and appear not to evince the least choice in regard to\r\ntheir partners. This is the case with the common silk-moth (B. mori),\r\nas I have been told by some continental and English breeders. Dr.\r\nWallace, who has had great experience in breeding Bombyx cynthia, is\r\nconvinced that the females evince no choice or preference. He has kept\r\nabove 300 of these moths together, and has often found the most\r\nvigorous females mated with stunted males. The reverse appears to occur\r\nseldom; for, as he believes, the more vigorous males pass over the\r\nweakly females, and are attracted by those endowed with most vitality.\r\nNevertheless, the Bombycidae, though obscurely-coloured, are often\r\nbeautiful to our eyes from their elegant and mottled shades.\r\n\r\nI have as yet only referred to the species in which the males are\r\nbrighter coloured than the females, and I have attributed their beauty\r\nto the females for many generations having chosen and paired with the\r\nmore attractive males. But converse cases occur, though rarely, in\r\nwhich the females are more brilliant than the males; and here, as I\r\nbelieve, the males have selected the more beautiful females, and have\r\nthus slowly added to their beauty. We do not know why in various\r\nclasses of animals the males of some few species have selected the more\r\nbeautiful females instead of having gladly accepted any female, as\r\nseems to be the general rule in the animal kingdom: but if, contrary to\r\nwhat generally occurs with the Lepidoptera, the females were much more\r\nnumerous than the males, the latter would be likely to pick out the\r\nmore beautiful females. Mr. Butler shewed me several species of\r\nCallidryas in the British Museum, in some of which the females\r\nequalled, and in others greatly surpassed the males in beauty; for the\r\nfemales alone have the borders of their wings suffused with crimson and\r\norange, and spotted with black. The plainer males of these species\r\nclosely resemble each other, shewing that here the females have been\r\nmodified; whereas in those cases, where the males are the more ornate,\r\nit is these which have been modified, the females remaining closely\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nIn England we have some analogous cases, though not so marked. The\r\nfemales alone of two species of Thecla have a bright-purple or orange\r\npatch on their fore-wings. In Hipparchia the sexes do not differ much;\r\nbut it is the female of H. janira which has a conspicuous light-brown\r\npatch on her wings; and the females of some of the other species are\r\nbrighter coloured than their males. Again, the females of Colias edusa\r\nand hyale have “orange or yellow spots on the black marginal border,\r\nrepresented in the males only by thin streaks”; and in Pieris it is the\r\nfemales which “are ornamented with black spots on the fore-wings, and\r\nthese are only partially present in the males.” Now the males of many\r\nbutterflies are known to support the females during their marriage\r\nflight; but in the species just named it is the females which support\r\nthe males; so that the part which the two sexes play is reversed, as is\r\ntheir relative beauty. Throughout the animal kingdom the males commonly\r\ntake the more active share in wooing, and their beauty seems to have\r\nbeen increased by the females having accepted the more attractive\r\nindividuals; but with these butterflies, the females take the more\r\nactive part in the final marriage ceremony, so that we may suppose that\r\nthey likewise do so in the wooing; and in this case we can understand\r\nhow it is that they have been rendered the more beautiful. Mr. Meldola,\r\nfrom whom the foregoing statements have been taken, says in conclusion:\r\n“Though I am not convinced of the action of sexual selection in\r\nproducing the colours of insects, it cannot be denied that these facts\r\nare strikingly corroborative of Mr. Darwin’s views.” (23. ‘Nature,’\r\nApril 27, 1871, p. 508. Mr. Meldola quotes Donzel, in ‘Soc. Ent. de\r\nFrance,’ 1837, p. 77, on the flight of butterflies whilst pairing. See\r\nalso Mr. G. Fraser, in ‘Nature,’ April 20, 1871, p. 489, on the sexual\r\ndifferences of several British butterflies.)\r\n\r\nAs sexual selection primarily depends on variability, a few words must\r\nbe added on this subject. In respect to colour there is no difficulty,\r\nfor any number of highly variable Lepidoptera could be named. One good\r\ninstance will suffice. Mr. Bates shewed me a whole series of specimens\r\nof Papilio sesostris and P. childrenae; in the latter the males varied\r\nmuch in the extent of the beautifully enamelled green patch on the\r\nfore-wings, and in the size of the white mark, and of the splendid\r\ncrimson stripe on the hind-wings; so that there was a great contrast\r\namongst the males between the most and the least gaudy. The male of\r\nPapilio sesostris is much less beautiful than of P. childrenae; and it\r\nlikewise varies a little in the size of the green patch on the\r\nfore-wings, and in the occasional appearance of the small crimson\r\nstripe on the hind-wings, borrowed, as it would seem, from its own\r\nfemale; for the females of this and of many other species in the Aeneas\r\ngroup possess this crimson stripe. Hence between the brightest\r\nspecimens of P. sesostris and the dullest of P. childrenae, there was\r\nbut a small interval; and it was evident that as far as mere\r\nvariability is concerned, there would be no difficulty in permanently\r\nincreasing the beauty of either species by means of selection. The\r\nvariability is here almost confined to the male sex; but Mr. Wallace\r\nand Mr. Bates have shewn (24. Wallace on the Papilionidae of the\r\nMalayan Region, in ‘Transact. Linn. Soc.’ vol. xxv. 1865, pp. 8, 36. A\r\nstriking case of a rare variety, strictly intermediate between two\r\nother well-marked female varieties, is given by Mr. Wallace. See also\r\nMr. Bates, in ‘Proc. Entomolog. Soc.’ Nov. 19, 1866, p. xl.) that the\r\nfemales of some species are extremely variable, the males being nearly\r\nconstant. In a future chapter I shall have occasion to shew that the\r\nbeautiful eye-like spots, or ocelli, found on the wings of many\r\nLepidoptera, are eminently variable. I may here add that these ocelli\r\noffer a difficulty on the theory of sexual selection; for though\r\nappearing to us so ornamental, they are never present in one sex and\r\nabsent in the other, nor do they ever differ much in the two sexes.\r\n(25. Mr. Bates was so kind as to lay this subject before the\r\nEntomological Society, and I have received answers to this effect from\r\nseveral entomologists.) This fact is at present inexplicable; but if it\r\nshould hereafter be found that the formation of an ocellus is due to\r\nsome change in the tissues of the wings, for instance, occurring at a\r\nvery early period of development, we might expect, from what we know of\r\nthe laws of inheritance, that it would be transmitted to both sexes,\r\nthough arising and perfected in one sex alone.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, although many serious objections may be urged, it seems\r\nprobable that most of the brilliantly-coloured species of Lepidoptera\r\nowe their colours to sexual selection, excepting in certain cases,\r\npresently to be mentioned, in which conspicuous colours have been\r\ngained through mimicry as a protection. From the ardour of the male\r\nthroughout the animal kingdom, he is generally willing to accept any\r\nfemale; and it is the female which usually exerts a choice. Hence, if\r\nsexual selection has been efficient with the Lepidoptera, the male,\r\nwhen the sexes differ, ought to be the more brilliantly coloured, and\r\nthis undoubtedly is the case. When both sexes are brilliantly coloured\r\nand resemble each other, the characters acquired by the males appear to\r\nhave been transmitted to both. We are led to this conclusion by cases,\r\neven within the same genus, of gradation from an extraordinary amount\r\nof difference to identity in colour between the two sexes.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked whether the difference in colour between the sexes\r\nmay not be accounted for by other means besides sexual selection. Thus\r\nthe males and females of the same species of butterfly are in several\r\ncases known (26. H.W. Bates, ‘The Naturalist on the Amazons,’ vol. ii.\r\n1863, p. 228. A.R. Wallace, in ‘Transactions, Linnean Society,’ vol.\r\nxxv. 1865, p. 10.) to inhabit different stations, the former commonly\r\nbasking in the sunshine, the latter haunting gloomy forests. It is\r\ntherefore possible that different conditions of life may have acted\r\ndirectly on the two sexes; but this is not probable (27. On this whole\r\nsubject see ‘The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’\r\n1868, vol. ii. chap. xxiii.) as in the adult state they are exposed to\r\ndifferent conditions during a very short period; and the larvae of both\r\nare exposed to the same conditions. Mr. Wallace believes that the\r\ndifference between the sexes is due not so much to the males having\r\nbeen modified, as to the females having in all or almost all cases\r\nacquired dull colours for the sake of protection. It seems to me, on\r\nthe contrary, far more probable that it is the males which have been\r\nchiefly modified through sexual selection, the females having been\r\ncomparatively little changed. We can thus understand how it is that the\r\nfemales of allied species generally resemble one another so much more\r\nclosely than do the males. They thus shew us approximately the\r\nprimordial colouring of the parent-species of the group to which they\r\nbelong. They have, however, almost always been somewhat modified by the\r\ntransfer to them of some of the successive variations, through the\r\naccumulation of which the males were rendered beautiful. But I do not\r\nwish to deny that the females alone of some species may have been\r\nspecially modified for protection. In most cases the males and females\r\nof distinct species will have been exposed during their prolonged\r\nlarval state to different conditions, and may have been thus affected;\r\nthough with the males any slight change of colour thus caused will\r\ngenerally have been masked by the brilliant tints gained through sexual\r\nselection. When we treat of Birds, I shall have to discuss the whole\r\nquestion, as to how far the differences in colour between the sexes are\r\ndue to the males having been modified through sexual selection for\r\nornamental purposes, or to the females having been modified through\r\nnatural selection for the sake of protection, so that I will here say\r\nbut little on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn all the cases in which the more common form of equal inheritance by\r\nboth sexes has prevailed, the selection of bright-coloured males would\r\ntend to make the females bright-coloured; and the selection of\r\ndull-coloured females would tend to make the males dull. If both\r\nprocesses were carried on simultaneously, they would tend to counteract\r\neach other; and the final result would depend on whether a greater\r\nnumber of females from being well protected by obscure colours, or a\r\ngreater number of males by being brightly-coloured and thus finding\r\npartners, succeeded in leaving more numerous offspring.\r\n\r\nIn order to account for the frequent transmission of characters to one\r\nsex alone, Mr. Wallace expresses his belief that the more common form\r\nof equal inheritance by both sexes can be changed through natural\r\nselection into inheritance by one sex alone, but in favour of this view\r\nI can discover no evidence. We know from what occurs under\r\ndomestication that new characters often appear, which from the first\r\nare transmitted to one sex alone; and by the selection of such\r\nvariations there would not be the slightest difficulty in giving bright\r\ncolours to the males alone, and at the same time or subsequently, dull\r\ncolours to the females alone. In this manner the females of some\r\nbutterflies and moths have, it is probable, been rendered inconspicuous\r\nfor the sake of protection, and widely different from their males.\r\n\r\nI am, however, unwilling without distinct evidence to admit that two\r\ncomplex processes of selection, each requiring the transference of new\r\ncharacters to one sex alone, have been carried on with a multitude of\r\nspecies,—that the males have been rendered more brilliant by beating\r\ntheir rivals, and the females more dull-coloured by having escaped from\r\ntheir enemies. The male, for instance, of the common brimstone\r\nbutterfly (Gonepteryx), is of a far more intense yellow than the\r\nfemale, though she is equally conspicuous; and it does not seem\r\nprobable that she specially acquired her pale tints as a protection,\r\nthough it is probable that the male acquired his bright colours as a\r\nsexual attraction. The female of Anthocharis cardamines does not\r\npossess the beautiful orange wing-tips of the male; consequently she\r\nclosely resembles the white butterflies (Pieris) so common in our\r\ngardens; but we have no evidence that this resemblance is beneficial to\r\nher. As, on the other hand, she resembles both sexes of several other\r\nspecies of the genus inhabiting various quarters of the world, it is\r\nprobable that she has simply retained to a large extent her primordial\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nFinally, as we have seen, various considerations lead to the conclusion\r\nthat with the greater number of brilliantly-coloured Lepidoptera it is\r\nthe male which has been chiefly modified through sexual selection; the\r\namount of difference between the sexes mostly depending on the form of\r\ninheritance which has prevailed. Inheritance is governed by so many\r\nunknown laws or conditions, that it seems to us to act in a capricious\r\nmanner (28. The ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’\r\nvol. ii. chap. xii. p. 17.); and we can thus, to a certain extent,\r\nunderstand how it is that with closely allied species the sexes either\r\ndiffer to an astonishing degree, or are identical in colour. As all the\r\nsuccessive steps in the process of variation are necessarily\r\ntransmitted through the female, a greater or less number of such steps\r\nmight readily become developed in her; and thus we can understand the\r\nfrequent gradations from an extreme difference to none at all between\r\nthe sexes of allied species. These cases of gradation, it may be added,\r\nare much too common to favour the supposition that we here see females\r\nactually undergoing the process of transition and losing their\r\nbrightness for the sake of protection; for we have every reason to\r\nconclude that at any one time the greater number of species are in a\r\nfixed condition.\r\n\r\nMIMICRY.\r\n\r\nThis principle was first made clear in an admirable paper by Mr. Bates\r\n(29. ‘Transact. Linn. Soc.’ vol. xxiii. 1862, p. 495.), who thus threw\r\na flood of light on many obscure problems. It had previously been\r\nobserved that certain butterflies in S. America belonging to quite\r\ndistinct families, resembled the Heliconidae so closely in every stripe\r\nand shade of colour, that they could not be distinguished save by an\r\nexperienced entomologist. As the Heliconidae are coloured in their\r\nusual manner, whilst the others depart from the usual colouring of the\r\ngroups to which they belong, it is clear that the latter are the\r\nimitators, and the Heliconidae the imitated. Mr. Bates further observed\r\nthat the imitating species are comparatively rare, whilst the imitated\r\nabound, and that the two sets live mingled together. From the fact of\r\nthe Heliconidae being conspicuous and beautiful insects, yet so\r\nnumerous in individuals and species, he concluded that they must be\r\nprotected from the attacks of enemies by some secretion or odour; and\r\nthis conclusion has now been amply confirmed (30. ‘Proc. Entomological\r\nSoc.’ Dec. 3, 1866, p. xlv.), especially by Mr. Belt. Hence Mr. Bates\r\ninferred that the butterflies which imitate the protected species have\r\nacquired their present marvellously deceptive appearance through\r\nvariation and natural selection, in order to be mistaken for the\r\nprotected kinds, and thus to escape being devoured. No explanation is\r\nhere attempted of the brilliant colours of the imitated, but only of\r\nthe imitating butterflies. We must account for the colours of the\r\nformer in the same general manner, as in the cases previously discussed\r\nin this chapter. Since the publication of Mr. Bates’ paper, similar and\r\nequally striking facts have been observed by Mr. Wallace in the Malayan\r\nregion, by Mr. Trimen in South Africa, and by Mr. Riley in the United\r\nStates. (31. Wallace, ‘Transact. Linn. Soc.’ vol. xxv. 1865 p. i.;\r\nalso, ‘Transact. Ent. Soc.’ vol. iv. (3rd series), 1867, p. 301.\r\nTrimen, ‘Linn. Transact.’ vol. xxvi. 1869, p. 497. Riley, ‘Third Annual\r\nReport on the Noxious Insects of Missouri,’ 1871, pp. 163-168. This\r\nlatter essay is valuable, as Mr. Riley here discusses all the\r\nobjections which have been raised against Mr. Bates’s theory.)\r\n\r\nAs some writers have felt much difficulty in understanding how the\r\nfirst steps in the process of mimicry could have been effected through\r\nnatural selection, it may be well to remark that the process probably\r\ncommenced long ago between forms not widely dissimilar in colour. In\r\nthis case even a slight variation would be beneficial, if it rendered\r\nthe one species more like the other; and afterwards the imitated\r\nspecies might be modified to an extreme degree through sexual selection\r\nor other means, and if the changes were gradual, the imitators might\r\neasily be led along the same track, until they differed to an equally\r\nextreme degree from their original condition; and they would thus\r\nultimately assume an appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the\r\nother members of the group to which they belonged. It should also be\r\nremembered that many species of Lepidoptera are liable to considerable\r\nand abrupt variations in colour. A few instances have been given in\r\nthis chapter; and many more may be found in the papers of Mr. Bates and\r\nMr. Wallace.\r\n\r\nWith several species the sexes are alike, and imitate the two sexes of\r\nanother species. But Mr. Trimen gives, in the paper already referred\r\nto, three cases in which the sexes of the imitated form differ from\r\neach other in colour, and the sexes of the imitating form differ in a\r\nlike manner. Several cases have also been recorded where the females\r\nalone imitate brilliantly-coloured and protected species, the males\r\nretaining “the normal aspect of their immediate congeners.” It is here\r\nobvious that the successive variations by which the female has been\r\nmodified have been transmitted to her alone. It is, however, probable\r\nthat some of the many successive variations would have been transmitted\r\nto, and developed in, the males had not such males been eliminated by\r\nbeing thus rendered less attractive to the females; so that only those\r\nvariations were preserved which were from the first strictly limited in\r\ntheir transmission to the female sex. We have a partial illustration of\r\nthese remarks in a statement by Mr. Belt (32. ‘The Naturalist in\r\nNicaragua,’ 1874, p. 385.); that the males of some of the Leptalides,\r\nwhich imitate protected species, still retain in a concealed manner\r\nsome of their original characters. Thus in the males “the upper half of\r\nthe lower wing is of a pure white, whilst all the rest of the wings is\r\nbarred and spotted with black, red and yellow, like the species they\r\nmimic. The females have not this white patch, and the males usually\r\nconceal it by covering it with the upper wing, so that I cannot imagine\r\nits being of any other use to them than as an attraction in courtship,\r\nwhen they exhibit it to the females, and thus gratify their deep-seated\r\npreference for the normal colour of the Order to which the Leptalides\r\nbelong.”\r\n\r\nBRIGHT COLOURS OF CATERPILLARS.\r\n\r\nWhilst reflecting on the beauty of many butterflies, it occurred to me\r\nthat some caterpillars were splendidly coloured; and as sexual\r\nselection could not possibly have here acted, it appeared rash to\r\nattribute the beauty of the mature insect to this agency, unless the\r\nbright colours of their larvae could be somehow explained. In the first\r\nplace, it may be observed that the colours of caterpillars do not stand\r\nin any close correlation with those of the mature insect. Secondly,\r\ntheir bright colours do not serve in any ordinary manner as a\r\nprotection. Mr. Bates informs me, as an instance of this, that the most\r\nconspicuous caterpillar which he ever beheld (that of a Sphinx) lived\r\non the large green leaves of a tree on the open llanos of South\r\nAmerica; it was about four inches in length, transversely banded with\r\nblack and yellow, and with its head, legs, and tail of a bright red.\r\nHence it caught the eye of any one who passed by, even at the distance\r\nof many yards, and no doubt that of every passing bird.\r\n\r\nI then applied to Mr. Wallace, who has an innate genius for solving\r\ndifficulties. After some consideration he replied: “Most caterpillars\r\nrequire protection, as may be inferred from some kinds being furnished\r\nwith spines or irritating hairs, and from many being coloured green\r\nlike the leaves on which they feed, or being curiously like the twigs\r\nof the trees on which they live.” Another instance of protection,\r\nfurnished me by Mr. J. Mansel Weale, may be added, namely, that there\r\nis a caterpillar of a moth which lives on the mimosas in South Africa,\r\nand fabricates for itself a case quite indistinguishable from the\r\nsurrounding thorns. From such considerations Mr. Wallace thought it\r\nprobable that conspicuously coloured caterpillars were protected by\r\nhaving a nauseous taste; but as their skin is extremely tender, and as\r\ntheir intestines readily protrude from a wound, a slight peck from the\r\nbeak of a bird would be as fatal to them as if they had been devoured.\r\nHence, as Mr. Wallace remarks, “distastefulness alone would be\r\ninsufficient to protect a caterpillar unless some outward sign\r\nindicated to its would-be destroyer that its prey was a disgusting\r\nmorsel.” Under these circumstances it would be highly advantageous to a\r\ncaterpillar to be instantaneously and certainly recognised as\r\nunpalatable by all birds and other animals. Thus the most gaudy colours\r\nwould be serviceable, and might have been gained by variation and the\r\nsurvival of the most easily-recognised individuals.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis appears at first sight very bold, but when it was\r\nbrought before the Entomological Society (33. ‘Proceedings,\r\nEntomological Society,’ Dec. 3, 1866, p. xlv. and March 4, 1867, p.\r\nlxxx.) it was supported by various statements; and Mr. J. Jenner Weir,\r\nwho keeps a large number of birds in an aviary, informs me that he has\r\nmade many trials, and finds no exception to the rule, that all\r\ncaterpillars of nocturnal and retiring habits with smooth skins, all of\r\na green colour, and all which imitate twigs, are greedily devoured by\r\nhis birds. The hairy and spinose kinds are invariably rejected, as were\r\nfour conspicuously-coloured species. When the birds rejected a\r\ncaterpillar, they plainly shewed, by shaking their heads, and cleansing\r\ntheir beaks, that they were disgusted by the taste. (34. See Mr. J.\r\nJenner Weir’s paper on Insects and Insectivorous Birds, in ‘Transact.\r\nEnt. Soc.’ 1869, p. 21; also Mr. Butler’s paper, ibid. p. 27. Mr. Riley\r\nhas given analogous facts in the ‘Third Annual Report on the Noxious\r\nInsects of Missouri,’ 1871, p. 148. Some opposed cases are, however,\r\ngiven by Dr. Wallace and M. H. d’Orville; see ‘Zoological Record,’\r\n1869, p. 349.) Three conspicuous kinds of caterpillars and moths were\r\nalso given to some lizards and frogs, by Mr. A. Butler, and were\r\nrejected, though other kinds were eagerly eaten. Thus the probability\r\nof Mr. Wallace’s view is confirmed, namely, that certain caterpillars\r\nhave been made conspicuous for their own good, so as to be easily\r\nrecognised by their enemies, on nearly the same principle that poisons\r\nare sold in coloured bottles by druggists for the good of man. We\r\ncannot, however, at present thus explain the elegant diversity in the\r\ncolours of many caterpillars; but any species which had at some former\r\nperiod acquired a dull, mottled, or striped appearance, either in\r\nimitation of surrounding objects, or from the direct action of climate,\r\netc., almost certainly would not become uniform in colour, when its\r\ntints were rendered intense and bright; for in order to make a\r\ncaterpillar merely conspicuous, there would be no selection in any\r\ndefinite direction.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS ON INSECTS.\r\n\r\nLooking back to the several Orders, we see that the sexes often differ\r\nin various characters, the meaning of which is not in the least\r\nunderstood. The sexes, also, often differ in their organs of sense and\r\nmeans of locomotion, so that the males may quickly discover and reach\r\nthe females. They differ still oftener in the males possessing\r\ndiversified contrivances for retaining the females when found. We are,\r\nhowever, here concerned only in a secondary degree with sexual\r\ndifferences of these kinds.\r\n\r\nIn almost all the Orders, the males of some species, even of weak and\r\ndelicate kinds, are known to be highly pugnacious; and some few are\r\nfurnished with special weapons for fighting with their rivals. But the\r\nlaw of battle does not prevail nearly so widely with insects as with\r\nthe higher animals. Hence it probably arises, that it is in only a few\r\ncases that the males have been rendered larger and stronger than the\r\nfemales. On the contrary, they are usually smaller, so that they may be\r\ndeveloped within a shorter time, to be ready in large numbers for the\r\nemergence of the females.\r\n\r\nIn two families of the Homoptera and in three of the Orthoptera, the\r\nmales alone possess sound-producing organs in an efficient state. These\r\nare used incessantly during the breeding-season, not only for calling\r\nthe females, but apparently for charming or exciting them in rivalry\r\nwith other males. No one who admits the agency of selection of any\r\nkind, will, after reading the above discussion, dispute that these\r\nmusical instruments have been acquired through sexual selection. In\r\nfour other Orders the members of one sex, or more commonly of both\r\nsexes, are provided with organs for producing various sounds, which\r\napparently serve merely as call-notes. When both sexes are thus\r\nprovided, the individuals which were able to make the loudest or most\r\ncontinuous noise would gain partners before those which were less\r\nnoisy, so that their organs have probably been gained through sexual\r\nselection. It is instructive to reflect on the wonderful diversity of\r\nthe means for producing sound, possessed by the males alone, or by both\r\nsexes, in no less than six Orders. We thus learn how effectual sexual\r\nselection has been in leading to modifications which sometimes, as with\r\nthe Homoptera, relate to important parts of the organisation.\r\n\r\nFrom the reasons assigned in the last chapter, it is probable that the\r\ngreat horns possessed by the males of many Lamellicorn, and some other\r\nbeetles, have been acquired as ornaments. From the small size of\r\ninsects, we are apt to undervalue their appearance. If we could imagine\r\na male Chalcosoma (Fig. 16), with its polished bronzed coat of mail,\r\nand its vast complex horns, magnified to the size of a horse, or even\r\nof a dog, it would be one of the most imposing animals in the world.\r\n\r\nThe colouring of insects is a complex and obscure subject. When the\r\nmale differs slightly from the female, and neither are\r\nbrilliantly-coloured, it is probable that the sexes have varied in a\r\nslightly different manner, and that the variations have been\r\ntransmitted by each sex to the same without any benefit or evil thus\r\naccruing. When the male is brilliantly-coloured and differs\r\nconspicuously from the female, as with some dragon-flies and many\r\nbutterflies, it is probable that he owes his colours to sexual\r\nselection; whilst the female has retained a primordial or very ancient\r\ntype of colouring, slightly modified by the agencies before explained.\r\nBut in some cases the female has apparently been made obscure by\r\nvariations transmitted to her alone, as a means of direct protection;\r\nand it is almost certain that she has sometimes been made brilliant, so\r\nas to imitate other protected species inhabiting the same district.\r\nWhen the sexes resemble each other and both are obscurely coloured,\r\nthere is no doubt that they have been in a multitude of cases so\r\ncoloured for the sake of protection. So it is in some instances when\r\nboth are brightly-coloured, for they thus imitate protected species, or\r\nresemble surrounding objects such as flowers; or they give notice to\r\ntheir enemies that they are unpalatable. In other cases in which the\r\nsexes resemble each other and are both brilliant, especially when the\r\ncolours are arranged for display, we may conclude that they have been\r\ngained by the male sex as an attraction, and have been transferred to\r\nthe female. We are more especially led to this conclusion whenever the\r\nsame type of coloration prevails throughout a whole group, and we find\r\nthat the males of some species differ widely in colour from the\r\nfemales, whilst others differ slightly or not at all with intermediate\r\ngradations connecting these extreme states.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as bright colours have often been partially\r\ntransferred from the males to the females, so it has been with the\r\nextraordinary horns of many Lamellicorn and some other beetles. So\r\nagain, the sound-producing organs proper to the males of the Homoptera\r\nand Orthoptera have generally been transferred in a rudimentary, or\r\neven in a nearly perfect condition, to the females; yet not\r\nsufficiently perfect to be of any use. It is also an interesting fact,\r\nas bearing on sexual selection, that the stridulating organs of certain\r\nmale Orthoptera are not fully developed until the last moult; and that\r\nthe colours of certain male dragon-flies are not fully developed until\r\nsome little time after their emergence from the pupal state, and when\r\nthey are ready to breed.\r\n\r\nSexual selection implies that the more attractive individuals are\r\npreferred by the opposite sex; and as with insects, when the sexes\r\ndiffer, it is the male which, with some rare exceptions, is the more\r\nornamented, and departs more from the type to which the species\r\nbelongs;—and as it is the male which searches eagerly for the female,\r\nwe must suppose that the females habitually or occasionally prefer the\r\nmore beautiful males, and that these have thus acquired their beauty.\r\nThat the females in most or all the Orders would have the power of\r\nrejecting any particular male, is probable from the many singular\r\ncontrivances possessed by the males, such as great jaws, adhesive\r\ncushions, spines, elongated legs, etc., for seizing the female; for\r\nthese contrivances show that there is some difficulty in the act, so\r\nthat her concurrence would seem necessary. Judging from what we know of\r\nthe perceptive powers and affections of various insects, there is no\r\nantecedent improbability in sexual selection having come largely into\r\nplay; but we have as yet no direct evidence on this head, and some\r\nfacts are opposed to the belief. Nevertheless, when we see many males\r\npursuing the same female, we can hardly believe that the pairing is\r\nleft to blind chance—that the female exerts no choice, and is not\r\ninfluenced by the gorgeous colours or other ornaments with which the\r\nmale is decorated.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that the females of the Homoptera and Orthoptera appreciate\r\nthe musical tones of their male partners, and that the various\r\ninstruments have been perfected through sexual selection, there is\r\nlittle improbability in the females of other insects appreciating\r\nbeauty in form or colour, and consequently in such characters having\r\nbeen thus gained by the males. But from the circumstance of colour\r\nbeing so variable, and from its having been so often modified for the\r\nsake of protection, it is difficult to decide in how large a proportion\r\nof cases sexual selection has played a part. This is more especially\r\ndifficult in those Orders, such as Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, and\r\nColeoptera, in which the two sexes rarely differ much in colour; for we\r\nare then left to mere analogy. With the Coleoptera, however, as before\r\nremarked, it is in the great Lamellicorn group, placed by some authors\r\nat the head of the Order, and in which we sometimes see a mutual\r\nattachment between the sexes, that we find the males of some species\r\npossessing weapons for sexual strife, others furnished with wonderful\r\nhorns, many with stridulating organs, and others ornamented with\r\nsplendid metallic tints. Hence it seems probable that all these\r\ncharacters have been gained through the same means, namely sexual\r\nselection. With butterflies we have the best evidence, as the males\r\nsometimes take pains to display their beautiful colours; and we cannot\r\nbelieve that they would act thus, unless the display was of use to them\r\nin their courtship.\r\n\r\nWhen we treat of Birds, we shall see that they present in their\r\nsecondary sexual characters the closest analogy with insects. Thus,\r\nmany male birds are highly pugnacious, and some are furnished with\r\nspecial weapons for fighting with their rivals. They possess organs\r\nwhich are used during the breeding-season for producing vocal and\r\ninstrumental music. They are frequently ornamented with combs, horns,\r\nwattles and plumes of the most diversified kinds, and are decorated\r\nwith beautiful colours, all evidently for the sake of display. We shall\r\nfind that, as with insects, both sexes in certain groups are equally\r\nbeautiful, and are equally provided with ornaments which are usually\r\nconfined to the male sex. In other groups both sexes are equally\r\nplain-coloured and unornamented. Lastly, in some few anomalous cases,\r\nthe females are more beautiful than the males. We shall often find, in\r\nthe same group of birds, every gradation from no difference between the\r\nsexes, to an extreme difference. We shall see that female birds, like\r\nfemale insects, often possess more or less plain traces or rudiments of\r\ncharacters which properly belong to the males and are of use only to\r\nthem. The analogy, indeed, in all these respects between birds and\r\ninsects is curiously close. Whatever explanation applies to the one\r\nclass probably applies to the other; and this explanation, as we shall\r\nhereafter attempt to shew in further detail, is sexual selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF FISHES, AMPHIBIANS, AND REPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHES: Courtship and battles of the males—Larger size of the\r\nfemales—Males, bright colours and ornamental appendages; other strange\r\ncharacters—Colours and appendages acquired by the males during the\r\nbreeding-season alone—Fishes with both sexes brilliantly\r\ncoloured—Protective colours—The less conspicuous colours of the female\r\ncannot be accounted for on the principle of protection—Male fishes\r\nbuilding nests, and taking charge of the ova and young.\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIANS: Differences in structure and colour between the sexes—Vocal\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nREPTILES: Chelonians—Crocodiles—Snakes, colours in some cases\r\nprotective—Lizards, battles of—Ornamental appendages—Strange\r\ndifferences in structure between the sexes—Colours—Sexual differences\r\nalmost as great as with birds.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the great sub-kingdom of the Vertebrata, and\r\nwill commence with the lowest class, that of fishes. The males of\r\nPlagiostomous fishes (sharks, rays) and of Chimaeroid fishes are\r\nprovided with claspers which serve to retain the female, like the\r\nvarious structures possessed by many of the lower animals. Besides the\r\nclaspers, the males of many rays have clusters of strong sharp spines\r\non their heads, and several rows along “the upper outer surface of\r\ntheir pectoral fins.” These are present in the males of some species,\r\nwhich have other parts of their bodies smooth. They are only\r\ntemporarily developed during the breeding-season; and Dr. Gunther\r\nsuspects that they are brought into action as prehensile organs by the\r\ndoubling inwards and downwards of the two sides of the body. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that the females and not the males of some species, as\r\nof Raia clavata, have their backs studded with large hook-formed\r\nspines. (1. Yarrell’s ‘Hist. of British Fishes,’ vol. ii. 1836, pp 417,\r\n425, 436. Dr. Gunther informs me that the spines in R. clavata are\r\npeculiar to the female.)\r\n\r\nThe males alone of the capelin (Mallotus villosus, one of Salmonidae),\r\nare provided with a ridge of closely-set, brush-like scales, by the aid\r\nof which two males, one on each side, hold the female, whilst she runs\r\nwith great swiftness on the sandy beach, and there deposits her spawn.\r\n(2. The ‘American Naturalist,’ April 1871, p. 119.) The widely distinct\r\nMonacanthus scopas presents a somewhat analogous structure. The male,\r\nas Dr. Gunther informs me, has a cluster of stiff, straight spines,\r\nlike those of a comb, on the sides of the tail; and these in a specimen\r\nsix inches long were nearly one and a half inches in length; the female\r\nhas in the same place a cluster of bristles, which may be compared with\r\nthose of a tooth-brush. In another species, M. peronii, the male has a\r\nbrush like that possessed by the female of the last species, whilst the\r\nsides of the tail in the female are smooth. In some other species of\r\nthe same genus the tail can be perceived to be a little roughened in\r\nthe male and perfectly smooth in the female; and lastly in others, both\r\nsexes have smooth sides.\r\n\r\nThe males of many fish fight for the possession of the females. Thus\r\nthe male stickleback (Gasterosteus leiurus) has been described as “mad\r\nwith delight,” when the female comes out of her hiding-place and\r\nsurveys the nest which he has made for her. “He darts round her in\r\nevery direction, then to his accumulated materials for the nest, then\r\nback again in an instant; and as she does not advance he endeavours to\r\npush her with his snout, and then tries to pull her by the tail and\r\nside-spine to the nest.” (3. See Mr. R. Warington’s interesting\r\narticles in ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History,’ October 1852, and\r\nNovember 1855.) The males are said to be polygamists (4. Noel\r\nHumphreys, ‘River Gardens,’ 1857.); they are extraordinarily bold and\r\npugnacious, whilst “the females are quite pacific.” Their battles are\r\nat times desperate; “for these puny combatants fasten tight on each\r\nother for several seconds, tumbling over and over again until their\r\nstrength appears completely exhausted.” With the rough-tailed\r\nstickleback (G. trachurus) the males whilst fighting swim round and\r\nround each other, biting and endeavouring to pierce each other with\r\ntheir raised lateral spines. The same writer adds (5. Loudon’s\r\n‘Magazine of Natural History,’ vol. iii. 1830, p. 331.), “the bite of\r\nthese little furies is very severe. They also use their lateral spines\r\nwith such fatal effect, that I have seen one during a battle absolutely\r\nrip his opponent quite open, so that he sank to the bottom and died.”\r\nWhen a fish is conquered, “his gallant bearing forsakes him; his gay\r\ncolours fade away; and he hides his disgrace among his peaceable\r\ncompanions, but is for some time the constant object of his conqueror’s\r\npersecution.”\r\n\r\nThe male salmon is as pugnacious as the little stickleback; and so is\r\nthe male trout, as I hear from Dr. Gunther. Mr. Shaw saw a violent\r\ncontest between two male salmon which lasted the whole day; and Mr. R.\r\nBuist, Superintendent of Fisheries, informs me that he has often\r\nwatched from the bridge at Perth the males driving away their rivals,\r\nwhilst the females were spawning. The males “are constantly fighting\r\nand tearing each other on the spawning-beds, and many so injure each\r\nother as to cause the death of numbers, many being seen swimming near\r\nthe banks of the river in a state of exhaustion, and apparently in a\r\ndying state.” (6. The ‘Field,’ June 29, 1867. For Mr. Shaw’s Statement,\r\nsee ‘Edinburgh Review,’ 1843. Another experienced observer (Scrope’s\r\n‘Days of Salmon Fishing,’ p. 60) remarks that like the stag, the male\r\nwould, if he could, keep all other males away.) Mr. Buist informs me,\r\nthat in June 1868, the keeper of the Stormontfield breeding-ponds\r\nvisited the northern Tyne and found about 300 dead salmon, all of which\r\nwith one exception were males; and he was convinced that they had lost\r\ntheir lives by fighting.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 27. Head of male common salmon (Salmo salar) during the\r\nbreeding-season. [This drawing, as well as all the others in the\r\npresent chapter, have been executed by the well-known artist, Mr. G.\r\nFord, from specimens in the British Museum, under the kind\r\nsuperintendence of Dr. Gunther.]\r\n\r\nFig. 28. Head of female salmon.]\r\n\r\nThe most curious point about the male salmon is that during the\r\nbreeding-season, besides a slight change in colour, “the lower jaw\r\nelongates, and a cartilaginous projection turns upwards from the point,\r\nwhich, when the jaws are closed, occupies a deep cavity between the\r\nintermaxillary bones of the upper jaw.” (7. Yarrell, ‘History of\r\nBritish Fishes,’ vol. ii. 1836, p. 10.) (Figs. 27 and 28.) In our\r\nsalmon this change of structure lasts only during the breeding-season;\r\nbut in the Salmo lycaodon of N.W. America the change, as Mr. J.K. Lord\r\n(8. ‘The Naturalist in Vancouver’s Island,’ vol. i. 1866, p. 54.)\r\nbelieves, is permanent, and best marked in the older males which have\r\npreviously ascended the rivers. In these old males the jaw becomes\r\ndeveloped into an immense hook-like projection, and the teeth grow into\r\nregular fangs, often more than half an inch in length. With the\r\nEuropean salmon, according to Mr. Lloyd (9. ‘Scandinavian Adventures,’\r\nvol. i. 1854, pp. 100, 104.), the temporary hook-like structure serves\r\nto strengthen and protect the jaws, when one male charges another with\r\nwonderful violence; but the greatly developed teeth of the male\r\nAmerican salmon may be compared with the tusks of many male mammals,\r\nand they indicate an offensive rather than a protective purpose.\r\n\r\nThe salmon is not the only fish in which the teeth differ in the two\r\nsexes; as this is the case with many rays. In the thornback (Raia\r\nclavata) the adult male has sharp, pointed teeth, directed backwards,\r\nwhilst those of the female are broad and flat, and form a pavement; so\r\nthat these teeth differ in the two sexes of the same species more than\r\nis usual in distinct genera of the same family. The teeth of the male\r\nbecome sharp only when he is adult: whilst young they are broad and\r\nflat like those of the female. As so frequently occurs with secondary\r\nsexual characters, both sexes of some species of rays (for instance R.\r\nbatis), when adult, possess sharp pointed teeth; and here a character,\r\nproper to and primarily gained by the male, appears to have been\r\ntransmitted to the offspring of both sexes. The teeth are likewise\r\npointed in both sexes of R. maculata, but only when quite adult; the\r\nmales acquiring them at an earlier age than the females. We shall\r\nhereafter meet with analogous cases in certain birds, in which the male\r\nacquires the plumage common to both sexes when adult, at a somewhat\r\nearlier age than does the female. With other species of rays the males\r\neven when old never possess sharp teeth, and consequently the adults of\r\nboth sexes are provided with broad, flat teeth like those of the young,\r\nand like those of the mature females of the above-mentioned species.\r\n(10. See Yarrell’s account of the rays in his ‘History of British\r\nFishes,’ vol. ii. 1836, p. 416, with an excellent figure, and pp. 422,\r\n432.) As the rays are bold, strong and voracious fish, we may suspect\r\nthat the males require their sharp teeth for fighting with their\r\nrivals; but as they possess many parts modified and adapted for the\r\nprehension of the female, it is possible that their teeth may be used\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn regard to size, M. Carbonnier (11. As quoted in ‘The Farmer,’ 1868,\r\np. 369.) maintains that the female of almost all fishes is larger than\r\nthe male; and Dr. Gunther does not know of a single instance in which\r\nthe male is actually larger than the female. With some Cyprinodonts the\r\nmale is not even half as large. As in many kinds of fishes the males\r\nhabitually fight together, it is surprising that they have not\r\ngenerally become larger and stronger than the females through the\r\neffects of sexual selection. The males suffer from their small size,\r\nfor according to M. Carbonnier, they are liable to be devoured by the\r\nfemales of their own species when carnivorous, and no doubt by other\r\nspecies. Increased size must be in some manner of more importance to\r\nthe females, than strength and size are to the males for fighting with\r\nother males; and this perhaps is to allow of the production of a vast\r\nnumber of ova.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 29. Callionymus lyra. Upper figure, male; lower figure, female.\r\nN.B. The lower figure is more reduced than the upper.]\r\n\r\nIn many species the male alone is ornamented with bright colours; or\r\nthese are much brighter in the male than the female. The male, also, is\r\nsometimes provided with appendages which appear to be of no more use to\r\nhim for the ordinary purposes of life, than are the tail feathers to\r\nthe peacock. I am indebted for most of the following facts to the\r\nkindness of Dr. Gunther. There is reason to suspect that many tropical\r\nfishes differ sexually in colour and structure; and there are some\r\nstriking cases with our British fishes. The male Callionymus lyra has\r\nbeen called the gemmeous dragonet “from its brilliant gem-like\r\ncolours.” When fresh caught from the sea the body is yellow of various\r\nshades, striped and spotted with vivid blue on the head; the dorsal\r\nfins are pale brown with dark longitudinal bands; the ventral, caudal,\r\nand anal fins being bluish-black. The female, or sordid dragonet, was\r\nconsidered by Linnaeus, and by many subsequent naturalists, as a\r\ndistinct species; it is of a dingy reddish-brown, with the dorsal fin\r\nbrown and the other fins white. The sexes differ also in the\r\nproportional size of the head and mouth, and in the position of the\r\neyes (12. I have drawn up this description from Yarrell’s ‘British\r\nFishes,’ vol. i. 1836, pp. 261 and 266.); but the most striking\r\ndifference is the extraordinary elongation in the male (Fig. 29) of the\r\ndorsal fin. Mr. W. Saville Kent remarks that this “singular appendage\r\nappears from my observations of the species in confinement, to be\r\nsubservient to the same end as the wattles, crests, and other abnormal\r\nadjuncts of the male in gallinaceous birds, for the purpose of\r\nfascinating their mates.” (13. ‘Nature,’ July 1873, p. 264.) The young\r\nmales resemble the adult females in structure and colour. Throughout\r\nthe genus Callionymus (14. ‘Catalogue of Acanth. Fishes in the British\r\nMuseum,’ by Dr. Gunther, 1861, pp. 138-151.), the male is generally\r\nmuch more brightly spotted than the female, and in several species, not\r\nonly the dorsal, but the anal fin is much elongated in the males.\r\n\r\nThe male of the Cottus scorpius, or sea-scorpion, is slenderer and\r\nsmaller than the female. There is also a great difference in colour\r\nbetween them. It is difficult, as Mr. Lloyd (15. ‘Game Birds of\r\nSweden,’ etc., 1867, p. 466.) remarks, “for any one, who has not seen\r\nthis fish during the spawning-season, when its hues are brightest, to\r\nconceive the admixture of brilliant colours with which it, in other\r\nrespects so ill-favoured, is at that time adorned.” Both sexes of the\r\nLabrus mixtus, although very different in colour, are beautiful; the\r\nmale being orange with bright blue stripes, and the female bright red\r\nwith some black spots on the back.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 30. Xiphophorus Hellerii. Upper figure, male; lower figure,\r\nfemale.]\r\n\r\nIn the very distinct family of the Cyprinodontidae—inhabitants of the\r\nfresh waters of foreign lands—the sexes sometimes differ much in\r\nvarious characters. In the male of the Mollienesia petenensis (16. With\r\nrespect to this and the following species I am indebted to Dr. Gunther\r\nfor information: see also his paper on the ‘Fishes of Central America,’\r\nin ‘Transact. Zoological Soc.’ vol. vi. 1868, p. 485.), the dorsal fin\r\nis greatly developed and is marked with a row of large, round,\r\nocellated, bright-coloured spots; whilst the same fin in the female is\r\nsmaller, of a different shape, and marked only with irregularly curved\r\nbrown spots. In the male the basal margin of the anal fin is also a\r\nlittle produced and dark coloured. In the male of an allied form, the\r\nXiphophorus Hellerii (Fig. 30), the inferior margin of the caudal fin\r\nis developed into a long filament, which, as I hear from Dr. Gunther,\r\nis striped with bright colours. This filament does not contain any\r\nmuscles, and apparently cannot be of any direct use to the fish. As in\r\nthe case of the Callionymus, the males whilst young resemble the adult\r\nfemales in colour and structure. Sexual differences such as these may\r\nbe strictly compared with those which are so frequent with gallinaceous\r\nbirds. (17. Dr. Gunther makes this remark; ‘Catalogue of Fishes in the\r\nBritish Museum,’ vol. iii. 1861, p. 141.)\r\n\r\n[Fig.31. Plecostomus barbatus. Upper figure, head of male; lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nIn a siluroid fish, inhabiting the fresh waters of South America, the\r\nPlecostomus barbatus (18. See Dr. Gunther on this genus, in\r\n‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1868, p. 232.) (Fig. 31), the\r\nmale has its mouth and inter-operculum fringed with a beard of stiff\r\nhairs, of which the female shows hardly a trace. These hairs are of the\r\nnature of scales. In another species of the same genus, soft flexible\r\ntentacles project from the front part of the head of the male, which\r\nare absent in the female. These tentacles are prolongations of the true\r\nskin, and therefore are not homologous with the stiff hairs of the\r\nformer species; but it can hardly be doubted that both serve the same\r\npurpose. What this purpose may be, it is difficult to conjecture;\r\nornament does not here seem probable, but we can hardly suppose that\r\nstiff hairs and flexible filaments can be useful in any ordinary way to\r\nthe males alone. In that strange monster, the Chimaera monstrosa, the\r\nmale has a hook-shaped bone on the top of the head, directed forwards,\r\nwith its end rounded and covered with sharp spines; in the female “this\r\ncrown is altogether absent,” but what its use may be to the male is\r\nutterly unknown. (19. F. Buckland, in ‘Land and Water,’ July 1868, p.\r\n377, with a figure. Many other cases could be added of structures\r\npeculiar to the male, of which the uses are not known.)\r\n\r\nThe structures as yet referred to are permanent in the male after he\r\nhas arrived at maturity; but with some Blennies, and in another allied\r\ngenus (20. Dr. Gunther, ‘Catalogue of Fishes,’ vol. iii. pp. 221 and\r\n240.), a crest is developed on the head of the male only during the\r\nbreeding-season, and the body at the same time becomes more\r\nbrightly-coloured. There can be little doubt that this crest serves as\r\na temporary sexual ornament, for the female does not exhibit a trace of\r\nit. In other species of the same genus both sexes possess a crest, and\r\nin at least one species neither sex is thus provided. In many of the\r\nChromidae, for instance in Geophagus and especially in Cichla, the\r\nmales, as I hear from Professor Agassiz (21. See also ‘A Journey in\r\nBrazil,’ by Prof. and Mrs. Agassiz, 1868, p. 220.), have a conspicuous\r\nprotuberance on the forehead, which is wholly wanting in the females\r\nand in the young males. Professor Agassiz adds, “I have often observed\r\nthese fishes at the time of spawning when the protuberance is largest,\r\nand at other seasons when it is totally wanting, and the two sexes shew\r\nno difference whatever in the outline of the profile of the head. I\r\nnever could ascertain that it subserves any special function, and the\r\nIndians on the Amazon know nothing about its use.” These protuberances\r\nresemble, in their periodical appearance, the fleshy carbuncles on the\r\nheads of certain birds; but whether they serve as ornaments must remain\r\nat present doubtful.\r\n\r\nI hear from Professor Agassiz and Dr. Gunther, that the males of those\r\nfishes, which differ permanently in colour from the females, often\r\nbecome more brilliant during the breeding-season. This is likewise the\r\ncase with a multitude of fishes, the sexes of which are identical in\r\ncolour at all other seasons of the year. The tench, roach, and perch\r\nmay be given as instances. The male salmon at this season is “marked on\r\nthe cheeks with orange-coloured stripes, which give it the appearance\r\nof a Labrus, and the body partakes of a golden orange tinge. The\r\nfemales are dark in colour, and are commonly called black-fish.” (22.\r\nYarrell, ‘History of British Fishes,’ vol. ii. 1836, pp. 10, 12, 35.)\r\nAn analogous and even greater change takes place with the Salmo eriox\r\nor bull trout; the males of the char (S. umbla) are likewise at this\r\nseason rather brighter in colour than the females. (23. W. Thompson, in\r\n‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History,’ vol. vi. 1841, p. 440.) The\r\ncolours of the pike (Esox reticulatus) of the United States, especially\r\nof the male, become, during the breeding-season, exceedingly intense,\r\nbrilliant, and iridescent. (24. ‘The American Agriculturalist,’ 1868,\r\np. 100.) Another striking instance out of many is afforded by the male\r\nstickleback (Gasterosteus leiurus), which is described by Mr. Warington\r\n(25. ‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ Oct. 1852.), as being then\r\n“beautiful beyond description.” The back and eyes of the female are\r\nsimply brown, and the belly white. The eyes of the male, on the other\r\nhand, are “of the most splendid green, having a metallic lustre like\r\nthe green feathers of some humming-birds. The throat and belly are of a\r\nbright crimson, the back of an ashy-green, and the whole fish appears\r\nas though it were somewhat translucent and glowed with an internal\r\nincandescence.” After the breeding season these colours all change, the\r\nthroat and belly become of a paler red, the back more green, and the\r\nglowing tints subside.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the courtship of fishes, other cases have been observed\r\nsince the first edition of this book appeared, besides that already\r\ngiven of the stickleback. Mr. W.S. Kent says that the male of the\r\nLabrus mixtus, which, as we have seen, differs in colour from the\r\nfemale, makes “a deep hollow in the sand of the tank, and then\r\nendeavours in the most persuasive manner to induce a female of the same\r\nspecies to share it with him, swimming backwards and forwards between\r\nher and the completed nest, and plainly exhibiting the greatest anxiety\r\nfor her to follow.” The males of Cantharus lineatus become, during the\r\nbreeding-season, of deep leaden-black; they then retire from the shoal,\r\nand excavate a hollow as a nest. “Each male now mounts vigilant guard\r\nover his respective hollow, and vigorously attacks and drives away any\r\nother fish of the same sex. Towards his companions of the opposite sex\r\nhis conduct is far different; many of the latter are now distended with\r\nspawn, and these he endeavours by all the means in his power to lure\r\nsingly to his prepared hollow, and there to deposit the myriad ova with\r\nwhich they are laden, which he then protects and guards with the\r\ngreatest care.” (26. ‘Nature,’ May 1873, p. 25.)\r\n\r\nA more striking case of courtship, as well as of display, by the males\r\nof a Chinese Macropus has been given by M. Carbonnier, who carefully\r\nobserved these fishes under confinement. (27. ‘Bulletin de la Societé\r\nd’Acclimat.’ Paris, July 1869, and Jan. 1870.) The males are most\r\nbeautifully coloured, more so than the females. During the\r\nbreeding-season they contend for the possession of the females; and, in\r\nthe act of courtship, expand their fins, which are spotted and\r\nornamented with brightly coloured rays, in the same manner, according\r\nto M. Carbonnier, as the peacock. They then also bound about the\r\nfemales with much vivacity, and appear by “l’étalage de leurs vives\r\ncouleurs chercher a attirer l’attention des femelles, lesquelles ne\r\nparaissaient indifférentes a ce manège, elles nageaient avec une molle\r\nlenteur vers les males et semblaient se complaire dans leur voisinage.”\r\nAfter the male has won his bride, he makes a little disc of froth by\r\nblowing air and mucus out of his mouth. He then collects the fertilised\r\nova, dropped by the female, in his mouth; and this caused M. Carbonnier\r\nmuch alarm, as he thought that they were going to be devoured. But the\r\nmale soon deposits them in the disc of froth, afterwards guarding them,\r\nrepairing the froth, and taking care of the young when hatched. I\r\nmention these particulars because, as we shall presently see, there are\r\nfishes, the males of which hatch their eggs in their mouths; and those\r\nwho do not believe in the principle of gradual evolution might ask how\r\ncould such a habit have originated; but the difficulty is much\r\ndiminished when we know that there are fishes which thus collect and\r\ncarry the eggs; for if delayed by any cause in depositing them, the\r\nhabit of hatching them in their mouths might have been acquired.\r\n\r\nTo return to our more immediate subject. The case stands thus: female\r\nfishes, as far as I can learn, never willingly spawn except in the\r\npresence of the males; and the males never fertilise the ova except in\r\nthe presence of the females. The males fight for the possession of the\r\nfemales. In many species, the males whilst young resemble the females\r\nin colour; but when adult become much more brilliant, and retain their\r\ncolours throughout life. In other species the males become brighter\r\nthan the females and otherwise more highly ornamented, only during the\r\nseason of love. The males sedulously court the females, and in one\r\ncase, as we have seen, take pains in displaying their beauty before\r\nthem. Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during\r\ntheir courtship? And this would be the case, unless the females exert\r\nsome choice and select those males which please or excite them most. If\r\nthe female exerts such choice, all the above facts on the ornamentation\r\nof the males become at once intelligible by the aid of sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire whether this view of the bright colours of\r\ncertain male fishes having been acquired through sexual selection can,\r\nthrough the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes,\r\nbe extended to those groups in which the males and females are\r\nbrilliant in the same, or nearly the same degree and manner. In such a\r\ngenus as Labrus, which includes some of the most splendid fishes in the\r\nworld—for instance, the Peacock Labrus (L. pavo), described (28. Bory\r\nSaint Vincent, in ‘Dict. Class. d’Hist. Nat.’ tom. ix. 1826, p. 151.),\r\nwith pardonable exaggeration, as formed of polished scales of gold,\r\nencrusting lapis-lazuli, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and amethysts—we\r\nmay, with much probability, accept this belief; for we have seen that\r\nthe sexes in at least one species of the genus differ greatly in\r\ncolour. With some fishes, as with many of the lowest animals, splendid\r\ncolours may be the direct result of the nature of their tissues and of\r\nthe surrounding conditions, without the aid of selection of any kind.\r\nThe gold-fish (Cyprinus auratus), judging from the analogy of the\r\ngolden variety of the common carp, is perhaps a case in point, as it\r\nmay owe its splendid colours to a single abrupt variation, due to the\r\nconditions to which this fish has been subjected under confinement. It\r\nis, however, more probable that these colours have been intensified\r\nthrough artificial selection, as this species has been carefully bred\r\nin China from a remote period. (29. Owing to some remarks on this\r\nsubject, made in my work ‘On the Variation of Animals under\r\nDomestication,’ Mr. W.F. Mayers (‘Chinese Notes and Queries,’ Aug.\r\n1868, p. 123) has searched the ancient Chinese encyclopedias. He finds\r\nthat gold-fish were first reared in confinement during the Sung\r\nDynasty, which commenced A.D. 960. In the year 1129 these fishes\r\nabounded. In another place it is said that since the year 1548 there\r\nhas been “produced at Hangchow a variety called the fire-fish, from its\r\nintensely red colour. It is universally admired, and there is not a\r\nhousehold where it is not cultivated, IN RIVALRY AS TO ITS COLOUR, and\r\nas a source of profit.”) Under natural conditions it does not seem\r\nprobable that beings so highly organised as fishes, and which live\r\nunder such complex relations, should become brilliantly coloured\r\nwithout suffering some evil or receiving some benefit from so great a\r\nchange, and consequently without the intervention of natural selection.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are we to conclude in regard to the many fishes, both sexes\r\nof which are splendidly coloured? Mr. Wallace (30. ‘Westminster\r\nReview,’ July 1867, p. 7.) believes that the species which frequent\r\nreefs, where corals and other brightly-coloured organisms abound, are\r\nbrightly coloured in order to escape detection by their enemies; but\r\naccording to my recollection they were thus rendered highly\r\nconspicuous. In the fresh-waters of the tropics there are no\r\nbrilliantly-coloured corals or other organisms for the fishes to\r\nresemble; yet many species in the Amazons are beautifully coloured, and\r\nmany of the carnivorous Cyprinidae in India are ornamented with “bright\r\nlongitudinal lines of various tints.” (31. ‘Indian Cyprinidae,’ by Mr.\r\nM’Clelland, ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xix. part ii. 1839, p. 230.) Mr.\r\nM’Clelland, in describing these fishes, goes so far as to suppose that\r\n“the peculiar brilliancy of their colours” serves as “a better mark for\r\nking-fishers, terns, and other birds which are destined to keep the\r\nnumber of these fishes in check”; but at the present day few\r\nnaturalists will admit that any animal has been made conspicuous as an\r\naid to its own destruction. It is possible that certain fishes may have\r\nbeen rendered conspicuous in order to warn birds and beasts of prey\r\nthat they were unpalatable, as explained when treating of caterpillars;\r\nbut it is not, I believe, known that any fish, at least any fresh-water\r\nfish, is rejected from being distasteful to fish-devouring animals. On\r\nthe whole, the most probable view in regard to the fishes, of which\r\nboth sexes are brilliantly coloured, is that their colours were\r\nacquired by the males as a sexual ornament, and were transferred\r\nequally, or nearly so, to the other sex.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider whether, when the male differs in a marked\r\nmanner from the female in colour or in other ornaments, he alone has\r\nbeen modified, the variations being inherited by his male offspring\r\nalone; or whether the female has been specially modified and rendered\r\ninconspicuous for the sake of protection, such modifications being\r\ninherited only by the females. It is impossible to doubt that colour\r\nhas been gained by many fishes as a protection: no one can examine the\r\nspeckled upper surface of a flounder, and overlook its resemblance to\r\nthe sandy bed of the sea on which it lives. Certain fishes, moreover,\r\ncan through the action of the nervous system change their colours in\r\nadaptation to surrounding objects, and that within a short time. (32.\r\nG. Pouchet, ‘L’Institut.’ Nov. 1, 1871, p. 134.) One of the most\r\nstriking instances ever recorded of an animal being protected by its\r\ncolour (as far as it can be judged of in preserved specimens), as well\r\nas by its form, is that given by Dr. Gunther (33. ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’\r\n1865, p. 327, pl. xiv. and xv.) of a pipe-fish, which, with its reddish\r\nstreaming filaments, is hardly distinguishable from the sea-weed to\r\nwhich it clings with its prehensile tail. But the question now under\r\nconsideration is whether the females alone have been modified for this\r\nobject. We can see that one sex will not be modified through natural\r\nselection for the sake of protection more than the other, supposing\r\nboth to vary, unless one sex is exposed for a longer period to danger,\r\nor has less power of escaping from such danger than the other; and it\r\ndoes not appear that with fishes the sexes differ in these respects. As\r\nfar as there is any difference, the males, from being generally smaller\r\nand from wandering more about, are exposed to greater danger than the\r\nfemales; and yet, when the sexes differ, the males are almost always\r\nthe more conspicuously coloured. The ova are fertilised immediately\r\nafter being deposited; and when this process lasts for several days, as\r\nin the case of the salmon (34. Yarrell, ‘British Fishes,’ vol. ii. p.\r\n11.), the female, during the whole time, is attended by the male. After\r\nthe ova are fertilised they are, in most cases, left unprotected by\r\nboth parents, so that the males and females, as far as oviposition is\r\nconcerned, are equally exposed to danger, and both are equally\r\nimportant for the production of fertile ova; consequently the more or\r\nless brightly-coloured individuals of either sex would be equally\r\nliable to be destroyed or preserved, and both would have an equal\r\ninfluence on the colours of their offspring.\r\n\r\nCertain fishes, belonging to several families, make nests, and some of\r\nthem take care of their young when hatched. Both sexes of the bright\r\ncoloured Crenilabrus massa and melops work together in building their\r\nnests with sea-weed, shells, etc. (35. According to the observations of\r\nM. Gerbe; see Gunther’s ‘Record of Zoolog. Literature,’ 1865, p. 194.)\r\nBut the males of certain fishes do all the work, and afterwards take\r\nexclusive charge of the young. This is the case with the dull-coloured\r\ngobies (36. Cuvier, ‘Regne Animal,’ vol. ii. 1829, p. 242.), in which\r\nthe sexes are not known to differ in colour, and likewise with the\r\nsticklebacks (Gasterosteus), in which the males become brilliantly\r\ncoloured during the spawning season. The male of the smooth-tailed\r\nstickleback (G. leiurus) performs the duties of a nurse with exemplary\r\ncare and vigilance during a long time, and is continually employed in\r\ngently leading back the young to the nest, when they stray too far. He\r\ncourageously drives away all enemies including the females of his own\r\nspecies. It would indeed be no small relief to the male, if the female,\r\nafter depositing her eggs, were immediately devoured by some enemy, for\r\nhe is forced incessantly to drive her from the nest. (37. See Mr.\r\nWarington’s most interesting description of the habits of the\r\nGasterosteus leiurus in ‘Annals and Magazine of Nat. History,’ November\r\n1855.)\r\n\r\nThe males of certain other fishes inhabiting South America and Ceylon,\r\nbelonging to two distinct Orders, have the extraordinary habit of\r\nhatching within their mouths, or branchial cavities, the eggs laid by\r\nthe females. (38. Prof. Wyman, in ‘Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.’\r\nSept. 15, 1857. Also Prof. Turner, in ‘Journal of Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology,’ Nov. 1, 1866, p. 78. Dr. Gunther has likewise described\r\nother cases.) I am informed by Professor Agassiz that the males of the\r\nAmazonian species which follow this habit, “not only are generally\r\nbrighter than the females, but the difference is greater at the\r\nspawning-season than at any other time.” The species of Geophagus act\r\nin the same manner; and in this genus, a conspicuous protuberance\r\nbecomes developed on the forehead of the males during the\r\nbreeding-season. With the various species of Chromids, as Professor\r\nAgassiz likewise informs me, sexual differences in colour may be\r\nobserved, “whether they lay their eggs in the water among aquatic\r\nplants, or deposit them in holes, leaving them to come out without\r\nfurther care, or build shallow nests in the river mud, over which they\r\nsit, as our Pomotis does. It ought also to be observed that these\r\nsitters are among the brightest species in their respective families;\r\nfor instance, Hygrogonus is bright green, with large black ocelli,\r\nencircled with the most brilliant red.” Whether with all the species of\r\nChromids it is the male alone which sits on the eggs is not known. It\r\nis, however, manifest that the fact of the eggs being protected or\r\nunprotected by the parents, has had little or no influence on the\r\ndifferences in colour between the sexes. It is further manifest, in all\r\nthe cases in which the males take exclusive charge of the nests and\r\nyoung, that the destruction of the brighter-coloured males would be far\r\nmore influential on the character of the race, than the destruction of\r\nthe brighter-coloured females; for the death of the male during the\r\nperiod of incubation or nursing would entail the death of the young, so\r\nthat they could not inherit his peculiarities; yet, in many of these\r\nvery cases the males are more conspicuously coloured than the females.\r\n\r\nIn most of the Lophobranchii (Pipe-fish, Hippocampi, etc.) the males\r\nhave either marsupial sacks or hemispherical depressions on the\r\nabdomen, in which the ova laid by the female are hatched. The males\r\nalso shew great attachment to their young. (39. Yarrell, ‘History of\r\nBritish Fishes,’ vol. ii. 1836, pp. 329, 338.) The sexes do not\r\ncommonly differ much in colour; but Dr. Gunther believes that the male\r\nHippocampi are rather brighter than the females. The genus Solenostoma,\r\nhowever, offers a curious exceptional case (40. Dr. Gunther, since\r\npublishing an account of this species in ‘The Fishes of Zanzibar,’ by\r\nCol. Playfair, 1866, p. 137, has re-examined the specimens, and has\r\ngiven me the above information.), for the female is much more\r\nvividly-coloured and spotted than the male, and she alone has a\r\nmarsupial sack and hatches the eggs; so that the female of Solenostoma\r\ndiffers from all the other Lophobranchii in this latter respect, and\r\nfrom almost all other fishes, in being more brightly-coloured than the\r\nmale. It is improbable that this remarkable double inversion of\r\ncharacter in the female should be an accidental coincidence. As the\r\nmales of several fishes, which take exclusive charge of the eggs and\r\nyoung, are more brightly coloured than the females, and as here the\r\nfemale Solenostoma takes the same charge and is brighter than the male,\r\nit might be argued that the conspicuous colours of that sex which is\r\nthe more important of the two for the welfare of the offspring, must be\r\nin some manner protective. But from the large number of fishes, of\r\nwhich the males are either permanently or periodically brighter than\r\nthe females, but whose life is not at all more important for the\r\nwelfare of the species than that of the female, this view can hardly be\r\nmaintained. When we treat of birds we shall meet with analogous cases,\r\nwhere there has been a complete inversion of the usual attributes of\r\nthe two sexes, and we shall then give what appears to be the probable\r\nexplanation, namely, that the males have selected the more attractive\r\nfemales, instead of the latter having selected, in accordance with the\r\nusual rule throughout the animal kingdom, the more attractive males.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we may conclude, that with most fishes, in which the sexes\r\ndiffer in colour or in other ornamental characters, the males\r\noriginally varied, with their variations transmitted to the same sex,\r\nand accumulated through sexual selection by attracting or exciting the\r\nfemales. In many cases, however, such characters have been transferred,\r\neither partially or completely, to the females. In other cases, again,\r\nboth sexes have been coloured alike for the sake of protection; but in\r\nno instance does it appear that the female alone has had her colours or\r\nother characters specially modified for this latter purpose.\r\n\r\nThe last point which need be noticed is that fishes are known to make\r\nvarious noises, some of which are described as being musical. Dr.\r\nDufosse, who has especially attended to this subject, says that the\r\nsounds are voluntarily produced in several ways by different fishes: by\r\nthe friction of the pharyngeal bones—by the vibration of certain\r\nmuscles attached to the swim bladder, which serves as a resounding\r\nboard—and by the vibration of the intrinsic muscles of the swim\r\nbladder. By this latter means the Trigla produces pure and long-drawn\r\nsounds which range over nearly an octave. But the most interesting case\r\nfor us is that of two species of Ophidium, in which the males alone are\r\nprovided with a sound-producing apparatus, consisting of small movable\r\nbones, with proper muscles, in connection with the swim bladder. (41.\r\n‘Comptes-Rendus,’ tom. xlvi. 1858, p. 353; tom. xlvii. 1858, p. 916;\r\ntom. liv. 1862, p. 393. The noise made by the Umbrinas (Sciaena\r\naquila), is said by some authors to be more like that of a flute or\r\norgan, than drumming: Dr. Zouteveen, in the Dutch translation of this\r\nwork (vol. ii. p. 36), gives some further particulars on the sounds\r\nmade by fishes.) The drumming of the Umbrinas in the European seas is\r\nsaid to be audible from a depth of twenty fathoms; and the fishermen of\r\nRochelle assert “that the males alone make the noise during the\r\nspawning-time; and that it is possible by imitating it, to take them\r\nwithout bait.” (42. The Rev. C. Kingsley, in ‘Nature,’ May 1870, p.\r\n40.) From this statement, and more especially from the case of\r\nOphidium, it is almost certain that in this, the lowest class of the\r\nVertebrata, as with so many insects and spiders, sound-producing\r\ninstruments have, at least in some cases, been developed through sexual\r\nselection, as a means for bringing the sexes together.\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIANS.\r\nURODELA.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 32. Triton cristatus (half natural size, from Bell’s ‘British\r\nReptiles’). Upper figure, male during the breeding season; lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nI will begin with the tailed amphibians. The sexes of salamanders or\r\nnewts often differ much both in colour and structure. In some species\r\nprehensile claws are developed on the fore-legs of the males during the\r\nbreeding-season: and at this season in the male Triton palmipes the\r\nhind-feet are provided with a swimming-web, which is almost completely\r\nabsorbed during the winter; so that their feet then resemble those of\r\nthe female. (43. Bell, ‘History of British Reptiles,’ 2nd ed., 1849,\r\npp. 156-159.) This structure no doubt aids the male in his eager search\r\nand pursuit of the female. Whilst courting her he rapidly vibrates the\r\nend of his tail. With our common newts (Triton punctatus and cristatus)\r\na deep, much indented crest is developed along the back and tail of the\r\nmale during the breeding-season, which disappears during the winter.\r\nMr. St. George Mivart informs me that it is not furnished with muscles,\r\nand therefore cannot be used for locomotion. As during the season of\r\ncourtship it becomes edged with bright colours, there can hardly be a\r\ndoubt that it is a masculine ornament. In many species the body\r\npresents strongly contrasted, though lurid tints, and these become more\r\nvivid during the breeding-season. The male, for instance, of our common\r\nlittle newt (Triton punctatus) is “brownish-grey above, passing into\r\nyellow beneath, which in the spring becomes a rich bright orange,\r\nmarked everywhere with round dark spots.” The edge of the crest also is\r\nthen tipped with bright red or violet. The female is usually of a\r\nyellowish-brown colour with scattered brown dots, and the lower surface\r\nis often quite plain. (44. Bell, ‘History of British Reptiles,’ 2nd\r\ned., 1849, pp. 146, 151.) The young are obscurely tinted. The ova are\r\nfertilised during the act of deposition, and are not subsequently\r\ntended by either parent. We may therefore conclude that the males have\r\nacquired their strongly-marked colours and ornamental appendages\r\nthrough sexual selection; these being transmitted either to the male\r\noffspring alone, or to both sexes.\r\n\r\nANURA OR BATRACHIA.\r\n\r\nWith many frogs and toads the colours evidently serve as a protection,\r\nsuch as the bright green tints of tree frogs and the obscure mottled\r\nshades of many terrestrial species. The most conspicuously-coloured\r\ntoad which I ever saw, the Phryniscus nigricans (45. ‘Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of the “Beagle,”’ 1843. Bell, ibid. p. 49.), had the whole upper\r\nsurface of the body as black as ink, with the soles of the feet and\r\nparts of the abdomen spotted with the brightest vermilion. It crawled\r\nabout the bare sandy or open grassy plains of La Plata under a\r\nscorching sun, and could not fail to catch the eye of every passing\r\ncreature. These colours are probably beneficial by making this animal\r\nknown to all birds of prey as a nauseous mouthful.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua there is a little frog “dressed in a bright livery of red\r\nand blue” which does not conceal itself like most other species, but\r\nhops about during the daytime, and Mr. Belt says (46. ‘The Naturalist\r\nin Nicaragua,’ 1874, p. 321.) that as soon as he saw its happy sense of\r\nsecurity, he felt sure that it was uneatable. After several trials he\r\nsucceeded in tempting a young duck to snatch up a young one, but it was\r\ninstantly rejected; and the duck “went about jerking its head, as if\r\ntrying to throw off some unpleasant taste.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to sexual differences of colour, Dr. Gunther does not know\r\nof any striking instance either with frogs or toads; yet he can often\r\ndistinguish the male from the female by the tints of the former being a\r\nlittle more intense. Nor does he know of any striking difference in\r\nexternal structure between the sexes, excepting the prominences which\r\nbecome developed during the breeding-season on the front legs of the\r\nmale, by which he is enabled to hold the female. (47. The male alone of\r\nthe Bufo sikimmensis (Dr. Anderson, ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1871, p. 204)\r\nhas two plate-like callosities on the thorax and certain rugosities on\r\nthe fingers, which perhaps subserve the same end as the above-mentioned\r\nprominences.) It is surprising that these animals have not acquired\r\nmore strongly-marked sexual characters; for though cold-blooded their\r\npassions are strong. Dr. Gunther informs me that he has several times\r\nfound an unfortunate female toad dead and smothered from having been so\r\nclosely embraced by three or four males. Frogs have been observed by\r\nProfessor Hoffman in Giessen fighting all day long during the\r\nbreeding-season, and with so much violence that one had its body ripped\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nFrogs and toads offer one interesting sexual difference, namely, in the\r\nmusical powers possessed by the males; but to speak of music, when\r\napplied to the discordant and overwhelming sounds emitted by male\r\nbull-frogs and some other species, seems, according to our taste, a\r\nsingularly inappropriate expression. Nevertheless, certain frogs sing\r\nin a decidedly pleasing manner. Near Rio Janeiro I used often to sit in\r\nthe evening to listen to a number of little Hylae, perched on blades of\r\ngrass close to the water, which sent forth sweet chirping notes in\r\nharmony. The various sounds are emitted chiefly by the males during the\r\nbreeding-season, as in the case of the croaking of our common frog.\r\n(48. Bell, ‘History British Reptiles,’ 1849, p. 93.) In accordance with\r\nthis fact the vocal organs of the males are more highly-developed than\r\nthose of the females. In some genera the males alone are provided with\r\nsacs which open into the larynx. (49. J. Bishop, in ‘Todd’s Cyclopaedia\r\nof Anatomy and Physiology,’ vol. iv. p. 1503.) For instance, in the\r\nedible frog (Rana esculenta) “the sacs are peculiar to the males, and\r\nbecome, when filled with air in the act of croaking, large globular\r\nbladders, standing out one on each side of the head, near the corners\r\nof the mouth.” The croak of the male is thus rendered exceedingly\r\npowerful; whilst that of the female is only a slight groaning noise.\r\n(50. Bell, ibid. pp. 112-114.) In the several genera of the family the\r\nvocal organs differ considerably in structure, and their development in\r\nall cases may be attributed to sexual selection.\r\n\r\nREPTILES.\r\nCHELONIA.\r\n\r\nTortoises and turtles do not offer well-marked sexual differences. In\r\nsome species, the tail of the male is longer than that of the female.\r\nIn some, the plastron or lower surface of the shell of the male is\r\nslightly concave in relation to the back of the female. The male of the\r\nmud-turtle of the United States (Chrysemys picta) has claws on its\r\nfront feet twice as long as those of the female; and these are used\r\nwhen the sexes unite. (51. Mr. C.J. Maynard, ‘The American Naturalist,’\r\nDec. 1869, p. 555.) With the huge tortoise of the Galapagos Islands\r\n(Testudo nigra) the males are said to grow to a larger size than the\r\nfemales: during the pairing-season, and at no other time, the male\r\nutters a hoarse bellowing noise, which can be heard at the distance of\r\nmore than a hundred yards; the female, on the other hand, never uses\r\nher voice. (52. See my ‘Journal of Researches during the Voyage of the\r\n“Beagle,”’ 1845, p. 384.)\r\n\r\nWith the Testudo elegans of India, it is said “that the combats of the\r\nmales may be heard at some distance, from the noise they produce in\r\nbutting against each other.” (53. Dr. Gunther, ‘Reptiles of British\r\nIndia,’ 1864, p. 7.)\r\n\r\nCROCODILIA.\r\n\r\nThe sexes apparently do not differ in colour; nor do I know that the\r\nmales fight together, though this is probable, for some kinds make a\r\nprodigious display before the females. Bartram (54. ‘Travels through\r\nCarolina,’ etc., 1791, p. 128.) describes the male alligator as\r\nstriving to win the female by splashing and roaring in the midst of a\r\nlagoon, “swollen to an extent ready to burst, with its head and tail\r\nlifted up, he springs or twirls round on the surface of the water, like\r\nan Indian chief rehearsing his feats of war.” During the season of\r\nlove, a musky odour is emitted by the submaxillary glands of the\r\ncrocodile, and pervades their haunts. (55. Owen, ‘Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. i. 1866, p. 615.)\r\n\r\nOPHIDIA.\r\n\r\nDr. Gunther informs me that the males are always smaller than the\r\nfemales, and generally have longer and slenderer tails; but he knows of\r\nno other difference in external structure. In regard to colour, be can\r\nalmost always distinguish the male from the female, by his more\r\nstrongly-pronounced tints; thus the black zigzag band on the back of\r\nthe male English viper is more distinctly defined than in the female.\r\nThe difference is much plainer in the rattle-snakes of N. America, the\r\nmale of which, as the keeper in the Zoological Gardens shewed me, can\r\nat once be distinguished from the female by having more lurid yellow\r\nabout its whole body. In S. Africa the Bucephalus capensis presents an\r\nanalogous difference, for the female “is never so fully variegated with\r\nyellow on the sides as the male.” (56. Sir Andrew Smith, ‘Zoology of S.\r\nAfrica: Reptilia,’ 1849, pl. x.) The male of the Indian Dipsas cynodon,\r\non the other hand, is blackish-brown, with the belly partly black,\r\nwhilst the female is reddish or yellowish-olive, with the belly either\r\nuniform yellowish or marbled with black. In the Tragops dispar of the\r\nsame country the male is bright green, and the female bronze-coloured.\r\n(57. Dr. A. Gunther, ‘Reptiles of British India,’ Ray Soc., 1864, pp.\r\n304, 308.) No doubt the colours of some snakes are protective, as shewn\r\nby the green tints of tree-snakes, and the various mottled shades of\r\nthe species which live in sandy places; but it is doubtful whether the\r\ncolours of many kinds, for instance of the common English snake and\r\nviper, serve to conceal them; and this is still more doubtful with the\r\nmany foreign species which are coloured with extreme elegance. The\r\ncolours of certain species are very different in the adult and young\r\nstates. (58. Dr. Stoliczka, ‘Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal,’\r\nvol. xxxix, 1870, pp. 205, 211.)\r\n\r\nDuring the breeding-season the anal scent-glands of snakes are in\r\nactive function (59. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. i. 1866, p.\r\n615.); and so it is with the same glands in lizards, and as we have\r\nseen with the submaxillary glands of crocodiles. As the males of most\r\nanimals search for the females, these odoriferous glands probably serve\r\nto excite or charm the female, rather than to guide her to the spot\r\nwhere the male may be found. Male snakes, though appearing so sluggish,\r\nare amorous; for many have been observed crowding round the same\r\nfemale, and even round her dead body. They are not known to fight\r\ntogether from rivalry. Their intellectual powers are higher than might\r\nhave been anticipated. In the Zoological Gardens they soon learn not to\r\nstrike at the iron bar with which their cages are cleaned; and Dr. Keen\r\nof Philadelphia informs me that some snakes which he kept learned after\r\nfour or five times to avoid a noose, with which they were at first\r\neasily caught. An excellent observer in Ceylon, Mr. E. Layard, saw (60.\r\n‘Rambles in Ceylon,’ in ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History,’ 2nd\r\nseries, vol. ix. 1852, p. 333.) a cobra thrust its head through a\r\nnarrow hole and swallow a toad. “With this encumbrance he could not\r\nwithdraw himself; finding this, he reluctantly disgorged the precious\r\nmorsel, which began to move off; this was too much for snake philosophy\r\nto bear, and the toad was again seized, and again was the snake, after\r\nviolent efforts to escape, compelled to part with its prey. This time,\r\nhowever, a lesson had been learnt, and the toad was seized by one leg,\r\nwithdrawn, and then swallowed in triumph.”\r\n\r\nThe keeper in the Zoological Gardens is positive that certain snakes,\r\nfor instance Crotalus and Python, distinguish him from all other\r\npersons. Cobras kept together in the same cage apparently feel some\r\nattachment towards each other. (61. Dr. Gunther, ‘Reptiles of British\r\nIndia,’ 1864, p. 340.)\r\n\r\nIt does not, however, follow because snakes have some reasoning power,\r\nstrong passions and mutual affection, that they should likewise be\r\nendowed with sufficient taste to admire brilliant colours in their\r\npartners, so as to lead to the adornment of the species through sexual\r\nselection. Nevertheless, it is difficult to account in any other manner\r\nfor the extreme beauty of certain species; for instance, of the\r\ncoral-snakes of S. America, which are of a rich red with black and\r\nyellow transverse bands. I well remember how much surprise I felt at\r\nthe beauty of the first coral-snake which I saw gliding across a path\r\nin Brazil. Snakes coloured in this peculiar manner, as Mr. Wallace\r\nstates on the authority of Dr. Gunther (62. ‘Westminster Review,’ July\r\n1st, 1867, p. 32.), are found nowhere else in the world except in S.\r\nAmerica, and here no less than four genera occur. One of these, Elaps,\r\nis venomous; a second and widely-distinct genus is doubtfully venomous,\r\nand the two others are quite harmless. The species belonging to these\r\ndistinct genera inhabit the same districts, and are so like each other\r\nthat no one “but a naturalist would distinguish the harmless from the\r\npoisonous kinds.” Hence, as Mr. Wallace believes, the innocuous kinds\r\nhave probably acquired their colours as a protection, on the principle\r\nof imitation; for they would naturally be thought dangerous by their\r\nenemies. The cause, however, of the bright colours of the venomous\r\nElaps remains to be explained, and this may perhaps be sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nSnakes produce other sounds besides hissing. The deadly Echis carinata\r\nhas on its sides some oblique rows of scales of a peculiar structure\r\nwith serrated edges; and when this snake is excited these scales are\r\nrubbed against each other, which produces “a curious prolonged, almost\r\nhissing sound.” (63. Dr. Anderson, ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1871, p. 196.)\r\nWith respect to the rattling of the rattle-snake, we have at last some\r\ndefinite information: for Professor Aughey states (64. The ‘American\r\nNaturalist,’ 1873, p. 85.), that on two occasions, being himself\r\nunseen, he watched from a little distance a rattle-snake coiled up with\r\nhead erect, which continued to rattle at short intervals for half an\r\nhour: and at last he saw another snake approach, and when they met they\r\npaired. Hence he is satisfied that one of the uses of the rattle is to\r\nbring the sexes together. Unfortunately he did not ascertain whether it\r\nwas the male or the female which remained stationary and called for the\r\nother. But it by no means follows from the above fact that the rattle\r\nmay not be of use to these snakes in other ways, as a warning to\r\nanimals which would otherwise attack them. Nor can I quite disbelieve\r\nthe several accounts which have appeared of their thus paralysing their\r\nprey with fear. Some other snakes also make a distinct noise by rapidly\r\nvibrating their tails against the surrounding stalks of plants; and I\r\nhave myself heard this in the case of a Trigonocephalus in S. America.\r\n\r\nLACERTILIA.\r\n\r\nThe males of some, probably of many kinds of lizards, fight together\r\nfrom rivalry. Thus the arboreal Anolis cristatellus of S. America is\r\nextremely pugnacious: “During the spring and early part of the summer,\r\ntwo adult males rarely meet without a contest. On first seeing one\r\nanother, they nod their heads up and down three or four times, and at\r\nthe same time expanding the frill or pouch beneath the throat; their\r\neyes glisten with rage, and after waving their tails from side to side\r\nfor a few seconds, as if to gather energy, they dart at each other\r\nfuriously, rolling over and over, and holding firmly with their teeth.\r\nThe conflict generally ends in one of the combatants losing his tail,\r\nwhich is often devoured by the victor.” The male of this species is\r\nconsiderably larger than the female (65. Mr. N.L. Austen kept these\r\nanimals alive for a considerable time; see ‘Land and Water,’ July 1867,\r\np. 9.); and this, as far as Dr. Gunther has been able to ascertain, is\r\nthe general rule with lizards of all kinds. The male alone of the\r\nCyrtodactylus rubidus of the Andaman Islands possesses pre-anal pores;\r\nand these pores, judging from analogy, probably serve to emit an odour.\r\n(66. Stoliczka, ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. xxxiv.\r\n1870, p. 166.)\r\n\r\n[Fig.33. Sitana minor. Male with the gular pouch expanded (from\r\nGunther’s ‘Reptiles of India’)’]\r\n\r\nThe sexes often differ greatly in various external characters. The male\r\nof the above-mentioned Anolis is furnished with a crest which runs\r\nalong the back and tail, and can be erected at pleasure; but of this\r\ncrest the female does not exhibit a trace. In the Indian Cophotis\r\nceylanica, the female has a dorsal crest, though much less developed\r\nthan in the male; and so it is, as Dr. Gunther informs me, with the\r\nfemales of many Iguanas, Chameleons, and other lizards. In some\r\nspecies, however, the crest is equally developed in both sexes, as in\r\nthe Iguana tuberculata. In the genus Sitana, the males alone are\r\nfurnished with a large throat pouch (Fig. 33), which can be folded up\r\nlike a fan, and is coloured blue, black, and red; but these splendid\r\ncolours are exhibited only during the pairing-season. The female does\r\nnot possess even a rudiment of this appendage. In the Anolis\r\ncristatellus, according to Mr. Austen, the throat pouch, which is\r\nbright red marbled with yellow, is present in the female, though in a\r\nrudimental condition. Again, in certain other lizards, both sexes are\r\nequally well provided with throat pouches. Here we see with species\r\nbelonging to the same group, as in so many previous cases, the same\r\ncharacter either confined to the males, or more largely developed in\r\nthem than in the females, or again equally developed in both sexes. The\r\nlittle lizards of the genus Draco, which glide through the air on their\r\nrib-supported parachutes, and which in the beauty of their colours\r\nbaffle description, are furnished with skinny appendages to the throat\r\n“like the wattles of gallinaceous birds.” These become erected when the\r\nanimal is excited. They occur in both sexes, but are best developed\r\nwhen the male arrives at maturity, at which age the middle appendage is\r\nsometimes twice as long as the head. Most of the species likewise have\r\na low crest running along the neck; and this is much more developed in\r\nthe full-grown males than in the females or young males. (67. All the\r\nforegoing statements and quotations, in regard to Cophotis, Sitana and\r\nDraco, as well as the following facts in regard to Ceratophora and\r\nChamaeleon, are from Dr. Gunther himself, or from his magnificent work\r\non the ‘Reptiles of British India,’ Ray Soc., 1864, pp. 122, 130, 135.)\r\n\r\nA Chinese species is said to live in pairs during the spring; “and if\r\none is caught, the other falls from the tree to the ground, and allows\r\nitself to be captured with impunity”—I presume from despair. (68. Mr.\r\nSwinhoe, ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1870, p. 240.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 34. Ceratophora Stoddartii. Upper figure; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nThere are other and much more remarkable differences between the sexes\r\nof certain lizards. The male of Ceratophora aspera bears on the\r\nextremity of his snout an appendage half as long as the head. It is\r\ncylindrical, covered with scales, flexible, and apparently capable of\r\nerection: in the female it is quite rudimental. In a second species of\r\nthe same genus a terminal scale forms a minute horn on the summit of\r\nthe flexible appendage; and in a third species (C. Stoddartii, fig. 34)\r\nthe whole appendage is converted into a horn, which is usually of a\r\nwhite colour, but assumes a purplish tint when the animal is excited.\r\nIn the adult male of this latter species the horn is half an inch in\r\nlength, but it is of quite minute size in the female and in the young.\r\nThese appendages, as Dr. Gunther has remarked to me, may be compared\r\nwith the combs of gallinaceous birds, and apparently serve as\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 35. Chamaeleo bifurcus. Upper figure, male; lower figure, female.\r\n\r\nFig. 36. Chamaeleo Owenii. Upper figure, male; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nIn the genus Chamaeleon we come to the acme of difference between the\r\nsexes. The upper part of the skull of the male C. bifurcus (Fig. 35),\r\nan inhabitant of Madagascar, is produced into two great, solid, bony\r\nprojections, covered with scales like the rest of the head; and of this\r\nwonderful modification of structure the female exhibits only a\r\nrudiment. Again, in Chamaeleo Owenii (Fig. 36), from the West Coast of\r\nAfrica, the male bears on his snout and forehead three curious horns,\r\nof which the female has not a trace. These horns consist of an\r\nexcrescence of bone covered with a smooth sheath, forming part of the\r\ngeneral integuments of the body, so that they are identical in\r\nstructure with those of a bull, goat, or other sheath-horned ruminant.\r\nAlthough the three horns differ so much in appearance from the two\r\ngreat prolongations of the skull in C. bifurcus, we can hardly doubt\r\nthat they serve the same general purpose in the economy of these two\r\nanimals. The first conjecture, which will occur to every one, is that\r\nthey are used by the males for fighting together; and as these animals\r\nare very quarrelsome (69. Dr. Buchholz, ‘Monatsbericht K. Preuss.\r\nAkad.’ Jan. 1874, p. 78.), this is probably a correct view. Mr. T.W.\r\nWood also informs me that he once watched two individuals of C. pumilus\r\nfighting violently on the branch of a tree; they flung their heads\r\nabout and tried to bite each other; they then rested for a time and\r\nafterwards continued their battle.\r\n\r\nWith many lizards the sexes differ slightly in colour, the tints and\r\nstripes of the males being brighter and more distinctly defined than in\r\nthe females. This, for instance, is the case with the above Cophotis\r\nand with the Acanthodactylus capensis of S. Africa. In a Cordylus of\r\nthe latter country, the male is either much redder or greener than the\r\nfemale. In the Indian Calotes nigrilabris there is a still greater\r\ndifference; the lips also of the male are black, whilst those of the\r\nfemale are green. In our common little viviparous lizard (Zootoca\r\nvivipara) “the under side of the body and base of the tail in the male\r\nare bright orange, spotted with black; in the female these parts are\r\npale-greyish-green without spots.” (70. Bell, ‘History of British\r\nReptiles,’ 2nd ed., 1849, p. 40.) We have seen that the males alone of\r\nSitana possess a throat-pouch; and this is splendidly tinted with blue,\r\nblack, and red. In the Proctotretus tenuis of Chile the male alone is\r\nmarked with spots of blue, green, and coppery-red. (71. For\r\nProctotretus, see ‘Zoology of the Voyage of the “Beagle”; Reptiles,’ by\r\nMr. Bell, p. 8. For the Lizards of S. Africa, see ‘Zoology of S.\r\nAfrica: Reptiles,’ by Sir Andrew Smith, pl. 25 and 39. For the Indian\r\nCalotes, see ‘Reptiles of British India,’ by Dr. Gunther, p. 143.) In\r\nmany cases the males retain the same colours throughout the year, but\r\nin others they become much brighter during the breeding-season; I may\r\ngive as an additional instance the Calotes maria, which at this season\r\nhas a bright red head, the rest of the body being green. (72. Gunther\r\nin ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1870, p. 778, with a coloured\r\nfigure.)\r\n\r\nBoth sexes of many species are beautifully coloured exactly alike; and\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that such colours are protective. No\r\ndoubt with the bright green kinds which live in the midst of\r\nvegetation, this colour serves to conceal them; and in N. Patagonia I\r\nsaw a lizard (Proctotretus multimaculatus) which, when frightened,\r\nflattened its body, closed its eyes, and then from its mottled tints\r\nwas hardly distinguishable from the surrounding sand. But the bright\r\ncolours with which so many lizards are ornamented, as well as their\r\nvarious curious appendages, were probably acquired by the males as an\r\nattraction, and then transmitted either to their male offspring alone,\r\nor to both sexes. Sexual selection, indeed, seems to have played almost\r\nas important a part with reptiles as with birds; and the less\r\nconspicuous colours of the females in comparison with the males cannot\r\nbe accounted for, as Mr. Wallace believes to be the case with birds, by\r\nthe greater exposure of the females to danger during incubation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSexual differences—Law of battle—Special weapons—Vocal\r\norgans—Instrumental music—Love-antics and dances—Decorations, permanent\r\nand seasonal—Double and single annual moults—Display of ornaments by\r\nthe males.\r\n\r\nSecondary sexual characters are more diversified and conspicuous in\r\nbirds, though not perhaps entailing more important changes of\r\nstructure, than in any other class of animals. I shall, therefore,\r\ntreat the subject at considerable length. Male birds sometimes, though\r\nrarely, possess special weapons for fighting with each other. They\r\ncharm the female by vocal or instrumental music of the most varied\r\nkinds. They are ornamented by all sorts of combs, wattles,\r\nprotuberances, horns, air-distended sacks, top-knots, naked shafts,\r\nplumes and lengthened feathers gracefully springing from all parts of\r\nthe body. The beak and naked skin about the head, and the feathers, are\r\noften gorgeously coloured. The males sometimes pay their court by\r\ndancing, or by fantastic antics performed either on the ground or in\r\nthe air. In one instance, at least, the male emits a musky odour, which\r\nwe may suppose serves to charm or excite the female; for that excellent\r\nobserver, Mr. Ramsay (1. ‘Ibis,’ vol. iii. (new series), 1867, p.\r\n414.), says of the Australian musk-duck (Biziura lobata) that “the\r\nsmell which the male emits during the summer months is confined to that\r\nsex, and in some individuals is retained throughout the year; I have\r\nnever, even in the breeding-season, shot a female which had any smell\r\nof musk.” So powerful is this odour during the pairing-season, that it\r\ncan be detected long before the bird can be seen. (2. Gould, ‘Handbook\r\nof the Birds of Australia,’ 1865, vol. ii. p. 383.) On the whole, birds\r\nappear to be the most aesthetic of all animals, excepting of course\r\nman, and they have nearly the same taste for the beautiful as we have.\r\nThis is shewn by our enjoyment of the singing of birds, and by our\r\nwomen, both civilised and savage, decking their heads with borrowed\r\nplumes, and using gems which are hardly more brilliantly coloured than\r\nthe naked skin and wattles of certain birds. In man, however, when\r\ncultivated, the sense of beauty is manifestly a far more complex\r\nfeeling, and is associated with various intellectual ideas.\r\n\r\nBefore treating of the sexual characters with which we are here more\r\nparticularly concerned, I may just allude to certain differences\r\nbetween the sexes which apparently depend on differences in their\r\nhabits of life; for such cases, though common in the lower, are rare in\r\nthe higher classes. Two humming-birds belonging to the genus\r\nEustephanus, which inhabit the island of Juan Fernandez, were long\r\nthought to be specifically distinct, but are now known, as Mr. Gould\r\ninforms me, to be the male and female of the same species, and they\r\ndiffer slightly in the form of the beak. In another genus of\r\nhumming-birds (Grypus), the beak of the male is serrated along the\r\nmargin and hooked at the extremity, thus differing much from that of\r\nthe female. In the Neomorpha of New Zealand, there is, as we have seen,\r\na still wider difference in the form of the beak in relation to the\r\nmanner of feeding of the two sexes. Something of the same kind has been\r\nobserved with the goldfinch (Carduelis elegans), for I am assured by\r\nMr. J. Jenner Weir that the bird-catchers can distinguish the males by\r\ntheir slightly longer beaks. The flocks of males are often found\r\nfeeding on the seeds of the teazle (Dipsacus), which they can reach\r\nwith their elongated beaks, whilst the females more commonly feed on\r\nthe seeds of the betony or Scrophularia. With a slight difference of\r\nthis kind as a foundation, we can see how the beaks of the two sexes\r\nmight be made to differ greatly through natural selection. In some of\r\nthe above cases, however, it is possible that the beaks of the males\r\nmay have been first modified in relation to their contests with other\r\nmales; and that this afterwards led to slightly changed habits of life.\r\n\r\nLAW OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\nAlmost all male birds are extremely pugnacious, using their beaks,\r\nwings, and legs for fighting together. We see this every spring with\r\nour robins and sparrows. The smallest of all birds, namely the\r\nhumming-bird, is one of the most quarrelsome. Mr. Gosse (3. Quoted by\r\nMr. Gould, ‘Introduction to the Trochilidae,’ 1861, page 29.) describes\r\na battle in which a pair seized hold of each other’s beaks, and whirled\r\nround and round, till they almost fell to the ground; and M. Montes de\r\nOca, in speaking or another genus of humming-bird, says that two males\r\nrarely meet without a fierce aerial encounter: when kept in cages\r\n“their fighting has mostly ended in the splitting of the tongue of one\r\nof the two, which then surely dies from being unable to feed.” (4.\r\nGould, ibid. p. 52.) With waders, the males of the common water-hen\r\n(Gallinula chloropus) “when pairing, fight violently for the females:\r\nthey stand nearly upright in the water and strike with their feet.” Two\r\nwere seen to be thus engaged for half an hour, until one got hold of\r\nthe head of the other, which would have been killed had not the\r\nobserver interfered; the female all the time looking on as a quiet\r\nspectator. (5. W. Thompson, ‘Natural History of Ireland: Birds,’ vol.\r\nii. 1850, p. 327.) Mr. Blyth informs me that the males of an allied\r\nbird (Gallicrex cristatus) are a third larger than the females, and are\r\nso pugnacious during the breeding-season that they are kept by the\r\nnatives of Eastern Bengal for the sake of fighting. Various other birds\r\nare kept in India for the same purpose, for instance, the bulbuls\r\n(Pycnonotus hoemorrhous) which “fight with great spirit.” (6. Jerdon,\r\n‘Birds of India,’ 1863, vol. ii. p. 96.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 37. The Ruff or Machetes pugnax (from Brehm’s ‘Thierleben’).]\r\n\r\nThe polygamous ruff (Machetes pugnax, Fig. 37) is notorious for his\r\nextreme pugnacity; and in the spring, the males, which are considerably\r\nlarger than the females, congregate day after day at a particular spot,\r\nwhere the females propose to lay their eggs. The fowlers discover these\r\nspots by the turf being trampled somewhat bare. Here they fight very\r\nmuch like game-cocks, seizing each other with their beaks and striking\r\nwith their wings. The great ruff of feathers round the neck is then\r\nerected, and according to Col. Montagu “sweeps the ground as a shield\r\nto defend the more tender parts”; and this is the only instance known\r\nto me in the case of birds of any structure serving as a shield. The\r\nruff of feathers, however, from its varied and rich colours probably\r\nserves in chief part as an ornament. Like most pugnacious birds, they\r\nseem always ready to fight, and when closely confined, often kill each\r\nother; but Montagu observed that their pugnacity becomes greater during\r\nthe spring, when the long feathers on their necks are fully developed;\r\nand at this period the least movement by any one bird provokes a\r\ngeneral battle. (7. Macgillivray, ‘History of British Birds,’ vol. iv.\r\n1852, pp. 177-181.) Of the pugnacity of web-footed birds, two instances\r\nwill suffice: in Guiana “bloody fights occur during the breeding-season\r\nbetween the males of the wild musk-duck (Cairina moschata); and where\r\nthese fights have occurred the river is covered for some distance with\r\nfeathers.” (8. Sir R. Schomburgk, in ‘Journal of Royal Geographic\r\nSociety,’ vol. xiii. 1843, p. 31.) Birds which seem ill-adapted for\r\nfighting engage in fierce conflicts; thus the stronger males of the\r\npelican drive away the weaker ones, snapping with their huge beaks and\r\ngiving heavy blows with their wings. Male snipe fight together,\r\n“tugging and pushing each other with their bills in the most curious\r\nmanner imaginable.” Some few birds are believed never to fight; this is\r\nthe case, according to Audubon, with one of the woodpeckers of the\r\nUnited States (Picu sauratus), although “the hens are followed by even\r\nhalf a dozen of their gay suitors.” (9. ‘Ornithological Biography,’\r\nvol. i. p. 191. For pelicans and snipes, see vol. iii. pp. 138, 477.)\r\n\r\nThe males of many birds are larger than the females, and this no doubt\r\nis the result of the advantage gained by the larger and stronger males\r\nover their rivals during many generations. The difference in size\r\nbetween the two sexes is carried to an extreme point in several\r\nAustralian species; thus the male musk-duck (Biziura), and the male\r\nCincloramphus cruralis (allied to our pipits) are by measurement\r\nactually twice as large as their respective females. (10. Gould,\r\n‘Handbook of Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. p. 395; vol. ii. p. 383.)\r\nWith many other birds the females are larger than the males; and, as\r\nformerly remarked, the explanation often given, namely, that the\r\nfemales have most of the work in feeding their young, will not suffice.\r\nIn some few cases, as we shall hereafter see, the females apparently\r\nhave acquired their greater size and strength for the sake of\r\nconquering other females and obtaining possession of the males.\r\n\r\nThe males of many gallinaceous birds, especially of the polygamous\r\nkinds, are furnished with special weapons for fighting with their\r\nrivals, namely spurs, which can be used with fearful effect. It has\r\nbeen recorded by a trustworthy writer (11. Mr. Hewitt, in the ‘Poultry\r\nBook’ by Tegetmeier, 1866, p. 137.) that in Derbyshire a kite struck at\r\na game-hen accompanied by her chickens, when the cock rushed to the\r\nrescue, and drove his spur right through the eye and skull of the\r\naggressor. The spur was with difficulty drawn from the skull, and as\r\nthe kite, though dead, retained his grasp, the two birds were firmly\r\nlocked together; but the cock when disentangled was very little\r\ninjured. The invincible courage of the game-cock is notorious: a\r\ngentleman who long ago witnessed the brutal scene, told me that a bird\r\nhad both its legs broken by some accident in the cockpit, and the owner\r\nlaid a wager that if the legs could be spliced so that the bird could\r\nstand upright, he would continue fighting. This was effected on the\r\nspot, and the bird fought with undaunted courage until he received his\r\ndeath-stroke. In Ceylon a closely allied, wild species, the Gallus\r\nStanleyi, is known to fight desperately “in defence of his seraglio,”\r\nso that one of the combatants is frequently found dead. (12. Layard,\r\n‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History,’ vol. xiv. 1854, p. 63.) An\r\nIndian partridge (Ortygornis gularis), the male of which is furnished\r\nwith strong and sharp spurs, is so quarrelsome “that the scars of\r\nformer fights disfigure the breast of almost every bird you kill.” (13.\r\nJerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 574.)\r\n\r\nThe males of almost all gallinaceous birds, even those which are not\r\nfurnished with spurs, engage during the breeding-season in fierce\r\nconflicts. The Capercailzie and Black-cock (Tetrao urogallus and T.\r\ntetrix), which are both polygamists, have regular appointed places,\r\nwhere during many weeks they congregate in numbers to fight together\r\nand to display their charms before the females. Dr. W. Kovalevsky\r\ninforms me that in Russia he has seen the snow all bloody on the arenas\r\nwhere the capercailzie have fought; and the black-cocks “make the\r\nfeathers fly in every direction,” when several “engage in a battle\r\nroyal.” The elder Brehm gives a curious account of the Balz, as the\r\nlove-dances and love-songs of the Black-cock are called in Germany. The\r\nbird utters almost continuously the strangest noises: “he holds his\r\ntail up and spreads it out like a fan, he lifts up his head and neck\r\nwith all the feathers erect, and stretches his wings from the body.\r\nThen he takes a few jumps in different directions, sometimes in a\r\ncircle, and presses the under part of his beak so hard against the\r\nground that the chin feathers are rubbed off. During these movements he\r\nbeats his wings and turns round and round. The more ardent he grows the\r\nmore lively he becomes, until at last the bird appears like a frantic\r\ncreature.” At such times the black-cocks are so absorbed that they\r\nbecome almost blind and deaf, but less so than the capercailzie: hence\r\nbird after bird may be shot on the same spot, or even caught by the\r\nhand. After performing these antics the males begin to fight: and the\r\nsame black-cock, in order to prove his strength over several\r\nantagonists, will visit in the course of one morning several\r\nBalz-places, which remain the same during successive years. (14. Brehm,\r\n‘Thierleben,’ 1867, B. iv. s. 351. Some of the foregoing statements are\r\ntaken from L. Lloyd, ‘The Game Birds of Sweden,’ etc., 1867, p. 79.)\r\n\r\nThe peacock with his long train appears more like a dandy than a\r\nwarrior, but he sometimes engages in fierce contests: the Rev. W.\r\nDarwin Fox informs me that at some little distance from Chester two\r\npeacocks became so excited whilst fighting, that they flew over the\r\nwhole city, still engaged, until they alighted on the top of St. John’s\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nThe spur, in those gallinaceous birds which are thus provided, is\r\ngenerally single; but Polyplectron (Fig. 51) has two or more on each\r\nleg; and one of the Blood-pheasants (Ithaginis cruentus) has been seen\r\nwith five spurs. The spurs are generally confined to the male, being\r\nrepresented by mere knobs or rudiments in the female; but the females\r\nof the Java peacock (Pavo muticus) and, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth,\r\nof the small fire-backed pheasant (Euplocamus erythrophthalmus) possess\r\nspurs. In Galloperdix it is usual for the males to have two spurs, and\r\nfor the females to have only one on each leg. (15. Jerdon, ‘Birds of\r\nIndia’: on Ithaginis, vol. iii. p. 523; on Galloperdix, p. 541.) Hence\r\nspurs may be considered as a masculine structure, which has been\r\noccasionally more or less transferred to the females. Like most other\r\nsecondary sexual characters, the spurs are highly variable, both in\r\nnumber and development, in the same species.\r\n\r\n[Fig.38. Palamedea cornuta (from Brehm), shewing the double wing-spurs,\r\nand the filament on the head.]\r\n\r\nVarious birds have spurs on their wings. But the Egyptian goose\r\n(Chenalopex aegyptiacus) has only “bare obtuse knobs,” and these\r\nprobably shew us the first steps by which true spurs have been\r\ndeveloped in other species. In the spur-winged goose, Plectropterus\r\ngambensis, the males have much larger spurs than the females; and they\r\nuse them, as I am informed by Mr. Bartlett, in fighting together, so\r\nthat, in this case, the wing-spurs serve as sexual weapons; but\r\naccording to Livingstone, they are chiefly used in the defence of the\r\nyoung. The Palamedea (Fig. 38) is armed with a pair of spurs on each\r\nwing; and these are such formidable weapons that a single blow has been\r\nknown to drive a dog howling away. But it does not appear that the\r\nspurs in this case, or in that of some of the spur-winged rails, are\r\nlarger in the male than in the female. (16. For the Egyptian goose, see\r\nMacgillivray, ‘British Birds,’ vol. iv. p. 639. For Plectropterus,\r\nLivingstone’s ‘Travels,’ p. 254. For Palamedea, Brehm’s ‘Thierleben,’\r\nB. iv. s. 740. See also on this bird Azara, ‘Voyages dans l’Amerique\r\nmerid.’ tom. iv. 1809, pp. 179, 253.) In certain plovers, however, the\r\nwing-spurs must be considered as a sexual character. Thus in the male\r\nof our common peewit (Vanellus cristatus) the tubercle on the shoulder\r\nof the wing becomes more prominent during the breeding-season, and the\r\nmales fight together. In some species of Lobivanellus a similar\r\ntubercle becomes developed during the breeding-season “into a short\r\nhorny spur.” In the Australian L. lobatus both sexes have spurs, but\r\nthese are much larger in the males than in the females. In an allied\r\nbird, the Hoplopterus armatus, the spurs do not increase in size during\r\nthe breeding-season; but these birds have been seen in Egypt to fight\r\ntogether, in the same manner as our peewits, by turning suddenly in the\r\nair and striking sideways at each other, sometimes with fatal results.\r\nThus also they drive away other enemies. (17. See, on our peewit, Mr.\r\nR. Carr in ‘Land and Water,’ Aug. 8th, 1868, p. 46. In regard to\r\nLobivanellus, see Jerdon’s ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 647, and\r\nGould’s ‘Handbook of Birds of Australia,’ vol. ii. p. 220. For the\r\nHoplopterus, see Mr. Allen in the ‘Ibis,’ vol. v. 1863, p. 156.)\r\n\r\nThe season of love is that of battle; but the males of some birds, as\r\nof the game-fowl and ruff, and even the young males of the wild turkey\r\nand grouse (18. Audubon, ‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. ii. p. 492;\r\nvol. i. pp. 4-13.), are ready to fight whenever they meet. The presence\r\nof the female is the teterrima belli causa. The Bengali baboos make the\r\npretty little males of the amadavat (Estrelda amandava) fight together\r\nby placing three small cages in a row, with a female in the middle;\r\nafter a little time the two males are turned loose, and immediately a\r\ndesperate battle ensues. (19. Mr. Blyth, ‘Land and Water,’ 1867, p.\r\n212.) When many males congregate at the same appointed spot and fight\r\ntogether, as in the case of grouse and various other birds, they are\r\ngenerally attended by the females (20. Richardson on Tetrao umbellus,\r\n‘Fauna Bor. Amer.: Birds,’ 1831, p. 343. L. Lloyd, ‘Game Birds of\r\nSweden,’ 1867, pp. 22, 79, on the capercailzie and black-cock. Brehm,\r\nhowever, asserts (‘Thierleben,’ B. iv. s. 352) that in Germany the\r\ngrey-hens do not generally attend the Balzen of the black-cocks, but\r\nthis is an exception to the common rule; possibly the hens may lie\r\nhidden in the surrounding bushes, as is known to be the case with the\r\ngray-hens in Scandinavia, and with other species in N. America.), which\r\nafterwards pair with the victorious combatants. But in some cases the\r\npairing precedes instead of succeeding the combat: thus according to\r\nAudubon (21. ‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. ii. p. 275.), several\r\nmales of the Virginian goat-sucker (Caprimulgus virgianus) “court, in a\r\nhighly entertaining manner the female, and no sooner has she made her\r\nchoice, than her approved gives chase to all intruders, and drives them\r\nbeyond his dominions.” Generally the males try to drive away or kill\r\ntheir rivals before they pair. It does not, however, appear that the\r\nfemales invariably prefer the victorious males. I have indeed been\r\nassured by Dr. W. Kovalevsky that the female capercailzie sometimes\r\nsteals away with a young male who has not dared to enter the arena with\r\nthe older cocks, in the same manner as occasionally happens with the\r\ndoes of the red-deer in Scotland. When two males contend in presence of\r\na single female, the victor, no doubt, commonly gains his desire; but\r\nsome of these battles are caused by wandering males trying to distract\r\nthe peace of an already mated pair. (22. Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ etc., B.\r\niv. 1867, p. 990. Audubon, ‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. ii. p.\r\n492.)\r\n\r\nEven with the most pugnacious species it is probable that the pairing\r\ndoes not depend exclusively on the mere strength and courage of the\r\nmale; for such males are generally decorated with various ornaments,\r\nwhich often become more brilliant during the breeding-season, and which\r\nare sedulously displayed before the females. The males also endeavour\r\nto charm or excite their mates by love-notes, songs, and antics; and\r\nthe courtship is, in many instances, a prolonged affair. Hence it is\r\nnot probable that the females are indifferent to the charms of the\r\nopposite sex, or that they are invariably compelled to yield to the\r\nvictorious males. It is more probable that the females are excited,\r\neither before or after the conflict, by certain males, and thus\r\nunconsciously prefer them. In the case of Tetrao umbellus, a good\r\nobserver (23. ‘Land and Water,’ July 25, 1868, p. 14.) goes so far as\r\nto believe that the battles of the male “are all a sham, performed to\r\nshow themselves to the greatest advantage before the admiring females\r\nwho assemble around; for I have never been able to find a maimed hero,\r\nand seldom more than a broken feather.” I shall have to recur to this\r\nsubject, but I may here add that with the Tetrao cupido of the United\r\nStates, about a score of males assemble at a particular spot, and,\r\nstrutting about, make the whole air resound with their extraordinary\r\nnoises. At the first answer from a female the males begin to fight\r\nfuriously, and the weaker give way; but then, according to Audubon,\r\nboth the victors and vanquished search for the female, so that the\r\nfemales must either then exert a choice, or the battle must be renewed.\r\nSo, again, with one of the field-starlings of the United States\r\n(Sturnella ludoviciana) the males engage in fierce conflicts, “but at\r\nthe sight of a female they all fly after her as if mad.” (24. Audubon’s\r\n‘Ornithological Biography;’ on Tetrao cupido, vol. ii. p. 492; on the\r\nSturnus, vol. ii. p. 219.)\r\n\r\nVOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.\r\n\r\nWith birds the voice serves to express various emotions, such as\r\ndistress, fear, anger, triumph, or mere happiness. It is apparently\r\nsometimes used to excite terror, as in the case of the hissing noise\r\nmade by some nestling-birds. Audubon (25. ‘Ornithological Biography,’\r\nvol. v. p. 601.), relates that a night-heron (Ardea nycticorax, Linn.),\r\nwhich he kept tame, used to hide itself when a cat approached, and then\r\n“suddenly start up uttering one of the most frightful cries, apparently\r\nenjoying the cat’s alarm and flight.” The common domestic cock clucks\r\nto the hen, and the hen to her chickens, when a dainty morsel is found.\r\nThe hen, when she has laid an egg, “repeats the same note very often,\r\nand concludes with the sixth above, which she holds for a longer time”\r\n(26. The Hon. Daines Barrington, ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1773, p.\r\n252.); and thus she expresses her joy. Some social birds apparently\r\ncall to each other for aid; and as they flit from tree to tree, the\r\nflock is kept together by chirp answering chirp. During the nocturnal\r\nmigrations of geese and other water-fowl, sonorous clangs from the van\r\nmay be heard in the darkness overhead, answered by clangs in the rear.\r\nCertain cries serve as danger signals, which, as the sportsman knows to\r\nhis cost, are understood by the same species and by others. The\r\ndomestic cock crows, and the humming-bird chirps, in triumph over a\r\ndefeated rival. The true song, however, of most birds and various\r\nstrange cries are chiefly uttered during the breeding-season, and serve\r\nas a charm, or merely as a call-note, to the other sex.\r\n\r\nNaturalists are much divided with respect to the object of the singing\r\nof birds. Few more careful observers ever lived than Montagu, and he\r\nmaintained that the “males of song-birds and of many others do not in\r\ngeneral search for the female, but, on the contrary, their business in\r\nthe spring is to perch on some conspicuous spot, breathing out their\r\nfull and amorous notes, which, by instinct, the female knows, and\r\nrepairs to the spot to choose her mate.” (27. ‘Ornithological\r\nDictionary,’ 1833, p. 475.) Mr. Jenner Weir informs me that this is\r\ncertainly the case with the nightingale. Bechstein, who kept birds\r\nduring his whole life, asserts, “that the female canary always chooses\r\nthe best singer, and that in a state of nature the female finch selects\r\nthat male out of a hundred whose notes please her most. (28.\r\n‘Naturgeschichte der Stubenvögel,’ 1840, s. 4. Mr. Harrison Weir\r\nlikewise writes to me:—“I am informed that the best singing males\r\ngenerally get a mate first, when they are bred in the same room.”)\r\nThere can be no doubt that birds closely attend to each other’s song.\r\nMr. Weir has told me of the case of a bullfinch which had been taught\r\nto pipe a German waltz, and who was so good a performer that he cost\r\nten guineas; when this bird was first introduced into a room where\r\nother birds were kept and he began to sing, all the others, consisting\r\nof about twenty linnets and canaries, ranged themselves on the nearest\r\nside of their cages, and listened with the greatest interest to the new\r\nperformer. Many naturalists believe that the singing of birds is almost\r\nexclusively “the effect of rivalry and emulation,” and not for the sake\r\nof charming their mates. This was the opinion of Daines Barrington and\r\nWhite of Selborne, who both especially attended to this subject. (29.\r\n‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1773, p. 263. White’s ‘Natural History of\r\nSelborne,’ 1825, vol. i. p. 246.) Barrington, however, admits that\r\n“superiority in song gives to birds an amazing ascendancy over others,\r\nas is well known to bird-catchers.”\r\n\r\nIt is certain that there is an intense degree of rivalry between the\r\nmales in their singing. Bird-fanciers match their birds to see which\r\nwill sing longest; and I was told by Mr. Yarrell that a first-rate bird\r\nwill sometimes sing till he drops down almost dead, or according to\r\nBechstein (30. ‘Naturgesch. der Stubenvögel,’ 1840, s. 252.), quite\r\ndead from rupturing a vessel in the lungs. Whatever the cause may be,\r\nmale birds, as I hear from Mr. Weir, often die suddenly during the\r\nseason of song. That the habit of singing is sometimes quite\r\nindependent of love is clear, for a sterile, hybrid canary-bird has\r\nbeen described (31. Mr. Bold, ‘Zoologist,’ 1843-44, p. 659.) as singing\r\nwhilst viewing itself in a mirror, and then dashing at its own image;\r\nit likewise attacked with fury a female canary, when put into the same\r\ncage. The jealousy excited by the act of singing is constantly taken\r\nadvantage of by bird-catchers; a male, in good song, is hidden and\r\nprotected, whilst a stuffed bird, surrounded by limed twigs, is exposed\r\nto view. In this manner, as Mr. Weir informs me, a man has in the\r\ncourse of a single day caught fifty, and in one instance, seventy, male\r\nchaffinches. The power and inclination to sing differ so greatly with\r\nbirds that although the price of an ordinary male chaffinch is only\r\nsixpence, Mr. Weir saw one bird for which the bird-catcher asked three\r\npounds; the test of a really good singer being that it will continue to\r\nsing whilst the cage is swung round the owner’s head.\r\n\r\nThat male birds should sing from emulation as well as for charming the\r\nfemale, is not at all incompatible; and it might have been expected\r\nthat these two habits would have concurred, like those of display and\r\npugnacity. Some authors, however, argue that the song of the male\r\ncannot serve to charm the female, because the females of some few\r\nspecies, such as of the canary, robin, lark, and bullfinch, especially\r\nwhen in a state of widowhood, as Bechstein remarks, pour forth fairly\r\nmelodious strains. In some of these cases the habit of singing may be\r\nin part attributed to the females having been highly fed and confined\r\n(32. D. Barrington, ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1773, p. 262.\r\nBechstein, ‘Stubenvögel,’ 1840, s. 4.), for this disturbs all the\r\nfunctions connected with the reproduction of the species. Many\r\ninstances have already been given of the partial transference of\r\nsecondary masculine characters to the female, so that it is not at all\r\nsurprising that the females of some species should possess the power of\r\nsong. It has also been argued, that the song of the male cannot serve\r\nas a charm, because the males of certain species, for instance of the\r\nrobin, sing during the autumn. (33. This is likewise the case with the\r\nwater-ouzel; see Mr. Hepburn in the ‘Zoologist,’ 1845-46, p. 1068.) But\r\nnothing is more common than for animals to take pleasure in practising\r\nwhatever instinct they follow at other times for some real good. How\r\noften do we see birds which fly easily, gliding and sailing through the\r\nair obviously for pleasure? The cat plays with the captured mouse, and\r\nthe cormorant with the captured fish. The weaver-bird (Ploceus), when\r\nconfined in a cage, amuses itself by neatly weaving blades of grass\r\nbetween the wires of its cage. Birds which habitually fight during the\r\nbreeding-season are generally ready to fight at all times; and the\r\nmales of the capercailzie sometimes hold their Balzen or leks at the\r\nusual place of assemblage during the autumn. (34. L. Lloyd, ‘Game Birds\r\nof Sweden,’ 1867, p. 25.) Hence it is not at all surprising that male\r\nbirds should continue singing for their own amusement after the season\r\nfor courtship is over.\r\n\r\nAs shewn in a previous chapter, singing is to a certain extent an art,\r\nand is much improved by practice. Birds can be taught various tunes,\r\nand even the unmelodious sparrow has learnt to sing like a linnet. They\r\nacquire the song of their foster parents (35. Barrington, ibid. p. 264,\r\nBechstein, ibid. s. 5.), and sometimes that of their neighbours. (36.\r\nDureau de la Malle gives a curious instance (‘Annales des Sc. Nat.’ 3rd\r\nseries, Zoolog., tom. x. p. 118) of some wild blackbirds in his garden\r\nin Paris, which naturally learnt a republican air from a caged bird.)\r\nAll the common songsters belong to the Order of Insessores, and their\r\nvocal organs are much more complex than those of most other birds; yet\r\nit is a singular fact that some of the Insessores, such as ravens,\r\ncrows, and magpies, possess the proper apparatus (37. Bishop, in\r\n‘Todd’s Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology,’ vol. iv. p. 1496.),\r\nthough they never sing, and do not naturally modulate their voices to\r\nany great extent. Hunter asserts (38. As stated by Barrington in\r\n‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1773, p. 262.) that with the true\r\nsongsters the muscles of the larynx are stronger in the males than in\r\nthe females; but with this slight exception there is no difference in\r\nthe vocal organs of the two sexes, although the males of most species\r\nsing so much better and more continuously than the females.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that only small birds properly sing. The Australian\r\ngenus Menura, however, must be excepted; for the Menura Alberti, which\r\nis about the size of a half-grown turkey, not only mocks other birds,\r\nbut “its own whistle is exceedingly beautiful and varied.” The males\r\ncongregate and form “corroborying places,” where they sing, raising and\r\nspreading their tails like peacocks, and drooping their wings. (39.\r\nGould, ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. 1865, pp. 308-310.\r\nSee also Mr. T.W. Wood in the ‘Student,’ April 1870, p. 125.) It is\r\nalso remarkable that birds which sing well are rarely decorated with\r\nbrilliant colours or other ornaments. Of our British birds, excepting\r\nthe bullfinch and goldfinch, the best songsters are plain-coloured. The\r\nkingfisher, bee-eater, roller, hoopoe, woodpeckers, etc., utter harsh\r\ncries; and the brilliant birds of the tropics are hardly ever\r\nsongsters. (40. See remarks to this effect in Gould’s ‘Introduction to\r\nthe Trochilidae,’ 1861, p. 22.) Hence bright colours and the power of\r\nsong seem to replace each other. We can perceive that if the plumage\r\ndid not vary in brightness, or if bright colours were dangerous to the\r\nspecies, other means would be employed to charm the females; and melody\r\nof voice offers one such means.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 39. Tetrao cupido: male. (T.W. Wood.)]\r\n\r\nIn some birds the vocal organs differ greatly in the two sexes. In the\r\nTetrao cupido (Fig. 39) the male has two bare, orange-coloured sacks,\r\none on each side of the neck; and these are largely inflated when the\r\nmale, during the breeding-season, makes his curious hollow sound,\r\naudible at a great distance. Audubon proved that the sound was\r\nintimately connected with this apparatus (which reminds us of the\r\nair-sacks on each side of the mouth of certain male frogs), for he\r\nfound that the sound was much diminished when one of the sacks of a\r\ntame bird was pricked, and when both were pricked it was altogether\r\nstopped. The female has “a somewhat similar, though smaller naked space\r\nof skin on the neck; but this is not capable of inflation.” (41. ‘The\r\nSportsman and Naturalist in Canada,’ by Major W. Ross King, 1866, pp.\r\n144-146. Mr. T.W. Wood gives in the ‘Student’ (April 1870, p. 116) an\r\nexcellent account of the attitude and habits of this bird during its\r\ncourtship. He states that the ear-tufts or neck-plumes are erected, so\r\nthat they meet over the crown of the head. See his drawing, Fig. 39.)\r\nThe male of another kind of grouse (Tetrao urophasianus), whilst\r\ncourting the female, has his “bare yellow oesophagus inflated to a\r\nprodigious size, fully half as large as the body”; and he then utters\r\nvarious grating, deep, hollow tones. With his neck-feathers erect, his\r\nwings lowered, and buzzing on the ground, and his long pointed tail\r\nspread out like a fan, he displays a variety of grotesque attitudes.\r\nThe oesophagus of the female is not in any way remarkable. (42.\r\nRichardson, ‘Fauna Bor. Americana: Birds,’ 1831, p. 359. Audubon, ibid.\r\nvol. iv. p. 507.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 40. The Umbrella-bird or Cephalopterus ornatus, male (from\r\nBrehm).]\r\n\r\nIt seems now well made out that the great throat pouch of the European\r\nmale bustard (Otis tarda), and of at least four other species, does\r\nnot, as was formerly supposed, serve to hold water, but is connected\r\nwith the utterance during the breeding-season of a peculiar sound\r\nresembling “oak.” (43. The following papers have been lately written on\r\nthis subject: Prof. A. Newton, in the ‘Ibis,’ 1862, p. 107; Dr. Cullen,\r\nibid. 1865, p. 145; Mr. Flower, in ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1865, p. 747; and\r\nDr. Murie, in ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1868, p. 471. In this latter paper an\r\nexcellent figure is given of the male Australian Bustard in full\r\ndisplay with the sack distended. It is a singular fact that the sack is\r\nnot developed in all the males of the same species.) A crow-like bird\r\ninhabiting South America (see Cephalopterus ornatus, Fig. 40) is called\r\nthe umbrella-bird, from its immense top knot, formed of bare white\r\nquills surmounted by dark-blue plumes, which it can elevate into a\r\ngreat dome no less than five inches in diameter, covering the whole\r\nhead. This bird has on its neck a long, thin, cylindrical fleshy\r\nappendage, which is thickly clothed with scale-like blue feathers. It\r\nprobably serves in part as an ornament, but likewise as a resounding\r\napparatus; for Mr. Bates found that it is connected “with an unusual\r\ndevelopment of the trachea and vocal organs.” It is dilated when the\r\nbird utters its singularly deep, loud and long sustained fluty note.\r\nThe head-crest and neck-appendage are rudimentary in the female. (44.\r\nBates, ‘The Naturalist on the Amazons,’ 1863, vol. ii. p. 284; Wallace,\r\nin ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1850, p. 206. A new species, with\r\na still larger neck-appendage (C. penduliger), has lately been\r\ndiscovered, see ‘Ibis,’ vol. i. p. 457.)\r\n\r\nThe vocal organs of various web-footed and wading birds are\r\nextraordinarily complex, and differ to a certain extent in the two\r\nsexes. In some cases the trachea is convoluted, like a French horn, and\r\nis deeply embedded in the sternum. In the wild swan (Cygnus ferus) it\r\nis more deeply embedded in the adult male than in the adult female or\r\nyoung male. In the male Merganser the enlarged portion of the trachea\r\nis furnished with an additional pair of muscles. (45. Bishop, in Todd’s\r\n‘Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology,’ vol. iv. p. 1499.) In one of\r\nthe ducks, however, namely Anas punctata, the bony enlargement is only\r\na little more developed in the male than in the female. (46. Prof.\r\nNewton, ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1871, p. 651.) But the meaning of these\r\ndifferences in the trachea of the two sexes of the Anatidae is not\r\nunderstood; for the male is not always the more vociferous; thus with\r\nthe common duck, the male hisses, whilst the female utters a loud\r\nquack. (47. The spoonbill (Platalea) has its trachea convoluted into a\r\nfigure of eight, and yet this bird (Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii.\r\np. 763) is mute; but Mr. Blyth informs me that the convolutions are not\r\nconstantly present, so that perhaps they are now tending towards\r\nabortion.) In both sexes of one of the cranes (Grus virgo) the trachea\r\npenetrates the sternum, but presents “certain sexual modifications.” In\r\nthe male of the black stork there is also a well-marked sexual\r\ndifference in the length and curvature of the bronchi. (48. ‘Elements\r\nof Comparative Anatomy,’ by R. Wagner, Eng. translat. 1845, p. 111.\r\nWith respect to the swan, as given above, Yarrell’s ‘History of British\r\nBirds,’ 2nd edition, 1845, vol. iii. p. 193.) Highly important\r\nstructures have, therefore, in these cases been modified according to\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to conjecture whether the many strange cries and\r\nnotes uttered by male birds during the breeding-season serve as a charm\r\nor merely as a call to the female. The soft cooing of the turtle-dove\r\nand of many pigeons, it may be presumed, pleases the female. When the\r\nfemale of the wild turkey utters her call in the morning, the male\r\nanswers by a note which differs from the gobbling noise made, when with\r\nerected feathers, rustling wings and distended wattles, he puffs and\r\nstruts before her. (49. C.L. Bonaparte, quoted in the ‘Naturalist\r\nLibrary: Birds,’ vol. xiv. p. 126.) The spel of the black-cock\r\ncertainly serves as a call to the female, for it has been known to\r\nbring four or five females from a distance to a male under confinement;\r\nbut as the black-cock continues his spel for hours during successive\r\ndays, and in the case of the capercailzie “with an agony of passion,”\r\nwe are led to suppose that the females which are present are thus\r\ncharmed. (50. L. Lloyd, ‘The Game Birds of Sweden,’ etc., 1867, pp. 22,\r\n81.) The voice of the common rook is known to alter during the\r\nbreeding-season, and is therefore in some way sexual. (51. Jenner,\r\n‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1824, p. 20.) But what shall we say about\r\nthe harsh screams of, for instance, some kinds of macaws; have these\r\nbirds as bad taste for musical sounds as they apparently have for\r\ncolour, judging by the inharmonious contrast of their bright yellow and\r\nblue plumage? It is indeed possible that without any advantage being\r\nthus gained, the loud voices of many male birds may be the result of\r\nthe inherited effects of the continued use of their vocal organs when\r\nexcited by the strong passions of love, jealousy and rage; but to this\r\npoint we shall recur when we treat of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet spoken only of the voice, but the males of various birds\r\npractise, during their courtship, what may be called instrumental\r\nmusic. Peacocks and Birds of Paradise rattle their quills together.\r\nTurkey-cocks scrape their wings against the ground, and some kinds of\r\ngrouse thus produce a buzzing sound. Another North American grouse, the\r\nTetrao umbellus, when with his tail erect, his ruffs displayed, “he\r\nshows off his finery to the females, who lie hid in the neighbourhood,”\r\ndrums by rapidly striking his wings together above his back, according\r\nto Mr. R. Haymond, and not, as Audubon thought, by striking them\r\nagainst his sides. The sound thus produced is compared by some to\r\ndistant thunder, and by others to the quick roll of a drum. The female\r\nnever drums, “but flies directly to the place where the male is thus\r\nengaged.” The male of the Kalij-pheasant, in the Himalayas, often makes\r\na singular drumming noise with his wings, not unlike the sound produced\r\nby shaking a stiff piece of cloth.” On the west coast of Africa the\r\nlittle black-weavers (Ploceus?) congregate in a small party on the\r\nbushes round a small open space, and sing and glide through the air\r\nwith quivering wings, “which make a rapid whirring sound like a child’s\r\nrattle.” One bird after another thus performs for hours together, but\r\nonly during the courting-season. At this season, and at no other time,\r\nthe males of certain night-jars (Caprimulgus) make a strange booming\r\nnoise with their wings. The various species of woodpeckers strike a\r\nsonorous branch with their beaks, with so rapid a vibratory movement\r\nthat “the head appears to be in two places at once.” The sound thus\r\nproduced is audible at a considerable distance but cannot be described;\r\nand I feel sure that its source would never be conjectured by any one\r\nhearing it for the first time. As this jarring sound is made chiefly\r\nduring the breeding-season, it has been considered as a love-song; but\r\nit is perhaps more strictly a love-call. The female, when driven from\r\nher nest, has been observed thus to call her mate, who answered in the\r\nsame manner and soon appeared. Lastly, the male hoopoe (Upupa epops)\r\ncombines vocal and instrumental music; for during the breeding-season\r\nthis bird, as Mr. Swinhoe observed, first draws in air, and then taps\r\nthe end of its beak perpendicularly down against a stone or the trunk\r\nof a tree, “when the breath being forced down the tubular bill produces\r\nthe correct sound.” If the beak is not thus struck against some object,\r\nthe sound is quite different. Air is at the same time swallowed, and\r\nthe oesophagus thus becomes much swollen; and this probably acts as a\r\nresonator, not only with the hoopoe, but with pigeons and other birds.\r\n(52.

Zool.\r\nSoc.’ 1858).\r\n\r\nFig. 42. Outer tail-feather of Scolopax frenata.\r\n\r\nFig. 43. Outer tail-feather of Scolopax javensis.]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases sounds are made by the aid of structures already\r\npresent and otherwise necessary; but in the following cases certain\r\nfeathers have been specially modified for the express purpose of\r\nproducing sounds. The drumming, bleating, neighing, or thundering noise\r\n(as expressed by different observers) made by the common snipe\r\n(Scolopax gallinago) must have surprised every one who has ever heard\r\nit. This bird, during the pairing-season, flies to “perhaps a thousand\r\nfeet in height,” and after zig-zagging about for a time descends to the\r\nearth in a curved line, with outspread tail and quivering pinions, and\r\nsurprising velocity. The sound is emitted only during this rapid\r\ndescent. No one was able to explain the cause until M. Meves observed\r\nthat on each side of the tail the outer feathers are peculiarly formed\r\n(Fig. 41), having a stiff sabre-shaped shaft with the oblique barbs of\r\nunusual length, the outer webs being strongly bound together. He found\r\nthat by blowing on these feathers, or by fastening them to a long thin\r\nstick and waving them rapidly through the air, he could reproduce the\r\ndrumming noise made by the living bird. Both sexes are furnished with\r\nthese feathers, but they are generally larger in the male than in the\r\nfemale, and emit a deeper note. In some species, as in S. frenata (Fig.\r\n42), four feathers, and in S. javensis (Fig. 43), no less than eight on\r\neach side of the tail are greatly modified. Different tones are emitted\r\nby the feathers of the different species when waved through the air;\r\nand the Scolopax Wilsonii of the United States makes a switching noise\r\nwhilst descending rapidly to the earth. (53. See M. Meves’ interesting\r\npaper in ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1858, p. 199. For the habits of the snipe,\r\nMacgillivray, ‘History of British Birds,’ vol. iv. p. 371. For the\r\nAmerican snipe, Capt. Blakiston, ‘Ibis,’ vol. v. 1863, p. 131.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 44. Primary wing-feather of a Humming-bird, the Selasphorus\r\nplatycercus (from a sketch by Mr. Salvin). Upper figure, that of male;\r\nlower figure, corresponding feather of female.]\r\n\r\nIn the male of the Chamaepetes unicolor (a large gallinaceous bird of\r\nAmerica), the first primary wing-feather is arched towards the tip and\r\nis much more attenuated than in the female. In an allied bird, the\r\nPenelope nigra, Mr. Salvin observed a male, which, whilst it flew\r\ndownwards “with outstretched wings, gave forth a kind of crashing\r\nrushing noise,” like the falling of a tree. (54. Mr. Salvin, in\r\n‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1867, p. 160. I am much indebted to\r\nthis distinguished ornithologist for sketches of the feathers of the\r\nChamaepetes, and for other information.) The male alone of one of the\r\nIndian bustards (Sypheotides auritus) has its primary wing-feathers\r\ngreatly acuminated; and the male of an allied species is known to make\r\na humming noise whilst courting the female. (55. Jerdon, ‘Birds of\r\nIndia,’ vol. iii. pp. 618, 621.) In a widely different group of birds,\r\nnamely Humming-birds, the males alone of certain kinds have either the\r\nshafts of their primary wing-feathers broadly dilated, or the webs\r\nabruptly excised towards the extremity. The male, for instance, of\r\nSelasphorus platycercus, when adult, has the first primary wing-feather\r\n(Fig. 44), thus excised. Whilst flying from flower to flower he makes\r\n“a shrill, almost whistling noise” (56. Gould, ‘Introduction to the\r\nTrochilidae,’ 1861, p. 49. Salvin, ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’\r\n1867, p. 160.); but it did not appear to Mr. Salvin that the noise was\r\nintentionally made.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 45. Secondary wing-feathers of Pipra deliciosa (from Mr. Sclater,\r\nin ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1860). The three upper feathers, a, b, c, from\r\nthe male; the three lower corresponding feathers, d, e, f, from the\r\nfemale. a and d, fifth secondary wing-feather of male and female, upper\r\nsurface. b and e, sixth secondary, upper surface. c and f, seventh\r\nsecondary, lower surface.]\r\n\r\nLastly, in several species of a sub-genus of Pipra or Manakin, the\r\nmales, as described by Mr. Sclater, have their SECONDARY wing-feathers\r\nmodified in a still more remarkable manner. In the brilliantly-coloured\r\nP. deliciosa the first three secondaries are thick-stemmed and curved\r\ntowards the body; in the fourth and fifth (Fig. 45, a) the change is\r\ngreater; and in the sixth and seventh (b, c) the shaft “is thickened to\r\nan extraordinary degree, forming a solid horny lump.” The barbs also\r\nare greatly changed in shape, in comparison with the corresponding\r\nfeathers (d, e, f) in the female. Even the bones of the wing, which\r\nsupport these singular feathers in the male, are said by Mr. Fraser to\r\nbe much thickened. These little birds make an extraordinary noise, the\r\nfirst “sharp note being not unlike the crack of a whip.” (57. Sclater,\r\nin ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1860, p. 90, and in ‘Ibis,’ vol.\r\niv. 1862, p. 175. Also Salvin, in ‘Ibis,’ 1860, p. 37.)\r\n\r\nThe diversity of the sounds, both vocal and instrumental, made by the\r\nmales of many birds during the breeding-season, and the diversity of\r\nthe means for producing such sounds, are highly remarkable. We thus\r\ngain a high idea of their importance for sexual purposes, and are\r\nreminded of the conclusion arrived at as to insects. It is not\r\ndifficult to imagine the steps by which the notes of a bird, primarily\r\nused as a mere call or for some other purpose, might have been improved\r\ninto a melodious love song. In the case of the modified feathers, by\r\nwhich the drumming, whistling, or roaring noises are produced, we know\r\nthat some birds during their courtship flutter, shake, or rattle their\r\nunmodified feathers together; and if the females were led to select the\r\nbest performers, the males which possessed the strongest or thickest,\r\nor most attenuated feathers, situated on any part of the body, would be\r\nthe most successful; and thus by slow degrees the feathers might be\r\nmodified to almost any extent. The females, of course, would not notice\r\neach slight successive alteration in shape, but only the sounds thus\r\nproduced. It is a curious fact that in the same class of animals,\r\nsounds so different as the drumming of the snipe’s tail, the tapping of\r\nthe woodpecker’s beak, the harsh trumpet-like cry of certain\r\nwater-fowl, the cooing of the turtle-dove, and the song of the\r\nnightingale, should all be pleasing to the females of the several\r\nspecies. But we must not judge of the tastes of distinct species by a\r\nuniform standard; nor must we judge by the standard of man’s taste.\r\nEven with man, we should remember what discordant noises, the beating\r\nof tom-toms and the shrill notes of reeds, please the ears of savages.\r\nSir S. Baker remarks (58. ‘The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia,’ 1867, p.\r\n203.), that “as the stomach of the Arab prefers the raw meat and\r\nreeking liver taken hot from the animal, so does his ear prefer his\r\nequally coarse and discordant music to all other.”\r\n\r\nLOVE ANTICS AND DANCES.\r\n\r\nThe curious love gestures of some birds have already been incidentally\r\nnoticed; so that little need here be added. In Northern America large\r\nnumbers of a grouse, the Tetrao phasianellus, meet every morning during\r\nthe breeding-season on a selected level spot, and here they run round\r\nand round in a circle of about fifteen or twenty feet in diameter, so\r\nthat the ground is worn quite bare, like a fairy-ring. In these\r\nPartridge-dances, as they are called by the hunters, the birds assume\r\nthe strangest attitudes, and run round, some to the left and some to\r\nthe right. Audubon describes the males of a heron (Ardea herodias) as\r\nwalking about on their long legs with great dignity before the females,\r\nbidding defiance to their rivals. With one of the disgusting\r\ncarrion-vultures (Cathartes jota) the same naturalist states that “the\r\ngesticulations and parade of the males at the beginning of the\r\nlove-season are extremely ludicrous.” Certain birds perform their\r\nlove-antics on the wing, as we have seen with the black African weaver,\r\ninstead of on the ground. During the spring our little white-throat\r\n(Sylvia cinerea) often rises a few feet or yards in the air above some\r\nbush, and “flutters with a fitful and fantastic motion, singing all the\r\nwhile, and then drops to its perch.” The great English bustard throws\r\nhimself into indescribably odd attitudes whilst courting the female, as\r\nhas been figured by Wolf. An allied Indian bustard (Otis bengalensis)\r\nat such times “rises perpendicularly into the air with a hurried\r\nflapping of his wings, raising his crest and puffing out the feathers\r\nof his neck and breast, and then drops to the ground;” he repeats this\r\nmanoeuvre several times, at the same time humming in a peculiar tone.\r\nSuch females as happen to be near “obey this saltatory summons,” and\r\nwhen they approach he trails his wings and spreads his tail like a\r\nturkey-cock.

Bower-bird, Chlamydera maculata, with bower (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nBut the most curious case is afforded by three allied genera of\r\nAustralian birds, the famous Bower-birds,—no doubt the co-descendants\r\nof some ancient species which first acquired the strange instinct of\r\nconstructing bowers for performing their love-antics. The bowers (Fig.\r\n46), which, as we shall hereafter see, are decorated with feathers,\r\nshells, bones, and leaves, are built on the ground for the sole purpose\r\nof courtship, for their nests are formed in trees. Both sexes assist in\r\nthe erection of the bowers, but the male is the principal workman. So\r\nstrong is this instinct that it is practised under confinement, and Mr.\r\nStrange has described (60. Gould, ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’\r\nvol. i. pp. 444, 449, 455. The bower of the Satin Bower-bird may be\r\nseen in the Zoological Society’s Gardens, Regent’s Park.) the habits of\r\nsome Satin Bower-birds which he kept in an aviary in New South Wales.\r\n“At times the male will chase the female all over the aviary, then go\r\nto the bower, pick up a gay feather or a large leaf, utter a curious\r\nkind of note, set all his feathers erect, run round the bower and\r\nbecome so excited that his eyes appear ready to start from his head; he\r\ncontinues opening first one wing then the other, uttering a low,\r\nwhistling note, and, like the domestic cock, seems to be picking up\r\nsomething from the ground, until at last the female goes gently towards\r\nhim.” Captain Stokes has described the habits and “play-houses” of\r\nanother species, the Great Bower-bird, which was seen “amusing itself\r\nby flying backwards and forwards, taking a shell alternately from each\r\nside, and carrying it through the archway in its mouth.” These curious\r\nstructures, formed solely as halls of assemblage, where both sexes\r\namuse themselves and pay their court, must cost the birds much labour.\r\nThe bower, for instance, of the Fawn-breasted species, is nearly four\r\nfeet in length, eighteen inches in height, and is raised on a thick\r\nplatform of sticks.\r\n\r\nDECORATION.\r\n\r\nI will first discuss the cases in which the males are ornamented either\r\nexclusively or in a much higher degree than the females, and in a\r\nsucceeding chapter those in which both sexes are equally ornamented,\r\nand finally the rare cases in which the female is somewhat more\r\nbrightly-coloured than the male. As with the artificial ornaments used\r\nby savage and civilised men, so with the natural ornaments of birds,\r\nthe head is the chief seat of decoration. (61. See remarks to this\r\neffect, on the ‘Feeling of Beauty among Animals,’ by Mr. J. Shaw, in\r\nthe ‘Athenaeum,’ Nov. 24th, 1866, p. 681.) The ornaments, as mentioned\r\nat the commencement of this chapter, are wonderfully diversified. The\r\nplumes on the front or back of the head consist of variously-shaped\r\nfeathers, sometimes capable of erection or expansion, by which their\r\nbeautiful colours are fully displayed. Elegant ear-tufts (Fig. 39) are\r\noccasionally present. The head is sometimes covered with velvety down,\r\nas with the pheasant; or is naked and vividly coloured. The throat,\r\nalso, is sometimes ornamented with a beard, wattles, or caruncles. Such\r\nappendages are generally brightly-coloured, and no doubt serve as\r\nornaments, though not always ornamental in our eyes; for whilst the\r\nmale is in the act of courting the female, they often swell and assume\r\nvivid tints, as in the male turkey. At such times the fleshy appendages\r\nabout the head of the male Tragopan pheasant (Ceriornis Temminckii)\r\nswell into a large lappet on the throat and into two horns, one on each\r\nside of the splendid top-knot; and these are then coloured of the most\r\nintense blue which I have ever beheld. (62. See Dr. Murie’s account\r\nwith coloured figures in ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1872, p.\r\n730.) The African hornbill (Bucorax abyssinicus) inflates the scarlet\r\nbladder-like wattle on its neck, and with its wings drooping and tail\r\nexpanded “makes quite a grand appearance.” (63. Mr. Monteiro, ‘Ibis,’\r\nvol. iv. 1862, p. 339.) Even the iris of the eye is sometimes more\r\nbrightly-coloured in the male than in the female; and this is\r\nfrequently the case with the beak, for instance, in our common\r\nblackbird. In Buceros corrugatus, the whole beak and immense casque are\r\ncoloured more conspicuously in the male than in the female; and “the\r\noblique grooves upon the sides of the lower mandible are peculiar to\r\nthe male sex.” (64. ‘Land and Water,’ 1868, p. 217.)\r\n\r\nThe head, again, often supports fleshy appendages, filaments, and solid\r\nprotuberances. These, if not common to both sexes, are always confined\r\nto the males. The solid protuberances have been described in detail by\r\nDr. W. Marshall (65. ‘Ueber die Schädelhöcker,’ etc., ‘Niederland.\r\nArchiv. fur Zoologie,’ B. I. Heft 2, 1872.), who shews that they are\r\nformed either of cancellated bone coated with skin, or of dermal and\r\nother tissues. With mammals true horns are always supported on the\r\nfrontal bones, but with birds various bones have been modified for this\r\npurpose; and in species of the same group the protuberances may have\r\ncores of bone, or be quite destitute of them, with intermediate\r\ngradations connecting these two extremes. Hence, as Dr. Marshall justly\r\nremarks, variations of the most different kinds have served for the\r\ndevelopment through sexual selection of these ornamental appendages.\r\nElongated feathers or plumes spring from almost every part of the body.\r\nThe feathers on the throat and breast are sometimes developed into\r\nbeautiful ruffs and collars. The tail-feathers are frequently increased\r\nin length; as we see in the tail-coverts of the peacock, and in the\r\ntail itself of the Argus pheasant. With the peacock even the bones of\r\nthe tail have been modified to support the heavy tail-coverts. (66. Dr.\r\nW. Marshall, ‘Über den Vogelschwanz,’ ibid. B. I. Heft 2, 1872.) The\r\nbody of the Argus is not larger than that of a fowl; yet the length\r\nfrom the end of the beak to the extremity of the tail is no less than\r\nfive feet three inches (67. Jardine’s ‘Naturalist Library: Birds,’ vol.\r\nxiv. p. 166.), and that of the beautifully ocellated secondary\r\nwing-feathers nearly three feet. In a small African night-jar\r\n(Cosmetornis vexillarius) one of the primary wing-feathers, during the\r\nbreeding-season, attains a length of twenty-six inches, whilst the bird\r\nitself is only ten inches in length. In another closely-allied genus of\r\nnight-jars, the shafts of the elongated wing-feathers are naked, except\r\nat the extremity, where there is a disc. (68. Sclater, in the ‘Ibis,’\r\nvol. vi. 1864, p. 114; Livingstone, ‘Expedition to the Zambesi,’ 1865,\r\np. 66.) Again, in another genus of night-jars, the tail-feathers are\r\neven still more prodigiously developed. In general the feathers of the\r\ntail are more often elongated than those of the wings, as any great\r\nelongation of the latter impedes flight. We thus see that in\r\nclosely-allied birds ornaments of the same kind have been gained by the\r\nmales through the development of widely different feathers.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the feathers of species belonging to very\r\ndistinct groups have been modified in almost exactly the same peculiar\r\nmanner. Thus the wing-feathers in one of the above-mentioned night-jars\r\nare bare along the shaft, and terminate in a disc; or are, as they are\r\nsometimes called, spoon or racket-shaped. Feathers of this kind occur\r\nin the tail of a motmot (Eumomota superciliaris), of a king-fisher,\r\nfinch, humming-bird, parrot, several Indian drongos (Dicrurus and\r\nEdolius, in one of which the disc stands vertically), and in the tail\r\nof certain birds of paradise. In these latter birds, similar feathers,\r\nbeautifully ocellated, ornament the head, as is likewise the case with\r\nsome gallinaceous birds. In an Indian bustard (Sypheotides auritus) the\r\nfeathers forming the ear-tufts, which are about four inches in length,\r\nalso terminate in discs. (69. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p.\r\n620.) It is a most singular fact that the motmots, as Mr. Salvin has\r\nclearly shewn (70. ‘Proceedings, Zoological Society,’ 1873, p. 429.),\r\ngive to their tail feathers the racket-shape by biting off the barbs,\r\nand, further, that this continued mutilation has produced a certain\r\namount of inherited effect.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 47. Paradisea Papuana (T.W. Wood).]\r\n\r\nAgain, the barbs of the feathers in various widely-distinct birds are\r\nfilamentous or plumose, as with some herons, ibises, birds of paradise,\r\nand Gallinaceae. In other cases the barbs disappear, leaving the shafts\r\nbare from end to end; and these in the tail of the Paradisea apoda\r\nattain a length of thirty-four inches (71. Wallace, in ‘Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History,’ vol. xx. 1857, p. 416, and in his ‘Malay\r\nArchipelago,’ vol. ii. 1869, p. 390.): in P. Papuana (Fig. 47) they are\r\nmuch shorter and thin. Smaller feathers when thus denuded appear like\r\nbristles, as on the breast of the turkey-cock. As any fleeting fashion\r\nin dress comes to be admired by man, so with birds a change of almost\r\nany kind in the structure or colouring of the feathers in the male\r\nappears to have been admired by the female. The fact of the feathers in\r\nwidely distinct groups having been modified in an analogous manner no\r\ndoubt depends primarily on all the feathers having nearly the same\r\nstructure and manner of development, and consequently tending to vary\r\nin the same manner. We often see a tendency to analogous variability in\r\nthe plumage of our domestic breeds belonging to distinct species. Thus\r\ntop-knots have appeared in several species. In an extinct variety of\r\nthe turkey, the top-knot consisted of bare quills surmounted with\r\nplumes of down, so that they somewhat resembled the racket-shaped\r\nfeathers above described. In certain breeds of the pigeon and fowl the\r\nfeathers are plumose, with some tendency in the shafts to be naked. In\r\nthe Sebastopol goose the scapular feathers are greatly elongated,\r\ncurled, or even spirally twisted, with the margins plumose. (72. See my\r\nwork on ‘The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol.\r\ni. pp. 289, 293.)\r\n\r\nIn regard to colour, hardly anything need here be said, for every one\r\nknows how splendid are the tints of many birds, and how harmoniously\r\nthey are combined. The colours are often metallic and iridescent.\r\nCircular spots are sometimes surrounded by one or more differently\r\nshaded zones, and are thus converted into ocelli. Nor need much be said\r\non the wonderful difference between the sexes of many birds. The common\r\npeacock offers a striking instance. Female birds of paradise are\r\nobscurely coloured and destitute of all ornaments, whilst the males are\r\nprobably the most highly decorated of all birds, and in so many\r\ndifferent ways that they must be seen to be appreciated. The elongated\r\nand golden-orange plumes which spring from beneath the wings of the\r\nParadisea apoda, when vertically erected and made to vibrate, are\r\ndescribed as forming a sort of halo, in the centre of which the head\r\n“looks like a little emerald sun with its rays formed by the two\r\nplumes.” (73. Quoted from M. de Lafresnaye in ‘Annals and Mag. of\r\nNatural History,’ vol. xiii. 1854, p. 157: see also Mr. Wallace’s much\r\nfuller account in vol. xx. 1857, p. 412, and in his ‘Malay\r\nArchipelago.’) In another most beautiful species the head is bald, “and\r\nof a rich cobalt blue, crossed by several lines of black velvety\r\nfeathers.” (74. Wallace, ‘The Malay Archipelago,’ vol. ii. 1869, p.\r\n405.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 48. Lophornis ornatus, male and female (from Brehm).\r\n\r\nFig. 49. Spathura underwoodi, male and female (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nMale humming-birds (Figs. 48 and 49) almost vie with birds of paradise\r\nin their beauty, as every one will admit who has seen Mr. Gould’s\r\nsplendid volumes, or his rich collection. It is very remarkable in how\r\nmany different ways these birds are ornamented. Almost every part of\r\ntheir plumage has been taken advantage of, and modified; and the\r\nmodifications have been carried, as Mr. Gould shewed me, to a wonderful\r\nextreme in some species belonging to nearly every sub-group. Such cases\r\nare curiously like those which we see in our fancy breeds, reared by\r\nman for the sake of ornament; certain individuals originally varied in\r\none character, and other individuals of the same species in other\r\ncharacters; and these have been seized on by man and much augmented—as\r\nshewn by the tail of the fantail-pigeon, the hood of the jacobin, the\r\nbeak and wattle of the carrier, and so forth. The sole difference\r\nbetween these cases is that in the one, the result is due to man’s\r\nselection, whilst in the other, as with humming-birds, birds of\r\nparadise, etc., it is due to the selection by the females of the more\r\nbeautiful males.\r\n\r\nI will mention only one other bird, remarkable from the extreme\r\ncontrast in colour between the sexes, namely the famous bell-bird\r\n(Chasmorhynchus niveus) of S. America, the note of which can be\r\ndistinguished at the distance of nearly three miles, and astonishes\r\nevery one when first hearing it. The male is pure white, whilst the\r\nfemale is dusky-green; and white is a very rare colour in terrestrial\r\nspecies of moderate size and inoffensive habits. The male, also, as\r\ndescribed by Waterton, has a spiral tube, nearly three inches in\r\nlength, which rises from the base of the beak. It is jet-black, dotted\r\nover with minute downy feathers. This tube can be inflated with air,\r\nthrough a communication with the palate; and when not inflated hangs\r\ndown on one side. The genus consists of four species, the males of\r\nwhich are very distinct, whilst the females, as described by Mr.\r\nSclater in a very interesting paper, closely resemble each other, thus\r\noffering an excellent instance of the common rule that within the same\r\ngroup the males differ much more from each other than do the females.\r\nIn a second species (C. nudicollis) the male is likewise snow-white,\r\nwith the exception of a large space of naked skin on the throat and\r\nround the eyes, which during the breeding-season is of a fine green\r\ncolour. In a third species (C. tricarunculatus) the head and neck alone\r\nof the male are white, the rest of the body being chestnut-brown, and\r\nthe male of this species is provided with three filamentous projections\r\nhalf as long as the body—one rising from the base of the beak, and the\r\ntwo others from the corners of the mouth. (75. Mr. Sclater,\r\n‘Intellectual Observer,’ Jan. 1867. Waterton’s ‘Wanderings,’ p. 118.\r\nSee also Mr. Salvin’s interesting paper, with a plate, in the ‘Ibis,’\r\n1865, p. 90.)\r\n\r\nThe coloured plumage and certain other ornaments of the adult males are\r\neither retained for life, or are periodically renewed during the summer\r\nand breeding-season. At this same season the beak and naked skin about\r\nthe head frequently change colour, as with some herons, ibises, gulls,\r\none of the bell-birds just noticed, etc. In the white ibis, the cheeks,\r\nthe inflatable skin of the throat, and the basal portion of the beak\r\nthen become crimson. (76. ‘Land and Water,’ 1867, p. 394.) In one of\r\nthe rails, Gallicrex cristatus, a large red caruncle is developed\r\nduring this period on the head of the male. So it is with a thin horny\r\ncrest on the beak of one of the pelicans, P. erythrorhynchus; for,\r\nafter the breeding-season, these horny crests are shed, like horns from\r\nthe heads of stags, and the shore of an island in a lake in Nevada was\r\nfound covered with these curious exuviae. (77. Mr. D.G. Elliot, in\r\n‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1869, p. 589.)\r\n\r\nChanges of colour in the plumage according to the season depend,\r\nfirstly on a double annual moult, secondly on an actual change of\r\ncolour in the feathers themselves, and thirdly on their dull-coloured\r\nmargins being periodically shed, or on these three processes more or\r\nless combined. The shedding of the deciduary margins may be compared\r\nwith the shedding of their down by very young birds; for the down in\r\nmost cases arises from the summits of the first true feathers. (78.\r\nNitzsch’s ‘Pterylography,’ edited by P.L. Sclater, Ray Society, 1867,\r\np. 14.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the birds which annually undergo a double moult, there\r\nare, firstly, some kinds, for instance snipes, swallow-plovers\r\n(Glareolae), and curlews, in which the two sexes resemble each other,\r\nand do not change colour at any season. I do not know whether the\r\nwinter plumage is thicker and warmer than the summer plumage, but\r\nwarmth seems the most probable end attained of a double moult, where\r\nthere is no change of colour. Secondly, there are birds, for instance,\r\ncertain species of Totanus and other Grallatores, the sexes of which\r\nresemble each other, but in which the summer and winter plumage differ\r\nslightly in colour. The difference, however, in these cases is so small\r\nthat it can hardly be an advantage to them; and it may, perhaps, be\r\nattributed to the direct action of the different conditions to which\r\nthe birds are exposed during the two seasons. Thirdly, there are many\r\nother birds the sexes of which are alike, but which are widely\r\ndifferent in their summer and winter plumage. Fourthly, there are birds\r\nthe sexes of which differ from each other in colour; but the females,\r\nthough moulting twice, retain the same colours throughout the year,\r\nwhilst the males undergo a change of colour, sometimes a great one, as\r\nwith certain bustards. Fifthly and lastly, there are birds the sexes of\r\nwhich differ from each other in both their summer and winter plumage;\r\nbut the male undergoes a greater amount of change at each recurrent\r\nseason than the female—of which the ruff (Machetes pugnax) offers a\r\ngood instance.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the cause or purpose of the differences in colour\r\nbetween the summer and winter plumage, this may in some instances, as\r\nwith the ptarmigan (79. The brown mottled summer plumage of the\r\nptarmigan is of as much importance to it, as a protection, as the white\r\nwinter plumage; for in Scandinavia during the spring, when the snow has\r\ndisappeared, this bird is known to suffer greatly from birds of prey,\r\nbefore it has acquired its summer dress: see Wilhelm von Wright, in\r\nLloyd, ‘Game Birds of Sweden,’ 1867, p. 125.), serve during both\r\nseasons as a protection. When the difference between the two plumages\r\nis slight it may perhaps be attributed, as already remarked, to the\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life. But with many birds there can\r\nhardly be a doubt that the summer plumage is ornamental, even when both\r\nsexes are alike. We may conclude that this is the case with many\r\nherons, egrets, etc., for they acquire their beautiful plumes only\r\nduring the breeding-season. Moreover, such plumes, top-knots, etc.,\r\nthough possessed by both sexes, are occasionally a little more\r\ndeveloped in the male than in the female; and they resemble the plumes\r\nand ornaments possessed by the males alone of other birds. It is also\r\nknown that confinement, by affecting the reproductive system of male\r\nbirds, frequently checks the development of their secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, but has no immediate influence on any other characters; and\r\nI am informed by Mr. Bartlett that eight or nine specimens of the Knot\r\n(Tringa canutus) retained their unadorned winter plumage in the\r\nZoological Gardens throughout the year, from which fact we may infer\r\nthat the summer plumage, though common to both sexes, partakes of the\r\nnature of the exclusively masculine plumage of many other birds. (80.\r\nIn regard to the previous statements on moulting, see, on snipes, etc.,\r\nMacgillivray, ‘Hist. Brit. Birds,’ vol. iv. p. 371; on Glareolae,\r\ncurlews, and bustards, Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. pp. 615,\r\n630, 683; on Totanus, ibid. p. 700; on the plumes of herons, ibid. p.\r\n738, and Macgillivray, vol. iv. pp. 435 and 444, and Mr. Stafford\r\nAllen, in the ‘Ibis,’ vol. v. 1863, p. 33.)\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts, more especially from neither sex of certain\r\nbirds changing colour during either annual moult, or changing so\r\nslightly that the change can hardly be of any service to them, and from\r\nthe females of other species moulting twice yet retaining the same\r\ncolours throughout the year, we may conclude that the habit of annually\r\nmoulting twice has not been acquired in order that the male should\r\nassume an ornamental character during the breeding-season; but that the\r\ndouble moult, having been originally acquired for some distinct\r\npurpose, has subsequently been taken advantage of in certain cases for\r\ngaining a nuptial plumage.\r\n\r\nIt appears at first sight a surprising circumstance that some\r\nclosely-allied species should regularly undergo a double annual moult,\r\nand others only a single one. The ptarmigan, for instance, moults twice\r\nor even thrice in the year, and the blackcock only once: some of the\r\nsplendidly coloured honey-suckers (Nectariniae) of India and some\r\nsub-genera of obscurely coloured pipits (Anthus) have a double, whilst\r\nothers have only a single annual moult. (81. On the moulting of the\r\nptarmigan, see Gould’s ‘Birds of Great Britain.’ On the honey-suckers,\r\nJerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. pp. 359, 365, 369. On the moulting of\r\nAnthus, see Blyth, in ‘Ibis,’ 1867, p. 32.) But the gradations in the\r\nmanner of moulting, which are known to occur with various birds, shew\r\nus how species, or whole groups, might have originally acquired their\r\ndouble annual moult, or having once gained the habit, have again lost\r\nit. With certain bustards and plovers the vernal moult is far from\r\ncomplete, some feathers being renewed, and some changed in colour.\r\nThere is also reason to believe that with certain bustards and\r\nrail-like birds, which properly undergo a double moult, some of the\r\nolder males retain their nuptial plumage throughout the year. A few\r\nhighly modified feathers may merely be added during the spring to the\r\nplumage, as occurs with the disc-formed tail-feathers of certain\r\ndrongos (Bhringa) in India, and with the elongated feathers on the\r\nback, neck, and crest of certain herons. By such steps as these, the\r\nvernal moult might be rendered more and more complete, until a perfect\r\ndouble moult was acquired. Some of the birds of paradise retain their\r\nnuptial feathers throughout the year, and thus have only a single\r\nmoult; others cast them directly after the breeding-season, and thus\r\nhave a double moult; and others again cast them at this season during\r\nthe first year, but not afterwards; so that these latter species are\r\nintermediate in their manner of moulting. There is also a great\r\ndifference with many birds in the length of time during which the two\r\nannual plumages are retained; so that the one might come to be retained\r\nfor the whole year, and the other completely lost. Thus in the spring\r\nMachetes pugnax retains his ruff for barely two months. In Natal the\r\nmale widow-bird (Chera progne) acquires his fine plumage and long\r\ntail-feathers in December or January, and loses them in March; so that\r\nthey are retained only for about three months. Most species, which\r\nundergo a double moult, keep their ornamental feathers for about six\r\nmonths. The male, however, of the wild Gallus bankiva retains his\r\nneck-hackles for nine or ten months; and when these are cast off, the\r\nunderlying black feathers on the neck are fully exposed to view. But\r\nwith the domesticated descendant of this species, the neck-hackles of\r\nthe male are immediately replaced by new ones; so that we here see, as\r\nto part of the plumage, a double moult changed under domestication into\r\na single moult.

The male pin-tail duck (Anas\r\nacuta) loses his plumage for the shorter period of six weeks or two\r\nmonths; and Montagu remarks that “this double moult within so short a\r\ntime is a most extraordinary circumstance, that seems to bid defiance\r\nto all human reasoning.” But the believer in the gradual modification\r\nof species will be far from feeling surprise at finding gradations of\r\nall kinds. If the male pin-tail were to acquire his new plumage within\r\na still shorter period, the new male feathers would almost necessarily\r\nbe mingled with the old, and both with some proper to the female; and\r\nthis apparently is the case with the male of a not distantly-allied\r\nbird, namely the Merganser serrator, for the males are said to “undergo\r\na change of plumage, which assimilates them in some measure to the\r\nfemale.” By a little further acceleration in the process, the double\r\nmoult would be completely lost. (83. See Macgillivray, ‘Hist. British\r\nBirds’ (vol. v. pp. 34, 70, and 223), on the moulting of the Anatidae,\r\nwith quotations from Waterton and Montagu. Also Yarrell, ‘History of\r\nBritish Birds,’ vol. iii. p. 243.)\r\n\r\nSome male birds, as before stated, become more brightly coloured in the\r\nspring, not by a vernal moult, but either by an actual change of colour\r\nin the feathers, or by their obscurely-coloured deciduary margins being\r\nshed. Changes of colour thus caused may last for a longer or shorter\r\ntime. In the Pelecanus onocrotalus a beautiful rosy tint, with\r\nlemon-coloured marks on the breast, overspreads the whole plumage in\r\nthe spring; but these tints, as Mr. Sclater states, “do not last long,\r\ndisappearing generally in about six weeks or two months after they have\r\nbeen attained.” Certain finches shed the margins of their feathers in\r\nthe spring, and then become brighter coloured, while other finches\r\nundergo no such change. Thus the Fringilla tristis of the United States\r\n(as well as many other American species) exhibits its bright colours\r\nonly when the winter is past, whilst our goldfinch, which exactly\r\nrepresents this bird in habits, and our siskin, which represents it\r\nstill more closely in structure, undergo no such annual change. But a\r\ndifference of this kind in the plumage of allied species is not\r\nsurprising, for with the common linnet, which belongs to the same\r\nfamily, the crimson forehead and breast are displayed only during the\r\nsummer in England, whilst in Madeira these colours are retained\r\nthroughout the year. (84. On the pelican, see Sclater, in ‘Proc. Zool.\r\nSoc.’ 1868, p. 265. On the American finches, see Audubon,\r\n‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. i. pp. 174, 221, and Jerdon, ‘Birds of\r\nIndia,’ vol. ii. p. 383.

But the males will sometimes display\r\ntheir ornaments, when not in the presence of the females, as\r\noccasionally occurs with grouse at their balz-places, and as may be\r\nnoticed with the peacock; this latter bird, however, evidently wishes\r\nfor a spectator of some kind, and, as I have often seen, will shew off\r\nhis finery before poultry, or even pigs. (85. See also ‘Ornamental\r\nPoultry,’ by Rev. E.S. Dixon, 1848, p. 8.) All naturalists who have\r\nclosely attended to the habits of birds, whether in a state of nature\r\nor under confinement, are unanimously of opinion that the males take\r\ndelight in displaying their beauty. Audubon frequently speaks of the\r\nmale as endeavouring in various ways to charm the female. Mr. Gould,\r\nafter describing some peculiarities in a male humming-bird, says he has\r\nno doubt that it has the power of displaying them to the greatest\r\nadvantage before the female. Dr. Jerdon (86. ‘Birds of India,’\r\nintroduct., vol. i. p. xxiv.; on the peacock, vol. iii. p. 507. See\r\nGould’s ‘Introduction to Trochilidae,’ 1861, pp. 15 and 111.) insists\r\nthat the beautiful plumage of the male serves “to fascinate and attract\r\nthe female.” Mr. Bartlett, at the Zoological Gardens, expressed himself\r\nto me in the strongest terms to the same effect.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 50. Rupicola crocea, male (T.W. Wood).]\r\n\r\nIt must be a grand sight in the forests of India “to come suddenly on\r\ntwenty or thirty pea-fowl, the males displaying their gorgeous trains,\r\nand strutting about in all the pomp of pride before the gratified\r\nfemales.” The wild turkey-cock erects his glittering plumage, expands\r\nhis finely-zoned tail and barred wing-feathers, and altogether, with\r\nhis crimson and blue wattles, makes a superb, though, to our eyes,\r\ngrotesque appearance. Similar facts have already been given with\r\nrespect to grouse of various kinds. Turning to another Order: The male\r\nRupicola crocea (Fig. 50) is one of the most beautiful birds in the\r\nworld, being of a splendid orange, with some of the feathers curiously\r\ntruncated and plumose. The female is brownish-green, shaded with red,\r\nand has a much smaller crest. Sir R. Schomburgk has described their\r\ncourtship; he found one of their meeting-places where ten males and two\r\nfemales were present. The space was from four to five feet in diameter,\r\nand appeared to have been cleared of every blade of grass and smoothed\r\nas if by human hands. A male “was capering, to the apparent delight of\r\nseveral others. Now spreading its wings, throwing up its head, or\r\nopening its tail like a fan; now strutting about with a hopping gait\r\nuntil tired, when it gabbled some kind of note, and was relieved by\r\nanother. Thus three of them successively took the field, and then, with\r\nself-approbation, withdrew to rest.” The Indians, in order to obtain\r\ntheir skins, wait at one of the meeting-places till the birds are\r\neagerly engaged in dancing, and then are able to kill with their\r\npoisoned arrows four or five males, one after the other. (87. ‘Journal\r\nof R. Geograph. Soc.’ vol. x. 1840, p. 236.) With birds of paradise a\r\ndozen or more full-plumaged males congregate in a tree to hold a\r\ndancing-party, as it is called by the natives: and here they fly about,\r\nraise their wings, elevate their exquisite plumes, and make them\r\nvibrate, and the whole tree seems, as Mr. Wallace remarks, to be filled\r\nwith waving plumes. When thus engaged, they become so absorbed that a\r\nskilful archer may shoot nearly the whole party. These birds, when kept\r\nin confinement in the Malay Archipelago, are said to take much care in\r\nkeeping their feathers clean; often spreading them out, examining them,\r\nand removing every speck of dirt. One observer, who kept several pairs\r\nalive, did not doubt that the display of the male was intended to\r\nplease the female. (88. ‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. xiii.\r\n1854, p. 157; also Wallace, ibid. vol. xx. 1857, p. 412, and ‘The Malay\r\nArchipelago,’ vol. ii. 1869, p. 252. Also Dr. Bennett, as quoted by\r\nBrehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. iii. s. 326.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 51. Polyplectron chinquis, male (T.W. Wood).]\r\n\r\nThe Gold and Amherst pheasants during their courtship not only expand\r\nand raise their splendid frills, but twist them, as I have myself seen,\r\nobliquely towards the female on whichever side she may be standing,\r\nobviously in order that a large surface may be displayed before her.\r\n(89. Mr. T.W. Wood has given (‘The Student,’ April 1870, p. 115) a full\r\naccount of this manner of display, by the Gold pheasant and by the\r\nJapanese pheasant, Ph. versicolor; and he calls it the lateral or\r\none-sided display.) They likewise turn their beautiful tails and\r\ntail-coverts a little towards the same side. Mr. Bartlett has observed\r\na male Polyplectron (Fig. 51) in the act of courtship, and has shewn me\r\na specimen stuffed in the attitude then assumed. The tail and\r\nwing-feathers of this bird are ornamented with beautiful ocelli, like\r\nthose on the peacock’s train. Now when the peacock displays himself, he\r\nexpands and erects his tail transversely to his body, for he stands in\r\nfront of the female, and has to shew off, at the same time, his rich\r\nblue throat and breast. But the breast of the Polyplectron is obscurely\r\ncoloured, and the ocelli are not confined to the tail-feathers.\r\nConsequently the Polyplectron does not stand in front of the female;\r\nbut he erects and expands his tail-feathers a little obliquely,\r\nlowering the expanded wing on the same side, and raising that on the\r\nopposite side. In this attitude the ocelli over the whole body are\r\nexposed at the same time before the eyes of the admiring female in one\r\ngrand bespangled expanse. To whichever side she may turn, the expanded\r\nwings and the obliquely-held tail are turned towards her. The male\r\nTragopan pheasant acts in nearly the same manner, for he raises the\r\nfeathers of the body, though not the wing itself, on the side which is\r\nopposite to the female, and which would otherwise be concealed, so that\r\nnearly all the beautifully spotted feathers are exhibited at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 52. Side view of male Argus pheasant, whilst displaying before\r\nthe female. Observed and sketched from nature by T.W. Wood.]\r\n\r\nThe Argus pheasant affords a much more remarkable case. The immensely\r\ndeveloped secondary wing-feathers are confined to the male; and each is\r\nornamented with a row of from twenty to twenty-three ocelli, above an\r\ninch in diameter. These feathers are also elegantly marked with oblique\r\nstripes and rows of spots of a dark colour, like those on the skin of a\r\ntiger and leopard combined. These beautiful ornaments are hidden until\r\nthe male shows himself off before the female. He then erects his tail,\r\nand expands his wing-feathers into a great, almost upright, circular\r\nfan or shield, which is carried in front of the body. The neck and head\r\nare held on one side, so that they are concealed by the fan; but the\r\nbird in order to see the female, before whom he is displaying himself,\r\nsometimes pushes his head between two of the long wing-feathers (as Mr.\r\nBartlett has seen), and then presents a grotesque appearance. This must\r\nbe a frequent habit with the bird in a state of nature, for Mr.\r\nBartlett and his son on examining some perfect skins sent from the\r\nEast, found a place between two of the feathers which was much frayed,\r\nas if the head had here frequently been pushed through. Mr. Wood thinks\r\nthat the male can also peep at the female on one side, beyond the\r\nmargin of the fan.\r\n\r\nThe ocelli on the wing-feathers are wonderful objects; for they are so\r\nshaded that, as the Duke of Argyll remarks (90. ‘The Reign of Law,’\r\n1867, p. 203.), they stand out like balls lying loosely within sockets.\r\nWhen I looked at the specimen in the British Museum, which is mounted\r\nwith the wings expanded and trailing downwards, I was however greatly\r\ndisappointed, for the ocelli appeared flat, or even concave. But Mr.\r\nGould soon made the case clear to me, for he held the feathers erect,\r\nin the position in which they would naturally be displayed, and now,\r\nfrom the light shining on them from above, each ocellus at once\r\nresembled the ornament called a ball and socket. These feathers have\r\nbeen shown to several artists, and all have expressed their admiration\r\nat the perfect shading. It may well be asked, could such artistically\r\nshaded ornaments have been formed by means of sexual selection? But it\r\nwill be convenient to defer giving an answer to this question until we\r\ntreat in the next chapter of the principle of gradation.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks relate to the secondary wing-feathers, but the\r\nprimary wing-feathers, which in most gallinaceous birds are uniformly\r\ncoloured, are in the Argus pheasant equally wonderful. They are of a\r\nsoft brown tint with numerous dark spots, each of which consists of two\r\nor three black dots with a surrounding dark zone. But the chief\r\nornament is a space parallel to the dark-blue shaft, which in outline\r\nforms a perfect second feather lying within the true feather. This\r\ninner part is coloured of a lighter chestnut, and is thickly dotted\r\nwith minute white points. I have shewn this feather to several persons,\r\nand many have admired it even more than the ball and socket feathers,\r\nand have declared that it was more like a work of art than of nature.\r\nNow these feathers are quite hidden on all ordinary occasions, but are\r\nfully displayed, together with the long secondary feathers, when they\r\nare all expanded together so as to form the great fan or shield.\r\n\r\nThe case of the male Argus pheasant is eminently interesting, because\r\nit affords good evidence that the most refined beauty may serve as a\r\nsexual charm, and for no other purpose. We must conclude that this is\r\nthe case, as the secondary and primary wing-feathers are not at all\r\ndisplayed, and the ball and socket ornaments are not exhibited in full\r\nperfection until the male assumes the attitude of courtship. The Argus\r\npheasant does not possess brilliant colours, so that his success in\r\nlove appears to depend on the great size of his plumes, and on the\r\nelaboration of the most elegant patterns. Many will declare that it is\r\nutterly incredible that a female bird should be able to appreciate fine\r\nshading and exquisite patterns. It is undoubtedly a marvellous fact\r\nthat she should possess this almost human degree of taste. He who\r\nthinks that he can safely gauge the discrimination and taste of the\r\nlower animals may deny that the female Argus pheasant can appreciate\r\nsuch refined beauty; but he will then be compelled to admit that the\r\nextraordinary attitudes assumed by the male during the act of\r\ncourtship, by which the wonderful beauty of his plumage is fully\r\ndisplayed, are purposeless; and this is a conclusion which I for one\r\nwill never admit.\r\n\r\nAlthough so many pheasants and allied gallinaceous birds carefully\r\ndisplay their plumage before the females, it is remarkable, as Mr.\r\nBartlett informs me, that this is not the case with the dull-coloured\r\nEared and Cheer pheasants (Crossoptilon auritum and Phasianus\r\nwallichii); so that these birds seem conscious that they have little\r\nbeauty to display. Mr. Bartlett has never seen the males of either of\r\nthese species fighting together, though he has not had such good\r\nopportunities for observing the Cheer as the Eared pheasant. Mr. Jenner\r\nWeir, also, finds that all male birds with rich or\r\nstrongly-characterised plumage are more quarrelsome than the\r\ndull-coloured species belonging to the same groups. The goldfinch, for\r\ninstance, is far more pugnacious than the linnet, and the blackbird\r\nthan the thrush. Those birds which undergo a seasonal change of plumage\r\nlikewise become much more pugnacious at the period when they are most\r\ngaily ornamented. No doubt the males of some obscurely-coloured birds\r\nfight desperately together, but it appears that when sexual selection\r\nhas been highly influential, and has given bright colours to the males\r\nof any species, it has also very often given a strong tendency to\r\npugnacity. We shall meet with nearly analogous cases when we treat of\r\nmammals. On the other hand, with birds the power of song and brilliant\r\ncolours have rarely been both acquired by the males of the same\r\nspecies; but in this case the advantage gained would have been the\r\nsame, namely success in charming the female. Nevertheless it must be\r\nowned that the males of several brilliantly coloured birds have had\r\ntheir feathers specially modified for the sake of producing\r\ninstrumental music, though the beauty of this cannot be compared, at\r\nleast according to our taste, with that of the vocal music of many\r\nsongsters.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to male birds which are not ornamented in any high\r\ndegree, but which nevertheless display during their courtship whatever\r\nattractions they may possess. These cases are in some respects more\r\ncurious than the foregoing, and have been but little noticed. I owe the\r\nfollowing facts to Mr. Weir, who has long kept confined birds of many\r\nkinds, including all the British Fringillidae and Emberizidae. The\r\nfacts have been selected from a large body of valuable notes kindly\r\nsent me by him. The bullfinch makes his advances in front of the\r\nfemale, and then puffs out his breast, so that many more of the crimson\r\nfeathers are seen at once than otherwise would be the case. At the same\r\ntime he twists and bows his black tail from side to side in a ludicrous\r\nmanner. The male chaffinch also stands in front of the female, thus\r\nshewing his red breast and “blue bell,” as the fanciers call his head;\r\nthe wings at the same time being slightly expanded, with the pure white\r\nbands on the shoulders thus rendered conspicuous. The common linnet\r\ndistends his rosy breast, slightly expands his brown wings and tail, so\r\nas to make the best of them by exhibiting their white edgings. We must,\r\nhowever, be cautious in concluding that the wings are spread out solely\r\nfor display, as some birds do so whose wings are not beautiful. This is\r\nthe case with the domestic cock, but it is always the wing on the side\r\nopposite to the female which is expanded, and at the same time scraped\r\non the ground. The male goldfinch behaves differently from all other\r\nfinches: his wings are beautiful, the shoulders being black, with the\r\ndark-tipped wing-feathers spotted with white and edged with golden\r\nyellow. When he courts the female, he sways his body from side to side,\r\nand quickly turns his slightly expanded wings first to one side, then\r\nto the other, with a golden flashing effect. Mr. Weir informs me that\r\nno other British finch turns thus from side to side during his\r\ncourtship, not even the closely-allied male siskin, for he would not\r\nthus add to his beauty.\r\n\r\nMost of the British Buntings are plain coloured birds; but in the\r\nspring the feathers on the head of the male reed-bunting (Emberiza\r\nschoeniculus) acquire a fine black colour by the abrasion of the dusky\r\ntips; and these are erected during the act of courtship. Mr. Weir has\r\nkept two species of Amadina from Australia: the A. castanotis is a very\r\nsmall and chastely coloured finch, with a dark tail, white rump, and\r\njet-black upper tail-coverts, each of the latter being marked with\r\nthree large conspicuous oval spots of white. (91. For the description\r\nof these birds, see Gould’s ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol.\r\ni. 1865, p. 417.) This species, when courting the female, slightly\r\nspreads out and vibrates these parti-coloured tail-coverts in a very\r\npeculiar manner. The male Amadina Lathami behaves very differently,\r\nexhibiting before the female his brilliantly spotted breast, scarlet\r\nrump, and scarlet upper tail-coverts. I may here add from Dr. Jerdon\r\nthat the Indian bulbul (Pycnonotus hoemorrhous) has its under\r\ntail-coverts of a crimson colour, and these, it might be thought, could\r\nnever be well exhibited; but the bird “when excited often spreads them\r\nout laterally, so that they can be seen even from above.” (92. ‘Birds\r\nof India,’ vol. ii. p. 96.) The crimson under tail-coverts of some\r\nother birds, as with one of the woodpeckers, Picus major, can be seen\r\nwithout any such display. The common pigeon has iridescent feathers on\r\nthe breast, and every one must have seen how the male inflates his\r\nbreast whilst courting the female, thus shewing them off to the best\r\nadvantage. One of the beautiful bronze-winged pigeons of Australia\r\n(Ocyphaps lophotes) behaves, as described to me by Mr. Weir, very\r\ndifferently: the male, whilst standing before the female, lowers his\r\nhead almost to the ground, spreads out and raises his tail, and half\r\nexpands his wings. He then alternately and slowly raises and depresses\r\nhis body, so that the iridescent metallic feathers are all seen at\r\nonce, and glitter in the sun.\r\n\r\nSufficient facts have now been given to shew with what care male birds\r\ndisplay their various charms, and this they do with the utmost skill.\r\nWhilst preening their feathers, they have frequent opportunities for\r\nadmiring themselves, and of studying how best to exhibit their beauty.\r\nBut as all the males of the same species display themselves in exactly\r\nthe same manner, it appears that actions, at first perhaps intentional,\r\nhave become instinctive. If so, we ought not to accuse birds of\r\nconscious vanity; yet when we see a peacock strutting about, with\r\nexpanded and quivering tail-feathers, he seems the very emblem of pride\r\nand vanity.\r\n\r\nThe various ornaments possessed by the males are certainly of the\r\nhighest importance to them, for in some cases they have been acquired\r\nat the expense of greatly impeded powers of flight or of running. The\r\nAfrican night-jar (Cosmetornis), which during the pairing-season has\r\none of its primary wing-feathers developed into a streamer of very\r\ngreat length, is thereby much retarded in its flight, although at other\r\ntimes remarkable for its swiftness. The “unwieldy size” of the\r\nsecondary wing-feathers of the male Argus pheasant is said “almost\r\nentirely to deprive the bird of flight.” The fine plumes of male birds\r\nof paradise trouble them during a high wind. The extremely long\r\ntail-feathers of the male widow-birds (Vidua) of Southern Africa render\r\n“their flight heavy;” but as soon as these are cast off they fly as\r\nwell as the females. As birds always breed when food is abundant, the\r\nmales probably do not suffer much inconvenience in searching for food\r\nfrom their impeded powers of movement; but there can hardly be a doubt\r\nthat they must be much more liable to be struck down by birds of prey.\r\nNor can we doubt that the long train of the peacock and the long tail\r\nand wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant must render them an easier prey\r\nto any prowling tiger-cat than would otherwise be the case. Even the\r\nbright colours of many male birds cannot fail to make them conspicuous\r\nto their enemies of all kinds. Hence, as Mr. Gould has remarked, it\r\nprobably is that such birds are generally of a shy disposition, as if\r\nconscious that their beauty was a source of danger, and are much more\r\ndifficult to discover or approach, than the sombre coloured and\r\ncomparatively tame females or than the young and as yet unadorned\r\nmales. (93. On the Cosmetornis, see Livingstone’s ‘Expedition to the\r\nZambesi,’ 1865, p. 66. On the Argus pheasant, Jardine’s ‘Nat. Hist.\r\nLib.: Birds,’ vol. xiv. p. 167. On Birds of Paradise, Lesson, quoted by\r\nBrehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. iii. s. 325. On the widow-bird, Barrow’s\r\n‘Travels in Africa,’ vol. i. p. 243, and ‘Ibis,’ vol. iii. 1861 p. 133.\r\nMr. Gould, on the shyness of male birds, ‘Handbook to Birds of\r\nAustralia,’ vol. i. 1865, pp. 210, 457.)\r\n\r\nIt is a more curious fact that the males of some birds which are\r\nprovided with special weapons for battle, and which in a state of\r\nnature are so pugnacious that they often kill each other, suffer from\r\npossessing certain ornaments. Cock-fighters trim the hackles and cut\r\noff the combs and gills of their cocks; and the birds are then said to\r\nbe dubbed. An undubbed bird, as Mr. Tegetmeier insists, “is at a\r\nfearful disadvantage; the comb and gills offer an easy hold to his\r\nadversary’s beak, and as a cock always strikes where he holds, when\r\nonce he has seized his foe, he has him entirely in his power. Even\r\nsupposing that the bird is not killed, the loss of blood suffered by an\r\nundubbed cock is much greater than that sustained by one that has been\r\ntrimmed.” (94. Tegetmeier, ‘The Poultry Book,’ 1866, p. 139.) Young\r\nturkey-cocks in fighting always seize hold of each other’s wattles; and\r\nI presume that the old birds fight in the same manner. It may perhaps\r\nbe objected that the comb and wattles are not ornamental, and cannot be\r\nof service to the birds in this way; but even to our eyes, the beauty\r\nof the glossy black Spanish cock is much enhanced by his white face and\r\ncrimson comb; and no one who has ever seen the splendid blue wattles of\r\nthe male Tragopan pheasant distended in courtship can for a moment\r\ndoubt that beauty is the object gained. From the foregoing facts we\r\nclearly see that the plumes and other ornaments of the males must be of\r\nthe highest importance to them; and we further see that beauty is even\r\nsometimes more important than success in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nBIRDS—continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoice exerted by the female—Length of courtship—Unpaired birds—Mental\r\nqualities and taste for the beautiful—Preference or antipathy shewn by\r\nthe female for particular males—Variability of birds—Variations\r\nsometimes abrupt—Laws of variation—Formation of ocelli—Gradations of\r\ncharacter—Case of Peacock, Argus pheasant, and Urosticte.\r\n\r\nWhen the sexes differ in beauty or in the power of singing, or in\r\nproducing what I have called instrumental music, it is almost\r\ninvariably the male who surpasses the female. These qualities, as we\r\nhave just seen, are evidently of high importance to the male. When they\r\nare gained for only a part of the year it is always before the\r\nbreeding-season. It is the male alone who elaborately displays his\r\nvaried attractions, and often performs strange antics on the ground or\r\nin the air, in the presence of the female. Each male drives away, or if\r\nhe can, kills his rivals. Hence we may conclude that it is the object\r\nof the male to induce the female to pair with him, and for this purpose\r\nhe tries to excite or charm her in various ways; and this is the\r\nopinion of all those who have carefully studied the habits of living\r\nbirds. But there remains a question which has an all important bearing\r\non sexual selection, namely, does every male of the same species excite\r\nand attract the female equally? Or does she exert a choice, and prefer\r\ncertain males? This latter question can be answered in the affirmative\r\nby much direct and indirect evidence. It is far more difficult to\r\ndecide what qualities determine the choice of the females; but here\r\nagain we have some direct and indirect evidence that it is to a large\r\nextent the external attractions of the male; though no doubt his\r\nvigour, courage, and other mental qualities come into play. We will\r\nbegin with the indirect evidence.\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF COURTSHIP.\r\n\r\nThe lengthened period during which both sexes of certain birds meet day\r\nafter day at an appointed place probably depends partly on the\r\ncourtship being a prolonged affair, and partly on reiteration in the\r\nact of pairing. Thus in Germany and Scandinavia the balzen or leks of\r\nthe black-cocks last from the middle of March, all through April into\r\nMay. As many as forty or fifty, or even more birds congregate at the\r\nleks; and the same place is often frequented during successive years.\r\nThe lek of the capercailzie lasts from the end of March to the middle\r\nor even end of May. In North America “the partridge dances” of the\r\nTetrao phasianellus “last for a month or more.” Other kinds of grouse,\r\nboth in North America and Eastern Siberia (1. Nordman describes (‘Bull.\r\nSoc. Imp. des Nat. Moscou,’ 1861, tom. xxxiv. p. 264) the balzen of\r\nTetrao urogalloides in Amur Land. He estimated the number of birds\r\nassembled at above a hundred, not counting the females, which lie hid\r\nin the surrounding bushes. The noises uttered differ from those of T.\r\nurogallus.), follow nearly the same habits. The fowlers discover the\r\nhillocks where the ruffs congregate by the grass being trampled bare,\r\nand this shews that the same spot is long frequented. The Indians of\r\nGuiana are well acquainted with the cleared arenas, where they expect\r\nto find the beautiful cocks of the Rock; and the natives of New Guinea\r\nknow the trees where from ten to twenty male birds of paradise in full\r\nplumage congregate. In this latter case it is not expressly stated that\r\nthe females meet on the same trees, but the hunters, if not specially\r\nasked, would probably not mention their presence, as their skins are\r\nvalueless. Small parties of an African weaver (Ploceus) congregate,\r\nduring the breeding-season, and perform for hours their graceful\r\nevolutions. Large numbers of the Solitary snipe (Scolopax major)\r\nassemble during dusk in a morass; and the same place is frequented for\r\nthe same purpose during successive years; here they may be seen running\r\nabout “like so many large rats,” puffing out their feathers, flapping\r\ntheir wings, and uttering the strangest cries. (2. With respect to the\r\nassemblages of the above named grouse, see Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’ B. iv.\r\ns. 350; also L. Lloyd, ‘Game Birds of Sweden,’ 1867, pp. 19, 78.\r\nRichardson, ‘Fauna Bor. Americana: Birds,’ p. 362. References in regard\r\nto the assemblages of other birds have already been given. On\r\nParadisea, see Wallace, in ‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. xx.\r\n1857, p. 412. On the snipe, Lloyd, ibid. p. 221.)\r\n\r\nSome of the above birds,—the black-cock, capercailzie, pheasant-grouse,\r\nruff, solitary snipe, and perhaps others,—are, as is believed,\r\npolygamists. With such birds it might have been thought that the\r\nstronger males would simply have driven away the weaker, and then at\r\nonce have taken possession of as many females as possible; but if it be\r\nindispensable for the male to excite or please the female, we can\r\nunderstand the length of the courtship and the congregation of so many\r\nindividuals of both sexes at the same spot. Certain strictly monogamous\r\nspecies likewise hold nuptial assemblages; this seems to be the case in\r\nScandinavia with one of the ptarmigans, and their leks last from the\r\nmiddle of March to the middle of May. In Australia the lyre-bird\r\n(Menura superba) forms “small round hillocks,” and the M. Alberti\r\nscratches for itself shallow holes, or, as they are called by the\r\nnatives, “corroborying places,” where it is believed both sexes\r\nassemble. The meetings of the M. superba are sometimes very large; and\r\nan account has lately been published (3. Quoted by Mr. T.W. Wood, in\r\nthe ‘Student,’ April 1870, p. 125.) by a traveller, who heard in a\r\nvalley beneath him, thickly covered with scrub, “a din which completely\r\nastonished” him; on crawling onwards he beheld, to his amazement, about\r\none hundred and fifty of the magnificent lyre-cocks, “ranged in order\r\nof battle, and fighting with indescribable fury.” The bowers of the\r\nBower-birds are the resort of both sexes during the breeding-season;\r\nand “here the males meet and contend with each other for the favours of\r\nthe female, and here the latter assemble and coquet with the males.”\r\nWith two of the genera, the same bower is resorted to during many\r\nyears. (4. Gould, ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. pp.\r\n300, 308, 448, 451. On the ptarmigan, above alluded to, see Lloyd,\r\nibid. p. 129.)\r\n\r\nThe common magpie (Corvus pica, Linn.), as I have been informed by the\r\nRev. W. Darwin Fox, used to assemble from all parts of Delamere Forest,\r\nin order to celebrate the “great magpie marriage.” Some years ago these\r\nbirds abounded in extraordinary numbers, so that a gamekeeper killed in\r\none morning nineteen males, and another killed by a single shot seven\r\nbirds at roost together. They then had the habit of assembling very\r\nearly in the spring at particular spots, where they could be seen in\r\nflocks, chattering, sometimes fighting, bustling and flying about the\r\ntrees. The whole affair was evidently considered by the birds as one of\r\nthe highest importance. Shortly after the meeting they all separated,\r\nand were then observed by Mr. Fox and others to be paired for the\r\nseason. In any district in which a species does not exist in large\r\nnumbers, great assemblages cannot, of course, be held, and the same\r\nspecies may have different habits in different countries. For instance,\r\nI have heard of only one instance, from Mr. Wedderburn, of a regular\r\nassemblage of black game in Scotland, yet these assemblages are so well\r\nknown in Germany and Scandinavia that they have received special names.\r\n\r\nUNPAIRED BIRDS.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts now given, we may conclude that the courtship of birds\r\nbelonging to widely different groups, is often a prolonged, delicate,\r\nand troublesome affair. There is even reason to suspect, improbable as\r\nthis will at first appear, that some males and females of the same\r\nspecies, inhabiting the same district, do not always please each other,\r\nand consequently do not pair. Many accounts have been published of\r\neither the male or female of a pair having been shot, and quickly\r\nreplaced by another. This has been observed more frequently with the\r\nmagpie than with any other bird, owing perhaps to its conspicuous\r\nappearance and nest. The illustrious Jenner states that in Wiltshire\r\none of a pair was daily shot no less than seven times successively,\r\n“but all to no purpose, for the remaining magpie soon found another\r\nmate”; and the last pair reared their young. A new partner is generally\r\nfound on the succeeding day; but Mr. Thompson gives the case of one\r\nbeing replaced on the evening of the same day. Even after the eggs are\r\nhatched, if one of the old birds is destroyed a mate will often be\r\nfound; this occurred after an interval of two days, in a case recently\r\nobserved by one of Sir J. Lubbock’s keepers. (5. On magpies, Jenner, in\r\n‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1824, p. 21. Macgillivray, ‘Hist. British\r\nBirds,’ vol. i. p. 570. Thompson, in ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory,’ vol. viii. 1842, p. 494.) The first and most obvious\r\nconjecture is that male magpies must be much more numerous than\r\nfemales; and that in the above cases, as well as in many others which\r\ncould be given, the males alone had been killed. This apparently holds\r\ngood in some instances, for the gamekeepers in Delamere Forest assured\r\nMr. Fox that the magpies and carrion-crows which they formerly killed\r\nin succession in large numbers near their nests, were all males; and\r\nthey accounted for this fact by the males being easily killed whilst\r\nbringing food to the sitting females. Macgillivray, however, gives, on\r\nthe authority of an excellent observer, an instance of three magpies\r\nsuccessively killed on the same nest, which were all females; and\r\nanother case of six magpies successively killed whilst sitting on the\r\nsame eggs, which renders it probable that most of them were females;\r\nthough, as I hear from Mr. Fox, the male will sit on the eggs when the\r\nfemale is killed.\r\n\r\nSir J. Lubbock’s gamekeeper has repeatedly shot, but how often he could\r\nnot say, one of a pair of jays (Garrulus glandarius), and has never\r\nfailed shortly afterwards to find the survivor re-matched. Mr. Fox, Mr.\r\nF. Bond, and others have shot one of a pair of carrion-crows (Corvus\r\ncorone), but the nest was soon again tenanted by a pair. These birds\r\nare rather common; but the peregrine-falcon (Falco peregrinus) is rare,\r\nyet Mr. Thompson states that in Ireland “if either an old male or\r\nfemale be killed in the breeding-season (not an uncommon circumstance),\r\nanother mate is found within a very few days, so that the eyries,\r\nnotwithstanding such casualties, are sure to turn out their complement\r\nof young.” Mr. Jenner Weir has known the same thing with the\r\nperegrine-falcons at Beachy Head. The same observer informs me that\r\nthree kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), all males, were killed one after\r\nthe other whilst attending the same nest; two of these were in mature\r\nplumage, but the third was in the plumage of the previous year. Even\r\nwith the rare golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Mr. Birkbeck was\r\nassured by a trustworthy gamekeeper in Scotland, that if one is killed,\r\nanother is soon found. So with the white owl (Strix flammea), “the\r\nsurvivor readily found a mate, and the mischief went on.”\r\n\r\nWhite of Selborne, who gives the case of the owl, adds that he knew a\r\nman, who from believing that partridges when paired were disturbed by\r\nthe males fighting, used to shoot them; and though he had widowed the\r\nsame female several times, she always soon found a fresh partner. This\r\nsame naturalist ordered the sparrows, which deprived the house-martins\r\nof their nests, to be shot; but the one which was left, “be it cock or\r\nhen, presently procured a mate, and so for several times following.” I\r\ncould add analogous cases relating to the chaffinch, nightingale, and\r\nredstart. With respect to the latter bird (Phoenicura ruticilla), a\r\nwriter expresses much surprise how the sitting female could so soon\r\nhave given effectual notice that she was a widow, for the species was\r\nnot common in the neighbourhood. Mr. Jenner Weir has mentioned to me a\r\nnearly similar case; at Blackheath he never sees or hears the note of\r\nthe wild bullfinch, yet when one of his caged males has died, a wild\r\none in the course of a few days has generally come and perched near the\r\nwidowed female, whose call-note is not loud. I will give only one other\r\nfact, on the authority of this same observer; one of a pair of\r\nstarlings (Sturnus vulgaris) was shot in the morning; by noon a new\r\nmate was found; this was again shot, but before night the pair was\r\ncomplete; so that the disconsolate widow or widower was thrice consoled\r\nduring the same day. Mr. Engleheart also informs me that he used during\r\nseveral years to shoot one of a pair of starlings which built in a hole\r\nin a house at Blackheath; but the loss was always immediately repaired.\r\nDuring one season he kept an account, and found that he had shot\r\nthirty-five birds from the same nest; these consisted of both males and\r\nfemales, but in what proportion he could not say: nevertheless, after\r\nall this destruction, a brood was reared. (6. On the peregrine falcon,\r\nsee Thompson, ‘Nat. Hist. of Ireland: Birds,’ vol. i. 1849, p. 39. On\r\nowls, sparrows, and partridges, see White, ‘Nat. Hist. of Selborne,’\r\nedit. of 1825, vol. i. p. 139. On the Phoenicura, see Loudon’s ‘Mag. of\r\nNat. Hist.’ vol. vii. 1834, p. 245. Brehm (‘Thierleben,’ B. iv. s. 991)\r\nalso alludes to cases of birds thrice mated during the same day.)\r\n\r\nThese facts well deserve attention. How is it that there are birds\r\nenough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex? Magpies,\r\njays, carrion-crows, partridges, and some other birds, are always seen\r\nduring the spring in pairs, and never by themselves; and these offer at\r\nfirst sight the most perplexing cases. But birds of the same sex,\r\nalthough of course not truly paired, sometimes live in pairs or in\r\nsmall parties, as is known to be the case with pigeons and partridges.\r\nBirds also sometimes live in triplets, as has been observed with\r\nstarlings, carrion-crows, parrots, and partridges. With partridges two\r\nfemales have been known to live with one male, and two males with one\r\nfemale. In all such cases it is probable that the union would be easily\r\nbroken; and one of the three would readily pair with a widow or\r\nwidower. The males of certain birds may occasionally be heard pouring\r\nforth their love-song long after the proper time, shewing that they\r\nhave either lost or never gained a mate. Death from accident or disease\r\nof one of a pair would leave the other free and single; and there is\r\nreason to believe that female birds during the breeding-season are\r\nespecially liable to premature death. Again, birds which have had their\r\nnests destroyed, or barren pairs, or retarded individuals, would easily\r\nbe induced to desert their mates, and would probably be glad to take\r\nwhat share they could of the pleasures and duties of rearing offspring\r\nalthough not their own. (7. See White (‘Nat. Hist. of Selborne,’ 1825,\r\nvol. i. p. 140) on the existence, early in the season, of small coveys\r\nof male partridges, of which fact I have heard other instances. See\r\nJenner, on the retarded state of the generative organs in certain\r\nbirds, in ‘Phil. Transact.’ 1824. In regard to birds living in\r\ntriplets, I owe to Mr. Jenner Weir the cases of the starlings and\r\nparrots, and to Mr. Fox, of partridges; on carrion-crows, see the\r\n‘Field,’ 1868, p. 415. On various male birds singing after the proper\r\nperiod, see Rev. L. Jenyns, ‘Observations in Natural History,’ 1846, p.\r\n87.) Such contingencies as these probably explain most of the foregoing\r\ncases. (8. The following case has been given (‘The Times,’ Aug. 6,\r\n1868) by the Rev. F.O. Morris, on the authority of the Hon. and Rev.\r\nO.W. Forester. “The gamekeeper here found a hawk’s nest this year, with\r\nfive young ones on it. He took four and killed them, but left one with\r\nits wings clipped as a decoy to destroy the old ones by. They were both\r\nshot next day, in the act of feeding the young one, and the keeper\r\nthought it was done with. The next day he came again and found two\r\nother charitable hawks, who had come with an adopted feeling to succour\r\nthe orphan. These two he killed, and then left the nest. On returning\r\nafterwards he found two more charitable individuals on the same errand\r\nof mercy. One of these he killed; the other he also shot, but could not\r\nfind. No more came on the like fruitless errand.”) Nevertheless, it is\r\na strange fact that within the same district, during the height of the\r\nbreeding-season, there should be so many males and females always ready\r\nto repair the loss of a mated bird. Why do not such spare birds\r\nimmediately pair together? Have we not some reason to suspect, and the\r\nsuspicion has occurred to Mr. Jenner Weir, that as the courtship of\r\nbirds appears to be in many cases prolonged and tedious, so it\r\noccasionally happens that certain males and females do not succeed,\r\nduring the proper season, in exciting each other’s love, and\r\nconsequently do not pair? This suspicion will appear somewhat less\r\nimprobable after we have seen what strong antipathies and preferences\r\nfemale birds occasionally evince towards particular males.\r\n\r\nMENTAL QUALITIES OF BIRDS, AND THEIR TASTE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL.\r\n\r\nBefore we further discuss the question whether the females select the\r\nmore attractive males or accept the first whom they may encounter, it\r\nwill be advisable briefly to consider the mental powers of birds. Their\r\nreason is generally, and perhaps justly, ranked as low; yet some facts\r\ncould be given leading to an opposite conclusion. (9. I am indebted to\r\nProf. Newton for the following passage from Mr. Adam’s ‘Travels of a\r\nNaturalist,’ 1870, p. 278. Speaking of Japanese nut-hatches in\r\nconfinement, he says: “Instead of the more yielding fruit of the yew,\r\nwhich is the usual food of the nut-hatch of Japan, at one time I\r\nsubstituted hard hazel-nuts. As the bird was unable to crack them, he\r\nplaced them one by one in his water-glass, evidently with the notion\r\nthat they would in time become softer—an interesting proof of\r\nintelligence on the part of these birds.”) Low powers of reasoning,\r\nhowever, are compatible, as we see with mankind, with strong\r\naffections, acute perception, and a taste for the beautiful; and it is\r\nwith these latter qualities that we are here concerned. It has often\r\nbeen said that parrots become so deeply attached to each other that\r\nwhen one dies the other pines for a long time; but Mr. Jenner Weir\r\nthinks that with most birds the strength of their affection has been\r\nmuch exaggerated. Nevertheless when one of a pair in a state of nature\r\nhas been shot, the survivor has been heard for days afterwards uttering\r\na plaintive call; and Mr. St. John gives various facts proving the\r\nattachment of mated birds. (10. ‘A Tour in Sutherlandshire,’ vol. i.\r\n1849, p. 185. Dr. Buller says (‘Birds of New Zealand,’ 1872, p. 56)\r\nthat a male King Lory was killed; and the female “fretted and moped,\r\nrefused her food, and died of a broken heart.”) Mr. Bennett relates\r\n(11. ‘Wanderings in New South Wales,’ vol. ii. 1834, p. 62.) that in\r\nChina after a drake of the beautiful mandarin Teal had been stolen, the\r\nduck remained disconsolate, though sedulously courted by another\r\nmandarin drake, who displayed before her all his charms. After an\r\ninterval of three weeks the stolen drake was recovered, and instantly\r\nthe pair recognised each other with extreme joy. On the other hand,\r\nstarlings, as we have seen, may be consoled thrice in the same day for\r\nthe loss of their mates. Pigeons have such excellent local memories,\r\nthat they have been known to return to their former homes after an\r\ninterval of nine months, yet, as I hear from Mr. Harrison Weir, if a\r\npair which naturally would remain mated for life be separated for a few\r\nweeks during the winter, and afterwards matched with other birds, the\r\ntwo when brought together again, rarely, if ever, recognise each other.\r\n\r\nBirds sometimes exhibit benevolent feelings; they will feed the\r\ndeserted young ones even of distinct species, but this perhaps ought to\r\nbe considered as a mistaken instinct. They will feed, as shewn in an\r\nearlier part of this work, adult birds of their own species which have\r\nbecome blind. Mr. Buxton gives a curious account of a parrot which took\r\ncare of a frost-bitten and crippled bird of a distinct species,\r\ncleansed her feathers, and defended her from the attacks of the other\r\nparrots which roamed freely about his garden. It is a still more\r\ncurious fact that these birds apparently evince some sympathy for the\r\npleasures of their fellows. When a pair of cockatoos made a nest in an\r\nacacia tree, “it was ridiculous to see the extravagant interest taken\r\nin the matter by the others of the same species.” These parrots, also,\r\nevinced unbounded curiosity, and clearly had “the idea of property and\r\npossession.” (12. ‘Acclimatization of Parrots,’ by C. Buxton, M.P.,\r\n‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ Nov. 1868, p. 381.) They have good\r\nmemories, for in the Zoological Gardens they have plainly recognised\r\ntheir former masters after an interval of some months.\r\n\r\nBirds possess acute powers of observation. Every mated bird, of course,\r\nrecognises its fellow. Audubon states that a certain number of\r\nmocking-thrushes (Mimus polyglottus) remain all the year round in\r\nLouisiana, whilst others migrate to the Eastern States; these latter,\r\non their return, are instantly recognised, and always attacked, by\r\ntheir southern brethren. Birds under confinement distinguish different\r\npersons, as is proved by the strong and permanent antipathy or\r\naffection which they shew, without any apparent cause, towards certain\r\nindividuals. I have heard of numerous instances with jays, partridges,\r\ncanaries, and especially bullfinches. Mr. Hussey has described in how\r\nextraordinary a manner a tamed partridge recognised everybody: and its\r\nlikes and dislikes were very strong. This bird seemed “fond of gay\r\ncolours, and no new gown or cap could be put on without catching his\r\nattention.” (13. The ‘Zoologist,’ 1847-48, p. 1602.) Mr. Hewitt has\r\ndescribed the habits of some ducks (recently descended from wild\r\nbirds), which, at the approach of a strange dog or cat, would rush\r\nheadlong into the water, and exhaust themselves in their attempts to\r\nescape; but they knew Mr. Hewitt’s own dogs and cats so well that they\r\nwould lie down and bask in the sun close to them. They always moved\r\naway from a strange man, and so they would from the lady who attended\r\nthem if she made any great change in her dress. Audubon relates that he\r\nreared and tamed a wild turkey which always ran away from any strange\r\ndog; this bird escaped into the woods, and some days afterwards Audubon\r\nsaw, as he thought, a wild turkey, and made his dog chase it; but, to\r\nhis astonishment, the bird did not run away, and the dog, when he came\r\nup, did not attack the bird, for they mutually recognised each other as\r\nold friends. (14. Hewitt on wild ducks, ‘Journal of Horticulture,’ Jan.\r\n13, 1863, p. 39. Audubon on the wild turkey, ‘Ornithological\r\nBiography,’ vol. i. p. 14. On the mocking-thrush, ibid. vol. i. p.\r\n110.)\r\n\r\nMr. Jenner Weir is convinced that birds pay particular attention to the\r\ncolours of other birds, sometimes out of jealousy, and sometimes as a\r\nsign of kinship. Thus he turned a reed-bunting (Emberiza schoeniculus),\r\nwhich had acquired its black head-dress, into his aviary, and the\r\nnew-comer was not noticed by any bird, except by a bullfinch, which is\r\nlikewise black-headed. This bullfinch was a very quiet bird, and had\r\nnever before quarrelled with any of its comrades, including another\r\nreed-bunting, which had not as yet become black-headed: but the\r\nreed-bunting with a black head was so unmercifully treated that it had\r\nto be removed. Spiza cyanea, during the breeding-season, is of a bright\r\nblue colour; and though generally peaceable, it attacked S. ciris,\r\nwhich has only the head blue, and completely scalped the unfortunate\r\nbird. Mr. Weir was also obliged to turn out a robin, as it fiercely\r\nattacked all the birds in his aviary with any red in their plumage, but\r\nno other kinds; it actually killed a red-breasted crossbill, and nearly\r\nkilled a goldfinch. On the other hand, he has observed that some birds,\r\nwhen first introduced, fly towards the species which resemble them most\r\nin colour, and settle by their sides.\r\n\r\nAs male birds display their fine plumage and other ornaments with so\r\nmuch care before the females, it is obviously probable that these\r\nappreciate the beauty of their suitors. It is, however, difficult to\r\nobtain direct evidence of their capacity to appreciate beauty. When\r\nbirds gaze at themselves in a looking-glass (of which many instances\r\nhave been recorded) we cannot feel sure that it is not from jealousy of\r\na supposed rival, though this is not the conclusion of some observers.\r\nIn other cases it is difficult to distinguish between mere curiosity\r\nand admiration. It is perhaps the former feeling which, as stated by\r\nLord Lilford (15. The ‘Ibis,’ vol. ii. 1860, p. 344.), attracts the\r\nruff towards any bright object, so that, in the Ionian Islands, “it\r\nwill dart down to a bright-coloured handkerchief, regardless of\r\nrepeated shots.” The common lark is drawn down from the sky, and is\r\ncaught in large numbers, by a small mirror made to move and glitter in\r\nthe sun. Is it admiration or curiosity which leads the magpie, raven,\r\nand some other birds to steal and secrete bright objects, such as\r\nsilver articles or jewels?\r\n\r\nMr. Gould states that certain humming-birds decorate the outsides of\r\ntheir nests “with the utmost taste; they instinctively fasten thereon\r\nbeautiful pieces of flat lichen, the larger pieces in the middle, and\r\nthe smaller on the part attached to the branch. Now and then a pretty\r\nfeather is intertwined or fastened to the outer sides, the stem being\r\nalways so placed that the feather stands out beyond the surface.” The\r\nbest evidence, however, of a taste for the beautiful is afforded by the\r\nthree genera of Australian bower-birds already mentioned. Their bowers\r\n(Fig. 46), where the sexes congregate and play strange antics, are\r\nvariously constructed, but what most concerns us is, that they are\r\ndecorated by the several species in a different manner. The Satin\r\nbower-bird collects gaily-coloured articles, such as the blue\r\ntail-feathers of parrakeets, bleached bones and shells, which it sticks\r\nbetween the twigs or arranges at the entrance. Mr. Gould found in one\r\nbower a neatly-worked stone tomahawk and a slip of blue cotton,\r\nevidently procured from a native encampment. These objects are\r\ncontinually re-arranged, and carried about by the birds whilst at play.\r\nThe bower of the Spotted bower-bird “is beautifully lined with tall\r\ngrasses, so disposed that the heads nearly meet, and the decorations\r\nare very profuse.” Round stones are used to keep the grass-stems in\r\ntheir proper places, and to make divergent paths leading to the bower.\r\nThe stones and shells are often brought from a great distance. The\r\nRegent bird, as described by Mr. Ramsay, ornaments its short bower with\r\nbleached land-shells belonging to five or six species, and with\r\n“berries of various colours, blue, red, and black, which give it when\r\nfresh a very pretty appearance. Besides these there were several\r\nnewly-picked leaves and young shoots of a pinkish colour, the whole\r\nshowing a decided taste for the beautiful.” Well may Mr. Gould say that\r\n“these highly decorated halls of assembly must be regarded as the most\r\nwonderful instances of bird-architecture yet discovered;” and the\r\ntaste, as we see, of the several species certainly differs. (16. On the\r\nornamented nests of humming-birds, Gould, ‘Introduction to the\r\nTrochilidae,’ 1861, p. 19. On the bower-birds, Gould, ‘Handbook to the\r\nBirds of Australia,’ 1865, vol. i. pp. 444-461. Ramsay, in the ‘Ibis,’\r\n1867, p. 456.)\r\n\r\nPREFERENCE FOR A PARTICULAR MALES BY THE FEMALES.\r\n\r\nHaving made these preliminary remarks on the discrimination and taste\r\nof birds, I will give all the facts known to me which bear on the\r\npreference shewn by the female for particular males. It is certain that\r\ndistinct species of birds occasionally pair in a state of nature and\r\nproduce hybrids. Many instances could be given: thus Macgillivray\r\nrelates how a male blackbird and female thrush “fell in love with each\r\nother,” and produced offspring. (17. ‘History of Brit. Birds,’ vol. ii.\r\np. 92.) Several years ago eighteen cases had been recorded of the\r\noccurrence in Great Britain of hybrids between the black grouse and\r\npheasant (18. ‘Zoologist,’ 1853-1854, p. 3946.); but most of these\r\ncases may perhaps be accounted for by solitary birds not finding one of\r\ntheir own species to pair with. With other birds, as Mr. Jenner Weir\r\nhas reason to believe, hybrids are sometimes the result of the casual\r\nintercourse of birds building in close proximity. But these remarks do\r\nnot apply to the many recorded instances of tamed or domestic birds,\r\nbelonging to distinct species, which have become absolutely fascinated\r\nwith each other, although living with their own species. Thus Waterton\r\n(19. Waterton, ‘Essays on Nat. Hist.’ 2nd series, pp. 42 and 117. For\r\nthe following statements see on the wigeon, ‘Loudon’s Mag. of Nat.\r\nHist.’ vol. ix. p. 616; L. Lloyd, ‘Scandinavian Adventures,’ vol. i.\r\n1854, p. 452. Dixon, ‘Ornamental and Domestic Poultry,’ p. 137; Hewitt,\r\nin ‘Journal of Horticulture,’ Jan. 13, 1863, p. 40; Bechstein,\r\n‘Stubenvögel,’ 1840, s. 230. Mr. J. Jenner Weir has lately given me an\r\nanalogous case with ducks of two species.) states that out of a flock\r\nof twenty-three Canada geese, a female paired with a solitary Bernicle\r\ngander, although so different in appearance and size; and they produced\r\nhybrid offspring. A male wigeon (Mareca penelope), living with females\r\nof the same species, has been known to pair with a pintail duck,\r\nQuerquedula acuta. Lloyd describes the remarkable attachment between a\r\nshield-drake (Tadorna vulpanser) and a common duck. Many additional\r\ninstances could be given; and the Rev. E.S. Dixon remarks that “those\r\nwho have kept many different species of geese together well know what\r\nunaccountable attachments they are frequently forming, and that they\r\nare quite as likely to pair and rear young with individuals of a race\r\n(species) apparently the most alien to themselves as with their own\r\nstock.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W.D. Fox informs me that he possessed at the same time a pair\r\nof Chinese geese (Anser cygnoides), and a common gander with three\r\ngeese. The two lots kept quite separate, until the Chinese gander\r\nseduced one of the common geese to live with him. Moreover, of the\r\nyoung birds hatched from the eggs of the common geese, only four were\r\npure, the other eighteen proving hybrids; so that the Chinese gander\r\nseems to have had prepotent charms over the common gander. I will give\r\nonly one other case; Mr. Hewitt states that a wild duck, reared in\r\ncaptivity, “after breeding a couple of seasons with her own mallard, at\r\nonce shook him off on my placing a male Pintail on the water. It was\r\nevidently a case of love at first sight, for she swam about the\r\nnew-comer caressingly, though he appeared evidently alarmed and averse\r\nto her overtures of affection. From that hour she forgot her old\r\npartner. Winter passed by, and the next spring the pintail seemed to\r\nhave become a convert to her blandishments, for they nested and\r\nproduced seven or eight young ones.”\r\n\r\nWhat the charm may have been in these several cases, beyond mere\r\nnovelty, we cannot even conjecture. Colour, however, sometimes comes\r\ninto play; for in order to raise hybrids from the siskin (Fringilla\r\nspinus) and the canary, it is much the best plan, according to\r\nBechstein, to place birds of the same tint together. Mr. Jenner Weir\r\nturned a female canary into his aviary, where there were male linnets,\r\ngoldfinches, siskins, greenfinches, chaffinches, and other birds, in\r\norder to see which she would choose; but there never was any doubt, and\r\nthe greenfinch carried the day. They paired and produced hybrid\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the female preferring to pair with one male rather than\r\nwith another of the same species is not so likely to excite attention,\r\nas when this occurs, as we have just seen, between distinct species.\r\nThe former cases can best be observed with domesticated or confined\r\nbirds; but these are often pampered by high feeding, and sometimes have\r\ntheir instincts vitiated to an extreme degree. Of this latter fact I\r\ncould give sufficient proofs with pigeons, and especially with fowls,\r\nbut they cannot be here related. Vitiated instincts may also account\r\nfor some of the hybrid unions above mentioned; but in many of these\r\ncases the birds were allowed to range freely over large ponds, and\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that they were unnaturally stimulated by\r\nhigh feeding.\r\n\r\nWith respect to birds in a state of nature, the first and most obvious\r\nsupposition which will occur to every one is that the female at the\r\nproper season accepts the first male whom she may encounter; but she\r\nhas at least the opportunity for exerting a choice, as she is almost\r\ninvariably pursued by many males. Audubon—and we must remember that he\r\nspent a long life in prowling about the forests of the United States\r\nand observing the birds—does not doubt that the female deliberately\r\nchooses her mate; thus, speaking of a woodpecker, he says the hen is\r\nfollowed by half-a-dozen gay suitors, who continue performing strange\r\nantics, “until a marked preference is shewn for one.” The female of the\r\nred-winged starling (Agelaeus phoeniceus) is likewise pursued by\r\nseveral males, “until, becoming fatigued, she alights, receives their\r\naddresses, and soon makes a choice.” He describes also how several male\r\nnight-jars repeatedly plunge through the air with astonishing rapidity,\r\nsuddenly turning, and thus making a singular noise; “but no sooner has\r\nthe female made her choice than the other males are driven away.” With\r\none of the vultures (Cathartes aura) of the United States, parties of\r\neight, ten, or more males and females assemble on fallen logs,\r\n“exhibiting the strongest desire to please mutually,” and after many\r\ncaresses, each male leads off his partner on the wing. Audubon likewise\r\ncarefully observed the wild flocks of Canada geese (Anser canadensis),\r\nand gives a graphic description of their love-antics; he says that the\r\nbirds which had been previously mated “renewed their courtship as early\r\nas the month of January, while the others would be contending or\r\ncoquetting for hours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the\r\nchoice they had made, after which, although they remained together, any\r\nperson could easily perceive that they were careful to keep in pairs. I\r\nhave observed also that the older the birds the shorter were the\r\npreliminaries of their courtship. The bachelors and old maids whether\r\nin regret, or not caring to be disturbed by the bustle, quietly moved\r\naside and lay down at some distance from the rest.” (20. Audubon,\r\n‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. i. pp. 191, 349; vol. ii. pp. 42, 275;\r\nvol. iii. p. 2.) Many similar statements with respect to other birds\r\ncould be cited from this same observer.\r\n\r\nTurning now to domesticated and confined birds, I will commence by\r\ngiving what little I have learnt respecting the courtship of fowls. I\r\nhave received long letters on this subject from Messrs. Hewitt and\r\nTegetmeier, and almost an essay from the late Mr. Brent. It will be\r\nadmitted by every one that these gentlemen, so well known from their\r\npublished works, are careful and experienced observers. They do not\r\nbelieve that the females prefer certain males on account of the beauty\r\nof their plumage; but some allowance must be made for the artificial\r\nstate under which these birds have long been kept. Mr. Tegetmeier is\r\nconvinced that a gamecock, though disfigured by being dubbed and with\r\nhis hackles trimmed, would be accepted as readily as a male retaining\r\nall his natural ornaments. Mr. Brent, however, admits that the beauty\r\nof the male probably aids in exciting the female; and her acquiescence\r\nis necessary. Mr. Hewitt is convinced that the union is by no means\r\nleft to mere chance, for the female almost invariably prefers the most\r\nvigorous, defiant, and mettlesome male; hence it is almost useless, as\r\nhe remarks, “to attempt true breeding if a game-cock in good health and\r\ncondition runs the locality, for almost every hen on leaving the\r\nroosting-place will resort to the game-cock, even though that bird may\r\nnot actually drive away the male of her own variety.” Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances the males and females of the fowl seem to come to a\r\nmutual understanding by means of certain gestures, described to me by\r\nMr. Brent. But hens will often avoid the officious attentions of young\r\nmales. Old hens, and hens of a pugnacious disposition, as the same\r\nwriter informs me, dislike strange males, and will not yield until well\r\nbeaten into compliance. Ferguson, however, describes how a quarrelsome\r\nhen was subdued by the gentle courtship of a Shanghai cock. (21. ‘Rare\r\nand Prize Poultry,’ 1854, p. 27.)\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that pigeons of both sexes prefer pairing\r\nwith birds of the same breed; and dovecot-pigeons dislike all the\r\nhighly improved breeds. (22. ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. p. 103.) Mr. Harrison Weir has lately heard\r\nfrom a trustworthy observer, who keeps blue pigeons, that these drive\r\naway all other coloured varieties, such as white, red, and yellow; and\r\nfrom another observer, that a female dun carrier could not, after\r\nrepeated trials, be matched with a black male, but immediately paired\r\nwith a dun. Again, Mr. Tegetmeier had a female blue turbit that\r\nobstinately refused to pair with two males of the same breed, which\r\nwere successively shut up with her for weeks; but on being let out she\r\nwould have immediately accepted the first blue dragon that offered. As\r\nshe was a valuable bird, she was then shut up for many weeks with a\r\nsilver (i.e., very pale blue) male, and at last mated with him.\r\nNevertheless, as a general rule, colour appears to have little\r\ninfluence on the pairing of pigeons. Mr. Tegetmeier, at my request,\r\nstained some of his birds with magenta, but they were not much noticed\r\nby the others.\r\n\r\nFemale pigeons occasionally feel a strong antipathy towards certain\r\nmales, without any assignable cause. Thus MM. Boitard and Corbie, whose\r\nexperience extended over forty-five years, state: “Quand une femelle\r\néprouve de l’antipathie pour un mâle avec lequel on veut l’accoupler,\r\nmalgré tous les feux de l’amour, malgré l’alpiste et le chenevis dont\r\non la nourrit pour augmenter son ardeur, malgré un emprisonnement de\r\nsix mois et même d’un an, elle refuse constamment ses caresses; les\r\navances empressées, les agaceries, les tournoiemens, les tendres\r\nroucoulemens, rien ne peut lui plaire ni l’émouvoir; gonflée, boudeuse,\r\nblottie dans un coin de sa prison, elle n’en sort que pour boire et\r\nmanger, ou pour repousser avec une espèce de rage des caresses devenues\r\ntrop pressantes.” (23. Boitard and Corbie, ‘Les Pigeons,’ etc., 1824,\r\np. 12. Prosper Lucas (‘Traité de l’Héréd. Nat.’ tom. ii. 1850, p. 296)\r\nhas himself observed nearly similar facts with pigeons.) On the other\r\nhand, Mr. Harrison Weir has himself observed, and has heard from\r\nseveral breeders, that a female pigeon will occasionally take a strong\r\nfancy for a particular male, and will desert her own mate for him. Some\r\nfemales, according to another experienced observer, Riedel (24. Die\r\nTaubenzucht, 1824, s. 86.), are of a profligate disposition, and prefer\r\nalmost any stranger to their own mate. Some amorous males, called by\r\nour English fanciers “gay birds,” are so successful in their\r\ngallantries, that, as Mr. H. Weir informs me, they must be shut up on\r\naccount of the mischief which they cause.\r\n\r\nWild turkeys in the United States, according to Audubon, “sometimes pay\r\ntheir addresses to the domesticated females, and are generally received\r\nby them with great pleasure.” So that these females apparently prefer\r\nthe wild to their own males. (25. ‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. i.\r\np. 13. See to the same effect, Dr. Bryant, in Allen’s ‘Mammals and\r\nBirds of Florida,’ p. 344.)\r\n\r\nHere is a more curious case. Sir R. Heron during many years kept an\r\naccount of the habits of the peafowl, which he bred in large numbers.\r\nHe states that “the hens have frequently great preference to a\r\nparticular peafowl. They were all so fond of an old pied cock, that one\r\nyear, when he was confined, though still in view, they were constantly\r\nassembled close to the trellice-walls of his prison, and would not\r\nsuffer a japanned peacock to touch them. On his being let out in the\r\nautumn, the oldest of the hens instantly courted him and was successful\r\nin her courtship. The next year he was shut up in a stable, and then\r\nthe hens all courted his rival.” (26. ‘Proceedings, Zoological\r\nSociety,’ 1835, p. 54. The japanned peacock is considered by Mr.\r\nSclater as a distinct species, and has been named Pavo nigripennis; but\r\nthe evidence seems to me to show that it is only a variety.) This rival\r\nwas a japanned or black-winged peacock, to our eyes a more beautiful\r\nbird than the common kind.\r\n\r\nLichtenstein, who was a good observer and had excellent opportunities\r\nof observation at the Cape of Good Hope, assured Rudolphi that the\r\nfemale widow-bird (Chera progne) disowns the male when robbed of the\r\nlong tail-feathers with which he is ornamented during the\r\nbreeding-season. I presume that this observation must have been made on\r\nbirds under confinement. (27. Rudolphi, ‘Beiträge zur Anthropologie,’\r\n1812, s. 184.) Here is an analogous case; Dr. Jaeger (28. ‘Die\r\nDarwin’sche Theorie, und ihre Stellung zu Moral und Religion,’ 1869, s.\r\n59.), director of the Zoological Gardens of Vienna, states that a male\r\nsilver-pheasant, who had been triumphant over all other males and was\r\nthe accepted lover of the females, had his ornamental plumage spoiled.\r\nHe was then immediately superseded by a rival, who got the upper hand\r\nand afterwards led the flock.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, as shewing how important colour is in the\r\ncourtship of birds, that Mr. Boardman, a well-known collector and\r\nobserver of birds for many years in the Northern United States, has\r\nnever in his large experience seen an albino paired with another bird;\r\nyet he has had opportunities of observing many albinos belonging to\r\nseveral species. (29. This statement is given by Mr. A. Leith Adams, in\r\nhis ‘Field and Forest Rambles,’ 1873, p. 76, and accords with his own\r\nexperience.) It can hardly be maintained that albinos in a state of\r\nnature are incapable of breeding, as they can be raised with the\r\ngreatest facility under confinement. It appears, therefore, that we\r\nmust attribute the fact that they do not pair to their rejection by\r\ntheir normally coloured comrades.\r\n\r\nFemale birds not only exert a choice, but in some few cases they court\r\nthe male, or even fight together for his possession. Sir R. Heron\r\nstates that with peafowl, the first advances are always made by the\r\nfemale; something of the same kind takes place, according to Audubon,\r\nwith the older females of the wild turkey. With the capercailzie, the\r\nfemales flit round the male whilst he is parading at one of the places\r\nof assemblage, and solicit his attention. (30. In regard to peafowl,\r\nsee Sir R. Heron, ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1835, p. 54, and the Rev. E.S.\r\nDixon, ‘Ornamental Poultry,’ 1848, p. 8. For the turkey, Audubon, ibid.\r\np. 4. For the capercailzie, Lloyd, ‘Game Birds of Sweden,’ 1867, p.\r\n23.) We have seen that a tame wild-duck seduced an unwilling pintail\r\ndrake after a long courtship. Mr. Bartlett believes that the\r\nLophophorus, like many other gallinaceous birds, is naturally\r\npolygamous, but two females cannot be placed in the same cage with a\r\nmale, as they fight so much together. The following instance of rivalry\r\nis more surprising as it relates to bullfinches, which usually pair for\r\nlife. Mr. Jenner Weir introduced a dull-coloured and ugly female into\r\nhis aviary, and she immediately attacked another mated female so\r\nunmercifully that the latter had to be separated. The new female did\r\nall the courtship, and was at last successful, for she paired with the\r\nmale; but after a time she met with a just retribution, for, ceasing to\r\nbe pugnacious, she was replaced by the old female, and the male then\r\ndeserted his new and returned to his old love.\r\n\r\nIn all ordinary cases the male is so eager that he will accept any\r\nfemale, and does not, as far as we can judge, prefer one to the other;\r\nbut, as we shall hereafter see, exceptions to this rule apparently\r\noccur in some few groups. With domesticated birds, I have heard of only\r\none case of males shewing any preference for certain females, namely,\r\nthat of the domestic cock, who, according to the high authority of Mr.\r\nHewitt, prefers the younger to the older hens. On the other hand, in\r\neffecting hybrid unions between the male pheasant and common hens, Mr.\r\nHewitt is convinced that the pheasant invariably prefers the older\r\nbirds. He does not appear to be in the least influenced by their\r\ncolour; but “is most capricious in his attachments” (31. Mr. Hewitt,\r\nquoted in Tegetmeier’s ‘Poultry Book,’ 1866, p. 165.): from some\r\ninexplicable cause he shews the most determined aversion to certain\r\nhens, which no care on the part of the breeder can overcome. Mr. Hewitt\r\ninforms me that some hens are quite unattractive even to the males of\r\ntheir own species, so that they may be kept with several cocks during a\r\nwhole season, and not one egg out of forty or fifty will prove fertile.\r\nOn the other hand, with the long-tailed duck (Harelda glacialis), “it\r\nhas been remarked,” says M. Ekstrom, “that certain females are much\r\nmore courted than the rest. Frequently, indeed, one sees an individual\r\nsurrounded by six or eight amorous males.” Whether this statement is\r\ncredible, I know not; but the native sportsmen shoot these females in\r\norder to stuff them as decoys. (32. Quoted in Lloyd’s ‘Game Birds of\r\nSweden,’ p. 345.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to female birds feeling a preference for particular males,\r\nwe must bear in mind that we can judge of choice being exerted only by\r\nanalogy. If an inhabitant of another planet were to behold a number of\r\nyoung rustics at a fair courting a pretty girl, and quarrelling about\r\nher like birds at one of their places of assemblage, he would, by the\r\neagerness of the wooers to please her and to display their finery,\r\ninfer that she had the power of choice. Now with birds the evidence\r\nstands thus: they have acute powers of observation, and they seem to\r\nhave some taste for the beautiful both in colour and sound. It is\r\ncertain that the females occasionally exhibit, from unknown causes, the\r\nstrongest antipathies and preferences for particular males. When the\r\nsexes differ in colour or in other ornaments the males with rare\r\nexceptions are the more decorated, either permanently or temporarily\r\nduring the breeding-season. They sedulously display their various\r\nornaments, exert their voices, and perform strange antics in the\r\npresence of the females. Even well-armed males, who, it might be\r\nthought, would altogether depend for success on the law of battle, are\r\nin most cases highly ornamented; and their ornaments have been acquired\r\nat the expense of some loss of power. In other cases ornaments have\r\nbeen acquired, at the cost of increased risk from birds and beasts of\r\nprey. With various species many individuals of both sexes congregate at\r\nthe same spot, and their courtship is a prolonged affair. There is even\r\nreason to suspect that the males and females within the same district\r\ndo not always succeed in pleasing each other and pairing.\r\n\r\nWhat then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations? Does\r\nthe male parade his charms with so much pomp and rivalry for no\r\npurpose? Are we not justified in believing that the female exerts a\r\nchoice, and that she receives the addresses of the male who pleases her\r\nmost? It is not probable that she consciously deliberates; but she is\r\nmost excited or attracted by the most beautiful, or melodious, or\r\ngallant males. Nor need it be supposed that the female studies each\r\nstripe or spot of colour; that the peahen, for instance, admires each\r\ndetail in the gorgeous train of the peacock—she is probably struck only\r\nby the general effect. Nevertheless, after hearing how carefully the\r\nmale Argus pheasant displays his elegant primary wing-feathers, and\r\nerects his ocellated plumes in the right position for their full\r\neffect; or again, how the male goldfinch alternately displays his\r\ngold-bespangled wings, we ought not to feel too sure that the female\r\ndoes not attend to each detail of beauty. We can judge, as already\r\nremarked, of choice being exerted, only from analogy; and the mental\r\npowers of birds do not differ fundamentally from ours. From these\r\nvarious considerations we may conclude that the pairing of birds is not\r\nleft to chance; but that those males, which are best able by their\r\nvarious charms to please or excite the female, are under ordinary\r\ncircumstances accepted. If this be admitted, there is not much\r\ndifficulty in understanding how male birds have gradually acquired\r\ntheir ornamental characters. All animals present individual\r\ndifferences, and as man can modify his domesticated birds by selecting\r\nthe individuals which appear to him the most beautiful, so the habitual\r\nor even occasional preference by the female of the more attractive\r\nmales would almost certainly lead to their modification; and such\r\nmodifications might in the course of time be augmented to almost any\r\nextent, compatible with the existence of the species.\r\n\r\nVARIABILITY OF BIRDS, AND ESPECIALLY OF THEIR SECONDARY SEXUAL\r\nCHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nVariability and inheritance are the foundations for the work of\r\nselection. That domesticated birds have varied greatly, their\r\nvariations being inherited, is certain. That birds in a state of nature\r\nhave been modified into distinct races is now universally admitted.\r\n(33. According to Dr. Blasius (‘Ibis,’ vol. ii. 1860, p. 297), there\r\nare 425 indubitable species of birds which breed in Europe, besides\r\nsixty forms, which are frequently regarded as distinct species. Of the\r\nlatter, Blasius thinks that only ten are really doubtful, and that the\r\nother fifty ought to be united with their nearest allies; but this\r\nshews that there must be a considerable amount of variation with some\r\nof our European birds. It is also an unsettled point with naturalists,\r\nwhether several North American birds ought to be ranked as specifically\r\ndistinct from the corresponding European species. So again many North\r\nAmerican forms which until lately were named as distinct species, are\r\nnow considered to be local races.) Variations may be divided into two\r\nclasses; those which appear to our ignorance to arise spontaneously,\r\nand those which are directly related to the surrounding conditions, so\r\nthat all or nearly all the individuals of the same species are\r\nsimilarly modified. Cases of the latter kind have recently been\r\nobserved with care by Mr. J.A. Allen (34. ‘Mammals and Birds of East\r\nFlorida,’ also an ‘Ornithological Reconnaissance of Kansas,’ etc.\r\nNotwithstanding the influence of climate on the colours of birds, it is\r\ndifficult to account for the dull or dark tints of almost all the\r\nspecies inhabiting certain countries, for instance, the Galapagos\r\nIslands under the equator, the wide temperate plains of Patagonia, and,\r\nas it appears, Egypt (see Mr. Hartshorne in the ‘American Naturalist,’\r\n1873, p. 747). These countries are open, and afford little shelter to\r\nbirds; but it seems doubtful whether the absence of brightly coloured\r\nspecies can be explained on the principle of protection, for on the\r\nPampas, which are equally open, though covered by green grass, and\r\nwhere the birds would be equally exposed to danger, many brilliant and\r\nconspicuously coloured species are common. I have sometimes speculated\r\nwhether the prevailing dull tints of the scenery in the above named\r\ncountries may not have affected the appreciation of bright colours by\r\nthe birds inhabiting them.), who shews that in the United States many\r\nspecies of birds gradually become more strongly coloured in proceeding\r\nsouthward, and more lightly coloured in proceeding westward to the arid\r\nplains of the interior. Both sexes seem generally to be affected in a\r\nlike manner, but sometimes one sex more than the other. This result is\r\nnot incompatible with the belief that the colours of birds are mainly\r\ndue to the accumulation of successive variations through sexual\r\nselection; for even after the sexes have been greatly differentiated,\r\nclimate might produce an equal effect on both sexes, or a greater\r\neffect on one sex than on the other, owing to some constitutional\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIndividual differences between the members of the same species are\r\nadmitted by every one to occur under a state of nature. Sudden and\r\nstrongly marked variations are rare; it is also doubtful whether if\r\nbeneficial they would often be preserved through selection and\r\ntransmitted to succeeding generations. (35. ‘Origin of Species’ fifth\r\nedit. 1869, p.104. I had always perceived, that rare and\r\nstrongly-marked deviations of structure, deserving to be called\r\nmonstrosities, could seldom be preserved through natural selection, and\r\nthat the preservation of even highly-beneficial variations would depend\r\nto a certain extent on chance. I had also fully appreciated the\r\nimportance of mere individual differences, and this led me to insist so\r\nstrongly on the importance of that unconscious form of selection by\r\nman, which follows from the preservation of the most valued individuals\r\nof each breed, without any intention on his part to modify the\r\ncharacters of the breed. But until I read an able article in the ‘North\r\nBritish Review’ (March 1867, p. 289, et seq.), which has been of more\r\nuse to me than any other Review, I did not see how great the chances\r\nwere against the preservation of variations, whether slight or strongly\r\npronounced, occurring only in single individuals.) Nevertheless, it may\r\nbe worth while to give the few cases which I have been able to collect,\r\nrelating chiefly to colour,—simple albinism and melanism being\r\nexcluded. Mr. Gould is well known to admit the existence of few\r\nvarieties, for he esteems very slight differences as specific; yet he\r\nstates (36. ‘Introduction to the Trochlidae,’ p. 102.) that near Bogota\r\ncertain humming-birds belonging to the genus Cynanthus are divided into\r\ntwo or three races or varieties, which differ from each other in the\r\ncolouring of the tail—“some having the whole of the feathers blue,\r\nwhile others have the eight central ones tipped with beautiful green.”\r\nIt does not appear that intermediate gradations have been observed in\r\nthis or the following cases. In the males alone of one of the\r\nAustralian parrakeets “the thighs in some are scarlet, in others\r\ngrass-green.” In another parrakeet of the same country “some\r\nindividuals have the band across the wing-coverts bright-yellow, while\r\nin others the same part is tinged with red.” (37. Gould, ‘Handbook to\r\nBirds of Australia,’ vol. ii. pp. 32 and 68.) In the United States some\r\nfew of the males of the scarlet tanager (Tanagra rubra) have “a\r\nbeautiful transverse band of glowing red on the smaller wing-coverts”\r\n(38. Audubon, ‘Ornithological Biography,’ 1838, vol. iv. p. 389.); but\r\nthis variation seems to be somewhat rare, so that its preservation\r\nthrough sexual selection would follow only under usually favourable\r\ncircumstances. In Bengal the Honey buzzard (Pernis cristata) has either\r\na small rudimental crest on its head, or none at all: so slight a\r\ndifference, however, would not have been worth notice, had not this\r\nsame species possessed in Southern India a well-marked occipital crest\r\nformed of several graduated feathers.” (39. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’\r\nvol. i. p. 108; and Mr. Blyth, in ‘Land and Water,’ 1868, p. 381.)\r\n\r\nThe following case is in some respects more interesting. A pied variety\r\nof the raven, with the head, breast, abdomen, and parts of the wings\r\nand tail-feathers white, is confined to the Feroe Islands. It is not\r\nvery rare there, for Graba saw during his visit from eight to ten\r\nliving specimens. Although the characters of this variety are not quite\r\nconstant, yet it has been named by several distinguished ornithologists\r\nas a distinct species. The fact of the pied birds being pursued and\r\npersecuted with much clamour by the other ravens of the island was the\r\nchief cause which led Brunnich to conclude that they were specifically\r\ndistinct; but this is now known to be an error. (40. Graba, ‘Tagebuch\r\nReise nach Faro,’ 1830, ss. 51-54. Macgillivray, ‘History of British\r\nBirds,’ vol. iii. p. 745, ‘Ibis,’ vol. v. 1863, p. 469.) This case\r\nseems analogous to that lately given of albino birds not pairing from\r\nbeing rejected by their comrades.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the northern seas a remarkable variety of the\r\ncommon Guillemot (Uria troile) is found; and in Feroe, one out of every\r\nfive birds, according to Graba’s estimation, presents this variation.\r\nIt is characterised (41. Graba, ibid. s. 54. Macgillivray, ibid. vol.\r\nv. p. 327.) by a pure white ring round the eye, with a curved narrow\r\nwhite line, an inch and a half in length, extending back from the ring.\r\nThis conspicuous character has caused the bird to be ranked by several\r\nornithologists as a distinct species under the name of U. lacrymans,\r\nbut it is now known to be merely a variety. It often pairs with the\r\ncommon kind, yet intermediate gradations have never been seen; nor is\r\nthis surprising, for variations which appear suddenly, are often, as I\r\nhave elsewhere shewn (42. ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. p. 92.), transmitted either unaltered or not\r\nat all. We thus see that two distinct forms of the same species may\r\nco-exist in the same district, and we cannot doubt that if the one had\r\npossessed any advantage over the other, it would soon have been\r\nmultiplied to the exclusion of the latter. If, for instance, the male\r\npied ravens, instead of being persecuted by their comrades, had been\r\nhighly attractive (like the above pied peacock) to the black female\r\nravens their numbers would have rapidly increased. And this would have\r\nbeen a case of sexual selection.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the slight individual differences which are common, in\r\na greater or less degree, to all the members of the same species, we\r\nhave every reason to believe that they are by far the most important\r\nfor the work of selection. Secondary sexual characters are eminently\r\nliable to vary, both with animals in a state of nature and under\r\ndomestication. (43. On these points see also ‘Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants under Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 253; vol ii. pp. 73, 75.) There\r\nis also reason to believe, as we have seen in our eighth chapter, that\r\nvariations are more apt to occur in the male than in the female sex.\r\nAll these contingencies are highly favourable for sexual selection.\r\nWhether characters thus acquired are transmitted to one sex or to both\r\nsexes, depends, as we shall see in the following chapter, on the form\r\nof inheritance which prevails.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes difficult to form an opinion whether certain slight\r\ndifferences between the sexes of birds are simply the result of\r\nvariability with sexually-limited inheritance, without the aid of\r\nsexual selection, or whether they have been augmented through this\r\nlatter process. I do not here refer to the many instances where the\r\nmale displays splendid colours or other ornaments, of which the female\r\npartakes to a slight degree; for these are almost certainly due to\r\ncharacters primarily acquired by the male having been more or less\r\ntransferred to the female. But what are we to conclude with respect to\r\ncertain birds in which, for instance, the eyes differ slightly in\r\ncolour in the two sexes? (44. See, for instance, on the irides of a\r\nPodica and Gallicrex in ‘Ibis,’ vol. ii. 1860, p. 206; and vol. v.\r\n1863, p. 426.) In some cases the eyes differ conspicuously; thus with\r\nthe storks of the genus Xenorhynchus, those of the male are\r\nblackish-hazel, whilst those of the females are gamboge-yellow; with\r\nmany hornbills (Buceros), as I hear from Mr. Blyth (45. See also\r\nJerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. pp. 243-245.), the males have intense\r\ncrimson eyes, and those of the females are white. In the Buceros\r\nbicornis, the hind margin of the casque and a stripe on the crest of\r\nthe beak are black in the male, but not so in the female. Are we to\r\nsuppose that these black marks and the crimson colour of the eyes have\r\nbeen preserved or augmented through sexual selection in the males? This\r\nis very doubtful; for Mr. Bartlett shewed me in the Zoological Gardens\r\nthat the inside of the mouth of this Buceros is black in the male and\r\nflesh-coloured in the female; and their external appearance or beauty\r\nwould not be thus affected. I observed in Chile (46. ‘Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of H.M.S. “Beagle,”’ 1841, p. 6.) that the iris in the condor,\r\nwhen about a year old, is dark-brown, but changes at maturity into\r\nyellowish-brown in the male, and into bright red in the female. The\r\nmale has also a small, longitudinal, leaden-coloured, fleshy crest or\r\ncomb. The comb of many gallinaceous birds is highly ornamental, and\r\nassumes vivid colours during the act of courtship; but what are we to\r\nthink of the dull-coloured comb of the condor, which does not appear to\r\nus in the least ornamental? The same question may be asked in regard to\r\nvarious other characters, such as the knob on the base of the beak of\r\nthe Chinese goose (Anser cygnoides), which is much larger in the male\r\nthan in the female. No certain answer can be given to these questions;\r\nbut we ought to be cautious in assuming that knobs and various fleshy\r\nappendages cannot be attractive to the female, when we remember that\r\nwith savage races of man various hideous deformities—deep scars on the\r\nface with the flesh raised into protuberances, the septum of the nose\r\npierced by sticks or bones, holes in the ears and lips stretched widely\r\nopen—are all admired as ornamental.\r\n\r\nWhether or not unimportant differences between the sexes, such as those\r\njust specified, have been preserved through sexual selection, these\r\ndifferences, as well as all others, must primarily depend on the laws\r\nof variation. On the principle of correlated development, the plumage\r\noften varies on different parts of the body, or over the whole body, in\r\nthe same manner. We see this well illustrated in certain breeds of the\r\nfowl. In all the breeds the feathers on the neck and loins of the males\r\nare elongated, and are called hackles; now when both sexes acquire a\r\ntop-knot, which is a new character in the genus, the feathers on the\r\nhead of the male become hackle-shaped, evidently on the principle of\r\ncorrelation; whilst those on the head of the female are of the ordinary\r\nshape. The colour also of the hackles forming the top-knot of the male,\r\nis often correlated with that of the hackles on the neck and loins, as\r\nmay be seen by comparing these feathers in the golden and\r\nsilver-spangled Polish, the Houdans, and Creve-coeur breeds. In some\r\nnatural species we may observe exactly the same correlation in the\r\ncolours of these same feathers, as in the males of the splendid Gold\r\nand Amherst pheasants.\r\n\r\nThe structure of each individual feather generally causes any change in\r\nits colouring to be symmetrical; we see this in the various laced,\r\nspangled, and pencilled breeds of the fowl; and on the principle of\r\ncorrelation the feathers over the whole body are often coloured in the\r\nsame manner. We are thus enabled without much trouble to rear breeds\r\nwith their plumage marked almost as symmetrically as in natural\r\nspecies. In laced and spangled fowls the coloured margins of the\r\nfeathers are abruptly defined; but in a mongrel raised by me from a\r\nblack Spanish cock glossed with green, and a white game-hen, all the\r\nfeathers were greenish-black, excepting towards their extremities,\r\nwhich were yellowish-white; but between the white extremities and the\r\nblack bases, there was on each feather a symmetrical, curved zone of\r\ndark-brown. In some instances the shaft of the feather determines the\r\ndistribution of the tints; thus with the body-feathers of a mongrel\r\nfrom the same black Spanish cock and a silver-spangled Polish hen, the\r\nshaft, together with a narrow space on each side, was greenish-black,\r\nand this was surrounded by a regular zone of dark-brown, edged with\r\nbrownish-white. In these cases we have feathers symmetrically shaded,\r\nlike those which give so much elegance to the plumage of many natural\r\nspecies. I have also noticed a variety of the common pigeon with the\r\nwing-bars symmetrically zoned with three bright shades, instead of\r\nbeing simply black on a slaty-blue ground, as in the parent-species.\r\n\r\nIn many groups of birds the plumage is differently coloured in the\r\nseveral species, yet certain spots, marks, or stripes are retained by\r\nall. Analogous cases occur with the breeds of the pigeon, which usually\r\nretain the two wing-bars, though they may be coloured red, yellow,\r\nwhite, black, or blue, the rest of the plumage being of some wholly\r\ndifferent tint. Here is a more curious case, in which certain marks are\r\nretained, though coloured in a manner almost exactly the opposite of\r\nwhat is natural; the aboriginal pigeon has a blue tail, with the\r\nterminal halves of the outer webs of the two outer tail feathers white;\r\nnow there is a sub-variety having a white instead of a blue tail, with\r\nprecisely that part black which is white in the parent-species.

Cyllo leda, Linn., from a drawing by Mr. Trimen, shewing the\r\nextreme range of variation in the ocelli. A. Specimen, from Mauritius,\r\nupper surface of fore-wing. A1. Specimen, from Natal, ditto. B.\r\nSpecimen, from Java, upper surface of hind-wing. B1. Specimen, from\r\nMauritius, ditto.]\r\n\r\nAs no ornaments are more beautiful than the ocelli on the feathers of\r\nvarious birds, on the hairy coats of some mammals, on the scales of\r\nreptiles and fishes, on the skin of amphibians, on the wings of many\r\nLepidoptera and other insects, they deserve to be especially noticed.\r\nAn ocellus consists of a spot within a ring of another colour, like the\r\npupil within the iris, but the central spot is often surrounded by\r\nadditional concentric zones. The ocelli on the tail-coverts of the\r\npeacock offer a familiar example, as well as those on the wings of the\r\npeacock-butterfly (Vanessa). Mr. Trimen has given me a description of a\r\nS. African moth (Gynanisa isis), allied to our Emperor moth, in which a\r\nmagnificent ocellus occupies nearly the whole surface of each hinder\r\nwing; it consists of a black centre, including a semi-transparent\r\ncrescent-shaped mark, surrounded by successive, ochre-yellow, black,\r\nochre-yellow, pink, white, pink, brown, and whitish zones. Although we\r\ndo not know the steps by which these wonderfully beautiful and complex\r\nornaments have been developed, the process has probably been a simple\r\none, at least with insects; for, as Mr. Trimen writes to me, “no\r\ncharacters of mere marking or coloration are so unstable in the\r\nLepidoptera as the ocelli, both in number and size.” Mr. Wallace, who\r\nfirst called my attention to this subject, shewed me a series of\r\nspecimens of our common meadow-brown butterfly (Hipparchia janira)\r\nexhibiting numerous gradations from a simple minute black spot to an\r\nelegantly-shaded ocellus. In a S. African butterfly (Cyllo leda,\r\nLinn.), belonging to the same family, the ocelli are even still more\r\nvariable. In some specimens (A, Fig. 53) large spaces on the upper\r\nsurface of the wings are coloured black, and include irregular white\r\nmarks; and from this state a complete gradation can be traced into a\r\ntolerably perfect ocellus (A1), and this results from the contraction\r\nof the irregular blotches of colour. In another series of specimens a\r\ngradation can be followed from excessively minute white dots,\r\nsurrounded by a scarcely visible black line (B), into perfectly\r\nsymmetrical and large ocelli (B1). (48. This woodcut has been engraved\r\nfrom a beautiful drawing, most kindly made for me by Mr. Trimen; see\r\nalso his description of the wonderful amount of variation in the\r\ncoloration and shape of the wings of this butterfly, in his\r\n‘Rhopalocera Africae Australis,’ p. 186.) In cases like these, the\r\ndevelopment of a perfect ocellus does not require a long course of\r\nvariation and selection.\r\n\r\nWith birds and many other animals, it seems to follow from the\r\ncomparison of allied species that circular spots are often generated by\r\nthe breaking up and contraction of stripes. In the Tragopan pheasant\r\nfaint white lines in the female represent the beautiful white spots in\r\nthe male (49. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 517.); and\r\nsomething of the same kind may be observed in the two sexes of the\r\nArgus pheasant. However this may be, appearances strongly favour the\r\nbelief that on the one hand, a dark spot is often formed by the\r\ncolouring matter being drawn towards a central point from a surrounding\r\nzone, which latter is thus rendered lighter; and, on the other hand,\r\nthat a white spot is often formed by the colour being driven away from\r\na central point, so that it accumulates in a surrounding darker zone.\r\nIn either case an ocellus is the result. The colouring matter seems to\r\nbe a nearly constant quantity, but is redistributed, either\r\ncentripetally or centrifugally. The feathers of the common guinea-fowl\r\noffer a good instance of white spots surrounded by darker zones; and\r\nwherever the white spots are large and stand near each other, the\r\nsurrounding dark zones become confluent. In the same wing-feather of\r\nthe Argus pheasant dark spots may be seen surrounded by a pale zone,\r\nand white spots by a dark zone. Thus the formation of an ocellus in its\r\nmost elementary state appears to be a simple affair. By what further\r\nsteps the more complex ocelli, which are surrounded by many successive\r\nzones of colour, have been generated, I will not pretend to say. But\r\nthe zoned feathers of the mongrels from differently coloured fowls, and\r\nthe extraordinary variability of the ocelli on many Lepidoptera, lead\r\nus to conclude that their formation is not a complex process, but\r\ndepends on some slight and graduated change in the nature of the\r\nadjoining tissues.\r\n\r\nGRADATION OF SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 54. Feather of Peacock, about two-thirds of natural size, drawn\r\nby Mr. Ford. The transparent zone is represented by the outermost white\r\nzone, confined to the upper end of the disc.]\r\n\r\nCases of gradation are important, as shewing us that highly complex\r\nornaments may be acquired by small successive steps. In order to\r\ndiscover the actual steps by which the male of any existing bird has\r\nacquired his magnificent colours or other ornaments, we ought to behold\r\nthe long line of his extinct progenitors; but this is obviously\r\nimpossible. We may, however, generally gain a clue by comparing all the\r\nspecies of the same group, if it be a large one; for some of them will\r\nprobably retain, at least partially, traces of their former characters.\r\nInstead of entering on tedious details respecting various groups, in\r\nwhich striking instances of gradation could be given, it seems the best\r\nplan to take one or two strongly marked cases, for instance that of the\r\npeacock, in order to see if light can be thrown on the steps by which\r\nthis bird has become so splendidly decorated. The peacock is chiefly\r\nremarkable from the extraordinary length of his tail-coverts; the tail\r\nitself not being much elongated. The barbs along nearly the whole\r\nlength of these feathers stand separate or are decomposed; but this is\r\nthe case with the feathers of many species, and with some varieties of\r\nthe domestic fowl and pigeon. The barbs coalesce towards the extremity\r\nof the shaft forming the oval disc or ocellus, which is certainly one\r\nof the most beautiful objects in the world. It consists of an\r\niridescent, intensely blue, indented centre, surrounded by a rich green\r\nzone, this by a broad coppery-brown zone, and this by five other narrow\r\nzones of slightly different iridescent shades. A trifling character in\r\nthe disc deserves notice; the barbs, for a space along one of the\r\nconcentric zones are more or less destitute of their barbules, so that\r\na part of the disc is surrounded by an almost transparent zone, which\r\ngives it a highly finished aspect. But I have elsewhere described (50.\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 254.)\r\nan exactly analogous variation in the hackles of a sub-variety of the\r\ngame-cock, in which the tips, having a metallic lustre, “are separated\r\nfrom the lower part of the feather by a symmetrically shaped\r\ntransparent zone, composed of the naked portions of the barbs.” The\r\nlower margin or base of the dark-blue centre of the ocellus is deeply\r\nindented on the line of the shaft. The surrounding zones likewise shew\r\ntraces, as may be seen in the drawing (Fig. 54), of indentations, or\r\nrather breaks. These indentations are common to the Indian and Javan\r\npeacocks (Pavo cristatus and P. muticus); and they seem to deserve\r\nparticular attention, as probably connected with the development of the\r\nocellus; but for a long time I could not conjecture their meaning.\r\n\r\nIf we admit the principle of gradual evolution, there must formerly\r\nhave existed many species which presented every successive step between\r\nthe wonderfully elongated tail-coverts of the peacock and the short\r\ntail-coverts of all ordinary birds; and again between the magnificent\r\nocelli of the former, and the simpler ocelli or mere coloured spots on\r\nother birds; and so with all the other characters of the peacock. Let\r\nus look to the allied Gallinaceae for any still-existing gradations.\r\nThe species and sub-species of Polyplectron inhabit countries adjacent\r\nto the native land of the peacock; and they so far resemble this bird\r\nthat they are sometimes called peacock-pheasants. I am also informed by\r\nMr. Bartlett that they resemble the peacock in their voice and in some\r\nof their habits. During the spring the males, as previously described,\r\nstrut about before the comparatively plain-coloured females, expanding\r\nand erecting their tail and wing-feathers, which are ornamented with\r\nnumerous ocelli. I request the reader to turn back to the drawing (Fig.\r\n51) of a Polyplectron; In P. napoleonis the ocelli are confined to the\r\ntail, and the back is of a rich metallic blue; in which respects this\r\nspecies approaches the Java peacock. P. hardwickii possesses a peculiar\r\ntop-knot, which is also somewhat like that of the Java peacock. In all\r\nthe species the ocelli on the wings and tail are either circular or\r\noval, and consist of a beautiful, iridescent, greenish-blue or\r\ngreenish-purple disc, with a black border. This border in P. chinquis\r\nshades into brown, edged with cream colour, so that the ocellus is here\r\nsurrounded with variously shaded, though not bright, concentric zones.\r\nThe unusual length of the tail-coverts is another remarkable character\r\nin Polyplectron; for in some of the species they are half, and in\r\nothers two-thirds as long as the true tail-feathers. The tail-coverts\r\nare ocellated as in the peacock. Thus the several species of\r\nPolyplectron manifestly make a graduated approach to the peacock in the\r\nlength of their tail-coverts, in the zoning of the ocelli, and in some\r\nother characters.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 55. Part of a tail-covert of Polyplectron chinquis, with the two\r\nocelli of natural size.\r\n\r\nFig. 56. Part of a tail-covert of Polyplectron malaccense, with the two\r\nocelli, partially confluent, of natural size.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this approach, the first species of Polyplectron which\r\nI examined almost made me give up the search; for I found not only that\r\nthe true tail-feathers, which in the peacock are quite plain, were\r\nornamented with ocelli, but that the ocelli on all the feathers\r\ndiffered fundamentally from those of the peacock, in there being two on\r\nthe same feather (Fig. 55), one on each side of the shaft. Hence I\r\nconcluded that the early progenitors of the peacock could not have\r\nresembled a Polyplectron. But on continuing my search, I observed that\r\nin some of the species the two ocelli stood very near each other; that\r\nin the tail-feathers of P. hardwickii they touched each other; and,\r\nfinally, that on the tail-coverts of this same species as well as of P.\r\nmalaccense (Fig. 56) they were actually confluent. As the central part\r\nalone is confluent, an indentation is left at both the upper and lower\r\nends; and the surrounding coloured zones are likewise indented. A\r\nsingle ocellus is thus formed on each tail-covert, though still plainly\r\nbetraying its double origin. These confluent ocelli differ from the\r\nsingle ocelli of the peacock in having an indentation at both ends,\r\ninstead of only at the lower or basal end. The explanation, however, of\r\nthis difference is not difficult; in some species of Polyplectron the\r\ntwo oval ocelli on the same feather stand parallel to each other; in\r\nother species (as in P. chinquis) they converge towards one end; now\r\nthe partial confluence of two convergent ocelli would manifestly leave\r\na much deeper indentation at the divergent than at the convergent end.\r\nIt is also manifest that if the convergence were strongly pronounced\r\nand the confluence complete, the indentation at the convergent end\r\nwould tend to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe tail-feathers in both species of the peacock are entirely destitute\r\nof ocelli, and this apparently is related to their being covered up and\r\nconcealed by the long tail-coverts. In this respect they differ\r\nremarkably from the tail-feathers of Polyplectron, which in most of the\r\nspecies are ornamented with larger ocelli than those on the\r\ntail-coverts. Hence I was led carefully to examine the tail-feathers of\r\nthe several species, in order to discover whether their ocelli shewed\r\nany tendency to disappear; and to my great satisfaction, this appeared\r\nto be so. The central tail-feathers of P. napoleonis have the two\r\nocelli on each side of the shaft perfectly developed; but the inner\r\nocellus becomes less and less conspicuous on the more exterior\r\ntail-feathers, until a mere shadow or rudiment is left on the inner\r\nside of the outermost feather. Again, in P. malaccense, the ocelli on\r\nthe tail-coverts are, as we have seen, confluent; and these feathers\r\nare of unusual length, being two-thirds of the length of the\r\ntail-feathers, so that in both these respects they approach the\r\ntail-coverts of the peacock. Now in P. malaccense, the two central\r\ntail-feathers alone are ornamented, each with two brightly-coloured\r\nocelli, the inner ocellus having completely disappeared from all the\r\nother tail-feathers. Consequently the tail-coverts and tail-feathers of\r\nthis species of Polyplectron make a near approach in structure and\r\nornamentation to the corresponding feathers of the peacock.\r\n\r\nAs far, then, as gradation throws light on the steps by which the\r\nmagnificent train of the peacock has been acquired, hardly anything\r\nmore is needed. If we picture to ourselves a progenitor of the peacock\r\nin an almost exactly intermediate condition between the existing\r\npeacock, with his enormously elongated tail-coverts, ornamented with\r\nsingle ocelli, and an ordinary gallinaceous bird with short\r\ntail-coverts, merely spotted with some colour, we shall see a bird\r\nallied to Polyplectron—that is, with tail-coverts, capable of erection\r\nand expansion, ornamented with two partially confluent ocelli, and long\r\nenough almost to conceal the tail-feathers, the latter having already\r\npartially lost their ocelli. The indentation of the central disc and of\r\nthe surrounding zones of the ocellus, in both species of peacock,\r\nspeaks plainly in favour of this view, and is otherwise inexplicable.\r\nThe males of Polyplectron are no doubt beautiful birds, but their\r\nbeauty, when viewed from a little distance, cannot be compared with\r\nthat of the peacock. Many female progenitors of the peacock must,\r\nduring a long line of descent, have appreciated this superiority; for\r\nthey have unconsciously, by the continued preference for the most\r\nbeautiful males, rendered the peacock the most splendid of living\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nARGUS PHEASANT.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent case for investigation is offered by the ocelli on\r\nthe wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant, which are shaded in so\r\nwonderful a manner as to resemble balls lying loose within sockets, and\r\nconsequently differ from ordinary ocelli. No one, I presume, will\r\nattribute the shading, which has excited the admiration of many\r\nexperienced artists, to chance—to the fortuitous concourse of atoms of\r\ncolouring matter. That these ornaments should have been formed through\r\nthe selection of many successive variations, not one of which was\r\noriginally intended to produce the ball-and-socket effect, seems as\r\nincredible as that one of Raphael’s Madonnas should have been formed by\r\nthe selection of chance daubs of paint made by a long succession of\r\nyoung artists, not one of whom intended at first to draw the human\r\nfigure. In order to discover how the ocelli have been developed, we\r\ncannot look to a long line of progenitors, nor to many closely-allied\r\nforms, for such do not now exist. But fortunately the several feathers\r\non the wing suffice to give us a clue to the problem, and they prove to\r\ndemonstration that a gradation is at least possible from a mere spot to\r\na finished ball-and-socket ocellus.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 57. Part of secondary wing-feather of Argus pheasant, shewing two\r\nperfect ocelli, a and b. A, B, C, D, etc., are dark stripes running\r\nobliquely down, each to an ocellus. [Much of the web on both sides,\r\nespecially to the left of the shaft, has been cut off.]\r\n\r\nFig.59. Portion of one of the secondary wing-feathers near to the body,\r\nshewing the so-called elliptic ornaments.

Lowest spot or mark in row B. c. The next succeeding spot\r\nor mark in the same row. d. Apparently a broken prolongation of the\r\nspot c. in the same row B.]\r\n\r\nThe wing-feathers, bearing the ocelli, are covered with dark stripes\r\n(Fig. 57) or with rows of dark spots (Fig. 59), each stripe or row of\r\nspots running obliquely down the outer side of the shaft to one of the\r\nocelli. The spots are generally elongated in a line transverse to the\r\nrow in which they stand. They often become confluent either in the line\r\nof the row—and then they form a longitudinal stripe—or transversely,\r\nthat is, with the spots in the adjoining rows, and then they form\r\ntransverse stripes. A spot sometimes breaks up into smaller spots,\r\nwhich still stand in their proper places.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient first to describe a perfect ball-and-socket\r\nocellus. This consists of an intensely black circular ring, surrounding\r\na space shaded so as exactly to resemble a ball. The figure here given\r\nhas been admirably drawn by Mr. Ford and well engraved, but a woodcut\r\ncannot exhibit the exquisite shading of the original. The ring is\r\nalmost always slightly broken or interrupted (Fig. 57) at a point in\r\nthe upper half, a little to the right of and above the white shade on\r\nthe enclosed ball; it is also sometimes broken towards the base on the\r\nright hand. These little breaks have an important meaning. The ring is\r\nalways much thickened, with the edges ill-defined towards the left-hand\r\nupper corner, the feather being held erect, in the position in which it\r\nis here drawn. Beneath this thickened part there is on the surface of\r\nthe ball an oblique almost pure-white mark, which shades off downwards\r\ninto a pale-leaden hue, and this into yellowish and brown tints, which\r\ninsensibly become darker and darker towards the lower part of the ball.\r\nIt is this shading which gives so admirably the effect of light shining\r\non a convex surface. If one of the balls be examined, it will be seen\r\nthat the lower part is of a brown tint and is indistinctly separated by\r\na curved oblique line from the upper part, which is yellower and more\r\nleaden; this curved oblique line runs at right angles to the longer\r\naxis of the white patch of light, and indeed of all the shading; but\r\nthis difference in colour, which cannot of course be shewn in the\r\nwoodcut, does not in the least interfere with the perfect shading of\r\nthe ball. It should be particularly observed that each ocellus stands\r\nin obvious connection either with a dark stripe, or with a longitudinal\r\nrow of dark spots, for both occur indifferently on the same feather.\r\nThus in Fig. 57 stripe A runs to ocellus a; B runs to ocellus b; stripe\r\nC is broken in the upper part, and runs down to the next succeeding\r\nocellus, not represented in the woodcut; D to the next lower one, and\r\nso with the stripes E and F. Lastly, the several ocelli are separated\r\nfrom each other by a pale surface bearing irregular black marks.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 58. Basal part of the secondary wing feather, nearest to the\r\nbody.]\r\n\r\nI will next describe the other extreme of the series, namely, the first\r\ntrace of an ocellus. The short secondary wing-feather (Fig. 58),\r\nnearest to the body, is marked like the other feathers, with oblique,\r\nlongitudinal, rather irregular, rows of very dark spots. The basal\r\nspot, or that nearest the shaft, in the five lower rows (excluding the\r\nlowest one) is a little larger than the other spots of the same row,\r\nand a little more elongated in a transverse direction. It differs also\r\nfrom the other spots by being bordered on its upper side with some dull\r\nfulvous shading. But this spot is not in any way more remarkable than\r\nthose on the plumage of many birds, and might easily be overlooked. The\r\nnext higher spot does not differ at all from the upper ones in the same\r\nrow. The larger basal spots occupy exactly the same relative position\r\non these feathers as do the perfect ocelli on the longer wing-feathers.\r\n\r\nBy looking to the next two or three succeeding wing-feathers, an\r\nabsolutely insensible gradation can be traced from one of the\r\nlast-described basal spots, together with the next higher one in the\r\nsame row, to a curious ornament, which cannot be called an ocellus, and\r\nwhich I will name, from the want of a better term, an “elliptic\r\nornament.” These are shewn in the accompanying figure (Fig. 59). We\r\nhere see several oblique rows, A, B, C, D, etc. (see the lettered\r\ndiagram on the right hand), of dark spots of the usual character. Each\r\nrow of spots runs down to and is connected with one of the elliptic\r\nornaments, in exactly the same manner as each stripe in Fig. 57 runs\r\ndown to and is connected with one of the ball-and-socket ocelli.\r\nLooking to any one row, for instance, B, in Fig. 59, the lowest mark\r\n(b) is thicker and considerably longer than the upper spots, and has\r\nits left extremity pointed and curved upwards. This black mark is\r\nabruptly bordered on its upper side by a rather broad space of richly\r\nshaded tints, beginning with a narrow brown zone, which passes into\r\norange, and this into a pale leaden tint, with the end towards the\r\nshaft much paler. These shaded tints together fill up the whole inner\r\nspace of the elliptic ornament. The mark (b) corresponds in every\r\nrespect with the basal shaded spot of the simple feather described in\r\nthe last paragraph (Fig. 58), but is more highly developed and more\r\nbrightly coloured. Above and to the right of this spot (b, Fig. 59),\r\nwith its bright shading, there is a long narrow, black mark (c),\r\nbelonging to the same row, and which is arched a little downwards so as\r\nto face (b). This mark is sometimes broken into two portions. It is\r\nalso narrowly edged on the lower side with a fulvous tint. To the left\r\nof and above c, in the same oblique direction, but always more or less\r\ndistinct from it, there is another black mark (d). This mark is\r\ngenerally sub-triangular and irregular in shape, but in the one\r\nlettered in the diagram it is unusually narrow, elongated, and regular.\r\nIt apparently consists of a lateral and broken prolongation of the mark\r\n(c), together with its confluence with a broken and prolonged part of\r\nthe next spot above; but I do not feel sure of this. These three marks,\r\nb, c, and d, with the intervening bright shades, form together the\r\nso-called elliptic ornament. These ornaments placed parallel to the\r\nshaft, manifestly correspond in position with the ball-and-socket\r\nocelli. Their extremely elegant appearance cannot be appreciated in the\r\ndrawing, as the orange and leaden tints, contrasting so well with the\r\nblack marks, cannot be shewn.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 60. An ocellus in an intermediate condition between the elliptic\r\nornament and the perfect ball-and-socket ocellus.]\r\n\r\nBetween one of the elliptic ornaments and a perfect ball-and-socket\r\nocellus, the gradation is so perfect that it is scarcely possible to\r\ndecide when the latter term ought to be used. The passage from the one\r\ninto the other is effected by the elongation and greater curvature in\r\nopposite directions of the lower black mark (b, Fig. 59), and more\r\nespecially of the upper one (c), together with the contraction of the\r\nelongated sub-triangular or narrow mark (d), so that at last these\r\nthree marks become confluent, forming an irregular elliptic ring. This\r\nring is gradually rendered more and more circular and regular,\r\nincreasing at the same time in diameter. I have here given a drawing\r\n(Fig. 60) of the natural size of an ocellus not as yet quite perfect.\r\nThe lower part of the black ring is much more curved than is the lower\r\nmark in the elliptic ornament (b, Fig. 59). The upper part of the ring\r\nconsists of two or three separate portions; and there is only a trace\r\nof the thickening of the portion which forms the black mark above the\r\nwhite shade. This white shade itself is not as yet much concentrated;\r\nand beneath it the surface is brighter coloured than in a perfect\r\nball-and-socket ocellus. Even in the most perfect ocelli traces of the\r\njunction of three or four elongated black marks, by which the ring has\r\nbeen formed, may often be detected. The irregular sub-triangular or\r\nnarrow mark (d, Fig. 59), manifestly forms, by its contraction and\r\nequalisation, the thickened portion of the ring above the white shade\r\non a perfect ball-and-socket ocellus. The lower part of the ring is\r\ninvariably a little thicker than the other parts (Fig. 57), and this\r\nfollows from the lower black mark of the elliptic ornament (b, Fig. 59)\r\nhaving originally been thicker than the upper mark (c). Every step can\r\nbe followed in the process of confluence and modification; and the\r\nblack ring which surrounds the ball of the ocellus is unquestionably\r\nformed by the union and modification of the three black marks, b, c, d,\r\nof the elliptic ornament. The irregular zigzag black marks between the\r\nsuccessive ocelli (Fig. 57) are plainly due to the breaking up of the\r\nsomewhat more regular but similar marks between the elliptic ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe successive steps in the shading of the ball-and-socket ocelli can\r\nbe followed out with equal clearness. The brown, orange, and\r\npale-leadened narrow zones, which border the lower black mark of the\r\nelliptic ornament, can be seen gradually to become more and more\r\nsoftened and shaded into each other, with the upper lighter part\r\ntowards the left-hand corner rendered still lighter, so as to become\r\nalmost white, and at the same time more contracted. But even in the\r\nmost perfect ball-and-socket ocelli a slight difference in the tints,\r\nthough not in the shading, between the upper and lower parts of the\r\nball can be perceived, as before noticed; and the line of separation is\r\noblique, in the same direction as the bright coloured shades of the\r\nelliptic ornaments. Thus almost every minute detail in the shape and\r\ncolouring of the ball-and-socket ocelli can be shewn to follow from\r\ngradual changes in the elliptic ornaments; and the development of the\r\nlatter can be traced by equally small steps from the union of two\r\nalmost simple spots, the lower one (Fig. 58) having some dull fulvous\r\nshading on its upper side.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 61. Portion near summit of one of the secondary wing-feathers,\r\nbearing perfect ball-and-socket ocelli. a. Ornamented upper part. b.\r\nUppermost, imperfect ball-and-socket ocellus. (The shading above the\r\nwhite mark on the summit of the ocellus is here a little too dark.) c.\r\nPerfect ocellus.]\r\n\r\nThe extremities of the longer secondary feathers which bear the perfect\r\nball-and-socket ocelli, are peculiarly ornamented (Fig. 61). The\r\noblique longitudinal stripes suddenly cease upwards and become\r\nconfused; and above this limit the whole upper end of the feather (a)\r\nis covered with white dots, surrounded by little black rings, standing\r\non a dark ground. The oblique stripe belonging to the uppermost ocellus\r\n(b) is barely represented by a very short irregular black mark with the\r\nusual, curved, transverse base. As this stripe is thus abruptly cut\r\noff, we can perhaps understand from what has gone before, how it is\r\nthat the upper thickened part of the ring is here absent; for, as\r\nbefore stated, this thickened part apparently stands in some relation\r\nwith a broken prolongation from the next higher spot. From the absence\r\nof the upper and thickened part of the ring, the uppermost ocellus,\r\nthough perfect in all other respects, appears as if its top had been\r\nobliquely sliced off. It would, I think, perplex any one, who believes\r\nthat the plumage of the Argus pheasant was created as we now see it, to\r\naccount for the imperfect condition of the uppermost ocellus. I should\r\nadd that on the secondary wing-feather farthest from the body all the\r\nocelli are smaller and less perfect than on the other feathers, and\r\nhave the upper part of the ring deficient, as in the case just\r\nmentioned. The imperfection here seems to be connected with the fact\r\nthat the spots on this feather shew less tendency than usual to become\r\nconfluent into stripes; they are, on the contrary, often broken up into\r\nsmaller spots, so that two or three rows run down to the same ocellus.\r\n\r\nThere still remains another very curious point, first observed by Mr.\r\nT.W. Wood (51. The ‘Field,’ May 28, 1870.), which deserves attention.\r\nIn a photograph, given me by Mr. Ward, of a specimen mounted as in the\r\nact of display, it may be seen that on the feathers which are held\r\nperpendicularly, the white marks on the ocelli, representing light\r\nreflected from a convex surface, are at the upper or further end, that\r\nis, are directed upwards; and the bird whilst displaying himself on the\r\nground would naturally be illuminated from above. But here comes the\r\ncurious point; the outer feathers are held almost horizontally, and\r\ntheir ocelli ought likewise to appear as if illuminated from above, and\r\nconsequently the white marks ought to be placed on the upper sides of\r\nthe ocelli; and, wonderful as is the fact, they are thus placed! Hence\r\nthe ocelli on the several feathers, though occupying very different\r\npositions with respect to the light, all appear as if illuminated from\r\nabove, just as an artist would have shaded them. Nevertheless they are\r\nnot illuminated from strictly the same point as they ought to be; for\r\nthe white marks on the ocelli of the feathers which are held almost\r\nhorizontally, are placed rather too much towards the further end; that\r\nis, they are not sufficiently lateral. We have, however, no right to\r\nexpect absolute perfection in a part rendered ornamental through sexual\r\nselection, any more than we have in a part modified through natural\r\nselection for real use; for instance, in that wondrous organ the human\r\neye. And we know what Helmholtz, the highest authority in Europe on the\r\nsubject, has said about the human eye; that if an optician had sold him\r\nan instrument so carelessly made, he would have thought himself fully\r\njustified in returning it. (52. ‘Popular Lectures on Scientific\r\nSubjects,’ Eng. trans. 1873, pp. 219, 227, 269, 390.)\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that a perfect series can be followed, from simple\r\nspots to the wonderful ball-and-socket ornaments. Mr. Gould, who kindly\r\ngave me some of these feathers, fully agrees with me in the\r\ncompleteness of the gradation. It is obvious that the stages in\r\ndevelopment exhibited by the feathers on the same bird do not at all\r\nnecessarily shew us the steps passed through by the extinct progenitors\r\nof the species; but they probably give us the clue to the actual steps,\r\nand they at least prove to demonstration that a gradation is possible.\r\nBearing in mind how carefully the male Argus pheasant displays his\r\nplumes before the female, as well as the many facts rendering it\r\nprobable that female birds prefer the more attractive males, no one who\r\nadmits the agency of sexual selection in any case will deny that a\r\nsimple dark spot with some fulvous shading might be converted, through\r\nthe approximation and modification of two adjoining spots, together\r\nwith some slight increase of colour, into one of the so-called elliptic\r\nornaments. These latter ornaments have been shewn to many persons, and\r\nall have admitted that they are beautiful, some thinking them even more\r\nso than the ball-and-socket ocelli. As the secondary plumes became\r\nlengthened through sexual selection, and as the elliptic ornaments\r\nincreased in diameter, their colours apparently became less bright; and\r\nthen the ornamentation of the plumes had to be gained by an improvement\r\nin the pattern and shading; and this process was carried on until the\r\nwonderful ball-and-socket ocelli were finally developed. Thus we can\r\nunderstand—and in no other way as it seems to me—the present condition\r\nand origin of the ornaments on the wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant.\r\n\r\nFrom the light afforded by the principle of gradation—from what we know\r\nof the laws of variation—from the changes which have taken place in\r\nmany of our domesticated birds—and, lastly, from the character (as we\r\nshall hereafter see more clearly) of the immature plumage of young\r\nbirds—we can sometimes indicate, with a certain amount of confidence,\r\nthe probable steps by which the males have acquired their brilliant\r\nplumage and various ornaments; yet in many cases we are involved in\r\ncomplete darkness. Mr. Gould several years ago pointed out to me a\r\nhumming-bird, the Urosticte benjamini, remarkable for the curious\r\ndifferences between the sexes. The male, besides a splendid gorget, has\r\ngreenish-black tail-feathers, with the four CENTRAL ones tipped with\r\nwhite; in the female, as with most of the allied species, the three\r\nOUTER tail-feathers on each side are tipped with white, so that the\r\nmale has the four central, whilst the female has the six exterior\r\nfeathers ornamented with white tips. What makes the case more curious\r\nis that, although the colouring of the tail differs remarkably in both\r\nsexes of many kinds of humming-birds, Mr. Gould does not know a single\r\nspecies, besides the Urosticte, in which the male has the four central\r\nfeathers tipped with white.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll, in commenting on this case (53. ‘The Reign of Law,’\r\n1867, p. 247.), passes over sexual selection, and asks, “What\r\nexplanation does the law of natural selection give of such specific\r\nvarieties as these?” He answers “none whatever”; and I quite agree with\r\nhim. But can this be so confidently said of sexual selection? Seeing in\r\nhow many ways the tail-feathers of humming-birds differ, why should not\r\nthe four central feathers have varied in this one species alone, so as\r\nto have acquired white tips? The variations may have been gradual, or\r\nsomewhat abrupt as in the case recently given of the humming-birds near\r\nBogota, in which certain individuals alone have the “central\r\ntail-feathers tipped with beautiful green.” In the female of the\r\nUrosticte I noticed extremely minute or rudimental white tips to the\r\ntwo outer of the four central black tail-feathers; so that here we have\r\nan indication of change of some kind in the plumage of this species. If\r\nwe grant the possibility of the central tail-feathers of the male\r\nvarying in whiteness, there is nothing strange in such variations\r\nhaving been sexually selected. The white tips, together with the small\r\nwhite ear-tufts, certainly add, as the Duke of Argyll admits, to the\r\nbeauty of the male; and whiteness is apparently appreciated by other\r\nbirds, as may be inferred from such cases as the snow-white male of the\r\nBell-bird. The statement made by Sir R. Heron should not be forgotten,\r\nnamely, that his peahens, when debarred from access to the pied\r\npeacock, would not unite with any other male, and during that season\r\nproduced no offspring. Nor is it strange that variations in the\r\ntail-feathers of the Urosticte should have been specially selected for\r\nthe sake of ornament, for the next succeeding genus in the family takes\r\nits name of Metallura from the splendour of these feathers. We have,\r\nmoreover, good evidence that humming-birds take especial pains in\r\ndisplaying their tail-feathers; Mr. Belt (54. ‘The Naturalist in\r\nNicaragua,’ 1874, p. 112.), after describing the beauty of the\r\nFlorisuga mellivora, says, “I have seen the female sitting on a branch,\r\nand two males displaying their charms in front of her. One would shoot\r\nup like a rocket, then suddenly expanding the snow-white tail, like an\r\ninverted parachute, slowly descend in front of her, turning round\r\ngradually to shew off back and front...The expanded white tail covered\r\nmore space than all the rest of the bird, and was evidently the grand\r\nfeature in the performance. Whilst one male was descending, the other\r\nwould shoot up and come slowly down expanded. The entertainment would\r\nend in a fight between the two performers; but whether the most\r\nbeautiful or the most pugnacious was the accepted suitor, I know not.”\r\nMr. Gould, after describing the peculiar plumage of the Urosticte,\r\nadds, “that ornament and variety is the sole object, I have myself but\r\nlittle doubt.” (55. ‘Introduction to the Trochilidae,’ 1861, p. 110.)\r\nIf this be admitted, we can perceive that the males which during former\r\ntimes were decked in the most elegant and novel manner would have\r\ngained an advantage, not in the ordinary struggle for life, but in\r\nrivalry with other males, and would have left a larger number of\r\noffspring to inherit their newly-acquired beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nBIRDS—continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion as to why the males alone of some species, and both sexes of\r\nothers, are brightly coloured—On sexually-limited inheritance, as\r\napplied to various structures and to brightly-coloured\r\nplumage—Nidification in relation to colour—Loss of nuptial plumage\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\nWe have in this chapter to consider why the females of many birds have\r\nnot acquired the same ornaments as the male; and why, on the other\r\nhand, both sexes of many other birds are equally, or almost equally,\r\nornamented? In the following chapter we shall consider the few cases in\r\nwhich the female is more conspicuously coloured than the male.\r\n\r\nIn my ‘Origin of Species’ (1. Fourth edition, 1866, p. 241.) I briefly\r\nsuggested that the long tail of the peacock would be inconvenient and\r\nthe conspicuous black colour of the male capercailzie dangerous, to the\r\nfemale during the period of incubation: and consequently that the\r\ntransmission of these characters from the male to the female offspring\r\nhad been checked through natural selection. I still think that this may\r\nhave occurred in some few instances: but after mature reflection on all\r\nthe facts which I have been able to collect, I am now inclined to\r\nbelieve that when the sexes differ, the successive variations have\r\ngenerally been from the first limited in their transmission to the same\r\nsex in which they first arose. Since my remarks appeared, the subject\r\nof sexual coloration has been discussed in some very interesting papers\r\nby Mr. Wallace (2. ‘Westminster Review,’ July 1867. ‘Journal of\r\nTravel,’ vol. i. 1868, p. 73.), who believes that in almost all cases\r\nthe successive variations tended at first to be transmitted equally to\r\nboth sexes; but that the female was saved, through natural selection,\r\nfrom acquiring the conspicuous colours of the male, owing to the danger\r\nwhich she would thus have incurred during incubation.\r\n\r\nThis view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point,\r\nnamely, whether the transmission of a character, which is at first\r\ninherited by both sexes can be subsequently limited in its transmission\r\nto one sex alone by means of natural selection. We must bear in mind,\r\nas shewn in the preliminary chapter on sexual selection, that\r\ncharacters which are limited in their development to one sex are always\r\nlatent in the other. An imaginary illustration will best aid us in\r\nseeing the difficulty of the case; we may suppose that a fancier wished\r\nto make a breed of pigeons, in which the males alone should be coloured\r\nof a pale blue, whilst the females retained their former slaty tint. As\r\nwith pigeons characters of all kinds are usually transmitted to both\r\nsexes equally, the fancier would have to try to convert this latter\r\nform of inheritance into sexually-limited transmission. All that he\r\ncould do would be to persevere in selecting every male pigeon which was\r\nin the least degree of a paler blue; and the natural result of this\r\nprocess, if steadily carried on for a long time, and if the pale\r\nvariations were strongly inherited or often recurred, would be to make\r\nhis whole stock of a lighter blue. But our fancier would be compelled\r\nto match, generation after generation, his pale blue males with slaty\r\nfemales, for he wishes to keep the latter of this colour. The result\r\nwould generally be the production either of a mongrel piebald lot, or\r\nmore probably the speedy and complete loss of the pale-blue tint; for\r\nthe primordial slaty colour would be transmitted with prepotent force.\r\nSupposing, however, that some pale-blue males and slaty females were\r\nproduced during each successive generation, and were always crossed\r\ntogether, then the slaty females would have, if I may use the\r\nexpression, much blue blood in their veins, for their fathers,\r\ngrandfathers, etc., will all have been blue birds. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is conceivable (though I know of no distinct facts\r\nrendering it probable) that the slaty females might acquire so strong a\r\nlatent tendency to pale-blueness, that they would not destroy this\r\ncolour in their male offspring, their female offspring still inheriting\r\nthe slaty tint. If so, the desired end of making a breed with the two\r\nsexes permanently different in colour might be gained.\r\n\r\nThe extreme importance, or rather necessity in the above case of the\r\ndesired character, namely, pale-blueness, being present though in a\r\nlatent state in the female, so that the male offspring should not be\r\ndeteriorated, will be best appreciated as follows: the male of\r\nSoemmerring’s pheasant has a tail thirty-seven inches in length, whilst\r\nthat of the female is only eight inches; the tail of the male common\r\npheasant is about twenty inches, and that of the female twelve inches\r\nlong. Now if the female Soemmerring pheasant with her SHORT tail were\r\ncrossed with the male common pheasant, there can be no doubt that the\r\nmale hybrid offspring would have a much LONGER tail than that of the\r\npure offspring of the common pheasant. On the other hand, if the female\r\ncommon pheasant, with a tail much longer than that of the female\r\nSoemmerring pheasant, were crossed with the male of the latter, the\r\nmale hybrid offspring would have a much SHORTER tail than that of the\r\npure offspring of Soemmerring’s pheasant. (3. Temminck says that the\r\ntail of the female Phasianus Soemmerringii is only six inches long,\r\n‘Planches coloriees,’ vol. v. 1838, pp. 487 and 488: the measurements\r\nabove given were made for me by Mr. Sclater. For the common pheasant,\r\nsee Macgillivray, ‘History of British Birds,’ vol. i. pp. 118-121.)\r\n\r\nOur fancier, in order to make his new breed with the males of a\r\npale-blue tint, and the females unchanged, would have to continue\r\nselecting the males during many generations; and each stage of paleness\r\nwould have to be fixed in the males, and rendered latent in the\r\nfemales. The task would be an extremely difficult one, and has never\r\nbeen tried, but might possibly be successfully carried out. The chief\r\nobstacle would be the early and complete loss of the pale-blue tint,\r\nfrom the necessity of reiterated crosses with the slaty female, the\r\nlatter not having at first any LATENT tendency to produce pale-blue\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if one or two males were to vary ever so slightly in\r\npaleness, and the variations were from the first limited in their\r\ntransmission to the male sex, the task of making a new breed of the\r\ndesired kind would be easy, for such males would simply have to be\r\nselected and matched with ordinary females. An analogous case has\r\nactually occurred, for there are breeds of the pigeon in Belgium (4.\r\nDr. Chapuis, ‘Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge,’ 1865, p. 87.) in which the\r\nmales alone are marked with black striae. So again Mr. Tegetmeier has\r\nrecently shewn (5. The ‘Field,’ Sept. 1872.) that dragons not rarely\r\nproduce silver-coloured birds, which are almost always hens; and he\r\nhimself has bred ten such females. It is on the other hand a very\r\nunusual event when a silver male is produced; so that nothing would be\r\neasier, if desired, than to make a breed of dragons with blue males and\r\nsilver females. This tendency is indeed so strong that when Mr.\r\nTegetmeier at last got a silver male and matched him with one of the\r\nsilver females, he expected to get a breed with both sexes thus\r\ncoloured; he was however disappointed, for the young male reverted to\r\nthe blue colour of his grandfather, the young female alone being\r\nsilver. No doubt with patience this tendency to reversion in the males,\r\nreared from an occasional silver male matched with a silver hen, might\r\nbe eliminated, and then both sexes would be coloured alike; and this\r\nvery process has been followed with success by Mr. Esquilant in the\r\ncase of silver turbits.\r\n\r\nWith fowls, variations of colour, limited in their transmission to the\r\nmale sex, habitually occur. When this form of inheritance prevails, it\r\nmight well happen that some of the successive variations would be\r\ntransferred to the female, who would then slightly resemble the male,\r\nas actually occurs in some breeds. Or again, the greater number, but\r\nnot all, of the successive steps might be transferred to both sexes,\r\nand the female would then closely resemble the male. There can hardly\r\nbe a doubt that this is the cause of the male pouter pigeon having a\r\nsomewhat larger crop, and of the male carrier pigeon having somewhat\r\nlarger wattles, than their respective females; for fanciers have not\r\nselected one sex more than the other, and have had no wish that these\r\ncharacters should be more strongly displayed in the male than in the\r\nfemale, yet this is the case with both breeds.\r\n\r\nThe same process would have to be followed, and the same difficulties\r\nencountered, if it were desired to make a breed with the females alone\r\nof some new colour.\r\n\r\nLastly, our fancier might wish to make a breed with the two sexes\r\ndiffering from each other, and both from the parent species. Here the\r\ndifficulty would be extreme, unless the successive variations were from\r\nthe first sexually limited on both sides, and then there would be no\r\ndifficulty. We see this with the fowl; thus the two sexes of the\r\npencilled Hamburghs differ greatly from each other, and from the two\r\nsexes of the aboriginal Gallus bankiva; and both are now kept constant\r\nto their standard of excellence by continued selection, which would be\r\nimpossible unless the distinctive characters of both were limited in\r\ntheir transmission.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish fowl offers a more curious case; the male has an immense\r\ncomb, but some of the successive variations, by the accumulation of\r\nwhich it was acquired, appear to have been transferred to the female;\r\nfor she has a comb many times larger than that of the females of the\r\nparent species. But the comb of the female differs in one respect from\r\nthat of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a recent period\r\nit has been ordered by the fancy that this should always be the case,\r\nand success has quickly followed the order. Now the lopping of the comb\r\nmust be sexually limited in its transmission, otherwise it would\r\nprevent the comb of the male from being perfectly upright, which would\r\nbe abhorrent to every fancier. On the other hand, the uprightness of\r\nthe comb in the male must likewise be a sexually-limited character,\r\notherwise it would prevent the comb of the female from lopping over.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing illustrations, we see that even with almost\r\nunlimited time at command, it would be an extremely difficult and\r\ncomplex, perhaps an impossible process, to change one form of\r\ntransmission into the other through selection. Therefore, without\r\ndistinct evidence in each case, I am unwilling to admit that this has\r\nbeen effected in natural species. On the other hand, by means of\r\nsuccessive variations, which were from the first\r\n\r\nsexually limited in their transmission, there would not be the least\r\ndifficulty in rendering a male bird widely different in colour or in\r\nany other character from the female; the latter being left unaltered,\r\nor slightly altered, or specially modified for the sake of protection.\r\n\r\nAs bright colours are of service to the males in their rivalry with\r\nother males, such colours would be selected whether or not they were\r\ntransmitted exclusively to the same sex. Consequently the females might\r\nbe expected often to partake of the brightness of the males to a\r\ngreater or less degree; and this occurs with a host of species. If all\r\nthe successive variations were transmitted equally to both sexes, the\r\nfemales would be indistinguishable from the males; and this likewise\r\noccurs with many birds. If, however, dull colours were of high\r\nimportance for the safety of the female during incubation, as with many\r\nground birds, the females which varied in brightness, or which received\r\nthrough inheritance from the males any marked accession of brightness,\r\nwould sooner or later be destroyed. But the tendency in the males to\r\ncontinue for an indefinite period transmitting to their female\r\noffspring their own brightness, would have to be eliminated by a change\r\nin the form of inheritance; and this, as shewn by our previous\r\nillustration, would be extremely difficult. The more probable result of\r\nthe long-continued destruction of the more brightly-coloured females,\r\nsupposing the equal form of transmission to prevail, would be the\r\nlessening or annihilation of the bright colours of the males, owing to\r\ntheir continual crossing with the duller females. It would be tedious\r\nto follow out all the other possible results; but I may remind the\r\nreader that if sexually-limited variations in brightness occurred in\r\nthe females, even if they were not in the least injurious to them and\r\nconsequently were not eliminated, yet they would not be favoured or\r\nselected, for the male usually accepts any female, and does not select\r\nthe more attractive individuals; consequently these variations would be\r\nliable to be lost, and would have little influence on the character of\r\nthe race; and this will aid in accounting for the females being\r\ncommonly duller-coloured than the males.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth chapter instances were given, to which many might here be\r\nadded, of variations occurring at various ages, and inherited at the\r\ncorresponding age. It was also shewn that variations which occur late\r\nin life are commonly transmitted to the same sex in which they first\r\nappear; whilst variations occurring early in life are apt to be\r\ntransmitted to both sexes; not that all the cases of sexually-limited\r\ntransmission can thus be accounted for. It was further shewn that if a\r\nmale bird varied by becoming brighter whilst young, such variations\r\nwould be of no service until the age for reproduction had arrived, and\r\nthere was competition between rival males. But in the case of birds\r\nliving on the ground and commonly in need of the protection of dull\r\ncolours, bright tints would be far more dangerous to the young and\r\ninexperienced than to the adult males. Consequently the males which\r\nvaried in brightness whilst young would suffer much destruction and be\r\neliminated through natural selection; on the other hand, the males\r\nwhich varied in this manner when nearly mature, notwithstanding that\r\nthey were exposed to some additional danger, might survive, and from\r\nbeing favoured through sexual selection, would procreate their kind. As\r\na relation often exists between the period of variation and the form of\r\ntransmission, if the bright-coloured young males were destroyed and the\r\nmature ones were successful in their courtship, the males alone would\r\nacquire brilliant colours and would transmit them exclusively to their\r\nmale offspring. But I by no means wish to maintain that the influence\r\nof age on the form of transmission, is the sole cause of the great\r\ndifference in brilliancy between the sexes of many birds.\r\n\r\nWhen the sexes of birds differ in colour, it is interesting to\r\ndetermine whether the males alone have been modified by sexual\r\nselection, the females having been left unchanged, or only partially\r\nand indirectly thus changed; or whether the females have been specially\r\nmodified through natural selection for the sake of protection. I will\r\ntherefore discuss this question at some length, even more fully than\r\nits intrinsic importance deserves; for various curious collateral\r\npoints may thus be conveniently considered.\r\n\r\nBefore we enter on the subject of colour, more especially in reference\r\nto Mr. Wallace’s conclusions, it may be useful to discuss some other\r\nsexual differences under a similar point of view. A breed of fowls\r\nformerly existed in Germany (6. Bechstein, ‘Naturgeschichte\r\nDeutschlands,’ 1793, B. iii. 339.) in which the hens were furnished\r\nwith spurs; they were good layers, but they so greatly disturbed their\r\nnests with their spurs that they could not be allowed to sit on their\r\nown eggs. Hence at one time it appeared to me probable that with the\r\nfemales of the wild Gallinaceae the development of spurs had been\r\nchecked through natural selection, from the injury thus caused to their\r\nnests. This seemed all the more probable, as wing-spurs, which would\r\nnot be injurious during incubation, are often as well-developed in the\r\nfemale as in the male; though in not a few cases they are rather larger\r\nin the male. When the male is furnished with leg-spurs the female\r\nalmost always exhibits rudiments of them,—the rudiment sometimes\r\nconsisting of a mere scale, as in Gallus. Hence it might be argued that\r\nthe females had aboriginally been furnished with well-developed spurs,\r\nbut that these had subsequently been lost through disuse or natural\r\nselection. But if this view be admitted, it would have to be extended\r\nto innumerable other cases; and it implies that the female progenitors\r\nof the existing spur-bearing species were once encumbered with an\r\ninjurious appendage.\r\n\r\nIn some few genera and species, as in Galloperdix, Acomus, and the\r\nJavan peacock (Pavo muticus), the females, as well as the males,\r\npossess well-developed leg-spurs. Are we to infer from this fact that\r\nthey construct a different sort of nest from that made by their nearest\r\nallies, and not liable to be injured by their spurs; so that the spurs\r\nhave not been removed? Or are we to suppose that the females of these\r\nseveral species especially require spurs for their defence? It is a\r\nmore probable conclusion that both the presence and absence of spurs in\r\nthe females result from different laws of inheritance having prevailed,\r\nindependently of natural selection. With the many females in which\r\nspurs appear as rudiments, we may conclude that some few of the\r\nsuccessive variations, through which they were developed in the males,\r\noccurred very early in life, and were consequently transferred to the\r\nfemales. In the other and much rarer cases, in which the females\r\npossess fully developed spurs, we may conclude that all the successive\r\nvariations were transferred to them; and that they gradually acquired\r\nand inherited the habit of not disturbing their nests.\r\n\r\nThe vocal organs and the feathers variously modified for producing\r\nsound, as well as the proper instincts for using them, often differ in\r\nthe two sexes, but are sometimes the same in both. Can such differences\r\nbe accounted for by the males having acquired these organs and\r\ninstincts, whilst the females have been saved from inheriting them, on\r\naccount of the danger to which they would have been exposed by\r\nattracting the attention of birds or beasts of prey? This does not seem\r\nto me probable, when we think of the multitude of birds which with\r\nimpunity gladden the country with their voices during the spring. (7.\r\nDaines Barrington, however, thought it probable (‘Philosophical\r\nTransactions,’ 1773, p. 164) that few female birds sing, because the\r\ntalent would have been dangerous to them during incubation. He adds,\r\nthat a similar view may possibly account for the inferiority of the\r\nfemale to the male in plumage.) It is a safer conclusion that, as vocal\r\nand instrumental organs are of special service only to the males during\r\ntheir courtship, these organs were developed through sexual selection\r\nand their constant use in that sex alone—the successive variations and\r\nthe effects of use having been from the first more or less limited in\r\ntransmission to the male offspring.\r\n\r\nMany analogous cases could be adduced; those for instance of the plumes\r\non the head being generally longer in the male than in the female,\r\nsometimes of equal length in both sexes, and occasionally absent in the\r\nfemale,—these several cases occurring in the same group of birds. It\r\nwould be difficult to account for such a difference between the sexes\r\nby the female having been benefited by possessing a slightly shorter\r\ncrest than the male, and its consequent diminution or complete\r\nsuppression through natural selection. But I will take a more\r\nfavourable case, namely the length of the tail. The long train of the\r\npeacock would have been not only inconvenient but dangerous to the\r\npeahen during the period of incubation and whilst accompanying her\r\nyoung. Hence there is not the least a priori improbability in the\r\ndevelopment of her tail having been checked through natural selection.\r\nBut the females of various pheasants, which apparently are exposed on\r\ntheir open nests to as much danger as the peahen, have tails of\r\nconsiderable length. The females as well as the males of the Menura\r\nsuperba have long tails, and they build a domed nest, which is a great\r\nanomaly in so large a bird. Naturalists have wondered how the female\r\nMenura could manage her tail during incubation; but it is now known (8.\r\nMr. Ramsay, in ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1868, p. 50.) that she “enters the\r\nnest head first, and then turns round with her tail sometimes over her\r\nback, but more often bent round by her side. Thus in time the tail\r\nbecomes quite askew, and is a tolerable guide to the length of time the\r\nbird has been sitting.” Both sexes of an Australian kingfisher\r\n(Tanysiptera sylvia) have the middle tail-feathers greatly lengthened,\r\nand the female makes her nest in a hole; and as I am informed by Mr.\r\nR.B. Sharpe these feathers become much crumpled during incubation.\r\n\r\nIn these two latter cases the great length of the tail-feathers must be\r\nin some degree inconvenient to the female; and as in both species the\r\ntail-feathers of the female are somewhat shorter than those of the\r\nmale, it might be argued that their full development had been prevented\r\nthrough natural selection. But if the development of the tail of the\r\npeahen had been checked only when it became inconveniently or\r\ndangerously great, she would have retained a much longer tail than she\r\nactually possesses; for her tail is not nearly so long, relatively to\r\nthe size of her body, as that of many female pheasants, nor longer than\r\nthat of the female turkey. It must also be borne in mind that, in\r\naccordance with this view, as soon as the tail of the peahen became\r\ndangerously long, and its development was consequently checked, she\r\nwould have continually reacted on her male progeny, and thus have\r\nprevented the peacock from acquiring his present magnificent train. We\r\nmay therefore infer that the length of the tail in the peacock and its\r\nshortness in the peahen are the result of the requisite variations in\r\nthe male having been from the first transmitted to the male offspring\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWe are led to a nearly similar conclusion with respect to the length of\r\nthe tail in the various species of pheasants. In the Eared pheasant\r\n(Crossoptilon auritum) the tail is of equal length in both sexes,\r\nnamely sixteen or seventeen inches; in the common pheasant it is about\r\ntwenty inches long in the male and twelve in the female; in\r\nSoemmerring’s pheasant, thirty-seven inches in the male and only eight\r\nin the female; and lastly in Reeve’s pheasant it is sometimes actually\r\nseventy-two inches long in the male and sixteen in the female. Thus in\r\nthe several species, the tail of the female differs much in length,\r\nirrespectively of that of the male; and this can be accounted for, as\r\nit seems to me, with much more probability, by the laws of\r\ninheritance,—that is by the successive variations having been from the\r\nfirst more or less closely limited in their transmission to the male\r\nsex than by the agency of natural selection, resulting from the length\r\nof tail being more or less injurious to the females of these several\r\nallied species.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider Mr. Wallace’s arguments in regard to the sexual\r\ncoloration of birds. He believes that the bright tints originally\r\nacquired through sexual selection by the males would in all, or almost\r\nall cases, have been transmitted to the females, unless the\r\ntransference had been checked through natural selection. I may here\r\nremind the reader that various facts opposed to this view have already\r\nbeen given under reptiles, amphibians, fishes and lepidoptera. Mr.\r\nWallace rests his belief chiefly, but not exclusively, as we shall see\r\nin the next chapter, on the following statement (9. ‘Journal of\r\nTravel,’ edited by A. Murray, vol. i. 1868, p. 78.), that when both\r\nsexes are coloured in a very conspicuous manner, the nest is of such a\r\nnature as to conceal the sitting bird; but when there is a marked\r\ncontrast of colour between the sexes, the male being gay and the female\r\ndull-coloured, the nest is open and exposes the sitting bird to view.\r\nThis coincidence, as far as it goes, certainly seems to favour the\r\nbelief that the females which sit on open nests have been specially\r\nmodified for the sake of protection; but we shall presently see that\r\nthere is another and more probable explanation, namely, that\r\nconspicuous females have acquired the instinct of building domed nests\r\noftener than dull-coloured birds. Mr. Wallace admits that there are, as\r\nmight have been expected, some exceptions to his two rules, but it is a\r\nquestion whether the exceptions are not so numerous as seriously to\r\ninvalidate them.\r\n\r\nThere is in the first place much truth in the Duke of Argyll’s remark\r\n(10. ‘Journal of Travel,’ edited by A. Murray, vol. i. 1868, p. 281.)\r\nthat a large domed nest is more conspicuous to an enemy, especially to\r\nall tree-haunting carnivorous animals, than a smaller open nest. Nor\r\nmust we forget that with many birds which build open nests, the male\r\nsits on the eggs and aids the female in feeding the young: this is the\r\ncase, for instance, with Pyranga aestiva (11. Audubon, ‘Ornithological\r\nBiography,’ vol. i. p. 233.), one of the most splendid birds in the\r\nUnited States, the male being vermilion, and the female light\r\nbrownish-green. Now if brilliant colours had been extremely dangerous\r\nto birds whilst sitting on their open nests, the males in these cases\r\nwould have suffered greatly. It might, however, be of such paramount\r\nimportance to the male to be brilliantly coloured, in order to beat his\r\nrivals, that this may have more than compensated some additional\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace admits that with the King-crows (Dicrurus), Orioles, and\r\nPittidae, the females are conspicuously coloured, yet build open nests;\r\nbut he urges that the birds of the first group are highly pugnacious\r\nand could defend themselves; that those of the second group take\r\nextreme care in concealing their open nests, but this does not\r\ninvariably hold good (12. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. ii. p. 108.\r\nGould’s ‘Handbook of the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. p. 463.); and\r\nthat with the birds of the third group the females are brightly\r\ncoloured chiefly on the under surface. Besides these cases, pigeons\r\nwhich are sometimes brightly, and almost always conspicuously coloured,\r\nand which are notoriously liable to the attacks of birds of prey, offer\r\na serious exception to the rule, for they almost always build open and\r\nexposed nests. In another large family, that of the humming-birds, all\r\nthe species build open nests, yet with some of the most gorgeous\r\nspecies the sexes are alike; and in the majority, the females, though\r\nless brilliant than the males, are brightly coloured. Nor can it be\r\nmaintained that all female humming-birds, which are brightly coloured,\r\nescape detection by their tints being green, for some display on their\r\nupper surfaces red, blue, and other colours. (13. For instance, the\r\nfemale Eupetomena macroura has the head and tail dark blue with reddish\r\nloins; the female Lampornis porphyrurus is blackish-green on the upper\r\nsurface, with the lores and sides of the throat crimson; the female\r\nEulampis jugularis has the top of the head and back green, but the\r\nloins and the tail are crimson. Many other instances of highly\r\nconspicuous females could be given. See Mr. Gould’s magnificent work on\r\nthis family.)\r\n\r\nIn regard to birds which build in holes or construct domed nests, other\r\nadvantages, as Mr. Wallace remarks, besides concealment are gained,\r\nsuch as shelter from the rain, greater warmth, and in hot countries\r\nprotection from the sun (14. Mr. Salvin noticed in Guatemala (‘Ibis,’\r\n1864, p. 375) that humming-birds were much more unwilling to leave\r\ntheir nests during very hot weather, when the sun was shining brightly,\r\nas if their eggs would be thus injured, than during cool, cloudy, or\r\nrainy weather.); so that it is no valid objection to his view that many\r\nbirds having both sexes obscurely coloured build concealed nests. (15.\r\nI may specify, as instances of dull-coloured birds building concealed\r\nnests, the species belonging to eight Australian genera described in\r\nGould’s ‘Handbook of the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. pp. 340, 362,\r\n365, 383, 387, 389, 391, 414.) The female Horn-bill (Buceros), for\r\ninstance, of India and Africa is protected during incubation with\r\nextraordinary care, for she plasters up with her own excrement the\r\norifice of the hole in which she sits on her eggs, leaving only a small\r\norifice through which the male feeds her; she is thus kept a close\r\nprisoner during the whole period of incubation (16. Mr. C. Horne,\r\n‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1869. p. 243.); yet female horn-bills are not more\r\nconspicuously coloured than many other birds of equal size which build\r\nopen nests. It is a more serious objection to Mr. Wallace’s view, as is\r\nadmitted by him, that in some few groups the males are brilliantly\r\ncoloured and the females obscure, and yet the latter hatch their eggs\r\nin domed nests. This is the case with the Grallinae of Australia, the\r\nSuperb Warblers (Maluridae) of the same country, the Sun-birds\r\n(Nectariniae), and with several of the Australian Honey-suckers or\r\nMeliphagidae. (17. On the nidification and colours of these latter\r\nspecies, see Gould’s ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. pp.\r\n504, 527.)\r\n\r\nIf we look to the birds of England we shall see that there is no close\r\nand general relation between the colours of the female and the nature\r\nof the nest which is constructed. About forty of our British birds\r\n(excluding those of large size which could defend themselves) build in\r\nholes in banks, rocks, or trees, or construct domed nests. If we take\r\nthe colours of the female goldfinch, bullfinch, or blackbird, as a\r\nstandard of the degree of conspicuousness, which is not highly\r\ndangerous to the sitting female, then out of the above forty birds the\r\nfemales of only twelve can be considered as conspicuous to a dangerous\r\ndegree, the remaining twenty-eight being inconspicuous. (18. I have\r\nconsulted, on this subject, Macgillivray’s ‘British Birds,’ and though\r\ndoubts may be entertained in some cases in regard to the degree of\r\nconcealment of the nest, and to the degree of conspicuousness of the\r\nfemale, yet the following birds, which all lay their eggs in holes or\r\nin domed nests, can hardly be considered, by the above standard, as\r\nconspicuous: Passer, 2 species; Sturnus, of which the female is\r\nconsiderably less brilliant than the male; Cinclus; Motallica boarula\r\n(?); Erithacus (?); Fruticola, 2 sp.; Saxicola; Ruticilla, 2 sp.;\r\nSylvia, 3 sp.; Parus, 3 sp.; Mecistura; Anorthura; Certhia; Sitta;\r\nYunx; Muscicapa, 2 sp.; Hirundo, 3 sp.; and Cypselus. The females of\r\nthe following 12 birds may be considered as conspicuous according to\r\nthe same standard, viz., Pastor, Motacilla alba, Parus major and P.\r\ncaeruleus, Upupa, Picus, 4 sp., Coracias, Alcedo, and Merops.) Nor is\r\nthere any close relation within the same genus between a\r\nwell-pronounced difference in colour between the sexes, and the nature\r\nof the nest constructed. Thus the male house sparrow (Passer\r\ndomesticus) differs much from the female, the male tree-sparrow (P.\r\nmontanus) hardly at all, and yet both build well-concealed nests. The\r\ntwo sexes of the common fly-catcher (Muscicapa grisola) can hardly be\r\ndistinguished, whilst the sexes of the pied fly-catcher (M. luctuosa)\r\ndiffer considerably, and both species build in holes or conceal their\r\nnests. The female blackbird (Turdus merula) differs much, the female\r\nring-ouzel (T. torquatus) differs less, and the female common thrush\r\n(T. musicus) hardly at all from their respective males; yet all build\r\nopen nests. On the other hand, the not very distantly-allied\r\nwater-ouzel (Cinclus aquaticus) builds a domed nest, and the sexes\r\ndiffer about as much as in the ring-ouzel. The black and red grouse\r\n(Tetrao tetrix and T. scoticus) build open nests in equally\r\nwell-concealed spots, but in the one species the sexes differ greatly,\r\nand in the other very little.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing objections, I cannot doubt, after reading\r\nMr. Wallace’s excellent essay, that looking to the birds of the world,\r\na large majority of the species in which the females are conspicuously\r\ncoloured (and in this case the males with rare exceptions are equally\r\nconspicuous), build concealed nests for the sake of protection. Mr.\r\nWallace enumerates (19. ‘Journal of Travel,’ edited by A. Murray, vol.\r\ni. p. 78.) a long series of groups in which this rule holds good; but\r\nit will suffice here to give, as instances, the more familiar groups of\r\nkingfishers, toucans, trogons, puff-birds (Capitonidae),\r\nplantain-eaters (Musophagae, woodpeckers, and parrots. Mr. Wallace\r\nbelieves that in these groups, as the males gradually acquired through\r\nsexual selection their brilliant colours, these were transferred to the\r\nfemales and were not eliminated by natural selection, owing to the\r\nprotection which they already enjoyed from their manner of\r\nnidification. According to this view, their present manner of nesting\r\nwas acquired before their present colours. But it seems to me much more\r\nprobable that in most cases, as the females were gradually rendered\r\nmore and more brilliant from partaking of the colours of the male, they\r\nwere gradually led to change their instincts (supposing that they\r\noriginally built open nests), and to seek protection by building domed\r\nor concealed nests. No one who studies, for instance, Audubon’s account\r\nof the differences in the nests of the same species in the Northern and\r\nSouthern United States (20. See many statements in the ‘Ornithological\r\nBiography.’ See also some curious observations on the nests of Italian\r\nbirds by Eugenio Bettoni, in the ‘Atti della Società Italiana,’ vol.\r\nxi. 1869, p. 487.), will feel any great difficulty in admitting that\r\nbirds, either by a change (in the strict sense of the word) of their\r\nhabits, or through the natural selection of so-called spontaneous\r\nvariations of instinct, might readily be led to modify their manner of\r\nnesting.\r\n\r\nThis way of viewing the relation, as far as it holds good, between the\r\nbright colours of female birds and their manner of nesting, receives\r\nsome support from certain cases occurring in the Sahara Desert. Here,\r\nas in most other deserts, various birds, and many other animals, have\r\nhad their colours adapted in a wonderful manner to the tints of the\r\nsurrounding surface. Nevertheless there are, as I am informed by the\r\nRev. Mr. Tristram, some curious exceptions to the rule; thus the male\r\nof the Monticola cyanea is conspicuous from his bright blue colour, and\r\nthe female almost equally conspicuous from her mottled brown and white\r\nplumage; both sexes of two species of Dromolaea are of a lustrous\r\nblack; so that these three species are far from receiving protection\r\nfrom their colours, yet they are able to survive, for they have\r\nacquired the habit of taking refuge from danger in holes or crevices in\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the above groups in which the females are conspicuously\r\ncoloured and build concealed nests, it is not necessary to suppose that\r\neach separate species had its nidifying instinct specially modified;\r\nbut only that the early progenitors of each group were gradually led to\r\nbuild domed or concealed nests, and afterwards transmitted this\r\ninstinct, together with their bright colours, to their modified\r\ndescendants. As far as it can be trusted, the conclusion is\r\ninteresting, that sexual selection together with equal or nearly equal\r\ninheritance by both sexes, have indirectly determined the manner of\r\nnidification of whole groups of birds.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Wallace, even in the groups in which the females, from\r\nbeing protected in domed nests during incubation, have not had their\r\nbright colours eliminated through natural selection, the males often\r\ndiffer in a slight, and occasionally in a considerable degree from the\r\nfemales. This is a significant fact, for such differences in colour\r\nmust be accounted for by some of the variations in the males having\r\nbeen from the first limited in transmission to the same sex; as it can\r\nhardly be maintained that these differences, especially when very\r\nslight, serve as a protection to the female. Thus all the species in\r\nthe splendid group of the Trogons build in holes; and Mr. Gould gives\r\nfigures (21. See his Monograph of the Trogonidae, 1st edition.) of both\r\nsexes of twenty-five species, in all of which, with one partial\r\nexception, the sexes differ sometimes slightly, sometimes\r\nconspicuously, in colour,—the males being always finer than the\r\nfemales, though the latter are likewise beautiful. All the species of\r\nkingfishers build in holes, and with most of the species the sexes are\r\nequally brilliant, and thus far Mr. Wallace’s rule holds good; but in\r\nsome of the Australian species the colours of the females are rather\r\nless vivid than those of the male; and in one splendidly-coloured\r\nspecies, the sexes differ so much that they were at first thought to be\r\nspecifically distinct. (22. Namely, Cyanalcyon, Gould’s ‘Handbook to\r\nthe Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. p. 133; see, also, pp. 130, 136.) Mr.\r\nR.B. Sharpe, who has especially studied this group, has shewn me some\r\nAmerican species (Ceryle) in which the breast of the male is belted\r\nwith black. Again, in Carcineutes, the difference between the sexes is\r\nconspicuous: in the male the upper surface is dull-blue banded with\r\nblack, the lower surface being partly fawn-coloured, and there is much\r\nred about the head; in the female the upper surface is reddish-brown\r\nbanded with black, and the lower surface white with black markings. It\r\nis an interesting fact, as shewing how the same peculiar style of\r\nsexual colouring often characterises allied forms, that in three\r\nspecies of Dacelo the male differs from the female only in the tail\r\nbeing dull-blue banded with black, whilst that of the female is brown\r\nwith blackish bars; so that here the tail differs in colour in the two\r\nsexes in exactly the same manner as the whole upper surface in the two\r\nsexes of Carcineutes.\r\n\r\nWith parrots, which likewise build in holes, we find analogous cases:\r\nin most of the species, both sexes are brilliantly coloured and\r\nindistinguishable, but in not a few species the males are coloured\r\nrather more vividly than the females, or even very differently from\r\nthem. Thus, besides other strongly-marked differences, the whole under\r\nsurface of the male King Lory (Aprosmictus scapulatus) is scarlet,\r\nwhilst the throat and chest of the female is green tinged with red: in\r\nthe Euphema splendida there is a similar difference, the face and wing\r\ncoverts moreover of the female being of a paler blue than in the male.\r\n(23. Every gradation of difference between the sexes may be followed in\r\nthe parrots of Australia. See Gould’s ‘Handbook,’ etc., vol. ii. pp.\r\n14-102.) In the family of the tits (Parinae), which build concealed\r\nnests, the female of our common blue tomtit (Parus caeruleus), is “much\r\nless brightly coloured” than the male: and in the magnificent Sultan\r\nyellow tit of India the difference is greater. (24. Macgillivray’s\r\n‘British Birds,’ vol. ii. p. 433. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. ii. p.\r\n282.)\r\n\r\nAgain, in the great group of the woodpeckers (25. All the following\r\nfacts are taken from M. Malherbe’s magnificent ‘Monographie des\r\nPicidees,’ 1861.), the sexes are generally nearly alike, but in the\r\nMegapicus validus all those parts of the head, neck, and breast, which\r\nare crimson in the male are pale brown in the female. As in several\r\nwoodpeckers the head of the male is bright crimson, whilst that of the\r\nfemale is plain, it occurred to me that this colour might possibly make\r\nthe female dangerously conspicuous, whenever she put her head out of\r\nthe hole containing her nest, and consequently that this colour, in\r\naccordance with Mr. Wallace’s belief, had been eliminated. This view is\r\nstrengthened by what Malherbe states with respect to Indopicus\r\ncarlotta; namely, that the young females, like the young males, have\r\nsome crimson about their heads, but that this colour disappears in the\r\nadult female, whilst it is intensified in the adult male. Nevertheless\r\nthe following considerations render this view extremely doubtful: the\r\nmale takes a fair share in incubation (26. Audubon’s ‘Ornithological\r\nBiography,’ vol. ii. p. 75; see also the ‘Ibis,’ vol. i. p. 268.), and\r\nwould be thus almost equally exposed to danger; both sexes of many\r\nspecies have their heads of an equally bright crimson; in other species\r\nthe difference between the sexes in the amount of scarlet is so slight\r\nthat it can hardly make any appreciable difference in the danger\r\nincurred; and lastly, the colouring of the head in the two sexes often\r\ndiffers slightly in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe cases, as yet given, of slight and graduated differences in colour\r\nbetween the males and females in the groups, in which as a general rule\r\nthe sexes resemble each other, all relate to species which build domed\r\nor concealed nests. But similar gradations may likewise be observed in\r\ngroups in which the sexes as a general rule resemble each other, but\r\nwhich build open nests.\r\n\r\nAs I have before instanced the Australian parrots, so I may here\r\ninstance, without giving any details, the Australian pigeons. (27.\r\nGould’s ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol. ii. pp. 109-149.) It\r\ndeserves especial notice that in all these cases the slight differences\r\nin plumage between the sexes are of the same general nature as the\r\noccasionally greater differences. A good illustration of this fact has\r\nalready been afforded by those kingfishers in which either the tail\r\nalone or the whole upper surface of the plumage differs in the same\r\nmanner in the two sexes. Similar cases may be observed with parrots and\r\npigeons. The differences in colour between the sexes of the same\r\nspecies are, also, of the same general nature as the differences in\r\ncolour between the distinct species of the same group. For when in a\r\ngroup in which the sexes are usually alike, the male differs\r\nconsiderably from the female, he is not coloured in a quite new style.\r\nHence we may infer that within the same group the special colours of\r\nboth sexes when they are alike, and the colours of the male, when he\r\ndiffers slightly or even considerably from the female, have been in\r\nmost cases determined by the same general cause; this being sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable, as has already been remarked, that differences in\r\ncolour between the sexes, when very slight, can be of service to the\r\nfemale as a protection. Assuming, however, that they are of service,\r\nthey might be thought to be cases of transition; but we have no reason\r\nto believe that many species at any one time are undergoing change.\r\nTherefore we can hardly admit that the numerous females which differ\r\nvery slightly in colour from their males are now all commencing to\r\nbecome obscure for the sake of protection. Even if we consider somewhat\r\nmore marked sexual differences, is it probable, for instance, that the\r\nhead of the female chaffinch,—the crimson on the breast of the female\r\nbullfinch,—the green of the female greenfinch,—the crest of the female\r\ngolden-crested wren, have all been rendered less bright by the slow\r\nprocess of selection for the sake of protection? I cannot think so; and\r\nstill less with the slight differences between the sexes of those birds\r\nwhich build concealed nests. On the other hand, the differences in\r\ncolour between the sexes, whether great or small, may to a large extent\r\nbe explained on the principle of the successive variations, acquired by\r\nthe males through sexual selection, having been from the first more or\r\nless limited in their transmission to the females. That the degree of\r\nlimitation should differ in different species of the same group will\r\nnot surprise any one who has studied the laws of inheritance, for they\r\nare so complex that they appear to us in our ignorance to be capricious\r\nin their action. (28. See remarks to this effect in ‘Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. chap. xii.)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can discover there are few large groups of birds in which\r\nall the species have both sexes alike and brilliantly coloured, but I\r\nhear from Mr. Sclater, that this appears to be the case with the\r\nMusophagae or plantain-eaters. Nor do I believe that any large group\r\nexists in which the sexes of all the species are widely dissimilar in\r\ncolour: Mr. Wallace informs me that the chatterers of S. America\r\n(Cotingidae) offer one of the best instances; but with some of the\r\nspecies, in which the male has a splendid red breast, the female\r\nexhibits some red on her breast; and the females of other species shew\r\ntraces of the green and other colours of the males. Nevertheless we\r\nhave a near approach to close sexual similarity or dissimilarity\r\nthroughout several groups: and this, from what has just been said of\r\nthe fluctuating nature of inheritance, is a somewhat surprising\r\ncircumstance. But that the same laws should largely prevail with allied\r\nanimals is not surprising. The domestic fowl has produced a great\r\nnumber of breeds and sub-breeds, and in these the sexes generally\r\ndiffer in plumage; so that it has been noticed as an unusual\r\ncircumstance when in certain sub-breeds they resemble each other. On\r\nthe other hand, the domestic pigeon has likewise produced a vast number\r\nof distinct breeds and sub-breeds, and in these, with rare exceptions,\r\nthe two sexes are identically alike.\r\n\r\nTherefore if other species of Gallus and Columba were domesticated and\r\nvaried, it would not be rash to predict that similar rules of sexual\r\nsimilarity and dissimilarity, depending on the form of transmission,\r\nwould hold good in both cases. In like manner the same form of\r\ntransmission has generally prevailed under nature throughout the same\r\ngroups, although marked exceptions to this rule occur. Thus within the\r\nsame family or even genus, the sexes may be identically alike, or very\r\ndifferent in colour. Instances have already been given in the same\r\ngenus, as with sparrows, fly-catchers, thrushes and grouse. In the\r\nfamily of pheasants the sexes of almost all the species are wonderfully\r\ndissimilar, but are quite alike in the eared pheasant or Crossoptilon\r\nauritum. In two species of Chloephaga, a genus of geese, the male\r\ncannot be distinguished from the females, except by size; whilst in two\r\nothers, the sexes are so unlike that they might easily be mistaken for\r\ndistinct species. (29. The ‘Ibis,’ vol. vi. 1864, p. 122.)\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance can alone account for the following cases, in\r\nwhich the female acquires, late in life, certain characters proper to\r\nthe male, and ultimately comes to resemble him more or less completely.\r\nHere protection can hardly have come into play. Mr. Blyth informs me\r\nthat the females of Oriolus melanocephalus and of some allied species,\r\nwhen sufficiently mature to breed, differ considerably in plumage from\r\nthe adult males; but after the second or third moults they differ only\r\nin their beaks having a slight greenish tinge. In the dwarf bitterns\r\n(Ardetta), according to the same authority, “the male acquires his\r\nfinal livery at the first moult, the female not before the third or\r\nfourth moult; in the meanwhile she presents an intermediate garb, which\r\nis ultimately exchanged for the same livery as that of the male.” So\r\nagain the female Falco peregrinus acquires her blue plumage more slowly\r\nthan the male. Mr. Swinhoe states that with one of the Drongo shrikes\r\n(Dicrurus macrocercus) the male, whilst almost a nestling, moults his\r\nsoft brown plumage and becomes of a uniform glossy greenish-black; but\r\nthe female retains for a long time the white striae and spots on the\r\naxillary feathers; and does not completely assume the uniform black\r\ncolour of the male for three years. The same excellent observer remarks\r\nthat in the spring of the second year the female spoon-bill (Platalea)\r\nof China resembles the male of the first year, and that apparently it\r\nis not until the third spring that she acquires the same adult plumage\r\nas that possessed by the male at a much earlier age. The female\r\nBombycilla carolinensis differs very little from the male, but the\r\nappendages, which like beads of red sealing-wax ornament the\r\nwing-feathers (30. When the male courts the female, these ornaments are\r\nvibrated, and “are shewn off to great advantage,” on the outstretched\r\nwings: A. Leith Adams, ‘Field and Forest Rambles,’ 1873, p. 153.), are\r\nnot developed in her so early in life as in the male. In the male of an\r\nIndian parrakeet (Palaeornis javanicus) the upper mandible is coral-red\r\nfrom his earliest youth, but in the female, as Mr. Blyth has observed\r\nwith caged and wild birds, it is at first black and does not become red\r\nuntil the bird is at least a year old, at which age the sexes resemble\r\neach other in all respects. Both sexes of the wild turkey are\r\nultimately furnished with a tuft of bristles on the breast, but in\r\ntwo-year-old birds the tuft is about four inches long in the male and\r\nhardly apparent in the female; when, however, the latter has reached\r\nher fourth year, it is from four to five inches in length. (31. On\r\nArdetta, Translation of Cuvier’s ‘Regne Animal,’ by Mr. Blyth,\r\nfootnote, p. 159. On the Peregrine Falcon, Mr. Blyth, in Charlesworth’s\r\n‘Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. i. 1837, p. 304.

On the\r\nPalaeornis, see, also, Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. p. 263. On the\r\nwild turkey, Audubon, ibid. vol. i. p. 15; but I hear from Judge Caton\r\nthat in Illinois the female very rarely acquires a tuft. Analogous\r\ncases with the females of Petrocossyphus are given by Mr. R. Sharpe,\r\n‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1872, p. 496.)\r\n\r\nThese cases must not be confounded with those where diseased or old\r\nfemales abnormally assume masculine characters, nor with those where\r\nfertile females, whilst young, acquire the characters of the male,\r\nthrough variation or some unknown cause. (32. Of these latter cases Mr.\r\nBlyth has recorded (Translation of Cuvier’s ‘Regne Animal,’ p. 158)\r\nvarious instances with Lanius, Ruticilla, Linaria, and Anas. Audubon\r\nhas also recorded a similar case (‘Ornitholog. Biography,’ vol. v. p.\r\n519) with Pyranga aestiva.) But all these cases have so much in common\r\nthat they depend, according to the hypothesis of pangenesis, on\r\ngemmules derived from each part of the male being present, though\r\nlatent, in the female; their development following on some slight\r\nchange in the elective affinities of her constituent tissues.\r\n\r\nA few words must be added on changes of plumage in relation to the\r\nseason of the year. From reasons formerly assigned there can be little\r\ndoubt that the elegant plumes, long pendant feathers, crests, etc., of\r\negrets, herons, and many other birds, which are developed and retained\r\nonly during the summer, serve for ornamental and nuptial purposes,\r\nthough common to both sexes. The female is thus rendered more\r\nconspicuous during the period of incubation than during the winter; but\r\nsuch birds as herons and egrets would be able to defend themselves. As,\r\nhowever, plumes would probably be inconvenient and certainly of no use\r\nduring the winter, it is possible that the habit of moulting twice in\r\nthe year may have been gradually acquired through natural selection for\r\nthe sake of casting off inconvenient ornaments during the winter. But\r\nthis view cannot be extended to the many waders, whose summer and\r\nwinter plumages differ very little in colour. With defenceless species,\r\nin which both sexes, or the males alone, become extremely conspicuous\r\nduring the breeding-season,—or when the males acquire at this season\r\nsuch long wing or tail-feathers as to impede their flight, as with\r\nCosmetornis and Vidua,—it certainly at first appears highly probable\r\nthat the second moult has been gained for the special purpose of\r\nthrowing off these ornaments. We must, however, remember that many\r\nbirds, such as some of the Birds of Paradise, the Argus pheasant and\r\npeacock, do not cast their plumes during the winter; and it can hardly\r\nbe maintained that the constitution of these birds, at least of the\r\nGallinaceae, renders a double moult impossible, for the ptarmigan\r\nmoults thrice in the year. (33. See Gould’s ‘Birds of Great Britain.’)\r\nHence it must be considered as doubtful whether the many species which\r\nmoult their ornamental plumes or lose their bright colours during the\r\nwinter, have acquired this habit on account of the inconvenience or\r\ndanger which they would otherwise have suffered.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, that the habit of moulting twice in the year was\r\nin most or all cases first acquired for some distinct purpose, perhaps\r\nfor gaining a warmer winter covering; and that variations in the\r\nplumage occurring during the summer were accumulated through sexual\r\nselection, and transmitted to the offspring at the same season of the\r\nyear; that such variations were inherited either by both sexes or by\r\nthe males alone, according to the form of inheritance which prevailed.\r\nThis appears more probable than that the species in all cases\r\noriginally tended to retain their ornamental plumage during the winter,\r\nbut were saved from this through natural selection, resulting from the\r\ninconvenience or danger thus caused.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in this chapter to shew that the arguments are not\r\ntrustworthy in favour of the view that weapons, bright colours, and\r\nvarious ornaments, are now confined to the males owing to the\r\nconversion, by natural selection, of the equal transmission of\r\ncharacters to both sexes, into transmission to the male sex alone. It\r\nis also doubtful whether the colours of many female birds are due to\r\nthe preservation, for the sake of protection, of variations which were\r\nfrom the first limited in their transmission to the female sex. But it\r\nwill be convenient to defer any further discussion on this subject\r\nuntil I treat, in the following chapter, of the differences in plumage\r\nbetween the young and old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nBIRDS—concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immature plumage in relation to the character of the plumage in\r\nboth sexes when adult—Six classes of cases—Sexual differences between\r\nthe males of closely-allied or representative species—The female\r\nassuming the characters of the male—Plumage of the young in relation to\r\nthe summer and winter plumage of the adults—On the increase of beauty\r\nin the birds of the world—Protective colouring—Conspicuously coloured\r\nbirds—Novelty appreciated—Summary of the four chapters on Birds.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the transmission of characters, as limited by age,\r\nin reference to sexual selection. The truth and importance of the\r\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages need not here be\r\ndiscussed, as enough has already been said on the subject. Before\r\ngiving the several rather complex rules or classes of cases, under\r\nwhich the differences in plumage between the young and the old, as far\r\nas known to me, may be included, it will be well to make a few\r\npreliminary remarks.\r\n\r\nWith animals of all kinds when the adults differ in colour from the\r\nyoung, and the colours of the latter are not, as far as we can see, of\r\nany special service, they may generally be attributed, like various\r\nembryological structures, to the retention of a former character. But\r\nthis view can be maintained with confidence, only when the young of\r\nseveral species resemble each other closely, and likewise resemble\r\nother adult species belonging to the same group; for the latter are the\r\nliving proofs that such a state of things was formerly possible. Young\r\nlions and pumas are marked with feeble stripes or rows of spots, and as\r\nmany allied species both young and old are similarly marked, no\r\nbeliever in evolution will doubt that the progenitor of the lion and\r\npuma was a striped animal, and that the young have retained vestiges of\r\nthe stripes, like the kittens of black cats, which are not in the least\r\nstriped when grown up. Many species of deer, which when mature are not\r\nspotted, are whilst young covered with white spots, as are likewise\r\nsome few species in the adult state. So again the young in the whole\r\nfamily of pigs (Suidae), and in certain rather distantly allied\r\nanimals, such as the tapir, are marked with dark longitudinal stripes;\r\nbut here we have a character apparently derived from an extinct\r\nprogenitor, and now preserved by the young alone. In all such cases the\r\nold have had their colours changed in the course of time, whilst the\r\nyoung have remained but little altered, and this has been effected\r\nthrough the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages.\r\n\r\nThis same principle applies to many birds belonging to various groups,\r\nin which the young closely resemble each other, and differ much from\r\ntheir respective adult parents. The young of almost all the\r\nGallinaceae, and of some distantly allied birds such as ostriches, are\r\ncovered with longitudinally striped down; but this character points\r\nback to a state of things so remote that it hardly concerns us. Young\r\ncross-bills (Loxia) have at first straight beaks like those of other\r\nfinches, and in their immature striated plumage they resemble the\r\nmature red-pole and female siskin, as well as the young of the\r\ngoldfinch, greenfinch, and some other allied species. The young of many\r\nkinds of buntings (Emberiza) resemble one another, and likewise the\r\nadult state of the common bunting, E. miliaria. In almost the whole\r\nlarge group of thrushes the young have their breasts spotted—a\r\ncharacter which is retained throughout life by many species, but is\r\nquite lost by others, as by the Turdus migratorius. So again with many\r\nthrushes, the feathers on the back are mottled before they are moulted\r\nfor the first time, and this character is retained for life by certain\r\neastern species. The young of many species of shrikes (Lanius), of some\r\nwoodpeckers, and of an Indian pigeon (Chalcophaps indicus), are\r\ntransversely striped on the under surface; and certain allied species\r\nor whole genera are similarly marked when adult. In some closely-allied\r\nand resplendent Indian cuckoos (Chrysococcyx), the mature species\r\ndiffer considerably from one another in colour, but the young cannot be\r\ndistinguished. The young of an Indian goose (Sarkidiornis melanonotus)\r\nclosely resemble in plumage an allied genus, Dendrocygna, when mature.\r\n(1. In regard to thrushes, shrikes, and woodpeckers, see Mr. Blyth, in\r\nCharlesworth’s ‘Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. i. 1837, p. 304; also footnote\r\nto his translation of Cuvier’s ‘Regne Animal,’ p. 159. I give the case\r\nof Loxia on Mr. Blyth’s information. On thrushes, see also Audubon,\r\n‘Ornith. Biog.’ vol. ii. p. 195. On Chrysococcyx and Chalcophaps,\r\nBlyth, as quoted in Jerdon’s ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 485. On\r\nSarkidiornis, Blyth, in ‘Ibis,’ 1867, p. 175.) Similar facts will\r\nhereafter be given in regard to certain herons. Young black-grouse\r\n(Tetrao tetrix) resemble the young as well as the old of certain other\r\nspecies, for instance the red-grouse or T. scoticus. Finally, as Mr.\r\nBlyth, who has attended closely to this subject, has well remarked, the\r\nnatural affinities of many species are best exhibited in their immature\r\nplumage; and as the true affinities of all organic beings depend on\r\ntheir descent from a common progenitor, this remark strongly confirms\r\nthe belief that the immature plumage approximately shews us the former\r\nor ancestral condition of the species.\r\n\r\nAlthough many young birds, belonging to various families, thus give us\r\na glimpse of the plumage of their remote progenitors, yet there are\r\nmany other birds, both dull-coloured and bright-coloured, in which the\r\nyoung closely resemble their parents. In such cases the young of the\r\ndifferent species cannot resemble each other more closely than do the\r\nparents; nor can they strikingly resemble allied forms when adult. They\r\ngive us but little insight into the plumage of their progenitors,\r\nexcepting in so far that, when the young and the old are coloured in\r\nthe same general manner throughout a whole group of species, it is\r\nprobable that their progenitors were similarly coloured.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the classes of cases, under which the differences\r\nand resemblances between the plumage of the young and the old, in both\r\nsexes or in one sex alone, may be grouped. Rules of this kind were\r\nfirst enounced by Cuvier; but with the progress of knowledge they\r\nrequire some modification and amplification. This I have attempted to\r\ndo, as far as the extreme complexity of the subject permits, from\r\ninformation derived from various sources; but a full essay on this\r\nsubject by some competent ornithologist is much needed. In order to\r\nascertain to what extent each rule prevails, I have tabulated the facts\r\ngiven in four great works, namely, by Macgillivray on the birds of\r\nBritain, Audubon on those of North America, Jerdon on those of India,\r\nand Gould on those of Australia. I may here premise, first, that the\r\nseveral cases or rules graduate into each other; and secondly, that\r\nwhen the young are said to resemble their parents, it is not meant that\r\nthey are identically alike, for their colours are almost always less\r\nvivid, and the feathers are softer and often of a different shape.\r\n\r\nRULES OR CLASSES OF CASES.\r\n\r\nI. When the adult male is more beautiful or conspicuous than the adult\r\nfemale, the young of both sexes in their first plumage closely resemble\r\nthe adult female, as with the common fowl and peacock; or, as\r\noccasionally occurs, they resemble her much more closely than they do\r\nthe adult male.\r\n\r\nII. When the adult female is more conspicuous than the adult male, as\r\nsometimes though rarely occurs, the young of both sexes in their first\r\nplumage resemble the adult male.\r\n\r\nIII. When the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both\r\nsexes have a peculiar first plumage of their own, as with the robin.\r\n\r\nIV. When the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both\r\nsexes in their first plumage resemble the adults, as with the\r\nkingfisher, many parrots, crows, hedge-warblers.\r\n\r\nV. When the adults of both sexes have a distinct winter and summer\r\nplumage, whether or not the male differs from the female, the young\r\nresemble the adults of both sexes in their winter dress, or much more\r\nrarely in their summer dress, or they resemble the females alone. Or\r\nthe young may have an intermediate character; or again they may differ\r\ngreatly from the adults in both their seasonal plumages.\r\n\r\nVI. In some few cases the young in their first plumage differ from each\r\nother according to sex; the young males resembling more or less closely\r\nthe adult males, and the young females more or less closely the adult\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nCLASS I. — In this class, the young of both sexes more or less closely\r\nresemble the adult female, whilst the adult male differs from the adult\r\nfemale, often in the most conspicuous manner. Innumerable instances in\r\nall Orders could be given; it will suffice to call to mind the common\r\npheasant, duck, and house-sparrow. The cases under this class graduate\r\ninto others. Thus the two sexes when adult may differ so slightly, and\r\nthe young so slightly from the adults, that it is doubtful whether such\r\ncases ought to come under the present, or under the third or fourth\r\nclasses. So again the young of the two sexes, instead of being quite\r\nalike, may differ in a slight degree from each other, as in our sixth\r\nclass. These transitional cases, however, are few, or at least are not\r\nstrongly pronounced, in comparison with those which come strictly under\r\nthe present class.\r\n\r\nThe force of the present law is well shewn in those groups, in which,\r\nas a general rule, the two sexes and the young are all alike; for when\r\nin these groups the male does differ from the female, as with certain\r\nparrots, kingfishers, pigeons, etc., the young of both sexes resemble\r\nthe adult female. (2. See, for instance, Mr. Gould’s account (‘Handbook\r\nto the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. p. 133) of Cyanalcyon (one of the\r\nKingfishers), in which, however, the young male, though resembling the\r\nadult female, is less brilliantly coloured. In some species of Dacelo\r\nthe males have blue tails, and the females brown ones; and Mr. R.B.\r\nSharpe informs me that the tail of the young male of D. gaudichaudi is\r\nat first brown. Mr. Gould has described (ibid. vol. ii. pp. 14, 20, 37)\r\nthe sexes and the young of certain black Cockatoos and of the King\r\nLory, with which the same rule prevails. Also Jerdon (‘Birds of India,’\r\nvol. i. p. 260) on the Palaeornis rosa, in which the young are more\r\nlike the female than the male. See Audubon (‘Ornithological Biography,’\r\nvol. ii. p. 475) on the two sexes and the young of Columba passerina.)\r\nWe see the same fact exhibited still more clearly in certain anomalous\r\ncases; thus the male of Heliothrix auriculata (one of the\r\nhumming-birds) differs conspicuously from the female in having a\r\nsplendid gorget and fine ear-tufts, but the female is remarkable from\r\nhaving a much longer tail than that of the male; now the young of both\r\nsexes resemble (with the exception of the breast being spotted with\r\nbronze) the adult female in all other respects, including the length of\r\nher tail, so that the tail of the male actually becomes shorter as he\r\nreaches maturity, which is a most unusual circumstance. (3. I owe this\r\ninformation to Mr. Gould, who shewed me the specimens; see also his\r\n‘Introduction to the Trochilidae,’ 1861, p. 120.) Again, the plumage of\r\nthe male goosander (Mergus merganser) is more conspicuously coloured\r\nthan that of the female, with the scapular and secondary wing-feathers\r\nmuch longer; but differently from what occurs, as far as I know, in any\r\nother bird, the crest of the adult male, though broader than that of\r\nthe female, is considerably shorter, being only a little above an inch\r\nin length; the crest of the female being two and a half inches long.\r\nNow the young of both sexes entirely resemble the adult female, so that\r\ntheir crests are actually of greater length, though narrower, than in\r\nthe adult male. (4. Macgillivray, ‘Hist. Brit. Birds,’ vol. v. pp.\r\n207-214.)\r\n\r\nWhen the young and the females closely resemble each other and both\r\ndiffer from the males, the most obvious conclusion is that the males\r\nalone have been modified. Even in the anomalous cases of the Heliothrix\r\nand Mergus, it is probable that originally both adult sexes were\r\nfurnished—the one species with a much elongated tail, and the other\r\nwith a much elongated crest—these characters having since been\r\npartially lost by the adult males from some unexplained cause, and\r\ntransmitted in their diminished state to their male offspring alone,\r\nwhen arrived at the corresponding age of maturity. The belief that in\r\nthe present class the male alone has been modified, as far as the\r\ndifferences between the male and the female together with her young are\r\nconcerned, is strongly supported by some remarkable facts recorded by\r\nMr. Blyth (5. See his admirable paper in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic\r\nSoc. of Bengal,’ vol. xix. 1850, p. 223; see also Jerdon, ‘Birds of\r\nIndia,’ vol. i. introduction, p. xxix. In regard to Tanysiptera, Prof.\r\nSchlegel told Mr. Blyth that he could distinguish several distinct\r\nraces, solely by comparing the adult males.), with respect to\r\nclosely-allied species which represent each other in distinct\r\ncountries. For with several of these representative species the adult\r\nmales have undergone a certain amount of change and can be\r\ndistinguished; the females and the young from the distinct countries\r\nbeing indistinguishable, and therefore absolutely unchanged. This is\r\nthe case with certain Indian chats (Thamnobia), with certain\r\nhoney-suckers (Nectarinia), shrikes (Tephrodornis), certain kingfishers\r\n(Tanysiptera), Kalij pheasants (Gallophasis), and tree-partridges\r\n(Arboricola).\r\n\r\nIn some analogous cases, namely with birds having a different summer\r\nand winter plumage, but with the two sexes nearly alike, certain\r\nclosely-allied species can easily be distinguished in their summer or\r\nnuptial plumage, yet are indistinguishable in their winter as well as\r\nin their immature plumage. This is the case with some of the\r\nclosely-allied Indian wagtails or Motacillae. Mr. Swinhoe (6. See also\r\nMr. Swinhoe, in ‘Ibis,’ July 1863, p. 131; and a previous paper, with\r\nan extract from a note by Mr. Blyth, in ‘Ibis,’ January, 1861, p. 25.)\r\ninforms me that three species of Ardeola, a genus of herons, which\r\nrepresent one another on separate continents, are “most strikingly\r\ndifferent” when ornamented with their summer plumes, but are hardly, if\r\nat all, distinguishable during the winter. The young also of these\r\nthree species in their immature plumage closely resemble the adults in\r\ntheir winter dress. This case is all the more interesting, because with\r\ntwo other species of Ardeola both sexes retain, during the winter and\r\nsummer, nearly the same plumage as that possessed by the three first\r\nspecies during the winter and in their immature state; and this\r\nplumage, which is common to several distinct species at different ages\r\nand seasons, probably shews us how the progenitors of the genus were\r\ncoloured. In all these cases, the nuptial plumage which we may assume\r\nwas originally acquired by the adult males during the breeding-season,\r\nand transmitted to the adults of both sexes at the corresponding\r\nseason, has been modified, whilst the winter and immature plumages have\r\nbeen left unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, how is it that in these latter cases the\r\nwinter plumage of both sexes, and in the former cases the plumage of\r\nthe adult females, as well as the immature plumage of the young, have\r\nnot been at all affected? The species which represent each other in\r\ndistinct countries will almost always have been exposed to somewhat\r\ndifferent conditions, but we can hardly attribute to this action the\r\nmodification of the plumage in the males alone, seeing that the females\r\nand the young, though similarly exposed, have not been affected. Hardly\r\nany fact shews us more clearly how subordinate in importance is the\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life, in comparison with the\r\naccumulation through selection of indefinite variations, than the\r\nsurprising difference between the sexes of many birds; for both will\r\nhave consumed the same food, and have been exposed to the same climate.\r\nNevertheless we are not precluded from believing that in the course of\r\ntime new conditions may produce some direct effect either on both\r\nsexes, or from their constitutional differences chiefly on one sex. We\r\nsee only that this is subordinate in importance to the accumulated\r\nresults of selection. Judging, however, from a wide-spread analogy,\r\nwhen a species migrates into a new country (and this must precede the\r\nformation of representative species), the changed conditions to which\r\nthey will almost always have been exposed will cause them to undergo a\r\ncertain amount of fluctuating variability. In this case sexual\r\nselection, which depends on an element liable to change—the taste or\r\nadmiration of the female—will have had new shades of colour or other\r\ndifferences to act on and accumulate; and as sexual selection is always\r\nat work, it would (from what we know of the results on domestic animals\r\nof man’s unintentional selection), be surprising if animals inhabiting\r\nseparate districts, which can never cross and thus blend their\r\nnewly-acquired characters, were not, after a sufficient lapse of time,\r\ndifferently modified. These remarks likewise apply to the nuptial or\r\nsummer plumage, whether confined to the males, or common to both sexes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the females of the above closely-allied or representative\r\nspecies, together with their young, differ hardly at all from one\r\nanother, so that the males alone can be distinguished, yet the females\r\nof most species within the same genus obviously differ from each other.\r\nThe differences, however, are rarely as great as between the males. We\r\nsee this clearly in the whole family of the Gallinaceae: the females,\r\nfor instance, of the common and Japan pheasant, and especially of the\r\ngold and Amherst pheasant —of the silver pheasant and the wild\r\nfowl—resemble one another very closely in colour, whilst the males\r\ndiffer to an extraordinary degree. So it is with the females of most of\r\nthe Cotingidae, Fringillidae, and many other families. There can indeed\r\nbe no doubt that, as a general rule, the females have been less\r\nmodified than the males. Some few birds, however, offer a singular and\r\ninexplicable exception; thus the females of Paradisea apoda and P.\r\npapuana differ from each other more than do their respective males (7.\r\nWallace, ‘The Malay Archipelago,’ vol. ii. 1869, p. 394.); the female\r\nof the latter species having the under surface pure white, whilst the\r\nfemale P. apoda is deep brown beneath. So, again, as I hear from\r\nProfessor Newton, the males of two species of Oxynotus (shrikes), which\r\nrepresent each other in the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon (8. These\r\nspecies are described with coloured figures, by M. F. Pollen, in\r\n‘Ibis,’ 1866, p. 275.), differ but little in colour, whilst the females\r\ndiffer much. In the Bourbon species the female appears to have\r\npartially retained an immature condition of plumage, for at first sight\r\nshe “might be taken for the young of the Mauritian species.” These\r\ndifferences may be compared with those inexplicable ones, which occur\r\nindependently of man’s selection in certain sub-breeds of the\r\ngame-fowl, in which the females are very different, whilst the males\r\ncan hardly be distinguished. (9. ‘Variation of Animals,’ etc., vol. i.\r\np. 251.)\r\n\r\nAs I account so largely by sexual selection for the differences between\r\nthe males of allied species, how can the differences between the\r\nfemales be accounted for in all ordinary cases? We need not here\r\nconsider the species which belong to distinct genera; for with these,\r\nadaptation to different habits of life, and other agencies, will have\r\ncome into play. In regard to the differences between the females within\r\nthe same genus, it appears to me almost certain, after looking through\r\nvarious large groups, that the chief agent has been the greater or less\r\ntransference to the female of the characters acquired by the males\r\nthrough sexual selection. In the several British finches, the two sexes\r\ndiffer either very slightly or considerably; and if we compare the\r\nfemales of the greenfinch, chaffinch, goldfinch, bullfinch, crossbill,\r\nsparrow, etc., we shall see that they differ from one another chiefly\r\nin the points in which they partially resemble their respective males;\r\nand the colours of the males may safely be attributed to sexual\r\nselection. With many gallinaceous species the sexes differ to an\r\nextreme degree, as with the peacock, pheasant, and fowl, whilst with\r\nother species there has been a partial or even complete transference of\r\ncharacter from the male to the female. The females of the several\r\nspecies of Polyplectron exhibit in a dim condition, and chiefly on the\r\ntail, the splendid ocelli of their males. The female partridge differs\r\nfrom the male only in the red mark on her breast being smaller; and the\r\nfemale wild turkey only in her colours being much duller. In the\r\nguinea-fowl the two sexes are indistinguishable. There is no\r\nimprobability in the plain, though peculiarly spotted plumage of this\r\nlatter bird having been acquired through sexual selection by the males,\r\nand then transmitted to both sexes; for it is not essentially different\r\nfrom the much more beautifully spotted plumage, characteristic of the\r\nmales alone of the Tragopan pheasants.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that, in some instances, the transference of\r\ncharacters from the male to the female has been effected apparently at\r\na remote period, the male having subsequently undergone great changes,\r\nwithout transferring to the female any of his later-gained characters.\r\nFor instance, the female and the young of the black-grouse (Tetrao\r\ntetrix) resemble pretty closely both sexes and the young of the\r\nred-grouse (T. scoticus); and we may consequently infer that the\r\nblack-grouse is descended from some ancient species, of which both\r\nsexes were coloured in nearly the same manner as the red-grouse. As\r\nboth sexes of this latter species are more distinctly barred during the\r\nbreeding-season than at any other time, and as the male differs\r\nslightly from the female in his more strongly-pronounced red and brown\r\ntints (10. Macgillivray, ‘History of British Birds,’ vol. i. pp.\r\n172-174.), we may conclude that his plumage has been influenced by\r\nsexual selection, at least to a certain extent. If so, we may further\r\ninfer that nearly similar plumage of the female black-grouse was\r\nsimilarly produced at some former period. But since this period the\r\nmale black-grouse has acquired his fine black plumage, with his forked\r\nand outwardly-curled tail-feathers; but of these characters there has\r\nhardly been any transference to the female, excepting that she shews in\r\nher tail a trace of the curved fork.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore conclude that the females of distinct though allied\r\nspecies have often had their plumage rendered more or less different by\r\nthe transference in various degrees of characters acquired by the males\r\nthrough sexual selection, both during former and recent times. But it\r\ndeserves especial attention that brilliant colours have been\r\ntransferred much more rarely than other tints. For instance, the male\r\nof the red-throated blue-breast (Cyanecula suecica) has a rich blue\r\nbreast, including a sub-triangular red mark; now marks of nearly the\r\nsame shape have been transferred to the female, but the central space\r\nis fulvous instead of red, and is surrounded by mottled instead of blue\r\nfeathers. The Gallinaceae offer many analogous cases; for none of the\r\nspecies, such as partridges, quails, guinea-fowls, etc., in which the\r\ncolours of the plumage have been largely transferred from the male to\r\nthe female, are brilliantly coloured. This is well exemplified with the\r\npheasants, in which the male is generally so much more brilliant than\r\nthe female; but with the Eared and Cheer pheasants (Crossoptilon\r\nauritum and Phasianus wallichii) the sexes closely resemble each other\r\nand their colours are dull. We may go so far as to believe that if any\r\npart of the plumage in the males of these two pheasants had been\r\nbrilliantly coloured, it would not have been transferred to the\r\nfemales. These facts strongly support Mr. Wallace’s view that with\r\nbirds which are exposed to much danger during incubation, the\r\ntransference of bright colours from the male to the female has been\r\nchecked through natural selection. We must not, however, forget that\r\nanother explanation, before given, is possible; namely, that the males\r\nwhich varied and became bright, whilst they were young and\r\ninexperienced, would have been exposed to much danger, and would\r\ngenerally have been destroyed; the older and more cautious males, on\r\nthe other hand, if they varied in a like manner, would not only have\r\nbeen able to survive, but would have been favoured in their rivalry\r\nwith other males. Now variations occurring late in life tend to be\r\ntransmitted exclusively to the same sex, so that in this case extremely\r\nbright tints would not have been transmitted to the females. On the\r\nother hand, ornaments of a less conspicuous kind, such as those\r\npossessed by the Eared and Cheer pheasants, would not have been\r\ndangerous, and if they appeared during early youth, would generally\r\nhave been transmitted to both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the effects of the partial transference of characters\r\nfrom the males to the females, some of the differences between the\r\nfemales of closely allied species may be attributed to the direct or\r\ndefinite action of the conditions of life. (11. See, on this subject,\r\nchap. xxiii. in the ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication.’) With the males, any such action would generally have\r\nbeen masked by the brilliant colours gained through sexual selection;\r\nbut not so with the females. Each of the endless diversities in plumage\r\nwhich we see in our domesticated birds is, of course, the result of\r\nsome definite cause; and under natural and more uniform conditions,\r\nsome one tint, assuming that it was in no way injurious, would almost\r\ncertainly sooner or later prevail. The free intercrossing of the many\r\nindividuals belonging to the same species would ultimately tend to make\r\nany change of colour, thus induced, uniform in character.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts that both sexes of many birds have had their colours\r\nadapted for the sake of protection; and it is possible that the females\r\nalone of some species may have been modified for this end. Although it\r\nwould be a difficult, perhaps an impossible process, as shewn in the\r\nlast chapter, to convert one form of transmission into another through\r\nselection, there would not be the least difficulty in adapting the\r\ncolours of the female, independently of those of the male, to\r\nsurrounding objects, through the accumulation of variations which were\r\nfrom the first limited in their transmission to the female sex. If the\r\nvariations were not thus limited, the bright tints of the male would be\r\ndeteriorated or destroyed. Whether the females alone of many species\r\nhave been thus specially modified, is at present very doubtful. I wish\r\nI could follow Mr. Wallace to the full extent; for the admission would\r\nremove some difficulties. Any variations which were of no service to\r\nthe female as a protection would be at once obliterated, instead of\r\nbeing lost simply by not being selected, or from free intercrossing, or\r\nfrom being eliminated when transferred to the male and in any way\r\ninjurious to him. Thus the plumage of the female would be kept constant\r\nin character. It would also be a relief if we could admit that the\r\nobscure tints of both sexes of many birds had been acquired and\r\npreserved for the sake of protection,—for example, of the hedge-warbler\r\nor kitty-wren (Accentor modularis and Troglodytes vulgaris), with\r\nrespect to which we have no sufficient evidence of the action of sexual\r\nselection. We ought, however, to be cautious in concluding that colours\r\nwhich appear to us dull, are not attractive to the females of certain\r\nspecies; we should bear in mind such cases as that of the common\r\nhouse-sparrow, in which the male differs much from the female, but does\r\nnot exhibit any bright tints. No one probably will dispute that many\r\ngallinaceous birds which live on the open ground, have acquired their\r\npresent colours, at least in part, for the sake of protection. We know\r\nhow well they are thus concealed; we know that ptarmigans, whilst\r\nchanging from their winter to their summer plumage, both of which are\r\nprotective, suffer greatly from birds of prey. But can we believe that\r\nthe very slight differences in tints and markings between, for\r\ninstance, the female black-grouse and red-grouse serve as a protection?\r\nAre partridges, as they are now coloured, better protected than if they\r\nhad resembled quails? Do the slight differences between the females of\r\nthe common pheasant, the Japan and gold pheasants, serve as a\r\nprotection, or might not their plumages have been interchanged with\r\nimpunity? From what Mr. Wallace has observed of the habits of certain\r\ngallinaceous birds in the East, he thinks that such slight differences\r\nare beneficial. For myself, I will only say that I am not convinced.\r\n\r\nFormerly when I was inclined to lay much stress on protection as\r\naccounting for the duller colours of female birds, it occurred to me\r\nthat possibly both sexes and the young might aboriginally have been\r\nequally bright coloured; but that subsequently, the females from the\r\ndanger incurred during incubation, and the young from being\r\ninexperienced, had been rendered dull as a protection. But this view is\r\nnot supported by any evidence, and is not probable; for we thus in\r\nimagination expose during past times the females and the young to\r\ndanger, from which it has subsequently been necessary to shield their\r\nmodified descendants. We have, also, to reduce, through a gradual\r\nprocess of selection, the females and the young to almost exactly the\r\nsame tints and markings, and to transmit them to the corresponding sex\r\nand period of life. On the supposition that the females and the young\r\nhave partaken during each stage of the process of modification of a\r\ntendency to be as brightly coloured as the males, it is also a somewhat\r\nstrange fact that the females have never been rendered dull-coloured\r\nwithout the young participating in the same change; for there are no\r\ninstances, as far as I can discover, of species with the females dull\r\nand the young bright coloured. A partial exception, however, is offered\r\nby the young of certain woodpeckers, for they have “the whole upper\r\npart of the head tinged with red,” which afterwards either decreases\r\ninto a mere circular red line in the adults of both sexes, or quite\r\ndisappears in the adult females. (12. Audubon, ‘Ornith. Biography,’\r\nvol. i. p. 193. Macgillivray, ‘History of British Birds,’ vol. iii. p.\r\n85. See also the case before given of Indopicus carlotta.)\r\n\r\nFinally, with respect to our present class of cases, the most probable\r\nview appears to be that successive variations in brightness or in other\r\nornamental characters, occurring in the males at a rather late period\r\nof life have alone been preserved; and that most or all of these\r\nvariations, owing to the late period of life at which they appeared,\r\nhave been from the first transmitted only to the adult male offspring.\r\nAny variations in brightness occurring in the females or in the young,\r\nwould have been of no service to them, and would not have been\r\nselected; and moreover, if dangerous, would have been eliminated. Thus\r\nthe females and the young will either have been left unmodified, or (as\r\nis much more common) will have been partially modified by receiving\r\nthrough transference from the males some of his successive variations.\r\nBoth sexes have perhaps been directly acted on by the conditions of\r\nlife to which they have long been exposed: but the females from not\r\nbeing otherwise much modified, will best exhibit any such effects.\r\nThese changes and all others will have been kept uniform by the free\r\nintercrossing of many individuals. In some cases, especially with\r\nground birds, the females and the young may possibly have been\r\nmodified, independently of the males, for the sake of protection, so as\r\nto have acquired the same dull-coloured plumage.\r\n\r\nCLASS II. — WHEN THE ADULT FEMALE IS MORE CONSPICUOUS THAN THE ADULT\r\nMALE, THE YOUNG OF BOTH SEXES IN THEIR FIRST PLUMAGE RESEMBLE THE ADULT\r\nMALE.\r\n\r\nThis class is exactly the reverse of the last, for the females are here\r\nbrighter coloured or more conspicuous than the males; and the young, as\r\nfar as they are known, resemble the adult males instead of the adult\r\nfemales. But the difference between the sexes is never nearly so great\r\nas with many birds in the first class, and the cases are comparatively\r\nrare. Mr. Wallace, who first called attention to the singular relation\r\nwhich exists between the less bright colours of the males and their\r\nperforming the duties of incubation, lays great stress on this point\r\n(13. ‘Westminster Review,’ July 1867, and A. Murray, ‘Journal of\r\nTravel,’ 1868, p. 83.), as a crucial test that obscure colours have\r\nbeen acquired for the sake of protection during the period of nesting.\r\nA different view seems to me more probable. As the cases are curious\r\nand not numerous, I will briefly give all that I have been able to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nIn one section of the genus Turnix, quail-like birds, the female is\r\ninvariably larger than the male (being nearly twice as large in one of\r\nthe Australian species), and this is an unusual circumstance with the\r\nGallinaceae. In most of the species the female is more distinctly\r\ncoloured and brighter than the male (14. For the Australian species,\r\nsee Gould’s ‘Handbook,’ etc., vol. ii. pp. 178, 180, 186, and 188. In\r\nthe British Museum specimens of the Australian Plain-wanderer\r\n(Pedionomus torquatus) may be seen, shewing similar sexual\r\ndifferences.), but in some few species the sexes are alike. In Turnix\r\ntaigoor of India the male “wants the black on the throat and neck, and\r\nthe whole tone of the plumage is lighter and less pronounced than that\r\nof the female.” The female appears to be noisier, and is certainly much\r\nmore pugnacious than the male; so that the females and not the males\r\nare often kept by the natives for fighting, like game-cocks. As male\r\nbirds are exposed by the English bird-catchers for a decoy near a trap,\r\nin order to catch other males by exciting their rivalry, so the females\r\nof this Turnix are employed in India. When thus exposed the females\r\nsoon begin their “loud purring call, which can be heard a long way off,\r\nand any females within ear-shot run rapidly to the spot, and commence\r\nfighting with the caged bird.” In this way from twelve to twenty birds,\r\nall breeding females, may be caught in the course of a single day. The\r\nnatives assert that the females after laying their eggs associate in\r\nflocks, and leave the males to sit on them. There is no reason to doubt\r\nthe truth of this assertion, which is supported by some observations\r\nmade in China by Mr. Swinhoe. (15. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii.\r\np. 596. Mr. Swinhoe, in ‘Ibis,’ 1865, p. 542; 1866, pp. 131, 405.) Mr.\r\nBlyth believes, that the young of both sexes resemble the adult male.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 62. Rhynchaea capensis (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nThe females of the three species of Painted Snipes (Rhynchaea, Fig. 62)\r\n“are not only larger but much more richly coloured than the males.”\r\n(16. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 677.) With all other birds\r\nin which the trachea differs in structure in the two sexes it is more\r\ndeveloped and complex in the male than in the female; but in the\r\nRhynchaea australis it is simple in the male, whilst in the female it\r\nmakes four distinct convolutions before entering the lungs. (17.\r\nGould’s ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol. ii. p. 275.) The\r\nfemale therefore of this species has acquired an eminently masculine\r\ncharacter. Mr. Blyth ascertained, by examining many specimens, that the\r\ntrachea is not convoluted in either sex of R. bengalensis, which\r\nspecies resembles R. australis so closely, that it can hardly be\r\ndistinguished except by its shorter toes. This fact is another striking\r\ninstance of the law that secondary sexual characters are often widely\r\ndifferent in closely-allied forms, though it is a very rare\r\ncircumstance when such differences relate to the female sex. The young\r\nof both sexes of R. bengalensis in their first plumage are said to\r\nresemble the mature male. (18. ‘The Indian Field,’ Sept. 1858, p. 3.)\r\nThere is also reason to believe that the male undertakes the duty of\r\nincubation, for Mr. Swinhoe (19. ‘Ibis,’ 1866, p. 298.) found the\r\nfemales before the close of the summer associated in flocks, as occurs\r\nwith the females of the Turnix.\r\n\r\nThe females of Phalaropus fulicarius and P. hyperboreus are larger, and\r\nin their summer plumage “more gaily attired than the males.” But the\r\ndifference in colour between the sexes is far from conspicuous.\r\nAccording to Professor Steenstrup, the male alone of P. fulicarius\r\nundertakes the duty of incubation; this is likewise shewn by the state\r\nof his breast-feathers during the breeding-season. The female of the\r\ndotterel plover (Eudromias morinellus) is larger than the male, and has\r\nthe red and black tints on the lower surface, the white crescent on the\r\nbreast, and the stripes over the eyes, more strongly pronounced. The\r\nmale also takes at least a share in hatching the eggs; but the female\r\nlikewise attends to the young. (20. For these several statements, see\r\nMr. Gould’s ‘Birds of Great Britain.’ Prof. Newton informs me that he\r\nhas long been convinced, from his own observations and from those of\r\nothers, that the males of the above-named species take either the whole\r\nor a large share of the duties of incubation, and that they “shew much\r\ngreater devotion towards their young, when in danger, than do the\r\nfemales.” So it is, as he informs me, with Limosa lapponica and some\r\nfew other Waders, in which the females are larger and have more\r\nstrongly contrasted colours than the males.) I have not been able to\r\ndiscover whether with these species the young resemble the adult males\r\nmore closely than the adult females; for the comparison is somewhat\r\ndifficult to make on account of the double moult.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the ostrich Order: the male of the common cassowary\r\n(Casuarius galeatus) would be thought by any one to be the female, from\r\nhis smaller size and from the appendages and naked skin about his head\r\nbeing much less brightly coloured; and I am informed by Mr. Bartlett\r\nthat in the Zoological Gardens, it is certainly the male alone who sits\r\non the eggs and takes care of the young. (21. The natives of Ceram\r\n(Wallace, ‘Malay Archipelago,’ vol. ii. p. 150) assert that the male\r\nand female sit alternately on the eggs; but this assertion, as Mr.\r\nBartlett thinks, may be accounted for by the female visiting the nest\r\nto lay her eggs.) The female is said by Mr. T.W. Wood (22. The\r\n‘Student,’ April 1870, p. 124.) to exhibit during the breeding-season a\r\nmost pugnacious disposition; and her wattles then become enlarged and\r\nmore brilliantly coloured. So again the female of one of the emus\r\n(Dromoeus irroratus) is considerably larger than the male, and she\r\npossesses a slight top-knot, but is otherwise indistinguishable in\r\nplumage. She appears, however, “to have greater power, when angry or\r\notherwise excited, of erecting, like a turkey-cock, the feathers of her\r\nneck and breast. She is usually the more courageous and pugilistic. She\r\nmakes a deep hollow guttural boom especially at night, sounding like a\r\nsmall gong. The male has a slenderer frame and is more docile, with no\r\nvoice beyond a suppressed hiss when angry, or a croak.” He not only\r\nperforms the whole duty of incubation, but has to defend the young from\r\ntheir mother; “for as soon as she catches sight of her progeny she\r\nbecomes violently agitated, and notwithstanding the resistance of the\r\nfather appears to use her utmost endeavours to destroy them. For months\r\nafterwards it is unsafe to put the parents together, violent quarrels\r\nbeing the inevitable result, in which the female generally comes off\r\nconqueror.” (23. See the excellent account of the habits of this bird\r\nunder confinement, by Mr. A.W. Bennett, in ‘Land and Water,’ May 1868,\r\np. 233.) So that with this emu we have a complete reversal not only of\r\nthe parental and incubating instincts, but of the usual moral qualities\r\nof the two sexes; the females being savage, quarrelsome, and noisy, the\r\nmales gentle and good. The case is very different with the African\r\nostrich, for the male is somewhat larger than the female and has finer\r\nplumes with more strongly contrasted colours; nevertheless he\r\nundertakes the whole duty of incubation. (24. Mr. Sclater, on the\r\nincubation of the Struthiones, ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ June 9, 1863. So it\r\nis with the Rhea darwinii: Captain Musters says (‘At Home with the\r\nPatagonians,’ 1871, p. 128), that the male is larger, stronger and\r\nswifter than the female, and of slightly darker colours; yet he takes\r\nsole charge of the eggs and of the young, just as does the male of the\r\ncommon species of Rhea.)\r\n\r\nI will specify the few other cases known to me, in which the female is\r\nmore conspicuously coloured than the male, although nothing is known\r\nabout the manner of incubation. With the carrion-hawk of the Falkland\r\nIslands (Milvago leucurus) I was much surprised to find by dissection\r\nthat the individuals, which had all their tints strongly pronounced,\r\nwith the cere and legs orange-coloured, were the adult females; whilst\r\nthose with duller plumage and grey legs were the males or the young. In\r\nan Australian tree-creeper (Climacteris erythrops) the female differs\r\nfrom the male in “being adorned with beautiful, radiated, rufous\r\nmarkings on the throat, the male having this part quite plain.” Lastly,\r\nin an Australian night-jar “the female always exceeds the male in size\r\nand in the brilliance of her tints; the males, on the other hand, have\r\ntwo white spots on the primaries more conspicuous than in the female.”\r\n(25. For the Milvago, see ‘Zoology of the Voyage of the “Beagle,”\r\nBirds,’ 1841, p. 16. For the Climacteris and night-jar (Eurostopodus),\r\nsee Gould’s ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. pp. 602 and\r\n97. The New Zealand shieldrake (Tadorna variegata) offers a quite\r\nanomalous case; the head of the female is pure white, and her back is\r\nredder than that of the male; the head of the male is of a rich dark\r\nbronzed colour, and his back is clothed with finely pencilled\r\nslate-coloured feathers, so that altogether he may be considered as the\r\nmore beautiful of the two. He is larger and more pugnacious than the\r\nfemale, and does not sit on the eggs. So that in all these respects\r\nthis species comes under our first class of cases; but Mr. Sclater\r\n(‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1866, p. 150) was much\r\nsurprised to observe that the young of both sexes, when about three\r\nmonths old, resembled in their dark heads and necks the adult males,\r\ninstead of the adult females; so that it would appear in this case that\r\nthe females have been modified, whilst the males and the young have\r\nretained a former state of plumage.)\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the cases in which female birds are more conspicuously\r\ncoloured than the males, with the young in their immature plumage\r\nresembling the adult males instead of the adult females, as in the\r\nprevious class, are not numerous, though they are distributed in\r\nvarious Orders. The amount of difference, also, between the sexes is\r\nincomparably less than that which frequently occurs in the last class;\r\nso that the cause of the difference, whatever it may have been, has\r\nhere acted on the females either less energetically or less\r\npersistently than on the males in the last class. Mr. Wallace believes\r\nthat the males have had their colours rendered less conspicuous for the\r\nsake of protection during the period of incubation; but the difference\r\nbetween the sexes in hardly any of the foregoing cases appears\r\nsufficiently great for this view to be safely accepted. In some of the\r\ncases, the brighter tints of the female are almost confined to the\r\nlower surface, and the males, if thus coloured, would not have been\r\nexposed to danger whilst sitting on the eggs. It should also be borne\r\nin mind that the males are not only in a slight degree less\r\nconspicuously coloured than the females, but are smaller and weaker.\r\nThey have, moreover, not only acquired the maternal instinct of\r\nincubation, but are less pugnacious and vociferous than the females,\r\nand in one instance have simpler vocal organs. Thus an almost complete\r\ntransposition of the instincts, habits, disposition, colour, size, and\r\nof some points of structure, has been effected between the two sexes.\r\n\r\nNow if we might assume that the males in the present class have lost\r\nsome of that ardour which is usual to their sex, so that they no longer\r\nsearch eagerly for the females; or, if we might assume that the females\r\nhave become much more numerous than the males—and in the case of one\r\nIndian Turnix the females are said to be “much more commonly met with\r\nthan the males” (26. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 598.)—then\r\nit is not improbable that the females would have been led to court the\r\nmales, instead of being courted by them. This indeed is the case to a\r\ncertain extent with some birds, as we have seen with the peahen, wild\r\nturkey, and certain kinds of grouse. Taking as our guide the habits of\r\nmost male birds, the greater size and strength as well as the\r\nextraordinary pugnacity of the females of the Turnix and emu, must mean\r\nthat they endeavour to drive away rival females, in order to gain\r\npossession of the male; and on this view all the facts become clear;\r\nfor the males would probably be most charmed or excited by the females\r\nwhich were the most attractive to them by their bright colours, other\r\nornaments, or vocal powers. Sexual selection would then do its work,\r\nsteadily adding to the attractions of the females; the males and the\r\nyoung being left not at all, or but little modified.\r\n\r\nCLASS III. — WHEN THE ADULT MALE RESEMBLES THE ADULT FEMALE, THE YOUNG\r\nOF BOTH SEXES HAVE A PECULIAR FIRST PLUMAGE OF THEIR OWN.\r\n\r\nIn this class the sexes when adult resemble each other, and differ from\r\nthe young. This occurs with many birds of many kinds. The male robin\r\ncan hardly be distinguished from the female, but the young are widely\r\ndifferent, with their mottled dusky-olive and brown plumage. The male\r\nand female of the splendid scarlet ibis are alike, whilst the young are\r\nbrown; and the scarlet colour, though common to both sexes, is\r\napparently a sexual character, for it is not well developed in either\r\nsex under confinement; and a loss of colour often occurs with brilliant\r\nmales when they are confined. With many species of herons the young\r\ndiffer greatly from the adults; and the summer plumage of the latter,\r\nthough common to both sexes, clearly has a nuptial character. Young\r\nswans are slate-coloured, whilst the mature birds are pure white; but\r\nit would be superfluous to give additional instances. These differences\r\nbetween the young and the old apparently depend, as in the last two\r\nclasses, on the young having retained a former or ancient state of\r\nplumage, whilst the old of both sexes have acquired a new one. When the\r\nadults are bright coloured, we may conclude from the remarks just made\r\nin relation to the scarlet ibis and to many herons, and from the\r\nanalogy of the species in the first class, that such colours have been\r\nacquired through sexual selection by the nearly mature males; but that,\r\ndifferently from what occurs in the first two classes, the\r\ntransmission, though limited to the same age, has not been limited to\r\nthe same sex. Consequently, the sexes when mature resemble each other\r\nand differ from the young.\r\n\r\nCLASS IV. — WHEN THE ADULT MALE RESEMBLES THE ADULT FEMALE, THE YOUNG\r\nOF BOTH SEXES IN THEIR FIRST PLUMAGE RESEMBLE THE ADULTS.\r\n\r\nIn this class the young and the adults of both sexes, whether\r\nbrilliantly or obscurely coloured, resemble each other. Such cases are,\r\nI think, more common than those in the last class. We have in England\r\ninstances in the kingfisher, some woodpeckers, the jay, magpie, crow,\r\nand many small dull-coloured birds, such as the hedge-warbler or\r\nkitty-wren. But the similarity in plumage between the young and the old\r\nis never complete, and graduates away into dissimilarity. Thus the\r\nyoung of some members of the kingfisher family are not only less\r\nvividly coloured than the adults, but many of the feathers on the lower\r\nsurface are edged with brown (27. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. pp.\r\n222, 228. Gould’s ‘Handbook to the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. pp.\r\n124, 130.),—a vestige probably of a former state of the plumage.\r\nFrequently in the same group of birds, even within the same genus, for\r\ninstance in an Australian genus of parrakeets (Platycercus), the young\r\nof some species closely resemble, whilst the young of other species\r\ndiffer considerably, from their parents of both sexes, which are alike.\r\n(28. Gould, ibid. vol. ii. pp. 37, 46, 56.) Both sexes and the young of\r\nthe common jay are closely similar; but in the Canada jay (Perisoreus\r\ncanadensis) the young differ so much from their parents that they were\r\nformerly described as distinct species. (29. Audubon, ‘Ornith.\r\nBiography,’ vol. ii. p. 55.)\r\n\r\nI may remark before proceeding that, under the present and next two\r\nclasses of cases, the facts are so complex and the conclusions so\r\ndoubtful, that any one who feels no especial interest in the subject\r\nhad better pass them over.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant or conspicuous colours which characterise many birds in\r\nthe present class, can rarely or never be of service to them as a\r\nprotection; so that they have probably been gained by the males through\r\nsexual selection, and then transferred to the females and the young. It\r\nis, however, possible that the males may have selected the more\r\nattractive females; and if these transmitted their characters to their\r\noffspring of both sexes, the same results would follow as from the\r\nselection of the more attractive males by the females. But there is\r\nevidence that this contingency has rarely, if ever, occurred in any of\r\nthose groups of birds in which the sexes are generally alike; for, if\r\neven a few of the successive variations had failed to be transmitted to\r\nboth sexes, the females would have slightly exceeded the males in\r\nbeauty. Exactly the reverse occurs under nature; for, in almost every\r\nlarge group in which the sexes generally resemble each other, the males\r\nof some few species are in a slight degree more brightly coloured than\r\nthe females. It is again possible that the females may have selected\r\nthe more beautiful males, these males having reciprocally selected the\r\nmore beautiful females; but it is doubtful whether this double process\r\nof selection would be likely to occur, owing to the greater eagerness\r\nof one sex than the other, and whether it would be more efficient than\r\nselection on one side alone. It is, therefore, the most probable view\r\nthat sexual selection has acted, in the present class, as far as\r\nornamental characters are concerned, in accordance with the general\r\nrule throughout the animal kingdom, that is, on the males; and that\r\nthese have transmitted their gradually-acquired colours, either equally\r\nor almost equally, to their offspring of both sexes.\r\n\r\nAnother point is more doubtful, namely, whether the successive\r\nvariations first appeared in the males after they had become nearly\r\nmature, or whilst quite young. In either case sexual selection must\r\nhave acted on the male when he had to compete with rivals for the\r\npossession of the female; and in both cases the characters thus\r\nacquired have been transmitted to both sexes and all ages. But these\r\ncharacters if acquired by the males when adult, may have been\r\ntransmitted at first to the adults alone, and at some subsequent period\r\ntransferred to the young. For it is known that, when the law of\r\ninheritance at corresponding ages fails, the offspring often inherit\r\ncharacters at an earlier age than that at which they first appeared in\r\ntheir parents. (30. ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,’ vol. ii. p. 79.) Cases apparently of this kind have\r\nbeen observed with birds in a state of nature. For instance Mr. Blyth\r\nhas seen specimens of Lanius rufus and of Colymbus glacialis which had\r\nassumed whilst young, in a quite anomalous manner, the adult plumage of\r\ntheir parents. (31. ‘Charlesworth’s Magazine of Natural History,’ vol.\r\ni. 1837, pp. 305, 306.) Again, the young of the common swan (Cygnus\r\nolor) do not cast off their dark feathers and become white until\r\neighteen months or two years old; but Dr. F. Forel has described the\r\ncase of three vigorous young birds, out of a brood of four, which were\r\nborn pure white. These young birds were not albinos, as shewn by the\r\ncolour of their beaks and legs, which nearly resembled the same parts\r\nin the adults. (32. ‘Bulletin de la Soc. Vaudoise des Sc. Nat.’ vol. x.\r\n1869, p. 132. The young of the Polish swan, Cygnus immutabilis of\r\nYarrell, are always white; but this species, as Mr. Sclater informs me,\r\nis believed to be nothing more than a variety of the domestic swan\r\n(Cygnus olor).)\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to illustrate the above three modes by which, in\r\nthe present class, the two sexes and the young may have come to\r\nresemble each other, by the curious case of the genus Passer. (33. I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Blyth for information in regard to this genus. The\r\nsparrow of Palestine belongs to the sub-genus Petronia.) In the\r\nhouse-sparrow (P. domesticus) the male differs much from the female and\r\nfrom the young. The young and the females are alike, and resemble to a\r\nlarge extent both sexes and the young of the sparrow of Palestine (P.\r\nbrachydactylus), as well as of some allied species. We may therefore\r\nassume that the female and young of the house-sparrow approximately\r\nshew us the plumage of the progenitor of the genus. Now with the\r\ntree-sparrow (P. montanus) both sexes and the young closely resemble\r\nthe male of the house-sparrow; so that they have all been modified in\r\nthe same manner, and all depart from the typical colouring of their\r\nearly progenitor. This may have been effected by a male ancestor of the\r\ntree-sparrow having varied, firstly, when nearly mature; or, secondly,\r\nwhilst quite young, and by having in either case transmitted his\r\nmodified plumage to the females and the young; or, thirdly, he may have\r\nvaried when adult and transmitted his plumage to both adult sexes, and,\r\nowing to the failure of the law of inheritance at corresponding ages,\r\nat some subsequent period to his young.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to decide which of these three modes has generally\r\nprevailed throughout the present class of cases. That the males varied\r\nwhilst young, and transmitted their variations to their offspring of\r\nboth sexes, is the most probable. I may here add that I have, with\r\nlittle success, endeavoured, by consulting various works, to decide how\r\nfar the period of variation in birds has generally determined the\r\ntransmission of characters to one sex or to both. The two rules, often\r\nreferred to (namely, that variations occurring late in life are\r\ntransmitted to one and the same sex, whilst those which occur early in\r\nlife are transmitted to both sexes), apparently hold good in the first\r\n(34. For instance, the males of Tanagra aestiva and Fringilla cyanea\r\nrequire three years, the male of Fringilla ciris four years, to\r\ncomplete their beautiful plumage. (See Audubon, ‘Ornith. Biography,’\r\nvol. i. pp. 233, 280, 378). The Harlequin duck takes three years (ibid.\r\nvol. iii. p. 614). The male of the Gold pheasant, as I hear from Mr.\r\nJenner Weir, can be distinguished from the female when about three\r\nmonths old, but he does not acquire his full splendour until the end of\r\nthe September in the following year.), second, and fourth classes of\r\ncases; but they fail in the third, often in the fifth (35. Thus the\r\nIbis tantalus and Grus americanus take four years, the Flamingo several\r\nyears, and the Ardea ludovicana two years, before they acquire their\r\nperfect plumage. See Audubon, ibid. vol. i. p. 221; vol. iii. pp. 133,\r\n139, 211.), and in the sixth small class. They apply, however, as far\r\nas I can judge, to a considerable majority of the species; and we must\r\nnot forget the striking generalisation by Dr. W. Marshall with respect\r\nto the protuberances on the heads of birds. Whether or not the two\r\nrules generally hold good, we may conclude from the facts given in the\r\neighth chapter, that the period of variation is one important element\r\nin determining the form of transmission.\r\n\r\nWith birds it is difficult to decide by what standard we ought to judge\r\nof the earliness or lateness of the period of variation, whether by the\r\nage in reference to the duration of life, or to the power of\r\nreproduction, or to the number of moults through which the species\r\npasses. The moulting of birds, even within the same family, sometimes\r\ndiffers much without any assignable cause. Some birds moult so early,\r\nthat nearly all the body feathers are cast off before the first\r\nwing-feathers are fully grown; and we cannot believe that this was the\r\nprimordial state of things. When the period of moulting has been\r\naccelerated, the age at which the colours of the adult plumage are\r\nfirst developed will falsely appear to us to be earlier than it really\r\nis. This may be illustrated by the practice followed by some\r\nbird-fanciers, who pull out a few feathers from the breast of nestling\r\nbullfinches, and from the head or neck of young gold-pheasants, in\r\norder to ascertain their sex; for in the males, these feathers are\r\nimmediately replaced by coloured ones. (36. Mr. Blyth, in\r\nCharlesworth’s ‘Magazine of Natural History,’ vol. i. 1837, p. 300. Mr.\r\nBartlett has informed me in regard to gold pheasants.) The actual\r\nduration of life is known in but few birds, so that we can hardly judge\r\nby this standard. And, with reference to the period at which the power\r\nof reproduction is gained, it is a remarkable fact that various birds\r\noccasionally breed whilst retaining their immature plumage. (37. I have\r\nnoticed the following cases in Audubon’s ‘Ornith. Biography.’ The\r\nredstart of America (Muscapica ruticilla, vol. i. p. 203). The Ibis\r\ntantalus takes four years to come to full maturity, but sometimes\r\nbreeds in the second year (vol. iii. p. 133). The Grus americanus takes\r\nthe same time, but breeds before acquiring its full plumage (vol. iii.\r\np. 211). The adults of Ardea caerulea are blue, and the young white;\r\nand white, mottled, and mature blue birds may all be seen breeding\r\ntogether (vol. iv. p. 58): but Mr. Blyth informs me that certain herons\r\napparently are dimorphic, for white and coloured individuals of the\r\nsame age may be observed. The Harlequin duck (Anas histrionica, Linn.)\r\ntakes three years to acquire its full plumage, though many birds breed\r\nin the second year (vol. iii. p. 614). The White-headed Eagle (Falco\r\nleucocephalus, vol. iii. p. 210) is likewise known to breed in its\r\nimmature state. Some species of Oriolus (according to Mr. Blyth and Mr.\r\nSwinhoe, in ‘Ibis,’ July 1863, p. 68) likewise breed before they attain\r\ntheir full plumage.)\r\n\r\nThe fact of birds breeding in their immature plumage seems opposed to\r\nthe belief that sexual selection has played as important a part, as I\r\nbelieve it has, in giving ornamental colours, plumes, etc., to the\r\nmales, and, by means of equal transmission, to the females of many\r\nspecies. The objection would be a valid one, if the younger and less\r\nornamented males were as successful in winning females and propagating\r\ntheir kind, as the older and more beautiful males. But we have no\r\nreason to suppose that this is the case. Audubon speaks of the breeding\r\nof the immature males of Ibis tantalus as a rare event, as does Mr.\r\nSwinhoe, in regard to the immature males of Oriolus. (38. See footnote\r\n37 above.) If the young of any species in their immature plumage were\r\nmore successful in winning partners than the adults, the adult plumage\r\nwould probably soon be lost, as the males would prevail, which retained\r\ntheir immature dress for the longest period, and thus the character of\r\nthe species would ultimately be modified. (39. Other animals, belonging\r\nto quite distinct classes, are either habitually or occasionally\r\ncapable of breeding before they have fully acquired their adult\r\ncharacters. This is the case with the young males of the salmon.\r\nSeveral amphibians have been known to breed whilst retaining their\r\nlarval structure. Fritz Müller has shewn (‘Facts and arguments for\r\nDarwin,’ Eng. trans. 1869, p. 79) that the males of several amphipod\r\ncrustaceans become sexually mature whilst young; and I infer that this\r\nis a case of premature breeding, because they have not as yet acquired\r\ntheir fully-developed claspers. All such facts are highly interesting,\r\nas bearing on one means by which species may undergo great\r\nmodifications of character.) If, on the other hand, the young never\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a female, the habit of early reproduction would\r\nperhaps be sooner or later eliminated, from being superfluous and\r\nentailing waste of power.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of certain birds goes on increasing in beauty during many\r\nyears after they are fully mature; this is the case with the train of\r\nthe peacock, with some of the birds of paradise, and with the crest and\r\nplumes of certain herons, for instance, the Ardea ludovicana. (40.\r\nJerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 507, on the peacock. Dr.\r\nMarshall thinks that the older and more brilliant males of birds of\r\nparadise, have an advantage over the younger males; see ‘Archives\r\nNeerlandaises,’ tom. vi. 1871.—On Ardea, Audubon, ibid. vol. iii. p.\r\n139.) But it is doubtful whether the continued development of such\r\nfeathers is the result of the selection of successive beneficial\r\nvariations (though this is the most probable view with birds of\r\nparadise) or merely of continuous growth. Most fishes continue\r\nincreasing in size, as long as they are in good health and have plenty\r\nof food; and a somewhat similar law may prevail with the plumes of\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nCLASS V. — WHEN THE ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES HAVE A DISTINCT WINTER AND\r\nSUMMER PLUMAGE, WHETHER OR NOT THE MALE DIFFERS FROM THE FEMALE, THE\r\nYOUNG RESEMBLE THE ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES IN THEIR WINTER DRESS, OR MUCH\r\nMORE RARELY IN THEIR SUMMER DRESS, OR THEY RESEMBLE THE FEMALES ALONE.\r\nOR THE YOUNG MAY HAVE AN INTERMEDIATE CHARACTER; OR, AGAIN, THEY MAY\r\nDIFFER GREATLY FROM THE ADULTS IN BOTH THEIR SEASONAL PLUMAGES.\r\n\r\nThe cases in this class are singularly complex; nor is this surprising,\r\nas they depend on inheritance, limited in a greater or less degree in\r\nthree different ways, namely, by sex, age, and the season of the year.\r\nIn some cases the individuals of the same species pass through at least\r\nfive distinct states of plumage. With the species, in which the male\r\ndiffers from the female during the summer season alone, or, which is\r\nrarer, during both seasons (41. For illustrative cases, see vol. iv. of\r\nMacgillivray’s ‘History of British Birds;’ on Tringa, etc., pp. 229,\r\n271; on the Machetes, p. 172; on the Charadrius hiaticula, p. 118; on\r\nthe Charadrius pluvialis, p. 94.), the young generally resemble the\r\nfemales,—as with the so-called goldfinch of North America, and\r\napparently with the splendid Maluri of Australia. (42. For the\r\ngoldfinch of N. America, Fringilla tristis, Linn., see Audubon,\r\n‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. i. p. 172. For the Maluri, Gould’s\r\n‘Handbook of the Birds of Australia,’ vol. i. p. 318.) With those\r\nspecies, the sexes of which are alike during both the summer and\r\nwinter, the young may resemble the adults, firstly, in their winter\r\ndress; secondly, and this is of much rarer occurrence, in their summer\r\ndress; thirdly, they may be intermediate between these two states; and,\r\nfourthly, they may differ greatly from the adults at all seasons. We\r\nhave an instance of the first of these four cases in one of the egrets\r\nof India (Buphus coromandus), in which the young and the adults of both\r\nsexes are white during the winter, the adults becoming golden-buff\r\nduring the summer.\r\n\r\nWith the gaper (Anastomus oscitans) of India we have a similar case,\r\nbut the colours are reversed: for the young and the adults of both\r\nsexes are grey and black during the winter, the adults becoming white\r\nduring the summer. (43. I am indebted to Mr. Blyth for information as\r\nto the Buphus; see also Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 749. On\r\nthe Anastomus, see Blyth, in ‘Ibis,’ 1867, p. 173.) As an instance of\r\nthe second case, the young of the razor-bill (Alca torda, Linn.), in an\r\nearly state of plumage, are coloured like the adults during the summer;\r\nand the young of the white-crowned sparrow of North America (Fringilla\r\nleucophrys), as soon as fledged, have elegant white stripes on their\r\nheads, which are lost by the young and the old during the winter. (44.\r\nOn the Alca, see Macgillivray, ‘Hist. Brit. Birds,’ vol. v. p. 347. On\r\nthe Fringilla leucophrys, Audubon, ibid. vol. ii. p. 89. I shall have\r\nhereafter to refer to the young of certain herons and egrets being\r\nwhite.) With respect to the third case, namely, that of the young\r\nhaving an intermediate character between the summer and winter adult\r\nplumages, Yarrell (45. ‘History of British Birds,’ vol. i. 1839, p.\r\n159.) insists that this occurs with many waders. Lastly, in regard to\r\nthe young differing greatly from both sexes in their adult summer and\r\nwinter plumages, this occurs with some herons and egrets of North\r\nAmerica and India,—the young alone being white.\r\n\r\nI will make only a few remarks on these complicated cases. When the\r\nyoung resemble the females in their summer dress, or the adults of both\r\nsexes in their winter dress, the cases differ from those given under\r\nClasses I. and III. only in the characters originally acquired by the\r\nmales during the breeding-season, having been limited in their\r\ntransmission to the corresponding season. When the adults have a\r\ndistinct summer and winter plumage, and the young differ from both, the\r\ncase is more difficult to understand. We may admit as probable that the\r\nyoung have retained an ancient state of plumage; we can account by\r\nsexual selection for the summer or nuptial plumage of the adults, but\r\nhow are we to account for their distinct winter plumage? If we could\r\nadmit that this plumage serves in all cases as a protection, its\r\nacquirement would be a simple affair; but there seems no good reason\r\nfor this admission. It may be suggested that the widely different\r\nconditions of life during the winter and summer have acted in a direct\r\nmanner on the plumage; this may have had some effect, but I have not\r\nmuch confidence in so great a difference as we sometimes see between\r\nthe two plumages, having been thus caused. A more probable explanation\r\nis, that an ancient style of plumage, partially modified through the\r\ntransference of some characters from the summer plumage, has been\r\nretained by the adults during the winter. Finally, all the cases in our\r\npresent class apparently depend on characters acquired by the adult\r\nmales, having been variously limited in their transmission according to\r\nage, season, and sex; but it would not be worth while to attempt to\r\nfollow out these complex relations.\r\n\r\nCLASS VI. — THE YOUNG IN THEIR FIRST PLUMAGE DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER\r\nACCORDING TO SEX; THE YOUNG MALES RESEMBLING MORE OR LESS CLOSELY THE\r\nADULT MALES, AND THE YOUNG FEMALES MORE OR LESS CLOSELY THE ADULT\r\nFEMALES.\r\n\r\nThe cases in the present class, though occurring in various groups, are\r\nnot numerous; yet it seems the most natural thing that the young should\r\nat first somewhat resemble the adults of the same sex, and gradually\r\nbecome more and more like them. The adult male blackcap (Sylvia\r\natricapilla) has a black head, that of the female being reddish-brown;\r\nand I am informed by Mr. Blyth, that the young of both sexes can be\r\ndistinguished by this character even as nestlings. In the family of\r\nthrushes an unusual number of similar cases have been noticed; thus,\r\nthe male blackbird (Turdus merula) can be distinguished in the nest\r\nfrom the female. The two sexes of the mocking bird (Turdus polyglottus,\r\nLinn.) differ very little from each other, yet the males can easily be\r\ndistinguished at a very early age from the females by showing more pure\r\nwhite. (46. Audubon, ‘Ornith. Biography,’ vol. i. p. 113.) The males of\r\na forest-thrush and of a rock-thrush (Orocetes erythrogastra and\r\nPetrocincla cyanea) have much of their plumage of a fine blue, whilst\r\nthe females are brown; and the nestling males of both species have\r\ntheir main wing and tail-feathers edged with blue whilst those of the\r\nfemale are edged with brown. (47. Mr. C.A. Wright, in ‘Ibis,’ vol. vi.\r\n1864, p. 65. Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. p. 515. See also on the\r\nblackbird, Blyth in Charlesworth’s ‘Magazine of Natural History,’ vol.\r\ni. 1837, p. 113.) In the young blackbird the wing-feathers assume their\r\nmature character and become black after the others; on the other hand,\r\nin the two species just named the wing-feathers become blue before the\r\nothers. The most probable view with reference to the cases in the\r\npresent class is that the males, differently from what occurs in Class\r\nI., have transmitted their colours to their male offspring at an\r\nearlier age than that at which they were first acquired; for, if the\r\nmales had varied whilst quite young, their characters would probably\r\nhave been transmitted to both sexes. (48. The following additional\r\ncases may be mentioned; the young males of Tanagra rubra can be\r\ndistinguished from the young females (Audubon, ‘Ornith. Biography,’\r\nvol. iv. p. 392), and so it is within the nestlings of a blue nuthatch,\r\nDendrophila frontalis of India (Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. p.\r\n389). Mr. Blyth also informs me that the sexes of the stonechat,\r\nSaxicola rubicola, are distinguishable at a very early age. Mr. Salvin\r\ngives (‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1870, p. 206) the case of a humming-bird,\r\nlike the following one of Eustephanus.)\r\n\r\nIn Aithurus polytmus, a humming-bird, the male is splendidly coloured\r\nblack and green, and two of the tail-feathers are immensely lengthened;\r\nthe female has an ordinary tail and inconspicuous colours; now the\r\nyoung males, instead of resembling the adult female, in accordance with\r\nthe common rule, begin from the first to assume the colours proper to\r\ntheir sex, and their tail-feathers soon become elongated. I owe this\r\ninformation to Mr. Gould, who has given me the following more striking\r\nand as yet unpublished case. Two humming-birds belonging to the genus\r\nEustephanus, both beautifully coloured, inhabit the small island of\r\nJuan Fernandez, and have always been ranked as specifically distinct.\r\nBut it has lately been ascertained that the one which is of a rich\r\nchestnut-brown colour with a golden-red head, is the male, whilst the\r\nother which is elegantly variegated with green and white with a\r\nmetallic green head is the female. Now the young from the first\r\nsomewhat resemble the adults of the corresponding sex, the resemblance\r\ngradually becoming more and more complete.\r\n\r\nIn considering this last case, if as before we take the plumage of the\r\nyoung as our guide, it would appear that both sexes have been rendered\r\nbeautiful independently; and not that one sex has partially transferred\r\nits beauty to the other. The male apparently has acquired his bright\r\ncolours through sexual selection in the same manner as, for instance,\r\nthe peacock or pheasant in our first class of cases; and the female in\r\nthe same manner as the female Rhynchaea or Turnix in our second class\r\nof cases. But there is much difficulty in understanding how this could\r\nhave been effected at the same time with the two sexes of the same\r\nspecies. Mr. Salvin states, as we have seen in the eighth chapter, that\r\nwith certain humming-birds the males greatly exceed the females in\r\nnumber, whilst with other species inhabiting the same country the\r\nfemales greatly exceed the males. If, then, we might assume that during\r\nsome former lengthened period the males of the Juan Fernandez species\r\nhad greatly exceeded the females in number, but that during another\r\nlengthened period the females had far exceeded the males, we could\r\nunderstand how the males at one time, and the females at another, might\r\nhave been rendered beautiful by the selection of the brighter coloured\r\nindividuals of either sex; both sexes transmitting their characters to\r\ntheir young at a rather earlier age than usual. Whether this is the\r\ntrue explanation I will not pretend to say; but the case is too\r\nremarkable to be passed over without notice.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen in all six classes, that an intimate relation exists\r\nbetween the plumage of the young and the adults, either of one sex or\r\nboth. These relations are fairly well explained on the principle that\r\none sex—this being in the great majority of cases the male—first\r\nacquired through variation and sexual selection bright colours or other\r\nornaments, and transmitted them in various ways, in accordance with the\r\nrecognised laws of inheritance. Why variations have occurred at\r\ndifferent periods of life, even sometimes with species of the same\r\ngroup, we do not know, but with respect to the form of transmission,\r\none important determining cause seems to be the age at which the\r\nvariations first appear.\r\n\r\nFrom the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, and from any\r\nvariations in colour which occurred in the males at an early age not\r\nbeing then selected—on the contrary being often eliminated as\r\ndangerous—whilst similar variations occurring at or near the period of\r\nreproduction have been preserved, it follows that the plumage of the\r\nyoung will often have been left unmodified, or but little modified. We\r\nthus get some insight into the colouring of the progenitors of our\r\nexisting species. In a vast number of species in five out of our six\r\nclasses of cases, the adults of one sex or of both are bright coloured,\r\nat least during the breeding-season, whilst the young are invariably\r\nless brightly coloured than the adults, or are quite dull coloured; for\r\nno instance is known, as far as I can discover, of the young of\r\ndull-coloured species displaying bright colours, or of the young of\r\nbright-coloured species being more brilliant than their parents. In the\r\nfourth class, however, in which the young and the old resemble each\r\nother, there are many species (though by no means all), of which the\r\nyoung are bright-coloured, and as these form old groups, we may infer\r\nthat their early progenitors were likewise bright. With this exception,\r\nif we look to the birds of the world, it appears that their beauty has\r\nbeen much increased since that period, of which their immature plumage\r\ngives us a partial record.\r\n\r\nON THE COLOUR OF THE PLUMAGE IN RELATION TO PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen that I cannot follow Mr. Wallace in the belief\r\nthat dull colours, when confined to the females, have been in most\r\ncases specially gained for the sake of protection. There can, however,\r\nbe no doubt, as formerly remarked, that both sexes of many birds have\r\nhad their colours modified, so as to escape the notice of their\r\nenemies; or in some instances, so as to approach their prey unobserved,\r\njust as owls have had their plumage rendered soft, that their flight\r\nmay not be overheard. Mr. Wallace remarks (49. ‘Westminster Review,’\r\nJuly 1867, p. 5.) that “it is only in the tropics, among forests which\r\nnever lose their foliage, that we find whole groups of birds, whose\r\nchief colour is green.” It will be admitted by every one, who has ever\r\ntried, how difficult it is to distinguish parrots in a leaf-covered\r\ntree. Nevertheless, we must remember that many parrots are ornamented\r\nwith crimson, blue, and orange tints, which can hardly be protective.\r\nWoodpeckers are eminently arboreal, but besides green species, there\r\nare many black, and black-and-white kinds—all the species being\r\napparently exposed to nearly the same dangers. It is therefore probable\r\nthat with tree-haunting birds, strongly-pronounced colours have been\r\nacquired through sexual selection, but that a green tint has been\r\nacquired oftener than any other, from the additional advantage of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nIn regard to birds which live on the ground, every one admits that they\r\nare coloured so as to imitate the surrounding surface. How difficult it\r\nis to see a partridge, snipe, woodcock, certain plovers, larks, and\r\nnight-jars when crouched on ground. Animals inhabiting deserts offer\r\nthe most striking cases, for the bare surface affords no concealment,\r\nand nearly all the smaller quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds depend for\r\nsafety on their colours. Mr. Tristram has remarked in regard to the\r\ninhabitants of the Sahara, that all are protected by their “isabelline\r\nor sand-colour.” (50. ‘Ibis,’ 1859, vol. i. p. 429, et seq. Dr. Rohlfs,\r\nhowever, remarks to me in a letter that according to his experience of\r\nthe Sahara, this statement is too strong.) Calling to my recollection\r\nthe desert-birds of South America, as well as most of the ground-birds\r\nof Great Britain, it appeared to me that both sexes in such cases are\r\ngenerally coloured nearly alike. Accordingly, I applied to Mr. Tristram\r\nwith respect to the birds of the Sahara, and he has kindly given me the\r\nfollowing information. There are twenty-six species belonging to\r\nfifteen genera, which manifestly have their plumage coloured in a\r\nprotective manner; and this colouring is all the more striking, as with\r\nmost of these birds it differs from that of their congeners. Both sexes\r\nof thirteen out of the twenty-six species are coloured in the same\r\nmanner; but these belong to genera in which this rule commonly\r\nprevails, so that they tell us nothing about the protective colours\r\nbeing the same in both sexes of desert-birds. Of the other thirteen\r\nspecies, three belong to genera in which the sexes usually differ from\r\neach other, yet here they have the sexes alike. In the remaining ten\r\nspecies, the male differs from the female; but the difference is\r\nconfined chiefly to the under surface of the plumage, which is\r\nconcealed when the bird crouches on the ground; the head and back being\r\nof the same sand-coloured hue in the two sexes. So that in these ten\r\nspecies the upper surfaces of both sexes have been acted on and\r\nrendered alike, through natural selection, for the sake of protection;\r\nwhilst the lower surfaces of the males alone have been diversified,\r\nthrough sexual selection, for the sake of ornament. Here, as both sexes\r\nare equally well protected, we clearly see that the females have not\r\nbeen prevented by natural selection from inheriting the colours of\r\ntheir male parents; so that we must look to the law of sexually-limited\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the world both sexes of many soft-billed birds,\r\nespecially those which frequent reeds or sedges, are obscurely\r\ncoloured. No doubt if their colours had been brilliant, they would have\r\nbeen much more conspicuous to their enemies; but whether their dull\r\ntints have been specially gained for the sake of protection seems, as\r\nfar as I can judge, rather doubtful. It is still more doubtful whether\r\nsuch dull tints can have been gained for the sake of ornament. We must,\r\nhowever, bear in mind that male birds, though dull-coloured, often\r\ndiffer much from their females (as with the common sparrow), and this\r\nleads to the belief that such colours have been gained through sexual\r\nselection, from being attractive. Many of the soft-billed birds are\r\nsongsters; and a discussion in a former chapter should not be\r\nforgotten, in which it was shewn that the best songsters are rarely\r\nornamented with bright tints. It would appear that female birds, as a\r\ngeneral rule, have selected their mates either for their sweet voices\r\nor gay colours, but not for both charms combined. Some species, which\r\nare manifestly coloured for the sake of protection, such as the\r\njack-snipe, woodcock, and night-jar, are likewise marked and shaded,\r\naccording to our standard of taste, with extreme elegance. In such\r\ncases we may conclude that both natural and sexual selection have acted\r\nconjointly for protection and ornament. Whether any bird exists which\r\ndoes not possess some special attraction, by which to charm the\r\nopposite sex, may be doubted. When both sexes are so obscurely coloured\r\nthat it would be rash to assume the agency of sexual selection, and\r\nwhen no direct evidence can be advanced shewing that such colours serve\r\nas a protection, it is best to own complete ignorance of the cause, or,\r\nwhich comes to nearly the same thing, to attribute the result to the\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes of many birds are conspicuously, though not brilliantly\r\ncoloured, such as the numerous black, white, or piebald species; and\r\nthese colours are probably the result of sexual selection. With the\r\ncommon blackbird, capercailzie, blackcock, black scoter-duck (Oidemia),\r\nand even with one of the birds of paradise (Lophorina atra), the males\r\nalone are black, whilst the females are brown or mottled; and there can\r\nhardly be a doubt that blackness in these cases has been a sexually\r\nselected character. Therefore it is in some degree probable that the\r\ncomplete or partial blackness of both sexes in such birds as crows,\r\ncertain cockatoos, storks, and swans, and many marine birds, is\r\nlikewise the result of sexual selection, accompanied by equal\r\ntransmission to both sexes; for blackness can hardly serve in any case\r\nas a protection. With several birds, in which the male alone is black,\r\nand in others in which both sexes are black, the beak or skin about the\r\nhead is brightly coloured, and the contrast thus afforded adds much to\r\ntheir beauty; we see this in the bright yellow beak of the male\r\nblackbird, in the crimson skin over the eyes of the blackcock and\r\ncapercailzie, in the brightly and variously coloured beak of the\r\nscoter-drake (Oidemia), in the red beak of the chough (Corvus graculus,\r\nLinn.), of the black swan, and the black stork. This leads me to remark\r\nthat it is not incredible that toucans may owe the enormous size of\r\ntheir beaks to sexual selection, for the sake of displaying the\r\ndiversified and vivid stripes of colour, with which these organs are\r\nornamented. (51. No satisfactory explanation has ever been offered of\r\nthe immense size, and still less of the bright colours, of the toucan’s\r\nbeak. Mr. Bates (‘The Naturalist on the Amazons,’ vol. ii. 1863, p.\r\n341) states that they use their beaks for reaching fruit at the extreme\r\ntips of the branches; and likewise, as stated by other authors, for\r\nextracting eggs and young birds from the nests of other birds. But, as\r\nMr. Bates admits, the beak “can scarcely be considered a very\r\nperfectly-formed instrument for the end to which it is applied.” The\r\ngreat bulk of the beak, as shewn by its breadth, depth, as well as\r\nlength, is not intelligible on the view, that it serves merely as an\r\norgan of prehension. Mr. Belt believes (‘The Naturalist in Nicaragua,’\r\np. 197) that the principal use of the beak is as a defence against\r\nenemies, especially to the female whilst nesting in a hole in a tree.)\r\nThe naked skin, also, at the base of the beak and round the eyes is\r\nlikewise often brilliantly coloured; and Mr. Gould, in speaking of one\r\nspecies (52. Rhamphastos carinatus, Gould’s ‘Monograph of\r\nRamphastidae.’), says that the colours of the beak “are doubtless in\r\nthe finest and most brilliant state during the time of pairing.” There\r\nis no greater improbability that toucans should be encumbered with\r\nimmense beaks, though rendered as light as possible by their\r\ncancellated structure, for the display of fine colours (an object\r\nfalsely appearing to us unimportant), than that the male Argus pheasant\r\nand some other birds should be encumbered with plumes so long as to\r\nimpede their flight.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, as the males alone of various species are black,\r\nthe females being dull-coloured; so in a few cases the males alone are\r\neither wholly or partially white, as with the several bell-birds of\r\nSouth America (Chasmorhynchus), the Antarctic goose (Bernicla\r\nantarctica), the silver pheasant, etc., whilst the females are brown or\r\nobscurely mottled. Therefore, on the same principle as before, it is\r\nprobable that both sexes of many birds, such as white cockatoos,\r\nseveral egrets with their beautiful plumes, certain ibises, gulls,\r\nterns, etc., have acquired their more or less completely white plumage\r\nthrough sexual selection. In some of these cases the plumage becomes\r\nwhite only at maturity. This is the case with certain gannets,\r\ntropic-birds, etc., and with the snow-goose (Anser hyperboreus). As the\r\nlatter breeds on the “barren grounds,” when not covered with snow, and\r\nas it migrates southward during the winter, there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that its snow-white adult plumage serves as a protection. In\r\nthe Anastomus oscitans, we have still better evidence that the white\r\nplumage is a nuptial character, for it is developed only during the\r\nsummer; the young in their immature state, and the adults in their\r\nwinter dress, being grey and black. With many kinds of gulls (Larus),\r\nthe head and neck become pure white during the summer, being grey or\r\nmottled during the winter and in the young state. On the other hand,\r\nwith the smaller gulls, or sea-mews (Gavia), and with some terns\r\n(Sterna), exactly the reverse occurs; for the heads of the young birds\r\nduring the first year, and of the adults during the winter, are either\r\npure white, or much paler coloured than during the breeding-season.\r\nThese latter cases offer another instance of the capricious manner in\r\nwhich sexual selection appears often to have acted. (53. On Larus,\r\nGavia, and Sterna, see Macgillivray, ‘History of British Birds,’ vol.\r\nv. pp. 515, 584, 626. On the Anser hyperboreus, Audubon,\r\n‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. iv. p. 562. On the Anastomus, Mr.\r\nBlyth, in ‘Ibis,’ 1867, p. 173.)\r\n\r\nThat aquatic birds have acquired a white plumage so much oftener than\r\nterrestrial birds, probably depends on their large size and strong\r\npowers of flight, so that they can easily defend themselves or escape\r\nfrom birds of prey, to which moreover they are not much exposed.\r\nConsequently, sexual selection has not here been interfered with or\r\nguided for the sake of protection. No doubt with birds which roam over\r\nthe open ocean, the males and females could find each other much more\r\neasily, when made conspicuous either by being perfectly white or\r\nintensely black; so that these colours may possibly serve the same end\r\nas the call-notes of many land-birds. (54. It may be noticed that with\r\nvultures, which roam far and wide high in the air, like marine birds\r\nover the ocean, three or four species are almost wholly or largely\r\nwhite, and that many others are black. So that here again conspicuous\r\ncolours may possibly aid the sexes in finding each other during the\r\nbreeding-season.) A white or black bird when it discovers and flies\r\ndown to a carcase floating on the sea or cast up on the beach, will be\r\nseen from a great distance, and will guide other birds of the same and\r\nother species, to the prey; but as this would be a disadvantage to the\r\nfirst finders, the individuals which were the whitest or blackest would\r\nnot thus procure more food than the less strongly coloured individuals.\r\nHence conspicuous colours cannot have been gradually acquired for this\r\npurpose through natural selection.\r\n\r\nAs sexual selection depends on so fluctuating an element as taste, we\r\ncan understand how it is that, within the same group of birds having\r\nnearly the same habits, there should exist white or nearly white, as\r\nwell as black, or nearly black species,—for instance, both white and\r\nblack cockatoos, storks, ibises, swans, terns, and petrels. Piebald\r\nbirds likewise sometimes occur in the same groups together with black\r\nand white species; for instance, the black-necked swan, certain terns,\r\nand the common magpie. That a strong contrast in colour is agreeable to\r\nbirds, we may conclude by looking through any large collection, for the\r\nsexes often differ from each other in the male having the pale parts of\r\na purer white, and the variously coloured dark parts of still darker\r\ntints than the female.\r\n\r\nIt would even appear that mere novelty, or slight changes for the sake\r\nof change, have sometimes acted on female birds as a charm, like\r\nchanges of fashion with us. Thus the males of some parrots can hardly\r\nbe said to be more beautiful than the females, at least according to\r\nour taste, but they differ in such points, as in having a rose-coloured\r\ncollar instead of “a bright emeraldine narrow green collar”; or in the\r\nmale having a black collar instead of “a yellow demi-collar in front,”\r\nwith a pale roseate instead of a plum-blue head. (55. See Jerdon on the\r\ngenus Palaeornis, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. pp. 258-260.) As so many\r\nmale birds have elongated tail-feathers or elongated crests for their\r\nchief ornament, the shortened tail, formerly described in the male of a\r\nhumming-bird, and the shortened crest of the male goosander, seem like\r\none of the many changes of fashion which we admire in our own dresses.\r\n\r\nSome members of the heron family offer a still more curious case of\r\nnovelty in colouring having, as it appears, been appreciated for the\r\nsake of novelty. The young of the Ardea asha are white, the adults\r\nbeing dark slate-coloured; and not only the young, but the adults in\r\ntheir winter plumage, of the allied Buphus coromandus are white, this\r\ncolour changing into a rich golden-buff during the breeding-season. It\r\nis incredible that the young of these two species, as well as of some\r\nother members of the same family (56. The young of Ardea rufescens and\r\nA. caerulea of the United States are likewise white, the adults being\r\ncoloured in accordance with their specific names. Audubon\r\n(‘Ornithological Biography,’ vol. iii. p. 416; vol. iv. p. 58) seems\r\nrather pleased at the thought that this remarkable change of plumage\r\nwill greatly “disconcert the systematists.”), should for any special\r\npurpose have been rendered pure white and thus made conspicuous to\r\ntheir enemies; or that the adults of one of these two species should\r\nhave been specially rendered white during the winter in a country which\r\nis never covered with snow. On the other hand we have good reason to\r\nbelieve that whiteness has been gained by many birds as a sexual\r\nornament. We may therefore conclude that some early progenitor of the\r\nArdea asha and the Buphus acquired a white plumage for nuptial\r\npurposes, and transmitted this colour to their young; so that the young\r\nand the old became white like certain existing egrets; and that the\r\nwhiteness was afterwards retained by the young, whilst it was exchanged\r\nby the adults for more strongly-pronounced tints. But if we could look\r\nstill further back to the still earlier progenitors of these two\r\nspecies, we should probably see the adults dark-coloured. I infer that\r\nthis would be the case, from the analogy of many other birds, which are\r\ndark whilst young, and when adult are white; and more especially from\r\nthe case of the Ardea gularis, the colours of which are the reverse of\r\nthose of A. asha, for the young are dark-coloured and the adults white,\r\nthe young having retained a former state of plumage. It appears\r\ntherefore that, during a long line of descent, the adult progenitors of\r\nthe Ardea asha, the Buphus, and of some allies, have undergone the\r\nfollowing changes of colour: first, a dark shade; secondly, pure white;\r\nand thirdly, owing to another change of fashion (if I may so express\r\nmyself), their present slaty, reddish, or golden-buff tints. These\r\nsuccessive changes are intelligible only on the principle of novelty\r\nhaving been admired by birds for its own sake.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers have objected to the whole theory of sexual selection,\r\nby assuming that with animals and savages the taste of the female for\r\ncertain colours or other ornaments would not remain constant for many\r\ngenerations; that first one colour and then another would be admired,\r\nand consequently that no permanent effect could be produced. We may\r\nadmit that taste is fluctuating, but it is not quite arbitrary. It\r\ndepends much on habit, as we see in mankind; and we may infer that this\r\nwould hold good with birds and other animals. Even in our own dress,\r\nthe general character lasts long, and the changes are to a certain\r\nextent graduated. Abundant evidence will be given in two places in a\r\nfuture chapter, that savages of many races have admired for many\r\ngenerations the same cicatrices on the skin, the same hideously\r\nperforated lips, nostrils, or ears, distorted heads, etc.; and these\r\ndeformities present some analogy to the natural ornaments of various\r\nanimals. Nevertheless, with savages such fashions do not endure for\r\never, as we may infer from the differences in this respect between\r\nallied tribes on the same continent. So again the raisers of fancy\r\nanimals certainly have admired for many generations and still admire\r\nthe same breeds; they earnestly desire slight changes, which are\r\nconsidered as improvements, but any great or sudden change is looked at\r\nas the greatest blemish. With birds in a state of nature we have no\r\nreason to suppose that they would admire an entirely new style of\r\ncoloration, even if great and sudden variations often occurred, which\r\nis far from being the case. We know that dovecot pigeons do not\r\nwillingly associate with the variously coloured fancy breeds; that\r\nalbino birds do not commonly get partners in marriage; and that the\r\nblack ravens of the Feroe Islands chase away their piebald brethren.\r\nBut this dislike of a sudden change would not preclude their\r\nappreciating slight changes, any more than it does in the case of man.\r\nHence with respect to taste, which depends on many elements, but partly\r\non habit and partly on a love of novelty, there seems no improbability\r\nin animals admiring for a very long period the same general style of\r\nornamentation or other attractions, and yet appreciating slight changes\r\nin colours, form, or sound.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY OF THE FOUR CHAPTERS ON BIRDS.\r\n\r\nMost male birds are highly pugnacious during the breeding-season, and\r\nsome possess weapons adapted for fighting with their rivals. But the\r\nmost pugnacious and the best armed males rarely or never depend for\r\nsuccess solely on their power to drive away or kill their rivals, but\r\nhave special means for charming the female. With some it is the power\r\nof song, or of giving forth strange cries, or instrumental music, and\r\nthe males in consequence differ from the females in their vocal organs,\r\nor in the structure of certain feathers. From the curiously diversified\r\nmeans for producing various sounds, we gain a high idea of the\r\nimportance of this means of courtship. Many birds endeavour to charm\r\nthe females by love-dances or antics, performed on the ground or in the\r\nair, and sometimes at prepared places. But ornaments of many kinds, the\r\nmost brilliant tints, combs and wattles, beautiful plumes, elongated\r\nfeathers, top-knots, and so forth, are by far the commonest means. In\r\nsome cases mere novelty appears to have acted as a charm. The ornaments\r\nof the males must be highly important to them, for they have been\r\nacquired in not a few cases at the cost of increased danger from\r\nenemies, and even at some loss of power in fighting with their rivals.\r\nThe males of very many species do not assume their ornamental dress\r\nuntil they arrive at maturity, or they assume it only during the\r\nbreeding-season, or the tints then become more vivid. Certain\r\nornamental appendages become enlarged, turgid, and brightly coloured\r\nduring the act of courtship. The males display their charms with\r\nelaborate care and to the best effect; and this is done in the presence\r\nof the females. The courtship is sometimes a prolonged affair, and many\r\nmales and females congregate at an appointed place. To suppose that the\r\nfemales do not appreciate the beauty of the males, is to admit that\r\ntheir splendid decorations, all their pomp and display, are useless;\r\nand this is incredible. Birds have fine powers of discrimination, and\r\nin some few instances it can be shewn that they have a taste for the\r\nbeautiful. The females, moreover, are known occasionally to exhibit a\r\nmarked preference or antipathy for certain individual males.\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that the females prefer, or are unconsciously excited\r\nby the more beautiful males, then the males would slowly but surely be\r\nrendered more and more attractive through sexual selection. That it is\r\nthis sex which has been chiefly modified, we may infer from the fact\r\nthat, in almost every genus where the sexes differ, the males differ\r\nmuch more from one another than do the females; this is well shewn in\r\ncertain closely-allied representative species, in which the females can\r\nhardly be distinguished, whilst the males are quite distinct. Birds in\r\na state of nature offer individual differences which would amply\r\nsuffice for the work of sexual selection; but we have seen that they\r\noccasionally present more strongly marked variations which recur so\r\nfrequently that they would immediately be fixed, if they served to\r\nallure the female. The laws of variation must determine the nature of\r\nthe initial changes, and will have largely influenced the final result.\r\nThe gradations, which may be observed between the males of allied\r\nspecies, indicate the nature of the steps through which they have\r\npassed. They explain also in the most interesting manner how certain\r\ncharacters have originated, such as the indented ocelli on the\r\ntail-feathers of the peacock, and the ball-and-socket ocelli on the\r\nwing-feathers of the Argus pheasant. It is evident that the brilliant\r\ncolours, top-knots, fine plumes, etc., of many male birds cannot have\r\nbeen acquired as a protection; indeed, they sometimes lead to danger.\r\nThat they are not due to the direct and definite action of the\r\nconditions of life, we may feel assured, because the females have been\r\nexposed to the same conditions, and yet often differ from the males to\r\nan extreme degree. Although it is probable that changed conditions\r\nacting during a lengthened period have in some cases produced a\r\ndefinite effect on both sexes, or sometimes on one sex alone, the more\r\nimportant result will have been an increased tendency to vary or to\r\npresent more strongly-marked individual differences; and such\r\ndifferences will have afforded an excellent ground-work for the action\r\nof sexual selection.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance, irrespectively of selection, appear to have\r\ndetermined whether the characters acquired by the males for the sake of\r\nornament, for producing various sounds, and for fighting together, have\r\nbeen transmitted to the males alone or to both sexes, either\r\npermanently, or periodically during certain seasons of the year. Why\r\nvarious characters should have been transmitted sometimes in one way\r\nand sometimes in another, is not in most cases known; but the period of\r\nvariability seems often to have been the determining cause. When the\r\ntwo sexes have inherited all characters in common they necessarily\r\nresemble each other; but as the successive variations may be\r\ndifferently transmitted, every possible gradation may be found, even\r\nwithin the same genus, from the closest similarity to the widest\r\ndissimilarity between the sexes. With many closely-allied species,\r\nfollowing nearly the same habits of life, the males have come to differ\r\nfrom each other chiefly through the action of sexual selection; whilst\r\nthe females have come to differ chiefly from partaking more or less of\r\nthe characters thus acquired by the males. The effects, moreover, of\r\nthe definite action of the conditions of life, will not have been\r\nmasked in the females, as in the males, by the accumulation through\r\nsexual selection of strongly-pronounced colours and other ornaments.\r\nThe individuals of both sexes, however affected, will have been kept at\r\neach successive period nearly uniform by the free intercrossing of many\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nWith species, in which the sexes differ in colour, it is possible or\r\nprobable that some of the successive variations often tended to be\r\ntransmitted equally to both sexes; but that when this occurred the\r\nfemales were prevented from acquiring the bright colours of the males,\r\nby the destruction which they suffered during incubation. There is no\r\nevidence that it is possible by natural selection to convert one form\r\nof transmission into another. But there would not be the least\r\ndifficulty in rendering a female dull-coloured, the male being still\r\nkept bright-coloured, by the selection of successive variations, which\r\nwere from the first limited in their transmission to the same sex.\r\nWhether the females of many species have actually been thus modified,\r\nmust at present remain doubtful. When, through the law of the equal\r\ntransmission of characters to both sexes, the females were rendered as\r\nconspicuously coloured as the males, their instincts appear often to\r\nhave been modified so that they were led to build domed or concealed\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nIn one small and curious class of cases the characters and habits of\r\nthe two sexes have been completely transposed, for the females are\r\nlarger, stronger, more vociferous and brighter coloured than the males.\r\nThey have, also, become so quarrelsome that they often fight together\r\nfor the possession of the males, like the males of other pugnacious\r\nspecies for the possession of the females. If, as seems probable, such\r\nfemales habitually drive away their rivals, and by the display of their\r\nbright colours or other charms endeavour to attract the males, we can\r\nunderstand how it is that they have gradually been rendered, by sexual\r\nselection and sexually-limited transmission, more beautiful than the\r\nmales—the latter being left unmodified or only slightly modified.\r\n\r\nWhenever the law of inheritance at corresponding ages prevails but not\r\nthat of sexually-limited transmission, then if the parents vary late in\r\nlife—and we know that this constantly occurs with our poultry, and\r\noccasionally with other birds—the young will be left unaffected, whilst\r\nthe adults of both sexes will be modified. If both these laws of\r\ninheritance prevail and either sex varies late in life, that sex alone\r\nwill be modified, the other sex and the young being unaffected. When\r\nvariations in brightness or in other conspicuous characters occur early\r\nin life, as no doubt often happens, they will not be acted on through\r\nsexual selection until the period of reproduction arrives; consequently\r\nif dangerous to the young, they will be eliminated through natural\r\nselection. Thus we can understand how it is that variations arising\r\nlate in life have so often been preserved for the ornamentation of the\r\nmales; the females and the young being left almost unaffected, and\r\ntherefore like each other. With species having a distinct summer and\r\nwinter plumage, the males of which either resemble or differ from the\r\nfemales during both seasons or during the summer alone, the degrees and\r\nkinds of resemblance between the young and the old are exceedingly\r\ncomplex; and this complexity apparently depends on characters, first\r\nacquired by the males, being transmitted in various ways and degrees,\r\nas limited by age, sex, and season.\r\n\r\nAs the young of so many species have been but little modified in colour\r\nand in other ornaments, we are enabled to form some judgment with\r\nrespect to the plumage of their early progenitors; and we may infer\r\nthat the beauty of our existing species, if we look to the whole class,\r\nhas been largely increased since that period, of which the immature\r\nplumage gives us an indirect record. Many birds, especially those which\r\nlive much on the ground, have undoubtedly been obscurely coloured for\r\nthe sake of protection. In some instances the upper exposed surface of\r\nthe plumage has been thus coloured in both sexes, whilst the lower\r\nsurface in the males alone has been variously ornamented through sexual\r\nselection. Finally, from the facts given in these four chapters, we may\r\nconclude that weapons for battle, organs for producing sound, ornaments\r\nof many kinds, bright and conspicuous colours, have generally been\r\nacquired by the males through variation and sexual selection, and have\r\nbeen transmitted in various ways according to the several laws of\r\ninheritance—the females and the young being left comparatively but\r\nlittle modified. (57. I am greatly indebted to the kindness of Mr.\r\nSclater for having looked over these four chapters on birds, and the\r\ntwo following ones on mammals. In this way I have been saved from\r\nmaking mistakes about the names of the species, and from stating\r\nanything as a fact which is known to this distinguished naturalist to\r\nbe erroneous. But, of course, he is not at all answerable for the\r\naccuracy of the statements quoted by me from various authorities.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAMMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law of battle—Special weapons, confined to the males—Cause of\r\nabsence of weapons in the female—Weapons common to both sexes, yet\r\nprimarily acquired by the male—Other uses of such weapons—Their high\r\nimportance—Greater size of the male—Means of defence—On the preference\r\nshown by either sex in the pairing of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nWith mammals the male appears to win the female much more through the\r\nlaw of battle than through the display of his charms. The most timid\r\nanimals, not provided with any special weapons for fighting, engage in\r\ndesperate conflicts during the season of love. Two male hares have been\r\nseen to fight together until one was killed; male moles often fight,\r\nand sometimes with fatal results; male squirrels engage in frequent\r\ncontests, “and often wound each other severely”; as do male beavers, so\r\nthat “hardly a skin is without scars.” (1. See Waterton’s account of\r\ntwo hares fighting, ‘Zoologist,’ vol. i. 1843, p. 211. On moles, Bell,\r\n‘Hist. of British Quadrupeds,’ 1st ed., p. 100. On squirrels, Audubon\r\nand Bachman, Viviparous Quadrupeds of N. America, 1846, p. 269. On\r\nbeavers, Mr. A.H. Green, in ‘Journal of Linnean Society, Zoology,’ vol.\r\nx. 1869, p. 362.) I observed the same fact with the hides of the\r\nguanacoes in Patagonia; and on one occasion several were so absorbed in\r\nfighting that they fearlessly rushed close by me. Livingstone speaks of\r\nthe males of the many animals in Southern Africa as almost invariably\r\nshewing the scars received in former contests.\r\n\r\nThe law of battle prevails with aquatic as with terrestrial mammals. It\r\nis notorious how desperately male seals fight, both with their teeth\r\nand claws, during the breeding-season; and their hides are likewise\r\noften covered with scars. Male sperm-whales are very jealous at this\r\nseason; and in their battles “they often lock their jaws together, and\r\nturn on their sides and twist about”; so that their lower jaws often\r\nbecome distorted. (2. On the battles of seals, see Capt. C. Abbott in\r\n‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1868, p. 191; Mr. R. Brown, ibid. 1868, p. 436; also\r\nL. Lloyd, ‘Game Birds of Sweden,’ 1867, p. 412; also Pennant. On the\r\nsperm-whale see Mr. J.H. Thompson, in ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1867, p. 246.)\r\n\r\nAll male animals which are furnished with special weapons for fighting,\r\nare well known to engage in fierce battles. The courage and the\r\ndesperate conflicts of stags have often been described; their skeletons\r\nhave been found in various parts of the world, with the horns\r\ninextricably locked together, shewing how miserably the victor and\r\nvanquished had perished. (3. See Scrope (‘Art of Deer-stalking,’ p. 17)\r\non the locking of the horns with the Cervus elaphus. Richardson, in\r\n‘Fauna Bor. Americana,’ 1829, p. 252, says that the wapiti, moose, and\r\nreindeer have been found thus locked together. Sir A. Smith found at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope the skeletons of two gnus in the same condition.)\r\nNo animal in the world is so dangerous as an elephant in must. Lord\r\nTankerville has given me a graphic description of the battles between\r\nthe wild bulls in Chillingham Park, the descendants, degenerated in\r\nsize but not in courage, of the gigantic Bos primigenius. In 1861\r\nseveral contended for mastery; and it was observed that two of the\r\nyounger bulls attacked in concert the old leader of the herd, overthrew\r\nand disabled him, so that he was believed by the keepers to be lying\r\nmortally wounded in a neighbouring wood. But a few days afterwards one\r\nof the young bulls approached the wood alone; and then the “monarch of\r\nthe chase,” who had been lashing himself up for vengeance, came out\r\nand, in a short time, killed his antagonist. He then quietly joined the\r\nherd, and long held undisputed sway. Admiral Sir B.J. Sulivan informs\r\nme that, when he lived in the Falkland Islands, he imported a young\r\nEnglish stallion, which frequented the hills near Port William with\r\neight mares. On these hills there were two wild stallions, each with a\r\nsmall troop of mares; “and it is certain that these stallions would\r\nnever have approached each other without fighting. Both had tried\r\nsingly to fight the English horse and drive away his mares, but had\r\nfailed. One day they came in TOGETHER and attacked him. This was seen\r\nby the capitan who had charge of the horses, and who, on riding to the\r\nspot, found one of the two stallions engaged with the English horse,\r\nwhilst the other was driving away the mares, and had already separated\r\nfour from the rest. The capitan settled the matter by driving the whole\r\nparty into the corral, for the wild stallions would not leave the\r\nmares.”\r\n\r\nMale animals which are provided with efficient cutting or tearing teeth\r\nfor the ordinary purposes of life, such as the carnivora, insectivora,\r\nand rodents, are seldom furnished with weapons especially adapted for\r\nfighting with their rivals. The case is very different with the males\r\nof many other animals. We see this in the horns of stags and of certain\r\nkinds of antelopes in which the females are hornless. With many animals\r\nthe canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw, or in both, are much larger\r\nin the males than in the females, or are absent in the latter, with the\r\nexception sometimes of a hidden rudiment. Certain antelopes, the\r\nmusk-deer, camel, horse, boar, various apes, seals, and the walrus,\r\noffer instances. In the females of the walrus the tusks are sometimes\r\nquite absent. (4. Mr. Lamont (‘Seasons with the Sea-Horses,’ 1861, p.\r\n143) says that a good tusk of the male walrus weighs 4 pounds, and is\r\nlonger than that of the female, which weighs about 3 pounds. The males\r\nare described as fighting ferociously. On the occasional absence of the\r\ntusks in the female, see Mr. R. Brown, ‘Proceedings, Zoological\r\nSociety,’ 1868, p. 429.) In the male elephant of India and in the male\r\ndugong (5. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 283.) the upper\r\nincisors form offensive weapons. In the male narwhal the left canine\r\nalone is developed into the well-known, spirally-twisted, so-called\r\nhorn, which is sometimes from nine to ten feet in length. It is\r\nbelieved that the males use these horns for fighting together; for “an\r\nunbroken one can rarely be got, and occasionally one may be found with\r\nthe point of another jammed into the broken place.” (6. Mr. R. Brown,\r\nin ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1869, p. 553. See Prof. Turner, in ‘Journal of\r\nAnat. and Phys.’ 1872, p. 76, on the homological nature of these tusks.\r\nAlso Mr. J.W. Clarke on two tusks being developed in the males, in\r\n‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1871, p. 42.) The tooth on the\r\nopposite side of the head in the male consists of a rudiment about ten\r\ninches in length, which is embedded in the jaw; but sometimes, though\r\nrarely, both are equally developed on the two sides. In the female both\r\nare always rudimentary. The male cachalot has a larger head than that\r\nof the female, and it no doubt aids him in his aquatic battles. Lastly,\r\nthe adult male ornithorhynchus is provided with a remarkable apparatus,\r\nnamely a spur on the foreleg, closely resembling the poison-fang of a\r\nvenomous snake; but according to Harting, the secretion from the gland\r\nis not poisonous; and on the leg of the female there is a hollow,\r\napparently for the reception of the spur. (7. Owen on the cachalot and\r\nOrnithorhynchus, ibid. vol. iii. pp. 638, 641. Harting is quoted by Dr.\r\nZouteveen in the Dutch translation of this work, vol. ii. p. 292.)\r\n\r\nWhen the males are provided with weapons which in the females are\r\nabsent, there can be hardly a doubt that these serve for fighting with\r\nother males; and that they were acquired through sexual selection, and\r\nwere transmitted to the male sex alone. It is not probable, at least in\r\nmost cases, that the females have been prevented from acquiring such\r\nweapons, on account of their being useless, superfluous, or in some way\r\ninjurious. On the contrary, as they are often used by the males for\r\nvarious purposes, more especially as a defence against their enemies,\r\nit is a surprising fact that they are so poorly developed, or quite\r\nabsent, in the females of so many animals. With female deer the\r\ndevelopment during each recurrent season of great branching horns, and\r\nwith female elephants the development of immense tusks, would be a\r\ngreat waste of vital power, supposing that they were of no use to the\r\nfemales. Consequently, they would have tended to be eliminated in the\r\nfemale through natural selection; that is, if the successive variations\r\nwere limited in their transmission to the female sex, for otherwise the\r\nweapons of the males would have been injuriously affected, and this\r\nwould have been a greater evil. On the whole, and from the\r\nconsideration of the following facts, it seems probable that when the\r\nvarious weapons differ in the two sexes, this has generally depended on\r\nthe kind of transmission which has prevailed.\r\n\r\nAs the reindeer is the one species in the whole family of Deer, in\r\nwhich the female is furnished with horns, though they are somewhat\r\nsmaller, thinner, and less branched than in the male, it might\r\nnaturally be thought that, at least in this case, they must be of some\r\nspecial service to her. The female retains her horns from the time when\r\nthey are fully developed, namely, in September, throughout the winter\r\nuntil April or May, when she brings forth her young. Mr. Crotch made\r\nparticular enquiries for me in Norway, and it appears that the females\r\nat this season conceal themselves for about a fortnight in order to\r\nbring forth their young, and then reappear, generally hornless. In Nova\r\nScotia, however, as I hear from Mr. H. Reeks, the female sometimes\r\nretains her horns longer. The male on the other hand casts his horns\r\nmuch earlier, towards the end of November. As both sexes have the same\r\nrequirements and follow the same habits of life, and as the male is\r\ndestitute of horns during the winter, it is improbable that they can be\r\nof any special service to the female during this season, which includes\r\nthe larger part of the time during which she is horned. Nor is it\r\nprobable that she can have inherited horns from some ancient progenitor\r\nof the family of deer, for, from the fact of the females of so many\r\nspecies in all quarters of the globe not having horns, we may conclude\r\nthat this was the primordial character of the group. (8. On the\r\nstructure and shedding of the horns of the reindeer, Hoffberg,\r\n‘Amoenitates Acad.’ vol. iv. 1788, p. 149. See Richardson, ‘Fauna Bor.\r\nAmericana,’ p. 241, in regard to the American variety or species: also\r\nMajor W. Ross King, ‘The Sportsman in Canada,’ 1866, p. 80.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the reindeer are developed at a most unusually early age;\r\nbut what the cause of this may be is not known. The effect has\r\napparently been the transference of the horns to both sexes. We should\r\nbear in mind that horns are always transmitted through the female, and\r\nthat she has a latent capacity for their development, as we see in old\r\nor diseased females. (9. Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, ‘Essais de\r\nZoolog. Générale,’ 1841, p. 513. Other masculine characters, besides\r\nthe horns, are sometimes similarly transferred to the female; thus Mr.\r\nBoner, in speaking of an old female chamois (‘Chamois Hunting in the\r\nMountains of Bavaria,’ 1860, 2nd ed., p. 363), says, “not only was the\r\nhead very male-looking, but along the back there was a ridge of long\r\nhair, usually to be found only in bucks.”) Moreover the females of some\r\nother species of deer exhibit, either normally or occasionally,\r\nrudiments of horns; thus the female of Cervulus moschatus has “bristly\r\ntufts, ending in a knob, instead of a horn”; and “in most specimens of\r\nthe female wapiti (Cervus canadensis) there is a sharp bony\r\nprotuberance in the place of the horn.” (10. On the Cervulus, Dr. Gray,\r\n‘Catalogue of Mammalia in the British Museum,’ part iii. p. 220. On the\r\nCervus canadensis or wapiti, see Hon. J.D. Caton, ‘Ottawa Academy of\r\nNat. Sciences,’ May 1868, p. 9.) From these several considerations we\r\nmay conclude that the possession of fairly well-developed horns by the\r\nfemale reindeer, is due to the males having first acquired them as\r\nweapons for fighting with other males; and secondarily to their\r\ndevelopment from some unknown cause at an unusually early age in the\r\nmales, and their consequent transference to both sexes.\r\n\r\nTurning to the sheath-horned ruminants: with antelopes a graduated\r\nseries can be formed, beginning with species, the females of which are\r\ncompletely destitute of horns—passing on to those which have horns so\r\nsmall as to be almost rudimentary (as with the Antilocapra americana,\r\nin which species they are present in only one out of four or five\r\nfemales (11. I am indebted to Dr. Canfield for this information; see\r\nalso his paper in the ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’ 1866, p.\r\n105.))—to those which have fairly developed horns, but manifestly\r\nsmaller and thinner than in the male and sometimes of a different shape\r\n(12. For instance the horns of the female Ant. euchore resemble those\r\nof a distinct species, viz. the Ant. dorcas var. Corine, see Desmarest,\r\n‘Mammalogie,’ p. 455.),—and ending with those in which both sexes have\r\nhorns of equal size. As with the reindeer, so with antelopes, there\r\nexists, as previously shewn, a relation between the period of the\r\ndevelopment of the horns and their transmission to one or both sexes;\r\nit is therefore probable that their presence or absence in the females\r\nof some species, and their more or less perfect condition in the\r\nfemales of other species, depends, not on their being of any special\r\nuse, but simply on inheritance. It accords with this view that even in\r\nthe same restricted genus both sexes of some species, and the males\r\nalone of others, are thus provided. It is also a remarkable fact that,\r\nalthough the females of Antilope bezoartica are normally destitute of\r\nhorns, Mr. Blyth has seen no less than three females thus furnished;\r\nand there was no reason to suppose that they were old or diseased.\r\n\r\nIn all the wild species of goats and sheep the horns are larger in the\r\nmale than in the female, and are sometimes quite absent in the latter.\r\n(13. Gray, ‘Catalogue of Mammalia, the British Museum,’ part iii. 1852,\r\np. 160.) In several domestic breeds of these two animals, the males\r\nalone are furnished with horns; and in some breeds, for instance, in\r\nthe sheep of North Wales, though both sexes are properly horned, the\r\newes are very liable to be hornless. I have been informed by a\r\ntrustworthy witness, who purposely inspected a flock of these same\r\nsheep during the lambing season, that the horns at birth are generally\r\nmore fully developed in the male than in the female. Mr. J. Peel\r\ncrossed his Lonk sheep, both sexes of which always bear horns, with\r\nhornless Leicesters and hornless Shropshire Downs; and the result was\r\nthat the male offspring had their horns considerably reduced, whilst\r\nthe females were wholly destitute of them. These several facts indicate\r\nthat, with sheep, the horns are a much less firmly fixed character in\r\nthe females than in the males; and this leads us to look at the horns\r\nas properly of masculine origin.\r\n\r\nWith the adult musk-ox (Ovibos moschatus) the horns of the male are\r\nlarger than those of the female, and in the latter the bases do not\r\ntouch. (14. Richardson, ‘Fauna Bor. Americana,’ p. 278.) In regard to\r\nordinary cattle Mr. Blyth remarks: “In most of the wild bovine animals\r\nthe horns are both longer and thicker in the bull than in the cow, and\r\nin the cow-banteng (Bos sondaicus) the horns are remarkably small, and\r\ninclined much backwards. In the domestic races of cattle, both of the\r\nhumped and humpless types, the horns are short and thick in the bull,\r\nlonger and more slender in the cow and ox; and in the Indian buffalo,\r\nthey are shorter and thicker in the bull, longer and more slender in\r\nthe cow. In the wild gaour (B. gaurus) the horns are mostly both longer\r\nand thicker in the bull than in the cow.” (15. ‘Land and Water,’ 1867,\r\np. 346.) Dr. Forsyth Major also informs me that a fossil skull,\r\nbelieved to be that of the female Bos etruscus, has been found in Val\r\nd’Arno, which is wholly without horns. In the Rhinoceros simus, as I\r\nmay add, the horns of the female are generally longer but less powerful\r\nthan in the male; and in some other species of rhinoceros they are said\r\nto be shorter in the female. (16. Sir Andrew Smith, ‘Zoology of S.\r\nAfrica,’ pl. xix. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 624.)\r\nFrom these various facts we may infer as probable that horns of all\r\nkinds, even when they are equally developed in the two sexes, were\r\nprimarily acquired by the male in order to conquer other males, and\r\nhave been transferred more or less completely to the female.\r\n\r\nThe effects of castration deserve notice, as throwing light on this\r\nsame point. Stags after the operation never renew their horns. The male\r\nreindeer, however, must be excepted, as after castration he does renew\r\nthem. This fact, as well as the possession of horns by both sexes,\r\nseems at first to prove that the horns in this species do not\r\nconstitute a sexual character (17. This is the conclusion of Seidlitz,\r\n‘Die Darwinsche Theorie,’ 1871, p. 47.); but as they are developed at a\r\nvery early age, before the sexes differ in constitution, it is not\r\nsurprising that they should be unaffected by castration, even if they\r\nwere aboriginally acquired by the male. With sheep both sexes properly\r\nbear horns; and I am informed that with Welch sheep the horns of the\r\nmales are considerably reduced by castration; but the degree depends\r\nmuch on the age at which the operation is performed, as is likewise the\r\ncase with other animals. Merino rams have large horns, whilst the ewes\r\n“generally speaking are without horns”; and in this breed castration\r\nseems to produce a somewhat greater effect, so that if performed at an\r\nearly age the horns “remain almost undeveloped.” (18. I am much obliged\r\nto Prof. Victor Carus, for having made enquiries for me in Saxony on\r\nthis subject. H. von Nathusius (‘Viehzucht,’ 1872, p. 64) says that the\r\nhorns of sheep castrated at an early period, either altogether\r\ndisappear or remain as mere rudiments; but I do not know whether he\r\nrefers to merinos or to ordinary breeds.) On the Guinea coast there is\r\na breed in which the females never bear horns, and, as Mr. Winwood\r\nReade informs me, the rams after castration are quite destitute of\r\nthem. With cattle, the horns of the males are much altered by\r\ncastration; for instead of being short and thick, they become longer\r\nthan those of the cow, but otherwise resemble them. The Antilope\r\nbezoartica offers a somewhat analogous case: the males have long\r\nstraight spiral horns, nearly parallel to each other, and directed\r\nbackwards; the females occasionally bear horns, but these when present\r\nare of a very different shape, for they are not spiral, and spreading\r\nwidely, bend round with the points forwards. Now it\r\n\r\nis a remarkable fact that, in the castrated male, as Mr. Blyth informs\r\nme, the horns are of the same peculiar shape as in the female, but\r\nlonger and thicker. If we may judge from analogy, the female probably\r\nshews us, in these two cases of cattle and the antelope, the former\r\ncondition of the horns in some early progenitor of each species. But\r\nwhy castration should lead to the reappearance of an early condition of\r\nthe horns cannot be explained with any certainty. Nevertheless, it\r\nseems probable, that in nearly the same manner as the constitutional\r\ndisturbance in the offspring, caused by a cross between two distinct\r\nspecies or races, often leads to the reappearance of long-lost\r\ncharacters (19. I have given various experiments and other evidence\r\nproving that this is the case, in my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants\r\nunder Domestication,’ vol. ii. 1868, pp. 39-47.); so here, the\r\ndisturbance in the constitution of the individual, resulting from\r\ncastration, produces the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe tusks of the elephant, in the different species or races, differ\r\naccording to sex, nearly as do the horns of ruminants. In India and\r\nMalacca the males alone are provided with well-developed tusks. The\r\nelephant of Ceylon is considered by most naturalists as a distinct\r\nrace, but by some as a distinct species, and here “not one in a hundred\r\nis found with tusks, the few that possess them being exclusively\r\nmales.” (20. Sir J. Emerson Tennent, ‘Ceylon,’ 1859, vol. ii. p. 274.\r\nFor Malacca, ‘Journal of Indian Archipelago,’ vol. iv. p. 357.) The\r\nAfrican elephant is undoubtedly distinct, and the female has large\r\nwell-developed tusks, though not so large as those of the male.\r\n\r\nThese differences in the tusks of the several races and species of\r\nelephants—the great variability of the horns of deer, as notably in the\r\nwild reindeer—the occasional presence of horns in the female Antilope\r\nBezoartica, and their frequent absence in the female of Antilocapra\r\namericana—the presence of two tusks in some few male narwhals—the\r\ncomplete absence of tusks in some female walruses—are all instances of\r\nthe extreme variability of secondary sexual characters, and of their\r\nliability to differ in closely-allied forms.\r\n\r\nAlthough tusks and horns appear in all cases to have been primarily\r\ndeveloped as sexual weapons, they often serve other purposes. The\r\nelephant uses his tusks in attacking the tiger; according to Bruce, he\r\nscores the trunks of trees until they can be thrown down easily, and he\r\nlikewise thus extracts the farinaceous cores of palms; in Africa he\r\noften uses one tusk, always the same, to probe the ground and thus\r\nascertain whether it will bear his weight. The common bull defends the\r\nherd with his horns; and the elk in Sweden has been known, according to\r\nLloyd, to strike a wolf dead with a single blow of his great horns.\r\nMany similar facts could be given. One of the most curious secondary\r\nuses to which the horns of an animal may be occasionally put is that\r\nobserved by Captain Hutton (21. ‘Calcutta Journal of Natural History,’\r\nvol. ii, 1843, p. 526.) with the wild goat (Capra aegagrus) of the\r\nHimalayas and, as it is also said with the ibex, namely that when the\r\nmale accidentally falls from a height he bends inwards his head, and by\r\nalighting on his massive horns, breaks the shock. The female cannot\r\nthus use her horns, which are smaller, but from her more quiet\r\ndisposition she does not need this strange kind of shield so much.\r\n\r\nEach male animal uses his weapons in his own peculiar fashion. The\r\ncommon ram makes a charge and butts with such force with the bases of\r\nhis horns, that I have seen a powerful man knocked over like a child.\r\nGoats and certain species of sheep, for instance the Ovis cycloceros of\r\nAfghanistan (22. Mr. Blyth, in ‘Land and Water,’ March, 1867, p. 134,\r\non the authority of Capt. Hutton and others. For the wild Pembrokeshire\r\ngoats, see the ‘Field,’ 1869, p. 150.), rear on their hind legs, and\r\nthen not only butt, but “make a cut down and a jerk up, with the ribbed\r\nfront of their scimitar-shaped horn, as with a sabre. When the O.\r\ncycloceros attacked a large domestic ram, who was a noted bruiser, he\r\nconquered him by the sheer novelty of his mode of fighting, always\r\nclosing at once with his adversary, and catching him across the face\r\nand nose with a sharp drawing jerk of the head, and then bounding out\r\nof the way before the blow could be returned.” In Pembrokeshire a male\r\ngoat, the master of a flock which during several generations had run\r\nwild, was known to have killed several males in single combat; this\r\ngoat possessed enormous horns, measuring thirty-nine inches in a\r\nstraight line from tip to tip. The common bull, as every one knows,\r\ngores and tosses his opponent; but the Italian buffalo is said never to\r\nuse his horns: he gives a tremendous blow with his convex forehead, and\r\nthen tramples on his fallen enemy with his knees—an instinct which the\r\ncommon bull does not possess. (23. M. E.M. Bailly, “Sur l’usage des\r\ncornes,” etc., .Annal des Sciences Nat.’ tom. ii. 1824, p. 369.) Hence\r\na dog who pins a buffalo by the nose is immediately crushed. We must,\r\nhowever, remember that the Italian buffalo has been long domesticated,\r\nand it is by no means certain that the wild parent-form had similar\r\nhorns. Mr. Bartlett informs me that when a female Cape buffalo (Bubalus\r\ncaffer) was turned into an enclosure with a bull of the same species,\r\nshe attacked him, and he in return pushed her about with great\r\nviolence. But it was manifest to Mr. Bartlett that, had not the bull\r\nshewn dignified forbearance, he could easily have killed her by a\r\nsingle lateral thrust with his immense horns. The giraffe uses his\r\nshort, hair-covered horns, which are rather longer in the male than in\r\nthe female, in a curious manner; for, with his long neck, he swings his\r\nhead to either side, almost upside down, with such force that I have\r\nseen a hard plank deeply indented by a single blow.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 63. Oryx leucoryx, male (from the Knowsley Menagerie).]\r\n\r\nWith antelopes it is sometimes difficult to imagine how they can\r\npossibly use their curiously-shaped horns; thus the springboc (Ant.\r\neuchore) has rather short upright horns, with the sharp points bent\r\ninwards almost at right angles, so as to face each other; Mr. Bartlett\r\ndoes not know how they are used, but suggests that they would inflict a\r\nfearful wound down each side of the face of an antagonist. The\r\nslightly-curved horns of the Oryx leucoryx (Fig. 63) are directed\r\nbackwards, and are of such length that their points reach beyond the\r\nmiddle of the back, over which they extend in almost parallel lines.\r\nThus they seem singularly ill-fitted for fighting; but Mr. Bartlett\r\ninforms me that when two of these animals prepare for battle, they\r\nkneel down, with their heads between their fore legs, and in this\r\nattitude the horns stand nearly parallel and close to the ground, with\r\nthe points directed forwards and a little upwards. The combatants then\r\ngradually approach each other, and each endeavours to get the upturned\r\npoints under the body of the other; if one succeeds in doing this, he\r\nsuddenly springs up, throwing up his head at the same time, and can\r\nthus wound or perhaps even transfix his antagonist. Both animals always\r\nkneel down, so as to guard as far as possible against this manoeuvre.\r\nIt has been recorded that one of these antelopes has used his horn with\r\neffect even against a lion; yet from being forced to place his head\r\nbetween the forelegs in order to bring the points of the horns forward,\r\nhe would generally be under a great disadvantage when attacked by any\r\nother animal. It is, therefore, not probable that the horns have been\r\nmodified into their present great length and peculiar position, as a\r\nprotection against beasts of prey. We can however see that, as soon as\r\nsome ancient male progenitor of the Oryx acquired moderately long\r\nhorns, directed a little backwards, he would be compelled, in his\r\nbattles with rival males, to bend his head somewhat inwards or\r\ndownwards, as is now done by certain stags; and it is not improbable\r\nthat he might have acquired the habit of at first occasionally and\r\nafterwards of regularly kneeling down. In this case it is almost\r\ncertain that the males which possessed the longest horns would have had\r\na great advantage over others with shorter horns; and then the horns\r\nwould gradually have been rendered longer and longer, through sexual\r\nselection, until they acquired their present extraordinary length and\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWith stags of many kinds the branches of the horns offer a curious case\r\nof difficulty; for certainly a single straight point would inflict a\r\nmuch more serious wound than several diverging ones. In Sir Philip\r\nEgerton’s museum there is a horn of the red-deer (Cervus elaphus),\r\nthirty inches in length, with “not fewer than fifteen snags or\r\nbranches”; and at Moritzburg there is still preserved a pair of antlers\r\nof a red-deer, shot in 1699 by Frederick I., one of which bears the\r\nastonishing number of thirty-three branches and the other twenty-seven,\r\nmaking altogether sixty branches. Richardson figures a pair of antlers\r\nof the wild reindeer with twenty-nine points. (24. On the horns of\r\nred-deer, Owen, ‘British Fossil Mammals,’ 1846, p. 478; Richardson on\r\nthe horns of the reindeer, ‘Fauna Bor. Americana,’ 1829, p. 240. I am\r\nindebted to Prof. Victor Carus, for the Moritzburg case.) From the\r\nmanner in which the horns are branched, and more especially from deer\r\nbeing known occasionally to fight together by kicking with their\r\nfore-feet (25. Hon. J.D. Caton (‘Ottawa Acad. of Nat. Science,’ May\r\n1868, p. 9) says that the American deer fight with their fore-feet,\r\nafter “the question of superiority has been once settled and\r\nacknowledged in the herd.” Bailly, ‘Sur l’Usage des cornes,’ ‘Annales\r\ndes Sciences Nat.’ tom. ii. 1824, p. 371.), M. Bailly actually comes to\r\nthe conclusion that their horns are more injurious than useful to them.\r\nBut this author overlooks the pitched battles between rival males. As I\r\nfelt much perplexed about the use or advantage of the branches, I\r\napplied to Mr. McNeill of Colonsay, who has long and carefully observed\r\nthe habits of red-deer, and he informs me that he has never seen some\r\nof the branches brought into use, but that the brow antlers, from\r\ninclining downwards, are a great protection to the forehead, and their\r\npoints are likewise used in attack. Sir Philip Egerton also informs me\r\nboth as to red-deer and fallow-deer that, in fighting, they suddenly\r\ndash together, and getting their horns fixed against each other’s\r\nbodies, a desperate struggle ensues. When one is at last forced to\r\nyield and turn round, the victor endeavours to plunge his brow antlers\r\ninto his defeated foe. It thus appears that the upper branches are used\r\nchiefly or exclusively for pushing and fencing. Nevertheless in some\r\nspecies the upper branches are used as weapons of offence; when a man\r\nwas attacked by a wapiti deer (Cervus canadensis) in Judge Caton’s park\r\nin Ottawa, and several men tried to rescue him, the stag “never raised\r\nhis head from the ground; in fact he kept his face almost flat on the\r\nground, with his nose nearly between his fore feet, except when he\r\nrolled his head to one side to take a new observation preparatory to a\r\nplunge.” In this position the ends of the horns were directed against\r\nhis adversaries. “In rolling his head he necessarily raised it\r\nsomewhat, because his antlers were so long that he could not roll his\r\nhead without raising them on one side, while, on the other side they\r\ntouched the ground.” The stag by this procedure gradually drove the\r\nparty of rescuers backwards to a distance of 150 or 200 feet; and the\r\nattacked man was killed. (26. See a most interesting account in the\r\nAppendix to Hon. J.D. Caton’s paper, as above quoted.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 64. Strepsiceros Kudu (from Sir Andrew Smith’s ‘Zoology of South\r\nAfrica.’]\r\n\r\nAlthough the horns of stags are efficient weapons, there can, I think,\r\nbe no doubt that a single point would have been much more dangerous\r\nthan a branched antler; and Judge Caton, who has had large experience\r\nwith deer, fully concurs in this conclusion. Nor do the branching\r\nhorns, though highly important as a means of defence against rival\r\nstags, appear perfectly well adapted for this purpose, as they are\r\nliable to become interlocked. The suspicion has therefore crossed my\r\nmind that they may serve in part as ornaments. That the branched\r\nantlers of stags as well as the elegant lyrated horns of certain\r\nantelopes, with their graceful double curvature (Fig. 64), are\r\nornamental in our eyes, no one will dispute. If, then, the horns, like\r\nthe splendid accoutrements of the knights of old, add to the noble\r\nappearance of stags and antelopes, they may have been modified partly\r\nfor this purpose, though mainly for actual service in battle; but I\r\nhave no evidence in favour of this belief.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case has lately been published, from which it appears\r\nthat the horns of a deer in one district in the United States are now\r\nbeing modified through sexual and natural selection. A writer in an\r\nexcellent American Journal (27. The ‘American Naturalist,’ Dec. 1869,\r\np. 552.) says, that he has hunted for the last twenty-one years in the\r\nAdirondacks, where the Cervus virginianus abounds. About fourteen years\r\nago he first heard of SPIKE-HORN BUCKS. These became from year to year\r\nmore common; about five years ago he shot one, and afterwards another,\r\nand now they are frequently killed. “The spike-horn differs greatly\r\nfrom the common antler of the C. virginianus. It consists of a single\r\nspike, more slender than the antler, and scarcely half so long,\r\nprojecting forward from the brow, and terminating in a very sharp\r\npoint. It gives a considerable advantage to its possessor over the\r\ncommon buck. Besides enabling him to run more swiftly through the thick\r\nwoods and underbrush (every hunter knows that does and yearling bucks\r\nrun much more rapidly than the large bucks when armed with their\r\ncumbrous antlers), the spike-horn is a more effective weapon than the\r\ncommon antler. With this advantage the spike-horn bucks are gaining\r\nupon the common bucks, and may, in time, entirely supersede them in the\r\nAdirondacks. Undoubtedly, the first spike-horn buck was merely an\r\naccidental freak of nature. But his spike-horns gave him an advantage,\r\nand enabled him to propagate his peculiarity. His descendants having a\r\nlike advantage, have propagated the peculiarity in a constantly\r\nincreasing ratio, till they are slowly crowding the antlered deer from\r\nthe region they inhabit.” A critic has well objected to this account by\r\nasking, why, if the simple horns are now so advantageous, were the\r\nbranched antlers of the parent-form ever developed? To this I can only\r\nanswer by remarking, that a new mode of attack with new weapons might\r\nbe a great advantage, as shewn by the case of the Ovis cycloceros, who\r\nthus conquered a domestic ram famous for his fighting power. Though the\r\nbranched antlers of a stag are well adapted for fighting with his\r\nrivals, and though it might be an advantage to the prong-horned variety\r\nslowly to acquire long and branched horns, if he had to fight only with\r\nothers of the same kind, yet it by no means follows that branched horns\r\nwould be the best fitted for conquering a foe differently armed. In the\r\nforegoing case of the Oryx leucoryx, it is almost certain that the\r\nvictory would rest with an antelope having short horns, and who\r\ntherefore did not need to kneel down, though an oryx might profit by\r\nhaving still longer horns, if he fought only with his proper rivals.\r\n\r\nMale quadrupeds, which are furnished with tusks, use them in various\r\nways, as in the case of horns. The boar strikes laterally and upwards;\r\nthe musk-deer downwards with serious effect. (28. Pallas, ‘Spicilegia\r\nZoologica,’ fasc. xiii. 1779, p. 18.) The walrus, though having so\r\nshort a neck and so unwieldy a body, “can strike either upwards, or\r\ndownwards, or sideways, with equal dexterity.” (29. Lamont, ‘Seasons\r\nwith the Sea-Horses,’ 1861, p. 141.) I was informed by the late Dr.\r\nFalconer, that the Indian elephant fights in a different manner\r\naccording to the position and curvature of his tusks. When they are\r\ndirected forwards and upwards he is able to fling a tiger to a great\r\ndistance—it is said to even thirty feet; when they are short and turned\r\ndownwards he endeavours suddenly to pin the tiger to the ground and, in\r\nconsequence, is dangerous to the rider, who is liable to be jerked off\r\nthe howdah. (30. See also Corse (‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1799, p.\r\n212) on the manner in which the short-tusked Mooknah variety attacks\r\nother elephants.)\r\n\r\nVery few male quadrupeds possess weapons of two distinct kinds\r\nspecially adapted for fighting with rival males. The male muntjac-deer\r\n(Cervulus), however, offers an exception, as he is provided with horns\r\nand exserted canine teeth. But we may infer from what follows that one\r\nform of weapon has often been replaced in the course of ages by\r\nanother. With ruminants the development of horns generally stands in an\r\ninverse relation with that of even moderately developed canine teeth.\r\nThus camels, guanacoes, chevrotains, and musk-deer, are hornless, and\r\nthey have efficient canines; these teeth being “always of smaller size\r\nin the females than in the males.” The Camelidae have, in addition to\r\ntheir true canines, a pair of canine-shaped incisors in their upper\r\njaws. (31. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 349.) Male deer\r\nand antelopes, on the other hand, possess horns, and they rarely have\r\ncanine teeth; and these, when present, are always of small size, so\r\nthat it is doubtful whether they are of any service in their battles.\r\nIn Antilope montana they exist only as rudiments in the young male,\r\ndisappearing as he grows old; and they are absent in the female at all\r\nages; but the females of certain other antelopes and of certain deer\r\nhave been known occasionally to exhibit rudiments of these teeth. (32.\r\nSee Ruppell (in ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ Jan. 12, 1836, p. 3) on the\r\ncanines in deer and antelopes, with a note by Mr. Martin on a female\r\nAmerican deer. See also Falconer (‘Palaeont. Memoirs and Notes,’ vol.\r\ni. 1868, p. 576) on canines in an adult female deer. In old males of\r\nthe musk-deer the canines (Pallas, ‘Spic. Zoolog.’ fasc. xiii. 1779, p.\r\n18) sometimes grow to the length of three inches, whilst in old females\r\na rudiment projects scarcely half an inch above the gums.) Stallions\r\nhave small canine teeth, which are either quite absent or rudimentary\r\nin the mare; but they do not appear to be used in fighting, for\r\nstallions bite with their incisors, and do not open their mouths wide\r\nlike camels and guanacoes. Whenever the adult male possesses canines,\r\nnow inefficient, whilst the female has either none or mere rudiments,\r\nwe may conclude that the early male progenitor of the species was\r\nprovided with efficient canines, which have been partially transferred\r\nto the females. The reduction of these teeth in the males seems to have\r\nfollowed from some change in their manner of fighting, often (but not\r\nin the horse) caused by the development of new weapons.\r\n\r\nTusks and horns are manifestly of high importance to their possessors,\r\nfor their development consumes much organised matter. A single tusk of\r\nthe Asiatic elephant—one of the extinct woolly species—and of the\r\nAfrican elephant, have been known to weigh respectively 150, 160, and\r\n180 pounds; and even greater weights have been given by some authors.\r\n(33. Emerson Tennent, ‘Ceylon,’ 1859, vol. ii. p. 275; Owen, ‘British\r\nFossil Mammals,’ 1846, p. 245.) With deer, in which the horns are\r\nperiodically renewed, the drain on the constitution must be greater;\r\nthe horns, for instance, of the moose weigh from fifty to sixty pounds,\r\nand those of the extinct Irish elk from sixty to seventy pounds—the\r\nskull of the latter weighing on an average only five pounds and a\r\nquarter. Although the horns are not periodically renewed in sheep, yet\r\ntheir development, in the opinion of many agriculturists, entails a\r\nsensible loss to the breeder. Stags, moreover, in escaping from beasts\r\nof prey are loaded with an additional weight for the race, and are\r\ngreatly retarded in passing through a woody country. The moose, for\r\ninstance, with horns extending five and a half feet from tip to tip,\r\nalthough so skilful in their use that he will not touch or break a twig\r\nwhen walking quietly, cannot act so dexterously whilst rushing away\r\nfrom a pack of wolves. “During his progress he holds his nose up, so as\r\nto lay the horns horizontally back; and in this attitude cannot see the\r\nground distinctly.” (34. Richardson, ‘Fauna Bor. Americana,’ on the\r\nmoose, Alces palmata, pp. 236, 237; on the expanse of the horns, ‘Land\r\nand Water,’ 1869, p. 143. See also Owen, ‘British Fossil Mammals,’ on\r\nthe Irish elk, pp. 447, 455.) The tips of the horns of the great Irish\r\nelk were actually eight feet apart! Whilst the horns are covered with\r\nvelvet, which lasts with red-deer for about twelve weeks, they are\r\nextremely sensitive to a blow; so that in Germany the stags at this\r\ntime somewhat change their habits, and avoiding dense forests, frequent\r\nyoung woods and low thickets. (35. ‘Forest Creatures,’ by C. Boner,\r\n1861, p. 60.) These facts remind us that male birds have acquired\r\nornamental plumes at the cost of retarded flight, and other ornaments\r\nat the cost of some loss of power in their battles with rival males.\r\n\r\nWith mammals, when, as is often the case, the sexes differ in size, the\r\nmales are almost always larger and stronger. I am informed by Mr. Gould\r\nthat this holds good in a marked manner with the marsupials of\r\nAustralia, the males of which appear to continue growing until an\r\nunusually late age. But the most extraordinary case is that of one of\r\nthe seals (Callorhinus ursinus), a full-grown female weighing less than\r\none-sixth of a full-grown male. (36. See the very interesting paper by\r\nMr. J.A. Allen in ‘Bull. Mus. Comp. Zoology of Cambridge, United\r\nStates,’ vol. ii. No. 1, p. 82. The weights were ascertained by a\r\ncareful observer, Capt. Bryant. Dr. Gill in ‘The American Naturalist,’\r\nJanuary, 1871, Prof. Shaler on the relative size of the sexes of\r\nwhales, ‘American Naturalist,’ January, 1873.) Dr. Gill remarks that it\r\nis with the polygamous seals, the males of which are well known to\r\nfight savagely together, that the sexes differ much in size; the\r\nmonogamous species differing but little. Whales also afford evidence of\r\nthe relation existing between the pugnacity of the males and their\r\nlarge size compared with that of the female; the males of the\r\nright-whales do not fight together, and they are not larger, but rather\r\nsmaller, than their females; on the other hand, male sperm-whales fight\r\nmuch together, and their bodies are “often found scarred with the\r\nimprint of their rival’s teeth,” and they are double the size of the\r\nfemales. The greater strength of the male, as Hunter long ago remarked\r\n(37. ‘Animal Economy,’ p. 45.), is invariably displayed in those parts\r\nof the body which are brought into action in fighting with rival\r\nmales—for instance, in the massive neck of the bull. Male quadrupeds\r\nare also more courageous and pugnacious than the females. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that these characters have been gained, partly through\r\nsexual selection, owing to a long series of victories, by the stronger\r\nand more courageous males over the weaker, and partly through the\r\ninherited effects of use. It is probable that the successive variations\r\nin strength, size, and courage, whether due to mere variability or to\r\nthe effects of use, by the accumulation of which male quadrupeds have\r\nacquired these characteristic qualities, occurred rather late in life,\r\nand were consequently to a large extent limited in their transmission\r\nto the same sex.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations I was anxious to obtain information as to the\r\nScotch deer-hound, the sexes of which differ more in size than those of\r\nany other breed (though blood-hounds differ considerably), or than in\r\nany wild canine species known to me. Accordingly, I applied to Mr.\r\nCupples, well known for his success with this breed, who has weighed\r\nand measured many of his own dogs, and who has with great kindness\r\ncollected for me the following facts from various sources. Fine male\r\ndogs, measured at the shoulder, range from 28 inches, which is low, to\r\n33 or even 34 inches in height; and in weight from 80 pounds, which is\r\nlight, to 120 pounds, or even more. The females range in height from 23\r\nto 27, or even to 28 inches; and in weight from 50 to 70, or even 80\r\npounds. (38. See also Richardson’s ‘Manual on the Dog,’ p. 59. Much\r\nvaluable information on the Scottish deer-hound is given by Mr.\r\nMcNeill, who first called attention to the inequality in size between\r\nthe sexes, in Scrope’s ‘Art of Deer-Stalking.’ I hope that Mr. Cupples\r\nwill keep to his intention of publishing a full account and history of\r\nthis famous breed.) Mr. Cupples concludes that from 95 to 100 pounds\r\nfor the male, and 70 for the female, would be a safe average; but there\r\nis reason to believe that formerly both sexes attained a greater\r\nweight. Mr. Cupples has weighed puppies when a fortnight old; in one\r\nlitter the average weight of four males exceeded that of two females by\r\nsix and a half ounces; in another litter the average weight of four\r\nmales exceeded that of one female by less than one ounce; the same\r\nmales when three weeks old, exceeded the female by seven and a half\r\nounces, and at the age of six weeks by nearly fourteen ounces. Mr.\r\nWright of Yeldersley House, in a letter to Mr. Cupples, says: “I have\r\ntaken notes on the sizes and weights of puppies of many litters, and as\r\nfar as my experience goes, dog-puppies as a rule differ very little\r\nfrom bitches till they arrive at about five or six months old; and then\r\nthe dogs begin to increase, gaining upon the bitches both in weight and\r\nsize. At birth, and for several weeks afterwards, a bitch-puppy will\r\noccasionally be larger than any of the dogs, but they are invariably\r\nbeaten by them later.” Mr. McNeill, of Colonsay, concludes that “the\r\nmales do not attain their full growth till over two years old, though\r\nthe females attain it sooner.” According to Mr. Cupples’ experience,\r\nmale dogs go on growing in stature till they are from twelve to\r\neighteen months old, and in weight till from eighteen to twenty-four\r\nmonths old; whilst the females cease increasing in stature at the age\r\nof from nine to fourteen or fifteen months, and in weight at the age of\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen months. From these various statements it is\r\nclear that the full difference in size between the male and female\r\nScotch deer-hound is not acquired until rather late in life. The males\r\nalmost exclusively are used for coursing, for, as Mr. McNeill informs\r\nme, the females have not sufficient strength and weight to pull down a\r\nfull-grown deer. From the names used in old legends, it appears, as I\r\nhear from Mr. Cupples, that, at a very ancient period, the males were\r\nthe most celebrated, the females being mentioned only as the mothers of\r\nfamous dogs. Hence, during many generations, it is the male which has\r\nbeen chiefly tested for strength, size, speed, and courage, and the\r\nbest will have been bred from. As, however, the males do not attain\r\ntheir full dimensions until rather late in life, they will have tended,\r\nin accordance with the law often indicated, to transmit their\r\ncharacters to their male offspring alone; and thus the great inequality\r\nin size between the sexes of the Scotch deer-hound may probably be\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 65. Head of Common wild boar, in prime of life (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nThe males of some few quadrupeds possess organs or parts developed\r\nsolely as a means of defence against the attacks of other males. Some\r\nkinds of deer use, as we have seen, the upper branches of their horns\r\nchiefly or exclusively for defending themselves; and the Oryx antelope,\r\nas I am informed by Mr. Bartlett, fences most skilfully with his long,\r\ngently curved horns; but these are likewise used as organs of offence.\r\nThe same observer remarks that rhinoceroses in fighting, parry each\r\nother’s sidelong blows with their horns, which clatter loudly together,\r\nas do the tusks of boars. Although wild boars fight desperately, they\r\nseldom, according to Brehm, receive fatal wounds, as the blows fall on\r\neach other’s tusks, or on the layer of gristly skin covering the\r\nshoulder, called by the German hunters, the shield; and here we have a\r\npart specially modified for defence. With boars in the prime of life\r\n(Fig. 65) the tusks in the lower jaw are used for fighting, but they\r\nbecome in old age, as Brehm states, so much curved inwards and upwards\r\nover the snout that they can no longer be used in this way. They may,\r\nhowever, still serve, and even more effectively, as a means of defence.\r\nIn compensation for the loss of the lower tusks as weapons of offence,\r\nthose in the upper jaw, which always project a little laterally,\r\nincrease in old age so much in length and curve so much upwards that\r\nthey can be used for attack. Nevertheless, an old boar is not so\r\ndangerous to man as one at the age of six or seven years. (39. Brehm,\r\n‘Thierleben,’ B. ii. ss. 729-732.)\r\n\r\n[Fig. 66. Skull of the Babirusa Pig (from Wallace’s ‘Malay\r\nArchipelago’).]\r\n\r\nIn the full-grown male Babirusa pig of Celebes (Fig. 66), the lower\r\ntusks are formidable weapons, like those of the European boar in the\r\nprime of life, whilst the upper tusks are so long and have their points\r\nso much curled inwards, sometimes even touching the forehead, that they\r\nare utterly useless as weapons of attack. They more nearly resemble\r\nhorns than teeth, and are so manifestly useless as teeth that the\r\nanimal was formerly supposed to rest his head by hooking them on to a\r\nbranch! Their convex surfaces, however, if the head were held a little\r\nlaterally, would serve as an excellent guard; and hence, perhaps, it is\r\nthat in old animals they “are generally broken off, as if by fighting.”\r\n(40. See Mr. Wallace’s interesting account of this animal, ‘The Malay\r\nArchipelago,’ 1869, vol. i. p. 435.) Here, then, we have the curious\r\ncase of the upper tusks of the Babirusa regularly assuming during the\r\nprime of life a structure which apparently renders them fitted only for\r\ndefence; whilst in the European boar the lower tusks assume in a less\r\ndegree and only during old age nearly the same form, and then serve in\r\nlike manner solely for defence.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 67. Head of female Aethiopian wart-hog, from ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’\r\n1869, shewing the same characters as the male, though on a reduced\r\nscale. N.B. When the engraving was first made, I was under the\r\nimpression that it represented the male.]\r\n\r\nIn the wart-hog (see Phacochoerus aethiopicus, Fig. 67) the tusks in\r\nthe upper jaw of the male curve upwards during the prime of life, and\r\nfrom being pointed serve as formidable weapons. The tusks in the lower\r\njaw are sharper than those in the upper, but from their shortness it\r\nseems hardly possible that they can be used as weapons of attack. They\r\nmust, however, greatly strengthen those in the upper jaw, from being\r\nground so as to fit closely against their bases. Neither the upper nor\r\nthe lower tusks appear to have been specially modified to act as\r\nguards, though no doubt they are to a certain extent used for this\r\npurpose. But the wart-hog is not destitute of other special means of\r\nprotection, for it has, on each side of the face, beneath the eyes, a\r\nrather stiff, yet flexible, cartilaginous, oblong pad (Fig. 67), which\r\nprojects two or three inches outwards; and it appeared to Mr. Bartlett\r\nand myself, when viewing the living animal, that these pads, when\r\nstruck from beneath by the tusks of an opponent, would be turned\r\nupwards, and would thus admirably protect the somewhat prominent eyes.\r\nI may add, on the authority of Mr. Bartlett, that these boars when\r\nfighting stand directly face to face.\r\n\r\nLastly, the African river-hog (Potomochoerus penicillatus) has a hard\r\ncartilaginous knob on each side of the face beneath the eyes, which\r\nanswers to the flexible pad of the wart-hog; it has also two bony\r\nprominences on the upper jaw above the nostrils. A boar of this species\r\nin the Zoological Gardens recently broke into the cage of the wart-hog.\r\nThey fought all night long, and were found in the morning much\r\nexhausted, but not seriously wounded. It is a significant fact, as\r\nshewing the purposes of the above-described projections and\r\nexcrescences, that these were covered with blood, and were scored and\r\nabraded in an extraordinary manner.\r\n\r\nAlthough the males of so many members of the pig family are provided\r\nwith weapons, and as we have just seen with means of defence, these\r\nweapons seem to have been acquired within a rather late geological\r\nperiod. Dr. Forsyth Major specifies (41. ‘Atti della Soc. Italiana di\r\nSc. Nat.’ 1873, vol. xv. fasc. iv.) several miocene species, in none of\r\nwhich do the tusks appear to have been largely developed in the males;\r\nand Professor Rutimeyer was formerly struck with this same fact.\r\n\r\nThe mane of the lion forms a good defence against the attacks of rival\r\nlions, the one danger to which he is liable; for the males, as Sir A.\r\nSmith informs me, engage in terrible battles, and a young lion dares\r\nnot approach an old one. In 1857 a tiger at Bromwich broke into the\r\ncage of a lion and a fearful scene ensued: “the lion’s mane saved his\r\nneck and head from being much injured, but the tiger at last succeeded\r\nin ripping up his belly, and in a few minutes he was dead.” (42. ‘The\r\nTimes,’ Nov. 10, 1857. In regard to the Canada lynx, see Audubon and\r\nBachman, ‘Quadrupeds of North America,’ 1846, p. 139.) The broad ruff\r\nround the throat and chin of the Canadian lynx (Felis canadensis) is\r\nmuch longer in the male than in the female; but whether it serves as a\r\ndefence I do not know. Male seals are well known to fight desperately\r\ntogether, and the males of certain kinds (Otaria jubata) (43. Dr.\r\nMurie, on Otaria, ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1869, p. 109. Mr. J.A. Allen, in\r\nthe paper above quoted (p. 75), doubts whether the hair, which is\r\nlonger on the neck in the male than in the female, deserves to be\r\ncalled a mane.) have great manes, whilst the females have small ones or\r\nnone. The male baboon of the Cape of Good Hope (Cynocephalus porcarius)\r\nhas a much longer mane and larger canine teeth than the female; and the\r\nmane probably serves as a protection, for, on asking the keepers in the\r\nZoological Gardens, without giving them any clue to my object, whether\r\nany of the monkeys especially attacked each other by the nape of the\r\nneck, I was answered that this was not the case, except with the above\r\nbaboon. In the Hamadryas baboon, Ehrenberg compares the mane of the\r\nadult male to that of a young lion, whilst in the young of both sexes\r\nand in the female the mane is almost absent.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me probable that the immense woolly mane of the male\r\nAmerican bison, which reaches almost to the ground, and is much more\r\ndeveloped in the males than in the females, served as a protection to\r\nthem in their terrible battles; but an experienced hunter told Judge\r\nCaton that he had never observed anything which favoured this belief.\r\nThe stallion has a thicker and fuller mane than the mare; and I have\r\nmade particular inquiries of two great trainers and breeders, who have\r\nhad charge of many entire horses, and am assured that they “invariably\r\nendeavour to seize one another by the neck.” It does not, however,\r\nfollow from the foregoing statements, that when the hair on the neck\r\nserves as a defence, that it was originally developed for this purpose,\r\nthough this is probable in some cases, as in that of the lion. I am\r\ninformed by Mr. McNeill that the long hairs on the throat of the stag\r\n(Cervus elaphus) serve as a great protection to him when hunted, for\r\nthe dogs generally endeavour to seize him by the throat; but it is not\r\nprobable that these hairs were specially developed for this purpose;\r\notherwise the young and the females would have been equally protected.\r\n\r\nCHOICE IN PAIRING BY EITHER SEX OF QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\nBefore describing in the next chapter, the differences between the\r\nsexes in voice, odours emitted, and ornaments, it will be convenient\r\nhere to consider whether the sexes exert any choice in their unions.\r\nDoes the female prefer any particular male, either before or after the\r\nmales may have fought together for supremacy; or does the male, when\r\nnot a polygamist, select any particular female? The general impression\r\namongst breeders seems to be that the male accepts any female; and this\r\nowing to his eagerness, is, in most cases, probably the truth. Whether\r\nthe female as a general rule indifferently accepts any male is much\r\nmore doubtful. In the fourteenth chapter, on Birds, a considerable body\r\nof direct and indirect evidence was advanced, shewing that the female\r\nselects her partner; and it would be a strange anomaly if female\r\nquadrupeds, which stand higher in the scale and have higher mental\r\npowers, did not generally, or at least often, exert some choice. The\r\nfemale could in most cases escape, if wooed by a male that did not\r\nplease or excite her; and when pursued by several males, as commonly\r\noccurs, she would often have the opportunity, whilst they were fighting\r\ntogether, of escaping with some one male, or at least of temporarily\r\npairing with him. This latter contingency has often been observed in\r\nScotland with female red-deer, as I am informed by Sir Philip Egerton\r\nand others. (44. Mr. Boner, in his excellent description of the habits\r\nof the red-deer in Germany (‘Forest Creatures,’ 1861, p. 81) says,\r\n“while the stag is defending his rights against one intruder, another\r\ninvades the sanctuary of his harem, and carries off trophy after\r\ntrophy.” Exactly the same thing occurs with seals; see Mr. J.A. Allen,\r\nibid. p. 100.)\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible that much should be known about female\r\nquadrupeds in a state of nature making any choice in their marriage\r\nunions. The following curious details on the courtship of one of the\r\neared seals (Callorhinus ursinus) are given (45. Mr. J.A. Allen in\r\n‘Bull. Mus. Comp. Zoolog. of Cambridge, United States,’ vol. ii. No. 1,\r\np. 99.) on the authority of Capt. Bryant, who had ample opportunities\r\nfor observation. He says, “Many of the females on their arrival at the\r\nisland where they breed appear desirous of returning to some particular\r\nmale, and frequently climb the outlying rocks to overlook the\r\nrookeries, calling out and listening as if for a familiar voice. Then\r\nchanging to another place they do the same again...As soon as a female\r\nreaches the shore, the nearest male goes down to meet her, making\r\nmeanwhile a noise like the clucking of a hen to her chickens. He bows\r\nto her and coaxes her until he gets between her and the water so that\r\nshe cannot escape him. Then his manner changes, and with a harsh growl\r\nhe drives her to a place in his harem. This continues until the lower\r\nrow of harems is nearly full. Then the males higher up select the time\r\nwhen their more fortunate neighbours are off their guard to steal their\r\nwives. This they do by taking them in their mouths and lifting them\r\nover the heads of the other females, and carefully placing them in\r\ntheir own harem, carrying them as cats do their kittens. Those still\r\nhigher up pursue the same method until the whole space is occupied.\r\nFrequently a struggle ensues between two males for the possession of\r\nthe same female, and both seizing her at once pull her in two or\r\nterribly lacerate her with their teeth. When the space is all filled,\r\nthe old male walks around complacently reviewing his family, scolding\r\nthose who crowd or disturb the others, and fiercely driving off all\r\nintruders. This surveillance always keeps him actively occupied.”\r\n\r\nAs so little is known about the courtship of animals in a state of\r\nnature, I have endeavoured to discover how far our domesticated\r\nquadrupeds evince any choice in their unions. Dogs offer the best\r\nopportunity for observation, as they are carefully attended to and well\r\nunderstood. Many breeders have expressed a strong opinion on this head.\r\nThus, Mr. Mayhew remarks, “The females are able to bestow their\r\naffections; and tender recollections are as potent over them as they\r\nare known to be in other cases, where higher animals are concerned.\r\nBitches are not always prudent in their loves, but are apt to fling\r\nthemselves away on curs of low degree. If reared with a companion of\r\nvulgar appearance, there often springs up between the pair a devotion\r\nwhich no time can afterwards subdue. The passion, for such it really\r\nis, becomes of a more than romantic endurance.” Mr. Mayhew, who\r\nattended chiefly to the smaller breeds, is convinced that the females\r\nare strongly attracted by males of a large size. (46. ‘Dogs: their\r\nManagement,’ by E. Mayhew, M.R.C.V.S., 2nd ed., 1864, pp. 187-192.) The\r\nwell-known veterinary Blaine states (47. Quoted by Alex. Walker, ‘On\r\nIntermarriage,’ 1838, p. 276; see also p. 244.) that his own female pug\r\ndog became so attached to a spaniel, and a female setter to a cur, that\r\nin neither case would they pair with a dog of their own breed until\r\nseveral weeks had elapsed. Two similar and trustworthy accounts have\r\nbeen given me in regard to a female retriever and a spaniel, both of\r\nwhich became enamoured with terrier-dogs.\r\n\r\nMr. Cupples informs me that he can personally vouch for the accuracy of\r\nthe following more remarkable case, in which a valuable and\r\nwonderfully-intelligent female terrier loved a retriever belonging to a\r\nneighbour to such a degree, that she had often to be dragged away from\r\nhim. After their permanent separation, although repeatedly shewing milk\r\nin her teats, she would never acknowledge the courtship of any other\r\ndog, and to the regret of her owner never bore puppies. Mr. Cupples\r\nalso states, that in 1868, a female deerhound in his kennel thrice\r\nproduced puppies, and on each occasion shewed a marked preference for\r\none of the largest and handsomest, but not the most eager, of four\r\ndeerhounds living with her, all in the prime of life. Mr. Cupples has\r\nobserved that the female generally favours a dog whom she has\r\nassociated with and knows; her shyness and timidity at first incline\r\nher against a strange dog. The male, on the contrary, seems rather\r\ninclined towards strange females. It appears to be rare when the male\r\nrefuses any particular female, but Mr. Wright, of Yeldersley House, a\r\ngreat breeder of dogs, informs me that he has known some instances; he\r\ncites the case of one of his own deerhounds, who would not take any\r\nnotice of a particular female mastiff, so that another deerhound had to\r\nbe employed. It would be superfluous to give, as I could, other\r\ninstances, and I will only add that Mr. Barr, who has carefully bred\r\nmany bloodhounds, states that in almost every instance particular\r\nindividuals of opposite sexes shew a decided preference for each other.\r\nFinally, Mr. Cupples, after attending to this subject for another year,\r\nhas written to me, “I have had full confirmation of my former\r\nstatement, that dogs in breeding form decided preferences for each\r\nother, being often influenced by size, bright colour, and individual\r\ncharacters, as well as by the degree of their previous familiarity.”\r\n\r\nIn regard to horses, Mr. Blenkiron, the greatest breeder of race-horses\r\nin the world, informs me that stallions are so frequently capricious in\r\ntheir choice, rejecting one mare and without any apparent cause taking\r\nto another, that various artifices have to be habitually used. The\r\nfamous Monarque, for instance, would never consciously look at the dam\r\nof Gladiateur, and a trick had to be practised. We can partly see the\r\nreason why valuable race-horse stallions, which are in such demand as\r\nto be exhausted, should be so particular in their choice. Mr. Blenkiron\r\nhas never known a mare reject a horse; but this has occurred in Mr.\r\nWright’s stable, so that the mare had to be cheated. Prosper Lucas (48.\r\n‘Traité de l’Héréd. Nat.’ tom. ii. 1850, p. 296.) quotes various\r\nstatements from French authorities, and remarks, “On voit des étalons\r\nqui s’eprennent d’une jument, et negligent toutes les autres.” He\r\ngives, on the authority of Baelen, similar facts in regard to bulls;\r\nand Mr. H. Reeks assures me that a famous short-horn bull belonging to\r\nhis father “invariably refused to be matched with a black cow.”\r\nHoffberg, in describing the domesticated reindeer of Lapland says,\r\n“Foeminae majores et fortiores mares prae caeteris admittunt, ad eos\r\nconfugiunt, a junioribus agitatae, qui hos in fugam conjiciunt.” (49.\r\n‘Amoenitates Acad.’ vol. iv. 1788, p. 160.) A clergyman, who has bred\r\nmany pigs, asserts that sows often reject one boar and immediately\r\naccept another.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts there can be no doubt that, with most of our\r\ndomesticated quadrupeds, strong individual antipathies and preferences\r\nare frequently exhibited, and much more commonly by the female than by\r\nthe male. This being the case, it is improbable that the unions of\r\nquadrupeds in a state of nature should be left to mere chance. It is\r\nmuch more probable that the females are allured or excited by\r\nparticular males, who possess certain characters in a higher degree\r\nthan other males; but what these characters are, we can seldom or never\r\ndiscover with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAMMALS—continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nVoice—Remarkable sexual peculiarities in seals—Odour—Development of the\r\nhair—Colour of the hair and skin—Anomalous case of the female being\r\nmore ornamented than the male—Colour and ornaments due to sexual\r\nselection—Colour acquired for the sake of protection—Colour, though\r\ncommon to both sexes, often due to sexual selection—On the\r\ndisappearance of spots and stripes in adult quadrupeds—On the colours\r\nand ornaments of the Quadrumana—Summary.\r\n\r\nQuadrupeds use their voices for various purposes, as a signal of\r\ndanger, as a call from one member of a troop to another, or from the\r\nmother to her lost offspring, or from the latter for protection to\r\ntheir mother; but such uses need not here be considered. We are\r\nconcerned only with the difference between the voices of the sexes, for\r\ninstance between that of the lion and lioness, or of the bull and cow.\r\nAlmost all male animals use their voices much more during the\r\nrutting-season than at any other time; and some, as the giraffe and\r\nporcupine (1. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 585.), are\r\nsaid to be completely mute excepting at this season. As the throats\r\n(i.e. the larynx and thyroid bodies (2. Ibid. p. 595.)) of stags\r\nperiodically become enlarged at the beginning of the breeding-season,\r\nit might be thought that their powerful voices must be somehow of high\r\nimportance to them; but this is very doubtful. From information given\r\nto me by two experienced observers, Mr. McNeill and Sir P. Egerton, it\r\nseems that young stags under three years old do not roar or bellow; and\r\nthat the old ones begin bellowing at the commencement of the\r\nbreeding-season, at first only occasionally and moderately, whilst they\r\nrestlessly wander about in search of the females. Their battles are\r\nprefaced by loud and prolonged bellowing, but during the actual\r\nconflict they are silent. Animals of all kinds which habitually use\r\ntheir voices utter various noises under any strong emotion, as when\r\nenraged and preparing to fight; but this may merely be the result of\r\nnervous excitement, which leads to the spasmodic contraction of almost\r\nall the muscles of the body, as when a man grinds his teeth and\r\nclenches his fists in rage or agony. No doubt stags challenge each\r\nother to mortal combat by bellowing; but those with the more powerful\r\nvoices, unless at the same time the stronger, better-armed, and more\r\ncourageous, would not gain any advantage over their rivals.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the roaring of the lion may be of some service to\r\nhim by striking terror into his adversary; for when enraged he likewise\r\nerects his mane and thus instinctively tries to make himself appear as\r\nterrible as possible. But it can hardly be supposed that the bellowing\r\nof the stag, even if it be of service to him in this way, can have been\r\nimportant enough to have led to the periodical enlargement of the\r\nthroat. Some writers suggest that the bellowing serves as a call to the\r\nfemale; but the experienced observers above quoted inform me that\r\nfemale deer do not search for the male, though the males search eagerly\r\nfor the females, as indeed might be expected from what we know of the\r\nhabits of other male quadrupeds. The voice of the female, on the other\r\nhand, quickly brings to her one or more stags (3. See, for instance,\r\nMajor W. Ross King (‘The Sportsman in Canada,’ 1866, pp. 53, 131) on\r\nthe habits of the moose and wild reindeer.), as is well known to the\r\nhunters who in wild countries imitate her cry. If we could believe that\r\nthe male had the power to excite or allure the female by his voice, the\r\nperiodical enlargement of his vocal organs would be intelligible on the\r\nprinciple of sexual selection, together with inheritance limited to the\r\nsame sex and season; but we have no evidence in favour of this view. As\r\nthe case stands, the loud voice of the stag during the breeding-season\r\ndoes not seem to be of any special service to him, either during his\r\ncourtship or battles, or in any other way. But may we not believe that\r\nthe frequent use of the voice, under the strong excitement of love,\r\njealousy, and rage, continued during many generations, may at last have\r\nproduced an inherited effect on the vocal organs of the stag, as well\r\nas of other male animals? This appears to me, in our present state of\r\nknowledge, the most probable view.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the adult male gorilla is tremendous, and he is furnished\r\nwith a laryngeal sack, as is the adult male orang. (4. Owen ‘Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 600.) The gibbons rank among the noisiest of\r\nmonkeys, and the Sumatra species (Hylobates syndactylus) is also\r\nfurnished with an air sack; but Mr. Blyth, who has had opportunities\r\nfor observation, does not believe that the male is noisier than the\r\nfemale. Hence, these latter monkeys probably use their voices as a\r\nmutual call; and this is certainly the case with some quadrupeds, for\r\ninstance the beaver. (5. Mr. Green, in ‘Journal of Linnean Society,’\r\nvol. x. ‘Zoology,’ 1869, note 362.) Another gibbon, the H. agilis, is\r\nremarkable, from having the power of giving a complete and correct\r\noctave of musical notes (6. C.L. Martin, ‘General Introduction to the\r\nNatural History of Mamm. Animals,’ 1841, p. 431.), which we may\r\nreasonably suspect serves as a sexual charm; but I shall have to recur\r\nto this subject in the next chapter. The vocal organs of the American\r\nMycetes caraya are one-third larger in the male than in the female, and\r\nare wonderfully powerful. These monkeys in warm weather make the\r\nforests resound at morning and evening with their overwhelming voices.\r\nThe males begin the dreadful concert, and often continue it during many\r\nhours, the females sometimes joining in with their less powerful\r\nvoices. An excellent observer, Rengger (7. ‘Naturgeschichte der\r\nSäugethiere von Paraguay,’ 1830, ss. 15, 21.), could not perceive that\r\nthey were excited to begin by any special cause; he thinks that, like\r\nmany birds, they delight in their own music, and try to excel each\r\nother. Whether most of the foregoing monkeys have acquired their\r\npowerful voices in order to beat their rivals and charm the females—or\r\nwhether the vocal organs have been strengthened and enlarged through\r\nthe inherited effects of long-continued use without any particular good\r\nbeing thus gained—I will not pretend to say; but the former view, at\r\nleast in the case of the Hylobates agilis, seems the most probable.\r\n\r\nI may here mention two very curious sexual peculiarities occurring in\r\nseals, because they have been supposed by some writers to affect the\r\nvoice. The nose of the male sea-elephant (Macrorhinus proboscideus)\r\nbecomes greatly elongated during the breeding-season, and can then be\r\nerected. In this state it is sometimes a foot in length. The female is\r\nnot thus provided at any period of life. The male makes a wild, hoarse,\r\ngurgling noise, which is audible at a great distance and is believed to\r\nbe strengthened by the proboscis; the voice of the female being\r\ndifferent. Lesson compares the erection of the proboscis, with the\r\nswelling of the wattles of male gallinaceous birds whilst courting the\r\nfemales. In another allied kind of seal, the bladder-nose (Cystophora\r\ncristata), the head is covered by a great hood or bladder. This is\r\nsupported by the septum of the nose, which is produced far backwards\r\nand rises into an internal crest seven inches in height. The hood is\r\nclothed with short hair, and is muscular; can be inflated until it more\r\nthan equals the whole head in size! The males when rutting, fight\r\nfuriously on the ice, and their roaring “is said to be sometimes so\r\nloud as to be heard four miles off.” When attacked they likewise roar\r\nor bellow; and whenever irritated the bladder is inflated and quivers.\r\nSome naturalists believe that the voice is thus strengthened, but\r\nvarious other uses have been assigned to this extraordinary structure.\r\nMr. R. Brown thinks that it serves as a protection against accidents of\r\nall kinds; but this is not probable, for, as I am assured by Mr. Lamont\r\nwho killed 600 of these animals, the hood is rudimentary in the\r\nfemales, and it is not developed in the males during youth. (8. On the\r\nsea-elephant, see an article by Lesson, in ‘Dict. Class. Hist. Nat.’\r\ntom. xiii. p. 418. For the Cystophora, or Stemmatopus, see Dr. Dekay,\r\n‘Annals of Lyceum of Nat. Hist.’ New York, vol. i. 1824, p. 94. Pennant\r\nhas also collected information from the sealers on this animal. The\r\nfullest account is given by Mr. Brown, in ‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 1868, p.\r\n435.)\r\n\r\nODOUR.\r\n\r\nWith some animals, as with the notorious skunk of America, the\r\noverwhelming odour which they emit appears to serve exclusively as a\r\ndefence. With shrew-mice (Sorex) both sexes possess abdominal\r\nscent-glands, and there can be little doubt, from the rejection of\r\ntheir bodies by birds and beasts of prey, that the odour is protective;\r\nnevertheless, the glands become enlarged in the males during the\r\nbreeding-season. In many other quadrupeds the glands are of the same\r\nsize in both sexes (9. As with the castoreum of the beaver, see Mr.\r\nL.H. Morgan’s most interesting work, ‘The American Beaver,’ 1868, p.\r\n300. Pallas (‘Spic. Zoolog.’ fasc. viii. 1779, p. 23) has well\r\ndiscussed the odoriferous glands of mammals. Owen (‘Anat. of\r\nVertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 634) also gives an account of these glands,\r\nincluding those of the elephant, and (p. 763) those of shrew-mice. On\r\nbats, Mr. Dobson in ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society’ 1873, p.\r\n241.), but their uses are not known. In other species the glands are\r\nconfined to the males, or are more developed than in the females; and\r\nthey almost always become more active during the rutting-season. At\r\nthis period the glands on the sides of the face of the male elephant\r\nenlarge, and emit a secretion having a strong musky odour. The males,\r\nand rarely the females, of many kinds of bats have glands and\r\nprotrudable sacks situated in various parts; and it is believed that\r\nthese are odoriferous.\r\n\r\nThe rank effluvium of the male goat is well known, and that of certain\r\nmale deer is wonderfully strong and persistent. On the banks of the\r\nPlata I perceived the air tainted with the odour of the male Cervus\r\ncampestris, at half a mile to leeward of a herd; and a silk\r\nhandkerchief, in which I carried home a skin, though often used and\r\nwashed, retained, when first unfolded, traces of the odour for one year\r\nand seven months. This animal does not emit its strong odour until more\r\nthan a year old, and if castrated whilst young never emits it. (10.\r\nRengger, ‘Naturgeschichte der Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ 1830, s. 355.\r\nThis observer also gives some curious particulars in regard to the\r\nodour.) Besides the general odour, permeating the whole body of certain\r\nruminants (for instance, Bos moschatus) in the breeding-season, many\r\ndeer, antelopes, sheep, and goats possess odoriferous glands in various\r\nsituations, more especially on their faces. The so-called tear-sacks,\r\nor suborbital pits, come under this head. These glands secrete a\r\nsemi-fluid fetid matter which is sometimes so copious as to stain the\r\nwhole face, as I have myself seen in an antelope. They are “usually\r\nlarger in the male than in the female, and their development is checked\r\nby castration.” (11. Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 632.\r\nSee also Dr. Murie’s observations on those glands in the ‘Proc. Zoolog.\r\nSoc.’ 1870, p. 340. Desmarest, ‘On the Antilope subgutturosa,\r\n‘Mammalogie,’ 1820, p. 455.) According to Desmarest they are altogether\r\nabsent in the female of Antilope subgutturosa. Hence, there can be no\r\ndoubt that they stand in close relation with the reproductive\r\nfunctions. They are also sometimes present, and sometimes absent, in\r\nnearly allied forms. In the adult male musk-deer (Moschus moschiferus),\r\na naked space round the tail is bedewed with an odoriferous fluid,\r\nwhilst in the adult female, and in the male until two years old, this\r\nspace is covered with hair and is not odoriferous. The proper musk-sack\r\nof this deer is from its position necessarily confined to the male, and\r\nforms an additional scent-organ. It is a singular fact that the matter\r\nsecreted by this latter gland, does not, according to Pallas, change in\r\nconsistence, or increase in quantity, during the rutting-season;\r\nnevertheless this naturalist admits that its presence is in some way\r\nconnected with the act of reproduction. He gives, however, only a\r\nconjectural and unsatisfactory explanation of its use. (12. Pallas,\r\n‘Spicilegia Zoolog.’ fasc. xiii. 1799, p. 24; Desmoulins, ‘Dict. Class.\r\nd’Hist. Nat.’ tom. iii. p. 586.)\r\n\r\nIn most cases, when only the male emits a strong odour during the\r\nbreeding-season, it probably serves to excite or allure the female. We\r\nmust not judge on this head by our own taste, for it is well known that\r\nrats are enticed by certain essential oils, and cats by valerian,\r\nsubstances far from agreeable to us; and that dogs, though they will\r\nnot eat carrion, sniff and roll on it. From the reasons given when\r\ndiscussing the voice of the stag, we may reject the idea that the odour\r\nserves to bring the females from a distance to the males. Active and\r\nlong-continued use cannot here have come into play, as in the case of\r\nthe vocal organs. The odour emitted must be of considerable importance\r\nto the male, inasmuch as large and complex glands, furnished with\r\nmuscles for everting the sack, and for closing or opening the orifice,\r\nhave in some cases been developed. The development of these organs is\r\nintelligible through sexual selection, if the most odoriferous males\r\nare the most successful in winning the females, and in leaving\r\noffspring to inherit their gradually perfected glands and odours.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE HAIR.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that male quadrupeds often have the hair on their necks\r\nand shoulders much more developed than the females; and many additional\r\ninstances could be given. This sometimes serves as a defence to the\r\nmale during his battles; but whether the hair in most cases has been\r\nspecially developed for this purpose, is very doubtful. We may feel\r\nalmost certain that this is not the case, when only a thin and narrow\r\ncrest runs along the back; for a crest of this kind would afford\r\nscarcely any protection, and the ridge of the back is not a place\r\nlikely to be injured; nevertheless such crests are sometimes confined\r\nto the males, or are much more developed in them than in the females.\r\nTwo antelopes, the Tragelaphus scriptus (13. Dr. Gray, ‘Gleanings from\r\nthe Menagerie at Knowsley,’ pl. 28.) (Fig. 70) and Portax picta may be\r\ngiven as instances. When stags, and the males of the wild goat, are\r\nenraged or terrified, these crests stand erect (14. Judge Caton on the\r\nWapiti, ‘Transact. Ottawa Acad. Nat. Sciences,’ 1868, pp. 36, 40;\r\nBlyth, ‘Land and Water,’ on Capra aegagrus 1867, p. 37.); but it cannot\r\nbe supposed that they have been developed merely for the sake of\r\nexciting fear in their enemies. One of the above-named antelopes, the\r\nPortax picta, has a large well-defined brush of black hair on the\r\nthroat, and this is much larger in the male than in the female. In the\r\nAmmotragus tragelaphus of North Africa, a member of the sheep-family,\r\nthe fore-legs are almost concealed by an extraordinary growth of hair,\r\nwhich depends from the neck and upper halves of the legs; but Mr.\r\nBartlett does not believe that this mantle is of the least use to the\r\nmale, in whom it is much more developed than in the female.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 68. Pithecia satanas, male (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nMale quadrupeds of many kinds differ from the females in having more\r\nhair, or hair of a different character, on certain parts of their\r\nfaces. Thus the bull alone has curled hair on the forehead. (15.\r\nHunter’s ‘Essays and Observations,’ edited by Owen, 1861. vol. i. p.\r\n236.) In three closely-allied sub-genera of the goat family, only the\r\nmales possess beards, sometimes of large size; in two other sub-genera\r\nboth sexes have a beard, but it disappears in some of the domestic\r\nbreeds of the common goat; and neither sex of the Hemitragus has a\r\nbeard. In the ibex the beard is not developed during the summer, and is\r\nso small at other times that it may be called rudimentary. (16. See Dr.\r\nGray’s ‘Catalogue of Mammalia in the British Museum,’ part iii. 1852,\r\np. 144.) With some monkeys the beard is confined to the male, as in the\r\norang; or is much larger in the male than in the female, as in the\r\nMycetes caraya and Pithecia satanas (Fig. 68). So it is with the\r\nwhiskers of some species of Macacus (17. Rengger, ‘Säugethiere,’ etc.,\r\ns. 14; Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p. 86.), and, as we have seen, with the\r\nmanes of some species of baboons. But with most kinds of monkeys the\r\nvarious tufts of hair about the face and head are alike in both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe males of various members of the ox family (Bovidae), and of certain\r\nantelopes, are furnished with a dewlap, or great fold of skin on the\r\nneck, which is much less developed in the female.\r\n\r\nNow, what must we conclude with respect to such sexual differences as\r\nthese? No one will pretend that the beards of certain male goats, or\r\nthe dewlaps of the bull, or the crests of hair along the backs of\r\ncertain male antelopes, are of any use to them in their ordinary\r\nhabits. It is possible that the immense beard of the male Pithecia, and\r\nthe large beard of the male orang, may protect their throats when\r\nfighting; for the keepers in the Zoological Gardens inform me that many\r\nmonkeys attack each other by the throat; but it is not probable that\r\nthe beard has been developed for a distinct purpose from that served by\r\nthe whiskers, moustache, and other tufts of hair on the face; and no\r\none will suppose that these are useful as a protection. Must we\r\nattribute all these appendages of hair or skin to mere purposeless\r\nvariability in the male? It cannot be denied that this is possible; for\r\nin many domesticated quadrupeds, certain characters, apparently not\r\nderived through reversion from any wild parent form, are confined to\r\nthe males, or are more developed in them than in the females—for\r\ninstance, the hump on the male zebu-cattle of India, the tail of\r\nfat-tailed rams, the arched outline of the forehead in the males of\r\nseveral breeds of sheep, and lastly, the mane, the long hairs on the\r\nhind legs, and the dewlap of the male of the Berbura goat. (18. See the\r\nchapters on these several animals in vol. i. of my ‘Variation of\r\nAnimals under Domestication;’ also vol. ii. p. 73; also chap. xx. on\r\nthe practice of selection by semi-civilised people. For the Berbura\r\ngoat, see Dr. Gray, ‘Catalogue,’ ibid. p. 157.) The mane, which occurs\r\nonly in the rams of an African breed of sheep, is a true secondary\r\nsexual character, for, as I hear from Mr. Winwood Reade, it is not\r\ndeveloped if the animal be castrated. Although we ought to be extremely\r\ncautious, as shewn in my work on ‘Variation under Domestication,’ in\r\nconcluding that any character, even with animals kept by semi-civilised\r\npeople, has not been subjected to selection by man, and thus augmented,\r\nyet in the cases just specified this is improbable; more especially as\r\nthe characters are confined to the males, or are more strongly\r\ndeveloped in them than in the females. If it were positively known that\r\nthe above African ram is a descendant of the same primitive stock as\r\nthe other breeds of sheep, and if the Berbura male-goat with his mane,\r\ndewlap, etc., is descended from the same stock as other goats, then,\r\nassuming that selection has not been applied to these characters, they\r\nmust be due to simple variability, together with sexually-limited\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nHence it appears reasonable to extend this same view to all analogous\r\ncases with animals in a state of nature. Nevertheless I cannot persuade\r\nmyself that it generally holds good, as in the case of the\r\nextraordinary development of hair on the throat and fore-legs of the\r\nmale Ammotragus, or in that of the immense beard of the male Pithecia.\r\nSuch study as I have been able to give to nature makes me believe that\r\nparts or organs which are highly developed, were acquired at some\r\nperiod for a special purpose. With those antelopes in which the adult\r\nmale is more strongly-coloured than the female, and with those monkeys\r\nin which the hair on the face is elegantly arranged and coloured in a\r\ndiversified manner, it seems probable that the crests and tufts of hair\r\nwere gained as ornaments; and this I know is the opinion of some\r\nnaturalists. If this be correct, there can be little doubt that they\r\nwere gained or at least modified through sexual selection; but how far\r\nthe same view may be extended to other mammals is doubtful.\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF THE HAIR AND OF THE NAKED SKIN.\r\n\r\nI will first give briefly all the cases known to me of male quadrupeds\r\ndiffering in colour from the females. With Marsupials, as I am informed\r\nby Mr. Gould, the sexes rarely differ in this respect; but the great\r\nred kangaroo offers a striking exception, “delicate blue being the\r\nprevailing tint in those parts of the female which in the male are\r\nred.” (19. Osphranter rufus, Gould, ‘Mammals of Australia,’ 1863, vol.\r\nii. On the Didelphis, Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p. 256.) In the\r\nDidelphis opossum of Cayenne the female is said to be a little more red\r\nthan the male. Of the Rodents, Dr. Gray remarks: “African squirrels,\r\nespecially those found in the tropical regions, have the fur much\r\nbrighter and more vivid at some seasons of the year than at others, and\r\nthe fur of the male is generally brighter than that of the female.”\r\n(20. ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History,’ Nov. 1867, p. 325. On\r\nthe Mus minutus, Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p. 304.) Dr. Gray informs me\r\nthat he specified the African squirrels, because, from their unusually\r\nbright colours, they best exhibit this difference. The female of the\r\nMus minutus of Russia is of a paler and dirtier tint than the male. In\r\na large number of bats the fur of the male is lighter than in the\r\nfemale. (21. J.A. Allen, in ‘Bulletin of Mus. Comp. Zoolog. of\r\nCambridge, United States,’ 1869, p. 207. Mr. Dobson on sexual\r\ncharacters in the Chiroptera, ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society,’\r\n1873, p. 241. Dr. Gray on Sloths, ibid. 1871, p. 436.) Mr. Dobson also\r\nremarks, with respect to these animals: “Differences, depending partly\r\nor entirely on the possession by the male of fur of a much more\r\nbrilliant hue, or distinguished by different markings or by the greater\r\nlength of certain portions, are met only, to any appreciable extent, in\r\nthe frugivorous bats in which the sense of sight is well developed.”\r\nThis last remark deserves attention, as bearing on the question whether\r\nbright colours are serviceable to male animals from being ornamental.\r\nIn one genus of sloths, it is now established, as Dr. Gray states,\r\n“that the males are ornamented differently from the females—that is to\r\nsay, that they have a patch of soft short hair between the shoulders,\r\nwhich is generally of a more or less orange colour, and in one species\r\npure white. The females, on the contrary, are destitute of this mark.”\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial Carnivora and Insectivora rarely exhibit sexual\r\ndifferences of any kind, including colour. The ocelot (Felis pardalis),\r\nhowever, is exceptional, for the colours of the female, compared with\r\nthose of the male, are “moins apparentes, le fauve, étant plus terne,\r\nle blanc moins pur, les raies ayant moins de largeur et les taches\r\nmoins de diamètre.” (22. Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ 1820, p. 220. On\r\nFelis mitis, Rengger, ibid. s. 194.) The sexes of the allied Felis\r\nmitis also differ, but in a less degree; the general hues of the female\r\nbeing rather paler than in the male, with the spots less black. The\r\nmarine Carnivora or seals, on the other hand, sometimes differ\r\nconsiderably in colour, and they present, as we have already seen,\r\nother remarkable sexual differences. Thus the male of the Otaria\r\nnigrescens of the southern hemisphere is of a rich brown shade above;\r\nwhilst the female, who acquires her adult tints earlier in life than\r\nthe male, is dark-grey above, the young of both sexes being of a deep\r\nchocolate colour. The male of the northern Phoca groenlandica is tawny\r\ngrey, with a curious saddle-shaped dark mark on the back; the female is\r\nmuch smaller, and has a very different appearance, being “dull white or\r\nyellowish straw-colour, with a tawny hue on the back”; the young at\r\nfirst are pure white, and can “hardly be distinguished among the icy\r\nhummocks and snow, their colour thus acting as a protection.” (23. Dr.\r\nMurie on the Otaria, ‘Proceedings Zoological Society,’ 1869, p. 108.\r\nMr. R. Brown on the P. groenlandica, ibid. 1868, p. 417. See also on\r\nthe colours of seals, Desmarest, ibid. pp. 243, 249.)\r\n\r\nWith Ruminants sexual differences of colour occur more commonly than in\r\nany other order. A difference of this kind is general in the\r\nStrepsicerene antelopes; thus the male nilghau (Portax picta) is\r\nbluish-grey and much darker than the female, with the square white\r\npatch on the throat, the white marks on the fetlocks, and the black\r\nspots on the ears all much more distinct. We have seen that in this\r\nspecies the crests and tufts of hair are likewise more developed in the\r\nmale than in the hornless female. I am informed by Mr. Blyth that the\r\nmale, without shedding his hair, periodically becomes darker during the\r\nbreeding-season. Young males cannot be distinguished from young females\r\nuntil about twelve months old; and if the male is emasculated before\r\nthis period, he never, according to the same authority, changes colour.\r\nThe importance of this latter fact, as evidence that the colouring of\r\nthe Portax is of sexual origin, becomes obvious, when we hear (24.\r\nJudge Caton, in ‘Transactions of the Ottawa Academy of Natural\r\nSciences,’ 1868, p. 4.) that neither the red summer-coat nor the blue\r\nwinter-coat of the Virginian deer is at all affected by emasculation.\r\nWith most or all of the highly-ornamented species of Tragelaphus the\r\nmales are darker than the hornless females, and their crests of hair\r\nare more fully developed. In the male of that magnificent antelope, the\r\nDerbyan eland, the body is redder, the whole neck much blacker, and the\r\nwhite band which separates these colours broader than in the female. In\r\nthe Cape eland, also, the male is slightly darker than the female. (25.\r\nDr. Gray, ‘Cat. of Mamm. in Brit. Mus.’ part iii. 1852, pp. 134-142;\r\nalso Dr. Gray, ‘Gleanings from the Menagerie of Knowsley,’ in which\r\nthere is a splendid drawing of the Oreas derbianus: see the text on\r\nTragelaphus. For the Cape eland (Oreas canna), see Andrew Smith,\r\n‘Zoology of S. Africa,’ pl. 41 and 42. There are also many of these\r\nAntelopes in the Zoological Gardens.)\r\n\r\nIn the Indian black-buck (A. bezoartica), which belongs to another\r\ntribe of antelopes, the male is very dark, almost black; whilst the\r\nhornless female is fawn-coloured. We meet in this species, as Mr. Blyth\r\ninforms me, with an exactly similar series of facts, as in the Portax\r\npicta, namely, in the male periodically changing colour during the\r\nbreeding-season, in the effects of emasculation on this change, and in\r\nthe young of both sexes being indistinguishable from each other. In the\r\nAntilope niger the male is black, the female, as well as the young of\r\nboth sexes, being brown; in A. sing-sing the male is much brighter\r\ncoloured than the hornless female, and his chest and belly are blacker;\r\nin the male A. caama, the marks and lines which occur on various parts\r\nof the body are black, instead of brown as in the female; in the\r\nbrindled gnu (A. gorgon) “the colours of the male are nearly the same\r\nas those of the female, only deeper and of a brighter hue.” (26. On the\r\nAnt. niger, see ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1850, p. 133. With respect to an\r\nallied species, in which there is an equal sexual difference in colour,\r\nsee Sir S. Baker, ‘The Albert Nyanza,’ 1866, vol. ii. p. 627. For the\r\nA. sing-sing, Gray, ‘Cat. B. Mus.’ p. 100. Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p.\r\n468, on the A. caama. Andrew Smith, ‘Zoology of S. Africa,’ on the\r\nGnu.) Other analogous cases could be added.\r\n\r\nThe Banteng bull (Bos sondaicus) of the Malayan Archipelago is almost\r\nblack, with white legs and buttocks; the cow is of a bright dun, as are\r\nthe young males until about the age of three years, when they rapidly\r\nchange colour. The emasculated bull reverts to the colour of the\r\nfemale. The female Kemas goat is paler, and both it and the female\r\nCapra aegagrus are said to be more uniformly tinted than their males.\r\nDeer rarely present any sexual differences in colour. Judge Caton,\r\nhowever, informs me that in the males of the wapiti deer (Cervus\r\ncanadensis) the neck, belly, and legs are much darker than in the\r\nfemale; but during the winter the darker tints gradually fade away and\r\ndisappear. I may here mention that Judge Caton has in his park three\r\nraces of the Virginian deer, which differ slightly in colour, but the\r\ndifferences are almost exclusively confined to the blue winter or\r\nbreeding-coat; so that this case may be compared with those given in a\r\nprevious chapter of closely-allied or representative species of birds,\r\nwhich differ from each other only in their breeding plumage. (27.\r\n‘Ottawa Academy of Sciences,’ May 21, 1868, pp. 3, 5.) The females of\r\nCervus paludosus of S. America, as well as the young of both sexes, do\r\nnot possess the black stripes on the nose and the blackish-brown line\r\non the breast, which are characteristic of the adult males. (28. S.\r\nMuller, on the Banteng, ‘Zoog. Indischen Archipel.’ 1839-1844, tab. 35;\r\nsee also Raffles, as quoted by Mr. Blyth, in ‘Land and Water,’ 1867, p.\r\n476. On goats, Dr. Gray, ‘Catalogue of the British Museum,’ p. 146;\r\nDesmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p. 482. On the Cervus paludosus, Rengger,\r\nibid. s. 345.) Lastly, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, the mature male\r\nof the beautifully coloured and spotted axis deer is considerably\r\ndarker than the female: and this hue the castrated male never acquires.\r\n\r\nThe last Order which we need consider is that of the Primates. The male\r\nof the Lemur macaco is generally coal-black, whilst the female is\r\nbrown. (29. Sclater, ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1866, p. i. The same fact has\r\nalso been fully ascertained by MM. Pollen and van Dam. See, also, Dr.\r\nGray in ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History,’ May 1871, p. 340.) Of\r\nthe Quadrumana of the New World, the females and young of Mycetes\r\ncaraya are greyish-yellow and like each other; in the second year the\r\nyoung male becomes reddish-brown; in the third, black, excepting the\r\nstomach, which, however, becomes quite black in the fourth or fifth\r\nyear. There is also a strongly-marked difference in colour between the\r\nsexes of Mycetes seniculus and Cebus capucinus; the young of the\r\nformer, and I believe of the latter species, resembling the females.\r\nWith Pithecia leucocephala the young likewise resemble the females,\r\nwhich are brownish-black above and light rusty-red beneath, the adult\r\nmales being black. The ruff of hair round the face of Ateles marginatus\r\nis tinted yellow in the male and white in the female. Turning to the\r\nOld World, the males of Hylobates hoolock are always black, with the\r\nexception of a white band over the brows; the females vary from\r\nwhity-brown to a dark tint mixed with black, but are never wholly\r\nblack. (30. On Mycetes, Rengger, ibid. s. 14; and Brehm, ‘Thierleben,’\r\nB. i. s. 96, 107. On Ateles Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p. 75. On\r\nHylobates, Blyth, ‘Land and Water,’ 1867, p. 135. On the Semnopithecus,\r\nS. Muller, ‘Zoog. Indischen Archipel.’ tab. x.) In the beautiful\r\nCercopithecus diana, the head of the adult male is of an intense black,\r\nwhilst that of the female is dark grey; in the former the fur between\r\nthe thighs is of an elegant fawn-colour, in the latter it is paler. In\r\nthe beautiful and curious moustache monkey (Cercopithecus cephus) the\r\nonly difference between the sexes is that the tail of the male is\r\nchestnut and that of the female grey; but Mr. Bartlett informs me that\r\nall the hues become more pronounced in the male when adult, whilst in\r\nthe female they remain as they were during youth. According to the\r\ncoloured figures given by Solomon Muller, the male of Semnopithecus\r\nchrysomelas is nearly black, the female being pale brown. In the\r\nCercopithecus cynosurus and griseo-viridis one part of the body, which\r\nis confined to the male sex, is of the most brilliant blue or green,\r\nand contrasts strikingly with the naked skin on the hinder part of the\r\nbody, which is vivid red.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 69. Head of male Mandrill (from Gervais, ‘Hist. Nat. des\r\nMammifères’).]\r\n\r\nLastly, in the baboon family, the adult male of Cynocephalus hamadryas\r\ndiffers from the female not only by his immense mane, but slightly in\r\nthe colour of the hair and of the naked callosities. In the drill (C.\r\nleucophaeus) the females and young are much paler-coloured, with less\r\ngreen, than the adult males. No other member in the whole class of\r\nmammals is coloured in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male\r\nmandrill (C. mormon). The face at this age becomes of a fine blue, with\r\nthe ridge and tip of the nose of the most brilliant red. According to\r\nsome authors, the face is also marked with whitish stripes, and is\r\nshaded in parts with black, but the colours appear to be variable. On\r\nthe forehead there is a crest of hair, and on the chin a yellow beard.\r\n“Toutes les parties supérieures de leurs cuisses et le grand espace nu\r\nde leurs fesses sont également colorés du rouge le plus vif, avec un\r\nmélange de bleu qui ne manque reellement pas d’élégance.” (31. Gervais,\r\n‘Hist. Nat. des Mammifères,’ 1854, p. 103. Figures are given of the\r\nskull of the male. Also Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p. 70. Geoffroy\r\nSt.-Hilaire and F. Cuvier, ‘Hist. Nat. des Mammifères,’ 1824, tom. i.)\r\nWhen the animal is excited all the naked parts become much more vividly\r\ntinted. Several authors have used the strongest expressions in\r\ndescribing these resplendent colours, which they compare with those of\r\nthe most brilliant birds. Another remarkable peculiarity is that when\r\nthe great canine teeth are fully developed, immense protuberances of\r\nbone are formed on each cheek, which are deeply furrowed\r\nlongitudinally, and the naked skin over them is brilliantly-coloured,\r\nas just-described. (Fig. 69.) In the adult females and in the young of\r\nboth sexes these protuberances are scarcely perceptible; and the naked\r\nparts are much less bright coloured, the face being almost black,\r\ntinged with blue. In the adult female, however, the nose at certain\r\nregular intervals of time becomes tinted with red.\r\n\r\nIn all the cases hitherto given the male is more strongly or brighter\r\ncoloured than the female, and differs from the young of both sexes. But\r\nas with some few birds it is the female which is brighter coloured than\r\nthe male, so with the Rhesus monkey (Macacus rhesus), the female has a\r\nlarge surface of naked skin round the tail, of a brilliant carmine red,\r\nwhich, as I was assured by the keepers in the Zoological Gardens,\r\nperiodically becomes even yet more vivid, and her face also is pale\r\nred. On the other hand, in the adult male and in the young of both\r\nsexes (as I saw in the Gardens), neither the naked skin at the\r\nposterior end of the body, nor the face, shew a trace of red. It\r\nappears, however, from some published accounts, that the male does\r\noccasionally, or during certain seasons, exhibit some traces of the\r\nred. Although he is thus less ornamented than the female, yet in the\r\nlarger size of his body, larger canine teeth, more developed whiskers,\r\nmore prominent superciliary ridges, he follows the common rule of the\r\nmale excelling the female.\r\n\r\nI have now given all the cases known to me of a difference in colour\r\nbetween the sexes of mammals. Some of these may be the result of\r\nvariations confined to one sex and transmitted to the same sex, without\r\nany good being gained, and therefore without the aid of selection. We\r\nhave instances of this with our domesticated animals, as in the males\r\nof certain cats being rusty-red, whilst the females are tortoise-shell\r\ncoloured. Analogous cases occur in nature: Mr. Bartlett has seen many\r\nblack varieties of the jaguar, leopard, vulpine phalanger, and wombat;\r\nand he is certain that all, or nearly all these animals, were males. On\r\nthe other hand, with wolves, foxes, and apparently American squirrels,\r\nboth sexes are occasionally born black. Hence it is quite possible that\r\nwith some mammals a difference in colour between the sexes, especially\r\nwhen this is congenital, may simply be the result, without the aid of\r\nselection, of the occurrence of one or more variations, which from the\r\nfirst were sexually limited in their transmission. Nevertheless it is\r\nimprobable that the diversified, vivid, and contrasted colours of\r\ncertain quadrupeds, for instance, of the above monkeys and antelopes,\r\ncan thus be accounted for. We should bear in mind that these colours do\r\nnot appear in the male at birth, but only at or near maturity; and that\r\nunlike ordinary variations, they are lost if the male be emasculated.\r\nIt is on the whole probable that the strongly-marked colours and other\r\nornamental characters of male quadrupeds are beneficial to them in\r\ntheir rivalry with other males, and have consequently been acquired\r\nthrough sexual selection. This view is strengthened by the differences\r\nin colour between the sexes occurring almost exclusively, as may be\r\ncollected from the previous details, in those groups and sub-groups of\r\nmammals which present other and strongly-marked secondary sexual\r\ncharacters; these being likewise due to sexual selection.\r\n\r\nQuadrupeds manifestly take notice of colour. Sir S. Baker repeatedly\r\nobserved that the African elephant and rhinoceros attacked white or\r\ngrey horses with special fury. I have elsewhere shewn (32. The\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ 1868, vol. ii.\r\npp. 102, 103.) that half-wild horses apparently prefer to pair with\r\nthose of the same colour, and that herds of fallow-deer of different\r\ncolours, though living together, have long kept distinct. It is a more\r\nsignificant fact that a female zebra would not admit the addresses of a\r\nmale ass until he was painted so as to resemble a zebra, and then, as\r\nJohn Hunter remarks, “she received him very readily. In this curious\r\nfact, we have instinct excited by mere colour, which had so strong an\r\neffect as to get the better of everything else. But the male did not\r\nrequire this, the female being an animal somewhat similar to himself,\r\nwas sufficient to rouse him.” (33. ‘Essays and Observations,’ by J.\r\nHunter, edited by Owen, 1861, vol. i. p. 194.)\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter we have seen that the mental powers of the higher\r\nanimals do not differ in kind, though greatly in degree, from the\r\ncorresponding powers of man, especially of the lower and barbarous\r\nraces; and it would appear that even their taste for the beautiful is\r\nnot widely different from that of the Quadrumana. As the negro of\r\nAfrica raises the flesh on his face into parallel ridges “or\r\ncicatrices, high above the natural surface, which unsightly deformities\r\nare considered great personal attractions” (34. Sir S. Baker, ‘The Nile\r\nTributaries of Abyssinia,’ 1867.);—as negroes and savages in many parts\r\nof the world paint their faces with red, blue, white, or black bars,—so\r\nthe male mandrill of Africa appears to have acquired his\r\ndeeply-furrowed and gaudily-coloured face from having been thus\r\nrendered attractive to the female. No doubt it is to us a most\r\ngrotesque notion that the posterior end of the body should be coloured\r\nfor the sake of ornament even more brilliantly than the face; but this\r\nis not more strange than that the tails of many birds should be\r\nespecially decorated.\r\n\r\nWith mammals we do not at present possess any evidence that the males\r\ntake pains to display their charms before the female; and the elaborate\r\nmanner in which this is performed by male birds and other animals is\r\nthe strongest argument in favour of the belief that the females admire,\r\nor are excited by, the ornaments and colours displayed before them.\r\nThere is, however, a striking parallelism between mammals and birds in\r\nall their secondary sexual characters, namely in their weapons for\r\nfighting with rival males, in their ornamental appendages, and in their\r\ncolours. In both classes, when the male differs from the female, the\r\nyoung of both sexes almost always resemble each other, and in a large\r\nmajority of cases resemble the adult female. In both classes the male\r\nassumes the characters proper to his sex shortly before the age of\r\nreproduction; and if emasculated at an early period, loses them. In\r\nboth classes the change of colour is sometimes seasonal, and the tints\r\nof the naked parts sometimes become more vivid during the act of\r\ncourtship. In both classes the male is almost always more vividly or\r\nstrongly coloured than the female, and is ornamented with larger crests\r\nof hair or feathers, or other such appendages. In a few exceptional\r\ncases the female in both classes is more highly ornamented than the\r\nmale. With many mammals, and at least in the case of one bird, the male\r\nis more odoriferous than the female. In both classes the voice of the\r\nmale is more powerful than that of the female. Considering this\r\nparallelism, there can be little doubt that the same cause, whatever it\r\nmay be, has acted on mammals and birds; and the result, as far as\r\nornamental characters are concerned, may be attributed, as it appears\r\nto me, to the long-continued preference of the individuals of one sex\r\nfor certain individuals of the opposite sex, combined with their\r\nsuccess in leaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their\r\nsuperior attractions.\r\n\r\nEQUAL TRANSMISSION OF ORNAMENTAL CHARACTERS TO BOTH SEXES.\r\n\r\nWith many birds, ornaments, which analogy leads us to believe were\r\nprimarily acquired by the males, have been transmitted equally, or\r\nalmost equally, to both sexes; and we may now enquire how far this view\r\napplies to mammals. With a considerable number of species, especially\r\nof the smaller kinds, both sexes have been coloured, independently of\r\nsexual selection, for the sake of protection; but not, as far as I can\r\njudge, in so many cases, nor in so striking a manner, as in most of the\r\nlower classes. Audubon remarks that he often mistook the musk-rat (35.\r\nFiber zibethicus, Audubon and Bachman, ‘The Quadrupeds of North\r\nAmerica,’ 1846, p. 109.), whilst sitting on the banks of a muddy\r\nstream, for a clod of earth, so complete was the resemblance. The hare\r\non her form is a familiar instance of concealment through colour; yet\r\nthis principle partly fails in a closely-allied species, the rabbit,\r\nfor when running to its burrow, it is made conspicuous to the\r\nsportsman, and no doubt to all beasts of prey, by its upturned white\r\ntail. No one doubts that the quadrupeds inhabiting snow-clad regions\r\nhave been rendered white to protect them from their enemies, or to\r\nfavour their stealing on their prey. In regions where snow never lies\r\nfor long, a white coat would be injurious; consequently, species of\r\nthis colour are extremely rare in the hotter parts of the world. It\r\ndeserves notice that many quadrupeds inhabiting moderately cold\r\nregions, although they do not assume a white winter dress, become paler\r\nduring this season; and this apparently is the direct result of the\r\nconditions to which they have long been exposed. Pallas (36. ‘Novae\r\nspecies Quadrupedum e Glirium ordine,’ 1778, p. 7. What I have called\r\nthe roe is the Capreolus sibiricus subecaudatus of Pallas.) states that\r\nin Siberia a change of this nature occurs with the wolf, two species of\r\nMustela, the domestic horse, the Equus hemionus, the domestic cow, two\r\nspecies of antelopes, the musk-deer, the roe, elk, and reindeer. The\r\nroe, for instance, has a red summer and a greyish-white winter coat;\r\nand the latter may perhaps serve as a protection to the animal whilst\r\nwandering through the leafless thickets, sprinkled with snow and\r\nhoar-frost. If the above-named animals were gradually to extend their\r\nrange into regions perpetually covered with snow, their pale\r\nwinter-coats would probably be rendered through natural selection,\r\nwhiter and whiter, until they became as white as snow.\r\n\r\nMr. Reeks has given me a curious instance of an animal profiting by\r\nbeing peculiarly coloured. He raised from fifty to sixty white and\r\nbrown piebald rabbits in a large walled orchard; and he had at the same\r\ntime some similarly coloured cats in his house. Such cats, as I have\r\noften noticed, are very conspicuous during day; but as they used to lie\r\nin watch during the dusk at the mouths of the burrows, the rabbits\r\napparently did not distinguish them from their parti-coloured brethren.\r\nThe result was that, within eighteen months, every one of these\r\nparti-coloured rabbits was destroyed; and there was evidence that this\r\nwas effected by the cats. Colour seems to be advantageous to another\r\nanimal, the skunk, in a manner of which we have had many instances in\r\nother classes. No animal will voluntarily attack one of these creatures\r\non account of the dreadful odour which it emits when irritated; but\r\nduring the dusk it would not easily be recognised and might be attacked\r\nby a beast of prey. Hence it is, as Mr. Belt believes (37. ‘The\r\nNaturalist in Nicaragua,’ p. 249.), that the skunk is provided with a\r\ngreat white bushy tail, which serves as a conspicuous warning.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 70. Tragelaphus scriptus, male (from the Knowsley Menagerie).\r\n\r\nFig. 71. Damalis pygarga, male (from the Knowsley Menagerie).]\r\n\r\nAlthough we must admit that many quadrupeds have received their present\r\ntints either as a protection, or as an aid in procuring prey, yet with\r\na host of species, the colours are far too conspicuous and too\r\nsingularly arranged to allow us to suppose that they serve for these\r\npurposes. We may take as an illustration certain antelopes; when we see\r\nthe square white patch on the throat, the white marks on the fetlocks,\r\nand the round black spots on the ears, all more distinct in the male of\r\nthe Portax picta, than in the female;—when we see that the colours are\r\nmore vivid, that the narrow white lines on the flank and the broad\r\nwhite bar on the shoulder are more distinct in the male Oreas derbyanus\r\nthan in the female;—when we see a similar difference between the sexes\r\nof the curiously-ornamented Tragelaphus scriptus (Fig. 70),—we cannot\r\nbelieve that differences of this kind are of any service to either sex\r\nin their daily habits of life. It seems a much more probable conclusion\r\nthat the various marks were first acquired by the males and their\r\ncolours intensified through sexual selection, and then partially\r\ntransferred to the females. If this view be admitted, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the equally singular colours and marks of many other\r\nantelopes, though common to both sexes, have been gained and\r\ntransmitted in a like manner. Both sexes, for instance, of the koodoo\r\n(Strepsiceros kudu) (Fig. 64) have narrow white vertical lines on their\r\nhind flanks, and an elegant angular white mark on their foreheads. Both\r\nsexes in the genus Damalis are very oddly coloured; in D. pygarga the\r\nback and neck are purplish-red, shading on the flanks into black; and\r\nthese colours are abruptly separated from the white belly and from a\r\nlarge white space on the buttocks; the head is still more oddly\r\ncoloured, a large oblong white mask, narrowly-edged with black, covers\r\nthe face up to the eyes (Fig. 71); there are three white stripes on the\r\nforehead, and the ears are marked with white. The fawns of this species\r\nare of a uniform pale yellowish-brown. In Damalis albifrons the\r\ncolouring of the head differs from that in the last species in a single\r\nwhite stripe replacing the three stripes, and in the ears being almost\r\nwholly white. (38. See the fine plates in A. Smith’s ‘Zoology of South\r\nAfrica,’ and Dr. Gray’s ‘Gleanings from the Menagerie of Knowsley.’)\r\nAfter having studied to the best of my ability the sexual differences\r\nof animals belonging to all classes, I cannot avoid the conclusion that\r\nthe curiously-arranged colours of many antelopes, though common to both\r\nsexes, are the result of sexual selection primarily applied to the\r\nmale.\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion may perhaps be extended to the tiger, one of the\r\nmost beautiful animals in the world, the sexes of which cannot be\r\ndistinguished by colour, even by the dealers in wild beasts. Mr.\r\nWallace believes (39. ‘Westminster Review,’ July 1, 1867, p. 5.) that\r\nthe striped coat of the tiger “so assimilates with the vertical stems\r\nof the bamboo, as to assist greatly in concealing him from his\r\napproaching prey.” But this view does not appear to me satisfactory. We\r\nhave some slight evidence that his beauty may be due to sexual\r\nselection, for in two species of Felis the analogous marks and colours\r\nare rather brighter in the male than in the female. The zebra is\r\nconspicuously striped, and stripes cannot afford any protection in the\r\nopen plains of South Africa. Burchell (40. ‘Travels in South Africa,’\r\n1824, vol. ii. p. 315.) in describing a herd says, “their sleek ribs\r\nglistened in the sun, and the brightness and regularity of their\r\nstriped coats presented a picture of extraordinary beauty, in which\r\nprobably they are not surpassed by any other quadruped.” But as\r\nthroughout the whole group of the Equidae the sexes are identical in\r\ncolour, we have here no evidence of sexual selection. Nevertheless he\r\nwho attributes the white and dark vertical stripes on the flanks of\r\nvarious antelopes to this process, will probably extend the same view\r\nto the Royal Tiger and beautiful Zebra.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a former chapter that when young animals belonging to\r\nany class follow nearly the same habits of life as their parents, and\r\nyet are coloured in a different manner, it may be inferred that they\r\nhave retained the colouring of some ancient and extinct progenitor. In\r\nthe family of pigs, and in the tapirs, the young are marked with\r\nlongitudinal stripes, and thus differ from all the existing adult\r\nspecies in these two groups. With many kinds of deer the young are\r\nmarked with elegant white spots, of which their parents exhibit not a\r\ntrace. A graduated series can be followed from the axis deer, both\r\nsexes of which at all ages and during all seasons are beautifully\r\nspotted (the male being rather more strongly coloured than the female),\r\nto species in which neither the old nor the young are spotted. I will\r\nspecify some of the steps in this series. The Mantchurian deer (Cervus\r\nmantchuricus) is spotted during the whole year, but, as I have seen in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, the spots are much plainer during the summer,\r\nwhen the general colour of the coat is lighter, than during the winter,\r\nwhen the general colour is darker and the horns are fully developed. In\r\nthe hog-deer (Hyelaphus porcinus) the spots are extremely conspicuous\r\nduring the summer when the coat is reddish-brown, but quite disappear\r\nduring the winter when the coat is brown. (41. Dr. Gray, ‘Gleanings\r\nfrom the Menagerie of Knowsley,’ p. 64. Mr. Blyth, in speaking (‘Land\r\nand Water,’ 1869, p. 42) of the hog-deer of Ceylon, says it is more\r\nbrightly spotted with white than the common hog-deer, at the season\r\nwhen it renews its horns.) In both these species the young are spotted.\r\nIn the Virginian deer the young are likewise spotted, and about five\r\nper cent. of the adult animals living in Judge Caton’s park, as I am\r\ninformed by him, temporarily exhibit at the period when the red summer\r\ncoat is being replaced by the bluish winter coat, a row of spots on\r\neach flank, which are always the same in number, though very variable\r\nin distinctness. From this condition there is but a very small step to\r\nthe complete absence of spots in the adults at all seasons; and,\r\nlastly, to their absence at all ages and seasons, as occurs with\r\ncertain species. From the existence of this perfect series, and more\r\nespecially from the fawns of so many species being spotted, we may\r\nconclude that the now living members of the deer family are the\r\ndescendants of some ancient species which, like the axis deer, was\r\nspotted at all ages and seasons. A still more ancient progenitor\r\nprobably somewhat resembled the Hyomoschus aquaticus—for this animal is\r\nspotted, and the hornless males have large exserted canine teeth, of\r\nwhich some few true deer still retain rudiments. Hyomoschus, also,\r\noffers one of those interesting cases of a form linking together two\r\ngroups, for it is intermediate in certain osteological characters\r\nbetween the pachyderms and ruminants, which were formerly thought to be\r\nquite distinct. (42. Falconer and Cautley, ‘Proc. Geolog. Soc.’ 1843;\r\nand Falconer’s ‘Pal. Memoirs,’ vol. i. p. 196.)\r\n\r\nA curious difficulty here arises. If we admit that coloured spots and\r\nstripes were first acquired as ornaments, how comes it that so many\r\nexisting deer, the descendants of an aboriginally spotted animal, and\r\nall the species of pigs and tapirs, the descendants of an aboriginally\r\nstriped animal, have lost in their adult state their former ornaments?\r\nI cannot satisfactorily answer this question. We may feel almost sure\r\nthat the spots and stripes disappeared at or near maturity in the\r\nprogenitors of our existing species, so that they were still retained\r\nby the young; and, owing to the law of inheritance at corresponding\r\nages, were transmitted to the young of all succeeding generations. It\r\nmay have been a great advantage to the lion and puma, from the open\r\nnature of their usual haunts, to have lost their stripes, and to have\r\nbeen thus rendered less conspicuous to their prey; and if the\r\nsuccessive variations, by which this end was gained, occurred rather\r\nlate in life, the young would have retained their stripes, as is now\r\nthe case. As to deer, pigs, and tapirs, Fritz Müller has suggested to\r\nme that these animals, by the removal of their spots or stripes through\r\nnatural selection, would have been less easily seen by their enemies;\r\nand that they would have especially required this protection, as soon\r\nas the carnivora increased in size and number during the tertiary\r\nperiods. This may be the true explanation, but it is rather strange\r\nthat the young should not have been thus protected, and still more so\r\nthat the adults of some species should have retained their spots,\r\neither partially or completely, during part of the year. We know that,\r\nwhen the domestic ass varies and becomes reddish-brown, grey, or black,\r\nthe stripes on the shoulders and even on the spine frequently\r\ndisappear, though we cannot explain the cause. Very few horses, except\r\ndun-coloured kinds, have stripes on any part of their bodies, yet we\r\nhave good reason to believe that the aboriginal horse was striped on\r\nthe legs and spine, and probably on the shoulders. (43. The ‘Variation\r\nof Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ 1868, vol. i. pp. 61-64.)\r\nHence the disappearance of the spots and stripes in our adult existing\r\ndeer, pigs, and tapirs, may be due to a change in the general colour of\r\ntheir coats; but whether this change was effected through sexual or\r\nnatural selection, or was due to the direct action of the conditions of\r\nlife, or to some other unknown cause, it is impossible to decide. An\r\nobservation made by Mr. Sclater well illustrates our ignorance of the\r\nlaws which regulate the appearance and disappearance of stripes; the\r\nspecies of Asinus which inhabit the Asiatic continent are destitute of\r\nstripes, not having even the cross shoulder-stripe, whilst those which\r\ninhabit Africa are conspicuously striped, with the partial exception of\r\nA. taeniopus, which has only the cross shoulder-stripe and generally\r\nsome faint bars on the legs; and this species inhabits the almost\r\nintermediate region of Upper Egypt and Abyssinia. (44. ‘Proc. Zool.\r\nSoc.’ 1862, p. 164. See, also, Dr. Hartmann, ‘Ann. d. Landw.’ Bd.\r\nxliii. s. 222.)\r\n\r\nQUADRUMANA.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 72. Head of Semnopithecus rubicundus. This and the following\r\nfigures (from Prof. Gervais) are given to shew the odd arrangement and\r\ndevelopment of the hair on the head.\r\n\r\nFig. 73. Head of Semnopithecus comatus.\r\n\r\nFig. 74. Head of Cebus capucinus.\r\n\r\nFig. 75. Head of Ateles marginatus.\r\n\r\nFig. 76. Head of Cebus vellerosus.]\r\n\r\nBefore we conclude, it will be well to add a few remarks on the\r\nornaments of monkeys. In most of the species the sexes resemble each\r\nother in colour, but in some, as we have seen, the males differ from\r\nthe females, especially in the colour of the naked parts of the skin,\r\nin the development of the beard, whiskers, and mane. Many species are\r\ncoloured either in so extraordinary or so beautiful a manner, and are\r\nfurnished with such curious and elegant crests of hair, that we can\r\nhardly avoid looking at these characters as having been gained for the\r\nsake of ornament. The accompanying figures (Figs. 72 to 76) serve to\r\nshew the arrangement of the hair on the face and head in several\r\nspecies. It is scarcely conceivable that these crests of hair, and the\r\nstrongly contrasted colours of the fur and skin, can be the result of\r\nmere variability without the aid of selection; and it is inconceivable\r\nthat they can be of use in any ordinary way to these animals. If so,\r\nthey have probably been gained through sexual selection, though\r\ntransmitted equally, or almost equally, to both sexes. With many of the\r\nQuadrumana, we have additional evidence of the action of sexual\r\nselection in the greater size and strength of the males, and in the\r\ngreater development of their canine teeth, in comparison with the\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 77. Cercopithecus petaurista (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nA few instances will suffice of the strange manner in which both sexes\r\nof some species are coloured, and of the beauty of others. The face of\r\nthe Cercopithecus petaurista (Fig. 77) is black, the whiskers and beard\r\nbeing white, with a defined, round, white spot on the nose, covered\r\nwith short white hair, which gives to the animal an almost ludicrous\r\naspect. The Semnopithecus frontatus likewise has a blackish face with a\r\nlong black beard, and a large naked spot on the forehead of a\r\nbluish-white colour. The face of Macacus lasiotus is dirty\r\nflesh-coloured, with a defined red spot on each cheek. The appearance\r\nof Cercocebus aethiops is grotesque, with its black face, white\r\nwhiskers and collar, chestnut head, and a large naked white spot over\r\neach eyelid. In very many species, the beard, whiskers, and crests of\r\nhair round the face are of a different colour from the rest of the\r\nhead, and when different, are always of a lighter tint (45. I observed\r\nthis fact in the Zoological Gardens; and many cases may be seen in the\r\ncoloured plates in Geoffroy St.-Hilaire and F. Cuvier, ‘Histoire Nat.\r\ndes Mammifères,’ tom. i. 1824.), being often pure white, sometimes\r\nbright yellow, or reddish. The whole face of the South American\r\nBrachyurus calvus is of a “glowing scarlet hue”; but this colour does\r\nnot appear until the animal is nearly mature. (46. Bates, ‘The\r\nNaturalist on the Amazons,’ 1863, vol. ii. p. 310.) The naked skin of\r\nthe face differs wonderfully in colour in the various species. It is\r\noften brown or flesh-colour, with parts perfectly white, and often as\r\nblack as that of the most sooty negro. In the Brachyurus the scarlet\r\ntint is brighter than that of the most blushing Caucasian damsel. It is\r\nsometimes more distinctly orange than in any Mongolian, and in several\r\nspecies it is blue, passing into violet or grey. In all the species\r\nknown to Mr. Bartlett, in which the adults of both sexes have\r\nstrongly-coloured faces, the colours are dull or absent during early\r\nyouth. This likewise holds good with the mandrill and Rhesus, in which\r\nthe face and the posterior parts of the body are brilliantly coloured\r\nin one sex alone. In these latter cases we have reason to believe that\r\nthe colours were acquired through sexual selection; and we are\r\nnaturally led to extend the same view to the foregoing species, though\r\nboth sexes when adult have their faces coloured in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Fig. 78. Cercopithecus diana (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nAlthough many kinds of monkeys are far from beautiful according to our\r\ntaste, other species are universally admired for their elegant\r\nappearance and bright colours. The Semnopithecus nemaeus, though\r\npeculiarly coloured, is described as extremely pretty; the\r\norange-tinted face is surrounded by long whiskers of glossy whiteness,\r\nwith a line of chestnut-red over the eyebrows; the fur on the back is\r\nof a delicate grey, with a square patch on the loins, the tail and the\r\nfore-arms being of a pure white; a gorget of chestnut surmounts the\r\nchest; the thighs are black, with the legs chestnut-red. I will mention\r\nonly two other monkeys for their beauty; and I have selected these as\r\npresenting slight sexual differences in colour, which renders it in\r\nsome degree probable that both sexes owe their elegant appearance to\r\nsexual selection. In the moustache-monkey (Cercopithecus cephus) the\r\ngeneral colour of the fur is mottled-greenish with the throat white; in\r\nthe male the end of the tail is chestnut, but the face is the most\r\nornamented part, the skin being chiefly bluish-grey, shading into a\r\nblackish tint beneath the eyes, with the upper lip of a delicate blue,\r\nclothed on the lower edge with a thin black moustache; the whiskers are\r\norange-coloured, with the upper part black, forming a band which\r\nextends backwards to the ears, the latter being clothed with whitish\r\nhairs. In the Zoological Society’s Gardens I have often overheard\r\nvisitors admiring the beauty of another monkey, deservedly called\r\nCercopithecus diana (Fig. 78); the general colour of the fur is grey;\r\nthe chest and inner surface of the forelegs are white; a large\r\ntriangular defined space on the hinder part of the back is rich\r\nchestnut; in the male the inner sides of the thighs and the abdomen are\r\ndelicate fawn-coloured, and the top of the head is black; the face and\r\nears are intensely black, contrasting finely with a white transverse\r\ncrest over the eyebrows and a long white peaked beard, of which the\r\nbasal portion is black. (47. I have seen most of the above monkeys in\r\nthe Zoological Society’s Gardens. The description of the Semnopithecus\r\nnemaeus is taken from Mr. W.C. Martin’s ‘Natural History of Mammalia,’\r\n1841, p. 460; see also pp. 475, 523.)\r\n\r\nIn these and many other monkeys, the beauty and singular arrangement of\r\ntheir colours, and still more the diversified and elegant arrangement\r\nof the crests and tufts of hair on their heads, force the conviction on\r\nmy mind that these characters have been acquired through sexual\r\nselection exclusively as ornaments.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThe law of battle for the possession of the female appears to prevail\r\nthroughout the whole great class of mammals. Most naturalists will\r\nadmit that the greater size, strength, courage, and pugnacity of the\r\nmale, his special weapons of offence, as well as his special means of\r\ndefence, have been acquired or modified through that form of selection\r\nwhich I have called sexual. This does not depend on any superiority in\r\nthe general struggle for life, but on certain individuals of one sex,\r\ngenerally the male, being successful in conquering other males, and\r\nleaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their superiority than\r\ndo the less successful males.\r\n\r\nThere is another and more peaceful kind of contest, in which the males\r\nendeavour to excite or allure the females by various charms. This is\r\nprobably carried on in some cases by the powerful odours emitted by the\r\nmales during the breeding-season; the odoriferous glands having been\r\nacquired through sexual selection. Whether the same view can be\r\nextended to the voice is doubtful, for the vocal organs of the males\r\nmust have been strengthened by use during maturity, under the powerful\r\nexcitements of love, jealousy or rage, and will consequently have been\r\ntransmitted to the same sex. Various crests, tufts, and mantles of\r\nhair, which are either confined to the male, or are more developed in\r\nthis sex than in the female, seem in most cases to be merely\r\nornamental, though they sometimes serve as a defence against rival\r\nmales. There is even reason to suspect that the branching horns of\r\nstags, and the elegant horns of certain antelopes, though properly\r\nserving as weapons of offence or defence, have been partly modified for\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nWhen the male differs in colour from the female, he generally exhibits\r\ndarker and more strongly-contrasted tints. We do not in this class meet\r\nwith the splendid red, blue, yellow, and green tints, so common with\r\nmale birds and many other animals. The naked parts, however, of certain\r\nQuadrumana must be excepted; for such parts, often oddly situated, are\r\nbrilliantly coloured in some species. The colours of the male in other\r\ncases may be due to simple variation, without the aid of selection. But\r\nwhen the colours are diversified and strongly pronounced, when they are\r\nnot developed until near maturity, and when they are lost after\r\nemasculation, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that they have been\r\nacquired through sexual selection for the sake of ornament, and have\r\nbeen transmitted exclusively, or almost exclusively, to the same sex.\r\nWhen both sexes are coloured in the same manner, and the colours are\r\nconspicuous or curiously arranged, without being of the least apparent\r\nuse as a protection, and especially when they are associated with\r\nvarious other ornamental appendages, we are led by analogy to the same\r\nconclusion, namely, that they have been acquired through sexual\r\nselection, although transmitted to both sexes. That conspicuous and\r\ndiversified colours, whether confined to the males or common to both\r\nsexes, are as a general rule associated in the same groups and\r\nsub-groups with other secondary sexual characters serving for war or\r\nfor ornament, will be found to hold good, if we look back to the\r\nvarious cases given in this and the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, as far\r\nas colour and other ornaments are concerned, has prevailed far more\r\nextensively with mammals than with birds; but weapons, such as horns\r\nand tusks, have often been transmitted either exclusively or much more\r\nperfectly to the males than to the females. This is surprising, for, as\r\nthe males generally use their weapons for defence against enemies of\r\nall kinds, their weapons would have been of service to the females. As\r\nfar as we can see, their absence in this sex can be accounted for only\r\nby the form of inheritance which has prevailed. Finally, with\r\nquadrupeds the contest between the individuals of the same sex, whether\r\npeaceful or bloody, has, with the rarest exceptions, been confined to\r\nthe males; so that the latter have been modified through sexual\r\nselection, far more commonly than the females, either for fighting with\r\neach other or for alluring the opposite sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION IN RELATION TO MAN, AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferences between man and woman—Causes of such differences and of\r\ncertain characters common to both sexes—Law of battle—Differences in\r\nmental powers, and voice—On the influence of beauty in determining the\r\nmarriages of mankind—Attention paid by savages to ornaments—Their ideas\r\nof beauty in woman—The tendency to exaggerate each natural peculiarity.\r\n\r\nWith mankind the differences between the sexes are greater than in most\r\nof the Quadrumana, but not so great as in some, for instance, the\r\nmandrill. Man on an average is considerably taller, heavier, and\r\nstronger than woman, with squarer shoulders and more plainly-pronounced\r\nmuscles. Owing to the relation which exists between muscular\r\ndevelopment and the projection of the brows (1. Schaaffhausen,\r\ntranslation in ‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct. 1868, pp. 419, 420,\r\n427.), the superciliary ridge is generally more marked in man than in\r\nwoman. His body, and especially his face, is more hairy, and his voice\r\nhas a different and more powerful tone. In certain races the women are\r\nsaid to differ slightly in tint from the men. For instance,\r\nSchweinfurth, in speaking of a negress belonging to the Monbuttoos, who\r\ninhabit the interior of Africa a few degrees north of the equator,\r\nsays, “Like all her race, she had a skin several shades lighter than\r\nher husband’s, being something of the colour of half-roasted coffee.”\r\n(2. ‘The Heart of Africa,’ English transl. 1873, vol i. p. 544.) As the\r\nwomen labour in the fields and are quite unclothed, it is not likely\r\nthat they differ in colour from the men owing to less exposure to the\r\nweather. European women are perhaps the brighter coloured of the two\r\nsexes, as may be seen when both have been equally exposed.\r\n\r\nMan is more courageous, pugnacious and energetic than woman, and has a\r\nmore inventive genius. His brain is absolutely larger, but whether or\r\nnot proportionately to his larger body, has not, I believe, been fully\r\nascertained. In woman the face is rounder; the jaws and the base of the\r\nskull smaller; the outlines of the body rounder, in parts more\r\nprominent; and her pelvis is broader than in man (3. Ecker,\r\ntranslation, in ‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct. 1868, pp. 351-356. The\r\ncomparison of the form of the skull in men and women has been followed\r\nout with much care by Welcker.); but this latter character may perhaps\r\nbe considered rather as a primary than a secondary sexual character.\r\nShe comes to maturity at an earlier age than man.\r\n\r\nAs with animals of all classes, so with man, the distinctive characters\r\nof the male sex are not fully developed until he is nearly mature; and\r\nif emasculated they never appear. The beard, for instance, is a\r\nsecondary\r\n\r\nsexual character, and male children are beardless, though at an early\r\nage they have abundant hair on the head. It is probably due to the\r\nrather late appearance in life of the successive variations whereby man\r\nhas acquired his masculine characters, that they are transmitted to the\r\nmale sex alone. Male and female children resemble each other closely,\r\nlike the young of so many other animals in which the adult sexes differ\r\nwidely; they likewise resemble the mature female much more closely than\r\nthe mature male. The female, however, ultimately assumes certain\r\ndistinctive characters, and in the formation of her skull, is said to\r\nbe intermediate between the child and the man. (4. Ecker and Welcker,\r\nibid. pp. 352, 355; Vogt, ‘Lectures on Man,’ Eng. translat. p. 81.)\r\nAgain, as the young of closely allied though distinct species do not\r\ndiffer nearly so much from each other as do the adults, so it is with\r\nthe children of the different races of man. Some have even maintained\r\nthat race-differences cannot be detected in the infantile skull. (5.\r\nSchaaffhausen, ‘Anthropolog. Review,’ ibid. p. 429.) In regard to\r\ncolour, the new-born negro child is reddish nut-brown, which soon\r\nbecomes slaty-grey; the black colour being fully developed within a\r\nyear in the Soudan, but not until three years in Egypt. The eyes of the\r\nnegro are at first blue, and the hair chestnut-brown rather than black,\r\nbeing curled only at the ends. The children of the Australians\r\nimmediately after birth are yellowish-brown, and become dark at a later\r\nage. Those of the Guaranys of Paraguay are whitish-yellow, but they\r\nacquire in the course of a few weeks the yellowish-brown tint of their\r\nparents. Similar observations have been made in other parts of America.\r\n(6. Pruner-Bey, on negro infants as quoted by Vogt, ‘Lectures on Man,’\r\nEng. translat. 1864, p. 189: for further facts on negro infants, as\r\nquoted from Winterbottom and Camper, see Lawrence, ‘Lectures on\r\nPhysiology,’ etc. 1822, p. 451. For the infants of the Guaranys, see\r\nRengger, ‘Säugethiere,’ etc. s. 3. See also Godron, ‘De l’Espèce,’ tom.\r\nii. 1859, p. 253. For the Australians, Waitz, ‘Introduction to\r\nAnthropology,’ Eng. translat. 1863, p. 99.)\r\n\r\nI have specified the foregoing differences between the male and female\r\nsex in mankind, because they are curiously like those of the\r\nQuadrumana. With these animals the female is mature at an earlier age\r\nthan the male; at least this is certainly the case in Cebus azarae. (7.\r\nRengger, ‘Säugethiere,’ etc., 1830, s. 49.) The males of most species\r\nare larger and stronger than the females, of which fact the gorilla\r\naffords a well-known instance. Even in so trifling a character as the\r\ngreater prominence of the superciliary ridge, the males of certain\r\nmonkeys differ from the females (8. As in Macacus cynomolgus\r\n(Desmarest, ‘Mammalogie,’ p. 65), and in Hylobates agilis (Geoffroy\r\nSt.-Hilaire and F. Cuvier, ‘Histoire Nat. des Mammifères,’ 1824, tom.\r\ni. p. 2)., and agree in this respect with mankind. In the gorilla and\r\ncertain other monkeys, the cranium of the adult male presents a\r\nstrongly-marked sagittal crest, which is absent in the female; and\r\nEcker found a trace of a similar difference between the two sexes in\r\nthe Australians. (9. ‘Anthropological Review,’ Oct. 1868, p. 353.) With\r\nmonkeys when there is any difference in the voice, that of the male is\r\nthe more powerful. We have seen that certain male monkeys have a\r\nwell-developed beard, which is quite deficient, or much less developed\r\nin the female. No instance is known of the beard, whiskers, or\r\nmoustache being larger in the female than in the male monkey. Even in\r\nthe colour of the beard there is a curious parallelism between man and\r\nthe Quadrumana, for with man when the beard differs in colour from the\r\nhair of the head, as is commonly the case, it is, I believe, almost\r\nalways of a lighter tint, being often reddish. I have repeatedly\r\nobserved this fact in England; but two gentlemen have lately written to\r\nme, saying that they form an exception to the rule. One of these\r\ngentlemen accounts for the fact by the wide difference in colour of the\r\nhair on the paternal and maternal sides of his family. Both had been\r\nlong aware of this peculiarity (one of them having often been accused\r\nof dyeing his beard), and had been thus led to observe other men, and\r\nwere convinced that the exceptions were very rare. Dr. Hooker attended\r\nto this little point for me in Russia, and found no exception to the\r\nrule. In Calcutta, Mr. J. Scott, of the Botanic Gardens, was so kind as\r\nto observe the many races of men to be seen there, as well as in some\r\nother parts of India, namely, two races of Sikhim, the Bhoteas,\r\nHindoos, Burmese, and Chinese, most of which races have very little\r\nhair on the face; and he always found that when there was any\r\ndifference in colour between the hair of the head and the beard, the\r\nlatter was invariably lighter. Now with monkeys, as has already been\r\nstated, the beard frequently differs strikingly in colour from the hair\r\nof the head, and in such cases it is always of a lighter hue, being\r\noften pure white, sometimes yellow or reddish. (10. Mr. Blyth informs\r\nme that he has only seen one instance of the beard, whiskers, etc., in\r\na monkey becoming white with old age, as is so commonly the case with\r\nus. This, however, occurred in an aged Macacus cynomolgus, kept in\r\nconfinement whose moustaches were “remarkably long and human-like.”\r\nAltogether this old monkey presented a ludicrous resemblance to one of\r\nthe reigning monarchs of Europe, after whom he was universally\r\nnick-named. In certain races of man the hair on the head hardly ever\r\nbecomes grey; thus Mr. D. Forbes has never, as he informs me, seen an\r\ninstance with the Aymaras and Quichuas of South America.)\r\n\r\nIn regard to the general hairiness of the body, the women in all races\r\nare less hairy than the men; and in some few Quadrumana the under side\r\nof the body of the female is less hairy than that of the male. (11.\r\nThis is the case with the females of several species of Hylobates; see\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire and F. Cuvier, ‘Hist. Nat. des Mamm.’ tom. i. See\r\nalso, on H. lar, ‘Penny Cyclopedia,’ vol. ii. pp. 149, 150.) Lastly,\r\nmale monkeys, like men, are bolder and fiercer than the females. They\r\nlead the troop, and when there is danger, come to the front. We thus\r\nsee how close is the parallelism between the sexual differences of man\r\nand the Quadrumana. With some few species, however, as with certain\r\nbaboons, the orang and the gorilla, there is a considerably greater\r\ndifference between the sexes, as in the size of the canine teeth, in\r\nthe development and colour of the hair, and especially in the colour of\r\nthe naked parts of the skin, than in mankind.\r\n\r\nAll the secondary sexual characters of man are highly variable, even\r\nwithin the limits of the same race; and they differ much in the several\r\nraces. These two rules hold good generally throughout the animal\r\nkingdom. In the excellent observations made on board the Novara (12.\r\nThe results were deduced by Dr. Weisbach from the measurements made by\r\nDrs. K. Scherzer and Schwarz, see ‘Reise der Novara: Anthropolog.\r\nTheil,’ 1867, ss. 216, 231, 234, 236, 239, 269.), the male Australians\r\nwere found to exceed the females by only 65 millim. in height, whilst\r\nwith the Javans the average excess was 218 millim.; so that in this\r\nlatter race the difference in height between the sexes is more than\r\nthrice as great as with the Australians. Numerous measurements were\r\ncarefully made of the stature, the circumference of the neck and chest,\r\nthe length of the back-bone and of the arms, in various races; and\r\nnearly all these measurements shew that the males differ much more from\r\none another than do the females. This fact indicates that, as far as\r\nthese characters are concerned, it is the male which has been chiefly\r\nmodified, since the several races diverged from their common stock.\r\n\r\nThe development of the beard and the hairiness of the body differ\r\nremarkably in the men of distinct races, and even in different tribes\r\nor families of the same race. We Europeans see this amongst ourselves.\r\nIn the Island of St. Kilda, according to Martin (13. ‘Voyage to St.\r\nKilda’ (3rd ed. 1753), p. 37.), the men do not acquire beards until the\r\nage of thirty or upwards, and even then the beards are very thin. On\r\nthe Europaeo-Asiatic continent, beards prevail until we pass beyond\r\nIndia; though with the natives of Ceylon they are often absent, as was\r\nnoticed in ancient times by Diodorus. (14. Sir J.E. Tennent, ‘Ceylon,’\r\nvol. ii. 1859, p. 107.) Eastward of India beards disappear, as with the\r\nSiamese, Malays, Kalmucks, Chinese, and Japanese; nevertheless, the\r\nAinos (15. Quatrefages, ‘Revue des Cours Scientifiques,’ Aug. 29, 1868,\r\np. 630; Vogt, ‘Lectures on Man,’ Eng. trans. p. 127.), who inhabit the\r\nnorthernmost islands of the Japan Archipelago, are the hairiest men in\r\nthe world. With negroes the beard is scanty or wanting, and they rarely\r\nhave whiskers; in both sexes the body is frequently almost destitute of\r\nfine down. (16. On the beards of negroes, Vogt, ‘Lectures,’ etc. p.\r\n127; Waitz, ‘Introduct. to Anthropology,’ Engl. translat. 1863, vol. i.\r\np. 96. It is remarkable that in the United States (‘Investigations in\r\nMilitary and Anthropological Statistics of American Soldiers,’ 1869, p.\r\n569) the pure negroes and their crossed offspring seem to have bodies\r\nalmost as hairy as Europeans.) On the other hand, the Papuans of the\r\nMalay Archipelago, who are nearly as black as negroes, possess\r\nwell-developed beards. (17. Wallace, ‘The Malay Arch.’ vol. ii. 1869,\r\np. 178.) In the Pacific Ocean the inhabitants of the Fiji Archipelago\r\nhave large bushy beards, whilst those of the not distant archipelagoes\r\nof Tonga and Samoa are beardless; but these men belong to distinct\r\nraces. In the Ellice group all the inhabitants belong to the same race;\r\nyet on one island alone, namely Nunemaya, “the men have splendid\r\nbeards”; whilst on the other islands “they have, as a rule, a dozen\r\nstraggling hairs for a beard.” (18. Dr. J. Barnard Davis on Oceanic\r\nRaces, in ‘Anthropological Review,’ April 1870, pp. 185, 191.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the great American continent the men may be said to be\r\nbeardless; but in almost all the tribes a few short hairs are apt to\r\nappear on the face, especially in old age. With the tribes of North\r\nAmerica, Catlin estimates that eighteen out of twenty men are\r\ncompletely destitute by nature of a beard; but occasionally there may\r\nbe seen a man, who has neglected to pluck out the hairs at puberty,\r\nwith a soft beard an inch or two in length. The Guaranys of Paraguay\r\ndiffer from all the surrounding tribes in having a small beard, and\r\neven some hair on the body, but no whiskers. (19. Catlin, ‘North\r\nAmerican Indians,’ 3rd. ed. 1842, vol. ii. p. 227. On the Guaranys, see\r\nAzara, ‘Voyages dans l’Amérique Merid.’ tom. ii. 1809, p. 85; also\r\nRengger, ‘Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ s. 3.) I am informed by Mr. D.\r\nForbes, who particularly attended to this point, that the Aymaras and\r\nQuichuas of the Cordillera are remarkably hairless, yet in old age a\r\nfew straggling hairs occasionally appear on the chin. The men of these\r\ntwo tribes have very little hair on the various parts of the body where\r\nhair grows abundantly in Europeans, and the women have none on the\r\ncorresponding parts. The hair on the head, however, attains an\r\nextraordinary length in both sexes, often reaching almost to the\r\nground; and this is likewise the case with some of the N. American\r\ntribes. In the amount of hair, and in the general shape of the body,\r\nthe sexes of the American aborigines do not differ so much from each\r\nother, as in most other races. (20. Prof. and Mrs. Agassiz (‘Journey in\r\nBrazil,’ p. 530) remark that the sexes of the American Indians differ\r\nless than those of the negroes and of the higher races. See also\r\nRengger, ibid. p. 3, on the Guaranys.) This fact is analogous with what\r\noccurs with some closely allied monkeys; thus the sexes of the\r\nchimpanzee are not as different as those of the orang or gorilla. (21.\r\nRutimeyer, ‘Die Grenzen der Thierwelt; eine Betrachtung zu Darwin’s\r\nLehre,’ 1868, s. 54.)\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters we have seen that with mammals, birds, fishes,\r\ninsects, etc., many characters, which there is every reason to believe\r\nwere primarily gained through sexual selection by one sex, have been\r\ntransferred to the other. As this same form of transmission has\r\napparently prevailed much with mankind, it will save useless repetition\r\nif we discuss the origin of characters peculiar to the male sex\r\ntogether with certain other characters common to both sexes.\r\n\r\nLAW OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\nWith savages, for instance, the Australians, the women are the constant\r\ncause of war both between members of the same tribe and between\r\ndistinct tribes. So no doubt it was in ancient times; “nam fuit ante\r\nHelenam mulier teterrima belli causa.” With some of the North American\r\nIndians, the contest is reduced to a system. That excellent observer,\r\nHearne (22. ‘A Journey from Prince of Wales Fort,’ 8vo. ed. Dublin,\r\n1796, p. 104. Sir J. Lubbock (‘Origin of Civilisation,’ 1870, p. 69)\r\ngives other and similar cases in North America. For the Guanas of South\r\nAmerica see Azara, ‘Voyages,’ etc. tom. ii. p. 94.), says:—“It has ever\r\nbeen the custom among these people for the men to wrestle for any woman\r\nto whom they are attached; and, of course, the strongest party always\r\ncarries off the prize. A weak man, unless he be a good hunter, and\r\nwell-beloved, is seldom permitted to keep a wife that a stronger man\r\nthinks worth his notice. This custom prevails throughout all the\r\ntribes, and causes a great spirit of emulation among their youth, who\r\nare upon all occasions, from their childhood, trying their strength and\r\nskill in wrestling.” With the Guanas of South America, Azara states\r\nthat the men rarely marry till twenty years old or more, as before that\r\nage they cannot conquer their rivals.\r\n\r\nOther similar facts could be given; but even if we had no evidence on\r\nthis head, we might feel almost sure, from the analogy of the higher\r\nQuadrumana (23. On the fighting of the male gorillas, see Dr. Savage,\r\nin ‘Boston Journal of Natural History,’ vol. v. 1847, p. 423. On\r\nPresbytis entellus, see the ‘Indian Field,’ 1859, p. 146.), that the\r\nlaw of battle had prevailed with man during the early stages of his\r\ndevelopment. The occasional appearance at the present day of canine\r\nteeth which project above the others, with traces of a diastema or open\r\nspace for the reception of the opposite canines, is in all probability\r\na case of reversion to a former state, when the progenitors of man were\r\nprovided with these weapons, like so many existing male Quadrumana. It\r\nwas remarked in a former chapter that as man gradually became erect,\r\nand continually used his hands and arms for fighting with sticks and\r\nstones, as well as for the other purposes of life, he would have used\r\nhis jaws and teeth less and less. The jaws, together with their\r\nmuscles, would then have been reduced through disuse, as would the\r\nteeth through the not well understood principles of correlation and\r\neconomy of growth; for we everywhere see that parts, which are no\r\nlonger of service, are reduced in size. By such steps the original\r\ninequality between the jaws and teeth in the two sexes of mankind would\r\nultimately have been obliterated. The case is almost parallel with that\r\nof many male Ruminants, in which the canine teeth have been reduced to\r\nmere rudiments, or have disappeared, apparently in consequence of the\r\ndevelopment of horns. As the prodigious difference between the skulls\r\nof the two sexes in the orang and gorilla stands in close relation with\r\nthe development of the immense canine teeth in the males, we may infer\r\nthat the reduction of the jaws and teeth in the early male progenitors\r\nof man must have led to a most striking and favourable change in his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the greater size and strength of man, in\r\ncomparison with woman, together with his broader shoulders, more\r\ndeveloped muscles, rugged outline of body, his greater courage and\r\npugnacity, are all due in chief part to inheritance from his half-human\r\nmale ancestors. These characters would, however, have been preserved or\r\neven augmented during the long ages of man’s savagery, by the success\r\nof the strongest and boldest men, both in the general struggle for life\r\nand in their contests for wives; a success which would have ensured\r\ntheir leaving a more numerous progeny than their less favoured\r\nbrethren. It is not probable that the greater strength of man was\r\nprimarily acquired through the inherited effects of his having worked\r\nharder than woman for his own subsistence and that of his family; for\r\nthe women in all barbarous nations are compelled to work at least as\r\nhard as the men. With civilised people the arbitrament of battle for\r\nthe possession of the women has long ceased; on the other hand, the\r\nmen, as a general rule, have to work harder than the women for their\r\njoint subsistence, and thus their greater strength will have been kept\r\nup.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE IN THE MENTAL POWERS OF THE TWO SEXES.\r\n\r\nWith respect to differences of this nature between man and woman, it is\r\nprobable that sexual selection has played a highly important part. I am\r\naware that some writers doubt whether there is any such inherent\r\ndifference; but this is at least probable from the analogy of the lower\r\nanimals which present other secondary sexual characters. No one\r\ndisputes that the bull differs in disposition from the cow, the\r\nwild-boar from the sow, the stallion from the mare, and, as is well\r\nknown to the keepers of menageries, the males of the larger apes from\r\nthe females. Woman seems to differ from man in mental disposition,\r\nchiefly in her greater tenderness and less selfishness; and this holds\r\ngood even with savages, as shewn by a well-known passage in Mungo\r\nPark’s Travels, and by statements made by many other travellers. Woman,\r\nowing to her maternal instincts, displays these qualities towards her\r\ninfants in an eminent degree; therefore it is likely that she would\r\noften extend them towards her fellow-creatures. Man is the rival of\r\nother men; he delights in competition, and this leads to ambition which\r\npasses too easily into selfishness. These latter qualities seem to be\r\nhis natural and unfortunate birthright. It is generally admitted that\r\nwith woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of\r\nimitation, are more strongly marked than in man; but some, at least, of\r\nthese faculties are characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of\r\na past and lower state of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is\r\nshewn by man’s attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up,\r\nthan can woman—whether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination,\r\nor merely the use of the senses and hands. If two lists were made of\r\nthe most eminent men and women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music\r\n(inclusive both of composition and performance), history, science, and\r\nphilosophy, with half-a-dozen names under each subject, the two lists\r\nwould not bear comparison. We may also infer, from the law of the\r\ndeviation from averages, so well illustrated by Mr. Galton, in his work\r\non ‘Hereditary Genius,’ that if men are capable of a decided\r\npre-eminence over women in many subjects, the average of mental power\r\nin man must be above that of woman.\r\n\r\nAmongst the half-human progenitors of man, and amongst savages, there\r\nhave been struggles between the males during many generations for the\r\npossession of the females. But mere bodily strength and size would do\r\nlittle for victory, unless associated with courage, perseverance, and\r\ndetermined energy. With social animals, the young males have to pass\r\nthrough many a contest before they win a female, and the older males\r\nhave to retain their females by renewed battles. They have, also, in\r\nthe case of mankind, to defend their females, as well as their young,\r\nfrom enemies of all kinds, and to hunt for their joint subsistence. But\r\nto avoid enemies or to attack them with success, to capture wild\r\nanimals, and to fashion weapons, requires the aid of the higher mental\r\nfaculties, namely, observation, reason, invention, or imagination.\r\nThese various faculties will thus have been continually put to the test\r\nand selected during manhood; they will, moreover, have been\r\nstrengthened by use during this same period of life. Consequently in\r\naccordance with the principle often alluded to, we might expect that\r\nthey would at least tend to be transmitted chiefly to the male\r\noffspring at the corresponding period of manhood.\r\n\r\nNow, when two men are put into competition, or a man with a woman, both\r\npossessed of every mental quality in equal perfection, save that one\r\nhas higher energy, perseverance, and courage, the latter will generally\r\nbecome more eminent in every pursuit, and will gain the ascendancy.\r\n(24. J. Stuart Mill remarks (‘The Subjection of Women,’ 1869, p. 122),\r\n“The things in which man most excels woman are those which require most\r\nplodding, and long hammering at single thoughts.” What is this but\r\nenergy and perseverance?) He may be said to possess genius—for genius\r\nhas been declared by a great authority to be patience; and patience, in\r\nthis sense, means unflinching, undaunted perseverance. But this view of\r\ngenius is perhaps deficient; for without the higher powers of the\r\nimagination and reason, no eminent success can be gained in many\r\nsubjects. These latter faculties, as well as the former, will have been\r\ndeveloped in man, partly through sexual selection,—that is, through the\r\ncontest of rival males, and partly through natural selection, that is,\r\nfrom success in the general struggle for life; and as in both cases the\r\nstruggle will have been during maturity, the characters gained will\r\nhave been transmitted more fully to the male than to the female\r\noffspring. It accords in a striking manner with this view of the\r\nmodification and re-inforcement of many of our mental faculties by\r\nsexual selection, that, firstly, they notoriously undergo a\r\nconsiderable change at puberty (25. Maudsley, ‘Mind and Body,’ p. 31.),\r\nand, secondly, that eunuchs remain throughout life inferior in these\r\nsame qualities. Thus, man has ultimately become superior to woman. It\r\nis, indeed, fortunate that the law of the equal transmission of\r\ncharacters to both sexes prevails with mammals; otherwise, it is\r\nprobable that man would have become as superior in mental endowment to\r\nwoman, as the peacock is in ornamental plumage to the peahen.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the tendency in characters acquired by\r\neither sex late in life, to be transmitted to the same sex at the same\r\nage, and of early acquired characters to be transmitted to both sexes,\r\nare rules which, though general, do not always hold. If they always\r\nheld good, we might conclude (but I here exceed my proper bounds) that\r\nthe inherited effects of the early education of boys and girls would be\r\ntransmitted equally to both sexes; so that the present inequality in\r\nmental power between the sexes would not be effaced by a similar course\r\nof early training; nor can it have been caused by their dissimilar\r\nearly training. In order that woman should reach the same standard as\r\nman, she ought, when nearly adult, to be trained to energy and\r\nperseverance, and to have her reason and imagination exercised to the\r\nhighest point; and then she would probably transmit these qualities\r\nchiefly to her adult daughters. All women, however, could not be thus\r\nraised, unless during many generations those who excelled in the above\r\nrobust virtues were married, and produced offspring in larger numbers\r\nthan other women. As before remarked of bodily strength, although men\r\ndo not now fight for their wives, and this form of selection has passed\r\naway, yet during manhood, they generally undergo a severe struggle in\r\norder to maintain themselves and their families; and this will tend to\r\nkeep up or even increase their mental powers, and, as a consequence,\r\nthe present inequality between the sexes. (26. An observation by Vogt\r\nbears on this subject: he says, “It is a remarkable circumstance, that\r\nthe difference between the sexes, as regards the cranial cavity,\r\nincreases with the development of the race, so that the male European\r\nexcels much more the female, than the negro the negress. Welcker\r\nconfirms this statement of Huschke from his measurements of negro and\r\nGerman skulls.” But Vogt admits (‘Lectures on Man,’ Eng. translat.\r\n1864, p. 81) that more observations are requisite on this point.\r\n\r\nVOICE AND MUSICAL POWERS.\r\n\r\nIn some species of Quadrumana there is a great difference between the\r\nadult sexes, in the power of their voices and in the development of the\r\nvocal organs; and man appears to have inherited this difference from\r\nhis early progenitors. His vocal cords are about one-third longer than\r\nin woman, or than in boys; and emasculation produces the same effect on\r\nhim as on the lower animals, for it “arrests that prominent growth of\r\nthe thyroid, etc., which accompanies the elongation of the cords.” (27.\r\nOwen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 603.) With respect to the\r\ncause of this difference between the sexes, I have nothing to add to\r\nthe remarks in the last chapter on the probable effects of the\r\nlong-continued use of the vocal organs by the male under the excitement\r\nof love, rage and jealousy. According to Sir Duncan Gibb (28. ‘Journal\r\nof the Anthropological Society,’ April 1869, p. lvii. and lxvi.), the\r\nvoice and the form of the larynx differ in the different races of\r\nmankind; but with the Tartars, Chinese, etc., the voice of the male is\r\nsaid not to differ so much from that of the female, as in most other\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nThe capacity and love for singing or music, though not a sexual\r\ncharacter in man, must not here be passed over. Although the sounds\r\nemitted by animals of all kinds serve many purposes, a strong case can\r\nbe made out, that the vocal organs were primarily used and perfected in\r\nrelation to the propagation of the species. Insects and some few\r\nspiders are the lowest animals which voluntarily produce any sound; and\r\nthis is generally effected by the aid of beautifully constructed\r\nstridulating organs, which are often confined to the males. The sounds\r\nthus produced consist, I believe in all cases, of the same note,\r\nrepeated rhythmically (29. Dr. Scudder, ‘Notes on Stridulation,’ in\r\n‘Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. xi. April 1868.); and this is\r\nsometimes pleasing even to the ears of man. The chief and, in some\r\ncases, exclusive purpose appears to be either to call or charm the\r\nopposite sex.\r\n\r\nThe sounds produced by fishes are said in some cases to be made only by\r\nthe males during the breeding-season. All the air-breathing Vertebrata\r\nnecessarily possess an apparatus for inhaling and expelling air, with a\r\npipe capable of being closed at one end. Hence when the primeval\r\nmembers of this class were strongly excited and their muscles violently\r\ncontracted, purposeless sounds would almost certainly have been\r\nproduced; and these, if they proved in any way serviceable, might\r\nreadily have been modified or intensified by the preservation of\r\nproperly adapted variations. The lowest Vertebrates which breathe air\r\nare Amphibians; and of these, frogs and toads possess vocal organs,\r\nwhich are incessantly used during the breeding-season, and which are\r\noften more highly developed in the male than in the female. The male\r\nalone of the tortoise utters a noise, and this only during the season\r\nof love. Male alligators roar or bellow during the same season. Every\r\none knows how much birds use their vocal organs as a means of\r\ncourtship; and some species likewise perform what may be called\r\ninstrumental music.\r\n\r\nIn the class of Mammals, with which we are here more particularly\r\nconcerned, the males of almost all the species use their voices during\r\nthe breeding-season much more than at any other time; and some are\r\nabsolutely mute excepting at this season. With other species both\r\nsexes, or only the females, use their voices as a love-call.\r\nConsidering these facts, and that the vocal organs of some quadrupeds\r\nare much more largely developed in the male than in the female, either\r\npermanently or temporarily during the breeding-season; and considering\r\nthat in most of the lower classes the sounds produced by the males,\r\nserve not only to call but to excite or allure the female, it is a\r\nsurprising fact that we have not as yet any good evidence that these\r\norgans are used by male mammals to charm the females. The American\r\nMycetes caraya perhaps forms an exception, as does the Hylobates\r\nagilis, an ape allied to man. This gibbon has an extremely loud but\r\nmusical voice. Mr. Waterhouse states (30. Given in W.C.L. Martin’s\r\n‘General Introduction to Natural History of Mamm. Animals,’ 1841, p.\r\n432; Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii, p. 600.), “It appeared\r\nto me that in ascending and descending the scale, the intervals were\r\nalways exactly half-tones; and I am sure that the highest note was the\r\nexact octave to the lowest. The quality of the notes is very musical;\r\nand I do not doubt that a good violinist would be able to give a\r\ncorrect idea of the gibbon’s composition, excepting as regards its\r\nloudness.” Mr. Waterhouse then gives the notes. Professor Owen, who is\r\na musician, confirms the foregoing statement, and remarks, though\r\nerroneously, that this gibbon “alone of brute mammals may be said to\r\nsing.” It appears to be much excited after its performance.\r\nUnfortunately, its habits have never been closely observed in a state\r\nof nature; but from the analogy of other animals, it is probable that\r\nit uses its musical powers more especially during the season of\r\ncourtship.\r\n\r\nThis gibbon is not the only species in the genus which sings, for my\r\nson, Francis Darwin, attentively listened in the Zoological Gardens to\r\nH. leuciscus whilst singing a cadence of three notes, in true musical\r\nintervals and with a clear musical tone. It is a more surprising fact\r\nthat certain rodents utter musical sounds. Singing mice have often been\r\nmentioned and exhibited, but imposture has commonly been suspected. We\r\nhave, however, at last a clear account by a well-known observer, the\r\nRev. S. Lockwood (31. The ‘American Naturalist,’ 1871, p. 761.), of the\r\nmusical powers of an American species, the Hesperomys cognatus,\r\nbelonging to a genus distinct from that of the English mouse. This\r\nlittle animal was kept in confinement, and the performance was\r\nrepeatedly heard. In one of the two chief songs, “the last bar would\r\nfrequently be prolonged to two or three; and she would sometimes change\r\nfrom C sharp and D, to C natural and D, then warble on these two notes\r\nawhile, and wind up with a quick chirp on C sharp and D. The\r\ndistinctness between the semitones was very marked, and easily\r\nappreciable to a good ear.” Mr. Lockwood gives both songs in musical\r\nnotation; and adds that though this little mouse “had no ear for time,\r\nyet she would keep to the key of B (two flats) and strictly in a major\r\nkey.”...”Her soft clear voice falls an octave with all the precision\r\npossible; then at the wind up, it rises again into a very quick trill\r\non C sharp and D.”\r\n\r\nA critic has asked how the ears of man, and he ought to have added of\r\nother animals, could have been adapted by selection so as to\r\ndistinguish musical notes. But this question shews some confusion on\r\nthe subject; a noise is the sensation resulting from the co-existence\r\nof several aerial “simple vibrations” of various periods, each of which\r\nintermits so frequently that its separate existence cannot be\r\nperceived. It is only in the want of continuity of such vibrations, and\r\nin their want of harmony inter se, that a noise differs from a musical\r\nnote. Thus an ear to be capable of discriminating noises—and the high\r\nimportance of this power to all animals is admitted by every one—must\r\nbe sensitive to musical notes. We have evidence of this capacity even\r\nlow down in the animal scale: thus Crustaceans are provided with\r\nauditory hairs of different lengths, which have been seen to vibrate\r\nwhen the proper musical notes are struck. (32. Helmholtz, ‘Theorie\r\nPhys. de la Musique,’ 1868, p. 187.) As stated in a previous chapter,\r\nsimilar observations have been made on the hairs of the antennae of\r\ngnats. It has been positively asserted by good observers that spiders\r\nare attracted by music. It is also well known that some dogs howl when\r\nhearing particular tones. (33. Several accounts have been published to\r\nthis effect. Mr. Peach writes to me that an old dog of his howls when B\r\nflat is sounded on the flute, and to no other note. I may add another\r\ninstance of a dog always whining, when one note on a concertina, which\r\nwas out of tune, was played.) Seals apparently appreciate music, and\r\ntheir fondness for it “was well known to the ancients, and is often\r\ntaken advantage of by the hunters at the present day.” (34. Mr. R.\r\nBrown, in ‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1868, p. 410.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, as far as the mere perception of musical notes is concerned,\r\nthere seems no special difficulty in the case of man or of any other\r\nanimal. Helmholtz has explained on physiological principles why\r\nconcords are agreeable, and discords disagreeable to the human ear; but\r\nwe are little concerned with these, as music in harmony is a late\r\ninvention. We are more concerned with melody, and here again, according\r\nto Helmholtz, it is intelligible why the notes of our musical scale are\r\nused. The ear analyses all sounds into their component “simple\r\nvibrations,” although we are not conscious of this analysis. In a\r\nmusical note the lowest in pitch of these is generally predominant, and\r\nthe others which are less marked are the octave, the twelfth, the\r\nsecond octave, etc., all harmonies of the fundamental predominant note;\r\nany two notes of our scale have many of these harmonic over-tones in\r\ncommon. It seems pretty clear then, that if an animal always wished to\r\nsing precisely the same song, he would guide himself by sounding those\r\nnotes in succession, which possess many over-tones in common—that is,\r\nhe would choose for his song, notes which belong to our musical scale.\r\n\r\nBut if it be further asked why musical tones in a certain order and\r\nrhythm give man and other animals pleasure, we can no more give the\r\nreason than for the pleasantness of certain tastes and smells. That\r\nthey do give pleasure of some kind to animals, we may infer from their\r\nbeing produced during the season of courtship by many insects, spiders,\r\nfishes, amphibians, and birds; for unless the females were able to\r\nappreciate such sounds and were excited or charmed by them, the\r\npersevering efforts of the males, and the complex structures often\r\npossessed by them alone, would be useless; and this it is impossible to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nHuman song is generally admitted to be the basis or origin of\r\ninstrumental music. As neither the enjoyment nor the capacity of\r\nproducing musical notes are faculties of the least use to man in\r\nreference to his daily habits of life, they must be ranked amongst the\r\nmost mysterious with which he is endowed. They are present, though in a\r\nvery rude condition, in men of all races, even the most savage; but so\r\ndifferent is the taste of the several races, that our music gives no\r\npleasure to savages, and their music is to us in most cases hideous and\r\nunmeaning. Dr. Seemann, in some interesting remarks on this subject\r\n(35. ‘Journal of Anthropological Society,’ Oct. 1870, p. clv. See also\r\nthe several later chapters in Sir John Lubbock’s ‘Prehistoric Times,’\r\n2nd ed. 1869, which contain an admirable account of the habits of\r\nsavages.), “doubts whether even amongst the nations of Western Europe,\r\nintimately connected as they are by close and frequent intercourse, the\r\nmusic of the one is interpreted in the same sense by the others. By\r\ntravelling eastwards we find that there is certainly a different\r\nlanguage of music. Songs of joy and dance-accompaniments are no longer,\r\nas with us, in the major keys, but always in the minor.” Whether or not\r\nthe half-human progenitors of man possessed, like the singing gibbons,\r\nthe capacity of producing, and therefore no doubt of appreciating,\r\nmusical notes, we know that man possessed these faculties at a very\r\nremote period. M. Lartet has described two flutes made out of the bones\r\nand horns of the reindeer, found in caves together with flint tools and\r\nthe remains of extinct animals. The arts of singing and of dancing are\r\nalso very ancient, and are now practised by all or nearly all the\r\nlowest races of man. Poetry, which may be considered as the offspring\r\nof song, is likewise so ancient, that many persons have felt astonished\r\nthat it should have arisen during the earliest ages of which we have\r\nany record.\r\n\r\nWe see that the musical faculties, which are not wholly deficient in\r\nany race, are capable of prompt and high development, for Hottentots\r\nand Negroes have become excellent musicians, although in their native\r\ncountries they rarely practise anything that we should consider music.\r\nSchweinfurth, however, was pleased with some of the simple melodies\r\nwhich he heard in the interior of Africa. But there is nothing\r\nanomalous in the musical faculties lying dormant in man: some species\r\nof birds which never naturally sing, can without much difficulty be\r\ntaught to do so; thus a house-sparrow has learnt the song of a linnet.\r\nAs these two species are closely allied, and belong to the order of\r\nInsessores, which includes nearly all the singing-birds in the world,\r\nit is possible that a progenitor of the sparrow may have been a\r\nsongster. It is more remarkable that parrots, belonging to a group\r\ndistinct from the Insessores, and having differently constructed vocal\r\norgans, can be taught not only to speak, but to pipe or whistle tunes\r\ninvented by man, so that they must have some musical capacity.\r\nNevertheless it would be very rash to assume that parrots are descended\r\nfrom some ancient form which was a songster. Many cases could be\r\nadvanced of organs and instincts originally adapted for one purpose,\r\nhaving been utilised for some distinct purpose. (36. Since this chapter\r\nwas printed, I have seen a valuable article by Mr. Chauncey Wright\r\n(‘North American Review,’ Oct. 1870, page 293), who, in discussing the\r\nabove subject, remarks, “There are many consequences of the ultimate\r\nlaws or uniformities of nature, through which the acquisition of one\r\nuseful power will bring with it many resulting advantages as well as\r\nlimiting disadvantages, actual or possible, which the principle of\r\nutility may not have comprehended in its action.” As I have attempted\r\nto shew in an early chapter of this work, this principle has an\r\nimportant bearing on the acquisition by man of some of his mental\r\ncharacteristics.) Hence the capacity for high musical development which\r\nthe savage races of man possess, may be due either to the practice by\r\nour semi-human progenitors of some rude form of music, or simply to\r\ntheir having acquired the proper vocal organs for a different purpose.\r\nBut in this latter case we must assume, as in the above instance of\r\nparrots, and as seems to occur with many animals, that they already\r\npossessed some sense of melody.\r\n\r\nMusic arouses in us various emotions, but not the more terrible ones of\r\nhorror, fear, rage, etc. It awakens the gentler feelings of tenderness\r\nand love, which readily pass into devotion. In the Chinese annals it is\r\nsaid, “Music hath the power of making heaven descend upon earth.” It\r\nlikewise stirs up in us the sense of triumph and the glorious ardour\r\nfor war. These powerful and mingled feelings may well give rise to the\r\nsense of sublimity. We can concentrate, as Dr. Seemann observes,\r\ngreater intensity of feeling in a single musical note than in pages of\r\nwriting. It is probable that nearly the same emotions, but much weaker\r\nand far less complex, are felt by birds when the male pours forth his\r\nfull volume of song, in rivalry with other males, to captivate the\r\nfemale. Love is still the commonest theme of our songs. As Herbert\r\nSpencer remarks, “music arouses dormant sentiments of which we had not\r\nconceived the possibility, and do not know the meaning; or, as Richter\r\nsays, tells us of things we have not seen and shall not see.”\r\nConversely, when vivid emotions are felt and expressed by the orator,\r\nor even in common speech, musical cadences and rhythm are instinctively\r\nused. The negro in Africa when excited often bursts forth in song;\r\n“another will reply in song, whilst the company, as if touched by a\r\nmusical wave, murmur a chorus in perfect unison.” (37. Winwood Reade,\r\n‘The Martyrdom of Man,’ 1872, p. 441, and ‘African Sketch Book,’ 1873,\r\nvol. ii. p. 313.) Even monkeys express strong feelings in different\r\ntones—anger and impatience by low,—fear and pain by high notes. (38.\r\nRengger, ‘Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ s. 49.) The sensations and ideas\r\nthus excited in us by music, or expressed by the cadences of oratory,\r\nappear from their vagueness, yet depth, like mental reversions to the\r\nemotions and thoughts of a long-past age.\r\n\r\nAll these facts with respect to music and impassioned speech become\r\nintelligible to a certain extent, if we may assume that musical tones\r\nand rhythm were used by our half-human ancestors, during the season of\r\ncourtship, when animals of all kinds are excited not only by love, but\r\nby the strong passions of jealousy, rivalry, and triumph. From the\r\ndeeply-laid principle of inherited associations, musical tones in this\r\ncase would be likely to call up vaguely and indefinitely the strong\r\nemotions of a long-past age. As we have every reason to suppose that\r\narticulate speech is one of the latest, as it certainly is the highest,\r\nof the arts acquired by man, and as the instinctive power of producing\r\nmusical notes and rhythms is developed low down in the animal series,\r\nit would be altogether opposed to the principle of evolution, if we\r\nwere to admit that man’s musical capacity has been developed from the\r\ntones used in impassioned speech. We must suppose that the rhythms and\r\ncadences of oratory are derived from previously developed musical\r\npowers. (39. See the very interesting discussion on the ‘Origin and\r\nFunction of Music,’ by Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his collected ‘Essays,’\r\n1858, p. 359. Mr. Spencer comes to an exactly opposite conclusion to\r\nthat at which I have arrived. He concludes, as did Diderot formerly,\r\nthat the cadences used in emotional speech afford the foundation from\r\nwhich music has been developed; whilst I conclude that musical notes\r\nand rhythm were first acquired by the male or female progenitors of\r\nmankind for the sake of charming the opposite sex. Thus musical tones\r\nbecame firmly associated with some of the strongest passions an animal\r\nis capable of feeling, and are consequently used instinctively, or\r\nthrough association when strong emotions are expressed in speech. Mr.\r\nSpencer does not offer any satisfactory explanation, nor can I, why\r\nhigh or deep notes should be expressive, both with man and the lower\r\nanimals, of certain emotions. Mr. Spencer gives also an interesting\r\ndiscussion on the relations between poetry, recitative and song.) We\r\ncan thus understand how it is that music, dancing, song, and poetry are\r\nsuch very ancient arts. We may go even further than this, and, as\r\nremarked in a former chapter, believe that musical sounds afforded one\r\nof the bases for the development of language. (40. I find in Lord\r\nMonboddo’s ‘Origin of Language,’ vol. i. 1774, p. 469, that Dr.\r\nBlacklock likewise thought “that the first language among men was\r\nmusic, and that before our ideas were expressed by articulate sounds,\r\nthey were communicated by tones varied according to different degrees\r\nof gravity and acuteness.”)\r\n\r\nAs the males of several quadrumanous animals have their vocal organs\r\nmuch more developed than in the females, and as a gibbon, one of the\r\nanthropomorphous apes, pours forth a whole octave of musical notes and\r\nmay be said to sing, it appears probable that the progenitors of man,\r\neither the males or females or both sexes, before acquiring the power\r\nof expressing their mutual love in articulate language, endeavoured to\r\ncharm each other with musical notes and rhythm. So little is known\r\nabout the use of the voice by the Quadrumana during the season of love,\r\nthat we have no means of judging whether the habit of singing was first\r\nacquired by our male or female ancestors. Women are generally thought\r\nto possess sweeter voices than men, and as far as this serves as any\r\nguide, we may infer that they first acquired musical powers in order to\r\nattract the other sex. (41. See an interesting discussion on this\r\nsubject by Haeckel, ‘Generelle Morphologie,’ B. ii. 1866, s. 246.) But\r\nif so, this must have occurred long ago, before our ancestors had\r\nbecome sufficiently human to treat and value their women merely as\r\nuseful slaves. The impassioned orator, bard, or musician, when with his\r\nvaried tones and cadences he excites the strongest emotions in his\r\nhearers, little suspects that he uses the same means by which his\r\nhalf-human ancestors long ago aroused each other’s ardent passions,\r\nduring their courtship and rivalry.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF BEAUTY IN DETERMINING THE MARRIAGES OF MANKIND.\r\n\r\nIn civilised life man is largely, but by no means exclusively,\r\ninfluenced in the choice of his wife by external appearance; but we are\r\nchiefly concerned with primeval times, and our only means of forming a\r\njudgment on this subject is to study the habits of existing\r\nsemi-civilised and savage nations. If it can be shewn that the men of\r\ndifferent races prefer women having various characteristics, or\r\nconversely with the women, we have then to enquire whether such choice,\r\ncontinued during many generations, would produce any sensible effect on\r\nthe race, either on one sex or both according to the form of\r\ninheritance which has prevailed.\r\n\r\nIt will be well first to shew in some detail that savages pay the\r\ngreatest attention to their personal appearance. (42. A full and\r\nexcellent account of the manner in which savages in all parts of the\r\nworld ornament themselves, is given by the Italian traveller, Professor\r\nMantegazza, ‘Rio de la Plata, Viaggi e Studi,’ 1867, pp. 525-545; all\r\nthe following statements, when other references are not given, are\r\ntaken from this work. See, also, Waitz, ‘Introduction to Anthropology,’\r\nEng. translat. vol. i. 1863, p. 275, et passim. Lawrence also gives\r\nvery full details in his ‘Lectures on Physiology,’ 1822. Since this\r\nchapter was written Sir J. Lubbock has published his ‘Origin of\r\nCivilisation,’ 1870, in which there is an interesting chapter on the\r\npresent subject, and from which (pp. 42, 48) I have taken some facts\r\nabout savages dyeing their teeth and hair, and piercing their teeth.)\r\nThat they have a passion for ornament is notorious; and an English\r\nphilosopher goes so far as to maintain, that clothes were first made\r\nfor ornament and not for warmth. As Professor Waitz remarks, “however\r\npoor and miserable man is, he finds a pleasure in adorning himself.”\r\nThe extravagance of the naked Indians of South America in decorating\r\nthemselves is shewn “by a man of large stature gaining with difficulty\r\nenough by the labour of a fortnight to procure in exchange the chica\r\nnecessary to paint himself red.” (43. Humboldt, ‘Personal Narrative,’\r\nEng. translat. vol. iv. p. 515; on the imagination shewn in painting\r\nthe body, p. 522; on modifying the form of the calf of the leg, p.\r\n466.) The ancient barbarians of Europe during the Reindeer period\r\nbrought to their caves any brilliant or singular objects which they\r\nhappened to find. Savages at the present day everywhere deck themselves\r\nwith plumes, necklaces, armlets, ear-rings, etc. They paint themselves\r\nin the most diversified manner. “If painted nations,” as Humboldt\r\nobserves, “had been examined with the same attention as clothed\r\nnations, it would have been perceived that the most fertile imagination\r\nand the most mutable caprice have created the fashions of painting, as\r\nwell as those of garments.”\r\n\r\nIn one part of Africa the eyelids are coloured black; in another the\r\nnails are coloured yellow or purple. In many places the hair is dyed of\r\nvarious tints. In different countries the teeth are stained black, red,\r\nblue, etc., and in the Malay Archipelago it is thought shameful to have\r\nwhite teeth “like those of a dog.” Not one great country can be named,\r\nfrom the polar regions in the north to New Zealand in the south, in\r\nwhich the aborigines do not tattoo themselves. This practice was\r\nfollowed by the Jews of old, and by the ancient Britons. In Africa some\r\nof the natives tattoo themselves, but it is a much more common practice\r\nto raise protuberances by rubbing salt into incisions made in various\r\nparts of the body; and these are considered by the inhabitants of\r\nKordofan and Darfur “to be great personal attractions.” In the Arab\r\ncountries no beauty can be perfect until the cheeks “or temples have\r\nbeen gashed.” (44. ‘The Nile Tributaries,’ 1867; ‘The Albert N’yanza,’\r\n1866, vol. i. p. 218.) In South America, as Humboldt remarks, “a mother\r\nwould be accused of culpable indifference towards her children, if she\r\ndid not employ artificial means to shape the calf of the leg after the\r\nfashion of the country.” In the Old and New Worlds the shape of the\r\nskull was formerly modified during infancy in the most extraordinary\r\nmanner, as is still the case in many places, and such deformities are\r\nconsidered ornamental. For instance, the savages of Colombia (45.\r\nQuoted by Prichard, ‘Physical History of Mankind,’ 4th ed. vol. i.\r\n1851, p. 321.) deem a much flattened head “an essential point of\r\nbeauty.”\r\n\r\nThe hair is treated with especial care in various countries; it is\r\nallowed to grow to full length, so as to reach to the ground, or is\r\ncombed into “a compact frizzled mop, which is the Papuan’s pride and\r\nglory.” (46. On the Papuans, Wallace, ‘The Malay Archipelago,’ vol. ii.\r\np. 445. On the coiffure of the Africans, Sir S. Baker, ‘The Albert\r\nN’yanza,’ vol. i. p. 210.) In northern Africa “a man requires a period\r\nof from eight to ten years to perfect his coiffure.” With other nations\r\nthe head is shaved, and in parts of South America and Africa even the\r\neyebrows and eyelashes are eradicated. The natives of the Upper Nile\r\nknock out the four front teeth, saying that they do not wish to\r\nresemble brutes. Further south, the Batokas knock out only the two\r\nupper incisors, which, as Livingstone (47. ‘Travels,’ p. 533.) remarks,\r\ngives the face a hideous appearance, owing to the prominence of the\r\nlower jaw; but these people think the presence of the incisors most\r\nunsightly, and on beholding some Europeans, cried out, “Look at the\r\ngreat teeth!” The chief Sebituani tried in vain to alter this fashion.\r\nIn various parts of Africa and in the Malay Archipelago the natives\r\nfile the incisors into points like those of a saw, or pierce them with\r\nholes, into which they insert studs.\r\n\r\nAs the face with us is chiefly admired for its beauty, so with savages\r\nit is the chief seat of mutilation. In all quarters of the world the\r\nseptum, and more rarely the wings of the nose are pierced; rings,\r\nsticks, feathers, and other ornaments being inserted into the holes.\r\nThe ears are everywhere pierced and similarly ornamented, and with the\r\nBotocudos and Lenguas of South America the hole is gradually so much\r\nenlarged that the lower edge touches the shoulder. In North and South\r\nAmerica and in Africa either the upper or lower lip is pierced; and\r\nwith the Botocudos the hole in the lower lip is so large that a disc of\r\nwood, four inches in diameter, is placed in it. Mantegazza gives a\r\ncurious account of the shame felt by a South American native, and of\r\nthe ridicule which he excited, when he sold his tembeta,—the large\r\ncoloured piece of wood which is passed through the hole. In Central\r\nAfrica the women perforate the lower lip and wear a crystal, which,\r\nfrom the movement of the tongue, has “a wriggling motion, indescribably\r\nludicrous during conversation.” The wife of the chief of Latooka told\r\nSir S. Baker (49. ‘The Albert N’yanza,’ 1866, vol. i. p. 217.) that\r\nLady Baker “would be much improved if she would extract her four front\r\nteeth from the lower jaw, and wear the long pointed polished crystal in\r\nher under lip.” Further south with the Makalolo, the upper lip is\r\nperforated, and a large metal and bamboo ring, called a pelele, is worn\r\nin the hole. “This caused the lip in one case to project two inches\r\nbeyond the tip of the nose; and when the lady smiled, the contraction\r\nof the muscles elevated it over the eyes. ‘Why do the women wear these\r\nthings?’ the venerable chief, Chinsurdi, was asked. Evidently surprised\r\nat such a stupid question, he replied, ‘For beauty! They are the only\r\nbeautiful things women have; men have beards, women have none. What\r\nkind of a person would she be without the pelele? She would not be a\r\nwoman at all with a mouth like a man, but no beard.’” (49. Livingstone,\r\n‘British Association,’ 1860; report given in the ‘Athenaeum,’ July 7,\r\n1860, p. 29.)\r\n\r\nHardly any part of the body, which can be unnaturally modified, has\r\nescaped. The amount of suffering thus caused must have been extreme,\r\nfor many of the operations require several years for their completion,\r\nso that the idea of their necessity must be imperative. The motives are\r\nvarious; the men paint their bodies to make themselves appear terrible\r\nin battle; certain mutilations are connected with religious rites, or\r\nthey mark the age of puberty, or the rank of the man, or they serve to\r\ndistinguish the tribes. Amongst savages the same fashions prevail for\r\nlong periods (50. Sir S. Baker (ibid. vol. i. p. 210) speaking of the\r\nnatives of Central Africa says, “every tribe has a distinct and\r\nunchanging fashion for dressing the hair.” See Agassiz (‘Journey in\r\nBrazil,’ 1868, p. 318) on invariability of the tattooing of Amazonian\r\nIndians.), and thus mutilations, from whatever cause first made, soon\r\ncome to be valued as distinctive marks. But self-adornment, vanity, and\r\nthe admiration of others, seem to be the commonest motives. In regard\r\nto tattooing, I was told by the missionaries in New Zealand that when\r\nthey tried to persuade some girls to give up the practice, they\r\nanswered, “We must just have a few lines on our lips; else when we grow\r\nold we shall be so very ugly.” With the men of New Zealand, a most\r\ncapable judge (51. Rev. R. Taylor, ‘New Zealand and its Inhabitants,’\r\n1855, p. 152.) says, “to have fine tattooed faces was the great\r\nambition of the young, both to render themselves attractive to the\r\nladies, and conspicuous in war.” A star tattooed on the forehead and a\r\nspot on the chin are thought by the women in one part of Africa to be\r\nirresistible attractions. (52. Mantegazza, ‘Viaggi e Studi,’ p. 542.)\r\nIn most, but not all parts of the world, the men are more ornamented\r\nthan the women, and often in a different manner; sometimes, though\r\nrarely, the women are hardly at all ornamented. As the women are made\r\nby savages to perform the greatest share of the work, and as they are\r\nnot allowed to eat the best kinds of food, so it accords with the\r\ncharacteristic selfishness of man that they should not be allowed to\r\nobtain, or use the finest ornaments. Lastly, it is a remarkable fact,\r\nas proved by the foregoing quotations, that the same fashions in\r\nmodifying the shape of the head, in ornamenting the hair, in painting,\r\ntattooing, in perforating the nose, lips, or ears, in removing or\r\nfiling the teeth, etc., now prevail, and have long prevailed, in the\r\nmost distant quarters of the world. It is extremely improbable that\r\nthese practices, followed by so many distinct nations, should be due to\r\ntradition from any common source. They indicate the close similarity of\r\nthe mind of man, to whatever race he may belong, just as do the almost\r\nuniversal habits of dancing, masquerading, and making rude pictures.\r\n\r\nHaving made these preliminary remarks on the admiration felt by savages\r\nfor various ornaments, and for deformities most unsightly in our eyes,\r\nlet us see how far the men are attracted by the appearance of their\r\nwomen, and what are their ideas of beauty. I have heard it maintained\r\nthat savages are quite indifferent about the beauty of their women,\r\nvaluing them solely as slaves; it may therefore be well to observe that\r\nthis conclusion does not at all agree with the care which the women\r\ntake in ornamenting themselves, or with their vanity. Burchell (53.\r\n‘Travels in South Africa,’ 1824, vol. i. p. 414.) gives an amusing\r\naccount of a Bush-woman who used as much grease, red ochre, and shining\r\npowder “as would have ruined any but a very rich husband.” She\r\ndisplayed also “much vanity and too evident a consciousness of her\r\nsuperiority.” Mr. Winwood Reade informs me that the negroes of the West\r\nCoast often discuss the beauty of their women. Some competent observers\r\nhave attributed the fearfully common practice of infanticide partly to\r\nthe desire felt by the women to retain their good looks. (54. See, for\r\nreferences, Gerland, ‘Ueber das Aussterben der Naturvölker,’ 1868, ss.\r\n51, 53, 55; also Azara, ‘Voyages,’ etc., tom. ii. p. 116.) In several\r\nregions the women wear charms and use love-philters to gain the\r\naffections of the men; and Mr. Brown enumerates four plants used for\r\nthis purpose by the women of North-Western America. (55. On the\r\nvegetable productions used by the North-Western American Indians, see\r\n‘Pharmaceutical Journal,’ vol. x.)\r\n\r\nHearne (56. ‘A Journey from Prince of Wales Fort,’ 8vo. ed. 1796, p.\r\n89.), an excellent observer, who lived many years with the American\r\nIndians, says, in speaking of the women, “Ask a Northern Indian what is\r\nbeauty, and he will answer, a broad flat face, small eyes, high\r\ncheek-bones, three or four broad black lines across each cheek, a low\r\nforehead, a large broad chin, a clumsy hook nose, a tawny hide, and\r\nbreasts hanging down to the belt.” Pallas, who visited the northern\r\nparts of the Chinese empire, says, “those women are preferred who have\r\nthe Mandschu form; that is to say, a broad face, high cheek-bones, very\r\nbroad noses, and enormous ears”(57. Quoted by Prichard, ‘Physical\r\nHistory of Mankind,’ 3rd ed. vol. iv. 1844, p. 519; Vogt, ‘Lectures on\r\nMan,’ Eng. translat. p. 129. On the opinion of the Chinese on the\r\nCingalese, E. Tennent, ‘Ceylon,’ 1859, vol. ii. p. 107.); and Vogt\r\nremarks that the obliquity of the eye, which is proper to the Chinese\r\nand Japanese, is exaggerated in their pictures for the purpose, as it\r\n“seems, of exhibiting its beauty, as contrasted with the eye of the\r\nred-haired barbarians.” It is well known, as Huc repeatedly remarks,\r\nthat the Chinese of the interior think Europeans hideous, with their\r\nwhite skins and prominent noses. The nose is far from being too\r\nprominent, according to our ideas, in the natives of Ceylon; yet “the\r\nChinese in the seventh century, accustomed to the flat features of the\r\nMongol races, were surprised at the prominent noses of the Cingalese;\r\nand Thsang described them as having ‘the beak of a bird, with the body\r\nof a man.’”\r\n\r\nFinlayson, after minutely describing the people of Cochin China, says\r\nthat their rounded heads and faces are their chief characteristics;\r\nand, he adds, “the roundness of the whole countenance is more striking\r\nin the women, who are reckoned beautiful in proportion as they display\r\nthis form of face.” The Siamese have small noses with divergent\r\nnostrils, a wide mouth, rather thick lips, a remarkably large face,\r\nwith very high and broad cheek-bones. It is, therefore, not wonderful\r\nthat “beauty, according to our notion, is a stranger to them. Yet they\r\nconsider their own females to be much more beautiful than those of\r\nEurope.” (58. Prichard, as taken from Crawfurd and Finlayson, ‘Phys.\r\nHist. of Mankind,’ vol. iv. pp. 534, 535.)\r\n\r\nIt is well known that with many Hottentot women the posterior part of\r\nthe body projects in a wonderful manner; they are steatopygous; and Sir\r\nAndrew Smith is certain that this peculiarity is greatly admired by the\r\nmen. (59. Idem illustrissimus viator dixit mihi praecinctorium vel\r\ntabulam foeminae, quod nobis teterrimum est, quondam permagno aestimari\r\nab hominibus in hac gente. Nunc res mutata est, et censent talem\r\nconformationem minime optandam esse.) He once saw a woman who was\r\nconsidered a beauty, and she was so immensely developed behind, that\r\nwhen seated on level ground she could not rise, and had to push herself\r\nalong until she came to a slope. Some of the women in various negro\r\ntribes have the same peculiarity; and, according to Burton, the Somal\r\nmen are said to choose their wives by ranging them in a line, and by\r\npicking her out who projects farthest a tergo. Nothing can be more\r\nhateful to a negro than the opposite form.” (60. The ‘Anthropological\r\nReview,’ November 1864, p. 237. For additional references, see Waitz,\r\n‘Introduction to Anthropology,’ Eng. translat., 1863, vol. i. p. 105.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to colour, the negroes rallied Mungo Park on the whiteness\r\nof his skin and the prominence of his nose, both of which they\r\nconsidered as “unsightly and unnatural conformations.” He in return\r\npraised the glossy jet of their skins and the lovely depression of\r\ntheir noses; this they said was “honeymouth,” nevertheless they gave\r\nhim food. The African Moors, also, “knitted their brows and seemed to\r\nshudder” at the whiteness of his skin. On the eastern coast, the negro\r\nboys when they saw Burton, cried out, “Look at the white man; does he\r\nnot look like a white ape?” On the western coast, as Mr. Winwood Reade\r\ninforms me, the negroes admire a very black skin more than one of a\r\nlighter tint. But their horror of whiteness may be attributed,\r\naccording to this same traveller, partly to the belief held by most\r\nnegroes that demons and spirits are white, and partly to their thinking\r\nit a sign of ill-health.\r\n\r\nThe Banyai of the more southern part of the continent are negroes, but\r\n“a great many of them are of a light coffee-and-milk colour, and,\r\nindeed, this colour is considered handsome throughout the whole\r\ncountry”; so that here we have a different standard of taste. With the\r\nKaffirs, who differ much from negroes, “the skin, except among the\r\ntribes near Delagoa Bay, is not usually black, the prevailing colour\r\nbeing a mixture of black and red, the most common shade being\r\nchocolate. Dark complexions, as being most common, are naturally held\r\nin the highest esteem. To be told that he is light-coloured, or like a\r\nwhite man, would be deemed a very poor compliment by a Kaffir. I have\r\nheard of one unfortunate man who was so very fair that no girl would\r\nmarry him.” One of the titles of the Zulu king is, “You who are black.”\r\n(61. Mungo Park’s ‘Travels in Africa,’ 4to. 1816, pp. 53, 131. Burton’s\r\nstatement is quoted by Schaaffhausen, ‘Archiv. fur Anthropologie,’\r\n1866, s. 163. On the Banyai, Livingstone, ‘Travels,’ p. 64. On the\r\nKaffirs, the Rev. J. Shooter, ‘The Kafirs of Natal and the Zulu\r\nCountry,’ 1857, p. 1.) Mr. Galton, in speaking to me about the natives\r\nof S. Africa, remarked that their ideas of beauty seem very different\r\nfrom ours; for in one tribe two slim, slight, and pretty girls were not\r\nadmired by the natives.\r\n\r\nTurning to other quarters of the world; in Java, a yellow, not a white\r\ngirl, is considered, according to Madame Pfeiffer, a beauty. A man of\r\nCochin China “spoke with contempt of the wife of the English\r\nAmbassador, that she had white teeth like a dog, and a rosy colour like\r\nthat of potato-flowers.” We have seen that the Chinese dislike our\r\nwhite skin, and that the N. Americans admire “a tawny hide.” In S.\r\nAmerica, the Yuracaras, who inhabit the wooded, damp slopes of the\r\neastern Cordillera, are remarkably pale-coloured, as their name in\r\ntheir own language expresses; nevertheless they consider European women\r\nas very inferior to their own. (62. For the Javans and Cochin-Chinese,\r\nsee Waitz, ‘Introduct. to Anthropology,’ Eng. translat. vol. i. p. 305.\r\nOn the Yuracaras, A. d’Orbigny, as quoted in Prichard, ‘Physical\r\nHistory of Mankind,’ vol. v. 3rd ed. p. 476.)\r\n\r\nIn several of the tribes of North America the hair on the head grows to\r\na wonderful length; and Catlin gives a curious proof how much this is\r\nesteemed, for the chief of the Crows was elected to this office from\r\nhaving the longest hair of any man in the tribe, namely ten feet and\r\nseven inches. The Aymaras and Quichuas of S. America, likewise have\r\nvery long hair; and this, as Mr. D. Forbes informs me, is so much\r\nvalued as a beauty, that cutting it off was the severest punishment\r\nwhich he could inflict on them. In both the Northern and Southern\r\nhalves of the continent the natives sometimes increase the apparent\r\nlength of their hair by weaving into it fibrous substances. Although\r\nthe hair on the head is thus cherished, that on the face is considered\r\nby the North American Indians “as very vulgar,” and every hair is\r\ncarefully eradicated. This practice prevails throughout the American\r\ncontinent from Vancouver’s Island in the north to Tierra del Fuego in\r\nthe south. When York Minster, a Fuegian on board the “Beagle,” was\r\ntaken back to his country, the natives told him he ought to pull out\r\nthe few short hairs on his face. They also threatened a young\r\nmissionary, who was left for a time with them, to strip him naked, and\r\npluck the hair from his face and body, yet he was far from being a\r\nhairy man. This fashion is carried so far that the Indians of Paraguay\r\neradicate their eyebrows and eyelashes, saying that they do not wish to\r\nbe like horses. (63. ‘North American Indians,’ by G. Catlin, 3rd ed.,\r\n1842, vol. i. p. 49; vol. ii, p. 227. On the natives of Vancouver’s\r\nIsland, see Sproat, ‘Scenes and Studies of Savage Life,’ 1868, p. 25.\r\nOn the Indians of Paraguay, Azara, ‘Voyages,’ tom. ii. p. 105.)\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that throughout the world the races which are almost\r\ncompletely destitute of a beard dislike hairs on the face and body, and\r\ntake pains to eradicate them. The Kalmucks are beardless, and they are\r\nwell known, like the Americans, to pluck out all straggling hairs; and\r\nso it is with the Polynesians, some of the Malays, and the Siamese. Mr.\r\nVeitch states that the Japanese ladies “all objected to our whiskers,\r\nconsidering them very ugly, and told us to cut them off, and be like\r\nJapanese men.” The New Zealanders have short, curled beards; yet they\r\nformerly plucked out the hairs on the face. They had a saying that\r\n“there is no woman for a hairy man;” but it would appear that the\r\nfashion has changed in New Zealand, perhaps owing to the presence of\r\nEuropeans, and I am assured that beards are now admired by the Maories.\r\n(64. On the Siamese, Prichard, ibid. vol. iv. p. 533. On the Japanese,\r\nVeitch in ‘Gardeners’ Chronicle,’ 1860, p. 1104. On the New Zealanders,\r\nMantegazza, ‘Viaggi e Studi,’ 1867, p. 526. For the other nations\r\nmentioned, see references in Lawrence, ‘Lectures on Physiology,’ etc.,\r\n1822, p. 272.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, bearded races admire and greatly value their beards;\r\namong the Anglo-Saxons every part of the body had a recognised value;\r\n“the loss of the beard being estimated at twenty shillings, while the\r\nbreaking of a thigh was fixed at only twelve.” (65. Lubbock, ‘Origin of\r\nCivilisation,’ 1870, p. 321.) In the East men swear solemnly by their\r\nbeards. We have seen that Chinsurdi, the chief of the Makalolo in\r\nAfrica, thought that beards were a great ornament. In the Pacific the\r\nFijian’s beard is “profuse and bushy, and is his greatest pride”;\r\nwhilst the inhabitants of the adjacent archipelagoes of Tonga and Samoa\r\nare “beardless, and abhor a rough chin.” In one island alone of the\r\nEllice group “the men are heavily bearded, and not a little proud\r\nthereof.” (66. Dr. Barnard Davis quotes Mr. Prichard and others for\r\nthese facts in regard to the Polynesians, in ‘Anthropolog. Review,’\r\nApril 1870, pp. 185, 191.)\r\n\r\nWe thus see how widely the different races of man differ in their taste\r\nfor the beautiful. In every nation sufficiently advanced to have made\r\neffigies of their gods or of their deified rulers, the sculptors no\r\ndoubt have endeavoured to express their highest ideal of beauty and\r\ngrandeur. (67. Ch. Comte has remarks to this effect in his ‘Traité de\r\nLégislation,’ 3rd ed. 1837, p. 136.) Under this point of view it is\r\nwell to compare in our mind the Jupiter or Apollo of the Greeks with\r\nthe Egyptian or Assyrian statues; and these with the hideous\r\nbas-reliefs on the ruined buildings of Central America.\r\n\r\nI have met with very few statements opposed to this conclusion. Mr.\r\nWinwood Reade, however, who has had ample opportunities for\r\nobservation, not only with the negroes of the West Coast of Africa, but\r\nwith those of the interior who have never associated with Europeans, is\r\nconvinced that their ideas of beauty are ON THE WHOLE the same as ours;\r\nand Dr. Rohlfs writes to me to the same effect with respect to Bornu\r\nand the countries inhabited by the Pullo tribes. Mr. Reade found that\r\nhe agreed with the negroes in their estimation of the beauty of the\r\nnative girls; and that their appreciation of the beauty of European\r\nwomen corresponded with ours. They admire long hair, and use artificial\r\nmeans to make it appear abundant; they admire also a beard, though\r\nthemselves very scantily provided. Mr. Reade feels doubtful what kind\r\nof nose is most appreciated; a girl has been heard to say, “I do not\r\nwant to marry him, he has got no nose”; and this shews that a very flat\r\nnose is not admired. We should, however, bear in mind that the\r\ndepressed, broad noses and projecting jaws of the negroes of the West\r\nCoast are exceptional types with the inhabitants of Africa.\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing statements, Mr. Reade admits that negroes\r\n“do not like the colour of our skin; they look on blue eyes with\r\naversion, and they think our noses too long and our lips too thin.” He\r\ndoes not think it probable that negroes would ever prefer the most\r\nbeautiful European woman, on the mere grounds of physical admiration,\r\nto a good-looking negress. (68. The ‘African Sketch Book,’ vol. ii.\r\n1873, pp. 253, 394, 521. The Fuegians, as I have been informed by a\r\nmissionary who long resided with them, consider European women as\r\nextremely beautiful; but from what we have seen of the judgment of the\r\nother aborigines of America, I cannot but think that this must be a\r\nmistake, unless indeed the statement refers to the few Fuegians who\r\nhave lived for some time with Europeans, and who must consider us as\r\nsuperior beings. I should add that a most experienced observer, Capt.\r\nBurton, believes that a woman whom we consider beautiful is admired\r\nthroughout the world. ‘Anthropological Review,’ March, 1864, p. 245.)\r\n\r\nThe general truth of the principle, long ago insisted on by Humboldt\r\n(69. ‘Personal Narrative,’ Eng. translat. vol. iv. p. 518, and\r\nelsewhere. Mantegazza, in his ‘Viaggi e Studi,’ strongly insists on\r\nthis same principle.), that man admires and often tries to exaggerate\r\nwhatever characters nature may have given him, is shewn in many ways.\r\nThe practice of beardless races extirpating every trace of a beard, and\r\noften all the hairs on the body affords one illustration. The skull has\r\nbeen greatly modified during ancient and modern times by many nations;\r\nand there can be little doubt that this has been practised, especially\r\nin N. and S. America, in order to exaggerate some natural and admired\r\npeculiarity. Many American Indians are known to admire a head so\r\nextremely flattened as to appear to us idiotic. The natives on the\r\nnorth-western coast compress the head into a pointed cone; and it is\r\ntheir constant practice to gather the hair into a knot on the top of\r\nthe head, for the sake, as Dr. Wilson remarks, “of increasing the\r\napparent elevation of the favourite conoid form.” The inhabitants of\r\nArakhan admire a broad, smooth forehead, and in order to produce it,\r\nthey fasten a plate of lead on the heads of the new-born children. On\r\nthe other hand, “a broad, well-rounded occiput is considered a great\r\nbeauty” by the natives of the Fiji Islands. (70. On the skulls of the\r\nAmerican tribes, see Nott and Gliddon, ‘Types of Mankind,’ 1854, p.\r\n440; Prichard, ‘Physical History of Mankind,’ vol. i. 3rd ed. p. 321;\r\non the natives of Arakhan, ibid. vol. iv. p. 537. Wilson, ‘Physical\r\nEthnology,’ Smithsonian Institution, 1863, p. 288; on the Fijians, p.\r\n290. Sir J. Lubbock (‘Prehistoric Times,’ 2nd ed. 1869, p. 506) gives\r\nan excellent resume on this subject.)\r\n\r\nAs with the skull, so with the nose; the ancient Huns during the age of\r\nAttila were accustomed to flatten the noses of their infants with\r\nbandages, “for the sake of exaggerating a natural conformation.” With\r\nthe Tahitians, to be called LONG-NOSE is considered as an insult, and\r\nthey compress the noses and foreheads of their children for the sake of\r\nbeauty. The same holds with the Malays of Sumatra, the Hottentots,\r\ncertain Negroes, and the natives of Brazil. (71. On the Huns, Godron,\r\n‘De l’Espèce,’ tom. ii. 1859, p. 300. On the Tahitians, Waitz,\r\n‘Anthropology,’ Eng. translat. vol. i. p. 305. Marsden, quoted by\r\nPrichard, ‘Phys. Hist. of Mankind,’ 3rd edit. vol. v. p. 67. Lawrence,\r\n‘Lectures on Physiology,’ p. 337.) The Chinese have by nature unusually\r\nsmall feet (72. This fact was ascertained in the ‘Reise der Novara:\r\nAnthropolog. Theil.’ Dr. Weisbach, 1867, s. 265.); and it is well known\r\nthat the women of the upper classes distort their feet to make them\r\nstill smaller. Lastly, Humboldt thinks that the American Indians prefer\r\ncolouring their bodies with red paint in order to exaggerate their\r\nnatural tint; and until recently European women added to their\r\nnaturally bright colours by rouge and white cosmetics; but it may be\r\ndoubted whether barbarous nations have generally had any such intention\r\nin painting themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the fashions of our own dress we see exactly the same principle and\r\nthe same desire to carry every point to an extreme; we exhibit, also,\r\nthe same spirit of emulation. But the fashions of savages are far more\r\npermanent than ours; and whenever their bodies are artificially\r\nmodified, this is necessarily the case. The Arab women of the Upper\r\nNile occupy about three days in dressing their hair; they never imitate\r\nother tribes, “but simply vie with each other in the superlativeness of\r\ntheir own style.” Dr. Wilson, in speaking of the compressed skulls of\r\nvarious American races, adds, “such usages are among the least\r\neradicable, and long survive the shock of revolutions that change\r\ndynasties and efface more important national peculiarities.” (73.\r\n‘Smithsonian Institution,’ 1863, p. 289. On the fashions of Arab women,\r\nSir S. Baker, ‘The Nile Tributaries,’ 1867, p. 121.) The same principle\r\ncomes into play in the art of breeding; and we can thus understand, as\r\nI have elsewhere explained (74. The ‘Variation of Animals and Plants\r\nunder Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 214; vol. ii. p. 240.), the wonderful\r\ndevelopment of the many races of animals and plants, which have been\r\nkept merely for ornament. Fanciers always wish each character to be\r\nsomewhat increased; they do not admire a medium standard; they\r\ncertainly do not desire any great and abrupt change in the character of\r\ntheir breeds; they admire solely what they are accustomed to, but they\r\nardently desire to see each characteristic feature a little more\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe senses of man and of the lower animals seem to be so constituted\r\nthat brilliant colours and certain forms, as well as harmonious and\r\nrhythmical sounds, give pleasure and are called beautiful; but why this\r\nshould be so we know not. It is certainly not true that there is in the\r\nmind of man any universal standard of beauty with respect to the human\r\nbody. It is, however, possible that certain tastes may in the course of\r\ntime become inherited, though there is no evidence in favour of this\r\nbelief: and if so, each race would possess its own innate ideal\r\nstandard of beauty. It has been argued (75. Schaaffhausen, ‘Archiv. für\r\nAnthropologie,’ 1866, s. 164.) that ugliness consists in an approach to\r\nthe structure of the lower animals, and no doubt this is partly true\r\nwith the more civilised nations, in which intellect is highly\r\nappreciated; but this explanation will hardly apply to all forms of\r\nugliness. The men of each race prefer what they are accustomed to; they\r\ncannot endure any great change; but they like variety, and admire each\r\ncharacteristic carried to a moderate extreme. (76. Mr. Bain has\r\ncollected (‘Mental and Moral Science,’ 1868, pp. 304-314) about a dozen\r\nmore or less different theories of the idea of beauty; but none is\r\nquite the same as that here given.) Men accustomed to a nearly oval\r\nface, to straight and regular features, and to bright colours, admire,\r\nas we Europeans know, these points when strongly developed. On the\r\nother hand, men accustomed to a broad face, with high cheek-bones, a\r\ndepressed nose, and a black skin, admire these peculiarities when\r\nstrongly marked. No doubt characters of all kinds may be too much\r\ndeveloped for beauty. Hence a perfect beauty, which implies many\r\ncharacters modified in a particular manner, will be in every race a\r\nprodigy. As the great anatomist Bichat long ago said, if every one were\r\ncast in the same mould, there would be no such thing as beauty. If all\r\nour women were to become as beautiful as the Venus de’ Medici, we\r\nshould for a time be charmed; but we should soon wish for variety; and\r\nas soon as we had obtained variety, we should wish to see certain\r\ncharacters a little exaggerated beyond the then existing common\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAN—continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the effects of the continued selection of women according to a\r\ndifferent standard of beauty in each race—On the causes which interfere\r\nwith sexual selection in civilised and savage nations—Conditions\r\nfavourable to sexual selection during primeval times—On the manner of\r\naction of sexual selection with mankind—On the women in savage tribes\r\nhaving some power to choose their husbands—Absence of hair on the body,\r\nand development of the beard—Colour of the skin—Summary.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that with all barbarous races\r\nornaments, dress, and external appearance are highly valued; and that\r\nthe men judge of the beauty of their women by widely different\r\nstandards. We must next inquire whether this preference and the\r\nconsequent selection during many generations of those women, which\r\nappear to the men of each race the most attractive, has altered the\r\ncharacter either of the females alone, or of both sexes. With mammals\r\nthe general rule appears to be that characters of all kinds are\r\ninherited equally by the males and females; we might therefore expect\r\nthat with mankind any characters gained by the females or by the males\r\nthrough sexual selection would commonly be transferred to the offspring\r\nof both sexes. If any change has thus been effected, it is almost\r\ncertain that the different races would be differently modified, as each\r\nhas its own standard of beauty.\r\n\r\nWith mankind, especially with savages, many causes interfere with the\r\naction of sexual selection as far as the bodily frame is concerned.\r\nCivilised men are largely attracted by the mental charms of women, by\r\ntheir wealth, and especially by their social position; for men rarely\r\nmarry into a much lower rank. The men who succeed in obtaining the more\r\nbeautiful women will not have a better chance of leaving a long line of\r\ndescendants than other men with plainer wives, save the few who\r\nbequeath their fortunes according to primogeniture. With respect to the\r\nopposite form of selection, namely, of the more attractive men by the\r\nwomen, although in civilised nations women have free or almost free\r\nchoice, which is not the case with barbarous races, yet their choice is\r\nlargely influenced by the social position and wealth of the men; and\r\nthe success of the latter in life depends much on their intellectual\r\npowers and energy, or on the fruits of these same powers in their\r\nforefathers. No excuse is needed for treating this subject in some\r\ndetail; for, as the German philosopher Schopenhauer remarks, “the final\r\naim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more\r\nimportance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is\r\nnothing less than the composition of the next generation...It is not\r\nthe weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to\r\ncome, which is here at stake.” (1. ‘Schopenhauer and Darwinism,’ in\r\n‘Journal of Anthropology,’ Jan. 1871, p. 323.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, reason to believe that in certain civilised and\r\nsemi-civilised nations sexual selection has effected something in\r\nmodifying the bodily frame of some of the members. Many persons are\r\nconvinced, as it appears to me with justice, that our aristocracy,\r\nincluding under this term all wealthy families in which primogeniture\r\nhas long prevailed, from having chosen during many generations from all\r\nclasses the more beautiful women as their wives, have become handsomer,\r\naccording to the European standard, than the middle classes; yet the\r\nmiddle classes are placed under equally favourable conditions of life\r\nfor the perfect development of the body. Cook remarks that the\r\nsuperiority in personal appearance “which is observable in the erees or\r\nnobles in all the other islands (of the Pacific) is found in the\r\nSandwich Islands”; but this may be chiefly due to their better food and\r\nmanner of life.\r\n\r\nThe old traveller Chardin, in describing the Persians, says their\r\n“blood is now highly refined by frequent intermixtures with the\r\nGeorgians and Circassians, two nations which surpass all the world in\r\npersonal beauty. There is hardly a man of rank in Persia who is not\r\nborn of a Georgian or Circassian mother.” He adds that they inherit\r\ntheir beauty, “not from their ancestors, for without the above mixture,\r\nthe men of rank in Persia, who are descendants of the Tartars, would be\r\nextremely ugly.” (2. These quotations are taken from Lawrence\r\n(‘Lectures on Physiology,’ etc., 1822, p. 393), who attributes the\r\nbeauty of the upper classes in England to the men having long selected\r\nthe more beautiful women.) Here is a more curious case; the priestesses\r\nwho attended the temple of Venus Erycina at San-Giuliano in Sicily,\r\nwere selected for their beauty out of the whole of Greece; they were\r\nnot vestal virgins, and Quatrefages (3. ‘Anthropologie,’ ‘Revue des\r\nCours Scientifiques,’ Oct. 1868, p. 721.), who states the foregoing\r\nfact, says that the women of San-Giuliano are now famous as the most\r\nbeautiful in the island, and are sought by artists as models. But it is\r\nobvious that the evidence in all the above cases is doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe following case, though relating to savages, is well worth giving\r\nfor its curiosity. Mr. Winwood Reade informs me that the Jollofs, a\r\ntribe of negroes on the west coast of Africa, “are remarkable for their\r\nuniformly fine appearance.” A friend of his asked one of these men,\r\n“How is it that every one whom I meet is so fine looking, not only your\r\nmen but your women?” The Jollof answered, “It is very easily explained:\r\nit has always been our custom to pick out our worst-looking slaves and\r\nto sell them.” It need hardly be added that with all savages, female\r\nslaves serve as concubines. That this negro should have attributed,\r\nwhether rightly or wrongly, the fine appearance of his tribe to the\r\nlong-continued elimination of the ugly women is not so surprising as it\r\nmay at first appear; for I have elsewhere shewn (4. ‘Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. i. p. 207.) that negroes\r\nfully appreciate the importance of selection in the breeding of their\r\ndomestic animals, and I could give from Mr. Reade additional evidence\r\non this head.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES WHICH PREVENT OR CHECK THE ACTION OF SEXUAL SELECTION WITH\r\nSAVAGES.\r\n\r\nThe chief causes are, first, so-called communal marriages or\r\npromiscuous intercourse; secondly, the consequences of female\r\ninfanticide; thirdly, early betrothals; and lastly, the low estimation\r\nin which women are held, as mere slaves. These four points must be\r\nconsidered in some detail.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that as long as the pairing of man, or of any other\r\nanimal, is left to mere chance, with no choice exerted by either sex,\r\nthere can be no sexual selection; and no effect will be produced on the\r\noffspring by certain individuals having had an advantage over others in\r\ntheir courtship. Now it is asserted that there exist at the present day\r\ntribes which practise what Sir J. Lubbock by courtesy calls communal\r\nmarriages; that is, all the men and women in the tribe are husbands and\r\nwives to one another. The licentiousness of many savages is no doubt\r\nastonishing, but it seems to me that more evidence is requisite, before\r\nwe fully admit that their intercourse is in any case promiscuous.\r\nNevertheless all those who have most closely studied the subject (5.\r\nSir J. Lubbock, ‘The Origin of Civilisation,’ 1870, chap. iii.\r\nespecially pp. 60-67. Mr. M’Lennan, in his extremely valuable work on\r\n‘Primitive Marriage,’ 1865, p. 163, speaks of the union of the sexes\r\n“in the earliest times as loose, transitory, and in some degree\r\npromiscuous.” Mr. M’Lennan and Sir J. Lubbock have collected much\r\nevidence on the extreme licentiousness of savages at the present time.\r\nMr. L.H. Morgan, in his interesting memoir of the classificatory system\r\nof relationship. (‘Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences,’\r\nvol. vii. Feb. 1868, p. 475), concludes that polygamy and all forms of\r\nmarriage during primeval times were essentially unknown. It appears\r\nalso, from Sir J. Lubbock’s work, that Bachofen likewise believes that\r\ncommunal intercourse originally prevailed.), and whose judgment is\r\nworth much more than mine, believe that communal marriage (this\r\nexpression being variously guarded) was the original and universal form\r\nthroughout the world, including therein the intermarriage of brothers\r\nand sisters. The late Sir A. Smith, who had travelled widely in S.\r\nAfrica, and knew much about the habits of savages there and elsewhere,\r\nexpressed to me the strongest opinion that no race exists in which\r\nwoman is considered as the property of the community. I believe that\r\nhis judgment was largely determined by what is implied by the term\r\nmarriage. Throughout the following discussion I use the term in the\r\nsame sense as when naturalists speak of animals as monogamous, meaning\r\nthereby that the male is accepted by or chooses a single female, and\r\nlives with her either during the breeding-season or for the whole year,\r\nkeeping possession of her by the law of might; or, as when they speak\r\nof a polygamous species, meaning that the male lives with several\r\nfemales. This kind of marriage is all that concerns us here, as it\r\nsuffices for the work of sexual selection. But I know that some of the\r\nwriters above referred to imply by the term marriage a recognised right\r\nprotected by the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe indirect evidence in favour of the belief of the former prevalence\r\nof communal marriages is strong, and rests chiefly on the terms of\r\nrelationship which are employed between the members of the same tribe,\r\nimplying a connection with the tribe, and not with either parent. But\r\nthe subject is too large and complex for even an abstract to be here\r\ngiven, and I will confine myself to a few remarks. It is evident in the\r\ncase of such marriages, or where the marriage tie is very loose, that\r\nthe relationship of the child to its father cannot be known. But it\r\nseems almost incredible that the relationship of the child to its\r\nmother should ever be completely ignored, especially as the women in\r\nmost savage tribes nurse their infants for a long time. Accordingly, in\r\nmany cases the lines of descent are traced through the mother alone, to\r\nthe exclusion of the father. But in other cases the terms employed\r\nexpress a connection with the tribe alone, to the exclusion even of the\r\nmother. It seems possible that the connection between the related\r\nmembers of the same barbarous tribe, exposed to all sorts of danger,\r\nmight be so much more important, owing to the need of mutual protection\r\nand aid, than that between the mother and her child, as to lead to the\r\nsole use of terms expressive of the former relationships; but Mr.\r\nMorgan is convinced that this view is by no means sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe terms of relationship used in different parts of the world may be\r\ndivided, according to the author just quoted, into two great classes,\r\nthe classificatory and descriptive, the latter being employed by us. It\r\nis the classificatory system which so strongly leads to the belief that\r\ncommunal and other extremely loose forms of marriage were originally\r\nuniversal. But as far as I can see, there is no necessity on this\r\nground for believing in absolutely promiscuous intercourse; and I am\r\nglad to find that this is Sir J. Lubbock’s view. Men and women, like\r\nmany of the lower animals, might formerly have entered into strict\r\nthough temporary unions for each birth, and in this case nearly as much\r\nconfusion would have arisen in the terms of relationship as in the case\r\nof promiscuous intercourse. As far as sexual selection is concerned,\r\nall that is required is that choice should be exerted before the\r\nparents unite, and it signifies little whether the unions last for life\r\nor only for a season.\r\n\r\nBesides the evidence derived from the terms of relationship, other\r\nlines of reasoning indicate the former wide prevalence of communal\r\nmarriage. Sir J. Lubbock accounts for the strange and widely-extended\r\nhabit of exogamy—that is, the men of one tribe taking wives from a\r\ndistinct tribe,—by communism having been the original form of\r\nintercourse; so that a man never obtained a wife for himself unless he\r\ncaptured her from a neighbouring and hostile tribe, and then she would\r\nnaturally have become his sole and valuable property. Thus the practice\r\nof capturing wives might have arisen; and from the honour so gained it\r\nmight ultimately have become the universal habit. According to Sir J.\r\nLubbock (6. ‘Address to British Association On the Social and Religious\r\nCondition of the Lower Races of Man,’ 1870, p. 20.), we can also thus\r\nunderstand “the necessity of expiation for marriage as an infringement\r\nof tribal rites, since according to old ideas, a man had no right to\r\nappropriate to himself that which belonged to the whole tribe.” Sir J.\r\nLubbock further gives a curious body of facts shewing that in old times\r\nhigh honour was bestowed on women who were utterly licentious; and\r\nthis, as he explains, is intelligible, if we admit that promiscuous\r\nintercourse was the aboriginal, and therefore long revered custom of\r\nthe tribe. (7. ‘Origin of Civilisation,’ 1870, p. 86. In the several\r\nworks above quoted, there will be found copious evidence on\r\nrelationship through the females alone, or with the tribe alone.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the manner of development of the marriage tie is an obscure\r\nsubject, as we may infer from the divergent opinions on several points\r\nbetween the three authors who have studied it most closely, namely, Mr.\r\nMorgan, Mr. M’Lennan, and Sir J. Lubbock, yet from the foregoing and\r\nseveral other lines of evidence it seems probable (8. Mr. C. Staniland\r\nWake argues strongly (‘Anthropologia,’ March, 1874, p. 197) against the\r\nviews held by these three writers on the former prevalence of almost\r\npromiscuous intercourse; and he thinks that the classificatory system\r\nof relationship can be otherwise explained.) that the habit of\r\nmarriage, in any strict sense of the word, has been gradually\r\ndeveloped; and that almost promiscuous or very loose intercourse was\r\nonce extremely common throughout the world. Nevertheless, from the\r\nstrength of the feeling of jealousy all through the animal kingdom, as\r\nwell as from the analogy of the lower animals, more particularly of\r\nthose which come nearest to man, I cannot believe that absolutely\r\npromiscuous intercourse prevailed in times past, shortly before man\r\nattained to his present rank in the zoological scale. Man, as I have\r\nattempted to shew, is certainly descended from some ape-like creature.\r\nWith the existing Quadrumana, as far as their habits are known, the\r\nmales of some species are monogamous, but live during only a part of\r\nthe year with the females: of this the orang seems to afford an\r\ninstance. Several kinds, for example some of the Indian and American\r\nmonkeys, are strictly monogamous, and associate all the year round with\r\ntheir wives. Others are polygamous, for example the gorilla and several\r\nAmerican species, and each family lives separate. Even when this\r\noccurs, the families inhabiting the same district are probably somewhat\r\nsocial; the chimpanzee, for instance, is occasionally met with in large\r\nbands. Again, other species are polygamous, but several males, each\r\nwith his own females, live associated in a body, as with several\r\nspecies of baboons. (9. Brehm (‘Thierleben,’ B. i. p. 77) says\r\nCynocephalus hamadryas lives in great troops containing twice as many\r\nadult females as adult males. See Rengger on American polygamous\r\nspecies, and Owen (‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 746) on\r\nAmerican monogamous species. Other references might be added.) We may\r\nindeed conclude from what we know of the jealousy of all male\r\nquadrupeds, armed, as many of them are, with special weapons for\r\nbattling with their rivals, that promiscuous intercourse in a state of\r\nnature is extremely improbable. The pairing may not last for life, but\r\nonly for each birth; yet if the males which are the strongest and best\r\nable to defend or otherwise assist their females and young, were to\r\nselect the more attractive females, this would suffice for sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nTherefore, looking far enough back in the stream of time, and judging\r\nfrom the social habits of man as he now exists, the most probable view\r\nis that he aboriginally lived in small communities, each with a single\r\nwife, or if powerful with several, whom he jealously guarded against\r\nall other men. Or he may not have been a social animal, and yet have\r\nlived with several wives, like the gorilla; for all the natives “agree\r\nthat but one adult male is seen in a band; when the young male grows\r\nup, a contest takes place for mastery, and the strongest, by killing\r\nand driving out the others, establishes himself as the head of the\r\ncommunity.” (10. Dr. Savage, in ‘Boston Journal of Natural History,’\r\nvol. v. 1845-47, p. 423.) The younger males, being thus expelled and\r\nwandering about, would, when at last successful in finding a partner,\r\nprevent too close interbreeding within the limits of the same family.\r\n\r\nAlthough savages are now extremely licentious, and although communal\r\nmarriages may formerly have largely prevailed, yet many tribes practise\r\nsome form of marriage, but of a far more lax nature than that of\r\ncivilised nations. Polygamy, as just stated, is almost universally\r\nfollowed by the leading men in every tribe. Nevertheless there are\r\ntribes, standing almost at the bottom of the scale, which are strictly\r\nmonogamous. This is the case with the Veddahs of Ceylon: they have a\r\nsaying, according to Sir J. Lubbock (11. ‘Prehistoric Times,’ 1869, p.\r\n424.), “that death alone can separate husband and wife.” An intelligent\r\nKandyan chief, of course a polygamist, “was perfectly scandalised at\r\nthe utter barbarism of living with only one wife, and never parting\r\nuntil separated by death.” It was, he said, “just like the Wanderoo\r\nmonkeys.” Whether savages who now enter into some form of marriage,\r\neither polygamous or monogamous, have retained this habit from primeval\r\ntimes, or whether they have returned to some form of marriage, after\r\npassing through a stage of promiscuous intercourse, I will not pretend\r\nto conjecture.\r\n\r\nINFANTICIDE.\r\n\r\nThis practice is now very common throughout the world, and there is\r\nreason to believe that it prevailed much more extensively during former\r\ntimes. (12. Mr. M’Lennan, ‘Primitive Marriage,’ 1865. See especially on\r\nexogamy and infanticide, pp. 130, 138, 165.) Barbarians find it\r\ndifficult to support themselves and their children, and it is a simple\r\nplan to kill their infants. In South America some tribes, according to\r\nAzara, formerly destroyed so many infants of both sexes that they were\r\non the point of extinction. In the Polynesian Islands women have been\r\nknown to kill from four or five, to even ten of their children; and\r\nEllis could not find a single woman who had not killed at least one. In\r\na village on the eastern frontier of India Colonel MacCulloch found not\r\na single female child. Wherever infanticide (13. Dr. Gerland (‘Ueber\r\ndas Aussterben der Naturvölker,’ 1868) has collected much information\r\non infanticide, see especially ss. 27, 51, 54. Azara (‘Voyages,’ etc.,\r\ntom. ii. pp. 94, 116) enters in detail on the motives. See also\r\nM’Lennan (ibid. p. 139) for cases in India. In the former reprints of\r\nthe 2nd edition of this book an incorrect quotation from Sir G. Grey\r\nwas unfortunately given in the above passage and has now been removed\r\nfrom the text.) prevails the struggle for existence will be in so far\r\nless severe, and all the members of the tribe will have an almost\r\nequally good chance of rearing their few surviving children. In most\r\ncases a larger number of female than of male infants are destroyed, for\r\nit is obvious that the latter are of more value to the tribe, as they\r\nwill, when grown up, aid in defending it, and can support themselves.\r\nBut the trouble experienced by the women in rearing children, their\r\nconsequent loss of beauty, the higher estimation set on them when few,\r\nand their happier fate, are assigned by the women themselves, and by\r\nvarious observers, as additional motives for infanticide.\r\n\r\nWhen, owing to female infanticide, the women of a tribe were few, the\r\nhabit of capturing wives from neighbouring tribes would naturally\r\narise. Sir J. Lubbock, however, as we have seen, attributes the\r\npractice in chief part to the former existence of communal marriage,\r\nand to the men having consequently captured women from other tribes to\r\nhold as their sole property. Additional causes might be assigned, such\r\nas the communities being very small, in which case, marriageable women\r\nwould often be deficient. That the habit was most extensively practised\r\nduring former times, even by the ancestors of civilised nations, is\r\nclearly shewn by the preservation of many curious customs and\r\nceremonies, of which Mr. M’Lennan has given an interesting account. In\r\nour own marriages the “best man” seems originally to have been the\r\nchief abettor of the bridegroom in the act of capture. Now as long as\r\nmen habitually procured their wives through violence and craft, they\r\nwould have been glad to seize on any woman, and would not have selected\r\nthe more attractive ones. But as soon as the practice of procuring\r\nwives from a distinct tribe was effected through barter, as now occurs\r\nin many places, the more attractive women would generally have been\r\npurchased. The incessant crossing, however, between tribe and tribe,\r\nwhich necessarily follows from any form of this habit, would tend to\r\nkeep all the people inhabiting the same country nearly uniform in\r\ncharacter; and this would interfere with the power of sexual selection\r\nin differentiating the tribes.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of women, consequent on female infanticide, leads, also,\r\nto another practice, that of polyandry, still common in several parts\r\nof the world, and which formerly, as Mr. M’Lennan believes, prevailed\r\nalmost universally: but this latter conclusion is doubted by Mr. Morgan\r\nand Sir J. Lubbock. (14. ‘Primitive Marriage,’ p. 208; Sir J. Lubbock,\r\n‘Origin of Civilisation,’ p. 100. See also Mr. Morgan, loc. cit., on\r\nthe former prevalence of polyandry.) Whenever two or more men are\r\ncompelled to marry one woman, it is certain that all the women of the\r\ntribe will get married, and there will be no selection by the men of\r\nthe more attractive women. But under these circumstances the women no\r\ndoubt will have the power of choice, and will prefer the more\r\nattractive men. Azara, for instance, describes how carefully a Guana\r\nwoman bargains for all sorts of privileges, before accepting some one\r\nor more husbands; and the men in consequence take unusual care of their\r\npersonal appearance. So amongst the Todas of India, who practise\r\npolyandry, the girls can accept or refuse any man. (15. Azara,\r\n‘Voyages,’ etc., tom. ii. pp. 92-95; Colonel Marshall, ‘Amongst the\r\nTodas,’ p. 212.) A very ugly man in these cases would perhaps\r\naltogether fail in getting a wife, or get one later in life; but the\r\nhandsomer men, although more successful in obtaining wives, would not,\r\nas far as we can see, leave more offspring to inherit their beauty than\r\nthe less handsome husbands of the same women.\r\n\r\nEARLY BETROTHALS AND SLAVERY OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\nWith many savages it is the custom to betroth the females whilst mere\r\ninfants; and this would effectually prevent preference being exerted on\r\neither side according to personal appearance. But it would not prevent\r\nthe more attractive women from being afterwards stolen or taken by\r\nforce from their husbands by the more powerful men; and this often\r\nhappens in Australia, America, and elsewhere. The same consequences\r\nwith reference to sexual selection would to a certain extent follow,\r\nwhen women are valued almost solely as slaves or beasts of burden, as\r\nis the case with many savages. The men, however, at all times would\r\nprefer the handsomest slaves according to their standard of beauty.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that several customs prevail with savages which must\r\ngreatly interfere with, or completely stop, the action of sexual\r\nselection. On the other hand, the conditions of life to which savages\r\nare exposed, and some of their habits, are favourable to natural\r\nselection; and this comes into play at the same time with sexual\r\nselection. Savages are known to suffer severely from recurrent famines;\r\nthey do not increase their food by artificial means; they rarely\r\nrefrain from marriage (16. Burchell says (‘Travels in S. Africa,’ vol.\r\nii. 1824, p. 58), that among the wild nations of Southern Africa,\r\nneither men nor women ever pass their lives in a state of celibacy.\r\nAzara (‘Voyages dans l’Amérique Merid.’ tom. ii. 1809, p. 21) makes\r\nprecisely the same remark in regard to the wild Indians of South\r\nAmerica.), and generally marry whilst young. Consequently they must be\r\nsubjected to occasional hard struggles for existence, and the favoured\r\nindividuals will alone survive.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period, before man attained to his present rank in the\r\nscale, many of his conditions would be different from what now obtains\r\namongst savages. Judging from the analogy of the lower animals, he\r\nwould then either live with a single female, or be a polygamist. The\r\nmost powerful and able males would succeed best in obtaining attractive\r\nfemales. They would also succeed best in the general struggle for life,\r\nand in defending their females, as well as their offspring, from\r\nenemies of all kinds. At this early period the ancestors of man would\r\nnot be sufficiently advanced in intellect to look forward to distant\r\ncontingencies; they would not foresee that the rearing of all their\r\nchildren, especially their female children, would make the struggle for\r\nlife severer for the tribe. They would be governed more by their\r\ninstincts and less by their reason than are savages at the present day.\r\nThey would not at that period have partially lost one of the strongest\r\nof all instincts, common to all the lower animals, namely the love of\r\ntheir young offspring; and consequently they would not have practised\r\nfemale infanticide. Women would not have been thus rendered scarce, and\r\npolyandry would not have been practised; for hardly any other cause,\r\nexcept the scarcity of women seems sufficient to break down the natural\r\nand widely prevalent feeling of jealousy, and the desire of each male\r\nto possess a female for himself. Polyandry would be a natural\r\nstepping-stone to communal marriages or almost promiscuous intercourse;\r\nthough the best authorities believe that this latter habit preceded\r\npolyandry. During primordial times there would be no early betrothals,\r\nfor this implies foresight. Nor would women be valued merely as useful\r\nslaves or beasts of burthen. Both sexes, if the females as well as the\r\nmales were permitted to exert any choice, would choose their partners\r\nnot for mental charms, or property, or social position, but almost\r\nsolely from external appearance. All the adults would marry or pair,\r\nand all the offspring, as far as that was possible, would be reared; so\r\nthat the struggle for existence would be periodically excessively\r\nsevere. Thus during these times all the conditions for sexual selection\r\nwould have been more favourable than at a later period, when man had\r\nadvanced in his intellectual powers but had retrograded in his\r\ninstincts. Therefore, whatever influence sexual selection may have had\r\nin producing the differences between the races of man, and between man\r\nand the higher Quadrumana, this influence would have been more powerful\r\nat a remote period than at the present day, though probably not yet\r\nwholly lost.\r\n\r\nTHE MANNER OF ACTION OF SEXUAL SELECTION WITH MANKIND.\r\n\r\nWith primeval man under the favourable conditions just stated, and with\r\nthose savages who at the present time enter into any marriage tie,\r\nsexual selection has probably acted in the following manner, subject to\r\ngreater or less interference from female infanticide, early betrothals,\r\netc. The strongest and most vigorous men—those who could best defend\r\nand hunt for their families, who were provided with the best weapons\r\nand possessed the most property, such as a large number of dogs or\r\nother animals,—would succeed in rearing a greater average number of\r\noffspring than the weaker and poorer members of the same tribes. There\r\ncan, also, be no doubt that such men would generally be able to select\r\nthe more attractive women. At present the chiefs of nearly every tribe\r\nthroughout the world succeed in obtaining more than one wife. I hear\r\nfrom Mr. Mantell that, until recently, almost every girl in New Zealand\r\nwho was pretty, or promised to be pretty, was tapu to some chief. With\r\nthe Kafirs, as Mr. C. Hamilton states (17. ‘Anthropological Review,’\r\nJan. 1870, p. xvi.), “the chiefs generally have the pick of the women\r\nfor many miles round, and are most persevering in establishing or\r\nconfirming their privilege.” We have seen that each race has its own\r\nstyle of beauty, and we know that it is natural to man to admire each\r\ncharacteristic point in his domestic animals, dress, ornaments, and\r\npersonal appearance, when carried a little beyond the average. If then\r\nthe several foregoing propositions be admitted, and I cannot see that\r\nthey are doubtful, it would be an inexplicable circumstance if the\r\nselection of the more attractive women by the more powerful men of each\r\ntribe, who would rear on an average a greater number of children, did\r\nnot after the lapse of many generations somewhat modify the character\r\nof the tribe.\r\n\r\nWhen a foreign breed of our domestic animals is introduced into a new\r\ncountry, or when a native breed is long and carefully attended to,\r\neither for use or ornament, it is found after several generations to\r\nhave undergone a greater or less amount of change whenever the means of\r\ncomparison exist. This follows from unconscious selection during a long\r\nseries of generations—that is, the preservation of the most approved\r\nindividuals—without any wish or expectation of such a result on the\r\npart of the breeder. So again, if during many years two careful\r\nbreeders rear animals of the same family, and do not compare them\r\ntogether or with a common standard, the animals are found to have\r\nbecome, to the surprise of their owners, slightly different. (18. The\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ vol. ii. pp.\r\n210-217.) Each breeder has impressed, as von Nathusius well expresses\r\nit, the character of his own mind—his own taste and judgment—on his\r\nanimals. What reason, then, can be assigned why similar results should\r\nnot follow from the long-continued selection of the most admired women\r\nby those men of each tribe who were able to rear the greatest number of\r\nchildren? This would be unconscious selection, for an effect would be\r\nproduced, independently of any wish or expectation on the part of the\r\nmen who preferred certain women to others.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the members of a tribe, practising some form of\r\nmarriage, to spread over an unoccupied continent, they would soon split\r\nup into distinct hordes, separated from each other by various barriers,\r\nand still more effectually by the incessant wars between all barbarous\r\nnations. The hordes would thus be exposed to slightly different\r\nconditions and habits of life, and would sooner or later come to differ\r\nin some small degree. As soon as this occurred, each isolated tribe\r\nwould form for itself a slightly different standard of beauty (19. An\r\ningenious writer argues, from a comparison of the pictures of Raphael,\r\nRubens, and modern French artists, that the idea of beauty is not\r\nabsolutely the same even throughout Europe: see the ‘Lives of Haydn and\r\nMozart,’ by Bombet (otherwise M. Beyle), English translation, p. 278.);\r\nand then unconscious selection would come into action through the more\r\npowerful and leading men preferring certain women to others. Thus the\r\ndifferences between the tribes, at first very slight, would gradually\r\nand inevitably be more or less increased.\r\n\r\nWith animals in a state of nature, many characters proper to the males,\r\nsuch as size, strength, special weapons, courage and pugnacity, have\r\nbeen acquired through the law of battle. The semi-human progenitors of\r\nman, like their allies the Quadrumana, will almost certainly have been\r\nthus modified; and, as savages still fight for the possession of their\r\nwomen, a similar process of selection has probably gone on in a greater\r\nor less degree to the present day. Other characters proper to the males\r\nof the lower animals, such as bright colours and various ornaments,\r\nhave been acquired by the more attractive males having been preferred\r\nby the females. There are, however, exceptional cases in which the\r\nmales are the selectors, instead of having been the selected. We\r\nrecognise such cases by the females being more highly ornamented than\r\nthe males,—their ornamental characters having been transmitted\r\nexclusively or chiefly to their female offspring. One such case has\r\nbeen described in the order to which man belongs, that of the Rhesus\r\nmonkey.\r\n\r\nMan is more powerful in body and mind than woman, and in the savage\r\nstate he keeps her in a far more abject state of bondage than does the\r\nmale of any other animal; therefore it is not surprising that he should\r\nhave gained the power of selection. Women are everywhere conscious of\r\nthe value of their own beauty; and when they have the means, they take\r\nmore delight in decorating themselves with all sorts of ornaments than\r\ndo men. They borrow the plumes of male birds, with which nature has\r\ndecked this sex, in order to charm the females. As women have long been\r\nselected for beauty, it is not surprising that some of their successive\r\nvariations should have been transmitted exclusively to the same sex;\r\nconsequently that they should have transmitted beauty in a somewhat\r\nhigher degree to their female than to their male offspring, and thus\r\nhave become more beautiful, according to general opinion, than men.\r\nWomen, however, certainly transmit most of their characters, including\r\nsome beauty, to their offspring of both sexes; so that the continued\r\npreference by the men of each race for the more attractive women,\r\naccording to their standard of taste, will have tended to modify in the\r\nsame manner all the individuals of both sexes belonging to the race.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other form of sexual selection (which with the\r\nlower animals is much the more common), namely, when the females are\r\nthe selectors, and accept only those males which excite or charm them\r\nmost, we have reason to believe that it formerly acted on our\r\nprogenitors. Man in all probability owes his beard, and perhaps some\r\nother characters, to inheritance from an ancient progenitor who thus\r\ngained his ornaments. But this form of selection may have occasionally\r\nacted during later times; for in utterly barbarous tribes the women\r\nhave more power in choosing, rejecting, and tempting their lovers, or\r\nof afterwards changing their husbands, than might have been expected.\r\nAs this is a point of some importance, I will give in detail such\r\nevidence as I have been able to collect.\r\n\r\nHearne describes how a woman in one of the tribes of Arctic America\r\nrepeatedly ran away from her husband and joined her lover; and with the\r\nCharruas of S. America, according to Azara, divorce is quite optional.\r\nAmongst the Abipones, a man on choosing a wife bargains with the\r\nparents about the price. But “it frequently happens that the girl\r\nrescinds what has been agreed upon between the parents and the\r\nbridegroom, obstinately rejecting the very mention of marriage.” She\r\noften runs away, hides herself, and thus eludes the bridegroom. Captain\r\nMusters who lived with the Patagonians, says that their marriages are\r\nalways settled by inclination; “if the parents make a match contrary to\r\nthe daughter’s will, she refuses and is never compelled to comply.” In\r\nTierra del Fuego a young man first obtains the consent of the parents\r\nby doing them some service, and then he attempts to carry off the girl;\r\n“but if she is unwilling, she hides herself in the woods until her\r\nadmirer is heartily tired of looking for her, and gives up the pursuit;\r\nbut this seldom happens.” In the Fiji Islands the man seizes on the\r\nwoman whom he wishes for his wife by actual or pretended force; but “on\r\nreaching the home of her abductor, should she not approve of the match,\r\nshe runs to some one who can protect her; if, however, she is\r\nsatisfied, the matter is settled forthwith.” With the Kalmucks there is\r\na regular race between the bride and bridegroom, the former having a\r\nfair start; and Clarke “was assured that no instance occurs of a girl\r\nbeing caught, unless she has a partiality to the pursuer.” Amongst the\r\nwild tribes of the Malay Archipelago there is also a racing match; and\r\nit appears from M. Bourien’s account, as Sir J. Lubbock remarks, that\r\n“the race, ‘is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,’ but to\r\nthe young man who has the good fortune to please his intended bride.” A\r\nsimilar custom, with the same result, prevails with the Koraks of\r\nNorth-Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nTurning to Africa: the Kafirs buy their wives, and girls are severely\r\nbeaten by their fathers if they will not accept a chosen husband; but\r\nit is manifest from many facts given by the Rev. Mr. Shooter, that they\r\nhave considerable power of choice. Thus very ugly, though rich men,\r\nhave been known to fail in getting wives. The girls, before consenting\r\nto be betrothed, compel the men to shew themselves off first in front\r\nand then behind, and “exhibit their paces.” They have been known to\r\npropose to a man, and they not rarely run away with a favoured lover.\r\nSo again, Mr. Leslie, who was intimately acquainted with the Kafirs,\r\nsays, “it is a mistake to imagine that a girl is sold by her father in\r\nthe same manner, and with the same authority, with which he would\r\ndispose of a cow.” Amongst the degraded Bushmen of S. Africa, “when a\r\ngirl has grown up to womanhood without having been betrothed, which,\r\nhowever, does not often happen, her lover must gain her approbation, as\r\nwell as that of the parents.” (20.

Mr. Winwood Reade made inquiries for me with respect\r\nto the negroes of Western Africa, and he informs me that “the women, at\r\nleast among the more intelligent Pagan tribes, have no difficulty in\r\ngetting the husbands whom they may desire, although it is considered\r\nunwomanly to ask a man to marry them. They are quite capable of falling\r\nin love, and of forming tender, passionate, and faithful attachments.”\r\nAdditional cases could be given.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that with savages the women are not in quite so abject a\r\nstate in relation to marriage as has often been supposed. They can\r\ntempt the men whom they prefer, and can sometimes reject those whom\r\nthey dislike, either before or after marriage. Preference on the part\r\nof the women, steadily acting in any one direction, would ultimately\r\naffect the character of the tribe; for the women would generally choose\r\nnot merely the handsomest men, according to their standard of taste,\r\nbut those who were at the same time best able to defend and support\r\nthem. Such well-endowed pairs would commonly rear a larger number of\r\noffspring than the less favoured. The same result would obviously\r\nfollow in a still more marked manner if there was selection on both\r\nsides; that is, if the more attractive, and at the same time more\r\npowerful men were to prefer, and were preferred by, the more attractive\r\nwomen. And this double form of selection seems actually to have\r\noccurred, especially during the earlier periods of our long history.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine a little more closely some of the characters which\r\ndistinguish the several races of man from one another and from the\r\nlower animals, namely, the greater or less deficiency of hair on the\r\nbody, and the colour of the skin. We need say nothing about the great\r\ndiversity in the shape of the features and of the skull between the\r\ndifferent races, as we have seen in the last chapter how different is\r\nthe standard of beauty in these respects. These characters will\r\ntherefore probably have been acted on through sexual selection; but we\r\nhave no means of judging whether they have been acted on chiefly from\r\nthe male or female side. The musical faculties of man have likewise\r\nbeen already discussed.\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF HAIR ON THE BODY, AND ITS DEVELOPMENT ON THE FACE AND HEAD.\r\n\r\nFrom the presence of the woolly hair or lanugo on the human foetus, and\r\nof rudimentary hairs scattered over the body during maturity, we may\r\ninfer that man is descended from some animal which was born hairy and\r\nremained so during life. The loss of hair is an inconvenience and\r\nprobably an injury to man, even in a hot climate, for he is thus\r\nexposed to the scorching of the sun, and to sudden chills, especially\r\nduring wet weather. As Mr. Wallace remarks, the natives in all\r\ncountries are glad to protect their naked backs and shoulders with some\r\nslight covering. No one supposes that the nakedness of the skin is any\r\ndirect advantage to man; his body therefore cannot have been divested\r\nof hair through natural selection. (21. ‘Contributions to the Theory of\r\nNatural Selection,’ 1870, p. 346. Mr. Wallace believes (p. 350) “that\r\nsome intelligent power has guided or determined the development of\r\nman”; and he considers the hairless condition of the skin as coming\r\nunder this head. The Rev. T.R. Stebbing, in commenting on this view\r\n(‘Transactions of Devonshire Association for Science,’ 1870) remarks,\r\nthat had Mr. Wallace “employed his usual ingenuity on the question of\r\nman’s hairless skin, he might have seen the possibility of its\r\nselection through its superior beauty or the health attaching to\r\nsuperior cleanliness.”) Nor, as shewn in a former chapter, have we any\r\nevidence that this can be due to the direct action of climate, or that\r\nit is the result of correlated development.\r\n\r\nThe absence of hair on the body is to a certain extent a secondary\r\nsexual character; for in all parts of the world women are less hairy\r\nthan men. Therefore we may reasonably suspect that this character has\r\nbeen gained through sexual selection. We know that the faces of several\r\nspecies of monkeys, and large surfaces at the posterior end of the body\r\nof other species, have been denuded of hair; and this we may safely\r\nattribute to sexual selection, for these surfaces are not only vividly\r\ncoloured, but sometimes, as with the male mandrill and female rhesus,\r\nmuch more vividly in the one sex than in the other, especially during\r\nthe breeding-season. I am informed by Mr. Bartlett that, as these\r\nanimals gradually reach maturity, the naked surfaces grow larger\r\ncompared with the size of their bodies. The hair, however, appears to\r\nhave been removed, not for the sake of nudity, but that the colour of\r\nthe skin may be more fully displayed. So again with many birds, it\r\nappears as if the head and neck had been divested of feathers through\r\nsexual selection, to exhibit the brightly-coloured skin.\r\n\r\nAs the body in woman is less hairy than in man, and as this character\r\nis common to all races, we may conclude that it was our female\r\nsemi-human ancestors who were first divested of hair, and that this\r\noccurred at an extremely remote period before the several races had\r\ndiverged from a common stock. Whilst our female ancestors were\r\ngradually acquiring this new character of nudity, they must have\r\ntransmitted it almost equally to their offspring of both sexes whilst\r\nyoung; so that its transmission, as with the ornaments of many mammals\r\nand birds, has not been limited either by sex or age. There is nothing\r\nsurprising in a partial loss of hair having been esteemed as an\r\nornament by our ape-like progenitors, for we have seen that innumerable\r\nstrange characters have been thus esteemed by animals of all kinds, and\r\nhave consequently been gained through sexual selection. Nor is it\r\nsurprising that a slightly injurious character should have been thus\r\nacquired; for we know that this is the case with the plumes of certain\r\nbirds, and with the horns of certain stags.\r\n\r\nThe females of some of the anthropoid apes, as stated in a former\r\nchapter, are somewhat less hairy on the under surface than the males;\r\nand here we have what might have afforded a commencement for the\r\nprocess of denudation. With respect to the completion of the process\r\nthrough sexual selection, it is well to bear in mind the New Zealand\r\nproverb, “There is no woman for a hairy man.” All who have seen\r\nphotographs of the Siamese hairy family will admit how ludicrously\r\nhideous is the opposite extreme of excessive hairiness. And the king of\r\nSiam had to bribe a man to marry the first hairy woman in the family;\r\nand she transmitted this character to her young offspring of both\r\nsexes. (22. The ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,’\r\nvol. ii. 1868, p. 237.)\r\n\r\nSome races are much more hairy than others, especially the males; but\r\nit must not be assumed that the more hairy races, such as the European,\r\nhave retained their primordial condition more completely than the naked\r\nraces, such as the Kalmucks or Americans. It is more probable that the\r\nhairiness of the former is due to partial reversion; for characters\r\nwhich have been at some former period long inherited are always apt to\r\nreturn. We have seen that idiots are often very hairy, and they are apt\r\nto revert in other characters to a lower animal type. It does not\r\nappear that a cold climate has been influential in leading to this kind\r\nof reversion; excepting perhaps with the negroes, who have been reared\r\nduring several generations in the United States (23. ‘Investigations\r\ninto Military and Anthropological Statistics of American Soldiers,’ by\r\nB.A. Gould, 1869, p. 568:—Observations were carefully made on the\r\nhairiness of 2129 black and coloured soldiers, whilst they were\r\nbathing; and by looking to the published table, “it is manifest at a\r\nglance that there is but little, if any, difference between the white\r\nand the black races in this respect.” It is, however, certain that\r\nnegroes in their native and much hotter land of Africa, have remarkably\r\nsmooth bodies. It should be particularly observed, that both pure\r\nblacks and mulattoes were included in the above enumeration; and this\r\nis an unfortunate circumstance, as in accordance with a principle, the\r\ntruth of which I have elsewhere proved, crossed races of man would be\r\neminently liable to revert to the primordial hairy character of their\r\nearly ape-like progenitors.), and possibly with the Ainos, who inhabit\r\nthe northern islands of the Japan archipelago. But the laws of\r\ninheritance are so complex that we can seldom understand their action.\r\nIf the greater hairiness of certain races be the result of reversion,\r\nunchecked by any form of selection, its extreme variability, even\r\nwithin the limits of the same race, ceases to be remarkable. (24.\r\nHardly any view advanced in this work has met with so much disfavour\r\n(see for instance, Sprengel, ‘Die Fortschritte des Darwinismus,’ 1874,\r\np. 80) as the above explanation of the loss of hair in mankind through\r\nsexual selection; but none of the opposed arguments seem to me of much\r\nweight, in comparison with the facts shewing that the nudity of the\r\nskin is to a certain extent a secondary sexual character in man and in\r\nsome of the Quadrumana.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the beard in man, if we turn to our best guide, the\r\nQuadrumana, we find beards equally developed in both sexes of many\r\nspecies, but in some, either confined to the males, or more developed\r\nin them than in the females. From this fact and from the curious\r\narrangement, as well as the bright colours of the hair about the heads\r\nof many monkeys, it is highly probable, as before explained, that the\r\nmales first acquired their beards through sexual selection as an\r\nornament, transmitting them in most cases, equally or nearly so, to\r\ntheir offspring of both sexes. We know from Eschricht (25. ‘Ueber die\r\nRichtung der Haare am Menschlichen Körper,’ in Müller’s ‘Archiv. für\r\nAnat. und Phys.’ 1837, s. 40.) that with mankind the female as well as\r\nthe male foetus is furnished with much hair on the face, especially\r\nround the mouth; and this indicates that we are descended from\r\nprogenitors of whom both sexes were bearded. It appears therefore at\r\nfirst sight probable that man has retained his beard from a very early\r\nperiod, whilst woman lost her beard at the same time that her body\r\nbecame almost completely divested of hair. Even the colour of our\r\nbeards seems to have been inherited from an ape-like progenitor; for\r\nwhen there is any difference in tint between the hair of the head and\r\nthe beard, the latter is lighter coloured in all monkeys and in man. In\r\nthose Quadrumana in which the male has a larger beard than that of the\r\nfemale, it is fully developed only at maturity, just as with mankind;\r\nand it is possible that only the later stages of development have been\r\nretained by man. In opposition to this view of the retention of the\r\nbeard from an early period is the fact of its great variability in\r\ndifferent races, and even within the same race; for this indicates\r\nreversion,—long lost characters being very apt to vary on\r\nre-appearance.\r\n\r\nNor must we overlook the part which sexual selection may have played in\r\nlater times; for we know that with savages the men of the beardless\r\nraces take infinite pains in eradicating every hair from their faces as\r\nsomething odious, whilst the men of the bearded races feel the greatest\r\npride in their beards. The women, no doubt, participate in these\r\nfeelings, and if so sexual selection can hardly have failed to have\r\neffected something in the course of later times. It is also possible\r\nthat the long-continued habit of eradicating the hair may have produced\r\nan inherited effect. Dr. Brown-Sequard has shewn that if certain\r\nanimals are operated on in a particular manner, their offspring are\r\naffected. Further evidence could be given of the inheritance of the\r\neffects of mutilations; but a fact lately ascertained by Mr. Salvin\r\n(26. On the tail-feathers of Motmots, ‘Proceedings of the Zoological\r\nSociety,’ 1873, p. 429.) has a more direct bearing on the present\r\nquestion; for he has shewn that the motmots, which are known habitually\r\nto bite off the barbs of the two central tail-feathers, have the barbs\r\nof these feathers naturally somewhat reduced. (27. Mr. Sproat has\r\nsuggested (‘Scenes and Studies of Savage Life,’ 1868, p. 25) this same\r\nview. Some distinguished ethnologists, amongst others M. Gosse of\r\nGeneva, believe that artificial modifications of the skull tend to be\r\ninherited.) Nevertheless, with mankind the habit of eradicating the\r\nbeard and the hairs on the body would probably not have arisen until\r\nthese had already become by some means reduced.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to form any judgment as to how the hair on the head\r\nbecame developed to its present great length in many races. Eschricht\r\n(28. ‘Ueber die Richtung,’ ibid. s. 40.) states that in the human\r\nfoetus the hair on the face during the fifth month is longer than that\r\non the head; and this indicates that our semi-human progenitors were\r\nnot furnished with long tresses, which must therefore have been a late\r\nacquisition. This is likewise indicated by the extraordinary difference\r\nin the length of the hair in the different races; in the negro the hair\r\nforms a mere curly mat; with us it is of great length, and with the\r\nAmerican natives it not rarely reaches to the ground. Some species of\r\nSemnopithecus have their heads covered with moderately long hair, and\r\nthis probably serves as an ornament and was acquired through sexual\r\nselection. The same view may perhaps be extended to mankind, for we\r\nknow that long tresses are now and were formerly much admired, as may\r\nbe observed in the works of almost every poet; St. Paul says, “if a\r\nwoman have long hair, it is a glory to her;” and we have seen that in\r\nNorth America a chief was elected solely from the length of his hair.\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nThe best kind of evidence that in man the colour of the skin has been\r\nmodified through sexual selection is scanty; for in most races the\r\nsexes do not differ in this respect, and only slightly, as we have\r\nseen, in others. We know, however, from the many facts already given\r\nthat the colour of the skin is regarded by the men of all races as a\r\nhighly important element in their beauty; so that it is a character\r\nwhich would be likely to have been modified through selection, as has\r\noccurred in innumerable instances with the lower animals. It seems at\r\nfirst sight a monstrous supposition that the jet-blackness of the negro\r\nshould have been gained through sexual selection; but this view is\r\nsupported by various analogies, and we know that negroes admire their\r\nown colour. With mammals, when the sexes differ in colour, the male is\r\noften black or much darker than the female; and it depends merely on\r\nthe form of inheritance whether this or any other tint is transmitted\r\nto both sexes or to one alone. The resemblance to a negro in miniature\r\nof Pithecia satanas with his jet black skin, white rolling eyeballs,\r\nand hair parted on the top of the head, is almost ludicrous.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the face differs much more widely in the various kinds of\r\nmonkeys than it does in the races of man; and we have some reason to\r\nbelieve that the red, blue, orange, almost white and black tints of\r\ntheir skin, even when common to both sexes, as well as the bright\r\ncolours of their fur, and the ornamental tufts about the head, have all\r\nbeen acquired through sexual selection. As the order of development\r\nduring growth, generally indicates the order in which the characters of\r\na species have been developed and modified during previous generations;\r\nand as the newly-born infants of the various races of man do not differ\r\nnearly as much in colour as do the adults, although their bodies are as\r\ncompletely destitute of hair, we have some slight evidence that the\r\ntints of the different races were acquired at a period subsequent to\r\nthe removal of the hair, which must have occurred at a very early\r\nperiod in the history of man.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude that the greater size, strength, courage, pugnacity,\r\nand energy of man, in comparison with woman, were acquired during\r\nprimeval times, and have subsequently been augmented, chiefly through\r\nthe contests of rival males for the possession of the females. The\r\ngreater intellectual vigour and power of invention in man is probably\r\ndue to natural selection, combined with the inherited effects of habit,\r\nfor the most able men will have succeeded best in defending and\r\nproviding for themselves and for their wives and offspring. As far as\r\nthe extreme intricacy of the subject permits us to judge, it appears\r\nthat our male ape-like progenitors acquired their beards as an ornament\r\nto charm or excite the opposite sex, and transmitted them only to their\r\nmale offspring. The females apparently first had their bodies denuded\r\nof hair, also as a sexual ornament; but they transmitted this character\r\nalmost equally to both sexes. It is not improbable that the females\r\nwere modified in other respects for the same purpose and by the same\r\nmeans; so that women have acquired sweeter voices and become more\r\nbeautiful than men.\r\n\r\nIt deserves attention that with mankind the conditions were in many\r\nrespects much more favourable for sexual selection, during a very early\r\nperiod, when man had only just attained to the rank of manhood, than\r\nduring later times. For he would then, as we may safely conclude, have\r\nbeen guided more by his instinctive passions, and less by foresight or\r\nreason. He would have jealously guarded his wife or wives. He would not\r\nhave practised infanticide; nor valued his wives merely as useful\r\nslaves; nor have been betrothed to them during infancy. Hence we may\r\ninfer that the races of men were differentiated, as far as sexual\r\nselection is concerned, in chief part at a very remote epoch; and this\r\nconclusion throws light on the remarkable fact that at the most ancient\r\nperiod, of which we have not as yet any record, the races of man had\r\nalready come to differ nearly or quite as much as they do at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe views here advanced, on the part which sexual selection has played\r\nin the history of man, want scientific precision. He who does not admit\r\nthis agency in the case of the lower animals, will disregard all that I\r\nhave written in the later chapters on man. We cannot positively say\r\nthat this character, but not that, has been thus modified; it has,\r\nhowever, been shewn that the races of man differ from each other and\r\nfrom their nearest allies, in certain characters which are of no\r\nservice to them in their daily habits of life, and which it is\r\nextremely probable would have been modified through sexual selection.\r\nWe have seen that with the lowest savages the people of each tribe\r\nadmire their own characteristic qualities,—the shape of the head and\r\nface, the squareness of the cheek-bones, the prominence or depression\r\nof the nose, the colour of the skin, the length of the hair on the\r\nhead, the absence of hair on the face and body, or the presence of a\r\ngreat beard, and so forth. Hence these and other such points could\r\nhardly fail to be slowly and gradually exaggerated, from the more\r\npowerful and able men in each tribe, who would succeed in rearing the\r\nlargest number of offspring, having selected during many generations\r\nfor their wives the most strongly characterised and therefore most\r\nattractive women. For my own part I conclude that of all the causes\r\nwhich have led to the differences in external appearance between the\r\nraces of man, and to a certain extent between man and the lower\r\nanimals, sexual selection has been the most efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nGENERAL A SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain conclusion that man is descended from some lower form—Manner of\r\ndevelopment—Genealogy of man—Intellectual and moral faculties—Sexual\r\nSelection—Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\nA brief summary will be sufficient to recall to the reader’s mind the\r\nmore salient points in this work. Many of the views which have been\r\nadvanced are highly speculative, and some no doubt will prove\r\nerroneous; but I have in every case given the reasons which have led me\r\nto one view rather than to another. It seemed worth while to try how\r\nfar the principle of evolution would throw light on some of the more\r\ncomplex problems in the natural history of man. False facts are highly\r\ninjurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but\r\nfalse views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every\r\none takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness: and when this\r\nis done, one path towards error is closed and the road to truth is\r\noften at the same time opened.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusion here arrived at, and now held by many naturalists\r\nwho are well competent to form a sound judgment, is that man is\r\ndescended from some less highly organised form. The grounds upon which\r\nthis conclusion rests will never be shaken, for the close similarity\r\nbetween man and the lower animals in embryonic development, as well as\r\nin innumerable points of structure and constitution, both of high and\r\nof the most trifling importance,—the rudiments which he retains, and\r\nthe abnormal reversions to which he is occasionally liable,—are facts\r\nwhich cannot be disputed. They have long been known, but until recently\r\nthey told us nothing with respect to the origin of man. Now when viewed\r\nby the light of our knowledge of the whole organic world, their meaning\r\nis unmistakable. The great principle of evolution stands up clear and\r\nfirm, when these groups or facts are considered in connection with\r\nothers, such as the mutual affinities of the members of the same group,\r\ntheir geographical distribution in past and present times, and their\r\ngeological succession. It is incredible that all these facts should\r\nspeak falsely. He who is not content to look, like a savage, at the\r\nphenomena of nature as disconnected, cannot any longer believe that man\r\nis the work of a separate act of creation. He will be forced to admit\r\nthat the close resemblance of the embryo of man to that, for instance,\r\nof a dog—the construction of his skull, limbs and whole frame on the\r\nsame plan with that of other mammals, independently of the uses to\r\nwhich the parts may be put—the occasional re-appearance of various\r\nstructures, for instance of several muscles, which man does not\r\nnormally possess, but which are common to the Quadrumana—and a crowd of\r\nanalogous facts—all point in the plainest manner to the conclusion that\r\nman is the co-descendant with other mammals of a common progenitor.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that man incessantly presents individual differences in\r\nall parts of his body and in his mental faculties. These differences or\r\nvariations seem to be induced by the same general causes, and to obey\r\nthe same laws as with the lower animals. In both cases similar laws of\r\ninheritance prevail. Man tends to increase at a greater rate than his\r\nmeans of subsistence; consequently he is occasionally subjected to a\r\nsevere struggle for existence, and natural selection will have effected\r\nwhatever lies within its scope. A succession of strongly-marked\r\nvariations of a similar nature is by no means requisite; slight\r\nfluctuating differences in the individual suffice for the work of\r\nnatural selection; not that we have any reason to suppose that in the\r\nsame species, all parts of the organisation tend to vary to the same\r\ndegree. We may feel assured that the inherited effects of the\r\nlong-continued use or disuse of parts will have done much in the same\r\ndirection with natural selection. Modifications formerly of importance,\r\nthough no longer of any special use, are long-inherited. When one part\r\nis modified, other parts change through the principle of correlation,\r\nof which we have instances in many curious cases of correlated\r\nmonstrosities. Something may be attributed to the direct and definite\r\naction of the surrounding conditions of life, such as abundant food,\r\nheat or moisture; and lastly, many characters of slight physiological\r\nimportance, some indeed of considerable importance, have been gained\r\nthrough sexual selection.\r\n\r\nNo doubt man, as well as every other animal, presents structures, which\r\nseem to our limited knowledge, not to be now of any service to him, nor\r\nto have been so formerly, either for the general conditions of life, or\r\nin the relations of one sex to the other. Such structures cannot be\r\naccounted for by any form of selection, or by the inherited effects of\r\nthe use and disuse of parts. We know, however, that many strange and\r\nstrongly-marked peculiarities of structure occasionally appear in our\r\ndomesticated productions, and if their unknown causes were to act more\r\nuniformly, they would probably become common to all the individuals of\r\nthe species. We may hope hereafter to understand something about the\r\ncauses of such occasional modifications, especially through the study\r\nof monstrosities: hence the labours of experimentalists, such as those\r\nof M. Camille Dareste, are full of promise for the future. In general\r\nwe can only say that the cause of each slight variation and of each\r\nmonstrosity lies much more in the constitution of the organism, than in\r\nthe nature of the surrounding conditions; though new and changed\r\nconditions certainly play an important part in exciting organic changes\r\nof many kinds.\r\n\r\nThrough the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet\r\nundiscovered, man has been raised to his present state. But since he\r\nattained to the rank of manhood, he has diverged into distinct races,\r\nor as they may be more fitly called, sub-species. Some of these, such\r\nas the Negro and European, are so distinct that, if specimens had been\r\nbrought to a naturalist without any further information, they would\r\nundoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species.\r\nNevertheless all the races agree in so many unimportant details of\r\nstructure and in so many mental peculiarities that these can be\r\naccounted for only by inheritance from a common progenitor; and a\r\nprogenitor thus characterised would probably deserve to rank as man.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the divergence of each race from the other\r\nraces, and of all from a common stock, can be traced back to any one\r\npair of progenitors. On the contrary, at every stage in the process of\r\nmodification, all the individuals which were in any way better fitted\r\nfor their conditions of life, though in different degrees, would have\r\nsurvived in greater numbers than the less well-fitted. The process\r\nwould have been like that followed by man, when he does not\r\nintentionally select particular individuals, but breeds from all the\r\nsuperior individuals, and neglects the inferior. He thus slowly but\r\nsurely modifies his stock, and unconsciously forms a new strain. So\r\nwith respect to modifications acquired independently of selection, and\r\ndue to variations arising from the nature of the organism and the\r\naction of the surrounding conditions, or from changed habits of life,\r\nno single pair will have been modified much more than the other pairs\r\ninhabiting the same country, for all will have been continually blended\r\nthrough free intercrossing.\r\n\r\nBy considering the embryological structure of man,—the homologies which\r\nhe presents with the lower animals,—the rudiments which he retains,—and\r\nthe reversions to which he is liable, we can partly recall in\r\nimagination the former condition of our early progenitors; and can\r\napproximately place them in their proper place in the zoological\r\nseries. We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy, tailed\r\nquadruped, probably arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant of the\r\nOld World. This creature, if its whole structure had been examined by a\r\nnaturalist, would have been classed amongst the Quadrumana, as surely\r\nas the still more ancient progenitor of the Old and New World monkeys.\r\nThe Quadrumana and all the higher mammals are probably derived from an\r\nancient marsupial animal, and this through a long line of diversified\r\nforms, from some amphibian-like creature, and this again from some\r\nfish-like animal. In the dim obscurity of the past we can see that the\r\nearly progenitor of all the Vertebrata must have been an aquatic\r\nanimal, provided with branchiae, with the two sexes united in the same\r\nindividual, and with the most important organs of the body (such as the\r\nbrain and heart) imperfectly or not at all developed. This animal seems\r\nto have been more like the larvae of the existing marine Ascidians than\r\nany other known form.\r\n\r\nThe high standard of our intellectual powers and moral disposition is\r\nthe greatest difficulty which presents itself, after we have been\r\ndriven to this conclusion on the origin of man. But every one who\r\nadmits the principle of evolution, must see that the mental powers of\r\nthe higher animals, which are the same in kind with those of man,\r\nthough so different in degree, are capable of advancement. Thus the\r\ninterval between the mental powers of one of the higher apes and of a\r\nfish, or between those of an ant and scale-insect, is immense; yet\r\ntheir development does not offer any special difficulty; for with our\r\ndomesticated animals, the mental faculties are certainly variable, and\r\nthe variations are inherited. No one doubts that they are of the utmost\r\nimportance to animals in a state of nature. Therefore the conditions\r\nare favourable for their development through natural selection. The\r\nsame conclusion may be extended to man; the intellect must have been\r\nall-important to him, even at a very remote period, as enabling him to\r\ninvent and use language, to make weapons, tools, traps, etc., whereby\r\nwith the aid of his social habits, he long ago became the most dominant\r\nof all living creatures.\r\n\r\nA great stride in the development of the intellect will have followed,\r\nas soon as the half-art and half-instinct of language came into use;\r\nfor the continued use of language will have reacted on the brain and\r\nproduced an inherited effect; and this again will have reacted on the\r\nimprovement of language. As Mr. Chauncey Wright (1. ‘On the Limits of\r\nNatural Selection,’ in the ‘North American Review,’ Oct. 1870, p. 295.)\r\nhas well remarked, the largeness of the brain in man relatively to his\r\nbody, compared with the lower animals, may be attributed in chief part\r\nto the early use of some simple form of language,—that wonderful engine\r\nwhich affixes signs to all sorts of objects and qualities, and excites\r\ntrains of thought which would never arise from the mere impression of\r\nthe senses, or if they did arise could not be followed out. The higher\r\nintellectual powers of man, such as those of ratiocination,\r\nabstraction, self-consciousness, etc., probably follow from the\r\ncontinued improvement and exercise of the other mental faculties.\r\n\r\nThe development of the moral qualities is a more interesting problem.\r\nThe foundation lies in the social instincts, including under this term\r\nthe family ties. These instincts are highly complex, and in the case of\r\nthe lower animals give special tendencies towards certain definite\r\nactions; but the more important elements are love, and the distinct\r\nemotion of sympathy. Animals endowed with the social instincts take\r\npleasure in one another’s company, warn one another of danger, defend\r\nand aid one another in many ways. These instincts do not extend to all\r\nthe individuals of the species, but only to those of the same\r\ncommunity. As they are highly beneficial to the species, they have in\r\nall probability been acquired through natural selection.\r\n\r\nA moral being is one who is capable of reflecting on his past actions\r\nand their motives—of approving of some and disapproving of others; and\r\nthe fact that man is the one being who certainly deserves this\r\ndesignation, is the greatest of all distinctions between him and the\r\nlower animals. But in the fourth chapter I have endeavoured to shew\r\nthat the moral sense follows, firstly, from the enduring and\r\never-present nature of the social instincts; secondly, from man’s\r\nappreciation of the approbation and disapprobation of his fellows; and\r\nthirdly, from the high activity of his mental faculties, with past\r\nimpressions extremely vivid; and in these latter respects he differs\r\nfrom the lower animals. Owing to this condition of mind, man cannot\r\navoid looking both backwards and forwards, and comparing past\r\nimpressions. Hence after some temporary desire or passion has mastered\r\nhis social instincts, he reflects and compares the now weakened\r\nimpression of such past impulses with the ever-present social\r\ninstincts; and he then feels that sense of dissatisfaction which all\r\nunsatisfied instincts leave behind them, he therefore resolves to act\r\ndifferently for the future,—and this is conscience. Any instinct,\r\npermanently stronger or more enduring than another, gives rise to a\r\nfeeling which we express by saying that it ought to be obeyed. A\r\npointer dog, if able to reflect on his past conduct, would say to\r\nhimself, I ought (as indeed we say of him) to have pointed at that hare\r\nand not have yielded to the passing temptation of hunting it.\r\n\r\nSocial animals are impelled partly by a wish to aid the members of\r\ntheir community in a general manner, but more commonly to perform\r\ncertain definite actions. Man is impelled by the same general wish to\r\naid his fellows; but has few or no special instincts. He differs also\r\nfrom the lower animals in the power of expressing his desires by words,\r\nwhich thus become a guide to the aid required and bestowed. The motive\r\nto give aid is likewise much modified in man: it no longer consists\r\nsolely of a blind instinctive impulse, but is much influenced by the\r\npraise or blame of his fellows. The appreciation and the bestowal of\r\npraise and blame both rest on sympathy; and this emotion, as we have\r\nseen, is one of the most important elements of the social instincts.\r\nSympathy, though gained as an instinct, is also much strengthened by\r\nexercise or habit. As all men desire their own happiness, praise or\r\nblame is bestowed on actions and motives, according as they lead to\r\nthis end; and as happiness is an essential part of the general good,\r\nthe greatest-happiness principle indirectly serves as a nearly safe\r\nstandard of right and wrong. As the reasoning powers advance and\r\nexperience is gained, the remoter effects of certain lines of conduct\r\non the character of the individual, and on the general good, are\r\nperceived; and then the self-regarding virtues come within the scope of\r\npublic opinion, and receive praise, and their opposites blame. But with\r\nthe less civilised nations reason often errs, and many bad customs and\r\nbase superstitions come within the same scope, and are then esteemed as\r\nhigh virtues, and their breach as heavy crimes.\r\n\r\nThe moral faculties are generally and justly esteemed as of higher\r\nvalue than the intellectual powers. But we should bear in mind that the\r\nactivity of the mind in vividly recalling past impressions is one of\r\nthe fundamental though secondary bases of conscience. This affords the\r\nstrongest argument for educating and stimulating in all possible ways\r\nthe intellectual faculties of every human being. No doubt a man with a\r\ntorpid mind, if his social affections and sympathies are well\r\ndeveloped, will be led to good actions, and may have a fairly sensitive\r\nconscience. But whatever renders the imagination more vivid and\r\nstrengthens the habit of recalling and comparing past impressions, will\r\nmake the conscience more sensitive, and may even somewhat compensate\r\nfor weak social affections and sympathies.\r\n\r\nThe moral nature of man has reached its present standard, partly\r\nthrough the advancement of his reasoning powers and consequently of a\r\njust public opinion, but especially from his sympathies having been\r\nrendered more tender and widely diffused through the effects of habit,\r\nexample, instruction, and reflection. It is not improbable that after\r\nlong practice virtuous tendencies may be inherited. With the more\r\ncivilised races, the conviction of the existence of an all-seeing Deity\r\nhas had a potent influence on the advance of morality. Ultimately man\r\ndoes not accept the praise or blame of his fellows as his sole guide,\r\nthough few escape this influence, but his habitual convictions,\r\ncontrolled by reason, afford him the safest rule. His conscience then\r\nbecomes the supreme judge and monitor. Nevertheless the first\r\nfoundation or origin of the moral sense lies in the social instincts,\r\nincluding sympathy; and these instincts no doubt were primarily gained,\r\nas in the case of the lower animals, through natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but\r\nthe most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower\r\nanimals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that\r\nthis belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief\r\nin all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and\r\napparently follows from a considerable advance in man’s reason, and\r\nfrom a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity\r\nand wonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in God has\r\nbeen used by many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is\r\na rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the\r\nexistence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more\r\npowerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a\r\nbeneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does\r\nnot seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by\r\nlong-continued culture.\r\n\r\nHe who believes in the advancement of man from some low organised form,\r\nwill naturally ask how does this bear on the belief in the immortality\r\nof the soul. The barbarous races of man, as Sir J. Lubbock has shewn,\r\npossess no clear belief of this kind; but arguments derived from the\r\nprimeval beliefs of savages are, as we have just seen, of little or no\r\navail. Few persons feel any anxiety from the impossibility of\r\ndetermining at what precise period in the development of the\r\nindividual, from the first trace of a minute germinal vesicle, man\r\nbecomes an immortal being; and there is no greater cause for anxiety\r\nbecause the period cannot possibly be determined in the gradually\r\nascending organic scale. (2. The Rev. J.A. Picton gives a discussion to\r\nthis effect in his ‘New Theories and the Old Faith,’ 1870.)\r\n\r\nI am aware that the conclusions arrived at in this work will be\r\ndenounced by some as highly irreligious; but he who denounces them is\r\nbound to shew why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of man\r\nas a distinct species by descent from some lower form, through the laws\r\nof variation and natural selection, than to explain the birth of the\r\nindividual through the laws of ordinary reproduction. The birth both of\r\nthe species and of the individual are equally parts of that grand\r\nsequence of events, which our minds refuse to accept as the result of\r\nblind chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion, whether\r\nor not we are able to believe that every slight variation of\r\nstructure,—the union of each pair in marriage, the dissemination of\r\neach seed,—and other such events, have all been ordained for some\r\nspecial purpose.\r\n\r\nSexual selection has been treated at great length in this work; for, as\r\nI have attempted to shew, it has played an important part in the\r\nhistory of the organic world. I am aware that much remains doubtful,\r\nbut I have endeavoured to give a fair view of the whole case. In the\r\nlower divisions of the animal kingdom, sexual selection seems to have\r\ndone nothing: such animals are often affixed for life to the same spot,\r\nor have the sexes combined in the same individual, or what is still\r\nmore important, their perceptive and intellectual faculties are not\r\nsufficiently advanced to allow of the feelings of love and jealousy, or\r\nof the exertion of choice. When, however, we come to the Arthropoda and\r\nVertebrata, even to the lowest classes in these two great Sub-Kingdoms,\r\nsexual selection has effected much.\r\n\r\nIn the several great classes of the animal kingdom,—in mammals, birds,\r\nreptiles, fishes, insects, and even crustaceans,—the differences\r\nbetween the sexes follow nearly the same rules. The males are almost\r\nalways the wooers; and they alone are armed with special weapons for\r\nfighting with their rivals. They are generally stronger and larger than\r\nthe females, and are endowed with the requisite qualities of courage\r\nand pugnacity. They are provided, either exclusively or in a much\r\nhigher degree than the females, with organs for vocal or instrumental\r\nmusic, and with odoriferous glands. They are ornamented with infinitely\r\ndiversified appendages, and with the most brilliant or conspicuous\r\ncolours, often arranged in elegant patterns, whilst the females are\r\nunadorned. When the sexes differ in more important structures, it is\r\nthe male which is provided with special sense-organs for discovering\r\nthe female, with locomotive organs for reaching her, and often with\r\nprehensile organs for holding her. These various structures for\r\ncharming or securing the female are often developed in the male during\r\nonly part of the year, namely the breeding-season. They have in many\r\ncases been more or less transferred to the females; and in the latter\r\ncase they often appear in her as mere rudiments. They are lost or never\r\ngained by the males after emasculation. Generally they are not\r\ndeveloped in the male during early youth, but appear a short time\r\nbefore the age for reproduction. Hence in most cases the young of both\r\nsexes resemble each other; and the female somewhat resembles her young\r\noffspring throughout life. In almost every great class a few anomalous\r\ncases occur, where there has been an almost complete transposition of\r\nthe characters proper to the two sexes; the females assuming characters\r\nwhich properly belong to the males. This surprising uniformity in the\r\nlaws regulating the differences between the sexes in so many and such\r\nwidely separated classes, is intelligible if we admit the action of one\r\ncommon cause, namely sexual selection.\r\n\r\nSexual selection depends on the success of certain individuals over\r\nothers of the same sex, in relation to the propagation of the species;\r\nwhilst natural selection depends on the success of both sexes, at all\r\nages, in relation to the general conditions of life. The sexual\r\nstruggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between individuals of the\r\nsame sex, generally the males, in order to drive away or kill their\r\nrivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the\r\nstruggle is likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order\r\nto excite or charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females,\r\nwhich no longer remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners.\r\nThis latter kind of selection is closely analogous to that which man\r\nunintentionally, yet effectually, brings to bear on his domesticated\r\nproductions, when he preserves during a long period the most pleasing\r\nor useful individuals, without any wish to modify the breed.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance determine whether characters gained through\r\nsexual selection by either sex shall be transmitted to the same sex, or\r\nto both; as well as the age at which they shall be developed. It\r\nappears that variations arising late in life are commonly transmitted\r\nto one and the same sex. Variability is the necessary basis for the\r\naction of selection, and is wholly independent of it. It follows from\r\nthis, that variations of the same general nature have often been taken\r\nadvantage of and accumulated through sexual selection in relation to\r\nthe propagation of the species, as well as through natural selection in\r\nrelation to the general purposes of life. Hence secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, when equally transmitted to both sexes can be distinguished\r\nfrom ordinary specific characters only by the light of analogy. The\r\nmodifications acquired through sexual selection are often so strongly\r\npronounced that the two sexes have frequently been ranked as distinct\r\nspecies, or even as distinct genera. Such strongly-marked differences\r\nmust be in some manner highly important; and we know that they have\r\nbeen acquired in some instances at the cost not only of inconvenience,\r\nbut of exposure to actual danger.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the power of sexual selection rests chiefly on the\r\nfollowing considerations. Certain characters are confined to one sex;\r\nand this alone renders it probable that in most cases they are\r\nconnected with the act of reproduction. In innumerable instances these\r\ncharacters are fully developed only at maturity, and often during only\r\na part of the year, which is always the breeding-season. The males\r\n(passing over a few exceptional cases) are the more active in\r\ncourtship; they are the better armed, and are rendered the more\r\nattractive in various ways. It is to be especially observed that the\r\nmales display their attractions with elaborate care in the presence of\r\nthe females; and that they rarely or never display them excepting\r\nduring the season of love. It is incredible that all this should be\r\npurposeless. Lastly we have distinct evidence with some quadrupeds and\r\nbirds, that the individuals of one sex are capable of feeling a strong\r\nantipathy or preference for certain individuals of the other sex.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind these facts, and the marked results of man’s\r\nunconscious selection, when applied to domesticated animals and\r\ncultivated plants, it seems to me almost certain that if the\r\nindividuals of one sex were during a long series of generations to\r\nprefer pairing with certain individuals of the other sex, characterised\r\nin some peculiar manner, the offspring would slowly but surely become\r\nmodified in this same manner. I have not attempted to conceal that,\r\nexcepting when the males are more numerous than the females, or when\r\npolygamy prevails, it is doubtful how the more attractive males succeed\r\nin leaving a large number of offspring to inherit their superiority in\r\nornaments or other charms than the less attractive males; but I have\r\nshewn that this would probably follow from the females,—especially the\r\nmore vigorous ones, which would be the first to breed,—preferring not\r\nonly the more attractive but at the same time the more vigorous and\r\nvictorious males.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have some positive evidence that birds appreciate bright\r\nand beautiful objects, as with the bower-birds of Australia, and\r\nalthough they certainly appreciate the power of song, yet I fully admit\r\nthat it is astonishing that the females of many birds and some mammals\r\nshould be endowed with sufficient taste to appreciate ornaments, which\r\nwe have reason to attribute to sexual selection; and this is even more\r\nastonishing in the case of reptiles, fish, and insects. But we really\r\nknow little about the minds of the lower animals. It cannot be\r\nsupposed, for instance, that male birds of paradise or peacocks should\r\ntake such pains in erecting, spreading, and vibrating their beautiful\r\nplumes before the females for no purpose. We should remember the fact\r\ngiven on excellent authority in a former chapter, that several peahens,\r\nwhen debarred from an admired male, remained widows during a whole\r\nseason rather than pair with another bird.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I know of no fact in natural history more wonderful than\r\nthat the female Argus pheasant should appreciate the exquisite shading\r\nof the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant patterns on the\r\nwing-feather of the male. He who thinks that the male was created as he\r\nnow exists must admit that the great plumes, which prevent the wings\r\nfrom being used for flight, and which are displayed during courtship\r\nand at no other time in a manner quite peculiar to this one species,\r\nwere given to him as an ornament. If so, he must likewise admit that\r\nthe female was created and endowed with the capacity of appreciating\r\nsuch ornaments. I differ only in the conviction that the male Argus\r\npheasant acquired his beauty gradually, through the preference of the\r\nfemales during many generations for the more highly ornamented males;\r\nthe aesthetic capacity of the females having been advanced through\r\nexercise or habit, just as our own taste is gradually improved. In the\r\nmale through the fortunate chance of a few feathers being left\r\nunchanged, we can distinctly trace how simple spots with a little\r\nfulvous shading on one side may have been developed by small steps into\r\nthe wonderful ball-and-socket ornaments; and it is probable that they\r\nwere actually thus developed.\r\n\r\nEveryone who admits the principle of evolution, and yet feels great\r\ndifficulty in admitting that female mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish,\r\ncould have acquired the high taste implied by the beauty of the males,\r\nand which generally coincides with our own standard, should reflect\r\nthat the nerve-cells of the brain in the highest as well as in the\r\nlowest members of the Vertebrate series, are derived from those of the\r\ncommon progenitor of this great Kingdom. For we can thus see how it has\r\ncome to pass that certain mental faculties, in various and widely\r\ndistinct groups of animals, have been developed in nearly the same\r\nmanner and to nearly the same degree.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has taken the trouble to go through the several chapters\r\ndevoted to sexual selection, will be able to judge how far the\r\nconclusions at which I have arrived are supported by sufficient\r\nevidence. If he accepts these conclusions he may, I think, safely\r\nextend them to mankind; but it would be superfluous here to repeat what\r\nI have so lately said on the manner in which sexual selection\r\napparently has acted on man, both on the male and female side, causing\r\nthe two sexes to differ in body and mind, and the several races to\r\ndiffer from each other in various characters, as well as from their\r\nancient and lowly-organised progenitors.\r\n\r\nHe who admits the principle of sexual selection will be led to the\r\nremarkable conclusion that the nervous system not only regulates most\r\nof the existing functions of the body, but has indirectly influenced\r\nthe progressive development of various bodily structures and of certain\r\nmental qualities. Courage, pugnacity, perseverance, strength and size\r\nof body, weapons of all kinds, musical organs, both vocal and\r\ninstrumental, bright colours and ornamental appendages, have all been\r\nindirectly gained by the one sex or the other, through the exertion of\r\nchoice, the influence of love and jealousy, and the appreciation of the\r\nbeautiful in sound, colour or form; and these powers of the mind\r\nmanifestly depend on the development of the brain.\r\n\r\nMan scans with scrupulous care the character and pedigree of his\r\nhorses, cattle, and dogs before he matches them; but when he comes to\r\nhis own marriage he rarely, or never, takes any such care. He is\r\nimpelled by nearly the same motives as the lower animals, when they are\r\nleft to their own free choice, though he is in so far superior to them\r\nthat he highly values mental charms and virtues. On the other hand he\r\nis strongly attracted by mere wealth or rank. Yet he might by selection\r\ndo something not only for the bodily constitution and frame of his\r\noffspring, but for their intellectual and moral qualities. Both sexes\r\nought to refrain from marriage if they are in any marked degree\r\ninferior in body or mind; but such hopes are Utopian and will never be\r\neven partially realised until the laws of inheritance are thoroughly\r\nknown. Everyone does good service, who aids towards this end. When the\r\nprinciples of breeding and inheritance are better understood, we shall\r\nnot hear ignorant members of our legislature rejecting with scorn a\r\nplan for ascertaining whether or not consanguineous marriages are\r\ninjurious to man.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the welfare of mankind is a most intricate problem:\r\nall ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid abject poverty for\r\ntheir children; for poverty is not only a great evil, but tends to its\r\nown increase by leading to recklessness in marriage. On the other hand,\r\nas Mr. Galton has remarked, if the prudent avoid marriage, whilst the\r\nreckless marry, the inferior members tend to supplant the better\r\nmembers of society. Man, like every other animal, has no doubt advanced\r\nto his present high condition through a struggle for existence\r\nconsequent on his rapid multiplication; and if he is to advance still\r\nhigher, it is to be feared that he must remain subject to a severe\r\nstruggle. Otherwise he would sink into indolence, and the more gifted\r\nmen would not be more successful in the battle of life than the less\r\ngifted. Hence our natural rate of increase, though leading to many and\r\nobvious evils, must not be greatly diminished by any means. There\r\nshould be open competition for all men; and the most able should not be\r\nprevented by laws or customs from succeeding best and rearing the\r\nlargest number of offspring. Important as the struggle for existence\r\nhas been and even still is, yet as far as the highest part of man’s\r\nnature is concerned there are other agencies more important. For the\r\nmoral qualities are advanced, either directly or indirectly, much more\r\nthrough the effects of habit, the reasoning powers, instruction,\r\nreligion, etc., than through natural selection; though to this latter\r\nagency may be safely attributed the social instincts, which afforded\r\nthe basis for the development of the moral sense.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely, that man is\r\ndescended from some lowly organised form, will, I regret to think, be\r\nhighly distasteful to many. But there can hardly be a doubt that we are\r\ndescended from barbarians. The astonishment which I felt on first\r\nseeing a party of Fuegians on a wild and broken shore will never be\r\nforgotten by me, for the reflection at once rushed into my mind—such\r\nwere our ancestors. These men were absolutely naked and bedaubed with\r\npaint, their long hair was tangled, their mouths frothed with\r\nexcitement, and their expression was wild, startled, and distrustful.\r\nThey possessed hardly any arts, and like wild animals lived on what\r\nthey could catch; they had no government, and were merciless to every\r\none not of their own small tribe. He who has seen a savage in his\r\nnative land will not feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the\r\nblood of some more humble creature flows in his veins. For my own part\r\nI would as soon be descended from that heroic little monkey, who braved\r\nhis dreaded enemy in order to save the life of his keeper, or from that\r\nold baboon, who descending from the mountains, carried away in triumph\r\nhis young comrade from a crowd of astonished dogs—as from a savage who\r\ndelights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices, practices\r\ninfanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no\r\ndecency, and is haunted by the grossest superstitions.\r\n\r\nMan may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen, though not\r\nthrough his own exertions, to the very summit of the organic scale; and\r\nthe fact of his having thus risen, instead of having been aboriginally\r\nplaced there, may give him hope for a still higher destiny in the\r\ndistant future. But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only\r\nwith the truth as far as our reason permits us to discover it; and I\r\nhave given the evidence to the best of my ability. We must, however,\r\nacknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities,\r\nwith sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which\r\nextends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with\r\nhis god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and\r\nconstitution of the solar system—with all these exalted powers—Man\r\nstill bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTAL NOTE.\r\nON SEXUAL SELECTION IN RELATION TO MONKEYS.\r\n\r\nReprinted from NATURE, November 2, 1876, p. 18.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion on Sexual Selection in my ‘Descent of Man,’ no case\r\ninterested and perplexed me so much as the brightly-coloured hinder\r\nends and adjoining parts of certain monkeys. As these parts are more\r\nbrightly coloured in one sex than the other, and as they become more\r\nbrilliant during the season of love, I concluded that the colours had\r\nbeen gained as a sexual attraction. I was well aware that I thus laid\r\nmyself open to ridicule; though in fact it is not more surprising that\r\na monkey should display his bright-red hinder end than that a peacock\r\nshould display his magnificent tail. I had, however, at that time no\r\nevidence of monkeys exhibiting this part of their bodies during their\r\ncourtship; and such display in the case of birds affords the best\r\nevidence that the ornaments of the males are of service to them by\r\nattracting or exciting the females. I have lately read an article by\r\nJoh. von Fischer, of Gotha, published in ‘Der Zoologische Garten,’\r\nApril 1876, on the expression of monkeys under various emotions, which\r\nis well worthy of study by any one interested in the subject, and which\r\nshews that the author is a careful and acute observer. In this article\r\nthere is an account of the behaviour of a young male mandrill when he\r\nfirst beheld himself in a looking-glass, and it is added, that after a\r\ntime he turned round and presented his red hinder end to the glass.\r\nAccordingly I wrote to Herr J. von Fischer to ask what he supposed was\r\nthe meaning of this strange action, and he has sent me two long letters\r\nfull of new and curious details, which will, I hope, be hereafter\r\npublished. He says that he was himself at first perplexed by the above\r\naction, and was thus led carefully to observe several individuals of\r\nvarious other species of monkeys, which he has long kept in his house.\r\nHe finds that not only the mandrill (Cynocephalus mormon) but the drill\r\n(C. leucophaeus) and three other kinds of baboons (C. hamadryas,\r\nsphinx, and babouin), also Cynopithecus niger, and Macacus rhesus and\r\nnemestrinus, turn this part of their bodies, which in all these species\r\nis more or less brightly coloured, to him when they are pleased, and to\r\nother persons as a sort of greeting. He took pains to cure a Macacus\r\nrhesus, which he had kept for five years, of this indecorous habit, and\r\nat last succeeded. These monkeys are particularly apt to act in this\r\nmanner, grinning at the same time, when first introduced to a new\r\nmonkey, but often also to their old monkey friends; and after this\r\nmutual display they begin to play together. The young mandrill ceased\r\nspontaneously after a time to act in this manner towards his master,\r\nvon Fischer, but continued to do so towards persons who were strangers\r\nand to new monkeys. A young Cynopithecus niger never acted, excepting\r\non one occasion, in this way towards his master, but frequently towards\r\nstrangers, and continues to do so up to the present time. From these\r\nfacts Von Fischer concludes that the monkeys which behaved in this\r\nmanner before a looking-glass (viz., the mandrill, drill, Cynopithecus\r\nniger, Macacus rhesus and nemestrinus) acted as if their reflection\r\nwere a new acquaintance. The mandrill and drill, which have their\r\nhinder ends especially ornamented, display it even whilst quite young,\r\nmore frequently and more ostentatiously than do the other kinds. Next\r\nin order comes Cynocephalus hamadryas, whilst the other species act in\r\nthis manner seldomer. The individuals, however, of the same species\r\nvary in this respect, and some which were very shy never displayed\r\ntheir hinder ends. It deserves especial attention that Von Fischer has\r\nnever seen any species purposely exhibit the hinder part of its body,\r\nif not at all coloured. This remark applies to many individuals of\r\nMacacus cynomolgus and Cercocebus radiatus (which is closely allied to\r\nM. rhesus), to three species of Cercopithecus and several American\r\nmonkeys. The habit of turning the hinder ends as a greeting to an old\r\nfriend or new acquaintance, which seems to us so odd, is not really\r\nmore so than the habits of many savages, for instance that of rubbing\r\ntheir bellies with their hands, or rubbing noses together. The habit\r\nwith the mandrill and drill seems to be instinctive or inherited, as it\r\nwas followed by very young animals; but it is modified or guided, like\r\nso many other instincts, by observation, for Von Fischer says that they\r\ntake pains to make their display fully; and if made before two\r\nobservers, they turn to him who seems to pay the most attention.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of the habit, Von Fischer remarks that his\r\nmonkeys like to have their naked hinder ends patted or stroked, and\r\nthat they then grunt with pleasure. They often also turn this part of\r\ntheir bodies to other monkeys to have bits of dirt picked off, and so\r\nno doubt it would be with respect to thorns. But the habit with adult\r\nanimals is connected to a certain extent with sexual feelings, for Von\r\nFischer watched through a glass door a female Cynopithecus niger, and\r\nshe during several days, “umdrehte und dem Männchen mit gurgelnden\r\nTönen die stark geröthete Sitzflache zeigte, was ich früher nie an\r\ndiesem Thier bemerkt hatte. Beim Anblick dieses Gegenstandes erregte\r\nsich das Männchen sichtlich, denn es polterte heftig an den Stäben,\r\nebenfalls gurgelnde Laute ausstossend.” As all the monkeys which have\r\nthe hinder parts of their bodies more or less brightly coloured live,\r\naccording to Von Fischer, in open rocky places, he thinks that these\r\ncolours serve to render one sex conspicuous at a distance to the other;\r\nbut, as monkeys are such gregarious animals, I should have thought that\r\nthere was no need for the sexes to recognise each other at a distance.\r\nIt seems to me more probable that the bright colours, whether on the\r\nface or hinder end, or, as in the mandrill, on both, serve as a sexual\r\nornament and attraction. Anyhow, as we now know that monkeys have the\r\nhabit of turning their hinder ends towards other monkeys, it ceases to\r\nbe at all surprising that it should have been this part of their bodies\r\nwhich has been more or less decorated. The fact that it is only the\r\nmonkeys thus characterised which, as far as at present known, act in\r\nthis manner as a greeting towards other monkeys renders it doubtful\r\nwhether the habit was first acquired from some independent cause, and\r\nthat afterwards the parts in question were coloured as a sexual\r\nornament; or whether the colouring and the habit of turning round were\r\nfirst acquired through variation and sexual selection, and that\r\nafterwards the habit was retained as a sign of pleasure or as a\r\ngreeting, through the principle of inherited association. This\r\nprinciple apparently comes into play on many occasions: thus it is\r\ngenerally admitted that the songs of birds serve mainly as an\r\nattraction during the season of love, and that the leks, or great\r\ncongregations of the black-grouse, are connected with their courtship;\r\nbut the habit of singing has been retained by some birds when they feel\r\nhappy, for instance by the common robin, and the habit of congregating\r\nhas been retained by the black-grouse during other seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to refer to one other point in relation to sexual\r\nselection. It has been objected that this form of selection, as far as\r\nthe ornaments of the males are concerned, implies that all females\r\nwithin the same district must possess and exercise exactly the same\r\ntaste. It should, however, be observed, in the first place, that\r\nalthough the range of variation of a species may be very large, it is\r\nby no means indefinite. I have elsewhere given a good instance of this\r\nfact in the pigeon, of which there are at least a hundred varieties\r\ndiffering widely in their colours, and at least a score of varieties of\r\nthe fowl differing in the same kind of way; but the range of colour in\r\nthese two species is extremely distinct. Therefore the females of\r\nnatural species cannot have an unlimited scope for their taste. In the\r\nsecond place, I presume that no supporter of the principle of sexual\r\nselection believes that the females select particular points of beauty\r\nin the males; they are merely excited or attracted in a greater degree\r\nby one male than by another, and this seems often to depend, especially\r\nwith birds, on brilliant colouring. Even man, excepting perhaps an\r\nartist, does not analyse the slight differences in the features of the\r\nwoman whom he may admire, on which her beauty depends. The male\r\nmandrill has not only the hinder end of his body, but his face\r\ngorgeously coloured and marked with oblique ridges, a yellow beard, and\r\nother ornaments. We may infer from what we see of the variation of\r\nanimals under domestication, that the above several ornaments of the\r\nmandrill were gradually acquired by one individual varying a little in\r\none way, and another individual in another way. The males which were\r\nthe handsomest or the most attractive in any manner to the females\r\nwould pair oftenest, and would leave rather more offspring than other\r\nmales. The offspring of the former, although variously intercrossed,\r\nwould either inherit the peculiarities of their fathers or transmit an\r\nincreased tendency to vary in the same manner. Consequently the whole\r\nbody of males inhabiting the same country would tend from the effects\r\nof constant intercrossing to become modified almost uniformly, but\r\nsometimes a little more in one character and sometimes in another,\r\nthough at an extremely slow rate; all ultimately being thus rendered\r\nmore attractive to the females. The process is like that which I have\r\ncalled unconscious selection by man, and of which I have given several\r\ninstances. In one country the inhabitants value a fleet or light dog or\r\nhorse, and in another country a heavier and more powerful one; in\r\nneither country is there any selection of individual animals with\r\nlighter or stronger bodies and limbs; nevertheless after a considerable\r\nlapse of time the individuals are found to have been modified in the\r\ndesired manner almost uniformly, though differently in each country. In\r\ntwo absolutely distinct countries inhabited by the same species, the\r\nindividuals of which can never during long ages have intermigrated and\r\nintercrossed, and where, moreover, the variations will probably not\r\nhave been identically the same, sexual selection might cause the males\r\nto differ. Nor does the belief appear to me altogether fanciful that\r\ntwo sets of females, surrounded by a very different environment, would\r\nbe apt to acquire somewhat different tastes with respect to form,\r\nsound, or colour. However this may be, I have given in my ‘Descent of\r\nMan’ instances of closely-allied birds inhabiting distinct countries,\r\nof which the young and the females cannot be distinguished, whilst the\r\nadult males differ considerably, and this may be attributed with much\r\nprobability to the action of sexual selection.\r\n\r\nINDEX. — Abbot, C., on the battles of seals.\r\n\r\nAbductor of the fifth metatarsal, presence of, in man.\r\n\r\nAbercrombie, Dr., on disease of the brain affecting speech.\r\n\r\nAbipones, marriage customs of the.\r\n\r\nAbortion, prevalence of the practice of.\r\n\r\nAbou-Simbel, caves of.\r\n\r\nAbramis brama.\r\n\r\nAbstraction, power of, in animals.\r\n\r\nAcalles, stridulation of.\r\n\r\nAcanthodactylus capensis, sexual differences of colour in.\r\n\r\nAccentor Modularis.\r\n\r\nAcclimatisation, difference of, in different races of men.\r\n\r\nAchetidae, stridulation of the;
