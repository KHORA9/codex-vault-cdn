When first\r\nprojected it was the writer's purpose to take up the subject of English\r\nwitchcraft under certain general political and social aspects. It was\r\nnot long, however, before he began to feel that preliminary to such a\r\ntreatment there was necessary a chronological survey of the witch\r\ntrials. Those strange and tragic affairs were so closely involved with\r\nthe politics, literature, and life of the seventeenth century that one\r\nis surprised to find how few of them have received accurate or complete\r\nrecord in history. It may be said, in fact, that few subjects have\r\ngathered about themselves so large concretions of misinformation as\r\nEnglish witchcraft. This is largely, of course, because so little\r\nattention has been given to it by serious students of history. The\r\nmistakes and misunderstandings of contemporary writers and of the local\r\nhistorians have been handed down from county history to county history\r\nuntil many of them have crept into general works. For this reason it was\r\ndetermined to attempt a chronological treatment which would give a\r\nnarrative history of the more significant trials along with some account\r\nof the progress of opinion. This plan has been adhered to somewhat\r\nstrictly, sometimes not without regret upon the part of the writer. It\r\nis his hope later in a series of articles to deal with some of the more\r\ngeneral phases of the subject, with such topics as the use of torture,\r\nthe part of the physicians, the contagious nature of the witch alarms,\r\nthe relation of Puritanism to persecution, the supposed influence of the\r\nRoyal Society, the general causes for the gradual decline of the belief,\r\nand other like questions. It will be seen in the course of the narrative\r\nthat some of these matters have been touched upon.\r\n\r\nThis study of witchcraft has been limited to a period of about one\r\nhundred and sixty years in English history. The year 1558 has been\r\nchosen as the starting point because almost immediately after the\r\naccession of Elizabeth there began the movement for a new law, a\r\nmovement which resulted in the statute of 1563. With that statute the\r\nhistory of the persecution of witches gathers importance. The year 1718\r\nhas been selected as a concluding date because that year was marked by\r\nthe publication of Francis Hutchinson's notable attack upon the belief.\r\nHutchinson levelled a final and deadly blow at the dying superstition.\r\nFew men of intelligence dared after that avow any belief in the reality\r\nof witchcraft; it is probable that very few even secretly cherished such\r\na belief. A complete history would of course include a full account both\r\nof the witch trials from Anglo-Saxon times to Elizabeth's accession and\r\nof the various witch-swimming incidents of the eighteenth century. The\r\nlatter it has not seemed worth while here to consider. The former would\r\ninvolve an examination of all English sources from the earliest times\r\nand would mean a study of isolated and unrelated trials occurring at\r\nlong intervals (at least, we have record only of such) and chiefly in\r\nchurch courts. The writer has not undertaken to treat this earlier\r\nperiod; he must confess to but small knowledge of it. In the few pages\r\nwhich he has given to it he has attempted nothing more than to sketch\r\nfrom the most obvious sources an outline of what is currently known as\r\nto English witches and witchcraft prior to the days of Elizabeth. It is\r\nto be hoped that some student of medieval society will at some time make\r\na thorough investigation of the history of witchcraft in England to the\r\naccession of the great Queen.\r\n\r\nFor the study of the period to be covered in this monograph there exists\r\na wealth of material. It would perhaps not be too much to say that\r\neverything in print and manuscript in England during the last half of\r\nthe sixteenth and the entire seventeenth century should be read or at\r\nleast glanced over. The writer has limited himself to certain kinds of\r\nmaterial from which he could reasonably expect to glean information.\r\nThese sources fall into seven principal categories. Most important of\r\nall are the pamphlets, or chapbooks, dealing with the history of\r\nparticular alarms and trials and usually concluding with the details of\r\nconfession and execution. Second only to them in importance are the\r\nlocal or municipal records, usually court files, but sometimes merely\r\nexpense accounts. In the memoirs and diaries can be found many mentions\r\nof trials witnessed by the diarist or described to him. The newspapers\r\nof the time, in their eagerness to exploit the unusual, seize gloatingly\r\nupon the stories of witchcraft. The works of local historians and\r\nantiquarians record in their lists of striking and extraordinary events\r\nwithin their counties or boroughs the several trials and hangings for\r\nthe crime. The writers, mainly theologians, who discuss the theory and\r\ndoctrine of witchcraft illustrate the principles they lay down by cases\r\nthat have fallen under their observation. Lastly, the state papers\r\ncontain occasional references to the activities of the Devil and of his\r\nagents in the realm.\r\n\r\nBesides these seven types of material there should be named a few others\r\nless important. From the pamphlet accounts of the criminal dockets at\r\nthe Old Bailey and Newgate, leaflets which were published at frequent\r\nintervals after the Restoration, are to be gleaned mentions of perhaps\r\nhalf a dozen trials for witchcraft. The plays of Dekker, Heywood, and\r\nShadwell must be used by the student, not because they add information\r\nomitted elsewhere, but because they offer some clue to the way in which\r\nthe witches at Edmonton and Lancaster were regarded by the public. If\r\nthe pamphlet narrative of the witch of Edmonton had been lost, it might\r\nbe possible to reconstruct from the play of Dekker, Ford, and Rowley\r\nsome of the outlines of the story. It would be at best a hazardous\r\nundertaking. To reconstruct the trials at Lancaster from the plays of\r\nHeywood and Brome or from that of Shadwell would be quite impossible.\r\nThe ballads present a form of evidence much like that of the plays. Like\r\nthe plays, they happen all to deal with cases about which we are already\r\nwell informed. In general, they seem to follow the narratives and\r\ndepositions faithfully.\r\n\r\nNo mention has been made of manuscript sources. Those used by the author\r\nhave all belonged to one or other of the types of material described.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that there is current a large body of\r\nmisinformation about English witchcraft. It would be ungrateful of the\r\nauthor not to acknowledge that some very good work has been done on the\r\ntheme. The Reverend Francis Hutchinson, as already mentioned, wrote in\r\n1718 an epoch-making history of the subject, a book which is still\r\nuseful and can never be wholly displaced. In 1851 Thomas Wright brought\r\nout his _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_, a work at once entertaining\r\nand learned. Wright wrote largely from original sources and wrote with a\r\ngood deal of care. Such blunders as he made were the result of haste and\r\nof the want of those materials which we now possess. Mrs. Lynn Linton's\r\n_Witch Stories_, published first in 1861, is a better book than might be\r\nsupposed from a casual glance at it. It was written with no more serious\r\npurpose than to entertain, but it is by no means to be despised. So far\r\nas it goes, it represents careful work. It would be wrong to pass over\r\nLecky's brilliant essay on witchcraft in his _History of Rationalism_,\r\nvaluable of course rather as an interpretation than as an historical\r\naccount. Lecky said many things about witchcraft that needed to be said,\r\nand said them well. It is my belief that his verdicts as to the\r\nimportance of sundry factors may have to be modified; but, however that\r\nbe, the importance of his essay must always be recognized. One must not\r\nomit in passing James Russell Lowell's charming essay on the subject.\r\nBoth Lecky and Lowell of course touched English witchcraft but lightly.\r\nSince Mrs. Lynn Linton's no careful treatment of English witchcraft\r\nproper has appeared. In 1907, however, Professor Kittredge published his\r\n_Notes on Witchcraft_, the sixty-seven pages of which with their\r\nfootnotes contain a more scrupulous sifting of the evidence as to\r\nwitchcraft in England than is to be found in any other treatment.\r\nProfessor Kittredge is chiefly interested in English witchcraft as it\r\nrelates itself to witchcraft in New England, but his work contains much\r\nthat is fresh about the belief in England. As to the rôle and the\r\nimportance of various actors in the drama and as to sundry minor\r\nmatters, the writer has found himself forced to divergence of view. He\r\nrecognizes nevertheless the importance of Professor Kittredge's\r\ncontribution to the study of the whole subject and acknowledges his own\r\nindebtedness to the essay for suggestion and guidance.\r\n\r\nThe author cannot hope that the work here presented is final.\r\nUnfortunately there is still hidden away in England an unexplored mass\r\nof local records. Some of them no doubt contain accounts of witch\r\ntrials. I have used chiefly such printed and manuscript materials as\r\nwere accessible in London and Oxford. Some day perhaps I may find time\r\nto go the rounds of the English counties and search the masses of gaol\r\ndelivery records and municipal archives. From the really small amount of\r\nnew material on the subject brought to light by the Historical\r\nManuscripts Commission and by the publication of many municipal records,\r\nit seems improbable that such a search would uncover so many unlisted\r\ntrials as seriously to modify the narrative. Nevertheless until such a\r\nsearch is made no history of the subject has the right to be counted\r\nfinal. Mr. Charles W. Wallace, the student of Shakespeare, tells me that\r\nin turning over the multitudinous records of the Star Chamber he found a\r\nfew witch cases. Professor Kittredge believes that there is still a\r\ngreat deal of such material to be turned up in private collections and\r\nlocal archives. Any information on this matter which any student of\r\nEnglish local history can give me will be gratefully received.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my thanks for reading parts of the manuscript to\r\nWilliam Savage Johnson of Kansas University and to Miss Ada Comstock of\r\nthe University of Minnesota. For general assistance and advice on the\r\nsubject I am under obligations to Professor Wilbur C. Abbott and to\r\nProfessor George Burton Adams of Yale University. It is quite impossible\r\nto say how very much I owe to Professor George L. Burr of Cornell. From\r\ncover to cover the book, since the award to it of the Adams Prize, has\r\nprofited from his painstaking criticism and wise suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 W.

There has been, of course, a reason for this neglect--the fact\r\nthat the belief in witchcraft is no longer existent among intelligent\r\npeople and that its history, in consequence, seems to possess rather an\r\nantiquarian than a living interest. No one can tell the story of the\r\nwitch trials of sixteenth and seventeenth century England without\r\ndigging up a buried past, and the process of exhumation is not always\r\npleasant. Yet the study of English witchcraft is more than an unsightly\r\nexposure of a forgotten superstition. There were few aspects of\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth century life that were not affected by the\r\nugly belief. It is quite impossible to grasp the social conditions, it\r\nis impossible to understand the opinions, fears, and hopes of the men\r\nand women who lived in Elizabethan and Stuart England, without some\r\nknowledge of the part played in that age by witchcraft. It was a matter\r\nthat concerned all classes from the royal household to the ignorant\r\ndenizens of country villages. Privy councillors anxious about their\r\nsovereign and thrifty peasants worrying over their crops, clergymen\r\nalert to detect the Devil in their own parishes, medical quacks eager to\r\nprofit by the fear of evil women, justices of the peace zealous to beat\r\ndown the works of Satan--all classes, indeed--believed more or less\r\nsincerely in the dangerous powers of human creatures who had\r\nsurrendered themselves to the Evil One.\r\n\r\nWitchcraft, in a general and vague sense, was something very old in\r\nEnglish history. In a more specific and limited sense it is a\r\ncomparatively modern phenomenon. This leads us to a definition of the\r\nterm. It is a definition that can be given adequately only in an\r\nhistorical way. A group of closely related and somewhat ill defined\r\nconceptions went far back. Some of them, indeed, were to be found in the\r\nOld Testament, many of them in the Latin and Greek writers. The word\r\nwitchcraft itself belonged to Anglo-Saxon days. As early as the seventh\r\ncentury Theodore of Tarsus imposed penances upon magicians and\r\nenchanters, and the laws, from Alfred on, abound with mentions of\r\nwitchcraft.[1] From these passages the meaning of the word witch as used\r\nby the early English may be fairly deduced. The word was the current\r\nEnglish term for one who used spells and charms, who was assisted by\r\nevil spirits to accomplish certain ends. It will be seen that this is by\r\nno means the whole meaning of the term in later times. Nothing is yet\r\nsaid about the transformation of witches into other shapes, and there is\r\nno mention of a compact, implicit or otherwise, with the Devil; there is\r\nno allusion to the nocturnal meetings of the Devil's worshippers and to\r\nthe orgies that took place upon those occasions; there is no elaborate\r\nand systematic theological explanation of human relations with demons.\r\n\r\nBut these notions were to reach England soon enough. Already there were\r\ngerminating in southern Europe ideas out of which the completer notions\r\nwere to spring. As early as the close of the ninth century certain\r\nByzantine traditions were being introduced into the West. There were\r\nlegends of men who had made written compacts with the Devil, men whom he\r\npromised to assist in this world in return for their souls in the\r\nnext.[2] But, while such stories were current throughout the Middle\r\nAges, the notion behind them does not seem to have been connected with\r\nthe other features of what was to make up the idea of witchcraft until\r\nabout the middle of the fourteenth century. It was about that time that\r\nthe belief in the \"Sabbat\" or nocturnal assembly of the witches made its\r\nappearance.[3] The belief grew up that witches rode through the air to\r\nthese meetings, that they renounced Christ and engaged in foul forms of\r\nhomage to Satan. Lea tells us that towards the close of the century the\r\nUniversity of Paris formulated the theory that a pact with Satan was\r\ninherent in all magic, and judges began to connect this pact with the\r\nold belief in night riders through the air. The countless confessions\r\nthat resulted from the carefully framed questions of the judges served\r\nto develop and systematize the theory of the subject. The witch was much\r\nmore than a sorcerer. Sorcerers had been those who, through the aid of\r\nevil spirits, by the use of certain words or of representations of\r\npersons or things produced changes above the ordinary course of nature.\r\n\"The witch,\" says Lea, \"has abandoned Christianity, has renounced her\r\nbaptism, has worshipped Satan as her God, has surrendered herself to\r\nhim, body and soul, and exists only to be his instrument in working the\r\nevil to her fellow creatures which he cannot accomplish without a human\r\nagent.\"[4] This was the final and definite notion of a witch. It was the\r\nconception that controlled European opinion on the subject from the\r\nlatter part of the fourteenth to the close of the seventeenth century.\r\nIt was, as has been seen, an elaborate theological notion that had grown\r\nout of the comparatively simple and vague ideas to be found in the\r\nscriptural and classical writers.\r\n\r\nIt may well be doubted whether this definite and intricate theological\r\nnotion of witchcraft reached England so early as the fourteenth century.\r\nCertainly not until a good deal later--if negative evidence is at all\r\ntrustworthy--was a clear distinction made between sorcery and\r\nwitchcraft. The witches searched for by Henry IV, the professor of\r\ndivinity, the friar, the clerk, and the witch of Eye, who were hurried\r\nbefore the Council of Henry VI, that unfortunate Duchess of Gloucester\r\nwho had to walk the streets of London, the Duchess of Bedford, the\r\nconspirators against Edward IV who were supposed to use magic, the\r\nunlucky mistress of Edward IV--none of these who through the course of\r\ntwo centuries were charged with magical misdeeds were, so far as we\r\nknow, accused of those dreadful relations with the Devil, the nauseating\r\ndetails of which fill out the later narratives of witch history.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that the idea of witchcraft was not very clearly\r\ndefined and differentiated in the minds of ordinary Englishmen until\r\nafter the beginning of legislation upon the subject. It is not\r\nimpossible that there were English theologians who could have set forth\r\nthe complete philosophy of the belief, but to the average mind sorcery,\r\nconjuration, enchantment, and witchcraft were but evil ways of mastering\r\nnature. All that was changed when laws were passed. With legislation\r\ncame greatly increased numbers of accusations; with accusations and\r\nexecutions came treatises and theory. Continental writers were\r\nconsulted, and the whole system and science of the subject were soon\r\nelaborated for all who read.\r\n\r\nWith the earlier period, which has been sketched merely by way of\r\ndefinition, this monograph cannot attempt to deal. It limits itself to a\r\nnarrative of the witch trials, and incidentally of opinion as to\r\nwitchcraft, after there was definite legislation by Parliament. The\r\nstatute of the fifth year of Elizabeth's reign marks a point in the\r\nhistory of the judicial persecution at which an account may very\r\nnaturally begin. The year 1558 has been selected as the date because\r\nfrom the very opening of the reign which was to be signalized by the\r\npassing of that statute and was to be characterized by a serious effort\r\nto enforce it, the persecution was preparing.\r\n\r\nUp to that time the crime of sorcery had been dealt with in a few early\r\ninstances by the common-law courts, occasionally (where politics were\r\ninvolved) by the privy council, but more usually, it is probable, by the\r\nchurch. This, indeed, may easily be illustrated from the works of law.\r\nBritton and Fleta include an inquiry about sorcerers as one of the\r\narticles of the sheriff's tourn. A note upon Britton, however, declares\r\nthat it is for the ecclesiastical court to try such offenders and to\r\ndeliver them to be put to death in the king's court, but that the king\r\nhimself may proceed against them if he pleases.[5] While there is some\r\noverlapping of procedure implied by this, the confusion seems to have\r\nbeen yet greater in actual practice. A brief narrative of some cases\r\nprior to 1558 will illustrate the strangely unsettled state of\r\nprocedure. Pollock and Maitland relate several trials to be found in the\r\nearly pleas. In 1209 one woman accused another of sorcery in the king's\r\ncourt and the defendant cleared herself by the ordeal. In 1279 a man\r\naccused of killing a witch who assaulted him in his house was fined, but\r\nonly because he had fled away. Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and\r\ntreasurer of Edward I, was accused of sorcery and homage to Satan and\r\ncleared himself with the compurgators. In 1325 more than twenty men were\r\nindicted and tried by the king's bench for murder by tormenting a waxen\r\nimage. All of them were acquitted. In 1371 there was brought before the\r\nking's bench an inhabitant of Southwark who was charged with sorcery,\r\nbut he was finally discharged on swearing that he would never be a\r\nsorcerer.[6]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that these early cases were all of them tried in the\r\nsecular courts; but there is no reason to doubt that the ecclesiastical\r\ncourts were quite as active, and their zeal must have been quickened by\r\nthe statute of 1401, which in cases of heresy made the lay power their\r\nexecutioner. It was at nearly the same time, however, that the charge of\r\nsorcery began to be frequently used as a political weapon. In such\r\ncases, of course, the accused was usually a person of influence and the\r\nmatter was tried in the council. It will be seen, then, that the crime\r\nwas one that might fall either under ecclesiastical or conciliar\r\njurisdiction and the particular circumstances usually determined finally\r\nthe jurisdiction. When Henry IV was informed that the diocese of Lincoln\r\nwas full of sorcerers, magicians, enchanters, necromancers, diviners,\r\nand soothsayers, he sent a letter to the bishop requiring him to search\r\nfor sorcerers and to commit them to prison after conviction, or even\r\nbefore, if it should seem expedient.[7] This was entrusting the matter\r\nto the church, but the order was given by authority of the king, not\r\nimprobably after the matter had been discussed in the council. In the\r\nreign of Henry VI conciliar and ecclesiastical authorities both took\r\npart at different times and in different ways. Thomas Northfield, a\r\nmember of the Order of Preachers in Worcester and a professor of\r\ndivinity, was brought before the council, together with all suspected\r\nmatter belonging to him, and especially his books treating of sorcery.\r\nPike does not tell us the outcome.[8] In the same year there were\r\nsummoned before the council three humbler sorcerers, Margery Jourdemain,\r\nJohn Virley, a cleric, and John Ashwell, a friar of the Order of the\r\nHoly Cross. It would be hard to say whether the three were in any way\r\nconnected with political intrigue. It is possible that they were\r\nsuspected of sorcery against the sovereign. They were all, however,\r\ndismissed on giving security.[9] It was only a few years after this\r\ninstance of conciliar jurisdiction that a much more important case was\r\nturned over to the clergy. The story of Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of\r\nGloucester, is a familiar one. It was determined by the enemies of Duke\r\nHumphrey of Gloucester to attack him through his wife, who was believed\r\nto be influential with the young king. The first move was made by\r\narresting a Roger Bolingbroke who had been connected with the duke and\r\nthe duchess, and who was said to be an astronomer or necromancer. It was\r\ndeclared that he had cast the duchess's horoscope with a view to\r\nascertaining her chances to the throne. Bolingbroke made confession, and\r\nEleanor was then brought before \"certayne bisshoppis of the kyngis.\" In\r\nthe mean time several lords, members of the privy council, were\r\nauthorized to \"enquire of al maner tresons, sorcery, and alle othir\r\nthyngis that myghte in eny wise ... concerne harmfulli the kyngis\r\npersone.\"[10] Bolingbroke and a clergyman, Thomas Southwell, were\r\nindicted of treason with the duchess as accessory. With them was accused\r\nthat Margery Jourdemain who had been released ten years before. Eleanor\r\nwas then reexamined before the Bishops of London, Lincoln, and Norwich,\r\nshe was condemned as guilty, and required to walk barefoot through the\r\nstreets of London, which she \"dede righte mekely.\" The rest of her life\r\nshe spent in a northern prison. Bolingbroke was executed as a traitor,\r\nand Margery Jourdemain was burnt at Smithfield.[11]\r\n\r\nThe case of the Duchess of Bedford--another instance of the connection\r\nbetween sorcery and political intrigue--fell naturally into the hands of\r\nthe council. It was believed by those who could understand in no other\r\nway the king's infatuation that he had been bewitched by the mother of\r\nthe queen. The story was whispered from ear to ear until the duchess got\r\nwind of it and complained to the council against her maligners. The\r\ncouncil declared her cleared of suspicion and ordered that the decision\r\nshould be \"enacted of record.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe charge of sorcery brought by the protector Richard of Gloucester\r\nagainst Jane Shore, who had been the mistress of Edward IV, never came\r\nto trial and in consequence illustrates neither ecclesiastical nor\r\nconciliar jurisdiction. It is worthy of note however that the accusation\r\nwas preferred by the protector--who was soon to be Richard III--in the\r\ncouncil chamber.[13]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these cases prove very little as to procedure in\r\nthe matter of sorcery and witchcraft. They are cases that arose in a\r\ndisturbed period and that concerned chiefly people of note. That they\r\nwere tried before the bishops or before the privy council does not mean\r\nthat all such charges were brought into those courts. There must have\r\nbeen less important cases that were never brought before the council or\r\nthe great ecclesiastical courts. It seems probable--to reason backward\r\nfrom later practice--that less important trials were conducted almost\r\nexclusively by the minor church courts.[14]\r\n\r\nThis would at first lead us to suspect that, when the state finally\r\nbegan to legislate against witchcraft by statute, it was endeavoring to\r\nwrest jurisdiction of the crime out of the hands of the church and to\r\nput it into secular hands. Such a supposition, however, there is nothing\r\nto justify. It seems probable, on the contrary, that the statute enacted\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII was passed rather to support the church in\r\nits struggle against sorcery and witchcraft than to limit its\r\njurisdiction in the matter. It was to assist in checking these\r\npractitioners that the state stepped in. At another point in this\r\nchapter we shall have occasion to note the great interest in sorcery and\r\nall kindred subjects that was springing up over England, and we shall at\r\ntimes observe some of the manifestations of this interest as well as\r\nsome of the causes for it. Here it is necessary only to urge the\r\nimportance of this interest as accounting for the passage of a\r\nstatute.[15]\r\n\r\nChapter VIII of 33 Henry VIII states its purpose clearly: \"Where,\"\r\nreads the preamble, \"dyvers and sundrie persones unlawfully have devised\r\nand practised Invocacions and conjuracions of Sprites, pretendyng by\r\nsuche meanes to understande and get Knowlege for their owne lucre in\r\nwhat place treasure of golde and Silver shulde or mought be founde or\r\nhad ... and also have used and occupied wichecraftes, inchauntmentes and\r\nsorceries to the distruccion of their neighbours persones and goodes.\" A\r\ndescription was given of the methods practised, and it was enacted that\r\nthe use of any invocation or conjuration of spirits, witchcrafts,\r\nenchantments, or sorceries should be considered felony.[16] It will be\r\nobserved that the law made no graduation of offences. Everything was\r\nlisted as felony. No later piece of legislation on the subject was so\r\nsweeping in its severity.\r\n\r\nThe law remained on the statute-book only six years. In the early part\r\nof the reign of Edward VI, when the protector Somerset was in power, a\r\npolicy of great leniency in respect to felonies was proposed. In\r\nDecember of 1547 a bill was introduced into Parliament to repeal certain\r\nstatutes for treason and felony. \"This bill being a matter of great\r\nconcern to every subject, a committee was appointed, consisting of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, the lord chamberlain, the\r\nMarquis of Dorset, the Earls of Shrewsbury and Southampton, the Bishops\r\nof Ely, Lincoln, and Worcester, the Lords Cobham, Clinton, and\r\nWentworth, with certain of the king's learned council; all which\r\nnoblemen were appointed to meet a committee of the Commons ... in order\r\nto treat and commune on the purport of the said bill.\"[17] The Commons,\r\nit seems, had already prepared a bill of their own, but this they were\r\nwilling to drop and the Lords' measure with some amendments was finally\r\npassed. It was under this wide repeal of felonies that chapter VIII of\r\n33 Henry VIII was finally annulled. Whether the question of witchcraft\r\ncame up for special consideration or not, we are not informed. We do\r\nknow that the Bishops of London, Durham, Ely, Hereford, and Chichester,\r\ntook exception to some amendments that were inserted in the act of\r\nrepeal,[18] and it is not impossible that they were opposed to repealing\r\nthe act against witchcraft. Certainly there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthe church was resisting the encroachment of the state in the subject.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact it is probable that, in the general question of\r\nrepeal of felonies, the question of witchcraft received scant\r\nattention. There is indeed an interesting story that seems to point in\r\nthat direction and that deserves repeating also as an illustration of\r\nthe protector's attitude towards the question. Edward Underhill gives\r\nthe narrative in his autobiography: \"When we hade dyned, the maior sentt\r\nto [two] off his offycers with me to seke Alene; whome we mett withalle\r\nin Poles, and toke hym with us unto his chamber, wheare we founde\r\nfygures sett to calke the nativetie off the kynge, and a jugementt\r\ngevyne off his deathe, wheroff this folyshe wreche thoughte hymselfe so\r\nsure thatt he and his conselars the papistes bruted it all over. The\r\nkynge laye att Hamtone courte the same tyme, and me lord protector at\r\nthe Syone; unto whome I caryed this Alen, with his bokes off\r\nconejuracyons, cearkles, and many thynges beloungynge to thatt dyvlyshe\r\nart, wiche he affyrmed before me lorde was a lawfulle cyens [science],\r\nfor the statute agaynst souche was repealed. 'Thow folyshe knave! (sayde\r\nme lorde) yff thou and all thatt be off thy cyens telle me what I shalle\r\ndo to-morow, I wylle geve the alle thatt I have'; commaundynge me to\r\ncary hym unto the Tower.\" Alen was examined about his science and it was\r\ndiscovered that he was \"a very unlearned asse, and a sorcerer, for the\r\nwiche he was worthye hangynge, sayde Mr. Recorde.\" He was however kept\r\nin the Tower \"about the space off a yere, and then by frendshipe\r\ndelyvered. So scapithe alwayes the weked.\"[19]\r\n\r\nBut the wicked were not long to escape. The beginning of Elizabeth's\r\nreign saw a serious and successful effort to put on the statute-book\r\ndefinite and severe penalties for conjuration, sorcery, witchcraft, and\r\nrelated crimes. The question was taken up in the very first year of the\r\nnew reign and a bill was draughted.[20] It was not, however, until 1563\r\nthat the statute was finally passed. It was then enacted that those who\r\n\"shall use, practise, or exercise any Witchecrafte, Enchantment, Charme\r\nor Sorcerie, whereby any person shall happen to bee killed or destroyed,\r\n... their Concellors and Aidours, ... shall suffer paynes of Deathe as a\r\nFelon or Felons.\" It was further declared that those by whose practices\r\nany person was wasted, consumed, or lamed, should suffer for the first\r\noffence one year's imprisonment and should be put in the pillory four\r\ntimes. For the second offence death was the penalty. It was further\r\nprovided that those who by witchcraft presumed to discover treasure or\r\nto find stolen property or to \"provoke any person to unlawfull love\"\r\nshould suffer a year's imprisonment and four appearances in the pillory.\r\n\r\nWith this law the history of the prosecution of witchcraft in England as\r\na secular crime may well begin. The question naturally arises, What was\r\nthe occasion of this law? How did it happen that just at this particular\r\ntime so drastic a measure was passed and put into operation? Fortunately\r\npart of the evidence exists upon which to frame an answer. The English\r\nchurchmen who had been driven out of England during the Marian\r\npersecution had many of them sojourned in Zurich and Geneva, where the\r\nextirpation of witches was in full progress, and had talked over the\r\nmatter with eminent Continental theologians. With the accession of\r\nElizabeth these men returned to England in force and became prominent in\r\nchurch and state, many of them receiving bishoprics. It is not possible\r\nto show that they all were influential in putting through the statute of\r\nthe fifth year of Elizabeth. It is clear that one of them spoke out\r\nplainly on the subject. It can hardly be doubted that he represented the\r\nopinions of many other ecclesiastics who had come under the same\r\ninfluences during their exile.[21] John Jewel was an Anglican of\r\nCalvinistic sympathies who on his return to England at Elizabeth's\r\naccession had been appointed Bishop of Salisbury. Within a short time he\r\ncame to occupy a prominent position in the court. He preached before the\r\nQueen and accompanied her on a visit to Oxford. It was in the course of\r\none of his first sermons--somewhere between November of 1559 and March\r\nof 1560[22]--that he laid before her his convictions on witchcraft. It\r\nis, he tells her, \"the horrible using of your poor subjects,\" that\r\nforces him to speak. \"This kind of people (I mean witches and sorcerers)\r\nwithin these few last years are marvellously increased within this your\r\ngrace's realm. These eyes have seen most evident and manifest marks of\r\ntheir wickedness. Your grace's subjects pine away even unto death, their\r\ncolour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed, their\r\nsenses are bereft. Wherefore, your poor subjects' most humble petition\r\nunto your highness is, that the laws touching such malefactors may be\r\nput in due execution.\"\r\n\r\nThe church historian, Strype, conjectures that this sermon was the cause\r\nof the law passed in the fifth year of Elizabeth's reign, by which\r\nwitchcraft was again made a felony, as it had been in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII.[23] Whatever weight we may attach to Strype's suggestion, we have\r\nevery right to believe that Jewel introduced foreign opinion on\r\nwitchcraft. Very probably there were many returned exiles as well as\r\nothers who brought back word of the crusade on the Continent; but\r\nJewel's words put the matter formally before the queen and her\r\ngovernment.[24]\r\n\r\nWe can trace the effect of the ecclesiastic's appeal still further. The\r\nimpression produced by it was responsible probably not only for the\r\npassage of the law but also for the issue of commissions to the justices\r\nof the peace to apprehend all the witches they were able to find in\r\ntheir jurisdictions.[25]\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that the impression produced by the bishop's\r\nsermon serves in part to explain the beginning of the state's attack\r\nupon witches. Yet one naturally inquires after some other factor in the\r\nproblem. Is it not likely that there were in England itself certain\r\npeculiar conditions, certain special circumstances, that served to\r\nforward the attack? To answer that query, we must recall the situation\r\nin England when Elizabeth took the throne. Elizabeth was a Protestant,\r\nand her accession meant the relinquishment of the Catholic hold upon\r\nEngland. But it was not long before the claims of Mary, Queen of Scots,\r\nbegan to give the English ministers bad dreams. Catholic and Spanish\r\nplots against the life of Elizabeth kept the government detectives on\r\nthe lookout. Perhaps because it was deemed the hardest to circumvent,\r\nthe use of conjuration against the life of the queen was most feared.\r\nIt was a method too that appealed to conspirators, who never questioned\r\nits efficacy, and who anticipated little risk of discovery.\r\n\r\nTo understand why the English government should have been so alarmed at\r\nthe efforts of the conjurers, we shall have to go back to the\r\nhalf-century that preceded the reign of the great queen and review\r\nbriefly the rise of those curious traders in mystery. The earlier half\r\nof the fifteenth century, when the witch fires were already lighted in\r\nSouth Germany, saw the coming of conjurers in England. Their numbers\r\nsoon evidenced a growing interest in the supernatural upon the part of\r\nthe English and foreshadowed the growing faith in witchcraft. From the\r\nscattered local records the facts have been pieced together to show that\r\nhere and there professors of magic powers were beginning to get a\r\nhearing. As they first appear upon the scene, the conjurers may be\r\ngrouped in two classes, the position seekers and the treasure seekers.\r\nTo the first belong those who used incantations and charms to win the\r\nfavor of the powerful, and so to gain advancement for themselves or for\r\ntheir clients.[26] It was a time when there was every encouragement to\r\ntry these means. Men like Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell had risen from\r\nhumble rank to the highest places in the state. Their careers seemed\r\ninexplicable, if not uncanny. It was easy to believe that unfair and\r\nunlawful practices had been used. What had been done before could be\r\ndone again. So the dealers in magic may have reasoned. At all events,\r\nwhatever their mental operations, they experimented with charms which\r\nwere to gain the favor of the great, and some of their operations came\r\nto the ears of the court.\r\n\r\nThe treasure seekers[27] were more numerous. Every now and then in the\r\ncourse of English history treasures have been unearthed, many of them\r\nburied in Roman times. Stories of lucky finds had of course gained wide\r\ncirculation. Here was the opportunity of the bankrupt adventurer and the\r\nstranded promoter. The treasures could be found by the science of magic.\r\nThe notion was closely akin to the still current idea that wells can be\r\nlocated by the use of hazel wands. But none of the conjurers--and this\r\nseems a curious fact to one familiar with the English stories of the\r\nsupernatural--ever lit upon the desired treasure. Their efforts hardly\r\naroused public interest, least of all alarm. Experimenters, who fifty\r\nyears later would have been hurried before the privy council, were\r\nallowed to conjure and dig as they pleased. Henry VIII even sold the\r\nright in one locality, and sold it at a price which showed how lightly\r\nhe regarded it.[28]\r\n\r\nOther forms of magic were of course practiced. By the time that\r\nElizabeth succeeded to the throne, it is safe to say that the practice\r\nof forbidden arts had become wide-spread in England. Reginald Scot a\r\nlittle later declared that every parish was full of men and women who\r\nclaimed to work miracles.[29] Most of them were women, and their\r\nperformances read like those of the gipsy fortune-tellers today.\r\n\"Cunning women\" they called themselves. They were many of them\r\nsemi-medical or pseudo-medical practitioners[30] who used herbs and\r\nextracts, and, when those failed, charms and enchantments, to heal the\r\nsick. If they were fairly fortunate, they became known as \"good\r\nwitches.\" Particularly in connection with midwifery were their\r\nincantations deemed effective.[31] From such functions it was no far\r\ncall to forecast the outcome of love affairs, or to prepare potions\r\nwhich would ensure love.[32] They became general helpers to the\r\ndistressed. They could tell where lost property was to be found, an\r\nundertaking closely related to that of the treasure seekers.[33]\r\n\r\nIt was usually in the less serious diseases[34] that these cunning folk\r\nwere consulted. They were called upon often indeed--if one fragmentary\r\nevidence may be trusted--to diagnose the diseases and to account for the\r\ndeaths of domestic animals.[35] It may very easily be that it was from\r\nthe necessity of explaining the deaths of animals that the practitioners\r\nof magic began to talk about witchcraft and to throw out a hint that\r\nsome witch was at the back of the matter. It would be in line with\r\ntheir own pretensions. Were they not good witches? Was it not their\r\nprovince to overcome the machinations of the black witches, that is,\r\nwitches who wrought evil rather than good? The disease of an animal was\r\nhard to prescribe for. A sick horse would hardly respond to the waving\r\nof hands and a jumble of strange words. The animal was, in all\r\nprobability, bewitched.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, whether in this particular manner or not, it became shortly\r\nthe duty of the cunning women to recognize the signs of witchcraft, to\r\nprescribe for it, and if possible to detect the witch. In many cases the\r\npractitioner wisely enough refused to name any one, but described the\r\nappearance of the guilty party and set forth a series of operations by\r\nwhich to expose her machinations. If certain herbs were plucked and\r\ntreated in certain ways, if such and such words were said, the guilty\r\nparty would appear at the door. At other times the wise woman gave a\r\nperfectly recognizable description of the guilty one and offered\r\nremedies that would nullify her maleficent influences. No doubt the\r\nparty indicated as the witch was very often another of the \"good\r\nwitches,\" perhaps a rival. Throughout the records of the superstition\r\nare scattered examples of wise women upon whom suspicion suddenly\r\nlighted, and who were arraigned and sent to the gallows. Beyond question\r\nthe suspicion began often with the ill words of a neighbor,[36] perhaps\r\nof a competitor, words that started an attack upon the woman's\r\nreputation that she was unable to repel.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the art of cunning was confined to the\r\nfemale sex. Throughout the reign of Elizabeth, the realm was alive with\r\nmen who were pretenders to knowledge of mysteries. So closely was the\r\noccupation allied to that of the physician that no such strict line as\r\nnow exists between reputable physicians and quack doctors separated the\r\n\"good witches\" from the regular practicers of medicine. It was so\r\ncustomary in Elizabethan times for thoroughly reputable and even eminent\r\nmedical men to explain baffling cases as the results of witchcraft[37]\r\nthat to draw the line of demarcation between them and the pretenders who\r\nsuggested by means of a charm or a glass a maleficent agent would be\r\nimpossible. Granted the phenomena of conjuration and witchcraft as\r\nfacts--and no one had yet disputed them--it was altogether easy to\r\nbelieve that good witches who antagonized the works of black witches\r\nwere more dependable than the family physician, who could but suggest\r\nthe cause of sickness. The regular practitioner must often have created\r\nbusiness for his brother of the cunning arts.\r\n\r\nOne would like to know what these practicers thought of their own arts.\r\nCertainly some of them accomplished cures. Mental troubles that baffled\r\nthe ordinary physician would offer the \"good witch\" a rare field for\r\nsuccessful endeavor. Such would be able not only to persuade a community\r\nof their good offices, but to deceive themselves. Not all of them,\r\nhowever, by any means, were self-deceived. Conscious fraud played a part\r\nin a large percentage of cases. One witch was very naive in her\r\nconfession of fraud. When suspected of sorcery and cited to court, she\r\nwas said to have frankly recited her charm:\r\n\r\n    \"My lofe in my lappe,\r\n      My penny in my purse,\r\n    You are never the better,\r\n      I am never the worse.\"\r\n\r\nShe was acquitted and doubtless continued to add penny to penny.[38]\r\n\r\nWe need not, indeed, be surprised that the state should have been remiss\r\nin punishing a crime so vague in character and so closely related to an\r\nhonorable profession. Except where conjuration had affected high\r\ninterests of state, it had been practically overlooked by the\r\ngovernment. Now and then throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies there had been isolated plots against the sovereign, in which\r\nconjury had played a conspicuous part. With these few exceptions the\r\ncrime had been one left to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. But now the\r\nstate was ready to reclaim its jurisdiction over these crimes and to\r\nassume a very positive attitude of hostility towards them. This came\r\nabout in a way that has already been briefly indicated. The government\r\nof the queen found itself threatened constantly by plots for making away\r\nwith the queen, plots which their instigators hoped would overturn the\r\nProtestant regime and bring England back into the fold. Elizabeth had\r\nhardly mounted her throne when her councillors began to suspect the use\r\nof sorcery and conjuration against her life. As a result they\r\ninstituted the most painstaking inquiries into all reported cases of the\r\nsort, especially in and about London and the neighboring counties. Every\r\nCatholic was suspected. Two cases that were taken up within the first\r\nyear came to nothing, but a third trial proved more serious. In November\r\nof 1558 Sir Anthony Fortescue,[39] member of a well known Catholic\r\nfamily, was arrested, together with several accomplices, upon the charge\r\nof casting the horoscope of the queen's life. Fortescue was soon\r\nreleased, but in 1561 he was again put in custody, this time with two\r\nbrothers-in-law, Edmund and Arthur Pole, nephews of the famous cardinal\r\nof that name. The plot that came to light had many ramifications. It was\r\nproposed to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, to Edmund Pole, and from\r\nFlanders to proclaim her Queen of England. In the meantime Elizabeth was\r\nto die a natural death--at least so the conspirators claimed--prophesied\r\nfor her by two conjurers, John Prestall and Edmund Cosyn, with the\r\nassistance of a \"wicked spryte.\" It was discovered that the plot\r\ninvolved the French and Spanish ambassadors. Relations between Paris and\r\nLondon became strained. The conspirators were tried and sentenced to\r\ndeath. Fortescue himself, perhaps because he was a second cousin of the\r\nqueen and brother of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, seems to have\r\nescaped the gallows.[40]\r\n\r\nThe Fortescue affair was, however, but one of many conspiracies on foot\r\nduring the time. Throughout the sixties and the seventies the queen's\r\ncouncillors were on the lookout. Justices of the peace and other\r\nprominent men in the counties were kept informed by the privy council of\r\nreported conjurers, and they were instructed to send in what evidence\r\nthey could gather against them. It is remarkable that three-fourths of\r\nthe cases that came under investigation were from a territory within\r\nthirty miles of London. Two-thirds of them were from Essex. Not all the\r\nconjurers were charged with plotting against the queen, but that charge\r\nwas most common. It is safe to suppose that, in the cases where that\r\naccusation was not preferred, it was nevertheless the alarm of the privy\r\ncouncil for the life of the queen that had prompted the investigation\r\nand arrest.\r\n\r\nBetween 1578 and 1582, critical years in the affairs of the Scottish\r\nqueen, the anxiety of the London authorities was intense[41]--their\r\nprecautions were redoubled. Representatives of the government were sent\r\nout to search for conjurers and were paid well for their services.[42]\r\nThe Earl of Shrewsbury, a member of the council who had charge of the\r\nnow captive Queen Mary, kept in his employ special detectors of\r\nconjuring.[43] Nothing about Elizabeth's government was better\r\norganized than Cecil's detective service, and the state papers show that\r\nthe ferreting out of the conjurers was by no means the least of its\r\nwork. It was a service carried on, of course, as quietly as could be,\r\nand yet the cases now and again came to light and made clear to the\r\npublic that the government was very fearful of conjurers' attacks upon\r\nthe queen. No doubt the activity of the council put all conjurers under\r\npublic suspicion and in some degree roused public resentment against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis brings us back to the point: What had the conjurers to do with\r\nwitchcraft? By this time the answer is fairly obvious. The practisers of\r\nthe magic arts, the charmers and enchanters, were responsible for\r\ndeveloping the notions of witchcraft. The good witch brought in her\r\ncompany the black witch. This in itself might never have meant more than\r\nan increased activity in the church courts. But when Protestant England\r\ngrew suddenly nervous for the life of the queen, when the conjurers\r\nbecame a source of danger to the sovereign, and the council commenced\r\nits campaign against them, the conditions had been created in which\r\nwitchcraft became at once the most dangerous and detested of crimes.\r\nWhile the government was busy putting down the conjurers, the aroused\r\npopular sentiment was compelling the justices of the peace and then the\r\nassize judges to hang the witches.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be better illustrated than by the Abingdon affair of\r\n1578-1579. Word had been carried to the privy council that Sir Henry\r\nNewell, justice of the peace, had committed some women near Abingdon on\r\nthe charge of making waxen images.[44] The government was at once\r\nalarmed and sent a message to Sir Henry and to the Dean of Windsor\r\ninstructing them to find out the facts and to discover if the plots were\r\ndirected against the queen. The precaution was unnecessary. There was no\r\nground for believing that the designs of the women accused had included\r\nthe queen. Indeed the evidence of guilt of any kind was very flimsy. But\r\nthe excitement of the public had been stirred to the highest pitch. The\r\nprivy council had shown its fear of the women and all four of them went\r\nto the gallows.[45]\r\n\r\nThe same situation that brought about the attack upon witchcraft and\r\nconjuration was no doubt responsible for the transfer of jurisdiction\r\nover the crime. We have already seen that the practice of conjuration\r\nhad probably been left largely to the episcopal hierarchy for\r\npunishment.[46] The archdeacons were expected in their visitations to\r\ninquire into the practice of enchantment and magic within the parishes\r\nand to make report.[47] In the reign of Elizabeth it became no light\r\nduty. The church set itself to suppress both the consulter and the\r\nconsulted.[48] By the largest number of recorded cases deal of course\r\nwith the first class. It was very easy when sick or in trouble to go to\r\na professed conjurer for help.[49] It was like seeking a physician's\r\nservice, as we have seen. The church frowned upon it, but the danger\r\ninvolved in disobeying the church was not deemed great. The cunning man\r\nor woman was of course the one who ran the great risk. When worst came\r\nto worst and the ecclesiastical power took cognizance of his profession,\r\nthe best he could do was to plead that he was a \"good witch\" and\r\nrendered valuable services to the community.[50] But a good end was in\r\nthe eyes of the church no excuse for an evil means. The good witches\r\nwere dealers with evil spirits and hence to be repressed.\r\n\r\nYet the church was very light in its punishments. In the matter of\r\npenalties, indeed, consulter and consulted fared nearly alike, and both\r\ngot off easily. Public confession and penance in one or more\r\nspecifically designated churches, usually in the nearest parish church,\r\nconstituted the customary penalty.[51] In a few instances it was\r\ncoupled with the requirement that the criminal should stand in the\r\npillory, taper in hand, at several places at stated times.[52] The\r\necclesiastical records are so full of church penances that a student is\r\nled to wonder how effectual they were in shaming the penitent into\r\nbetter conduct. It may well be guessed that most of the criminals were\r\nnot sensitive souls that would suffer profoundly from the disgrace\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\nThe control of matters of this kind was in the hands of the church by\r\nsufferance only. So long as the state was not greatly interested, the\r\nchurch was permitted to retain its jurisdiction.[53] Doubtless the kings\r\nof England would have claimed the state's right of jurisdiction if it\r\nhad become a matter of dispute. The church itself recognized the secular\r\npower in more important cases.[54] In such cases the archdeacon usually\r\nacted with the justice of peace in conducting the examination,[55] as in\r\nrendering sentence. Even then, however, the penalty was as a rule\r\necclesiastical. But, with the second half of the sixteenth century,\r\nthere arose new conditions which resulted in the transfer of this\r\ncontrol to the state. Henry VIII had broken with Rome and established a\r\nChurch of England around the king as a centre. The power of the church\r\nbelonged to the king, and, if to the king, to his ministers and his\r\njudges. Hence certain crimes that had been under the control of the\r\nchurch fell under the jurisdiction of the king's courts.[56] In a more\r\nspecial way the same change came about through the attack of the privy\r\ncouncil upon the conjurers. What had hitherto been a comparatively\r\ninsignificant offence now became a crime against the state and was so\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\nThe change, of course, was not sudden. It was not accomplished in a\r\nyear, nor in a decade. It was going on throughout the first half of\r\nElizabeth's reign. By the beginning of the eighties the church control\r\nwas disappearing. After 1585 the state had practically exclusive\r\njurisdiction.[57]\r\n\r\nWe have now finished the attempt to trace the beginning of the definite\r\nmovement against witchcraft in England. What witchcraft was, what it\r\nbecame, how it was to be distinguished from sorcery--these are questions\r\nthat we have tried to answer very briefly. We have dealt in a cursory\r\nway with a series of cases extending from Anglo-Saxon days down to the\r\nfifteenth century in order to show how unfixed was the matter of\r\njurisdiction. We have sought also to explain how Continental opinion was\r\nintroduced into England through Jewel and other Marian exiles, to show\r\nwhat independent forces were operating in England, and to exhibit the\r\ngrowing influence of the charmers and their relation to the development\r\nof witchcraft; and lastly we have aimed to prove that the special danger\r\nto the queen had no little part in creating the crusade against witches.\r\nThese are conclusions of some moment and a caution must be inserted. We\r\nhave been treating of a period where facts are few and information\r\nfragmentary. Under such circumstances conclusions can only be tentative.\r\nPerhaps the most that can be said of them is that they are suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Benjamin Thorpe, _Ancient Laws and Institutes of England_ (London,\r\n1840), I, 41; Liebermann, _Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen_ (Halle, 1906),\r\nand passages cited in his _Wörterbuch_ under _wiccan_, _wiccacræft_;\r\nThomas Wright, ed., _A Contemporary Narrative of the Proceedings against\r\nDame Alice Kyteler_ (Camden Soc., London, 1843), introd., i-iii.\r\n\r\n[2] George L.

The \"Act concerning Phesicions\r\nand Surgeons\" of 3 Henry VIII, ch. XI, was aimed against quacks.\r\n\"Forasmoche as the science and connyng of Physyke and Surgerie to the\r\nperfecte knowlege wherof bee requisite bothe grete lernyng and ripe\r\nexperience ys daily ... exercised by a grete multitude of ignoraunt\r\npersones ... soofarfurth that common Artificers as Smythes Wevers and\r\nWomen boldely and custumably take upon theim grete curis and thyngys of\r\ngreat difficultie In the which they partely use socery and which crafte\r\n[_sic_] partely applie such medicyne unto the disease as be verey\r\nnoyous,\" it was required that every candidate to practice medicine\r\nshould be examined by the bishop of the diocese (in London by either the\r\nbishop or the Dean of St. Paul's).\r\n\r\n[16] Stephen, _History of Criminal Law_, II, 431, says of this act:\r\n\"Hutchinson suggests that this act, which was passed two years after the\r\nact of the Six Articles, was intended as a 'hank upon the reformers,'\r\nthat the part of it to which importance was attached was the pulling\r\ndown of crosses, which, it seems, was supposed to be practised in\r\nconnection with magic. Hutchinson adds that the act was never put into\r\nexecution either against witches or reformers. The act was certainly\r\npassed during that period of Henry's reign when he was inclining in the\r\nRoman Catholic direction.\" The part of the act to which Hutchinson\r\nrefers reads as follows: \"And for execucion of their saide falce devyses\r\nand practises have made or caused to be made dyvers Images and pictures\r\nof men, women, childrene, Angelles or develles, beastes or fowles, ...\r\nand gyving faithe and credit to suche fantasticall practises have dygged\r\nup and pulled downe an infinite nombre of Crosses within this Realme.\"\r\n\r\n[17] _Parliamentary History_ (London, 1751-1762), III, 229.\r\n\r\n[18] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[19] _Autobiography of Edward Underhill_ (in _Narratives of the Days of\r\nthe Reformation_, Camden Soc., London, 1859), 172-175.\r\n\r\n[20] The measure in fact reached the engrossing stage in the Commons.\r\nBoth houses, however, adjourned early in April and left it unpassed.\r\n\r\n[21] Several of the bishops who were appointed on Elizabeth's accession\r\nhad travelled in South Germany and Switzerland during the Marian period\r\nand had the opportunity of familiarizing themselves with the propaganda\r\nin these parts against witches. Thomas Bentham, who was to be bishop of\r\nCoventry and Lichfield, had retired from England to Zurich and had\r\nafterwards been preacher to the exiles at Basel. John Parkhurst,\r\nappointed bishop of Norwich, had settled in Zurich on Mary's accession.\r\nJohn Scory, appointed bishop of Hereford, had served as chaplain to the\r\nexiles in Geneva. Richard Cox, appointed bishop of Ely, had visited\r\nFrankfort and Strassburg. Edmund Grindall, who was to be the new bishop\r\nof London, had, during his exile, visited Strassburg, Speier, and\r\nFrankfort. Miles Coverdale, who had been bishop of Exeter but who was\r\nnot reappointed, had been in Geneva in the course of his exile. There\r\nwere many other churchmen of less importance who at one time or another\r\nduring the Marian period visited Zurich. See Bullinger's _Diarium_\r\n(Basel, 1904) and Pellican's _Chronikon_ (Basel, 1877), _passim_, as\r\nalso Theodor Vetter, _Relations between England and Zurich during the\r\nReformation_ (London, 1904). At Strassburg the persecution raged\r\nsomewhat later; but how thoroughly Bucer and his colleagues approved and\r\nurged it is clear from a letter of advice addressed by them in 1538 to\r\ntheir fellow pastor Schwebel, of Zweibrücken (printed as No. 88 in the\r\n_Centuria Epistolarum_ appended to Schwebel's _Scripta Theologica_,\r\nZweibrücken, 1605). That Bucer while in England (1549-1551) found also\r\noccasion to utter these views can hardly be doubted. These details I owe\r\nto Professor Burr.\r\n\r\n[22] Various dates have been assigned for Jewel's sermon, but it can be\r\ndetermined approximately from a passage in the discourse. In the course\r\nof the sermon he remarked: \"I would wish that once again, as time should\r\nserve, there might be had a quiet and sober disputation, that each part\r\nmight be required to shew their grounds without self will and without\r\naffection, not to maintain or breed contention, ... but only that the\r\ntruth may be known.... For, at the last disputation that should have\r\nbeen, you know which party gave over and would not meddle.\" This is\r\nclearly an allusion to the Westminster disputation of the last of March,\r\n1559; see John Strype, _Annals of the Reformation_ (London, 1709-1731;\r\nOxford, 1824), ed. of 1824, I, pt. i, 128. The sermon therefore was\r\npreached after that disputation. It may be further inferred that it was\r\npreached before Jewel's controversy with Cole in March, 1560. The words,\r\n\"For at the last disputation ... you know which party gave over and\r\nwould not meddle,\" were hardly written after Cole accepted Jewel's\r\nchallenge. It was on the second Sunday before Easter (March 17), 1560,\r\nthat Jewel delivered at court the discourse in which he challenged\r\ndispute on four points of church doctrine. On the next day Henry Cole\r\naddressed him a letter in which he asked him why he \"yesterday in the\r\nCourt and at all other times at Paul's Cross\" offered rather to \"dispute\r\nin these four points than in the chief matters that lie in question\r\nbetwixt the Church of Rome and the Protestants.\" In replying to Cole on\r\nthe 20th of March Jewel wrote that he stood only upon the negative and\r\nagain mentioned his offer. On the 31st of March he repeated his\r\nchallenge upon the four points, and upon this occasion went very much\r\ninto detail in supporting them. Now, in the sermon which we are trying\r\nto date, the sermon in which allusion is made to the prevalence of\r\nwitches, the four points are briefly named. It may be reasonably\r\nconjectured that this sermon anticipated the elaboration of the four\r\npoints as well as the challenging sermon of March 17. It is as certain\r\nthat it was delivered after Jewel's return to London from his visitation\r\nin the west country. On November 2, 1559, he wrote to Peter Martyr: \"I\r\nhave at last returned to London, with a body worn out by a most\r\nfatiguing journey.\" See _Zurich Letters_, I (Parker Soc., Cambridge,\r\n1842), 44. It is interesting and significant that he adds: \"We found in\r\nall places votive relics of saints, nails with which the infatuated\r\npeople dreamed that Christ had been pierced, and I know not what small\r\nfragments of the sacred cross. The number of witches and sorceresses had\r\neverywhere become enormous.\" Jewel was consecrated Bishop of Salisbury\r\nin the following January, having been nominated in the summer of 1559\r\njust before his western visitation. The sermon in which he alluded to\r\nwitches may have been preached at any time after he returned from the\r\nwest, November 2, and before March 17. It would be entirely natural that\r\nin a court sermon delivered by the newly appointed bishop of Salisbury\r\nthe prevalence of witchcraft should be mentioned. It does not seem a\r\nrash guess that the sermon was preached soon after his return, perhaps\r\nin December, when the impression of what he had seen in the west was\r\nstill fresh in his memory. But it is not necessary to make this\r\nsupposition. Though the discourse was delivered some time after March\r\n15, 1559, when the first bill \"against Conjurations, Prophecies, etc.,\"\r\nwas brought before the Commons (see _Journal of the House of Commons_,\r\nI, 57), it is not unreasonable to believe that there was some connection\r\nbetween the discourse and the fortunes of this bill. That connection\r\nseems the more probable on a careful reading of the Commons Journals for\r\nthe first sessions of Elizabeth's Parliament. It is evident that the\r\nElizabethan legislators were working in close cooperation with the\r\necclesiastical authorities. Jewel's sermon may be found in his _Works_\r\n(ed. for the Parker Soc., Cambridge, 1845-1850), II, 1025-1034. (For the\r\ncorrespondence with Cole see I, 26 ff.)\r\n\r\nFor assistance in dating this sermon the writer wishes to express his\r\nspecial obligation to Professor Burr.\r\n\r\n[23] Strype, _Annals of the Reformation_, I, pt. i, 11. He may, indeed,\r\nmean to ascribe it, not to the sermon, but to the evils alleged by the\r\nsermon.\r\n\r\n[24] In the contemporary account entitled _A True and just Recorde of\r\nthe Information, Examination, and Confession of all the Witches taken at\r\nSt. Oses....

The case mentioned in _Cal. St. P.,\r\nDom., 1581-1590_, 29, was probably a result of the activity of the privy\r\ncouncil. The case in _id._, _Add., 1580-1625_, 120-121, is an instance\r\nof where the accused was suspected of both witchcraft and \"high treason\r\ntouching the supremacy.\" Nearly all of the above mentioned references to\r\nthe activity of the privy council refer to the first half of the reign\r\nand a goodly proportion to the years 1578-1582.\r\n\r\n[42] _Acts P.

See also Scot, _Discoverie_, 51, 543.\r\n\r\n[45] An aged widow had been committed to gaol on the testimony of her\r\nneighbors that she was \"lewde, malitious, and hurtful to the people.\" An\r\nostler, after he had refused to give her relief, had suffered a pain. So\r\nfar as the account goes, this was the sum of the evidence against the\r\nwoman. Unhappily she waited not on the order of her trial but made\r\nvoluble confession and implicated five others, three of whom were\r\nwithout doubt professional enchanters. She had met, she said, with\r\nMother Dutten, Mother Devell, and Mother Margaret, and \"concluded\r\nseveral hainous and vilanous practices.\" The deaths of five persons whom\r\nshe named were the outcome of their concerted plans. For the death of a\r\nsixth she avowed entire responsibility. This amazing confession may have\r\nbeen suggested to her piece by piece, but it was received at full value.\r\nThat she included others in her guilt was perhaps because she responded\r\nto the evident interest aroused by such additions, or more likely\r\nbecause she had grudges unsatisfied. The women were friendless, three of\r\nthe four were partially dependent upon alms, there was no one to come to\r\ntheir help, and they were convicted. The man that had been arraigned, a\r\n\"charmer,\" seems to have gone free.\r\n\r\n[46] _Injunctions ... of ... Bishop of Durham_, 18, 84, 99; Visitations\r\nof Canterbury, in _Arch.

Instance where the Bishop of\r\nLondon seems to have examined a case and turned it over to the privy\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n[55] Rachel Pinder and Agnes Bridges, who pretended to be possessed by\r\nthe Devil, were examined before the \"person of St. Margarets in\r\nLothberry,\" and the Mayor of London, as well as some justices of the\r\npeace. They later made confession before the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nand some justices of the peace. See the black letter pamphlet, _The\r\ndiscloysing of a late counterfeyted possession by the devyl in two\r\nmaydens within the Citie of London_ [1574].\r\n\r\n[56] Francis Coxe came before the queen rather than the church. He\r\nnarrates his experiences in _A short treatise declaringe the detestable\r\nwickednesse of magicall sciences, ..._ (1561). Yet John Walsh, a man\r\nwith a similar record, came before the commissary of the Bishop of\r\nExeter. See _The Examination of John Walsh before Master Thomas\r\nWilliams, Commissary to the Reverend father in God, William, bishop of\r\nExcester, upon certayne Interrogatories touchyng Wytch-crafte and\r\nSorcerye, in the presence of divers gentlemen and others, the XX of\r\nAugust, 1566_.\r\n\r\n[57] We say \"practically,\" because instances of church jurisdiction come\r\nto light now and again throughout the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT UNDER ELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1566 is hardly less interesting in the history of English\r\nwitchcraft than 1563. It has been seen that the new statute passed in\r\n1563 was the beginning of a vigorous prosecution by the state of the\r\ndetested agents of the evil one. In 1566 occurred the first important\r\ntrial known to us in the new period. That trial deserves note not only\r\non its own account, but because it was recorded in the first of the long\r\nseries of witch chap-books--if we may so call them. A very large\r\nproportion of our information about the execution of the witches is\r\nderived from these crude pamphlets, briefly recounting the trials. The\r\nwitch chap-book was a distinct species. In the days when the chronicles\r\nwere the only newspapers it was what is now the \"extra,\" brought out to\r\ncatch the public before the sensation had lost its flavor. It was of\r\ncourse a partisan document, usually a vindication of the worthy judge\r\nwho had condemned the guilty, with some moral and religious\r\nconsiderations by the respectable and righteous author. A terribly\r\nserious bit of history it was that he had to tell and he told it grimly\r\nand without pity. Such comedy as lights up the gloomy black-letter pages\r\nwas quite unintentional. He told a story too that was full of details\r\ntrivial enough in themselves, but details that give many glimpses into\r\nthe every-day life of the lower classes in town and country.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet of 1566 was brief and compact of information. It was\r\nentitled _The examination and confession of certaine Wytches at\r\nChensforde in the Countie of Essex before the Quenes Maiesties Judges\r\nthe XXVI daye of July anno 1566_. The trial there recorded is one that\r\npresents some of the most curious and inexplicable features in the\r\nannals of English witchcraft. The personnel of the \"size\" court is\r\nmysterious. At the first examination \"Doctor Cole\" and \"Master Foscue\"\r\nwere present. Both men are easily identified. Doctor Cole was the\r\nReverend Thomas Cole, who had held several places in Essex and had in\r\n1564 been presented to the rectory of Stanford Rivers, about ten miles\r\nfrom Chelmsford. Master Foscue was unquestionably Sir John Fortescue,\r\nlater Chancellor of the Exchequer, and at this time keeper of the great\r\nwardrobe. On the second examination Sir Gilbert Gerard, the queen's\r\nattorney, and John Southcote, justice of the queen's bench, were\r\npresent. Why Southcote should be present is perfectly clear. It is not\r\nso easy to understand about the others. Was the attorney-general acting\r\nas presiding officer, or was he conducting the prosecution? The latter\r\nhypothesis is of course more consistent with his position. But what were\r\nthe rector of Stanford Rivers and the keeper of the great wardrobe doing\r\nthere? Had Doctor Cole been appointed in recognition of the claims of\r\nthe church? And the keeper of the wardrobe, what was the part that he\r\nplayed? One cannot easily escape the conclusion that the case was deemed\r\none of unusual significance. Perhaps the privy council had heard of\r\nsomething that alarmed it and had delegated these four men, all known\r\nat Elizabeth's court, to examine into the matter in connection with the\r\nassizes.\r\n\r\nThe examinations themselves present features of more interest to the\r\npsychologist than to the historical student. Yet they have some\r\nimportance in the understanding of witchcraft as a social phenomenon.\r\nElizabeth Francis, when examined, confessed with readiness to various\r\n\"vilanies.\" From her grandmother she said she had as a child received a\r\nwhite spotted cat, named Sathan, whom she had fed, and who gave her what\r\nshe asked for. \"She desired to have one Andrew Byles to her husband,\r\nwhich was a man of some welth, and the cat dyd promyse she shold.\" But\r\nthe promise proved illusory. The man left her without marriage and then\r\nshe \"willed Sathan ... to touch his body, whych he forthewith dyd,\r\nwhereof he died.\" Once again she importuned Satan for a husband. This\r\ntime she gained one \"not so rich as the other.\" She bore a daughter to\r\nhim, but the marriage was an unhappy one. \"They lived not so quietly as\r\nshe desyred, beinge stirred to much unquietnes and moved to swearing and\r\ncursinge.\" Thereupon she employed the spirit to kill her child and to\r\nlame her husband. After keeping the cat fifteen years she turned it over\r\nto Mother Waterhouse, \"a pore woman.\"[1]\r\n\r\nMother Waterhouse was now examined. She had received the cat and kept it\r\n\"a great while in woll in a pot.\" She had then turned it into a toad.\r\nShe had used it to kill geese, hogs, and cattle of her neighbors. At\r\nlength she had employed it to kill a neighbor whom she disliked, and\r\nfinally her own husband. The woman's eighteen-year-old daughter, Joan,\r\nwas now called to the stand and confirmed the fact that her mother kept\r\na toad. She herself had one day been refused a piece of bread and cheese\r\nby a neighbor's child and had invoked the toad's help. The toad promised\r\nto assist her if she would surrender her soul. She did so. Then the toad\r\nhaunted the neighbor's girl in the form of a dog with horns. The mother\r\nwas again called to the stand and repeated the curious story told by her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nNow the neighbor's child, Agnes Brown, was brought in to testify. Her\r\nstory tallied in some of its details with that of the two Waterhouse\r\nwomen; she had been haunted by the horned dog, and she added certain\r\ndescriptions of its conduct that revealed good play of childish\r\nimagination.[2]\r\n\r\nThe attorney put some questions, but rather to lead on the witnesses\r\nthan to entangle them. He succeeded, however, in creating a violent\r\naltercation between the Waterhouses on the one hand, and Agnes Brown on\r\nthe other, over trifling matters of detail.[3] At length he offered to\r\nrelease Mother Waterhouse if she would make the spirit appear in the\r\ncourt.[4] The offer was waived. The attorney then asked, \"When dyd thye\r\nCat suck of thy bloud?\" \"Never,\" said she. He commanded the jailer to\r\nlift up the \"kercher\" on the woman's head. He did so and the spots on\r\nher face and nose where she had pricked herself for the evil spirit were\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nThe jury retired. Two days later Agnes Waterhouse suffered the penalty\r\nof the law, not however until she had added to her confessions.[5]\r\n\r\nThe case is a baffling one. We can be quite sure that the pamphlet\r\naccount is incomplete. One would like to know more about the substance\r\nof fact behind this evidence. Did the parties that were said to have\r\nbeen killed by witchcraft really die at the times specified? Either the\r\nfacts of their deaths were well known in the community and were fitted\r\nwith great cleverness into the story Mother Waterhouse told, or the\r\njurors and the judges neglected the first principles of common sense and\r\nfailed to inquire about the facts.[6] The questions asked by the queen's\r\nattorney reveal hardly more than an unintelligent curiosity to know the\r\nrest of the story. He shows just one saving glint of skepticism. He\r\noffered to release Mother Waterhouse if she would materialize her\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nMother Waterhouse was her own worst enemy. Her own testimony was the\r\nprincipal evidence presented against her, and yet she denied guilt on\r\none particular upon which the attorney-general had interrogated her.\r\nThis might lead one to suppose that her answers were the haphazard\r\nreplies of a half-witted woman. But the supposition is by no means\r\nconsistent with the very definite and clear-cut nature of her testimony.\r\nIt is useless to try to unravel the tangles of the case. It is possible\r\nthat under some sort of duress--although there is no evidence of\r\nthis--she had deliberately concocted a story to fit those of Elizabeth\r\nFrancis and Agnes Brown, and that her daughter, hearing her mother's\r\nnarrative in court--a very possible thing in that day--had fitted hers\r\ninto it. It is conceivable too that Mother Waterhouse had yielded merely\r\nto the wish to amaze her listeners. It is a more probable supposition\r\nthat the questions asked of her by the judge were based upon the\r\naccusations already made by Agnes Brown and that they suggested to her\r\nthe main outlines of her narrative.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Francis, who had been the first accused and who had accused\r\nMother Waterhouse, escaped. Whether it was because she had turned\r\nstate's evidence or because she had influential friends in the\r\ncommunity, we do not know. It is possible that the judges recognized\r\nthat her confession was unsupported by the testimony of other witnesses.\r\nSuch a supposition, however, credits the court with keener\r\ndiscrimination than seems ever to have been exhibited in such cases in\r\nthe sixteenth century.[7]\r\n\r\nBut, though Elizabeth Francis had escaped, her reputation as a dangerous\r\nwoman in the community was fixed. Thirteen years later she was again put\r\non trial before the itinerant justices. This brings us to the second\r\ntrial of witches at Chelmsford in 1579. Mistress Francis's examination\r\nelicited less than in the first trial. She had cursed a woman \"and badde\r\na mischief to light uppon her.\" The woman, she understood, was\r\ngrievously pained. She followed the course that she had taken before\r\nand began to accuse others. We know very little as to the outcome. At\r\nleast one of the women accused went free because \"manslaughter or murder\r\nwas not objected against her.\"[8] Three women, however, were condemned\r\nand executed. One of them was almost certainly Elleine Smith, daughter\r\nof a woman hanged as a witch,--another illustration of the persistence\r\nof suspicion against the members of a family.\r\n\r\nThe Chelmsford affair of 1579[9] was not unlike that of 1566. There were\r\nthe same tales of spirits that assumed animal forms. The young son of\r\nElleine Smith declared that his mother kept three spirits, Great Dick in\r\na wicker bottle, Little Dick in a leathern bottle, and Willet in a\r\nwool-pack. Goodwife Webb saw \"a thyng like a black Dogge goe out of her\r\ndoore.\" But the general character of the testimony in the second trial\r\nbore no relation to that in the first. There was no agreement of the\r\ndifferent witnesses. The evidence was haphazard. The witch and another\r\nwoman had a falling out--fallings out were very common. Next day the\r\nwoman was taken ill. This was the sort of unimpeachable testimony that\r\nwas to be accepted for a century yet. In the affair of 1566 the judges\r\nhad made some attempt at quizzing the witnesses, but in 1579 all\r\ntestimony was seemingly rated at par.[10] In both instances the proof\r\nrested mainly upon confession. Every woman executed had made\r\nconfessions of guilt. This of course was deemed sufficient. Nevertheless\r\nthe courts were beginning to introduce other methods of proving the\r\naccused guilty. The marks on Agnes Waterhouse had been uncovered at the\r\nrequest of the attorney-general; and at her execution she had been\r\nquestioned about her ability to say the Lord's Prayer and other parts of\r\nthe service. Neither of these matters was emphasized, but the mention of\r\nthem proves that notions were already current that were later to have\r\ngreat vogue.\r\n\r\nThe Chelmsford cases find their greatest significance, however, not as\r\nillustrations of the use and abuse of evidence, but because they\r\nexemplify the continuity of the witch movement. That continuity finds\r\nfurther illustration in the fact that there was a third alarm at\r\nChelmsford in 1589, which resulted in three more executions. But in this\r\ncase the women involved seem, so far as we know, to have had no\r\nconnection with the earlier cases. The fate of Elizabeth Francis and\r\nthat of Elleine Smith are more instructive as proof of the long-standing\r\nnature of a community suspicion. Elleine could not escape her mother's\r\nreputation nor Elizabeth her own.\r\n\r\nBoth these women seem to have been of low character at any rate.\r\nElizabeth had admitted illicit amours, and Elleine may very well have\r\nbeen guilty on the same count.[11] All of the women involved in the two\r\ntrials were in circumstances of wretched poverty; most, if not all, of\r\nthem were dependent upon begging and the poor relief for support.[12]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine the excitement in Essex that these trials must\r\nhave produced. The accused had represented a wide territory in the\r\ncounty. The women had been fetched to Chelmsford from towns as far apart\r\nas Hatfield-Peverel and Maldon. It is not remarkable that three years\r\nlater than the affair of 1579 there should have been another outbreak in\r\nthe county, this time in a more aggravated form. St. Oses, or St.\r\nOsyth's, to the northeast of Chelmsford, was to be the scene of the most\r\nremarkable affair of its kind in Elizabethan times. The alarm began with\r\nthe formulation of charges against a woman of the community. Ursley Kemp\r\nwas a poor woman of doubtful reputation. She rendered miscellaneous\r\nservices to her neighbors. She acted as midwife, nursed children, and\r\nadded to her income by \"unwitching\" the diseased. Like other women of\r\nthe sort, she was looked upon with suspicion. Hence, when she had been\r\nrefused the nursing of the child of Grace Thurlow, a servant of that Mr.\r\nDarcy who was later to try her, and when the child soon afterward fell\r\nout of its cradle and broke its neck, the mother suspected Ursley of\r\nwitchcraft. Nevertheless she did not refuse her help when she \"began to\r\nhave a lameness in her bones.\" Ursley promised to unwitch her and\r\nseemingly kept her word, for the lameness disappeared. Then it was that\r\nthe nurse-woman asked for the twelve-pence she had been promised and was\r\nrefused. Grace pleaded that she was a \"poore and needie woman.\" Ursley\r\nbecame angry and threatened to be even with her. The lameness reappeared\r\nand Grace Thurlow was thoroughly convinced that Ursley was to blame.\r\nWhen the case was carried before the justices of the peace, the accused\r\nwoman denied that she was guilty of anything more than unwitching the\r\nafflicted. That she had learned, she said, ten or more years ago from a\r\nwoman now deceased. She was committed to the assizes, and Justice Brian\r\nDarcy, whose servant Grace Thurlow had started the trouble, took the\r\ncase in hand. He examined her eight-year-old \"base son,\" who gave\r\ndamning evidence against his mother. She fed four imps, Tyffin, Tittey,\r\nPiggen, and Jacket. The boy's testimony and the judge's promise that if\r\nshe would confess the truth she \"would have favour,\" seemed to break\r\ndown the woman's resolution. \"Bursting out with weeping she fell upon\r\nher knees and confessed that she had four spirits.\" Two of them she had\r\nused for laming, two for killing. Not only the details of her son's\r\nevidence, but all the earlier charges, she confirmed step by step, first\r\nin private confessions to the judge and then publicly at the court\r\nsessions. The woman's stories tallied with those of all her accusers[13]\r\nand displayed no little play of imagination in the orientation of\r\ndetails.[14] Not content with thus entangling herself in a fearful web\r\nof crime, she went on to point out other women guilty of similar\r\nwitchcrafts. Four of those whom she named were haled before the justice.\r\nElizabeth Bennett, who spun wool for a cloth-maker, was one of those\r\nmost vehemently accused, but she denied knowledge of any kind of\r\nwitchcraft. It had been charged against her that she kept some wool\r\nhidden in a pot under some stones in her house. She denied at first the\r\npossession of this potent and malignant charm; but, influenced by the\r\ngentle urgings of Justice Darcy,[15] she gave way, as Ursley Kemp had\r\ndone, and, breaking all restraint, poured forth wild stories of devilish\r\ncrimes committed through the assistance of her imps.\r\n\r\nBut why should we trace out the confessions, charges, and\r\ncounter-charges that followed? The stories that were poured forth\r\ncontinued to involve a widening group until sixteen persons were under\r\naccusation of the most awful crimes, committed by demoniacal agency. As\r\nat Chelmsford, they were the dregs of the lower classes, women with\r\nillegitimate children, some of them dependent upon public support. It\r\nwill be seen that in some respects the panic bore a likeness to those\r\nthat had preceded. The spirits, which took extraordinary and bizarre\r\nforms, were the offspring of the same perverted imaginations, but they\r\nhad assumed new shapes. Ursley Kemp kept a white lamb, a little gray\r\ncat, a black cat, and a black toad. There were spirits of every sort,\r\n\"two little thyngs like horses, one white, the other black'\"; six\r\n\"spirits like cowes ... as big as rattles\"; spirits masquerading as\r\nblackbirds. One spirit strangely enough remained invisible. It will be\r\nobserved by the reader that the spirits almost fitted into a color\r\nscheme. Very vivid colors were those preferred in their spirits by these\r\nSt. Oses women. The reader can see, too, that the confessions showed the\r\ninfluence of the great cat tradition.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the readiness with which the deluded women made confession.\r\nSome of the confessions were poured forth as from souls long surcharged\r\nwith guilt. But not all of them came in this way. Margerie Sammon, who\r\nhad testified against one of her neighbors, was finally herself caught\r\nin the web of accusation in which a sister had also been involved. She\r\nwas accused by her sister. \"I defie thee,\" she answered, \"though thou\r\nart my sister.\" But her sister drew her aside and \"whyspered her in the\r\neare,\" after which, with \"great submission and many teares,\" she made a\r\nvoluble confession. One wonders about that whispered consultation. Had\r\nher sister perhaps suggested that the justice was offering mercy to\r\nthose who confessed? For Justice Darcy was very liberal with his\r\npromises of mercy and absolutely unscrupulous about breaking them.[16]\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to record that there was yet a remnant left\r\nwho confessed nothing at all and stood stubborn to the last. One of them\r\nwas Margaret Grevel, who denied the accusations against her. She \"saith\r\nthat shee herselfe hath lost severall bruings and bakings of bread, and\r\nalso swine, but she never did complaine thereof: saying that shee wished\r\nher gere were at a stay and then shee cared not whether shee were hanged\r\nor burnt or what did become of her.\" Annis Herd was another who stuck to\r\nher innocence. She could recall various incidents mentioned by her\r\naccusers; it was true that she had talked to Andrew West about getting a\r\npig, it was true that she had seen Mr. Harrison at his parsonage\r\ngathering plums and had asked for some and been refused. But she denied\r\nthat she had any imps or that she had killed any one.\r\n\r\nThe use of evidence in this trial would lead one to suppose that in\r\nEngland no rules of evidence were yet in existence. The testimony of\r\nchildren ranging in age from six to nine was eagerly received. No\r\nobjection indeed was made to the testimony of a neighbor who professed\r\nto have overheard what he deemed an incriminating statement. As a matter\r\nof fact the remark, if made, was harmless enough.[17] Expert evidence\r\nwas introduced in a roundabout way by the statement offered in court\r\nthat a physician had suspected that a certain case was witchcraft.\r\nNothing was excluded. The garrulous women had been give free rein to\r\npile up their silly accusations against one another. Not until the trial\r\nwas nearing its end does it seem to have occurred to Brian Darcy to warn\r\na woman against making false charges.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in the Chelmsford trials Mother Waterhouse had\r\nbeen found to have upon her certain marks, yet little emphasis had been\r\nlaid upon them. In the trials of 1582 the proof drawn from these marks\r\nwas deemed of the first importance and the judge appointed juries of\r\nwomen to make examination. No artist has yet dared to paint the picture\r\nof the gloating female inquisitors grouped around their naked and\r\ntrembling victim, a scene that was to be enacted in many a witch trial.\r\nAnd it is well, for the scene would be too repellent and brutal for\r\nreproduction. In the use of these specially instituted juries there was\r\nno care to get unbiassed decisions. One of the inquisitors appointed to\r\nexamine Cystley Celles had already served as witness against her.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to refrain from an indictment of the hopelessly prejudiced\r\njustice who gathered the evidence.[18] To entrap the defendants seems to\r\nhave been his end. In the account which he wrote[19] he seems to have\r\nfeared lest the public should fail to understand how his cleverness\r\nministered to the conviction of the women.[20]\r\n\r\n\"There is a man,\" he wrote, \"of great cunning and knowledge come over\r\nlately unto our Queenes Maiestie, which hath advertised her what a\r\ncompanie and number of witches be within Englande: whereupon I and other\r\nof her Justices have received commission for the apprehending of as many\r\nas are within these limites.\" No doubt he hoped to attract royal notice\r\nand win favor by his zeal.\r\n\r\nThe Chelmsford affairs and that at St. Oses were the three remarkable\r\ntrials of their kind in the first part of Elizabeth's reign. They\r\nfurnish some evidence of the progress of superstition. The procedure in\r\n1582 reveals considerable advance over that of 1566. The theory of\r\ndiabolic agency had been elaborated. The testimony offered was gaining\r\nin complexity and in variety. New proofs of guilt were being introduced\r\nas well as new methods of testing the matter. In the second part of\r\nElizabeth's reign we have but one trial of unusual interest, that at\r\nWarboys in Huntingdonshire. This, we shall see, continued the\r\nelaboration of the witch procedure. It was a case that attracted\r\nprobably more notice at the time than any other in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The accidental fancy of a child and the pronouncement of a\r\nbaffled physician were in this instance the originating causes of the\r\ntrouble. One of the children of Sir Robert Throckmorton, head of a\r\nprominent family in Huntingdonshire, was taken ill. It so happened that\r\na neighbor, by name Alice Samuel, called at the house and the ailing and\r\nnervous child took the notion that the woman was a witch and cried out\r\nagainst her. \"Did you ever see, sayd the child, one more like a witch\r\nthen she is; take off her blacke thrumbd cap, for I cannot abide to\r\nlooke on her.\" Her parents apparently thought nothing of this at the\r\ntime. When Dr. Barrow, an eminent physician of Cambridge, having treated\r\nthe child for two of the diseases of children, and without success,\r\nasked the mother and father if any witchcraft were suspected, he was\r\nanswered in the negative. The Throckmortons were by no means quick to\r\nharbor a suspicion. But when two and then three other children in the\r\nfamily fell ill and began in the same way to designate Mother Samuel as\r\na witch, the parents were more willing to heed the hint thrown out by\r\nthe physician. The suspected woman was forcibly brought by Gilbert\r\nPickering, an uncle of the children, into their presence. The children\r\nat once fell upon the ground \"strangely tormented,\" and insisted upon\r\nscratching Mother Samuel's hand. Meantime Lady Cromwell[21] visited at\r\nthe Throckmorton house, and, after an interview with Alice Samuel,\r\nsuffered in her dreams from her till at length she fell ill and died,\r\nsomething over a year later. This confirmed what had been suspicion. To\r\ndetail all the steps taken to prove Mother Samuel guilty is unnecessary.\r\nA degree of caution was used which was remarkable. Henry Pickering, a\r\nrelative, and some of his fellow scholars at Cambridge made an\r\ninvestigation into the case, but decided with the others that the woman\r\nwas guilty. Mother Samuel herself laid the whole trouble to the\r\nchildren's \"wantonness.\" Again and again she was urged by the children\r\nto confess. \"Such were the heavenly and divine speeches of the children\r\nin their fits to this old woman ... as that if a man had heard it he\r\nwould not have thought himself better edified at ten sermons.\" The\r\nparents pleaded with her to admit her responsibility for the constantly\r\nrecurring sickness of their children, but she denied bitterly that she\r\nwas to blame. She was compelled to live at the Throckmorton house and to\r\nbe a witness constantly to the strange behavior of the children. The\r\npoor creature was dragged back and forth, watched and experimented upon\r\nin a dozen ways, until it is little wonder that she grew ill and spent\r\nher nights in groaning. She was implored to confess and told that all\r\nmight yet be well. For a long time she persisted in her denial, but at\r\nlength in a moment of weakness, when the children had come out of their\r\nfits at her chance exhortation to them, she became convinced that she\r\nwas guilty and exclaimed, \"O sir, I have been the cause of all this\r\ntrouble to your children.\" The woman, who up to this time had shown some\r\nspirit, had broken down. She now confessed that she had given her soul\r\nto the Devil. A clergyman was hastily sent for, who preached a sermon of\r\nrepentance, upon which the distracted woman made a public confession.\r\nBut on the next day, after she had been refreshed by sleep and had been\r\nin her own home again, she denied her confession. The constable now\r\nprepared to take the woman as well as her daughter to the Bishop of\r\nLincoln, and the frightened creature again made a confession. In the\r\npresence of the bishop she reiterated her story in detail and gave the\r\nnames of her spirits. She was put in gaol at Huntingdon and with her\r\nwere imprisoned her daughter Agnes and her husband John Samuel, who were\r\nnow accused by the Throckmorton children, and all three were tried at\r\nthe assizes in Huntingdon before Judge Fenner. The facts already\r\nnarrated were given in evidence, the seizures of the children at the\r\nappearance of any of the Samuel family[22], the certainty with which the\r\nchildren could with closed eyes pick Mother Samuel out of a crowd and\r\nscratch her, the confessions of the crazed creature, all these evidences\r\nwere given to the court. But the strongest proof was that given in the\r\npresence of the court. The daughter Agnes Samuel was charged to repeat,\r\n\"As I am a witch and consenting to the death of Lady Cromwell, I charge\r\nthee, come out of her.\"[23] At this charge the children would at once\r\nrecover from their fits. But a charge phrased negatively, \"As I am no\r\nwitch,\" was ineffectual. And the affirmative charge, when tried by some\r\nother person, had no result. This was deemed conclusive proof. The woman\r\nwas beyond doubt guilty. The same method was applied with equally\r\nsuccessful issue to the father. When he refused to use the words of the\r\ncharge he was warned by the judge that he would endanger his life. He\r\ngave way.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the grand jury arraigned all three of the\r\nfamily and that the \"jury of life and death\" found them guilty. It\r\nneeded but a five hours' trial.[24] The mother was induced to plead\r\npregnancy as a delay to execution, but after an examination by a jury\r\nwas adjudged not pregnant. The daughter had been urged to make the same\r\ndefence, but spiritedly replied, \"It shall never be said that I was both\r\na witch and a whore.\" At the execution the mother made another\r\nconfession, in which she implicated her husband, but refused to the end\r\nto accuse her daughter.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end it had been the strong against the weak. Sir\r\nRobert Throckmorton, Sir Henry Cromwell, William Wickham, Bishop of\r\nLincoln, the justices of the peace, Justice Fenner of the king's court,\r\nthe Cambridge scholars, the \"Doctor of Divinitie,\" and two other\r\nclergymen, all were banded together against this poor but respectable\r\nfamily. In some respects the trial reminds us of one that was to take\r\nplace ninety-nine years later in Massachusetts. The part played by the\r\nchildren in the two instances was very similar. Mother Samuel had hit\r\nthe nail on the head when she said that the trouble was due to the\r\nchildren's \"wantonness.\" Probably the first child had really suffered\r\nfrom some slight ailment. The others were imitators eager to gain notice\r\nand pleased with their success; and this fact was realized by some\r\npeople at the time. \"It had been reported by some in the county, those\r\nthat thought themselves wise, that this Mother Samuel ... was an old\r\nsimple woman, and that one might make her by fayre words confesse what\r\nthey would.\" Moreover the tone of the writer's defense makes it evident\r\nthat others beside Mother Samuel laid the action of the Throckmorton\r\nchildren to \"wantonness.\" And six years later Samuel Harsnett, chaplain\r\nto the Bishop of London and a man already influential, called the\r\naccount of the affair \"a very ridiculous booke\" and evidently believed\r\nthe children guilty of the same pretences as William Somers, whose\r\nconfessions of imposture he was relating.[25]\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that the Warboys affair was the only celebrated\r\ntrial of its sort in the last part of Elizabeth's reign--that is, from\r\nthe time of Reginald Scot to the accession of James I. This does not\r\nmean that the superstition was waning or that the trials were on the\r\ndecrease. The records show that the number of trials was steadily\r\nincreasing. They were more widely distributed. London was still the\r\ncentre of the belief. Chief-Justice Anderson sent Joan Kerke to Tyburn\r\nand the Middlesex sessions were still occupied with accusations. The\r\ncounties adjacent to it could still claim more than two-thirds of the\r\nexecutions. But a far wider area was infected with the superstition.\r\nNorfolk in East Anglia, Leicester, Nottingham and Derby in the\r\nMidlands, and York and Northumberland in the North were all involved.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there are two tendencies that appear very clearly\r\ntowards the last part of Elizabeth's reign. On the one hand the feeling\r\nof the people against witchcraft was growing in intensity, while on the\r\nother the administration at London was inclined to be more lenient.\r\nPardons and reprieves were issued to women already condemned,[26] while\r\nsome attempt was made to curb popular excitement. The attitude of the\r\nqueen towards the celebrated John Dee was an instance in point. Dee was\r\nan eminent alchemist, astrologer, and spiritualist of his time. He has\r\nleft a diary which shows us his half mystic, half scientific pursuits.\r\nIn the earlier part of Mary's reign he had been accused of attempting\r\npoison or magic against the queen and had been imprisoned and examined\r\nby the privy council and by the Star Chamber. At Elizabeth's accession\r\nhe had cast the horoscope for her coronation day, and he was said to\r\nhave revealed to the queen who were her enemies at foreign courts. More\r\nthan once afterwards Dee was called upon by the queen to render her\r\nservices when she was ill or when some mysterious design against her\r\nperson was feared. While he dealt with many curious things, he had\r\nconsistently refused to meddle with conjuring. Indeed he had rebuked the\r\nconjurer Hartley and had refused to help the bewitched Margaret Byrom of\r\nCleworth in Lancashire. Sometime about 1590 Dee's enemies--and he had\r\nmany--put in circulation stories of his success as a conjurer. It was\r\nthe more easy to do, because for a long time he had been suspected by\r\nmany of unlawful dealings with spirits. His position became dangerous.\r\nHe appealed to Elizabeth for protection and she gave him assurance that\r\nhe might push on with his studies. Throughout her life the queen\r\ncontinued to stand by Dee,[27] and it was not until a new sovereign came\r\nto the throne that he again came into danger. But the moral of the\r\nincident is obvious. The privy council, so nervous about the conjurers\r\nin the days of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Catholic and Spanish plots,\r\nwas now resting easier and refused to be affrighted.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the pardons issued as one of the evidences\r\nof the more lenient policy of the government. That policy appeared too\r\nin the lessening rigor of the assize judges. The first half of\r\nElizabeth's reign had been marked by few acquittals. Nearly half the\r\ncases of which we have record in the second part resulted in the\r\ndischarge of the accused. Whether the judges were taking their cue from\r\nthe privy council or whether some of them were feeling the same reaction\r\nagainst the cruelty of the prosecutions, it is certain that there was a\r\nconsiderable nullifying of the force of the belief. We shall see in the\r\nchapter on Reginald Scot that his _Discoverie of Witchcraft_ was said to\r\nhave \"affected the magistracy and the clergy.\" It is hard to lay one's\r\nfinger upon influences of this sort, but we can hardly doubt that there\r\nwas some connection between Scot's brave indictment of the witch-triers\r\nand the lessening severity of court verdicts. When George Gifford, the\r\nnon-conformist clergyman at Maiden, wrote his _Dialogue concerning\r\nWitches_, in which he earnestly deprecated the conviction of so many\r\nwitches, he dedicated the book \"to the Right Worshipful Maister Robert\r\nClarke, one of her Maiesties Barons of her Highnesse Court of the\r\nExchequer,\" and wrote that he had been \"delighted to heare and see the\r\nwise and godly course used upon the seate of justice by your worship,\r\nwhen such have bene arraigned.\" Unfortunately there is not much evidence\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\nOne other fact must not be overlooked. A large percentage of the cases\r\nthat went against the accused were in towns judicially independent of\r\nthe assize courts. At Faversham, at Lynn, at Yarmouth, and at\r\nLeicester[28] the local municipal authorities were to blame for the\r\nhanging of witches. The regular assize courts had nothing to do with the\r\nmatter. The case at Faversham in Kent was unusual. Joan Cason was\r\nindicted for bewitching to death a three-year-old child. Eight of her\r\nneighbors, seven of them women, \"poore people,\" testified against her.\r\nThe woman took up her own cause with great spirit and exposed the\r\nmalicious dealings of her adversaries and also certain controversies\r\nbetwixt her and them. \"But although she satisfied the bench,\" says\r\nHolinshed, \"and all the jurie touching hir innocencie ... she ...\r\nconfessed that a little vermin, being of colour reddish, of stature\r\nlesse than a rat ... did ... haunt her house.\" She was willing too to\r\nadmit illicit relations with one Mason, whose housekeeper she had\r\nbeen--probably the original cause of her troubles. The jury acquitted\r\nher of witchcraft, but found her guilty of the \"invocation of evil\r\nspirits,\" intending to send her to the pillory. While the mayor was\r\nadmonishing her, a lawyer called attention to the point that the\r\ninvocation of evil spirits had been made a felony. The mayor sentenced\r\nthe woman to execution. But, \"because there was no matter of invocation\r\ngiven in evidence against hir, ... hir execution was staied by the space\r\nof three daies.\" Sundry preachers tried to wring confessions from her,\r\nbut to no purpose. Yet she made so godly an end, says the chronicler,\r\nthat \"manie now lamented hir death which were before hir utter\r\nenimies.\"[29] The case illustrates vividly the clumsiness of municipal\r\ncourt procedure. The mayor's court was unfamiliar with the law and\r\nutterly unable to avert the consequences of its own finding. In the\r\nregular assize courts, Joan Cason would probably have been sentenced to\r\nfour public appearances in the pillory.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the first half and the second half of\r\nElizabeth's reign have not been deemed wide enough by the writer to\r\njustify separate treatment. The whole reign was a time when the\r\nsuperstition was gaining ground. Yet in the span of years from Reginald\r\nScot to the death of Elizabeth there was enough of reaction to justify a\r\ndifferentiation of statistics. In both periods, and more particularly in\r\nthe first, we may be sure that some of the records have been lost and\r\nthat a thorough search of local archives would reveal some trials of\r\nwhich we have at present no knowledge. It was a time rich in mention of\r\nwitch trials, but a time too when but few cases were fully described.\r\nScot's incidental references to the varied experiences of Sir Roger\r\nManwood and of his uncle Sir Thomas Scot merely confirm an impression\r\ngained from the literature of the time that the witch executions were\r\nbecoming, throughout the seventies and early eighties, too common to be\r\nremarkable. For the second period we have record of probably a larger\r\npercentage of all the cases. For the whole time from 1563, when the new\r\nlaw went into effect, down to 1603, we have records of nearly fifty\r\nexecutions. Of these just about two-thirds occurred in the earlier\r\nperiod, while of the acquittals two-thirds belong to the later period.\r\nIt would be rash to attach too much significance to these figures. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the records are so incomplete that the actual totals\r\nhave little if any meaning and only the proportions can be\r\nconsidered.[30] Yet it looks as if the forces which caused the\r\npersecution of witches in England were beginning to abate; and it may\r\nfairly be inquired whether some new factor may not have entered into the\r\nsituation. It is time to speak of Reginald Scot and of the exorcists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Who from a confession made in 1579 seems to have been her sister.\r\nSee the pamphlet _A Detection of damnable driftes, practised by three\r\nWitches arraigned at Chelmsforde in Essex at the last Assizes there\r\nholden, which were executed in Aprill, 1579_ (London, 1579).\r\n\r\n[2] _E. g._: \"I was afearde for he [the dog with horns] skypped and\r\nleaped to and fro, and satte on the toppe of a nettle.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Whether Agnes Waterhouse had a \"daggar's knife\" and whether the dog\r\nhad the face of an ape.\r\n\r\n[4] An offer which indicates that he was acting as judge.\r\n\r\n[5] She was questioned on her church habits. She claimed to be a regular\r\nattendant; she \"prayed right hartely there.\" She admitted, however, that\r\nshe prayed \"in laten\" because Sathan would not let her pray in English.\r\n\r\n[6] There is of course the further possibility that the pamphlet account\r\nwas largely invented. A critical examination of the pamphlet tends to\r\nestablish its trustworthiness. See appendix A, § 1.\r\n\r\n[7] Alice Chandler was probably hanged at this time. The failure to\r\nmention her name is easily explained when we remember that the pamphlet\r\nwas issued in two parts, as soon as possible after the event. Alice\r\nChandler's case probably did not come up for trial until the two parts\r\nof the pamphlet had already been published. See _A Detection of damnable\r\ndriftes_.\r\n\r\n[8] Mother Staunton, who had apparently made some pretensions to the\r\npractice of magic, was arraigned on several charges. She had been\r\nrefused her requests by several people, who had thereupon suffered some\r\nills.\r\n\r\n[9] It is possible that the whole affair started from the whim of a sick\r\nchild, who, when she saw Elleine Smith, cried, \"Away with the witch.\"\r\n\r\n[10] A caution here. The pamphlets were hastily compiled and perhaps\r\nleft out important facts.\r\n\r\n[11] Her eight-year-old boy was probably illegitimate.\r\n\r\n[12] Mother Waterhouse's knowledge of Latin, if that is more than the\r\nfiction of a Protestant pamphleteer, is rather remarkable.\r\n\r\n[13] Allowance must be made for a very prejudiced reporter, _i. e._, the\r\njudge himself.\r\n\r\n[14] These details were very probably suggested to her by the judge.\r\n\r\n[15] Who promised her also \"favour.\"\r\n\r\n[16] The detestable methods of Justice Darcy come out in the case of a\r\nwoman from whom he threatened to remove her imps if she did not confess,\r\nand by that means trapped her into the incriminating statement, \"That\r\nshal ye not.\"\r\n\r\n[17] William Hooke had heard William Newman \"bid the said Ales his wife\r\nto beate it away.\" Comparable with this was the evidence of Margerie\r\nSammon who \"sayeth that the saide widow Hunt did tell her that shee had\r\nharde the said Joan Pechey, being in her house, verie often to chide and\r\nvehemently speaking, ... and sayth that shee went in to see, ... shee\r\nfounde no bodie but herselfe alone.\"\r\n\r\n[18] Reginald Scot, _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 542, says of this trial,\r\n\"In the meane time let anie man with good consideration peruse that\r\nbooke published by W. W. and it shall suffice to satisfie him in all\r\nthat may be required.... See whether the witnesses be not single, of\r\nwhat credit, sex, and age they are; namelie lewd miserable and envious\r\npoore people; most of them which speake to anie purpose being old women\r\nand children of the age of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 yeares.\"\r\n\r\n[19] There can be no doubt that Brian Darcy either wrote the account\r\nhimself or dictated it to \"W. W.\" The frequent use of \"me,\" meaning by\r\nthat pronoun the judge, indicates that he was responsible.\r\n\r\n[20] It is some relief in this trial to read the testimony of John\r\nTendering about William Byett. He had a cow \"in a strange case.\" He\r\ncould not lift it. He put fire under the cow, she got up and \"there\r\nstood still and fell a byting of stickes larger than any man's finger\r\nand after lived and did well.\"\r\n\r\n[21] Second wife of Sir Henry Cromwell, who was the grandfather of\r\nOliver.\r\n\r\n[22] The children were strangely inconsistent. At the first they had\r\nfits when Mother Samuel appeared. Later they were troubled unless Mother\r\nSamuel were kept in the house, or unless they were taken to her house.\r\n\r\n[23] This device seems to have been originally suggested by the children\r\nto try Mother Samuel's guilt.\r\n\r\n[24] The clergyman, \"Doctor Dorrington,\" had been one of the leaders in\r\nprosecuting them.\r\n\r\n[25] Harsnett, _Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel_\r\n(London, 1599), 92, 97.\r\n\r\n[26] Among the manuscripts on witchcraft in the Bodleian Library are\r\nthree such pardons of witches for their witchcraft--one of Jane Mortimer\r\nin 1595, one of Rosa Bexwell in 1600, and one of \"Alice S.,\" without\r\ndate but under Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[27] In 1595 he was made warden of the Manchester Collegiate Church. Dee\r\nhas in our days found a biographer. See _John Dee_ (1527-1608), by\r\nCharlotte Fell Smith (London, 1909).\r\n\r\n[28] For the particular case, see Mary Bateson, ed., _Records of the\r\nBorough of Leicester_ (Cambridge, 1899), III. 335; for the general\r\nletters patent covering such cases see _id._, II, 365, 366.\r\n\r\n[29] For this story see Ralph Holinshed, _Chronicles of England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland_ (London, 1577, reprinted 1586-1587 and\r\n1807-1808), ed. of 1807-1808, IV, 891, 893. Faversham was then\r\n\"Feversham.\"\r\n\r\n[30] Justice Anderson, when sentencing a witch to a year's imprisonment,\r\ndeclared that this was the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth witch he had\r\ncondemned. This is good evidence that the records of many cases have\r\nbeen lost. See Brit. Mus., Sloane MS. 831, f. 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nREGINALD SCOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the chronicling of witch trials we turn aside in this chapter to\r\nfollow the career of the first great English opponent of the\r\nsuperstition. We have seen how the attack upon the supposed creatures of\r\nthe Devil was growing stronger throughout the reign of Elizabeth. We\r\nshall see how that attack was checked, at least in some degree, by the\r\nresistance of one man. Few men of so quiet and studious life have\r\nwrought so effectively as Reginald Scot. He came of a family well known\r\nin Kent, but not politically aggressive. As a young man he studied at\r\nHart Hall[1] in Oxford, but left without taking his degree and returned\r\nto Scots-Hall, where he settled down to the routine duties of managing\r\nhis estate. He gave himself over, we are told, to husbandry and\r\ngardening and to a solid course of general reading in the obscure\r\nauthors that had \"by the generality been neglected.\" In 1574 his studies\r\nin horticulture resulted in the publication of _A Perfect Platforme of a\r\nHoppe-Garden and necessary instructions for the making and maintaining\r\nthereof_. That the book ministered to a practical interest was evidenced\r\nby the call for three editions within five years. Whether he now applied\r\nhimself to the study of that subject which was to be the theme of his\r\n_Discoverie_, we do not know. It was a matter which had doubtless\r\narrested his attention even earlier and had enlisted a growing interest\r\nupon his part. Not until a decade after his _Hoppe-Garden_, however, did\r\nhe put forth the epoch-making _Discoverie_. Nor does it seem likely that\r\nhe had been engaged for a long period on the actual composition. Rather,\r\nthe style and matter of the book seem to evince traces of hurry in\r\npreparation. If this theory be true--and Mr. Brinsley Nicholson, his\r\nmodern commentator, has adduced excellent reasons for accepting\r\nit[2]--there can be but one explanation, the St. Oses affair. That\r\ntragedy, occurring within a short distance of his own home, had no doubt\r\nso outraged his sense of justice, that the work which he had perhaps\r\nlong been contemplating he now set himself to complete as soon as\r\npossible.[3] Even he who runs may read in Scot's strong sentences that\r\nhe was not writing for instruction only, to propound a new doctrine, but\r\nthat he was battling with the single purpose to stop a detestable and\r\nwicked practice. Something of a dilettante in real life, he became in\r\nhis writing a man with an absorbing mission. That mission sprang not\r\nindeed from indignation at the St. Oses affair alone. From the days of\r\nchildhood his experience had been of a kind to encourage skepticism. He\r\nhad been reared in a county where Elizabeth Barton, the Holy Maid of\r\nKent, first came into prominence, and he had seen the downfall that\r\nfollowed her public exposure.[4] In the year after he brought out his\r\n_Hoppe-garden_, his county was again stirred by performances of a\r\nsupposedly supernatural character. Mildred Norrington, a girl of\r\nseventeen,[5] used ventriloquism with such skill that she convinced two\r\nclergymen and all her neighbors that she was possessed. In answer to\r\nqueries, the evil spirit that spoke through Mildred declared that \"old\r\nAlice of Westwell\"[6] had sent him to possess the girl. Alice, the\r\nspirit admitted, stood guilty of terrible witchcrafts. The demon's word\r\nwas taken, and Alice seems to have been \"arraigned upon this\r\nevidence.\"[7] But, through the justices' adroit management of the trial,\r\nthe fraud of the accuser was exposed. She confessed herself a pretender\r\nand suffered \"condign punishment.\" This case happened within six miles\r\nof Scot's home and opened his eyes to the possibility of humbug. In the\r\nvery same year two pretenders, Agnes Bridges and Rachel Pinder, were\r\nconvicted in London. By vomiting pins and straws[8] they had convinced\r\nmany that they were bewitched, but the trickery was soon found out and\r\nthey were compelled to do public penance at St. Paul's.[9] We are not\r\ntold what was the fate of a detestable Mother Baker, who, when consulted\r\nby the parents of a sick girl at New Romney in Kent, accused a neighbor\r\nwoman.[10] She said that the woman had made a waxen heart and pricked it\r\nand by this means accomplished her evil purpose. In order to prove her\r\naccusation, she had in the mean time concealed the wax figure of a heart\r\nin the house of the woman she accused, and then pretended to find\r\nit.[11] It is some satisfaction to know that the malicious\r\ncreature--who, during the history of witchcraft, had many imitators--was\r\ncaught and compelled to confess.\r\n\r\nScot learned, indeed, by observing marvels of this sort[12]--what it is\r\nstrange that many others did not learn--to look upon displays of the\r\nsupernatural with a good deal of doubt. How much he had ever believed in\r\nthem we do not know. It is not unlikely that in common with his\r\ngeneration he had, as a young man, held a somewhat ill-defined opinion\r\nabout the Devil's use of witches. The belief in that had come down, a\r\ncomparatively innocuous tradition, from a primitive period. It was a\r\nsubject that had not been raised in speculation or for that matter in\r\ncourt rooms. But since Scot's early manhood all this had been changed.\r\nEngland had been swept by a tidal wave of suspicion. Hazy theological\r\nnotions had been tightened into rigid convictions. Convictions had\r\npassed into legislative statutes and instructions to judges. The bench,\r\nwhich had at first acted on the new laws with caution and a desire to\r\ndetect imposture, became infected with the fear and grew more ready to\r\ndiscover witchcraft and to punish it. It is unnecessary to recapitulate\r\nthe progress of a movement already traced in the previous chapter.\r\nSuffice it to say that the Kentish gentleman, familiarized with accounts\r\nof imposture, was unwilling to follow the rising current of\r\nsuperstition. Of course this is merely another way of saying that Scot\r\nwas unconventional in his mental operations and thought the subject out\r\nfor himself with results variant from those of his own generation. Here\r\nwas a new abuse in England, here was a wrong that he had seen spring up\r\nwithin his own lifetime and in his own part of England. He made it his\r\nmission as far as possible to right the wrong. \"For so much,\" he says,\r\n\"as the mightie helpe themselves together, and the poore widowes crie,\r\nthough it reach to heaven, is scarse heard here upon earth: I thought\r\ngood (according to my poore abilitie) to make intercession, that some\r\npart of common rigor, and some points of hastie judgement may be advised\r\nupon.\"[13]\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a splendid mission and he was singularly well equipped for\r\nit. He had the qualifications--scholarly training and the power of\r\nscientific observation, a background of broad theological and scriptural\r\ninformation, a familiarity with legal learning and practice, as well as\r\na command of vigorous and incisive language--which were certain to make\r\nhis work effective towards its object.\r\n\r\nThat he was a scholar is true in more senses than one. In his use of\r\ndeduction from classical writers he was something of a scholastic, in\r\nhis willingness to venture into new fields of thought he was a product\r\nof the Renaissance, in his thorough use of research he reminds us of a\r\nmodern investigator. He gives in his book a bibliography of the works\r\nconsulted by him and one counts over two hundred Latin and thirty\r\nEnglish titles. His reading had covered the whole field of superstition.\r\nTo Cornelius Agrippa and to Wierus (Johann Weyer),[14] who had attacked\r\nthe tyranny of superstition upon the Continent, he owed an especial\r\ndebt. He had not, however, borrowed enough from them to impair in any\r\nserious way the value of his own original contribution.\r\n\r\nIn respect to law, Scot was less a student than a man of experience. The\r\n_Discoverie_, however, bristled with references which indicated a legal\r\nway of thinking. He was almost certainly a man who had used the law.\r\nBrinsley Nicholson believes that he had been a justice of the peace. In\r\nany case he had a lawyer's sense of the value of evidence and a lawyer's\r\nway of putting his case.\r\n\r\nNo less practical was his knowledge of theology and scripture. Here he\r\nhad to meet the baffling problems of the Witch of Endor. The story of\r\nthe witch who had called up before the frightened King Saul the spirit\r\nof the dead Samuel and made him speak, stood as a lion in the path of\r\nall opponents of witch persecution. When Scot dared to explain this Old\r\nTestament tale as an instance of ventriloquism, and to compare it to the\r\ncelebrated case of Mildred Norrington, he showed a boldness in\r\ninterpretation of the Bible far in advance of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nHis anticipation of present-day points of view cropped out perhaps more\r\nin his scientific spirit than in any other way. For years before he put\r\npen to paper he had been conducting investigations into alleged cases of\r\nconjuring and witchcraft, attending trials,[15] and questioning\r\nclergymen and magistrates. For such observation he was most favorably\r\nsituated and he used his position in his community to further his\r\nknowledge. A man almost impertinently curious was this sixteenth-century\r\nstudent. When he learned of a conjurer whose sentence of death had been\r\nremitted by the queen and who professed penitence for his crimes, he\r\nopened a correspondence and obtained from the man the clear statement\r\nthat his conjuries were all impostures. The prisoner referred him to \"a\r\nbooke written in the old Saxon toong by one Sir John Malborne, a divine\r\nof Oxenford, three hundred yeares past,\" in which all these trickeries\r\nare cleared up. Scot put forth his best efforts to procure the work from\r\nthe parson to whom it had been entrusted, but without success.[16] In\r\nanother case he attended the assizes at Rochester, where a woman was on\r\ntrial. One of her accusers was the vicar of the parish, who made several\r\ncharges, not the least of which was that he could not enunciate clearly\r\nin church owing to enchantment. This explanation Scot carried to her and\r\nshe was able to give him an explanation much less creditable to the\r\nclergyman of the ailment, an explanation which Scot found confirmed by\r\nan enquiry among the neighbors. To quiet such rumors in the community\r\nabout the nature of the illness the vicar had to procure from London a\r\nmedical certificate that it was a lung trouble.[17]\r\n\r\nCan we wonder that a student at such pains to discover the fact as to a\r\nwrong done should have used barbed words in the portrayal of injustice?\r\nStrong convictions spurred on his pen, already taught to shape vigorous\r\nand incisive sentences. Not a stylist, as measured by the highest\r\nElizabethan standards of charm and mellifluence, he possessed a\r\nclearness and directness which win the modern reader. By his methods of\r\nanalysis he displayed a quality of mind akin to and probably influenced\r\nby that of Calvin, while his intellectual attitude showed the stimulus\r\nof the Reformation.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed in his own restricted field a reformer. He was not only\r\nthe protagonist of a new cause, but a pioneer who had to cut through the\r\nunderbrush of opinion a pathway for speculation to follow. So far as\r\nEngland was concerned, Scot found no philosophy of the subject, no\r\nsystematic defences or assaults upon the loosely constructed theory of\r\ndemonic agency. It was for him to state in definite terms the beliefs he\r\nwas seeking to overthrow. The Roman church knew fairly well by this time\r\nwhat it meant by witchcraft, but English theologians and philosophers\r\nwould hardly have found common ground on any one tenet about the\r\nmatter.[18] Without exaggeration it may be asserted that Scot by his\r\nassault all along the front forced the enemy's advance and in some sense\r\ndictated his line of battle.\r\n\r\nThe assault was directed indeed against the centre of the opposing\r\nentrenchments, the belief in the continuance of miracles. Scot declared\r\nthat with Christ and his apostles the age of miracles had passed, an\r\nopinion which he supported by the authority of Calvin and of St.\r\nAugustine. What was counted the supernatural assumed two forms--the\r\nphenomena exhibited by those whom he classed under the wide term of\r\n\"couseners,\" and the phenomena said to be exhibited by the \"poor doting\r\nwomen\" known as witches. The tricks and deceits of the \"couseners\" he\r\nwas at great pains to explain. Not less than one-third of his work is\r\ngiven up to setting forth the methods of conjurers, card tricks,\r\nsleight-of-hand performances, illusions of magic, materializations of\r\nspirits, and the wonders of alchemy and astrology. In the range of his\r\ninformation about these subjects, the discoverer was encyclopedic. No\r\ncurrent form of dabbling with the supernatural was left unexposed.\r\n\r\nIn his attack upon the phenomena of witchcraft he had a different\r\nproblem. He had to deal with phenomena the so-called facts of which were\r\nnot susceptible of any material explanation. The theory of a Devil who\r\nhad intimate relations with human beings, who controlled them and sent\r\nthem out upon maleficent errands, was in its essence a theological\r\nconception and could not be absolutely disproved by scientific\r\nobservation. It was necessary instead to attack the idea on its _a\r\npriori_ grounds. This attack Scot attempted to base on the nature of\r\nspirits. Spirits and bodies, he urged, are antithetical and\r\ninconvertible, nor can any one save God give spirit a bodily form. The\r\nDevil, a something beyond our comprehension, cannot change spirit into\r\nbody, nor can he himself assume a bodily form, nor has he any power save\r\nthat granted him by God for vengeance. This being true, the whole\r\nbelief in the Devil's intercourse with witches is undermined. Such, very\r\nbriefly, were the philosophic bases of Scot's skepticism. Yet the more\r\ncogent parts of his work were those in which he denied the validity of\r\nany evidence so far offered for the existence of witches. What is\r\nwitchcraft? he asked; and his answer is worth quoting. \"Witchcraft is in\r\ntruth a cousening art, wherin the name of God is abused, prophaned and\r\nblasphemed, and his power attributed to a vile creature. In estimation\r\nof the vulgar people, it is a supernaturall worke, contrived betweene a\r\ncorporall old woman, and a spirituall divell. The maner thereof is so\r\nsecret, mysticall, and strange, that to this daie there hath never beene\r\nany credible witnes thereof.\"[19] The want of credible evidence was\r\nindeed a point upon which Scot continually insisted with great force. He\r\npictured vividly the course which a witchcraft case often ran: \"One sort\r\nof such as are said to bee witches are women which be commonly old,\r\nlame, bleare-eied, pale, fowle, and full of wrinkles; ... they are leane\r\nand deformed, shewing melancholie in their faces; ... they are doting,\r\nscolds, mad, divelish.... These miserable wretches are so odious unto\r\nall their neighbors, and so feared, as few dare offend them, or denie\r\nthem anie thing they aske: whereby they take upon them, yea, and\r\nsometimes thinke, that they can doo such things as are beyond the\r\nabilitie of humane nature. These go from house to house, and from doore\r\nto doore for a pot of milke, yest, drinke, pottage, or some such\r\nreleefe; without the which they could hardlie live.... It falleth out\r\nmany times, that neither their necessities, nor their expectation is\r\nanswered.... In tract of time the witch waxeth odious and tedious to hir\r\nneighbors; ... she cursseth one, and sometimes another; and that from\r\nthe maister of the house, his wife, children, cattell, etc. to the\r\nlittle pig that lieth in the stie.... Doubtlesse (at length) some of hir\r\nneighbours die, or fall sicke.\"[20] Then they suspect her, says Scot,\r\nand grow convinced that she is the author of their mishaps. \"The witch,\r\n... seeing things sometimes come to passe according to hir wishes, ...\r\nbeing called before a Justice, ... confesseth that she hath brought such\r\nthings to passe. Wherein, not onelie she, but the accuser, and also the\r\nJustice are fowlie deceived and abused.\"[21] Such indeed was the epitome\r\nof many cases. The process from beginning to end was never better\r\ndescribed; the ease with which confessions were dragged from\r\nweak-spirited women was never pictured more truly. With quite as keen\r\ninsight he displayed the motives that animated witnesses and described\r\nthe prejudices and fears that worked on jurors and judges. It was,\r\nindeed, upon these factors that he rested the weight of his argument for\r\nthe negative.[22]\r\n\r\nThe affirmative opinion was grounded, he believed, upon the ignorance of\r\nthe common people, \"assotted and bewitched\" by the jesting or serious\r\nwords of poets, by the inventions of \"lowd liers and couseners,\" and by\r\n\"tales they have heard from old doting women, or from their mother's\r\nmaids, and with whatsoever the grandfoole their ghostlie father or anie\r\nother morrow masse preest had informed them.\"[23]\r\n\r\nBy the same method by which he opposed the belief in witchcraft he\r\nopposed the belief in possession by an evil spirit. The known cases,\r\nwhen examined, proved frauds. The instances in the New Testament he\r\nseemed inclined to explain by the assumption that possession merely\r\nmeant disease.[24]\r\n\r\nThat Scot should maintain an absolute negative in the face of all\r\nstrange phenomena would have been too much to expect. He seems to have\r\nbelieved, though not without some difficulty, that stones had in them\r\n\"certaine proper vertues which are given them of a speciall influence of\r\nthe planets.\" The unicorn's horn, he thought, had certain curative\r\nproperties. And he had heard \"by credible report\" and the affirmation of\r\n\"many grave authors\" that \"the wound of a man murthered reneweth\r\nbleeding at the presence of a deere freend, or of a mortall enimie.\"[25]\r\n\r\nHis credulity in these points may be disappointing to the reader who\r\nhopes to find in Scot a scientific rationalist. That, of course, he was\r\nnot; and his leaning towards superstition on these points makes one ask,\r\nWhat did he really believe about witchcraft? When all the fraud and\r\nfalse testimony and self-deception were excluded, what about the\r\nremaining cases of witchcraft? Scot was very careful never to deny _in\r\ntoto_ the existence of witches. That would have been to deny the Bible.\r\nWhat were these witches, then? Doubtless he would have answered that he\r\nhad already classified them under two heads: they were either\r\n\"couseners\" or \"poor doting women\"--and by \"couseners\" he seems to have\r\nmeant those who used trickery and fraud. In other words, Scot distinctly\r\nimplied that there were no real witches--with powers given them by the\r\nDevil. Would he have stood by this when pushed into a corner? It is just\r\npossible that he would have done so, that he understood his own\r\nimplications, but hardly dared to utter a straighforward denial of the\r\nreality of witchcraft. It is more likely that he had not altogether\r\nthought himself out.\r\n\r\nThe immediate impression of Scot's book we know little about. Such\r\ncontemporary comment as we have is neutral.[26] That his book was read\r\npainstakingly by every later writer on the subject, that it shortly\r\nbecame the great support of one party in the controversy, that King\r\nJames deemed it worth while to write an answer, and that on his\r\naccession to the throne he almost certainly ordered the book to be\r\nburned by the common hangman,[27] these are better evidence than\r\nabsolutely contemporary notices to show that the _Discoverie_ exerted an\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nWe cannot better suggest how radical Scot's position must have seemed to\r\nhis own time than by showing the point of view of another opponent of\r\nwitchcraft, George Gifford, a non-conformist clergyman.[28] He had read\r\nthe _Discoverie_ and probably felt that the theological aspect of the\r\nsubject had been neglected. Moreover it had probably been his fortune,\r\nas Scot's, to attend the St. Oses trials. Three years after Scot's book\r\nhe brought out _A Discourse of the Subtill Practises of Devilles by\r\nWitches_, and followed it six years later by _A Dialogue concerning\r\nWitches_,[29] a book in which he expounded his opinions in somewhat more\r\npopular fashion. Like Scot, he wrote to end, so far as possible, the\r\npunishment of innocent women;[30] like Scot, he believed that most of\r\nthe evidence presented against them was worthless.[31] But on other\r\npoints he was far less radical. There were witches. He found them in\r\nthe Bible.[32] To be sure they were nothing more than pawns for the\r\nDevil. He uses them \"onely for a colour,\"[33] that is, puts them forward\r\nto cover his own dealings, and then he deludes them and makes them\r\n\"beleeve things which are nothing so.\"[34] In consequence they\r\nfrequently at their executions falsely accuse others of dreadful\r\nwitchcrafts. It is all the work of the Devil. But he himself cannot do\r\nanything except through the power of God,[35] who, sometimes for\r\nvengeance upon His enemies and sometimes to try His own people,[36]\r\npermits the Evil One to do harm.[37]\r\n\r\nGifford of course never made the impression that Scot had made.[38] But\r\nhe represented the more conservative position and was the first in a\r\nlong line of writers who deprecated persecution while they accepted the\r\ncurrent view as to witchcraft; and therefore he furnishes a standard by\r\nwhich to measure Scot, who had nothing of the conservative about him.\r\nScot had many readers and exerted a strong influence even upon those who\r\ndisagreed with him; but he had few or none to follow in his steps. It\r\nwas not until nearly a century later that there came upon the scene a\r\nman who dared to speak as Scot had spoken. Few men have been so far\r\nahead of their time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Where George Gifford, who wrote a little later on the subject, was\r\nalso a student.\r\n\r\n[2] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, Nicholson ed., introd., xxxv.\r\n\r\n[3] That at least a part of it was written in 1583 appears from his own\r\nwords, where he speaks of the treatise of Leonardus Vairus on\r\nfascination as \"now this present yeare 1583 newlie published,\" _ibid._,\r\n124.\r\n\r\n[4] Elizabeth Barton (1506-1534) suffered from a nervous derangement\r\nwhich developed into a religious mania. She was taught by some monks,\r\nand then professed to be in communion with the Virgin Mary and performed\r\nmiracles at stated times. She denounced Henry VIII's divorce and gained\r\nwide recognition as a champion of the queen and the Catholic church. She\r\nwas granted interviews by Archbishop Warham, by Thomas More, and by\r\nWolsey. She was finally induced by Cranmer to make confession, was\r\ncompelled publicly to repeat her confession in various places, and was\r\nthen executed; see _Dict. Nat. Biog._\r\n\r\n[5] Illegitimate child.\r\n\r\n[6] That is, very probably, Alice Norrington, the mother of Mildred.\r\n\r\n[7] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 130.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ibid._, 132.\r\n\r\n[9] See _The discloysing of a late counterfeyted possession by the devyl\r\nin two maydens within the Citie of London_; see also Holinshed,\r\n_Chronicles_, ed. of 1807-1808, IV, 325, and John Stow, _Annals ... of\r\nEngland_ (London, 1615), 678.\r\n\r\n[10] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 258, 259.\r\n\r\n[11] The spot she chose for concealing the token of guilt had been\r\npreviously searched.\r\n\r\n[12] For another see _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 132-133.\r\n\r\n[13] In his prefatory epistle \"to the Readers.\"\r\n\r\n[14] An incidental reference to Weyer in \"W. W.'s\" account of the\r\n_Witches taken at St. Oses_ is interesting: \"... whom a learned\r\nPhisitian is not ashamed to avouche innocent, and the Judges that\r\ndenounce sentence of death against them no better than hangmen.\"\r\n\r\n[15] _E. g., Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 5.\r\n\r\n[16] _Ibid._, 466-469.\r\n\r\n[17] _Ibid._, 5-6.\r\n\r\n[18] _Ibid._, 15: \"Howbeit you shall understand that few or none are\r\nthroughlie persuaded, resolved, or satisfied, that witches can indeed\r\naccomplish all these impossibilities; but some one is bewitched in one\r\npoint, and some is coosened in another, untill in fine, all these\r\nimpossibilities, and manie mo, are by severall persons affirmed to be\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\n[19] _Discoverie_, 472.\r\n\r\n[20] _Ibid._, 7-8.\r\n\r\n[21] _Ibid._, 8.\r\n\r\n[22] It was one of the points made by \"witchmongers\" that the existence\r\nof laws against witches proved there were witches. This argument was\r\nused by Sir Matthew Hale as late as 1664. Scot says on that point: \"Yet\r\nI confesse, the customes and lawes almost of all nations doo declare,\r\nthat all these miraculous works ... were attributed to the power of\r\nwitches. The which lawes, with the executions and judicials thereupon,\r\nand the witches confessions, have beguiled almost the whole world.\"\r\n_Ibid._, 220.\r\n\r\n[23] _Discoverie_, 471, 472.\r\n\r\n[24] _Ibid._, 512.\r\n\r\n[25] _Ibid._, 303.\r\n\r\n[26] Thomas Nash in his _Four Letters Confuted_ (London, 1593) refers to\r\nit in a non-committal way as a work treating of \"the diverse natures and\r\nproperties of Divels and Spirits.\" Gabriel Harvey's _Pierces\r\nSupererogation_ (London, 1593), has the following mention of it:\r\n\"Scottes discoovery of Witchcraft dismasketh sundry egregious\r\nimpostures, and in certaine principall chapters, and special passages,\r\nhitteth the nayle on the head with a witnesse; howsoever I could have\r\nwished he had either dealt somewhat more curteously with Monsieur\r\nBodine, or confuted him somewhat more effectually.\" Professor Burr\r\ninforms me that there is in the British Museum (Harleian MSS. 2302) an\r\nincomplete and unpublished reply to Scot. Its handwriting shows it\r\ncontemporary or nearly so. It is a series of \"Reasons\" why witches\r\nshould be believed in--the MS. in its present state beginning with the\r\n\"5th Reason\" and breaking off in the midst of the 108th.\r\n\r\n[27] See Nicholson's opinion on this, pp. xxxvii-xxxix of his\r\nintroduction to Scot's book.\r\n\r\n[28] George Gifford was a Church of England clergyman whose Puritan\r\nsympathies at length compelled him to identify himself publicly with the\r\nnon-conformist movement in 1584. For two years previous to that time he\r\nhad held the living of Maldon in Essex.\r\n\r\n[29] A second edition of this book appeared in 1603. It was reprinted\r\nfor the Percy Society in 1842.\r\n\r\n[30] _Dialogue_, ed. of 1603, prefatory letter and L-M 2 verso.\r\n\r\n[31] _Discourse_, D 3 verso, G 4 verso; _Dialogue_, ed. of 1603, K 2-K 2\r\nverso, L-L 2.

Hereupon some came to\r\ncharge to him, and did charge him in the name of the Father, the Sonne,\r\nand the Holy Ghost, to tell what he was. The dogge at the last told\r\nthem, for he spake in his language, and said, bowgh, and thereby they\r\ndid know what he was.\"\r\n\r\n[32] _Discourse_, in the prefatory letter.\r\n\r\n[33] _Ibid._, F 4 verso, F 5.\r\n\r\n[34] _Dialogue_, ed of 1603, K 2 verso.\r\n\r\n[35] _Ibid._, D 3 verso; _Discourse_, G 3 verso, H 3 verso.\r\n\r\n[36] _Ibid._, D 2 verso.\r\n\r\n[37] Gifford grew very forceful when he described the progress of a case\r\nagainst a witch: \"Some woman doth fal out bitterly with her neighbour:\r\nthere followeth some great hurt.... There is a suspicion conceived.\r\nWithin fewe yeares after shee is in some jarre with an other. Hee is\r\nalso plagued. This is noted of all. Great fame is spread of the matter.\r\nMother W. is a witch.... Wel, mother W. doth begin to bee very odious\r\nand terrible unto many, her neighbours dare say nothing but yet in their\r\nheartes they wish shee were hanged. Shortly after an other falleth sicke\r\nand doth pine.... The neighbors come to visit him. Well neighbour, sayth\r\none, do ye not suspect some naughty dealing: did yee never anger mother\r\nW? truly neighbour (sayth he) I have not liked the woman a long tyme. I\r\ncan not tell how I should displease her, unlesse it were this other day,\r\nmy wife prayed her, and so did I, that shee would keepe her hennes out\r\nof my garden. Wee spake her as fayre as wee could for our lives. I\r\nthinke verely she hath bewitched me. Every body sayth now that mother W.\r\nis a witch in deede.... It is out of all doubt: for there were which saw\r\na weasil runne from her housward into his yard even a little before hee\r\nfell sicke. The sicke man dieth, and taketh it upon his death that he is\r\nbewitched: then is mother W. apprehended, and sent to prison, shee is\r\narrayned and condemned, and being at the gallows, taketh it uppon her\r\ndeath that shee is not gylty.\" _Discourse_, G 4-G 4 verso. And so,\r\nGifford explains, the Devil is pleased, for he has put innocent people\r\ninto danger, he has caused witnesses to forswear themselves and jurymen\r\nto render false verdicts.\r\n\r\n[38] But his views were warmly seconded by Henry Holland, who in 1590\r\nissued at Cambridge _A Treatise against Witchcraft_. Holland, however,\r\nwas chiefly interested in warning \"Masters and Fathers of families that\r\nthey may learn the best meanes to purge their houses of all unclean\r\nspirits.\" It goes without saying that he found himself at variance with\r\nScot, who, he declared, reduced witchcraft to a \"cozening or poisoning\r\nart.\" In the Scriptures he found the evidence that witches have a real\r\n\"confederacie with Satan himself,\" but he was frank to admit that the\r\nproof of bargains of the sort in his own time could not be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXORCISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the narrative of English witchcraft the story of the exorcists is a\r\nside-issue. Yet their performances were so closely connected with the\r\noperations of the Devil and of his agents that they cannot be left out\r\nof account in any adequate statement of the subject. And it is\r\nimpossible to understand the strength and weakness of the superstition\r\nwithout a comprehension of the rôle that the would-be agents for\r\nexpelling evil spirits played. That the reign which had seen pass in\r\nprocession the bands of conjurers and witches should close with the\r\nexorcists was to be expected. It was their part to complete the cycle of\r\nsuperstition. If miracles of magic were possible, if conjurers could use\r\na supernatural power of some sort to assist them in performing wonders,\r\nthere was nothing very remarkable about creatures who wrought harm to\r\ntheir fellows through the agency of evil spirits. And if witches could\r\nsend evil spirits to do harm, it followed that those spirits could be\r\nexpelled or exorcised by divine assistance. If by prayer to the Devil\r\ndemons could be commanded to enter human beings, they could be driven\r\nout by prayer to God. The processes of reasoning were perfectly clear;\r\nand they were easily accepted because they found adequate confirmation\r\nin the New Testament. The gospels were full of narratives of men\r\npossessed with evil spirits who had been freed by the invocation of God.\r\nOf these stories no doubt the most quoted and the one most effective in\r\nmoulding opinion was the account of the dispossessed devils who had\r\nentered into a herd of swine and plunged over a steep place into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that exorcism was a result of belief in\r\nwitchcraft. It was as old as the Christian church. It was still made use\r\nof by the Roman church and, indeed, by certain Protestant groups. And\r\njust at this time the Roman church found it a most important instrument\r\nin the struggle against the reformed religions. In England Romanism was\r\nwaging a losing war, and had need of all the miracles that it could\r\nclaim in order to reestablish its waning credit. The hunted priests who\r\nwere being driven out by Whitgift were not unwilling to resort to a\r\npractice which they hoped would regain for them the allegiance of the\r\ncommon people. During the years 1585-1586 they had conducted what they\r\nconsidered marvellous works of exorcism in Catholic households of\r\nBuckinghamshire and Middlesex.[1] Great efforts had been made to keep\r\nnews of these séances from reaching the ears of the government, but\r\naccounts of them had gained wide circulation and came to the privy\r\ncouncil. That body was of course stimulated to greater activity against\r\nthe Catholics.[2]\r\n\r\nAs a phase of a suppressed form of religion the matter might never have\r\nassumed any significance. Had not a third-rate Puritan clergyman, John\r\nDarrel, almost by accident hit upon the use of exorcism, the story of\r\nits use would be hardly worth telling.[3] When this young minister was\r\nnot more than twenty, but already, as he says, reckoned \"a man of hope,\"\r\nhe was asked to cure a seventeen-year-old girl at Mansfield in\r\nNottingham, Katherine Wright.[4] Her disease called for simple medical\r\ntreatment. That was not Darrel's plan of operation. She had an evil\r\nspirit, he declared. From four o'clock in the morning until noon he\r\nprayed over her spirit. He either set going of his own initiative the\r\nopinion that possessed persons could point out witches, or he quickly\r\navailed himself of such a belief already existing. The evil spirit, he\r\ndeclared, could recognize and even name the witch that had sent it as\r\nwell as the witch's confederates. All of this was no doubt suggested to\r\nthe possessed girl and she was soon induced to name the witch that\r\ntroubled her. This was Margaret Roper, a woman with whom she was upon\r\nbad terms. Margaret Roper was at once taken into custody by the\r\nconstable. She happened to be brought before a justice of the peace\r\npossessing more than usual discrimination. He not only discharged\r\nher,[5] but threatened John Darrel with arrest.[6]\r\n\r\nThis was in 1586. Darrel disappeared from view for ten years or so,\r\nwhen he turned up at Burton-upon-Trent, not very far from the scene of\r\nhis first operations. Here he volunteered to cure Thomas Darling. The\r\nstory is a curious one and too long for repetition. Some facts must,\r\nhowever, be presented in order to bring the story up to the point at\r\nwhich Darrel intervened. Thomas Darling, a young Derbyshire boy, had\r\nbecome ill after returning from a hunt. He was afflicted with\r\ninnumerable fits, in which he saw green angels and a green cat. His aunt\r\nvery properly consulted a physician, who at the second consultation\r\nthought it possible that the child was bewitched. The aunt failed to\r\ncredit the diagnosis. The boy's fits continued and soon took on a\r\nreligious character. Between seizures he conversed with godly people.\r\nThey soon discovered that the reading of the Scriptures brought on\r\nattacks. This looked very like the Devil's work. The suggestion of the\r\nphysician was more seriously regarded. Meanwhile the boy had overheard\r\nthe discussion of witchcraft and proceeded to relate a story. He had\r\nmet, he said, a \"little old woman\" in a \"gray gown with a black fringe\r\nabout the cape, a broad thrimmed hat, and three warts on her face.\"[7]\r\nVery accidentally, as he claimed, he offended her. She angrily said a\r\nrhyming charm that ended with the words, \"I wil goe to heaven, and thou\r\nshalt goe to hell,\" and stooped to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe story produced a sensation. Those who heard it declared at once that\r\nthe woman must have been Elizabeth Wright, or her daughter Alse\r\nGooderidge, women long suspected of witchcraft. Alse was fetched to the\r\nboy. She said she had never seen him, but her presence increased the\r\nviolence of his fits. Mother and daughter were carried before two\r\njustices of the peace, who examined them together with Alse's husband\r\nand daughter. The women were searched for special marks in the usual\r\nrevolting manner with the usual outcome, but only Alse herself was sent\r\nto gaol.[8]\r\n\r\nThe boy grew no better. It was discovered that the reading of certain\r\nverses in the first chapter of John invariably set him off.[9] The\r\njustices of the peace put Alse through several examinations, but with\r\nlittle result. Two good witches were consulted, but refused to help\r\nunless the family of the bewitched came to see them.\r\n\r\nMeantime a cunning man appeared who promised to prove Alse a witch. In\r\nthe presence of \"manie worshipfull personages\" \"he put a paire of new\r\nshooes on her feete, setting her close to the fire till the shooes being\r\nextreame hot might constrayne her through increase of the paine to\r\nconfesse.\" \"This,\" says the writer, \"was his ridiculous practice.\" The\r\nwoman \"being throghly heated desired a release\" and offered to confess,\r\nbut, as soon as her feet were cooled, refused. No doubt the justices of\r\nthe peace would have repudiated the statement that the illegal process\r\nof torture was used. The methods of the cunning man were really nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe woman was harried day and night by neighbors to bring her to\r\nconfess.[10] At length she gave way and, in a series of reluctant\r\nconfessions, told a crude story of her wrong-doings that bore some\r\nslight resemblance to the boy's tale, and involved the use of a spirit\r\nin the form of a dog.\r\n\r\nNow it was that John Darrel came upon the ground eager to make a name\r\nfor himself. Darling had been ill for three months and was not\r\nimproving. Even yet some of the boy's relatives and friends doubted if\r\nhe were possessed. Not so Darrel. He at once undertook to pray and fast\r\nfor the boy. According to his own account his efforts were singularly\r\nblessed. At all events the boy gradually improved and Darrel claimed the\r\ncredit. As for Alse Gooderidge, she was tried at the assizes, convicted\r\nby the jury, and sentenced by Lord Chief-Justice Anderson to\r\nimprisonment. She died soon after.[11] This affair undoubtedly widened\r\nDarrel's reputation.\r\n\r\nNot long after, a notable case of possession in Lancashire afforded him\r\na new opportunity to attract notice. The case of Nicholas Starchie's\r\nchildren provoked so much comment at the time that it is perhaps worth\r\nwhile to go back and bring the narrative up to the point where Darrel\r\nentered.[12] Two of Starchie's children had one day been taken ill most\r\nmysteriously, the girl \"with a dumpish and heavie countenance, and with\r\na certaine fearefull starting and pulling together of her body.\" The boy\r\nwas \"compelled to shout\" on the way to school. Both grew steadily\r\nworse[13] and the father consulted Edmund Hartley, a noted conjurer of\r\nhis time. Hartley quieted the children by the use of charms. When he\r\nrealized that his services would be indispensable to the father he made\r\na pretence of leaving and so forced a promise from Starchie to pay him\r\n40 shillings a year. This ruse was so successful that he raised his\r\ndemands. He asked for a house and lot, but was refused. The children\r\nfell ill again. The perplexed parent now went to a physician of\r\nManchester. But the physician \"sawe no signe of sicknes.\" Dr. Dee, the\r\nfamous astrologer and friend of Elizabeth, was summoned. He advised the\r\nhelp of \"godlie preachers.\"[14]\r\n\r\nMeantime the situation in the afflicted family took a more serious turn.\r\nBesides Mr. Starchie's children, three young wards of his, a servant,\r\nand a visitor, were all taken with the mysterious illness. The modern\r\nreader might suspect that some contagious disease had gripped the\r\nfamily, but the irregular and intermittent character of the disease\r\nprecludes that hypothesis. Darrel in his own pamphlet on the matter\r\ndeclares that when the parents on one occasion went to a play the\r\nchildren were quiet, but that when they were engaged in godly exercise\r\nthey were tormented, a statement that raises a suspicion that the\r\ndisease, like that of the Throckmorton children, was largely imaginary.\r\n\r\nBut the divines were at work. They had questioned the conjurer, and had\r\nfound that he fumbled \"verie ill favouredlie\" in the repetition of the\r\nLord's Prayer. He was haled before a justice of the peace, who began\r\ngathering evidence against him and turned him over to the assizes. There\r\nit came out that he had been wont to kiss the Starchie children, and had\r\neven attempted, although without success, to kiss a maid servant. In\r\nthis way he had presumably communicated the evil spirit--a new notion.\r\nThe court could find no law, however, upon which to hang him. He had\r\nbewitched the children, but he had bewitched none of them to death, and\r\ntherefore had not incurred the death penalty. But the father leaped into\r\nthe gap. He remembered that he had seen the conjurer draw a magic circle\r\nand divide it into four parts and that he had bidden the witness step\r\ninto the quarters one after another. Making such circles was definitely\r\nmentioned in the law as felony. Hartley denied the charge, but to no\r\npurpose. He was convicted of felony[15]--so far as we can judge, on this\r\nunsupported afterthought of a single witness--and was hanged. Sympathy,\r\nhowever, would be inappropriate. In the whole history of witchcraft\r\nthere were few victims who came so near to deserving their fate.\r\n\r\nThis was the story up to the time of Darrel's arrival. With Darrel came\r\nhis assistant, George More, pastor of a church in Derbyshire. The two at\r\nonce recognized the supernatural character of the case they were to\r\ntreat and began religious services for the stricken family. It was to no\r\neffect. \"All or most of them joined together in a strange and\r\nsupernatural loud whupping that the house and grounde did sounde\r\ntherwith again.\"\r\n\r\nBut the exorcists were not by any means disheartened. On the following\r\nday, in company with another minister, they renewed the services and\r\nwere able to expel six of the seven spirits. On the third day they\r\nstormed and took the last citadel of Satan. Unhappily the capture was\r\nnot permanent. Darrel tells us himself that the woman later became a\r\nPapist[16] and the evil spirit returned.\r\n\r\nThe exorcist now turned his skill upon a young apprenticed musician of\r\nNottingham. According to Darrel's story of the affair,[17] William\r\nSomers had nine years before met an old woman who had threatened him.\r\nAgain, more than a year before Darrel came to Nottingham, Somers had had\r\ntwo encounters with a strange woman \"at a deep cole-pit, hard by the\r\nway-side.\" Soon afterwards he \"did use such strang and idle kinde of\r\ngestures in laughing, dancing and such like lighte behaviour, that he\r\nwas suspected to be madd.\" He began to suffer from bodily distortions\r\nand to evince other signs of possession which created no little\r\nexcitement in Nottingham.\r\n\r\nDarrel had been sent for by this time. He came at once and with his\r\nusual precipitancy pronounced the case one of possession. Somers, he\r\nsaid, was suffering for the sins of Nottingham.[18] It was time that\r\nsomething should be done. Prayer and fasting were instituted. For three\r\ndays the youth was preached to and prayed over, while the people of\r\nNottingham, or some of them at least, joined in the fast. On the third\r\nday came what was deemed a most remarkable exhibition. The preacher\r\nnamed slowly, one after another, fourteen signs of possession. As he\r\nnamed them Somers illustrated in turn each form of possession.[19] Here\r\nwas confirmatory evidence of a high order. The exorcist had outdone\r\nhimself. He now held out promises of deliverance for the subject. For a\r\nquarter of an hour the boy lay as if dead, and then rose up quite well.\r\n\r\nDarrel now took up again the witchfinder's rôle he had once before\r\nassumed. Somers was encouraged to name the contrivers of his\r\nbewitchment. Through him, Darrel is said to have boasted, they would\r\nexpose all the witches in England.[20] They made a most excellent start\r\nat it. Thirteen women were accused by the boy,[21] who would fall into\r\nfits at the sight of a witch, and a general invitation was extended to\r\nprefer charges. But the community was becoming a bit incredulous and\r\nfailed to respond. All but two of the accused women were released.\r\n\r\nThe witch-discoverer, who in the meantime had been chosen preacher at\r\nSt. Mary's in Nottingham, made two serious mistakes. He allowed\r\naccusations to be preferred against Alice Freeman, sister of an\r\nalderman,[22] and he let Somers be taken out of his hands. By the\r\ncontrivance of some citizens who doubted the possession, Somers was\r\nplaced in the house of correction, on a trumped-up charge that he had\r\nbewitched a Mr. Sterland to death.[23] Removed from the clergyman's\r\ninfluence, he made confession that his possessions were pretended.[24]\r\nDarrel, he declared, had taught him how to pretend. The matter had now\r\ngained wide notoriety and was taken up by the Anglican church. The\r\narchdeacon of Derby reported the affair to his superiors, and the\r\nArchbishop of York appointed a commission to examine into the case.[25]\r\nWhether from alarm or because he had anew come under Darrel's influence,\r\nSomers refused to confess before the commission and again acted out his\r\nfits with such success that the commission seems to have been convinced\r\nof the reality of his possession.[26] This was a notable victory for the\r\nexorcist.\r\n\r\nBut Chief-Justice Anderson of the court of common pleas was now\r\ncommencing the assizes at Nottingham and was sitting in judgment on the\r\ncase of Alice Freeman. Anderson was a man of intense convictions. He\r\nbelieved in the reality of witchcraft and had earlier sent at least one\r\nwitch to the gallows[27] and one to prison.[28] But he was a man who\r\nhated Puritanism with all his heart, and would at once have suspected\r\nPuritan exorcism. Whether because the arch-instigator against Alice\r\nFreeman was a Puritan, or because the evidence adduced against her was\r\nflimsy, or because Somers, again summoned to court, acknowledged his\r\nfraud,[29] or for all these reasons, Anderson not only dismissed the\r\ncase,[30] but he wrote a letter about it to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. Archbishop Whitgift called Darrel and More before the court\r\nof high commission, where the Bishop of London, two of the Lord\r\nChief-Justices, the master of requests, and other eminent officials\r\nheard the case. It seems fairly certain that Bancroft, the Bishop of\r\nLondon, really took control of this examination and that he acted quite\r\nas much the part of a prosecutor as that of a judge. One of Darrel's\r\nfriends complained bitterly that the exorcist was not allowed to make\r\n\"his particular defences\" but \"was still from time to time cut off by\r\nthe Lord Bishop of London.\"[31] No doubt the bishop may have been\r\nsomewhat arbitrary. It was his privilege under the procedure of the\r\nhigh commission court, and he was dealing with one whom he deemed a very\r\nevident impostor. In fine, a verdict was rendered against the two\r\nclergymen. They were deposed from the ministry and put in close\r\nprison.[32] So great was the stir they had caused that in 1599 Samuel\r\nHarsnett, chaplain to the Bishop of London, published _A Discovery of\r\nthe Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel_, a careful résumé of the entire\r\ncase, with a complete exposure of Darrel's trickery. In this account the\r\ntestimony of Somers was given as to the origin of his possession. He\r\ntestified before the ecclesiastical court that he had known Darrel\r\nseveral years before they had met at Nottingham. At their first meeting\r\nhe promised, declared Somers, \"to tell me some thinges, wherein if I\r\nwould be ruled by him, I should not be driven to goe so barely as I\r\ndid.\" Darrel related to Somers the story of Katherine Wright and her\r\npossession, and remarked, \"If thou wilt sweare unto me to keepe my\r\ncounsell, I will teache thee to doe all those trickes which Katherine\r\nWright did, and many others that are more straunge.\" He then illustrated\r\nsome of the tricks for the benefit of his pupil and gave him a written\r\npaper of directions. From that time on there were meetings between the\r\ntwo at various places. The pupil, however, was not altogether successful\r\nwith his fits and was once turned out of service as a pretender. He was\r\nthen apprenticed to the musician already mentioned, and again met\r\nDarrel, who urged him to go and see Thomas Darling of Burton, \"because,\"\r\nsays Somers, \"that seeing him in his fittes, I might the better learn to\r\ndo them myselfe.\" Somers met Darrel again and went through with a\r\nseries of tricks of possession. It was after all these meetings and\r\npractice that Somers began his career as a possessed person in\r\nNottingham and was prayed over by Mr. Darrel. Such at least was his\r\nstory as told to the ecclesiastical commission. It would be hazardous to\r\nsay that the narrative was all true. Certainly it was accepted by\r\nHarsnett, who may be called the official reporter of the proceedings at\r\nDarrel's trial, as substantially true.[33]\r\n\r\nThe publication of the _Discovery_ by Harsnett proved indeed to be only\r\nthe beginning of a pamphlet controversy which Darrel and his supporters\r\nwere but too willing to take up.[34] Harsnett himself after his first\r\nonslaught did not re-enter the contest. The semi-official character of\r\nhis writing rendered it unnecessary to refute the statements of a\r\nconvicted man. At any rate, he was soon occupied with another production\r\nof similar aim. In 1602 Bishop Bancroft was busily collecting the\r\nmaterials, in the form of sworn statements, for the exposure of Catholic\r\npretenders. He turned the material over to his chaplain. Whether the\r\nseveral examinations of Roman exorcists and their subjects were the\r\nresult of a new interest in exposing exorcism on the part of the powers\r\nwhich had sent Darrel to prison, or whether they were merely a phase of\r\nincreased vigilance against the activity of the Roman priests, we cannot\r\nbe sure. The first conclusion does not seem improbable. Be that as it\r\nmay, the court of high commission got hold of evidence enough to\r\njustify the privy council in authorizing a full publication of the\r\ntestimony.[35] Harsnett was deputed to write the account of the Catholic\r\nexorcists which was brought out in 1603 under the title of _A\r\nDeclaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_. We have not the historical\r\nmaterials with which to verify the claims made in the book. On the face\r\nof it the case against the Roman priests looks bad. A mass of\r\nexaminations was printed which seem to show that the Jesuit Weston and\r\nhis confreres in England had been guilty of a great deal of jugglery and\r\npretence. The Jesuits, however, were wiser in their generation than the\r\nPuritans and had not made charges of witchcraft. For that reason their\r\nperformances may be passed over.\r\n\r\nNeither the pretences of the Catholics nor the refutation of them are\r\nvery important for our purposes. The exposure of John Darrel was of\r\nsignificance, because it involved the guilt or innocence of the women he\r\naccused as witches, as well as because the ecclesiastical authorities\r\ntook action against him and thereby levelled a blow directly at exorcism\r\nand possession[36] and indirectly at loose charges of witchcraft.\r\nHarsnett's books were the outcome of this affair and the ensuing\r\nexposures of the Catholics, and they were more significant than\r\nanything that had gone before. The Church of England had not committed\r\nitself very definitely on witchcraft, but its spokesman in the attack\r\nupon the Catholic pretenders took no uncertain ground. He was skeptical\r\nnot only about exorcism but about witchcraft as well. It is refreshing\r\nand inspiriting to read his hard-flung and pungent words. \"Out of\r\nthese,\" he wrote, \"is shaped us the true _Idea_ of a Witch, an old\r\nweather-beaten Croane, having her chinne and her knees meeting for age,\r\nwalking like a bow leaning on a shaft, hollow-eyed, untoothed, furrowed\r\non her face, having her lips trembling with the palsie, going mumbling\r\nin the streetes, one that hath forgotten her _pater noster_, and hath\r\nyet a shrewd tongue in her head, to call a drab, a drab. If shee have\r\nlearned of an olde wife in a chimnies end: _Pax, max, fax_, for a spel:\r\nor can say _Sir John of Grantams_ curse, for the Millers Eeles, that\r\nwere stolne: ... Why then ho, beware, looke about you my neighbours; if\r\nany of you have a sheepe sicke of the giddies, or an hogge of the\r\nmumps, or an horse of the staggers, or a knavish boy of the schoole, or\r\nan idle girle of the wheele, or a young drab of the sullens, and hath\r\nnot fat enough for her porredge, nor her father and mother butter enough\r\nfor their bread; and she have a little helpe of the _Mother_,\r\n_Epilepsie_, or _Cramp_, ... and then with-all old mother _Nobs_ hath\r\ncalled her by chaunce 'idle young huswife,' or bid the devil scratch\r\nher, then no doubt but mother _Nobs_ is the witch.... _Horace_ the\r\nHeathen spied long agoe, that a Witch, a Wizard, and a Conjurer were but\r\nbul-beggers to scare fooles.... And _Geoffry Chaucer_, who had his two\r\neyes, wit, and learning in his head, spying that all these brainlesse\r\nimaginations of witchings, possessings, house-hanting, and the rest,\r\nwere the forgeries, cosenages, Imposturs, and legerdemaine of craftie\r\npriests, ... writes in good plaine terms.\"[37]\r\n\r\nIt meant a good deal that Harsnett took such a stand. Scot had been a\r\nvoice crying in the wilderness. Harsnett was supported by the powers in\r\nchurch and state. He was, as has been seen, the chaplain of Bishop\r\nBancroft,[38] now--from 1604--to become Archbishop of Canterbury. He was\r\nhimself to become eminent in English history as master of Pembroke Hall\r\n(Cambridge), vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, Bishop of\r\nChichester, Bishop of Norwich, and Archbishop of York.[39] Whatever\r\nsupport he had at the time--and it is very clear that he had the backing\r\nof the English church on the question of exorcism--his later position\r\nand influence must have given great weight not only to his views on\r\nexorcism but to his skepticism about witchcraft.[40]\r\n\r\nHis opinions on the subject, so far as can be judged by his few direct\r\nstatements and by implications, were quite as radical as those of his\r\npredecessor.[41] As a matter of fact he was a man who read widely[42]\r\nand had pondered deeply on the superstition, but his thought had been\r\ncolored by Scot.[43] His assault, however, was less direct and studied\r\nthan that of his master. Scot was a man of uncommonly serious\r\ntemperament, a plain, blunt-spoken, church-going Englishman who covered\r\nthe whole ground of superstition without turning one phrase less serious\r\nthan another. His pupil, if so Harsnett may be called, wrote earnestly,\r\neven aggressively, but with a sarcastic and bitter humor that\r\nentertained the reader and was much less likely to convince. The curl\r\nnever left his lips. If at times a smile appeared, it was but an\r\naccented sneer. A writer with a feeling indeed for the delicate effects\r\nof word combination, if his humor had been less chilled by hate, if his\r\nwit had been of a lighter and more playful vein, he might have laughed\r\nsuperstition out of England. When he described the dreadful power of\r\nholy water and frankincense and the book of exorcisms \"to scald, broyle\r\nand sizzle the devil,\" or \"the dreadful power of the crosse and\r\nsacrament of the altar to torment the devill and to make him roare,\" or\r\n\"the astonishable power of nicknames, reliques and asses ears,\"[44] he\r\nrevealed a faculty of fun-making just short of effective humor.\r\n\r\nIt would not be fair to leave Harsnett without a word on his place as a\r\nwriter. In point of literary distinction his prose style maintains a\r\nhigh level. In the use of forceful epithet and vivid phrase he is\r\nexcelled by no Elizabethan prose writer. Because his writings deal so\r\nlargely with dry-as-dust reports of examinations, they have never\r\nattained to that position in English literature which parts of them\r\nmerit.[45]\r\n\r\nHarsnett's book was the last chapter in the story of Elizabethan\r\nwitchcraft and exorcism. It is hardly too much to say that it was the\r\nfirst chapter in the literary exploitation of witchcraft. Out of the\r\n_Declaration_ Shakespeare and Ben Jonson mined those ores which when\r\nfused and refined by imagination and fancy were shaped into the shining\r\nforms of art. Shakespearean scholars have pointed out the connection\r\nbetween the dramatist and the exposer of exorcism. It has indeed been\r\nsuggested by one student of Shakespeare that the great playwright was\r\nlending his aid by certain allusions in _Twelfth Night_ to Harsnett's\r\nattempts to pour ridicule on Puritan exorcism.[46] It would be hard to\r\nsay how much there is in this suggestion. About Ben Jonson we can speak\r\nmore certainly. It is clearly evident that he sneered at Darrel's\r\npretended possessions. In the third scene of the fifth act of _The Devil\r\nis an Ass_ he makes Mere-craft say:\r\n\r\n    It is the easiest thing, Sir, to be done.\r\n    As plaine as fizzling: roule but wi' your eyes,\r\n    And foame at th' mouth. A little castle-soape\r\n    Will do 't, to rub your lips: And then a nutshell,\r\n    With toe and touchwood in it to spit fire,\r\n    Did you ner'e read, Sir, little _Darrel's_ tricks,\r\n    With the boy o' _Burton_, and the 7 in _Lancashire_,\r\n    Sommers at _Nottingham_? All these do teach it.\r\n    And wee'l give out, Sir, that your wife ha's bewitch'd you.\r\n\r\nThis is proof enough, not only that Jonson was in sympathy with the\r\nAnglican assailants of Puritan exorcism, but that he expected to find\r\nothers of like opinion among those who listened to his play. And it was\r\nnot unreasonable that he should expect this. It is clear enough that the\r\npowers of the Anglican church were behind Harsnett and that their\r\ninfluence gave his views weight. We have already observed that there\r\nwere some evidences in the last part of Elizabeth's reign of a reaction\r\nagainst witch superstition. Harsnett's book, while directed primarily\r\nagainst exorcism, is nevertheless another proof of that reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Sir George Peckham of Denham near Uxbridge and Lord Vaux of Hackney\r\nwere two of the most prominent Catholics who opened their homes for\r\nthese performances. See Samuel Harsnett, _Declaration of Egregious\r\nPopish Impostures_ (London, 1603), 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[2] For a discussion of the Catholic exorcists see T. G. Law, \"Devil\r\nHunting in Elizabethan England,\" in the _Nineteenth Century_ for March,\r\n1894. Peckham's other activities in behalf of his church are discussed\r\nby Dr. R. B. Merriman in \"Some Notes on the Treatment of English\r\nCatholics in the Reign of Elizabeth,\" in the _Am. Hist. Rev._, April,\r\n1908. Dr. Merriman errs, however, in supposing that John Darrel\r\ncooperated with Weston and the Catholic exorcists; _ibid._, note 51.\r\nDarrel was a Puritan and had nothing to do with the Catholic\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\n[3] It is quite possible to suppose, however, that its course would have\r\nbeen run in much the same way at a later time.\r\n\r\n[4] For Harsnett's account of Katherine Wright see his _Discovery of the\r\nFraudulent Practises of John Darrel_ (London, 1599), 297-315. For\r\nDarrel's story see _The Triall of Maist. Dorrel, or A Collection of\r\nDefences against Allegations ..._ (1599), 15-21.\r\n\r\n[5] See Harsnett, _Discovery_, 310.\r\n\r\n[6] Katherine Wright's evil spirit returned later.\r\n\r\n[7] \"I have seene her begging at our doore,\" he declared, \"as for her\r\nname I know it not.\"\r\n\r\n[8] Harsnett, _Discovery_, 41, 265, deals briefly with the Darling case\r\nand Alse Gooderidge. See also John Darrel, _A Detection of that sinnful,\r\nshamful, lying, and ridiculous discours of Samuel Harshnet_ (1600),\r\n38-40. But the fullest account is a pamphlet at the Lambeth Palace\r\nlibrary. It is entitled _The most wonderfull and true Storie of a\r\ncertaine Witch named Alse Gooderidge of Stapenhill.... As also a true\r\nReport of the strange Torments of Thomas Darling...._ (London, 1597).\r\nFor a discussion of this pamphlet see appendix A, § 1.\r\n\r\n[9] The boy was visited by a stranger who tried to persuade him that\r\nthere were no witches. But this Derbyshire disciple of Scot had come to\r\nthe wrong place and his efforts were altogether useless.\r\n\r\n[10] Meantime her mother Elizabeth Wright was also being worried. She\r\nwas found on her knees in prayer. No doubt the poor woman was taking\r\nthis method of alleviating her distress; but her devotion was\r\ninterpreted as worship of the Devil.\r\n\r\n[11] So Darrel says. The pamphleteer Denison, who put together the story\r\nof Alse Gooderidge, wrote \"she should have been executed but that her\r\nspirit killed her in prison.\"\r\n\r\n[12] Darrel gives an extended account of this affair in _A True\r\nNarration of the strange and grevous Vexation by the Devil of seven\r\npersons in Lancashire_ (1600; reprinted in _Somers Tracts_, III),\r\n170-179. See also George More, _A true Discourse concerning the certaine\r\npossession and dispossession of 7 persons in one familie in Lancashire ..._\r\n(1600), 9 ff.\r\n\r\n[13] Certain matters in connection with this case are interesting.\r\nGeorge More tells us that Mrs. Starchie was an \"inheritrix.\" Some of her\r\nkindred, Papists, prayed for the perishing of her issue. Four of her\r\nchildren pined away. Mrs. Starchie, when told of their prayers, conveyed\r\nall her property to her husband. She had two children afterwards, the\r\ntwo that were stricken. It is possible that all this may present some\r\nkey to the case, but it is hard to see just how. See More, _A true\r\nDiscourse_, 11-12.\r\n\r\n[14] George More, _A true Discourse_, 15; Harsnett, _Discovery_, 22.\r\nWhile Dee took no part in the affair except that he \"sharply reproved\r\nand straitly examined\" Hartley, he lent Mr. Hopwood, the justice of the\r\npeace before whom Hartley was brought, his copy of the book of Wierus,\r\nthen the collections of exorcisms known as the _Flagellum Dæmonum_ and\r\nthe _Fustis Dæmonum_, and finally the famous _Malleus Maleficarum_. See\r\nDee's _Private Diary_ (Camden Soc., London, 1843), entries for March 19,\r\nApril 15, and August 6, 1597.\r\n\r\n[15] George More, _A true Discourse_, 21; Darrel, _A True Narration_\r\n(_Somers Tracts_, III), 175.\r\n\r\n[16] Harsnett, _Discovery_, tells us that \"certain Seminarie priests\"\r\ngot hold of her and carried her up and down the country and thereby\r\n\"wonne great credit.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Darrel's account of this affair is in _A True Narration_ (_Somers\r\nTracts_, III), 179-186. Harsnett takes it up in his _Discovery_, 78-264.\r\n\r\n[18] See deposition of Cooper, in Harsnett, _Discovery_, 114.\r\n\r\n[19] Depositions of Somers and Darrel, _ibid._, 124-125. It must be\r\nrecalled that when this was first tried before a commission they were\r\nconvinced that it was not imposture. A layman cannot refrain from\r\nsuspecting that Darrel had hypnotic control over Somers.\r\n\r\n[20] _Ibid._, 141-142.\r\n\r\n[21] _Ibid._, 141. Harsnett quotes Darrel for this statement.\r\n\r\n[22] _Ibid._, 5; John Darrel, _An Apologie, or defence of the possession\r\nof William Sommers ..._ (1599?), L verso.\r\n\r\n[23] Darrel, _A True Narration_ (_Somers Tracts_, III), 184; see also\r\nhis _A brief Apologie proving the possession of William Sommers ..._\r\n(1599), 17.\r\n\r\n[24] Harsnett, _Discovery_, 7.\r\n\r\n[25] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[26] _Ibid._, 8; Darrel, _An Apologie, or defence_, 4; Darrel, _A True\r\nNarration_ (_Somers Tracts_, III), 185.\r\n\r\n[27] _Triall of Maist.

And see above, p. 56, note.\r\n\r\n[29] Harsnett, _Discovery_, 8.\r\n\r\n[30] _Ibid._, 320-322; Darrel, _An Apologie, or defence_, L III, says\r\nthat the third jury acquitted her. Harsnett refers to the fact that he\r\nwas found guilty by the grand inquest.\r\n\r\n[31] _The Triall of Maist. Dorrel_, preface \"To the Reader.\"\r\n\r\n[32] Harsnett, _Discovery_, 9.\r\n\r\n[33] _Ibid._, 78-98.\r\n\r\n[34] Yet Darrel must have realized that he had the worst of it. There is\r\na pathetic acknowledgment of this in the \"Preface to the Reader\" of his\r\npublication, _A Survey of Certaine Dialogical Discourses, written by\r\nJohn Deacon and John Walker ..._ (1602): \"But like a tried and\r\nweather-beaten bird [I] wish for quiet corner to rest myself in and to\r\ndrye my feathers in the warme sun.\"\r\n\r\n[35] T. G. Law, \"Devil Hunting in Elizabethan England,\" in _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, March, 1894.\r\n\r\n[36] On the matter of exorcism the position of the Church of England\r\nbecame fixed by 1604. The question had been a cause of disagreement\r\namong the leaders of the Reformation. The Lutherans retained exorcism in\r\nthe baptismal ritual and rivalled the Roman clergy in their exorcism of\r\nthe possessed. It was just at the close of the sixteenth century that\r\nthere arose in Lutheran Germany a hot struggle between the believers in\r\nexorcism and those who would oust it as a superstition. The Swiss and\r\nGenevan reformers, unlike Luther, had discarded exorcism, declaring it\r\nto have belonged only to the early church, and charging modern instances\r\nto Papist fraud; and with them seem to have agreed their South German\r\nfriends. In England baptismal exorcism was at first retained in the\r\nritual under Edward VI, but in 1552, under Bucer's influence, it was\r\ndropped. Under Elizabeth the yet greater influence of Zurich and Geneva\r\nmust have discredited all exorcism, and one finds abundant evidence of\r\nthis in the writings of Jewel and his followers. An interesting letter\r\nof Archbishop Parker in 1574 shows his utter incredulity as to\r\npossession in the case of Agnes Bridges and Rachel Pinder of Lothbury;\r\nsee Parker's _Correspondence_ (Parker Soc., Cambridge, 1856), 465-466.\r\nHis successor, the Calvinistic Whitgift, was almost certainly of the\r\nsame mind. Bancroft, the next archbishop of Canterbury, drew up or at\r\nleast inspired that epoch-making body of canons enacted by Convocation\r\nin the spring of 1604, the 72d article of which forbids any Anglican\r\nclergyman, without the express consent of his bishop obtained\r\nbeforehand, to use exorcism in any fashion under any pretext, on pain of\r\nbeing counted an impostor and deposed from the ministry. This ended the\r\nmatter so far as the English church was concerned. For this résumé of\r\nthe Protestant and the Anglican attitude toward exorcism I am indebted\r\nto Professor Burr.\r\n\r\n[37] Harsnett, _A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_ (London,\r\n1605), 136-138.\r\n\r\n[38] It is not impossible that Harsnett was acting as a mouth-piece for\r\nBancroft. Darrel wrote: \"There is no doubt but that S. H. stand for\r\nSamuell Harsnet, chapline to the Bishop of London, but whither he alone,\r\nor his lord and hee, have discovered this counterfeyting and cosonage\r\nthere is the question. Some thinke the booke to be the Bishops owne\r\ndoing: and many thinke it to be the joynt worke of them both.\" _A\r\nDetection of that sinnful ... discours of Samuel Harshnet_, 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[39] From 1602 until 1609 he was archdeacon of Essex; see _Victoria\r\nHistory of Essex_, II, (London, 1907), 46.\r\n\r\n[40] There is a statement by the Reverend John Swan, who wrote in 1603,\r\nthat Harsnett's book had been put into the hands of King James,\r\npresumably after his coming to England; see John Swan, _A True and\r\nBreife Report of Mary Glover's Vexation, and of her deliverance ..._\r\n(1603), \"Dedication to the King,\" 3. One could wish for some\r\nconfirmation of this statement. Certainly James would not at that time\r\nhave sympathized with Harsnett's views about witches, but his attitude\r\non several occasions toward those supposed to be possessed by evil\r\nspirits would indicate that he may very well have been influenced by a\r\nreading of the _Discovery_.\r\n\r\n[41] On page 36 of the _Discovery_ Harsnett wrote: \"Whether witches can\r\nsend devils into men and women (as many doe pretende) is a question\r\namongst those that write of such matters, and the learneder and sounder\r\nsort doe hold the negative.\" One does not need to read far in Harsnett\r\nto understand what he thought.\r\n\r\n[42] His scholarship, evident from his books, is attested by Thomas\r\nFuller, who calls him \"a man of great learning, strong parts, and stout\r\nspirit\" (_Worthies of England_, ed. of London, 1840, I, 507).\r\n\r\n[43] See his _Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_, 134-136; his\r\n_Discovery_ also shows the use of Scot.\r\n\r\n[44] Harsnett, _Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_, 98, 123,\r\n110.\r\n\r\n[45] Read _ibid._, 131-140.\r\n\r\n[46] Joseph Hunter, _New Illustrations of the Life, Studies and Writings\r\nof Shakespeare_ (London, 1845), I, 380-390.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nJAMES I AND WITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome one has remarked that witchcraft came into England with the Stuarts\r\nand went out with them. This offhand way of fixing the rise and fall of\r\na movement has just enough truth about it to cause misconception.\r\nNothing is easier than to glance at the alarms of Elizabeth's reign and\r\nto see in them accidental outbreaks with little meaning, isolated\r\naffairs presaging a new movement rather than part of it. As a matter of\r\nfact, any such view is superficial. In previous chapters the writer has\r\nendeavored to show just how foreign ideas and conditions at home gave\r\nthe impulse to a movement which within a single reign took very definite\r\nform.\r\n\r\nYet so much was the movement accelerated, such additional impetus was\r\ngiven it by James I, that the view that James set the superstition going\r\nin England, however superficial, has some truth in it. If Elizabeth had\r\never given the matter thought, she had not at least given it many words.\r\nJames had very definite opinions on the subject and hesitated not at all\r\nto make them known. His views had weight. It is useless to deny that the\r\nroyal position swayed the courts. James's part in the witch persecution\r\ncannot be condoned, save on the ground that he was perfectly honest. He\r\nfelt deeply on the matter. It was little wonder. He had grown up in\r\nScotland in the very midst of the witch alarms. His own life, he\r\nbelieved, had been imperilled by the machinations of witches. He\r\nbelieved he had every reason to fear and hate the creatures, and we can\r\nonly wonder that he was so moderate as we shall later find him to have\r\nbeen. The story of the affair that stirred up the Scottish king and his\r\npeople has often been told, but it must be included here to make his\r\nattitude explicable. In 1589 he had arranged for a marriage with the\r\nPrincess Anne of Denmark. The marriage had been performed by proxy in\r\nJuly, and it was then provided that the princess was to come to England.\r\nShe set out, but was driven on to the coast of Norway by a violent\r\nstorm, and detained there by the continuance of the storms. James sailed\r\nto Upsala, and, after a winter in the north of the Continent, brought\r\nhis bride to Scotland in the spring, not without encountering more rough\r\nweather. To the people of the time it was quite clear that the ocean was\r\nunfriendly to James's alliance. Had Scotland been ancient Greece, no\r\ndoubt Neptune would have been propitiated by a sacrifice. But it was\r\nScotland, and the ever-to-be-feared Satan was not so easily propitiated.\r\nHe had been very active of late in the realm.\r\n\r\nMoreover it was a time when Satanic and other conspiracies were likely\r\nto come to light. The kingdom was unsettled, if not discontented. There\r\nwere plots, and rumors of plots. The effort to expose them, as well as\r\nto thwart the attacks of the evil one on the king, led to the conception\r\nand spread of the monstrous story of the conspiracy of Dr. Fian. Dr.\r\nFian was nothing less than a Scottish Dr. Faustus. He was a schoolmaster\r\nby profession. After a dissolute youth he was said to have given soul to\r\nthe Devil. According to the story he gathered around him a motley crowd,\r\nCatholic women of rank, \"wise women,\" and humble peasant people; but it\r\nwas a crew ready for evil enterprise. It is not very clear why they were\r\nsupposed to have attacked the king; perhaps because of his well known\r\npiety, perhaps because he was a Protestant. In any case they set about,\r\nas the story went, to destroy him, and thought to have found their\r\nopportunity in his trip to Denmark. They would drown him in a storm at\r\nsea. There was a simple expedient for raising a storm, the throwing of\r\ncats into the sea. This Scottish method of sacrificing to Neptune was\r\nduly carried out, and, as we have seen, just fell short of destroying\r\nthe king. It was only the piety of the king, as Dr. Fian admitted in his\r\nconfession, that overmatched the power of the evil one.[1]\r\n\r\nSuch is the story that stirred Scotland from end to end. It is a story\r\nthat is easily explained. The confessions were wrung from the supposed\r\nconspirators by the various forms of torture \"lately provided for\r\nwitches in that country.\" Geillis Duncane had been tried with \"the\r\ntorture of the pilliwinkes upon her fingers, which is a grievous\r\ntorture, and binding or wrinching her head with a cord or roape.\" Agnes\r\nSampson had suffered terrible tortures and shameful indignities until\r\nher womanly modesty could no longer endure it and she confessed\r\n\"whatsoever was demanded of her.\" Dr. Fian was put through the ordinary\r\nforms of torture and was then \"put to the most severe and cruel pain in\r\nthe world, called the bootes,\" and thereby was at length induced to\r\nbreak his silence and to incriminate himself. At another time, when the\r\nking, who examined him in person, saw that the man was stubborn and\r\ndenied the confessions already made, he ordered him to be tortured\r\nagain. His finger nails were pulled off with a pair of pincers, and\r\nunder what was left of them needles were inserted \"up to the heads.\"\r\nThis was followed by other tortures too terrible to narrate.[2]\r\n\r\nIt is a little hard to understand how it was that the king \"took great\r\ndelight to be present at the examinations,\" but throughout the whole\r\nwretched series of trials he was never wanting in zeal. When Barbara\r\nNapier, sister-in-law to the laird of Carshoggil, was to be executed, a\r\npostponement had been granted on account of her approaching\r\naccouchement. Afterwards, \"nobody insisting in the pursute of her, she\r\nwas set at libertie.\" It seems also that the jury that had before\r\ncondemned her had acquitted her of the main charge, that of treasonable\r\nwitchcraft against the king. The king was angered at the default of\r\njustice, went to the Tolbooth, and made an address on the subject. He\r\nspoke of \"his own impartiality, the use of witchcraft, the enormity of\r\nthe crime, ... the ignorance of thinking such matters mere fantasies,\r\nthe cause of his own interference in the matter, the ignorance of the\r\nassizes in the late trial, his own opinion of what witches really\r\nare.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIt was only a few years later that James put that opinion into written\r\nform. All the world knows that the king was a serious student. With\r\nunremitting zeal he studied this matter, and in 1597, seven years after\r\nthe Dr. Fian affair, he published his _Dæmonologie_.[4] It was expressly\r\ndesigned to controvert the \"damnable opinions of two principally in our\r\nage\"--Scot, who \"is not ashamed in publick Print to deny that there can\r\nbe such a thing as witchcraft,\" and Wierus, \"a German physician,\" who\r\n\"sets out a publicke apologie for all these craft-folkes whereby ... he\r\nplainly bewrayes himself to have been one of that profession.\"\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that James would be an exponent of the current\r\nsystem of belief. He had read diligently, if not widely, in the\r\nContinental lore of the subject and had assimilated much of it. He was\r\nScotch enough to be interested in theology and Stuart enough to have\r\nvery definite opinions. James had, too, his own way of putting things.\r\nThere was a certain freshness about his treatment, in spite of the fact\r\nthat he was ploughing old fields. Nothing illustrates better his\r\ncombination of adherence to tradition, of credulity, and of originality\r\nthan his views on the transportation of witches, a subject that had long\r\nengaged the theorists in demonology. Witches could be transported, he\r\nbelieved, by natural means, or they could be carried through the air \"by\r\nthe force of the spirit which is their conducter,\" as Habakkuk was\r\ncarried by the angel.[5] This much he could accept. But that they could\r\nbe transformed into a \"little beast or foule\" and pierce through\r\n\"whatsoever house or Church, though all ordinarie passages be closed,\"\r\nthis he refused to believe. So far, however, there was nothing original\r\nabout either his belief or his disbelief. But his suggestion on another\r\nmatter was very probably his own. There had been long discussion as to\r\nhow far through the air witches could go. It was James's opinion that\r\nthey could go only so far as they could retain their breath.\r\n\r\nBut it was seldom that the royal demonologist wandered far from the\r\nbeaten road. He was a conformist and he felt that the orthodox case\r\nneeded defence: so he set about to answer the objectors. To the argument\r\nthat it was a strange thing that witches were melancholy and solitary\r\nwomen (and so, he would have explained, offer the easiest object of\r\nattack) he interposed a flat denial: they are \"some of them rich and\r\nworldly-wise, some of them fat or corpulent in their bodies.\" To the\r\npoint that if witches had the power ascribed to them no one but\r\nthemselves would be left alive in the world, he answered that such would\r\nbe the case, were not the power of the Devil bridled by God. To the plea\r\nthat God would not allow his children to be vexed by the Devil, he\r\nreplied that God permits the godly who are sleeping in sin to be\r\ntroubled; that He even allows the Evil One to vex the righteous for his\r\nown good--a conventional argument that has done service in many a\r\ntheological controversy.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious circumstance that James seemingly recognized the\r\nreliability of the Romish exorcisms which the Church of England was\r\nabout that time beginning to attack. His explanation of them is worthy\r\nof \"the wisest fool in Christendom.\" The Papists could often effect\r\ncures of the possessed, he thought, because \"the divell is content to\r\nrelease the bodily hurting of them, ... thereby to obtain the perpetual\r\nhurt of the soules.\"\r\n\r\nThat James should indulge in religious disquisitions rather than in\r\npoints of evidence was to be expected. Although he had given up the\r\nScottish theology, he never succeeded in getting it thoroughly out of\r\nhis system. As to the evidence against the accused, the royal writer was\r\nbrief. Two sorts of evidence he thought of value, one \"the finding of\r\ntheir marke, and the trying the insensiblenes thereof, the other is\r\ntheir fleeting [floating] on the water.\" The latter sign was based, he\r\nsaid, on the fact that the water refuses to receive a witch--that is to\r\nsay, the pure element would refuse to receive those who had renounced\r\ntheir baptism.[6] We shall see that the influence of the _Dæmonologie_\r\ncan be fairly appraised by measuring the increased use of these two\r\ntests of guilt within his own reign and that of his son. Hitherto the\r\nevidence of the mark had been of rather less importance, while the\r\nordeal by water was not in use.\r\n\r\nThe alleged witch-mark on the body had to do with the contracts between\r\nwitches and the Devil. This loathsome side of witch belief we cannot go\r\ninto. Suffice it to say that James insisted on the reality of these\r\ncontracts and consequently upon the punishment that should be meted to\r\nthose who had entered into them. All witches except children should be\r\nsentenced to death. The king shows a trace of conventional moderation,\r\nhowever, and admits that the magistrates should be careful whom they\r\ncondemned. But, while he holds that the innocent should not be\r\ncondemned, he warns officials against the sin of failing to convict the\r\nguilty.[7] We shall see that throughout his reign in England he pursued\r\na course perfectly consistent with these principles.\r\n\r\nA critical estimate of James's book it is somewhat hard to give.\r\nStudents of witchcraft have given utterance to the most extravagant but\r\nwidely divergent opinions upon it. The writer confesses that he has not\r\nthat acquaintance with the witch literature of the Continent which would\r\nenable him to appraise the _Dæmonologie_ as to its originality. So good\r\nan authority as Thomas Wright has declared that it is \"much inferior to\r\nthe other treatises on the subject,\" and that it was compiled from\r\nforeign works.[8] Doubtless a study of the Continental literature would\r\nwarrant, at least in part, this opinion. Yet one gets the impression,\r\nfrom what may be learned of that great body of writing through the\r\nhistorians of witchcraft, that James's opinions were in some respects\r\nhis own. He had, of course, absorbed the current belief, but he did not\r\nhesitate to give his own interpretation and explanation of phenomena.\r\nThat interpretation is not wanting in shrewdness. It seems to one who\r\nhas wandered through many tedious defences of the belief in witchcraft\r\nthat James's work is as able as any in English prior to the time of\r\nJoseph Glanvill in 1668. One who should read Glanvill and James together\r\nwould get a very satisfactory understanding of the position of the\r\ndefenders of the superstition. Glanvill insisted upon what he believed\r\nwere well authenticated facts of experience. James grounded his belief\r\nupon a course of theoretical reasoning.\r\n\r\nWe have already indicated that James's book was influential in its time.\r\nIt goes without saying that his position as a sovereign greatly enhanced\r\nits influence. This was particularly true after he took the throne of\r\nEngland. The dicta that emanated from the executive of the English\r\nnation could not fail to find a wide audience, and especially in England\r\nitself. His work offered a text-book to officials. It was a key to the\r\ncharacter and methods of the new ruler, and those who hoped for\r\npromotion were quick to avail themselves of it. To prosecute witches was\r\nto win the sovereign's approval. The judges were prompted to greater\r\nactivity. Moreover, the sanction of royalty gave to popular outbreaks\r\nagainst suspicious women greater consideration at the hands of the\r\ngentry. And it was in the last analysis the gentry, in the persons of\r\nthe justices of the peace, who decided whether or no neighborhood\r\nwhispering and rumors should be followed up.\r\n\r\nBut the king's most direct influence was in the passing of a new law.\r\nHis first Parliament had been in session but eight days when steps were\r\ntaken by the House of Lords towards strengthening the statute against\r\nwitchcraft. The law in force, passed in the fifth year of Elizabeth's\r\nreign, imposed the death penalty for killing by witchcraft, and a year's\r\nimprisonment for injuring by witchcraft or by allied means. James would\r\nnaturally feel that this law was merely one version of the statute\r\nagainst murder and did not touch the horrible crime of contract with the\r\nDevil and the keeping of imps.[9] Here was a sin beside which the taking\r\nof life was a light offence. It was needful that those who were guilty\r\nof it should suffer the severest penalty of the law, even if they had\r\nnot caused the loss of a single life. It was to remedy this defect in\r\nthe criminal code that a new statute was introduced.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to trace the progress of that bill from day to\r\nday. It can be followed in the journals of the Lords and Commons. The\r\nbill went to a large committee that included six earls and twelve\r\nbishops.[10] Perhaps the presence of the bishops was an evidence that\r\nwitchcraft was still looked upon as a sin rather than as a crime. It was\r\na matter upon which the opinion of the church had been received before\r\nand might well be accepted again. It was further arranged that the Lord\r\nChief-Justice of the common pleas, Sir Edmund Anderson, and the\r\nattorney-general, the later so famous Sir Edward Coke, along with other\r\neminent jurists, were to act with the committee. Anderson, it will be\r\nrecalled, had presided over numerous trials and had both condemned and\r\nreleased witches. As to Coke's attitude towards this subject, we know\r\nnot a thing, save that he served on this committee. The committee seems\r\nto have found enough to do. At any rate the proposed statute underwent\r\nrevision.[11] Doubtless the privy council had a hand in the matter;[12]\r\nindeed it is not unlikely that the bill was drawn up under its\r\ndirection. On the 9th of June, about two months and a half after its\r\nintroduction, the statute passed its final reading in the Lords.[13] It\r\nrepealed the statute of Elizabeth's reign and provided that any one who\r\n\"shall use, practise or exercise any Invocation or Conjuration of any\r\nevill and wicked Spirit, or shall consult, covenant with, entertaine,\r\nemploye, feede, or rewarde any evill and wicked Spirit to or for any\r\nintent or purpose; or take up any dead man, woman, or child, ... to be\r\nimployed or used in any manner of Witchcrafte\" should suffer death as a\r\nfelon. It further provided that any one who should \"take upon him or\r\nthem by Witchcrafte ... to tell or declare in what place any treasure of\r\nGolde or Silver should or might be founde ... or where Goods or Things\r\nloste or stollen should be founde or become, or to the intent to provoke\r\nany person to unlawfull love, or wherebie any Cattell or Goods of any\r\nperson shall be destroyed, wasted, or impaired, or to hurte or destroy\r\nany person in his or her bodie, although the same be not effected and\r\ndone,\" should for the first offence suffer one year's imprisonment with\r\nfour appearances in the pillory, and for the second offence, death. The\r\nlaw explains itself. Not only the killing of people by the use of evil\r\nspirits, but even the using of evil spirits in such a way as actually\r\nto cause hurt was a capital crime. The second clause punished white\r\nmagic and the intent to hurt, even where it \"be not effected,\" by a\r\nyear's imprisonment and the pillory. It can be easily seen that one of\r\nthe things which the framers of the statute were attempting to\r\naccomplish in their somewhat awkward wording was to make the fact of\r\nwitchcraft as a felony depend chiefly upon a single form of evidence,\r\nthe testimony to the use of evil spirits.\r\n\r\nWe have seen why people with James's convictions about contracts with\r\nthe Devil might desire to rest the crime upon this kind of proof.[14] It\r\ncan be readily understood, too, how the statute would work in practice.\r\nHitherto it had been possible to arraign a witch on the accusations of\r\nher neighbors, but it was not possible to send her to the gallows unless\r\nsome death in the vicinity could be laid to her charge. The community\r\nthat hustled a suspicious woman to court was likely to suffer the\r\nexpense of her imprisonment for a year. It had no assurance that it\r\ncould be finally rid of her.\r\n\r\nUnder the new statute it was only necessary to prove that the woman made\r\nuse of evil spirits, and she was put out of the way. It was a simpler\r\nthing to charge a woman with keeping a \"familiar\" than to accuse her of\r\nmurder. The stories that the village gossips gathered in their rounds\r\nhad the keeping of \"familiars\" for their central interest.[15] It was\r\nonly necessary to produce a few of these gossips in court and the woman\r\nwas doomed.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, this is theory. The practical question is, not how would the\r\nlaw operate, but how did it operate? This brings us again into the\r\ndangerous field of statistics. Now, if we may suppose that the witch\r\ncases known to us are a safe basis of comparison, the reign of James, as\r\nhas already been intimated, shows a notable increase in witch executions\r\nover that of Elizabeth. We have records of between forty and fifty\r\npeople who suffered for the crime during the reign of James, all but one\r\nof them within the first fifteen years. It will be seen that the average\r\nper year is nearly double that of the executions known to us in the\r\nfirst part of Elizabeth's rule, and of course several times that of\r\nthose known in the last part. This increased number we are at once\r\ninclined to assign to the direct and indirect influence of the new king.\r\nBut it may very fairly be asked whether the new statute passed at the\r\nking's suggestion had not been in part responsible for the increased\r\nnumber. This question can be answered from an examination of those cases\r\nwhere we have the charges given. Of thirty-seven such cases in the reign\r\nof James I, where the capital sentence was given, seventeen were on\r\nindictments for witchcrafts that had not caused death. In the other\r\ntwenty cases, the accused were charged with murder.[16]\r\n\r\nThis means that over two-fifths of those who are known to have been\r\nconvicted under the new law would have escaped death under the\r\nElizabethan statute. With all due allowance for the incompleteness of\r\nour statistics, it seems certain that the new law had added very\r\nconsiderably to the number of capital sentences. Subtract the seventeen\r\ndeath sentences for crimes of witchcraft that were not murder from the\r\ntotal number of such sentences, and we have figures not so different\r\nfrom those of Elizabeth's reign.\r\n\r\nThis is a sufficient comment on the effectiveness of the new law as\r\nrespects its particularly novel features. A study of the character of\r\nthe evidence and of the tests of guilt employed at the various trials\r\nduring the reign will show that the phrasing of the law, as well as the\r\nroyal directions for trying guilt, influenced the forms of accusation\r\nand the verdicts of the juries. In other words the testimony rendered in\r\nsome of the well known trials of the reign offers the best commentary\r\nupon the statute as well as upon the _Dæmonologie_. This can be\r\nillustrated from three of the processes employed to determine guilt. The\r\nking had recommended the water ordeal. Up to this time it had not been\r\nemployed in English witch cases, so far as we know. The first record of\r\nits use was in 1612, nine years after James ascended the English throne.\r\nIn that year there was a \"discoverie\" of witches at Northampton. Eight\r\nor nine women were accused of torturing a man and his sister and of\r\nlaming others. One of them was, at the command of a justice of the\r\npeace, cast into the water with \"her hands and feete bound,\" but \"could\r\nnot sink to the bottome by any meanes.\" The same experiment was applied\r\nto Arthur Bill and his parents. He was accused of bewitching a Martha\r\nAspine. His father and mother had long been considered witches. But the\r\n\"matter remaining doubtful that it could not be cleerly tryed upon him,\"\r\nhe (and his parents) were tied with \"their thumbes and great toes ...\r\nacrosse\" and thrown into the water. The suspicion that was before not\r\nwell grounded was now confirmed.[17] To be sure, this was done by the\r\njustices of the peace and we do not know how much it influenced the\r\nassize court.[18]\r\n\r\nThese are the only instances given us by the records of James's reign\r\nwhere this test was employed by the authorities. But in the very next\r\nyear after the Northampton affair it was used in the adjoining county of\r\nBedford by private parties. A land-owner who had suffered ills, as he\r\nthought, from two tenants, Mother Sutton and her daughter, took matters\r\ninto his own hands. His men were ordered to strip the two women \"in to\r\ntheir smocks,\" to tie their arms together, and to throw them into the\r\nwater. The precaution of a \"roape tyed about their middles\" was useless,\r\nfor both floated. This was not enough. The mother, tied toe and thumb,\r\nwas thrown into the water again. She \"sunke not at all, but sitting upon\r\nthe water turned round about like a wheele.... And then being taken up,\r\nshe as boldly as if she had beene innocent asked them if they could doe\r\nany more to her.\"\r\n\r\nThe use of marks as evidence was not as new as the water ordeal. But it\r\nis a rather curious thing that in the two series of cases involving\r\nwater ordeal the other process was also emphasized. In these two\r\ninstances it would seem as if the advice of the _Dæmonologie_ had been\r\ntaken very directly by the accusers.[19] There was one other instance of\r\nthis test.[20] The remarkable thing, however, is that in the most\r\nimportant trial of the time, that at Lancaster in 1612, there was an\r\nutter absence, at least so far as the extant record goes, of female\r\njuries or of reports from them.[21] This method of determining guilt was\r\nnot as yet widely accepted in the courts. We can hardly doubt that it\r\nhad been definitely forbidden at Lancaster.[22] The evidence of the use\r\nof evil spirits, against which the statute of the first year of James I\r\nhad been especially framed, was employed in such a large proportion of\r\ntrials that it is not worth while to go over the cases in detail.\r\n\r\nThe law forbade to take up any dead person or the skin, bone, or other\r\npart thereof for use in witchcraft. Presumably some instance of this\r\nform of witchcraft had been responsible for the phrase, but we have on\r\nrecord no case of the sort until a few years after the passage of the\r\nstatute. It was one of the principal charges against Johanna Harrison\r\nof Royston in 1606 that the officers found in her possession \"all the\r\nbones due to the Anatomy of man and woman.\"[23] This discovery brought\r\nout other charges and she was hanged. At the famous Lancashire trials in\r\n1612 the arch-witch Chattox was declared to have had in her possession\r\nthree scalps and eight teeth. She was guilty on other counts, but she\r\nescaped the executioner by death.\r\n\r\nThese are illustrations of the point that the _Dæmonologie_ and the\r\nstatute of James I find their commentary in the evidence offered at the\r\ntrials. It goes without saying that these illustrations represent only a\r\nfew of the forms of testimony given in the courts. It may not,\r\ntherefore, be amiss to run over some other specimens of the proof that\r\ncharacterized the witch trials of the reign. With most of them we are\r\nalready familiar. The requirement that the witch should repeat certain\r\nwords after the justice of the peace was used once in the reign of\r\nJames. It was an unusual method at best.[24] A commoner form of proof\r\nwas that adduced from the finding or seeing clay or waxen images in the\r\npossession of the accused.[25] The witness who had found such a model on\r\nthe premises of the defendant or had seen the defendant handling it,\r\njumped readily to the conclusion that the image represented some\r\nindividual. If it should be asked how we are to account for this sort of\r\nevidence, the answer is an easy one. Every now and then in the annals of\r\nwitchcraft it came out that a would-be accuser had hidden a waxen or\r\nclay figure in the house of the person he wished to accuse and had then\r\nfound it. No doubt some cases started in this way. No doubt, too, bitter\r\nwomen with grudges to satisfy did experiment with images and were caught\r\nat it. But this was rare. In the greater number of cases the stories of\r\nimages were pure fabrications. To that category belong almost certainly\r\nthe tales told at Lancaster.[26]\r\n\r\n\"Spectral evidence\" we have met with in the Elizabethan period. That\r\nreign saw two or three instances of its employment, and there were more\r\nexamples of it in the reign of James. Master Avery of Northampton, who\r\nwith his sister was the principal accuser in the trials there, saw in\r\none of his fits a black wart on the body of Agnes Brown, a wart which\r\nwas actually found \"upon search.\"[27] Master Avery saw other spectres,\r\nbut the most curious was that of a bloody man desiring him to have mercy\r\non his Mistress Agnes and to cease impeaching her.[28] At Bedford,\r\nMaster Enger's servant had a long story to tell, but the most thrilling\r\npart concerned a visit which the young Mary Sutton (whom he was\r\naccusing) made to him. On a \"moonshine night\" she came in at the window\r\nin her \"accustomed and personall habite and shape\" and knitted at his\r\nside. Then drawing nearer, she offered him terms by which he could be\r\nrestored to his former health, terms which we are to understand the\r\nvirtuous witness refused. It is pleasant to know that Master Enger was\r\n\"distrustfull of the truth\" of this tale. One fears that these spectres\r\nwere not the products of overwrought imagination, as were many others,\r\nbut were merely fabrics of elaborate fiction.[29] In any case they were\r\nnot the groundwork of the proof. In the Fairfax prosecutions at York in\r\n1622 the charges against the six women accused rested entirely upon a\r\ngreat tissue of spectral evidence. The three children had talked to the\r\nspectres, had met them outdoors and at church and in the kitchen. The\r\nspectres were remarkably wise and named visitors whom the family did not\r\nknow. They struggled with the children, they rolled over them in bed,\r\nthey followed them to the neighbors.\r\n\r\nSomewhat akin to the evidence from apparitions was that from the effect\r\nof a witch's glance. This is uncommonly rare in English witchcraft, but\r\nthe reign of James offers two instances of it. In Royston,\r\nHertfordshire, there was \"an honest fellow and as boone a companion ...\r\none that loved the pot with the long necke almost as well as his\r\nprayers.\" One day when he was drinking with four companions Johanna\r\nHarrison came in and \"stood gloating upon them.\" He went home and at\r\nonce fell sick.[30] At Northampton the twelve-year-old Hugh Lucas had\r\nlooked \"stark\" upon Jane Lucas at church and gone into convulsions when\r\nhe returned home.[31]\r\n\r\nOne other form of proof demands notice. In the trial of Jennet Preston\r\nat York it was testified that the corpse of Mr. Lister, whom she was\r\nbelieved to have slain by witchcraft, had bled at her presence. The\r\njudge did not overlook this in summarizing the evidence. It was one of\r\nthree important counts against the woman, indeed it was, says the\r\nimpressive Mr. Potts, quoting the judge, of more consequence than all\r\nthe rest.[32] Of course Mistress Preston went to the gallows.\r\n\r\nIt will occur to the reader to ask whether any sort of evidence was\r\nruled out or objected to. On this point we have but slight knowledge. In\r\nreporting the trial of Elizabeth Sawyer of Edmonton in 1621 the Reverend\r\nHenry Goodcole wrote that a piece of thatch from the accused woman's\r\nhouse was plucked and burned, whereupon the woman presently came upon\r\nthe scene.[33] Goodcole characterized this method as an \"old ridiculous\r\ncustome\" and we may guess that he spoke for the judge too. In the\r\nLancashire cases, Justice Altham, whose credulity knew hardly any\r\nbounds, grew suddenly \"suspitious of the accusation of this yong wench,\r\nJennet Device,\" who had been piling up charges against Alice Nutter. The\r\ngirl was sent out of the room, the witches were mixed up, and Jennet was\r\nrequired on coming in again to pick out Alice Nutter. Of course that\r\nproved an easy matter.[34] At another time, when Jennet was glibly\r\nenumerating the witches that had assembled at the great meeting at\r\nMalking Tower, the judge suddenly asked her if Joane-a-Downe were there.\r\nBut the little girl failed to rise to the bait and answered negatively,\r\nmuch to the satisfaction of everybody, and especially of the righteous\r\nMr. Potts.[35]\r\n\r\nThis is all we know directly about any tendency to question evidence at\r\nLancaster in 1612, but a good deal more may be inferred from what is not\r\nthere. A comparison of that trial with other contemporary trials will\r\nconvince any one that Justices Altham and Bromley must have ruled out\r\ncertain forms of evidence. There were no experiments made of any sort\r\nnor any female juries set inspecting.[36] This, indeed, is not to say\r\nthat all silly testimony was excluded. There is enough and more of sheer\r\nnonsense in the testimony to prove the contrary.\r\n\r\nWe turn now from the question of evidence to a brief consideration of\r\nseveral less prominent features of Jacobean witchcraft. We shall note\r\nthe character of the sentences, the distribution of the trials, the\r\npersonnel and position in life of the accused, and lastly the question\r\nof jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWe have in another connection indicated the approximate number of\r\nexecutions of which we have record in James's reign. That number, we\r\nsaw, was certainly over forty and probably approached fifty. It\r\nrepresented, however, not quite half the total number of cases of\r\naccusation recorded. In consequence the other verdicts and sentences\r\nhave significance. Especially is this true of the acquittals. They\r\namounted to thirty, perhaps to forty. When we add the trials of which we\r\ndo not know the outcome, we can guess that the number was close to the\r\nsum total of executions. Legally only one other outcome of a trial was\r\npossible, a year's imprisonment with quarterly appearances in the\r\npillory. There were three or four instances of this penalty as well as\r\none case where bond of good behavior was perhaps substituted for\r\nimprisonment.[37] Five pardons were issued,[38] three of them by the\r\nauthorities at London, two of them by local powers apparently under\r\ncompulsion.[39]\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the personnel, sex, occupations, and positions\r\nin life of the accused. On certain of these matters it is possible to\r\ngive statistical conclusions, but such conclusions must be accepted with\r\ngreat caution. By a count as careful as the insufficient evidence\r\npermits it would seem that about six times as many women were indicted\r\nas men. This was to be expected. It is perhaps less in accord with\r\ntradition that twice as many married women as spinsters seem to have\r\nfigured in the witch trials of the Jacobean era. The proportion of\r\nwidows to unmarried women was about the same, so that the proportion of\r\nunmarried women among the whole number accused would seem to have been\r\nsmall. These results must be accepted guardedly, yet more complete\r\nstatistics would probably show that the proportion of married women was\r\neven greater.[40]\r\n\r\nThe position in life of these people was not unlike that of the same\r\nclass in the earlier period. In the account of the Lancashire trials we\r\nshall see that the two families whose quarrels started the trouble were\r\nthe lowest of low hill-country people, beggars and charmers, lax in\r\ntheir morals and cunning in their dealings. The Flower women, mother and\r\ndaughter, had been charged with evil living; it was said that Agnes\r\nBrown and her daughter of Northampton had very doubtful reputations;\r\nMother Sutton of Bedford was alleged to have three illegitimate\r\nchildren. The rest of the witches of the time were not, however, quite\r\nso low in the scale. They were household servants, poor tenants, \"hog\r\nhearders,\" wives of yeomen, broomsellers, and what not.\r\n\r\nAbove this motley peasant crew were a few of various higher ranks. A\r\nschoolmaster who had experimented with sorcery against the king,[41] a\r\nminister who had been \"busy with conjuration in his youth,\"[42] a lady\r\ncharged with sorcery but held for other sin,[43] a conjurer who had\r\nrendered professional services to a passionate countess,[44] these make\r\nup a strange group of witches, and for that matter an unimportant one.\r\nNone of their cases were illustrations of the working of witch law; they\r\nwere rather stray examples of the connection between superstition, on\r\nthe one hand, and politics and court intrigue on the other. Not so,\r\nhowever, the prosecution of Alice Nutter in the Lancashire trials of\r\n1612. Alice Nutter was a member of a well known county family. \"She\r\nwas,\" says Potts, \"a rich woman, had a great estate and children of good\r\nhope.\"[45] She was moreover \"of good temper, free from envy and malice.\"\r\nIn spite of all this she was accused of the most desperate crimes and\r\nwent to the gallows. Why family connections and influences could not\r\nhave saved her is a mystery.\r\n\r\nIn another connection we spoke of two witches pardoned by local\r\nauthorities at the instance of the government. This brings us to the\r\nquestion of jurisdiction. The town of Rye had but recently, it would\r\nseem, been granted a charter and certain judicial rights. But when the\r\ntown authorities sentenced one woman to death and indicted another for\r\nwitchcraft, the Lord Warden interfered with a question as to their\r\npower.[46] The town, after some correspondence, gave way and both women\r\nwere pardoned. This was, however, the only instance of disputed\r\njurisdiction. The local powers in King's Lynn hanged a witch without\r\ninterference,[47] and the vicar-general of the Bishop of Durham\r\nproceeded against a \"common charmer\"[48] with impunity, as of course he\r\nhad every right to do.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, a shred of evidence to show that the memory of\r\necclesiastical jurisdiction had not been lost. In the North Riding of\r\nYorkshire the quarter sessions sentenced Ralph Milner for \"sorcerie,\r\nwitchcraft, inchantment and telling of fortunes\" to confess his fault at\r\ndivine service, \"that he hath heighlie offended God and deluded men, and\r\nis heartily sorie.\"[49] There is nothing, of course, in the statute to\r\nauthorize this form of punishment, and it is only accounted for as a\r\nreversion to the original ecclesiastical penalty for a crime that seemed\r\nto belong in church courts.\r\n\r\nWhat we call nowadays mob law had not yet made its appearance--that is,\r\nin connection with witchcraft. We shall see plenty of it when we come to\r\nthe early part of the eighteenth century. But there was in 1613 one\r\nsignificant instance of independence of any jurisdiction, secular or\r\necclesiastical. In the famous case at Bedford, Master Enger, whom we\r\nhave met before, had been \"damnified\" in his property to the round sum\r\nof £200. He was at length persuaded that Mother Sutton was to blame.\r\nWithout any authority whatsoever he brought her forcibly to his house\r\nand caused her to be scratched.[50] Not only so, but he threw the woman\r\nand her daughter, tied and bound, into his mill-pond to prove their\r\nguilt.[51] In the mean time the wretched creatures had been stripped of\r\ntheir clothes and examined for marks, under whose oversight we are not\r\ntold, but Master Enger was responsible. He should have suffered for all\r\nthis, but there is no record of his having done so. On the contrary he\r\ncarried the prosecution of the women to a successful issue and saw them\r\nboth hanged.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the question of the distribution of witchcraft in the\r\nrealm during James's reign. From the incidental references already\r\ngiven, it will be evident that the trials were distributed over a wide\r\narea. In number executed, Lancashire led with ten, Leicester had nine,\r\nNorthampton five or more, Middlesex four,[52] Bedford, Lincoln, York,\r\nBristol, and Hertford each two; Derby had several, the exact number we\r\ncan not learn. These figures of the more serious trials seem to show\r\nthat the alarm was drifting from the southeast corner of England towards\r\nthe midlands. In the last half of Elizabeth's rule the centre had been\r\nto the north of London in the southern midlands. Now it seems to have\r\nprogressed to the northern midlands. Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham\r\nmay be selected as the triangle of counties that would fairly represent\r\nthe centre of the movement. If the matter were to be determined with\r\nmathematical accuracy, the centre would need to be placed perhaps a\r\nlittle farther west, for Stafford, Cheshire, Bristol, and the remote\r\nWelsh Carnarvon all experienced witch alarms. In the north, York and\r\nDurham had their share of trials.\r\n\r\nIt will be easier to realize what had happened when we discover that, so\r\nfar as records go, Kent and Essex were entirely quiet during the period,\r\nand East Anglia almost so. We shall later see that these counties had\r\nnot at all forgotten to believe in witchcraft, but the witchfinders had\r\nceased their activities for a while.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, this reasoning from the distribution of trials is a\r\ndangerous proceeding. Witch alarms, on they face of things, seem\r\nhaphazard outbursts of excitement. And such no doubt they are in part;\r\nyet one who goes over many cases in order cannot fail to observe that an\r\noutbreak in one county was very likely to be followed by one in the next\r\ncounty.[53] This is perfectly intelligible to every one familiar with\r\nthe essentially contagious character of these scares. The stories spread\r\nfrom village to village as fast as that personified Rumor of the poet\r\nVergil, \"than which nothing is fleeter\"; nor did they halt with the\r\nsheriffs at the county boundaries.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the growth of James's opinions until they found\r\neffect in English law, have seen the practical operation of that law,\r\nand have gone over the forms of evidence, as well as some other features\r\nof the witch trials of his reign. In the next chapter we shall take up\r\nsome of the more famous Jacobean cases in detail as examples of witch\r\nalarms. We shall seek to find out how they started and what were the\r\nreal causes at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] I have not attempted to give more than a brief résumé of this story,\r\nand have used Thomas Wright, _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_ (London,\r\n1851), I, 181-190, and Mrs. Lynn Linton, _Witch Stories_, 21-34. The\r\npamphlet about Dr. Fian is a rare one, but may be found in several\r\nlibraries. It has been reprinted by the _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol.\r\nXLIX (1779), by the Roxburghe Club (London, 1816), by Robert Pitcairn,\r\nin his _Criminal Trials in Scotland_ (Edinburgh, 1829-1833), vol. I, and\r\ndoubtless in many other places. Pitcairn has also printed a part of the\r\nrecords of his trial.\r\n\r\n[2] This is all based upon the contemporary accounts mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[3] _Register of the Privy Council of Scotland_, IV (Edinburgh, 1881),\r\n644-645, note.\r\n\r\n[4] A fresh edition was brought out at London in 1603. In 1616 it\r\nappeared again as a part of the handsome collection of his _Workes_\r\ncompiled by the Bishop of Winchester.\r\n\r\n[5] This story is to be found in the apocryphal book of Bel and the\r\nDragon. It played a great part in the discussions of the writers on\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\n[6] H. C. Lea, _Superstition and Force_ (4th ed., Philadelphia, 1892),\r\n325 ff., gives some facts about the water ordeal on the Continent. A\r\nsharp dispute over its use in witch cases was just at this time going on\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[7] He recommended torture in finding out the guilty: \"And further\r\nexperience daily proves how loth they are to confesse without torture,\r\nwhich witnesseth their guiltinesse,\" _Dæmonologie_, bk. ii, ch. i.\r\n\r\n[8] Wright, _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_, I, 197.\r\n\r\n[9] Edward Fairfax, _A Discourse of Witchcraft As it was acted in the\r\nFamily of Mr. Edward Fairfax ... in the year 1621_ (Philobiblon Soc.,\r\n_Miscellanies_, V, ed. R. Monckton Milnes, London, 1858-1859), \"Preface\r\nto the Reader,\" 26, explains the king's motive: His \"Majesty found a\r\ndefect in the statutes, ... by which none died for Witchcraft but they\r\nonly who by that means killed, so that such were executed rather as\r\nmurderers than as Witches.\"\r\n\r\n[10] _Journals of the House of Lords_, II, 269; Wm.

Cited hereafter as Potts.\r\n\r\n[16] See, below, appendix B. It should be added that six others who had\r\nbeen condemned by the judges for bewitching a boy were released at\r\nJames's command.\r\n\r\n[17] _The Witches of Northamptonshire ..._ C 2 verso. The writer of this\r\npamphlet, who does not tell the story of the ordeal so fully as the\r\nauthor of the MS. account, \"A briefe abstract of the arraignment of nine\r\nwitches at Northampton, July 21, 1612\" (Brit. Mus., Sloane, 972), gives,\r\nhowever, proof of the influence of James in the matter. He says that the\r\ntwo ways of testing witches are by the marks and \"the trying of the\r\ninsensiblenesse thereof,\" and by \"their fleeting on the water,\" which is\r\nan exact quotation from James, although not so indicated.\r\n\r\n[18] The mother and father were apparently not sent to the assize court.\r\n\r\n[19] The female jury was used at Northampton (\"women sworn\"), also at\r\nBedford, but by a private party.\r\n\r\n[20] It was used in 1621 on Elizabeth Sawyer of Edmonton. In this case\r\nit was done clearly at the command of the judge who tried her at the Old\r\nBailey.\r\n\r\n[21] Elizabeth Device, however, confessed that the \"said Devill did get\r\nblood under her left arme,\" which raises a suspicion that this\r\nconfession was the result of accusations against her on that score.\r\n\r\n[22] See account in next chapter of the trial at Lancaster.\r\n\r\n[23] This case must be used with hesitation; see below, appendix A, § 3.\r\n\r\n[24] At Warboys the Samuels had been required to repeat: \"If I be a\r\nwitch and consenting to the death\" of such and such a one. Alice Wilson,\r\nat Northampton in 1612, was threatened by the justice with execution, if\r\nshe would not say after the minister \"I forsake the Devil.\" She is said\r\nto have averred that she could not say this. See MS. account of the\r\nwitches of Northampton.\r\n\r\n[25] Well known is the practice ascribed to witches of making a waxen\r\nimage, which was then pricked or melted before the fire, in the belief\r\nthat the torments inflicted upon it would be suffered by the individual\r\nit represented.\r\n\r\n[26] Potts, E 3 verso, F 4, G 2; also _The Wonderful Discoverie of the\r\nWitchcrafts of Margaret and Phillip Flower, ..._ (London, 1619), 21.\r\n\r\n[27] See MS. account of the Northampton witches.\r\n\r\n[28] _Ibid._: \"Sundry other witches appeared to him.... Hee heard many\r\nof them railing at Jane Lucas, laying the fault on her that they were\r\nthus accused.\"\r\n\r\n[29] There was practically no spectral evidence in the Lancashire cases.\r\nLister on his death-bed had cried out against Jennet Preston, and John\r\nLaw was tormented with a vision of Alizon Device \"both day and night\";\r\nPotts, Y 2 verso.

The Bedford trial resembled much the Northampton trial of the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nNOTABLE JACOBEAN CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible to sift, to analyze, and to reconstruct the material\r\nderived from witch trials until some few conclusions about a given\r\nperiod can be ventured. A large proportion of cases can be proved to\r\nbelong in this or that category, a certain percentage of the women can\r\nbe shown to possess these or those traits in common. Yet it is quite\r\nthinkable that one might be armed with a quiver full of generalizations,\r\nand fail, withal, to comprehend Jacobean witchcraft. If one could have\r\nasked information on the subject from a Londoner of 1620, he would\r\nprobably have heard little about witchcraft in general, but a very great\r\ndeal about the Lancashire, Northampton, Leicester, Lincoln, and Fairfax\r\ntrials. The Londoner might have been able to tell the stories complete\r\nof all those famous cases. He would have been but poorly informed could\r\nhe not have related some of them, and the listener would have caught the\r\nsurface drift of those stories. But a witch panic is a subtle thing, not\r\nto be understood by those who do not follow all its deeper sequences.\r\nThe springs of the movement, the interaction of cause and effect, the\r\noperation of personal traits, these are factors that must be evaluated,\r\nand they are not factors that can be fitted into a general scheme,\r\nlabelled and classified.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the cases should be examined in chronological\r\nsequence. That is not necessary; for the half-dozen cases that we shall\r\nrun over had little or no cause-and-effect connection with one another.\r\nIt is convenient, indeed, to make some classification, and the simplest\r\nis that by probable origin, especially as it will enable us to emphasize\r\nthat important feature of the trials. Now, by this method the six or\r\nmore trials of note may be grouped under three headings: cases that seem\r\nto have originated in the actual practice of magic, cases where the\r\nvictims of convulsions and fits started the furor, and cases that were\r\nsimply the last stage of bitter quarrels or the result of grudges.\r\n\r\nTo the first group belongs the Lancastrian case of 1612, which, however,\r\nmay also be classed under the last heading. No case in the course of the\r\nsuperstition in England gained such wide fame. Upon it Shadwell founded\r\nin part a well-known play, _The Lancashire Witches_, while poets and\r\nwriters of prose have referred to it until the two words have been\r\nlinked in a phrase that has given them lasting association. It was in\r\nthe lonely forest of Pendle among the wild hills of eastern Lancashire\r\nthat there lived two hostile families headed by Elizabeth Southerns, or\r\n\"Old Demdike,\" and by Anne Chattox. The latter was a wool carder, \"a\r\nvery old, withered, spent, and decreped creature,\" \"her lippes ever\r\nchattering\"; the former a blind beggar of four-score years, \"a generall\r\nagent for the Devell in all these partes,\" and a \"wicked fire-brand of\r\nmischiefe,\" who had brought up her children and grandchildren to be\r\nwitches. Both families professed supernatural practices. Both families\r\nno doubt traded on the fear they inspired. Indeed Dame Chattox was said\r\nto have sold her guarantee to do no harm in return for a fixed annual\r\npayment of \"one aghen-dole of meale.\"\r\n\r\nThat there was a feud between the two clans was to be expected. They\r\nwere at once neighbors and competitors, and were engaged in a career in\r\nwhich they must plot each against the other, and suspect each other.\r\nThere are hints of other difficulties. Years before there had been a\r\nquarrel over stolen property. Demdike's daughter had missed clothes and\r\nfood to the value of 20 shillings, and had later found some of the\r\nclothing in the possession of Chattox's daughter. A more serious\r\ndifficulty involved a third family: a member of the Nutter family,\r\nwell-to-do people in Lancashire, had sought to seduce old Chattox's\r\nmarried daughter, and, when repelled, had warned her that when he\r\ninherited the property where she lived she should be evicted. Chattox\r\nhad retaliated by seeking to kill Nutter by witchcraft, and had been\r\nfurther incited thereto by three women, who wished to be rid of Nutter,\r\nin order that \"the women, their coosens, might have the land.\" As a\r\nconsequence Nutter had died within three months. The quarrel, indeed,\r\nwas three-cornered. It was said that Demdike's daughter had fashioned a\r\nclay picture of a Nutter woman.[1]\r\n\r\nWe have all the elements here of a mountain feud; but, in place of the\r\nrevolvers and Kentucky moonshine of to-day, we have clay images and\r\nSatanic banquets. The battles were to be fought out with imps of Hell as\r\nparticipants and with ammunition supplied by the Evil One himself. It\r\nwas this connection with a reservoir of untouched demoniacal powers that\r\nmade the quarrel of the miserable mountaineers the most celebrated\r\nincident in Lancashire story. Here were charmers and \"inchanters,\"\r\nexperienced dealers in magic, struggling against one another. Small\r\nwonder that the community became alarmed and that Roger Nowell, justice\r\nof the peace, suddenly swooped down upon the Pendle families. It was but\r\na short time before he had four women cooped up in Lancaster castle. In\r\na few days more he was able to get confessions out of them. They\r\nadmitted acquaintance with the Devil and implicated one another.\r\n\r\nNow comes the strange part of the story. According to confessions made\r\nlater, Elizabeth Device, not yet shut up, but likely to be at any time,\r\ncalled a meeting on Good Friday of all the witches in Pendle forest.\r\nThey were to come to her home at Malking Tower to plot the delivery of\r\nthe imprisoned women by the blowing up of Lancaster castle.[2] The\r\naffair took the form of a dinner; and beef, bacon, and roasted mutton\r\nwere served. \"All the witches went out of the said House in their owne\r\nshapes and likenesses. And they all, by that they were forth of the\r\ndores, gotten on Horsebacke, like unto Foales, some of one colour, some\r\nof another; and Preston's wife was the last; and, when shee got on\r\nHorsebacke, they all presently vanished out of ... sight.\" This was the\r\nstory, and the various witnesses agreed remarkably well as to its main\r\ndetails. Those who believed in the \"sabbath\" of witches must have felt\r\ntheir opinions confirmed by the testimony of the witnesses at Lancaster.\r\nEven the modern reader, with his skepticism, is somewhat daunted by the\r\ncumulative force of what purports to be the evidence and would fain\r\nrationalize it by supposing that some sort of a meeting actually did\r\ntake place at Malking Tower and that some Pendle men and women who had\r\ndelved in magic arts till they believed in them did formulate plans for\r\nrevenge. But this is not a probable supposition. The concurring evidence\r\nin the Malking Tower story is of no more compelling character than that\r\nto be found in a multitude of Continental stories of witch gatherings\r\nwhich have been shown to be the outcome of physical or mental pressure\r\nand of leading questions. It seems unnecessary to accept even a\r\nsubstratum of fact.[3] Probably one of the accused women invented the\r\nstory of the witch feast after the model of others of which she had\r\nheard, or developed it under the stimulus of suggestive questions from a\r\njustice. Such a narrative, once started, would spread like wildfire and\r\nthe witnesses and the accused who were persuaded to confess might tell\r\napproximately the same story. A careful re-reading of all this evidence\r\nsuggests that the various testimonies may indeed have been echoes of the\r\nfirst narrative. They seem to lack those characteristic differences\r\nwhich would stamp them as independent accounts. Moreover, when the story\r\nwas once started, it is not improbable that the justices and the judges\r\nwould assist the witnesses by framing questions based upon the narrative\r\nalready given. It cannot be said that the evidence exists upon which to\r\nestablish this hypothesis. There is little to show that the witnesses\r\nwere adroitly led into their narratives. But we know from other trials\r\nthat the method was so often adopted that it is not a far cry to suspect\r\nthat it was used at Lancaster.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to trace out the wearisome details that were\r\nelicited by confession. Those already in prison made confessions that\r\nimplicated others, until the busy justices of the peace had shut up\r\nsixteen women and four men to be tried at the assizes. Sir Edward\r\nBromley and Sir James Altham, who were then on the northern circuit,\r\nreached Lancaster on the sixteenth of August. In the meantime, \"Old\r\nDemdike,\" after a confession of most awful crimes, had died in prison.\r\nAll the others were put on trial. Thomas Potts compiled a very careful\r\nabstract of all the testimony taken, perhaps the most detailed account\r\nof a witch trial written in the English language, with the possible\r\nexception of the St. Oses affair. The evidence was in truth of a\r\nsomewhat similar type. Secret interviews with the Evil One, promises of\r\nworldly riches, a contract sealed with blood, little shapes of dogs,\r\ncats, and hares, clay pictures that had been dried and had crumpled,\r\nthreats and consequent \"languishing\" and death, these were the trappings\r\nof the stories. The tales were old. Only the Malking Tower incident was\r\nnew. But its very novelty gave a plausibility to the stories that were\r\nwoven around it. There was not a single person to interpose a doubt. The\r\ncross-examinations were nothing more than feeble attempts to bring out\r\nfurther charges.\r\n\r\nThough there is in the record little suggestion of the use of pressure\r\nto obtain the confessions, the fact that three were retracted leads to\r\na suspicion that they had not been given quite freely. There was\r\ndoubtless something contagious about the impulse to confess. It is,\r\nnevertheless, a curious circumstance that five members of the two rival\r\nPendle families made confession, while all the others whom their\r\nconfessions had involved stuck to it that they were innocent.[4] Among\r\nthose who persisted in denying their guilt Alice Nutter merits special\r\nnote. We have already mentioned her in the last chapter as an example of\r\na well-to-do and well connected woman who fell a victim to the\r\nLancashire excitement.[5] The evidence against the woman was perhaps the\r\nflimsiest ever offered to a court. Elizabeth Device, daughter of \"Old\r\nDemdike,\" and her two children were the chief accusers. Elizabeth had\r\nseen her present at the Malking Tower meeting. Moreover, she stated that\r\nAlice had helped her mother (\"Old Demdike\") bewitch a man to death. Her\r\nson had heard his grandmother Demdike narrate the incident. This\r\ntestimony and his sister's definite statement that Alice Nutter attended\r\nthe Malking Tower meeting established Mistress Nutter's guilt.[6] The\r\njudge, indeed, was \"very suspitious of the accusation of this yong\r\nwench, Jennet Device,\" and, as we have already seen, caused her to be\r\nsent out of the court room till the accused lady could be placed among\r\nother prisoners, when the girl was recalled and required before the\r\ngreat audience present to pick out the witch, as, of course, she easily\r\ndid, and as easily escaped another transparent trap.[7]\r\n\r\nThe two children figured prominently from this on. The nine-year-old\r\ngirl gave evidence as to events of three years before, while the young\r\nman, who could hardly have been out of his teens,[8] recounted what had\r\nhappened twelve years earlier. It was their testimony against their\r\nmother that roused most interest. Although of a circumstantial\r\ncharacter, it fitted in most remarkable fashion into the evidence\r\nalready presented.[9] The mother, says the nonchalant pamphleteer,\r\nindignantly \"cryed out against the child,\" cursing her so outrageously\r\nthat she was removed from the room while the child kept the stand. It is\r\nuseless to waste sympathy upon a mother who was getting at the hands of\r\nher children the same treatment she had given her own mother Demdike.\r\nThe Chattox family held together better. Mistress Redfearne had been\r\ncarefully shielded in the testimony of her mother Chattox, but she fell\r\na victim to the accusations of the opposing family. The course of her\r\ntrial was remarkable. Denying her guilt with great emphasis, she had by\r\nsome wonder been acquitted. But this verdict displeased the people in\r\nattendance upon the trial. Induced by the cries of the people, the court\r\nwas persuaded to try her again. The charge against her was exactly the\r\nsame, that eighteen years before she had participated in killing\r\nChristopher Nutter with a clay figure. \"Old Demdike\" had seen her in the\r\nact of making the image, and there was offered also the testimony of\r\nthe sister and brother of the dead man, who recalled that Robert Nutter\r\non his death-bed had accused Anne of his bewitchment.[10] It does not\r\nseem to have occurred to the court that the principle that a person\r\ncould not twice be put in jeopardy for the same offence was already an\r\nold principle in English law.[11] The judges were more concerned with\r\nappeasing the people than with recalling old precedents, and sent the\r\nwoman to the gallows.\r\n\r\nThe Pendle cases were interrupted on the third day by the trial of three\r\nwomen from Salmesbury, who pleaded not guilty and put themselves \"upon\r\nGod and their Countrey.\" The case against them rested upon the testimony\r\nof a single young woman, Grace Sowerbutts, who declared that for the\r\nthree years past she had been vexed by the women in question, who \"did\r\nviolently draw her by the haire of the head, and layd her on the toppe\r\nof a Hay-mowe.\" This delightfully absurd charge was coupled with some\r\ntestimony about the appearances of the accused in animal form. Three men\r\nattempted to bolster up the story; but no \"matter of witchcraft\" was\r\nproved, says the for once incredulous Mr. Potts. The women seized the\r\ndecisive moment. They kneeled before the judge and requested him to\r\nexamine Grace Sowerbutts as to who set her on. The judge--who had\r\nseemingly not thought of this before--followed the suggestion. The girl\r\nchanged countenance and acknowledged that she had been taught her story.\r\nAt the order of the judge she was questioned by a clergyman and two\r\njustices of the peace, who found that she had been coached to tell her\r\nstory by a Master Thompson, alias Southworth, a \"seminarie priest.\" So\r\nended the charges against the Salmesbury witches.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that this verdict might have turned the tide in the\r\nother cases. But the evidence, as Potts is careful to show, lest the\r\nreader should draw a wrong conclusion, was of very different character\r\nin the other trials. They were all finished on the third day of court\r\nand turned over to the jury. Five of the accused, exclusive of those at\r\nSalmesbury, were acquitted, one condemned to a year's imprisonment, and\r\nten sentenced to death. To this number should be added Jennet Preston,\r\nwho had in the preceding month been tried at York for the killing of a\r\nMr. Lister, and who was named by the Lancaster witnesses as one of the\r\ngang at Malking Tower.\r\n\r\nSo ended the Lancashire trials of 1612. The most remarkable event of the\r\nsort in James's reign, they were clearly the outcome of his writings and\r\npolicy. Potts asks pointedly: \"What hath the King's Maiestie written and\r\npublished in his Dæmonologie by way of premonition and prevention, which\r\nhath not here by the first or last beene executed, put in practice, or\r\ndiscovered?\"\r\n\r\nOur second group of cases includes those where convulsive and\r\n\"possessed\" persons had started the alarm. The Northampton, Leicester,\r\nand Lichfield cases were all instances in point. The last two, however,\r\nmay be omitted here because they will come up in another connection. The\r\naffair at Northampton in 1612, just a month earlier than the Lancashire\r\naffair, merits notice. Elizabeth Belcher and her brother, \"Master\r\nAvery,\" were the disturbing agents. Mistress Belcher had long been\r\nsuffering with an illness that baffled diagnosis. It was suggested to\r\nher that the cause was witchcraft. A list of women reputed to be witches\r\nwas repeated to her. The name of Joan Brown seemed to impress her. \"Hath\r\nshee done it?\" she asked.[12] The name was repeated to her and from that\r\ntime she held Joan guilty.[13] Joan and her mother were shut up.\r\nMeantime Master Avery began to take fits and to aid his sister in making\r\naccusation. Between them they soon had accused six women for their\r\nafflictions. The stir brought to the surface the hidden suspicions of\r\nothers. There was a witch panic and the justices of the peace[14]\r\nscurried hither and thither till they had fourteen witches locked up in\r\nNorthampton. When the trial came off at Northampton, Master Avery was\r\nthe hero. He re-enacted the rôle of the Throckmorton children at Warboys\r\nwith great success. When he came to court--he came in a \"coch\"--he was\r\nat once stricken with convulsions. His torments in court were very\r\nconvincing. It is pleasant to know that when he came out of his seizure\r\nhe would talk very \"discreetly, christianly, and charitably.\" Master\r\nAvery was versatile, however. His evidence against the women rested by\r\nno means alone on his seizures. He had countless apparitions in which he\r\nsaw the accused;[15] he had been mysteriously thrown from a horse;\r\nstrangest of all, he had foretold at a certain time that if any one\r\nshould go down to the gaol and listen to the voices of the witches, he\r\ncould not understand a word. Whereupon a Master of Arts of Trinity\r\nCollege, Oxford, went off to the prison at the uncanny hour of two in\r\nthe morning and \"heard a confused noise of much chattering and chiding,\r\nbut could not discover a ready word.\"\r\n\r\nMaster Avery had a great deal more to tell, but the jury seem not to\r\nhave fully credited him.[16] They convicted Joan Brown and her mother,\r\nhowever, on the charges of Elizabeth and her brother. Three others were\r\nfound guilty upon other counts. None of them, so far as the records go,\r\nand the records were careful on this point, admitted any guilt.[17] The\r\none young man among those who were hanged bitterly resisted his\r\nconviction from the beginning and died declaring that authority had\r\nturned to tyranny. He might well feel so. His father and mother had both\r\nbeen tortured by the water ordeal, and his mother had been worried till\r\nshe committed suicide in prison.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the third sort of cases, those that were the outcome\r\nof quarrels or grudges. It has already been observed that the Lancashire\r\naffair could very well be reckoned under this heading. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that a goodly percentage of all other witch trials\r\nin the reign of James could be classified in the same way. Most notable\r\namong them was the famous trial of the Belvoir witches at Lincoln in\r\n1618-1619. The trial has received wide notice because it concerned a\r\nleading family--perhaps the wealthiest in England--the great Catholic\r\nfamily of Manners, of which the Earl of Rutland was head. The effort to\r\naccount for the mysterious illness of his young heir and for that which\r\nhad a few years earlier carried off the boy's elder brother led to a\r\ncharge of witchcraft against three humble women of the neighborhood. The\r\nRutland affair shows how easily a suspicion of witchcraft might involve\r\nthe fortunes of the lowly with those of the great. Joan Flower and her\r\ntwo daughters had been employed as charwomen in Belvoir Castle, the home\r\nof the Rutlands. One of the daughters, indeed, had been put in charge of\r\n\"the poultrey abroad and the washhouse within dores.\" But this daughter\r\nseems not to have given satisfaction to the countess in her work, some\r\nother causes of disagreement arose which involved Mother Flower, and\r\nboth Mother Flower and her daughter were sent away from the castle. This\r\nwas the beginning of the trouble. Mother Flower \"cursed them all that\r\nwere the cause of this discontentment.\" Naturally little heed was paid\r\nto her grumblings. Such things were common enough and it did not even\r\noccur to any one, when the eldest son of the earl sickened and died,\r\nthat the event was in any way connected with the malice of the Flowers.\r\nIt was not until about five years later, when the younger son Francis\r\nfell sick of an illness to prove fatal, that suspicion seems to have\r\nlighted upon the three women.[18] The circumstances that led to their\r\ndischarge were then recalled and along with them a mass of idle gossip\r\nand scandal against the women. It was remembered that Mother Joan was\r\n\"a monstrous malicious woman, full of oathes, curses, and imprecations\r\nirreligious.\" Some of her neighbors \"dared to affirme that she dealt\r\nwith familiar spirits, and terrified them all with curses and threatning\r\nof revenge.\" At length, in February of 1618/19, on the return of the\r\nearl from attending His Majesty \"both at Newmarket before Christmas and\r\nat Christmas at Whitehall,\" the women were fetched before justices of\r\nthe peace, who bound them over to the assizes at Lincoln. Mother Flower\r\ndied on the way to Lincoln, but the two daughters were tried there\r\nbefore Sir Edward Bromley, who had been judge at the Lancashire trials,\r\nand before Sir Henry Hobart. The women made a detailed confession of\r\nweird crimes. There were tales of gloves belonging to the two young sons\r\nof the earl, gloves that had been found in uncanny places and had been\r\nput in hot water and rubbed upon Rutterkin the cat--or spirit. There\r\nwere worse stories that will not bear repetition. Needless to say,\r\nMargaret and Philippa Flower were convicted and hanged.[19]\r\n\r\nThe Rutland cases have been used to illustrate how the witch accusation\r\nmight arise out of a grudge or quarrel. There were three or four other\r\ncases that illustrate this origin of the charge. The first is that of\r\nJohanna Harrison--she has been mentioned in the previous chapter--who\r\nhad an \"altercation\" with a neighbor. Of course she threatened him, he\r\nfell ill, and he scratched her.[20] But here the commonplace tale takes\r\na new turn. She had him arrested and was awarded five shillings damages\r\nand her costs of suit. No wonder the man fell sick again. Perhaps--but\r\nthis cannot be certain--it was the same man who was drinking his ale one\r\nday with his fellows when she entered and stood \"gloating\" over him. He\r\nturned and said, \"Doe you heare, Witch, looke tother waies.\" The woman\r\nberated him with angry words, and, feeling ill the next morning--he had\r\nbeen drinking heavily the night before--he dragged her off to the\r\njustice. A few weeks later she and her daughter were hanged at\r\nHertford.[21]\r\n\r\nThe story of Mother Sutton and Master Enger has been referred to in\r\nseveral connections, but it will bear telling in narrative form. Mother\r\nSutton was a poor tenant of Master Enger's, \"a gentleman of worship,\"\r\nwho often bestowed upon her \"food and cloathes.\" On account of her want\r\nshe had been chosen village \"hog-heard,\" and had for twenty years\r\nfulfilled the duties of her office \"not without commendations.\" But it\r\nhappened that she quarreled one day with her benefactor, and then his\r\ndifficulties began. The tale is almost too trivial for repetition, but\r\nis nevertheless characteristic. Master Enger's servants were taking some\r\ncorn to market, when they met \"a faire black sowe\" grazing. The wayward\r\nbeast began turning round \"as readily as a Windmill sail at worke; and\r\nas sodainly their horses fell to starting and drawing some one way, some\r\nanother.\" They started off with the cart of corn, but broke from it and\r\nran away. The servants caught them and went on to Bedford with the load.\r\nBut the sow followed. When the corn had been sold, one of the servants\r\nwent home, the other stayed with his \"boone companions.\" When he rode\r\nhome later, he found the sow grazing outside of town. It ran by his\r\nside, and the horses ran away again. But the servants watched the sow\r\nand saw it enter Mother Sutton's house. Master Enger made light of the\r\nstory when it was told to him, and, with remarkable insight for a\r\ncharacter in a witch story, \"supposed they were drunke.\" But a few days\r\nlater the same servant fell into conversation with Mother Sutton, when a\r\nbeetle came and struck him. He fell into a trance, and then went home\r\nand told his master. The next night the servant said that Mary Sutton\r\nentered his room--the vision we have already described.[22]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story the reader knows from the last chapter. Mother\r\nSutton and her daughter were put to various ordeals and at length\r\nhanged. Doubtless the imaginative servant, who had in some way, perhaps,\r\nbeen involved in the original quarrel, gained favor with his master, and\r\nstanding in the community.[23]\r\n\r\nThe tale of the Bakewell witches is a very curious one and, though not\r\nto be confidently depended upon, may suggest how it was possible to\r\navail oneself of superstition in order to repay a grudge. A Scotchman\r\nstaying at a lodging-house in Bakewell fell in debt to his landlady, who\r\nretained some of his clothes as security. He went to London, concealed\r\nhimself in a cellar, and was there found by a watchman, who arrested him\r\nfor being in an unoccupied house with felonious intent. He professed to\r\nbe dazed and declared that he was at Bakewell in Derbyshire at three\r\no'clock that morning. He explained it by the fact that he had repeated\r\ncertain words which he had heard his lodging-house keeper and her sister\r\nsay. The judge was amazed, the man's depositions were taken down, and he\r\nwas sent to the justices of Derby.\r\n\r\nAll that we really know about the Bakewell affair is that several\r\nwitches probably suffered death there in 1607. A local antiquarian has\r\ngiven this tale of how the alarm started.[24] While it is unlike any\r\nother narrative of witchcraft, it is not necessarily without foundation.\r\n\r\nThe reader has doubtless observed that the cases which we have been\r\ndescribing occurred, all of them with one exception, between 1603 and\r\n1619. In discussing the matter of the distribution of witchcraft in the\r\nlast chapter we noted that not only executions for the crime, but even\r\naccusations and indictments, were nearly altogether limited to the first\r\nfifteen years of James's rule. If it is true that there was a rather\r\nsudden falling off of prosecution in the reign of the zealous James, the\r\nfact merits explanation. Fortunately the explanation is not far to seek.\r\nThe king's faith in the verity of many of the charges made against\r\nwitches had been rudely shaken. As a matter of fact there had always\r\nbeen a grain of skepticism in his make-up. This had come out even before\r\nhe entered England. In 1597 he had become alarmed at the spread of\r\ntrials in Scotland and had revoked all the commissions then in force for\r\nthe trial of the offence.[25] At the very time when he became king of\r\nEngland, there were special circumstances that must have had weight with\r\nhim. Throughout the last years of Elizabeth's reign there had been, as\r\nwe have seen, a morbid interest in demoniacal possession, an interest to\r\nwhich sensation-mongers were quickly minded to respond. We saw that at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century the Anglican church stepped in to put\r\ndown the exorcizing of spirits,[26] largely perhaps because it had been\r\ncarried on by Catholics and by a Puritan clergyman. Yet neither\r\nHarsnett's book nor Darrel's imprisonment quite availed to end a\r\npractice which offered at all times to all comers a path to notoriety.\r\nJames had not been on the English throne a year when he became\r\ninterested in a case of this kind. Mary Glover, a girl alleged to have\r\nbeen bewitched by a Mother Jackson, was at the king's wish examined by a\r\nskilled physician, Dr. Edward Jorden, who recognized her fits as\r\ndisease, brought the girl to a confession, published an account of the\r\nmatter, and so saved the life of the woman whom she had accused.[27]\r\n\r\nIn the very next year there was a case at Cambridge that gained royal\r\nnotice. It is not easy to straighten out the facts from the letters on\r\nthe matter, but it seems that two Cambridge maids had a curious disease\r\nsuggesting bewitchment.[28] A Franciscan and a Puritan clergyman were,\r\nalong with others, suspected. The matter was at once referred to the\r\nking and the government. James directed that examinations be made and\r\nreported to him. This was done. James wormed out of the \"principal\" some\r\nadmission of former dealing with conjuration, but turned the whole thing\r\nover to the courts, where it seems later to have been established that\r\nthe disease of the bewitched maidens was \"naturall.\"\r\n\r\nThese were but the first of several impostures that interested the king.\r\nA girl at Windsor, another in Hertfordshire, were possessed by the\r\nDevil,[29] two maids at Westminster were \"in raptures from the Virgin\r\nMary and Michael the Archangel,\"[30] a priest of Leicestershire was\r\n\"possessed of the Blessed Trinity.\"[31] Such cases--not to mention the\r\nGrace Sowerbutts confessions at Lancaster that were like to end so\r\ntragically--were the excrescences of an intensely religious age. The\r\nreader of early colonial diaries in America will recognize the\r\nresemblance of these to the wonders they report. James took such with\r\nextreme seriousness.[32] The possessed person was summoned to court for\r\nexhibition, or the king went out of his way to see him. It is a matter\r\nof common information that James prided himself on his cleverness.\r\nHaving succeeded in detecting certain frauds, he became an expert\r\ndetective. In one instance \"he ordered it so that a proper courtier made\r\nlove to one of these bewitched maids\"[33] and soon got her over her\r\ntroubles. In another case a woman \"strangely affected\" by the first\r\nverse of John's Gospel failed to recognize it when read in Greek,[34]\r\nproof positive that the omniscient Devil did not possess her.\r\n\r\nThree instances of exposure of imposture were most notable, those of\r\nGrace Sowerbutts, the boy at Leicester, and the \"Boy of Bilston.\" The\r\nfirst of these has already been sufficiently discussed in connection\r\nwith the Lancashire trials. The second had nothing remarkable about it.\r\nA twelve or thirteen-year-old boy had fits which he said were caused by\r\nspirits sent by several women whom he accused as witches. Nine women\r\nwere hanged, while six more were under arrest and would probably have\r\nmet the same end, had not the king in his northward progress, while\r\nstopping at Leicester, detected the shamming.[35] Whether or no the boy\r\nwas punished we are not told. It is some satisfaction that the judges\r\nwere disgraced.[36]\r\n\r\nThe boy of Bilston was, if Webster may be believed,[37] the most famous,\r\nif not the most successful, fraud of all. The case was heralded over the\r\nentire realm and thousands came to see. The story is almost an exact\r\nduplicate of earlier narratives of possession. A thirteen-year-old boy\r\nof Bilston in Staffordshire, William Perry, began to have fits and to\r\naccuse a Jane Clarke, whose presence invariably made him worse. He \"cast\r\nout of his mouth rags, thred, straw, crooked pins.\" These were but\r\nsingle deceptions in a repertoire of varied tricks. Doubtless he had\r\nbeen trained in his rôle by a Roman priest. At any rate the Catholics\r\ntried exorcism upon him, but to no purpose. Perhaps some Puritans\r\nexperimented with cures which had like result.[38] The boy continued his\r\nspasms and his charges against the witch and she was brought into court\r\nat the July assizes. But Bishop Morton,[39] before whose chancellor the\r\nboy had first been brought, was present, and the judges turned the boy\r\nover to him for further investigation.[40] Then, with the help of his\r\nsecretary, he set about to test the boy, and readily exposed his\r\ndeception--in most curious fashion too. The boy, like one we have met\r\nbefore, could not endure the first verse of John's Gospel, but failed to\r\nrecognize it when read in the Greek. After that he was secretly watched\r\nand his somewhat elaborate preparations for his pretences were found\r\nout. He was persuaded to confess his trickery in court before Sir Peter\r\nWarburton and Sir Humphrey Winch, \"and the face of the County and\r\nCountry there assembled,\"[41] as well as to beg forgiveness of the women\r\nwhom he had accused.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the records of imposture were well on their way to\r\nrival the records of witchcraft, if not in numbers, at least in the\r\nnotice that they received. And the king who had so bitterly arraigned\r\nReginald Scot was himself becoming the discoverer-general of\r\nEngland.[42] It is not, then, without being forewarned that we read\r\nFuller's remarkable statement about the king's change of heart. \"The\r\nfrequency of such forged possessions wrought such an alteration upon the\r\njudgement of King James that he, receding from what he had written in\r\nhis 'Dæmonology,' grew first diffident of, and then flatly to deny, the\r\nworkings of witches and devils, as but falsehoods and delusions.\"[43] In\r\nimmediate connection with this must be quoted what Francis Osborne has\r\nto say.[44] He was told, he writes, that the king would have gone as far\r\nas to deny any such operations, but out of reasons of state and to\r\ngratify the church.[45]\r\n\r\nSuch a conversion is so remarkable that we could wish we had absolutely\r\ncontemporary statements of it. As a matter of fact, the statements we\r\nhave quoted establish nothing more than a probability, but they\r\ncertainly do establish that. Fuller, the church historian, responsible\r\nfor the first of the two statements, was a student in Queen's\r\nCollege[46] at Cambridge during the last four years of James's reign;\r\nOsborne was a man of thirty-two when the king died, and had spent a\r\npart of his young manhood at the court. Their testimony was that of men\r\nwho had every opportunity to know about the king's change of\r\nopinion.[47] In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we must\r\naccept, at least provisionally, their statements.[48] And it is easier\r\nto do so in view of the marked falling off of prosecutions that we have\r\nalready noted. This indeed is confirmation of a negative sort; but we\r\nhave one interesting bit of affirmative proof, the outcome of the trials\r\nat York in 1622. In that year the children of Mr. Edward Fairfax, a\r\nmember of the historic Fairfax family of Yorkshire, were seized with\r\nsome strange illness, in which they saw again and again the spectres of\r\nsix different women. These women were examined by the justices of the\r\npeace and committed to the assizes.[49] In the mean time they had found\r\nable and vigorous defenders in the community. What happened at the April\r\nassizes we no not know, but we know that four of the women were\r\nreleased, two of them on bond.[50] This was probably a compromise method\r\nof settling the matter. Fairfax was not satisfied. Probably through his\r\ninfluence the women were again brought up at the August assizes.[51]\r\nThen, at least, as we know beyond a doubt, they were formally tried,\r\nthis time upon indictments preferred by Fairfax himself.[52] The judge\r\nwarned the jury to be very careful, and, after hearing some of the\r\nevidence, dismissed the women on the ground that the evidence \"reached\r\nnot to the point of the statute.\"[53] This seems significant. A man of a\r\nwell known county family was utterly baffled in pressing charges in a\r\ncase where his own children were involved.[54] It looks as if there were\r\njudges who were following the king's lead in looking out for\r\nimposture.[55] In any case there was, in certain quarters, a public\r\nsentiment against the conviction of witches, a sentiment that made\r\nitself felt. This we shall have occasion to note again in following out\r\nthe currents and fluctuations of opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Of course the proof that some of the accused really made pretensions\r\nto magic rests upon their own confessions and their accusations of one\r\nanother, and might be a part of an intricate tissue of falsehood. But,\r\ngranting for the moment the absolute untrustworthiness of the\r\nconfessions and accusations there are incidental statements which imply\r\nthe practice of magic. For example, Elizabeth Device's young daughter\r\nquoted a long charm which she said her mother had taught her and which\r\nshe hardly invented on the spur of the moment. And Demdike was requested\r\nto \"amend a sick cow.\"\r\n\r\n[2] The gunpowder plot, seven years earlier, no doubt gave direction to\r\nthis plan, or, perhaps it would be better to say, gave the idea to those\r\nwho confessed the plan.\r\n\r\n[3] James Crossley seems to believe that there was \"some scintilla of\r\ntruth\" behind the story. See his edition of Potts, notes, p. 40.\r\n\r\n[4] Among those who never confessed seems to have been Chattox's\r\ndaughter, Anne Redfearne.\r\n\r\n[5] See above, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[6] It is a satisfaction to know that Alice died \"impenitent,\" and that\r\nnot even her children could \"move her to confesse.\"\r\n\r\n[7] See above, pp. 112-113, and Potts, Q-Q verso.\r\n\r\n[8] See Potts, I.\r\n\r\n[9] It can hardly be doubted that the children had been thoroughly\r\nprimed with the stories in circulation against their mother.\r\n\r\n[10] Other witnesses charged her with \"many strange practises.\"\r\n\r\n[11] The principle that a man's life may not twice be put in jeopardy\r\nfor the same offence had been pretty well established before 1612. See\r\nDarly's Case, 25 Eliz. (1583), Coke's _Reports_ (ed. Thomas and Fraser,\r\nLondon, 1826), IV, f. 40; Vaux's Case, 33 Eliz. (1591), _ibid._, f. 45;\r\nWrote _vs._ Wiggs, 33 Eliz. (1591), _ibid._, f. 47. This principle had\r\nbeen in process of development for several centuries. See Bracton (ed.\r\nSir Travers Twiss, London, 1878-1883), II, 417, 433, 437; Britton (ed.\r\nF. M. Nichols, Oxford, 1865), bk. I, cap. xxiv, 5, f. 44 b.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted, however, that the statute of 3 Hen. VII, cap. II,\r\nprovides that indictments shall be proceeded in, immediately, at the\r\nking's suit, for the death of a man, without waiting for bringing an\r\nappeal; and that the plea of _antefort acquit_ in an indictment shall be\r\nno bar to the prosecuting of an appeal. This law was passed to get\r\naround special legal inconvenience and related only to homicide and to\r\nthe single case of prosecution by appeal. In general, then, we may say\r\nthat the former-jeopardy doctrine was part of the common law, (1) an\r\nappeal of felony being a bar to subsequent appeal or indictment, (2) an\r\nindictment a bar to a subsequent indictment, and (3) an indictment to a\r\nsubsequent appeal, except so far as the statute of 3 Hen. VII., cap. II,\r\nchanged the law as respects homicides. For this brief statement I am\r\nindebted to Professor William Underhill Moore of the University of\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\nWhat Potts has to say about Anne Redfearne's case hardly enables us to\r\nreach a conclusion about the legal aspect of it.\r\n\r\n[12] This is the story in the MS. account (Brit. Mus., Sloane, 972). The\r\nprinted narrative of the origin of the affair is somewhat different.\r\nJoan had on one occasion been struck by Mistress Belcher for unbecoming\r\nbehavior and had cherished a grudge. No doubt this was a point recalled\r\nagainst Joan after suspicion had been directed against her.\r\n\r\n[13] In John Cotta's _The Triall of Witchcraft ..._ (London, 1616),\r\n66-67, there is a very interesting statement which probably refers to\r\nthis case. Cotta, it will be remembered, was a physician at Northampton.\r\nHe wrote: \"There is a very rare, but true, description of a Gentlewoman,\r\nabout sixe yeares past, cured of divers kinds of convulsions, ... After\r\nshe was almost cured, ... but the cure not fully accomplished, it was by\r\na reputed Wisard whispered ... that the Gentlewoman was meerely\r\nbewitched, supposed Witches were accused and after executed.... In this\r\nlast past seventh yeare ... fits are critically again returned.\" Cotta\r\nsays six years ago and the Northampton trials were in 1612, four years\r\nbefore. It is quite possible, however, that Mistress Belcher began to be\r\nafflicted in 1610.\r\n\r\n[14] One of these was Sir Gilbert Pickering of Tichmarsh, almost\r\ncertainly the Gilbert Pickering mentioned as an uncle of the\r\nThrockmorton children at Warboys. See above, pp. 47-48. His hatred of\r\nwitches had no doubt been increased by that affair.\r\n\r\n[15] See what is said of spectral evidence in chapter V, above.\r\n\r\n[16] At least there is no evidence that Alice Abbott, Catherine\r\nGardiner, and Alice Harris, whom he accused, were punished in any way.\r\n\r\n[17] It seems, however, that Arthur Bill, while he sturdily denied\r\nguilt, had been before trapped into some sort of an admission. He had\r\n\"unawares confest that he had certaine spirits at command.\" But this may\r\nmean nothing more than that something he had said had been grossly\r\nmisinterpreted.\r\n\r\n[18] Three women of Leicestershire, Anne Baker, Joan Willimot, and Ellen\r\nGreene, who in their confessions implicated the Flowers (they belonged\r\nto parishes neighbor to that of Belvoir, which lies on the shire border)\r\nand whose testimony against them figured in their trials, were at the\r\nsame time (Feb.-March, 1618/19) under examination in that county.\r\nWhether these women were authors or victims of the Belvoir suspicions we\r\ndo not know. As we have their damning confessions, there is small doubt\r\nas to their fate.\r\n\r\n[19] The women were tried in March, 1618/19. Henry, the elder son of the\r\nearl, was buried at Bottesford, September 26, 1613. John Nichols,\r\n_History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester_ (London,\r\n1795-1815), II, pt. i, 49, note 10. Francis, the second, lingered till\r\nearly in 1620. His sister, Lady Katherine, whose delicate health had\r\nalso been ascribed to the witches, was now the heiress, and became in\r\nthat year the bride of Buckingham, the king's favorite. There is one\r\naspect of this affair that must not be overlooked. The accusation\r\nagainst the Flowers cannot have been unknown to the king, who was a\r\nfrequent visitor at the seat of the Rutlands. It is hard to believe that\r\nunder such circumstances the use of torture, which James had declared\r\nessential to bring out the guilt of the accused witches, was not after\r\nsome fashion resorted to. The weird and uncanny confessions go far\r\ntowards supporting such an hypothesis.\r\n\r\n[20] _The Most Cruell and Bloody Murther committed by ... Annis Dell,\r\n... with the severall Witch-crafts ... of one Johane Harrison and her\r\nDaughter_, 63.\r\n\r\n[21] This story must be accepted with hesitation; see below, appendix A,\r\n§3.\r\n\r\n[22] See above, pp. 110-111.\r\n\r\n[23] The trial of Elizabeth Sawyer at Edmonton in 1621 had to do with\r\nsimilar trivialities. Agnes Ratcliffe was washing one day, when a sow\r\nbelonging to Elizabeth licked up a bit of her washing soap. She struck\r\nit with a \"washing beetle.\" Of course she fell sick, and on her\r\ndeath-bed accused Mistress Elizabeth Sawyer, who was afterwards hanged.\r\n\r\n[24] See T. Tindall Wildridge, in William Andrews, _Bygone Derbyshire_\r\n(Derby, 1892), 180-184. It has been impossible to locate the sources of\r\nthis story. J. Charles Cox, who explored the Derby records, seems never\r\nto have discovered anything about the affair.\r\n\r\n[25] See F. Legge, \"Witchcraft in Scotland,\" in the _Scottish Review_,\r\nXVIII, 264.\r\n\r\n[26] See above, ch. IV, especially note 36.\r\n\r\n[27] On Mary Glover see also appendix A, § 2. On other impostures see\r\nThomas Fuller, _Church History of Britain_ (London, 1655; Oxford, ed. J.\r\nS. Brewer, 1845), ed. of 1845, V, 450; letters given by Edmund Lodge,\r\n_Illustrations of British History, Biography and Manners ..._ (London,\r\n1791), III, 275, 284, 287-288; also _King James, His Apothegms, by B.\r\nA., Gent._ (London, 1643), 8-10.\r\n\r\n[28] _Cal.

Our principal authority, however, is in\r\ntwo letters written by Robert Heyrick of Leicester to his brother\r\nWilliam in 1616, which are to be found in John Nichols, _History and\r\nAntiquities of the County of Leicester_ (London, 1795-1815), II, pt. ii,\r\n471, and in the _Annual Register_ for 1800. See also William Kelly,\r\n_Royal Progresses to Leicester_ (Leicester, 1884), 367-369. Probably\r\nthis is the case referred to by Francis Osborne, where the boy was sent\r\nto the Archbishop of Canterbury for further examination. Osborne, who\r\nwrote a good deal later than the events, apparently confused the story\r\nof the Leicester witches with that of the Boy of Bilston--their origins\r\nwere similar--and produced a strange account; see his _Miscellany of\r\nSundry Essays, Paradoxes and Problematicall Discourses_ (London,\r\n1658-1659), 6-9.\r\n\r\n[36] For the disgrace of the judges see _Cal. St. P., Dom., 1611-1618_,\r\n398.\r\n\r\n[37] Webster knew Bishop Morton, and also his secretary, Baddeley, who\r\nhad been notary in the case and had written an account of it. See John\r\nWebster, _The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft_ (London, 1677), 275.\r\n\r\n[38] The Catholics declared that the Puritans tried \"syllabub\" upon him.\r\nThis was perhaps a sarcastic reference to their attempts to cure him by\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n[39] Then of Lichfield.\r\n\r\n[40] Baddeley, who was Bishop Morton's secretary and who prepared the\r\nnarrative of the affair for the printer, says that the woman was freed\r\nby the inquest; Ryc. Baddeley, _The Boy of Bilson ..._ (London, 1622),\r\n61. Arthur Wilson, who tells us that he heard the story \"from the\r\nBishop's own mouth almost thirty years before it was inserted here,\"\r\nsays that the woman was found guilty and condemned to die; Arthur\r\nWilson, _Life and Reign of James I_ (London, 1653), 107. It is evident\r\nthat Baddeley's story is the more trustworthy. It is of course possible,\r\nalthough not probable, that there were two trials, and that Baddeley\r\nignored the second one, the outcome of which would have been less\r\ncreditable to the bishop.\r\n\r\n[41] Webster, _Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft_, 275.\r\n\r\n[42] See Fairfax, _A Discourse of Witchcraft_ (Philobiblon Soc.): \"and\r\nthose whose impostures our wise King so lately laid open.\" See also an\r\ninteresting letter from James himself in J. O. Halliwell, _Letters of\r\nthe Kings of England_ (London, 1846), II, 124-125.\r\n\r\n[43] Fuller, _Church History of Britain_, V, 452 (ch. X, sect. 4). It is\r\nworthy of note that Peter Heylyn, who, in his _Examen Historicum_\r\n(London, 1659), sought to pick Fuller to pieces, does not mention this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n[44] See Francis Osborne, _Miscellany_, 4-9. Lucy Aikin, _Memoirs of the\r\nCourt of King James the First_ (London, 1823), II, 398-399, gives about\r\nthe same story as Fuller and Osborne, and, while the wording is slightly\r\ndifferent, it is probable that they were her sources.\r\n\r\n[45] Arthur Wilson, _op. cit._, 111, tells us: \"The King took delight by\r\nthe line of his reason to sound the depth of such brutish impostors, and\r\nhe discovered many.\" A writer to the _Gentleman's Magazine_ (LIV, pt. I,\r\n246-247), in 1784, says that he has somewhere read that King James on\r\nhis death-bed acknowledged that he had been deceived in his opinion\r\nrespecting witchcraft and expressed his concern that so many innocent\r\npersons had suffered on that account. But, as he has forgotten where he\r\nread it, his evidence is of course of small value.\r\n\r\n[46] The college where an annual sermon was preached on the subject of\r\nwitchcraft since the Warboys affair.\r\n\r\n[47] Osborne's statement should perhaps be discounted a little on\r\naccount of his skepticism. On the other hand he was not such an admirer\r\nof James I as to have given him undue credit. Fuller's opinion was\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\n[48] James still believed in witchcraft in 1613, when the malodorous\r\ndivorce trial of Lady Essex took place. A careful reading of his words\r\nat that time, however, leaves the impression that he was not nearly so\r\ncertain about the possibilities of witchcraft as he had been when he\r\nwrote his book. His position was clearly defensive. It must be\r\nremembered that James in 1613 had a point to be gained and would not\r\nhave allowed a possible doubt as to witchcraft to interfere with his\r\nwish for the divorce. See Howell, _State Trials_, II, 806.\r\n\r\n[49] One of them was publicly searched by command of a justice. See\r\nFairfax, _op. cit._, 138-139.\r\n\r\n[50] _Ibid._, 205. Two of the women had gone home before, _ibid._, 180.\r\n\r\n[51] _Ibid._, 225-234.\r\n\r\n[52] _Ibid._, 234.\r\n\r\n[53] _Ibid._, 237-238. If the women were tried twice, it seems a clear\r\nviolation of the principle of former jeopardy. See above, note 11. The\r\nstatute of 3 Hen. VII, cap. I, that the plea of _antefort acquit_ was no\r\nbar to the prosecution of an appeal, would not apply in this instance,\r\nas that statute was limited to cases of _homicide_.\r\n\r\n[54] Fairfax was moreover a man for whom the king had a high personal\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n[55] At the August assizes there had been an effort to show that the\r\nchildren were \"counterfeiting.\" See the _Discourse_, 235-237.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE LANCASHIRE WITCHES AND CHARLES I.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his attitude towards superstition, Charles I resembled the later\r\nrather than the earlier James I. No reign up to the Revolution was\r\nmarked by so few executions. It was a time of comparative quiet. Here\r\nand there isolated murmurs against suspected creatures of the Devil\r\nroused the justices of the peace to write letters, and even to make\r\ninquiries that as often as not resulted in indefinite commitments, or\r\nbrought out the protests of neighbors in favor of the accused. But, if\r\nthere were not many cases, they represented a wide area. Middlesex,\r\nWilts, Somerset, Leicestershire, Staffordshire, Lancashire, Durham,\r\nYorkshire, and Northumberland were among the counties infested. Yet we\r\ncan count but six executions, and only four of them rest upon secure\r\nevidence.[1] This is of course to reckon the reign of Charles as not\r\nextending beyond 1642, when the Civil War broke out and the Puritan\r\nleaders assumed responsibility for the government.\r\n\r\nUp to that time there was but one really notable witch alarm in England.\r\nBut it was one that illustrated again, as in Essex, the continuity of\r\nthe superstition in a given locality. The Lancashire witches of 1633\r\nwere the direct outcome of the Lancashire witches of 1612. The story is\r\na weird one. An eleven-year-old boy played truant one day to his\r\ncattle-herding, and, as he afterwards told the story, went\r\nplum-gathering. When he came back he had to find a plausible excuse to\r\npresent to his parents. Now, the lad had been brought up in the\r\nBlackburn forest, close to Pendle Hill; he had overheard stories of\r\nMalking Tower[2] from the chatter of gossipping women;[3] he had\r\nshivered as suspected women were pointed out to him; he knew the names\r\nof some of them. His imagination, in search for an excuse, caught at the\r\nwitch motive[4] and elaborated it with the easy invention of youth.[5]\r\nHe had seen two greyhounds come running towards him. They looked like\r\nthose owned by two of his neighbors. When he saw that no one was\r\nfollowing them, he set out to hunt with them, and presently a hare rose\r\nvery near before him, at the sight whereof he cried \"Loo, Loo,\" but the\r\ndogs would not run. Being very angry, he tied them to a little bush in\r\nthe hedge and beat them, and at once, instead of the black greyhound,\r\n\"one Dickonson's wife\" stood up, and instead of the brown greyhound \"a\r\nlittle boy whom this informer knoweth not.\" He started to run away, but\r\nthe woman stayed him and offered him a piece of silver \"much like to a\r\nfaire shillinge\" if he would not betray her. The conscientious boy\r\nanswered \"Nay, thou art a witch,\" \"whereupon shee put her hand into her\r\npocket againe and pulled out a stringe like unto a bridle that gingled,\r\nwhich shee put upon the litle boyes heade that stood up in the browne\r\ngreyhounds steade, whereupon the said boy stood up a white horse.\" In\r\ntrue Arabian Nights fashion they mounted and rode away. They came to a\r\nnew house called Hoarstones, where there were three score or more\r\npeople, and horses of several colors, and a fire with meat roasting.\r\nThey had flesh and bread upon a trencher and they drank from glasses.\r\nAfter the first taste the boy \"refused and would have noe more, and said\r\nit was nought.\" There were other refreshments at the feast. The boy was,\r\nas he afterwards confessed, familiar with the story of the feast at\r\nMalking Tower.[6]\r\n\r\nThe names of those present he did not volunteer at first; but, on being\r\nquestioned, he named eighteen[7] whom he had seen. The boy confessed\r\nthat he had been clever enough to make most of his list from those who\r\nwere already suspected by their neighbors.\r\n\r\nIt needed but a match to set off the flame of witch-hatred in\r\nLancashire. The boy's story was quite sufficient. Whether his narrative\r\nwas a spontaneous invention of his own, concocted in emergency, as he\r\nasserted in his confession at London, or whether it was a carefully\r\nconstructed lie taught him by his father in order to revenge himself\r\nupon some hated neighbors, and perhaps to exact blackmail, as some of\r\nthe accused later charged, we shall never know. In later life the boy is\r\nsaid to have admitted that he had been set on by his father,[8] but the\r\nnarrative possesses certain earmarks of a story struck out by a child's\r\nimagination.[9] It is easy enough to reconcile the two theories by\r\nsupposing that the boy started the story of his own initiative and that\r\nhis father was too shrewd not to realize the opportunity to make a\r\nsensation and perhaps some money. He took the boy before justices of the\r\npeace, who, with the zeal their predecessors had displayed twenty-two\r\nyears before, made many arrests.[10] The boy was exhibited from town to\r\ntown in Lancashire as a great wonder and witch-detector. It was in the\r\ncourse of these exhibitions that he was brought to a little town on the\r\nLancashire border of Yorkshire and was taken to the afternoon church\r\nservice, where a young minister, who was long afterwards to become a\r\nfamous opponent of the superstition, was discoursing to his\r\ncongregation. The boy was held up by those in charge as if to give him\r\nthe chance to detect witches among the audience. The minister saw him,\r\nand at the end of the service at once came down to the boy, and without\r\nparley asked him, \"Good boy, tell me truly, and in earnest, didst thou\r\nsee and hear such things of the meeting of the witches as is reported by\r\nmany that thou dost relate?\" The boy, as Webster has told the story, was\r\nnot given time for reply by the men in charge of him, who protested\r\nagainst such questions. The lad, they said, had been before two justices\r\nof the peace, and had not been catechized in that fashion.[11]\r\n\r\nA lone skeptic had little chance to beat back the wave of excitement\r\ncreated by the young Robinson's stories. His success prompted him to\r\nconcoct new tales.[12] He had seen Lloynd's wife sitting on a cross-bar\r\nin his father's chimney; he had called to her; she had not come down but\r\nhad vanished in the air. Other accounts the boy gave, but none of them\r\nrevealed the clear invention of his first narrative.\r\n\r\nHe had done his work. The justices of the peace were bringing in the\r\naccused to the assizes at Lancaster. There Robinson was once more called\r\nupon to render his now famous testimony. He was supported by his\r\nfather,[13] who gave evidence that on the day he had sent his boy for\r\nthe cattle he had gone after him and as he approached had heard him cry\r\nand had found him quite \"distracted.\" When the boy recovered himself, he\r\nhad related the story already told. This was the evidence of the father,\r\nand together with that of the son it constituted the most telling piece\r\nof testimony presented. But it served, as was usual in such cases, as an\r\nopening for all those who, for any reason, thought they had grounds of\r\nsuspicion against any of their neighbors. It was recalled by one witness\r\nthat a neighbor girl could bewitch a pail and make it roll towards her.\r\nWe shall later have occasion to note the basis of fact behind this\r\ncurious accusation. There was other testimony of an equally damaging\r\ncharacter. But in nearly all the cases stress was laid upon the bodily\r\nmarks. In one instance, indeed, nothing else was charged.[14] The reader\r\nwill remember that in the Lancaster cases of 1612 the evidence of marks\r\non the body was notably absent, so notably that we were led to suspect\r\nthat it had been ruled out by the judge. That such evidence was now\r\nreckoned important is proof that this particularly dark feature of the\r\nwitch superstition was receiving increasing emphasis.\r\n\r\nHow many in all were accused we do not know. Webster, writing later,\r\nsaid that seventeen were found guilty.[15] It is possible that even a\r\nlarger number were acquitted. Certainly some were acquitted. A\r\ndistinction of some sort was made in the evidence. This makes it all the\r\nharder to understand why the truth of Robinson's stories was not tested\r\nin the same way in which those of Grace Sowerbutts had been tested in\r\n1612. Did that detection of fraud never occur to the judges, or had they\r\nnever heard of the famous boy at Bilston? Perhaps not they but the\r\njuries were to blame, for it seems that the court was not altogether\r\nsatisfied with the jury's verdict and delayed sentence. Perhaps, indeed,\r\nthe judges wrote to London about the matter. Be that as it may, the\r\nprivy council decided to take cognizance of an affair that was already\r\nthe talk of the realm.[16] Secretaries Coke and Windebank sent\r\ninstructions to Henry Bridgeman, Bishop of Chester and successor to that\r\nMorton who had exposed the boy of Bilston, to examine seven of the\r\ncondemned witches and to make a report.[17] Bridgeman doubtless knew of\r\nhis predecessor's success in exposing fraudulent accusations. Before the\r\nbishop was ready to report, His Majesty sent orders that three or four\r\nof the accused should be brought up to London by a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus. Owing to a neglect to insert definite names, there was a\r\ndelay.[18] It was during this interval, probably, that Bishop Bridgeman\r\nwas able to make his examination. He found three of the seven already\r\ndead and one hopelessly ill. The other three he questioned with great\r\ncare. Two of them, Mary Spencer, a girl of twenty, and Frances\r\nDickonson, the first whom Robinson had accused, made spirited denials.\r\nMary Spencer avowed that her accusers had been actuated by malice\r\nagainst her and her parents for several years. At the trial, she had\r\nbeen unable, she said, to answer for herself, because the noise of the\r\ncrowd had been so great as to prevent her from hearing the evidence\r\nagainst her. As for the charge of bewitching a pail so that it came\r\nrunning towards her of its own accord, she declared that she used as a\r\nchild to roll a pail down-hill and to call it after her as she ran, a\r\nperfectly natural piece of child's play. Frances Dickonson, too, charged\r\nmalice upon her accusers, especially upon the father of Edmund Robinson.\r\nHer husband, she said, had been unwilling to sell him a cow without\r\nsurety and had so gained his ill-will. She went on to assert that the\r\nelder Robinson had volunteered to withdraw the charges against her if\r\nher husband would pay him forty shillings. This counter charge was\r\nsupported by another witness and seemed to make a good deal of an\r\nimpression on the ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\nThe third woman to be examined by the bishop was a widow of sixty, who\r\nhad not been numbered among the original seventeen witches. She\r\nacknowledged that she was a witch, but was, wrote the bishop, \"more\r\noften faulting in the particulars of her actions as one having a strong\r\nimagination of the former, but of too weak a memory to retain or relate\r\nthe latter.\" The woman told a commonplace story of a man in black attire\r\nwho had come to her six years before and made the usual contract. But\r\nvery curiously she could name only one other witch, and professed to\r\nknow none of those already in gaol.\r\n\r\nSuch were the results of the examinations sent in by the bishop. In the\r\nletter which he sent along, he expressed doubt about the whole matter.\r\n\"Conceit and malice,\" he wrote, \"are so powerful with many in those\r\nparts that they will easily afford an oath to work revenge upon their\r\nneighbour.\" He would, he intimated, have gone further in examining the\r\ncounter charges brought by the accused, had it not been that he\r\nhesitated to proceed against the king, that is, the prosecution.\r\n\r\nThis report doubtless confirmed the fears of the government. The writs\r\nto the sheriff of Lancaster were redirected, and four of the women were\r\nbrought up to London and carried to the \"Ship Tavern\" at Greenwich,\r\nclose to one of the royal residences.[19] Two of His Majesty's surgeons,\r\nAlexander Baker and Sir William Knowles, the latter of whom was\r\naccustomed to examine candidates for the king's touch, together with\r\nfive other surgeons and ten certificated midwives, were now ordered to\r\nmake a bodily examination of the women, under the direction of the\r\neminent Harvey,[20] the king's physician, who was later to discover the\r\ncirculation of the blood. In the course of this chapter we shall see\r\nthat Harvey had long cherished misgivings about witchcraft. Probably by\r\nthis time he had come to disbelieve it. One can but wonder if Charles,\r\nalready probably aware of Harvey's views, had not intended from his\r\nfirst step in the Lancashire case to give his physician a chance to\r\nassert his opinion. In any case his report and that of his subordinates\r\nwas entirely in favor of the women, except that in the case of Margaret\r\nJohnson (who had confessed) they had found a mark, but one to which they\r\nattached little significance.[21] The women seem to have been carried\r\nbefore the king himself.[22] We do not know, however, that he expressed\r\nany opinion on the matter.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair has one aspect that has been entirely overlooked.\r\nWhatever the verdict of the privy council and of the king may have\r\nbeen--and it was evidently one of caution--they gave authorization from\r\nthe highest quarters for the use of the test of marks on the body. That\r\nproof of witchcraft had been long known in England and had slowly won\r\nits way into judicial procedure until now it was recognized by the\r\nhighest powers in the kingdom. To be sure, it was probably their purpose\r\nto annul the reckless convictions in Lancashire, and to break down the\r\nevidence of the female juries; but in doing so they furnished a\r\nprecedent for the witch procedure of the civil-war period.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, while the surgeons and midwives were busy over these\r\nfour women, the Robinsons, father and son, had come to London at the\r\nsummons of the privy council.[23] There the boy was separated from his\r\nfather. To a Middlesex justice of the peace appointed by Secretary\r\nWindebank to take his statements he confessed that his entire story was\r\nan invention and had no basis of fact whatever.[24] Both father and son\r\nwere imprisoned and proceedings seem to have been instituted against\r\nthem by one of the now repentant jurymen who had tried the case.[25] How\r\nlong they were kept in prison we do not know.\r\n\r\nOne would naturally suppose that the women would be released on their\r\nreturn to Lancaster, but the sheriff's records show that two years later\r\nthere were still nine witches in gaol.[26] Three of them bore the same\r\nnames as those whom Robinson pretended to have seen at Hoarstones. At\r\nleast one other of the nine had been convicted in 1634, probably more.\r\nMargaret Johnson, the single one to confess, so far as we know, was not\r\nthere. She had probably died in prison in the mean time. We have no clue\r\nas to why the women were not released. Perhaps public sentiment at home\r\nmade the sheriff unwilling to do it, perhaps the wretched creatures\r\nspent two or more years in prison--for we do not know when they got\r\nout--as a result of judicial negligence, a negligence of which there are\r\ntoo many examples in the records of the time. More likely the king and\r\nthe privy council, while doubting the charges against the women, had\r\nbeen reluctant to antagonize public sentiment by declaring them\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\nIt is disagreeable to have to state that Lancaster was not yet through\r\nwith its witches. Early in the next year the Bishop of Chester was again\r\ncalled upon by the privy council to look into the cases of four women.\r\nThere was some delay, during which a dispute took place between the\r\nbishop and the sheriff as to where the bishop should examine the\r\nwitches, whether at Wigan, as he proposed, or at Lancaster.[27] One\r\nsuspects that the civil authorities of the Duchy of Lancaster may have\r\nresented the bishop's part in the affair. When Bridgeman arrived in\r\nLancaster he found two of the women already dead. Of the other two, the\r\none, he wrote, was accused by a man formerly \"distracted and lunatic\"\r\nand by a woman who was a common beggar; the other had been long reputed\r\na witch, but he saw no reason to believe it. He had, he admitted, found\r\na small lump of flesh on her right ear.[28] Alas that the Bishop of\r\nChester, like the king and the privy council, however much he discounted\r\nthe accusations of witchcraft, had not yet wholly rid himself of one of\r\nthe darkest and most disagreeable forms of the belief that the Evil One\r\nhad bodily communication with his subjects.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the affair of 1633-1634 in northern England was singular.\r\nThe social and moral character of those accused was distinctly high. Not\r\nthat they belonged to any but the peasant class, but that they\r\nrepresented a good type of farming people. Frances Dickonson's husband\r\nevidently had some property. Mary Spencer insisted that she was\r\naccustomed to go to church and to repeat the sermon to her parents, and\r\nthat she was not afraid of death, for she hoped it would make an\r\nentrance for her into heaven. Margaret Johnson was persuaded that a man\r\nand his wife who were in the gaol on Robinson's charges were not\r\nwitches, because the man \"daily prays and reads and seems a godly man.\"\r\nWith this evidence of religious life, which must have meant something as\r\nto the status of the people in the community, should be coupled the\r\nentire absence of stories of threats at beggars and of quarrels between\r\nbad-tempered and loose-lived women, stories that fill so many dreary\r\npages of witchcraft records. Nor is there any mention of the practice of\r\npretended magic.\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters we have had occasion to observe the continuity of\r\nsuperstition in certain localities. It is obvious that Lancashire offers\r\none of the best illustrations of that principle. The connection between\r\nthe alarms of 1612 and 1633-1634 is not a matter of theory, but can be\r\nestablished by definite proof. It is perhaps not out of order to\r\ninquire, then, why Lancashire should have been so infested with\r\nwitches. It is the more necessary when we consider that there were other\r\nwitch cases in the country. Nicholas Starchie's children gave rise to\r\nthe first of the scares. It seems likely that a certain Utley was hanged\r\nat Lancaster in 1630 for bewitching a gentleman's child.[29] During\r\nCommonwealth days, as we shall find, there was an alarm at Lancaster\r\nthat probably cost two witches their lives. No county in England except\r\nEssex had a similar record. No explanation can be offered for the\r\nrecords of these two counties save that both had been early infected\r\nwith a hatred of witches, and that the witches came to be connected, in\r\ntradition, with certain localities within the counties and with certain\r\nfamilies living there. This is, indeed, an explanation that does not\r\nexplain. It all comes back to the continuity of superstition.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the widespread interest in the Lancashire\r\nwitches. There are two good illustrations of this interest. When Sir\r\nWilliam Brereton was travelling in Holland in June of 1634, a little\r\nwhile before the four women had been brought to London, he met King\r\nCharles's sister, the Queen of Bohemia, and at once, apparently, they\r\nbegan to talk about the great Lancashire discovery.[30] The other\r\ninstance of comment on the case was in England. It is one which shows\r\nthat playwrights were quite as eager then as now to be abreast of\r\ncurrent topics. Before final judgment had been given on the Lancashire\r\nwomen, Thomas Heywood and Richard Brome, well known dramatists, had\r\nwritten a play on the subject which was at once published and \"acted at\r\nthe Globe on the Bankside by His Majesty's Actors.\" By some it has been\r\nsupposed that this play was an older play founded on the Lancashire\r\naffair of 1612 and warmed over in 1634; but the main incidents and the\r\ncharacters of the play are so fully copied from the depositions of the\r\nyoung Robinson and from the charges preferred against Mary Spencer,\r\nFrances Dickonson, and Margaret Johnson, that a layman would at once\r\npronounce it a play written entirely to order from the affair of 1634.\r\nNothing unique in the stories was left out. The pail incident--of course\r\nwithout its rational explanation--was grafted into the play and put upon\r\nthe stage. Indeed, a marriage that afforded the hook upon which to hang\r\na bundle of indecencies, and the story of a virtuous husband who\r\ndiscovers his wife to be a witch, were the only added motives of\r\nimportance. For our purpose the significance of the play lies of course\r\nin its testimony to the general interest--the people of London were\r\nobviously familiar with the details, even, of the charges--and its\r\nprobable reflection of London opinion about the case. Throughout the\r\nfive acts there were those who maintained that there were no witches, a\r\nrecognition of the existence of such an opinion. Of course in the play\r\nthey were all, before the curtain fell, convinced of their error. The\r\nauthors, who no doubt catered to public sentiment, were not as earnest\r\nas the divines of their day, but they were almost as superstitious.\r\nHeywood showed himself in another work, _The Hierarchie of the Blessed\r\nAngels_,[31] a sincere believer in witchcraft and backed his belief by\r\nthe Warboys case. Probably he had read Scot, but he was not at all the\r\ntype of man to set himself against the tide. _The late Lancashire\r\nWitches_ no doubt expressed quite accurately London opinion. It was\r\nwritten, it will be remembered, before the final outcome of the case\r\ncould be foreseen. Perhaps Heywood foresaw it, more probably he was\r\nsailing close to the wind of opinion when he wrote in the epilogue,\r\n\r\n              ... \"Perhaps great mercy may,\r\n    After just condemnation, give them day\r\n    Of longer life.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy in discussing the Lancashire affair to miss a central figure.\r\nFrances Dickonson, Mary Spencer, and the others, could they have known\r\nit, owed their lives in all probability to the intellectual independence\r\nof William Harvey. There is a precious story about Harvey in an old\r\nmanuscript letter by an unknown writer, that, if trustworthy, throws a\r\nlight on the physician's conduct in the case. The letter seems to have\r\nbeen written by a justice of the peace in southwestern England about\r\n1685.[32] He had had some experience with witches--we have mentioned\r\nthem in another connection--and he was prompted by them to tell a story\r\nof Dr. Harvey, with whom he was \"very familiarly acquainted.\" \"I once\r\nasked him what his opinion was concerning witchcraft; whether there was\r\nany such thing. Hee told mee he believed there was not.\" Asked the\r\nreasons for his doubt, Harvey told him that \"when he was at Newmercat\r\nwith the King [Charles I] he heard there was a woman who dwelt at a lone\r\nhouse on the borders of the Heath who was reputed a Witch, that he went\r\nalone to her, and found her alone at home.... Hee said shee was very\r\ndistrustful at first, but when hee told her he was a vizard, and came\r\npurposely to converse with her in their common trade, then shee easily\r\nbelieved him; for say'd hee to mee, 'You know I have a very magicall\r\nface.'\" The physician asked her where her familiar was and desired to\r\nsee him, upon which she brought out a dish of milk and made a chuckling\r\nnoise, as toads do, at which a toad came from under the chest and drank\r\nsome of the milk. Harvey now laid a plan to get rid of the woman. He\r\nsuggested that as fellow witches they ought to drink together, and that\r\nshe procure some ale. She went out to a neighboring ale-house, half a\r\nmile away, and Harvey availed himself of her absence to take up the toad\r\nand cut it open. Out came the milk. On a thorough examination he\r\nconcluded that the toad \"no ways differed from other toades,\" but that\r\nthe melancholy old woman had brought it home some evening and had tamed\r\nit by feeding and had so come to believe it a spirit and her familiar.\r\nWhen the woman returned and found her \"familiar\" cut in pieces, she\r\n\"flew like a Tigris\" at his face. The physician offered her money and\r\ntried to persuade her that her familiar was nothing more than a toad.\r\nWhen he found that this did not pacify her he took another tack and told\r\nher that he was the king's physician, sent to discover if she were a\r\nwitch, and, in case she were, to have her apprehended. With this\r\nexplanation, Harvey was able to get away. He related the story to the\r\nking, whose leave he had to go on the expedition. The narrator adds: \"I\r\nam certayne this for an argument against spirits or witchcraft is the\r\nbest and most experimentall I ever heard.\"\r\n\r\nWho the justice of the peace was that penned this letter, we are unable\r\neven to guess, nor do we know upon whose authority it was published. We\r\ncannot, therefore, rest upon it with absolute certainty, but we can say\r\nthat it possesses several characteristics of a _bona fide_ letter.[33]\r\nIf it is such, it gives a new clue to Harvey's conduct in 1634. We of\r\ncourse cannot be sure that the toad incident happened before that time;\r\nquite possibly it was after the interest aroused by that affair that the\r\nphysician made his investigation. At all events, here was a man who had\r\na scientific way of looking into superstition.\r\n\r\nThe advent of such a man was most significant in the history of\r\nwitchcraft, perhaps the most significant fact of its kind in the reign\r\nof Charles I. That reign, in spite of the Lancashire affair, was\r\ncharacterized by the continuance and growth of the witch skepticism,[34]\r\nso prevalent in the last years of the previous reign. Disbelief was not\r\nyet aggressive, it did not block prosecutions, but it hindered their\r\neffectiveness. The gallows was not yet done away with, but its use had\r\nbeen greatly restrained by the central government. Superstition was\r\nstill a bird of prey, but its wings were being clipped.[35]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The writer of the _Collection of Modern Relations_ (London, 1693)\r\nspeaks of an execution at Oxford, but there is nothing to substantiate\r\nit in the voluminous publications about Oxford; a Middlesex case rests\r\nalso on doubtful evidence (see appendix C, 1641).\r\n\r\n[2] _Cal. St. P., Dom._, 1634-1635, 152.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._, 141.\r\n\r\n[4] This is of course theory; _cf._ Daudet's story of his childhood in\r\n\"_Le Pape est mort_.\"\r\n\r\n[5] There seem to be five different sources for the original deposition\r\nof young Robinson. Thomas D. Whitaker, _History ... of Whalley_ (3d ed.,\r\n1818), 213, has an imperfect transcript of the deposition as given in\r\nthe Bodleian, Dodsworth MSS., 61, ff. 45-46. James Crossley in his\r\nintroduction to Potts, _Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the countie\r\nof Lancaster_ (Chetham Soc.), lix-lxxii, has copied the deposition given\r\nby Whitaker. Thomas Wright, _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_, II,\r\n112-114, has given the story from a copy of this and of other\r\ndepositions in Lord Londesborough's MSS. Webster prints a third copy,\r\n_Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft_, 347-349. A fourth is in Edward\r\nBaines, _History of the ... county ... of Lancaster_, ed. of 1836, I,\r\n604, and is taken from Brit. Mus., Harleian MSS., cod. 6854, f. 26 b. A\r\nfifth is in the Bodleian, Rawlinson MSS., D, 399, f. 211. Wright's\r\nsource we have not in detail, but the other four, while differing\r\nslightly as to punctuation, spelling, and names, agree remarkably well\r\nas to the details of the story.\r\n\r\n[6] _Cal. St. P., Dom._, 1634-1635, 152.\r\n\r\n[7] John Stearne, _A Confirmation and Discovery of Witchcraft ...\r\ntogether with the Confessions of many of those executed since May 1645_\r\n(London, 1648), 11, says that in Lancashire \"nineteene assembled.\"\r\nRobinson's deposition as printed by Webster, _Displaying of Supposed\r\nWitchcraft_, gives nineteen names.\r\n\r\n[8] Webster, _op. cit._, 277.\r\n\r\n[9] The boy, in his first examinations at London, said he had made up\r\nthe story himself.\r\n\r\n[10] It is a curious thing that one of the justices of the peace was\r\nJohn Starchie, who had been one of the bewitched boys of the Starchie\r\nfamily at Cleworth in 1597. See above, ch. IV. See Baines, _Lancaster_,\r\ned. of 1868-1870, I, 204.\r\n\r\n[11] This incident is related by Webster, _op. cit._, 276-278. Webster\r\ntells us that the boy was yet living when he wrote, and that he himself\r\nhad heard the whole story from his mouth more than once. He appends to\r\nhis volume the original deposition of the lad (at Padiham, February 10\r\n1633/4).\r\n\r\n[12] These are given in the same deposition, but the deposition probably\r\nrepresents the boy's statement at the assizes.\r\n\r\n[13] The father had been a witness at the Lancashire trials in 1612. See\r\nBaines, _Lancaster_, ed. of 1868-1870, I, 204-205.\r\n\r\n[14] That is, of course, so far as we have evidence. It is a little\r\ndangerous to hold to absolute negatives.\r\n\r\n[15] Webster, _op. cit._, 277. Pelham on May 16, 1634, wrote: \"It is\r\nsaid that 19 are condemned and ... 60 already discovered.\" _Cal. St. P.,\r\nDom._, 1634-1635, 26.\r\n\r\n[16] It had been reported in London that witches had raised a storm from\r\nwhich Charles had suffered at sea.

He did so,\r\nand the bishop wrote thanking him and abusing \"certain apparitors who go\r\nabout frightening the people.\" See _Hist. MSS. Comm. Reports_, II, app.,\r\np. 48. For a case of the acquittal of a witch and the exposure of the\r\npretended convulsions of her accuser, see _Cal. St. P., Dom., 1635_,\r\n477. For example of suits for slander see North Riding Rec. Soc, IV,\r\n182, session July 9, 1640.\r\n\r\n[35] A solitary pamphlet of this period must be mentioned. It was\r\nentitled: _Fearefull Newes from Coventry, or A true Relation and\r\nLamentable Story of one Thomas Holt of Coventry a Musitian who through\r\nCovetousnesse and immoderate love of money, sold himselfe to the Devill,\r\nwith whom he had made a contract for certaine yeares--And also of his\r\nLamentable end and death, on the 16 day of February 1641_ (London,\r\n1642). The \"sad subject of this little treatise\" was a musician with\r\nnineteen children. Fearing that he would not be able to provide for\r\nthem, he is alleged to have made a contract with the Devil, who finally\r\nbroke his neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW HOPKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the annals of English witchcraft Matthew Hopkins occupies a place by\r\nhimself. For more than two years he was the arch-instigator in\r\nprosecutions which, at least in the numbers of those executed, mark the\r\nhigh tide of the delusion. His name was one hardly known by his\r\ncontemporaries, but he has since become a figure in the annals of\r\nEnglish roguery. Very recently his life has found record among those of\r\n\"Twelve Bad Men.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWhat we know of him up to the time of his first appearance in his\r\nsuccessful rôle about March of 1644/5 is soon told. He was the son of\r\nJames Hopkins, minister of Wenham[2] in Suffolk. He was \"a lawyer of but\r\nlittle note\" at Ipswich, thence removing to Manningtree. Whether he may\r\nhave been the Matthew Hopkins of Southwark who complained in 1644 of\r\ninability to pay the taxes[3] is more than doubtful, but there is reason\r\nenough to believe that he found the law no very remunerative profession.\r\nHe was ready for some new venture and an accidental circumstance in\r\nManningtree turned him into a wholly new field of endeavor. He assumed\r\nthe rôle of a witchfinder and is said to have taken the title of\r\nwitchfinder-general.[4]\r\n\r\nHe had made little or no preparation for the work that now came to his\r\nhand. King James's famous _Dæmonologie_ he was familiar with, but he may\r\nhave studied it after his first experiences at Manningtree. It seems\r\nsomewhat probable, too, that he had read, and indeed been much\r\ninfluenced by, the account of the Lancashire witches of 1612, as well as\r\nby Richard Bernard's _Advice to Grand Jurymen_. But, if he read the\r\nlatter book, he seems altogether to have misinterpreted it. As to his\r\ngeneral information and education, we have no data save the hints to be\r\ngained from his own writings. His letter to John Gaule and the little\r\nbrochure which he penned in self-defence reveal a man able to express\r\nhimself with some clearness and with a great deal of vigor. There were\r\nforce of character and nervous energy behind his defiant words. It is no\r\nexaggeration, as we shall see in following his career, to say that the\r\nwitch crusader was a man of action, who might in another field have made\r\nhis mark.\r\n\r\nTo know something of his religious proclivities would be extremely\r\ninteresting. On this point, however, he gives us no clue. But his fellow\r\nworker, John Stearne, was clearly a Puritan[5] and Hopkins was surely of\r\nthe same faith. It can hardly be proved, however, that religious zeal\r\nprompted him in his campaign. For a time of spiritual earnestness his\r\nutterances seem rather lukewarm.\r\n\r\nIt was in his own town that his attention was first directed towards the\r\ndangers of witchcraft. The witches, he tells us, were accustomed to hold\r\ntheir meetings near his house. During one of their assemblies he\r\noverheard a witch bid her imps to go to another witch. The other witch,\r\nwhose name was thus revealed to him--Elizabeth Clarke, a poor one-legged\r\ncreature--was promptly taken into custody on Hopkins's charge.[6] Other\r\naccusations poured in. John Rivet had consulted a cunning woman about\r\nthe illness of his wife, and had learned that two neighbors were\r\nresponsible. One of these, he was told, dwelt a little above his own\r\nhome; \"whereupon he beleeved his said wife was bewitched by ...\r\nElizabeth Clarke, ... for that the said Elizabeth's mother and some\r\nother of her kinsfolke did suffer death for witchcraft.\" The justices\r\nof the peace[7] accordingly had her \"searched by women who had for many\r\nyeares known the Devill's marks,\" and, when these were found on her,\r\nthey bade her custodians \"keep her from sleep two or three nights,\r\nexpecting in that time to see her familiars.\"[8]\r\n\r\nTorture is unknown to English law; but, in our day of the \"third\r\ndegree,\" nobody needs to be told that what is put out at the door may\r\nsteal in at the window. It may be that, in the seventeenth century, the\r\npious English justices had no suspicion that enforced sleeplessness is a\r\nform of physical torture more nerve-racking and irresistible than the\r\nthumb-screw. Three days and nights of \"watching\" brought Elizabeth\r\nClarke to \"confess many things\"; and when, on the fourth night, her\r\ntownsmen Hopkins and Stearne dropped in to fill out from her own lips\r\nthe warrants against those she had named as accomplices, she told them\r\nthat, if they would stay and do her no hurt, she would call one of her\r\nimps.\r\n\r\nHopkins told her that he would not allow it, but he stayed. Within a\r\nquarter of an hour the imps appeared, six of them, one after another.\r\nThe first was a \"white thing in the likeness of a Cat, but not\r\naltogether so big,\" the second a white dog with some sandy spots and\r\nvery short legs, the third, Vinegar Tom, was a greyhound with long legs.\r\nWe need not go further into the story. The court records give the\r\ntestimony of Hopkins and Stearne. Both have related the affair in their\r\npamphlets.[9] Six others, four of whom were women, made oath to the\r\nappearances of the imps. In this respect the trial is unique among all\r\nin English history. Eight people testified that they had seen the\r\nimps.[10] Two of them referred elsewhere to what they had seen, and\r\ntheir accounts agreed substantially.[11] It may be doubted if the\r\nsupporting evidence offered at any trial in the seventeenth century in\r\nEngland went so far towards establishing the actual appearance of the\r\nso-called imps of the witches.\r\n\r\nHow are we to account for these phenomena? What was the nature of the\r\ndelusion seemingly shared by eight people? It is for the psychologist to\r\nanswer. Two explanations occur to the layman. It is not inconceivable\r\nthat there were rodents in the gaol--the terrible conditions in the\r\ngaols of the time are too well known to need description--and that the\r\ncreatures running about in the dark were easily mistaken by excited\r\npeople for something more than natural. It is possible, too, that all\r\nthe appearances were the fabric of imagination or invention. The\r\nspectators were all in a state of high expectation of supernatural\r\nappearances. What the over-alert leaders declared they had seen the\r\nothers would be sure to have seen. Whether those leaders were themselves\r\ndeceived, or easily duped the others by calling out the description of\r\nwhat they claimed to see, would be hard to guess. To the writer the\r\nlatter theory seems less plausible. The accounts of the two are so\r\nclearly independent and yet agree so well in fact that they seem to\r\nweaken the case for collusive imposture. With that a layman may be\r\npermitted to leave the matter. What hypnotic possibilities are inherent\r\nin the story he cannot profess to know. Certainly the accused woman was\r\nnot a professed dealer in magic and it is not easy to suspect her of\r\nhaving hypnotized the watchers.\r\n\r\nUpon Elizabeth Clarke's confessions five other women--\"the old beldam\"\r\nAnne West, who had \"been suspected as a witch many yeers since, and\r\nsuffered imprisonment for the same,\"[12] her daughter Rebecca,[13] Anne\r\nLeech, her daughter Helen Clarke, and Elizabeth Gooding--were arrested.\r\nAs in the case of the first, there was soon abundance of evidence\r\noffered about them. One Richard Edwards bethought himself and remembered\r\nthat while crossing a bridge he had heard a cry, \"much like the shrieke\r\nof a Polcat,\" and had been nearly thrown from his horse. He had also\r\nlost some cattle by a mysterious disease. Moreover his child had been\r\nnursed by a goodwife who lived near to Elizabeth Clarke and Elizabeth\r\nGooding. The child fell sick, \"rowling the eyes,\" and died. He believed\r\nthat Anne Leech and Elizabeth Gooding were the cause of its death. His\r\nbelief, however, which was offered as an independent piece of\r\ntestimony, seems to have rested on Anne Leech's confession, which had\r\nbeen made before this time and was soon given to the justices of the\r\npeace. Robert Taylor charged Elizabeth Gooding with the death of his\r\nhorse, but he too had the suggestion from other witnesses. Prudence Hart\r\ndeclared that, being in her bed in the night, \"something fell down on\r\nher right side.\" \"Being dark she cannot tell in what shape it was, but\r\nshe believeth Rebecca West and Anne West the cause of her pains.\"\r\n\r\nBut the accusers could hardly outdo the accused. No sooner was a crime\r\nsuggested than they took it upon themselves. It seemed as if the witches\r\nwere running a race for position as high criminal. With the exception of\r\nElizabeth Gooding, who stuck to it that she was not guilty, they\r\ncheerfully confessed that they had lamed their victims, caused them to\r\n\"languish,\" and even killed them. The meetings at Elizabeth Clarke's\r\nhouse were recalled. Anne Leech remembered that there was a book read\r\n\"wherein shee thinks there was no goodnesse.\"[14]\r\n\r\nSo the web of charges and counter-charges was spun until twenty-three or\r\nmore women were caught in its meshes. No less than twelve of them\r\nconfessed to a share in the most revolting crimes. But there was one\r\nwho, in court, retracted her confession.[15] At least five utterly\r\ndenied their guilt. Among them was a poor woman who had aroused\r\nsuspicion chiefly because a young hare had been seen in front of her\r\nhouse. She was ready to admit that she had seen the hare, but denied\r\nall the more serious charges.[16] Another of those who would not plead\r\nguilty sought to ward off charges against herself by adding to the\r\ncharges accumulated against her mother. Hers was a damning accusation.\r\nHer mother had threatened her and the next night she \"felt something\r\ncome into the bed about her legges, ... but could not finde anything.\"\r\nThis was as serious evidence as that of one of the justices of the\r\npeace, who testified from the bench that a very honest friend of his had\r\nseen three or four imps come out of Anne West's house in the moonlight.\r\nHopkins was not to be outshone by the other accusers. He had visited\r\nColchester castle to interview Rebecca West and had gained her\r\nconfession that she had gone through a wedding ceremony with the Devil.\r\n\r\nBut why go into details? The evidence was all of a kind. The female\r\njuries figured, as in the trials at Lancaster in 1633, and gave the\r\nresults of their harrowing examinations. What with their verdicts and\r\nthe mass of accusations and confessions, the justices of the peace were\r\nbusy during March, April, and May of 1645. It was not until the\r\ntwenty-ninth of July that the trial took place. It was held at\r\nChelmsford before the justices of the peace and Robert Rich, Earl of\r\nWarwick. Warwick was not an itinerant justice, nor was he, so far as we\r\nknow, in any way connected with the judicial system. One of the most\r\nprominent Presbyterians in England, he had in April of this year, as a\r\nresult of the \"self-denying ordinance,\" laid down his commission as head\r\nof the navy. He disappears from view until August, when he was again\r\ngiven work to do. In the mean time occurred the Chelmsford trial. We can\r\nonly guess that the earl, who was appointed head of the Eastern\r\nAssociation less than a month later[17] (August 27), acted in this\r\ninstance in a military capacity. The assizes had been suspended. No\r\ndoubt some of the justices of the peace pressed upon him the urgency of\r\nthe cases to be tried. We may guess that he sat with them in the quarter\r\nsessions, but he seems to have played the rôle of an itinerant justice.\r\n\r\nNo narrative account of the trial proper is extant. Some one who signs\r\nhimself \"H. F.\" copied out and printed the evidence taken by the\r\njustices of the peace and inserted in the margins the verdicts. In this\r\nway we know that at least sixteen were condemned, probably two more, and\r\npossibly eleven or twelve more.[18] Of the original sixteen, one was\r\nreprieved, one died before execution, four were hanged at Manningtree\r\nand ten at Chelmsford.\r\n\r\nThe cases excited some comment, and it is comment that must not be\r\npassed over, for it will prove of some use later in analyzing the causes\r\nof the outbreak. Arthur Wilson, whom we have mentioned as an historian\r\nof the time, has left his verdict on the trial. \"There is nothing,\" he\r\nwrote, \"so crosse to my temper as putting so many witches to death.\" He\r\nsaw nothing, in the women condemned at Chelmsford, \"other than poore\r\nmellenchollie ... ill-dieted atrabilious constitutions, whose fancies\r\nworking by grosse fumes and vapors might make the imagination readie to\r\ntake any impression.\" Wilson wrestled long with his God over the matter\r\nof witches and came at length to the conclusion that \"it did not consist\r\nwith the infinite goodnes of the Almightie God to let Satan loose in so\r\nravenous a way.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinion of a parliamentary journal in London on the twenty-fourth of\r\nJuly, three days before the Essex executions, shows that the Royalists\r\nwere inclined to remark the number of witches in the counties friendly\r\nto Parliament: \"It is the ordinary mirth of the Malignants in this City\r\nto discourse of the Association of Witches in the Associated Counties,\r\nbut by this they shall understand the truth of the old Proverbe, which\r\nis that where God hath his Church, the Devill hath his Chappell.\" The\r\nwriter goes on, \"I am sory to informe you that one of the cheifest of\r\nthem was a Parsons Wife (this will be good news with the Papists)....\r\nHer name was Weight.... This Woman (as I heare) was the first\r\napprehended.\"[19] It seems, however, that Mrs. \"Weight\" escaped. Social\r\nand religious influences were not without value. A later pamphleteer\r\ntells us that the case of Mrs. Wayt, a minister's wife, was a \"palpable\r\nmistake, for it is well knowne that she is a gentle-woman of a very\r\ngodly and religious life.\"[20]\r\n\r\nMeantime Hopkins had extended his operations into Suffolk. Elizabeth\r\nClarke and Anne Leech had implicated certain women in that county. Their\r\ncharges were carried before the justices of the peace and were the\r\nbeginning of a panic which spread like wildfire over the county.\r\n\r\nThe methods which the witchfinder-general used are illuminating. Four\r\nsearchers were appointed for the county, two men and two women.[21] \"In\r\nwhat Town soever ... there be any person or persons suspected to be\r\nwitch or Witches, thither they send for two or all of the said\r\nsearchers, who take the partie or parties so suspected into a Roome and\r\nstrip him, her, or them, starke naked.\"[22] The clergyman Gaule has\r\ngiven us further particulars:[23] \"Having taken the suspected Witch,\r\nshee is placed in the middle of a room upon a stool, or Table,\r\ncrosse-legg'd, or in some other uneasie posture, to which if she submits\r\nnot, she is then bound with cords; there is she watcht and kept without\r\nmeat or sleep for the space of 24 hours.... A little hole is likewise\r\nmade in the door for the Impe to come in at; and lest it might come in\r\nsome lesse discernible shape, they that watch are taught to be ever and\r\nanon sweeping the room, and if they see any spiders or flyes, to kill\r\nthem. And if they cannot kill them, then they may be sure they are her\r\nImpes.\"[24] Hutchinson tells a story of one woman, who, after having\r\nbeen kept long fasting and without sleep, confessed to keeping an imp\r\ncalled Nan. But a \"very learned ingenious gentleman having indignation\r\nat the thing\" drove the people from the house, gave the woman some food,\r\nand sent her to bed. Next morning she knew of no Nan but a pullet she\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThe most sensational discovery in Suffolk was that John Lowes, pastor of\r\nBrandeston, was a witch. The case was an extraordinary one and throws a\r\nlight on the witch alarms of the time. Lowes was eighty years old, and\r\nhad been pastor in the same place for fifty years. He got into trouble,\r\nundoubtedly as a result of his inability to get along with those around\r\nhim. As a young man he had been summoned to appear before the synod at\r\nIpswich for not conforming to the rites of the Established Church.[25]\r\nIn the first year of Charles's reign he had been indicted for refusing\r\nto exhibit his musket,[26] and he had twice later been indicted for\r\nwitchcraft and once as a common imbarritor.[27] The very fact that he\r\nhad been charged with witchcraft before would give color to the charge\r\nwhen made in 1645. We have indeed a clue to the motives for this\r\naccusation. A parishioner and a neighboring divine afterwards gave it as\r\ntheir opinion that \"Mr. Lowes, being a litigious man, made his\r\nparishioners (too tenacious of their customs) very uneasy, so that they\r\nwere glad to take the opportunity of those wicked times to get him\r\nhanged, rather than not get rid of him.\" Hopkins had afforded them the\r\nopportunity. The witchfinder had taken the parson in hand. He had caused\r\nhim to be kept awake several nights together, and had run him backwards\r\nand forwards about the room until he was out of breath. \"Then they\r\nrested him a little and then ran him again, and this they did for\r\nseveral days and nights together, till he was weary of his life and\r\nscarce sensible of what he said or did.\"[28] He had, when first accused,\r\ndenied all charges and challenged proof, but after he had been subjected\r\nto these rigorous methods he made a full confession. He had, he said,\r\nsunk a sailing vessel of Ipswich, making fourteen widows in a quarter of\r\nan hour. The witchfinder had asked him if it did not grieve him to see\r\nso many men cast away in a short time, and he answered: \"No, he was\r\njoyfull to see what power his Impes had.\"[29] He had, he boasted, a\r\ncharm to keep him out of gaol and from the gallows. It is too bad that\r\nthe crazed man's confidence in his charm was misplaced. His whole wild\r\nconfession is an illustration of the effectiveness of the torture. His\r\nfate is indicative of the hysteria of the times and of the advantages\r\ntaken of it by malicious people. It was his hostility to the\r\necclesiastical and political sympathies of his community that caused his\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nThe dementia induced by the torture in Lowes's case showed itself in the\r\ncase of others, who made confessions of long careers of murder. \"These\r\nand all the rest confessed that cruell malice ... was their chiefe\r\ndelight.\" The accused were being forced by cruel torture to lend their\r\nhelp to a panic which exceeded any before or after in England. From one\r\nhundred and thirty to two hundred people[30] were soon under accusation\r\nand shut up in Bury gaol.\r\n\r\nNews of this reached a Parliament in London that was very much engrossed\r\nwith other matters. We cannot do better than to quote the Puritan\r\nbiographer Clarke.[31] \"A report was carried to the Parliament ... as\r\nif some busie men had made use of some ill Arts to extort such\r\nconfession; ... thereupon a special Commission of Oyer and Terminer was\r\ngranted for the trial of these Witches.\" Care was to be used, in\r\ngathering evidence, that confessions should be voluntary and should be\r\nbacked by \"many collateral circumstances.\" There were to be no\r\nconvictions except upon proof of express compact with the Devil, or upon\r\nevidence of the use of imps, which implied the same thing. Samuel\r\nFairclough and Edmund Calamy (the elder), both of them Non-Conformist\r\nclergymen of Suffolk,[32] together with Serjeant John Godbolt and the\r\njustices of the peace, were to compose this special court. The court met\r\nabout the end of August, a month after the sessions under Warwick at\r\nChelmsford, and was opened by two sermons preached by Mr. Fairclough in\r\nBury church. One of the first things done by the special court, quite\r\npossibly at the instigation of the two clergymen, was to put an end to\r\nthe swimming test,[33] which had been used on several of the accused,\r\ndoubtless by the authority of the justices of the peace. This was of\r\ncourse in some sense a blow at Hopkins. Nevertheless a great deal of the\r\nevidence which he had gathered must have been taken into account.\r\nEighteen persons, including two men,[34] were condemned to be\r\nhanged.[35] On the night before their execution, they were confined in a\r\nbarn, where they made an agreement not to confess a word at the gallows\r\nthe following day, and sang a psalm in confirmation. Next day they\r\n\"dyed ... very desperately.\"[36] But there were still one hundred and\r\ntwenty others in gaol[37] awaiting trial. No doubt many forthwith would\r\nhave met the same end, had it not been for a lucky chance of the wars.\r\nThe king's forces were approaching and the court hastened to adjourn its\r\nsessions.[38]\r\n\r\nBut this danger was soon over, and within three weeks' time the court\r\nseems to have resumed its duties.[39] Of this second session we know\r\nnothing at all, save that probably forty or fifty more witches were\r\ncondemned, and doubtless executed.[40] What became of the others we can\r\nonly guess. Perhaps some were released, some left in gaol indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThese things were not done in a corner. Yet so great was the distraction\r\nin England that, if we can trust negative evidence, they excited not a\r\ngreat deal of notice. Such comments as there were, however, were\r\nindicative of a division of opinion. During the interval between the two\r\nsessions, the _Moderate Intelligencer_, a parliamentary organ that had\r\nsprung up in the time of the Civil War, came out in an editorial on the\r\naffair. \"But whence is it that Devils should choose to be conversant\r\nwith silly Women that know not their right hands from their left, is the\r\ngreat wonder.... They will meddle with none but poore old Women: as\r\nappears by what we received this day from Bury.... Divers are condemned\r\nand some executed and more like to be. Life is precious and there is\r\nneed of great inquisition before it is taken away.\"[41]\r\n\r\nThis was the sole newspaper reference of which we know, as well as the\r\nonly absolutely contemporary mention of these trials. What other\r\nexpressions of opinion there were came later. James Howell, a popular\r\nessayist of his time, mentioned the trials in his correspondence as new\r\nproof of the reality of witchcraft.[42] The pious Bishop Hall saw in\r\nthem the \"prevalency of Satan in these times.\"[43] Thomas Ady, who in\r\n1656 issued his _Candle in the Dark_, mentioned the \"Berry Assizes\"[44]\r\nand remarked that some credulous people had published a book about it.\r\nHe thought criticism deserved for taking the evidence of the gaoler,\r\nwhose profit lay in having the greatest possible number executed.[45]\r\n\r\nWe have already described Hopkins as a man of action. Nothing is better\r\nevidence of it than the way in which he hurried back and forth over the\r\neastern counties. During the last part of May he had probably been\r\noccupied with collecting the evidence against the accused at Bury. Long\r\nbefore they were tried he was busy elsewhere. We can trace his movements\r\nin outline only, but we know enough of them to appreciate his tremendous\r\nenergy. Some time about the beginning of June he must have gone to\r\nNorfolk. Before the twenty-sixth of July twenty witches had been\r\nexecuted in that county.[46] None of the details of these trials have\r\nbeen left us. From the rapidity with which they were carried to\r\ncompletion we may feel fairly certain that the justices of the peace,\r\nseeing no probability of assize sessions in the near future, went ahead\r\nto try cases on their own initiative.[47] On the fifteenth of August the\r\ncorporation of Great Yarmouth, at the southern extremity of the Norfolk\r\ncoast line, voted to send for Mr. Hopkins, and that he should have his\r\nfee and allowance for his pains,[48] \"as he hath in other places.\" He\r\ncame at two different times, once in September and once in December.\r\nProbably the burden of the work was turned over to the four female\r\nassistants, who were granted a shilling a day apiece.[49] Six women were\r\ncondemned, one of whom was respited.[50] Later three other women and one\r\nman were indicted, but by this time the furor against them seems to\r\nhave abated, and they probably went free.[51]\r\n\r\nHopkins's further course can be traced with some degree of certainty.\r\nFrom Yarmouth he probably went to Ipswich, where Mother Lakeland was\r\nburned on September 9 at the instance of the justices of the peace.[52]\r\nMother Lakeland's death by burning is the second instance we have,\r\nduring the Hopkins panic,[53] of this form of sentence. It is explained\r\nby the fact that it was the law in England to burn women who murdered\r\ntheir husbands. The chief charge against Mother Lakeland, who, by the\r\nway, was a woman quite above the class from which witches were\r\nordinarily recruited,[54] was that she had bewitched her husband to\r\ndeath.[55] The crime was \"petty treason.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not a wild guess that Hopkins paused long enough in his active\r\ncareer to write an account of the affair, so well were his principles of\r\ndetection presented in a pamphlet soon issued from a London press.[56]\r\nBut, at any rate, before Mother Lakeland had been burned he was on his\r\nway to Aldeburgh, where he was already at work on the eighth of\r\nSeptember collecting evidence.[57] Here also he had an assistant, Goody\r\nPhillips, who no doubt continued the work after he left. He was back\r\nagain in Aldeburgh on the twentieth of December and the seventh of\r\nJanuary, and the grand result of his work was summarized in the brief\r\naccount: \"Paid ... eleven shillings for hanging seven witches.\"[58]\r\n\r\nFrom Aldeburgh, Hopkins may have journeyed to Stowmarket. We do not know\r\nhow many servants of the evil one he discovered here; but, as he was\r\npaid twenty-three pounds[59] for his services, and had received but six\r\npounds in Aldeburgh, the presumption is that his work here was very\r\nfruitful in results.\r\n\r\nWe now lose track of the witchfinder's movements for a while. Probably\r\nhe was doubling on his track and attending court sessions. In December\r\nwe know that he made his second visit to Yarmouth. From there he may\r\nhave gone to King's Lynn, where two witches were hanged this year, and\r\nfrom there perhaps returned early in January to Aldeburgh and other\r\nplaces in Suffolk. It is not to be supposed for a moment that his\r\nactivities were confined to the towns named. At least fifteen other\r\nplaces in Suffolk are mentioned by Stearne in his stories of the\r\nwitches' confessions.[60] While Hopkins's subordinates probably\r\nrepresented him in some of the villages, we cannot doubt that the\r\nwitchfinder himself visited many towns.\r\n\r\nFrom East Anglia Hopkins went westward into Cambridgeshire. His arrival\r\nthere must have been during either January or February. His reputation,\r\nindeed, had gone ahead of him, and the witches were reported to have\r\ntaken steps in advance to prevent detection.[61] But their efforts were\r\nvain. The witchfinder found not less than four or five of the detested\r\ncreatures,[62] probably more. We know, however, of only one execution,\r\nthat of a woman who fell under suspicion because she kept a tame\r\nfrog.[63]\r\n\r\nFrom Cambridgeshire, Hopkins's course took him, perhaps in March of\r\n1645/6, into Northamptonshire. There he found at least two villages\r\ninfested, and he turned up some remarkable evidence. So far in his\r\ncrusade, the keeping of imps had been the test infallible upon which the\r\nwitchfinder insisted. But at Northampton spectral evidence seems to have\r\nplayed a considerable part.[64] Hopkins never expresses his opinion on\r\nthis variety of evidence, but his co-worker declares that it should be\r\nused with great caution, because \"apparitions may proceed from the\r\nphantasie of such as the party use to fear or at least suspect.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was a case in Northamptonshire of a different type that seems to\r\nhave made the most lasting impression on Stearne. Cherrie of Thrapston,\r\n\"a very aged man,\" had in a quarrel uttered the wish that his neighbor's\r\ntongue might rot out. The neighbor thereupon suffered from something\r\nwhich we should probably call cancer of the tongue. Perhaps as yet the\r\npossibilities of suggestion have not been so far sounded that we can\r\nabsolutely discredit the physical effects of a malicious wish. It is\r\nmuch easier, however, to believe the reported utterance imagined after\r\nits supposed effect. At all events, Cherrie was forced to confess that\r\nhe had been guilty and he further admitted that he had injured Sir John\r\nWashington, who had been his benefactor at various times.[65] He was\r\nindicted by the grand jury, but died in gaol, very probably by suicide,\r\non the day when he was to have been tried.[66]\r\n\r\nFrom Northamptonshire Hopkins's course led him into Huntingdonshire,[67]\r\na county that seems to have been untroubled by witch alarms since the\r\nWarboys affair of 1593. The justices of the peace took up the quest\r\neagerly. The evidence that they gathered had but little that was\r\nunusual.[68] Mary Chandler had despatched her imp, Beelzebub, to injure\r\na neighbor who had failed to invite her to a party. An accused witch who\r\nwas questioned about other possible witches offered in evidence a\r\npeculiar piece of testimony. He had a conversation with \"Clarke's sonne\r\nof Keiston,\" who had said to him (the witness): \"I doe not beleeve you\r\ndie a Witch, for I never saw you at our meetings.\" This would seem to\r\nhave been a clever fiction to ward off charges against himself. But,\r\nstrangely enough, the witness declared that he answered \"that perhaps\r\ntheir meetings were at severall places.\"\r\n\r\nHopkins did not find it all smooth sailing in the county of Huntingdon.\r\nA clergyman of Great Staughton became outraged at his work and preached\r\nagainst it. The witchfinder had been invited to visit the town and\r\nhesitated. Meantime he wrote this blustering letter to one of John\r\nGaule's parishioners.\r\n\r\n    \"My service to your Worship presented, I have this day received a\r\n    Letter, &c.--to come to a Towne called Great Staughton to search\r\n    for evil disposed persons called Witches (though I heare your\r\n    Minister is farre against us through ignorance) I intend to come\r\n    (God willing) the sooner to heare his singular Judgment on the\r\n    behalfe of such parties; I have known a Minister in Suffolke preach\r\n    as much against their discovery in a Pulpit, and forc'd to recant\r\n    it (by the Committee) in the same place. I much marvaile such evill\r\n    Members[69] should have any (much more any of the Clergy) who\r\n    should daily preach Terrour to convince such Offenders, stand up to\r\n    take their parts against such as are Complainants for the King, and\r\n    sufferers themselves with their Families and Estates. I intend to\r\n    give your Towne a Visite suddenly, I am to come to Kimbolton this\r\n    weeke, and it shall bee tenne to one but I will come to your Town\r\n    first, but I would certainely know afore whether your Town affords\r\n    many Sticklers for such Cattell, or willing to give and afford us\r\n    good welcome and entertainment, as other where I have beene, else I\r\n    shall wave your Shire (not as yet beginning in any part of it my\r\n    selfe) And betake me to such places where I doe and may persist\r\n    without controle, but with thankes and recompence.\"[70]\r\n\r\nThis stirred the fighting spirit of the vicar of Great Staughton, and he\r\nanswered the witchfinder in a little book which he published shortly\r\nafter, and which he dedicated to Colonel Walton of the House of Commons.\r\nWe shall have occasion in another chapter to note its point of view.\r\n\r\nIn spite of opposition, Hopkins's work in Huntingdonshire prospered. The\r\njustices of the peace were occupied with examinations during March and\r\nApril. Perhaps as many as twenty were accused.[71] At least half that\r\nnumber were examined. Several were executed--we do not know the exact\r\nnumber--almost certainly at the instance of the justices of the\r\npeace.[72] It is pleasant to know that one was acquitted, even if it was\r\nafter she had been twice searched and once put through the swimming\r\nordeal.[73]\r\n\r\nFrom Huntingdonshire it is likely that Hopkins and Stearne made their\r\nnext excursion into Bedfordshire. We know very little about their\r\nsuccess here. In two villages it would seem that they were able to track\r\ntheir prey.[74] But they left to others the search which they had\r\nbegun.[75]\r\n\r\nThe witchfinder had been active for a little over a year. But during the\r\nlast months of that time his discoveries had not been so notable. Was\r\nthere a falling off in interest? Or was he meeting with increased\r\nopposition among the people? Or did the assize courts, which resumed\r\ntheir proceedings in the summer of 1646, frown upon him? It is hard to\r\nanswer the question without more evidence. But at any rate it is clear\r\nthat during the summer and autumn of 1646 he was not actively engaged in\r\nhis profession. It is quite possible, indeed, that he was already\r\nsuffering from the consumption which was to carry him off in the\r\nfollowing year. And, with the retirement of its moving spirit, the witch\r\ncrusade soon came to a close. Almost a twelvemonth later there was a\r\nsingle[76] discovery of witches. It was in the island of Ely; and the\r\nchurch courts,[77] the justices of the peace,[78] and the assize\r\ncourts,[79] which had now been revived, were able, between them, to hang\r\na few witches.[80]\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether Hopkins participated in the Ely affair or not. It\r\nseems certain that his co-worker, Stearne, had some share in it. But, if\r\nso, it was his last discovery. The work of the two men was ended. They\r\nhad been pursuing the pack of witches in the eastern counties since\r\nMarch of 1644/5. Even the execrations of those who opposed them could\r\nnot mar the pleasure they felt in what they had done. Nay, when they\r\nwere called upon to defend themselves, they could hardly refrain from\r\nexulting in their achievements. They had indeed every right to exult.\r\nWhen we come to make up the roll of their victims, we shall see that\r\ntheir record as witch discoverers surpassed the combined records of all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that they had acted in any haphazard way. The\r\nconduct of both men had been based upon perfectly logical deductions\r\nfrom certain premises. King James's _Dæmonologie_ had been their\r\ncatechism, the statute against the feeding of imps their book of rules.\r\nBoth men started with one fundamental notion, that witchcraft is the\r\nkeeping of imps. But this was a thing that could be detected by marks on\r\nthe bodies.[81] Both were willing to admit that mistakes could be made\r\nand were often made in assuming that natural bodily marks were the\r\nDevil's marks. There were, however, special indications by which the\r\ndifference between the two could be recognized.[82] And the two\r\nwitchfinders, of course, possessed that \"insight\"[83] which was\r\nnecessary to make the distinction. The theories upon which they worked\r\nwe need not enter into. Suffice it to say that when once they had\r\nproved, as they thought, the keeping of imps, the next step was to watch\r\nthose accused of it.[84] \"For the watching,\" says Stearne,[85] \"it is\r\nnot to use violence or extremity to force them to confesse, but onely\r\nthe keeping is, first to see whether any of their spirits, or familiars\r\ncome to or neere them.\" It is clear that both Hopkins and Stearne\r\nrecognized the fact that confessions wrung from women by torture are\r\nworthless and were by this explanation defending themselves against the\r\ncharge of having used actual torture. There seems to be no adequate\r\nreason for doubting the sincerity of their explanation. Stearne tells us\r\nthat the keeping the witches separate is \"also to the end that Godly\r\nDivines might discourse with them.\" \"For if any of their society come to\r\nthem to discourse with them, they will never confesse.\"[86] Here,\r\nindeed, is a clue to many confessions. Several men arrayed against one\r\nsolitary and weak woman could break her resolution and get from her very\r\nmuch what they pleased.\r\n\r\nAs for starving the witches and keeping them from sleep, Stearne\r\nmaintained that these things were done by them only at first. Hopkins\r\nbore the same testimony. \"After they had beat their heads together in\r\nthe Gaole, and after this use was not allowed of by the Judges and other\r\nMagistrates, it was never since used, which is a yeare and a halfe\r\nsince.\"[87] In other words, the two men had given up the practice\r\nbecause the parliamentary commission had compelled them to do so.\r\n\r\nThe confessions must be received with great caution, Hopkins himself\r\ndeclared.[88] It is so easy to put words into the witch's mouth. \"You\r\nhave foure Imps, have you not? She answers affirmatively. 'Yes'.... 'Are\r\nnot their names so and so'? 'Yes,' saith she. 'Did you not send such an\r\nImpe to kill my child'? 'Yes,' saith she.\" This sort of thing has been\r\ntoo often done, asserted the virtuous witchfinder. He earnestly did\r\ndesire that \"all Magistrates and Jurors would, a little more than ever\r\nthey did, examine witnesses about the interrogated confessions.\" What a\r\ncautious, circumspect man was this famous witchfinder! The confessions,\r\nhe wrote, in which confidence may be placed are when the woman, without\r\nany \"hard usages or questions put to her, doth of her owne accord\r\ndeclare what was the occasion of the Devil's appearing to her.\"[89]\r\n\r\nThe swimming test had been employed by both men in the earlier stages of\r\ntheir work. \"That hath been used,\" wrote Stearne, \"and I durst not goe\r\nabout to cleere my selfe of it, because formerly I used it, but it was\r\nat such time of the yeare as when none tooke any harme by it, neither\r\ndid I ever doe it but upon their owne request.\"[90] A thoughtful man was\r\nthis Stearne! Latterly he had given up the test--since \"Judge Corbolt\"\r\nstopped it[91]--and he had come to believe that it was a way of\r\n\"distrusting of God's providence.\"\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that the men who had conducted the witch crusade were\r\nable to present a consistent philosophy of their conduct. It was, of\r\ncourse, a philosophy constructed to meet an attack the force of which\r\nthey had to recognize. Hopkins's pamphlet and Stearne's _Confirmation_\r\nwere avowedly written to put their authors right in the eyes of a public\r\nwhich had turned against them.[92] It seems that this opposition had\r\nfirst shown itself at their home in Essex. A woman who was undergoing\r\ninquisition had found supporters, and, though she was condemned in spite\r\nof their efforts, was at length reprieved.[93] Her friends turned the\r\ntables by indicting Stearne and some forty others of conspiracy, and\r\napparently succeeded in driving them from the county.[94] In Bury the\r\nforces of the opposition had appealed to Parliament, and the Commission\r\nof Oyer and Terminer, which, it will be noticed, is never mentioned by\r\nthe witchfinders, was sent out to limit their activities. In\r\nHuntingdonshire, we have seen how Hopkins roused a protesting clergyman,\r\nJohn Gaule. If we may judge from the letter he wrote to one of Gaule's\r\nparishioners, Hopkins had by this time met with enough opposition to\r\nknow when it was best to keep out of the way. His boldness was assumed\r\nto cover his fear.\r\n\r\nBut it was in Norfolk that the opposition to the witchfinders reached\r\nculmination. There most pungent \"queries\" were put to Hopkins through\r\nthe judges of assize. He was charged with all those cruelties, which, as\r\nwe have seen, he attempts to defend. He was further accused of fleecing\r\nthe country for his own profit.[95] Hopkins's answer was that he took\r\nthe great sum of twenty shillings a town \"to maintaine his companie with\r\n3 horses.\"[96] That this was untrue is sufficiently proved by the\r\nrecords of Stowmarket where he received twenty-three pounds and his\r\ntraveling expenses. At such a rate for the discoveries, we can hardly\r\ndoubt that the two men between them cleared from three hundred to a\r\nthousand pounds, not an untidy sum in that day, when a day's work\r\nbrought six pence.\r\n\r\nWhat further action was taken in the matter of the queries \"delivered to\r\nthe Judges of assize\" we do not know. Both Hopkins and Stearne, as we\r\nhave seen, went into retirement and set to work to exonerate themselves.\r\nWithin the year Hopkins died at his old home in Manningtree. Stearne\r\nsays that he died \"peaceably, after a long sicknesse of a Consumption.\"\r\nBut tradition soon had it otherwise. Hutchinson says that the story, in\r\nhis time, was that Hopkins was finally put to the swimming test himself,\r\nand drowned. According to another tale, which seems to have lingered in\r\nSuffolk, he offered to show the Devil's roll of all the witches in\r\nEngland and so was detected.[97] Butler, in his _Hudibras_, said of him:\r\n\r\n    \"Who after proved himself a witch,\r\n    And made a rod for his own breech.\"\r\n\r\nButler's lines appeared only fifteen years after Hopkin's death, and his\r\nstatement is evidence enough that such a tradition was already current.\r\nThe tradition is significant. It probably means, not that Hopkins really\r\npaid such a penalty for his career--Stearne's word is good enough proof\r\nto the contrary--but that within his own generation his name had become\r\nan object of detestation.\r\n\r\nJohn Stearne did not return to Manningtree--he may have been afraid\r\nto--but settled down near Bury, the scene of his greatest successes.\r\n\r\nIf the epitaphs of these two men were to be written, their deeds could\r\nbe compressed into homely statistics. And this leads us to inquire what\r\nwas the sum of their achievement. It has been variously estimated. It is\r\nnot an uncommon statement that thirty thousand witches were hanged in\r\nEngland during the rule of Parliament, and this wild guess has been\r\ncopied by reputable authors. In other works the number has been\r\nestimated at three thousand, but this too is careless guesswork. Stearne\r\nhimself boasted that he knew of two hundred executions, and Stearne\r\nought to have known. It is indeed possible that his estimate was too\r\nhigh. He had a careless habit of confusing condemnations with executions\r\nthat makes us suspect that in this estimate he may have been thinking\r\nrather of the number of convictions than of the hangings. Yet his\r\nfigures are those of a man who was on the ground, and cannot be lightly\r\ndiscounted. Moreover, James Howell, writing in 1648, says that \"within\r\nthe compass of two years, near upon three hundred Witches were arraign'd\r\nand the major part executed in Essex and Suffolk only.\"[98] If these\r\nestimates be correct--or even if they approach correctness--a remarkable\r\nfact appears. Hopkins and Stearne, in fourteen months' time, sent to the\r\ngallows more witches than all the other witch-hunters of England can be\r\nproved--so far as our present records go--to have hung in the hundred\r\nand sixty years during which the persecution nourished in England. It\r\nmust occur to the reader that this crusade was extraordinary. Certainly\r\nit calls for explanation.\r\n\r\nSo far as the writer is aware, but one explanation has been offered. It\r\nhas been repeated until it has become a commonplace in the history of\r\nwitchcraft that the Hopkins crusade was one of the expressions of the\r\nintolerant zeal of the Presbyterian party during its control of\r\nParliament. This notion is largely due to Francis Hutchinson, who wrote\r\nthe first history of English witchcraft. Hutchinson was an Anglican\r\nclergyman, but we need not charge him with partisanship in accusing the\r\nPresbyterians. There was no inconsiderable body of evidence to support\r\nhis point of view. The idea was developed by Sir Walter Scott in his\r\n_Letters on Demonology_, but it was left to Lecky, in his classic essay\r\non witchcraft, to put the case against the Presbyterian Parliament in\r\nits most telling form.[99] His interpretation of the facts has found\r\ngeneral acceptance since.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to understand how this explanation grew up. At a time\r\nwhen Hutchinson was making his study, Richard Baxter, the most eminent\r\nPuritan of his time, was still a great name among the defenders of\r\nwitchcraft.[100] In his pages Hutchinson read how Puritan divines\r\naccompanied the witch-magistrates on their rounds and how a \"reading\r\nparson\" was one of their victims. Gaule, who opposed them, he seems to\r\nhave counted an Anglican. He clearly put some faith in the lines of\r\n_Hudibras_. Probably, however, none of these points weighed so much with\r\nhim as the general fact of coincidence in time between the great witch\r\npersecution and Presbyterian rule. It was hard to escape the conclusion\r\nthat these two unusual situations must in some way have been connected.\r\n\r\nNeither Hutchinson nor those who followed have called attention to a\r\npoint in support of their case which is quite as good proof of their\r\ncontention as anything adduced. It was in the eastern counties, where\r\nthe Eastern Association had flourished and where Parliament, as well as\r\nthe army, found its strongest backing--the counties that stood\r\nconsistently against the king--in those counties it was that Hopkins and\r\nStearne carried on their work.[101]\r\n\r\nIt may seem needless in the light of these facts to suggest any other\r\nexplanation of the witch crusade. Yet the whole truth has not by any\r\nmeans been told. It has already been noticed that Hutchinson made some\r\nmistakes. Parson Lowes, who was hanged as a witch at the instance of his\r\ndissatisfied parishioners, was not hanged because he was an\r\nAnglican.[102] And the Presbyterian Parliament had not sent down into\r\nSuffolk a commission to hang witches, but to check the indiscriminate\r\nproceedings that were going on there against witches. Moreover, while it\r\nis true that East Anglia and the counties adjacent, the stronghold of\r\nthe Puritans, were the scene of Hopkins's operations, it is quite as\r\ntrue that in those counties arose that powerful opposition which forced\r\nthe witchfinders into retirement. We have noticed in another connection\r\nthat the \"malignants\" were inclined to mock at the number of witches in\r\nthe counties friendly to Parliament, but there is nothing to show that\r\nthe mockers disbelieved the reality of the witchcrafts.[103]\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to turn some of Hutchinson's reasoning against him, as\r\nwell as to weaken the force of other arguments that may be presented on\r\nhis side. But, when we have done all this, we still have to face the\r\nunpleasant facts that the witch persecution coincided in time with\r\nPresbyterian rule and in place with Puritan communities. It is very hard\r\nto get around these facts. Nor does the writer believe that they can be\r\naltogether avoided, even if their edge can be somewhat blunted. It was a\r\ntime of bitter struggle. The outcome could not yet be forecast. Party\r\nfeeling was at a high pitch. The situation may not unfairly be compared\r\nwith that in the summer of 1863 during the American civil war. Then the\r\noutbreaks in New York revealed the public tension. The case in 1645 in\r\nthe eastern counties was similar. Every energy was directed towards the\r\nprosecution of the war. The strain might very well have shown itself in\r\nother forms than in hunting down the supposed agents of the Devil. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the apparitions and devils, the knockings and strange\r\nnoises, that filled up the pages of the popular literature were the\r\nindications of an overwrought public mind. Religious belief grew\r\nterribly literal under the tension of the war. The Anglicans were\r\nfighting for their king, the Puritans for their religion. That\r\nreligious fervor which very easily deepens into dementia was highly\r\naccentuated.[104]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, too much importance may have been given to the part played\r\nby Presbyterianism. There is no evidence which makes it certain that the\r\nmorbidity of the public would have taken the form of witch-hanging, had\r\nit not been for the leadership of Hopkins and Stearne. The Manningtree\r\naffair started very much as a score of others in other times. It had\r\njust this difference, that two pushing men took the matter up and made\r\nof it an opportunity. The reader who has followed the career of these\r\nmen has seen how they seem the backbone of the entire movement. It is\r\ntrue that the town of Yarmouth invited them of its own initiative to\r\ntake up the work there, but not until they had already made themselves\r\nfamous in all East Anglia. There is, indeed, too much evidence that\r\ntheir visits were in nearly every case the result of their own\r\ndeliberate purpose to widen the field of their labors. In brief, two\r\naggressive men had taken advantage of a time of popular excitement and\r\nalarm. They were fortunate in the state of the public mind, but they\r\nseem to have owed more to their own exertions.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps to neither factor was their success due so much as to the\r\nwant of government in England at this time. We have seen in an earlier\r\nchapter that Charles I and his privy council had put an end to a witch\r\npanic that bade fair to end very tragically. Not that they interfered\r\nwith random executions here and there. It was when the numbers involved\r\nbecame too large that the government stepped in to revise verdicts.\r\nThis was what the government of Parliament failed to do. And the reasons\r\nare not far to seek. Parliament was intensely occupied with the war. The\r\nwriter believes that it can be proved that, except in so far as\r\nconcerned the war, the government of Parliament and the Committee of\r\nBoth Kingdoms paid little or no attention to the affairs of the realm.\r\nIt is certainly true that they allowed judicial business to go by the\r\nboard. The assizes seem to have been almost, if not entirely, suspended\r\nduring the last half of the year 1645 and the first half of 1646.[105]\r\nThe justices of the peace, who had always shown themselves ready to hunt\r\ndown witches, were suffered to go their own gait.[106] To be sure, there\r\nwere exceptions. The Earl of Warwick held a court at Chelmsford, but he\r\nwas probably acting in a military capacity, and, inexperienced in court\r\nprocedure, doubtless depended largely upon the justices of the peace,\r\nwho, gathered in quarter sessions, were assisting him. It is true too\r\nthat Parliament had sent down a Commission of Oyer and Terminer to Bury,\r\na commission made up of a serjeant and two clergymen. But these two\r\ncases are, so far as we can discover, the sole instances during these\r\ntwo years when the justices of the peace were not left to their own\r\ndevices. This is significant. Except in Middlesex and in the chartered\r\ntowns of England, we have, excepting during this time of war, no records\r\nthat witches were ever sentenced to death, save by the judges of assize.\r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, England was in a state of judicial\r\nanarchy.[107] Local authorities were in control. But local authorities\r\nhad too often been against witches. The coming of Hopkins and Stearne\r\ngave them their chance, and there was no one to say stop.\r\n\r\nThis explanation fits in well with the fact, to which we shall advert in\r\nanother chapter, that no small proportion of English witch trials took\r\nplace in towns possessing separate rights of jurisdiction. This was\r\nespecially true in the seventeenth century. The cases in Yarmouth,\r\nKing's Lynn, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Berwick, and Canterbury, are all\r\ninstances in point. Indeed, the solitary prosecution in Hopkins's own\r\ntime in which he had no hand was in one of those towns, Faversham in\r\nKent. There the mayor and \"local jurators\" sent not less than three to\r\nthe gallows.[108]\r\n\r\nOne other aspect of the Hopkins crusade deserves further attention. It\r\nhas been shown in the course of the chapter that the practice of torture\r\nwas in evidence again and again during this period. The methods were\r\npeculiarly harrowing. At the same time they were methods which the\r\nrationale of the witch belief justified. The theory need hardly be\r\nrepeated. It was believed that the witches, bound by a pact with the\r\nDevil, made use of spirits that took animal forms. These imps, as they\r\nwere called, were accustomed to visit their mistress once in twenty-four\r\nhours. If the witch, said her persecutors, could be put naked upon a\r\nchair in the middle of the room and kept awake, the imps could not\r\napproach her. Herein lay the supposed reasonableness of the methods in\r\nvogue. And the authorities who were offering this excuse for their use\r\nof torture were not loth to go further. It was, they said, necessary to\r\nwalk the creatures in order to keep them awake. It was soon discovered\r\nthat the enforced sleeplessness and the walking would after two or three\r\ndays and nights produce confessions. Stearne himself describes the\r\nmatter graphically: \"For the watching,\" he writes, \"it is not to use\r\nviolence or extremity to force them to confesse, but onely the keeping\r\nis, first, to see whether any of their spirits or familiars come to or\r\nneere them; for I have found that if the time be come, the spirit or\r\nImpe so called should come, it will be either visible or invisible, if\r\nvisible, then it may be discerned by those in the Roome, if invisible,\r\nthen by the party. Secondly, it is for this end also, that if the\r\nparties which watch them, be so carefull that none come visible nor\r\ninvisible but that may be discerned, if they follow their directions\r\nthen the party presently after the time their Familiars should have\r\ncome, if they faile, will presently confesse, for then they thinke they\r\nwill either come no more or have forsaken them. Thirdly it is also to\r\nthe end, that Godly Divines and others might discourse with them, for if\r\nany of their society come to them to discourse with them, they will\r\nnever confesse.... But if honest godly people discourse with them,\r\nlaying the hainousnesse of their sins to them, and in what condition\r\nthey are in without Repentance, and telling them the subtilties of the\r\nDevil, and the mercies of God, these ways will bring them to Confession\r\nwithout extremity, it will make them break into confession hoping for\r\nmercy.\"[109]\r\n\r\nHopkins tells us more about the walking of the witches. In answer to the\r\nobjection that the accused were \"extraordinarily walked till their feet\r\nwere blistered, and so forced through that cruelty to confesse,\" \"he\r\nanswered that the purpose was only to keepe them waking: and the reason\r\nwas this, when they did lye or sit in a chaire, if they did offer to\r\ncouch downe, then the watchers were only to desire them to sit up and\r\nwalke about.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the inference might be drawn from these descriptions that the use\r\nof torture was a new feature of the witchcraft persecutions\r\ncharacteristic of the Civil War period. There is little evidence that\r\nbefore that time such methods were in use. A schoolmaster who was\r\nsupposed to have used magic against James I had been put to the rack.\r\nThere were other cases in which it is conjectured that the method may\r\nhave been tried. There is, however, little if any proof of such trial.\r\n\r\nSuch an inference would, however, be altogether unjustified. The\r\nabsence of evidence of the use of torture by no means establishes the\r\nabsence of the practice. It may rather be said that the evidence of the\r\npractice we possess in the Hopkins cases is of such a sort as to lead us\r\nto suspect that it was frequently resorted to. If for these cases we had\r\nonly such evidence as in most previous cases has made up our entire sum\r\nof information, we should know nothing of the terrible sufferings\r\nundergone by the poor creatures of Chelmsford and Bury. The confessions\r\nare given in full, as in the accounts of other trials, but no word is\r\nsaid of the causes that led to them. The difference between these cases\r\nof 1645 and other cases is this, that Hopkins and Stearne accused so\r\nlarge a body of witches that they stirred up opposition. It is through\r\nthose who opposed them and their own replies that we learn about the\r\ntortures inflicted upon the supposed agents of the Devil.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this cannot be insisted upon too strongly. A chance\r\nhas preserved for us the fact of the tortures of this time. It is\r\naltogether possible--it is almost probable--that, if we had all the\r\nfacts, we should find that similar or equally severe methods had been\r\npractised in many other witch cases.\r\n\r\nWe have been very minute in our descriptions of the Hopkins crusade, and\r\nby no means brief in our attempt to account for it. But it is safe to\r\nsay that it is easily the most important episode in that series of\r\nepisodes which makes up the history of English witchcraft. None of them\r\nbelong, of course, in the larger progress of historical events. It may\r\nseem to some that we have magnified the point at which they touched the\r\nwider interests of the time. Let it not be forgotten that Hopkins was a\r\nfactor in his day and that, however little he may have affected the\r\nlarger issues of the times, he was affected by them. It was only the\r\nunusual conditions produced by the Civil Wars that made the great\r\nwitchfinder possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See J. O. Jones, \"Matthew Hopkins, Witchfinder,\" in Thomas\r\nSeccombe's _Twelve Bad Men_ (London, 1894).\r\n\r\n[2] See _Notes and Queries_, 1854, II, 285, where a quotation from a\r\nparish register of Mistley-cum-Manningtree is given: \"Matthew Hopkins,\r\nson of Mr. James Hopkins, Minister of Wenham, was buried at Mistley\r\nAugust 12, 1647.\" See also John Stearne, _A Confirmation and Discovery\r\nof Witchcraft_, 61 (cited hereafter as \"Stearne\").\r\n\r\n[3] _Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Advance of Money,\r\n1642-1656_, I, 457. _Cf. Notes and Queries_, 1850, II, 413.\r\n\r\n[4] The oft-repeated statement that he had been given a commission by\r\nParliament to detect witches seems to rest only on the mocking words of\r\nButler's _Hudibras_:\r\n\r\n    \"Hath not this present Parliament\r\n    A Ledger to the Devil sent,\r\n    Fully empower'd to treat about\r\n    Finding revolted Witches out?\"\r\n\r\n                            (_Hudibras_, pt. ii, canto 3.)\r\n\r\nTo these lines an early editor added the note: \"The Witch-finder in\r\nSuffolk, who in the Presbyterian Times had a Commission to discover\r\nWitches.\" But he names no authority, and none can be found. It is\r\nprobably a confusion with the Commission appointed for the trial of the\r\nwitches in Suffolk (see below, p. 178). Even his use of the title\r\n\"witch-finder-general\" is very doubtful. \"Witch-finder\" he calls himself\r\nin his book; only the frontispiece has \"Witch Finder Generall.\" Nor is\r\nthis title given him by Stearne, Gaule, or any contemporary record. It\r\nis perhaps only a misunderstanding of the phrase of Hopkins's\r\ntitle-page, \"for the benefit of the whole kingdome\"--a phrase which, as\r\nthe punctuation shows, describes, not the witch-finder, but his book.\r\nYet in _County Folk Lore, Suffolk_ (Folk Lore Soc., 1893), 178, there is\r\nan extract about John Lowes from a Brandeston MS.: \"His chief accuser\r\nwas one Hopkins, who called himself Witchfinder-General.\" But this is of\r\nuncertain date, and may rest on Hutchinson.\r\n\r\n[5] This is evident enough from his incessant use of Scripture and from\r\nthe Calvinistic stamp of his theology; but he leaves us no doubt when\r\n(p. 54) he describes the Puritan Fairclough as \"an able Orthodox\r\nDivine.\"\r\n\r\n[6] Matthew Hopkins, _The Discovery of Witches_ (London, 1647), 2--cited\r\nhereafter as \"Hopkins.\"\r\n\r\n[7] One of them was Sir Harbottle Grimston, a baronet of Puritan\r\nancestry, who had been active in the Long Parliament, but who as a\r\n\"moderate man\" fell now somewhat into the background. The other was Sir\r\nThomas Bowes. Both figure a little later as Presbyterian elders.\r\n\r\n[8] Hopkins, 3.\r\n\r\n[9] Hopkins, 2; Stearne, 14-16.\r\n\r\n[10] It must, however, be noted that the oaths of the four women are put\r\ntogether, and that one of the men deposed merely that he confirmed\r\nStearne's particulars.\r\n\r\n[11] Although Hopkins omitted in his testimony the first animal seen by\r\nStearne. He mentioned it later, calling it Holt. Stearne called it\r\nLought. See Hopkins, 2; Stearne, 15. But Stearne calls it Hoult in his\r\ntestimony as reproduced in the _True and exact Relation of the severall\r\nInformations, Examinations and Confessions of the Late Witches ... at\r\nChelmesford ..._ (London, 1645), 3-4.\r\n\r\n[12] Despite this record Anne West is described by Stearne (p. 39) as\r\none of the very religious people who make an outward show \"as if they\r\nhad been Saints on earth.\"\r\n\r\n[13] The confession of Rebecca West is indeed dated \"21\" March 1645, the\r\nvery day of Elizabeth Clarke's arrest; but all the context suggests that\r\nthis is an error. In spite of her confessions, which were of the most\r\ndamaging, Rebecca West was eventually acquitted.\r\n\r\n[14] It must not for a moment, however, be forgotten that these\r\nconfessions had been wrung from tortured creatures.\r\n\r\n[15] Richard Carter and Henry Cornwall had testified that Margaret Moone\r\nconfessed to them. Probably she did, as she was doubtless at that time\r\nunder torture.\r\n\r\n[16] The evidence offered against her well suggests on what slender\r\ngrounds a witch might be accused. \"This Informant saith that the house\r\nwhere this Informante and the said Mary did dwell together, was haunted\r\nwith a Leveret, which did usually sit before the dore: And this\r\nInformant knowing that one Anthony Shalock had an excellent Greyhound\r\nthat had killed many Hares; and having heard that a childe of the said\r\nAnthony was much haunted and troubled, and that the mother of the childe\r\nsuspected the said Mary to be the cause of it: This Informant went to\r\nthe said Anthony Shalock and acquainted him that a Leveret did usually\r\ncome and sit before the dore, where this Informant and the said Mary\r\nGreenleife lived, and desired the said Anthony to bring downe his\r\nGreyhound to see if he could kill the said Leveret; and the next day the\r\nsaid Anthony did accordingly bring his Greyhound, and coursed it, but\r\nwhether the dog killed it this Informant knows not: But being a little\r\nbefore coursed by Good-man Merrils dog, the dog ran at it, but the\r\nLeveret never stirred, and just when the dog came at it, he skipped over\r\nit, and turned about and stood still, and looked on it, and shortly\r\nafter that dog languished and dyed.\"\r\n\r\n[17] See Bulstrode Whitelocke, _Memorials of English Affairs ..._\r\n(London, 1682; Oxford, 1853), ed. of 1853, I, 501.\r\n\r\n[18] \"H. F.\"'s publication is the _True and exact Relation_ cited above\r\n(note 11). He seems to have written it in the last of May, but inserted\r\nverdicts later in the margin. Arthur Wilson, who was present, says that\r\n18 were executed; Francis Peck, _Desiderata Curiosa_ (London, 1732-1735;\r\n1779), ed. of 1779, II, 476. But Hopkins writes that 29 were condemned\r\nat once and Stearne says about 28; quite possibly there were two trials\r\nat Chelmsford. There is only one other supposition, _i. e._, that\r\nHopkins and Stearne confused the number originally accused with the\r\nnumber hanged.

Beside that unreasonable watching, they\r\nwere extraordinarily walked, till their feet were blistered, and so\r\nforced through that cruelty to confess.\" Hopkins himself admitted the\r\nkeeping of Elizabeth Clarke from sleep, but is careful to insert \"upon\r\ncommand from the Justice.\" Hopkins, 2-3.

Stearne, 23, says he was charged as a \"common\r\nimbarritor\" over thirty years before.\r\n\r\n[28] This account of the torture is given, in a letter to Hutchinson, by\r\na Mr. Rivet, who had \"heard it from them that watched with him.\" It is\r\nin some measure confirmed by the MS. history of Brandeston quoted in\r\n_County Folk Lore, Suffolk_ (Folk Lore Soc.), 178, which adds the\r\nabove-quoted testimony as to his litigiousness.\r\n\r\n[29] Stearne, 24.\r\n\r\n[30] _A True Relation of the Araignment of eighteene Witches_, 5;\r\n_Moderate Intelligencer_, September 4-11, 1645.\r\n\r\n[31] See Samuel Clarke, _Lives of sundry Eminent Persons ..._ (London,\r\n1683), 172.

See Whitelocke, _Memorials_, I, 501.\r\n\r\n[40] Stearne, 11, speaks of 68 condemnations. On p. 14 he tells of 18\r\nwho were executed at Bury, but this may have referred to the first group\r\nonly. A MS. history of Brandeston quoted in _County Folk Lore, Suffolk_\r\n(Folk Lore Soc.), 178, says that Lowes was executed with 59 more. It is\r\nnot altogether certain, however, that this testimony is independent.\r\nNevertheless, it contains pieces of information not in the other\r\naccounts, and so cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\n[41] _Moderate Intelligencer_, September 4-11, 1645.\r\n\r\n[42] Howell, _Familiar Letters_ (I use the ed. of Joseph Jacobs, London\r\n1890-1892) II, 506, 515, 551.

The statement about the 16 witches hanged at\r\nYarmouth may be found in practically all accounts of English witchcraft,\r\n_e. g._, see the recent essay on Hopkins by J. O.

We of course do not know that the sentence was carried out.\r\n\r\n[54] The master of a ship had been \"sutor\" for her grandchild; _The\r\nLawes against Witches_, 8.

This was\r\nof course attributed to witchcraft. Stearne, 35.\r\n\r\n[67] _Ibid._, 11.\r\n\r\n[68] John Wynnick and Joane Wallis made effective confessions. The\r\nfirst, when in the heat of passion at the loss of a purse, had signed\r\nhis soul away (Stearne, 20-21; see also the pamphlet, the dedication of\r\nwhich is signed by John Davenport, entitled, _The Witches of Huntingdon,\r\ntheir Examinations and Confessions ..._ London, 1646, 3). The latter\r\nmaintained a troop of imps, among whom Blackeman, Grissell, and\r\nGreedigut figured most prominently. The half-witted creature could not\r\nrecall the names on the repetition of her confessions, but this failing\r\ndoes not seem to have awakened any doubt of her guilt. Stearne could not\r\navoid noticing that some of those who suffered were very religious. One\r\nwoman, who had kept an imp for twenty-one years, \"did resort to church\r\nand had a desire to be rid of her unhappy burden.\"\r\n\r\n[69] _I. e._, witches.\r\n\r\n[70] This letter is printed by Gaule at the opening of his _Select Cases\r\nof Conscience Touching Witches and Witchcrafts_.\r\n\r\n[71] Stearne, 11; _cf._ below, appendix C, 1646 (pp. 405-406).\r\n\r\n[72] That it was done by the justices of the peace is a probable\r\nconclusion from Stearne's language. See his account of Joane Wallis, p.\r\n13, also his account of John Wynnick, pp. 20-21. That the examinations\r\nwere in March and April (see John Davenport's account, _The Witches of\r\nHuntingdon_) and the executions in May is a fact confirmatory of this;\r\nsee Stearne, 11. But it is more to the point that John Davenport\r\ndedicates his pamphlet to the justices of the peace for the county of\r\nHuntingdon, and says: \"You were present, and Judges at the Tryall and\r\nConviction of them.\"\r\n\r\n[73] The swimming ordeal was perhaps unofficial; see Stearne, 19.\r\nAnother case was that of Elizabeth Chandler, who was \"duckt\"; _Witches\r\nof Huntingdon_, 8.\r\n\r\n[74] Tilbrooke-bushes, Stearne, 11; Risden, _ibid._, 31.\r\n\r\n[75] This may be inferred from Stearne's words: \"but afterward I heard\r\nthat she made a very large confession,\" _ibid._, 31.\r\n\r\n[76] Thomas Wright, John Ashton, J. O. Jones, and the other writers who\r\nhave dealt with Hopkins, speak of the Worcester trials, in 1647, in\r\nwhich four women are said to have been hanged. Their statements are all\r\nbased upon a pamphlet, _The Full Tryals, Examination, and Condemnation\r\nof Four Notorious Witches at the Assizes held at Worcester on Tuseday\r\nthe 4th of March.... Printed for I. W._ What seems to have been the\r\nfirst edition of this brochure bears no date. In 1700 another edition\r\nwas printed for \"J. M.\" in Fleet Street. Some writer on witchcraft\r\ngained the notion that this pamphlet belonged in the year 1647 and dealt\r\nwith events in that year. Wright, John Ashton, and W. H. Davenport Adams\r\n(_Witch, Warlock, and Magician_, London, 1889), all accept this date. An\r\nexamination of the pamphlet shows that it was cleverly put together from\r\nthe _True and Exact Relation_ of 1645. The four accused bear the names\r\nof four of those accused at Chelmsford, and make, with a few\r\ndifferences, the same confessions. See below, appendix A, § 4, for a\r\nfurther discussion of this pamphlet. It is strange that so careful a\r\nstudent as Thomas Wright should have been deceived by this pamphlet,\r\nespecially since he noticed that the confessions were \"imitations\" of\r\nthose in Essex.\r\n\r\n[77] A. Gibbons, ed., _Ely Episcopal Records_ (Lincoln, 1891), 112-113.\r\n\r\n[78] Stearne, 37.\r\n\r\n[79] That there were assizes is proved by the statement that \"Moore's\r\nwife\" confessed before the \"Judge, Bench, and Country,\" _ibid._, 21-22,\r\nas well as by the reference in the _Ely Episcopal Records_, 113, to the\r\n\"assizes.\"\r\n\r\n[80] Stearne, 17, 21-22.\r\n\r\n[81] For a clear statement of this point of view, see _ibid._, 40-50.\r\n\r\n[82] Stearne, 46-47.\r\n\r\n[83] _Ibid._, 50.\r\n\r\n[84] _Ibid._, 17.\r\n\r\n[85] _Ibid._, 13.\r\n\r\n[86] _Ibid._, 14.\r\n\r\n[87] Hopkins, 5. But Hopkins was not telling the exact truth here. When\r\nhe was at Aldeburgh in September (8th) the accused were watched day and\r\nnight. See chamberlain's accounts, in N. F. Hele, _Notes or Jottings\r\nabout Aldeburgh_, 43.\r\n\r\n[88] Hopkins, 7.\r\n\r\n[89] Hopkins, 9.\r\n\r\n[90] Stearne, 18. Hopkins did not attempt to deny the use of the ordeal.\r\nHe supported himself by quoting James; see Hopkins, 6.\r\n\r\n[91] Stearne, 18. He means, of course, Serjeant Godbolt.\r\n\r\n[92] See Stearne, in his preface to the reader, also p. 61; and see also\r\nthe complete title of Hopkins's book as given in appendix A (p. 362).\r\n\r\n[93] A similar case was that of Anne Binkes, to whom Stearne refers on\r\np. 54. He says she confessed to him her guilt. \"Was this woman fitting\r\nto live?... I am sure she was living not long since, and acquitted upon\r\nher trial.\"\r\n\r\n[94] Not until after Stearne was already busy elsewhere. Stearne, 58.\r\n\r\n[95] It would seem, too, that Stearne was sued for recovery of sums paid\r\nhim. \"Many rather fall upon me for what hath been received; but I hope\r\nsuch suits will be disannulled.\" Stearne, 60.\r\n\r\n[96] Hopkins, 11.\r\n\r\n[97] _County Folk Lore, Suffolk_ (Folk Lore Soc.) 176, quoting from J.\r\nT. Varden in the _East Anglian Handbook_ for 1885, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[98] James Howell, _Familiar Letters_, II, 551. Howell, of course, may\r\neasily have counted convictions as executions. Moreover, it was a time\r\nwhen rumors were flying about, and Howell would not have taken the pains\r\nto sift them. Yet his agreement with Stearne in numbers is remarkable.\r\nSomewhat earlier, (the letter is dated February 3, 1646/7) Howell had\r\nwritten that \"in Essex and Suffolk there were above two hundred indicted\r\nwithin these two years and above the one half executed\" (_ibid._, 506).\r\nBut, as noted above, his dates are not to be trusted.\r\n\r\n[99] See his _History of Rationalism_.\r\n\r\n[100] A name no greater, however, than that of Glanvill, who was a\r\nprominent Anglican.\r\n\r\n[101] It does not belong in this connection, but it should be stated,\r\nthat one of the strongest reasons for supposing the Presbyterian party\r\nlargely responsible for the persecution of witches lies in the large\r\nnumber of witches in Scotland throughout the whole period of that\r\nparty's ascendancy. This is an argument that can hardly be successfully\r\nanswered. Yet it is a legitimate question whether the witch-hunting\r\nproclivities of the north were not as much the outcome of Scottish laws\r\nand manners as of Scottish religion.\r\n\r\n[102] The _Magazine of Scandall_, speaking of Lowes and another man,\r\nsays: \"Their Religion is either none, or else as the wind blows: If the\r\nceremonies be tending to Popery, none so forward as they, and if there\r\nbe orders cleane contrary they shall exceed any Round-head in the Ile of\r\ngreat Brittain.\" See also above, pp. 175-177.\r\n\r\n[103] Yet it must not be overlooked that Stearne himself, who must have\r\nknown well the religious sympathies of his opponents, asks, p. 58, \"And\r\nwho are they that have been against the prosecution ... but onely such\r\nas (without offence I may speak it) be enemies to the Church of God?\" He\r\ndares not mention names, \"not onely for fear of offence, but also for\r\nsuits of Law.\"\r\n\r\n[104] Scott has pictured this very well in _Woodstock_. For a good\r\nexample of it see _The [D]Ivell in Kent, or His strange Delusions at\r\nSandwitch_ (London, 1647).\r\n\r\n[105] See below, note 107.\r\n\r\n[106] The witches of Aldeburgh were tried at the \"sessions,\" N. F. Hele,\r\n_op. cit._, 43-44. Mother Lakeland was probably condemned by the\r\njustices of the peace; see _The Lawes against Witches_. The witches of\r\nHuntingdon were tried by the justices of the peace; see above, note 73.\r\nAs for the trials in Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, and\r\nCambridgeshire, it is fairly safe to reason that they were conducted by\r\nthe justices of the peace from other evidence which we have that there\r\nwere no assizes during the last half of 1645 and the first five months\r\nof 1646; see Whitelocke, _Memorials_, II, 31, 44, 64.\r\n\r\n[107] For a few of the evidences of this situation during these years\r\nsee James Thompson, _Leicester_ (Leicester, 1849), 401; _Hist. MSS.\r\nComm. Reports, Various_, I, 109-110, 322; XIII, 4, p. 216 (note gaps in\r\nthe records); Whitelocke, _Memorials_, I, 436; II, 31, 44, 64, 196; III,\r\n152. Innumerable other references could be added to prove this point. F.\r\nA. Inderwick in his _Interregnum_ (London, 1891), 153, goes so far as to\r\nsay that \"from the autumn of 1642 to the autumn of 1646 no judges went\r\nthe circuits.\" This seems rather a sweeping statement.\r\n\r\n[108] See _The Examination, Confession_, etc. (London, 1645). Joan\r\nWilliford, Joan Cariden, and Jane Hott were tried. The first two quickly\r\nconfessed to the keeping of imps. Not so Jane Hott, who urged the others\r\nto confess and \"stoode to it very perversely that she was cleare.\" When\r\nput to the swimming test she floated, and is said to have then declared\r\nthat the Devil \"had sat upon a Cross beame and laughed at her.\"\r\nElizabeth Harris was examined, and gave some damaging evidence against\r\nherself. She named several goodwives who had very loose tongues.\r\n\r\n[109] Stearne, 13, 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT DURING THE COMMONWEALTH AND PROTECTORATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have, in the last chapter, traced the history of witchcraft in\r\nEngland through the Hopkins episode of 1645-1647. From the trials at Ely\r\nin the autumn of 1647 to the discoveries at Berwick in the summer of\r\n1649 there was a lull in the witch alarms. Then an epidemic broke out in\r\nthe north of England. We shall, in this chapter, describe that epidemic\r\nand shall carry the narrative of the important cases from that time to\r\nthe Restoration. In doing this we shall mark off two periods, one from\r\n1649 to 1653, when the executions were still numerous, and a second from\r\n1653 to 1659 when there was a rapid falling off, not only in death\r\npenalties for witchcraft, but even in accusations. To be sure, this\r\ndivision is somewhat artificial, for there was a gradual decline of the\r\nattack throughout the two periods, but the year 1653 more nearly than\r\nany other marks the year when that decline became visible.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1649 came from Scotland. Throughout the year the\r\nnorthern kingdom had been \"infested.\"[1] From one end of that realm to\r\nthe other the witch fires had been burning. It was not to be supposed\r\nthat they should be suddenly extinguished when they reached the border.\r\nIn July the guild of Berwick had invited a Scotchman who had gained\r\ngreat fame as a \"pricker\" to come to Berwick, and had promised him\r\nimmunity from all violence.[2] He came and proceeded to apply his\r\nmethods of detection. They rested upon the assumption that a witch had\r\ninsensible spots on her body, and that these could be found by driving\r\nin a pin. By such processes he discovered thirty witches, who were sent\r\nto gaol. Some of them made confessions but refused to admit that they\r\nhad injured any one.[3] On the contrary, they had assisted Cromwell, so\r\nsome of the more ingenious of them claimed, at the battle of Preston.[4]\r\nWhether this helped their case we do not know, for we are not told the\r\noutcome. It seems almost certain, however, that few, if any, of them\r\nsuffered death. But the pricker went back to Scotland with thirty\r\npounds, the arrangement having been that he was to receive twenty\r\nshillings a witch.\r\n\r\nHe was soon called upon again. In December of the same year the town of\r\nNewcastle underwent a scare. Two citizens, probably serjeants, applied\r\nthe test with such success that in March (1649/50) a body of citizens\r\npetitioned the common council that some definite steps be taken about\r\nthe witches. The council accepted the suggestion and despatched two\r\nserjeants, doubtless the men already engaged in the work, to Scotland to\r\nengage the witch-pricker. He was brought to Newcastle with the definite\r\ncontract that he was to have his passage going and coming and twenty\r\nshillings apiece for every witch he found. The magistrates did\r\neverything possible to help him. On his arrival in Newcastle they sent\r\nthe bellman through the town inviting every one to make complaints.[5]\r\nIn this business-like way they collected thirty women at the town hall,\r\nstripped them, and put them to the pricking test. This cruel, not to say\r\nindelicate, process was carried on with additions that must have proved\r\nhighly diverting to the base-minded prickers and onlookers.[6] Fourteen\r\nwomen and one man were tried (Gardiner says by the assizes) and found\r\nguilty. Without exception they asserted their innocence; but this\r\navailed not. In August of 1650 they were executed on the town moor[7] of\r\nNewcastle.[8]\r\n\r\nThe witchfinder continued his activities in the north, but a storm was\r\nrising against him. Henry Ogle, a late member of Parliament, caused him\r\nto be jailed and put under bond to answer the sessions.[9] Unfortunately\r\nthe man got away to Scotland, where he later suffered death for his\r\ndeeds, probably during the Cromwellian regime in that country.[10]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Henry Ogle had driven the Scotch pricker out of the\r\ncountry. He participated in another witch affair during this same period\r\nwhich is quite as much to his credit. The children of George Muschamp,\r\nin Northumberland, had been troubled for two years (1645-1647) with\r\nstrange convulsions.[11] The family suspected Dorothy Swinow, who was\r\nthe wife of Colonel Swinow. It seems that the colonel's wife had, at\r\nsome time, spoken harshly to one of the children. No doubt the sick\r\nlittle girl heard what they said. At any rate her ravings began to take\r\nthe form of accusations against the suspected woman. The family\r\nconsulted John Hulton, \"who could do more then God allowed,\" and he\r\naccused Colonel Swinow's wife. But unfortunately for him the child had\r\nbeen much better during his presence, and he too was suspected. The\r\nmother of the children now rode to a justice of the peace, who sent for\r\nHulton, but not for Mistress Swinow. Then the woman appealed to the\r\nassizes, but the judge, \"falsely informed,\" took no action. Mrs.\r\nMuschamp was persistent, and in the town of Berwick she was able, at\r\nlength, to procure the arrest of the woman she feared. But Dorothy\r\nSwinow was not without friends, who interfered successfully in her\r\nbehalf. Mrs. Muschamp now went to a \"counsellor,\" who refused to meddle\r\nwith the matter, and then to a judge, who directed her to go to Durham.\r\nShe did so and got a warrant; but it was not obeyed. She then procured a\r\nsecond warrant, and apparently succeeded in getting an indictment. But\r\nit did her little good: Dorothy Swinow was not apprehended.\r\n\r\nOne can hardly refrain from smiling a little at the unhappy Mrs.\r\nMuschamp and her zealous assistants, the \"physician\" and the two\r\nclergymen. But her poor daughters grew worse, and the sick child, who\r\nhad before seen angels in her convulsions, now saw the colonel's wife\r\nand cried out in her ravings against the remiss judge.[12] The case is\r\nat once pathetic and amusing, but it has withal a certain significance.\r\nIt was not only Mrs. Swinow's social position that saved her, though\r\nthat doubtless carried weight. It was the reluctance of the\r\nnorth-country justices to follow up accusations. Not that they had done\r\nwith trials. Two capital sentences at Durham and another at Gateshead,\r\nalthough perhaps after-effects of the Scotch pricker's activity, showed\r\nthat the witch was still feared; but such cases were exceptions. In\r\ngeneral, the cases resulted in acquittals. We shall see, in another\r\nchapter, that the discovery which alarmed Yorkshire and Northumberland\r\nin 1673 almost certainly had this outcome; and the cases tried at that\r\ntime formed the last chapter in northern witchcraft.\r\n\r\nBut, if hanging witches was not easy in the north, there were still\r\ndistricts in the southwest of England where it could be done, with few\r\nto say nay. Anne Bodenham,[13] of Fisherton Anger in Wiltshire, had not\r\nthe social position of Dorothy Swinow, but she was the wife of a\r\nclothier who had lived \"in good fashion,\" and in her old age she taught\r\nchildren to read. She had, it seems, been in earlier life an apt pupil\r\nof Dr. Lambe, and had learned from him the practice of magic lore. She\r\ndrew magic circles, saw visions of people in a glass, possessed numerous\r\ncharms and incantations, and, above all, kept a wonderful magic book.\r\nShe attempted to find lost money, to tell the future, and to cure\r\ndisease; indeed, she had a varied repertoire of occult performances.\r\n\r\nNow, Mistress Bodenham did all these things for money and roused no\r\nantagonism in her community until she was unfortunate enough to have\r\ndealings with a maid-servant in a Wiltshire family. It is impossible to\r\nget behind the few hints given us by the cautious writer. The members of\r\nthe family, evidently one of some standing in Wiltshire, became involved\r\nin a quarrel among themselves. It was believed, indeed, by neighbors\r\nthat there had been a conspiracy on the part of some of the family to\r\npoison the mother-in-law. At all events, a maid in the family was\r\nimprisoned for participation in such a plot. It was then that Anne\r\nBodenham first came into the story. The maid, to judge from the few data\r\nwe have, in order to distract attention from her own doings, made a\r\nconfession that she had signed a book of the Devil's with her own blood,\r\nall at the instigation of Anne Bodenham. Moreover, Anne, she said, had\r\noffered to send her to London in two hours. This was communicated to a\r\njustice of the peace, who promptly took the accused woman into custody.\r\nThe maid-servant, successful thus far, began to simulate fits and to lay\r\nthe blame for them on Mistress Anne. Questioned as to what she conceived\r\nher condition, she replied, \"Oh very damnable, very wretched.\" She could\r\nsee the Devil, she said, on the housetop looking at her. These fancies\r\npassed as facts, and the accused woman was put to the usual\r\nhumiliations. She was searched, examined, and urged to confess. The\r\nnarrator of the story made effort after effort to wring from her an\r\nadmission of her guilt, but she slipped out of all his traps. Against\r\nher accuser she was very bitter. \"She hath undone me ... that am an\r\nhonest woman, 'twill break my Husband's heart, he grieves to see me in\r\nthese Irons: I did once live in good fashion.\"\r\n\r\nThe case was turned over by the justices of the peace to the assizes at\r\nSalisbury, where Chief Baron John Wylde of the exchequer presided.[14]\r\nThe testimony of the maid was brought in, as well as the other\r\nproofs.[15] All we know of the trial is that Anne was condemned, and\r\nthat Judge Wylde was so well satisfied with his work that he urged\r\nEdmund Bower, who had begun an account of the case, but had hesitated to\r\nexpose himself to \"this Censorious Age,\" to go on with his booklet. That\r\ndetestable individual had followed the case closely. After the\r\ncondemnation he labored with the woman to make her confess. But no\r\nacknowledgment of guilt could be wrung from the high-spirited Mistress\r\nBodenham, even when the would-be father confessor held out to her the\r\nfalse hope of mercy. She made a will giving gifts to thirty people,\r\ndeclared she had been robbed by her maids in prison, lamented over her\r\nhusband's sorrow, and requested that she be buried under the gallows.\r\nLike the McPherson who danced so wantonly and rantingly beneath the\r\ngallows tree, she remained brave-hearted to the end. When the officer\r\ntold her she must go with him to the place of execution, she replied,\r\n\"Be you ready, I am ready.\" The narrator closes the account with some\r\nmoral reflections. We may close with the observation that there is no\r\nfiner instance of womanly courage in the annals of witchcraft than that\r\nof Anne Bodenham. Doubtless she had used charms, and experimented with\r\nglasses; it had been done by those of higher rank than she.\r\n\r\nAs for the maid, she had got herself well out of trouble. When Mistress\r\nBodenham had been hanged, the fits ceased, and she professed great\r\nthankfulness to God and a desire to serve him.\r\n\r\nThe case of Joan Peterson, who was tried at the Old Bailey in 1652, is\r\nanother instance of the struggle of a spirited woman against too great\r\nodds. Joan, like Mistress Bodenham, kept various kinds of powders and\r\nprescribed physic for ailing neighbors.[16] It was, however, if we may\r\nbelieve her defender, not on account of her prescriptions, but rather on\r\naccount of her refusal to swear falsely, that her downfall came. One\r\nwould be glad to know the name of the vigorous defender who after her\r\nexecution issued _A Declaration in Answer to severall lying Pamphlets\r\nconcerning the Witch of Wapping_. His narrative of the plot against the\r\naccused woman offers a plausible explanation of the affair and is not\r\nimprobably trustworthy. As he tells the story, there were certain\r\nrelatives of Lady Powell who had been disappointed that her estate had\r\nbeen bequeathed to Mrs. Anne Levingston. They conspired to get rid of\r\nthe heiress, went to a cunning woman, and offered to pay her liberally\r\nif she would swear that Mrs. Levingston had used sorcery to take away\r\nthe life of Lady Powell. Unfortunately for the conspirators, the cunning\r\nwoman betrayed their schemes. Not discouraged, however, they employed\r\nanother woman, who, as their representative, went to Joan Peterson and\r\noffered her a hundred pounds to swear that Mrs. Levingston had procured\r\nfrom her \"certain powders and bags of seeds.\" Joan refused the\r\nproposition, and the plotters, fearing a second exposure of their plans,\r\ndetermined that Mistress Peterson should also be put out of the way.\r\nThey were able to procure a warrant to have her arrested and searched.\r\nGreat pressure was put upon her to confess enough to implicate Mrs.\r\nLevingston and she was given to understand that if she would do so she\r\nwould herself be spared. But Joan refused their proffers and went to her\r\ntrial. If the narrative may be at all trusted there was little effort to\r\ngive her a fair hearing. Witnesses against her were purchased in\r\nadvance, strangers were offered money to testify against her, and those\r\nwho were to have given evidence on her side were most of them\r\nintimidated into staying away from the trial. Four physicians and two\r\nsurgeons signed a certificate that Lady Powell had died from perfectly\r\nnatural causes. It was of no avail. Joan was convicted and died bravely,\r\ndenying her guilt to the end.[17] Her defender avers that some of the\r\nmagistrates in the case were involved in the conspiracy against her. One\r\nof these was Sir John Danvers, a member of Cromwell's council. In the\r\nmargin of his account the pamphleteer writes: \"Sir John Danvers came and\r\ndined at the Sessions house and had much private discourse with the\r\nRecorder and many of the Justices and came and sate upon the Bench at\r\nher Trial, where he hath seldom or never been for these many years.\"\r\n\r\nIn July of 1652 occurred another trial that attracted notice in its own\r\ntime. Six Kentish women were tried at the assizes at Maidstone before\r\nPeter Warburton.[18] We know almost nothing of the evidence offered by\r\nthe prosecution save that there was exhibited in the Swan Inn at\r\nMaidstone a piece of flesh which the Devil was said to have given to one\r\nof the accused, and that a waxen image of a little girl figured in the\r\nevidence. Some of the accused confessed that they had used it in order\r\nto kill the child. Search was instituted for it, and it was found, if\r\nthe narrator may be trusted, under the door where the witches had said\r\nit would be.[19] The six were all condemned and suffered execution.\r\nSeveral others were arraigned, but probably escaped trial.\r\n\r\nIf the age was as \"censorious\" of things of this nature as Edmund Bower\r\nhad believed it to be, it is rather remarkable that \"these proceedings,\"\r\nwhich were within a short distance of London, excited so little stir in\r\nthat metropolis. Elias Ashmole, founder of the Ashmolean Museum at\r\nOxford and delver in astrology, attended the trials, with John\r\nTradescant, traveller and gardener.[20] He left no comments. The\r\n_Faithful Scout_, in its issue of July 30-August 7, mentioned the trial\r\nand the confessions, but refrained from any expression of opinion.\r\n\r\nThere were other trials in this period; but they must be passed over\r\nrapidly. The physicians were quite as busy as ever in suggesting\r\nwitchcraft. We can detect the hand of a physician in the attribution of\r\nthe strange illness of a girl who discharged great quantities of stones\r\nto the contrivance of Catherine Huxley, who was, in consequence, hanged\r\nat Worcester.[21] In a case at Exeter the physician was only indirectly\r\nresponsible. When Grace Matthews had consulted him about her husband's\r\nillness, he had apparently given up the case, and directed her to a wise\r\nwoman.[22] The wise woman had warned Mistress Matthews of a neighbor\r\n\"tall of stature and of a pale face and blinking eye,\" against whom it\r\nwould be well to use certain prescribed remedies. Mrs. Matthews did so,\r\nand roused out the witch, who proved to be a butcher's wife, Joan Baker.\r\nWhen the witch found her spells thwarted, she turned them against Mrs.\r\nMatthews's maid-servant, who in consequence died. This was part of the\r\nevidence against Joan, and it was confirmed by her own kinsfolk: her\r\nfather-in-law had seen her handling toads. She was committed, but we\r\nhear no more of the case.\r\n\r\nThat random accusations were not feared as they had been was evidenced\r\nby the boldness of suspected parties in bringing action against their\r\naccusers, even if boldness was sometimes misjudged. We have two actions\r\nof this sort.\r\n\r\nJoan Read of Devizes had been reported to be a witch, and on that\r\naccount had been refused by the bakers the privilege of using their\r\nbakeries for her dough.[23] She threw down the glove to her accusers by\r\ndemanding that they should be brought by warrant to accuse her. No doubt\r\nshe realized that she had good support in her community, and that her\r\nchallenge was not likely to be accepted. But a woman near Land's End in\r\nCornwall seems to have overestimated the support upon which she could\r\ncount. She had procured a warrant against her accusers to call the case\r\nbefore the mayor. The court sided with the accusers and the woman was\r\nbrought to trial. Caught herself, she proceeded to ensnare others. As a\r\nresult, eight persons were sent to Launceston,[24] and some probably\r\nsuffered death.[25]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen what a tangled web Mrs. Muschamp wove when she set\r\nout to imprison a colonel's wife. It would be easy to cite cases to show\r\nthe same reluctance to follow up prosecution. Four women at Leicester\r\nsearched Ann Chettle and found no evidence of guilt.[26] In Durham a\r\ncase came up before Justice Henry Tempest.[27] Mary Sykes was accused.\r\nSara Rodes, a child, awakening from sleep in a fright, had declared to\r\nher mother that \"Sikes' wife\" had come in \"att a hole att the bedd\r\nfeete\" and taken her by the throat. Of course Sara Rodes fell ill.\r\nMoreover, the witch had been seen riding at midnight on the back of a\r\ncow and at another time flying out of a \"mistall windowe.\" But the\r\nwoman, in spite of the unfavorable opinion of the women searchers, went\r\nfree. There were cases that seem to have ended the same way at York, at\r\nLeeds, and at Scarborough. They were hints of what we have already\r\nnoticed, that the northern counties were changing their attitude.[28]\r\nBut a case in Derbyshire deserves more attention because the justice,\r\nGervase Bennett, was one of the members of Cromwell's council. The case\r\nitself was not in any way unusual. A beggar woman, who had been\r\nliberally supported by those who feared her, was on trial for\r\nwitchcraft. Because of Bennett's close relation to the government, we\r\nshould be glad to know what he did with the case, but the fact that the\r\nwoman's conviction is not among the records makes it probable that she\r\nwas not bound over to the assizes.[29]\r\n\r\nWe come now to examine the second of the sub-periods into which we have\r\ndivided the Interregnum. We have been dealing with the interval between\r\nthe war and the establishment of the Protectorate, a time that shaded\r\noff from the dark shadows of internecine struggle towards the high light\r\nof steady peace and security. By 1653 the equilibrium of England had\r\nbeen restored. Cromwell's government was beginning to run smoothly. The\r\ncourts were in full swing. None of those conditions to which we have\r\nattributed the spread of the witch alarms of the Civil Wars were any\r\nlonger in operation. It is not surprising, then, that the Protectorate\r\nwas one of the most quiet periods in the annals of witchcraft. While the\r\nyears 1648-1653 had witnessed thirty executions in England, the period\r\nof the Protectorate saw but half a dozen, and three of these fell within\r\nthe somewhat disturbed rule of Richard Cromwell.[30] In other words,\r\nthere was a very marked falling off of convictions for witchcraft, a\r\nfalling off that had indeed begun before the year 1653. Yet this\r\ndiminution of capital sentences does not by any means signify that the\r\nrealm was rid of superstition. In Middlesex, in Somerset and Devon, in\r\nYork, Northumberland, and Cumberland, the attack upon witches on the\r\npart of the people was going on with undiminished vigor. If no great\r\ndiscoveries were made, if no nests of the pestilent creatures were\r\nunearthed, the justices of the peace were kept quite as busy with\r\nexaminations as ever before.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, an analysis of cases proves that a larger proportion of\r\nthose haled to court were light offenders, \"good witches\" whose healing\r\narts had perhaps been unsuccessful, dealers in magic who had aroused\r\nenvy or fear. The court records of Middlesex and York are full of\r\ncomplaints against the professional enchanters. In most instances they\r\nwere dismissed. Now and then a woman was sent to the house of\r\ncorrection,[31] but even this punishment was the exception.\r\n\r\nTwo other kinds of cases appeared with less frequency. We have one very\r\nclear instance at Wakefield, in York, where a quarrel between two tenant\r\nfarmers over their highway rights became so bitter that a chance threat\r\nuttered by the loser of the lawsuit, \"It shall be a dear day's work for\r\nyou,\" occasioned an accusation of witchcraft.[32] In another instance\r\nthe debt of a penny seems to have been the beginning of a hatred between\r\ntwo impecunious creatures, and this brought on a charge.[33]\r\n\r\nThe most common type of case, of course, was that where strange disease\r\nor death played a part. In Yorkshire, in Hertfordshire, and in Cornwall\r\nthere were trials based upon a sort of evidence with which the reader is\r\nalready quite familiar. It was easy for the morbid mother of a dead\r\nchild to recall or imagine angry words spoken to her shortly before the\r\ndeath of her offspring. It was quite as natural for a sick child to be\r\nalarmed at the sight of a visitor and go into spasms. There was no fixed\r\nrule, however, governing the relation of the afflicted children and the\r\npossible witches. When William Wade was named, Elizabeth Mallory would\r\nfly into fits.[34] When Jane Brooks entered the room, a bewitched youth\r\nof Chard would become hysterical.[35] It was the opposite way with a\r\nvictim in Exeter,[36] who remained well only so long as the witch who\r\ncaused the trouble stayed with him.[37]\r\n\r\nClosely related to these types of evidence was what has been denominated\r\nspectral evidence, a form of evidence recurrent throughout the history\r\nof English witchcraft. In the time of the Protectorate we have at least\r\nthree cases of the kind. The accused woman appeared to the afflicted\r\nindividual now in her own form, again in other shapes, as a cat, as a\r\nbee, or as a dog.[38] The identification of a particular face in the\r\nhead of a bee must have been a matter of some difficulty, but there is\r\nno ground for supposing that any objection was made to this evidence in\r\ncourt. At all events, the testimony went down on the official records in\r\nYorkshire. In Somerset the Jane Brooks case,[39] already referred to,\r\ncalled forth spectral evidence in a form that must really have been very\r\nconvincing. When the bewitched boy cried out that he saw the witch on\r\nthe wall, his cousin struck at the place, upon which the boy cried out,\r\n\"O Father, Coz Gibson hath cut Jane Brooks's hand, and 'tis bloody.\"\r\nNow, according to the story, the constable proceeded to the woman's\r\nhouse and found her hand cut.\r\n\r\nAs to the social status of the people involved in the Protectorate\r\ntrials there is little to say, other than has been said of many earlier\r\ncases. By far the larger number of those accused, as we have already\r\npointed out, were charmers and enchanters, people who made a penny here\r\nand twopence there, but who had at best a precarious existence. Some of\r\nthem, no doubt, traded on the fear they inspired in their communities\r\nand begged now a loaf of bread and now a pot of beer. They were the same\r\npeople who, when begging and enchanting failed, resorted to\r\nstealing.[40] In one of the Yorkshire depositions we have perhaps a hint\r\nof another class from which the witches were recruited. Katherine Earle\r\nstruck a Mr. Frank between the shoulders and said, \"You are a pretty\r\ngentleman; will you kisse me?\" When the man happened to die this\r\nsolicitation assumed a serious aspect.[41]\r\n\r\nWitchcraft was indeed so often the outcome of lower-class bickering that\r\ntrials involving the upper classes seem worthy of special record. During\r\nthe Protectorate there were two rather remarkable trials. In 1656\r\nWilliam and Mary Wade were accused of bewitching the fourteen-year-old\r\ndaughter of Elizabeth Mallory of Studley Hall. The Mallorys were a\r\nprominent family in Yorkshire. The grandfather of the accusing child had\r\nbeen a member of Parliament and was a well known Royalist colonel. When\r\nMistress Elizabeth declared that her fits would not cease until Mary\r\nWade had said that she had done her wrong, Mary Wade was persuaded to\r\nsay the words. Elizabeth was well at once, but Mary withdrew her\r\nadmission and Elizabeth resumed her fits, indeed \"she was paste\r\nholdinge, her extreamaty was such.\" She now demanded that the two Wades\r\nshould be imprisoned, and when they were \"both in holde\" she became well\r\nagain. They were examined by a justice of the peace, but were probably\r\nlet off.[42]\r\n\r\nThe story of Diana Crosse at Exeter is a more pathetic one. Mrs. Crosse\r\nhad once kept a girls' school--could it be that there was some\r\nconnection between teaching and witchcraft?[43]--had met with\r\nmisfortune, and had at length been reduced to beggary. We have no means\r\nof knowing whether the suspicion of witchcraft antedated her extreme\r\npoverty or not, but it seems quite clear that the former school-teacher\r\nhad gained an ill name in the community. She resented bitterly the\r\nattitude of the people, and at one time seems to have appealed to the\r\nmayor. It was perhaps by this very act that she focussed the suspicion\r\nof her neighbors. To go over the details of the trial is not worth\r\nwhile. Diana Crosse probably escaped execution to eke out the remainder\r\nof her life in beggary.[44]\r\n\r\nThe districts of England affected by the delusion during this period\r\nhave already been indicated. While there were random cases in Suffolk,\r\nHertfordshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Cumberland, and Northumberland, by\r\nfar the greatest activity seems to have been in Middlesex, Cornwall, and\r\nYorkshire. To a layman it looks as if the north of England had produced\r\nthe greater part of its folk-lore. Certain it is that the witch stories\r\nof Yorkshire, as those of Lancaster at another time, by their mysterious\r\nand romantic elements made the trials of the south seem flat, stale, and\r\nunprofitable. Yet they rarely had as serious results.\r\n\r\nTo the historian the Middlesex cases must be more interesting because\r\nthey should afford some index of the attitude of the central government.\r\nUnhappily we do not know the fate of the Yorkshire witches, though it\r\nhas been surmised, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they\r\nall escaped execution.[45] In Middlesex we know that during this period\r\nonly one woman, so far as our extant records go, was adjudged guilty.\r\nAll the rest were let go free. Now, this may be significant and it may\r\nnot. It does not seem unreasonable to suppose that the Middlesex quarter\r\nsessions were in harmony with the central government. Yet this can be no\r\nmore than a guess. It is not easy to take bearings which will locate the\r\nposition of the Cromwellian government. The protector himself was\r\noccupied with weightier matters, and, so far as we know, never uttered a\r\nword on the subject. He was almost certainly responsible for the pardon\r\nof Margaret Gyngell at Salisbury in 1655,[46] yet we cannot be sure that\r\nhe was not guided in that case by special circumstances as well as by\r\nthe recommendation of subordinates.\r\n\r\nWe have but little more evidence as to the attitude of his council of\r\nstate. It was three years before the Protectorate was put into operation\r\nthat the hesitating sheriff of Cumberland, who had some witches on his\r\nhands, was authorized to go ahead and carry out the law.[47] But on the\r\nother hand it was in the same period that the English commissioners in\r\nScotland put a quietus on the witch alarms in that kingdom. In fact, one\r\nof their first acts was to take over the accused women from the church\r\ncourts and demand the proof against them.[48] When it was found that\r\nthey had been tortured into confessions, the commission resolved upon\r\nan enquiry into the conduct of the sheriff, ministers, and tormentors\r\nwho had been involved. Several women had been accused. Not one was\r\ncondemned. The matter was referred to the council of state, where it\r\nseems likely that the action of the commissioners was ratified. Seven or\r\neight years later, in the administration of Richard Cromwell, there was\r\nan instance where the council, apparently of its own initiative, ordered\r\na party of soldiers to arrest a Rutlandshire witch. The case was,\r\nhowever, dismissed later.[49]\r\n\r\nTo draw a definite conclusion from these bits of evidence would be rash.\r\nWe can perhaps reason somewhat from the general attitude of the\r\ngovernment. Throughout the Protectorate there was a tendency, which\r\nCromwell encouraged, to mollify the rigor of the criminal law. Great\r\nnumbers of pardons were issued; and when Whitelocke suggested that no\r\noffences should be capital except murder, treason, and rebellion, no one\r\narose in holy horror to point out the exception of witchcraft,[50] and\r\nthe suggestion, though never acted upon, was favorably considered.[51]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider this general attitude towards crime in connection with\r\nwhat we have already indicated about the rapid decline in numbers of\r\nwitch convictions, it seems a safe guess that the Cromwellian\r\ngovernment, while not greatly interested in witchcraft, was, so far as\r\ninterested, inclined towards leniency.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Whitelocke, _Memorials_, III, 63, 97, 99, 113.\r\n\r\n[2] See an extract from the Guild Hall Books in John Fuller, _History of\r\nBerwick_ (Edinburgh, 1799), 155-156.\r\n\r\n[3] Thomas Widdrington's letter to Whitelocke (Whitelocke, _Memorials_,\r\nIII, 99). Widdrington said the man professed himself \"an artist that\r\nway.\" The writer was evidently somewhat skeptical.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[5] Ralph Gardiner, _England's Grievance Discovered in Relation to the\r\nCoal Trade_ (London, 1655), 108.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[7] See John Brand, _History and Antiquities of ... Newcastle_ (London,\r\n1789), II, 478, or the _Chronicon Mirabile_ (London, 1841), 92, for an\r\nextract from the parish registers, giving the names. A witch of rural\r\nNorthumberland was executed with them.\r\n\r\n[8] The witches of 1649 were not confined to the north. Two are said to\r\nhave been executed at St. Albans, a man and a woman; one woman was tried\r\nin Worcestershire, one at Gloucester, and two in Middlesex. John Palmer\r\nand Elizabeth Knott, who suffered at St. Albans, had gained some\r\nnotoriety. Palmer had contracted with the Devil and had persuaded his\r\nkinswoman to assist him in procuring the death of a woman by the use of\r\nclay pictures. Both were probably practitioners in magic. Palmer, even\r\nwhen in prison, claimed the power of transforming men into beasts. The\r\nwoman seems to have been put to the swimming test. Both were condemned.\r\nPalmer, at his execution, gave information about a \"whole colledge of\r\nwitches,\" most of them, no doubt, practisers like himself, but his\r\nrandom accusations were probably passed over. See _The Divels Delusions\r\nor A faithfull relation of John Palmer and Elizabeth Knott ..._ (1649).\r\n\r\n[9] Ralph Gardiner, _op. cit._, 109.\r\n\r\n[10] See _ibid._ At his execution, Gardiner says, he confessed that he\r\nhad been the death of 220 witches in Scotland and England.

It is impossible to understand the\r\nsignificance of the prosecutions without some acquaintance with the\r\ncourse of opinion on the subject. In this chapter we shall go back as\r\nfar as the opening of the reign of James and follow up to the end of the\r\nCommonwealth the special discussions of witchcraft, as well as some of\r\nthe more interesting incidental references. It will be recalled that\r\nJames's _Dæmonologie_ had come out several years before its author\r\nascended the English throne. With the coming of the Scottish king to\r\nWestminster the work was republished at London. But, while James by\r\nvirtue of his position was easily first among those who were writing on\r\nthe subject, he by no means occupied the stage alone. Not less than four\r\nother men gained a hearing within the reign and for that reason deserve\r\nconsideration. They were Perkins, Cotta, Roberts, and Cooper.\r\n\r\nWilliam Perkins's _Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft_ came first\r\nin order, indeed it was written during the last years of Elizabeth's\r\nreign; but it was not published until 1608, six years after the author's\r\ndeath.[1] William Perkins was a fellow of Christ's College at Cambridge\r\nand an eminent preacher in that university. He holds a high place among\r\nPuritan divines. His sermons may still be found in the libraries of\r\nolder clergymen and citations from them are abundant in commentaries. It\r\nwas in the course of one of his university sermons that he took up the\r\nmatter of witchcraft. In what year this sermon was preached cannot\r\ndefinitely be said. That he seems to have read Scot,[2] that however he\r\ndoes not mention King James's book,[3] are data which lead us to guess\r\nthat he may have uttered the discourse between 1584 and 1597. His point\r\nof view was strictly theological and his convictions grounded--as might\r\nbe expected--upon scriptural texts. Yet it seems not unfair to suppose\r\nthat he was an exponent of opinion at Cambridge, where we have already\r\nseen evidences of strong faith in the reality of witchcraft. It seems no\r\nless likely that a perusal of Reginald Scot's _Discoverie_ prompted the\r\nsermon. Witches nowadays, he admitted, have their patrons. His argument\r\nfor the existence of witches was so thoroughly biblical that we need not\r\ngo over it. He did not, however, hold to all current conceptions of\r\nthem. The power of the evil one to transform human beings into other\r\nshapes he utterly repudiated. The scratching of witches[4] and the\r\ntesting of them by water he thought of no value.[5] In this respect it\r\nwill be seen that he was in advance of his royal contemporary. About\r\nthe bodily marks, the significance of which James so emphasized, Perkins\r\nseems to have been less decided. He believed in the death penalty,[6]\r\nbut he warned juries to be very careful as to evidence.[7] Evidence\r\nbased upon the accusations of \"good witches,\" upon the statements of the\r\ndying, or upon the charges of those who had suffered ill after threats,\r\nhe thought ought to be used with great caution. It is evident that\r\nPerkins--though he doubtless would not have admitted it himself--was\r\naffected by the reading of Scot. Yet it is disappointing to find him\r\ncondoning the use of torture[8] in extreme instances.[9]\r\n\r\nA Cambridge man who wrote about a score of years after Perkins put forth\r\nopinions a good deal farther advanced. John Cotta was a \"Doctor in\r\nPhysicke\" at Northampton who had taken his B. A. at Cambridge in 1595,\r\nhis M. A. the following year, and his M. D. in 1603. Nine years after\r\nleaving Cambridge he had published _A Short Discoverie of the Unobserved\r\nDangers_, in which he had devoted a very thoughtful chapter to the\r\nrelation between witchcraft and sickness. In 1616 he elaborated his\r\nnotions in _The Triall of Witchcraft_,[10] published at London. Like\r\nPerkins he disapproved of the trial by water.[11] He discredited, too,\r\nthe evidence of marks, but believed in contracts with the Devil, and\r\ncited as illustrious instances the cases of Merlin and \"that infamous\r\nwoman,\" Joan of Arc.[12] But his point of view was of course mainly that\r\nof a medical man. A large number of accusations of witchcraft were due\r\nto the want of medical examination. Many so-called possessions could be\r\nperfectly diagnosed by a physician. He referred to a case where the\r\nsupposed witches had been executed and their victim had nevertheless\r\nfallen ill again.[13] Probably this was the case of Mistress Belcher, on\r\nwhose account two women had been hanged at Northampton.[14]\r\n\r\nYet Cotta believed that there were real witches and arraigned Scot for\r\nfailing to distinguish the impostors from the true.[15] It was indeed,\r\nhe admitted, very hard to discover, except by confession; and even\r\nconfession, as he had pointed out in his first work, might be a \"meane,\r\npoore and uncertain proofe,\" because of the Devil's power to induce\r\nfalse confession.[16] Here the theologian--it was hard for a\r\nseventeenth-century writer not to be a theologian--was cropping out. But\r\nthe scientific spirit came to the front again when he made the point\r\nthat imagination was too apt to color observations made upon bewitched\r\nand witch.[17] The suggestion that coincidence explained many of the\r\nalleged fulfillments of witch predictions[18] was equally in advance of\r\nhis times.\r\n\r\nHow, then, were real cases of bewitchment to be recognized? The best\r\nassurance on such matters, Cotta answered, came \"whensoever ... the\r\nPhysicion shall truely discover a manifest transcending power.\"[19] In\r\nother words, the Northampton physician believed that his own profession\r\ncould best determine these vexed matters. One who has seen the sorry\r\npart played by the physicians up to this time can hardly believe that\r\ntheir judgment on this point was saner than that of men in other\r\nprofessions. It may even be questioned if they were more to be depended\r\nupon than the so superstitious clergy.\r\n\r\nIn the same year as Cotta's second book, Alexander Roberts, \"minister of\r\nGod's word at King's Lynn\" in Norfolk, brought out _A Treatise of\r\nWitchcraft_ as a sort of introduction to his account of the trial of\r\nMary Smith of that town and as a justification of her punishment. The\r\nwork is merely a restatement of the conventional theology of that time\r\nas applied to witches, exactly such a presentation of it as was to be\r\nexpected from an up-country parson who had read Reginald Scot, and could\r\nwield the Scripture against him.[20]\r\n\r\nThe following year saw the publication of a work equally theological,\r\n_The Mystery of Witchcraft_, by the Reverend Thomas Cooper, who felt\r\nthat his part in discovering \"the practise of Anti-Christ in that\r\nhellish Plot of the Gunpowder-treason\" enabled him to bring to light\r\nother operations of the Devil. He had indeed some experience in this\r\nwork,[21] as well as some acquaintance with the writers on the subject.\r\nBut he adds nothing to the discussion unless it be the coupling of the\r\ndisbelief in witchcraft with the \"Atheisme and Irreligion that overflows\r\nthe land.\" Five years later the book was brought out again under another\r\ntitle, _Sathan transformed into an Angell of Light, ... [ex]emplified\r\nspecially in the Doctrine of Witchcraft_.\r\n\r\nIn the account of the trials for witchcraft in the reign of James I the\r\ndivorce case of the Countess of Essex was purposely omitted, because in\r\nit the question of witchcraft was after all a subordinate matter. In the\r\nhistory of opinion, however, the views about witchcraft expressed by the\r\ncourt that passed upon the divorce can by no means be ignored. It is not\r\nworth while to rehearse the malodorous details of that singular affair.\r\nThe petitioner for divorce made the claim that her husband was unable to\r\nconsummate the marriage with her and left it to be inferred that he was\r\nbewitched. It will be remembered that King James, anxious to further the\r\nplans of his favorite, Carr, was too willing to have the marriage\r\nannulled and brought great pressure to bear upon the members of the\r\ncourt. Archbishop Abbot from the beginning of the trial showed himself\r\nunfavorable to the petition of the countess, and James deemed it\r\nnecessary to resolve his doubts on the general grounds of the\r\ndivorce.[22] On the matter of witchcraft in particular the king wrote:\r\n\"for as sure as God is, there be Devils, and some Devils must have some\r\npower, and their power is in this world.... That the Devil's power is\r\nnot so universal against us, that I freely confess; but that it is\r\nutterly restrained _quoad nos_, how was then a minister of Geneva\r\nbewitched to death, and were the witches daily punished by our law. If\r\nthey can harm none but the papists, we are too charitable for avenging\r\nof them only.\" This was James's opinion in 1613, and it is worthy of\r\nnote that he was much less certain of his ground and much more on the\r\ndefensive about witchcraft than the author of the _Dæmonologie_ had\r\nbeen. It can hardly be doubted that he had already been affected by the\r\nmore liberal views of the ecclesiastics who surrounded him. Archbishop\r\nBancroft, who had waged through his chaplain the war on the exorcists,\r\nwas not long dead. That chaplain was now Bishop of Chichester and soon\r\nto become Archbishop of York. It would be strange if James had not been\r\naffected to some degree by their opinions. Moreover, by this time he had\r\nbegun his career as a discoverer of impostors.\r\n\r\nThe change in the king's position must, however, not be overrated. He\r\nmaintained his belief in witches and seemed somewhat apprehensive lest\r\nothers should doubt it. Archbishop Abbot, whom he was trying to win over\r\nto the divorce, would not have denied James's theories, but he was\r\nexceedingly cautious in his own use of the term _maleficium_. Abbot was\r\nwholly familiar with the history of the Anglican attitude towards\r\nexorcism. There can be little doubt that he was in sympathy with the\r\npolicy of his predecessor. It is therefore interesting to read his\r\ncarefully worded statement as to the alleged bewitchment of the Earl of\r\nEssex. In his speech defending his refusal and that of three colleagues\r\nto assent to the divorce, he wrote: \"One of my lords (my lord of\r\nWinchester) hath avowed it, that he dislikes that _maleficium_; that he\r\nhath read Del Rio, the Jesuit, writing upon that argument, and doth hold\r\nhim an idle and fabulous fellow.... Another of my lords (my lord of Ely)\r\nhath assented thereunto, and _maleficium_ must be gone. Now I for my\r\npart will not absolutely deny that witches by God's permission may have\r\na power over men, to hurt all, or part in them, as by God they shall be\r\nlimited; but how shall it appear that this is such a thing in the person\r\nof a man.\" This was not, of course, an expression of disbelief in the\r\nreality or culpability of witchcraft. It was an expression of great\r\nreluctance to lay much stress upon charges of witchcraft--an expression\r\nupon the part of the highest ecclesiastical authority in England.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles I prior to the Civil Wars we have to analyze but\r\na single contribution to the literature of our subject, that made by\r\nRichard Bernard. Bernard had preached in Nottinghamshire and had gone\r\nfrom there to Batcombe in Somerset. While yet in Nottinghamshire, in the\r\nearly years of James's reign, he had seen something of the\r\nexorcizers.[23] Later he had had to do with the Taunton cases of 1626;\r\nindeed, he seems to have had a prominent part in this affair.[24]\r\nPresumably he had displayed some anxiety lest the witches should not\r\nreceive fair treatment, for in his _Guide to Grand-Jurymen ... in cases\r\nof Witchcraft_, published in 1627, he explained the book as a \"plaine\r\ncountrey Minister's testimony.\" Owing to his \"upright meaning\" in his\r\n\"painstaking\" with one of the witches, a rumor had spread that he\r\nfavored witches or \"were of Master Scots erroneous opinion that Witches\r\nwere silly Melancholikes.\"[25] He had undertaken in consequence to\r\nfamiliarize himself with the whole subject and had read nearly all the\r\ndiscussions in English, as well as all the accounts of trials published\r\nup to that time. His work he dedicated to the two judges at Taunton, Sir\r\nJohn Walter and Sir John Denham, and to the archdeacon of Wells and the\r\nchancellor of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. The book was, indeed, a\r\ntruly remarkable patchwork. All shades of opinion from that of the\r\nearnestly disbelieving Scot to that of the earnestly believing Roberts\r\nwere embodied. Nevertheless Bernard had a wholesome distrust of\r\npossessions and followed Cotta in thinking that catalepsy and other\r\nrelated diseases accounted for many of them.[26] He thought, too, that\r\nthe Devil very often acted as his own agent without any\r\nintermediary.[27] Like Cotta, he was skeptical as to the water\r\nordeal;[28] but, strange to say, he accepted the use of a magical glass\r\nto discover \"the suspected.\"[29] He was inclined to believe that the\r\n\"apparition of the party suspected, whom the afflicted in their fits\r\nseem to see,\" was a ground for suspicion. The main aim of his discourse\r\nwas, indeed, to warn judges and jurors to be very careful by their\r\nquestions and methods of inquiring to separate the innocent from the\r\nguilty.[30] In this contention, indeed in his whole attitude, he was\r\nvery nearly the mouthpiece of an age which, while clinging to a belief,\r\nwas becoming increasingly cautious of carrying that belief too far into\r\njudicial trial and punishment.[31]\r\n\r\nIt is a jump of seventeen years from Bernard of Batcombe to John Gaule.\r\nIt cannot be said that Gaule marks a distinct step in the progress of\r\nopinion beyond Bernard. His general position was much the same as that\r\nof his predecessor. His warnings were perhaps more earnest, his\r\nskepticism a little more apparent. In an earlier chapter we have\r\nobserved the bold way in which the indignant clergyman of\r\nHuntingdonshire took up Hopkins's challenge in 1646. It was the Hopkins\r\ncrusade that called forth his treatise.[32] His little book was in large\r\npart a plea for more caution in the use of evidence. Suspicion was too\r\nlightly entertained against \"every poore and peevish olde Creature.\"\r\nWhenever there was an extraordinary accident, whenever there was a\r\ndisease that could not be explained, it was imputed to witchcraft. Such\r\n\"Tokens of Tryall\" he deemed \"altogether unwarrantable, as proceeding\r\nfrom ignorance, humor, superstition.\" There were other more reliable\r\nindications by which witches could sometimes be detected, but those\r\nindications were to be used with exceeding caution. Neither the evidence\r\nof the fact--that is, of a league with the Devil--without confession\r\nnor \"confession without fact\" was to be accounted as certain proof. On\r\nthe matter of confession Gaule was extraordinarily skeptical for his\r\ntime. It was to be considered whether the party confessing were not\r\ndiabolically deluded, whether the confession were not forced, or whether\r\nit were not the result of melancholy. Gaule went even a little further.\r\nNot only was he inclined to suspect confession, but he had serious\r\ndoubts about a great part of witch lore. There were stories of\r\nmetamorphoses, there were narratives of \"tedious journeys upon broomes,\"\r\nand a hundred other tales from old authors, which the wise Christian\r\nwould, he believed, leave with the writers. To believe nothing of them,\r\nhowever, would be to belittle the Divine attributes. As a matter of fact\r\nthere was a very considerable part of the witch theory that Gaule\r\naccepted. His creed came to this: it was unsafe to pronounce such and\r\nsuch to be witches. While not one in ten was guilty, the tenth was still\r\nto be accounted for.[33] The physician Cotta would have turned the\r\nmatter over to the physicians; the clergyman Gaule believed that it\r\nbelonged to the province of the \"Magistracy and Ministery.\"[34]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the Commonwealth one would have supposed that\r\nintellectual men would be entirely preoccupied with more weighty\r\nmatters than the guilt of witches. But the many executions that followed\r\nin the wake of Hopkins and Stearne had invested the subject with a new\r\ninterest and brought new warriors into the fray. Half a dozen writers\r\ntook up the controversy. On the conservative side three names deserve\r\nmention, two of them not unknown in other connections, Henry More and\r\nMeric Casaubon. For the defence of the accused witches appeared two men\r\nhardly so well known in their time, Robert Filmer and Thomas Ady.\r\n\r\nMore was a young Cambridge scholar and divine who was to take rank among\r\nthe English philosophers of the seventeenth century. Grounded in Plato\r\nand impregnated with Descartes, he became a little later thoroughly\r\ninfected with the Cabalistic philosophy that had entered Europe from the\r\nEast. It was the point of view that he acquired in the study of this\r\nmystic Oriental system that gave the peculiar turn to his witchcraft\r\nnotions, a turn which through his own writings and those of Glanvill\r\nfound wide acceptance. It was in 1653 that More issued _An Antidote to\r\nAtheisme_. The phenomena of witchcraft he reckoned as part of the\r\nevidence for the reality of the spirit world and used them to support\r\nreligion, quite in the same manner as Sir Oliver Lodge or Professor\r\nHyslop would today use psychical research to establish immortality. More\r\nhad made investigations for himself, probably at Maidstone. In his own\r\ntown of Cambridge there was a story--doubtless a college joke, but he\r\nreferred to it in all seriousness--of \"Old Strangridge,\" who \"was\r\ncarried over Shelford Steeple upon a black Hogge and tore his breeches\r\nupon the weather-cock.\"[35] He believed that he had absolute proof of\r\nthe \"nocturnal conventicles\" of witches.[36] He had, however, none of\r\nthat instinct for scientific observation that had distinguished Scot,\r\nand his researches did not prevent his being easily duped. His\r\nobservations are not by any means so entertaining as are his theories.\r\nHis effort to account for the instantaneous transportation of witches is\r\none of the bright spots in the prosy reasonings of the demonologists.\r\nMore was a thoroughgoing dualist. Mind and matter were the two separate\r\nentities. Now, the problem that arose at once was this: How can the\r\nsouls of witches leave their bodies? \"I conceive,\" he says, \"the Divell\r\ngets into their body and by his subtile substance more operative and\r\nsearching than any fire or putrifying liquor, melts the yielding\r\nCampages of the body to such a consistency ... and makes it plyable to\r\nhis imagination: and then it is as easy for him to work it into what\r\nshape he pleaseth.\"[37] If he could do that, much more could he enable\r\nmen to leave their bodies. Then arose the problem: How does this process\r\ndiffer from death? The writer was puzzled apparently at his own\r\nquestion, but reasoned that death was the result of the unfitness of the\r\nbody to contain the soul.[38] But no such condition existed when the\r\nDevil was operating; and no doubt the body could be anointed in such\r\nfashion that the soul could leave and return.\r\n\r\nMeric Casaubon, son of the eminent classical scholar and himself a well\r\nknown student, was skeptical as to the stories told about the aerial\r\njourneys of witches which More had been at such pains to explain. It was\r\na matter, he wrote in his _Treatise concerning Enthusiasme_,[39] of much\r\ndispute among learned men. The confessions made were hard to account\r\nfor, but he would feel it very wrong to condemn the accused upon that\r\nevidence. We shall meet with Casaubon again.[40]\r\n\r\nNathaniel Homes, who wrote from his pastoral study at Mary Stayning's in\r\nLondon, and dedicated his work[41] to Francis Rous, member of\r\nParliament, was no halfway man. He was a thoroughgoing disciple of\r\nPerkins. His utmost admission--the time had come when one had to make\r\nsome concessions--was that evil spirits performed many of their wonders\r\nby tricks of juggling.[42] But he swallowed without effort all the\r\nnonsense about covenants, and was inclined to see in the activities of\r\nthe Devil a presage of the last days.[43]\r\n\r\nThe reader can readily see that More, Casaubon, and Homes were all on\r\nthe defensive. They were compelled to offer explanations of the\r\nmysteries of witchcraft, they were ready enough to make admissions; but\r\nthey were nevertheless sticking closely to the main doctrines. It is a\r\npleasure to turn to the writings of two men of somewhat bolder stamp,\r\nRobert Filmer and Thomas Ady. Sir Robert Filmer was a Kentish knight of\r\nstrong royalist views who had written against the limitations of\r\nmonarchy and was not afraid to cross swords with Milton and Hobbes on\r\nthe origin of government. In 1652 he had attended the Maidstone trials,\r\nwhere, it will be remembered, six women had been convicted. As Scot had\r\nbeen stirred by the St. Oses trials, so Filmer was wrought up by what he\r\nhad seen at Maidstone,[44] and in the following year he published his\r\n_Advertisement to the Jurymen of England_. He set out to overturn the\r\ntreatise of Perkins. As a consequence he dealt with Scripture and the\r\ninterpretation of the well known passages in the Old Testament. The\r\nHebrew witch, Filmer declared, was guilty of nothing more than \"lying\r\nprophecies.\" The Witch of Endor probably used \"hollow speaking.\" In this\r\nsuggestion Filmer was following his famous Kentish predecessor.[45] But\r\nFilmer's main interest, like Bernard's and Gaule's before him, was to\r\nwarn those who had to try cases to be exceedingly careful. He felt that\r\na great part of the evidence used was worth little or nothing.\r\n\r\nThomas Ady's _Candle in the Dark_ was published three years later.[48]\r\nEven more than Filmer, Ady was a disciple of Scot. But he was, indeed, a\r\nstudent of all English writers on the subject and set about to answer\r\nthem one by one. King James, whose book he persistently refused to\r\nbelieve the king's own handiwork, Cooper, who was a \"bloudy persecutor,\"\r\nGifford, who \"had more of the spirit of truth in him than many,\"\r\nPerkins, the arch-enemy, Gaule, whose \"intentions were godly,\" but who\r\nwas too far \"swayed by the common tradition of men,\"[47] all of them\r\nwere one after another disposed of. Ady stood eminently for good sense.\r\nIt was from that point of view that he ridiculed the water ordeal and\r\nthe evidence of marks,[48] and that he attacked the cause and effect\r\nrelation between threats and illness. \"They that make this Objection\r\nmust dwell very remote from Neighbours.\"[49]\r\n\r\nYet not even Ady was a downright disbeliever. He defended Scot from the\r\nreport \"that he held an opinion that Witches are not, for it was neither\r\nhis Tenent nor is it mine.\" Alas, Ady does not enlighten us as to just\r\nwhat was his opinion. Certainly his witches were creatures without\r\npower.[50] What, then, were they? Were they harmless beings with\r\nmalevolent minds? Mr. Ady does not answer.\r\n\r\nA hundred years of witchcraft history had not brought to light a man who\r\nwas willing to deny in a printed work the existence of witches.\r\nDoubtless such denial might often have been heard in the closet, but it\r\nwas never proclaimed on the housetop. Scot had not been so bold--though\r\none imagines that if he had been quietly questioned in a corner he might\r\nhave denied the thing _in toto_--and those who had followed in his steps\r\nnever ventured beyond him.\r\n\r\nThe controversy, indeed, was waged in most of its aspects along the\r\nlines laid down by the first aggressor. Gifford, Cotta, and Ady had\r\nbrought in a few new arguments to be used in attacking superstition, but\r\nin general the assailants looked to Scot. On the other side, only\r\nPerkins and More had contributed anything worth while to the defence\r\nthat had been built up. Yet, the reader will notice that there had been\r\nprogress. The centre of struggle had shifted to a point within the outer\r\nwalls. The water ordeal and the evidence of marks were given up by most,\r\nif not all. The struggle now was over the transportation of witches\r\nthrough the air and the battle was going badly for the defenders.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the incidental indications of the shifting of opinion. In\r\none sense this sort of evidence means more than the formal literature.\r\nYet its fragmentary character at best precludes putting any great stress\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nIf one were to include all the references to witchcraft in the drama of\r\nthe period, this discussion might widen out into a long chapter. Over\r\nthe passages in the playwrights we must pass with haste; but certain\r\npoints must be noted. Shakespeare, in _Macbeth_, which scholars have\r\nusually placed at about 1606, used a great body of witch lore. He used\r\nit, too, with apparent good faith, though to conclude therefrom that he\r\nbelieved in it himself would be a most dangerous step.[51] Thomas\r\nMiddleton, whose _Witch_ probably was written somewhat later, and who is\r\nthought to have drawn on Shakespeare for some of his witch material,\r\ngives absolutely no indication in that play that he did not credit those\r\ntales of witch performances of which he availed himself. The same may be\r\nsaid of Dekker and of those who collaborated with him in writing _The\r\nWitch of Edmonton_.[52]\r\n\r\nWe may go further and say that in none of these three plays is there any\r\nhint that there were disbelievers. But when we come to Ben Jonson we\r\nhave a different story. His various plays we cannot here take up.\r\nSuffice it to say, on the authority of careful commentators, that he\r\nopenly or covertly ridiculed all the supposedly supernatural phenomena\r\nof his time.[53] Perhaps a search through the obscurer dramatists of the\r\nperiod might reveal other evidences of skepticism. Such a search we\r\ncannot make. It must, however, be pointed out that Thomas Heywood, in\r\n_The late Lancashire Witches_[54] a play which is described at some\r\nlength in an earlier chapter, makes a character say:[55] \"It seemes then\r\nyou are of opinion that there are witches. For mine own part I can\r\nhardly be induc'd to think there is any such kinde of people.\"[56] The\r\nspeech is the more notable because Heywood's own belief in witchcraft,\r\nas has been observed in another connection, seems beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nThe interest in witchcraft among literary men was not confined to the\r\ndramatists. Three prose writers eminent in their time dealt with the\r\nquestion. Burton, in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_[57] admits that \"many\r\ndeny witches at all, or, if there be any, they can do no harm.\" But he\r\nsays that on the other side are grouped most \"Lawyers, Divines,\r\nPhysitians, Philosophers.\" James Howell, famous letter-writer of the\r\nmid-century, had a similar reverence for authority: \"I say ... that he\r\nwho denies there are such busy Spirits and such poor passive Creatures\r\nupon whom they work, which commonly are call'd Witches ... shews that he\r\nhimself hath a Spirit of Contradiction in him.\"[58] There are, he says,\r\nlaws against witches, laws by Parliament and laws in the Holy Codex.\r\n\r\nFrancis Osborne, a literary man whose reputation hardly survived his\r\ncentury, but an essayist of great fame in his own time,[59] was a man\r\nwho made his fortune by sailing against rather than with the wind. It\r\nwas conventional to believe in witches and Osborne would not for any\r\nconsideration be conventional. He assumed the skeptical attitude,[60]\r\nand perhaps was as influential as any one man in making that attitude\r\nfashionable.\r\n\r\nFrom these lesser lights of the literary world we may pass to notice the\r\nattitude assumed by three men of influence in their own day, whose\r\nreputations have hardly been dimmed by time, Bacon, Selden, and Hobbes.\r\nNot that their views would be representative of their times, for each of\r\nthe three men thought in his own way, and all three were in many\r\nrespects in advance of their day. At some time in the reign of James I\r\nFrancis Bacon wrote his _Sylva Sylvarum_ and rather incidentally touched\r\nupon witchcraft. He warned judges to be wary about believing the\r\nconfessions of witches and the evidence against them. \"For the witches\r\nthemselves are imaginative and believe oft-times they do that which they\r\ndo not; and people are credulous in that point, and ready to impute\r\naccidents and natural operations to witchcraft. It is worthy the\r\nobserving, that ... the great wonders which they tell, of carrying in\r\nthe air, transporting themselves into other bodies, &c., are still\r\nreported to be wrought, not by incantations, or ceremonies, but by\r\nointments, and anointing themselves all over. This may justly move a man\r\nto think that these fables are the effects of imagination.\"[61]\r\n\r\nSurely all this has a skeptical sound. Yet largely on the strength of\r\nanother passage, which has been carelessly read, the great Bacon has\r\nbeen tearfully numbered among the blindest leaders of the blind.[62] A\r\ncareful comparison of his various allusions to witchcraft will convince\r\none that, while he assumed a belief in the practice,[63] partly perhaps\r\nin deference to James's views,[64] he inclined to explain many reported\r\nphenomena from the effects of the imagination[65] and from the operation\r\nof \"natural causes\" as yet unknown.[66]\r\n\r\nBacon, though a lawyer and man of affairs, had the point of view of a\r\nphilosopher. With John Selden we get more directly the standpoint of a\r\nlegal man. In his _Table Talk_[67] that eminent jurist wrote a paragraph\r\non witches. \"The Law against Witches,\" he declared, \"does not prove\r\nthere be any; but it punishes the Malice of those people that use such\r\nmeans to take away mens Lives. If one should profess that by turning his\r\nHat thrice and crying Buz, he could take away a man's life (though in\r\ntruth he could do no such thing) yet this were a just Law made by the\r\nState, that whosoever should turn his Hat thrice and cry Buz, with an\r\nintention to take away a man's life, shall be put to death.\"[68] As to\r\nthe merits of this legal quip the less said the better; but it is\r\nexceedingly hard to see in the passage anything but downright skepticism\r\nas to the witch's power.[69]\r\n\r\nIt is not without interest that Selden's point of view was exactly that\r\nof the philosopher Hobbes. There is no man of the seventeenth century,\r\nunless it be Oliver Cromwell or John Milton, whose opinion on this\r\nsubject we would rather know than that of Hobbes. In 1651 Hobbes had\r\nissued his great _Leviathan_. It is unnecessary here to insist upon the\r\nwidespread influence of that work. Let it be said, however, that Hobbes\r\nwas not only to set in motion new philosophies, but that he had been\r\ntutor to Prince Charles[70] and was to become a figure in the reign of\r\nthat prince.[71] Hobbes's work was directed against superstition in many\r\nforms, but we need only notice his statement about witchcraft, a\r\nstatement that did not by any means escape his contemporaries. \"As for\r\nWitches,\" he wrote, \"I think not that their witchcraft is any reall\r\npower; but yet that they are justly punished for the false beliefe they\r\nhave that they can do such mischief, joined with their purpose to do it\r\nif they can.\"[72] Perhaps the great philosopher had in mind those\r\npretenders to diabolic arts who had suffered punishment, and was so\r\ndefending the community that had rid itself of a preying class. In any\r\ncase, while he defended the law, he put himself among the disbelievers\r\nin witchcraft.\r\n\r\nFrom these opinions of the great we may turn to mark the more trivial\r\nindications of the shifting of opinion to be found in the pamphlet\r\nliterature. It goes without saying that the pamphlet-writers believed in\r\nthat whereof they spoke. It is not in their outspoken faith that we are\r\ninterested, but rather in their mention of those opponents at whose\r\nnumbers they marvelled, and whose incredulity they undertook to shake.\r\nNowhere better than in the prefaces of the pamphleteers can evidence be\r\nfound of the growing skepticism. The narrator of the Northampton cases\r\nin 1612 avowed it his purpose in writing to convince the \"many that\r\nremaine yet in doubt whether there be any Witches or no.\"[73] That\r\nardent busybody, Mr. Potts, who reported the Lancaster cases of 1612,\r\nvery incidentally lets us know that the kinsfolk and friends of Jennet\r\nPreston, who, it will be remembered, suffered at York, declared the\r\nwhole prosecution to be an act of malice.[74] The Yorkshire poet and\r\ngentleman, Edward Fairfax, who made such an ado about the sickness of\r\nhis two daughters in 1622 and would have sent six creatures to the\r\ngallows for it, was very frank in describing the opposition he met. The\r\naccused women found supporters among the \"best able and most\r\nunderstanding.\"[75] There were, he thought, three kinds of people who\r\nwere doubters in these matters: those who attributed too much to natural\r\ncauses and who were content to call clear cases of bewitchment\r\nconvulsions, those who when witchcraft was broached talked about fairies\r\nand \"walking ghosts,\" and lastly those who believed there were no\r\nwitches. \"Of this opinion I hear and see there be many, some of them men\r\nof worth, religious and honest.\"[76]\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet-writers of James's reign had adjusted themselves to meet\r\nopposition. Those of the Civil Wars and the Commonwealth were prepared\r\nto meet ridicule.[77] \"There are some,\" says the narrator of a Yorkshire\r\nstory, \"who are of opinion that there are no Divells nor any witches....\r\nMen in this Age are grown so wicked, that they are apt to believe there\r\nare no greater Divells than themselves.\"[78] Another writer, to bolster\r\nup his story before a skeptical public, declares that he is \"very chary\r\nand hard enough to believe passages of this nature.\"[79]\r\n\r\nWe have said that the narrators of witch stories fortified themselves\r\nagainst ridicule. That ridicule obviously must have found frequent\r\nexpression in conversation, but sometimes it even crept into the\r\nnewspapers and tracts of the day. The Civil Wars had developed a regular\r\nLondon press. We have already met with expressions of serious opinion\r\nfrom it.[80] But not all were of that sort. In 1654 the _Mercurius\r\nDemocritus_, the _Punch_ of its time, took occasion to make fun of the\r\nstories of the supernatural then in circulation. There was, it declared,\r\na strange story of a trance and apparition, a ghost was said to be\r\nabroad, a woman had hanged herself in a tobacco pipe. With very broad\r\nhumor the journal took off the strange reports of the time and concluded\r\nwith the warning that in \"these distempered times\" it was not safe for\r\nan \"idle-pated woman\" to look up at the skies.[81]\r\n\r\nThe same mocking incredulity had manifested itself in 1648 in a little\r\nbrochure entitled, _The Devil seen at St. Albans, Being a true Relation\r\nhow the Devill was seen there in a Cellar, in the likeness of a Ram; and\r\nhow a Butcher came and cut his throat, and sold some of it, and dressed\r\nthe rest for himselfe, inviting many to supper, who did eat of it_.[82]\r\nThe story was a clever parody of the demon tracts that had come out so\r\nfrequently in the exciting times of the wars. The writer made his point\r\nclear when he declared that his story was of equal value with anything\r\nthat \"Britannicus\" ever wrote.[83] The importance of these indications\r\nmay be overestimated. But they do mean that there were those bold enough\r\nto make fun. A decade or two later ridicule became a two-edged knife,\r\ncutting superstition right and left. But even under the terribly serious\r\nPuritans skepticism began to avail itself of that weapon, a weapon of\r\nwhich it could hardly be disarmed.\r\n\r\nIn following the history of opinion we must needs mention again some of\r\nthe incidents of certain cases dealt with in earlier chapters, incidents\r\nthat indicate the growing force of doubt. The reader has hardly\r\nforgotten the outcome of the Lancashire cases in 1633. There Bishop\r\nBridgeman and the king, if they did not discredit witchcraft,\r\ndiscredited its manifestation in the particular instance.[84] As for\r\nWilliam Harvey, he had probably given up his faith in the whole business\r\nafter the little incident at Newmarket.[85] When we come to the time of\r\nthe Civil Wars we cannot forget that Stearne and Hopkins met\r\nopposition, not alone from the Huntingdon minister, but from a large\r\nparty in Norfolk, who finally forced the witchfinder to defend himself\r\nin court. Nor can we forget the witch-pricker of Berwick who was sent\r\na-flying back to his native northern soil, nor the persistent Mrs.\r\nMuschamp who tramped over Northumberland seeking a warrant and finding\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe course of opinion is a circuitous one. We have followed its windings\r\nin and out through more than half a century. We have listened as\r\nrespectfully as possible to the vagaries of country parsons and\r\nuniversity preachers, we have heard from scholars, from gentlemen, from\r\njurists and men of affairs, from physicians and philosophers. It matters\r\nlittle now what they thought or said, but it did matter then. We have\r\nseen how easy a thing it was to fall into the error that a middle course\r\nwas nearest truth. Broad was the way and many there were that walked\r\ntherein. Yet even those who travelled that highway found their direction\r\nshifting. For there was progress in opinion. With every decade the\r\ntravellers, as well those who strayed aside as those who followed the\r\ncrowd, were getting a little nearer to truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Printed by Cantrel Legge, Printer to the Universitie of Cambridge\"\r\n(1608, 1610).\r\n\r\n[2] See _Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft_, ch.

He had read, too, several of the\r\nbooks on the subject, such as Scot, Wier, and Perkins. His omission of\r\nKing James's work is therefore not only curious but significant.

That Gaule was a Puritan, as has been asserted,\r\nappears from nothing in his book. If he dedicated his _Select Cases_ to\r\nhis townsman Colonel Walton, a brother-in-law of Cromwell, and his\r\n_Mag-astro-mancer_ (a later diatribe against current superstitions) to\r\nOliver himself, there is nothing in his prefatory letters to show him of\r\ntheir party. Nor does the tone of his writings suggest a Calvinist. That\r\nin 1649 we find Gaule chosen to preach before the assizes of Huntingdon\r\npoints perhaps only to his popularity as a leader of the reaction\r\nagainst the work of Hopkins.\r\n\r\n[35] _Antidote to Atheisme_, 129.\r\n\r\n[36] _Ibid._, 127-130.\r\n\r\n[37] _Ibid._, ch.

Four years\r\nlater, in 1659, he published _A True and faithful Relation of what\r\npassed ... between Dr. John Dee, ... and some spirits_. In the preface\r\nto this he announced his intention of writing the work which he later\r\npublished as _Of Credulity and Incredulity_.\r\n\r\n[40] In passing we must mention Richard Farnworth, who in 1655 issued a\r\npamphlet called _Witchcraft Cast out from the Religious Seed and Israel\r\nof God_. Farnworth was a Quaker, and wrote merely to warn his brethren\r\nagainst magic and sorcery. He never questioned for a moment the facts of\r\nwitchcraft and sorcery, nor the Devil's share in them. As for the\r\nwitches, they were doomed everlastingly to the lake of fire.\r\n\r\n[41] _Dæmonologie and Theologie.

He adds, \"Mr. Gaule, if this work of mine\r\nshall come to your hand, as yours hath come to mine, be not angry with\r\nme for writing God's Truth.\"\r\n\r\n[48] \"... few men or women being tied hand and feet together can sink\r\nquite away till they be drowned\" (_Candle in the Dark_, 100); \"... very\r\nfew people in the World are without privie Marks\" (_Ibid._, 127).\r\n\r\n[49] _Ibid._, 129.\r\n\r\n[50] In giving \"The Reason of the Book\" he wrote, \"The Grand Errour of\r\nthese latter Ages is ascribing power to Witches.\"\r\n\r\n[51] See a recent discussion of a nearly related topic by Professor\r\nElmer Stoll in the _Publications_ of the Modern Language Association,\r\nXXII, 201-233. Of the attitude of the English dramatists before\r\nShakespeare something may be learned from Mr. L. W. Cushman's _The Devil\r\nand the Vice in the English Dramatic Literature before Shakespeare_\r\n(Halle, 1900).\r\n\r\n[52] About 1622 or soon after.\r\n\r\n[53] See, for instance, Mr. W. S. Johnson's introduction to his edition\r\nof _The Devil is an Ass_ (New York, 1905).\r\n\r\n[54] 1634. This play was written, of course, in cooperation with Brome;\r\nsee above, pp. 158-160. For other expressions of Heywood's opinions on\r\nwitchcraft see his _Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels_, 598, and his\r\n[Greek: GYNAIKEION]: _or Nine Books of Various History concerning Women_\r\n(London, 1624), lib. viii, 399, 407, etc.\r\n\r\n[55] Act I, scene 1.\r\n\r\n[56] In another part of the same scene: \"They that thinke so dreame,\"\r\n_i. e._ they who believe in witchcraft.\r\n\r\n[57] First published in 1621--I use, however, Shilleto's ed. of London,\r\n1893, which follows that of 1651-1652; see pt.

It is very entertaining. His strongly enforced\r\nadvice not to marry made a sensation among young Oxford men.\r\n\r\n[60] _Works of Francis Osborne_ (London, 1673), 551-553.\r\n\r\n[61] _Works of Bacon_ (ed.

X, 975, in _Works_, ed. Spedding, II, 664. But even\r\nthis passage shows Bacon a skeptic. His suggestion that the soporiferous\r\nmedicines are likest to do it means that he thinks the delusions of\r\nwitches subjective and produced by drugs.

And they were believed by many intelligent men. He who\r\nruns through Whitelocke's _Memorials_ may read that the man was\r\nexceeding superstitious. Whether it be the report of the horseman seen\r\nin the air or the stories of witches at Berwick, Whitelocke was equally\r\ninterested. While he was merely recording the reports of others, there\r\nis not a sign of skepticism.\r\n\r\n[84] See above, pp. 152-157.\r\n\r\n[85] See above, pp. 160-162.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT UNDER CHARLES II AND JAMES II.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo period of English history saw a wider interest in both the theory and\r\nthe practice of witchcraft than the years that followed the Restoration.\r\nThroughout the course of the twenty-eight years that spanned the second\r\nrule of the Stuarts, the Devil manifested himself in many forms and with\r\nunusual frequency. Especially within the first half of that régime his\r\nappearances were so thrilling in character that the enemies of the new\r\nking might very well have said that the Evil One, like Charles, had come\r\nto his own again. All over the realm the witches were popping up. If the\r\ntotal number of trials and of executions did not foot up to the figures\r\nof James I's reign or to those of the Civil War, the alarm was\r\nnevertheless more widely distributed than ever before. In no less than\r\ntwenty counties of England witches were discovered and fetched to court.\r\nUp to this time, so far at any rate as the printed records show, the\r\nsouthwestern counties had been but little troubled. Now Somerset, Devon,\r\nand Cornwall were the storm centre of the panic. In the north Yorkshire\r\nbegan to win for itself the reputation as a centre of activity that had\r\nlong been held by Lancashire. Not that the witch was a new criminal in\r\nYorkshire courts. During the Civil Wars and the troubled years that\r\nfollowed the discoverers had been active. But with the reign of Charles\r\nII their zeal increased mightily. Yet, if they had never before fetched\r\nin so many \"suspected parties\" to the court of the justice of the\r\npeace, they had never before been so often baffled by the outcome. Among\r\nthe many such cases known to us during this time there is no mention of\r\na conviction.[1] In Kent there was a flickering revival of the old\r\nhatred of witches. In the year that Charles gained the throne the city\r\nof Canterbury sent some women to the gibbet. Not so in Essex. In that\r\ncounty not a single case during this period has been left on record. In\r\nMiddlesex, a county which from the days of Elizabeth through to the\r\nRestoration had maintained a very even pace--a stray conviction now and\r\nthen among many acquittals--the reign of Charles II saw nothing more\r\nserious than some commitments and releases upon bail. In the Midland\r\ncounties, where superstition had flourished in the days of James I,\r\nthere were now occasional tales of possession and vague charges which\r\nrarely reached the ears of the assize judges. Northampton, where an\r\nincendiary witch was sentenced, constituted the single exception. In\r\nEast Anglia there was just enough stir to prove that the days of Matthew\r\nHopkins had not been forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt needs no pointing out that a large proportion of the cases were but a\r\nrepetition of earlier trials. If a difference is discernible, it is in\r\nthe increased number of accusations that took their start in strange\r\ndiseases called possessions. Since the close of the sixteenth century\r\nand the end of John Darrel's activities, the accounts of possession had\r\nfallen off sensibly, but the last third of the seventeenth century saw a\r\ndistinct revival of this tendency to assign certain forms of disease to\r\nthe operation of the Devil. We have references to many cases, but only\r\nin exceptional instances are the details given. Oliver Heywood, one of\r\nthe eminent Dissenters of northern England, fasted and prayed with his\r\nco-workers over the convulsive and hysterical boys and girls in the West\r\nRiding. Nathan Dodgson was left after long fastings in \"a very sensible\r\nmelting frame,\"[2] but the troubles returned and led, as we shall see in\r\nanother connection, to very tragic results. The Puritan clergymen do not\r\nseem, however, to have had any highly developed method of exorcism or to\r\nhave looked upon cases of possession in a light very different from that\r\nin which they would have looked upon ordinary illnesses.\r\n\r\nAmong the Baptists of Yorkshire there was a possession that roused wide\r\ncomment. Mary Hall of Little Gaddesden in Hertfordshire, daughter of a\r\nsmith, was possessed in the fall of 1663 with two spirits who were said\r\nto have come to her riding down the chimney upon a stick. The spirits\r\ndeclared through the girl that Goodwife Harwood had sent them, and when\r\nthat suspected woman was brought into the girl's presence the spirits\r\ncried out, \"Oh, Goodwife Harwood, are you come?--that is well; ... we\r\nhave endeavored to choak her but cannot,\" and, when Mistress Harwood\r\nleft, the spirits begged to go with her.[3]\r\n\r\nIn Southwark James Barrow, the son of John Barrow, was long possessed,\r\nand neither \"doctors, astrologers, nor apothecaries\" could help him. He\r\nwas taken to the Catholics, but to no purpose. Finally he was cast among\r\na \"poor dispirited people whom the Lord owned as instruments in his hand\r\nto do this great work.\"[4] By the \"poor dispirited people\" the Baptists\r\nwere almost certainly meant.[5] By their assistance he seems to have\r\nbeen cured. So also was Hannah Crump of Warwick, who had been afflicted\r\nby witchcraft and put in a London hospital. Through prayer and fasting\r\nshe was entirely recovered.\r\n\r\nMary Hall had been taken to Doctor Woodhouse of Berkhampstead, \"a man\r\nfamous for curing bewitched persons.\" Woodhouse's name comes up now and\r\nagain in the records of his time. He was in fact a very typical specimen\r\nof the witch doctor. When Mary Hall's case had been submitted to him he\r\nhad cut off the ends of her nails and \"with somewhat he added\" hung them\r\nin the chimney over night before making a diagnosis.[6] He professed to\r\nfind stolen goods as well and fell foul of the courts in one instance,\r\nprobably because the woman who consulted him could not pay the shilling\r\nfee.[7] He was arraigned and spent a term in prison. No doubt many of\r\nthe witch physicians knew the inside of prisons and had returned\r\nafterwards to successful practice. Redman, \"whom some say is a\r\nConjurer, others say, He is an honest and able phisitian,\" had been in\r\nprison, but nevertheless he had afterwards \"abundance of Practice\" and\r\nwas much talked about \"in remote parts,\" all this in spite of the fact\r\nthat he was \"unlearned in the languages.\"[8]\r\n\r\nUsually, of course, the witch doctor was a poor woman who was very happy\r\nto get a penny fee now and then, but who ran a greater risk of the\r\ngallows than her male competitors. Her reputation, which brought her a\r\nlittle money from the sick and from those who had lost valuables, made\r\nher at the same time a successful beggar. Those whom she importuned were\r\nafraid to refuse her. But she was in constant peril. If she resented ill\r\ntreatment, if she gave in ill wishes as much as she took, she was sure\r\nto hear from it before a stern justice of the peace. It can hardly be\r\ndoubted that a large proportion, after the Restoration as in every other\r\nperiod, of those finally hanged for witchcraft, had in fact made claims\r\nto skill in magic arts. Without question some of them had even traded on\r\nthe fear they inspired. Not a few of the wretched creatures fetched to\r\nYork castle to be tried were \"inchanters.\"\r\n\r\nVery often, indeed, a woman who was nothing more than a midwife, with\r\nsome little knowledge of medicine perhaps, would easily be classed by\r\nthe public among the regular witch doctors and so come to have a bad\r\nname. Whether she lived up to her name or not--and the temptation to do\r\nso would be great--she would from that time be subject to suspicion, and\r\nmight at length become a prey to the justice of the peace. Mrs. Pepper\r\nwas no more than a midwife who made also certain simple medical\r\nexaminations, but when one of her patients was \"strangely handled\" she\r\nwas taken to court.[9] Margaret Stothard was probably, so far as we can\r\npiece together her story, a woman who had been successful in calming\r\nfretful children and had so gained for herself a reputation as a witch.\r\nDoubtless she had acquired in time a few of the charmer's tricks that\r\nenhanced her reputation and increased her practice. This was all very\r\nwell until one of her patients happened to die. Then she was carried to\r\nNewcastle and would probably have suffered death, had it not been for a\r\nwise judge.[10]\r\n\r\nThese are typical cases. The would-be healer of the sick ran a risk, and\r\nit was not always alone from failure to cure. If a witch doctor found\r\nhimself unable to bring relief to a patient, it was easy to suggest that\r\nsome other witch doctor--and such were usually women--was bewitching the\r\npatient. There are many instances, and they are not confined to the\r\nparticular period with which we are dealing, in which one \"good witch\"\r\nstarted the run on the other's reputation. Even the regular physician\r\nmay sometimes have yielded to the temptation to crush competition.\r\n\r\nOf course, when all the cases are considered, only a very small part of\r\nthe \"good witches\" ever fell into the clutches of the law. The law\r\nprescribed very definite penalties for their operations, but in most\r\ninstances no action was taken until after a long accumulation of\r\n\"suspicious circumstances,\" and, even if action was taken, the chances,\r\nas we have seen, were by this time distinctly in favor of the accused.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say, by any means, that the judges and juries of England\r\nhad come over to the side of the witch. The period with which we are\r\ndealing was marked by a variety of decision which betrays the perplexity\r\nof judges and juries. It is true, indeed, that out of from eighty to one\r\nhundred cases where accusations are on record less than twenty witches\r\nwere hanged. This does not mean that six times out of every seven the\r\ncourts were ruling against the fact of witchcraft. In the case of the\r\nsix released there was no very large body of evidence against them to be\r\nconsidered, or perhaps no strong popular current to be stemmed. In\r\ngeneral, it may be said that the courts were still backing up the law of\r\nJames I.\r\n\r\nTo show this, it is only necessary to run over some of the leading\r\ntrials of the period. We shall briefly take up four trials conducted\r\nrespectively by Justice Archer, Chief Baron Hale, Justice Rainsford, and\r\nJustice Raymond.\r\n\r\nJulian Cox, who was but one of the \"pestilent brood\" of witches ferreted\r\nout in Somerset by the aggressive justice, Robert Hunt, was tried in\r\n1663 at Taunton before Justice Archer.[11] The charges against her\r\nindeed excited such interest all over England, and elicited, upon the\r\npart of disbelievers, so much derision, that it will be worth our while\r\nto go over the principal points of evidence. The chief witness against\r\nher was a huntsman who told a strange tale. He had started a hare and\r\nchased it behind a bush. But when he came to the bush he had found\r\nJulian Cox there, stooped over and quite out of breath. Another witness\r\nhad a strange story to tell about her. She had invited him to come up on\r\nher porch and take a pipe of tobacco with her. While he was with her,\r\nsmoking, he saw a toad between his legs. On going home he had taken out\r\na pipe and smoked again and had again seen what looked to be the same\r\ntoad between his legs. \"He took the Toad out to kill it, and to his\r\nthinking cut it in several pieces, but returning to his Pipe the Toad\r\nstill appeared.... At length the Toad cryed, and vanish'd.\" A third\r\nwitness had seen the accused fly in at her window \"in her full\r\nproportion.\" This tissue of evidence was perhaps the absurdest ever used\r\nagainst even a witch, but the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. It is\r\nnot unpleasant to know that Justice Archer met with a good deal of\r\ncriticism for his part in the affair.\r\n\r\nIn the following year occurred the trials at Bury St. Edmunds, which\r\nderive their interest and importance largely from the position of the\r\npresiding judge, Sir Matthew Hale, who was at this time chief baron of\r\nthe exchequer, and was later to be chief justice of the king's bench. He\r\nwas allowed, according to the admission of one none too friendly to him,\r\n\"on all hands to be the most profound lawyer of his time.\"[12] Hale had\r\nbeen a Puritan from his youth, though not of the rigid or theologically\r\nminded sort. In the Civil Wars and the events that followed he had\r\nremained non-partisan. He accepted office from Cromwell, though without\r\ndoubt mildly sympathizing with the king. One of those who had assisted\r\nin recalling Charles II, he rose shortly to be chief baron of the\r\nexchequer. Famous for his careful and reasoned interpretation of law, he\r\nwas to leave behind him a high reputation for his justice and for the\r\nexceptional precision of his judgments. It is not too much to say that\r\nhe was one of the greatest legal figures of his century and that his\r\ndecisions served in no small degree to fix the law.\r\n\r\nWe should like to know how far he had been brought into contact with the\r\nsubject of witchcraft, but we can do no more than guess. His early\r\ncareer had been moulded in no small degree by Selden, who, as has been\r\nnoted in an earlier chapter, believed in the punishment of those who\r\nclaimed to be witches. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the\r\nPuritans with whom he had been thrown were all of them ready to quote\r\nScripture against the minions of Satan. We know that he had read some of\r\nthe works of Henry More,[13] and, whether or not familiar with his\r\nchapters on witchcraft, would have deduced from that writer's general\r\nphilosophy of spirits the particular application.\r\n\r\nThe trial concerned two women of Lowestoft, Amy Duny and Rose Cullender.\r\nThe first had been reputed a witch and a \"person of very evil\r\nbehaviour.\" She was in all probability related to some of those women\r\nwho had suffered at the hands of Hopkins, and to that connection owed\r\nher ill name. Some six or seven years before the date of the trial she\r\nhad got herself into trouble while taking care of the child of a\r\ntradesman in Lowestoft. It would seem that, contrary to the orders of\r\nthe mother, she had suckled the child. The child had that same night\r\nbeen attacked by fits, and a witch doctor of Yarmouth, who was\r\nconsulted, had prescribed for it. The reader will note that this\r\n\"suspicious circumstance\" happened seven years earlier, and a large part\r\nof the evidence presented in court concerned what had occurred from five\r\nto seven years before.\r\n\r\nWe can not go into the details of a trial which abounded in curious bits\r\nof evidence. The main plot indeed was an old one. The accused woman,\r\nafter she had been discharged from employment and reproved, had been\r\nheard to mutter threats, close upon which the children of those she\r\ncursed, who were now the witnesses against her, had fallen ill. Two of\r\nthe children had suffered severely and were still afflicted. They had\r\nthrown up pins and even a two-penny nail. The nail, which was duly\r\noffered as an exhibit in court, had been brought to one of the children\r\nby a bee and had been forced into the child's mouth, upon which she\r\nexpelled it. This narrative was on a level with the other, that flies\r\nbrought crooked pins to the child. Both flies and bee, it will be\r\nunderstood, were the witches in other form. A similar sort of evidence\r\nwas that a toad, which had been found as the result of the witch\r\ndoctor's directions, had been thrown into the fire, upon which a sharp\r\ncrackling noise ensued. When this incident was testified to in the court\r\nthe judge interrupted to ask if after the explosion the substance of the\r\ntoad was not to be seen in the fire. He was answered in the negative. On\r\nthe next day Amy Duny was found to have her face and body all scorched.\r\nShe said to the witness that \"she might thank her for it.\" There can be\r\nno doubt in the world that this testimony of the coincident burning of\r\nthe woman and the toad was regarded as damning proof, nor is there any\r\nreason to believe that the court deemed it necessary to go behind the\r\nmere say-so of a single witness for the fact. Along with this sort of\r\nunsubstantial testimony there was presented a monotonous mass of\r\nspectral evidence. Apparitions of the witches were the constant\r\noccasions for the paroxysms of the children. In another connection it\r\nwill be observed that this form of proof was becoming increasingly\r\ncommon in the last part of the seventeenth century. It can hardly be\r\ndoubted that in one way or another the use of such evidence at Bury\r\ninfluenced other trials and more particularly the Salem cases in the New\r\nWorld, where great importance was attached to evidence of this sort.\r\n\r\nThe usual nauseating evidence as to the Devil's marks was introduced by\r\nthe testimony of the mother of one of the children bewitched. She had\r\nbeen, a month before, a member of a jury of matrons appointed by a\r\njustice of the peace to examine the body of the accused. Most damning\r\nproof against the woman had been found. It is very hard for us to\r\nunderstand why Hale allowed to testify, as one of the jury of examining\r\nmatrons, a woman who was at the same time mother of one of the bewitched\r\nchildren upon whom the prosecution largely depended.\r\n\r\nSo far the case for the prosecution had been very strong, but it was in\r\nthe final experiments in court, which were expected to clinch the\r\nevidence, that a very serious mishap occurred. A bewitched child, eleven\r\nyears old, had been fetched into court. With eyes closed and head\r\nreclining upon the bar she had remained quiet until one of the accused\r\nwas brought up, when she at once became frantic in her effort to scratch\r\nher. This was tried again and again and in every instance produced the\r\nsame result. The performance must have had telling effect. But there\r\nhappened to be present at the trial three Serjeants of the law. One of\r\nthem, Serjeant John Kelyng, a few years later to become chief justice of\r\nthe king's bench, was \"much dissatisfied.\" He urged the point that the\r\nmere fact that the children were bewitched did not establish their claim\r\nto designate the authors of their misfortune. There were others present\r\nwho agreed with Kelyng in suspecting the actions of the girl on the\r\nstand. Baron Hale was induced, at length, to appoint a committee of\r\nseveral gentlemen, including Serjeant Kelyng, to make trial of the girl\r\nwith her eyes covered. An outside party was brought up to her and\r\ntouched her hand. The girl was expecting that Amy Duny would be brought\r\nup and flew into the usual paroxysms. This was what the committee had\r\nexpected, and they declared their belief that the whole transaction was\r\na mere imposture. One would have supposed that every one else must come\r\nto the same conclusion, but Mr. Pacy, the girl's father, offered an\r\nexplanation of her mistake that seems to have found favor. The maid, he\r\nsaid, \"might be deceived by a suspicion that the Witch touched her when\r\nshe did not.\" One would suppose that this subtle suggestion would have\r\nbroken the spell, and that Mr. Pacy would have been laughed out of\r\ncourt. Alas for the rarity of humor in seventeenth-century court rooms!\r\nNot only was the explanation received seriously, but it was, says the\r\ncourt reporter, afterwards found to be true.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time expert opinion had been called in. It is hard to say\r\nwhether Dr. Browne had been requisitioned for the case or merely\r\nhappened to be present. At all events, he was called upon to render his\r\nopinion as a medical man. The name of Thomas Browne is one eminent in\r\nEnglish literature and not unknown in the annals of English medicine and\r\nscience. More than twenty years earlier he had expressed faith in the\r\nreality of witchcraft.[14] In his _Commonplace Book_, a series of\r\njottings made throughout his life, he reiterated his belief, but uttered\r\na doubt as to the connection between possession and witchcraft.[15]\r\n\r\nWe should be glad to know at what time Browne wrote this deliverance;\r\nfor, when called upon at Bury, he made no application of his principles\r\nof caution. He gave it as his opinion that the bewitchment of the two\r\ngirls was genuine. The vomiting of needles and nails reminded him very\r\nmuch of a recent case in Denmark. For the moment the physician spoke,\r\nwhen he said that \"these swounding Fits were Natural.\" But it was the\r\nstudent of seventeenth-century theology who went on: they were\r\n\"heightened to a great excess by the subtilty of the Devil, co-operating\r\nwith the Malice of these which we term Witches, at whose Instance he\r\ndoth these Villanies.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt Browne's words confirmed the sentiment of the court room and\r\nstrengthened the case of the prosecution. But it will not be overlooked\r\nby the careful reader that he did not by any means commit himself as to\r\nthe guilt of the parties at the bar.\r\n\r\nWhen the judge found that the prisoners had \"nothing material\" to say\r\nfor themselves he addressed the jury. Perhaps because he was not\r\naltogether clear in his own mind about the merits of the case, he\r\nrefused to sum up the evidence. It is impossible for us to understand\r\nwhy he did not carry further the tests which had convinced Kelyng of the\r\nfraud, or why he did not ask questions which would have uncovered the\r\nweakness of the testimony. One cannot but suspect that North's criticism\r\nof him, that he had a \"leaning towards the Popular\" and that he had\r\ngained such \"transcendent\" authority as not easily to bear\r\ncontradiction,[16] was altogether accurate. At all events he passed over\r\nthe evidence and went on to declare that there were two problems before\r\nthe jury: (1) were these children bewitched, (2) were the prisoners at\r\nthe bar guilty of it? As to the existence of witches, he never doubted\r\nit. The Scriptures affirmed it, and all nations provided laws against\r\nsuch persons.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday Baron Hale composed a meditation upon the\r\nsubject. Unfortunately it was simply a dissertation on Scripture texts\r\nand touched upon the law at no point.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious enough to the most casual student that Sir Matthew Hale\r\nhad a chance to anticipate the work of Chief Justice Holt and missed it.\r\nIn the nineties of the seventeenth century, as we shall see, there was a\r\nman in the chief justiceship who dared to nullify the law of James I. It\r\nis not too much to say that Matthew Hale by a different charge to the\r\njury could as easily have made the current of judicial decisions run in\r\nfavor of accused witches all over England. His weight was thrown in the\r\nother direction, and the witch-triers for a half-century to come invoked\r\nthe name of Hale.[17]\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting though hardly trustworthy story told by Speaker\r\nOnslow[18]--writing a century later--that Hale \"was afterwards much\r\naltered in his notions as to this matter, and had great concern upon him\r\nfor what had befallen these persons.\" This seems the more doubtful\r\nbecause there is not a shred of proof that Hale's decisions occasioned a\r\nword of criticism among his contemporaries.[19] So great, indeed, was\r\nthe spell of his name that not even a man like John Webster dared to\r\ncomment upon his decision. Not indeed until nearly the middle of the\r\neighteenth century does anyone seem to have felt that the decision\r\ncalled for apology.\r\n\r\nThe third noteworthy ruling in this period anent the crime of witchcraft\r\nwas made a few years later in Wiltshire by Justice Rainsford. The story,\r\nas he himself told it to a colleague, was this: \"A Witch was brought to\r\nSalisbury and tried before him. Sir James Long came to his Chamber, and\r\nmade a heavy Complaint of this Witch, and said that if she escaped, his\r\nEstate would not be worth any Thing; for all the People would go away.\r\nIt happen'd that the Witch was acquitted, and the Knight continued\r\nextremely concern'd; therefore the Judge, to save the poor Gentleman's\r\nEstate, order'd the Woman to be kept in Gaol, and that the Town should\r\nallow her 2s. 6d. per Week; for which he was very thankful. The very\r\nnext Assizes, he came to the Judge to desire his lordship would let her\r\ncome back to the Town. And why? They could keep her for 1s. 6d. there;\r\nand, in the Gaol, she cost them a shilling more.\"[20] Another case\r\nbefore Justice Rainsford showed him less lenient. By a mere chance we\r\nhave a letter, written at the time by one of the justices of the peace\r\nin Malmesbury, which sheds no little light on this affair and on the\r\nlegal status of witchcraft at that time.[21] A certain Ann Tilling had\r\nbeen taken into custody on the complaint of Mrs. Webb of Malmesbury. The\r\nlatter's son had swooning fits in which he accused Ann of bewitching\r\nhim. Ann Tilling made voluble confession, implicating Elizabeth Peacock\r\nand Judith Witchell, who had, she declared, inveigled her into the\r\npractice of their evil arts. Other witches were named, and in a short\r\ntime twelve women and two men were under accusation. But the alderman\r\nof Malmesbury, who was the chief magistrate of that town, deemed it wise\r\nbefore going further to call in four of the justices of the peace in\r\nthat subdivision of the county. Three of these justices of the peace\r\ncame and listened to the confessions, and were about to make out a\r\nmittimus for sending eleven of the accused to Salisbury, when the fourth\r\njustice arrived, the man who has given us the story. He was, according\r\nto his own account, not \"very credulous in matters of Witchcraft,\" and\r\nhe made a speech to the other justices. \"Gentlemen, what is done at this\r\nplace, a Borough remote from the centre of this large County, and almost\r\nforty miles from Salisbury, will be expended [_sic_] both by the\r\nReverend Judges, the learned Counsayle there ..., and the Gentry of the\r\nbody of the County, so that if anything be done here rashly, it will be\r\nseverely censured.\" He went on to urge the danger that the boy whose\r\nfits were the cause of so much excitement might be an impostor, and that\r\nAnn Tilling, who had freely confessed, might be in confederacy with the\r\nparents. The skeptical justice, who in spite of his boasted incredulity\r\nwas a believer in the reality of witchcraft, was successful with his\r\ncolleagues. All the accused were dismissed save Tilling, Peacock, and\r\nWitchell. They were sent to Salisbury and tried before Sir Richard\r\nRainsford. Elizabeth Peacock, who had been tried on similar charges\r\nbefore, was dismissed. The other two were sentenced to be hanged.[22]\r\n\r\nTen years later came a fourth remarkable ruling against witchcraft, this\r\ntime by Justice Raymond at Exeter. During the intervening years there\r\nhad been cases a-plenty in England and a few hangings, but none that had\r\nattracted comment. It was not until the summer of 1682, when three\r\nDevonshire women were arraigned, tried, and sent to the gallows by\r\nJustice Raymond,[23] that the public again realized that witchcraft was\r\nstill upheld by the courts.\r\n\r\nThe trials in themselves had no very striking features. At least two of\r\nthe three women had been beggars; the other, who had been the first\r\naccused and who had in all probability involved her two companions, had\r\non two different occasions before been arraigned but let off. The\r\nevidence submitted against them consisted of the usual sworn statements\r\nmade by neighbors to the justice of the peace, as well as of hardly\r\ncoherent confessions by the accused. The repetition of the Lord's Prayer\r\nwas gone through with and the results of examinations by a female jury\r\nwere detailed _ad nauseam_. The poor creatures on trial were remarkably\r\nstupid, even for beings of their grade. Their several confessions\r\ntallied with one another in hardly a single point.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Raymond and Sir Francis North were the judges present at the\r\nExeter assizes. Happily the latter has left his impressions of this\r\ntrial.[24] He admits that witch trials worried him because the evidence\r\nwas usually slight, but the people very intent upon a verdict of guilty.\r\nHe was very glad that at Exeter his colleague who sat upon the \"crown\r\nside\" had to bear the responsibilities.[25] The two women (he seems to\r\nhave known of no more) were scarce alive as to sense and understanding,\r\nbut were \"overwhelm'd with melancholy and waking Dreams.\" Barring\r\nconfessions, the other evidence he considered trifling, and he cites the\r\ntestimony of a witness that \"he saw a cat leap in at her (the old\r\nwoman's) window, when it was twilight; and this Informant farther saith\r\nthat he verily believeth the said Cat to be the Devil, and more saith\r\nnot.\" Raymond, declares his colleague, made no nice distinctions as to\r\nthe possibility of melancholy women contracting an opinion of themselves\r\nthat was false, but left the matter to the jury.[26]\r\n\r\nWe have already intimated that the rulings of the courts were by no\r\nmeans all of them adverse to the witches. Almost contemporaneous with\r\nthe far-reaching sentence of Sir Matthew Hale at Bury were the trials in\r\nSomerset, where flies and nails and needles played a similar part, but\r\nwhere the outcome was very different. A zealous justice of the peace,\r\nRobert Hunt, had for the last eight years been on the lookout for\r\nwitches. In 1663 he had turned Julian Cox over to the tender mercies of\r\nJustice Archer. By 1664 he had uncovered a \"hellish knot\" of the wicked\r\nwomen and was taking depositions against them, wringing confessions from\r\nthem and sending them to gaol with all possible speed.[27] The women\r\nwere of the usual class, a herd of poor quarrelsome, bickering females\r\nwho went from house to house seeking alms. In the numbers of the accused\r\nthe discovery resembled that at Lancaster in 1633-1634, as indeed it did\r\nin other ways. A witch meeting or conventicle was confessed to. The\r\ncounty was being terrified and entertained by the most horrible tales,\r\nwhen suddenly a quietus was put upon the affair \"by some of them in\r\nauthority.\" A witch chase, which during the Civil Wars would have led to\r\na tragedy, was cut short, probably through the agency of a privy council\r\nless fearful of popular sentiment than the assize judges.\r\n\r\nThe Mompesson case[28] was of no less importance in its time, although\r\nit belongs rather in the annals of trickery than in those of\r\nwitchcraft. But the sensation which it caused in England and the\r\ncontroversy waged over it between the upholders of witchcraft and the\r\n\"Sadducees,\" give the story a considerable interest and render the\r\noutcome of the trial significant. The only case of its sort in its time,\r\nit was nevertheless most typical of the superstition of the time. A\r\nlittle town in Wiltshire had been disturbed by a stray drummer. The\r\nself-constituted noise-maker was called to account by a stranger in the\r\nvillage, a Mr. Mompesson of Tedworth, who on examining the man's license\r\nsaw that it had been forged and took it away from him. This, at any\r\nrate, was Mr. Mompesson's story as to how he had incurred the ill will\r\nof the man. The drummer took his revenge in a singular way. Within a few\r\ndays the Mompesson family at Tedworth began to be annoyed at night by\r\nstrange noises or drummings on the roofs. All the phenomena and\r\nmanifestations which we associate with a modern haunted-house story were\r\nobserved by this alarmed family of the seventeenth century. The little\r\ngirls were knocked about in their beds at night, a stout servant was\r\nforcibly held hand and foot, the children's shoes were thrown about, the\r\nchairs glided about the room. It would seem that all this bold\r\nhorse-play must soon have been exposed, but it went on merrily. Whenever\r\nany tune was called for, it was given on the drum. The family Bible was\r\nthrown upside down into the ashes. For three weeks, however, the spirits\r\nceased operations during the lying-in of Mrs. Mompesson. But they\r\nsedulously avoided the family servants, especially when those retainers\r\nhappened to be armed with swords. Well they might, for we are told that\r\non one occasion, after a pistol shot had been fired at the place where\r\nthey were heard, blood was found on the spot. In another instance,\r\naccording to Mr. Mompesson's own account, there were seen figures, \"in\r\nthe shape of Men, who, as soon as a Gun was discharg'd, would shuffle\r\naway together into an Arbour.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear enough that a somewhat clumsy fraud was being imposed upon\r\nMr. Mompesson. A contemporary writer tells us he was told that it was\r\ndone by \"two Young Women in the House with a design to scare thence Mr.\r\nMompesson's Mother.\"[29] From other sources it is quite certain that the\r\ninjured drummer had a hand in the affair. A very similar game had been\r\nplayed at Woodstock in 1649, and formed a comedy situation of which\r\nScott makes brilliant use in his novel of that name. Indeed, it is quite\r\npossible that the drummer, who had been a soldier of Cromwell's, was\r\ninspired by a memory of that affair.\r\n\r\nBut there was no one to detect the fraud, as at Woodstock. Tedworth\r\nbecame a Mecca for those interested in the supernatural. One of the\r\nvisitors was Joseph Glanvill, at this time a young man of twenty-seven,\r\nlater to become a member of the Royal Society and chaplain in ordinary\r\nto the king. The spirits were less noisy; they were always somewhat\r\nrestrained before visitors, but scratched on bed sheets and panted in\r\ndog fashion, till Glanvill was thoroughly taken in. For the rest of his\r\nlife this psychic experimenter fought a literary war over this case with\r\nthose who made fun of it. While we cannot prove it, we may guess with\r\nsome confidence that this episode was the beginning of the special\r\ninterest in the supernatural upon Glanvill's part which was later to\r\nmake him the arch-defender of the witchcraft superstition in his\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nHow wide an interest the matter evoked may be judged from the warm\r\ndiscussions upon it at Cambridge, and from the royal interest in it\r\nwhich induced Charles to send down a committee of investigation.\r\nCuriously enough, the spirits were singularly and most extraordinarily\r\nquiet when the royal investigators were at work, a fact to which\r\ndelighted skeptics pointed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOne wonders that the drummer, who must have known that his name would be\r\nconnected with the affair, failed to realize the risk he was running\r\nfrom the witch hunters. He was indicted on minor felonies of another\r\nsort, but the charges which Mompesson brought against him seem to have\r\nbeen passed over. The man was condemned for stealing and was\r\ntransported. With his departure the troubles at Tedworth ceased. But the\r\ndrummer, in some way, escaped and returned to England. The angry\r\nMompesson now brought him to the assizes as a felon on the strength of\r\nthe statute of James I. Unhappily we have no details of this trial, nor\r\ndo we know even the name of the judge; but we do know that the jury gave\r\na verdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\nIn 1671 Cornwall was stirred up over a witch whose crimes were said to\r\nbe directed against the state. She had hindered the English fleet in\r\ntheir war against the Dutch, she had caused a bull to kill one of the\r\nenemies in Parliament of the Non-Conformists, she had been responsible\r\nfor the barrenness of the queen. And for all these political crimes the\r\nchief evidence was that some cats had been seen playing (\"dancing\") near\r\nher house. She was committed, along with several other women who were\r\naccused. Although at the assizes they were all proved to have had cats\r\nand rats about them, they went free.[30]\r\n\r\nIn 1682, the same year in which the three women of Devonshire had been\r\ncondemned, there was a trial at Southwark, just outside of London, which\r\nresulted in a verdict of acquittal. The case had many of the usual\r\nfeatures, but in two points was unique. Joan Butts was accused of having\r\nbewitched a child that had been taken with fits.[31] Nineteen or twenty\r\nwitnesses testified against the witch. One of the witnesses heard her\r\nsay that, if she had not bewitched the child, if all the devils in hell\r\ncould help her, she would bewitch it. Joan admitted the words, but said\r\nthat she had spoken them in passion. She then turned on one of the\r\nwitnesses and declared that he had given himself to the Devil, body and\r\nsoul. Chief Justice Pemberton was presiding, and he called her to order\r\nfor this attack on a witness, and then catechized her as to her means of\r\nknowing the fact. The woman had thoughtlessly laid herself open by her\r\nown words to the most serious suspicion. In spite of this, however, the\r\njury brought her in not guilty, \"to the great amazement of some, ... yet\r\nothers who consider the great difficulty in proving a Witch, thought the\r\njury could do no less than acquit her.\"\r\n\r\nThis was, during the period, the one trial in or near London of which we\r\nhave details. There can be no doubt that the courts in London and the\r\nvicinity were beginning to ignore cases of witchcraft. After 1670 there\r\nwere no more trials of the sort in Middlesex.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that Justice North had questioned the equity of\r\nJustice Raymond's decision at Exeter. He has told us the story of a\r\ntrial at Taunton-Dean, where he himself had to try a witch.[32] A\r\nten-year-old girl, who was taking strange fits and spitting out pins,\r\nwas the witness against an old man whom she accused of bewitching her.\r\nThe defendant made \"a Defence as orderly and well expressed as I ever\r\nheard spoke.\" The judge then asked the justice of the peace who had\r\ncommitted the man his opinion. He said that he believed the girl,\r\n\"doubling herself in her Fit, as being convulsed, bent her Head down\r\nclose to her Stomacher, and with her Mouth, took Pins out of the Edge of\r\nthat, and then, righting herself a little, spit them into some\r\nBy-stander's Hands.\" \"The Sum of it was Malice, Threatening, and\r\nCircumstances of Imposture in the Girl.\" As the judge went downstairs\r\nafter the man had been acquitted, \"an hideous old woman\" cried to him,\r\n\"My Lord, Forty Years ago they would have hang'd me for a Witch, and\r\nthey could not; and now they would have hang'd my poor Son.\"\r\n\r\nThe five cases we have cited, while not so celebrated as those on the\r\nother side, were quite as representative of what was going on in\r\nEngland. It is to be regretted that we have not the records by which to\r\ncompute the acquittals of this period. In a large number of cases where\r\nwe have depositions we have no statement of the outcome. This is\r\nparticularly true of Yorkshire. As has been pointed out in the earlier\r\npart of the chapter, we can be sure that most of these cases were\r\ndismissed or were never brought to trial.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the question of the forms of evidence presented during\r\nthis period, we have a story that has been told before. Female juries,\r\nconvulsive children or child pretenders, we have met them all before.\r\nTwo or three differences may nevertheless be noted. The use of spectral\r\nevidence was becoming increasingly common. The spectres, as always,\r\nassumed weird forms. Nicholas Rames's wife (at Longwitton, in the north)\r\nsaw Elizabeth Fenwick and the Devil dancing together.[33] A sick boy in\r\nCornwall saw a \"Woman in a blue Jerkin and Red Petticoat with Yellow and\r\nGreen patches,\" who was quickly identified and put in hold.[34]\r\nSometimes the spectres were more material. Jane Milburne of Newcastle\r\ntestified that Dorothy Stranger, in the form of a cat, had leaped upon\r\nher and held her to the ground for a quarter of an hour.[35] A \"Barber's\r\nboy\" in Cambridge had escaped from a spectral woman in the isle of Ely,\r\nbut she followed him to Cambridge and killed him with a blow. \"He had\r\nthe exact mark in his forehead, being dead, where the Spiritual Woman\r\ndid hit him alive.\"[36] It is unnecessary to multiply cases. The\r\n_Collection of Modern Relations_ is full of the same sort of evidence.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that in nearly every epoch of witch history the\r\nvoluntary and involuntary confessions of the accused had greatly\r\nsimplified the difficulties of prosecution. The witches whom Matthew\r\nHopkins discovered were too ready to confess to enormous and unnatural\r\ncrimes. In this respect there is a marked change in the period of the\r\nlater Stuarts. Elizabeth Style of Somerset in 1663 and the three\r\nDevonshire witches of 1682 were the only ones who made confessions.\r\nElizabeth Style[37] had probably been \"watched,\" in spite of Glanvill's\r\nstatement to the contrary, perhaps somewhat in the same torturing way as\r\nthe Suffolk witches whom Hopkins \"discovered,\" and her wild confession\r\nshowed the effect. The Devonshire women were half-witted creatures, of\r\nthe type that had always been most voluble in confession; but such were\r\nnow exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis means one of two things. Either the witches of the Restoration were\r\nby some chance a more intelligent set, or they were showing more spirit\r\nthan ever before because they had more supporters and fairer treatment\r\nin court. It is quite possible that both suppositions have in them some\r\nelements of truth. As the belief in the powers of witches developed in\r\nform and theory, it came to draw within its radius more groups of\r\npeople. In its earlier stages the attack upon the witch had been in part\r\nthe community's way of ridding itself of a disreputable member. By the\r\ntime that the process of attack had been developed for a century, it had\r\nbecome less impersonal. Personal hatreds were now more often the\r\noccasion of accusation. Individual malice was playing a larger rôle. In\r\nconsequence those who were accused were more often those who were\r\ncapable of fighting for themselves or who had friends to back them. And\r\nthose friends were more numerous and zealous because the attitude of the\r\npublic and of the courts was more friendly to the accused witch. This\r\nexplanation is at best, however, nothing more than a suggestion. We have\r\nnot the material for confident generalization.\r\n\r\nOne other form of evidence must be mentioned. The town of Newcastle,\r\nwhich in 1649 had sent to Scotland for a witchfinder, was able in 1673\r\nto make use of home-grown talent. In this instance it was a woman, Ann\r\nArmstrong, who implicated a score of her neighbors and at length went\r\naround pointing out witches. She was a smooth-witted woman who was\r\nprobably taking a shrewd method of turning off charges against herself.\r\nHer testimony dealt with witch gatherings or conventicles held at\r\nvarious times and places. She told whom she had seen there and what they\r\nhad said about their crimes. She told of their feasts and of their\r\ndances. Poor woman, she had herself been compelled to sing for them\r\nwhile they danced. Nor was this the worst. She had been terribly\r\nmisused. She had been often turned into a horse, then bridled and\r\nridden.[38]\r\n\r\nIt would not be worth while to go further into Ann Armstrong's stories.\r\nIt is enough to remark that she offered details, as to harm done to\r\ncertain individuals in certain ways, which tallied closely with the\r\nsworn statements of those individuals as to what had happened to them at\r\nthe times specified. The conclusion cannot be avoided that the female\r\nwitchfinder had been at no small pains to get even such minute details\r\nin exact form. She had gathered together all the witch stories of that\r\npart of Northumberland and had embodied them in her account of the\r\nconfessions made at the \"conventicles.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the ruling of the court on all this evidence we do not know. We\r\nhave only one instance in which any evidence was ruled out. That was at\r\nthe trial of Julian Cox in 1663. Justice Archer tried an experiment in\r\nthat trial, but before doing so he explained to the court that no\r\naccount was to be taken of the result in making up their verdict. He had\r\nheard that a witch could not repeat the petition in the Lord's Prayer,\r\n\"Lead us not into temptation.\" The witch indeed failed to meet the\r\ntest.[39]\r\n\r\nIn the course of this period we have two trials that reveal a connection\r\nbetween witchcraft and other crimes. Perhaps it would be fairer to say\r\nthat the charge of witchcraft was sometimes made when other crimes were\r\nsuspected, but could not be proved. The first case concerned a rich\r\nfarmer in Northamptonshire who had gained the ill will of a woman named\r\nAnn Foster. Thirty of his sheep were found dead with their \"Leggs broke\r\nin pieces, and their Bones all shattered in their Skins.\" A little later\r\nhis house and barns were set on fire. Ann Foster was brought to trial\r\nfor using witchcraft against him, confessed to it, and was hanged.[40]\r\n\r\nThe other case was at Brightling in Sussex, not far from London. There a\r\nwoman who was suspected as the one who had told a servant that Joseph\r\nCruther's house would be burned--a prophecy which came true very\r\nshortly--was accused as a witch. She had been accused years before at\r\nthe Maidstone assizes, but had gone free. This time she was \"watched\"\r\nfor twenty-four hours and four ministers kept a fast over the\r\naffair.[41]\r\n\r\nThese cases are worth something as an indication that the charge of\r\nwitchcraft was still a method of getting rid of people whom the\r\ncommunity feared.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this chapter the years 1660 to 1688 were marked off\r\nas constituting a single epoch in the history of the superstition. Yet\r\nthose years were by no means characterized by the same sort of court\r\nverdicts. The sixties saw a decided increase over the years of the\r\nCommonwealth in the number of trials and in the number of executions.\r\nThe seventies witnessed a rapid dropping off in both figures. Even more\r\nso the eighties. By the close of the eighties the accounts of witchcraft\r\nwere exceedingly rare. The decisions of the courts in the matter were in\r\na state of fluctuation. Two things were happening. The justices of the\r\npeace were growing much more reluctant to send accused witches to the\r\nassize courts; and the itinerant judges as a body were, in spite of the\r\ndecisions of Hale and Raymond, more careful in witch trials than ever\r\nbefore, and more likely to withstand public sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe changes of opinion, as reflected in the literature of the time,\r\nespecially in the literature of the subject, will show the same\r\ntendencies. We shall take them up in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Raine, ed., _York Depositions_ (Surtees Soc.), preface, xxx.\r\n\r\n[2] Joseph Hunter, _Life of Heywood_ (London, 1842), 167, and Heywood's\r\n_Diaries_, ed.

MSS. Comm.

See also Lord Campbell, _Lives of the Chief Justices_ (London,\r\n1849), I, 563-567.\r\n\r\n[20] Roger North, _op. cit._, 130, 131. The story, as here told,\r\nascribes the event to the year preceding Lord Guilford's first western\r\ncircuit--_i. e._, to 1674. But this perhaps need not be taken too\r\nexactly, and the witch was probably that Elizabeth Peacock who was\r\nacquitted in 1670 and again in the case of 1672 described above. At\r\nleast the list of \"Indictments for witchcraft on the Western Circuit\r\nfrom 1670 to 1712,\" published by Inderwick in his _Sidelights on the\r\nStuarts_ (London, 1888), shows no other acquittal in Wiltshire during\r\nthis decade.\r\n\r\n[21] For this letter see the _Gentleman's Magazine_, 1832, pt. I,\r\n405-410, 489-402. The story is confirmed in part by Inderwick's finds in\r\nthe western Gaol Delivery records. As to the trustworthiness of this\r\nunknown justice of the peace, see above, pp. 160, 162, and notes.\r\n\r\n[22] That the judge was Sir Richard Rainsford appears from Inderwick's\r\nlist, mentioned above, note 20.\r\n\r\n[23] _A True and Impartial Relation of the Informations against ...\r\nTemperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susanna Edwards_ (London, 1682).\r\nAnd _The Tryal, Condemnation and Execution of Three Witches ..._\r\n(London, 1682). See also below, note 26, and appendix A, § 6.\r\n\r\n[24] Roger North, _op. cit._, 130.\r\n\r\n[25] At a trial at the York assizes in 1687 Sir John Reresby seems to\r\nhave played about the same part that North played at Exeter. Serjeant\r\nPowell, later to be chief justice, was presiding over the case. \"An old\r\nwoman was condemned for a witch. Those who were more credulous in points\r\nof this nature than myself, conceived the evidence to be very strong\r\nagainst her. The boy she was said to have bewitched fell down on a\r\nsudden before all the court when he saw her, and would then as suddenly\r\nreturn to himself again, and very distinctly relate the several injuries\r\nshe had done him: but in all this it was observed the boy was free from\r\nany distortion; that he did not foam at the mouth, and that his fits did\r\nnot leave him gradually, but all at once; so that, upon the whole, the\r\njudge thought it proper to reprieve her.\" _Memoirs and Travels of Sir\r\nJohn Reresby_ (London, 1813), 329.\r\n\r\n[26] There is indeed some evidence that Raymond wished not to condemn\r\nthe women, but yielded nevertheless to public opinion. In a pamphlet\r\npublished five years later it is stated that the judge \"in his charge to\r\nthe jury gave his Opinion that these three poor Women (as he supposed)\r\nwere weary of their Lives, and that he thought it proper for them to be\r\ncarryed to the Parish from whence they came, and that the Parish should\r\nbe charged with their Maintainance; for he thought their oppressing\r\nPoverty had constrained them to wish for Death.\" Unhappily the neighbors\r\nmade such an outcry that the women were found guilty and sentenced. This\r\nis from a later and somewhat untrustworthy account, but it fits in well\r\nwith what North says of the case. _The Life and Conversation of\r\nTemperance Floyd, Mary Lloyd_ [sic], _and Susanna Edwards: ..._ (London,\r\n1687).\r\n\r\n[27] The second part of Glanvill's _Sadducismus Triumphatus_ is full of\r\nthese depositions.\r\n\r\n[28] For a full account of this affair see Glanvill's _Sadducismus\r\nTriumphatus_, pt. ii, preface and Relation I. Glanvill had investigated\r\nthe matter and had diligently collected all the evidence. He was\r\nfamiliar also with what the \"deriders\" had to say, and we can discover\r\ntheir point of view from his answers.

We saw that in the course of little more than a\r\nhalf-century the centre of the controversy had been considerably\r\nshifted: we noted that there was a growing body of intelligent men who\r\ndiscredited the stories of witchcraft and were even inclined to laugh at\r\nthem. It is now our purpose to go on with the history of opinion from\r\nthe point at which we left off to the revolution of 1688. We shall\r\ndiscover that the body of literature on the subject was enormously\r\nincreased. We shall see that a larger and more representative group of\r\nmen were expressing themselves on the matter. The controversialists were\r\nno longer bushwhackers, but crafty warriors who joined battle after\r\nlooking over the field and measuring their forces. The groundworks of\r\nphilosophy were tested, the bases of religious faith examined. The days\r\nof skirmishing about the ordeal of water and the test of the Devil's\r\nmarks were gone by. The combatants were now to fight over the reality or\r\nunreality of supernatural phenomena. We shall observe that the battle\r\nwas less one-sided than ever before and that the assailants of\r\nsuperstition, who up to this time had been outnumbered, now fought on at\r\nleast even terms with their enemies. We shall see too that the\r\nnon-participants and onlookers were more ready than ever before to join\r\nthemselves to the party of attack.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was indeed a miniature war and in the main was fought very\r\nfairly. But it was natural that those who disbelieved should resort to\r\nridicule. It was a form of attack to which their opponents exposed\r\nthemselves by their faith in the utterly absurd stories of silly women.\r\nCervantes with his Don Quixote laughed chivalry out of Europe, and there\r\nwas a class in society that would willingly have laughed witchcraft out\r\nof England. Their onslaught was one most difficult to repel.\r\nNevertheless the defenders of witchcraft met the challenge squarely.\r\nWith unwearying patience and absolute confidence in their cause they\r\ncollected the testimonies for their narratives and then said to those\r\nwho laughed: Here are the facts; what are you going to do about them?\r\n\r\nThe last chapter told of the alarms in Somerset and in Wilts and showed\r\nwhat a stir they produced in England. In connection with those affairs\r\nwas mentioned the name of that brave researcher, Mr. Glanvill. The\r\nhistory of the witch literature of this period is little more than an\r\naccount of Joseph Glanvill, of his opinions, of his controversies, of\r\nhis disciples and his opponents. It is not too much to say that in\r\nGlanvill the superstition found its ablest advocate. In acuteness of\r\nlogical distinction, in the cleverness and brilliance of his\r\nintellectual sword-play, he excelled all others before and after who\r\nsought to defend the belief in witchcraft. He was a man entitled to\r\nspeak with some authority. A member of Exeter College at Oxford, he had\r\nbeen in 1664 elected a fellow of the recently founded Royal Society and\r\nwas in sympathy with its point of view. At the same time he was a\r\nphilosopher of no small influence in his generation.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual position is not difficult to determine. He was an\r\nopponent of the Oxford scholasticism and inclined towards a school of\r\nthought represented by Robert Fludd, the two Vaughans, Henry More, and\r\nVan Helmont,[1] men who had drunk deeply of the cabalistic writers,\r\ndisciples of Paracelsus and Pico della Mirandola. It would be foolhardy\r\nindeed for a layman to attempt an elucidation of the subtleties either\r\nof this philosophy or of the processes of Glanvill's philosophical\r\nreasoning. His point of view was partially unfolded in the _Scepsis\r\nScientifica_, published in 1665[2] and dedicated to the Royal Society.\r\nIn this treatise he pointed out our present ignorance of phenomena and\r\nour inability to determine their real character, owing to the\r\nsubjectivity of our perceptions of them, and insisted consequently upon\r\nthe danger of dogmatism. He himself had drawn but a cockle-shell of\r\nwater from the ocean of knowledge. His notion of spirit--if his works on\r\nwitchcraft may be trusted--seems to have been that it is a light and\r\ninvisible form of matter capable of detachment from or infusion into\r\nmore solid substances--precisely the idea of Henry More. Religiously, it\r\nwould not be far wrong to call him a reconstructionist--to use a much\r\nabused and exceedingly modern term. He did not, indeed, admit the\r\nexistence of any gap between religion and science that needed bridging\r\nover, but the trend of his teaching, though he would hardly have\r\nadmitted it, was to show that the mysteries of revealed religion belong\r\nin the field of unexplored science.[3] It was his confidence in the far\r\npossibilities opened by investigation in that field, together with the\r\ncabalistic notions he had absorbed, which rendered him so willing to\r\nbecome a student of psychical phenomena.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder, then, that he found the Mompesson and Somerset cases\r\nmaterial to his hand and that he seized upon them eagerly as irrefutable\r\nproof of demoniacal agency. His first task, indeed, was to prove the\r\nalleged facts; these once established, they could be readily fitted into\r\na comprehensive scheme of reasoning. In 1666 he issued a small volume,\r\n_Some Philosophical Considerations touching Witches and Witchcraft_.\r\nMost of the first edition was burned in the fire of London, but the book\r\nwas reprinted. Already by 1668 it had reached a fourth impression.[4] In\r\nthis edition the work took the new title _A Blow at Modern Sadducism_,\r\nand it was republished again in 1681 with further additions as\r\n_Sadducismus Triumphatus_, which might be translated \"Unbelief\r\nConquered.\"[5] The work continued to be called for faster than the\r\npublisher could supply the demand, and went through several more\r\nrevisions and reimpressions. One of the most popular books of the\r\ngeneration, it proved to be Glanvill's greatest title to contemporary\r\nfame. The success of the work was no doubt due in large measure to the\r\ncollection of witch stories; but these had been inserted by the author\r\nas the groundwork of his argument. He recognized, as no one on his side\r\nof the controversy had done before, the force of the arguments made by\r\nthe opposition. They were good points, but to them all he offered one\r\nshort answer--the evidence of proved fact.[6] That such transformations\r\nas were ascribed to the witches were ridiculous, that contracts between\r\nthe Devil and agents who were already under his control were absurd,\r\nthat the Devil would never put himself at the nod and beck of miserable\r\nwomen, and that Providence would not permit His children to be thus\r\nbuffeted by the evil one: these were the current objections;[7] and to\r\nthem all Glanvill replied that one positive fact is worth a thousand\r\nnegative arguments. Innumerable frauds had been exposed. Yes, he knew\r\nit,[8] but here were well authenticated cases that were not fraud.\r\nGlanvill put the issue squarely. His confidence in his case at once wins\r\nadmiration. He was thoroughly sincere. The fly in the ointment was of\r\ncourse that his best authenticated cases could not stand any careful\r\ncriticism. He had been furnished the narratives which he used by \"honest\r\nand honourable friends.\" Yet, if this scientific investigator could be\r\nduped, as he had been at Tedworth, much more those worthy but credulous\r\nfriends whom he quoted.\r\n\r\nFrom a simple assertion that he was presenting facts Glanvill went on to\r\nmake a plea used often nowadays in another connection by defenders of\r\nmiracles. If the ordinary mind, he said, could not understand \"every\r\nthing done by Mathematics and Mechanical Artifice,\"[9] how much more\r\nwould even the most knowing of us fail to understand the power of\r\nwitches. This proposition, the reader can see, was nothing more than a\r\nworking out of one of the principles of his philosophy. There can be no\r\ndoubt that he would have taken the same ground about miracles,[10] a\r\nposition that must have alarmed many of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his emphasis of fact, Glanvill was as ready as any to enter\r\ninto a theological disquisition. Into those rarefied regions of thought\r\nwe shall not follow him. It will perhaps not be out of order, however,\r\nto note two or three points that were thoroughly typical of his\r\nreasoning. To the contention that, if a wicked spirit could work harm by\r\nthe use of a witch, it should be able to do so without any intermediary\r\nand so to harass all of mankind all of the time, he answered that the\r\ndesigns of demons are levelled at the soul and can in consequence best\r\nbe carried on in secret.[11] To the argument that when one considers the\r\n\"vileness of men\" one would expect that the evil spirits would practise\r\ntheir arts not on a few but on a great many, he replied that men are not\r\nliable to be troubled by them till they have forfeited the \"tutelary\r\ncare and oversight of the better spirits,\" and, furthermore, spirits\r\nfind it difficult to assume such shapes as are necessary for \"their\r\nCorrespondencie with Witches.\" It is a hard thing for spirits \"to force\r\ntheir thin and tenuious bodies into a visible consistence.... For, in\r\nthis Action, their Bodies must needs be exceedingly compress'd.\"[12] To\r\nthe objection that the belief in evil beings makes it plausible that the\r\nmiracles of the Bible were wrought by the agency of devils,[13] he\r\nreplied that the miracles of the Gospel are notoriously contrary to the\r\ntendency, aims, and interests of the kingdom of darkness.[14] The\r\nsuggestion that witches would not renounce eternal happiness for short\r\nand trivial pleasures here,[15] he silenced by saying that \"Mankind acts\r\nsometimes to prodigious degrees of brutishness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to go further in quoting his arguments. Doubtless both\r\nquestions and answers seem quibbles to the present-day reader, but the\r\nforce of Glanvill's replies from the point of view of his contemporaries\r\nmust not be underestimated. He was indeed the first defender of\r\nwitchcraft who in any reasoned manner tried to clear up the problems\r\nproposed by the opposition. His answers were without question the best\r\nthat could be given.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for us to forget the theological background of\r\nseventeenth-century English thought. Given a personal Devil who is\r\nconstantly intriguing against the kingdom of God (and who would then\r\nhave dared to deny such a premise?), grant that the Devil has\r\nsupernatural powers (and there were Scripture texts to prove it), and\r\nit was but a short step to the belief in witches. The truth is that\r\nGlanvill's theories were much more firmly grounded on the bedrock of\r\nseventeenth-century theology than those of his opponents. His opponents\r\nwere attempting to use common sense, but it was a sort of common sense\r\nwhich, however little they saw it, must undermine the current religious\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nGlanvill was indeed exceedingly up-to-date in his own time. Not but that\r\nhe had read the learned old authors. He was familiar with what \"the\r\ngreat Episcopius\" had to say, he had dipped into Reginald Scot and\r\ndeemed him too \"ridiculous\" to answer.[16] But he cared far more about\r\nthe arguments that he heard advanced in every-day conversation. These\r\nwere the arguments that he attempted to answer. His work reflected the\r\ncurrent discussions of the subject. It was, indeed, the growing\r\nopposition among those whom he met that stirred him most. Not without\r\nsadness he recognized that \"most of the looser Gentry and small\r\npretenders to Philosophy and Wit are generally deriders of the belief of\r\nWitches and Apparitions.\"[17] Like an animal at bay, he turned fiercely\r\non them. \"Let them enjoy the Opinion of their own Superlative\r\nJudgements\" and run madly after Scot, Hobbes, and Osborne. It was, in\r\ntruth, a danger to religion that he was trying to ward off. One of the\r\nfundamentals of religion was at stake. The denial of witchcraft was a\r\nphase of prevalent atheism. Those that give up the belief in witches,\r\ngive up that in the Devil, then that in the immortality of the\r\nsoul.[18] The question at issue was the reality of the spirit world.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen why the man was tremendously in earnest. One may indeed\r\nwonder if his intensity of feeling on the matter was not responsible for\r\nhis accepting as _bona fide_ narratives those which his common sense\r\nshould have made him reject. In defending the authenticity of the\r\nremarkable stories told by the accusers of Julian Cox,[19] he was guilty\r\nof a degree of credulity that passes belief. Perhaps the reader will\r\nrecall the incident of the hunted rabbit that vanished behind a bush and\r\nwas transformed into a panting woman, no other than the accused Julian\r\nCox. This tale must indeed have strained Glanvill's utmost capacity of\r\nbelief. Yet he rose bravely to the occasion. Determined not to give up\r\nany well-supported fact, he urged that probably the Devil had sent a\r\nspirit to take the apparent form of the hare while he had hurried the\r\nwoman to the bush and had presumably kept her invisible until she was\r\nfound by the boy. It was the Nemesis of a bad cause that its greatest\r\ndefender should have let himself indulge in such absurdities.\r\n\r\nIn truth we may be permitted to wonder if the philosopher was altogether\r\ntrue to his own position. In his _Scepsis Scientifica_ he had talked\r\nhopefully about the possibility that science might explain what as yet\r\nseemed supernatural.[20] This came perilously near to saying that the\r\nrealms of the supernatural, when explored, would turn out to be natural\r\nand subject to natural law. If this were true, what would become of all\r\nthose bulwarks of religion furnished by the wonders of witchcraft? It\r\nlooks very much as if Glanvill had let an inconsistency creep into his\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nIt was two years after Glanvill's first venture that Meric Casaubon\r\nissued his work entitled _Of Credulity and Incredulity in Things\r\nNatural, Civil, and Divine_.[21] On account of illness, however, as he\r\ntells the reader in his preface, he had been unable to complete the\r\nbook, and it dealt only with \"Things Natural\" and \"Things Civil.\"\r\n\"Things Divine\" became the theme of a separate volume, which appeared in\r\n1670 under the title _Of Credulity and Incredulity in Things Divine and\r\nSpiritual: wherein ... the business of Witches and Witchcraft, against a\r\nlate Writer, [is] fully Argued and Disputed_. The interest of this\r\nscholar in the subject of witchcraft was, as we have seen, by no means\r\nrecent. When a young rector in Somerset he had attended a trial of\r\nwitches, quite possibly the identical trial that had moved Bernard to\r\nappeal to grand jurymen. We have noted in an earlier chapter[22] that\r\nCasaubon in 1654, writing on _Enthusiasm_, had touched lightly upon the\r\nsubject. It will be recalled that he had come very near to questioning\r\nthe value of confessions. Five years later, in prefacing a _Relation of\r\nwhat passed between Dr. Dee and some Spirits_, he had anticipated the\r\nconclusions of his _Credulity and Incredulity_. Those conclusions were\r\nmainly in accord with Glanvill. With a good will he admitted that the\r\ndenying of witches was a \"very plausible cause.\" Nothing was more liable\r\nto be fraud than the exhibitions given at trials, nothing less\r\ntrustworthy than the accounts of what witches had done. Too many cases\r\noriginated in the ignorance of ministers who were on the look-out \"in\r\nevery wild notion or phansie\" for a \"suggestion of the Devil.\"[23] But,\r\nlike Glanvill, and indeed like the spiritualists of to-day, he insisted\r\nthat many cases of fraud do not establish a negative. There is a very\r\nlarge body of narratives so authentic that to doubt them would be\r\nevidence of infidelity. Casaubon rarely doubted, although he sought to\r\nkeep the doubting spirit. It was hard for him not to believe what he had\r\nread or had been told. He was naturally credulous, particularly when he\r\nread the stories of the classical writers. For this attitude of mind he\r\nwas hardly to be censured. Criticism was but beginning to be applied to\r\nthe tales of Roman and Greek writers. Their works were full of stories\r\nof magic and enchantment, and it was not easy for a seventeenth-century\r\nstudent to shake himself free from their authority. Nor would Casaubon\r\nhave wished to do so. He belonged to the past both by religion and\r\nraining, and he must be reckoned among the upholders of\r\nsuperstition.[24]\r\n\r\nIn the next year, 1669, John Wagstaffe, a graduate of Oriel College who\r\nhad applied himself to \"the study of learning and politics,\" issued a\r\nlittle book, _The Question of Witchcraft Debated_. Wagstaffe was a\r\nuniversity man of no reputation. \"A little crooked man and of a\r\ndespicable presence,\" he was dubbed by the Oxford wags the little\r\nwizard.[25] Nevertheless he had something to say and he gained no small\r\nhearing. Many of his arguments were purely theological and need not be\r\nrepeated. But he made two good points. The notions about witches find\r\ntheir origin in \"heathen fables.\" This was an undercutting blow at those\r\nwho insisted on the belief in witchcraft as an essential of Christian\r\nfaith; and Wagstaffe, moreover, made good his case. His second argument\r\nwas one which no less needed to be emphasized. Coincidence, he believed,\r\naccounts for a great deal of the inexplicable in witchcraft\r\nnarratives.[26]\r\n\r\nWithin two years the book appeared again, much enlarged, and it was\r\nlater translated into German. It was answered by two men--by Casaubon in\r\nthe second part of his Credulity[27] and by an author who signed himself\r\n\"R. T.\"[28] Casaubon added nothing new, nor did \"R. T.,\" who threshed\r\nover old theological straw. The same can hardly be said of Lodowick\r\nMuggleton, a seventeenth-century Dowie who would fain have been a\r\nprophet of a new dispensation. He put out an exposition of the Witch of\r\nEndor that was entirely rationalistic.[29] Witches, he maintained, had\r\nno spirits but their own wicked imaginations. Saul was simply the dupe\r\nof a woman pretender.\r\n\r\nAn antidote to this serious literature may be mentioned in passing.\r\nThere was published at London, in 1673,[30] _A Pleasant Treatise of\r\nWitches_, in which a delightful prospect was opened to the reader: \"You\r\nshall find nothing here of those Vulgar, Fabulous, and Idle Tales that\r\nare not worth the lending an ear to, nor of those hideous Sawcer-eyed\r\nand Cloven-Footed Divels, that Grandmas affright their children withal,\r\nbut only the pleasant and well grounded discourses of the Learned as an\r\nobject adequate to thy wise understanding.\" An outline was offered, but\r\nit was nothing more than a thread upon which to hang good stories. They\r\nwere tales of a distant past. There were witches once, of course there\r\nwere, but that was in the good old days. Such was the author's\r\nimplication.\r\n\r\nAlas that such light treatment was so rare! The subject was, in the\r\nminds of most, not one for laughter. It called for serious\r\nconsideration. That point of view came to its own again in _The Doctrine\r\nof Devils proved to be the grand apostacy of these later Times_.[31] The\r\nDutch translator of this book tells us that it was written by a New\r\nEngland clergyman.[32] If that be true, the writer must have been one of\r\nthe least provincial New Englanders of his century, for he evinces a\r\nremarkable knowledge of the witch alarms and witch discussions in\r\nEngland. Some of his opinions betray the influence of Scot, as for\r\ninstance his interpretation of Christ's casting out of devils.[33] The\r\nterm \"having a devil\" was but a phrase for one distracted. The author\r\nmade, however, some new points. He believed that the importance of the\r\nNew Testament miracles would be overshadowed by the greater miracles\r\nwrought by the Devil.[34] A more telling argument, at least to a modern\r\nreader, was that the solidarity of society would be endangered by a\r\nbelief that made every man afraid of his neighbor.[35] The writer\r\ncommends Wagstaffe's work, and writes of Casaubon, \"If any one could\r\npossibly have bewitcht me into the Belief of Witchcraft, this reverend\r\nperson, of all others, was most like to have done it.\" He decries the\r\n\"proletarian Rabble,\" and \"the great Philosophers\" (More and Glanvill,\r\ndoubtless), who call themselves Christians and yet hold \"an Opinion that\r\nButchers up Men and Women without Fear or Witt, Sense or Reason, Care or\r\nConscience, by droves;\" but he praises \"the reverend judges of England,\r\nnow ... much wiser than before,\" who \"give small or no encouragement to\r\nsuch accusations.\"\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second great figure among the witch-ologists of the\r\nRestoration, John Webster. Glanvill and Webster were protagonist and\r\nantagonist in a drama where the others played somewhat the rôle of the\r\nGreek chorus. It was in 1677 that Webster put forth _The Displaying of\r\nSupposed Witchcraft_.[36] A Non-Conformist clergyman in his earlier\r\nlife, he seems to have turned in later years to the practice of\r\nmedicine. From young manhood he had been interested in the subject of\r\nwitchcraft. Probably that interest dates from an experience of his one\r\nSunday afternoon over forty years before he published his book. It will\r\nbe recalled that the boy Robinson, accuser of the Lancashire women in\r\n1634, had been brought into his Yorkshire congregation at an afternoon\r\nservice and had come off very poorly when cross-questioned by the\r\ncurious minister. From that time Webster had been a doubter. Now and\r\nagain in the course of his Yorkshire and Lancashire pastorates he had\r\ncome into contact with superstition. He was no philosopher, this\r\nYorkshire doctor of souls and bodies, nor was he more than a country\r\nscientist, and his reasoning against witchcraft fell short--as Professor\r\nKittredge has clearly pointed out[37]--of scientific rationalism. That\r\nwas a high mark and few there were in the seventeenth century who\r\nattained unto it. But it is not too much to say that John Webster was\r\nthe heir and successor to Scot. He carried weight by the force of his\r\nattack, if not by its brilliancy.[38] He was by no means always\r\nconsistent, but he struck sturdy blows. He was seldom original, but he\r\nfelled his opponents.\r\n\r\nMany of his strongest arguments, of course, were old. It was nothing new\r\nthat the Witch of Endor was an impostor. It was Muggleton's notion, and\r\nit went back indeed to Scot. The emphasizing of the part played by\r\nimagination was as old as the oldest English opponent of witch\r\npersecution. The explanation of certain strange phenomena\r\nas ventriloquism--a matter that Webster had investigated\r\npainstakingly--this had been urged before. Webster himself did not\r\nbelieve that new arguments were needed. He had felt that the \"impious\r\nand Popish opinions of the too much magnified powers of Demons and\r\nWitches, in this Nation were pretty well quashed and silenced\" by\r\nvarious writers and by the \"grave proceedings of many learned judges.\"\r\nBut it was when he found that two \"beneficed Ministers,\" Casaubon and\r\nGlanvill, had \"afresh espoused so bad a cause\" that he had been impelled\r\nto review their grounds.\r\n\r\nAs the reader may already have guessed, Webster, like so many of his\r\npredecessors, dealt largely in theological and scriptural arguments. It\r\nwas along this line, indeed, that he made his most important\r\ncontribution to the controversy then going on. Glanvill had urged that\r\ndisbelief in witchcraft was but one step in the path to atheism. No\r\nwitches, no spirits, no immortality, no God, were the sequences of\r\nGlanvill's reasoning. In answer Webster urged that the denial of the\r\nexistence of witches--_i. e._, of creatures endued with power from the\r\nDevil to perform supernatural wonders--had nothing to do with the\r\nexistence of angels or spirits. We must rely upon other grounds for a\r\nbelief in the spirit world. Stories of apparitions are no proof, because\r\nwe cannot be sure that those apparitions are made or caused by spirits.\r\nWe have no certain ground for believing in a spirit world but the\r\ntestimony of Scripture.[39]\r\n\r\nBut if we grant the existence of spirits--to modernize the form of\r\nWebster's argument--we do not thereby prove the existence of witches.\r\nThe New Testament tells of various sorts of \"deceiving Imposters,\r\nDiviners, or Witches,\" but amongst them all \"there were none that had\r\nmade a visible league with the Devil.\" There was no mention of\r\ntransformation into cats, dogs, or wolves.[40] It is hard to see how the\r\nmost literal students of the Scriptures could have evaded this argument.\r\nThe Scriptures said a great deal about the Devil, about demoniacs, and\r\nabout witches and magicians--whatever they might mean by those terms.\r\nWhy did they not speak at all of the compacts between the Devil and\r\nwitches? Why did they leave out the very essential of the witch-monger's\r\nlore?\r\n\r\nAll this needed to be urged at a time when the advocates of witchcraft\r\nwere crying \"Wolf! wolf!\" to the Christian people of England. In other\r\nwords, Webster was rendering it possible for the purely orthodox to give\r\nup what Glanvill had called a bulwark of religion and still to cling to\r\ntheir orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nIt is much to the credit of Webster that he spoke out plainly concerning\r\nthe obscenity of what was extorted from the witches. No one who has not\r\nread for himself can have any notion of the vile character of the\r\ncharges and confessions embodied in the witch pamphlets. It is an aspect\r\nof the question which has not been discussed in these pages. Webster\r\nstates the facts without exaggeration:[41] \"For the most of them are not\r\ncredible, by reason of their obscenity and filthiness; for chast ears\r\nwould tingle to hear such bawdy and immodest lyes; and what pure and\r\nsober minds would not nauseate and startle to understand such unclean\r\nstories ...? Surely even the impurity of it may be sufficient to\r\noverthrow the credibility of it, especially among Christians.\" Professor\r\nBurr has said that \"it was, indeed, no small part of the evil of the\r\nmatter, that it so long debauched the imagination of Christendom.\"[42]\r\n\r\nWe have said that Webster denied the existence of witches, that is, of\r\nthose who performed supernatural deeds. But, like Scot, he explicitly\r\nrefrained from denying the existence of witches _in toto_. He was, in\r\nfact, much more satisfactory than Scot; for he explained just what was\r\nhis residuum of belief. He believed that witches were evil-minded\r\ncreatures inspired by the Devil, who by the use of poisons and natural\r\nmeans unknown to most men harmed and killed their fellow-beings.[43] Of\r\ncourse he would have insisted that a large proportion of all those\r\ncharged with being such were mere dealers in fraud or the victims of\r\nfalse accusation, but the remainder of the cases he would have explained\r\nin this purely natural way.\r\n\r\nNow, if this was not scientific rationalism, it was at least\r\nstraight-out skepticism as to the supernatural in witchcraft. Moreover\r\nthere are cases enough in the annals of witchcraft that look very much\r\nas if poison were used. The drawback of course is that Webster, like\r\nScot, had not disabused his mind of all superstition. Professor\r\nKittredge in his discussion of Webster has pointed this out carefully.\r\nWebster believed that the bodies of those that had been murdered bleed\r\nat the touch of the murderer. He believed, too, in a sort of \"astral\r\nspirit,\"[44] and he seems to have been convinced of the truth of\r\napparitions.[45] These were phenomena that he believed to be\r\nsubstantiated by experience. On different grounds, by _a priori_\r\nreasoning from scriptural premises, he arrived at the conclusion that\r\nGod makes use of evil angels \"as the executioners of his justice to\r\nchasten the godly, and to restrain or destroy the wicked.\"[46]\r\n\r\nThis is and was essentially a theological conception. But there was no\r\nsmall gap between this and the notion that spirits act in supernatural\r\nways in our every-day world. And there was nothing more inconsistent in\r\nfailing to bridge this gap than in the position of the Christian people\r\ntoday who believe in a spirit world and yet discredit without\r\nexamination all that is offered as new evidence of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Webster was too busy at destroying the fortifications\r\nof his opponents to take the trouble to build up defences for himself.\r\nBut it is not too much to call him the most effective of the seventeenth\r\ncentury assailants of witch persecution in England.[47] He had this\r\nadvantage over all who had gone before, that a large and increasing body\r\nof intelligent people were with him. He spoke in full consciousness of\r\nstrong support. It was for his opponents to assume the defensive.\r\n\r\nWe have called John Webster's a great name in the literature of our\r\nsubject, and we have given our reasons for so thinking. Yet it would be\r\na mistake to suppose that he created any such sensation in his time as\r\ndid his arch-opponent, Glanvill. His work never went into a second\r\nedition. There are but few references to it in the writings of the time,\r\nand those are in works devoted to the defence of the belief. Benjamin\r\nCamfield, a Leicestershire rector, wrote an unimportant book on _Angels\r\nand their Ministries_,[48] and in an appendix assailed Webster. Joseph\r\nGlanvill turned fiercely upon him with new proofs of what he called\r\nfacts, and bequeathed the work at his death to Henry More, who in the\r\nseveral following editions of the _Sadducismus Triumphatus_ attacked him\r\nwith no little bitterness.\r\n\r\nWe may skip over three lesser writers on witchcraft. During the early\r\neighties John Brinley, Henry Hallywell, and Richard Bovet launched their\r\nlittle boats into the sea of controversy. Brinley was a bold plagiarist\r\nof Bernard, Hallywell a logical but dull reasoner from the Bible, Bovet\r\na weakened solution of Glanvill.[49]\r\n\r\nWe turn now from the special literature of witchcraft to a sketch of the\r\nincidental evidences of opinion. Of these we have a larger body than\r\never before, too large indeed to handle in detail. It would be idle to\r\nquote from the chap-books on witch episodes their _raisons d'être_. It\r\nall comes to this: they were written to confute disbelievers. They refer\r\nslightingly and even bitterly to those who oppose belief, not however\r\nwithout admitting their numbers and influence. It will be more to our\r\npurpose to examine the opinions of men as they uttered them on the\r\nbench, in the pulpit, and in the other walks of practical life.\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to learn what the judges were thinking. We\r\nlistened to Matthew Hale while he uttered the pronouncement that was\r\nheard all over England and even in the North American colonies. The\r\nexistence of witches, he affirmed solemnly, is proved by Scripture and\r\nby the universality of laws against them. Justice Rainsford in the\r\nfollowing years and Justice Raymond about twenty years later seem to\r\nhave taken Hale's view of the matter. On the other side were to be\r\nreckoned Sir John Reresby and Francis North. Neither of them was quite\r\noutspoken, fearing the rage of the people and the charge of atheism.\r\nBoth sought to save the victims of persecution, but rather by exposing\r\nthe deceptions of the accusers than by denying witchcraft itself. From\r\nthe vast number of acquittals in the seventies and the sudden dropping\r\noff in the number of witch trials in the eighties we know that there\r\nmust have been many other judges who were acquitting witches or quietly\r\nignoring the charges against them. Doubtless Kelyng, who, as a spectator\r\nat Bury, had shown his skepticism as to the accusations, had when he\r\nlater became a chief justice been one of those who refused to condemn\r\nwitches.\r\n\r\nFrom scientific men there were few utterances. Although we shall in\r\nanother connection show that a goodly number from the Royal Society\r\ncherished very definite beliefs--or disbeliefs--on the subject, we have\r\nthe opinions of but two men who were professionally scientists, Sir\r\nThomas Browne and Sir Robert Boyle. Browne we have already met at the\r\nBury trial. It may reasonably be questioned whether he was really a man\r\nof science. Certainly he was a physician of eminence. The attitude he\r\ntook when an expert witness at Bury, it will be recalled, was quite\r\nconsistent with the opinion given in his _Commonplace Book_. \"We are\r\nnoways doubtful,\" he wrote, \"that there are witches, but have not always\r\nbeen satisfied in the application of their witchcrafts.\"[50] So spoke\r\nthe famous physician of Norwich. But a man whose opinion was of much\r\nmore consequence was Sir Robert Boyle. Boyle was a chemist and \"natural\r\nphilosopher.\" He was the discoverer of the air pump, was elected\r\npresident of the Royal Society, and was altogether one of the greatest\r\nnon-political figures in the reign of Charles II. While he never, so far\r\nas we know, discussed witchcraft in the abstract, he fathered a French\r\nstory that was brought into England, the story of the Demon of Mascon.\r\nHe turned the story over to Glanvill to be used in his list of authentic\r\nnarratives; and, when it was later reported that he had pronounced the\r\ndemon story an imposture, he took pains to deny the report in a letter\r\nto Glanvill.[51]\r\n\r\nOf literary men we have, as of scientists, but two. Aubrey, the\r\n\"delitescent\" antiquarian and Will Wimble of his time, still credited\r\nwitchcraft, as he credited all sorts of narratives of ghosts and\r\napparitions. It was less a matter of reason than of sentiment. The\r\ndramatist Shadwell had the same feeling for literary values. In his\r\npreface to the play, _The Lancashire Witches_, he explained that he\r\npictured the witches as real lest the people should want \"diversion,\"\r\nand lest he should be called \"atheistical by a prevailing party who take\r\nit ill that the power of the Devil should be lessen'd.\"[52] But\r\nShadwell, although not seriously interested in any side of the subject\r\nsave in its use as literary material, included himself among the group\r\nwho had given up belief.\r\n\r\nWhat philosophers thought we may guess from the all-pervading influence\r\nof Hobbes in this generation. We have already seen, however, that Henry\r\nMore,[53] whose influence in his time was not to be despised, wrote\r\nearnestly and often in support of belief. One other philosopher may be\r\nmentioned. Ralph Cudworth, in his _True Intellectual System_, touched on\r\nconfederacies with the Devil and remarked in passing that \"there hath\r\nbeen so full an attestation\" of these things \"that those our so\r\nconfident Exploders of them, in this present Age, can hardly escape the\r\nsuspicion of having some Hankring towards Atheism.\"[54] This was\r\nGlanvill over again. It remains to notice the opinions of clergymen. The\r\nhistory of witch literature has been in no small degree the record of\r\nclerical opinion. Glanvill, Casaubon, Muggleton, Camfield, and Hallywell\r\nwere all clergymen. Fortunately we have the opinions of at least half a\r\ndozen other churchmen. It will be remembered that Oliver Heywood, the\r\nfamous Non-Conformist preacher of Lancashire, believed, though not too\r\nimplicitly, in witchcraft.[55] So did Samuel Clarke, Puritan divine and\r\nhagiographer.[56] On the same side must be reckoned Nathaniel Wanley,\r\ncompiler of a curious work on _The Wonders of the Little World_.[57] A\r\ngreater name was that of Isaac Barrow, master of Trinity, teacher of\r\nIsaac Newton, and one of the best preachers of his time. He declared\r\nthat to suppose all witch stories fictions was to \"charge the world with\r\nboth extreme Vanity and Malignity.\"[58] We can cite only one divine on\r\nthe other side. This was Samuel Parker, who in his time played many\r\nparts, but who is chiefly remembered as the Bishop of Oxford during the\r\ntroubles of James II with the university. Parker was one of the most\r\ndisliked ecclesiastics of his time, but he deserves praise at any rate\r\nfor his stand as to witchcraft. We do not know the details of his\r\nopinions; indeed we have nothing more than the fact that in a\r\ncorrespondence with Glanvill he questioned the opinions of that\r\ndistinguished protagonist of witchcraft.[59]\r\n\r\nBy this time it must be clear that there is possible no hard and fast\r\ndiscrimination by groups between those that believed in witchcraft and\r\nthose that did not. We may say cautiously that through the seventies and\r\neighties the judges, and probably too the justices of the peace,[60]\r\nwere coming to disbelieve. With even greater caution we may venture the\r\nassertion that the clergy, both Anglican and Non-Conformist, were still\r\nclinging to the superstition. Further generalization would be extremely\r\nhazardous. It looks, however, from the evidence already presented, as\r\nwell as from some to be given in another connection--in discussing the\r\nRoyal Society[61]--as if the scientists had not taken such a stand as\r\nwas to be expected of them.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the attitude of those who scoffed at the stories vouched\r\nfor by Glanvill and More it becomes evident that they assumed that\r\npractically all thinking men were with them. In other words, they\r\nbelieved that their group comprised the intellectual men of the time.\r\nNow, it would be easy to rush to the conclusion that all men who thought\r\nin conventional ways would favor witchcraft, and that those who took\r\nunconventional views would be arrayed on the other side, but this would\r\nbe a mistake. Glanvill was an exceedingly original man, while Muggleton\r\nwas uncommonly commonplace; and there were numbered among those who held\r\nto the old opinion men of high intelligence and brilliant talents.\r\n\r\nWe must search, then, for some other basis of classification. Glanvill\r\ngives us an interesting suggestion. In withering tone he speaks of the\r\n\"looser gentry and lesser pretenders to wit.\" Here is a possible line of\r\ncleavage. Might it be that the more worldly-minded among the county\r\nfamilies, that those too who comprised what we may call, in the absence\r\nof a better term, the \"smart set,\" and the literary sets of London, were\r\nespecially the \"deriders\" of superstition? It is not hard to believe\r\nthat Shadwell, the worldly Bishop Parker, and the polished Sir William\r\nTemple[62] would fairly reflect the opinions of that class. So too the\r\ndiarist Pepys, who found Glanvill \"not very convincing.\" We can conceive\r\nhow the ridicule of the supernatural might have become the fad of a\r\ncertain social group. The Mompesson affair undoubtedly possessed\r\nelements of humor; the wild tales about Amy Duny and Rose Cullender\r\nwould have been uncommonly diverting, had they not produced such tragic\r\nresults. With the stories spun about Julian Cox the witch accusers could\r\ngo no farther. They had reached the culmination of nonsense. Now, it is\r\nconceivable that the clergyman might not see the humor of it, nor the\r\nphilosopher, nor the scholar; but the worldly-minded Londoner, who cared\r\nless about texts in Leviticus than did his father, who knew more about\r\ncoffee-houses and plays, and who cultivated clever people with\r\nassiduity, had a better developed sense of humor. It was not strange\r\nthat he should smile quizzically when told these weird stories from the\r\ncountry. He may not have pondered very deeply on the abstract question\r\nnor read widely--perhaps he had seen Ady's book or glanced over\r\nScot's--but, when he met keen men in his group who were laughing quietly\r\nat narratives of witchcraft, he laughed too. And so, quite\r\nunobtrusively, without blare of trumpets, skepticism would slip into\r\nsociety. It would be useless for Glanvill and More to call aloud, or for\r\nthe people to rage. The classes who mingled in the worldly life of the\r\ncapital would scoff; and the country gentry who took their cue from them\r\nwould follow suit.\r\n\r\nOf course this is theory. It would require a larger body of evidence\r\nthan we can hope to gather on this subject to prove that the change of\r\nopinion that was surely taking place spread at first through the higher\r\nsocial strata and was to reach the lower levels only by slow filtration.\r\nYet such an hypothesis fits in nicely with certain facts. It has\r\nalready been seen that the trials for witchcraft dropped off very\r\nsuddenly towards the end of the period we are considering. The drop was\r\naccounted for by the changed attitude of judges and of justices of the\r\npeace. The judges avoided trying witches,[63] the justices were less\r\ndiligent in discovering them. But the evidence that we had about men of\r\nother occupations was less encouraging. It looked as if those who\r\ndispensed justice were in advance of the clergy, of the scholars,\r\nphysicians, and scientists of their time. Had the Master of Trinity, or\r\nthe physician of Norwich, or the discoverer of the air pump been the\r\njustices of the peace for England, it is not incredible that\r\nsuperstition would have flourished for another generation. Was it\r\nbecause the men of the law possessed more of the matter-of-factness\r\nsupposed to be a heritage of every Englishman? Was it because their\r\nspecial training gave them a saner outlook? No doubt both elements help\r\nto explain the difference. But is it not possible to believe that the\r\nsocial grouping of these men had an influence? The itinerant justices\r\nand the justices of the peace were recruited from the gentry, as none of\r\nthe other classes were. Men like Reresby and North inherited the\r\ntraditions of their class; they spent part of the year in London and\r\nknew the talk of the town. Can we doubt that their decisions were\r\ninfluenced by that fact? The country justice of the peace was removed\r\noften enough from metropolitan influences, but he was usually quick to\r\ncatch the feelings of his own class.\r\n\r\nIf our theory be true that the jurists were in advance of other\r\nprofessions and that they were sprung of a higher stock, it is of course\r\nsome confirmation of the larger theory that witchcraft was first\r\ndiscredited among the gentry. Yet, as we have said before, this is at\r\nbest a guess as to how the decline of belief took place and must be\r\naccepted only provisionally. We have seen that there are other\r\nassertions about the progress of thought in this period that may be\r\nventured with much confidence. There had been great changes of opinion.\r\nIt would not be fair to say that the movement towards skepticism had\r\nbeen accelerated. Rather, the movement which had its inception back in\r\nthe days of Reginald Scot and had found in the last days of James I a\r\nsecond impulse, which had been quietly gaining force in the thirties,\r\nforties, and fifties, was now under full headway. Common sense was\r\ncoming into its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Ferris Greenslet, _Joseph Glanvill_ (New York, 1900), 153. The\r\nwriter wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr. Greenslet's\r\nexcellent book on Glanvill.\r\n\r\n[2] The _Scepsis Scientifica_ was really _The Vanity of Dogmatising_\r\n(1661) recast.\r\n\r\n[3] See, for example, the introductory essay by John Owen in his edition\r\n(London, 1885), of the _Scepsis Scientifica_, xxvii, xxix.

Portions of his book would pass\r\nfor good thinking until one awakens to the feeling that he has read\r\nsomething like this before. As a matter of fact Brinley had stolen the\r\nline of thought and much of the phrasing from Richard Bernard (1627, see\r\nabove, pp. 234-236), and without giving any credit. A second edition of\r\nBrinley's work was issued in 1686. It was the same in every respect save\r\nthat the dedication was omitted and the title changed to _A Discourse\r\nProving by Scripture and Reason and the Best Authors Ancient and Modern\r\nthat there are Witches_.\r\n\r\nHenry Hallywell, a Cambridge master of arts and sometime fellow of\r\nChrist's College, issued in 1681 _Melampronoea, or a Discourse of the\r\nPolity and Kingdom of Darkness, Together with a Solution of the chiefest\r\nObjections brought against the Being of Witches_. Hallywell was another\r\nin the long list of Cambridge men who defended superstition. He set\r\nabout to assail the \"over-confident Exploders of Immaterial Substances\"\r\nby a course of logical deductions from Scripture. His treatise is slow\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nRichard Bovet, \"Gentleman,\" gave the world in 1684 _Pandæmonium, or the\r\nDevil's Cloyster; being a further Blow to Modern Sadduceism_. There was\r\nnothing new about his discussion, which he dedicates to Dr. Henry More.\r\nHis attitude was defensive in the extreme. He was consumed with\r\nindignation at disbelievers: \"They oppose their simple _ipse dixit_\r\nagainst the most unquestionable Testimonies\"; they even dare to \"affront\r\nthat relation of the Dæmon of Tedworth.\" He was indeed cast down over\r\nthe situation. He himself relates a very patent instance of witchcraft\r\nin Somerset; yet, despite the fact that numerous physicians agreed on\r\nthe matter, no \"justice was applyed.\" One of Bovet's chief purposes in\r\nhis work was to show \"the Confederacy of several Popes and Roman Priests\r\nwith the Devil.\" He makes one important admission in regard to\r\nwitchcraft; namely, that the confessions of witches might sometimes be\r\nthe result of \"a Deep Melancholy, or some Terrour that they may have\r\nbeen under.\"\r\n\r\n[50] _Works_, ed. of 1835-1836, IV, 389.\r\n\r\n[51] For Boyle's opinions see also Webster, _Displaying of Supposed\r\nWitchcraft_, 248.\r\n\r\n[52] He says also: \"For my part I am ... somewhat cotive of belief. The\r\nevidences I have represented are natural, viz., slight, and frivolous,\r\nsuch as poor old women were wont to be hang'd upon.\" The play may be\r\nfound in all editions of Shadwell's works. I have used the rare\r\nprivately printed volume in which, under the title of _The Poetry of\r\nWitchcraft_ (Brixton Hill, 1853), J. O.

This is not to say that the year of the\r\nRevolution marked any transition in the course of the superstition. It\r\ndid not. But we have ventured to employ it as a convenient date with\r\nwhich to bound the influences of the Restoration. The year 1718 derives\r\nits importance for us from the publication, in that year, of Francis\r\nHutchinson's _Historical Essay on Witchcraft_, a book which, it is not\r\ntoo much to say, gave the final blow to the belief in England.[1]\r\n\r\nWe speak of fixing a date by which to bound the influences of the\r\nRestoration. Now, as a matter of fact, there is something arbitrary\r\nabout any date. The influences at work during the previous period went\r\nsteadily on. The heathen raged, and the people imagined a vain thing.\r\nThe great proletariat hated witches as much as ever. But the justices of\r\nthe peace and the itinerant judges were getting over their fear of\r\npopular opinion and were refusing to listen to the accusations that were\r\nbrought before them. The situation was in some respects the same as it\r\nhad been in the later seventies and throughout the eighties. Yet there\r\nwere certain features that distinguished the period. One of them was the\r\nincreased use of exorcism. The expelling of evil spirits had been a\r\nsubject of great controversy almost a century before. The practice had\r\nby no means been forgotten in the mean time, but it had gained little\r\npublic notice. Now the dispossessors of the Devil came to the front\r\nagain long enough to whet the animosity between Puritans and Anglicans\r\nin Lancashire. But this never became more than a pamphlet controversy.\r\nThe other feature of the period was far more significant. The last\r\nexecutions for witchcraft in England were probably those at Exeter in\r\n1682.[2] For a whole generation the courts had been frowning on witch\r\nprosecution. Now there arose in England judges who definitely nullified\r\nthe law on the statute-book. By the decisions of Powell and Parker, and\r\nmost of all by those of Holt, the statute of the first year of James I\r\nwas practically made obsolete twenty-five or fifty years before its\r\nactual repeal in 1736. We shall see that the gradual breaking down of\r\nthe law by the judges did not take place without a struggle. At the\r\nfamous trial in Hertford in 1712 the whole subject of the Devil and his\r\nrelation to witches came up again in its most definite form, and was\r\nfought out in the court room and at the bar of public opinion. It was,\r\nhowever, but the last rallying and counter-charging on a battle-field\r\nwhere Webster and Glanvill had led the hosts at mid-day. The issue,\r\nindeed, was now very specific. Over the abstract question of witchcraft\r\nthere was nothing new to be said. Here, however, was a specific\r\ninstance. What was to be done with it? Over that there was waged a merry\r\nwar. Of course the conclusion was foregone. It had indeed been\r\nanticipated by the action of the bench.\r\n\r\nWe shall see that with the nullification of the law the common people\r\nbegan to take the law into their own hands. We shall note that, as a\r\nconsequence, there was an increase in the number of swimming ordeals and\r\nother illegal procedures.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Lancashire demonomania is not unlike the story of\r\nWilliam Somers in Nottingham a century before. In this case there was no\r\nJohn Darrel, and the exorcists were probably honest but deluded men. The\r\naffair started at the village of Surey, near to the superstition-brewing\r\nPendle Forest. The possessed boy, Richard Dugdale, was a gardener and\r\nservant about nineteen years of age.[3] In April, 1689, he was seized\r\nwith fits in which he was asserted to speak Latin and Greek and to\r\npreach against the sins of the place. Whatever his pretensions were, he\r\nseemed a good subject for exorcism. Some of the Catholics are said to\r\nhave tampered with him, and then several Puritan clergymen of the\r\ncommunity took him in hand. For eight months they held weekly fasts for\r\nhis recovery; but their efforts were not so successful as they had\r\nhoped. They began to suspect witchcraft[4] and were about to take steps\r\ntowards the prosecution of the party suspected.[5] This came to\r\nnothing, but Dugdale at length grew better. He was relieved of his fits;\r\nand the clergymen, who had never entirely given up their efforts to cure\r\nhim, hastened to claim the credit. More than a dozen of the dissenting\r\npreachers, among them Richard Frankland, Oliver Heywood,[6] and other\r\nwell known Puritan leaders in northern England, had lent their support\r\nto Thomas Jollie, who had taken the leading part in the praying and\r\nfasting. From London, Richard Baxter, perhaps the best known Puritan of\r\nhis time, had sent a request for some account of the wonder, in order to\r\ninsert it in his forthcoming book on the spirit world. This led to a\r\nplan for printing a complete narrative of what had happened; but the\r\nplan was allowed to lapse with the death of Baxter.[7] Meantime,\r\nhowever, the publication in London of the Mathers' accounts of the New\r\nEngland trials of 1692[8] caused a new call for the story of Richard\r\nDugdale. It was prepared and sent to London; and there in some\r\nmysterious way the manuscript was lost.[9] It was, however, rewritten\r\nand appeared in 1697 as _The Surey Demoniack, or an Account of Strange\r\nand Dreadful Actings in and about the Body of Richard Dugdale_. The\r\npreface was signed by six ministers, including those already named; but\r\nthe book was probably written by Thomas Jollie and John Carrington.[10]\r\nThe reality of the possession was attested by depositions taken before\r\ntwo Lancashire justices of the peace. The aim of the work was, of\r\ncourse, to add one more contemporary link to the chain of evidence for\r\nthe supernatural. It was clear to the divines who strove with the\r\npossessed boy that his case was of exactly the same sort as those in the\r\nNew Testament. Moreover, his recovery was a proof of the power of\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nNow Non-Conformity was strong in Lancashire, and the Anglican church as\r\nwell as the government had for many years been at no little pains to put\r\nit down. Here was a chance to strike the Puritans at one of their\r\nweakest spots, and the Church of England was not slow to use its\r\nopportunity. Zachary Taylor, rector of Wigan and chaplain to the Bishop\r\nof Chester, had already familiarized himself with the methods of the\r\nexorcists. In the previous year he had attacked the Catholics of\r\nLancashire for an exorcism which they claimed to have accomplished\r\nwithin his parish.[11] Pleased with his new rôle, he found in Thomas\r\nJollie a sheep ready for the shearing.[12] He hastened to publish _The\r\nSurey Impostor_,[13] in which, with a very good will, he made an assault\r\nupon the reality of Dugdale's fits, charged that he had been\r\npre-instructed by the Catholics, and that the Non-Conformist clergymen\r\nwere seeking a rich harvest from the miracles they should work.\r\nSelf-glorification was their aim. He made fun of the several divines\r\nengaged in the affair, and accused them of trickery and presumption in\r\ntheir conduct of the case.[14]\r\n\r\nOf course Taylor was answered, and with a bitterness equal to his own.\r\nThomas Jollie replied in _A Vindication of the Surey Demoniack_. \"I will\r\nnot foul my Paper,\" wrote the mild Jollie, \"and offend my reader with\r\nthose scurrilous and ridiculous Passages in this Page. O, the\r\nEructations of an exulcerated Heart! How desperately wicked is the Heart\r\nof Man!\"[15]\r\n\r\nWe shall not go into the details of the controversy, which really\r\ndegenerated into a sectarian squabble.[16] The only discussion of the\r\nsubject that approached fairness was by an anonymous writer,[17] who\r\nprofessed himself impartial and of a different religious persuasion from\r\nJollie. To be sure, he was a man who believed in possession by spirits.\r\nIt may be questioned, too, whether his assumption of fair dealing\r\ntowards the Church of England was altogether justified. But, at any\r\nrate, his work was free from invective and displayed moderation. He felt\r\nthat the Dissenting clergymen were probably somewhat deluded. But they\r\nhad acted, he believed, under good motives in attempting to help one who\r\nhad appealed to them. Some of them were not only \"serious good Men,\" but\r\nmen well known in the nation. This, indeed, was true. The Dissenters had\r\nlaid themselves open to attack, and doubtless some of them saw and\r\nregretted their mistake. At least, it seems not without significance\r\nthat neither Oliver Heywood nor Richard Frankland nor any other of the\r\nDissenters was sure enough of his ground to support Jollie in the\r\ncontroversy into which he had been led.[18]\r\n\r\nWe have gone into some detail about the Dugdale affair because of its\r\nimportance in its time, and because it was so essentially characteristic\r\nof the last era of the struggle over the power of the Devil. There were\r\ncases of possession not only in Lancashire but in Somersetshire and in\r\nand around London. Not without a struggle was His Satanic Majesty\r\nsurrendering his hold.\r\n\r\nWe turn from this controversy to follow the decisions of those eminent\r\njudges who were nullifying the statute against witches. We have already\r\nmentioned three names, those of Holt, Powell, and Parker. This is not\r\nbecause they were the only jurists who were giving verdicts of\r\nacquittal--we know that there must have been others--but because their\r\nnames are linked with significant decisions. Without doubt Chief Justice\r\nHolt did more than any other man in English history to end the\r\nprosecution of witches. Justice Powell was not so brave a man, but he\r\nhappened to preside over one of the most bitterly contested of all\r\ntrials, and his verdict served to reaffirm the precedents set by Holt.\r\nIt was Justice Parker's fortune to try the last case of witchcraft in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHolt became chief justice of the king's bench on the accession of\r\nWilliam and Mary. Not one of the great names in English judicial rolls,\r\nhis decided stand against superstition makes him great in the history of\r\nwitchcraft. Where and when he had acquired his skeptical attitude we do\r\nnot know. The time was past when such an attitude was unusual. In any\r\ncase, from the moment he assumed the chief justiceship he set himself\r\ndirectly against the punishment of witchcraft. As premier of the English\r\njudiciary his example meant quite as much as his own rulings. And their\r\ncumulative effect was not slight. We know of no less than eleven trials\r\nwhere as presiding officer he was instrumental in securing a verdict of\r\nacquittal. In London, at Ipswich, at Bury, at Exeter, in Cornwall, and\r\nin other parts of the realm, these verdicts were rendered, and they\r\ncould not fail to influence opinion and to affect the decisions of other\r\njudges. Three of the trials we shall go over briefly--those at Bury,\r\nExeter, and Southwark.\r\n\r\nIn 1694 he tried Mother Munnings at Bury St. Edmunds,[19] where his\r\ngreat predecessor Hale had condemned two women. Mother Munnings had\r\ndeclared that a landlord should lie nose upward in the church-yard\r\nbefore the next Saturday, and, sure enough, her prophecy had come true.\r\nNevertheless, in spite of this and other testimony, she was acquitted.\r\nTwo years later Holt tried Elizabeth Horner at Exeter, where Raymond had\r\ncondemned three women in 1682. Bishop Trelawny of Exeter had sent his\r\nsub-dean, Launcelot Blackburne (later to be Archbishop of York), to look\r\ninto the case, and his report adds something to the account which\r\nHutchinson has given us.[20] Elizabeth was seen \"three nights together\r\nupon a large down in the same place, as if rising out of the ground.\" It\r\nwas certified against her by a witness that she had driven a red-hot\r\nnail \"into the witche's left foot-step, upon which she went lame, and,\r\nbeing search'd, her leg and foot appear'd to be red and fiery.\" These\r\ntestimonies were the \"most material against her,\" as well as the\r\nevidence of the mother of some possessed children, who declared that her\r\ndaughter had walked up a wall nine feet high four or five times\r\nbackwards and forwards, her face and the fore part of her body parallel\r\nto the ceiling, saying that Betty Horner carried her up. In closing the\r\nnarrative the archdeacon wrote without comment: \"My Lord Chief Justice\r\nby his questions and manner of hemming up the evidence seem'd to me to\r\nbelieve nothing of witchery at all, and to disbelieve the fact of\r\nwalking up the wall which was sworn by the mother.\" He added, \"the jury\r\nbrought her in not guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThe case of Sarah Moordike of London _versus_ Richard Hathaway[21] makes\r\neven clearer the attitude of Holt. Sarah Moordike, or Morduck, had been\r\naccused years before by a Richard Hathaway of causing his illness. On\r\nseveral occasions he had scratched her. Persecuted by the rabble, she\r\nhad betaken herself from Southwark to London. Thither Richard Hathaway\r\nfollowed her and soon had several churches praying for his recovery. She\r\nhad appealed to a magistrate for protection, had been refused, and had\r\nbeen tried at the assizes in Guildford, where she was acquitted. By this\r\ntime, however, a good many people had begun to think Hathaway a cheat.\r\nHe was arrested and put under the care of a surgeon, who watched him\r\nclosely and soon discovered that the fasts which were a feature of his\r\npretended fits were false. This was not the first time that he had been\r\nproved an impostor. On an earlier occasion he had been trapped into\r\nscratching a woman whom he erroneously supposed to be Sarah Morduck. In\r\nspite of all exposures, however, he stuck to his pretended fits and was\r\nat length brought before the assizes at Southwark on the charge of\r\nattempting to take away the life of Sarah Moordike for being a witch. It\r\nis refreshing to know that a clergyman, Dr. Martin, had espoused the\r\ncause of the witch and had aided in bringing Hathaway to judgment. Chief\r\nJustice Holt and Baron Hatsell presided over the court,[22] and there\r\nseems to have been no doubt about the outcome. The jury \"without going\r\nfrom the bar\" brought Hathaway in guilty.[23] The verdict was\r\nsignificant. Pretenders had got themselves into trouble before, but were\r\nsoon out. The Boy of Bilston had been reproved; the young Robinson, who\r\nwould have sent to the gallows a dozen fellow-creatures, thought it hard\r\nthat he was kept a few months confined in London.[24] A series of cases\r\nin the reign of Charles I had shown that it was next to impossible to\r\nrecover damages for being slandered as a witch, though in the time of\r\nthe Commonwealth one woman had come out of a suit with five shillings to\r\nher credit. Of course, when a man of distinction was slandered,\r\ncircumstances were altered. At some time very close to the trial of\r\nHathaway, Elizabeth Hole of Derbyshire was summoned to the assizes for\r\naccusing Sir Henry Hemloke, a well known baronet, of witchcraft.[25]\r\nSuch a charge against a man of position was a serious matter. But the\r\nMoordike-Hathaway case was on a plane entirely different from any of\r\nthese cases. Sarah Morduck was not a woman of position, yet her accuser\r\nwas punished, probably by a long imprisonment. It was a precedent that\r\nwould be a greater safeguard to supposed witches than many acquittals.\r\n\r\nJustice Powell was not to wield the authority of Holt: yet he made one\r\ndecision the effects of which were far-reaching. It was in the trial of\r\nJane Wenham at Hertford in 1712. The trial of this woman was in a sense\r\nher own doing. She was a widow who had done washing by the day. For a\r\nlong time she had been suspected of witchcraft by a neighboring farmer,\r\nso much so that, when a servant of his began to act queerly, he at once\r\nlaid the blame on the widow. Jane applied to Sir Henry Chauncy, justice\r\nof the peace, for a warrant against her accuser. He was let off with a\r\nfine of a shilling, and she was instructed by Mr. Gardiner, the\r\nclergyman, to live more peaceably.[26] So ended the first act. In the\r\nnext scene of this dramatic case a female servant of the Reverend Mr.\r\nGardiner's, a maid just getting well of a broken knee, was discovered\r\nalone in a room undressed \"to her shift\" and holding a bundle of sticks.\r\nWhen asked to account for her condition by Mrs. Gardiner, she had a\r\ncurious story to tell. \"When she was left alone she found a strange\r\nRoaming in her head, ... her Mind ran upon Jane Wenham and she thought\r\nshe must run some whither ... she climbed over a Five-Bar-Gate, and ran\r\nalong the Highway up a Hill ... as far as a Place called Hackney-Lane,\r\nwhere she look'd behind her, and saw a little Old Woman Muffled in a\r\nRiding-hood.\" This dame had asked whither she was going, had told her to\r\npluck some sticks from an oak tree, had bade her bundle them in her\r\ngown, and, last and most wonderful, had given her a large crooked\r\npin.[27] Mrs. Gardiner, so the account goes, took the sticks and threw\r\nthem into the fire. Presto! Jane Wenham came into the room, pretending\r\nan errand. It was afterwards found out that the errand was fictitious.\r\n\r\nAll this raised a stir. The tale was absolutely original, it was no less\r\nremarkable. A maid with a broken knee had run a half-mile and back in\r\nseven minutes, very good time considering the circumstances. On the next\r\nday the maid, despite the knee and the fits she had meantime contracted,\r\nwas sent out on an errand. She met Jane Wenham and that woman quite\r\nproperly berated her for the stories she had set going, whereupon the\r\nmaid's fits were worse than ever. Then, while several people carefully\r\nwatched her, she repeated her former long distance run, leaping over a\r\nfive-bar gate \"as nimbly as a greyhound.\"\r\n\r\nJane Wenham was now imprisoned by the justice of the peace, who\r\ncollected with all speed the evidence against her. In this he was aided\r\nby the Reverend Francis Bragge, rector of Walkerne, and the Reverend\r\nMr. Strutt, vicar of Audley. The wretched woman asked the justice to\r\nlet her submit to the ordeal of water,[28] but he refused, pronouncing\r\nit illegal and unjustifiable. Meantime, the Rev. Mr. Strutt used the\r\ntest of the Lord's Prayer,[29] a test that had been discarded for half a\r\ncentury. She failed to say the prayer aright, and alleged in excuse that\r\n\"she was much disturbed in her head,\" as well she might be. But other\r\nevidence came in against her rapidly. She had been caught stealing\r\nturnips, and had quite submissively begged pardon, saying that she had\r\nno victuals that day and no money to buy any.[30] On the very next day\r\nthe man who gave this evidence had lost one of his sheep and found\r\nanother \"taken strangely, skipping and standing upon its head.\"[31]\r\nThere were other equally silly scraps of testimony. We need not go into\r\nthem. The two officious clergymen busied themselves with her until one\r\nof them was able to wring some sort of a confession from her. It was a\r\nnarrative in which she tried to account for the strange conduct of Anne\r\nThorne and made a failure of it.[32] A few days later, in the presence\r\nof three clergymen and a justice of the peace, she was urged to repeat\r\nher confession but was \"full of Equivocations and Evasions,\" and when\r\npressed told her examiners that they \"lay in wait for her Life.\"\r\n\r\nBragge and Strutt had shown a great deal of energy in collecting\r\nevidence. Yet, when the case came to trial, the woman was accused only\r\nof dealing with a spirit in the shape of a cat.[33] This was done on the\r\nadvice of a lawyer. Unfortunately we have no details about his reasons,\r\nbut it would look very much as if the lawyer recognized that the\r\ntestimony collected by the ministers would no longer influence the\r\ncourt, and believed that the one charge of using a cat as a spirit might\r\nbe substantiated. The assizes were largely attended. \"So vast a number\r\nof People,\" writes an eye-witness, \"have not been together at the\r\nAssizes in the memory of Man.\"[34] Besides the evidence brought in by\r\nthe justice of the peace, who led the prosecution with vigor, the Rev.\r\nMr. Bragge, who was not to be repressed because the charges had been\r\nlimited, gave some most remarkable testimony about the stuffing of Anne\r\nThorne's pillow. It was full of cakes of small feathers fastened\r\ntogether with some viscous matter resembling much the \"ointment made of\r\ndead men's flesh\" mentioned by Mr. Glanvill. Bragge had done a piece of\r\nresearch upon the stuff and discovered that the particles were arranged\r\nin geometrical forms with equal numbers in each part.[35] Justice Powell\r\ncalled for the pillow, but had to be content with the witness's word,\r\nfor the pillow had been burnt. Arthur Chauncy, who was probably a\r\nrelative of the justice of the peace, offered to show the judge pins\r\ntaken from Anne Thorne. It was needless, replied the judge, he supposed\r\nthey were crooked pins.[36] The leaders of the prosecution seem to have\r\nfelt that the judge was sneering at them throughout the trial. When Anne\r\nThorne was in a fit, and the Reverend Mr. Chishull, being permitted to\r\npray over her, read the office for the visitation of the sick, Justice\r\nPowell mockingly commented \"That he had heard there were Forms of\r\nExorcism in the Romish Liturgy, but knew not that we had any in our\r\nChurch.\"[37] It must have been a great disappointment to these Anglican\r\nclergymen that Powell took the case so lightly. When it was testified\r\nagainst the accused that she was accustomed to fly, Powell is said to\r\nhave said to her, \"You may, there is no law against flying.\"[38] This\r\nindeed is quite in keeping with the man as described by Swift: \"an old\r\nfellow with grey hairs, who was the merriest old gentleman I ever saw,\r\nspoke pleasing things, and chuckled till he cried again.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of Powell's obvious opinion on the trial, he could not hinder a\r\nconviction. No doubt the jury were greatly swayed by the crowds. The\r\njudge seems to have gone through the form of condemning the woman, but\r\ntook pains to see that she was reprieved.[39] In the mean time her\r\naffair, like that of Richard Dugdale, had become a matter of sectarian\r\nquarrel. It was stated by the enemies of Jane Wenham that she was\r\nsupported in prison by the Dissenters,[40] although they said that up to\r\nthis time she had never been a church-going woman. It was the Dugdale\r\ncase over again, save that the parties were reversed. Then Puritans had\r\nbeen arrayed on the side of superstition; now some of the Anglicans seem\r\nto have espoused that cause.[41] Of course the stir produced was\r\ngreater. Mistress Jane found herself \"the discourse of the town\" in\r\nLondon, and a pamphlet controversy ensued that was quite as heated as\r\nthat between Thomas Jollie and Zachary Taylor. No less than ten\r\nbrochures were issued. The justice of the peace allowed his story of the\r\ncase to be published and the Reverend Mr. Bragge rushed into print with\r\na book that went through five editions. Needless to say, the defenders\r\nof Jane Wenham and of the judge who released her were not hesitant in\r\nreplying. A physician who did not sign his name directed crushing\r\nridicule against the whole affair,[42] while a defender of Justice\r\nPowell considered the case in a mild-mannered fashion: he did not deny\r\nthe possibility of witchcraft, but made a keen impeachment of the\r\ntrustworthiness of the witnesses against the woman.[43]\r\n\r\nBut we cannot linger over the details of this controversy. Justice\r\nPowell had stirred up a hornets' nest of opposition, but it meant\r\nlittle.[44] The insects could buzz; but their stingers were drawn.\r\n\r\nThe last trial for witchcraft was conducted in 1717 at Leicester by\r\nJustice Parker.[45] Curiously enough, the circumstances connected with\r\nit make it evident that crudest forms of superstition were still alive.\r\nDecency forbids that we should narrate the details of the methods used\r\nto demonstrate the guilt of the suspected parties. No less than\r\ntwenty-five people banded themselves against \"Old woman Norton and\r\ndaughter\" and put them through tests of the most approved character. It\r\nneed hardly be said that the swimming ordeal was tried and that both\r\ncreatures \"swam like a cork.\" The persecutors then set to work to \"fetch\r\nblood of the witches.\" In this they had \"good success,\" but the witches\r\n\"would be so stubborn, that they were often forced to call the constable\r\nto bring assistance of a number of persons to hold them by force to be\r\nblooded.\"[46] The \"old witch\" was also stripped and searched \"publickly\r\nbefore a great number of good women.\" The most brutal and illegal of all\r\nforms of witch procedure had been revived, as if to celebrate the last\r\nappearance of the Devil. But the rest of the story is pleasanter. When\r\nthe case came before the grand jury at the assizes, over which Justice\r\nParker was presiding, \"the bill was not found.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the story of English trials comes to an end. The statute of\r\nJames I had been practically quashed, and, though it was not to be taken\r\nfrom the law books for nineteen years, it now meant nothing. It was very\r\nhard for the great common people to realize what had happened. As the\r\nlaw was breaking down they had shown an increasing tendency to take\r\njustice into their own hands. In the case with which we have just been\r\ndealing we have seen the accusers infringing the personal rights of the\r\nindividual, and calling in the constables to help them in their utterly\r\nunlawful performances. This was not new. As early as 1691, if Hutchinson\r\nmay be trusted, there were \"several tried by swimming in Suffolk, Essex,\r\nCambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire and some were drowned.\" It would be\r\neasy to add other and later accounts,[47] but we must be content with\r\none.[48] The widow Coman, in Essex, had recently lost her husband; and\r\nher pastor, the Reverend Mr. Boys, went to cheer her in her melancholy.\r\nBecause he had heard her accounted a witch he questioned her closely and\r\nreceived a nonchalant admission of relations with the Devil. That\r\nastounded him. When he sought to inquire more closely, he was put off.\r\n\"Butter is eight pence a pound and Cheese a groat a pound,\" murmured the\r\nwoman, and the clergyman left in bewilderment. But he came back in the\r\nafternoon, and she raved so wildly that he concluded her confession was\r\nbut \"a distraction in her head.\" Two women, however, worried from her\r\nfurther and more startling confessions. The minister returned, bringing\r\nwith him \"Mr. Goldsmith and Mr. Grimes,\" two of the disbelieving \"sparks\r\nof the age.\" The rest of the story may be told as it is given in another\r\naccount, a diary of the time. \"July 3d, 1699, the widow Coman was put\r\ninto the river to see if she would sinke, ... and she did not sinke but\r\nswim, ... and she was tryed again July 19, and then she swam again. July\r\n24 the widow was tryed a third time by putting her into the river and\r\nshe swam. December 27. The widow Coman that was counted a witch was\r\nburied.\" The intervening links need hardly be supplied, but the Reverend\r\nMr. Boys has given them: \"whether by the cold she got in the water, or\r\nby some other means, she fell very ill and dyed.\"\r\n\r\nIt must have been very diverting, this experimentation by water, and it\r\nhad become so popular by the beginning of the eighteenth century that\r\nChief Justice Holt[49] is said to have ruled that in the future, where\r\nswimming had fatal results, those responsible would be prosecuted for\r\nmurder. Such a declaration perhaps caused some disuse of the method for\r\na time, but it was revived in the second third of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nPopular feeling still arrayed itself against the witch. If the\r\nincreasing use of the swimming ordeal was the answer to the\r\nnon-enforcement of the Jacobean statute, it was the answer of the\r\nignorant classes. Their influence was bound to diminish. But another\r\npossible consequence of the breaking down of the law may be suggested.\r\nMr. Inderwick, who has looked much into English witchcraft, says that\r\n\"from 1686 to 1712 ... the charges and convictions of malicious injury\r\nto property in burning haystacks, barns, and houses, and malicious\r\ninjuries to persons and to cattle increased enormously.\"[50] This is\r\nvery interesting, if true, and it seems quite in accord with the history\r\nof witchcraft that it should be true. Again and again we have seen that\r\nthe charge of witchcraft was a weapon of prosecutors who could not prove\r\nother suspected crimes. As the charges of witchcraft fell off,\r\naccusations for other crimes would naturally be multiplied; and, now\r\nthat it was no longer easy to lay everything to the witch of a\r\ncommunity, the number of the accused would also grow.\r\n\r\nWe are now at the end of the witch trials. In another chapter we shall\r\ntrace the history of opinion through this last period. With the\r\ndismissal of the Norton women at Leicester, the courts were through with\r\nwitch trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See below, pp. 342-343.\r\n\r\n[2] We are assuming that the cases at Northampton in 1705 and at\r\nHuntingdon in 1716 have no basis of fact. At Northampton two women,\r\naccording to the pamphlet account, had been hanged and burnt; at\r\nHuntingdon, according to another account, a woman and her daughter. It\r\nis possible that these pamphlets deal with historical events; but the\r\nprobabilities are all against that supposition. For a discussion of the\r\nmatter in detail see below, appendix A, § 10.\r\n\r\n[3] For his early history see _The Surey Demoniack, ... or, an Account\r\nof Satan's ... Actings, In and about the Body of Richard Dugdale...._\r\n(London, 1697).\r\n\r\n[4] The Catholics do not seem, so far as the account goes, to have said\r\nanything about witchcraft.\r\n\r\n[5] _The Surey Demoniack_, 49; Zachary Taylor, _The Surey Impostor,\r\nbeing an answer to a ...

See _ibid._\r\n\r\n[10] Alexander Gordon in his article on Thomas Jollie, _Dict. Nat.\r\nBiog._, says that the pamphlet was drafted by Jollie and expanded by\r\nCarrington. Zachary Taylor, in his answer to it (_The Surey Impostor_),\r\nconstantly names Mr. Carrington as the author. \"N. N.,\" in _The\r\nLancashire Levite Rebuked_, also assumes that Carrington was the author.\r\n\r\n[11] _The Devil Turned Casuist, or the Cheats of Rome Laid open in the\r\nExorcism of a Despairing Devil...._ By Zachary Taylor, ...

Then came\r\n_The Lancashire Levite Rebuked_, by the unknown writer, \"N. N.,\" whose\r\nviews we give in the text. Taylor seems to have answered in a letter to\r\n\"N. N.\" which called forth a scathing reply (1698) in _The Lancashire\r\nLevite Rebuked, or a Farther Vindication of the Dissenters...._ Taylor's\r\nreply, which came out in 1699, was entitled _Popery, Superstition,\r\nIgnorance, and Knavery Confess'd and fully Proved on the Surey\r\nDissenters...._\r\n\r\n[17] \"N. N.\" _The Lancashire Levite Rebuked_. The Rev. Alexander Gordon,\r\nin his article on Zachary Taylor, _Dict. Nat. Biog._, says that\r\nCarrington probably wrote this book. This seems impossible. The author\r\nof the book, in speaking of Mr. Jollie, Mr. R. Fr. [Frankland], and Mr.\r\nO. H. [Oliver Heywood], refers to Mr. C. as having \"exposed himself in\r\nso many insignificant Fopperies foisted into his Narrative\"--proof\r\nenough that Carrington did not write _The Lancashire Levite Rebuked_.\r\n\r\n[18] Several dissenting clergymen had opposed the publication of _The\r\nSurey Demoniack_, and had sought to have it suppressed. See _The\r\nLancashire Levite Rebuked_, 2.\r\n\r\n[19] For an account of this case see Francis Hutchinson, _Historical\r\nEssay on Witchcraft_ (London, 1718), 43. Hutchinson had made an\r\ninvestigation of the case when in Bury, and he had also Holt's notes of\r\nthe trial.\r\n\r\n[20] Hutchinson had Holt's notes on this case, as on the preceding;\r\n_ibid._, 45. Blackburne's letter is printed in _Notes and Queries_, 1st\r\nseries, XI, 498-499, and reprinted in Brand, _Popular Antiquities_\r\n(1905), II, 648-649.\r\n\r\n[21] See _The Tryal of Richard Hathaway, ...

Susanna Fowles pretended to be\r\npossessed in such a way that she could not use the name of God or\r\nChrist. The application of a red-hot iron to her head in the midst of\r\nher fits was drastic but effectual. She cried out \"Oh Lord,\" and so\r\nproved herself a \"notorious Lyar.\" She was sent to the house of\r\ncorrection, where, reports the unfeeling pamphleteer, \"She is now\r\nbeating hemp.\" Another pamphlet, however, gives a very different\r\nversion. According to this account, Susan, under Papist influences,\r\npretended to be possessed in such a way that she was continually\r\nblaspheming. She was indicted for blasphemy, fined, and sentenced to\r\nstand in the pillory.

In\r\nattempting in this chapter to show the currents and cross-currents of\r\nopinion during the last period of witch history in England, we cannot\r\nomit some account of the pamphlet war over the Hertfordshire witch. It\r\nwill not be worth while, however, to take up in detail the arguments of\r\nthe upholders of the superstition. The Rev. Mr. Bragge was clearly on\r\nthe defensive. There were, he admitted sadly, \"several gentlemen who\r\nwould not believe that there are any witches since the time of our\r\nSaviour Jesus Christ.\" He struck the same note when he spoke of those\r\nwho disbelieved \"on the prejudices of education only.\" With great\r\nsatisfaction the clergyman quoted the decision of Sir Matthew Hale in\r\n1664.[1]\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the opposition are more entertaining, if their works did\r\nnot have so wide a sale. The physician who wrote to his friend in London\r\npoked fun at the witchmongers. It was dangerous to do so, he admitted,\r\n\"especially in the Country, where to make the least Doubt is a Badge of\r\nInfidelity.\"[2] As for him, he envied the privileges of the town. He\r\nproceeded to take up the case of Anne Thorne. Her seven-minute mile run\r\nwith a broken knee was certainly puzzling. \"If it was only a violent\r\nExtention of the Rotula, something might be allow'd: but it is hard to\r\ntell what this was, your Country Bone-Setters seldom plaguing their\r\nheads with Distinctions.\"[3] The \"Viciousness of Anne Thorn's\r\nopticks,\"[4] the silly character of the clergyman's evidence, and the\r\nspiritual juggles at exorcism,[5] all these things roused his merriment.\r\nAs for Jane's confession, it was the result of ensnaring questions.[6]\r\nHe seemed to hold the clergy particularly responsible for witch cases\r\nand advised them to be more conversant with the history of diseases and\r\nto inquire more narrowly into the physical causes of things.\r\n\r\nA defender of Justice Powell, probably Henry Stebbing, later an eminent\r\ndivine but now a young Cambridge master of arts, entered the\r\ncontroversy. He was not altogether a skeptic about witchcraft in\r\ngeneral, but his purpose was to show that the evidence against Jane\r\nWenham was weak. The two chief witnesses, Matthew Gilston and Anne\r\nThorne, were \"much disturbed in their Imaginations.\" There were many\r\nabsurdities in their stories. He cited the story of Anne Thorne's mile\r\nrun in seven minutes. Who knew that it was seven minutes? There was no\r\none timing her when she started. How was it known that she went half a\r\nmile? And, supposing these narratives were true, would they prove\r\nanything? The writer took up piece after piece of the evidence in this\r\nway and showed its absurdity. Some of his criticisms are amusing--he\r\nattacked silly testimony in such a solemn way--yet he had, too, his\r\nsense of fun. It had been alleged, he wrote, that the witch's flesh,\r\nwhen pricked, emitted no blood, but a thin watery matter. \"Mr. Chauncy,\r\nit is like, expected that Jane Wenham's Blood shou'd have been as rich\r\nand as florid as that of Anne Thorne's, or of any other Virgin of about\r\n16. He makes no difference, I see, between the Beef and Mutton Regimen,\r\nand that of Turnips and Water-gruel.\"[7] Moreover, he urges, it is well\r\nknown that fright congeals the blood.[8]\r\n\r\nWe need not go further into this discussion. Mr. Bragge and his friends\r\nre-entered the fray at once, and then another writer proved with\r\nelaborate argument that there had never been such a thing as witchcraft.\r\nThe controversy was growing dull, but it had not been without value. It\r\nhad been, on the whole, an unconventional discussion of the subject and\r\nhad shown very clearly the street-corner point of view. But we must turn\r\nto the more formal treatises. Only three of them need be noticed, those\r\nof Richard Baxter, John Beaumont, and Richard Boulton. All of these\r\nwriters had been affected by the accounts of the Salem witchcraft in New\r\nEngland. The opinions of Glanvill and Matthew Hale had been carried to\r\nAmerica and now were brought back to fortify belief in England. Richard\r\nBaxter was most clearly influenced by the accounts of what had happened\r\nin the New World. The Mathers were his friends and fellow Puritans, and\r\ntheir testimony was not to be doubted for a minute. But Baxter needed no\r\nconvincing. He had long preached and written about the danger of\r\nwitches. In a sermon on the Holy Ghost in the fifties he had shown a\r\nwide acquaintance with foreign works on demonology.[9] In a _Defence of\r\nthe Christian Religion_,[10] written several years later, he recognized\r\nthat the malice of the accusers and the melancholy of the accused were\r\nresponsible for some cases, but such cases were exceptions. If any one\r\ndoubted that there were _bona fide_ cases, let him talk to the judges\r\nand ministers yet living in Suffolk, Norfolk, and Essex. They could tell\r\nhim of many of the confessions made in the Hopkins period. Baxter had\r\nnot only talked on witchcraft with Puritan ministers, but had\r\ncorresponded as well with Glanvill, with whom, although Glanvill was an\r\nAnglican, he seems to have been on very friendly terms.[11] Nor is it\r\nlikely that in the many conversations he held with his neighbor, Sir\r\nMatthew Hale,[12] the evidence from witchcraft for a spiritual world had\r\nbeen neglected. The subject must have come up in his conversations with\r\nanother friend, Robert Boyle.[13] Boyle's interest in such matters was\r\nof course a scientific one. Baxter, like Glanvill, looked at them from a\r\nreligious point of view. In the classic _Saint's Everlasting Rest_ he\r\ndrew his fourth argument for the future happiness and misery of man\r\nfrom the Devil's compact with witches.[14] To this point he reverted in\r\nhis _Dying Thoughts_. His _Certainty of the World of Spirits_, in which\r\nhe took up the subject of witchcraft in more detail, was written but a\r\nfew months before his death. \"When God first awakened me, to think with\r\npreparing seriousness of my Condition after Death, I had not any\r\nobserved Doubts of the Reality of Spirits.... But, when God had given me\r\npeace of Conscience, Satan Assaulted me with those worse Temptations....\r\nI found that my Faith of Supernatural Revelation must be more than a\r\nBelieving Man and that if it had not a firm foundation, ... even sure\r\nEvidence of Verity, ... it was not like ... to make my Death to be safe\r\nand comfortable.... I tell the Reader, that he may see why I have taken\r\nthis Subject as so necessary, why I am ending my Life with the\r\npublication of these Historical Letters and Collections, which I dare\r\nsay have such Evidence as will leave every Sadduce that readeth them,\r\neither convinced, or utterly without excuse.\"[15]\r\n\r\nBy the \"Collection\" he meant, of course, the narratives brought out in\r\nhis _Certainty of the World of Spirits_--published in 1691. It is\r\nunnecessary to review its arguments here. They were an elaboration of\r\nthose already used in earlier works. Too much has been made of this\r\nbook. Baxter had the fever for publication. It was a lean year when he\r\ndashed off less than two works. His wife told him once that he would\r\nwrite better if he wrote less. Probably she was thinking of his style,\r\nand she was doubtless right. But it was true, too, of his thinking; and\r\nnone of his productions show this more than his hurried book on, spirits\r\nand witches.[16]\r\n\r\nBeaumont and Boulton may be passed over quickly. Beaumont[17] had read\r\nwidely in the witch literature of England and other countries;[18] he\r\nhad read indeed with some care, as is evidenced by the fact that he had\r\ncompared Hopkins's and Stearne's accounts of the same events and found\r\nthem not altogether consistent. Nevertheless Beaumont never thought of\r\nquestioning the reality of witchcraft phenomena, and his chief aim in\r\nwriting was to answer _The World Bewitched_, the great work of a Dutch\r\ntheologian, Balthazar Bekker, \"who laughs at all these things of this\r\nNature as done by Humane contrivance.\"[19] Bekker's bold book was\r\nindeed gaining wide notice; but this reply to it was entirely\r\ncommonplace. Richard Boulton, sometime of Brasenose College, published\r\nten years later, in 1715, _A Compleat History of Magic_. It was a book\r\nthrown together in a haphazard way from earlier authors, and was written\r\nrather to sell than to convince. Seven years later a second edition was\r\nbrought out, in which the writer inserted an answer to Hutchinson.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up Hutchinson's work we shall turn aside to collect those\r\nstray fragments of opinion that indicate in which direction the wind was\r\nblowing. Among those who wrote on nearly related topics, one\r\ncomparatively obscure name deserves mention. Dr. Richard Burthogge\r\npublished in 1694 an _Essay upon Reason and the Nature of Spirits_, a\r\nbook which was dedicated to John Locke. He touched on witchcraft in\r\npassing. \"Most of the relations,\" he wrote, \"do, upon impartial\r\nExamination, prove either Impostures of Malicious, or Mistakes of\r\nIgnorant and Superstitious persons; yet some come so well Attested that\r\nit were to bid defiance to all Human Testimony to refuse them\r\nbelief.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThis was the last stand of those who still believed. Shall we, they\r\nasked, discredit all human testimony? It was practically the belief of\r\nBishop William Lloyd of Worcester, who, while he urged his clergy to\r\ngive up their notions about witches, was inclined to believe that the\r\nDevil still operates in the Gentile world and among the Pagans.[21]\r\nJoseph Addison was equally unwilling to take a radical view. \"There\r\nare,\" he wrote in the _Spectator_ for July 14, 1711, \"some opinions in\r\nwhich a man should stand neuter.... It is with this temper of mind that\r\nI consider the subject of witchcraft.... I endeavour to suspend my\r\nbelief till I hear more certain accounts.... I believe in general that\r\nthere is, and has been, such a thing as witchcraft; but at the same time\r\ncan give no credit to any particular instance of it.\"[22] The force of\r\ncredulity among the country people he fully recognized. His Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley, who was a justice of the peace, and his chaplain were, he\r\nsaid, too often compelled to put an end to the witch-swimming\r\nexperiments of the people.\r\n\r\nIf this was belief, it was at least a harmless sort. It was almost\r\nexactly the position of James Johnstone, former secretary for Scotland,\r\nwho, writing from London to the chancellor of Scotland, declared his\r\nbelief in the existence of witches, but called attention to the fact\r\nthat the parliaments of France and other judicatories had given up the\r\ntrying of them because it was impossible to distinguish possession from\r\n\"nature in disorder.\"[23]\r\n\r\nBut there were those who were ready to assert a downright negative. The\r\nMarquis of Halifax in the _Political, Moral and Miscellaneous Thoughts\r\nand Reflections_ which he wrote (or, at least, completed) in 1694, noted\r\n\"It is a fundamental ... that there were witches--much shaken of\r\nlate.\"[24] Secretary of State Vernon and the Duke of Shrewsbury were\r\nboth of them skeptical about the confessions of witches.[25] Sir\r\nRichard Steele lampooned the belief. \"Three young ladies of our town,\"\r\nhe makes his correspondent relate, \"were indicted for witchcraft. One by\r\nspirits locked in a bottle and magic herbs drew hundreds of men to her;\r\nthe second cut off by night the limbs of dead bodies and, muttering\r\nwords, buried them; the third moulded pieces of dough into the shapes of\r\nmen, women, and children and then heated them.\" They \"had nothing to say\r\nin their own defence but downright denying the facts, which,\" the writer\r\nremarks, \"is like to avail very little when they come upon their\r\ntrials.\" \"The parson,\" he continued, \"will believe nothing of all this;\r\nso that the whole town cries out: 'Shame! that one of his cast should be\r\nsuch an atheist.'\"[26]\r\n\r\nThe parson had at length assimilated the skepticism of the jurists and\r\nthe gentry. It was, as has been said, an Anglican clergyman who\r\nadministered the last great blow to the superstition. Francis\r\nHutchinson's _Historical Essay on Witchcraft_, published in 1718 (and\r\nagain, enlarged, in 1720), must rank with Reginald Scot's _Discoverie_\r\nas one of the great classics of English witch literature. Hutchinson had\r\nread all the accounts of trials in England--so far as he could find\r\nthem--and had systematized them in chronological order, so as to give a\r\nconspectus of the whole subject. So nearly was his point of view that of\r\nour own day that it would be idle to rehearse his arguments. A man with\r\nwarm sympathies for the oppressed, he had been led probably by the case\r\nof Jane Wenham, with whom he had talked, to make a personal\r\ninvestigation of all cases that came at all within the ken of those\r\nliving.

II).\r\n\r\nA large part of the evidence for the trials of Elizabeth's reign is\r\nderived from the pamphlets issued soon after the trials. These pamphlets\r\nfurnish a peculiar species of historical material, and it is a species\r\nso common throughout the history of English witchcraft that it deserves\r\na brief examination in passing. The pamphlets were written of course by\r\ncredulous people who easily accepted what was told them and whose own\r\npowers of observation were untrained. To get at the facts behind their\r\nmarvellous accounts demands the greatest care and discrimination. Not\r\nonly must the miraculous be ruled out, but the prejudices of the\r\nobserver must be taken into account. Did the pamphleteer himself hear\r\nand see what he recorded, or was his account at second hand? Did he\r\nwrite soon after the events, when they were fresh in his memory? Does\r\nhis narrative seem to be that of a painstaking, careful man or\r\notherwise? These are questions to be answered. In many instances,\r\nhowever, the pamphlets were not narrative in form, but were merely\r\nabstracts of the court proceedings and testimony. In this case, too,\r\ncare must be taken in using them, for the testimony damaging to the\r\naccused was likely to be accented, while the evidence on the other side,\r\nif not suppressed, was not emphasized. In general, however, these\r\nrecords of depositions are sources whose residuum of fact it is not\r\ndifficult to discover. Both in this and in the narrative material the\r\nmost valuable points may be gleaned from the incidental references and\r\nstatements. The writer has made much use of this incidental matter. The\r\nposition of the witch in her community, the real ground of the feeling\r\nagainst her upon the part of her neighbors, the way in which the alarm\r\nspread, the processes used to elicit confession--inferences of this\r\nsort may, the writer believes, be often made with a good deal of\r\nconfidence. We have taken for granted that the pamphlets possess a\r\nsubstratum of truth. This may not always be the case. The pamphleteer\r\nwas writing to sell. A fictitious narrative of witchcraft or of a witch\r\ntrial was almost as likely to sell as a true narrative. More than once\r\nin the history of witch literature absolutely imaginary stories were\r\nfoisted upon the public. It is necessary to be constantly on guard\r\nagainst this type of pamphlet. Fortunately nine-tenths of the witch\r\naccounts are corroborated from other sources. The absence of such\r\ncorroboration does not mean that an account should be barred out, but\r\nthat it should be subjected to the methods of historical criticism, and\r\nthat it should be used cautiously even if it pass that test. Happily for\r\nus, the plan of making a witch story to order does not seem to have\r\noccurred to the Elizabethan pamphleteers. So far as we know, all the\r\npamphlets of that time rest upon actual events. We shall take them up\r\nbriefly in order.\r\n\r\nThe first was _The examination and confession of certaine Wytches at\r\nChensforde in the Countie of Essex before the Quenes maiesties Judges,\r\nthe XXVI daye of July Anno 1566_. The only original copy of this\r\npamphlet is in the Lambeth Palace library at London and its binding\r\nbears the initials of R. B. [Richard Bancroft]. The versified\r\nintroduction is signed by John Phillips, who presumably was the author.\r\nThe pamphlet--a black letter one--was issued, in three parts, from the\r\npress of William Powell at London, two of them on August 13, the third\r\non August 23, 1566. It has since been reprinted by H. Beigel for the\r\nPhilobiblon Society, London, 1864-1865. It gives abstracts of the\r\nconfessions and an account of the court interrogatories. There is every\r\nreason to believe that it is in the main an accurate account of what\r\nhappened at the Chelmsford trials in 1566. Justice Southcote, Dr. Cole,\r\nMaster Foscue, and Attorney-General Gerard are all names we can\r\nidentify. Moreover, the one execution narrated is confirmed by the\r\npamphlet dealing with the trials at Chelmsford in 1579.\r\n\r\nThe second pamphlet, also in black letter, deals with the Abingdon cases\r\nof 1579. It is entitled _A Rehearsall both straung and true of hainous\r\nand horrible actes committed by Elizabeth Stile, alias Rockingham,\r\nMother Dutten, Mother Devell, Mother Margaret. Fower notorious Witches\r\napprehended at Winsore in the Countie of Barks, and at Abington\r\narraigned, condemned and executed on the 28 daye of Februarie last anno\r\n1579_. This pamphlet finds confirmation by a reference in the privy\r\ncouncil records to the same event (_Acts P. C._, n. s., XI, 22).\r\nReginald Scot, in his _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 17, 543, mentions\r\nanother, a book of \"Richard Gallis of Windesor\" \"about certaine witches\r\nof Windsore executed at Abington.\" This would seem to have been a\r\ndifferent account of the Abingdon affair, because Scot also on p. 51\r\nspeaks of some details of the Abingdon affair as to be found \"in a\r\nlittle pamphlet of the acts and hanging of foure witches in anno 1579.\"\r\nIt is perhaps the one described by Lowndes, _Bibliographer's Manual of\r\nEnglish Literature_ (p. 2959) under the title _The horrible Acts of\r\nEliz. Style, alias Rockingham, Mother Dutton, Mother Dovell, and Mother\r\nMargaret, 4 Witches executed at Abingdon, 26 Feb. upon Richard Galis_\r\n(London, 1579) or that mentioned in the Stationers' _Registers_, II\r\n(London, 1875), 352, under date of May 4, 1579, as _A brief treatise\r\nconteyninge the most strange and horrible crueltye of Elizabeth Sule_\r\n[sic] _alias Bockingham_ [sic] _and hir confederates executed at\r\nAbingdon upon Richard Galis etc._\r\n\r\nThe second Chelmsford trials were also in 1579. The pamphlet account was\r\ncalled _A Detection of damnable driftes, practised by three Witches\r\narraigned at Chelmsforde in Essex at the last Assizes there holden,\r\nwhiche were executed in Aprill 1579_. There are three references in this\r\npamphlet to people mentioned in the earlier Chelmsford pamphlet, so that\r\nthe two confirm each other.\r\n\r\nThe third Chelmsford trials came in 1589 and were narrated in a pamphlet\r\nentitled _The apprehension and confession of three notorious Witches\r\narraigned and by Justice condemnede in the Countye of Essex the 5 day of\r\nJulye last past_. Joan Cunny was convicted, largely on the evidence of\r\nthe two bastard sons of one of her \"lewde\" daughters. The eldest of\r\nthese boys, who was not over ten or twelve, told the court that he had\r\nseen his grandmother cause an oak to be blown up by the roots during a\r\ncalm. The charges against Joan Upney concerned chiefly her dealings\r\nwith toads, those against Joan Prentice, who lived in an Essex\r\nalmshouse, had to do with ferrets. The three women seem to have been\r\nbrought first before justices of the peace and were then tried together\r\nand condemned by the \"judge of the circuit.\" This narrative has no\r\noutside confirmation, but the internal evidence for its authenticity is\r\ngood. Three men mentioned as sheriff, justice, and landowner can all be\r\nidentified as holding those respective positions in the county.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the St. Oses case appeared in 1582. It was called _A\r\nTrue and just Recorde of the Information, Examination and Confession of\r\nall the Witches taken at St. Oses in the countie of Essex: whereof some\r\nwere executed, and other some entreated according to the determination\r\nof Lawe.... Written orderly, as the cases were tryed by evidence, by W.\r\nW._ The pamphlet is merely a record of examinations. It is dedicated to\r\nJustice Darcy; and from slips, where the judge in describing his action\r\nbreaks into the first person, it is evident that it was written by the\r\njudge himself. Scot, who wrote two years later, had read this pamphlet,\r\nand knew of the case (_Discoverie_, 49, 542). There are many references\r\nto the case by later writers on witchcraft.\r\n\r\nEleven years later came the trials which brought out the pamphlet: _The\r\nmost strange and admirable discoverie of the three Witches of Warboys,\r\narraigned, convicted and executed at the last assises at Huntingdon ..._,\r\nLondon, 1593. Its contents are reprinted by Richard Boulton, in\r\nhis _Compleat History of Magick, Sorcery, and Witchcraft_ (London,\r\n1715), I, 49-152. There can be no doubt as to the historical character\r\nof this pamphlet. The Throckmortons, the Cromwells, and the Pickerings\r\nwere all well known in Huntingdonshire. An agreement is still preserved\r\nin the archives of the Huntingdon corporation providing that the\r\ncorporation shall pay £40 to Queen's College, Cambridge, in order that a\r\nsermon shall be preached on witchcraft at Huntingdon each Lady day. This\r\nwas continued for over two hundred years. One of the last sermons on\r\nthis endowment was preached in 1795 and attacked the belief in\r\nwitchcraft. The record of the contract is still kept in Queen's College,\r\nBrit. Mus. MSS., 5,849, fol. 254. For mention of the affair see Darrel,\r\n_Detection of that sinnful ... discours of Samuel Harshnet_, 36, 39,\r\n110; also Harsnett, _Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises_, 93, 97.\r\nSeveral Jacobean writers refer to the case. What seems to be another\r\nedition is in the Bodleian: _A True and Particular Observation of a\r\nnotable Piece of Witchcraft_--which is the inside heading of the first\r\nedition. The text is the same, but there are differences in the paging.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious of all Elizabethan witch pamphlets is entitled\r\n_The most wonderfull and true Storie of a certaine Witch named Alse\r\nGooderidge of Stapenhill, who was arraigned and convicted at Darbie, at\r\nthe Assizes there. As also a true Report of the strange Torments of\r\nThomas Darling, a boy of thirteen years of age, that was possessed by\r\nthe Devill, with his horrible Fittes and terrible apparitions by him\r\nuttered at Burton upon Trent, in the Countie of Stafford, and of his\r\nmarvellous deliverance_, London, 1597. There are two copies of this--the\r\nonly ones of which the writer knows--in Lambeth Palace library. They are\r\nexactly alike, page for page, except for the last four lines of the last\r\npage, where the wording differs. The pamphlet is clearly one written by\r\nJohn Denison as an abstract of an account by Jesse Bee. Harsnett,\r\n_Discovery of the Fraudulent Practices of John Darrel_, 266-269, tells\r\nhow these two books were written. Denison is quoted as to certain\r\ninsertions made in his manuscript after it left his hands, insertions\r\nwhich are to be found, he says, on pages 15 and 39. The insertions\r\ncomplained of by Denison are indeed to be found on the pages indicated\r\nof _The most wonderfull and true Storie of ... Alse Gooderidge_, thus\r\nestablishing his authorship of the pamphlet. The account by Bee, of\r\nwhich this is an abstract, I have not seen. Alse Gooderidge was put\r\nthrough many examinations and finally died in prison. \"She should have\r\nbeen executed, but that her spirit killed her in prison.\" John Darrel\r\nwas one of those who sought to help the boy who had been bewitched by\r\nAlice. Darrel, however, receives only passing mention from the author of\r\nthis pamphlet. The narrative does not agree very well in matters of\r\ndetail with the Darrel tracts, although in the main outlines it is\r\nsimilar to them. It is very crudely put together, and, while it was\r\ndoubtless a sincere effort to present the truth, must not be too\r\nimplicitly depended upon.\r\n\r\nTwo pamphlets are hidden away in the back of the _Triall of Maist.\r\nDorrel_ (see below, § 2). The first (pp. 92-98) deals with the trial of\r\nDoll Bartham of Shadbrook in Suffolk. She was tried by the chief justice\r\nand hanged the 12th of July, 1599. The second (pp. 99-103) narrates the\r\ntrial of Anne Kerke before \"Lorde Anderson,\" the 30th of December, 1599.\r\nShe also went to the gallows.\r\n\r\nThere are other pamphlets referred to in Lowndes, etc., which we have\r\nbeen unable to find. One of them is _The Arraignment and Execution of 3\r\ndetestable Witches, John Newell, Joane his wife, and Hellen Calles; two\r\nexecuted at Barnett, and one at Braynford, 1 Dec. 1595_. A second bears\r\nthe title _The severall Facts of Witchcrafte approved on Margaret\r\nHaskett of Stanmore_. 1585. Black letter. Another pamphlet in the same\r\nyear deals with what is doubtless the same case. It is _An Account of\r\nMargaret Hacket, a notorious Witch, who consumed a young Man to Death,\r\nrotted his Bowells and back bone asunder, who was executed at Tiborn, 19\r\nFeb. 1585_. London, 1585. A fourth pamphlet is _The Examination and\r\nConfession of a notorious Witch named Mother Arnold, alias Whitecote,\r\nalias Glastonbury, at the Assise of Burntwood in July, 1574: who was\r\nhanged for Witchcraft at Barking_. 1575.\r\n\r\nThe title _The case of Agnes Bridges and Rachel Pinder_, created by\r\nHazlitt, _Collections and Notes_, 1867-1876, out of the mention by\r\nHolinshed of a printed account, means but _The discloysing_, etc. (see\r\np. 351). The case--see Holinshed, _Chronicles_ (London, 1808), IV, 325,\r\nand Stow, Annales (London, 1631), p. 678, who put the affair in\r\n1574--was not of witchcraft, but of pretended possession. See above, p.\r\n59.\r\n\r\nTo this period must belong also _A true report of three Straunge\r\nWitches, lately found at Newnham Regis_, mentioned by Hazlitt\r\n(_Handbook_, p. 230). I have not seen it; but the printer is given as\r\n\"J. Charlewood,\" and Charlewood printed between 1562 and 1593. The\r\n_Stationers' Registers_, 1570-1587 (London; Shakespeare Soc., 1849), II,\r\n32, mention also the licensing in 1577 of _The Booke of\r\nWitches_--whatever that may have been.\r\n\r\nAmong pamphlets dealing with affairs nearly related to witchcraft may be\r\nmentioned the following:\r\n\r\n_A short treatise declaringe the detestable wickednesse of magicall\r\nsciences, as Necromancie, Coniuration of Spirites, Curiouse Astrologie\r\nand such lyke.... Made by Francis Coxe._ [London, 1561.] Black letter.\r\nCoxe had been pardoned by the Queen.\r\n\r\n_The Examination of John Walsh, before Master Thomas Williams,\r\nCommissary to the Reverend father in God, William, bishop of Excester,\r\nupon certayne Interrogatories touchyng Wytch-crafte and Sorcerye, in the\r\npresence of divers gentlemen and others, the XX of August, 1566._ 1566.\r\nBlack letter. John Ashton (_The Devil in Britain and America_, London,\r\n1896, p. 202) has called this the \"earliest English printed book on\r\nwitchcraft pure and simple\"; but it did not deal with witches and it was\r\npreceded by the first Chelmsford pamphlet.\r\n\r\n_The discloysing of a late counterfeyted possession by the devyl in two\r\nmaydens within the Citie of London._ [1574.] Black letter. The case is\r\nthat of Agnes Bridges and Rachel Pinder, mentioned above (pp. 59, 351).\r\n\r\n_The Wonderfull Worke of God shewed upon a Chylde, whose name is William\r\nWithers, being in the Towne of Walsam ... Suffolk, who, being Eleven\r\nYeeres of age, laye in a Traunce the Space of Tenne Days ... and hath\r\ncontinued the Space of Three Weeks_, London, 1581. Written by John\r\nPhillips. This pamphlet is mentioned by Sidney Lee in his article on\r\nJohn Phillips in the _Dict. Nat. Biog._\r\n\r\n_A Most Wicked worke of a Wretched Witch (the like whereof none can\r\nrecord these manie yeares in England) wrought on the Person of one\r\nRichard Burt, servant to Maister Edling of Woodhall in the Parrish of\r\nPinner in the Countie of Myddlesex, a myle beyond Harrow. Latelie\r\ncommitted in March last, An. 1592 and newly recognized acording to the\r\ntruth. By G. B. maister of Artes._ [London, 1593.] See Hazlitt,\r\nCollections and Notes, 1867-1877. The pamphlet may be found in the\r\nlibrary of Lambeth Palace. The story is a curious one; no action seems\r\nto have been taken.\r\n\r\n_A defensative against the poyson of supposed prophecies, not hitherto\r\nconfuted by the penne of any man; which being eyther uppon the warrant\r\nand authority of old paynted bookes, expositions of dreames, oracles,\r\nrevelations, invocations of damned spirits ... have been causes of great\r\ndisorder in the commonwealth and chiefly among the simple and unlearned\r\npeople._ Henry Howard, afterwards Earl of Northampton, was the author of\r\nthis \"defensative.\" It appeared about 1581-1583, and was revised and\r\nreissued in 1621.\r\n\r\nThree Elizabethan ballads on witches are noted by Hazlitt,\r\n_Bibliographical Collections and Notes_, 2d series (London, 1882): _A\r\nwarnynge to wytches_, published in 1585, _The scratchinge of the\r\nwytches_, published in 1579, and _A lamentable songe of Three Wytches of\r\nWarbos, and executed at Huntingdon_, published in 1593. Already in\r\n1562-3 \"a boke intituled _A poosye in forme of a visyon, agaynste wytche\r\nCrafte, and Sosyrye_,\" written \"in myter\" by John Hall, had been\r\npublished (_Stationers' Registers_, 1557-1570, p. 78).\r\n\r\nSome notion of the first step in the Elizabethan procedure against a\r\nwitch may be gathered from the specimens of \"indictments\" given in the\r\nold formula book of William West, _Simboleography_ (pt. ii, first\r\nprinted in 1594). Three specimens are given; two are of indictments \"For\r\nkilling a man by witchcraft upon the statute of Anno 5. of the Queene,\"\r\nthe third is \"For bewitching a Horse, whereby he wasted and became\r\nworse.\" As the documents in such bodies of models are usually genuine\r\npapers with only a suppression of the names, it is probable that the\r\ndates assigned to the indictments noted--the 34th and 35th years of\r\nElizabeth--are the true ones, and that the initials given, \"S. B. de C.\r\nin comit. H. vidua,\" \"Marg' L. de A. in com' E. Spinster,\" and \"Sara B.\r\nde C. in comitatu Eb. vidua,\" are those of the actual culprits and of\r\ntheir residences. Yorkshire is clearly one of the counties meant. It\r\nwas, moreover, West's own county.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2.--The Exorcists (see ch. IV).\r\n\r\nThe account of Elizabethan exorcism which we have given is necessarily\r\none-sided. It deals only with the Puritan movement--if Darrel's work may\r\nbe so called--and does not treat the Catholic exorcists. We have omitted\r\nthe performances of Father Weston and his coadjutors because they had\r\nlittle or no relation to the subject of witchcraft. Those who wish to\r\nfollow up this subject can find a readable discussion of it by T. G. Law\r\nin the _Nineteenth Century_ for March, 1894, \"Devil Hunting in\r\nElizabethan England.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a rather curious fact that the Puritan exorcist has never, except\r\nfor a few pages by S. R. Maitland, in his _Puritan Thaumaturgy_ (London,\r\n1842), been made a study. Without doubt he, his supporters, and his\r\nenemies were able between them to make a noise in their own time. To be\r\nconvinced of that one need only read the early seventeenth-century\r\ndramatists. It may possibly be that Darrel was not the mere impostor his\r\nenemies pictured him. Despite his trickery it may be that he had really\r\na certain hypnotic control over William Somers and perhaps over\r\nKatherine Wright.\r\n\r\nWhatever else Darrel may have been, he was a ready pamphleteer. His\r\ncareer may easily be traced in the various brochures put forth, most of\r\nthem from his own pen. Fortunately we have the other side presented by\r\nSamuel Harsnett, and by two obscure clergymen, John Deacon and John\r\nWalker. The following is a tentative list of the printed pamphlets\r\ndealing with the subject:\r\n\r\n_A Breife Narration of the possession, dispossession, and repossession\r\nof William Sommers: and of some proceedings against Mr. John Dorrel\r\npreacher, with aunsweres to such objections.... Together with certaine\r\ndepositions taken at Nottingham ..., 1598._ Black letter. This was\r\nwritten either by Darrel or at his instigation.\r\n\r\n_An Apologie, or defence of the possession of William Sommers, a yong\r\nman of the towne of Nottingham.... By John Darrell, Minister of Christ\r\nJesus...._ [1599?] Black letter. This work is undated, but, to judge\r\nfrom the preface, it was probably written soon after both Darrel and\r\nMore were imprisoned. It is quite clear too that it was written before\r\nHarsnett's _Discovery of the Fraudulent Practices of John Darrel_, for\r\nDarrel says that he hears that the Bishop of London is writing a book\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n_The Triall of Maist. Dorrel, or A Collection of Defences against\r\nAllegations.... 1599._ This seems written by Darrel himself; but the\r\nHuth catalogue (V, 1643) ascribes it to James Bamford.\r\n\r\n_A brief Apologie proving the possession of William Sommers. Written by\r\nJohn Dorrel, a faithful Minister of the Gospell, but published without\r\nhis knowledge.... 1599._\r\n\r\n_A Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel, Bacheler of\r\nArtes ..._, London, 1599. The \"Epistle to the Reader\" is signed \"S. H.,\"\r\n_i. e._, Samuel Harsnett, then chaplain to the Bishop of London. The\r\nbook is an exposure, in 324 pages, of Darrel's various impostures, and\r\nis based mainly on the depositions given in his trial at Lambeth.\r\n\r\n_A True Narration of the strange and grevous Vexation by the Devil of\r\nseven persons in Lancashire ..., 1600._ Written by Darrel. Reprinted in\r\n1641 with the title _A True Relation of the grievous handling of William\r\nSomers of Nottingham_. It is again reprinted in the _Somers Tracts_,\r\nIII, and is the best known of the pamphlets.\r\n\r\n_A True Discourse concerning the certaine possession and dispossession\r\nof 7 persons in one familie in Lancashire, which also may serve as part\r\nof an Answere to a fayned and false Discoverie.... By George More,\r\nMinister and Preacher of the Worde of God ..., 1600._ More was Darrel's\r\nassociate in the Cleworth performances and suffered imprisonment with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_A Detection of that sinnful, shamful, lying, and ridiculous discours of\r\nSamuel Harshnet._ 1600. This is Darrel's most abusive work. He takes up\r\nHarsnett's points one by one and attempts to answer them.\r\n\r\n_Dialogicall Discourses of Spirits and Divels by John Deacon [and] John\r\nWalker, Preachers_, London, 1601.\r\n\r\n_A Summarie Answere to al the Material Points in any of Master Darel his\r\nbookes, More especiallie to that one Booke of his, intituled, the\r\nDoctrine of the Possession and Dispossession of Demoniaks out of the\r\nword of God. By John Deacon [and] John Walker, Preachers_, London, 1601.\r\nThe \"one Booke\" now answered is a part of Darrel's _A True Narration_.\r\nThe _Discourses_ are dedicated to Sir Edmund Anderson and other men\r\neminent in the government and offer in excuse that \"the late bred\r\nbroyles ... doe mightilie over-runne the whole Realme.\"\r\n\r\n_A Survey of Certaine Dialogical Discourses, written by John Deacon and\r\nJohn Walker ...

In his\r\nfamous _Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_, 1603 and 1605, he\r\nshows to even better advantage than in the earlier work his remarkable\r\ntalents as an exposer and gives freer play to his wicked humor.\r\n\r\n_A True and Breife Report of Mary Glover's Vexation, and of her\r\ndeliverance by the meanes of fastinge and prayer.... By John Swan,\r\nstudent in Divinitie ..., 1603._\r\n\r\nThis narrates another exorcism in which a number of clergymen\r\nparticipated. Swan, the author, in his dedication to the king, takes up\r\nthe cudgels vigorously against Harsnett. Elizabeth Jackson was accused\r\nof having bewitched her, and was indicted. Justice Anderson tried the\r\ncase and showed himself a confirmed believer in witchcraft. But the king\r\nwas of another mind and sent, to examine the girl, a physician, Dr.\r\nEdward Jorden, who detected her imposture and explained it in his\r\npamphlet, _A briefe discourse of a disease called the Suffocation of the\r\nMother, Written uppon occasion which hath beene of late taken thereby,\r\nto suspect possession of an evill spirit...._ (London, 1603). He was\r\nopposed by the author of a book still unprinted, \"Mary Glover's late\r\nwoefull case ... by Stephen Bradwell.... 1603\" (Brit. Mus., Sloane,\r\n831). But see also below, appendix C, under 1602-1603.\r\n\r\nOne other pamphlet dealing with this same episode must be mentioned.\r\nHutchinson, _Historical Essay on Witchcraft_, and George Sinclar,\r\n_Satan's Invisible World Discovered_ (Edinburgh, 1685), had seen an\r\naccount by the Rev. Lewis Hughes (in his _Certaine Grievances_) of the\r\ncase of Mother Jackson, who was accused of bewitching Mary Glover.\r\nAlthough Hughes's tale was not here published until 1641-2, the events\r\nwith which it deals must all have taken place in 1602 or 1603. Sir John\r\nCrook is mentioned as recorder of London and Sir Edmund Anderson as\r\nchief justice. \"R. B.,\" in _The Kingdom of Darkness_ (London, 1688),\r\ngives the story in detail, although misled, like Hutchinson, into\r\nassigning it to 1642.\r\n\r\nIt remains to mention certain exorcist pamphlets of which we possess\r\nonly the titles:\r\n\r\n_A history of the case of Catherine Wright._ No date; written presumably\r\nby Darrel and given by him to Mrs. Foljambe, afterwards Lady Bowes. See\r\nC. H. and T. Cooper, _Athenae Cantabrigienses_ (Cambridge, 1858-1861),\r\nII, 381.\r\n\r\nDarrel says that there was a book printed about \"Margaret Harrison of\r\nBurnham-Ulpe in Norfolk and her vexation by Sathan.\" See _Detection of\r\nthat sinnfull ... discours of Samuel Harshnet_, 36, and _Survey of\r\nCertaine Dialogical Discourses_, 54.\r\n\r\n_The strange Newes out of Sommersetshire, Anno 1584, tearmed, a\r\ndreadfull discourse of the dispossessing of one Margaret Cooper at\r\nDitchet, from a devill in the likenes of a headlesse beare._ Referred to\r\nby Harsnett, _Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel_, 17.\r\n\r\nA ballad seems to have been written about the Somers case. Extracts from\r\nit are given by Harsnett, _ibid._, 34, 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3.--James I and Witchcraft and Notable Jacobean Cases (see chs. V,\r\nVI).\r\n\r\n_The Most Cruell and Bloody Murther committed by an Innkeepers Wife\r\ncalled Annis Dell, and her Sonne George Dell, Foure Yeares since....\r\nWith the severall Witch-crafts and most damnable practices of one Iohane\r\nHarrison and her Daughter, upon several persons men and women at\r\nRoyston, who were all executed at Hartford the 4 of August last past\r\n1606._ So far as the writer knows, there is no contemporary reference to\r\nconfirm the executions mentioned in this pamphlet. The story itself is a\r\nrather curious one with a certain literary flavor. This, however, need\r\nnot weigh against it. It seems possible rather than probable that the\r\nnarrative is a fabrication.\r\n\r\n_The severall notorious and lewd Cosenages of Iohn West and Alice West,\r\nfalsely called the King and Queene of Fayries ... convicted ... 1613_,\r\nLondon, 1613. This might pass in catalogues as a witch pamphlet. It is\r\nan account of two clever swindlers and of their punishment.\r\n\r\n_The Witches of Northamptonshire._\r\n\r\n _Agnes Browne_ } _Arthur Bill_     }\r\n _Joane Vaughan_} _Hellen Jenkenson_} _Witches._\r\n           _Mary Barber_            }\r\n\r\n_Who were all executed at Northampton the 22. of July last. 1612._\r\n\r\nConcerning this same affair there is an account in MS., \"A briefe\r\nabstract of the arraignment of nine witches at Northampton, July 21,\r\n1621\" (Brit. Mus., Sloane, 972). This narrative has, in common with the\r\nprinted narrative, the story of Mistress Belcher's and Master Avery's\r\nsufferings from witchcraft. It mentions also Agnes Brown and Joan Brown\r\n(or Vaughan) who, according to the other account, were hanged. All the\r\nother names are different. But it is nevertheless not hard to reconcile\r\nthe two accounts. The \"briefe abstract\" deals with the testimony taken\r\nbefore the justices of the peace on two charges; the _Witches of\r\nNorthamptonshire_ with the final outcome at the assizes. Three of those\r\nfinally hanged were not concerned in the first accusations and were\r\nbrought in from outlying districts. On the other hand, most of those who\r\nwere first accused by Belcher and Avery seem not to have been indicted.\r\n\r\n_The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the countie of Lancaster.

Thomas Potts has given us in this book the\r\nfullest of all English witch accounts. No other narrative offers such an\r\nopportunity to examine the character of evidence as well as the court\r\nprocedure. Potts was very superstitious, but his account is in good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n_Witches Apprehended, Examined and Executed, for notable villanies by\r\nthem committed both by Land and Water.

The\r\nstory is without doubt the same as that told in the preceding pamphlet.\r\nWe have no absolutely contemporary reference to this case. Edward\r\nFairfax, who wrote in 1622, had heard of the case--probably, however,\r\nfrom the pamphlet itself. But we can be quite certain that the narrative\r\nwas based on an actual trial and conviction. Some of the incidental\r\ndetails given are such as no fabricator would insert.\r\n\r\nIn the MS., \"How to discover a witch,\" Brit. Mus., Add. MSS., 36,674, f.\r\n148, there is a reference to a detail of Mother Sutton's ordeal not\r\ngiven in the pamphlet I have used.\r\n\r\n_A Treatise of Witchcraft....

D. and\r\nPreacher of Gods Word at Kings-Linne in Norffolke._ London, 1616. The\r\ncase of Mary Smith is taken up at p. 45. This account was dedicated to\r\nthe \"Maior\" and aldermen, etc., of \"Kings Linne\" and was no doubt\r\nsemi-official. It is reprinted in Howell, _State Trials_, II.\r\n\r\n_The Wonderful Discoverie of the Witchcrafts of Margaret and Phillip\r\nFlower, daughters of Joan Flower neere Bever Castle: executed at\r\nLincolne, March 11, 1618.

They are\r\nsupported moreover by Dekker and Ford's play, _The Witch of Edmonton_,\r\nwhich appeared within a year. Goodcole refers to the \"ballets\" written\r\nabout this case.\r\n\r\n_The Boy of Bilson: or A True Discovery of the Late Notorious Impostures\r\nof Certaine Romish Priests in their pretended Exorcisme, or expulsion of\r\nthe Divell out of a young Boy, named William Perry...._ London, 1622.\r\nPreface signed by Ryc. Baddeley. This is an account of a famous\r\nimposture. It is really a pamphlet against the Catholic exorcists. On\r\npp. 45-54 is given a reprint of the Catholic account of the affair; on\r\npp. 55-75 the exposure of the imposture is related. We can confirm this\r\naccount by Arthur Wilson, _Life and Reign of James I_, 107-111, and by\r\nJohn Webster, _Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft_, 274.\r\n\r\n_A Discourse of Witchcraft As it was acted in the Family of Mr. Edward\r\nFairfax of Fuystone in the County of York, in the year 1621._ Edited by\r\nR. Monckton Milnes (the later Lord Houghton) for vol. V of _Miscellanies\r\nof the Philobiblon Soc._ (London, 1858-1859, 299 pages). The editor says\r\nthe original MS. is still in existence. Edward Fairfax was a natural\r\nbrother of Sir Thomas Fairfax of Denton. He translated into English\r\nverse Tasso's _Jerusalem Delivered_, and accomplished other poetic\r\nfeats. His account of his children's bewitchment and of their trances is\r\nvery detailed. The book was again published at Harrogate in 1882, under\r\nthe title of _Dæmonologia: a Discourse on Witchcraft_, with an\r\nintroduction and notes by William Grainge.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4.--Matthew Hopkins (see ch. VIII).\r\n\r\n_A Most certain, strange and true Discovery of a Witch, Being overtaken\r\nby some of the Parliament Forces, as she was standing on a small\r\nPlanck-board and sayling on it over the River of Newbury, Together with\r\nthe strange and true manner of her death._ 1643. The tale told here is a\r\ncurious one. The soldiers saw a woman crossing the river on a plank,\r\ndecided that she was a witch, and resolved to shoot her. \"She caught\r\ntheir bullets in her hands and chew'd them.\" When the \"veines that\r\ncrosse the temples of the head\" were scratched so as to bleed, she lost\r\nher power and was killed by a pistol shot just below the ear. It is not\r\nimprobable that this distorted tale was based on an actual happening in\r\nthe war. See _Mercurius Civicus_, September 21-28, 1643.\r\n\r\n_A Confirmation and Discovery of Witch-craft ... together with the\r\nConfessions of many of those executed since May 1645....

This pamphlet has no outside evidence to confirm its\r\nstatements, but it has every appearance of being a true record of\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n_A true and exact Relation of the severall Informations, Examinations,\r\nand Confessions of the late Witches arraigned and executed in the County\r\nof Essex.

Reprinted London, 1837; also embodied in Howell, _State\r\nTrials_. This is a very careful statement of the court examinations,\r\ndrawn up by \"H. F.\" In names and details it has points of coincidence\r\nwith the _True Relation_ about the Bury affair; see next paragraph\r\nbelow. It is supported, too, by Arthur Wilson's account of the affair;\r\nsee Francis Peck, _Desiderata Curiosa_ (ed. of London, 1779), II, 476.\r\n\r\n_A True Relation of the Araignment of eighteene Witches at St.\r\nEdmundsbury, 27th August 1645.... As also a List of the names of those\r\nthat were executed._ London, 1645. There is abundance of corroborative\r\nevidence for the details given in this pamphlet. It fits in with the\r\naccount of the Essex witches; its details are amplified by Stearne,\r\n_Confirmation of Witchcraft_, Clarke, _Lives of sundry Eminent Persons_,\r\nJohn Walker, _Suffering of the Clergy ... in the Grand Rebellion_\r\n(London, 1714), and others. The narrative was written in the interim\r\nbetween the first and second trials at Bury.\r\n\r\n_Strange and fearfull newes from Plaisto in the parish of Westham neere\r\nBow foure miles from London_, London, 1645.

By authority._ London, 1645. The writer of this pamphlet\r\nacknowledges his indebtedness to Potts, _Discoverie of Witches in the\r\ncountie of Lancaster_ (1613), and to Bernard, _Guide to Grand Jurymen_\r\n(1627). These books had been used by Stearne and doubtless by Hopkins.\r\nThis pamphlet expresses Hopkins's ideas, it is written in Hopkins's\r\nstyle--so far as we know it--and it may have been the work of the\r\nwitchfinder himself. That might explain, too, the \"by authority\" of the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n_Signes and Wonders from Heaven.... Likewise a new discovery of Witches\r\nin Stepney Parish. And how 20.

And now\r\npublished by Matthew Hopkins, Witchfinder. For the Benefit of the Whole\r\nKingdome...._ London, 1647. Hopkins's and Stearne's accounts fit into\r\neach other and are the two best sources for ch. VIII.\r\n\r\n_The [D]Ivell in Kent, or His strange Delusions at Sandwitch_, London,\r\n1647.

In the\r\nfirst narrative a woman after hearing a sermon fell into fits. The\r\nsecond narrative was probably based upon a combination of facts and\r\nrumor.\r\n\r\n_The Full Tryals, Examination and Condemnation of Four Notorious\r\nWitches, At the Assizes held in Worcester on Tuseday the 4th of March\r\n...

Another edition of this pamphlet (in the Bodleian) bears\r\nthe date 1700 and was printed for \"J. M.\" in Fleet street. This is a\r\nmost interesting example of a made-to-order witch pamphlet. The preface\r\nmakes one suspect its character: \"the following narrative coming to my\r\nhand.\" The accused were Rebecca West, Margaret Landis, Susan Cook, and\r\nRose Hallybread. Now, all these women were tried at Chelmsford in 1645,\r\nand their examinations and confessions printed in _A true and exact\r\nRelation_. The wording has been changed a little, several things have\r\nbeen added, but the facts are similar; see _A true and exact\r\nRelation_,10, 11, 13-15, 27. When the author of the Worcester pamphlet\r\ncame to narrate the execution he wandered away from his text and\r\ninvented some new particulars. The women were \"burnt at the stak.\" They\r\nmade a \"yelling and howling.\" Two of them were very \"stubborn and\r\nrefractory.\" _Cf._ below, § 10.\r\n\r\n_The Devill seen at St. Albans, Being a true Relation How the Devill was\r\nseen there in a Cellar, in the likenesse of a Ram; and how a Butcher\r\ncame and cut his throat, and sold some of it, and dressed the rest for\r\nhimselfe, inviting many to supper_ ..., 1648.

IX).\r\n\r\n_The Divels Delusions or A faithfull relation of John Palmer and\r\nElizabeth Knott two notorious Witches lately condemned at the Sessions\r\nof Oyer and Terminer in St. Albans ..._, 1649. The narrative purports to\r\nbe taken from a letter sent from St. Alban's. It deals with the\r\npractices of two good witches who were finally discovered to be black\r\nwitches. The tale has no outside confirmation.\r\n\r\n_Wonderfull News from the North, Or a True Relation of the Sad and\r\nGrievous Torments Inflicted upon the Bodies of three Children of Mr.\r\nGeorge Muschamp, late of the County of Northumberland, by Witchcraft,\r\n...

Preface signed: \"Thine, Mary\r\nMoore.\" This pamphlet bears all through the marks of a true narrative.\r\nIt is written evidently by a friend of the Mistress Muschamp who had\r\nsuch difficulty in persuading the north country justices, judges, and\r\nsheriffs to act. The names and the circumstances fit in with other known\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n_The strange Witch at Greenwich haunting a Wench_, 1650. Unimportant.\r\n\r\n_A Strange Witch at Greenwich_, 1650.\r\n\r\nThe last two pamphlets are mentioned by Lowndes. The second pamphlet I\r\nhave not seen; as, however, Lowndes cites the title of the first\r\nincorrectly, it is very possible that he has given two titles for the\r\nsame pamphlet.\r\n\r\n_The Witch of Wapping, or an Exact and Perfect Relation of the Life and\r\nDevilish Practises of Joan Peterson, who dwelt in Spruce Island, near\r\nWapping; Who was condemned for practising Witchcraft, and sentenced to\r\nbe Hanged at Tyburn, on Munday the 11th of April 1652_, London, 1652.\r\n\r\n_A Declaration in Answer to several lying Pamphlets concerning the Witch\r\nof Wapping, ... shewing the Bloudy Plot and wicked Conspiracy of one\r\nAbraham Vandenhemde, Thomas Crompton, Thomas Collet, and others_,\r\nLondon, 1652.

Bower's second and more detailed account. It\r\nis dedicated to the judge by the writer, who had a large part in the\r\naffair and frequently interviewed the witch. He does not present a\r\nrecord of examinations, but gives a detailed narrative of the entire\r\naffair. He throws out hints about certain phases of the case and rouses\r\ncuriosity without satisfying it. His story of Anne Bodenham is, however,\r\nclear and interesting. The celebrated Aubrey refers to the case in his\r\n_Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme_, 261. His account, which tallies\r\nwell with that of Bower, he seems to have derived from Anthony Ettrick\r\n\"of the Middle Temple,\" who was a \"curious observer of the whole\r\ntriall.\"\r\n\r\n_A Prodigious and Tragicall History of the Arraignment, Tryall,\r\nConfession, and Condemnation of six Witches at Maidstone, in Kent, at\r\nthe Assizes there held in July, Fryday 30, this present year, 1652.\r\nBefore the Right Honourable, Peter Warburton....

This is a \"Relation of a woman who heretofore\r\nprofessing Religion in the purity thereof fel afterwards to be a\r\nsectary, and then to be acquainted with Astrologers, and afterwards with\r\nthe Divel himself.\" A poor woman \"naturally inclin'd to melancholy\"\r\nbelieved she had made a contract with the Devil. \"Many Ministers are\r\ndayly with her.\"\r\n\r\n_The Snare of the Devill Discovered: Or, A True and perfect Relation of\r\nthe sad and deplorable Condition of Lydia the Wife of John Rogers House\r\nCarpenter, living in Greenbank in Pumpe alley in Wappin.... Also her\r\nExamination by Mr. Johnson the Minister of Wappin, and her Confession.\r\nAs also in what a sad Condition she continues...._ London, 1658. Another\r\ntract against the Baptists. In spite of Lydia Rogers's supposed contract\r\nwith the Devil, she does not seem to have been brought into court.\r\n\r\n_Strange and Terrible Newes from Cambridge, being A true Relation of the\r\nQuakers bewitching of Mary Philips ... into the shape of a Bay Mare,\r\nriding her from Dinton towards the University. With the manner how she\r\nbecame visible again ... in her own Likeness and Shape, with her sides\r\nall rent and torn, as if they had been spur-galled, ... and the Names of\r\nthe Quakers brought to tryal on Friday last at the Assises held at\r\nCambridge ..._, London, 1659. This is mentioned by John Ashton in the\r\nbibliographical appendix to his _The Devil in Britain and America_.\r\n\r\n_The Just Devil of Woodstock, or a true narrative of the severall\r\napparitions, the frights and punishments inflicted upon the Rumpish\r\ncommissioners sent thither to survey the manors and houses belonging to\r\nHis Majesty._ 1660. Wood, _Athenae Oxonienses_ (ed. of 1817), III, 398,\r\nascribes this to Thomas Widdowes. It was on the affair described in this\r\npamphlet that Walter Scott based his novel _Woodstock_. The story given\r\nin the pamphlet may be found in Sinclar's _Satan's Invisible World\r\nDiscovered_. The writer has not seen the original pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6.--Charles II and James II (see ch. XI).\r\n\r\n_The Power of Witchcraft, Being a most strange but true Relation of the\r\nmost miraculous and wonderful deliverance of one Mr. William Harrison of\r\nCambden in the County of Gloucester, Steward to the Lady Nowel ..._,\r\nLondon, 1662.\r\n\r\n_A True and Perfect Account of the Examination, Confession, Tryal,\r\nCondemnation and Execution of Joan Perry and her two Sons ... for the\r\nsupposed murder of William Harrison, Gent ..._, London, 1676. These are\r\nreally not witchcraft pamphlets. Mr. Harrison disappears, three people\r\nare charged with his murder and hanged. Mr. Harrison comes back from\r\nTurkey in two years and tells a story of his disappearance which leads\r\nto the supposition that he was transported thither by witchcraft.\r\n\r\n_A Tryal of Witches at the assizes held at Bury St. Edmonds for the\r\nCounty of Suffolk; on the tenth day of March, 1664_, London, 1682;\r\nanother edition, 1716. The writer of this tract writes in introducing\r\nit: \"This Tryal of Witches hath lain a long time in a private\r\nGentleman's Hands in the Country, it being given to him by the Person\r\nthat took it in the Court for his own satisfaction.\" This is the much\r\nquoted case before Sir Matthew Hale. The pamphlet presents one of the\r\nmost detailed accounts of the court procedure in a witch case.\r\n\r\n_The Lord's Arm Stretched Out in an Answer of Prayer or a True Relation\r\nof the wonderful Deliverance of James Barrow, the Son of John Barrow of\r\nOlaves Southwark_, London, 1664. This seems to be a Baptist pamphlet.\r\n\r\n_The wonder of Suffolke, being a true relation of one that reports he\r\nmade a league with the Devil for three years, to do mischief, and now\r\nbreaks open houses, robs people daily, ... and can neither be shot nor\r\ntaken, but leaps over walls fifteen feet high, runs five or six miles in\r\na quarter of an hour, and sometimes vanishes in the midst of multitudes\r\nthat go to take him. Faithfully written in a letter from a solemn\r\nperson, dated not long since, to a friend in Ship-yard, near Temple-bar,\r\nand ready to be attested by hundreds ..._, London, 1677. This is\r\nmentioned in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, 1829, pt. ii, 584. I have not\r\nseen a copy of the pamphlet.\r\n\r\n_Daimonomageia: a small Treatise of Sicknesses and Diseases from\r\nWitchcraft and Supernatural Causes.... Being useful to others besides\r\nPhysicians, in that it confutes Atheistical, Sadducistical, and\r\nSceptical Principles and Imaginations ..._, London, 1665. Though its\r\ntitle-page bears no name, the author was undoubtedly that \"William\r\nDrage, D. P. [Doctor of Physic] at Hitchin,\" in Hertfordshire, to whose\r\nlarger treatise on medicine (first printed in 1664 as _A Physical\r\nNosonomy_, then in 1666 as _The Practice of Physick_, and again in 1668\r\nas _Physical Experiments_) it seems to be a usual appendage. It is so,\r\nat least, in the Cornell copy of the first edition and in the Harvard\r\ncopy of the third, and is so described by the _Dict. Nat. Biog._ and by\r\nthe British Museum catalogue.\r\n\r\n_Hartford-shire Wonder. Or, Strange News from Ware, Being an Exact and\r\ntrue Relation of one Jane Stretton ... who hath been visited in a\r\nstrange kind of manner by extraordinary and unusual fits ..._, London,\r\n1669.

The writer of this leaflet claims to have\r\ntranscribed his account from an account in \"Judge Chancy's own hand\".\r\nChauncy was the justice of the peace who with Bragge stood behind the\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to straighten out the authorship of these various\r\npamphlets. The Rev. Mr. Bragge wrote several. The Rev. Mr. Gardiner and\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Strutt, who were active in the case, may have written two\r\nof them. The topographer Gough, writing about 1780, declared that the\r\nlate Dr. Stebbing had as a young man participated in the controversy.\r\nFrancis Hutchinson was an interested spectator, but probably did not\r\ncontribute to the literature of the subject.\r\n\r\nA short secondary account is that of W. B. Gerish, _A Hertfordshire\r\nWitch; or the Story of Jane Wenham, the \"Wise Woman of Walkern_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Brit. Mus., Sloane MSS., 3,943, there is a continuation of the\r\npamphlet discussion, based chiefly, however, upon Glanvill and other\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10.--Criticism of the Northampton and Huntingdon Pamphlets of 1705 and\r\n1716 (see ch. XIII, note 10).\r\n\r\n_An Account of The Tryals, Examination and Condemnation of Elinor Shaw\r\nand Mary Phillips (Two notorious Witches) on Wednesday the 7th of March\r\n1705, for Bewitching a Woman, and two children.... With an Account of\r\ntheir strange Confessions._ This is signed, at the end, \"Ralph Davis,\r\nMarch 8, 1705.\" It was followed very shortly by a completer account,\r\nwritten after the execution, and entitled:\r\n\r\n_The Northamptonshire Witches, Being a true and faithful account of the\r\nBirths, Educations, Lives, and Conversations of Elinor Shaw and Mary\r\nPhillips (The two notorious Witches) That were Executed at Northampton\r\non Saturday, March the 17th, 1705 ... with their full Confession to the\r\nMinister, and last Dying Speeches at the place of Execution, the like\r\nnever before heard of.... Communicated in a Letter last Post, from Mr.\r\nRalph Davis of Northampton, to Mr. William Simons, Merchantt in London_,\r\nLondon, 1705.\r\n\r\nWith these two pamphlets we wish to compare another, which was\r\napparently published in 1716 and was entitled: _The Whole Trial and\r\nExamination of Mrs. Mary Hicks and her Daughter Elizabeth, But of Nine\r\nYears of Age, who were Condemn'd the last Assizes held at Huntingdon\r\nfor Witchcraft, and there Executed on Saturday, the 28th of July 1716\r\n... the like never heard before; their Behaviour with several Divines\r\nwho came to converse with 'em whilst under their sentence of Death; and\r\nlast Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of execution_, London,\r\n1716. There is a copy in the Bodleian Library.\r\n\r\nThe two Northamptonshire pamphlets and the Huntingdonshire pamphlet have\r\nbeen set by themselves because they appear to have been written by one\r\nhand. Moreover, it looks very much as if they were downright\r\nfabrications foisted upon the public by a man who had already in 1700\r\nmade to order an unhistorical pamphlet. To show this, it will be\r\nnecessary to review briefly the facts about the Worcester pamphlet\r\ndescribed above, § 4. What seems to be the second edition of a pamphlet\r\nentitled _The full Tryalls, Examinations and Condemnations of Four\r\nNotorious Witches, At the Assizes held at Worcester on Tuseday the 4th\r\nof March_, was published at London with the date 1700. It purports to\r\ntell the story of one of the cases that came up during Matthew Hopkins's\r\ncareer in 1645-1647. It has been universally accepted--even by Thomas\r\nWright, Ashton, W. H. D. Adams, and Inderwick. An examination shows,\r\nhowever, that it was made over from the Chelmsford pamphlet of 1645. The\r\nauthor shows little ingenuity, for he steals not only the confessions of\r\nfour witches at that trial, but their names as well. Rebecca West,\r\nMargaret Landis, Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread had all been hanged at\r\nChelmsford and could hardly have been rehanged at Worcester. Practically\r\nall that the writer of the Worcester pamphlet did was to touch over the\r\nconfessions and add thrilling details about their executions.\r\n\r\nNow, it looks very much as if the same writer had composed the\r\nNorthamptonshire pamphlets of 1705 and the Huntingdonshire pamphlets of\r\n1716. The verbal resemblances are nothing less than remarkable. The\r\nWorcester pamphlet, in its title, tells of \"their Confessions and Last\r\nDying Speeches at the place of execution.\" The second of the two\r\nNorthamptonshire pamphlets (the first was issued before the execution)\r\nspeaks of \"their full Confession to the Minister, and last Dying\r\nSpeeches at the place of Execution.\" The Huntingdonshire pamphlet closes\r\nthe title with \"last Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of\r\nExecution.\" The Worcester pamphlet uses the phrase \"with other amazing\r\nParticulars\"; the Northamptonshire pamphlet the phrase \"the particulars\r\nof their amazing Pranks.\" The Huntingdon pamphlet has in this case no\r\nsimilar phrase but the Huntingdon and Northamptonshire pamphlets have\r\nanother phrase in common. The Northamptonshire pamphlet says: \"the like\r\nnever before heard of\"; the Huntingdon pamphlet says: \"the like never\r\nheard before.\"\r\n\r\nThese resemblances are in the titles. The Northampton and the fabricated\r\nWorcester pamphlets show other similarities in their accounts. The\r\nNorthampton women were so \"hardened in their Wickedness that they\r\nPublickly boasted that their Master (meaning the Devil) would not suffer\r\nthem to be Executed but they found him a Lyer.\" The Worcester writer\r\nspeaks of the \"Devil who told them to the Last that he would secure them\r\nfrom Publick Punishment, but now too late they found him a Lyer as he\r\nwas from the beginning of the World.\" In concluding their narratives the\r\nNorthamptonshire and Worcestershire pamphleteers show an interesting\r\nsimilarity of treatment. The Northampton witches made a \"howling and\r\nlamentable noise\" on receiving their sentences, the Worcester women made\r\na \"yelling and howling at their executions.\"\r\n\r\nThese resemblances may be fairly characterized as striking. If it be\r\nasked whether the phrases quoted are not conventional in witch\r\npamphlets, the answer must be in the negative. So far as the writer\r\nknows, these phrases occur in no other of the fifty or more witch\r\npamphlets. The word \"notorious,\" which occurs in the titles of the\r\nWorcester and Northampton pamphlets, is a common one and would signify\r\nnothing. The other phrases mentioned are characteristic and distinctive.\r\nThis similarity suggests that the three pamphlets were written by the\r\nsame hand. Since we know that one of the three is a fabrication, we are\r\nled to suspect the credibility of the other two.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, other reasons for doubting the historicity of these\r\ntwo. A close scrutiny of the Northampton pamphlet shows that the\r\nwitchcrafts there described have the peculiar characteristics of the\r\nwitchcrafts in the palmy days of Matthew Hopkins and that the wording of\r\nthe descriptions is much the same. The Northampton pamphlet tells of a\r\n\"tall black man,\" who appeared to the two women. A tall black man had\r\nappeared to Rebecca West at Chelmsford in 1645. A much more important\r\npoint is that the prisoners at Northampton had been watched at night in\r\norder to keep their imps from coming in. This night-watching was a\r\nprocess that had never, so far as our records go, been used since the\r\nHopkins alarm, of which it had been the characteristic feature. Were\r\nthere no other resemblance between the Northampton cases and those at\r\nChelmsford, this similarity would alone lead us to suspect the\r\ncredibility of the Northampton pamphlet. Unfortunately the indiscreet\r\nwriter of the Northampton narrative lets other phrases belonging to 1645\r\ncreep into his account.\r\n\r\nWhen the Northampton women were watched, a \"little white thing about the\r\nbigness of a Cat\" had appeared. But a \"white thing about the bignesse of\r\na Cat\" had appeared to the watchers at Chelmsford in 1645. This is not\r\nall. The Northampton witches are said to have killed their victims by\r\nroasting and pricking images, a charge which had once been common, but\r\nwhich, so far as the writer can recall, had not been used since the\r\nSomerset cases of 1663. It was a charge very commonly used against the\r\nChelmsford witches whom Matthew Hopkins prosecuted. Moreover the\r\nNorthampton witches boasted that \"their Master would not suffer them to\r\nbe executed.\" No Chelmsford witch had made that boast; but Mr. Lowes,\r\nwho was executed at Bury St. Edmunds (the Bury trial was closely\r\nconnected with that at Chelmsford, so closely that the writer who had\r\nread of one would probably have read of the other), had declared that he\r\nhad a charm to keep him from the gallows.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these are close resemblances both in characteristic\r\nfeatures and in wording. But the most perfect resemblance is in a\r\nconfession. The two Northampton women describing their imps--creatures,\r\nby the way, that had figured largely in the Hopkins trials--said that\r\n\"if the Imps were not constantly imploy'd to do Mischief, they [the\r\nwitches] had not their healths; but when they were imploy'd they were\r\nvery Heathful and Well.\" This was almost exactly what Anne Leech had\r\nconfessed at Chelmsford. Her words were: \"And that when This Examinant\r\ndid not send and employ them abroad to do mischief, she had not her\r\nhealth, but when they were imploy'd, she was healthfull and well.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot point out the same similarity between the Huntingdonshire\r\nwitchcrafts of 1716 and the Chelmsford cases. The narrative of the\r\nHuntingdon case is, however, somewhat remarkable. Mr. Hicks was taking\r\nhis nine-year-old daughter to Ipswich one day, when she, seeing a sail\r\nat sea, took a \"basin of water,\" stirred it up, and thereby provoked a\r\nstorm that was like to have sunk the ship, had not the father made the\r\nchild cease. On the way home, the two passed a \"very fine Field of\r\nCorn.\" \"Quoth the child again, 'Father, I can consume all this Corn in\r\nthe twinkling of an Eye.' The Father supposing it not in her Power to do\r\nso, he bid to shew her infernal skill.\" The child did so, and presently\r\n\"all the Corn in the Field became Stubble.\" He questioned her and found\r\nthat she had learned witchcraft from her mother. The upshot of it was\r\nthat at Mr. Hicks's instance his wife and child were prosecuted and\r\nhanged. The story has been called remarkable. Yet it is not altogether\r\nunique. In 1645 at Bury St. Edmunds just after the Chelmsford trial\r\nthere were eighteen witches condemned, and one of them, it will be\r\nremembered, was Parson Lowes of Brandeston in Suffolk, who confessed\r\nthat \"he bewitched a ship near Harwidge; so that with the extreme\r\ntempestuous Seas raised by blusterous windes the said ship was cast\r\naway, wherein were many passengers, who were by this meanes swallowed up\r\nby the merciless waves.\" It will be observed that the two stories are\r\nnot altogether similar. The Huntingdon narrative is a better tale, and\r\nit would be hardly safe to assert that it drew its inspiration from the\r\nearlier story. Yet, when it is remembered how unusual is the story in\r\nEnglish witch-lore, the supposition gains in probability. There is a\r\nfurther resemblance in the accounts. The Hicks child had bewitched a\r\nfield of corn. One of the Bury witches, in the narrative which tells of\r\nparson Lowes, \"confessed that She usually bewitcht standing corne,\r\nwhereby there came great loss to the owners thereof.\" The resemblance is\r\nhardly close enough to merit notice in itself. When taken, however, in\r\nconnection with the other resemblances it gives cumulative force to the\r\nsupposition that the writer of the Huntingdon pamphlet had gone to the\r\nnarratives of the Hopkins cases for his sources.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other reasons for doubting the Huntingdon story. A\r\nwriter in _Notes and Queries_, 2d series, V, 503-504, long ago\r\nquestioned the narrative because of the mention of a \"Judge Wilmot,\" and\r\nshowed that there was no such judge on the bench before 1755. An\r\nexamination of the original pamphlet makes it clear, however, that in\r\nthis form the objection is worth nothing. The tract speaks only of a\r\n\"_Justice_ Wilmot,\" who, from the wording of the narrative, would seem\r\nto have conducted the examination preliminary to the assizes as a\r\njustice of the peace would. A justice of the peace would doubtless,\r\nhowever, have belonged to some Huntingdonshire county family. Now, the\r\nwriter has searched the various records and histories of\r\nHuntingdonshire--unfortunately they are but too few--and among the\r\nseveral hundred Huntingdonshire names he has found no Wilmots (and, for\r\nthat matter, no Hickes either). This would seem to make the story more\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier number of _Notes and Queries_ (1st series, V, 514), James\r\nCrossley, whose authority as to matters relating to witchcraft is of the\r\nhighest, gives cogent reasons why the Huntingdonshire narrative could\r\nnot be true. He recalls the fact that Hutchinson, who made a\r\nchronological table of cases, published his work in 1718. Now Hutchinson\r\nhad the help of two chief-justices, Parker and King, and of Chief-Baron\r\nBury in collecting his cases; and yet he says that the last execution\r\nfor the crime in England was in 1682. Crossley makes the further strong\r\npoint that the case of Jane Wenham in 1712 attracted wide attention and\r\nwas the occasion of numerous pamphlets. \"It is scarcely possible,\" he\r\ncontinues, \"that in four years after two persons, one only nine years\r\nold, ... should have been tried and executed for witchcraft without\r\npublic attention being called to the circumstance.\" He adds that\r\nneither the _Historical Register_ for 1716 nor the files of two London\r\nnewspapers for that year, though they enumerate other convictions on the\r\ncircuit, record the supposed cases.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that exactly the same arguments apply to the Northampton\r\ntrials of 1705. Hutchinson had been at extraordinary pains to find out\r\nnot only about Jane Wenham, but about the Moordike case of 1702. It is\r\ninconceivable that he should have quite overlooked the execution of two\r\nwomen at Northampton.\r\n\r\nWe have observed that the Northampton, Huntingdon, and Worcester\r\npamphlets have curious resemblances in wording to one another\r\n(resemblances that point to a common authorship), that the Worcester\r\nnarrative can be proved to be fictitious, and that the Huntingdon\r\nnarrative almost certainly belongs in the same category. We have shown,\r\nfurther, that the Northampton and Huntingdon stories present features of\r\nwitchcraft characteristic of the Chelmsford and Bury cases of 1645, from\r\nthe first of which the material of the Worcester pamphlet is drawn; and\r\nthis fact points not only to the common authorship of the three tracts,\r\nbut to the imaginary character of the Huntingdon and Northampton cases.\r\n\r\nAgainst these facts there is to be presented what at first blush seems a\r\nvery important piece of evidence. In the _Northamptonshire Historical\r\nCollections_, 1st series (Northampton, 1896), there is a chapter on\r\nwitchcraft in Northamptonshire, copied from the _Northamptonshire\r\nHandbook_ for 1867. That chapter goes into the trials of 1705 in detail,\r\nmaking copious extracts from the pamphlets. In a footnote the writers\r\nsay: \"To show that the burning actually took place in 1705, it may be\r\nimportant to mention that there is an item of expense entered in the\r\noverseers' accounts for St. Giles parish for faggots bought for the\r\npurpose.\" This in itself seems convincing. It seems to dispose of the\r\nwhole question at once. There is, however, one fact that instantly casts\r\na doubt upon this seemingly conclusive evidence. In England, witches\r\nwere hanged, not burned. There are not a half-dozen recorded exceptions\r\nto this rule. Mother Lakeland in 1645 was burned. That is easy to\r\nexplain. Mother Lakeland had by witchcraft killed her husband. Burning\r\nwas the method of execution prescribed by English law for a woman who\r\nkilled her husband. The other cases where burnings are said to have\r\ntaken place were almost certainly cases that came under this rule. But\r\nit does not seem possible that the Northampton cases came under the\r\nrule. The two women seem to have had no husbands. \"Ralph Davis,\" the\r\nostensible writer of the account, who professed to have known them from\r\ntheir early years, and who was apparently glad to defame them in every\r\npossible way, accused them of loose living, but not of adultery, as he\r\nwould certainly have done, had he conceived of them as married. It is\r\nhard to avoid the conclusion that they could not have been burned.\r\n\r\nThere is a more decisive answer to this argument for the authenticity of\r\nthe pamphlet. The supposed confirmation of it in the St. Giles parish\r\nregister is probably a blunder. The Reverend R. M. Serjeantson of St.\r\nPeter's Rectory has been kind enough to examine for the writer the\r\nparish register of St. Giles Church. He writes: \"The St. Giles accounts\r\nbriefly state that _wood_ was bought from time to time--probably for\r\nmelting the lead. There is _no_ mention of _faggots_ nor witches in the\r\nChurch wardens' overseers-for-the-poor accounts. I carefully turned out\r\nthe whole contents of the parish chest.\" Mr. Serjeantson adds at the\r\nclose this extract: \"1705 P'd for wood 5/ For taking up the old lead\r\n5/.\" It goes without saying that Mr. Serjeantson's examination does not\r\nprove that there never was a mention of the faggots bought for burning\r\nwitches; but, when all the other evidence is taken into consideration,\r\nthis negative evidence does establish a very strong presumption to that\r\neffect. Certainly the supposed passage from the overseers' accounts can\r\nno longer be used to confirm the testimony of the pamphlet. It looks\r\nvery much as if the compilers of the _Northamptonshire Handbook_ for\r\n1867 had been careless in their handling of records.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, then, that the pamphlet of 1705 dealing with the\r\nexecution of Mary Phillips and Elinor Shaw is a purely fictitious\r\nnarrative. The matter derives its importance from the fact that, if the\r\ntwo executions in 1705 be disproved, the last known execution in England\r\nis put back to 1682, ten years before the Salem affair in Massachusetts.\r\nThis would of course have some bearing on a recent contention (G. L.\r\nKittredge, \"Notes on Witchcraft,\" Am. Antiq. Soc., _Proc._, XVIII), that\r\n\"convictions and executions for witchcraft occurred in England after\r\nthey had come to an end in Massachusetts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.--LIST OF PERSONS SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR WITCHCRAFT DURING THE REIGN\r\nOF JAMES I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Charged with Causing Death.\r\n\r\n 1603.

They have made\r\npossible this study. My debt is especially great to the libraries of the\r\nBritish Museum and of Lambeth Palace at London, to the Bodleian Library\r\nat Oxford, and in America to the Boston Athenæum and to the university\r\nlibraries of Yale and Harvard. To the unrivalled White collection at\r\nCornell my obligation is deepest of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The references in this list, together with the account, in appendix\r\nA, of the pamphlet literature of witchcraft, are designed to take the\r\nplace of a formal bibliography. That the list of cases here given is\r\ncomplete can hardly be hoped. Crude though its materials compel it to\r\nbe, the author believes it may prove useful.
