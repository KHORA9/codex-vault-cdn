Susan B. Anthony followed this\r\ntradition. Convinced that the principle of equal rights for all, as\r\nstated in the Declaration of Independence, must be expressed in the\r\nlaws of a true republic, she devoted her life to the establishment of\r\nthis ideal.\r\n\r\nBecause she recognized in Negro slavery and in the legal bondage of\r\nwomen flagrant violations of this principle, she became an active,\r\ncourageous, effective antislavery crusader and a champion of civil and\r\npolitical rights for women. She saw women's struggle for freedom from\r\nlegal restrictions as an important phase in the development of\r\nAmerican democracy. To her this struggle was never a battle of the\r\nsexes, but a battle such as any freedom-loving people would wage for\r\ncivil and political rights.\r\n\r\nWhile her goals for women were only partially realized in her\r\nlifetime, she prepared the soil for the acceptance not only of her\r\nlong-hoped-for federal woman suffrage amendment but for a worldwide\r\nrecognition of human rights, now expressed in the United Nations\r\nCharter and the Declaration of Human Rights. She looked forward to the\r\ntime when throughout the world there would be no discrimination\r\nbecause of race, color, religion, or sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The letters of a person ...,\" said Thomas Jefferson, \"form the only\r\nfull and genuine journal of his life.\" Susan B. Anthony's letters,\r\nhundreds of them, preserved in libraries and private collections, and\r\nher diaries have been the basis of this biography, and I acknowledge\r\nmy indebtedness to the following libraries and their helpful\r\nlibrarians: the American Antiquarian Society; the Bancroft Library of\r\nthe University of California; the Boston Public Library; the Henry E.\r\nHuntington Library and Art Gallery; the Indiana State Library; the\r\nKansas Historical Society; the Library of Congress; the Susan B.\r\nAnthony Memorial Collection of the Los Angeles Public Library, which\r\nhas been transferred to the Henry E. Huntington Library; the New York\r\nPublic Library; the New York State Library; the Ohio State Library;\r\nthe Radcliffe Women's Archives; the Seneca Falls Historical Society;\r\nthe Smith College Library; the Susan B. Anthony Memorial Inc.,\r\nRochester, New York; the University of Rochester Library; the\r\nUniversity of Kentucky Library; and the Vassar College Library.\r\n\r\nI am particularly indebted to Lucy E. Anthony, who asked me to write a\r\nbiography of her aunt, lent me her aunt's diaries, and was most\r\ngenerous with her records and personal recollections. To her and to\r\nher sister, Mrs. Ann Anthony Bacon, I am very grateful for photographs\r\nand for permission to quote from Susan B. Anthony's diaries and from\r\nher letters and manuscripts.\r\n\r\nIda Husted Harper's _Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony_, written in\r\ncollaboration with Susan B.

As\r\nmany of the letters and documents used in the preparation of these\r\nbooks were destroyed, they have preserved an important record of the\r\nwork of Susan B. Anthony and of the woman's rights movement.\r\n\r\nI am especially grateful to Martha Taylor Howard for her unfailing\r\ninterest and for the use of the valuable Susan B. Anthony Memorial\r\nCollection which she initiated and developed in Rochester, New York;\r\nand to Una R. Winter for her interest and for the use of her Susan B.\r\nAnthony Collection, most of which is now in the Henry E. Huntington\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nI thank Edna M.

To\r\nenter the mill, to stand quietly and look about, was the best kind of\r\nentertainment, for she was fascinated by the whir of the looms, by the\r\nnimble fingers of the weavers, and by the general air of efficiency.\r\nAdmiringly she watched Sally Ann Hyatt, the tall capable weaver from\r\nVermont. When the yarn on the beam was tangled or there was something\r\nwrong with the machinery, Elijah, the overseer, always called out to\r\nSally Ann, \"I'll tend your loom, if you'll look after this.\" Sally Ann\r\nnever failed to locate the trouble or to untangle the yarn. Yet she\r\nwas never made overseer, and this continued to puzzle Susan.[1]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of cotton was a new industry, developing with great\r\npromise in the United States, when Susan B. Anthony was born on\r\nFebruary 15, 1820, in the wide valley at the foot of Mt. Greylock,\r\nnear Adams, Massachusetts. Enterprising young men like her father,\r\nDaniel Anthony, saw a potential cotton mill by the side of every\r\nrushing brook, and young women, eager to earn the first money they\r\ncould call their own, were leaving the farms, for a few months at\r\nleast, to work in the mills. Cotton cloth was the new sensation and\r\nthe demand for it was steadily growing. Brides were proud to display a\r\nfew cotton sheets instead of commonplace homespun linen.\r\n\r\nWhen Susan was two years old, her father built a cotton factory of\r\ntwenty-six looms beside the brook which ran through Grandfather Read's\r\nmeadow, hauling the cotton forty miles by wagon from Troy, New York.\r\nThe millworkers, most of them young girls from Vermont, boarded, as\r\nwas the custom, in the home of the millowner; Susan's mother, Lucy\r\nRead Anthony, although she had three small daughters to care for,\r\nGuelma, Susan, and Hannah, boarded eleven of the millworkers with\r\nonly the help of a thirteen-year-old girl who worked for her after\r\nschool hours. Lucy Anthony cooked their meals on the hearth of the big\r\nkitchen fireplace, and in the large brick oven beside it baked crisp\r\nbrown loaves of bread. In addition, washing, ironing, mending, and\r\nspinning filled her days. But she was capable and strong and was doing\r\nonly what all women in this new country were expected to do. She\r\ntaught her young daughters to help her, and Susan, even before she was\r\nsix, was very useful; by the time she was ten she could cook a good\r\nmeal and pack a dinner pail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Daniel Anthony, father of Susan B. Anthony]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHard work and skill were respected as Susan grew up in the rapidly\r\nexpanding young republic which less than fifty years before had been\r\nfounded and fought for. Settlers, steadily pushing westward, had built\r\nnew states out of the wilderness, adding ten to the original thirteen.\r\nEverywhere the leaven of democracy was working and men were putting\r\ninto practice many of the principles so boldly stated in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, claiming for themselves equal rights and\r\nopportunities. The new states entered the Union with none of the\r\ntraditional property and religious limitations on the franchise, but\r\nwith manhood suffrage and all voters eligible for office. The older\r\nstates soon fell into line, Massachusetts in 1820 removing property\r\nqualifications for voters. Before long, throughout the United States,\r\nall free white men were enfranchised, leaving only women, Negroes, and\r\nIndians without the full rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lucy Read Anthony, mother of Susan B. Anthony]\r\n\r\nAlthough women freeholders had voted in some of the colonies and in\r\nNew Jersey as late as 1807,[2] just as in England in the fifteenth\r\nfranchise had gradually found its way into the statutes, and women's\r\nrights as citizens were ignored, in spite of the contribution they had\r\nmade to the defense and development of the new nation. However,\r\nEuropean travelers, among them De Tocqueville, recognized that the\r\nsurvival of the New World experiment in government and the prosperity\r\nand strength of the people were due in large measure to the\r\nsuperiority of American women. A few women had urged their claims:\r\nAbigail Adams asked her husband, a member of the Continental Congress,\r\n\"to remember the ladies\" in the \"new code of laws\"; and Hannah Lee\r\nCorbin of Virginia pleaded with her brother, Richard Henry Lee, to\r\nmake good the principle of \"no taxation without representation\" by\r\nenfranchising widows with property.[3]\r\n\r\nYet the legal bondage of women continued to be overlooked. It seemed a\r\nless obvious threat to free institutions and democratic government\r\nthan the Negro in slavery. In fact, Negro slavery presented a problem\r\nwhich demanded attention again and again, flaring up alarmingly in\r\n1820, the year Susan B. Anthony was born, when Missouri was admitted\r\nto the Union as a slave state.[4]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese were some of the forces at work in the minds of Americans during\r\nSusan's childhood. Her father, a liberal Quaker, was concerned over\r\nthe extension of slavery, and she often heard him say that he tried to\r\navoid purchasing cotton raised by slave labor. This early impression\r\nof the evil of slavery was never erased.\r\n\r\nThe Quakers' respect for women's equality with men before God also\r\nleft its mark on young Susan. As soon as she was old enough she went\r\nregularly to Meeting with her father, for all of the Anthonys were\r\nQuakers. They had migrated to western Massachusetts from Rhode Island,\r\nand there on the frontier had built prosperous farms, comfortable\r\nhomes, and a meeting house where they could worship God in their own\r\nway. Susan, sitting with the women and children on the hand-hewn\r\nbenches near the big fireplace in the meeting house[5] which her\r\nancestors had built, found peace and consecration in the simple\r\nunordered service, in the long reverent silence broken by both the men\r\nand the women in the congregation as they were led to say a prayer or\r\ngive out a helpful message. Forty families now worshiped here, the\r\nwomen sitting on one side and the men on the other; but women took\r\ntheir places with men in positions of honor, Susan's own grandmother,\r\nHannah Latham Anthony, an elder, sitting in the \"high seat,\" and her\r\naunt, Hannah Anthony Hoxie, preaching as the spirit moved her. With\r\nthis valuation of women accepted as a matter of course in her church\r\nand family circle, Susan took it for granted that it existed\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAlthough her father was a devout Friend, she discovered that he had\r\nthe reputation of thinking for himself, following the \"inner light\"\r\neven when its leading differed from the considered judgment of his\r\nfellow Quakers. For this he became a hero to her, especially after she\r\nheard the romantic story of his marriage to Lucy Read who was not a\r\nQuaker. The Anthonys and the Reads had been neighbors for years, and\r\nLucy was one of the pupils at the \"home school\" which Grandfather\r\nHumphrey Anthony had built for his children on the farm, under the\r\nweeping willow at the front gate. Daniel and Lucy were schoolmates\r\nuntil Daniel at nineteen was sent to Richard Mott's Friends' boarding\r\nschool at Nine Partners on the Hudson. When he returned as a teacher,\r\nhe found his old playmate still one of the pupils, but now a beautiful\r\ntall young woman with deep blue eyes and glossy brown hair. Full of\r\nfun, a good dancer, and always dressed in the prettiest clothes, she\r\nwas the most popular girl in the neighborhood. Promptly Daniel Anthony\r\nfell in love with her, but an almost insurmountable obstacle stood in\r\nthe way: Quakers were not permitted to \"marry out of Meeting.\" This,\r\nhowever, did not deter Daniel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony Homestead, Adams, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nIt was harder for Lucy to make up her mind. She enjoyed parties,\r\ndances, and music. She had a full rich voice, and as she sat at her\r\nspinning wheel, singing and spinning, she often wished that she could\r\n\"go into a ten acre lot with the bars down\"[6] and let her voice out.\r\nIf she married Daniel, she would have to give all this up, but she\r\ndecided in favor of Daniel. A few nights before the wedding, she went\r\nto her last party and danced until four in the morning while Daniel\r\nlooked on and patiently waited until she was ready to leave.\r\n\r\nFor his transgression of marrying out of Meeting, Daniel had to face\r\nthe elders as soon as he returned from his wedding trip. They weighed\r\nthe matter carefully, found him otherwise sincere and earnest, and\r\ndecided not to turn him out. Lucy gave up her dancing and her singing.\r\nShe gave up her pretty bright-colored dresses for plain somber\r\nclothes, but she did not adopt the Quaker dress or use the \"plain\r\nspeech.\" She went to meeting with Daniel but never became a Quaker,\r\nfeeling always that she could not live up to their strict standard of\r\nrighteousness.[7]\r\n\r\nThis was Susan's heritage--Quaker discipline and austerity lightened\r\nby her father's independent spirit and by the kindly understanding of\r\nher mother who had not forgotten her own fun-loving girlhood; an\r\nenvironment where men and women were partners in church and at home,\r\nwhere hard physical work was respected, where help for the needy and\r\nunfortunate was spontaneous, and where education was regarded as so\r\nimportant that Grandfather Anthony built a school for his children and\r\nthe neighbors' in his front yard. Her childhood was close enough to\r\nthe Revolution to make Grandfather Read's part in it very real and a\r\nsource of great pride. Eagerly and often she listened to the story of\r\nhow he enlisted in the Continental army as soon as the news of the\r\nBattle of Lexington reached Cheshire and served with outstanding\r\nbravery under Arnold at Quebec, Ethan Allen at Ticonderoga, and\r\nColonel Stafford at Bennington while his young wife waited anxiously\r\nfor him throughout the long years of the war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wide valley in the Berkshire Hills where Susan grew up made a\r\nlasting impression on her. There was beauty all about her--the fruit\r\ntrees blooming in the spring, the meadows white with daisies, the\r\nbrook splashing over the rocks and sparkling in the summer sun, the\r\nflaming colors of autumn, the strength and companionship of the hills\r\nwhen the countryside was white with snow. She seldom failed to watch\r\nthe sun set behind Greylock.\r\n\r\nHer father's cotton mill flourished. Regarded as one of the most\r\npromising, successful young men of the district, he soon attracted the\r\nattention of Judge John McLean, a cotton manufacturer of Battenville,\r\nNew York, who, eager to enlarge his mills, saw in Daniel Anthony an\r\nable manager. Daniel, always ready to take the next step ahead,\r\naccepted McLean's offer, and on a sunny July day in 1826, Susan drove\r\nwith her family through the hills forty-four miles to the new world of\r\nBattenville.\r\n\r\nHere in the home of Judge McLean, she saw Negroes for the first time,\r\nNegroes working to earn their freedom. Startled by their black faces,\r\nshe was a little afraid, but when her father explained that in the\r\nSouth they could be sold like cattle and torn from their families, her\r\nfear turned to pity.\r\n\r\nAt the district school, taught by a woman in summer and by a man in\r\nthe winter, she learned to sew, spell, read, and write, and she wanted\r\nto study long division but the schoolmaster, unable to teach it, saw\r\nno reason why a woman should care for such knowledge. Her father, then\r\nrealizing the need of better education for his five children, Guelma,\r\nSusan, Hannah, Daniel, and Mary, established a school for them in the\r\nnew brick building where he had opened a store. Later on when their\r\nnew brick house was finished, he set aside a large room for the\r\nschool, and here for the first time in that district the pupils had\r\nseparate seats, stools without backs, instead of the usual benches\r\naround the schoolroom walls. He engaged as teachers young women who\r\nhad studied a year or two in a female seminary; and because female\r\nseminaries were rare in those days, women teachers with up-to-date\r\ntraining were hard to find. Only a few visionaries believed in the\r\neducation of women. Nearby Emma Willard's recently established Troy\r\nFemale Seminary was being watched with interest and suspicion. Mary\r\nLyon, who had not yet founded her own seminary at Mt. Holyoke, was\r\nteaching at Zilpha Grant's school in Ipswich, Massachusetts, and one\r\nof her pupils, Mary Perkins, came to Battenville to teach the Anthony\r\nchildren. Mary Perkins brought new methods and new studies to the\r\nlittle school. She introduced a primer with small black illustrations\r\nwhich fascinated Susan. She taught the children to recite poetry,\r\ndrilled them regularly in calisthenics, and longed to add music as\r\nwell, but Daniel Anthony forbade this, for Quakers believed that music\r\nmight seduce the thoughts of the young. So Susan, although she often\r\nhad a song in her heart, had to repress it and never knew the joy of\r\nsinging the songs of childhood.\r\n\r\nHer father, looking upon the millworkers as part of his family,\r\nstarted an evening school for them, often teaching it himself or\r\ncalling in the family teacher. He organized a temperance society among\r\nthe workers, and all signed a pledge never to drink distilled liquor.\r\nWhen he opened a store in the new brick building, he refused to sell\r\nliquor, although Judge McLean warned him it would ruin his trade.\r\nDaniel Anthony went even further. He resolved not to serve liquor when\r\nthe millworkers' houses were built and the neighbors came to the\r\n\"raising.\" Again Judge McLean protested, feeling certain that the men\r\nand boys would demand their gin and their rum, but Susan and her\r\nsisters helped their mother serve lemonade, tea, coffee, doughnuts,\r\nand gingerbread in abundance. The men joked a bit about the lack of\r\nstrong drink which they expected with every meal, but they did not\r\nturn away from the good substitutes which were offered and they were\r\non hand for the next \"raising.\" Hearing all of this discussed at home,\r\nSusan, again proud of her father, ardently advocated the cause of\r\ntemperance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mill was still of great interest to her and she watched every\r\noperation closely in her spare time, longing to try her hand at the\r\nwork. One day when a \"spooler\" was ill, Susan and her sister Hannah\r\neagerly volunteered to take her place. Their father was ready to let\r\nthem try, pleased by their interest and curious to see what they could\r\ndo, but their mother protested that the mill was no place for\r\nchildren. Finally Susan's earnest pleading won her mother's reluctant\r\nconsent, and the two girls drew lots for the job. It went to\r\ntwelve-year-old Susan on the condition that she divide her earnings\r\nwith Hannah. Every day for two weeks she went early to the mill in her\r\nplain homespun dress, her straight hair neatly parted and smoothed\r\nover her ears. Proudly she tended the spools. She was skillful and\r\nquick, and received the regular wage of $1.50 a week, which she\r\ndivided with Hannah, buying with her share six pale blue coffee cups\r\nfor her mother who had allowed her this satisfying adventure.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before her thirteenth birthday, Susan became a member of\r\nthe Society of Friends which met in nearby Easton, New York, and\r\nlearned to search her heart and ask herself, \"Art thou faithful?\"\r\nParties, dancing, and entertainments were generally ruled out of her\r\nlife as sinful, and rarely were a temptation, but occasionally her\r\nmother, remembering her own good times, let her and her sisters go to\r\nparties at the homes of their Presbyterian neighbors, and for this her\r\nfather was criticized at Friends' Meeting. Condemning bright colors,\r\nfrills, and jewelry as vain and worldly, Susan accepted plain somber\r\nclothing as a mark of righteousness, and when she deviated to the\r\nextent of wearing the Scotch-plaid coat which her mother had bought\r\nher, she wondered if the big rent torn in it by a dog might not be\r\ndeserved punishment for her pride in wearing it.\r\n\r\nThat same year, the family moved into their new brick house of fifteen\r\nrooms, with hard-finish plaster walls and light green woodwork, the\r\nfinest house in that part of the country. Here Susan's brother Merritt\r\nwas born the next April, and her two-year-old sister, Eliza, died.\r\n\r\nSusan, Guelma, and Hannah continued their studies longer than most\r\ngirls in the neighborhood, for Quakers not only encouraged but\r\ndemanded education for both boys and girls. As soon as Susan and her\r\nsister Guelma were old enough, they taught the \"home\" school in the\r\nsummer when the younger children attended, and then went further\r\nafield to teach in nearby villages. At fifteen Susan was teaching a\r\ndistrict school for $1.50 a week and board, and although it was hard\r\nfor her to be away from home, she accepted it as a Friend's duty to\r\nprovide good education for children. Now Presbyterian neighbors\r\ncriticized her father, protesting that well-to-do young ladies should\r\nnot venture into paid work.\r\n\r\nDaniel Anthony was now a wealthy man, his factory the largest and most\r\nprosperous in that part of the country, and he could afford more and\r\nbetter education for his daughters. He sent Guelma, the eldest, to\r\nDeborah Moulson's Friends' Seminary near Philadelphia, where for $125\r\na year \"the inculcation of the principles of Humility, Morality, and\r\nVirtue\" received particular attention; and when Guelma was asked to\r\nstay on a second year as a teacher, he suggested that Susan join her\r\nthere as a pupil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a long journey from Battenville to Philadelphia in 1837, and\r\nwhen Susan left her home on a snowy afternoon with her father, she\r\nfelt as if the parting would be forever. Her first glimpse of the\r\nworld beyond Battenville interested her immensely until her father\r\nleft her at the seminary, and then she confessed to her diary, \"Oh\r\nwhat pangs were felt. It seemed impossible for me to part with him. I\r\ncould not speak to bid him farewell.\"[8] She tried to comfort herself\r\nby writing letters, and wrote so many and so much that Guelma often\r\nexclaimed, \"Susan, thee writes too much; thee should learn to be\r\nconcise.\" As it was a rule of the seminary that each letter must first\r\nbe written out carefully on a slate, inspected by Deborah Moulson,\r\nthen copied with care, inspected again, and finally sent out after\r\nfour or five days of preparation, all spontaneity was stifled and her\r\nletters were stilted and overvirtuous. This censorship left its mark,\r\nand years later she confessed, \"Whenever I take my pen in hand, I\r\nalways seem to be mounted on stilts.\"[9]\r\n\r\nTo her diary she could confide her real feelings--her discouragement\r\nover her lack of improvement and her inability to understand her many\r\n\"sins,\" such as not dotting an _i_, too much laughter, or smiling at\r\nher friends instead of reproving them for frivolous conduct. She\r\nwrote, \"Thought so much of my resolutions to do better in the future\r\nthat even my dreams were filled with these desires.... Although I have\r\nbeen guilty of much levity and nonsensical conversation, and have also\r\nadmitted thoughts to occupy my mind which should have been far distant\r\nfrom it, I do not consider myself as having committed any wilful\r\noffense but perhaps the reason I cannot see my own defects is because\r\nmy heart is hardened.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe girls studied a variety of subjects, arithmetic, algebra,\r\nliterature, chemistry, philosophy, physiology, astronomy, and\r\nbookkeeping. Men came to the school to conduct some of the classes,\r\nand Deborah Moulson was also assisted by several student teachers, one\r\nof whom, Lydia Mott, became Susan's lifelong friend. Susan worked\r\nhard, for she was a conscientious child, but none of her efforts\r\nseemed to satisfy Deborah Moulson, who was a hard taskmaster. Her\r\nreproofs cut deep, and once when Susan protested that she was always\r\ncensured while Guelma was praised, Deborah Moulson sternly replied,\r\n\"Thy sister Guelma does the best she is capable of, but thou dost not.\r\nThou hast greater abilities and I demand of thee the best of thy\r\ncapacity.\"[11]\r\n\r\nMail from home was a bright spot, bringing into those busy austere\r\ndays news of her friends, and when she read that one of them had\r\nmarried an old widower with six children, she reflected sagely, \"I\r\nshould think any female would rather live and die an old maid.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThen came word that her father's business had been so affected by the\r\nfinancial depression that the family would have to give up their home\r\nin Battenville. Sorrowfully she wrote in her diary, \"O can I ever\r\nforget that loved residence in Battenville, and no more to call it\r\nhome seems impossible.\"[13] It helped little to realize that countless\r\nother families throughout the country were facing the future penniless\r\nbecause banks had failed, mills were shut down, and work on canals and\r\nrailroads had ceased. In April 1838, Daniel Anthony came to the\r\nseminary to take his daughters home.\r\n\r\nSusan felt keenly her father's sorrow over the failure of his business\r\nand the loss of the home he had built for his family, and she resolved\r\nat once to help out by teaching in Union Village, New York. In May\r\n1838, she wrote in her diary, \"On last evening ... I again left my\r\nhome to mingle with strangers which seems to be my sad lot. Separation\r\nwas rendered more trying on account of the embarrassing condition of\r\nour business affairs, an inventory was expected to be taken today of\r\nour furniture by assignees.... Spent this day in school, found it\r\nsmall and quite disorderly. O, may my patience hold out to persevere\r\nwithout intermission.\"[14]\r\n\r\nHer patience did hold out, and also her courage, as the news came from\r\nhome telling her how everything had to be sold to satisfy the\r\ncreditors, the furniture, her mother's silver spoons, their clothing\r\nand books, the flour, tea, coffee, and sugar in the pantries. She\r\nrejoiced to hear that Uncle Joshua Read from Palatine Bridge, New\r\nYork, had come to the rescue, had bought their most treasured and\r\nneeded possessions and turned them over to her mother.\r\n\r\nOn a cold blustery March day in 1839, when she was nineteen, Susan\r\nmoved with her family two miles down the Battenkill to the little\r\nsettlement of Hardscrabble, later called Center Falls, where her\r\nfather owned a satinet factory and grist mill, built in more\r\nprosperous times. These were now heavily mortgaged but he hoped to\r\nsave them. They moved into a large house which had been a tavern in\r\nthe days when lumber had been cut around Hardscrabble. It was\r\ndisappointing after their fine brick house in Battenville, but they\r\nmade it comfortable, and their love for and loyalty to each other made\r\nthem a happy family anywhere. As it had been a halfway house on the\r\nroad to Troy and travelers continued to stop there asking for a meal\r\nor a night's lodging, they took them in, and young Daniel served them\r\nfood and nonintoxicating drinks at the old tavern bar.\r\n\r\nSusan, when her school term was over, put her energies into housework,\r\nrecording in her diary, \"Did a large washing today.... Spent today at\r\nthe spinning wheel.... Baked 21 loaves of bread.... Wove three yards\r\nof carpet yesterday.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe attic of the tavern had been finished off for a ballroom with\r\nbottles laid under the floor to give a nice tone to the music of the\r\nfiddles, and now the young people of the village wanted to hold their\r\ndancing school there. Susan's father, true to his Quaker training,\r\nfelt obliged to refuse, but when they came the second time to tell him\r\nthat the only other place available was a disreputable tavern where\r\nliquor was sold, he relented a little, and talked the matter over with\r\nhis wife and daughters. Lucy Anthony, recalling her love of dancing,\r\nurged him to let the young people come. Finally he consented on the\r\ncondition that Guelma, Hannah, and Susan would not dance. They agreed.\r\nEvery two weeks all through the winter, the fiddles played in the\r\nattic room and the boys and girls of the neighborhood danced the\r\nVirginia reel and their rounds and squares, while the three Quaker\r\ngirls sat around the wall, watching and longing to join in the fun.\r\n\r\nSuch frivolous entertainment in the home of a Quaker could not be\r\ncondoned, and Daniel Anthony was not only severely censured by the\r\nFriends but read out of Meeting, \"because he kept a place of amusement\r\nin his house.\" But he did not regret his so-called sin any more than\r\nhe regretted marrying out of Meeting. He continued to attend Friends'\r\nMeeting, but grew more and more liberal as the years went by. At this\r\ntime, like all Quakers, he refused to vote, not wishing in any way to\r\nsupport a government that believed in war, and this influenced Susan\r\nwho for some years regarded voting as unimportant. He refused to pay\r\ntaxes for the same reason, and she often saw him put his pocketbook on\r\nthe table and then remark drily to the tax collector, \"I shall not\r\nvoluntarily pay these taxes. If thee wants to rifle my pocketbook,\r\nthee can do so.\"[16]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo help her father with his burden of debt was now Susan's purpose in\r\nlife, and in the spring she again left the family circle to teach at\r\nEunice Kenyon's Friends' Seminary in New Rochelle, New York. There\r\nwere twenty-eight day pupils and a few boarders at the seminary, and\r\nfor long periods while Eunice Kenyon was ill, Susan took full charge.\r\n\r\nShe wrote her family all the little details of her life, but their\r\nletters never came often enough to satisfy her. Occasionally she\r\nreceived a paper or a letter from Aaron McLean, Judge McLean's\r\ngrandson, who had been her good friend and Guelma's ever since they\r\nhad moved to Battenville. His letters almost always started an\r\nargument which both of them continued with zest. After hearing the\r\nQuaker preacher, Rachel Barker, she wrote him, \"I guess if you would\r\nhear her you would believe in a woman's preaching. What an absurd\r\nnotion that women have not intellectual and moral faculties sufficient\r\nfor anything but domestic concerns.\"[17]\r\n\r\nWhen New Rochelle welcomed President Van Buren with a parade, bands\r\nplaying, and crowds in the streets, this prim self-righteous young\r\nwoman took no part in this hero worship, but gave vent to her\r\ndisapproval in a letter to Aaron.\r\n\r\nDisturbed over the treatment Negroes received at Friends' Meeting in\r\nNew Rochelle, she impulsively wrote him, \"The people about here are\r\nanti-abolitionist and anti everything else that's good. The Friends\r\nraised quite a fuss about a colored man sitting in the meeting house,\r\nand some left on account of it.... What a lack of Christianity is\r\nthis!\"[18]\r\n\r\nHer school term of fifteen weeks, for which she was paid $30, was over\r\nearly in September, just in time for her to be at home for Guelma's\r\nwedding to Aaron McLean, and afterward she stayed on to teach the\r\nvillage school in Center Falls. This made it possible for her to join\r\nin the social life of the neighborhood. Often the young people drove\r\nto nearby villages, twenty buggies in procession. On a drive to\r\nSaratoga, her escort asked her to give up teaching to marry him. She\r\nrefused, as she did again a few years later when a Quaker elder tried\r\nto entice her with his fine house, his many acres, and his sixty cows.\r\nAlthough she had reached the age of twenty, when most girls felt they\r\nshould be married, she was still particular, and when a friend married\r\na man far inferior mentally, she wrote in her diary, \"'Tis strange,\r\n'tis passing strange that a girl possessed of common sense should be\r\nwilling to marry a lunatic--but so it is.\"[19]\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years, both she and Hannah taught school almost\r\ncontinuously, for $2 to $2.50 a week. Time and time again Susan\r\nreplaced a man who had been discharged for inefficiency. Although she\r\nmade a success of the school, she discovered that she was paid only a\r\nfourth the salary he had received, and this rankled.\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere except among Quakers, she encountered a false\r\nestimate of women which she instinctively opposed. After spending\r\nseveral months with relatives in Vermont, where she had the unexpected\r\nopportunity of studying algebra, she stopped over for a visit with\r\nGuelma and Aaron in Battenville, where Aaron was a successful\r\nmerchant. Eagerly she told them of her latest accomplishment. Aaron\r\nwas not impressed. Later at dinner when she offered him the delicious\r\ncream biscuits which she had baked, he remarked with his most\r\ntantalizing air of male superiority, \"I'd rather see a woman make\r\nbiscuits like these than solve the knottiest problem in algebra.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no reason,\" she retorted, \"why she should not be able to do\r\nboth.\"[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Report of the International Council of Women_, 1888 (Washington,\r\n1888), p. 163.\r\n\r\n[2] Charles B.

If particular care and\r\nattention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a\r\nrebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we\r\nhave no voice or representation.\" Ethel Armes, _Stratford Hall_\r\n(Richmond, Va., 1936), pp. 206-209.\r\n\r\n[4] Under the Missouri Compromise, Maine was admitted as a free state,\r\nMissouri as a slave state, and slavery was excluded from all of the\r\nLouisiana Purchase, north of latitude 36°31'.\r\n\r\n[5] The meeting house, built in 1783, is still standing. It is owned\r\nby the town of Adams, and cared for by the Adams Society of Friends\r\nDescendants. Susan traced her ancestry to William Anthony of Cologne\r\nwho migrated to England and during the reign of Edward VI, was made\r\nChief Graver of the Royal Mint and Master of the Scales, holding this\r\noffice also during the reign of Queen Mary and part of Queen\r\nElizabeth's reign. In 1634, one of his descendants, John Anthony,\r\nsettled in Rhode Island, and just before the Revolution, his great\r\ngrandson, David, Susan's great grandfather, bought land near Adams,\r\nMassachusetts, then regarded as the far West.\r\n\r\n[6] Ida Husted Harper, _The Life and Work of Susan B.

A farm on the outskirts of Rochester looked promising,\r\nand with the money which Lucy Anthony had inherited from Grandfather\r\nRead and which had been held for her by Uncle Joshua Read, the first\r\npayment had been made on the farm by Uncle Joshua, who held it in his\r\nname and leased it to Daniel.[21] Had it been turned over to Susan's\r\nmother, it would have become Daniel Anthony's property under the law\r\nand could have been claimed by his creditors.\r\n\r\nOnly Susan, Merritt, and Mary climbed into the stage with their\r\nparents, early in November 1845, on the first lap of their journey to\r\ntheir new home, near Rochester, New York. Guelma and Hannah[22] were\r\nboth married and settled in homes of their own, and young Daniel,\r\nclerking in Lenox, had decided to stay behind.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit with Uncle Joshua at Palatine Bridge, they boarded a\r\nline boat on the Erie Canal, taking with them their gray horse and\r\nwagon; and surrounded by their household goods, they moved slowly\r\nwestward. Standing beside her father in the warm November sunshine,\r\nSusan watched the strong horses on the towpath, plodding patiently\r\nahead, and heard the wash of the water against the prow and the noisy\r\ngreeting of boat horns. As they passed the snug friendly villages\r\nalong the canal and the wide fertile fields, now brown and bleak after\r\nthe harvest, she wondered what the new farm would be like and what the\r\nfuture would bring; and at night when the lights twinkled in the\r\nsettlements along the shore, she thought longingly of her old home and\r\nthe sisters she had left behind.\r\n\r\nAfter a journey of several days, they reached Rochester late in the\r\nafternoon. Her father took the horse and wagon off the boat, and in\r\nthe chill gray dusk drove them three miles over muddy roads to the\r\nfarm. It was dark when they arrived, and the house was cold, empty,\r\nand dismal, but after the fires were lighted and her mother had cooked\r\na big kettle of cornmeal mush, their spirits revived. Within the next\r\nfew days they transformed it into a cheerful comfortable home.\r\n\r\nThe house on a little hill overlooked their thirty-two acres. Back of\r\nit was the barn, a carriage house, and a little blacksmith shop.[23]\r\nLooking out over the flat snowy fields toward the curving Genesee\r\nRiver and the church steeples in Rochester, Susan often thought\r\nwistfully of the blue hills around Center Falls and Battenville and of\r\nthe good times she had had there.\r\n\r\nThe winter was lonely for her in spite of the friendliness of their\r\nQuaker neighbors, the De Garmos, and the Quaker families in Rochester\r\nwho called at once to welcome them. Her father found these neighbors\r\nvery congenial and they readily interested him in the antislavery\r\nmovement, now active in western New York. Within the next few months,\r\nseveral antislavery meetings were held in the Anthony home and opened\r\na new world to Susan. For the first time she heard of the Underground\r\nRailroad which secretly guided fugitive slaves to Canada and of the\r\nLiberty party which was making a political issue of slavery. She\r\nlistened to serious, troubled discussion of the annexation of Texas,\r\nbringing more power to the proslavery block, which even the\r\nacquisition of free Oregon could not offset. She read antislavery\r\ntracts and copies of William Lloyd Garrison's _Liberator_, borrowed\r\nfrom Quaker friends; and on long winter evenings, as she sat by the\r\nfire sewing, she talked over with her father the issues they raised.\r\n\r\nWhen spring came and the trees and bushes leafed out, she took more\r\ninterest in the farm, discovering its good points one by one--the\r\nflowering quince along the driveway, the pinks bordering the walk to\r\nthe front door, the rosebushes in the yard, and cherry trees, currant\r\nand gooseberry bushes in abundance. Her father planted peach and apple\r\norchards and worked the \"sixpenny farm,\"[24] as he called it, to the\r\nbest of his ability, but the thirty-two acres seemed very small\r\ncompared with the large Anthony and Read farms in the Berkshires, and\r\nhe soon began to look about for more satisfying work. This he found a\r\nfew years later with the New York Life Insurance Company, then\r\ndeveloping its business in western New York. Very successful in this\r\nnew field, he continued in it the rest of his life, but he always kept\r\nthe farm for the family home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first member of the family to leave the Rochester farm was Susan.\r\nThe cherry trees were in bloom when she received an offer from\r\nCanajoharie Academy to teach the female department. As Canajoharie was\r\nacross the river from Uncle Joshua Read's home in Palatine Bridge and\r\nhe was a trustee of the academy, she read between the lines his kindly\r\ninterest in her. He was an influential citizen of that community, a\r\nbank director and part owner of the Albany-Utica turnpike and the\r\nstage line to Schenectady. Accepting the offer at once, she made the\r\nlong journey by canal boat to Canajoharie, and early in May 1846 was\r\ncomfortably settled in the home of Uncle Joshua's daughter, Margaret\r\nRead Caldwell.\r\n\r\nShe soon loved Margaret as a sister and was devoted to her children.\r\nNone of her new friends were Quakers and she enjoyed their social life\r\nthoroughly, leaving behind her forever the somber clothing which she\r\nhad heretofore regarded as a mark of righteousness. She began her\r\nschool with twenty-five pupils and a yearly salary of approximately\r\n$110. This was more than she had ever earned before, and for the first\r\ntime in her life she spent her money freely on herself.\r\n\r\nHer first quarterly examination, held before the principal, the\r\ntrustees, and parents, established her reputation as a teacher, and in\r\naddition everyone said, \"The schoolmarm looks beautiful.\"[25] She had\r\ndressed up for the occasion, wearing a new plaid muslin, purple,\r\nwhite, blue, and brown, with white collar and cuffs, and had hung a\r\ngold watch and chain about her neck. She wound the four braids of her\r\nsmooth brown hair around her big shell comb and put on her new\r\nprunella gaiters with patent-leather heels and tips. She looked so\r\npretty, so neat, and so capable that many of the parents feared some\r\nyoung man would fall desperately in love with her and rob the academy\r\nof a teacher. She did have more than her share of admirers. She soon\r\nsaw her first circus and went to her first ball, a real novelty for\r\nthe young woman who had sat demurely along the wall in the attic room\r\nof her Center Falls home while her more worldly friends danced.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all her good times, she missed her family, but because of\r\nthe long trip to Rochester, she did not return to the farm for two\r\nyears. She spent her vacations with Guelma and Hannah, who lived only\r\na few hours away, or in Albany with her former teacher at Deborah\r\nMoulson's seminary, Lydia Mott, a cousin by marriage of Lucretia Mott.\r\nIn anticipation of a vacation at home, she wrote her parents,\r\n\"Sometimes I can hardly wait for the day to come. They have talked of\r\nbuilding a new academy this summer, but I do not believe they will. My\r\nroom is not fit to stay in and I have promised myself that I would not\r\npass another winter in it. If I must forever teach, I will seek at\r\nleast a comfortable house to do penance in. I have a pleasant school\r\nof twenty scholars, but I have to manufacture the interest duty\r\ncompels me to exhibit.... Energy and something to stimulate is\r\nwanting! But I expect the busy summer vacation spent with my dearest\r\nand truest friends will give me new life and fresh courage to\r\npersevere in the arduous path of duty. Do not think me unhappy with my\r\nfate, no not so. I am only a little tired and a good deal lazy. That\r\nis all. Do write very soon. Tell about the strawberries and peaches,\r\ncherries and plums.... Tell me how the yard looks, what flowers are in\r\nbloom and all about the farming business.\"[26]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring her visits in Albany with Lydia Mott, who was now an active\r\nabolitionist, Susan heard a great deal about antislavery work. At this\r\ntime, however, Canajoharie took little interest in this reform\r\nmovement, but temperance was gaining a foothold. Throughout the\r\ncountry, Sons of Temperance were organizing and women wanted to help,\r\nbut the men refused to admit them to their organizations, protesting\r\nthat public reform was outside women's sphere. Unwilling to be put off\r\nwhen the need was so great, women formed their own secret temperance\r\nsocieties, and then, growing bolder, announced themselves as Daughters\r\nof Temperance.\r\n\r\nCanajoharie had its Daughters of Temperance, and Susan, long an\r\nadvocate of temperance, gladly joined the crusade, and made her first\r\nspeech when the Daughters of Temperance held a supper meeting to\r\ninterest the people of the village. Few women at this time could have\r\nbeen persuaded to address an audience of both men and women, believing\r\nthis to be bold, unladylike, and contrary to the will of God; but the\r\nyoung Quaker, whose grandmother and aunts had always spoken in\r\nMeeting when the spirit moved them, was ready to say her word for\r\ntemperance, taking it for granted that it was not only woman's right\r\nbut her responsibility to speak and work for social reform.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred people assembled for the supper, and entering the\r\nhall, Susan found it festooned with cedar and red flannel and to her\r\namazement saw letters in evergreen on one of the walls, spelling out\r\nSusan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly knew how to conduct myself amidst so much kindly\r\nregard,\"[27] she confided to her family.\r\n\r\nShe had carefully written out her speech and had sewn the pages\r\ntogether in a blue cover. Now in a clear serious voice, she read its\r\nformal flowery sentences telling of the weekly meetings of \"this now\r\ndespised little band\" which had awakened women to the great need of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n\"It is generally conceded,\" she declared, \"that our sex fashions the\r\nsocial and moral state of society. We do not assume that females\r\npossess unbounded power in abolishing the evil customs of the day; but\r\nwe do believe that were they en masse to discontinue the use of wine\r\nand brandy as beverages at both their public and private parties, not\r\none of the opposite sex, who has any claim to the title of gentleman,\r\nwould so insult them as to come into their presence after having\r\nquaffed of that foul destroyer of all true delicacy and refinement....\r\nLadies! There is no neutral position for us to assume....\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe next day the village buzzed with talk of the meeting; only a few\r\ncriticized Susan for speaking in public, and almost all agreed that\r\nshe was the smartest woman in Canajoharie.\r\n\r\nWhile she was busy with her temperance work, there were stirrings\r\namong women in other parts of New York State in the spring and early\r\nsummer of 1848. Through the efforts of a few women who circulated\r\npetitions and the influence of wealthy men who saw irresponsible\r\nsons-in-law taking over the property they wanted their daughters to\r\nown, a Married Women's Property Law passed the legislature; this made\r\nit possible for a married woman to hold real estate in her own name.\r\nHeretofore all property owned by a woman at marriage and all received\r\nby gift or inheritance had at once become her husband's and he had had\r\nthe right to sell it or will it away without her consent and to\r\ncollect the rents or the income. The new law was welcomed in the\r\nAnthony household, for now Lucy Anthony's inheritance, which had\r\nbought the Rochester farm, could at last be put in her own name and\r\nneed no longer be held for her by her brother.\r\n\r\nIn the newspapers in July, Susan read scornful, humorous, and\r\nindignant reports of a woman's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New\r\nYork, at which women had issued a Declaration of Sentiments,\r\nannouncing themselves men's equals. They had protested against legal,\r\neconomic, social, and educational discriminations and asked for the\r\nfranchise. A woman's rights convention in the 1840s was a startling\r\nevent. Women, if they were \"ladies\" did not attend public gatherings\r\nwhere politics or social reforms were discussed, because such subjects\r\nwere regarded as definitely out of their sphere. Much less did they\r\nventure to call meetings of their own and issue bold resolutions.\r\n\r\nSusan was not shocked by this break with tradition, but she did not\r\ninstinctively come to the defense of these rebellious women, nor\r\nchampion their cause. She was amused rather than impressed. Yet\r\nLucretia Mott's presence at the convention aroused her curiosity.\r\nAmong her father's Quaker friends in Rochester, she had heard only\r\npraise of Mrs. Mott, and she herself, when a pupil at Deborah\r\nMoulson's seminary, had been inspired by Mrs. Mott's remarks at\r\nFriends' Meeting in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nSo far Susan had encountered few barriers because she was a woman. She\r\nhad had little personal contact with the hardships other women\r\nsuffered because of their inferior legal status. To be sure, it had\r\nbeen puzzling to her as child that Sally Hyatt, the most skillful\r\nweaver in her father's mill, had never been made overseer, but the\r\nfact that her mother had not the legal right to hold property in her\r\nown name did not at the time make an impression upon her. Brought up\r\nas a Quaker, she had no obstacles put in the way of her education. She\r\nhad an exceptional father who was proud of his daughters' intelligence\r\nand ability and respected their opinions and decisions. Her only real\r\ncomplaint was the low salary she had been obliged to accept as a\r\nteacher because she was a woman. She sensed a feeling of male\r\nsuperiority, which she resented, in her brother-in-law, Aaron McLean,\r\nwho did not approve of women preachers and who thought it more\r\nimportant for a woman to bake biscuits than to study algebra. She met\r\nthe same arrogance of sex in her Cousin Margaret's husband, but she\r\nhad not analyzed the cause, or seen the need of concerted action by\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nReturning home for her vacation in August, she found to her surprise\r\nthat a second woman's rights convention had been held in Rochester in\r\nthe Unitarian church, that her mother, her father, and her sister\r\nMary, and many of their Quaker friends had not only attended, but had\r\nsigned the Declaration of Sentiments and the resolutions, and that her\r\ncousin, Sarah Burtis Anthony, had acted as secretary. Her father\r\nshowed so much interest, as he told her about the meetings, that she\r\nlaughingly remarked, \"I think you are getting a good deal ahead of the\r\ntimes.\"[29] She countered Mary's ardent defense of the convention with\r\ngood-natured ridicule. The whole family, however, continued to be so\r\nenthusiastic over the meetings and this new movement for woman's\r\nrights, they talked so much about Elizabeth Cady Stanton \"with her\r\nblack curls and ruddy cheeks\"[30] and about Lucretia Mott \"with her\r\nQuaker cap and her crossed handkerchief of the finest muslin,\" both\r\n\"speaking so grandly and looking magnificent,\" that Susan's interest\r\nwas finally aroused and she decided she would like to meet these women\r\nand talk with them. There was no opportunity for this, however, before\r\nshe returned to Canajoharie for another year of teaching.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a year of great sadness because of the illness of her\r\ncousin Margaret whom she loved dearly. In addition to her teaching,\r\nshe nursed Margaret and looked after the house and children. She saw\r\nmuch to discredit the belief that men were the stronger and women the\r\nweaker sex, and impatient with Margaret's husband, she wrote her\r\nmother that there were some drawbacks to marriage that made a woman\r\nquite content to remain single. In explanation she added, \"Joseph had\r\na headache the other day and Margaret remarked that she had had one\r\nfor weeks. 'Oh,' said the husband, 'mine is the real headache, genuine\r\npain, yours is sort of a natural consequence.'\"[31]\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks Margaret died. This was heart-breaking for Susan,\r\nand without her cousin, Canajoharie offered little attraction.\r\nTeaching had become irksome. The new principal was uncongenial, a\r\nsevere young man from the South whose father was a slaveholder. Susan\r\nlonged for a change, and as she read of the young men leaving for the\r\nWest, lured by gold in California, she envied them their adventure and\r\ntheir opportunity to explore and conquer a whole new world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frederick Douglass]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe peaches were ripe when Susan returned to the farm. The orchard\r\nwhich her father had planted, now bore abundantly. Restless and eager\r\nfor hard physical work, she discarded the stylish hoops which impeded\r\naction, put on an old calico dress, and spent days in the warm\r\nSeptember sunshine picking peaches. Then while she preserved, canned,\r\nand pickled them, there was little time to long for pioneering in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed the active life on the farm for she was essentially a\r\ndoer, most happy when her hands and her mind were busy. As she helped\r\nwith the housework, wove rag carpet, or made shirts by hand for her\r\nfather and brothers, she dreamed of the future, of the work she might\r\ndo to make her life count for something. Teaching, she decided, was\r\ndefinitely behind her. She would not allow her sister Mary's interest\r\nin that career to persuade her otherwise, even if teaching were the\r\nonly promising and well-thought-of occupation for women. Reading the\r\npoems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, she was deeply stirred and looked\r\nforward romantically to some great and useful life work.\r\n\r\nThe _Liberator_, with its fearless denunciation of Negro slavery, now\r\ncame regularly to the Anthony home, and as she pored over its pages,\r\nits message fired her soul. Eagerly she called with her father at the\r\nhome of Frederick Douglass, who had recently settled in Rochester and\r\nwas publishing his paper, the _North Star_. Not only did she want to\r\nshow friendliness to this free Negro of whose intelligence and\r\neloquence she had heard so much, but she wanted to hear first-hand\r\nfrom him and his wife of the needs of his people.\r\n\r\nAlmost every Sunday the antislavery Quakers met at the Anthony farm.\r\nThe Posts, the Hallowells, the De Garmos, and the Willises were sure\r\nto be there. Sometimes they sent a wagon into the city for Frederick\r\nDouglass and his family. Now and then famous abolitionists joined the\r\ncircle when their work brought them to western New York--William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, looking with fatherly kindness at his friends through his\r\nsmall steel-rimmed spectacles; Wendell Phillips, handsome, learned,\r\nand impressive; black-bearded, fiery Parker Pillsbury; and the\r\nfriendly Unitarian pastor from Syracuse, the Reverend Samuel J. May.\r\nSusan, helping her mother with dinner for fifteen or twenty, was torn\r\nbetween establishing her reputation as a good cook and listening to\r\nthe interesting conversation. She heard them discuss woman's rights,\r\nwhich had divided the antislavery ranks. They talked of their\r\nantislavery campaigns and the infamous compromises made by Congress to\r\npacify the powerful slaveholding interests. Like William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, all of them refused to vote, not wishing to take any part in\r\na government which countenanced slavery. They called the Constitution\r\na proslavery document, advocated \"No Union with Slaveholders,\" and\r\ndemanded immediate and unconditional emancipation. All about them and\r\nwith their help the Underground Railroad was operating, circumventing\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law and guiding Negro refugees to Canada and\r\nfreedom. Amy and Isaac Post's barn, Susan knew, was a station on the\r\nUnderground, and the De Garmos and Frederick Douglass almost always\r\nhad a Negro hidden away. She heard of riots and mobs in Boston and\r\nOhio; but in Rochester not a fugitive was retaken and there were no\r\nstreet battles, although the New York _Herald_ advised the city to\r\nthrow its \"nigger printing press\"[32] into Lake Ontario and banish\r\nDouglass to Canada.\r\n\r\nAs the Society of Friends in Rochester was unfriendly to the\r\nantislavery movement, Susan with her father and other liberal Hicksite\r\nQuakers left it for the Unitarian church. Here for the first time they\r\nlistened to \"hireling ministry\" and to a formal church service with\r\nmusic. This was a complete break with what they had always known as\r\nworship, but the friendly Christian spirit expressed by both minister\r\nand congregation made them soon feel at home. This new religious\r\nfellowship put Susan in touch with the most advanced thought of the\r\nday, broke down some of the rigid precepts drilled into her at Deborah\r\nMoulson's seminary, and encouraged liberalism and tolerance. Although\r\nthere had been austerity in the outward forms of her Quaker training,\r\nit had developed in her a very personal religion, a strong sense of\r\nduty, and a high standard of ethics, which always remained with her.\r\nIt had fostered a love of mankind that reached out spontaneously to\r\nhelp the needy, the unfortunate, and the oppressed, and this now\r\nbecame the driving force of her life. It led her naturally to seek\r\nways and means to free the Negro from slavery and to turn to the\r\ntemperance movement to wipe out the evil of drunkenness.\r\n\r\nThese were the days when the reformed drunkard, John B. Gough, was\r\nlecturing throughout the country with the zeal of an evangelist,\r\ngetting thousands to sign the total-abstinence pledge. Inspired by his\r\nexample, the Daughters of Temperance were active in Rochester. They\r\nelected Susan their president, and not only did she plan suppers and\r\nfestivals to raise money for their work but she organized new\r\nsocieties in neighboring towns. Her more ambitious plans for them were\r\nsomewhat delayed by home responsibilities which developed when her\r\nfather became an agent of the New York Life Insurance Company. This\r\ntook him away from home a great deal, and as both her brothers were\r\nbusy with work of their own and Mary was teaching, it fell to Susan to\r\ntake charge of the farm. She superintended the planting, the\r\nharvesting, and the marketing, and enjoyed it, but she did not let it\r\ncrowd out her interest in the causes which now seemed so vital.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley's New York _Tribune_ came regularly to the farm, for\r\nthe Anthonys, like many others throughout the country, had come to\r\ndepend upon it for what they felt was a truthful report of the news.\r\nIn this day of few magazines, it met a real need, and Susan, poring\r\nover its pages, not only kept in touch with current events, but found\r\ninspiration in its earnest editorials which so often upheld the ideals\r\nwhich she felt were important. She found thought-provoking news in the\r\nfull and favorable report of the national woman's rights convention\r\nheld in Worcester, Massachusetts, in October 1850. Better informed now\r\nthrough her antislavery friends about this new movement for woman's\r\nrights, she was ready to consider it seriously and she read all the\r\nstirring speeches, noting the caliber of the men and women taking\r\npart. Garrison, Phillips, Pillsbury, and Lucretia Mott were there, as\r\nwell as Lucy Stone, that appealing young woman of whose eloquence on\r\nthe antislavery platform Susan had heard so much, and Abby Kelley\r\nFoster, whose appointment to office in the American Antislavery\r\nSociety had precipitated a split in the ranks on the \"woman question.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA year later, when Abby Kelley Foster and her husband Stephen spoke at\r\nantislavery meetings in Rochester, Susan had her first opportunity to\r\nmeet this fearless woman. Listening to Abby's speeches and watching\r\nthe play of emotion on her eager Irish face under the Quaker bonnet,\r\nSusan wondered if she would ever have the courage to follow her\r\nexample. Like herself, Abby had started as a schoolteacher, but after\r\nhearing Theodore Weld speak, had devoted herself to the antislavery\r\ncause, traveling alone through the country to say her word against\r\nslavery and facing not only the antagonism which abolition always\r\nprovoked, but the unreasoning prejudice against public speaking by\r\nwomen, which was fanned into flame by the clergy. For listening to\r\nAbby Kelley, men and women had been excommunicated. Mobs had jeered at\r\nher and often pelted her with rotten eggs. She had married a\r\nfellow-abolitionist, Stephen Foster, even more unrelenting than she.\r\n\r\nSensing Susan's interest in the antislavery cause and hoping to make\r\nan active worker of her, Abby and Stephen suggested that she join them\r\non a week's tour, during which she marveled at Abby's ability to hold\r\nthe attention and meet the arguments of her unfriendly audiences and\r\nwondered if she could ever be moved to such eloquence.\r\n\r\nNot yet ready to join the ranks as a lecturer, she continued her\r\napprenticeship by attending antislavery meetings whenever possible and\r\ntraveled to Syracuse for the convention which the mob had driven out\r\nof New York. Eager for more, she stopped over in Seneca Falls to hear\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison and the English abolitionist, George Thompson,\r\nand was the guest of a temperance colleague, Amelia Bloomer, an\r\nenterprising young woman who was editing a temperance paper for women,\r\n_The Lily_.\r\n\r\nTo her surprise Susan found Amelia in the bloomer costume about which\r\nshe had read in _The Lily_. Introduced in Seneca Falls by Elizabeth\r\nSmith Miller, the costume, because of its comfort, had so intrigued\r\nAmelia that she had advocated it in her paper and it had been dubbed\r\nwith her name. Looking at Amelia's long full trousers, showing beneath\r\nher short skirt but modestly covering every inch of her leg, Susan was\r\na bit startled. Yet she could understand the usefulness of the costume\r\neven if she had no desire to wear it herself. In fact she was more\r\nthan ever pleased with her new gray delaine dress with its long full\r\nskirt.\r\n\r\nSeneca Falls, however, had an attraction for Susan far greater than\r\neither William Lloyd Garrison or Amelia Bloomer, for it was the home\r\nof Elizabeth Cady Stanton whom she had longed to meet ever since 1848\r\nwhen her parents had reported so enthusiastically about her and the\r\nRochester woman's rights convention. Walking home from the antislavery\r\nmeeting with Mrs. Bloomer, Susan met Mrs. Stanton. She liked her at\r\nonce and later called at her home. They discussed abolition,\r\ntemperance, and woman's rights, and with every word Susan's interest\r\ngrew. Mrs. Stanton's interest in woman's rights and her forthright,\r\nclear thinking made an instant appeal. Never before had Susan had such\r\na satisfactory conversation with another woman, and she thought her\r\nbeautiful. Mrs. Stanton's deep blue eyes with their mischievous\r\ntwinkle, her rosy cheeks and short dark hair gave her a very youthful\r\nappearance, and it was hard for Susan to realize she was the mother of\r\nthree lively boys.\r\n\r\nSusan listened enthralled while Mrs. Stanton told how deeply she had\r\nbeen moved as a child by the pitiful stories of the women who came to\r\nher father's law office, begging for relief from the unjust property\r\nlaws which turned over their inheritance and their earnings to their\r\nhusbands. For the first time, Susan heard the story of the exclusion\r\nof women delegates from the World's antislavery convention in London,\r\nin 1840, which Mrs. Stanton had attended with her husband and where\r\nshe became the devoted friend of Lucretia Mott. She now better\r\nunderstood why these two women had called the first woman's rights\r\nconvention in 1848 at which Mrs. Stanton had made the first public\r\ndemand for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elizabeth Cady Stanton in her \"Bloomer costume\"]\r\n\r\nThey talked about the bloomer costume which Mrs. Stanton now wore and\r\nabout dress reform which at the moment seemed to Mrs. Stanton an\r\nimportant phase of the woman's rights movement, and she pointed out to\r\nSusan the advantages of the bloomer in the life of a busy housekeeper\r\nwho ran up and down stairs carrying babies, lamps, and buckets of\r\nwater. She praised the freedom it gave from uncomfortable stays and\r\ntight lacing, confident it would be a big factor in improving the\r\nhealth of women.\r\n\r\nThoroughly interested, Susan left Seneca Falls with much to think\r\nabout, but not yet converted to the bloomer costume, or even to woman\r\nsuffrage. Of one thing, however, she was certain. She wanted this\r\nwoman of vision and courage for her friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Anthony Collection, Museum of Arts and Sciences, Rochester, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n[22] Hannah Anthony married Eugene Mosher, a merchant of Easton, New\r\nYork, on September 4, 1845.\r\n\r\n[23] Ms., Susan B.

Anyone implicated in the escape of a slave was liable to\r\n$1000 fine, to the payment of $1000 to the owner of the fugitive, and\r\nto a possible jail sentence of six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM TO SPEAK\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan was soon rejoicing at the prospect of meeting Lucy Stone and\r\nHorace Greeley, the editor of the New York _Tribune_. Mrs. Stanton had\r\ninvited her to Seneca Falls to discuss with them and other influential\r\nmen and women the founding of a people's college. Unhesitatingly she\r\njoined forces with Mrs. Stanton and Lucy Stone to insist that the\r\npeople's college be opened to women on the same terms as men. Lucy had\r\nproved the practicability of this as a student at Oberlin, the first\r\ncollege to admit women, and was one of the first women to receive a\r\ncollege degree. However, to suggest coeducation in those days was\r\nenough to jeopardize the founding of a college, and Horace Greeley\r\nstood out against them, his babylike face, fringed with throat\r\nwhiskers, getting redder by the moment as he begged them not to\r\nagitate the question.\r\n\r\nThe people's college did not materialize, but out of this meeting grew\r\na friendship between Susan, Elizabeth Stanton, and Lucy Stone, which\r\ndeveloped the woman's rights movement in the United States. Susan\r\ndiscovered at once that Lucy, like Mrs. Stanton, was an ardent\r\nadvocate of woman's rights. Brought up in a large family on a farm in\r\nwestern Massachusetts where a woman's lot was an unending round of\r\nhard work with no rights over her children or property, Lucy had seen\r\nmuch to make her rebellious. Resolving to free herself from this\r\nbondage, she had worked hard for an education, finally reaching\r\nOberlin College. Here she held out for equal rights in education, and\r\nnow as she went through the country, pleading for the abolition of\r\nslavery, she was not only putting into practice woman's right to\r\nexpress herself on public affairs, but was scattering woman's rights\r\ndoctrine wherever she went. Listening to this rosy-cheeked,\r\nenthusiastic young woman with her little snub nose and soulful gray\r\neyes, Susan began to realize how little opposition in comparison she\r\nherself had met because she was a woman. Not only had her father\r\nencouraged her to become a teacher, but he had actually aroused her\r\ninterest in such causes as abolition, temperance, and woman's rights,\r\nwhile both Lucy and Mrs. Stanton had met disapproval and resistance\r\nall the way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lucy Stone]\r\n\r\nShe found Lucy, as well as Mrs. Stanton, in the bloomer dress,\r\npraising its convenience. As Lucy traveled about lecturing, in all\r\nkinds of weather, climbing on trains, into carriages, and walking on\r\nmuddy streets, she found it much more practical and comfortable than\r\nthe fashionable long full skirts. Nevertheless, there was discomfort\r\nin being stared at on the streets and in the chagrin of her friends.\r\nThis reform was much on their minds and they discussed it pro and con,\r\nfor Mrs. Stanton was facing real persecution in Seneca Falls, with\r\nboys screaming \"breeches\" at her when she appeared in the street and\r\nwith her husband's political opponents ridiculing her costume in their\r\ncampaign speeches. Both women, however, felt it their duty to bear\r\nthis cross to free women from the bondage of cumbersome clothing,\r\nhoping always that the bloomer, because of its utility, would win\r\nconverts and finally become the fashion. Susan admired their courage,\r\nbut still could not be persuaded to put on the bloomer.\r\n\r\nFired with their zeal, she began planning what she herself might do\r\nto rouse women. The idea of a separate woman's rights movement did not\r\nas yet enter her mind. Her thoughts turned rather to the two national\r\nreform movements already well under way, temperance and antislavery.\r\nWhile a career as an antislavery worker appealed strongly to her, she\r\nfelt unqualified when she measured herself with the courageous Grimké\r\nsisters from South Carolina, or with Abby Kelley Foster, Lucy Stone,\r\nand the eloquent men in the movement. She had made a place for herself\r\nlocally in temperance societies, and she decided that her work was\r\nthere--to make women an active, important part of this reform.\r\n\r\nThat winter, as a delegate of the Rochester Daughters of Temperance,\r\nshe went with high hopes to the state convention of the Sons of\r\nTemperance in Albany, where she visited Lydia Mott and her sister\r\nAbigail, who lived in a small house on Maiden Lane. Both Lydia and\r\nAbigail, because of their independence, interested Susan greatly. They\r\nsupported themselves by \"taking in\" boarders from among the leading\r\npoliticians in Albany. They also kept a men's furnishings store on\r\nBroadway and made hand-ruffled shirt bosoms and fine linen accessories\r\nfor Thurlow Weed, Horatio Seymour, and other influential citizens.\r\nTheir political contacts were many and important, and yet they were\r\nalso among the very few in that conservative city who stood for\r\ntemperance, abolition of slavery, and woman's rights. Their home was a\r\nrallying point for reformers and a refuge for fugitive slaves. It was\r\nto be a second home to Susan in the years to come.\r\n\r\nWhen Susan and the other women delegates entered the convention of the\r\nSons of Temperance, they looked forward proudly, if a bit timidly, to\r\ntaking part in the meetings, but when Susan spoke to a motion, the\r\nchairman, astonished that a woman would be so immodest as to speak in\r\na public meeting, scathingly announced, \"The sisters were not invited\r\nhere to speak, but to listen and to learn.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that Susan had been publicly rebuked because\r\nshe was a woman, and she did not take it lightly. Leaving the hall\r\nwith several other indignant women delegates, amid the critical\r\nwhisperings of those who remained \"to listen and to learn,\" she\r\nhurried over to Lydia's shop to ask her advice on the next step to be\r\ntaken. Lydia, delighted that they had had the spirit to leave the\r\nmeeting, suggested they engage the lecture room of the Hudson Street\r\nPresbyterian Church and hold a meeting of their own that very night.\r\nShe went with them to the office of her friend Thurlow Weed, the\r\neditor of the _Evening Journal_, who published the whole story in his\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony at the age of thirty-four]\r\n\r\nWell in advance of the meeting, Susan was at the church, feeling very\r\nresponsible, and when she saw Samuel J. May enter, she was greatly\r\nrelieved. He had read the notice in the _Evening Journal_ and\r\npersuaded a friend to come with him. To see his genial face in the\r\naudience gave her confidence, for he would speak easily and well if\r\nothers should fail her. Only a few people drifted into the meeting,\r\nfor the night was snowy and cold. The room was poorly lighted, the\r\nstove smoked, and in the middle of the speeches, the stovepipe fell\r\ndown. Yet in spite of all this, a spirit of independence and\r\naccomplishment was born in that gathering and plans were made to call\r\na woman's state temperance convention in Rochester with Susan in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAll this Susan reported to her new friend, Elizabeth Stanton, who\r\npromised to help all she could, urging that the new organization lead\r\nthe way and not follow the advice of cautious, conservative women.\r\nSusan agreed, and as a first step in carrying out this policy, she\r\nasked Mrs. Stanton to make the keynote speech of the convention. Soon\r\nthe Woman's State Temperance Society was a going concern with Mrs.\r\nStanton as president and Susan as secretary. There was no doubt about\r\nits leading the way far ahead of the rank and file of the temperance\r\nmovement when Mrs. Stanton, with Susan's full approval, recommended\r\ndivorce on the grounds of drunkenness, declaring, \"Let us petition our\r\nState government so to modify the laws affecting marriage and the\r\ncustody of children that the drunkard shall have no claims on wife and\r\nchild.\"[34]\r\n\r\nSuch independence on the part of women could not be tolerated, and\r\nboth the press and the clergy ruthlessly denounced the Woman's State\r\nTemperance Society. Susan, however, did not take this too seriously,\r\nfamiliar as she was with the persecution antislavery workers endured\r\nwhen they frankly expressed their convictions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow recognized as the leader of women's temperance groups in New York,\r\nSusan traveled throughout the state, organizing temperance societies,\r\ngetting subscriptions for Amelia Bloomer's temperance paper, _The\r\nLily_, and attending temperance conventions in spite of the fact that\r\nshe met determined opposition to the participation of women. Impressed\r\nby the success of political action in Maine, where in 1851 the first\r\nprohibition law in the country had been passed, she now signed her\r\nletters, \"Yours for Temperance Politics.\"[35] She appealed to women to\r\npetition for a Maine law for New York and brought a group of women\r\nbefore the legislature for the first time for a hearing on this\r\nprohibition bill. Realizing then that women's indirect influence could\r\nbe of little help in political action, she saw clearly that women\r\nneeded the vote.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was the woman's rights convention in Syracuse, New York,\r\nin September 1852, which turned her thoughts definitely in the\r\ndirection of votes for women. It was the first woman's rights\r\ngathering she had ever attended and she was enthusiastic over the\r\npeople she met. She talked eagerly with the courageous Jewish\r\nlecturer, Ernestine Rose; with Dr. Harriot K. Hunt of Boston, one of\r\nthe first women physicians, who was waging a battle against taxation\r\nwithout representation; with Clarina Nichols of Vermont, editor of\r\nthe _Windham County Democrat_, and with Matilda Joslyn Gage, the\r\nyoungest member of the convention. All of these became valuable, loyal\r\nfriends in the years ahead. Susan renewed her acquaintance with Lucy\r\nStone, and met Antoinette Brown who had also studied at Oberlin\r\nCollege and was now the first woman ordained as a minister. With real\r\npleasure she greeted Mrs. Stanton's cousin, Gerrit Smith, now\r\nCongressman from New York, and his daughter, Elizabeth Smith Miller,\r\nthe originator of the much-discussed bloomer. Best of all was her\r\nlong-hoped-for meeting with James and Lucretia Mott and Lucretia's\r\nsister, Martha C. Wright. Only Paulina Wright Davis of Providence and\r\nElizabeth Oakes Smith of Boston were disappointing, for they appeared\r\nat the meetings in short-sleeved, low-necked dresses with\r\nloose-fitting jackets of pink and blue wool, shocking her deeply\r\nintrenched Quaker instincts. Although she realized that they wore\r\nultrafashionable clothes to show the world that not all woman's rights\r\nadvocates were frumps wearing the hideous bloomer, she could not\r\nforgive them for what to her seemed bad taste. How could such women,\r\nshe asked herself, hope to represent the earnest, hard-working women\r\nwho must be the backbone of the equal rights movement? Always\r\nforthright, when a principle was at stake, she expressed her feelings\r\nfrankly when James Mott, serving with her on the nominating committee,\r\nproposed Elizabeth Oakes Smith for president. His reply, that they\r\nmust not expect all women to dress as plainly as the Friends, in no\r\nway quieted her opposition. To her delight, Lucretia Mott was elected,\r\nand her dignity and poise as president of this large convention of\r\n2,000 won the respect even of the critical press. Susan was elected\r\nsecretary and so clearly could her voice be heard as she read the\r\nminutes and the resolutions that the Syracuse _Standard_ commented,\r\n\"Miss Anthony has a capital voice and deserves to be clerk of the\r\nAssembly.\"[36]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James and Lucretia Mott]\r\n\r\nNot all of the newspapers were so friendly. Some labeled the gathering\r\n\"a Tomfoolery convention\" of \"Aunt Nancy men and brawling women\";\r\nothers called it \"the farce at Syracuse,\"[37] but for Susan it marked\r\na milestone. Never before had she heard so many earnest, intelligent\r\nwomen plead so convincingly for property rights, civil rights, and the\r\nballot. Never before had she seen so clearly that in a republic women\r\nas well as men should enjoy these rights. The ballot assumed a new\r\nimportance for her. Her conversion to woman suffrage was complete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis new interest in the vote was steadily nurtured by Elizabeth\r\nStanton, whom Susan now saw more frequently. Whenever she could, Susan\r\nstopped over in Seneca Falls for a visit. Here she found inspiration,\r\nnew ideas, and good advice, and always left the comfortable Stanton\r\nhome ready to battle for the rights of women. While Susan traveled\r\nabout, organizing temperance societies and attending conventions, Mrs.\r\nStanton, tied down at home by a family of young children, wrote\r\nletters and resolutions for her and helped her with her speeches.\r\nSusan was very reluctant about writing speeches or making them. The\r\nmoment she sat down to write, her thoughts refused to come and her\r\nphrases grew stilted. She needed encouragement, and Mrs. Stanton gave\r\nit unstintingly, for she had grown very fond of this young woman whose\r\nmental companionship she found so stimulating.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these visits, Susan finally put on the bloomer and cut\r\nher long thick brown hair as part of the stern task of winning\r\nfreedom for women. It was not an easy decision and she came to it only\r\nbecause she was unwilling to do less for the cause than Mrs. Stanton\r\nor Lucy Stone. Comfortable as the new dress was, it always attracted\r\nunfavorable attention and added fuel to the fire of an unfriendly\r\npress. This fire soon scorched her at the World's Temperance\r\nconvention in New York, where women delegates faced the determined\r\nanimosity of the clergy, who held the balance of power and quoted the\r\nBible to prove that women were defying the will of God when they took\r\npart in public meetings. Obliged to withdraw, the women held meetings\r\nof their own in the Broadway Tabernacle, over which Susan presided\r\nwith a poise and confidence undreamed of a few months before. A\r\nsuccess in every way, they were nevertheless described by the press as\r\na battle of the sexes, a free-for-all struggle in which shrill-voiced\r\nwomen in the bloomer costume were supported by a few \"male Betties.\"\r\nThe New York _Sun_ spoke of Susan's \"ungainly form rigged out in the\r\nbloomer costume and provoking the thoughtless to laughter and ridicule\r\nby her very motions on the platform.\"[38] Untruth was piled upon\r\nuntruth until dignified ladylike Susan with her earnest pleasing\r\nappearance was caricatured into everything a woman should not be. Less\r\ncourageous temperance women now began to wonder whether they ought to\r\nassociate with such a strong-minded woman as Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nThere were rumblings of discontent when the Woman's State Temperance\r\nSociety met in Rochester for its next annual convention in June 1853,\r\nand Susan and Mrs. Stanton were roundly criticized because they did\r\nnot confine themselves to the subject of temperance and talked too\r\nmuch about woman's rights. Not only was Mrs. Stanton defeated for the\r\npresidency but the by-laws were amended to make men eligible as\r\nofficers. Men had been barred when the first by-laws were drafted by\r\nSusan and Mrs. Stanton because they wished to make the society a\r\nproving ground for women and were convinced that men holding office\r\nwould take over the management, and women, less experienced, would\r\nyield to their wishes.\r\n\r\nThis now proved to be the case, as the men began to do all the\r\ntalking, calling for a new name for the society and insisting that all\r\ndiscussion of woman's rights be ruled out. In the face of this clear\r\nindication of a determined new policy which few of the women wished to\r\nresist, Susan refused re-election as secretary and both she and Mrs.\r\nStanton resigned.\r\n\r\nThis was Susan's first experience with intrigue and her first rebuff\r\nby women whom she had sincerely tried to serve. Defeated, hurt, and\r\nuncertain, she poured out her disappointment in troubled letters to\r\nElizabeth Stanton, who, with the steadying touch of an older sister,\r\nroused her with the challenge, \"We have other and bigger fish to\r\nfry.\"[39]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few months later, Susan was off on a new crusade as she attended the\r\nstate teachers' convention in Rochester. Of the five hundred teachers\r\npresent, two-thirds were women, but there was not the slightest\r\nrecognition of their presence. They filled the back seats of\r\nCorinthian Hall, forming an inert background for the vocal minority,\r\nthe men. After sitting through two days' sessions and growing more and\r\nmore impatient as not one woman raised her voice, Susan listened, as\r\nlong as she could endure it, to a lengthy debate on the question, \"Why\r\nthe profession of teacher is not as much respected as that of lawyer,\r\ndoctor, or minister.\"[40] Then she rose to her feet and in a\r\nlow-pitched, clear voice addressed the chairman.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of a woman's voice, an astonished rustle of excitement\r\nswept through the audience, and when the chairman, Charles Davies,\r\nProfessor of Mathematics at West Point, had recovered from his\r\nsurprise, he patronizingly asked, \"What will the lady have?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish, sir, to speak to the subject under discussion,\" she bravely\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nTurning to the men in the front row, Professor Davies then asked,\r\n\"What is the pleasure of the convention?\"\r\n\r\n\"I move that she be heard,\" shouted an unexpected champion. Another\r\nseconded the motion. After a lengthy debate during which Susan stood\r\npatiently waiting, the men finally voted their approval by a small\r\nmajority, and Professor Davies, a bit taken aback, announced, \"The\r\nlady may speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, gentlemen,\" Susan began, \"that none of you quite\r\ncomprehend the cause of the disrespect of which you complain. Do you\r\nnot see that so long as society says woman is incompetent to be a\r\nlawyer, minister, or doctor, but has ample ability to be a teacher,\r\nevery man of you who chooses this profession tacitly acknowledges that\r\nhe has no more brains than a woman? And this, too, is the reason that\r\nteaching is a less lucrative profession; as here men must compete with\r\nthe cheap labor of woman. Would you exalt your profession, exalt those\r\nwho labor with you. Would you make it more lucrative, increase the\r\nsalaries of the women engaged in the noble work of educating our\r\nfuture Presidents, Senators, and Congressmen.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment after this bombshell, there was complete silence. Then\r\nthree men rushed down the aisle to congratulate her, telling her she\r\nhad pluck, that she had hit the nail on the head, but the women near\r\nby glanced scornfully at her, murmuring, \"Who can that creature be?\"\r\n\r\nSusan, however, had started a few women thinking and questioning, and\r\nthe next morning, Professor Davies, resplendent in his buff vest and\r\nblue coat with brass buttons, opened the convention with an\r\nexplanation. \"I have been asked,\" he said, \"why no provisions have\r\nbeen made for female lecturers before this association and why ladies\r\nare not appointed on committees. I will answer.\" Then, in flowery\r\nmetaphor, he assured them that he would not think of dragging women\r\nfrom their pedestals into the dust.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful, beautiful,\" murmured the women in the back rows, but Mrs.\r\nNorthrup of Rochester offered resolutions recognizing the right of\r\nwomen teachers to share in all the privileges and deliberations of the\r\norganization and calling attention to the inadequate salaries women\r\nteachers received. These resolutions were kept before the meeting by a\r\ndetermined group and finally adopted. Susan also offered the name of\r\nEmma Willard as a candidate for vice-president, thinking the\r\nsuccessful retired principal of the Troy Female Seminary, now\r\ninterested in improving the public schools, might also be willing to\r\nlend a hand in improving the status of women in this educational\r\norganization. Mrs. Willard, however, declined the nomination, refusing\r\nto be drawn into Susan's rebellion.[41] Susan, nevertheless, left the\r\nconvention satisfied that she had driven an entering wedge into\r\nProfessor Davies' male stronghold, and she continued battering at\r\nthis stronghold whenever she had an opportunity. She meant to put\r\nwomen in office and to win approval for coeducation and equal pay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTeachers' conventions, however, were only a minor part of her new\r\ncrusade, plans for which were still simmering in her mind and\r\ndeveloping from day to day. Going back to many of the towns where she\r\nhad held temperance meetings, she found that most of the societies she\r\nhad organized had disbanded because women lacked the money to engage\r\nspeakers or to subscribe to temperance papers. If they were married,\r\nthey had no money of their own and no right to any interest outside\r\ntheir homes, unless their husbands consented.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged, she wrote in her diary, \"As I passed from town to town I\r\nwas made to feel the great evil of woman's entire dependency upon man\r\nfor the necessary means to aid on any and every reform movement.\r\nThough I had long admitted the wrong, I never until this time so fully\r\ntook in the grand idea of pecuniary and personal independence. It\r\nmatters not how overflowing with benevolence toward suffering humanity\r\nmay be the heart of woman, it avails nothing so long as she possesses\r\nnot the power to act in accordance with these promptings. Woman must\r\nhave a purse of her own, and how can this be, so long as the _Wife_ is\r\ndenied the right to her individual and joint earnings. Reflections\r\nlike these, caused me to see and really feel that there was no true\r\nfreedom for Woman without the possession of all her property rights,\r\nand that these rights could be obtained through legislation only, and\r\nso, the sooner the demand was made of the Legislature, the sooner\r\nwould we be likely to obtain them.\"[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[34] _The Lily_, May, 1852.\r\n\r\n[35] Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B.

This was definitely a challenge\r\nand she at once turned to Elizabeth Stanton for counsel. Somehow she\r\nmust persuade Mrs. Stanton to find time in spite of her many household\r\ncares to prepare a speech for the convention and for presentation to\r\nthe legislature. As eager as Susan to free women from unjust property\r\nlaws, Mrs. Stanton asked only that Susan get a good lawyer, and one\r\nsympathetic to the cause, to look up New York State's very worst laws\r\naffecting women.[43] She could think and philosophize while she was\r\nbaking and sewing, she assured Susan, but she had no time for\r\nresearch. Susan produced the facts for Mrs. Stanton, and while she\r\nworked on the speech, Susan went from door to door during the cold\r\nblustery days of December and January 1854 to get signatures on her\r\npetitions for married women's property rights and woman suffrage. Some\r\nof the women signed, but more of them slammed the door in her face,\r\ndeclaring indignantly that they had all the rights they wanted. Yet at\r\nthis time a father had the legal authority to apprentice or will away\r\na child without the mother's consent and an employer was obliged by\r\nlaw to pay a wife's wages to her husband.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the bloomer costume made it easier for her\r\nto get about in the snowy streets, she now found it a real burden\r\nbecause it always attracted unfavorable attention. Boys jeered at her\r\nand she was continually conscious of the amused, critical glances of\r\nthe men and women she met. She longed to take it off and wear an\r\ninconspicuous trailing skirt, but if she had been right to put it on,\r\nit would be weakness to take it off. By this time Elizabeth Stanton\r\nhad given it up except in her own home, convinced that it harmed the\r\ncause and that the physical freedom it gave was not worth the price.\r\n\"I hope you have let down a dress and a petticoat,\" she now wrote\r\nSusan. \"The cup of ridicule is greater than you can bear. It is not\r\nwise, Susan, to use up so much energy and feeling in that way. You\r\ncan put them to better use. I speak from experience.\"[44]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her son, Henry]\r\n\r\nLucy Stone too was wavering and was thinking of having her next dress\r\nmade long. The three women corresponded about it, and Lucy as well as\r\nMrs. Stanton urged Susan to give up the bloomer. With these entreaties\r\nringing in her ears, Susan set out for Albany in February 1854 to make\r\nfinal arrangements for the convention. On the streets in Albany, in\r\nthe printing offices, and at the capitol, men stared boldly at her,\r\nsome calling out hilariously, \"Here comes my bloomer.\" She endured it\r\nbravely until her work was done, but at night alone in her room at\r\nLydia Mott's she poured out her anguish in letters to Lucy. \"Here I am\r\nknown only,\" she wrote, \"as one of the women who ape men--coarse,\r\nbrutal men! Oh, I can not, can not bear it any longer.\"[45]\r\n\r\nEven so she did not let down the hem of her skirt, but wore her\r\nbloomer costume heroically during the entire convention, determined\r\nthat she would not be stampeded into a long skirt by the jeers of\r\nAlbany men or the ridicule of the women. However, she made up her mind\r\nthat immediately after the convention she would take off the bloomer\r\nforever. She had worn it a little over a year. Never again could she\r\nbe lured into the path of dress reform.\r\n\r\nThe Albany _Register_ scoffed at the \"feminine propagandists of\r\nwoman's rights\" exhibiting themselves in \"short petticoats and\r\nlong-legged boots.\"[46] Nevertheless, the convention aroused such\r\ngenuine interest that evening meetings were continued for two weeks,\r\nfeaturing as speakers Ernestine Rose, Antoinette Brown, Samuel J. May,\r\nand William Henry Channing, the young Unitarian minister from\r\nRochester; and when the men appeared on the platform, the audience\r\ncalled for the women.\r\n\r\nSusan could not have asked for anything better than Elizabeth\r\nStanton's moving plea for property rights for married women and the\r\nattention it received from the large audience in the Senate Chamber.\r\nHer heart swelled with pride as she listened to her friend, and so\r\nimportant did she think the speech that she had 50,000 copies printed\r\nfor distribution.\r\n\r\nTo back up Mrs. Stanton's words with concrete evidence of a demand for\r\na change in the law, Susan presented petitions with 10,000 signatures,\r\n6,000 asking that married women be granted the right to their wages\r\nand 4,000 venturing to be recorded for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic over her Albany success, she impetuously wrote Lucy\r\nStone, \"Is this not a wonderful time, an era long to be\r\nremembered?\"[47]\r\n\r\nAlthough the legislature failed to act on the petitions, she knew that\r\nher cause had made progress, for never before had women been listened\r\nto with such respect and never had newspapers been so friendly. She\r\ncherished these words of praise from Lucy, \"God bless you, Susan dear,\r\nfor the brave heart that will work on even in the midst of\r\ndiscouragement and lack of helpers. Everywhere I am telling people\r\nwhat your state is doing, and it is worth a great deal to the cause.\r\nThe example of positive action is what we need.\"[48]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan continued her \"example of positive action,\" this time against\r\nthe Kansas-Nebraska bill, pending in Congress, which threatened repeal\r\nof the Missouri Compromise by admitting Kansas and Nebraska as\r\nterritories with the right to choose for themselves whether they\r\nwould be slave or free. \"I feel that woman should in the very capitol\r\nof the nation lift her voice against that abominable measure,\" she\r\nwrote Lucy Stone, with whom she was corresponding more and more\r\nfrequently. \"It is not enough that H. B. Stowe should write.\"[49]\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe's _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ had been published in 1852\r\nand during that year 300,000 copies were sold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ernestine Rose]\r\n\r\nWith Ernestine Rose, Susan now headed for Washington. These two women\r\nhad been drawn together by common interests ever since they had met in\r\nSyracuse in 1852. Susan was not frightened, as many were, by\r\nErnestine's reputed atheism. She appreciated Ernestine's intelligence,\r\nher devotion to woman's rights, and her easy eloquence. Conscious of\r\nher own limitations as an orator, she recognized her need of Ernestine\r\nfor the many meetings she planned for the future.\r\n\r\nAs they traveled to Washington together, she learned more about this\r\nbeautiful, impressive, black-haired Jewess from Poland, who was ten\r\nyears her senior. The daughter of a rabbi, Ernestine had found the\r\nlimitations of orthodox religion unbearable for a woman and had left\r\nher home to see and learn more of the world in Prussia, Holland,\r\nFrance, Scotland, and England. She had married an Englishman\r\nsympathetic to her liberal views, and together they had come to New\r\nYork where she began her career as a lecturer in 1836 when speaking in\r\npublic branded women immoral. She spoke easily and well on education,\r\nwoman's rights, and the evils of slavery. Her slight foreign accent\r\nadded charm to her rich musical voice, and before long she was in\r\ndemand as far west as Ohio and Michigan. With a colleague as\r\nexperienced as Ernestine, Susan dared arrange for meetings even in the\r\ncapital of the nation.\r\n\r\nWashington was tense over the slavery issue when they arrived, and\r\nErnestine's friends warned her not to mention the subject in her\r\nlectures. Unheeding she commented on the Kansas-Nebraska bill, but the\r\npress took no notice and her audiences showed no signs of\r\ndissatisfaction. In fact, two comparatively unknown women, billed to\r\nlecture on the \"Educational and Social Rights of Women\" and the\r\n\"Political and Legal Rights of Women,\" attracted little attention in a\r\ncity accustomed to a blaze of Congressional oratory. Hoping to draw\r\nlarger audiences and to lend dignity to their meetings, Susan asked\r\nfor the use of the Capitol on Sunday, but was refused because\r\nErnestine was not a member of a religious society. Making an attempt\r\nfor Smithsonian Hall, Ernestine was told it could not risk its\r\nreputation by presenting a woman speaker.[50]\r\n\r\nA failure financially, their Washington venture was rich in\r\nexperience. Susan took time out for sightseeing, visiting the\r\n\"President's house\" and Mt. Vernon, which to her surprise she found in\r\na state of \"delapidation and decay.\" \"The mark of slavery o'ershadows\r\nthe whole,\" she wrote in her diary. \"Oh the thought that it was here\r\nthat he whose name is the pride of this Nation, was the _Slave\r\nMaster_.\"[51]\r\n\r\nAgain and again in the Capitol, she listened to heated debates on the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill, astonished at the eloquence and fervor with\r\nwhich the \"institution of slavery\" could be defended. Seeing slavery\r\nfirst-hand, she abhorred it more than ever and observed with dismay\r\nits degenerating influence on master as well as slave. She began to\r\nfeel that even she herself might be undermined by it almost\r\nunwittingly and confessed to her diary, \"This noon, I ate my dinner\r\nwithout once asking myself are these human beings who minister to my\r\nwants, Slaves to be bought and sold and hired out at the will of a\r\nmaster?... Even I am getting _accustomed_ to _Slavery_ ... so much so\r\nthat I have ceased continually to be made to feel its blighting,\r\ncursing influence.\"[52]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few months later, Susan and Ernestine were in Philadelphia at a\r\nnational woman's rights convention, and when Ernestine was proposed\r\nfor president, Susan had her first opportunity to champion her new\r\nfriend. A foreigner and a free-thinker, Ernestine encountered a great\r\ndeal of prejudice even among liberal reformers, and Susan was\r\nsurprised at the strength of feeling against her. Impressed during\r\ntheir trip to Washington by Ernestine's essentially fine qualities and\r\nher value to the cause, Susan fought for her behind the scenes,\r\ninsisting that freedom of religion or the freedom to have no religion\r\nbe observed in woman's rights conventions, and she had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing Ernestine elected to the office she so richly\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nFreedom of religion or freedom to have no religion had become for\r\nSusan a principle to hold on to, as she listened at these early\r\nwoman's rights meetings to the lengthy fruitless discussions regarding\r\nthe lack of Scriptural sanction for women's new freedom. Usually a\r\nclergyman appeared on the scene, volubly quoting the Bible to prove\r\nthat any widening of woman's sphere was contrary to the will of God.\r\nBut always ready to refute him were Antoinette Brown, now an ordained\r\nminister, William Lloyd Garrison, and occasionally Susan herself. To\r\nthe young Quaker broadened by her Unitarian contacts and unhampered by\r\ncreed or theological dogma, such debates were worse than useless; they\r\ndeepened theological differences, stirred up needless antagonisms,\r\nsolved no problems, and wasted valuable time.\r\n\r\nDuring this convention, she was one of the twenty-four guests in\r\nLucretia Mott's comfortable home at 238 Arch Street. Every meal, with\r\nits stimulating discussions, was a convention in itself. Susan's great\r\nhero, William Lloyd Garrison, sat at Lucretia's right at the long\r\ntable in the dining room, Susan on her left, and at the end of each\r\nmeal, when the little cedar tub filled with hot soapy water was\r\nbrought in and set before Lucretia so that she could wash the silver,\r\nglass, and fine china at the table, Susan dried them on a snowy-white\r\ntowel while the interesting conversation continued. There was talk of\r\nwoman's rights, of temperance, and of spiritualism, which was\r\nattracting many new converts. There were thrilling stories of the\r\nopening of the West and the building of transcontinental railways; but\r\nmost often and most earnestly the discussion turned to the progress of\r\nthe antislavery movement, to the infamous Kansas-Nebraska bill, to the\r\nNew England Emigrant Aid Company,[53] which was sending free-state\r\nsettlers to Kansas, to the weakness of the government in playing again\r\nand again into the hands of the proslavery faction. Most of them saw\r\nthe country headed toward a vast slave empire which would embrace\r\nCuba, Mexico, and finally Brazil; and William Lloyd Garrison fervently\r\nreiterated his doctrine, \"No Union with Slaveholders.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving home Susan had heard first-hand reports of the bitter\r\nbloody antislavery contest in Kansas from her brother Daniel, who had\r\njust returned from a trip to that frontier territory with settlers\r\nsent out by the New England Emigrant Aid Company. Now talking with\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, she found herself torn between these two great\r\ncauses for human freedom, abolition and woman's rights, and it was\r\nhard for her to decide which cause needed her more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe had not, however, forgotten her unfinished business in New York\r\nState. The refusal of the legislature to amend the property laws had\r\ndoubled her determination to continue circulating petitions until\r\nmarried women's civil rights were finally recognized. It took courage\r\nto go alone to towns where she was unknown to arrange for meetings on\r\nthe unpopular subject of woman's rights. Not knowing how she would be\r\nreceived, she found it almost as difficult to return to such towns as\r\nCanajoharie where she had been highly respected as a teacher six years\r\nbefore. In Canajoharie, however, she was greeted affectionately by her\r\nuncle Joshua Read. He and his friends let her use the Methodist church\r\nfor her lecture, and when the trustees of the academy urged her to\r\nreturn there to teach, Uncle Joshua interrupted with a vehement \"No!\"\r\nprotesting that others could teach but it was Susan's work \"to go\r\naround and set people thinking about the laws.\"[54]\r\n\r\nReturning to the scene of her girlhood in Battenville and Easton,\r\nvisiting her sisters Guelma and Hannah, and meeting many of her old\r\nfriends, Susan realized as never before how completely she had\r\noutgrown her old environment. In her enthusiasm for her new work, she\r\nexposed \"many of her heresies,\" and when her friends labeled William\r\nLloyd Garrison an agnostic and rabble rouser, she protested that he\r\nwas the most Christlike man she had ever known. \"Thus it is belief,\r\nnot Christian benevolence,\" she confided to her diary in 1854, \"that\r\nis made the modern test of Christianity.\"[55]\r\n\r\nAfter eight strenuous months away from home, she was welcomed warmly\r\nby a family who believed in her work. She found abolition uppermost in\r\neveryone's mind. Her brother Merritt, fired by Daniel's tales of the\r\nWest and the antislavery struggle in Kansas, was impatient to join the\r\nsettlers there and could talk of nothing else. While he poured out the\r\nlatest news about Kansas, he and a cousin Mary Luther helped Susan\r\nfold handbills for future woman's rights meetings. Susan listened\r\neagerly and approvingly as he told of the 750 free-state settlers who\r\nduring the past summer had gone out to Kansas, traveling up the\r\nMissouri on steamboats and over lonely trails in wagons marked\r\n\"Kansas.\" Most of them were not abolitionists but men who wanted\r\nKansas a free-labor state which they could develop with their own hard\r\nwork. She heard of the ruthless treatment these \"Yankee\" settlers\r\nfaced from the proslavery Missourians who wanted Kansas in the slavery\r\nbloc. There was bloodshed and there would be more. John Brown's sons\r\nhad written from Kansas, \"Send us guns. We need them more than\r\nbread.\"[56] Merritt was ready and eager to join John Brown.\r\n\r\nThe Anthony farm was virtually a hotbed of insurrection with Merritt\r\nplanning resistance in Kansas and Susan reform in New York. Susan\r\nmapped out an ambitious itinerary, hoping to canvass with her\r\npetitions every county in the state. With her father as security, she\r\nborrowed money to print her handbills and notices, and then wrote\r\nWendell Phillips asking if any money for a woman's rights campaign had\r\nbeen raised by the last national convention. He replied with his own\r\npersonal check for fifty dollars. His generosity and confidence\r\ntouched her deeply, for already he had become a hero to her second\r\nonly to William Lloyd Garrison. This tall handsome intellectual, a\r\ngraduate of Harvard and an unsurpassed orator, had forfeited friends,\r\nsocial position, and a promising career as a lawyer to plead for the\r\nslave. He was also one of the very few men who sympathized with and\r\naided the woman's rights cause.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley too proved at this time to be a good friend, writing,\r\n\"I have your letter and your programme, friend Susan. I will publish\r\nthe latter in all our editions, but return your dollars.\"[57]\r\n\r\nHer earnestness and ability made a great appeal to these men. They\r\nmarveled at her industry. Thirty-four years old now, not handsome but\r\nwholesome, simply and neatly dressed, her brown hair smoothly parted\r\nand brought down over her ears, she had nothing of the scatterbrained\r\nimpulsive reformer about her, and no coquetry. She was practical and\r\nintelligent, and men liked to discuss their work with her. William\r\nHenry Channing, admiring her executive ability and her plucky reaction\r\nto defeat, dubbed her the Napoleon of the woman's rights movement.\r\nParker Pillsbury, the fiery abolitionist from New Hampshire,\r\nbroad-shouldered, dark-bearded, with blazing eyes and almost fanatical\r\nzeal, had become her devoted friend. He liked nothing better than to\r\ntease her about her idleness and pretend to be in search of more work\r\nfor her to do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo impatient was Susan to begin her New York State campaign that she\r\nleft home on Christmas Day to hold her first meeting on December 26,\r\n1854, at Mayville in Chatauqua County. The weather was cold and damp,\r\nbut the four pounds of candles which she had bought to light the court\r\nhouse flickered cheerily while the small curious audience, gathered\r\nfrom several nearby towns, listened to the first woman most of them\r\nhad ever heard speak in public. She would be, they reckoned, worth\r\nhearing at least once.\r\n\r\nTraveling from town to town, she held meetings every other night.\r\nUsually the postmasters or sheriffs posted her notices in the town\r\nsquare and gave them to the newspapers and to the ministers to\r\nannounce in their churches. Even in a hostile community she almost\r\nalways found a gallant fair-minded man to come to her aid, such as the\r\nhotel proprietor who offered his dining room for her meetings when\r\nthe court house, schoolhouse, and churches were closed to her, or the\r\ngroup of men who, when the ministers refused to announce her meetings,\r\nstruck off handbills which they distributed at the church doors at the\r\nclose of the services. The newspapers too were generally friendly.\r\n\r\nAs men were the voters with power to change the laws, she aimed to\r\nattract them to her evening meetings, and usually they came, seeking\r\ndiversion, and listened respectfully. Some of them scoffed, others\r\ncondemned her for undermining the home, but many found her reasoning\r\nlogical and by their questions put life into the meetings. A few even\r\nencouraged their wives to enlist in the cause.\r\n\r\nThe women, on the other hand, were timid or indifferent, although she\r\npointed out to them the way to win the legal right to their earnings\r\nand their children. It was difficult to find among them a rebellious\r\nspirit brave enough to head a woman's rights society.\r\n\r\n\"Susan B. Anthony is in town,\" wrote young Caroline Cowles, a\r\nCanandaigua school girl, in her diary at this time. \"She made a\r\nspecial request that all seminary girls should come to hear her as\r\nwell as all the women and girls in town. She had a large audience and\r\nshe talked very plainly about our rights and how we ought to stand up\r\nfor them and said the world would never go right until the women had\r\njust as much right to vote and rule as the men.... When I told\r\nGrandmother about it, she said she guessed Susan B. Anthony had\r\nforgotten that St. Paul said women should keep silence. I told her,\r\nno, she didn't, for she spoke particularly about St. Paul and said if\r\nhe had lived in these times ... he would have been as anxious to have\r\nwomen at the head of the government as she was. I could not make\r\nGrandmother agree with her at all.\"[58]\r\n\r\nMany of the towns Susan visited were not on a railroad. Often after a\r\nlong cold sleigh ride she slept in a hotel room without a fire; in the\r\nmorning she might have to break the ice in the pitcher to take the\r\ncold sponge bath which nothing could induce her to omit since she had\r\nbegun to follow the water cure, a new therapeutic method then in\r\nvogue.\r\n\r\nFor a time Ernestine Rose came to her aid and it was a relief to turn\r\nover the meetings to such an accomplished speaker. But for the most\r\npart Susan braved it alone. Steadily adding names to her petitions\r\nand leaving behind the leaflets which Elizabeth Stanton had written,\r\nshe aroused a glimmer of interest in a new valuation of women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parker Pillsbury]\r\n\r\nOn the stagecoach leaving Lake George on a particularly cold day, she\r\nfound to her surprise a wealthy Quaker, whom she had met at the Albany\r\nconvention, so solicitous of her comfort that he placed heated planks\r\nunder her feet, making the long ride much more bearable. He turned up\r\nagain, this time with his own sleigh, at the close of one of her\r\nmeetings in northern New York, and wrapped in fur robes, she drove\r\nwith him behind spirited gray horses to his sisters' home to stay over\r\nSunday, and then to all her meetings in the neighborhood. It was\r\npleasant to be looked after and to travel in comfort and she enjoyed\r\nhis company, but when he urged her to give up the hard life of a\r\nreformer to become his wife, there was no hesitation on her part. She\r\nhad dedicated her life to freeing women and Negroes and there could be\r\nno turning aside. If she ever married, it must be to a man who would\r\nencourage her work for humanity, a great man like Wendell Phillips, or\r\na reformer like Parker Pillsbury.\r\n\r\nReturning home in May 1855, she took stock of her accomplishments. She\r\nhad canvassed fifty-four counties and sold 20,000 tracts. Her expenses\r\nhad been $2,291 and she had paid her way by selling tracts and by a\r\nsmall admission charge for her meetings. She even had seventy dollars\r\nover and above all expenses. She promptly repaid the fifty dollars\r\nwhich Wendell Phillips had advanced, but he returned it for her next\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nHowever, her heart quailed at the prospect of another such winter, as\r\nshe recalled the long, bitter-cold days of travel and the indifference\r\nof the women she was trying to help. Even the unfailing praise of her\r\nfamily and of Elizabeth Stanton, even the kindness and interest of the\r\nnew friends she made paled into insignificance before the thought of\r\nanother lone crusade. She was exhausted and suffering with rheumatic\r\npains, and yet she would not rest, but prepared for an ambitious\r\nconvention at Saratoga Springs, then the fashionable summer resort of\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nShe had braved this center of fashion and frivolity the year before\r\nwith her message of woman's rights, and to her great surprise, crowds\r\nseeking entertainment had come to her meetings, their admission fees\r\nand their purchase of tracts making the venture a financial success.\r\nHere was fertile ground. Susan was counting on Lucy Stone and\r\nAntoinette Brown to help her, for Elizabeth Stanton, then expecting\r\nher sixth baby, was out of the picture. Now, to her dismay, Lucy and\r\nAntoinette married the Blackwell brothers, Henry and Samuel.\r\n\r\nFearing that they too like Elizabeth Stanton would be tied down with\r\nbabies and household cares, Susan saw a bleak lonely road ahead for\r\nthe woman's rights movement. She did so want her best speakers and\r\nmost valuable workers to remain single until the spade work for\r\nwoman's rights was done. Almost in a panic at the prospect of being\r\nleft to carry on the Saratoga convention alone, Susan wrote Lucy\r\nirritable letters instead of praising her for drawing up a marriage\r\ncontract and keeping her own name. Later, however, she realized what\r\nit had meant for Lucy to keep her own name, and then she wrote her, \"I\r\nam more and more rejoiced that you have declared by actual doing that\r\na woman has a name and may retain it all through her life.\"[59]\r\n\r\nSo persistently did she now pursue Lucy and Antoinette that they both\r\nkept their promise to speak at the Saratoga convention, Lucy traveling\r\nall the way from Cincinnati where she was visiting in the Blackwell\r\nhome. Lucy was loudly cheered by a large audience, eager to see this\r\nyoung woman whose marriage had attracted so much notice in the press.\r\nIn fact Lucy Stone, who had kept her own name and who with her husband\r\nhad signed a marriage protest against the legal disabilities of a\r\nmarried woman, was as much of a novelty in this fashionable circle as\r\none of Barnum's high-priced curiosities.\r\n\r\nPleased at Lucy's reception, Susan surveyed the audience\r\nhopefully--handsome men in nankeen trousers, red waistcoats, white\r\nneckcloths, and gray swallowtail coats, sitting beside beautiful young\r\nwomen wearing gowns of bombazine and watered silk with wide hoop\r\nskirts and elaborately trimmed bonnets which set off their curls. To\r\nher delight, they also applauded Antoinette Brown Blackwell, the first\r\nwoman minister they had ever seen, and Ernestine Rose with her\r\nappealing foreign accent. They clapped loudly when she herself asked\r\nthem to buy tracts and contribute to the work.\r\n\r\nComplimentary as this was, she did not flatter herself that they had\r\nendorsed woman's rights. That they had come to her meetings in large\r\nnumbers while vacationing in Saratoga Springs, this was important. In\r\nsome a spark of understanding glowed, and this spark would light\r\nothers. They came from the South, from the West, and from the large\r\ncities of the East. There were railroad magnates among them, rich\r\nmerchants, manufacturers, and politicians. Charles F. Hovey, the\r\nwealthy Boston dry-goods merchant, listened attentively to every word,\r\nand in the years that followed became a generous contributor to the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRealizing how very tired she was and that she must feel more\r\nphysically fit before continuing her work, Susan decided to take the\r\nwater cure at her cousin Seth Rogers' Hydropathic Institute in\r\nWorcester, Massachusetts. This well-known sanitorium prescribed water\r\ninternally and externally as a remedy for all kinds of ailments, and\r\nin an age when meals were overhearty, baths infrequent, and clothing\r\ntight and confining, the drinking of water, tub baths, showers, and\r\nwet packs had enthusiastic advocates. The soothing baths relaxed\r\nSusan and the leisure to read refreshed and strengthened her. She\r\nread, one after another, Carlyle's _Sartor Resartus_, George Sand's\r\n_Consuelo_, Madame de Stael's _Corinne_, then Frances Wright's _A Few\r\nDays in Athens_ and Mrs. Gaskell's _Life of Charlotte Brontë_, making\r\nnotes in her diary (1855) of passages she particularly liked. She\r\ndiscussed current events with her cousin Seth on long drives in the\r\ncountry, finding him a delightful companion, well-read, understanding,\r\nand interested in people and causes. He took her to her first\r\npolitical meeting, where she was the only woman present and had a seat\r\non the platform. It was one of the first rallies of the new Republican\r\nparty which had developed among rebellious northern Whigs,\r\nFree-Soilers, and anti-Nebraska Democrats who opposed the extension of\r\nslavery. After listening to the speakers, among them Charles Sumner,\r\nshe drew these conclusions: \"Had the accident of birth given me place\r\namong the aristocracy of sex, I doubt not I should be an active,\r\nzealous advocate of Republicanism; unless perchance, I had received\r\nthat higher, holier light which would have lifted me to the sublime\r\nheight where now stand Garrison, Phillips, and all that small band\r\nwhose motto is 'No Union with Slaveholders.'\"[60]\r\n\r\nAfter listening to the satisfying sermons of Thomas Wentworth\r\nHigginson at his Free Church in Worcester, she wrote in her diary, \"It\r\nis plain to me now that it is not sitting under preaching I dislike,\r\nbut the fact that most of it is not of a stamp that my soul can\r\nrespond to.\"[61]\r\n\r\nIn September she interrupted \"the cure\" to attend a woman's rights\r\nmeeting in Boston, and with Lucy Stone, Antoinette and Ellen Blackwell\r\nvisited in the home of the wealthy merchant, Francis Jackson, making\r\nmany new friends, among them his daughter, Eliza J. Eddy, whose\r\nunhappy marriage was to prove a blessing to the woman's rights\r\ncause.[62]\r\n\r\nAt tea at the Garrisons', she met many of the \"distinguished\" men and\r\nwomen she had \"worshiped\" from afar. She heard Theodore Parker preach\r\na sermon which filled her soul, and with Mr. Garrison called on him in\r\nhis famous library. \"It really seemed audacious in me to be ushered\r\ninto such a presence and on such a commonplace errand as to ask him to\r\ncome to Rochester to speak in a course of lectures I am planning,\" she\r\nwrote her family, \"but he received me with such kindness and\r\nsimplicity that the awe I felt on entering was soon dissipated. I then\r\ncalled on Wendell Phillips in his sanctum for the same purpose. I have\r\ninvited Ralph Waldo Emerson by letter and all three have promised to\r\ncome. In the evening with Mr. Jackson's son James, Ellen Blackwell and\r\nI went to see _Hamlet_. In spite of my Quaker training, I find I enjoy\r\nall these worldly amusements intensely.\"[63]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn January 1856, Susan set out again on a woman's rights tour of New\r\nYork State to gather more signatures for her petitions. This time she\r\npersuaded Frances D. Gage of Ohio, a temperance worker and popular\r\nauthor of children's stories, to join her. An easy extemporaneous\r\nspeaker, Mrs. Gage was an attraction to offer audiences, who drove\r\neight or more miles to hear her; and in the cheerless hotels at night\r\nand on the long cold sleigh rides from town to town, she was a\r\ncongenial companion.\r\n\r\nThe winter was even colder and snowier than that of the year before.\r\n\"No trains running,\" Susan wrote her family, \"and we had a 36-mile\r\nride in a sleigh.... Just emerged from a long line of snow drifts and\r\nstopped at this little country tavern, supped, and am now roasting\r\nover the hot stove.\"[64]\r\n\r\nConfronted almost daily with glaring examples of the injustices women\r\nsuffered under the property laws, she was more than ever convinced\r\nthat her work was worth-while. \"We stopped at a little tavern where\r\nthe landlady was not yet twenty and had a baby, fifteen months old,\"\r\nshe reported. \"Her supper dishes were not washed and her baby was\r\ncrying.... She rocked the little thing to sleep, washed the dishes and\r\ngot our supper; beautiful white bread, butter, cheese, pickles, apple\r\nand mince pie, and excellent peach preserves. She gave us her warm\r\nroom to sleep in.... She prepared a six o'clock breakfast for us,\r\nfried pork, mashed potatoes, mince pie, and for me at my special\r\nrequest, a plate of sweet baked apples and a pitcher of rich milk....\r\nWhen we came to pay our bill, the dolt of a husband took the money and\r\nput it in his pocket. He had not lifted a finger to lighten that\r\nwoman's burdens.... Yet the law gives him the right to every dollar\r\nshe earns, and when she needs two cents to buy a darning needle she\r\nhas to ask him and explain what she wants it for.\"[65]\r\n\r\nWhen after a few weeks Mrs. Gage was called home by illness in her\r\nfamily, Susan appealed hopefully to Lucretia Mott's sister, Martha C.\r\nWright, in Auburn, New York, \"You can speak so much better, so much\r\nmore wisely, so much more everything than I can.\" Then she added, \"I\r\nshould like a particular effort made to call out the Teachers, the\r\nSewing Women, the Working Women generally--Can't you write something\r\nfor your papers that will make them feel that it is for them that we\r\nwork more than [for] the wives and daughters of the rich?\"[66] Mrs.\r\nWright, however, could help only in Auburn, and Susan was obliged to\r\ncontinue her scheduled meetings alone. She interrupted them only to\r\npresent her petitions to the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe response of the legislature to her two years of hard work was a\r\nsarcastic, wholly irrelevant report issued by the judiciary committee\r\nsome weeks later to a Senate roaring with laughter. In the Albany\r\n_Register_ Susan read with mounting indignation portions of this\r\ninfuriating report: \"The ladies always have the best places and the\r\nchoicest tidbit at the table. They have the best seats in cars,\r\ncarriages, and sleighs; the warmest place in winter, the coolest in\r\nsummer. They have their choice on which side of the bed they will lie,\r\nfront or back. A lady's dress costs three times as much as that of a\r\ngentleman; and at the present time, with the prevailing fashion, one\r\nlady occupies three times as much space in the world as a gentleman.\r\nIt has thus appeared to the married gentlemen of your committee, being\r\na majority ... that if there is any inequality or oppression in the\r\ncase, the gentlemen are the sufferers. They, however, have presented\r\nno petitions for redress, having doubtless made up their minds to\r\nyield to an inevitable destiny.\"[67]\r\n\r\nWhy, Susan wondered sadly, were woman's rights only a joke to most\r\nmen--something to be laughed at even in the face of glaring proofs of\r\nthe law's injustice.\r\n\r\nThere was encouragement, however, in the letters which now came from\r\nLucy Stone in Ohio: \"Hurrah Susan! Last week this State Legislature\r\npassed a law giving wives equal property rights, and to mothers equal\r\nbaby rights with fathers. So much is gained. The petitions which I set\r\non foot in Wisconsin for suffrage have been presented, made a rousing\r\ndiscussion, and then were tabled with three men to defend them!... In\r\nNebraska too, the bill for suffrage passed the House.... The world\r\nmoves!\"[68]\r\n\r\nThe world was moving in Great Britain as well, for as Susan read in\r\nher newspaper, women there were petitioning Parliament for married\r\nwomen's property rights, and among the petitioners were her\r\nwell-beloved Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Harriet Martineau, Mrs.\r\nGaskell, and Charlotte Cushman. Better still, Harriet Taylor, inspired\r\nby the example of woman's rights conventions in America, had written\r\nfor the _Westminster Review_ an article advocating the enfranchisement\r\nof women.\r\n\r\nAll this reassured Susan, even if New York legislators laughed at her\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] Judge William Hay of Saratoga Springs, New York.\r\n\r\n[44] Feb. 19, 1854, Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers, Library of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n[45] Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 116.

Well aware of his eagerness to help John\r\nBrown, she knew that he must be in the thick of the bloody antislavery\r\nstruggle. In fact the whole Anthony family had been anxiously waiting\r\nfor news from Merritt ever since the wires had flashed word in May\r\n1856 of the burning of Lawrence by proslavery \"border ruffians\" from\r\nMissouri and of John Brown's raid in retaliation at Pottawatomie\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nMerritt had built a log cabin at Osawatomie. While Susan was at home\r\nin September, the newspapers reported an attack by proslavery men on\r\nOsawatomie in which thirty out of fifty settlers were killed. Was\r\nMerritt among them? Finally letters came through from him. Susan read\r\nand reread them, assuring herself of his safety. Although ill at the\r\ntime, he had been in the thick of the fight, but was unharmed. Weak\r\nfrom the exertion he had crawled back to his cabin on his hands and\r\nknees and had lain there ill and alone for several weeks.\r\n\r\nParts of Merritt's letters were published in the Rochester _Democrat_,\r\nand the city took sides in the conflict, some papers claiming that his\r\nletters were fiction. Susan wrote Merritt, \"How much rather would I\r\nhave you at my side tonight than to think of your daring and enduring\r\ngreater hardships even than our Revolutionary heroes. Words cannot\r\ntell how often we think of you or how sadly we feel that the terrible\r\ncrime of this nation against humanity is being avenged on the heads of\r\nour sons and brothers.... Father brings the _Democrat_ giving a list\r\nof killed, wounded, and missing and the name of our Merritt is not\r\ntherein, but oh! the slain are sons, brothers, and husbands of others\r\nas dearly loved and sadly mourned.\"[69]\r\n\r\nWith difficulty, she prepared for the annual woman's rights\r\nconvention, for the country was in a state of unrest not only over\r\nKansas and the whole antislavery question, but also over the\r\npresidential campaign with three candidates in the field. Even her\r\nfaithful friends Horace Greeley and Gerrit Smith now failed her,\r\nHorace Greeley writing that he could no longer publish her notices\r\nfree in the news columns of his _Tribune_, because they cast upon him\r\nthe stigma of ultraradicalism, and Gerrit Smith withholding his\r\nhitherto generous financial support because woman's rights conventions\r\nwould not press for dress reform--comfortable clothing for women\r\nsuitable for an active life, which he believed to be the foundation\r\nstone of women's emancipation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Merritt Anthony]\r\n\r\nShe watched the lively bitter presidential campaign with interest and\r\nconcern. The new Republican party was in the contest, offering its\r\nfirst presidential candidate, the colorful hero and explorer of the\r\nfar West, John C. Frémont. She had leanings toward this virile young\r\nparty which stood firmly against the extension of slavery in the\r\nterritories, and discussed its platform with Elizabeth and Henry B.\r\nStanton, both enthusiastically for \"Frémont and Freedom.\" Yet she was\r\ndistrustful of political parties, for they eventually yielded to\r\nexpediency, no matter how high their purpose at the start. Her ideal\r\nwas the Garrisonian doctrine, \"No Union with Slaveholders\" and\r\n\"Immediate Unconditional Emancipation,\" which courageously faced the\r\n\"whole question\" of slavery. There was no compromise among\r\nGarrisonians.\r\n\r\nWith the burning issue of slavery now uppermost in her mind, she began\r\nseriously to reconsider the offer she had received from the American\r\nAntislavery Society, shortly after her visit to Boston in 1855, to act\r\nas their agent in central and western New York. Unable to accept at\r\nthat time because she was committed to her woman's rights program, she\r\nhad nevertheless felt highly honored that she had been chosen. Still\r\nhesitating a little, she wrote Lucy Stone, wanting reassurance that no\r\nwoman's rights work demanded immediate attention. \"They talk of\r\nsending two companies of Lecturers into this state,\" she wrote Lucy,\r\n\"wish me to lay out the route of each one and accompany one. They seem\r\nto think me possessed of a vast amount of executive ability. I shrink\r\nfrom going into Conventions where speaking is expected of me.... I\r\nknow they want me to help about finance and that part I like and am\r\ngood for nothing else.\"[70]\r\n\r\nShe also had the farm home on her mind. With her father in the\r\ninsurance business, her brothers now both in Kansas, her sister Mary\r\nteaching in the Rochester schools and \"looking matrimonially-wise,\"\r\nand her mother at home all alone, Susan often wondered if it might not\r\nbe as much her duty to stay there to take care of her mother and\r\nfather as it would be to make a home comfortable for a husband.\r\nSometimes the quietness of such a life beckoned enticingly. But after\r\nthe disappointing November elections which put into the presidency the\r\nconservative James Buchanan, from whom only a vacillating policy on\r\nthe slavery issue could be expected, she wrote Samuel May, Jr., the\r\nsecretary of the American Antislavery Society, \"I shall be very glad\r\nif I am able to render even the most humble service to this cause.\r\nHeaven knows there is need of earnest, effective radical workers. The\r\nheart sickens over the delusions of the recent campaign and turns\r\nachingly to the unconsidered _whole question_.\"[71]\r\n\r\nHis reply came promptly, \"We put all New York into your control and\r\nwant your name to all letters and your hand in all arrangements.\"\r\n\r\nFor $10 a week and expenses, Susan now arranged antislavery meetings,\r\ndisplayed posters bearing the provocative words, \"No Union with\r\nSlaveholders,\" planned tours for a corps of speakers, among them\r\nStephen and Abby Kelley Foster, Parker Pillsbury, and two free\r\nNegroes, Charles Remond and his sister, Sarah.\r\n\r\nIn debt from her last woman's rights campaign, she could not afford a\r\nnew dress for these tours, but she dyed a dark green the merino which\r\nshe had worn so proudly in Canajoharie ten years before, bought cloth\r\nto match for a basque, and made a \"handsome suit.\" \"With my Siberian\r\nsquirrel cape, I shall be very comfortable,\" she noted in her\r\ndiary.[72]\r\n\r\nShe had met indifference and ridicule in her campaigns for woman's\r\nrights. Now she faced outright hostility, for northern businessmen had\r\nno use for abolition-mad fanatics, as they called anyone who spoke\r\nagainst slavery. Abolitionists, they believed, ruined business by\r\nstirring up trouble between the North and the South.\r\n\r\nUsually antislavery meetings turned into debates between speakers and\r\naudience, often lasting until midnight, and were charged with\r\nanimosity which might flame into violence. All of the speakers lived\r\nunder a strain, and under emotional pressure. Consequently they were\r\nnot always easy to handle. Some of them were temperamental, a bit\r\njealous of each other, and not always satisfied with the tours Susan\r\nmapped out for them. She expected of her colleagues what she herself\r\ncould endure, but they often complained and sometimes refused to\r\nfulfill their engagements.\r\n\r\nWhen no one else was at hand, she took her turn at speaking, but she\r\nwas seldom satisfied with her efforts. \"I spoke for an hour,\" she\r\nconfided to her diary, \"but my heart fails me. Can it be that my\r\nstammering tongue ever will be loosed?\"\r\n\r\nLucy Stone, who spoke with such ease, gave her advice and\r\nencouragement. \"You ought to cultivate your power of expression,\" she\r\nwrote. \"The subject is clear to you and you ought to be able to make\r\nit so to others. It is only a few years ago that Mr. Higginson told me\r\nhe could not speak, he was so much accustomed to writing, and now he\r\nis second only to Phillips. 'Go thou and do likewise.'\"[73]\r\n\r\nIn March 1857, the Supreme Court startled the country with the Dred\r\nScott decision, which not only substantiated the claim of\r\nGarrisonians that the Constitution sanctioned slavery and protected\r\nthe slaveholder, but practically swept away the Republican platform of\r\nno extention of slavery in the territories. The decision declared that\r\nthe Constitution did not apply to Negroes, since they were citizens of\r\nno state when it was adopted and therefore had not the right of\r\ncitizens to sue for freedom or to claim freedom in the territories;\r\nthat the Missouri Compromise had always been void, since Congress did\r\nnot have the right to enact a law which arbitrarily deprived citizens\r\nof their property.\r\n\r\nReading the decision word for word with dismay and pondering\r\nindignantly over the cold letter of the law, Susan found herself so\r\naroused and so full of the subject that she occasionally made a\r\nspontaneous speech, and thus gradually began to free herself from\r\nreliance on written speeches. She spoke from these notes: \"Consider\r\nthe fact of 4,000,000 slaves in a Christian and republican\r\ngovernment.... Antislavery prayers, resolutions, and speeches avail\r\nnothing without action.... Our mission is to deepen sympathy and\r\nconvert into right action: to show that the men and women of the North\r\nare slaveholders, those of the South slave-owners. The guilt rests on\r\nthe North equally with the South. Therefore our work is to rouse the\r\nsleeping consciousness of the North....[74]\r\n\r\n\"We ask you to feel as if you, yourselves, were the slaves. The\r\npolitician talks of slavery as he does of United States banks, tariff,\r\nor any other commercial question. We demand the abolition of slavery\r\nbecause the slave is a human being and because man should not hold\r\nproperty in his fellowman.... We say disobey every unjust law; the\r\npolitician says obey them and meanwhile labor constitutionally for\r\nrepeal.... We preach revolution, the politicians, reform.\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively she reaffirmed her allegiance to the doctrine, \"No Union\r\nwith Slaveholders,\" and she gloried in the courage of Garrison,\r\nPhillips, and Higginson, who had called a disunion convention,\r\ndemanding that the free states secede. It was good to be one of this\r\ndevoted band, for she sincerely believed that in the ages to come \"the\r\nprophecies of these noble men and women will be read with the same\r\nwonder and veneration as those of Isaiah and Jeremiah inspire\r\ntoday.\"[75]\r\n\r\nShe gave herself to the work with religious fervor. Even so, she could\r\nnot make her antislavery meetings self-supporting, and at the end of\r\nthe first season, after paying her speakers, she faced a deficit of\r\n$1,000. This troubled her greatly but the Antislavery Society,\r\nrecognizing her value, wrote her, \"We cheerfully pay your expenses and\r\nwant to keep you at the head of the work.\" They took note of her\r\n\"business enterprise, practical sagacity, and platform ability,\" and\r\nlooked upon the expenditure of $1,000 for the education and\r\ndevelopment of such an exceptional worker as a good investment.\r\n\r\nThis new experience was a good investment for Susan as well. She made\r\nmany new friends. She won the further respect, confidence, and good\r\nwill of men like William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Francis\r\nJackson. Her friendship with Parker Pillsbury deepened. \"I can truly\r\nsay,\" she wrote Abby Kelley Foster, \"my spirit has grown in grace and\r\nthat the experience of the past winter is worth more to me than all my\r\nTemperance and Woman's Rights labors--though the latter were the\r\nschool necessary to bring me into the Antislavery work.\"[76]\r\n\r\nOnly the crusading spirit of the \"antislavery apostles\"[77] and what\r\nto them seemed the desperate state of the nation made the hard\r\ncampaigning bearable. The animosity they faced, the cold, the poor\r\ntransportation, the long hours, and wretched food taxed the physical\r\nendurance of all of them. \"O the crimes that are committed in the\r\nkitchens of this land!\"[78] wrote Susan in her diary, as she ate heavy\r\nbread and the cake ruined with soda and drank what passed for coffee.\r\nA good cook herself, she had little patience with those who through\r\nignorance or carelessness neglected that art. Equally bad were the\r\nfood fads they had to endure when they were entertained in homes of\r\notherwise hospitable friends of the cause. Raw-food diets found many\r\ndevotees in those days, and often after long cold rides in the\r\nstagecoach, these tired hungry antislavery workers were obliged to sit\r\ndown to a supper of apples, nuts, and a baked mixture of coarse bran\r\nand water. Nor did breakfast or dinner offer anything more. Facing\r\nthese diets seemed harder for the men than for Susan. Repeatedly in\r\nsuch situations, they hurried away, leaving her to complete two-or\r\nthree-day engagements among the food cranks. How she welcomed a good\r\nbeefsteak and a pot of hot coffee at home after these long days of\r\nfasting!\r\n\r\nA night at home now was sheer bliss, and she wrote Lucy Stone, \"Here\r\nI am once more in my own Farm Home, where my weary head rests upon my\r\nown home pillows.... I had been gone _Four Months_, scarcely sleeping\r\nthe second night under the same roof.\"[79]\r\n\r\nIt was good to be with her mother again, to talk with her father when\r\nhe came home from work and with Mary who had not married after all but\r\ncontinued teaching in the Rochester schools. Guelma and her husband,\r\nAaron McLean, who had moved to Rochester, often came out to the farm\r\nwith their children.\r\n\r\nTurning for relaxation to work in the garden in the warm sun, Susan\r\nthought over the year's experience and planned for the future. \"I can\r\nbut acknowledge to myself that Antislavery has made me richer and\r\nbraver in spirit,\" she wrote Samuel May, Jr., \"and that it is the\r\nschool of schools for the true and full development of the nobler\r\nelements of life. I find my raspberry field looking finely--also my\r\nstrawberry bed. The prospect for peaches, cherries, plums, apples, and\r\npears is very promising--Indeed all nature is clothed in her most\r\nhopeful dress. It really seems to me that the trees and the grass and\r\nthe large fields of waving grain did never look so beautifully as now.\r\nIt is more probable, however, that my soul has grown to appreciate\r\nNature more fully....\"[80]\r\n\r\nSusan needed that growth of soul to face the events of the next few\r\nyears and do the work which lay ahead. The whole country was tense\r\nover the slavery issue, which could no longer be pushed into the\r\nbackground. On public platforms and at every fireside, men and women\r\nwere discussing the subject. Antislavery workers sensed the gravity of\r\nthe situation and felt the onrush of the impending conflict between\r\nwhat they regarded as the forces of good and evil--freedom and\r\nslavery. When the Republican leader, William H. Seward, spoke in\r\nRochester, of \"an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring\r\nforces,\"[81] he was expressing only what Garrisonian abolitionists,\r\nlike Susan, always had recognized. In the West, a tall awkward country\r\nlawyer, Abraham Lincoln, debating with the suave Stephen A. Douglas,\r\ndeclared with prophetic wisdom, \"'A house divided against itself\r\ncannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure permanently\r\nhalf slave and half free.... It will become all one thing or all the\r\nother.'\"[82]\r\n\r\nSo Susan believed, and she was doing her best to make it all free.\r\nNot only was she holding antislavery meetings, making speeches, and\r\ndistributing leaflets whenever and wherever possible, but she was also\r\nlobbying in Albany for a personal liberty bill to protect the slaves\r\nwho were escaping from the South. \"Treason in the Capitol,\" the\r\nDemocratic press labeled efforts for a personal liberty bill, and as\r\nSusan reported to William Lloyd Garrison,[83] even Republicans shied\r\naway from it, many of them regarding Seward's \"irrepressible conflict\"\r\nspeech a sorry mistake. Such timidity and shilly-shallying were\r\nrepugnant to her. She could better understand the fervor of John Brown\r\nalthough he fought with bullets.\r\n\r\nYet John Brown's fervor soon ended in tragedy, sowing seeds of fear,\r\ndistrust, and bitter partisanship in all parts of the country. When,\r\nin October 1859, the startling news reached Susan of the raid on\r\nHarper's Ferry and the capture of John Brown, she sadly tried to piece\r\ntogether the story of his failure. She admired and respected John\r\nBrown, believing he had saved Kansas for freedom. That he had further\r\nambitious plans was common knowledge among antislavery workers, for he\r\nhad talked them over with Gerrit Smith, Frederick Douglass, and the\r\nthree young militants, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Frank Sanborn, and\r\nSamuel Gridley Howe. Somehow these plans had failed, but she was sure\r\nthat his motives were good. He was imprisoned, accused of treason and\r\nmurder, and in his carpetbag were papers which, it was said,\r\nimplicated prominent antislavery workers. Now his friends were fleeing\r\nthe country, Sanborn, Douglass, and Howe. Gerrit Smith broke down so\r\ncompletely that for a time his mind was affected. Thomas Wentworth\r\nHigginson, defiant and unafraid, stuck by John Brown to the end,\r\nbefriending his family, hoping to rescue him as he had rescued\r\nfugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nScanning the _Liberator_ for its comment on John Brown, Susan found it\r\ncolored, as she had expected, by Garrison's instinctive opposition to\r\nall war and bloodshed. He called the raid \"a misguided, wild,\r\napparently insane though disinterested and well-intentioned effort by\r\ninsurrection to emancipate the slaves of Virginia,\" but even he added,\r\n\"Let no one who glories in the Revolutionary struggle of 1776 deny the\r\nright of the slaves to imitate the example of our fathers.\"[84]\r\n\r\nBehind closed doors and in public meetings, abolitionists pledged\r\ntheir allegiance to John Brown's noble purpose. He had wanted no\r\nbloodshed, they said, had no thought of stirring up slaves to brutal\r\nrevenge. The raid was to be merely a signal for slaves to arise, to\r\ncast off slavery forever, to follow him to a mountain refuge, which\r\nother slave insurrections would reinforce until all slaves were free.\r\nTo him the plan seemed logical and he was convinced it was\r\nGod-inspired. To some of his friends it seemed possible--just a step\r\nbeyond the Underground Railroad and hiding fugitive slaves. To Susan\r\nhe was a hero and a martyr.\r\n\r\nSoutherners, increasingly fearful of slave insurrections, called John\r\nBrown a cold-blooded murderer and accused Republicans--\"black\r\nRepublicans,\" they classed them--of taking orders from abolitionists\r\nand planning evil against them. To law-abiding northerners, John Brown\r\nwas a menace, stirring up lawlessness. Seward and Lincoln, speaking\r\nfor the Republicans, declared that violence, bloodshed, and treason\r\ncould not be excused even if slavery was wrong and Brown thought he\r\nwas right. All saw before them the horrible threat of civil war.\r\n\r\nDuring John Brown's trial, his friends did their utmost to save him.\r\nThe noble old giant with flowing white beard, who had always been more\r\nor less of a legend, now to them assumed heroic proportions. His\r\ncalmness, his steadfastness in what he believed to be right captured\r\nthe imagination.\r\n\r\nThe jury declared him guilty--guilty of treason, of conspiring with\r\nslaves to rebel, guilty of murder in the first degree. The papers\r\ncarried the story, and it spread by word of mouth--the story of those\r\nlast tense moments in the courtroom when John Brown declared, \"It is\r\nunjust that I should suffer such a penalty. Had I interferred ... in\r\nbehalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called\r\ngreat, or in behalf of any of their friends ... it would have been all\r\nright.... I say I am yet too young to understand that God is any\r\nrespecter of persons. I believe that to have interferred as I have\r\ndone, in behalf of His despised poor, I did no wrong but right. Now if\r\nit is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the\r\nfurtherance of the ends of justice and mingle my blood further with\r\nthe blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave\r\ncountry whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust\r\nenactments, I say, let it be done....\"[85]\r\n\r\nHe was sentenced to die.\r\n\r\nSusan, sick at heart, talked all this over with her abolitionist\r\nfriends and began planning a meeting of protest and mourning in\r\nRochester if John Brown were hanged. She engaged the city's most\r\npopular hall for this meeting, never thinking of the animosity she\r\nmight arouse, and as she went from door to door selling tickets, she\r\nasked for contributions for John Brown's destitute family. She tried\r\nto get speakers from among respected Republicans to widen the popular\r\nappeal of the meeting, but her diary records, \"Not one man of\r\nprominence in religion or politics will identify himself with the John\r\nBrown meeting.\"[86] Only a Free Church minister, the Rev. Abram Pryn,\r\nand the ever-faithful Parker Pillsbury were willing to speak.\r\n\r\nThere was still hope that John Brown might be saved and excitement ran\r\nhigh. Some like Higginson, unwilling to let him die, wanted to rescue\r\nhim, but Brown forbade it. Others wanted to kidnap Governor Wise of\r\nVirginia and hold him on the high seas, a hostage for John Brown.\r\nWendell Phillips was one of these. Parker Pillsbury, sending Susan the\r\nlatest news from \"the seat of war\" and signing his letter, \"Faithfully\r\nand fervently yours,\" wrote, \"My voice is against any attempt at\r\nrescue. It would inevitably, I fear, lead to bloodshed which could not\r\ncompensate nor be compensated. If the people dare murder their victim,\r\nas they are determined to do, and in the name of the law ... the moral\r\neffect of the execution will be without a parallel since the scenes on\r\nCalvary eighteen hundred years ago, and the halter that day sanctified\r\nshall be the cord to draw millions to salvation.\"[87]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, December 2, 1859, John Brown was hanged. Through the North,\r\nchurch bells tolled and prayers were said for him. Everywhere people\r\ngathered together to mourn and honor or to condemn. In New York City,\r\nat a big meeting which overflowed to the streets, it was resolved\r\n\"that we regard the recent outrage at Harper's Ferry as a crime, not\r\nonly against the State of Virginia, but against the Union itself....\"\r\nIn Boston, however, Ralph Waldo Emerson spoke to a tremendous audience\r\nof \"the new saint, than whom none purer or more brave was ever led by\r\nlove of man into conflict and death ... who will make the gallows\r\nglorious,\" and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow recorded in his diary, \"This\r\nwill be a great day in our history; the date of a new revolution.\" Far\r\naway in France, Victor Hugo declared, \"The eyes of Europe are fixed on\r\nAmerica. The hanging of John Brown will open a latent fissure that\r\nwill finally split the union asunder.... You preserve your shame, but\r\nyou kill your glory.\"[88]\r\n\r\nIn Rochester, three hundred people assembled. All were friends of the\r\ncause and there was no unfriendly disturbance to mar the proceedings.\r\nSusan presided and Parker Pillsbury, in her opinion, made \"the\r\ngrandest speech of his life,\" for it was the only occasion he ever\r\nfound fully wicked enough to warrant \"his terrific invective.\"[89]\r\n\r\nThus these two militant abolitionists, Susan B. Anthony and Parker\r\nPillsbury, joined hundreds of others throughout the nation in honoring\r\nJohn Brown, sensing the portent of his martyrdom and prophesying that\r\nhis soul would go marching on.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[69] Harper, _Anthony_, I, pp. 144-145.

Anthony Scrapbook, Library of Congress. In 1890, after\r\nvisiting the John Brown Memorial at North Elbe, New York, Susan B.\r\nAnthony wrote: \"John Brown was crucified for doing what he believed\r\nGod commanded him to do, 'to break the yoke and let the oppressed go\r\nfree,' precisely as were the saints of old for following what they\r\nbelieved to be God's commands. The barbarism of our government was by\r\nso much the greater as our light and knowledge are greater than those\r\nof two thousand years ago.\" Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 708.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan's preoccupation with antislavery work did not lessen her\r\ninterest in women's advancement. Her own expanding courage and ability\r\nshowed her the possibilities for all women in widened horizons and\r\nactivities. These possibilities were the chief topic of conversation\r\nwhen she and Elizabeth Stanton were together. With Mrs. Stanton's\r\nyoung daughters, Margaret and Harriot, in mind, they were continually\r\nplanning ways and means of developing the new woman, or the \"true\r\nwoman\" as they liked to call her; and one of these ways was physical\r\nexercise in the fresh air, which was almost unheard of for women\r\nexcept on the frontier.\r\n\r\nTaking off her hoops and working in the garden in the freedom of her\r\nlong calico dress, Susan was refreshed and exhilarated. \"Uncovered the\r\nstrawberry and raspberry beds ...\" her diary records. \"Worked with\r\nSimon building frames for the grapevines in the peach orchards.... Set\r\nout 18 English black currants, 22 English gooseberries and Muscatine\r\ngrape vines.... Finished setting out the apple trees & 600 blackberry\r\nbushes....\"[90]\r\n\r\nShe knew how little this strengthening work and healing influence\r\ntouched the lives of most women. Hemmed in by the walls of their\r\nhomes, weighed down by bulky confining clothing, fed on the tradition\r\nof weakness, women could never gain the breadth of view, courage, and\r\nstamina needed to demand and appreciate emancipation. She thought a\r\ngreat deal about this and how it could be remedied, and wrote her\r\nfriend, Thomas Wentworth Higginson \"The salvation of the race depends,\r\nin a great measure, upon rescuing women from their hot-house\r\nexistence. Whether in kitchen, nursery or parlor, all alike are shut\r\naway from God's sunshine. Why did not your Caroline Plummer of Salem,\r\nwhy do not all of our wealthy women leave money for industrial and\r\nagricultural schools for girls, instead of ever and always providing\r\nfor boys alone?\"[91]\r\n\r\nAn exceptional opportunity was now offered Susan--to speak on the\r\ncontroversial subject of coeducation before the State Teachers'\r\nAssociation, which only a few years before had been shocked by the\r\nsound of a woman's voice. Deeply concerned over her ability to write\r\nthe speech, she at once appealed to Elizabeth Stanton, \"Do you please\r\nmark out a plan and give me as soon as you can....\"[92]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony, 1856]\r\n\r\nBusy with preparations for woman's rights meetings in popular New York\r\nsummer resorts, Saratoga Springs, Lake George, Clifton Springs, and\r\nAvon, she grew panicky at the prospect of her impending speech and\r\ndashed off another urgent letter to Mrs. Stanton, underlining it\r\nvigorously for emphasis: \"Not a _word written_ ... and mercy only\r\nknows when I can get a moment, and what is _worse_, as the _Lord knows\r\nfull well_, is, that if _I get all the time the world has--I can't get\r\nup a decent document_.... It is of but small moment who writes the\r\nAddress, but of _vast moment_ that it be _well done_.... No woman but\r\nyou can write from _my standpoint_ for all would base their strongest\r\n_argument_ on the _un_likeness of the _sexes_....\r\n\r\n\"Those of you who have the _talent_ to do honor to poor, oh how poor\r\nwomanhood have all given yourselves over to _baby_-making and left\r\npoor brainless _me_ to battle alone. It is a shame. Such a lady as _I\r\nmight_ be _spared_ to _rock cradles_, but it is a crime for _you_ and\r\n_Lucy_ and _Nette_.\"[93]\r\n\r\nOn a separate page she outlined for Mrs. Stanton the points she wanted\r\nto make. Her title was affirmative, \"Why the Sexes Should be Educated\r\nTogether.\" \"Because,\" she reasoned, \"by such education they get true\r\nideas of each other.... Because the endowment of both public and\r\nprivate funds is ever for those of the male sex, while all the\r\nSeminaries and Boarding Schools for Females are left to\r\nmaintain themselves as best they may by means of their tuition\r\nfees--consequently cannot afford a faculty of first-class\r\nprofessors.... Not a school in the country gives to the girl equal\r\nprivileges with the boy.... No school _requires_ and but very few\r\nallow the _girls_ to declaim and discuss side by side with the boys.\r\nThus they are robbed of half of education. The grand thing that is\r\nneeded is to give the sexes _like motives_ for acquirement. Very\r\nrarely a person studies closely, without hope of making that knowledge\r\nuseful, as a means of support....\"[94]\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton wrote her at once, \"Come here and I will do what I can to\r\nhelp you with your address, if you will hold the baby and make the\r\npuddings.\"[95] Gratefully Susan hurried to Seneca Falls and together\r\nthey \"loaded her gun,\" not only for the teachers' convention but for\r\nall the summer meetings.\r\n\r\nAddressing the large teachers' meeting in Troy, Susan declared that\r\nmental sex-differences did not exist. She called attention to the\r\never-increasing variety of occupations which women were carrying on\r\nwith efficiency. There were women typesetters, editors, publishers,\r\nauthors, clerks, engravers, watchmakers, bookkeepers, sculptors,\r\npainters, farmers, and machinists. Two hundred and fifty women were\r\nserving as postmasters. Girls, she insisted, must be educated to earn\r\na living and more vocations must be opened to them as an incentive to\r\nstudy. \"A woman,\" she added, \"needs no particular kind of education to\r\nbe a wife and mother anymore than a man does to be a husband and\r\nfather. A man cannot make a living out of these relations. He must\r\nfill them with something more and so must women.\"[96]\r\n\r\nHer advanced ideas did not cause as much consternation as she had\r\nexpected and she was asked to repeat her speech at the Massachusetts\r\nteachers' convention; but the thoughts of many in that audience were\r\nechoed by the president when he said to her after the meeting, \"Madam,\r\nthat was a splendid production and well delivered. I could not have\r\nasked for a single thing different either in matter or manner; but I\r\nwould rather have followed my wife or daughter to Greenwood cemetery\r\nthan to have had her stand here before this promiscuous audience and\r\ndeliver that address.\"[97]\r\n\r\nIt was one thing to talk about coeducation but quite another to offer\r\na resolution putting the New York State Teachers' Association on\r\nrecord as asking all schools, colleges, and universities to open their\r\ndoors to women. This Susan did at their next convention, and while\r\nthere were enough women present to carry the resolution, most of them\r\nvoted against it, listening instead to the emotional arguments of a\r\ngroup of conservative men who prophesied that coeducation would\r\ncoarsen women and undermine marriage. Nor did she forget the Negro at\r\nthese conventions, but brought much criticism upon herself by offering\r\nresolutions protesting the exclusion of Negroes from public schools,\r\nacademies, colleges, and universities.\r\n\r\nSuch controversial activities were of course eagerly reported in the\r\npress, and Henry Stanton, reading his newspaper, pointed them out to\r\nhis wife, remarking drily, \"Well, my dear, another notice of Susan.\r\nYou stir up Susan and she stirs up the world.\"[98]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe best method of arousing women and spreading new ideas, Susan\r\ndecided, was holding woman's rights conventions, for the discussions\r\nat these conventions covered a wide field and were not limited merely\r\nto women's legal disabilities. The feminists of that day extolled\r\nfreedom of speech, and their platform, like that of antislavery\r\nconventions, was open to anyone who wished to express an opinion.\r\nAlways the limited educational opportunities offered to women were\r\npointed out, and Oberlin College and Antioch, both coeducational, were\r\nheld up as patterns for the future. Resolutions were passed, demanding\r\nthat Harvard and Yale admit women. Women's low wages and the very few\r\noccupations open to them were considered, and whether it was fitting\r\nfor women to be doctors and ministers. At one convention Lucy Stone\r\nmade the suggestion that a prize be offered for a novel on women,\r\nlike _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, to arouse the whole nation to the unjust\r\nsituation of women whose slavery, she felt, was comparable to that of\r\nthe Negro. At another, William Lloyd Garrison maintained that women\r\nhad the right to sit in the Congress and in state legislatures and\r\nthat there should be an equal number of men and women in all national\r\ncouncils. Inevitably Scriptural edicts regarding woman's sphere were\r\nthrashed out with Antoinette Brown, in her clerical capacity, setting\r\nat rest the minds of questioning women and quashing the protests of\r\nclergymen who thought they were speaking for God. Usually Ernestine\r\nRose was on hand, ready to speak when needed, injecting into the\r\ndiscussions her liberal clear-cut feminist views. Nor was the\r\ninternational aspect of the woman's rights movement forgotten. The\r\ninterest in Great Britain in the franchise for women of such men as\r\nLord Brougham and John Stuart Mill was reported as were the efforts\r\nthere among women to gain admission to the medical profession.\r\nDistributed widely as a tract was the \"admirable\" article in the\r\n_Westminster Review_, \"The Enfranchisement of Women,\" by Harriet\r\nTaylor, now Mrs. John Stuart Mill.\r\n\r\nIn New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, where\r\nstate conventions were held annually, women carried back to their\r\nhomes and their friends new and stimulating ideas. National\r\nconventions, which actually represented merely the northeastern states\r\nand Ohio and occasionally attracted men and women from Indiana,\r\nMissouri, and Kansas, were scheduled by Susan to meet every year in\r\nNew York, simultaneously with antislavery conventions. Thus she was\r\nassured of a brilliant array of speakers, for the Garrisonian\r\nabolitionists were sincere advocates of woman's rights.\r\n\r\nBoth Elizabeth Stanton and Lucy Stone were a great help to Susan in\r\npreparing for these national gatherings for which she raised the\r\nmoney. Elizabeth wrote the calls and resolutions, while Lucy could not\r\nonly be counted upon for an eloquent speech, but through her wide\r\ncontacts brought new speakers and new converts to the meetings.\r\nHowever, national woman's rights conventions would probably have\r\nlapsed completely during the troubled years prior to the Civil War,\r\nhad it not been for Susan's persistence. She was obliged to omit the\r\n1857 convention because all of her best speakers were either having\r\nbabies or were kept at home by family duties. Lucy's baby, Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, was born in September 1857, then Antoinette Brown's first\r\nchild, and Mrs. Stanton's seventh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lucy Stone and her daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell]\r\n\r\nImpatient to get on with the work, Susan chafed at the delay and when\r\nLucy wrote her, \"I shall not assume the responsibility for another\r\nconvention until I have had my ten daughters,\"[99] Susan was beside\r\nherself with apprehension. When Lucy told her that it was harder to\r\ntake care of a baby day and night than to campaign for woman's rights,\r\nshe felt that Lucy regarded as unimportant her \"common work\" of hiring\r\nhalls, engaging speakers, and raising money. This rankled, for\r\nalthough Susan realized it was work without glory, she did expect Lucy\r\nto understand its significance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton sensed the makings of a rift between Susan and these\r\nyoung mothers, Lucy and Antoinette, and knowing from her own\r\nexperience how torn a woman could be between rearing a family and work\r\nfor the cause, she pleaded with Susan to be patient with them. \"Let\r\nthem rest a while in peace and quietness, and think great thoughts for\r\nthe future,\" she wrote Susan. \"It is not well to be in the excitement\r\nof public life all the time. Do not keep stirring them up or mourning\r\nover their repose. You need rest too. Let the world alone a while. We\r\ncannot bring about a moral revolution in a day or a year.\"[100]\r\n\r\nBut Susan could not let the world alone. There was too much to be\r\ndone. In addition to her woman's rights and antislavery work, she gave\r\na helping hand to any good cause in Rochester, such as a protest\r\nmeeting against capital punishment, a series of Sunday evening\r\nlectures, or establishing a Free Church like that headed by Theodore\r\nParker in Boston where no one doctrine would be preached and all would\r\nbe welcome. There were days when weariness and discouragement hung\r\nheavily upon her. Then impatient that she alone seemed to be carrying\r\nthe burden of the whole woman's rights movement, she complained to\r\nLydia Mott, \"There is not one woman left who may be relied on. All\r\nhave first to please their husbands after which there is little time\r\nor energy left to spend in any other direction.... How soon the last\r\nstanding monuments (yourself and myself, Lydia) will lay down the\r\nindividual 'shovel and de hoe' and with proper zeal and spirit grasp\r\nthose of some masculine hand, the mercies and the spirits only know. I\r\ndeclare to you that I distrust the powers of any woman, even of myself\r\nto withstand the mighty matrimonial maelstrom!\"[101]\r\n\r\nTo Elizabeth Stanton she confessed, \"I have very weak moments and long\r\nto lay my weary head somewhere and nestle my full soul to that of\r\nanother in full sympathy. I sometimes fear that _I too_ shall faint by\r\nthe wayside and drop out of the ranks of the faithful few.\"[102]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan thought a great deal about marriage at this time, about how it\r\ninterfered with the development of women's talents and their careers,\r\nhow it usually dwarfed their individuality. Nor were these thoughts\r\nwholly impersonal, for she had attentive suitors during these years.\r\nHer diary mentions moonlight rides and adds, \"Mr.--walked home with\r\nme; marvelously attentive. What a pity such powers of intellect should\r\nlack the moral spine.\"[103] Her standards of matrimony were high, and\r\nshe carefully recorded in her diary Lucretia Mott's wise words, \"In\r\nthe true marriage relation, the independence of the husband and wife\r\nis equal, their dependence mutual, and their obligations\r\nreciprocal.\"[104]\r\n\r\nMarriage and the differences of the sexes were often discussed at the\r\nmany meetings she attended, and when remarks were made which to her\r\nseemed to limit in any way the free and full development of woman, she\r\nalways registered her protest. She had no patience with any\r\nunrealistic glossing over of sex attraction and spurned the theory\r\nthat woman expressed love and man wisdom, that these two qualities\r\nreached out for each other and blended in marriage. Because she spoke\r\nfrankly for those days and did not soften the impact of her words with\r\nsentimental flowery phrases, her remarks were sometimes called\r\n\"coarse\" and \"animal,\" but she justified them in a letter to Mrs.\r\nStanton, who thought as she did, \"To me it [sex] is not coarse or\r\ngross. If it is a fact, there it is.\"[105]\r\n\r\nShe was reading at this time Elizabeth Barrett Browning's _Aurora\r\nLeigh_, called by Ruskin the greatest poem in the English language,\r\nbut criticized by others as an indecent romance revolting to the\r\npurity of many women. Susan had bought a copy of the first American\r\nedition and she carried it with her wherever she went. After a hard\r\nactive day, she found inspiration and refreshment in its pages. No\r\nmatter how dreary the hotel room or how unfriendly the town, she no\r\nlonger felt lonely or discouraged, for Aurora Leigh was a companion\r\never at hand, giving her confidence in herself, strengthening her\r\nambition, and helping her build a satisfying, constructive philosophy\r\nof life. On the flyleaf of her worn copy, which in later years she\r\npresented to the Library of Congress, she wrote, \"This book was\r\ncarried in my satchel for years and read and reread. The noble words\r\nof Elizabeth Barrett, as Wendell Phillips always called her, sunk deep\r\ninto my heart. I have always cherished it above all other books. I now\r\npresent it to the Congressional Library with the hope that women may\r\nmore and more be like Aurora Leigh.\"\r\n\r\nThe beauty of its poetry enchanted her, and Elizabeth Barrett\r\nBrowning's feminism found an echo in her own. She pencil-marked the\r\npassages she wanted to reread. When her \"common work\" of hiring halls\r\nand engaging speakers seemed unimportant and even futile, she found\r\ncomfort in these lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Be sure no earnest work\r\n    Of any honest creature, howbeit weak\r\n    Imperfect, ill-adapted, fails so much,\r\n    It is not gathered as a grain of sand\r\n    To enlarge the sum of human action used\r\n    For carrying out God's end....\r\n    ... let us be content in work,\r\n    To do the thing we can, and not presume\r\n    To fret because it's little.\"[106]\r\n\r\nGlorying in work, she read with satisfaction:\r\n\r\n    \"The honest earnest man must stand and work:\r\n    The woman also, otherwise she drops\r\n    At once below the dignity of man,\r\n    Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work;\r\n    Who ever fears God, fears to sit at ease.\"\r\n\r\nCould she have written poetry, these words, spoken by Aurora, might\r\nwell have been her own:\r\n\r\n    \"You misconceive the question like a man,\r\n    Who sees a woman as the complement\r\n    Of his sex merely. You forget too much\r\n    That every creature, female as the male,\r\n    Stands single in responsible act and thought,\r\n    As also in birth and death. Whoever says\r\n    To a loyal woman, 'Love and work with me,'\r\n    Will get fair answers, if the work and love\r\n    Being good of themselves, are good for her--the best\r\n    She was born for.\"\r\n\r\nInspired by _Aurora Leigh_, Susan planned a new lecture, \"The True\r\nWoman,\" and as she wrote it out word for word, her thoughts and\r\ntheories about women, which had been developing through the years,\r\ncrystallized. In her opinion, the \"true woman\" could no more than\r\nAurora Leigh follow the traditional course and sacrifice all for the\r\nlove of one man, adjusting her life to his whims. She must, instead,\r\ndevelop her own personality and talents, advancing in learning, in the\r\narts, in science, and in business, cherishing at the same time her\r\nnoble womanly qualities. Susan hoped that some day the full\r\ndevelopment of woman's individuality would be compatible with\r\nmarriage, and she held up as an ideal the words which Elizabeth\r\nBarrett Browning put into the mouth of Aurora Leigh:\r\n\r\n        \"The world waits\r\n    For help. Beloved, let us work so well,\r\n    Our work shall still be better for our love\r\n    And still our love be sweeter for our work\r\n    And both, commended, for the sake of each,\r\n    By all true workers and true lovers born.\"\r\n\r\nShe expressed this hope in her own practical words to Lydia Mott:\r\n\"Institutions, among them marriage, are justly chargeable with many\r\nsocial and individual ills, but after all, the whole man or woman will\r\nrise above them. I am sure my 'true woman' will never be crushed or\r\ndwarfed by them. Woman must take to her soul a purpose and then make\r\ncircumstances conform to this purpose, instead of forever singing the\r\nrefrain, 'if and if and if.'\"[107]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLate in 1858, Susan received a letter from Wendell Phillips which put\r\nnew life into all her efforts for women. He wrote her that an\r\nanonymous donor had given him $5,000 for the woman's rights cause and\r\nthat he, Lucy Stone, and Susan had been named trustees to spend it\r\nwisely and effectively.\r\n\r\nThe man who felt that the woman's rights cause was important enough to\r\nrate a gift of that size proved to be wealthy Francis Jackson of\r\nBoston, in whose home Susan had visited a few years before with Lucy\r\nand Antoinette. Jubilant over the prospects, she at once began to make\r\nplans. She wanted to use all of the fund for lectures, conventions,\r\ntracts, and newspaper articles; Lucy thought part of the money should\r\nbe spent to prove unconstitutional the law which taxed women without\r\nrepresentation and Antoinette was eager for a share to establish a\r\nchurch in which she could preach woman's rights with the Gospel.\r\n\r\nBoth Wendell Phillips and Lucy Stone agreed that Susan should have\r\n$1,500 for the intensive campaign she had planned for New York, and\r\nfor once in her life she started off without a financial worry, with\r\nmoney in hand to pay her speakers. She held meetings in all of the\r\nprincipal towns of the state, making them at least partially pay for\r\nthemselves. Her lecturers each received $12 a week and she kept a\r\nlike amount for herself, for planning the tour, organizing the\r\nmeetings, and delivering her new lecture, \"The True Woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am having fine audiences of thinking men and women,\" she wrote Mary\r\nHallowell. \"Oh, if we could but make our meetings ring like those of\r\nthe antislavery people, wouldn't the world hear us? But to do that we\r\nmust have souls baptized into the work and consecrated to it.\"[108]\r\n\r\nSome souls were deeply stirred by the woman's rights gospel. One of\r\nthese was the wealthy Boston merchant, Charles F. Hovey, who in his\r\nwill left $50,000 in trust to Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, Parker Pillsbury, Abby Kelley Foster, and others, to be\r\nspent for the \"promotion of the antislavery cause and other reforms,\"\r\namong them woman's rights, and not less than $8,000 a year to be spent\r\nto promote these reforms. With all this financial help available,\r\nSusan expected great things to happen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1860 while the legislature was in session, Susan\r\nspent six weeks in Albany with Lydia Mott, and day after day she\r\nclimbed the long hill to the capitol to interview legislators on\r\namendments to the married women's property laws. When these amendments\r\nwere passed by the Senate, Assemblyman Anson Bingham urged her to\r\nbring their mutual friend, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, to Albany to speak\r\nbefore his committee to assure passage by the Assembly.\r\n\r\nOnce again Susan hurried to Seneca Falls, and unpacking her little\r\nportmanteau stuffed with papers and statistics, discussed the subject\r\nwith Mrs. Stanton in front of the open fire late into the night. Then\r\nthe next morning while Mrs. Stanton shut herself up in the quietest\r\nroom in the house to write her speech, Susan gave the children their\r\nbreakfast, sent the older ones off to school, watched over the babies,\r\nprepared the desserts, and made herself generally useful. By this time\r\nthe children regarded her affectionately as \"Aunt Thusan,\" and they\r\nknew they must obey her, for she was a stern disciplinarian whom even\r\nthe mischievous Stanton boys dared not defy.\r\n\r\nThese visits of Susan's were happy, satisfying times for both these\r\nyoung women. A few days' respite from travel in a well-run home with\r\na friend she admired did wonders for Susan, giving her perspective on\r\nthe work she had already done and courage to tackle new problems,\r\nwhile for Mrs. Stanton this short period of stimulating companionship\r\nand freedom from household cares was a godsend. \"Miss Anthony\" had\r\nlong ago become Susan to Elizabeth, but Susan all through her life\r\ncalled her very best friend \"Mrs. Stanton,\" playfully to be sure, but\r\nwith a remnant of that formality which it was hard for her to cast\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe speech was soon finished. Mrs. Stanton's imagination, fired by her\r\nsympathetic understanding of women's problems, had turned Susan's cold\r\nhard facts into moving prose, while Susan, the best of critics,\r\ndetected every weak argument or faltering phrase. They both felt they\r\nhad achieved a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton delivered this address before a joint session of the New\r\nYork legislature in March 1860. Susan beamed with pride as she watched\r\nthe large audience crowd even the galleries and heard the long loud\r\napplause for the speech which she was convinced could not have been\r\nsurpassed by any man in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Assembly passed the Married Women's Property Bill,\r\nand when shortly it was signed by the governor, Susan and Mrs. Stanton\r\nscored their first big victory, winning a legal revolution for the\r\nwomen of New York State. This new law was a challenge to women\r\neverywhere. Under it a married woman had the right to hold property,\r\nreal and personal, without the interference of her husband, the right\r\nto carry on any trade or perform any service on her own account and to\r\ncollect and use her own earnings; a married woman might now buy, sell,\r\nand make contracts, and if her husband had abandoned her or was\r\ninsane, a convict, or a habitual drunkard, his consent was\r\nunnecessary; a married woman might sue and be sued, she was the joint\r\nguardian with her husband of her children, and on the decease of her\r\nhusband the wife had the same rights that her husband would have at\r\nher death.\r\n\r\nSusan did not then realize the full significance of what she had\r\naccomplished--that she had unleashed a new movement for freedom which\r\nwould be the means of strengthening the democratic government of her\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] Harper, _Anthony_, I, pp. 173-174, 198.\r\n\r\n[91] _Ibid._, p. 160.\r\n\r\n[92] May 26, 1856, Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers, Vassar College\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n[93] _Ibid._, June 5, 1856.

At this convention she reported progress\r\neverywhere. Four thousand dollars from the Jackson and Hovey funds had\r\nbeen spent in the successful New York campaign, and similar work was\r\nscheduled for Ohio. In Kansas, women had won from the constitutional\r\nconvention equal rights and privileges in state-controlled schools and\r\nin the management of the public schools, including the right to vote\r\nfor members of school boards; mothers had been granted equal rights\r\nwith fathers in the control and custody of their children, and married\r\nwomen had been given property rights. In Indiana, Maine, Missouri, and\r\nOhio, married women could now control their own earnings.\r\n\r\n\"Each year we hail with pleasure,\" she continued, \"new accessions to\r\nour faith. Brave men and true from the higher walks of literature and\r\nart, from the bar, the bench, the pulpit, and legislative halls are\r\nnow ready to help woman wherever she claims to stand.\" She was\r\nthinking of the aid given her by Andrew J. Colvin and Anson Bingham of\r\nthe New York legislature, of the young journalist, George William\r\nCurtis, just recently speaking for women, of Samuel Longfellow at his\r\nfirst woman's rights convention, and of the popular Henry Ward Beecher\r\nwho, just a few months before, had delivered his great woman's rights\r\nspeech, thereby identifying himself irrevocably with the cause. She\r\nannounced with great satisfaction the news, which the papers had\r\ncarried a few days before, that Matthew Vassar of Poughkeepsie had set\r\naside $400,000 to found a college for women equal in all respects to\r\nHarvard and Yale.[109]\r\n\r\nProgress and good feeling were in the air, and the speakers were not\r\nheckled as in past years by the rowdies who had made it a practice to\r\nfollow abolitionists into woman's rights meetings to bait them. Into\r\nthis atmosphere of good will and rejoicing, Susan and Elizabeth\r\nStanton now injected a more serious note, bringing before the\r\nconvention the controversial question of marriage and divorce which\r\nheretofore had been handled with kid gloves at all woman's rights\r\nmeetings, but which they sincerely believed demanded solution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDivorce had been much in the news because several leading families in\r\nAmerica and in England were involved in lawsuits complicated by\r\nstringent divorce laws. Invariably the wife bore the burden of censure\r\nand hardship, for no matter how unprincipled her husband might be, he\r\nwas entitled to her children and her earnings under the property laws\r\nof most states.\r\n\r\nIn New York efforts were now being made to gain support for a liberal\r\ndivorce bill, patterned after the Indiana law, and a variety of\r\nproposals were before the legislature, making drunkenness, insanity,\r\ndesertion, and cruel and abusive treatment grounds for divorce. Horace\r\nGreeley in his _Tribune_ had been vigorously opposing a more liberal\r\nlaw for New York, while Robert Dale Owen of Indiana wrote in its\r\ndefense. Everywhere people were reading the Greeley-Owen debates in\r\nthe _Tribune_. Through his widely circulated paper, Horace Greeley had\r\nin a sense become an oracle for the people who felt he was safe and\r\ngood; while Robert Dale Owen, because of his youthful association with\r\nthe New Harmony community and Frances Wright, was branded with\r\nradicalism which even his valuable service in the Indiana legislature\r\nand his two terms in Congress could not blot out.\r\n\r\nSusan and Mrs. Stanton had no patience with Horace Greeley's smug\r\nold-fashioned opinions on marriage and divorce. In fact these\r\nGreeley-Owen debates in the _Tribune_ were the direct cause of their\r\ndecision to bring this subject before the convention, where they hoped\r\nfor support from their liberal friends. They counted especially on\r\nLucy Stone, who seemed to give her approval when she wrote, \"I am glad\r\nyou will speak on the divorce question, provided you yourself are\r\nclear on the subject. It is a great grave topic that one shudders to\r\ngrapple, but its hour is coming.... God touch your lips if you speak\r\non it.\"[110]\r\n\r\nNeither Susan nor Mrs. Stanton shuddered to grapple with any subject\r\nwhich they believed needed attention. In fact, the discussion of\r\nmarriage and divorce in woman's rights conventions had been on their\r\nminds for some time. Three years before Susan had written Lucy, \"I\r\nhave thought with you until of late that the Social Question must be\r\nkept separate from Woman's Rights, but we have always claimed that our\r\nmovement was _Human Rights_, not Woman's specially.... It seems to me\r\nwe have played on the surface of things quite long enough. Getting the\r\nright to hold property, to vote, to wear what dress we please, etc.,\r\nare all to the good, but _Social Freedom_, after all, lies at the\r\nbottom of all, and unless woman gets that she must continue the slave\r\nof man in all other things.\"[111]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsternation spread through the genial ranks of the convention as\r\nMrs. Stanton now offered resolutions calling for more liberal divorce\r\nlaws. Quick to sense the temper of an audience, Susan felt its\r\nresistance to being jolted out of the pleasant contemplation of past\r\nsuccesses to the unpleasant recognition that there were still\r\ndifficult ugly problems ahead. She was conscious at once of a stir of\r\nastonishment and disapproval when Mrs. Stanton in her clear compelling\r\nvoice read, \"Resolved, That an unfortunate or ill-assorted marriage is\r\never a calamity, but not ever, perhaps never a crime--and when society\r\nor government, by its laws or customs, compels its continuance, always\r\nto the grief of one of the parties, and the actual loss and damage of\r\nboth, it usurps an authority never delegated to man, nor exercised by\r\nGod, Himself....\"[112]\r\n\r\nListening to Mrs. Stanton's speech in defense of her ten bold\r\nresolutions on marriage and divorce, Susan felt that her brave\r\ncolleague was speaking for women everywhere, for wives of the present\r\nand the future. As the hearty applause rang out, she concluded that\r\neven the disapproving admired her courage; but before the applause\r\nceased, she saw Antoinette Blackwell on her feet, waiting to be heard.\r\nShe knew that Antoinette, like Horace Greeley, preferred to think of\r\nall marriages as made in heaven, and true to form Antoinette contended\r\nthat the marriage relation \"must be lifelong\" and \"as permanent and\r\nindissoluble as the relation of parent and child.\"[113] At once\r\nErnestine Rose came to the rescue in support of Mrs. Stanton.\r\n\r\nThen Wendell Phillips showed his displeasure by moving that Mrs.\r\nStanton's resolutions be laid on the table and expunged from the\r\nrecord because they had no more to do with this convention than\r\nslavery in Kansas or temperance. \"This convention,\" he asserted, \"as I\r\nunderstand it, assembles to discuss the laws that rest unequally upon\r\nmen and women, not those that rest equally on men and women.\"[114]\r\n\r\nAghast at this statement, Susan was totally unprepared to have his\r\nviews supported by that other champion of liberty, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, who, however, did not favor expunging the resolutions from\r\nthe record.\r\n\r\nIt was incomprehensible to Susan that neither Garrison nor Phillips\r\nrecognized woman's subservient status in marriage under prevailing\r\nlaws and traditions, and she now stated her own views with firmness:\r\n\"As to the point that this question does not belong to this\r\nplatform--from that I totally dissent. Marriage has ever been a\r\none-sided matter, resting most unequally upon the sexes. By it, man\r\ngains all--woman loses all; tyrant law and lust reign supreme with\r\nhim--meek submission and ready obedience alone befit her.\"[115]\r\n\r\nWarming to the subject, she continued, \"By law, public sentiment, and\r\nreligion from the time of Moses down to the present day, woman has\r\nnever been thought of other than as a piece of property, to be\r\ndisposed of at the will and pleasure of man. And this very hour, by\r\nour statute books, by our so-called enlightened Christian\r\ncivilization, she has no voice in saying what shall be the basis of\r\nthe relation. She must accept marriage as man proffers it or not at\r\nall....\"\r\n\r\nWhen finally the vote was taken, Mrs. Stanton's resolutions were laid\r\non the table, but not expunged from the record, and the convention\r\nadjourned with much to talk about and think about for some time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, of course, could not overlook such a piece of news as\r\nthis heated argument on divorce in a woman's rights convention, and\r\nfanned the flames pro and con, most of them holding up Miss Anthony\r\nand Mrs. Stanton as dangerous examples of freedom for women. The Rev.\r\nA. D. Mayo, Unitarian clergyman of Albany, heretofore Susan's loyal\r\nchampion, now made a point of reproving her. \"You are not married,\" he\r\ndeclared with withering scorn. \"You have no business to be discussing\r\nmarriage.\" To this she retorted, \"Well, Mr. Mayo, you are not a\r\nslave. Suppose you quit lecturing on slavery.\"[116]\r\n\r\nBoth Susan and Mrs. Stanton, amazed at the opposition and the\r\ndisapproval they had aroused, were grateful for Samuel Longfellow's\r\ncomforting words of commendation[117] and for the letters of approval\r\nwhich came from women from all parts of the state. Most satisfying of\r\nall was this reassurance from Lucretia Mott, whose judgment they so\r\nhighly valued: \"I was rejoiced to have such a defense of the\r\nresolutions as yours. I have the fullest confidence in the united\r\njudgment of Elizabeth Stanton and Susan Anthony and I am glad they are\r\nso vigorous in the work.\"[118]\r\n\r\nHardest to bear was the disapproval of Wendell Phillips whom they both\r\nadmired so much. Difficult to understand and most disappointing was\r\nLucy Stone's failure to attend the convention or come to their\r\ndefense. Thinking over this first unfortunate difference of opinion\r\namong the faithful crusaders for freedom to whom she had always felt\r\nso close in spirit, Susan was sadly disillusioned, but she had no\r\nregrets that the matter had been brought up, and she defied her\r\ncritics by speaking before a committee of the New York legislature in\r\nsupport of a liberal divorce bill. Nor was she surprised when a group\r\nof Boston women, headed by Caroline H. Dall, called a convention which\r\nthey hoped would counteract this radical outbreak in the woman's\r\nrights movement by keeping to the safe subjects of education,\r\nvocation, and civil position.\r\n\r\nHaving learned by this time through the hard school of experience that\r\nthe bona-fide reformer could not play safe and go forward, Susan\r\nthoughtfully commented, \"Cautious, careful people, always casting\r\nabout to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can\r\nbring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing\r\nto be anything or nothing in the world's estimation, and publicly and\r\nprivately, in season and out, avow their sympathy with despised and\r\npersecuted ideas and their advocates, and bear the consequences.\"[119]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe repercussions of the divorce debates were soon drowned out by the\r\nnoise and excitement of the presidential campaign of 1860. With four\r\ncandidates in the field, Breckenridge, Bell, Douglas, and Lincoln,\r\neach offering his party's solution for the nation's critical problems,\r\nthere was much to think about and discuss, and Susan found woman's\r\nrights pushed into the background. At the same time antagonism toward\r\nabolitionists was steadily mounting for they were being blamed for the\r\ntensions between the North and the South.\r\n\r\nDedicated to the immediate and unconditional emancipation of slavery,\r\nSusan saw no hope in the promises of any political party. Even the\r\nRepublicans' opposition to the extension of slavery in the\r\nterritories, which had won over many abolitionists, including Henry\r\nand Elizabeth Stanton, seemed to her a mild and ineffectual answer to\r\nthe burning questions of the hour. For her to further the election of\r\nAbraham Lincoln was unthinkable, since he favored the enforcement of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law and had stated he was not in favor of Negro\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nAt heart she was a nonvoting Garrisonian abolitionist and would not\r\nsupport a political party which in any way sanctioned slavery. Had she\r\nbeen eligible as a voter she undoubtedly would have refused to cast\r\nher ballot until a righteous antislavery government had been\r\nestablished. As she expressed it in a letter to Mrs. Stanton, she\r\ncould not, if she were a man, vote for \"the least of two evils, one of\r\nwhich the Nation must surely have in the presidential chair.\"[120]\r\n\r\nShe saw no possibility at this time of wiping out slavery by means of\r\npolitical abolition, because in spite of the fact that slavery had for\r\nyears been one of the most pressing issues before the American people,\r\nno great political party had yet endorsed abolition, nor had a single\r\nprominent practical statesman[121] advocated immediate unconditional\r\nemancipation. As the Liberty party experiment had proved, an\r\nabolitionist running for office on an antislavery platform was doomed\r\nto defeat. Therefore the gesture made in this critical campaign by a\r\nsmall group of abolitionists in nominating Gerrit Smith for president\r\nappeared utterly futile to Susan. Abolitionists, she believed,\r\nfollowed the only course consistent with their principles when they\r\neschewed politics, abstained from voting, and devoted their energies\r\nwith the fervor of evangelists to a militant educational campaign.\r\n\r\nSo, whenever she could, she continued to hold antislavery meetings.\r\n\"Crowded house at Port Byron,\" her diary records. \"I tried to say a\r\nfew words at opening, but soon curled up like a sensitive plant. It is\r\na terrible martyrdom for me to speak.\"[122] Yet so great was the need\r\nto enlighten people on the evils of slavery that she endured this\r\nmartyrdom, stepping into the breach when no other speaker was\r\navailable. Taking as her subject, \"What Is American Slavery?\" she\r\ndeclared, \"It is the legalized, systematic robbery of the bodies and\r\nsouls of nearly four millions of men, women, and children. It is the\r\nlegalized traffic in God's image.\"[123]\r\n\r\nShe asked for personal liberty laws to protect the human rights of\r\nfugitive slaves, adding that the Dred Scott decision had been possible\r\nonly because it reflected the spirit and purpose of the American\r\npeople in the North as well as the South. She heaped blame on the\r\nNorth for restricting the Negro's educational and economic\r\nopportunities, for barring him from libraries, lectures, and theaters,\r\nand from hotels and seats on trains and buses.\r\n\r\n\"Let the North,\" she urged, \"prove to the South by her acts that she\r\nfully recognizes the humanity of the black man, that she respects his\r\nrights in all her educational, industrial, social, and political\r\nassociations....\"\r\n\r\nThis was asking far more than the North was ready to give, but to\r\nSusan it was justice which she must demand. No wonder free Negroes in\r\nthe North honored and loved her and expressed their gratitude whenever\r\nthey could. \"A fine-looking colored man on the train presented me with\r\na bouquet,\" she wrote in her diary. \"Can't tell whether he knew me or\r\nonly felt my sympathy.\"[124]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe threats of secession from the southern states, which followed\r\nLincoln's election, brought little anxiety to Susan or her\r\nfellow-abolitionists, for they had long preached, \"No Union with\r\nSlaveholders,\" believing that dissolution of the Union would prevent\r\nfurther expansion of slavery in the new western territories, and not\r\nonly lessen the damaging influence of slavery on northern\r\ninstitutions, but relieve the North of complicity in maintaining\r\nslavery. Garrison in his _Liberator_ had already asked, \"Will the\r\nSouth be so obliging as to secede from the Union?\" When, in December\r\n1860, South Carolina seceded, Horace Greeley, who only a few months\r\nbefore had called the disunion abolitionists \"a little coterie of\r\ncommon scolds,\" now wrote in the _Tribune_, \"If the cotton states\r\nshall decide that they can do better out of the Union than in it, we\r\ninsist in letting them go in peace. The right to secede may be a\r\nrevolutionary one, but it exists nevertheless.\"[125]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Lloyd Garrison]\r\n\r\nWhat abolitionists feared far more than secession was that to save the\r\nUnion some compromise would be made which would fasten slavery on the\r\nnation. Susan agreed with Garrison when he declared in the\r\n_Liberator_, \"All Union-saving efforts are simply idiotic. At last\r\n'the covenant with death' is annulled, 'the agreement with Hell'\r\nbroken--at least by the action of South Carolina and ere long by all\r\nthe slave-holding states, for their doom is one.\"[126]\r\n\r\nCompromise, however, was in the air. The people were appalled and\r\nconfused by the breaking up of the Union and the possibility of civil\r\nwar, and the government fumbled. Powerful Republicans, among them\r\nThurlow Weed, speaking for eastern financial interests, favored the\r\nCrittenden Compromise which would re-establish the Mason-Dixon line,\r\nprotect slavery in the states where it was now legal, sanction the\r\ndomestic slave trade, guarantee payment by the United States for\r\nescaped slaves, and forbid Congress to abolish slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia without the consent of Virginia and Maryland.\r\nEven Seward suggested a constitutional amendment guaranteeing\r\nnoninterference with slavery in the slave states for all time. In such\r\nan atmosphere as this, Susan gloried in Wendell Phillips's impetuous\r\ndeclarations against compromise.\r\n\r\nWhile the whole country marked time, waiting for the inauguration of\r\nPresident Lincoln, abolitionists sent out their speakers, Susan\r\nheading a group in western New York which included Samuel J. May,\r\nStephen S. Foster, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. \"All are united,\" she\r\nwrote William Lloyd Garrison, \"that good faith and honor demand us to\r\ngo forward and leave the responsibility of free speech or its\r\nsuppression with the people of the places we visit.\" Then showing that\r\nshe well understood the temper of the times, she added, \"I trust ...\r\nno personal harm may come to you or Phillips or any of the little band\r\nof the true and faithful who shall defend the right....\"[127]\r\n\r\nFeeling was running high in Buffalo when Susan arrived with her\r\nantislavery contingent in January 1861, expecting disturbances but\r\nunprepared for the animosity of audiences which hissed, yelled, and\r\nstamped so that not a speaker could be heard. The police made no\r\neffort to keep order and finally the mob surged over the platform and\r\nthe lights went out. Nevertheless, Susan who was presiding held her\r\nground until lights were brought in and she could dimly see the\r\nmilling crowd.\r\n\r\nIn small towns they were listened to with only occasional catcalls and\r\nboos of disapproval, but in every city from Buffalo to Albany the mobs\r\nbroke up their meetings. Even in Rochester, which had never before\r\nshown open hostility to abolitionists, Susan's banner, \"No Union with\r\nSlaveholders\" was torn down and a restless audience hissed her as she\r\nopened her meeting and drowned out the speakers with their shouting\r\nand stamping until at last the police took over and escorted the\r\nspeakers home through the jeering crowds.\r\n\r\nAll but Susan now began to question the wisdom of holding more\r\nmeetings, but her determination to continue, and to assert the right\r\nof free speech, shamed her colleagues into acquiescence. Cayenne\r\npepper, thrown on the stove, broke up their meeting at Port Byron. In\r\nRome, rowdies bore down upon Susan, who was taking the admission fee\r\nof ten cents, brushed her aside, \"big cloak, furs, and all,\"[128] and\r\nrushed to the platform where they sang, hooted, and played cards until\r\nthe speakers gave up in despair. Syracuse, well known for its\r\ntolerance and pride in free speech, now greeted them with a howling\r\ndrunken mob armed with knives and pistols and rotten eggs. Susan on\r\nthe platform courageously faced their gibes until she and her\r\ncompanions were forced out into the street. They then took refuge in\r\nthe home of fellow-abolitionists while the mob dragged effigies of\r\nSusan and Samuel J. May through the streets and burned them in the\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nNot even this kept Susan from her last advertised meeting in Albany\r\nwhere Lucretia Mott, Martha C. Wright, Gerrit Smith, and Frederick\r\nDouglass joined her. Here the Democratic mayor, George H. Thatcher,\r\nwas determined to uphold free speech in spite of almost overwhelming\r\nopposition, and calling at the Delavan House for the abolitionists,\r\nsafely escorted them to their hall. Then, with a revolver across his\r\nknees, he sat on the platform with them while his policemen, scattered\r\nthrough the hall, put down every disturbance; but at the end of the\r\nday, he warned Susan that he could no longer hold the mob in check and\r\nbegged her as a personal favor to him to call off the rest of the\r\nmeetings. She consented, and under his protection the intrepid little\r\ngroup of abolitionists walked back to their hotel with the mob\r\ntrailing behind them.\r\n\r\nLooking back upon the tense days and nights of this \"winter of\r\nmobs,\"[129] Susan was proud of her group of abolitionists who so\r\nbravely had carried out their mission. In comparison, the Republicans\r\nhad shown up badly, not a Republican mayor having the courage or\r\ninterest to give them protection. In fact, she found little in the\r\nattitude of the Republicans to offer even a glimmer of hope that they\r\nwere capable of governing in this crisis. Lincoln's inaugural address\r\nprejudiced her at once, for he said, \"I have no purpose directly or\r\nindirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states\r\nwhere it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so and I have\r\nno inclination to do so.\"[130] To her the future looked dark when\r\nstatesmen would save the Union at such a price.\r\n\r\n\"No Compromise\" was Susan's watchword these days, as a feminist as\r\nwell as an abolitionist, even though this again set her at odds with\r\nGarrison and Phillips, the two men she respected above all others.\r\nThey were now writing her stern letters urging her to reveal the\r\nhiding place of a fugitive wife and her daughter. Just before she had\r\nstarted on her antislavery crusade and while she was in Albany with\r\nLydia Mott, a heavily veiled woman with a tragic story had come to\r\nthem for help. She was the wife of Dr. Charles Abner Phelps, a highly\r\nrespected member of the Massachusetts Senate, and the mother of three\r\nchildren. She had discovered, she told them, that her husband was\r\nunfaithful to her, and when she confronted him with the proof, he had\r\ninsisted that she suffered from delusions and had her committed to an\r\ninsane asylum. For a year and a half she had not been allowed to\r\ncommunicate with her children, but finally her brother, a prominent\r\nAlbany attorney, obtained her release through a writ of habeas corpus,\r\ntook her to his home, and persuaded Dr. Phelps to allow the children\r\nto visit her for a few weeks. Now she was desperate as she again faced\r\nthe prospect of being separated from her children by Massachusetts law\r\nwhich gave even an unfaithful husband control of his wife's person and\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\nWell aware of how often her friends of the Underground Railroad had\r\ndefied the Fugitive Slave Law and hidden and transported fugitive\r\nslaves, Susan decided she would do the same for this cultured\r\nintelligent woman, a slave to her husband under the law. Without a\r\nthought of the consequences, she took the train on Christmas Day for\r\nNew York with Mrs. Phelps and her thirteen-year-old daughter, both in\r\ndisguise, hoping that in the crowded city they could hide from Dr.\r\nPhelps and the law. Arriving late at night, they walked through the\r\nsnow and slush to a hotel, only to be refused a room because they were\r\nnot accompanied by a gentleman. They tried another hotel, with the\r\nsame result, and then Susan, remembering a boarding house run by a\r\ndivorced woman she knew, hopefully rang her doorbell. She too refused\r\nthem, claiming all her boarders would leave if she harbored a runaway\r\nwife. By this time it was midnight. Cold and exhausted, they braved a\r\nBroadway hotel, where they were told there was no vacant room; but\r\nSusan, convinced this was only an excuse, said as much to the clerk,\r\nadding, \"You can give us a place to sleep or we will sit in this\r\noffice all night.\" When he threatened to call the police, she\r\nretorted, \"Very well, we will sit here till they come to take us to\r\nthe station.\"[131] Finally he relented and gave them a room without\r\nheat. Early the next morning, Susan began making the rounds of her\r\nfriends in search of shelter for Mrs. Phelps and her daughter, and\r\nfinally at the end of a discouraging day, Abby Hopper Gibbons, the\r\nQuaker who had so often hidden fugitive slaves, took this fugitive\r\nwife into her home.\r\n\r\nReturning to Albany, Susan found herself under suspicion and\r\nthreatened with arrest by Dr. Phelps and Mrs. Phelps's brothers,\r\nbecause she had broken the law by depriving a father of his child.\r\nLetters and telegrams, demanding that she reveal Mrs. Phelps's hiding\r\nplace, followed her to Rochester and on her antislavery tour through\r\nwestern New York. Refusing to be intimidated, she ignored them all.\r\n\r\nWhen Garrison wrote her long letters in his small neat hand, begging\r\nher not to involve the woman's rights and antislavery movements in any\r\n\"hasty and ill-judged, no matter how well-meant\" action, it was hard\r\nfor her to reconcile this advice with his impetuous, undiplomatic, and\r\ndangerous actions on behalf of Negro slaves. \"I feel the strongest\r\nassurance,\" she told him, \"that what I have done is wholly right. Had\r\nI turned my back upon her I should have scorned myself.... That I\r\nshould stop to ask if my act would injure the reputation of any\r\nmovement never crossed my mind, nor will I allow such a fear to stifle\r\nmy sympathies or tempt me to expose her to the cruel inhuman treatment\r\nof her own household. Trust me that as I ignore all law to help the\r\nslave, so will I ignore it all to protect an enslaved woman.\"[132]\r\n\r\nWhen later they met at an antislavery convention, Garrison, renewing\r\nhis efforts on behalf of Dr. Phelps, put this question to Susan,\r\n\"Don't you know that the law of Massachusetts gives the father the\r\nentire guardianship and control of the children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know it,\" she answered. \"Does not the law of the United States\r\ngive the slaveholder the ownership of the slave? And don't you break\r\nit every time you help a slave to Canada? Well, the law which gives\r\nthe father the sole ownership of the children is just as wicked and\r\nI'll break it just as quickly. You would die before you would deliver\r\na slave to his master, and I will die before I will give up that child\r\nto its father.\"\r\n\r\nSusan escaped arrest as she thought she would, for Dr. Phelps could\r\nnot afford the unfavorable publicity involved. He managed to kidnap\r\nhis child on her way to Sunday School, but his wife eventually won a\r\ndivorce through the help of her friends.\r\n\r\nThe most trying part of this experience for Susan was the attitude of\r\nGarrison and Phillips, who, had now for the second time failed to\r\nrecognize that the freedom they claimed for the Negro was also\r\nessential for women. They believed in woman's rights, to be sure, but\r\nwhen these rights touched the institution of marriage, their vision\r\nwas clouded. Just a year before, they had fought Mrs. Stanton's\r\ndivorce resolutions because they were unable to see that the existing\r\nlaws of marriage did not apply equally to men and women. Now they\r\nsustained the father's absolute right over his child. What was it,\r\nSusan wondered, that kept them from understanding? Was it loyalty to\r\nsex, was it an unconscious clinging to dominance and superiority, or\r\nwas it sheer inability to recognize women as human beings like\r\nthemselves? \"Very many abolitionists,\" she wrote in her diary, \"have\r\nyet to learn the ABC of woman's rights.\"[133]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] _History of Woman Suffrage_, I. p. 689.

This\r\nbreaking up of the Union disturbed Susan primarily because it took the\r\nminds of most of her colleagues off everything but saving the Union.\r\nConvinced that even in a time of national crisis, work for women must\r\ngo on, she tried to prepare for the annual woman's rights convention\r\nin New York, but none of her hitherto dependable friends would help\r\nher. Nevertheless, she persisted, even after the fall of Fort Sumter\r\nand the President's call for troops. Only when the abolitionists\r\ncalled off their annual New York meetings did she reluctantly realize\r\nthat woman's rights too must yield to the exigencies of the hour.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by her Quaker background, she could not see war as the\r\nsolution of this or any other crisis. In fact, the majority of\r\nabolitionists were amazed and bewildered when war came because it was\r\nnot being waged to free the slaves. Looking to their leaders for\r\nguidance, they heard Wendell Phillips declare for war before an\r\naudience of over four thousand in Boston. Garrison, known to all as a\r\nnonresistant, made it clear that his sympathies were with the\r\ngovernment. He saw in \"this grand uprising of the manhood of the\r\nNorth\"[134] a growing appreciation of liberty and free institutions\r\nand a willingness to defend them. Calling upon abolitionists to stand\r\nby their principles, he at the same time warned them not to criticize\r\nLincoln or the Republicans unnecessarily, not to divide the North, but\r\nto watch events and bide their time, and he opposed those\r\nabolitionists who wanted to withhold support of the government until\r\nit stood openly and unequivocally for the Negro's freedom. From the\r\nfront page of the _Liberator_, he now removed his slogan, \"No Union\r\nwith Slaveholders.\" Kindly placid Samuel J. May, usually against all\r\nviolence, now compared the sacrifices of the war to the crucifixion,\r\nand to Susan this was blasphemy. Even Parker Pillsbury wrote her, \"I\r\nam rejoicing over Old Abe, but my voice is still for war.\"[135]\r\n\r\nShe was troubled, confused, and disillusioned by the attitude of these\r\nmen and by that of most of her antislavery friends. Only very few,\r\namong them Lydia Mott, were uncompromising non-resistants. To one of\r\nthem she wrote, \"I have tried hard to persuade myself that I alone\r\nremained mad, while all the rest had become sane, because I have\r\ninsisted that it is our duty to bear not only our usual testimony but\r\none even louder and more earnest than ever before.... The\r\nAbolitionists, for once, seem to have come to an agreement with all\r\nthe world that they are out of tune and place, hence should hold their\r\npeace and spare their rebukes and anathemas. Our position to me seems\r\nmost humiliating, simply that of the politicians, one of expediency,\r\nnot principle. I have not yet seen one good reason for the abandonment\r\nof all our meetings, and am more and more ashamed and sad that even\r\nthe little Apostolic number have yielded to the world's motto--'the\r\nend justifies the means.'\"[136]\r\n\r\nNow the farm home was a refuge. Her father, leaving her in charge,\r\ntraveled West for his long-dreamed-of visit with his sons in Kansas,\r\nwith Daniel R., now postmaster at Leavenworth, and with Merritt and\r\nhis young wife, Mary Luther, in their log cabin at Osawatomie. As a\r\nrelease from her pent-up energy, Susan turned to hard physical work.\r\n\"Superintended the plowing of the orchard,\" she recorded in her diary.\r\n\"The last load of hay is in the barn; and all in capital order....\r\nWashed every window in the house today. Put a quilted petticoat in the\r\nframe.... Quilted all day, but sewing seems no longer to be my\r\ncalling.... Fitted out a fugitive slave for Canada with the help of\r\nHarriet Tubman.\"[137]\r\n\r\nAlthough she filled her days, life on the farm in these stirring times\r\nseemed futile to her. She missed the stimulating exchange of ideas\r\nwith fellow-abolitionists and confessed to her diary, \"The all-alone\r\nfeeling will creep over me. It is such a fast after the feast of great\r\npresences to which I have been so long accustomed.\"\r\n\r\nThe war was much on her mind. Eagerly she read Greeley's _Tribune_ and\r\nthe Rochester _Democrat_. The news was discouraging--the tragedy of\r\nBull Run, the call for more troops, defeat after defeat for the Union\r\narmies. General Frémont in Missouri freeing the slaves of rebels only\r\nto have Lincoln cancel the order to avert antagonizing the border\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n\"How not to do it seems the whole study of Washington,\" she wrote in\r\nher diary. \"I wish the government would move quickly, proclaim freedom\r\nto every slave and call on every able-bodied Negro to enlist in the\r\nUnion Army.... To forever blot out slavery is the only possible\r\ncompensation for this merciless war.\"[138]\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her longing for a better understanding of people and\r\nevents, she turned to books, first to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's\r\n_Casa Guidi Windows_, which she called \"a grand poem, so fitting to\r\nour terrible struggle,\" then to her _Sonnets from the Portuguese_, and\r\nGeorge Eliot's popular _Adam Bede_, recently published. More serious\r\nreading also absorbed her, for she wanted to keep abreast of the most\r\nadvanced thought of the day. \"Am reading Buckle's _History of\r\nCivilization_ and Darwin's _Descent of Man_,\" she wrote in her diary.\r\n\"Have finished _Origin of the Species_. Pillsbury has just given me\r\nEmerson's poems.\"[139]\r\n\r\nEager to thrash out all her new ideas with Elizabeth Stanton, she went\r\nto Seneca Falls for a few days of good talk, hoping to get Mrs.\r\nStanton's help in organizing a woman's rights convention in 1862; but\r\nnot even Mrs. Stanton could see the importance of such work at this\r\ntime, believing that if women put all their efforts into winning the\r\nwar, they would, without question, be rewarded with full citizenship.\r\nSusan was skeptical about this and disappointed that even the best\r\nwomen were so willing to be swept aside by the onrush of events.\r\n\r\nAlthough opposed to war, Susan was far from advocating peace at any\r\nprice, and was greatly concerned over the confusion in Washington\r\nwhich was vividly described in the discouraging letters Mrs. Stanton\r\nreceived from her husband, now Washington correspondent for the New\r\nYork _Tribune_. Both she and Mrs. Stanton chafed at inaction. They had\r\nloyalty, intelligence, an understanding of national affairs, and\r\nexecutive ability to offer their country, but such qualities were not\r\nsought after among women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1862, Susan helped Mrs. Stanton move her family to a\r\nnew home in Brooklyn, and spent a few weeks with her there, getting\r\nthe feel of the city in wartime. She then had the satisfaction of\r\ndiscovering that at least one woman was of use to her country, young\r\neloquent Anna E. Dickinson.[140] Susan listened with pride and joy\r\nwhile Anna spoke to an enthusiastic audience at Cooper Union on the\r\nissues of the war. She took Anna to her heart at once. Anna's youth,\r\nher fervor, and her remarkable ability drew out all of Susan's\r\nmotherly instincts of affection and protectiveness. They became\r\ndevoted friends, and for the next few years carried on a voluminous\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nHarriet Hosmer and Rosa Bonheur also helped restore Susan's confidence\r\nin women during these difficult days when, forced to mark time, she\r\nherself seemed at loose ends. Visiting the Academy of Design, she\r\nstudied \"in silent reverential awe,\" the marble face of Harriet\r\nHosmer's Beatrice Cenci, and declared, \"Making that cold marble\r\nbreathe and pulsate, Harriet Hosmer has done more to ennoble and\r\nelevate woman than she could possibly have done by mere words....\" Of\r\nRosa Bonheur, the first woman to venture into the field of animal\r\npainting, she said, \"Her work not only surpasses anything ever done by\r\na woman, but is a bold and successful step beyond all other\r\nartists.\"[141]\r\n\r\nThis confidence was soon dispelled, however, when a letter came from\r\nLydia Mott containing the crushing news that the New York legislature\r\nhad amended the newly won Married Woman's Property Law of 1860, while\r\nwomen's attention was focused on the war, and had taken away from\r\nmothers the right to equal guardianship of their children and from\r\nwidows the control of the property left at the death of their\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\n\"We deserve to suffer for our confidence in 'man's sense of justice,'\"\r\nshe confessed to Lydia. \" ... All of our reformers seem suddenly to\r\nhave grown politic. All alike say, 'Have no conventions at this\r\ncrisis!' Garrison, Phillips, Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Wright, Mrs. Stanton,\r\netc. say, 'Wait until the war excitement abates....' I am sick at\r\nheart, but cannot carry the world against the wish and will of our\r\nbest friends....\"[142]\r\n\r\nUnable to arouse even a glimmer of interest in woman's rights at this\r\ntime, Susan started off on a lecture tour of her own, determined to\r\nmake people understand that this war, so abhorrent to her, must be\r\nfought for the Negroes' freedom. \"I cannot feel easy in my conscience\r\nto be dumb in an hour like this,\" she explained to Lydia, adding, \"It\r\nis so easy to feel your power for public work slipping away if you\r\nallow yourself to remain too long snuggled in the Abrahamic bosom of\r\nhome. It requires great will power to resurrect one's soul.[143]\r\n\r\n\"I am speaking now extempore,\" she continued, \"and more to my\r\nsatisfaction than ever before. I am amazed at myself, but I could not\r\ndo it if any of our other speakers were listening to me. I am entirely\r\noff old antislavery grounds and on the new ones thrown up by the war.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling particularly close to Lydia at this time, she gratefully\r\nadded, \"What a stay, counsel, and comfort you have been to me, dear\r\nLydia, ever since that eventful little temperance meeting in that\r\ncold, smoky chapel in 1852. How you have compelled me to feel myself\r\ncompetent to go forward when trembling with doubt and distrust. I can\r\nnever express the magnitude of my indebtedness to you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the small towns of western New York, people were willing to listen\r\nto Susan, for they were troubled by the defeats northern armies had\r\nsuffered and by the appalling lack of unity and patriotism in the\r\nNorth. They were beginning to see that the problem of slavery had to\r\nbe faced and were discussing among themselves whether Negroes were\r\ncontraband, whether army officers should return fugitive slaves to\r\ntheir masters, whether slaves of the rebels should be freed, whether\r\nNegroes should be enlisted in the army.\r\n\r\nSusan had an answer for them. \"It is impossible longer to hold the\r\nAfrican race in bondage,\" she declared, \"or to reconstruct this\r\nRepublic on the old slaveholding basis. We can neither go back nor\r\nstand still. With the nation as with the individual, every new\r\nexperience forces us into a new and higher life and the old self is\r\nlost forever. Hundreds of men who never thought of emancipation a year\r\nago, talk it freely and are ready to vote for it and fight for it\r\nnow.[144]\r\n\r\n\"Can the thousands of Northern soldiers,\" she asked, \"who in their\r\nmarch through Rebel States have found faithful friends and generous\r\nallies in the slaves ever consent to hurl them back into the hell of\r\nslavery, either by word, or vote, or sword? Slaves have sought shelter\r\nin the Northern Army and have tasted the forbidden fruit of the Tree\r\nof Liberty. Will they return quietly to the plantation and patiently\r\nendure the old life of bondage with all its degradation, its\r\ncruelties, and wrong? No, No, there can be no reconstruction on the\r\nold basis....\" Far less degrading and ruinous, she earnestly added,\r\nwould be the recognition of the independence of the southern\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony]\r\n\r\nTo the question of what to do with the emancipated slaves, her quick\r\nanswer was, \"Treat the Negroes just as you do the Irish, the Scotch,\r\nand the Germans. Educate them to all the blessings of our free\r\ninstitutions, to our schools and churches, to every department of\r\nindustry, trade, and art.\r\n\r\n\"What arrogance in _us_,\" she continued, \"to put the question, What\r\nshall _we_ do with a race of men and women who have fed, clothed, and\r\nsupported both themselves and their oppressors for centuries....\"\r\n\r\nOften she spoke against Lincoln's policy of gradual, compensated\r\nemancipation, which to an eager advocate of \"immediate, unconditional\r\nemancipation\" seemed like weakness and appeasement. She had to admit,\r\nhowever, that there had been some progress in the right direction, for\r\nCongress had recently forbidden the return of fugitive slaves to their\r\nmasters, had decreed immediate emancipation in the District of\r\nColumbia, and prohibited slavery in the territories.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's promise of freedom on January 1, 1863, to slaves\r\nin all states in armed rebellion against the government, seemed wholly\r\ninadequate to her and to her fellow-abolitionists, because it left\r\nslavery untouched in the border states, but it did encourage them to\r\nhope that eventually Lincoln might see the light. Horace Greeley wrote\r\nSusan, \"I still keep at work with the President in various ways and\r\nbelieve you will yet hear him proclaim universal freedom. Keep this\r\nletter and judge me by the event.\"[145]\r\n\r\nIt troubled her that public opinion in the North was still far from\r\nsympathetic to emancipation. Northern Democrats, charging Lincoln with\r\nincompetence and autocratic control, called for \"The Constitution as\r\nit is, the Union as it was.\" They had the support of many northern\r\nbusinessmen who faced the loss of millions of credit given to\r\nsoutherners and the support of northern workmen who feared the\r\ncompetition of free Negroes. They had elected Horatio Seymour governor\r\nof New York, and had gained ground in many parts of the country. A\r\nmilitant group in Ohio, headed by Congressman Vallandigham, continued\r\nto oppose the war, asking for peace at once with no terms unfavorable\r\nto the South.\r\n\r\nAll these developments Susan discussed with her father, for she\r\nfrequently came home between lectures. He was a tower of strength to\r\nher. When she was disillusioned or when criticism and opposition were\r\nhard to bear, his sympathy and wise counsel never failed her. There\r\nwas a strong bond of understanding and affection between them.\r\n\r\nHis sudden illness and death, late in November 1862, were a shock from\r\nwhich she had to struggle desperately to recover. Her life was\r\nsuddenly empty. The farm home was desolate. She could not think of\r\nleaving her mother and her sister Mary there all alone. Nor could she\r\ncount on help from Daniel or Merritt, both of whom were serving in the\r\narmy in the West, Daniel, as a lieutenant colonel, and Merritt as a\r\ncaptain in the 7th Kansas Cavalry. For many weeks she had no heart for\r\nanything but grief. \"It seemed as if everything in the world must\r\nstop.\"[146]\r\n\r\nNot even President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued January\r\n1, 1863, roused her. It took a letter from Henry Stanton from\r\nWashington to make her see that there was war work for her to do. He\r\nwrote her, \"The country is rapidly going to destruction. The Army is\r\nalmost in a state of mutiny for want of its pay and lack of a leader.\r\nNothing can carry through but the southern Negroes, and nobody can\r\nmarshal them into the struggle except the abolitionists.... Such men\r\nas Lovejoy, Hale, and the like have pretty much given up the struggle\r\nin despair. You have no idea how dark the cloud is which hangs over\r\nus.... We must not lay the flattering unction to our souls that the\r\nproclamation will be of any use if we are beaten and have a\r\ndissolution of the Union. Here then is work for you, Susan, put on\r\nyour armor and go forth.\"[147]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA month later, Susan went to New York for a visit with Elizabeth\r\nStanton, confident that if they counseled together, they could find a\r\nway to serve their country in its hour of need.\r\n\r\nShe was well aware that all through the country women were responding\r\nmagnificently in this crisis, giving not only their husbands and sons\r\nto the war, but carrying on for them in the home, on the farm, and in\r\nbusiness. Many were sewing and knitting for soldiers, scraping lint\r\nfor hospitals, and organizing Ladies' Aid Societies, which, operating\r\nthrough the United States Sanitary Commission, the forerunner of the\r\nRed Cross, sent clothing and nourishing food to the inadequately\r\nequipped and poorly fed soldiers in the field. In the large cities\r\nwomen were holding highly successful \"Sanitary Fairs\" to raise funds\r\nfor the Sanitary Commission. In fact, through the women, civilian\r\nrelief was organized as never before in history. Individual women too,\r\nSusan knew, were making outstanding contributions to the war. Lucy\r\nStone's sister-in-law, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell,[148] a friend and\r\nadmirer of Florence Nightingale, was training much-needed nurses,\r\nwhile Dr. Mary Walker, putting on coat and trousers, ministered\r\ntirelessly to the wounded on the battlefield. Dorothea Dix, the\r\none-time schoolteacher who had awakened the people to their barbarous\r\ntreatment of the insane, had offered her services to the\r\nSurgeon-General and was eventually appointed Superintendent of Army\r\nNurses, with authority to recruit nurses and oversee hospital\r\nhousekeeping. Clara Barton, a government employee, and other women\r\nvolunteers were finding their way to the front to nurse the wounded\r\nwho so desperately needed their help; and Mother Bickerdyke, living\r\nwith the armies in the field, nursed her boys and cooked for them,\r\nlifting their morale by her motherly, strengthening presence. Through\r\nthe influence of Anna Ella Carroll, Maryland had been saved for the\r\nUnion and she, it was said, was ably advising President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nSusan herself had felt no call to nurse the wounded, although she had\r\noften skillfully nursed her own family; nor had she felt that her\r\nqualifications as an expert housekeeper and good executive demanded\r\nher services at the front to supervise army housekeeping. Instead she\r\nlooked for some important task to which other women would not turn in\r\nthese days when relief work absorbed all their attention. It was not\r\nenough, she felt, for women to be angels of mercy, valuable and\r\nwell-organized as this phase of their work had become. A spirit of\r\nawareness was lacking among them, also a patriotic fervor, and this\r\nled her to believe that northern women needed someone to stimulate\r\ntheir thinking, to force them to come to grips with the basic issues\r\nof the war and in so doing claim their own freedom. Women, she\r\nreasoned, must be aroused to think not only in terms of socks, shirts,\r\nand food for soldiers or of bandages and nursing, but in terms of the\r\ntraditions of freedom upon which this republic was founded. Women must\r\nhave a part in molding public opinion and must help direct policy as\r\nAnna Ella Carroll was proving women could do. Here was the best\r\npossible training for prospective women voters. To all this Mrs.\r\nStanton heartily agreed.\r\n\r\nAs they sat at the dining-room table with Mrs. Stanton's two\r\ndaughters, Maggie and Hattie, all busily cutting linen into small\r\nsquares and raveling them into lint for the wounded, they discussed\r\nthe state of the nation. They were troubled by the low morale of the\r\nNorth and by the insidious propaganda of the Copperheads, an antiwar,\r\npro-Southern group, which spread discontent and disrespect for the\r\ngovernment. Profiteering was flagrant, and through speculation and war\r\ncontracts, large fortunes were being built up among the few, while the\r\nmajority of the people not only found their lives badly disrupted by\r\nthe war but suffered from high prices and low wages. So far no\r\ndecisive victory had encouraged confidence in ultimate triumph over\r\nthe South. In newspapers and magazines, women of the North were being\r\nunfavorably compared with southern women and criticized because of\r\ntheir lack of interest in the war. Writing in the _Atlantic Monthly_,\r\nMarch, 1863, Gail Hamilton, a rising young journalist, accused\r\nnorthern women of failing to come up to the level of the day. \"If you\r\ncould have finished the war with your needles,\" she chided them, \"it\r\nwould have been finished long ago, but stitching does not crush\r\nrebellion, does not annihilate treason....\"\r\n\r\nThinking along these same lines, Susan and Mrs. Stanton now decided to\r\ngo a step further. They would act to bring women abreast of the issues\r\nof the day, Susan with her flare for organizing women, Mrs. Stanton\r\nwith her pen and her eloquence. They would show women that they had an\r\nideal to fight for. They would show them the uselessness of this\r\nbloody conflict unless it won freedom for all of the slaves. Freedom\r\nfor all, as a basic demand of the republic, would be their watchword.\r\nMen were forming Union Leagues and Loyal Leagues to combat the\r\ninfluence of secret antiwar societies, such as the Knights of the\r\nGolden Circle. \"Why not organize a Women's National Loyal League?\"\r\nSusan and Mrs. Stanton asked each other.\r\n\r\nThey talked their ideas over first with the New York abolitionists,\r\nthen with Horace Greeley, Henry Ward Beecher, and his dashing young\r\nfriend, Theodore Tilton, and with Robert Dale Owen, now in the city as\r\nthe recently appointed head of the Freedman's Inquiry Commission.\r\nThese men were in touch with Charles Sumner and other antislavery\r\nmembers of Congress. All agreed that the Emancipation Proclamation\r\nmust be implemented by an act of Congress, by an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, and that public opinion must be aroused to demand a\r\nThirteenth Amendment. If women would help, so much the better.\r\n\r\nSusan at once thought of petitions. If petitions had won the Woman's\r\nProperty Law in New York, they could win the Thirteenth Amendment. The\r\nlargest petition ever presented to Congress was her goal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarefully Susan and Mrs. Stanton worked over an _Appeal to the Women\r\nof the Republic_, sending it out in March 1863 with a notice of a\r\nmeeting to be held in New York. It left no doubt in the minds of those\r\nwho received it that women had a responsibility to their country\r\nbeyond services of mercy to the wounded and disabled.\r\n\r\nFrom all parts of the country, women responded to their call. The\r\nveteran antislavery and woman's rights worker, Angelina Grimké Weld,\r\ncame out of her retirement for the meeting. Ernestine Rose, the ever\r\nfaithful, was on hand. Lucy Stone and Antoinette Brown Blackwell were\r\nthere, and the popular Hutchinson family, famous for their stirring\r\nabolition songs. They helped Susan and Mrs. Stanton steer the course\r\nof the meeting into the right channels, to show the women assembled\r\nthat the war was being fought not merely to preserve the Union, but\r\nalso to preserve the American way of life, based on the principle of\r\nequal rights and freedom for all, to save it from the encroachments of\r\nslavery and a slaveholding aristocracy. Susan proposed a resolution\r\ndeclaring that there can never be a true peace until the civil and\r\npolitical rights of all citizens are established, including those of\r\nNegroes and women. The introduction of the woman's rights issue into a\r\nwar meeting with an antislavery program was vigorously opposed by\r\nwomen from Wisconsin, but the faithful feminists came to the rescue\r\nand the controversial resolution was adopted.\r\n\r\nAlthough she always instinctively related all national issues to\r\nwoman's rights and vice versa, Susan did not allow this subject to\r\novershadow the main purpose of the meeting. Instead she analyzed the\r\nissue of the war and reproached Lincoln for suppressing the fact that\r\nslavery was the real cause of the war and for waiting two long years\r\nbefore calling the four million slaves to the side of the North.\r\n\"Every hour's delay, every life sacrificed up to the proclamation that\r\ncalled the slave to freedom and to arms,\" she declared, \"was nothing\r\nless than downright murder by the government.... I therefore hail the\r\nday when the government shall recognize that it is a war for\r\nfreedom.\"[149]\r\n\r\nA Women's National Loyal League was organized, electing Susan\r\nsecretary and Mrs. Stanton president. They sent a long letter to\r\nPresident Lincoln thanking him for the Emancipation Proclamation,\r\nespecially for the freedom it gave Negro women, and assuring him of\r\ntheir loyalty and support in this war for freedom. Their own immediate\r\ntask, they decided, was to circulate petitions asking for an act of\r\nCongress to emancipate \"all persons of African descent held in\r\ninvoluntary servitude.\" As Susan so tersely expressed it, they would\r\n\"canvass the nation for freedom.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll the oratory over, Susan now undertook the hard work of making the\r\nWomen's National Loyal League a success, assuming the initial\r\nfinancial burden of printing petitions and renting an office, Room 20,\r\nat Cooper Institute, where she was busy all day and where New York\r\nmembers met to help her. To each of the petitions sent out, she\r\nattached her battle cry, \"There must be a law abolishing slavery....\r\nWomen, you cannot vote or fight for your country. Your only way to be\r\na power in the government is through the exercise of this one, sacred,\r\nconstitutional 'right of petition,' and we ask you to use it now to\r\nthe utmost....\" She also asked those signing the petitions to\r\ncontribute a penny to help with expenses and in this way she slowly\r\nraised $3,000.[150]\r\n\r\nAt first the response was slow, although both Republican and\r\nantislavery papers were generous in their praise of this undertaking,\r\nbut when the signed petitions began to come in, she felt repaid for\r\nall her efforts, and when the Hovey Fund trustees appropriated twelve\r\ndollars a week for her salary, the financial burden lifted a little.\r\nYet it was ever present. For herself she needed little. She wrote her\r\nmother and Mary, \"I go to a little restaurant nearby for lunch every\r\nnoon. I always take strawberries with two tea rusks. Today I said,\r\n'all this lacks is a glass of milk from my mother's cellar,' and the\r\ngirl replied, 'We have very nice Westchester milk.' So tomorrow I\r\nshall add that to my bill of fare. My lunch costs, berries five cents,\r\nrusks five, and tomorrow the milk will be three.\"[151]\r\n\r\nThe cost of postage mounted as the petitions continued to go out to\r\nall parts of the country. In dire need of funds, Susan decided to\r\nappeal to Henry Ward Beecher; and wearily climbing Columbia Heights to\r\nhis home, she suddenly felt a strong hand on her shoulder and a\r\nfamiliar voice asking, \"Well, old girl, what do you want now?\" He took\r\nup a collection for her in Plymouth Church, raising $200. Gerrit Smith\r\nsent her $100, when she had hoped for $1,000, and Jessie Benton\r\nFrémont, $50. Before long, her \"war of ideas\" won the support of\r\nWendell Phillips, Frederick Douglass, Horace Greeley, George William\r\nCurtis, and other popular lecturers who spoke for her at Cooper Union\r\nto large audiences whose admission fees swelled her funds; and\r\neventually Senator Sumner, realizing how important the petitions could\r\nbe in arousing public opinion for the Thirteenth Amendment, saved her\r\nthe postage by sending them out under his frank.[152]\r\n\r\nShe made her home with the Stantons, who had moved from Brooklyn to 75\r\nWest 45th Street, New York, and the comfortable evenings of good\r\nconversation and her busy days at the office helped mightily to heal\r\nher grief for her father. In the bustling life of the city she felt\r\nshe was living more intensely, more usefully, as these critical days\r\nof war demanded. Henry Stanton, now an editorial writer for Greeley's\r\n_Tribune_, brought home to them the inside story of the news and of\r\npolitics. All of them were highly critical of Lincoln, impatient with\r\nhis slowness and skeptical of his plans for slaveholders and slaves in\r\nthe border states. They questioned Garrison's wisdom in trusting\r\nLincoln. Susan could not feel that Lincoln was honest when he\r\nprotested that he did not have the power to do all that the\r\nabolitionists asked. \"The pity is,\" she wrote Anna E. Dickinson, \"that\r\nthe vast mass of people really believe the man _honest_--that he\r\nbelieves he has not the power--I wish I could....\"[153]\r\n\r\nNew York seethed with unrest as time for the enforcement of the draft\r\ndrew near. Indignant that rich men could avoid the draft by buying a\r\nsubstitute, workingmen were easily incited to riot, and the city was\r\nsoon overrun by mobs bent on destruction. The lives of all Negroes and\r\nabolitionists were in danger. The Stanton home was in the thick of the\r\nrioting, and when Susan and Henry Stanton came home during a lull,\r\nthey all decided to take refuge for the night at the home of Mrs.\r\nStanton's brother-in-law, Dr. Bayard. Here they also found Horace\r\nGreeley hiding from the mob, for hoodlums were marching through the\r\nstreets shouting, \"We'll hang old Horace Greeley to a sour apple\r\ntree.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning Susan started for the office as usual, thinking the\r\nworst was over, but as not a single horsecar or stage was running, she\r\ntook the ferry to Flushing to visit her cousins. Here too there was\r\nrioting, but she stayed on until order was restored by the army. She\r\nreturned to the city to find casualties mounting to over a thousand\r\nand a million dollars' worth of property destroyed. Negroes had been\r\nshot and hung on lamp posts, Horace Greeley's _Tribune_ office had\r\nbeen wrecked and the homes of abolitionist friends burned. \"These are\r\nterrible times,\" she wrote her family, and then went back to work,\r\nstaying devotedly at it through all the hot summer months.[154]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year, she had enrolled the signatures of 100,000 men\r\nand women on her petitions, and assured by Senator Sumner that these\r\npetitions were invaluable in creating sentiment for the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment, she raised the number of signatures in the next few months\r\nto 400,000.\r\n\r\nIn April 1864, the Thirteenth Amendment passed the Senate and the\r\nprospects for it in the House were good. This phase of her work\r\nfinished, Susan disbanded the Women's National Loyal League and\r\nreturned to her family in Rochester.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn despair over the possible re-election of Abraham Lincoln, Susan had\r\njoined Henry and Elizabeth Stanton in stirring up sentiment for John\r\nC. Frémont. Abolitionists were sharply divided in this presidential\r\ncampaign. Garrison and Phillips disagreed on the course of action,\r\nGarrison coming out definitely for Lincoln in the _Liberator_, while\r\nPhillips declared himself emphatically against four more years of\r\nLincoln. Susan, the Stantons, and Parker Pillsbury were among those\r\nsiding with Phillips because they feared premature reconstruction\r\nunder Lincoln. They cited Lincoln's Amnesty Proclamation as an example\r\nof his leniency toward the rebels. They saw danger in leaving free\r\nNegroes under the control of southerners embittered by war, and called\r\nfor Negro suffrage as the only protection against oppressive laws.\r\nThey opposed the readmission of Louisiana without the enfranchisement\r\nof Negroes. Lincoln, they knew, favored the extension of suffrage only\r\nto literate Negroes and to those who had served in the military\r\nforces. In fact, Lincoln held back while they wanted to go ahead under\r\nfull steam and they looked to Frémont to lead them.\r\n\r\nFollowing the presidential campaign anxiously from Rochester, Susan\r\nwrote Mrs. Stanton, \"I am starving for a full talk with somebody\r\nposted, not merely pitted for Lincoln....\" The persistent cry of the\r\n_Liberator_ and the _Antislavery Standard_ to re-elect Lincoln and not\r\nto swap horses in midstream did not ring true to her. \"We read no more\r\nof the good old doctrine 'of two evils choose neither,'\" she wrote\r\nAnna E. Dickinson. She confessed to Anna, \"It is only safe to seek and\r\nact the truth and to profess confidence in Lincoln would be a lie in\r\nme.\"[155]\r\n\r\nAs the war dragged on through the summer without decisive victories\r\nfor the North, Lincoln's prospects looked bleak, and to her dismay,\r\nSusan saw the chances improving for McClellan, the candidate of the\r\nnorthern Democrats who wanted to end the war, leave slavery alone, and\r\nconciliate the South. The whole picture changed, however, with the\r\ncapture of Atlanta by General Sherman in September. The people's\r\nconfidence in Lincoln revived and Frémont withdrew from the contest.\r\nOne by one the anti-Lincoln abolitionists were converted; and Susan,\r\nanxiously waiting for word from Mrs. Stanton, was relieved to learn\r\nthat she was not one of them, nor was Wendell Phillips whose judgment\r\nand vision both of them valued above that of any other man. With\r\napproval she read these lines which Phillips had just written Mrs.\r\nStanton, \"I would cut off both hands before doing anything to aid\r\nMac's [McClellan's] election. I would cut oft my right hand before\r\ndoing anything to aid Abraham Lincoln's election. I wholly distrust\r\nhis fitness to settle this thing and indeed his purpose.\"[156]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to indicate any change of opinion on Susan's part\r\nregarding Lincoln's unfitness for a second term. That he was the\r\nlesser of two evils, she of course acknowledged. For her these\r\npre-election days were discouraging and frustrating. She had very\r\ndefinite ideas on reconstruction which she felt in justice to the\r\nNegro must be carried out, and Lincoln did not meet her requirements.\r\n\r\nAfter Lincoln's re-election, she again looked to Wendell Phillips for\r\nan adequate policy at this juncture, and she was not disappointed.\r\n\"Phillips has just returned from Washington,\" Mrs. Stanton wrote her.\r\n\"He says the radical men feel they are powerless and checkmated....\r\nThey turn to such men as Phillips to say what politicians dare not\r\nsay.... We say now, as ever, 'Give us immediately unconditional\r\nemancipation, and let there be no reconstruction except on the\r\nbroadest basis of justice and equality!...' Phillips and a few others\r\nmust hold up the pillars of the temple.... I cannot tell you how happy\r\nI am to find Douglass on the same platform with us. Keep him on the\r\nright track. Tell him in this revolution, he, Phillips, and you and I\r\nmust hold the highest ground and truly represent the best type of the\r\nwhite man, the black man, and the woman.\"[157]\r\n\r\nSusan, holding \"the highest ground,\" found it difficult to mark time\r\nuntil she could find her place in the reconstruction. \"The work of the\r\nhour,\" she wrote Anna E. Dickinson, \"is not alone to put down the\r\nRebels in arms, but to educate Thirty Millions of People into the idea\r\nof a True Republic. Hence every influence and power that both men and\r\nwomen can bring to bear will be needed in the reconstruction of the\r\nNation on the broad basis of justice and equality.\"[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[134] Garrisons, _Garrison_, IV, pp. 30-31.\r\n\r\n[135] Lydia Mott to W.

Daniel and Annie, his young wife from\r\nthe East, urged her to visit them.[159] Daniel was well established in\r\nKansas, the publisher of his own newspaper and the mayor of\r\nLeavenworth. He had served a little over a year in the Union army in\r\nthe First Kansas Cavalry. She longed to see him and the West that he\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nNow for the first time she felt free to make the long journey, for her\r\nmother and Mary had sold the farm on the outskirts of Rochester and\r\nhad moved into the city, buying a large red brick house shaded by\r\nmaples and a beautiful horse chestnut. It had been a wrench for Susan\r\nto give up the farm with its memories of her father, but there were\r\ncompensations in the new home on Madison Street, for Guelma, her\r\nhusband, Aaron McLean, and their family lived with them there. Hannah\r\nand her family had also settled in Rochester, and when they bought the\r\nhouse next door, Susan had the satisfaction of living again in the\r\nmidst of her family.[160]\r\n\r\nShe was particularly devoted to Guelma's twenty-three-year-old\r\ndaughter, Ann Eliza, whose \"merry laugh\" and \"bright, joyous presence\"\r\nbrought new life into the household. Ann Eliza was a stimulating\r\nintelligent companion, and Susan looked forward to seeing many of her\r\nown dreams fulfilled in her niece. Then suddenly in the fall of 1864,\r\nAnn Eliza was taken ill, and her death within a few days left a great\r\nvoid.[161]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this sorrow, Daniel sent Susan a ticket and a check\r\nfor a trip to Kansas. Hesitating no longer, she waited only until her\r\n\"tip-top Rochester dressmaker\" made up \"the new, five-dollar silk\"\r\nwhich she had bought in New York.[162]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving for Kansas, in January, 1865, she pasted on the first\r\npage of her diary a clipping of a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,\r\n\"Something Left Undone,\" which seemed so perfectly to interpret her\r\nown feelings:\r\n\r\n    Labor with what zeal we will\r\n      Something still remains undone\r\n    Something uncompleted still\r\n      Waits the rising of the sun....\r\n\r\n    Till at length it is or seems\r\n      Greater than our strength can bear\r\n    As the burden of our dreams\r\n      Pressing on us everywhere....[163]\r\n\r\nWith \"the burden of her dreams\" pressing on her, Susan traveled\r\nwestward. The future of the Negro was much on her mind, for the\r\nThirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery had just been sent to the\r\nstates for ratification. That it would be ratified she had no doubt,\r\nbut she recognized the responsibility facing the North to provide for\r\nthe education and rehabilitation of thousands of homeless bewildered\r\nNegroes trying to make their way in a still unfriendly world, and she\r\nlooked forward to taking part in this work.\r\n\r\nBeyond Chicago, where she stopped over to visit her uncle Albert\r\nDickinson and his family, her journey was rugged, and when she reached\r\nLeavenworth she reveled in the comfort of Daniel's \"neat, little,\r\nsnow-white cottage with green blinds.\" She liked Daniel's wife, Annie,\r\nat once, admired her gaiety and the way she fearlessly drove her\r\nbeautiful black horse across the prairie. \"They have a real 'Aunt\r\nChloe' in the kitchen,\" she wrote Mrs. Stanton, \"and a little Darkie\r\nboy for errands and table waiter. I never saw a girl to match. The\r\nmore I see of the race, the more wonderful they are to me.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThere was always good companionship in Daniel's home, for friends from\r\nboth the East and the West found it a convenient stopping place, and\r\nthere was much discussion of politics, the Negro question, and the\r\nfuture of the West. Business was booming in Leavenworth, then the most\r\nthriving town between St. Louis and San Francisco. Eight years before,\r\nwhen Daniel had first settled there, it boasted a population of 4,000.\r\nNow it had grown to 22,000, was lighted with gas, and was building its\r\nbusiness blocks of brick. As Susan drove through the busy streets with\r\nAnnie, she saw emigrants coming in by steamer and train to settle in\r\nKansas and watched for the covered wagons that almost every day\r\nstopped in Leavenworth for supplies before moving on to the far West.\r\nDriving over the wide prairie, sometimes a warm brown, then again\r\nwhite with snow under a wider expanse of deep blue sky than she had\r\never seen before, she relaxed as she had not in many a year and began\r\nto feel the call of the West. She even thought she might like to\r\nsettle in Kansas until she was caught up by the sharp realization of\r\nhow she would miss the stimulating companionship of her friends in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Daniel Anthony, brother of Susan B. Anthony]\r\n\r\nWhen Daniel was busy with his campaign for his second term as mayor,\r\nshe helped him edit the _Bulletin_. He warned her not to fill his\r\npaper up with woman's rights, and in spite of his sympathy for the\r\nNegro, forbade her to advocate Negro suffrage in his paper.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could talk through it the things I'd like to say to the\r\nyoung martyr state ...\" she wrote Mrs. Stanton. \"The Legislature gave\r\nbut six votes for Negro suffrage the other day.... The idea of Kansas\r\nrefusing her loyal Negroes.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again she was shocked at the prejudice against Negroes in\r\nKansas, as when Daniel employed a Negro typesetter and the printers,\r\nrefusing to admit him to their union, went out on strike until he was\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n\"In this city,\" she reported to Mrs. Stanton, \"there are four thousand\r\nex-Missouri slaves who have sought refuge here within the three past\r\nyears.\" Making it her business to learn what was being done to help\r\nthem and educate them, she visited their schools, their Sunday\r\nschools, and the Colored Home, and gave much of her time to them. To\r\nencourage them to demand their rights, she organized an Equal Rights\r\nLeague among them. This was one thing she could do, even if she could\r\nnot plead for Negro suffrage in Daniel's newspaper.[165]\r\n\r\nThen one breath-taking piece of news followed another--Lee's\r\nsurrender, April 9, 1865, and in less than a week, Lincoln's\r\nassassination, his death, and Andrew Johnson's succession to the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nSusan looked upon Lincoln's assassination and death as an act of God.\r\nShe wrote to Mrs. Stanton, \"Was there ever a more terrific command to\r\na Nation to 'stand still and know that I am God' since the world\r\nbegan? The Old Book's terrible exhibitions of God's wrath sink into\r\nnothingness. And this fell blow just at the very hour he was declaring\r\nhis willingness to consign those five million faithful, brave, and\r\nloving loyal people of the South to the tender mercies of the ex-slave\r\nlords of the lash.\"[166]\r\n\r\nShe longed \"to go out and do battle for the Lord once more,\" but when\r\nshe could have expressed her opinions at the big mass meeting held in\r\nmemory of Lincoln, she remained silent. \"My soul was full,\" she\r\nconfessed to Mrs. Stanton, \"but the flesh not equal to stemming the\r\nawful current, to do what the people have called make an exhibition of\r\nmyself. So quenched the spirit and came home ashamed of myself.\"\r\n\r\nThen she added, \"Dear-a-me--how overfull I am, and how I should like\r\nto be nestled into some corner away from every chick and child with\r\nyou once more.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDisturbing news came from the East of dissension in the antislavery\r\nranks, of Garrison's desire to dissolve the American Antislavery\r\nSociety after the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, and of\r\nPhillips' insistence that it continue until freedom for the Negro was\r\nfirmly established. While Garrison maintained that northern states,\r\ndenying the ballot to the Negro, could not consistently make Negro\r\nsuffrage a requirement for readmitting rebel states to the Union,\r\nPhillips demanded Negro suffrage as a condition of readmission.\r\nImmediately abolitionists took sides. Parker Pillsbury, Lydia and\r\nLucretia Mott, Frederick Douglass, Anna E. Dickinson, the Stantons,\r\nand others lined up with Phillips, whose vehement and scathing\r\ncriticism of reconstruction policies seemed to them the need of the\r\nhour. Susan also took sides, praising \"dear ever glorious Phillips\"\r\nand writing in her diary, \"The disbanding of the American Antislavery\r\nSociety is fully as untimely as General Grant's and Sherman's granting\r\nparole and pardon to the whole Rebel armies.\"[167]\r\n\r\nTo her friends in the East, she wrote, \"How can anyone hold that\r\nCongress has no right to demand Negro suffrage in the returning Rebel\r\nstates because it is not already established in all the loyal ones?\r\nWhat would have been said of Abolitionists ten or twenty years ago,\r\nhad they preached to the people that Congress had no right to vote\r\nagainst admitting a new state with slavery, because it was not already\r\nabolished in all the old States? It is perfectly astounding, this\r\nseeming eagerness of so many of our old friends to cover up and\r\napologize for the glaring hate toward the equal recognition of the\r\nmanhood of the black race.\"[168]\r\n\r\nShe rejoiced when word came that the American Antislavery Society\r\nwould continue under the presidency of Phillips, with Parker Pillsbury\r\nas editor of the _Antislavery Standard_; but she was saddened by the\r\nwithdrawal of Garrison, whom she had idolized for so many years and\r\nwhose editorials in the _Liberator_ had always been her\r\ninspiration.[169]\r\n\r\nAs she read the weekly New York _Tribune_, which came regularly to\r\nDaniel, she grew more and more concerned over President Johnson's\r\nreconstruction policy and more and more convinced of the need of a\r\ncrusade for political and civil rights for the Negro. Asked to deliver\r\nthe Fourth of July oration at Ottumwa, Kansas, she decided to put into\r\nit all her views on the controversial subject of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nTraveling by stage the 125 miles to Ottumwa, she found good company\r\nen route and \"great talk on politics, Negro equality, and temperance,\"\r\nand thought the \"grand old prairies ... perfectly splendid and the\r\ntimber-skirted creeks ... delightful.\"[170]\r\n\r\nBefore a large gathering of Kansas pioneers, many of whom had driven\r\nforty or fifty miles to hear her, she stood tall, straight, and\r\nearnest, as she reminded them of the noble heritage of Kansas, of the\r\nbloody years before the war when in the free-state fight, Kansas men\r\nand women \"taught the nation anew\" the principles of the Declaration\r\nof Independence. Lashing out with the vehemence of Phillips against\r\nPresident Johnson's reconstruction policy, she warned, \"There has been\r\nno hour fraught with so much danger as the present.... To be foiled\r\nnow in gathering up the fruits of our blood-bought victories and to\r\nre-enthrone slavery under the new guise of Negro disfranchisement ...\r\nwould be a disaster, a cruelty and crime, which would surely bequeath\r\nto coming generations a legacy of wars and rumors of wars....\"[171]\r\n\r\nShe then cited the results of the elections in Virginia, South\r\nCarolina, and Tennessee to prove her point that unless Negroes were\r\ngiven the vote, rebels would be put in office and a new code of laws\r\napprenticing Negroes passed, establishing a new form of slavery.\r\n\r\nShe urged her audience to be awake to the politicians who were using\r\nthe peoples' reverence and near idolatry of Lincoln to push through\r\nanti-Negro legislation under the guise of carrying out his policies.\r\nThen putting behind her the prejudice and impatience with Lincoln\r\nwhich she had felt during his lifetime, she added, \"If the\r\nadministration of Abraham Lincoln taught the American people one\r\nlesson above another, it was that they must think and speak and\r\nproclaim, and that he as their President was bound to execute their\r\nwill, not his own. And if Lincoln were alive today, he would say as he\r\ndid four years ago, 'I wait the voice of the people.'\"\r\n\r\nIn her special pleading for the Negro, she did not forget women.\r\nCalling attention to the fact that our nation had never been a true\r\nrepublic because the ballot was exclusively in the hands of the \"free\r\nwhite male,\" she asked for a government \"of the people,\" men and\r\nwomen, white and black, with Negro suffrage and woman suffrage as\r\nbasic requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wendell Phillips]\r\n\r\nSo enthusiastic were the Republicans over her speech that they urged\r\nher to prepare it for publication, suggesting, however, that she\r\ndelete the passage on woman suffrage. This was her first intimation\r\nthat Republicans might balk at enfranchising women. So great had been\r\nwomen's contribution to the winning of the war and so indebted were\r\nthe Republicans to women for creating sentiment for the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment, that she had come to expect, along with Mrs. Stanton, that\r\nthe ballot would without question be given them as a reward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was soon obvious to Susan that politicians in the East as well as\r\nin Kansas were shying away from woman suffrage. Mrs. Stanton reported\r\nthat even Wendell Phillips was backsliding, not wishing to campaign\r\nfor Negro suffrage and woman suffrage at the same time. \"While I could\r\ncontinue as heretofore, arguing for woman's rights, just as I do for\r\ntemperance every day,\" he had written, \"still I would not mix the\r\nmovements.... I think such mixture would lose for the Negro far more\r\nthan we should gain for the woman. I am now engaged in abolishing\r\nslavery in a land where the abolition of slavery means conferring or\r\nrecognizing citizenship, and where citizenship supposes the ballot for\r\nall men.\"[172]\r\n\r\nSuch reasoning filled Susan with despair, for she firmly believed that\r\nwomen who had been asking for full citizenship for seventeen years\r\ndeserved precedence over the Negro. Mrs. Stanton agreed. To them,\r\nNegro suffrage without woman suffrage was unthinkable, an unbearable\r\nhumiliation. Half of the Negroes were women, and manhood suffrage\r\nwould fasten upon them a new form of slavery. How could Wendell\r\nPhillips, they asked each other, fail to recognize not only the\r\ntimeliness of woman suffrage, but the fact that women were better\r\nqualified for the ballot than the majority of Negroes, who, because of\r\ntheir years in slavery, were illiterate and the easy prey of\r\nunscrupulous politicians? By all means enfranchise Negroes, they\r\nargued with him, but enfranchise women as well, and if there must be a\r\nlimitation on suffrage, let it be on the basis of literacy, not on the\r\nbasis of sex.\r\n\r\nAmong Republican members of Congress and abolitionists, there was\r\nserious discussion of a Fourteenth Amendment to extend to the Negro\r\ncivil rights and the ballot. Susan, reading about this in Kansas, and\r\nMrs. Stanton, discussing it in New York with her husband, Wendell\r\nPhillips, and Robert Dale Owen, saw in such a revision of the\r\nConstitution a just and logical opportunity to extend woman's rights\r\nat the same time. Previously committed to state action on woman\r\nsuffrage but only because it had then seemed the necessary first step,\r\nboth women welcomed the more direct road offered by an amendment to\r\nthe Constitution. Only they of all the old woman's rights workers were\r\nawake to this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThroughout the United States, people were thinking about the\r\nConstitution as Americans had not done since the Bill of Rights was\r\nratified in 1791. Not only were amendments to the federal Constitution\r\nin the air, not only were rebel states being readmitted to the Union\r\nwith new constitutions, but state constitutions in the North were\r\nbeing revised, and western territories sought statehood. In Susan's\r\nopinion the time was ripe to proclaim equal rights for all. This\r\nclearly was woman's hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Come back and help,\" pleaded Elizabeth Stanton, who grew more and\r\nmore alarmed as she saw all interest in woman suffrage crowded out of\r\nthe minds of reformers by their zeal for the Negro. \"I have argued\r\nconstantly with Phillips and the whole fraternity, but I fear one and\r\nall will favor enfranchising the Negro without us. Woman's cause is in\r\ndeep water.... There is pressing need of our woman's rights\r\nconvention....\"[173]\r\n\r\nSusan's spirits revived at the prospect of holding a woman's rights\r\nconvention, and plans for the future began to take shape as she read\r\nthe closing lines of Mrs. Stanton's letter: \"I hope in a short time to\r\nbe comfortably located in a new house where we will have a room ready\r\nfor you.... I long to put my arms about you once more and hear you\r\nscold me for all my sins and shortcomings.... Oh, Susan, you are very\r\ndear to me. I should miss you more than any other living being on this\r\nearth. You are entwined with much of my happy and eventful past, and\r\nall my future plans are based on you as coadjutor. Yes, our work is\r\none, we are one in aim and sympathy and should be together. Come\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nParker Pillsbury also added his plea, \"Why have you deserted the field\r\nof action at a time like this, at an hour unparalleled in almost\r\ntwenty centuries?... It is not for me to decide your field of labor.\r\nKansas needed John Brown and may need you ... but New York is to\r\nrevise her constitution next year and, if you are absent, who is to\r\nmake the plea for woman?\"\r\n\r\nReading her newspaper a few days later, she found that the politicians\r\nhad made their first move, introducing in the House of Representatives\r\na resolution writing the word \"male\" into the qualifications of voters\r\nin the second section of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment. She\r\nstarted at once for the East.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the long journey back, in the heat of August, traveling by stage\r\nand railroad with many stops to make the necessary connections, Susan\r\nnot only visited her many relatives who had moved to the West, but\r\nalso called on antislavery and woman suffrage workers, and held\r\nmeetings to plead for free schools for Negroes and for the ballot for\r\nNegroes and women. She found people relieved to have the war over and\r\nbusy with their own affairs, but with prejudices smoldering. Public\r\nspeaking was still an ordeal for her and she confessed to her diary,\r\n\"Made a labored talk.... Had a struggle to get through with speech,\"\r\nand again, \"Had a hard time. Thoughts nor words would come--Staggered\r\nthrough.\"[174] However, she was a determined woman. The message must\r\nbe carried to the people and she would do it whether she suffered in\r\nthe process or not.\r\n\r\nLate in September, she reached her own comfortable home in Rochester,\r\nbut she had too much on her mind to stay there long, and within a few\r\nweeks was in New York with Elizabeth Stanton, deep in a serious\r\ndiscussion of how to create an overwhelming demand for woman suffrage\r\nat this crucial time. Again they decided to petition Congress, this\r\ntime for the vote for both women and Negroes. Five years had now\r\npassed since the last national woman's rights convention, and the\r\nworkers were scattered; some had lost interest and others thought only\r\nof the need of the Negro. Lucretia Mott, Lydia Mott, and Parker\r\nPillsbury responded at once. Susan sought out Lucy Stone in spite of\r\nthe differences that had grown up between them, and after talking with\r\nLucy, confessed to herself that she had been unjustly impatient with\r\nher.[175]\r\n\r\nHoping for aid from the Jackson or Hovey Fund, she went to New England\r\nto revive interest there and in Concord talked with the Emersons,\r\nBronson Alcott, and Frank Sanborn. When she asked Emerson whether he\r\nthought it wise to demand woman suffrage at this time, he replied,\r\n\"Ask my wife. I can philosophize, but I always look to her to decide\r\nfor me in practical matters.\" Unhesitatingly Mrs. Emerson agreed with\r\nSusan that Congress must be petitioned immediately to enfranchise\r\nwomen either before Negroes were granted the vote or at the same\r\ntime.[176]\r\n\r\nEven Wendell Phillips, who did not want to mix Negro and woman\r\nsuffrage, gave Susan $500 from the Hovey Fund to finance the\r\npetitions, but many of the friends upon whom she had counted needed a\r\nverbal lashing to rouse them out of their apathy. Very soon she had to\r\nface the unpleasant fact that by pressing for woman suffrage now, she\r\nwas estranging many abolitionists. Nevertheless she and Mrs. Stanton\r\nwent ahead undaunted, determined that a petition for woman suffrage\r\nwould go to Congress even if it carried only their own two signatures.\r\n\r\nHowever, petitions with many signatures were reaching Congress in\r\nJanuary 1866--the very first demand ever made for Congressional action\r\non woman suffrage. Senator Sumner, for whom women had rolled up\r\n400,000 signatures for the Thirteenth Amendment, now presented under\r\nprotest \"as most inopportune\" a petition headed by Lydia Maria Child,\r\nwho for years had been his valiant aid in antislavery work; and\r\nThaddeus Stevens, heretofore friendly to woman suffrage and ever\r\nzealous for the Negro, ignored a petition from New York headed by\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton.[177]\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clear to Susan that since the two powerful\r\nRepublicans, Senator Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens, both basically\r\nfriendly to woman suffrage, were determined to devote themselves\r\nwholly to Negro suffrage and to the extension of their party's\r\ninfluence, she could expect no help from lesser party members. Her\r\nonly alternative was to appeal to the Democrats or to an occasional\r\nrecalcitrant Republican, and she allowed nothing to stand in her way,\r\nnot even the frenzied pleas of her abolitionist friends. She found\r\nJames Brooks of New York, Democratic leader of the House, willing to\r\npresent her petitions, and she made use of him, although he was\r\nregarded by abolitionists as a Copperhead and although he was now\r\nadvocating conciliatory reconstruction for the South of which she\r\nherself disapproved. Other Democrats came to the rescue in the Senate\r\nas well as in the House--a few because they saw justice in the demands\r\nof the women, others because they believed white women should have\r\npolitical precedence over Negroes, and still others because they saw\r\nin their support of woman suffrage an opportunity to harass the\r\nRepublicans. During 1866, petitions for woman suffrage with 10,000\r\nsignatures were presented by Democrats and irregular Republicans.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, conferences in New York with Henry Ward Beecher and\r\nTheodore Tilton were encouraging, and for a time Susan thought she had\r\nfound an enthusiastic ally in Tilton, the talented popular young\r\neditor of the _Independent_. Theodore Tilton, with his long hair and\r\nthe soulful face of a poet, with his eloquence as a lecturer and his\r\nflare for journalism, was at the height of his popularity. He had\r\nwinning ways and was full of ideas. After the ratification of the\r\nThirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery, in December 1865, he had\r\nproposed that the American Antislavery Society and the woman's rights\r\ngroup merge to form an American Equal Rights Association which would\r\nfight for equal rights for all, for Negro and woman suffrage. Wendell\r\nPhillips he suggested for president, and the _Antislavery Standard_\r\nas the paper of the new organization.\r\n\r\nThis sounded reasonable and hopeful to Susan, and she hurried to\r\nBoston with a group from New York, including Lucy Stone, to consult\r\nWendell Phillips and his New England colleagues. Wendell Phillips,\r\nhowever, was cool to the proposition, pointing out the necessity of\r\namending the constitution of the American Antislavery Society before\r\nany such action could be taken. Never dreaming that he would actually\r\noppose their plan, Susan expected this would be taken care of; but\r\nwhen she convened her woman's rights convention in New York in May\r\n1866, simultaneously with that of the American Antislavery Society,\r\nshe found to her dismay that no formal notice of the proposed union\r\nhad been given to the members of the antislavery group and therefore\r\nthere was no way for them to vote their organization into an Equal\r\nRights Association. Not to be sidetracked, she then asked the woman's\r\nrights convention to broaden its platform to include rights for the\r\nNegro. To her this seemed a natural development as she had always\r\nthought of woman's rights as part of the larger struggle for human\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\"For twenty years,\" she declared, \"we have pressed the claims of women\r\nto the right of representation in the government.... Up to this hour\r\nwe have looked only to State action for the recognition of our rights;\r\nbut now by the results of the war, the whole question of suffrage\r\nreverts back to the United States Constitution. The duty of Congress\r\nat this moment is to declare what shall be the basis of representation\r\nin a republican form of government.\r\n\r\n\"There is, there can be, but one true basis,\" she continued. \"Taxation\r\nand representation must be inseparable; hence our demand must now go\r\nbeyond woman.... We therefore wish to broaden our woman's rights\r\nplatform and make it in name what it has ever been in spirit, a human\r\nrights platform.\"[178]\r\n\r\nThe women, so often accused in later years of fighting only for their\r\nown rights, had the courage at this time to attempt a practical\r\nexperiment in generosity. Susan and Mrs. Stanton with all their hearts\r\nwanted this experiment to succeed, and yet as they resolved their\r\nwoman's rights organization into the American Equal Rights\r\nAssociation, they were apprehensive.\r\n\r\nThey did not have to wait long for disillusionment. Meeting Wendell\r\nPhillips and Theodore Tilton in the office of the _Antislavery\r\nStandard_ to plan a campaign for the Equal Rights Association, they\r\ndiscussed with them what should be done in New York, preparatory to\r\nthe revision of the state constitution. Emphatically Wendell Phillips\r\ndeclared that the time was ripe for striking the word \"white\" out of\r\nthe constitution, but not the word \"male.\" That could come, he added,\r\nwhen the constitution was next revised, some twenty or thirty years\r\nlater. To their astonishment, Theodore Tilton heartily agreed. Then he\r\nadded, \"The question of striking out the word 'male,' we as an equal\r\nrights association shall of course present as an intellectual theory,\r\nbut not as a practical thing to be accomplished at this convention.\"\r\nCompletely unprepared for such an attitude on Tilton's part, Susan\r\nretorted with indignation, \"I would sooner cut off my right hand than\r\nask for the ballot for the black man and not for woman.\" Then telling\r\nthe two men just what she thought of them for their betrayal of women,\r\nshe swept out of the office to keep another appointment.[179]\r\n\r\nEqually exasperated with these men, Mrs. Stanton stayed on, hoping to\r\nheal the breach, but when Susan returned to the Stanton home that\r\nevening, she found her highly indignant, declaring she was through\r\nboosting the Negro over her own head. Then and there they vowed that\r\nthey would devote themselves with all their might and main to woman\r\nsuffrage and to that alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy this time, Congress had passed a civil rights bill over President\r\nJohnson's veto, conferring the rights of citizenship upon freedmen,\r\nand a Fourteenth Amendment to make these rights permanent was now\r\nbefore Congress. The latest developments regarding the various drafts\r\nof the Fourteenth Amendment were passed along to Susan and Mrs.\r\nStanton by Robert Dale Owen. Senator Sumner, he reported, had yielded\r\nto party pressure and now supported the Fourteenth Amendment, although\r\nin the past he had always maintained such an amendment wholly\r\nunnecessary since there was already enough justice, liberty, and\r\nequality in the Constitution to protect the humblest citizen. Senator\r\nSumner opposed and defeated a clause in the amendment referring to\r\n\"race\" and \"color,\" words which had never previously been mentioned\r\nin the Constitution, but he raised no serious objection to the\r\nintroduction of the word \"male\" as a qualification for suffrage, which\r\nwas also unprecedented. That he tried time and time again to avoid the\r\nword \"male\" when he was redrafting the amendment or that Thaddeus\r\nStevens tried to substitute \"legal voters\" for \"male citizens\" was no\r\ncomfort to Susan and Mrs. Stanton, as they saw the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment writing discrimination against women into the federal\r\nConstitution for the first time.[180]\r\n\r\nAs they carefully read over the first section of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment, which conferred citizenship on every person born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States, women's rights seemed assured:\r\n\r\n     \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and\r\n     subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the\r\n     United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State\r\n     shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\r\n     privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;\r\n     nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or\r\n     property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person\r\n     within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nThen in the controversial second section which provided the penalty of\r\nreduction of representation in Congress for states depriving Negroes\r\nof the ballot, they saw themselves written out of the Constitution by\r\nthe words, \"male inhabitants\" and \"male citizens,\" used to define\r\nlegal voters. It was baffling to be kept from their goal by a single\r\nword in a provision which at best was the unsatisfactory compromise\r\narrived at by radical and conservative Republicans and which sincere\r\nabolitionists felt was unfair to the Negro. That it was unfair to\r\nwomen, there was no doubt.\r\n\r\nWith determination, Susan and Mrs. Stanton fought this injustice. Were\r\nthey not \"persons born ... in the United States,\" they asked. Were\r\nthey forever to be regarded as children or as lower than persons,\r\nalong with criminals, idiots, and the insane? Were women not counted\r\nin the basis of representation and should they not have a voice in the\r\nelection of those representatives whose office their numbers helped to\r\nestablish?\r\n\r\nAs Susan studied the Constitution, she saw that the question of\r\nsuffrage had up to this time been left to the states and that there\r\nwere no provisions defining suffrage or citizenship or limiting the\r\nright of suffrage. Only now was the precedent being broken by the\r\nFourteenth Amendment which conferred citizenship on Negroes and\r\nlimited suffrage to males. How could this be constitutional, she\r\nreasoned, when the first lines of the Constitution read, \"We, the\r\npeople of the United States, in order to ... establish justice ... and\r\nsecure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do\r\nordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of\r\nAmerica.\" Of course \"the people\" must include women, if the English\r\nlanguage meant what it said.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment with the limiting word \"male\" was passed by\r\nCongress and referred to the states for ratification in June 1866. As\r\nnever before, Susan felt the curse of the tradition of the\r\nunimportance of women. Once more politicians and reformers had ignored\r\nwomen's inherent rights as human beings. In spite of women's\r\nintelligence and their wartime service to their country, no statesman\r\nof power or vision felt it at all necessary to include women under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment's broad term of \"persons.\" Yet according to\r\nstatements made in later years by John A. Bingham and Roscoe Conkling,\r\nboth sponsors of the amendment and concerned with its drafting, the\r\npossibility was considered of protecting corporations and the property\r\nof individuals from the interference of state and municipal\r\nlegislation, through the federal control extended by this amendment.\r\nAt any rate, they wrought well for the corporations which have\r\nreceived abundant protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, along\r\nwith all male citizens, while women were left outside the pale.[181]\r\n\r\nTactfully the Republicans explained to women that even Negro suffrage\r\ncould not be definitely spelled out in the Fourteenth Amendment, if it\r\nwere to be accepted by the people; and added that Negro suffrage was\r\nall the strain that the Republican party could bear at this time; but\r\nneither Susan nor Mrs. Stanton were fooled by this sophistry. They\r\nknew that Republican politicians saw in the Negro vote in the South\r\nthe means of keeping their party in power for a long time to come, and\r\ncould entirely overlook justice to Negro women since they were assured\r\nof enough votes without them. The women of the North need not be\r\nconsidered, since they had nothing to offer politically. They would\r\nvote, it was thought, just as their husbands voted.\r\n\r\nCompletely deserted by all their former friends in the Republican\r\nparty, Susan and Mrs. Stanton now made use of an irregular Republican,\r\nSenator Cowan of Pennsylvania, whom the abolitionists had labeled \"the\r\nwatchdog of slavery.\" When Benjamin Wade's bill \"to enfranchise each\r\nand every male person\" in the District of Columbia \"without any\r\ndistinction on account of color or race,\" was discussed on the Senate\r\nfloor in December 1866, Senator Cowan offered an amendment striking\r\nout the word \"male\" and thus leaving the door open for women. He\r\nstated the case for woman suffrage well and with eloquence, and\r\nalthough he was accused of being insincere and wishing merely to cloud\r\nthe issue, he forced the Republicans to show their hands. In the\r\nthree-day debate which followed, Senator Wilson of Massachusetts\r\ndeclared emphatically that he was opposed to connecting the two\r\nissues, woman and Negro suffrage, but would at any time support a\r\nseparate bill for woman's enfranchisement. Senator Pomeroy of Kansas\r\nobjected to jeopardizing the chances of Negro suffrage by linking it\r\nwith woman suffrage, but Senator Wade of Ohio boldly expressed his\r\napproval of woman suffrage, even casting a vote for Senator Cowan's\r\namendment, as did B. Gratz Brown of Missouri. In the final vote, nine\r\nvotes were counted for woman suffrage and thirty-seven against.[182]\r\n\r\nSusan recorded even this defeat as progress, for woman suffrage had\r\nfor the first time been debated in Congress and prominent Senators had\r\ntreated it with respect. The Republican press, however, was showing\r\ndefinite signs of disapproval, even Horace Greeley's New York\r\n_Tribune_. Almost unbelieving, she read Greeley's editorial, \"A Cry\r\nfrom the Females,\" in which he said, \"Talk of a true woman needing the\r\nballot as an accessory of power when she rules the world with the\r\nglance of an eye.\" With the Democratic press as always solidly against\r\nwoman suffrage and the _Antislavery Standard_ avoiding the subject as\r\nif it did not exist, no words favorable to votes for women now reached\r\nthe public.[183]\r\n\r\nIt was hard for Susan to forgive the _Antislavery Standard_ for what\r\nshe regarded as a breach of trust. Financed by the Hovey Fund, it owed\r\nallegiance, she believed, to women as well as the Negro. In protest\r\nParker Pillsbury resigned his post as editor, but among the leading\r\nmen in the antislavery ranks, only he, Samuel J. May, James Mott, and\r\nRobert Purvis, the cultured, wealthy Philadelphia Negro, were willing\r\nto support Susan and Mrs. Stanton in their campaign for woman suffrage\r\nat this time. The rest aligned themselves unquestioningly with the\r\nRepublicans, although in the past they had always been distrustful of\r\npolitical parties.\r\n\r\nDiscouraging as this was for Susan, their influence upon the\r\nantislavery women was far more alarming. These women one by one\r\ntemporarily deserted the woman's rights cause, persuaded that this was\r\nthe Negro's hour and that they must be generous, renounce their own\r\nclaims, and work only for the Negroes' civil and political rights.\r\nLess than a dozen remained steadfast, among them Lucretia Mott, Martha\r\nC. Wright, Ernestine Rose, and for a time Lucy Stone, who wrote John\r\nGreenleaf Whittier in January 1867, \"You know Mr. Phillips takes the\r\nground that this is 'the Negro's hour,' and that the women, if not\r\ncriminal, are at least, not wise to urge their own claim. Now, so sure\r\nam I that he is mistaken and that the only name given, by which the\r\ncountry can be saved, is that of WOMAN, that I want to ask you ... to\r\nuse your influence to induce him to reconsider the position he has\r\ntaken. He is the only man in the nation to whom has been given the\r\ncharm which compels all men, willing or unwilling, to listen when he\r\nspeaks ... Mr. Phillips used to say, 'take your part with the perfect\r\nand abstract right, and trust God to see that it shall prove\r\nexpedient.'

She\r\ncarried to the New York legislature early in 1867 her objections to\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment in a petition from the American Equal Rights\r\nAssociation, signed by Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell, Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton, and herself. People generally were critical of the amendment,\r\nmany fearing it would too readily reinstate rebels as voters, and she\r\nhoped to block ratification by capitalizing on this dissatisfaction.\r\nShe saw no disloyalty to Negroes in this, for she regarded the\r\namendment as \"utterly inadequate.\"[185]\r\n\r\nThis protest made, she turned her attention to New York's\r\nconstitutional convention, which provided an unusual opportunity for\r\nwriting woman suffrage into the new constitution. First she sought an\r\ninterview with Horace Greeley, hoping to regain his support which was\r\nmore important than ever since he had been chosen a delegate to this\r\nconvention. When she and Mrs. Stanton asked him for space in the\r\n_Tribune_ to advocate woman suffrage as well as Negro suffrage, he\r\nemphatically replied, \"No! You must not get up any agitation for that\r\nmeasure.... Help us get the word 'white' out of the constitution. This\r\nis the Negro's hour.... Your turn will come next.\"[186]\r\n\r\nConvinced that this was also woman's hour, Susan disregarded his\r\nopinions and his threats and circulated woman suffrage petitions in\r\nall parts of the state. She won the support of the handsome, highly\r\nrespected George William Curtis, now editor of _Harper's Magazine_ and\r\nalso a convention delegate, and of the popular Henry Ward Beecher and\r\nGerrit Smith. The sponsorship of the cause by these men helped\r\nmightily. New York women sent in petitions with hundreds of\r\nsignatures, but the Republican party was at work, cracking its whip,\r\nand Horace Greeley was appointed chairman of the committee on the\r\nright of suffrage.\r\n\r\nBoth Susan and Mrs. Stanton spoke at the constitutional convention's\r\nhearing on woman suffrage, Susan with her usual forthrightness\r\nanswering the many questions asked by the delegates, spreading\r\nconsternation among them by declaring that women would eventually\r\nserve as jurors and be drafted in time of war. Assuming women unable\r\nto bear arms for their country, the delegates smugly linked the ballot\r\nand the bullet together, and Horace Greeley gleefully asked the two\r\nwomen, \"If you vote, are you ready to fight?\" Instantly, Susan\r\nreplied, \"Yes, Mr. Greeley, just as you fought in the late war--at the\r\npoint of a goose quill.\" Then turning to the other delegates, she\r\nreminded them that several hundred women, disguised as men, had fought\r\nin the Civil War, and instead of being honored for their services and\r\npaid, they had been discharged in disgrace.[187]\r\n\r\nConfident that Horace Greeley would sooner or later fall back on his\r\noft-repeated, trite remark, \"The best women I know do not want to\r\nvote,\" Susan had asked Mrs. Greeley to roll up a big petition in\r\nWestchester County, and believing heartily in woman suffrage she had\r\ncomplied. This gave Susan and Mrs. Stanton a trump card to play,\r\nshould Horace Greeley present an adverse report as they were informed\r\nhe would do.[188]\r\n\r\nIn Albany to hear the report, these two conspirators gloated over\r\ntheir plan as they surveyed the packed galleries and noted the many\r\nreporters who would jump at a bit of spicy news to send their papers.\r\nJust before Horace Greeley was to give his report, George William\r\nCurtis announced with dignity and assurance, \"Mr. President, I hold in\r\nmy hand a petition from Mrs. Horace Greeley and 300 other women,\r\ncitizens of Westchester, asking that the word 'male' be stricken from\r\nthe Constitution.\"[189]\r\n\r\nRipples of amusement ran through the audience, and reporters hastily\r\ntook notes, as Horace Greeley, the top of his head red as a beet,\r\nlooked up with anger at the galleries, and then in a thin squeaky\r\nvoice and with as much authority as he could muster declared, \"Your\r\ncommittee does not recommend an extension of the elective franchise to\r\nwomen....\" As a result, New York's new constitution enfranchised only\r\nmale citizens.[190]\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley justified his opposition to woman suffrage in a letter\r\nto Moncure D. Conway: \"The keynote of my political creed is the axiom\r\nthat 'Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned....' I sought information from different quarters ... and\r\npractically all agreed in the conclusion that _the women of our state\r\ndo not choose to vote_. Individuals do, at least three fourths of the\r\nsex do not. I accepted their choice as decisive; just as I reported in\r\nfavor of enfranchising the Blacks because they do wish to vote. The\r\nfew may not; but the many do; and I think they should control the\r\nsituation.... It seems but fair to add that female suffrage seems to\r\nme to involve the balance of the family relation as it has hitherto\r\nexisted....\"[191]\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley never forgave Susan and Mrs. Stanton for humiliating\r\nhim in the constitutional convention or for the headlines in the\r\nevening papers which coupled his adverse report with his wife's\r\npetition. When they met again in New York a few weeks later at one of\r\nAlice Cary's popular evening receptions, he ignored their friendly\r\ngreeting and brusquely remarked, \"You two ladies are the most\r\nmaneuvering politicians in the State of New York.\"[192]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Susan's work in New York State was at its height, appeals for\r\nhelp had reached her from Republicans in Kansas, where in November\r\n1867 two amendments would be voted upon, enfranchising women and\r\nNegroes. Unable to go to Kansas herself at that time or to spare\r\nElizabeth Stanton, she rejoiced when Lucy Stone consented to speak\r\nthroughout Kansas and when she and Lucy, as trustees of the Jackson\r\nFund, outvoting Wendell Phillips, were able to appropriate $1,500 for\r\nthis campaign.\r\n\r\nLucy was soon sending enthusiastic reports to Susan from Kansas, where\r\nshe and her husband, Henry Blackwell, were winning many friends for\r\nthe cause. \"I fully expect we shall carry the State,\" Lucy confidently\r\nwrote Susan. \"The women here are grand, and it will be a shame past\r\nall expression if they don't get the right to vote.... But the Negroes\r\nare all against us.... These men _ought not to be allowed to vote\r\nbefore we do_, because they will be just so much dead weight to\r\nlift.\"[193]\r\n\r\nOne cloud now appeared on the horizon. Republicans in Kansas began to\r\nwithdraw their support from the woman suffrage amendment they had\r\nsponsored. It troubled Lucy and Susan that the New York _Tribune_ and\r\nthe _Independent_, both widely read in Kansas, published not one word\r\nfavorable to woman suffrage, for these two papers with their influence\r\nand prestige could readily, they believed, win the ballot for women\r\nnot only in Kansas but throughout the nation. Soon the temper of the\r\nRepublican press changed from indifference to outright animosity,\r\nstriking at Lucy and Henry Blackwell by calling them \"free lovers,\"\r\nbecause Lucy was traveling with her husband as Lucy Stone and not as\r\nMrs. Henry B. Blackwell. Still Lucy was hopeful, believing the\r\nDemocrats were ready to take them up, but she reminded Susan, \"It will\r\nbe necessary to have a good force here in the fall, and you will have\r\nto come.\"\r\n\r\nNever for a moment did the importance of this election in Kansas\r\nescape Susan, and her estimate of it was also that of John Stuart\r\nMill, who wrote from England to the sponsor of the Kansas woman\r\nsuffrage amendment, Samuel N. Wood, \"If your citizens next November\r\ngive effect to the enlightened views of your Legislature, history will\r\nremember one of the youngest states in the civilized world has been\r\nthe first to adopt a measure of liberation destined to extend all over\r\nthe earth and to be looked back to ... as one of the most fertile in\r\nbeneficial consequences of all improvements yet effected in human\r\naffairs.\"[194]\r\n\r\nSusan fully expected Kansas to pioneer for woman suffrage just as it\r\nhad taken its stand against slavery when the rest of the country held\r\nback. Her first problem, however, was to raise the money to get\r\nherself and Elizabeth Stanton there. The grant from the Jackson Fund\r\nhad been spent by the Blackwells and Olympia Brown of Michigan, who\r\nmost providentially volunteered to continue their work when they\r\nreturned to the East. Olympia Brown, recently graduated from Antioch\r\nCollege and ordained as a minister in the Universalist church, was a\r\nnew recruit to the cause. Young and indefatigable, she reached every\r\npart of Kansas during the summer, driving over the prairies with the\r\nSinging Hutchinsons.[195]\r\n\r\nOlympia Brown's valiant help made waiting in New York easier for Susan\r\nas she tried in every way to raise money. Further grants from the\r\nJackson Fund were cut off by an unfavorable court decision; and the\r\ntrustees of the Hovey Fund, established to further the rights of both\r\nNegroes and women, refused to finance a woman suffrage campaign in\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\n\"We are left without a dollar,\" she wrote State Senator Samuel N.\r\nWood. \"Every speaker who goes to Kansas must _now pay her own_\r\nexpenses out of her own private purse, unless money should come from\r\nsome unexpected source. I shall run the risk--as I told you--and draw\r\nupon almost my last hundred to go. I tell you this that you may not\r\ncontract _debts_ under the impression that _our_ Association can pay\r\nfor them--_for it cannot_.\"[196]\r\n\r\nShe did find a way to finance the printing of leaflets so urgently\r\nneeded for distribution in Kansas. Soliciting advertisements up and\r\ndown Broadway during the heat of July and August, she collected enough\r\nto pay the printer for 60,000 tracts, with the result that along with\r\nthe dignified, eloquent speeches of Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore\r\nParker, George William Curtis, and John Stuart Mill went\r\nadvertisements of Howe sewing machines, Mme. Demorest's millinery and\r\npatterns, Browning's washing machines, and Decker pianofortes to\r\nattract the people of Kansas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith both New York and Kansas on her mind, Susan had had little time\r\nto be with her family, although she had often longed to slip out to\r\nRochester for a visit with her mother and Guelma who had been ill for\r\nseveral months. Finally she spent a few days with them on her way to\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nOn the long train journey from Rochester to Kansas with such a\r\ncongenial companion as Elizabeth Stanton, she enjoyed every new\r\nexperience, particularly the new Palace cars advertised as the finest,\r\nmost luxurious in the world, costing $40,000 each. The comfortable\r\ndaytime seats transformed into beds at night and the meals served by\r\nsolicitous Negro waiters were of the greatest interest to these two\r\ngood housekeepers and the last bit of comfort they were to enjoy for\r\nmany a day.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached Kansas, they set out immediately on a two-week\r\nspeaking tour of the principal towns, and as usual Susan starred Mrs.\r\nStanton while she herself acted as general manager, advertising the\r\nmeetings, finding a suitable hall, sweeping it out if necessary,\r\ndistributing and selling tracts, and perhaps making a short speech\r\nherself. The meetings were highly successful, but traveling by stage\r\nand wagon was rugged; most of the food served them was green with soda\r\nor floating in grease and the hotels were infested with bedbugs. Susan\r\nwrote her family of sleepless nights and of picking the \"tormentors\"\r\nout of their bonnets and the ruffles of their dresses.[197]\r\n\r\nOccasionally there was an oasis of cleanliness and good food, as when\r\nthey stopped at the railroad hotel in Salina and found it run by\r\nMother Bickerdyke, who, marching through Georgia with General Sherman,\r\nhad nursed and fed his soldiers. At such times Kansas would take on a\r\nrosy glow and Susan could report, \"We are getting along splendidly.\r\nJust the frame of a Methodist Church with sidings and roof, and rough\r\ncottonwood boards for seats, was our meeting place last night ...; and\r\na perfect jam it was, with men crowded outside at all the windows....\r\nOur tracts do more than half the battle; reading matter is so very\r\nscarce that everybody clutches at a book of any kind.... All that\r\ngreat trunk full were sold and given away at our first 14 meetings,\r\nand we in return received $110 which a little more than paid our\r\nrailroad fare--eight cents per mile--and hotel bills. Our collections\r\nthus far fully equal those at the East. I have been delightfully\r\ndisappointed for everybody said I couldn't raise money in Kansas\r\nmeetings.\"[198]\r\n\r\nThe reputation of both women preceded them to Kansas. Susan had to win\r\nher way against prejudice built up by newspaper gibes of past years\r\nwhich had caricatured her as a meddlesome reformer and a sour old\r\nmaid, but gradually her friendliness, hominess, and sincerity broke\r\ndown these preconceptions. Kansas soon respected this tall slender\r\nenergetic woman who, as she overrode obstacles, showed a spirit akin\r\nto that of the frontiersman.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton, on the other hand, was welcomed at once with enthusiasm.\r\nThe fact that she was the mother of seven children as well as a\r\nbrilliant orator opened the way for her. She was good to look at, a\r\nqueenly woman at fifty-two, with a fresh rosy complexion and carefully\r\ncurled soft white hair. Her motherliness and refreshing sense of humor\r\nbuilt up a bond of understanding with her audiences. People were eager\r\nto see her, hear her, talk with her, and entertain her.\r\n\r\nThis preference was obvious to Susan, but it aroused no jealousy. She\r\nsent Mrs. Stanton out through the state by mule team to all the small\r\ntowns and settlements far from the railroad, along with their popular\r\nand faithful Republican ally, Charles Robinson, first Free State\r\nGovernor of Kansas, counting on these two to build up good will. In\r\nthe meantime, making her headquarters in Lawrence, she reorganized the\r\ncampaign to meet the increasing opposition of the Republican machine,\r\nagainst which the continued support of a few prominent Kansas\r\nRepublicans availed little. As the state was predominantly Republican,\r\nthe prospects were gloomy, for the Democrats had not yet taken them up\r\nas Lucy Stone had predicted, but still opposed both the Negro and\r\nwoman suffrage amendments. A new liquor law, which it was thought\r\nwomen would support, further complicated the situation, aligning the\r\nliquor interests and the German and Irish settlers solidly against\r\nvotes for women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Susan was searching desperately for some way of appealing to the\r\nDemocrats, help came from an unexpected source. The St. Louis Suffrage\r\nAssociation urged George Francis Train to come to the aid of women in\r\nKansas, and always ready to champion a new and unpopular cause, he\r\ntelegraphed his willingness to win the Democratic vote and pay his own\r\nexpenses. Knowing little about him except that he was wealthy,\r\neccentric, and interested in developing the Union Pacific Railroad,\r\nSusan turned tactfully to her Kansas friends for advice, although she\r\nherself welcomed his help. They wired him, \"The people want you, the\r\nwomen want you\";[199] and he came into the state in a burst of glory,\r\nspeaking first in Leavenworth and Lawrence to large curious audiences.\r\nA tall handsome man with curly brown hair and keen gray eyes, flashily\r\ndressed in a blue coat with brass buttons, white vest, black trousers,\r\npatent-leather boots, and lavender kid gloves, he was a sight worth\r\ndriving miles to see, and he gave his audiences the best entertainment\r\nthey had had in many a day, shouting jingles at them in the midst of\r\nhis speeches and mercilessly ridiculing the Republicans. Here was none\r\nof the boredom of most political speeches, none of the long sonorous\r\nsentences with classical allusions which the big-name orators of the\r\nday poured out. His bold statements, his clipped rapid-fire sentences\r\nheld the people's attention whether they agreed with him or not. When\r\nhe spoke in Leavenworth, the hall was packed with Irishmen who were\r\nbuilding the railroad to the West. They hissed when he mentioned woman\r\nsuffrage, but before long he had won them over and they cheered when\r\nhe shook his finger at them and shouted, \"Every man in Kansas who\r\nthrows a vote for the Negro and not for women has insulted his mother,\r\nhis daughter, his sister, and his wife.\"[200]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George Francis Train]\r\n\r\nAt once the Republican press began a campaign of vilification, calling\r\nTrain a Copperhead and ridiculing his eccentricities and conceits; and\r\neastern Republicans, fearing they had harmed the Negro amendment in\r\nKansas by their opposition to woman suffrage, tried to make\r\nlast-minute amends by sending an appeal to Kansas voters to support\r\nboth amendments. Even Horace Greeley lamely supported them in a\r\n_Tribune_ editorial which Susan read with disgust: \"It is plain that\r\nthe experiment of Female Suffrage is to be tried; and, while we regard\r\nit with distrust, we are quite willing to see it pioneered by Kansas.\r\nShe is a young State, and has a memorable history, wherein her women\r\nhave borne an honorable part.... If, then, a majority of them really\r\ndesire to vote, we, if we lived in Kansas, should vote to give them\r\nthe opportunity. Upon a full and fair trial, we believe they would\r\nconclude that the right of suffrage for women was, on the whole,\r\nrather a plague than a profit, and vote to resign it into the hands of\r\ntheir husbands and fathers....\"[201]\r\n\r\nThese halfhearted appeals were too late, for the political machine in\r\nKansas had already done its work; and Susan, turning her back on such\r\nfair-weather friends, cultivated the Democrats even more sedulously.\r\nWhen the Democrat who had promised to accompany George Francis Train\r\non a speaking tour failed him, she took his place. When Train demurred\r\nat the strenuous task ahead, she announced she would undertake it\r\nalone. Always the gallant gentleman, he accompanied her, and continued\r\nwith her through the long hard weeks of travel in mail and lumber\r\nwagons over rough roads, through mud and rain, to the remotest\r\nsettlements, far from the railroads. Because it was a necessity,\r\ntraveling alone with a gentleman whom she hardly knew troubled her not\r\nat all, unconventional though it was.\r\n\r\nShe took charge of the meetings, opening them herself with a short\r\nsincere plea for both the woman and Negro suffrage amendments, and\r\nthen she introduced George Francis Train, who, no matter how late they\r\narrived or how tiring the day, had changed his wrinkled gray traveling\r\nsuit for his resplendent platform costume. The expectant crowd never\r\nfailed to respond with a gasp of surprise, and immediately the fun\r\nbegan as Train with his wit and his mimicry entertained them, calling\r\nfor their support of woman suffrage and advocating as well some of his\r\nown pet ideas, such as freeing Ireland from British oppression, paying\r\nour national debt in greenbacks, establishing an eight-hour day in\r\nindustry, and even nominating himself for President.\r\n\r\nAmused by his dramatics and often amazed at his conceit, Susan found\r\nneither as objectionable as the outright falsehood circulated by\r\nopponents of woman suffrage. As the days went by with their continued\r\nhardships and increasing fatigue, she marveled at his unfailing\r\ncourteousness, his pluck, and good cheer, while he in turn admired her\r\ncourage, her endurance, and her zeal for her cause, and between them a\r\nbond of respect and loyalty was built up which could not be destroyed\r\nby the pressures of later years.\r\n\r\nDuring the long hours on the road, he entertained her with the story\r\nof his life and his travels, an adventure story of a poor boy who had\r\nmade good. Building clipper ships, introducing American goods in\r\nAustralia, traveling in India, China, and Russia, promoting street\r\nrailways in England, and now building the Union Pacific, he had a\r\nwealth of information to impart.\r\n\r\nTheir views on the Negro differed sharply. Rating the whole race as\r\ninferior and incapable of improvement, he naturally opposed\r\nenfranchising Negroes before women. She, on the other hand, had always\r\nregarded Negroes as her equals, and in campaigning with Train, she had\r\nto make her choice between Negroes and women. She chose women, just as\r\nher abolitionist friends in the East had chosen the Negro; and their\r\nindifference and opposition to woman suffrage at this crucial time was\r\nas unforgivable to her as was his valuation of the Negro to them. They\r\ncalled him a Copperhead, remembering his southern wife and his hatred\r\nof abolitionists, his vocal resistance to the draft, and his demands\r\nfor immediate unconditional peace. They ignored entirely his defense\r\nof the Union in England during the Civil War when he publicly debated\r\nwith Englishmen who supported the Confederacy. They abused him in\r\ntheir newspapers and he, not to be outdone, ridiculed them in his\r\nspeeches, shouting, \"Where is Wendell Phillips, today? Lost caste\r\neverywhere. Inconsistent in all things, cowardly in this. Where is\r\nHorace Greeley in this Kansas war for liberty? Pitching the woman\r\nsuffrage idea out of the Convention and bailing out Jeff Davis. Where\r\nis William Lloyd Garrison? Being patted on the shoulders by his\r\nemployers, our enemies abroad, for his faithful work in trying to\r\ndestroy our nation. Where is Henry Ward Beecher? Writing a story for\r\nBonner's Ledger....\"[202]\r\n\r\nThey never forgave him this estimate of them, nor did they forgive\r\nSusan for associating herself with him.\r\n\r\nOn one of the last days of the Kansas campaign, while she was driving\r\nover the prairie with him, he suddenly asked her why the woman\r\nsuffrage people did not have a paper of their own. \"Not lack of\r\nbrains, but lack of money,\" she tersely replied.[203]\r\n\r\nThey talked for a while about the good such a paper would do, about\r\nthe people who should edit and write for it, what name it should have.\r\nThen he said simply, \"I will give you the money.\"\r\n\r\nBecause a woman suffrage paper had been her cherished dream for so\r\nmany years, she did not dare regard this as more than a gallant\r\ngesture soon to be forgotten; but to her amazement that very evening\r\nshe heard Train announce to his audience, \"When Miss Anthony gets back\r\nto New York, she is going to start a woman suffrage paper. Its name is\r\nto be _The Revolution_: its motto, 'Men their rights, and nothing\r\nmore; women, their rights and nothing less.' This paper is to be a\r\nweekly, price $2. per year; its editors, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\r\nParker Pillsbury; its proprietor, Susan B. Anthony. Let everybody\r\nsubscribe for it!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElection day brought both Susan and Mrs. Stanton back to Leavenworth,\r\nto Daniel's home, to learn the verdict of the people of Kansas. As the\r\nreturns came in, their hope of seeing Kansas become the first woman\r\nsuffrage state quickly faded. Neither their amendment nor the Negroes'\r\npolled enough votes for adoption. Their woman suffrage amendment,\r\nhowever, received only 1,773 votes less than the Republican-sponsored\r\nNegro amendment, and to have accomplished this in a hard-fought bitter\r\ncampaign against powerful opponents gave them confidence in themselves\r\nand in their judgment of men and events. No longer need they depend\r\nupon Wendell Phillips or other abolitionist leaders for guidance. From\r\nnow on they would chart their own course. This led, they believed, to\r\nWashington, where they must gain support among members of Congress for\r\na federal woman suffrage amendment. Few, if any, Republicans would\r\nhelp them, but already one Democrat had come forward. George Francis\r\nTrain had offered to pay their expenses if they would join him on a\r\nlecture tour on their way East. To Susan, who had to raise every penny\r\nspent in her work, this seemed like an answer to prayer, as did his\r\nproposal to finance a woman suffrage paper for them.\r\n\r\nBy this time their abolitionist friends in the East were writing them\r\nindignant letters blaming the defeat of the Negro amendment on George\r\nFrancis Train and warning them not to link woman suffrage with an\r\nunbalanced charlatan. Even their devoted friends in Kansas, including\r\nGovernor Robinson, advised them against further association with\r\nTrain.\r\n\r\nThey did not make their decision lightly, nor was it easy to go\r\nagainst the judgment of respected friends, but of this they were\r\nconfident--that with or without Train, they would estrange most of\r\ntheir old friends if they campaigned for woman suffrage now. Without\r\nhim, their work, limited by lack of funds, would be ineffectual. With\r\nhis financial backing, they not only had the opportunity of spreading\r\ntheir message in all the principal cities on their way back to New\r\nYork, but had the promise of a paper, now so desperately needed when\r\nother news channels were closed to them. That Train was eccentric they\r\nagreed, and they also admitted that possibly some of his financial\r\ntheories were unsound. They believed he was ahead of his time when he\r\nadvocated the eight-hour day and the abolition of standing armies; but\r\nat least he looked forward, not backward. Susan had found him to be a\r\nman of high principles. She had heard him \"make speeches on woman's\r\nsuffrage that could be equalled only by John B. Gough,\"[204] the\r\nwell-known temperance crusader. Train's radical ideas did not disturb\r\nher. Her association with antislavery extremists prior to the Civil\r\nWar had made her impervious to the criticism and accusations of\r\nconservatives. She was aware that on this proposed lecture tour Train\r\nprobably wanted to make use of her executive ability and of Mrs.\r\nStanton's popularity as a speaker; but on the other hand, his\r\ngenerosity to them was beyond anything they had ever experienced.\r\n\r\nFor Susan there was only one choice--to work for woman suffrage with\r\nthe financial backing of Train. Mrs. Stanton agreed, and as she\r\nexpressed it, \"I have always found that when we see eye to eye, we are\r\nsure to be right, and when we pull together we are strong.... I take\r\nmy beloved Susan's judgment against the world.\"[205]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTraveling homeward with George Francis Train, Susan and Mrs. Stanton\r\nspoke in Chicago, St. Louis, Louisville, Cincinnati, Cleveland,\r\nBuffalo, Rochester, Boston, Hartford, and other important cities where\r\nthey drew large crowds, which had never before listened to a\r\ndiscussion of woman suffrage. Most of their old friends among the\r\nsuffragists and abolitionists shunned them, for they had been warned\r\nagainst this folly by their colleagues in the East. The lively\r\nmeetings rated plenty of publicity, complimentary in the Democratic\r\npapers but sarcastic and hostile in the Republican press. Usually\r\n\"Woman Suffrage\" got the headlines, but sometimes it was \"Woman\r\nSuffrage and Greenbacks\" or \"Train for President.\" Handbills, the\r\nprinting of which Susan supervised, scattered Train's rhymes and\r\nepigrams far and wide and carried a notice that the proceeds of all\r\nmeetings would be turned over to the woman's rights cause. Susan also\r\narranged for the printing of Train's widely distributed pamphlet, _The\r\nGreat Epigram Campaign of Kansas_, with this jingle, so\r\nuncomplimentary to the eastern abolitionists, on its cover:\r\n\r\n    The Garrisons, Phillipses, Greeleys, and Beechers,\r\n    False prophets, false guides, false teachers and preachers,\r\n    Left Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony, Brown, and Stone,\r\n    To fight the Kansas battle alone;\r\n    While your Rosses, Pomeroys, and your Clarkes\r\n    Stood on the fence, or basely fled,\r\n    While woman was saved by a Copperhead.\r\n\r\nEven more unforgivable than this to the abolitionist suffragists were\r\nthe back-page advertisements of a new woman-suffrage paper, _The\r\nRevolution_, and of woman's rights tracts which could be purchased\r\nfrom Susan B. Anthony, Secretary of the American Equal Rights\r\nAssociation. That Susan would presume to line up this organization in\r\nany way with George Francis Train aroused the indignation of Lucy\r\nStone, who felt the cause was being trailed in the dust. While Susan\r\nand Mrs. Stanton traveled homeward, enjoying the comfort of the best\r\nhotels and the applause of enthusiastic audiences, a coalition against\r\nthem was being formed in the East.\r\n\r\n\"All the old friends with scarce an exception are sure we are wrong,\"\r\nSusan wrote in her diary, January 1, 1868. \"Only time can tell, but I\r\nbelieve we are right and hence bound to succeed.\"[206]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[185] Ms., Petition, Jan. 9, 1867, Alma Lutz Collection\r\n\r\n[186] Ms., note, 1893, Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers, Library of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n[187] Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 278; _History of Woman Suffrage_, II,\r\np. 284.\r\n\r\n[188] Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 279.\r\n\r\n[189] _History of Woman Suffrage_, II, p. 287.

Dickinson, \"who shall do it? No man is able, for no man sees\r\nor feels as we do. To whom God gives the word, to him or her he says,\r\n'Go preach it.'\"[207]\r\n\r\nThis is just what Susan aimed to do in her new paper, _The\r\nRevolution_. It's name, she believed, expressed exactly the stirring\r\nup of thought necessary to establish justice for all--for women,\r\nNegroes, workingmen and-women, and all who were oppressed. Her two\r\neditors, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Parker Pillsbury, reliable friends\r\nas well as vivid forceful writers, were completely in sympathy with\r\nher own liberal ideas and could be counted on to crusade fearlessly\r\nfor every righteous cause. What did it matter if George Francis Train\r\nwanted space in the paper to publish his views and for a financial\r\ncolumn, edited by David M. Melliss of the New York _World_? Brought up\r\non the antislavery platform where free speech was the watchword and\r\nwhere all, even long-winded cranks, were allowed to express their\r\nopinions, Susan willingly opened the pages of _The Revolution_ to\r\nTrain and to Melliss in return for financial backing.\r\n\r\nWhen on January 8, 1868, the first issue of her paper came off the\r\npress, her heart swelled with pride and satisfaction as she turned\r\nover its pages, read its good editorials, and under the frank of\r\nDemocratic Congressman James Brooks of New York, sent out ten thousand\r\ncopies to all parts of the country.\r\n\r\n_The Revolution_ promised to discuss not only subjects which were of\r\nparticular concern to her and to Elizabeth Stanton, such as \"educated\r\nsuffrage, irrespective of sex or color,\" equal pay for women for equal\r\nwork, and practical education for girls as well as boys, but also the\r\neight-hour day, labor problems, and a new financial policy for\r\nAmerica. This new financial policy, the dream of George Francis Train,\r\nadvocated the purchase of American goods only; the encouragement of\r\nimmigration to rebuild the South and to settle the country from ocean\r\nto ocean; the establishment of the French financing systems, the\r\nCrédit Foncier and Crédit Mobilier, to develop our mines and\r\nrailroads; the issuing of greenbacks; and penny ocean postage \"to\r\nstrengthen the brotherhood of Labor.\"\r\n\r\nAll in all it was not a program with wide appeal. Dazzled by the\r\nopportunities for making money in this new undeveloped country, people\r\nwere in no mood to analyze the social order, or to consider the needs\r\nof women or labor or the living standards of the masses. Unfamiliar\r\nwith the New York Stock Exchange, they found little to interest them\r\nin the paper's financial department, while speculators and promoters,\r\nsuch as Jay Gould and Jim Fiske, wanted no advice from the lone eagle,\r\nGeorge Francis Train, and resented Melliss's columns of Wall Street\r\ngossip which often portrayed them in an unfavorable light. Nor did a\r\npublic-affairs paper edited and published by women carry much weight.\r\nNone of this, however, mattered much to Susan, who did not aim for a\r\npopular paper but \"to make public sentiment.\" It was her hope that\r\njust as the _Liberator_ under William Lloyd Garrison had been \"the\r\npillar of light and of fire to the slave's emancipation,\" so _The\r\nRevolution_ would become \"the guiding star to the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen.\"[208]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUpon Susan fell the task of building up subscriptions, soliciting\r\nadvertisements, and getting copy to the printer. As her office in the\r\nNew York _World_ building, 37 Park Row, was on the fourth floor and\r\nthe printer was several blocks away on the fifth floor of a building\r\nwithout an elevator, her job proved to be a test of physical\r\nendurance. To this was added an ever-increasing financial burden, for\r\nTrain had sailed for England when the first number was issued, had\r\nbeen arrested because of his Irish sympathies, and had spent months in\r\na Dublin jail, from which he sent them his thoughts on every\r\nconceivable subject but no money for the paper. He had left $600 with\r\nSusan and had instructed Melliss to make payments as needed, but this\r\nsoon became impossible, and she had to face the alarming fact that, if\r\nthe paper were to continue, she must raise the necessary money\r\nherself. Because the circulation was small, it was hard to get\r\nadvertisers, particularly as she was firm in her determination to\r\naccept only advertisements of products she could recommend. Patent\r\nmedicines and any questionable products were ruled out. Subscriptions\r\ncame in encouragingly but in no sense met the deficit which piled up\r\nunrelentingly. Her goal was 100,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nShe had gone to Washington at once to solicit subscriptions personally\r\nfrom the President and members of Congress. Ben Wade of Ohio headed\r\nthe list of Senators who subscribed, and loyal as always to woman\r\nsuffrage, encouraged her to go ahead and push her cause. \"It has got\r\nto come,\" he added, \"but Congress is too busy now to take it up.\"\r\nSenator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts greeted her gruffly, telling her\r\nthat she and Mrs. Stanton had done more to block reconstruction in the\r\nlast two years than all others in the land, but he subscribed because\r\nhe wanted to know what they were up to. Although Senator Pomeroy was\r\n\"sore about Kansas\" and her alliance with the Democrats, he\r\nnevertheless subscribed, but Senator Sumner was not to be seen. The\r\nfirst member of the House to put his name on her list was her\r\ndependable understanding friend, George Julian of Indiana, and many\r\nothers followed his lead. For two hours she waited to see President\r\nJohnson, in an anteroom \"among the huge half-bushel-measure spittoons\r\nand terrible filth ... where the smell of tobacco and whiskey was\r\npowerful.\" When she finally reached him, he immediately refused her\r\nrequest, explaining that he had a thousand such solicitations every\r\nday. Not easily put off, she countered at once by remarking that he\r\nhad never before had such a request in his life. \"You recognize, Mr.\r\nJohnson,\" she continued, \"that Mrs. Stanton and myself for two years\r\nhave boldly told the Republican party that they must give ballots to\r\nwomen as well as to Negroes, and by means of _The Revolution_ we are\r\nbound to drive the party to this logical conclusion or break it into a\r\nthousand pieces as was the old Whig party, unless we get our rights.\"\r\nThis \"brought him to his pocketbook,\" she triumphantly reported, and\r\nin a bold hand he signed his name, Andrew Johnson, as much as to say,\r\n\"Anything to get rid of this woman and break the radical party.\"[209]\r\n\r\nShe was proud of her paper, proud of its typography which was far more\r\nreadable than the average news sheets of the day with their miserably\r\nsmall print. The larger type and less crowded pages were inviting, the\r\narticles stimulating.\r\n\r\nParker Pillsbury, covering Congressional and political developments\r\nand the impeachment trial of President Johnson with which he was not\r\nin sympathy, was fearless in his denunciations of politicians, their\r\nruthless intrigue and disregard of the public. During the turbulent\r\ndays when the impeachment trial was front-page news everywhere, _The\r\nRevolution_ proclaimed it as a political maneuver of the Republicans\r\nto confuse the people and divert their attention from more important\r\nissues, such as corruption in government, high prices, taxation, and\r\nthe fabulous wealth being amassed by the few. This of course roused\r\nthe intense disapproval of Wendell Phillips, Theodore Tilton, and\r\nHorace Greeley, all of whom regarded Johnson as a traitor and shouted\r\nfor impeachment. It ran counter to the views of Susan's brother\r\nDaniel, who telegraphed Senator Ross of Kansas demanding his vote for\r\nimpeachment. Although no supporter of President Johnson, Susan was now\r\ncompletely awake to the political manipulations of the radical\r\nRepublicans and what seemed to her their readiness to sacrifice the\r\ngood of the nation for the success of their party. She repudiated them\r\nall--all but the rugged Ben Wade, always true to woman suffrage, and\r\nthe tall handsome Chief Justice, Salmon P. Chase, who, she believed,\r\nstood for justice and equality.\r\n\r\nBoth of these men Susan regarded as far better qualified for the\r\nPresidency than General Grant, who now was the obvious choice of the\r\nRepublicans for 1868. \"Why go pell-mell for Grant,\" asked _The\r\nRevolution_, \"when all admit that he is unfit for the position? It is\r\nnot too late, if true men and women will do their duty, to make an\r\nhonest man like Ben Wade, President. Let us save the Nation. As to the\r\nRepublican party the sooner it is scattered to the four winds of\r\nHeaven the better.\"[210] Later when Chase was out of the running among\r\nRepublicans and not averse to overtures from the Democrats, _The\r\nRevolution_ urged him as the Democratic candidate with universal\r\nsuffrage as his slogan.\r\n\r\nSusan demanded civil rights, suffrage, education, and farms for the\r\nNegroes as did the Republicans, but she could not overlook the\r\npolitical corruption which was flourishing under the military control\r\nof the South, and she recognized that the Republicans' insistence on\r\nNegro suffrage in the South did not stem solely from devotion to a\r\nnoble principle, but also from an overwhelming desire to insure\r\nvictory for their party in the coming election. These views were\r\nreflected editorially in _The Revolution_, which, calling attention\r\nto the fact that Connecticut, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and\r\nPennsylvania had refused to enfranchise their Negroes, asked why Negro\r\nsuffrage should be forced on the South before it was accepted in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was having hard sledding and _The Revolution_\r\nrepudiated it, calling instead for an amendment granting universal\r\nsuffrage, or in other words, suffrage for women and Negroes. _The\r\nRevolution_ also discussed in editorials by Mrs. Stanton other\r\nsubjects of interest to women, such as marriage, divorce,\r\nprostitution, and infanticide, all of which Susan agreed needed frank\r\nthoughtful consideration, but which other papers handled with kid\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\nIn still another unpopular field, that of labor and capital, _The\r\nRevolution_ also pioneered fearlessly, asking for shorter hours and\r\nlower wages for workers, as it pointed out labor's valuable\r\ncontribution to the development of the country. It also called\r\nattention to the vicious contrasts in large cities, where many lived\r\nin tumbledown tenements in abject poverty while the few, with more\r\nwealth than they knew what to do with, spent lavishly and built\r\nthemselves palaces.\r\n\r\nSentiments such as these increased the indignation of Susan's critics,\r\nbut she gloried in the output of her two courageous editors just as\r\nshe had gloried in the evangelistic zeal of the antislavery crusaders.\r\nWisely, however, she added to her list of contributors some of the\r\npopular women writers of the day, among them Alice and Phoebe Cary.\r\nShe ran a series of articles on women as farmers, machinists,\r\ninventors, and dentists, secured news from foreign correspondents,\r\nmostly from England, and published a Washington letter and woman's\r\nrights news from the states. Believing that women should become\r\nacquainted with the great women of the past, especially those who\r\nfought for their freedom and advancement, she printed an article on\r\nFrances Wright and serialized Mary Wollstonecraft's _A Vindication of\r\nthe Rights of Women_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEagerly Susan looked for favorable notices of her new paper in the\r\npress. Much to her sorrow, Horace Greeley's New York _Tribune_\r\ncompletely ignored its existence, as did her old standby, the\r\n_Antislavery Standard_. The New York _Times_ ridiculed as usual\r\nanything connected with woman's rights or woman suffrage. The New York\r\n_Home Journal_ called it \"plucky, keen, and wide awake, although some\r\nof its ways are not at all to our taste.\" Theodore Tilton in the\r\nCongregationalist paper, _The Independent_, commented in his usual\r\nfacetious style, which pinned him down neither to praise nor\r\nunfriendliness, but Susan was grateful to read, \"_The Revolution_ from\r\nthe start will arouse, thrill, edify, amuse, vex, and non-plus its\r\nfriends. But it will command attention: it will conquer a hearing.\"\r\nNewspapers were generally friendly. \"Miss Anthony's woman's rights\r\npaper,\" declared the Troy (New York) _Times_, \"is a realistic,\r\nwell-edited, instructive journal ... and its beautiful mechanical\r\nexecution renders its appearance very attractive.\" The Chicago\r\n_Workingman's Advocate_ observed, \"We have no doubt it will prove an\r\nable ally of the labor reform movement.\" Nellie Hutchinson of the\r\nCincinnati _Commercial_, one of the few women journalists, described\r\nsympathetically for her readers the neat comfortable _Revolution_\r\noffice and Susan with her \"rare\" but \"genial smile,\" Susan, \"the\r\ndetermined--the invincible ... destined to be Vice-President or\r\nSecretary of State...,\" adding, \"The world is better for thee,\r\nSusan.\"[211]\r\n\r\nWhile new friends praised, old friends pleaded unsuccessfully with\r\nMrs. Stanton and Parker Pillsbury to free themselves from Susan's\r\nharmful influence. William Lloyd Garrison wrote Susan of his regret\r\nand astonishment that she and Mrs. Stanton had so taken leave of their\r\nsenses as to be infatuated with the Democratic party and to be\r\nassociated with that \"crack-brained harlequin and semi-lunatic,\"\r\nGeorge Francis Train. She published his letter in _The Revolution_\r\nwith an answer by Mrs. Stanton which not only pointed out how often\r\nthe Republicans had failed women but reminded Garrison how he had\r\nwelcomed into his antislavery ranks anyone and everyone who believed\r\nin his ideas, \"a motley crew it was.\" She recalled the label of\r\nfanatic which had been attached to him, how he had been threatened and\r\npelted with rotten eggs for expressing his unpopular ideas and for\r\nburning the Constitution which he declared sanctioned slavery. With\r\nsuch a background, she told him, he should be able to recognize her\r\nright and Susan's to judge all parties and all men on what they did\r\nfor woman suffrage.[212]\r\n\r\nNone of these arguments made any impression upon Garrison, or upon\r\nLucy Stone, whose bitter criticism and distrust of Susan's motives\r\nwounded Susan deeply. Only a few of her old friends seemed able to\r\nunderstand what she was trying to do, among them Martha C. Wright,\r\nwho, at first critical of her association with Train, now wrote of\r\n_The Revolution_, \"Its vigorous pages are what we need. Count on me\r\nnow and ever as your true and unswerving friend.\"[213]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anna E. Dickinson]\r\n\r\nAnother bright spot was Susan's friendship with Anna E. Dickinson,\r\nwith whom she carried on a lively correspondence, scratching oft\r\nhurried notes to her on the backs of old envelopes or any odd scraps\r\nof paper that came to hand. Whenever Anna was in New York, she usually\r\nburst into the _Revolution_ office, showered Susan with kisses, and\r\ncarried on such an animated conversation about her experiences that\r\nthe whole office force was spellbound, admiring at the same time her\r\nstylish costume and jaunty velvet cap with its white feather, very\r\nbecoming on her short black curls.\r\n\r\nRepeatedly Susan urged Anna to stay with her in her \"plain quarters\"\r\nat 44 Bond Street or in her \"nice hall bedroom\" at 116 East\r\nTwenty-third Street. That Anna could have risen out of the hardships\r\nof her girlhood to such popularity as a lecturer and to such\r\nfinancial success was to Susan like a fairy tale come true. Scarcely\r\npast twenty, Anna not only had moved vast audiences to tears, but was\r\nsought after by the Republicans as one of their most popular campaign\r\nspeakers and had addressed Congress with President Lincoln in\r\nattendance. Susan had been sadly disappointed that Anna had not seen\r\nher way clear to speak a strong word for women in the Kansas campaign,\r\nbut she hoped that this vivid talented young woman would prove to be\r\n\"the evangel\" who would lead women \"into the kingdom of political and\r\ncivil rights.\" It never occurred to her that she herself might even\r\nnow be that \"evangel.\"[214]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy this time Susan had been called on the carpet by some of the\r\nofficers of the American Equal Rights Association because she had used\r\nthe Association's office as a base for business connected with the\r\nTrain lecture tour and the establishment of _The Revolution_. She was\r\nalso accused of spending the funds of the Association for her own\r\nprojects and to advertise Train. Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell, and\r\nStephen Foster were particularly suspicious of her. Her accounts were\r\nchecked and rechecked by them and found in good order. However, at the\r\nannual meeting of the Association in May 1868, Henry Blackwell again\r\nbrought the matter up. Deeply hurt by his public accusation, she once\r\nmore carefully explained that because there had been no funds except\r\nthose which came out of her own pocket or had been raised by her, she\r\nhad felt free to spend them as she thought best. This obviously\r\nsatisfied the majority, many of whom expressed appreciation of her\r\nyear of hard work for the cause. She later wrote Thomas Wentworth\r\nHigginson, \"Even if not one old friend had seemed to have remembered\r\nthe past and it had been swallowed up, overshadowed by the Train\r\ncloud, I should still have rejoiced that I have done the work--for no\r\n_human_ prejudice or power can rob me of the joy, the compensation, I\r\nhave stored up therefrom. That it is wholly spiritual, I need but tell\r\nyou that this day, I have not two hundred dollars more than I had the\r\nday I entered upon the public work of woman's rights and\r\nantislavery.\"[215]\r\n\r\nWhat troubled her most at these meetings was not the animosity\r\ndirected against her by Henry Blackwell and Lucy Stone, but the\r\nassertion, made by Frederick Douglass and agreed to by all the men\r\npresent, that Negro suffrage was more urgent than woman suffrage. When\r\nLucy Stone came to the defense of woman suffrage in a speech whose\r\ncontent and eloquence Susan thought surpassed that of \"any other\r\nmortal woman speaker,\" she was willing to forgive Lucy anything, and\r\nwrote Thomas Wentworth Higginson, \"I want you to _know_ that it is\r\nimpossible for me to lay a straw in the way of anyone who _personally\r\nwrongs me_, if only that one will work nobly in the _cause_ in their\r\nown way and time. They may try to hinder my success but I _never_\r\ntheirs.\"\r\n\r\nRealizing that it would be futile for her to spend any more time\r\ntrying to persuade the American Equal Rights Association to help her\r\nwith her woman suffrage campaign, she now formed a small committee of\r\nher own, headed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It included Elizabeth Smith\r\nMiller, the liberal wealthy daughter of Gerrit Smith, Abby Hopper\r\nGibbons, the Quaker philanthropist and social worker; and Mary Cheney\r\nGreeley, the wife of Horace Greeley, who, in spite of the fact that\r\nher husband now opposed woman suffrage, continued to take her stand\r\nfor it. This committee, with _The Revolution_ as its mouthpiece, was\r\nsoon acting as a clearing house for woman suffrage organizations\r\nthroughout the country and called itself the Woman's Suffrage\r\nAssociation of America.\r\n\r\nTo the national Republican convention in Chicago which nominated\r\nGeneral Grant for President, these women sent a carefully worded\r\nmemorial asking that the rights of women be recognized in the\r\nreconstruction. It was ignored. Thereupon Susan turned to the\r\nDemocrats, attending with Mrs. Stanton a preconvention rally in New\r\nYork, addressed by Governor Horatio Seymour. Given seats of honor on\r\nthe platform, they attracted considerable attention and the New York\r\n_Sun_ commented editorially that this honor conferred upon them by the\r\nDemocrats not only committed Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton to Governor\r\nSeymour's views but also committed the Democrats to incorporate a\r\nwoman suffrage plank in their platform.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for some of the officers of the American Equal\r\nRights Association, whose executive committee now adopted a sarcastic\r\nresolution proposing that Susan attend the national Democratic\r\nconvention and prove her confidence in the Democrats by securing a\r\nplank in their platform.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the unfriendly implications of this resolution and the\r\nridicule heaped upon her by the New York City papers, Susan made plans\r\nto attend the Democratic convention, which for the first time since\r\nthe war was bringing northern and southern Democrats together for the\r\ndedication of their new, imposing headquarters, Tammany Hall, and\r\nwhich was also attracting many liberals who, disgusted by the\r\ncorruption of the Republicans, were looking for a \"new departure\" from\r\nthe Democrats. To the amazement of the delegates, Susan with Mrs.\r\nStanton and several other women walked into the convention when it was\r\nwell under way and sent a memorial up to Governor Seymour who was\r\npresiding. He received it graciously, announcing that he held in his\r\nhand a memorial of the women of the United States signed by Susan B.\r\nAnthony, and then turned it over to the secretary to be read while the\r\naudience shouted and cheered. The sonorous passages demanding the\r\nenfranchisement of women rang out through and above the bedlam: \"We\r\nappeal to you because ... you have been the party heretofore to extend\r\nthe suffrage. It was the Democratic party that fought most valiantly\r\nfor the removal of the 'property qualification' from all white men and\r\nthereby placed the poorest ditch digger on a political level with the\r\nproudest millionaire.... And now you have an opportunity to confer a\r\nsimilar boon on the women of the country and thus ... perpetuate your\r\npolitical power for decades to come....\"[216]\r\n\r\nTo hear these words read in a national political convention was to\r\nSusan worth any ridicule she might be forced to endure. She was not\r\nallowed to speak to the convention as she had requested, and shouts\r\nand jeers continued as her memorial was hurriedly referred to the\r\nResolutions committee where it could be conveniently overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Republican press reported the incident with sarcasm and animosity,\r\nthe _Tribune_ deeply wounding her: \"Miss Susan B. Anthony has our\r\nsincere pity. She has been an ardent suitor of democracy, and they\r\nrejected her overtures yesterday with screams of laughter.\"[217]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats' nomination of Horatio Seymour and Frank Blair was as\r\nreactionary and unpromising of a \"new departure\" as was the choice of\r\nGeneral Grant and Schuyler Colfax by the Republicans. Thereupon _The\r\nRevolution_ called for a new party, a people's party which would be\r\nsincerely devoted to the welfare of all the people. So strongly did\r\nSusan feel about this that in one of her few signed editorials she\r\ndeclared, \"Both the great political parties pretending to save the\r\ncountry are only endeavoring to save themselves.... In their hands\r\nhumanity has no hope.... The sooner their power is broken as parties\r\nthe better.... _The Revolution_ calls for construction, not\r\nreconstruction.... Who will aid us in our grand enterprise of a\r\nnation's salvation?\"[218]\r\n\r\nTo \"darling Anna\" she wrote more specifically, \"Both parties are owned\r\nbody and soul by the _Gold Gamblers_ of the Nation--and so far as the\r\nhonest working men and women of the country are concerned, it matters\r\nvery little which succeeds. Oh that the Gods would inspire men of\r\ninfluence and money to move for a third party--universal suffrage and\r\nanti-monopolist of land and gold.\"[219]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[207] July 6, 1866, Anna E.

Women were being forced out of the home into the\r\nfactory by a changing and expanding economy, and at last were being\r\npaid for their work. However, the women she met on the streets of New\r\nYork, hurrying to work at dawn and returning late at night, weary,\r\npale, and shabbily dressed, had none of the confidence of the\r\neconomically independent. They had merely exchanged one form of\r\nslavery for another. She saw the ballot as their most powerful ally,\r\nand as she told the factory girls of Cohoes, New York, they could\r\ncompel their employers to grant them a ten-hour day, equal opportunity\r\nfor advancement, and equal pay, the moment they held the ballot in\r\ntheir hands.[220]\r\n\r\nAs yet labor unions were few and short-lived. The women tailors of New\r\nYork had formed a union as early as 1825, but it had not survived, and\r\nlater attempts to form women's unions had rarely been successful. A\r\nfew men's unions had weathered the years, but they had not enrolled\r\nwomen, fearing their competition. Women were welcomed only by the\r\nNational Labor Union, established in Baltimore in 1866 for the purpose\r\nof federating all unions.\r\n\r\nWhen the National Labor Union Congress met in New York in September\r\n1868, Susan saw an opportunity for women to take part, and in\r\npreparation she called a group of workingwomen together in _The\r\nRevolution_ office to form a Workingwomen's Association which she\r\nhoped would eventually represent all of the trades. At this meeting,\r\nthe majority were from the printing trade, typesetters operating the\r\nnewly invented typesetting machines, press feeders, bookbinders, and\r\nclerks, in whom she had become interested through her venture in\r\npublishing. She wanted them to call their organization the\r\nWorkingwomen's Suffrage Association, but they refused, because they\r\nfeared the public's disapproval of woman suffrage and were convinced\r\nthey should not seek political rights until they had improved their\r\nworking conditions. She could not make them see that they were\r\nputting the cart before the horse. They did, however, form\r\nWorkingwomen's Association No. 1, electing her their delegate to the\r\nNational Labor Congress.\r\n\r\nNext she called a meeting of the women in the sewing trades, and with\r\nthe help of men from the National Labor Union, persuaded a hundred of\r\nthem to form Workingwomen's Association No. 2. Most of these women\r\nwere seamstresses making men's shirts, women's coats, vests, lace\r\ncollars, hoop skirts, corsets, fur garments, and straw hats, but also\r\nrepresented were women from the umbrella, parasol, and paper collar\r\nindustry, metal burnishers, and saleswomen. Most of them were young\r\ngirls who worked from ten to fourteen hours a day, from six in the\r\nmorning until eight at night, and earned from $4 to $8 a week.\r\n\r\n\"You must not work for these starving prices any longer ...,\" Susan\r\ntold them. \"Have a spirit of independence among you, 'a wholesome\r\ndiscontent,' as Ralph Waldo Emerson has said, and you will get better\r\nwages for yourselves. Get together and discuss, and meet again and\r\nagain.... I will come and talk to you....\"[221] They elected Mrs. Mary\r\nKellogg Putnam to represent them at the National Labor Congress.\r\n\r\nWith Mrs. Putnam and Kate Mullaney, the able president of the Collar\r\nLaundry Union of Troy, New York, with Mary A. MacDonald of the Women's\r\nProtective Labor Union of Mt. Vernon, New York, and Mrs. Stanton,\r\nrepresenting the Woman's Suffrage Association of America, Susan\r\nknocked at the door of the National Labor Congress. All were welcomed\r\nbut Mrs. Stanton, who represented a woman suffrage organization and\r\nwhose acceptance the rank and file feared might indicate to the public\r\nthat the Labor Congress endorsed votes for women.\r\n\r\nThe women had a friend in William H. Sylvis of the Iron Molders'\r\nUnion, who was the driving force behind the National Labor Congress,\r\nand he made it clear at once that he welcomed Mrs. Stanton and\r\neveryone else who believed in his cause. So strong, however, was the\r\nopposition to woman suffrage among union men that eighteen threatened\r\nto resign if Mrs. Stanton were admitted as a delegate. The debate\r\ncontinued, giving Susan an opportunity to explain why the ballot was\r\nimportant to workingwomen. \"It is the power of the ballot,\" she\r\ndeclared, \"that makes men successful in their strikes.\"[222] She\r\nrecommended that both men and women be enrolled in unions, pointing\r\nout that had this been done, women typesetters would not have replaced\r\nmen at lower wages in the recent strike of printers on the New York\r\n_World_. Finally a resolution was adopted, making it clear that Mrs.\r\nStanton's acceptance in no way committed the National Labor Congress\r\nto her \"peculiar ideas\" or to \"Female Suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nA committee on female labor was then appointed with Susan as one of\r\nits members. At once she tried to show the committee how the vote\r\nwould help women in their struggle for higher wages. She had at hand a\r\nperfect example in the unsuccessful strike of Kate Mullaney's strong,\r\nwell-organized union of 500 collar laundry workers in Troy, New York.\r\nAware that Kate blamed their defeat on the ruthless newspaper\r\ncampaign, inspired and paid for by employers, Susan asked her, \"If you\r\nhad been 500 carpenters or 500 masons, do you not think you would have\r\nsucceeded?\"[223]\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" Kate Mullaney replied, adding that the striking\r\nbricklayers had won everything they demanded. Susan then reminded her\r\nthat because the bricklayers were voters, newspapers respected them\r\nand would hesitate to arouse their displeasure, realizing that in the\r\nnext election they would need the votes of all union men for their\r\ncandidates. \"If you collar women had been voters,\" she told them, \"you\r\ntoo would have held the balance of political power in that little city\r\nof Troy.\"\r\n\r\nSusan convinced the committee on female labor, and in their strong\r\nreport to the convention they urged women \"to secure the ballot\" as\r\nwell as \"to learn the trades, engage in business, join labor unions or\r\nform protective unions of their own, ... and use every other honorable\r\nmeans to persuade or force employers to do justice to women by paying\r\nthem equal wages for equal work.\" These women also called upon the\r\nNational Labor Congress to aid the organization of women's unions, to\r\ndemand the eight-hour day for women as well as men, and to ask\r\nCongress and state legislatures to pass laws providing equal pay for\r\nwomen in government employ. The phrase, \"to secure the ballot,\" was\r\nquickly challenged by some of the men and had to be deleted before the\r\nreport was accepted; but this setback was as nothing to Susan in\r\ncomparison with the friends she had made for woman suffrage among\r\nprominent labor leaders and with the fact that a woman, Kate Mullaney\r\nof Troy, had been chosen assistant secretary of the National Labor\r\nUnion and its national organizer of women.[224]\r\n\r\nThe National Labor Union Congress won high praise in _The Revolution_\r\nas laying the foundation of the new political party of America which\r\nwould be triumphant in 1872. \"The producers, the working-men, the\r\nwomen, the Negroes,\" _The Revolution_ declared, \"are destined to form\r\na triple power that shall speedily wrest the sceptre of government\r\nfrom the non-producers, the land monopolists, the bondholders, and the\r\npoliticians.\"[225]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most encouraging signs at this time was the friendliness of\r\nthe New York _World_, whose reporters covered the meetings of the\r\nWorkingwomen's Association with sympathy, arousing much local\r\ninterest. Reprinting these reports and supplementing them, _The\r\nRevolution_ carried their import farther afield, bringing to the\r\nattention of many the wisdom and justice of equal pay for equal work,\r\nand the need to organize workingwomen and to provide training and\r\ntrade schools for them. _The Revolution_ continually spurred women on\r\nto improve themselves, to learn new skills, and actually to do equal\r\nwork if they expected equal pay.\r\n\r\nWhen reports reached Susan that women in the printing trade were\r\nafraid of manual labor, of getting their hands and fingers dirty, and\r\nof lifting heavy galleys, she quickly let them know that she had no\r\npatience with this. \"Those who stay at home,\" she told them, \"have to\r\nwash kettles and lift wash tubs and black stoves until their hands are\r\nblackened and hardened. In this spirit, you must go to work on your\r\ncases of type. Are these cases heavier than a wash tub filled with\r\nwater and clothes, or the old cheese tubs?... The trouble is either\r\nthat girls are not educated to have physical strength or else they do\r\nnot like to use it. If a union of women is to succeed, it must be\r\ncomposed of strength, nerve, courage, and persistence, with no fear of\r\ndirtying their white fingers, but with a determination that when they\r\ngo into an office they would go through all that was required of them\r\nand demand just as high wages as the men....\r\n\r\n\"Make up your mind,\" she continued, \"to take the 'lean' with the\r\n'fat,' and be early and late at the case precisely as the men are. I\r\ndo not demand equal pay for any women save those who do equal work in\r\nvalue. Scorn to be coddled by your employers; make them understand\r\nthat you are in their service as workers, not as women.\"[226]\r\n\r\nWorkingwomen's associations now existed in Boston, St. Louis, Chicago,\r\nSan Francisco and other cities, encouraged and aroused by the efforts\r\nat organization in New York. These associations occasionally exchanged\r\nideas, and news of all of them was published in _The Revolution_. The\r\ngroups in Boston and in the outlying textile mills were particularly\r\nactive, and Susan brought to her next suffrage convention in\r\nWashington in 1870 Jennie Collins of Lowell who was ably leading a\r\nstrike against a cut in wages. The newspapers, too, began to notice\r\nworkingwomen, publishing articles about their working and living\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nTrying to amalgamate the various groups in New York, Susan now formed\r\na Workingwomen's Central Association, of which she was elected\r\npresident. To its meetings she brought interesting speakers and\r\npractical reports on wages, hours, and working conditions. She herself\r\npicked up a great deal of useful information in her daily round as she\r\ntalked with this one and that one. On her walks to and from work, in\r\nall kinds of weather, she met poorly clad women carrying sacks and\r\nbaskets in which they collected rags, scraps of paper, bones, old\r\nshoes, and anything worth rescuing from \"garbage boxes.\" With\r\nfriendliness and good cheer, she greeted these ragpickers, sometimes\r\nstopping to talk with them about their work, and through her interest\r\nbrought several into the Workingwomen's Association. Looking forward\r\nto surveys on all women's occupations, she started out by appointing a\r\ncommittee to investigate the ragpickers, many of whom lived in\r\ntumbledown slab shanties on the rocky land which is now a part of\r\nCentral Park.\r\n\r\nThis investigation revealed that more than half of the 1200 ragpickers\r\nwere women and that it was the one occupation in which women had equal\r\nopportunity with men and received equal compensation for their day's\r\nwork. Average earnings ranged from forty cents a day to ten dollars a\r\nweek. The report, highly sentimental in the light of today's\r\nscientific approach, was a promising beginning, a survey made by women\r\nthemselves in their own interest--the forerunner of the reports of the\r\nLabor Department's Women's Bureau.\r\n\r\nCooperatives appealed to Susan as they did to many labor leaders as\r\nthe best means of freeing labor. When the Sewing Machine Operators\r\nUnion tried to establish a shop where their members could share the\r\nprofits of their labor, she did her best to help them, hoping to see\r\nthem gain economic independence in a light airy clean shop where\r\nwealthy women, eager to help their sisters, would patronize them.\r\nHowever, the wealthy women to whom she appealed to finance this\r\nproject did not respond, looking upon a cooperative as a first step\r\ntoward socialism and a threat to their own profits. She was able,\r\nhowever, to arouse a glimmer of interest among the members of the\r\nnewly formed literary club, Sorosis, in the problems of working women.\r\n\r\nShe had the satisfaction of seeing women typesetters form their own\r\nunion in 1869, and this was, according to the Albany _Daily\r\nKnickerbocker_, \"the first move of the kind ever made in the country\r\nby any class of labor, to place woman on a par with man as regards\r\nstanding, intelligence, and manual ability.\"[227] _The Revolution_\r\nencouraged this union by printing notices of its meetings and urging\r\nall women compositors to join. In signed articles, Susan pointed out\r\nhow wages had improved since the union was organized. \"A little more\r\nUnion, girls,\" she said, \"and soon all employers will come up to 45\r\ncents, the price paid men.... So join the Union, girls, and together\r\nsay _Equal Pay for Equal Work_.\"[228]\r\n\r\nEager to bring more women into the printing trade where wages were\r\nhigher, she tried in every possible way to establish trade schools for\r\nthem. She looked forward to a printing business run entirely by women,\r\ngiving employment to hundreds. So obsessed was she by the idea of a\r\ntrade school for women compositors that when printers in New York went\r\non a strike, she saw an opportunity for women to take their places and\r\nappealed by letter and in person to a group of employers \"to\r\ncontribute liberally for the purpose of enabling us to establish a\r\ntraining school for girls in the art of typesetting.\" Explaining that\r\nhundreds of young women, now stitching at starvation wages, were ready\r\nand eager to learn the trade, she added, \"Give us the means and we\r\nwill soon give you competent women compositors.\"[229] Having learned\r\nby experience that men always kept women out of their field of labor\r\nunless forced by circumstances to admit them, she also urged young\r\nwomen to take the places of striking typesetters at whatever wage\r\nthey could get.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to her in her eagerness to bring women into a new\r\noccupation that she might be breaking the strike. She saw only women's\r\nopportunity to prove to employers that they were able to do the work\r\nand to show the Typographical Union that they should admit women as\r\nmembers. Labor men, however, soon let her know how much they\r\ndisapproved of her strategy. She tried to explain her motives to them,\r\nthat she was trying to fit these women to earn equal wages with men.\r\nShe reminded these men of how hard it was for women to get into the\r\nprinting trade and how they had refused to admit women to their union;\r\nand she called their attention to her whole-hearted support of the\r\nlately formed Women's Typographical Union.\r\n\r\nSome of the men were never convinced and never forgot this misstep,\r\nbringing it up at the National Labor Union Congress in Philadelphia in\r\n1869, which Susan attended as a delegate of the New York\r\nWorkingwomen's Association. Here she found herself facing an\r\nunfriendly group without the support of William H. Sylvis, who had\r\nrecently died. For three days they debated her eligibility as a\r\ndelegate, first expressing fear that her admission would commit the\r\nLabor Congress to woman suffrage. When she won 55 votes against 52 in\r\nopposition, Typographical Union No. 6 of New York brought accusations\r\nagainst her which aroused suspicion in the minds of many union\r\nmembers. They pointed out that she belonged to no union, and they\r\ncalled her an enemy of labor because she had encouraged women to take\r\nmen's jobs during the printers' strike. They could not or would not\r\nunderstand that in urging women to take men's jobs, she had been\r\nfighting for women just as they fought for their union, and they\r\ncompletely overlooked how continuously and effectively she had\r\nsupported the Women's Typographical Union. Her _Revolution_, they\r\nclaimed, was printed at less than union rates in a \"rat office\" and\r\nher explanation was not satisfactory. That it was printed on contract\r\noutside her office was no answer to satisfy union men who could not\r\nrealize on what a scant margin her paper operated or how gladly she\r\nwould have set up a union shop had the funds been available.\r\n\r\nNot only were these accusations repeated again and again, they were\r\nalso carried far and wide by the press, with the result that Susan was\r\nnot only kept out of the Labor Congress but was even sharply\r\ncriticized by some members of her Workingwomen's Association.\r\n\r\n\"As to the charges which were made by Typographical Union No. 6,\" she\r\nreported to this Association, \"no one believes them; and I don't think\r\nthey are worth answering. I admit that this Workingwomen's Association\r\nis not a _trade_ organization; and while I join heart and hand with\r\nthe working people in their trades unions, and in everything else by\r\nwhich they can protect themselves against the oppression of\r\ncapitalists and employers, I say that this organization of ours is\r\nmore upon the broad platform of philosophizing on the general\r\nquestions of labor, and to discuss what can be done to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of working people generally.\"[230]\r\n\r\nShe was not without friends in the ranks of labor, however, the New\r\nEngland delegates giving her their support. The New York _World_, very\r\nfair in its coverage of the heated debates, declared, \"Of her devotion\r\nto the cause of workingwomen, there can be no question.\"[231]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Workingwomen's Association had by this time\r\nbegun to irk employers, and some of them threatened instant dismissal\r\nof any employee who reported her wages or hours to these meddling\r\nwomen. Fear of losing their jobs now hung over many while others were\r\nforbidden by their fathers, husbands, and brothers to have anything to\r\ndo with strong-minded Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nTo counteract this disintegrating influence and to bring all classes\r\nof women together in their fight for equal rights, Susan persuaded the\r\npopular lecturer, Anna E. Dickinson, to speak for the Workingwomen's\r\nAssociation at Cooper Union. This, however, only added fuel to the\r\nflames, for Anna, in an emotional speech, \"A Struggle for Life,\" told\r\nthe tragic story of Hester Vaughn, a workingwoman who had been accused\r\nof murdering her illegitimate child. Found in a critical condition\r\nwith her dead baby beside her, Hester Vaughn had been charged with\r\ninfanticide, tried without proper defense, and convicted by a\r\nprejudiced court, although there was no proof that she had\r\ndeliberately killed her child. At Susan's instigation, the\r\nWorkingwomen's Association sent a woman physician, Dr. Clemence\r\nLozier, and the well-known author, Eleanor Kirk, to Philadelphia to\r\ninvestigate the case. Both were convinced of Hester Vaughn's\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of Elizabeth Cady Stanton's courageous editorials in _The\r\nRevolution_, Susan made such an issue of the conviction of Hester\r\nVaughn that many newspapers accused her of obstructing justice and\r\nadvocating free love, and this provided a moral weapon for her critics\r\nto use in their fight against the growing independence of women.\r\nEventually her efforts and those of her colleagues won a pardon for\r\nHester Vaughn. At the same time the publicity given this case served\r\nto educate women on a subject heretofore taboo, showing them that\r\npoverty and a double standard of morals made victims of young women\r\nlike Hester Vaughn. Susan also made use of this case to point out the\r\nneed for women jurors to insure an unprejudiced trial. She even\r\nsuggested that Columbia University Law School open its doors to women\r\nso that a few of them might be able to understand their rights under\r\nthe law and bring aid to their less fortunate sisters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder Susan's guidance, the Workingwomen's Association continued to\r\nhold meetings as long as she remained in New York. In its limited way,\r\nit carried on much-needed educational work, building up self-respect\r\nand confidence among workingwomen, stirring up \"a wholesome\r\ndiscontent,\" and preparing the way for women's unions. The public\r\nresponded. At Cooper Union, telegraphy courses were opened to women;\r\nthe New York Business School, at Susan's instigation, offered young\r\nwomen scholarships in bookkeeping; and there were repeated requests\r\nfor the enrollment of women in the College of New York.\r\n\r\nLiving in the heart of this rapidly growing, sprawling city, Susan saw\r\nmuch to distress her and pondered over the disturbing social\r\nconditions, looking for a way to relieve poverty and wipe out crime\r\nand corruption. She saw luxury, extravagance, and success for the few,\r\nwhile half of the population lived in the slums in dilapidated houses\r\nand in damp cellars, often four or five to a room. Immigrants,\r\ncontinually pouring in from Europe, overtaxed the already inadequate\r\nhousing, and unfamiliar with our language and customs, were the easy\r\nprey of corrupt politicians. Many were homeless, sleeping in the\r\nstreets and parks until the rain or cold drove them into police\r\nstations for warmth and shelter. Susan longed to bring order and\r\ncleanliness, good homes and good government to this overcrowded city,\r\nand again and again she came to the conclusion that votes for women,\r\nwhich meant a voice in the government, would be the most potent factor\r\nfor reform.\r\n\r\nYet she did not close her mind to other avenues of reform. Seeing\r\nreflected in the life of the city the excesses, the injustice, and the\r\nunsoundness of laissez-faire capitalism, she spoke out fearlessly in\r\n_The Revolution_ against its abuses, such as the fortunes made out of\r\nthe low wages and long hours of labor, or the Wall Street speculation\r\nto corner the gold market, or the efforts to take over the public\r\nlands of the West through grants to the transcontinental railroads.\r\nHer active mind also sought a solution of the complicated currency\r\nproblem. In fact there was no public question which she hesitated to\r\napproach, to think out or attempt to solve. She did not keep her\r\nstruggle for woman suffrage aloof from the pressing problems of the\r\nday. Instead she kept it abreast of the times, keenly alive to social,\r\npolitical, and economic issues, and involved in current public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[220] Feb. 18, 1868, Anna E.

More than ever convinced that they needed the\r\nNegro vote in order to continue in power, they prepared to supplement\r\nit by a Fifteenth Amendment, which Susan hoped would be drafted to\r\nenfranchise women as well as Negroes. Immediately through her Woman's\r\nSuffrage Association of America, she petitioned Congress to make no\r\ndistinction between men and women in any amendment extending or\r\nregulating suffrage.\r\n\r\nShe and Elizabeth Stanton also persuaded their good friends, Senator\r\nPomeroy of Kansas and Congressman Julian of Indiana, to introduce in\r\nDecember 1868 resolutions providing that suffrage be based on\r\ncitizenship, be regulated by Congress, and that all citizens, native\r\nor naturalized, enjoy this right without distinction of race, color,\r\nor sex. Before the end of the month, Senator Wilson of Massachusetts\r\nand Congressman Julian had introduced other resolutions to enfranchise\r\nwomen in the District of Columbia and in the territories. Even the New\r\nYork _Herald_ could see no reason why \"the experiment\" of woman\r\nsuffrage should not be tried in the District of Columbia.[232]\r\n\r\nTo focus attention on woman suffrage at this crucial time, Susan, in\r\nJanuary 1869, called together the first woman suffrage convention ever\r\nheld in Washington. No only did it attract women from as far west as\r\nIllinois, Missouri, and Kansas, but Senator Pomeroy lent it importance\r\nby his opening speech, and through the detailed and respectful\r\nreporting of the New York _World_ and of Grace Greenwood of the\r\nPhiladelphia _Press_ it received nationwide notice.\r\n\r\nCongress, however, gave little heed to women's demands. \"The\r\nexperiment\" of woman suffrage in the District of Columbia was not\r\ntried and nothing came of the resolutions for universal suffrage\r\nintroduced by Pomeroy, Julian, and Wilson. In spite of all Susan's\r\nefforts to have the word \"sex\" added to the Fifteenth Amendment, she\r\nsoon faced the bitter disappointment of seeing a version ignoring\r\nwomen submitted to the states for ratification: \"The right of citizens\r\nof the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the\r\nUnited States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous\r\ncondition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nThe blatant omission of the word \"sex\" forced Susan and Mrs. Stanton\r\nto initiate an amendment of their own, a Sixteenth Amendment, and\r\nagain Congressman Julian came to their aid, although he too regarded\r\nNegro suffrage as more \"immediately important and absorbing\"[233] than\r\nsuffrage for women. On March 15, 1869, at one of the first sessions of\r\nthe newly elected Congress, he introduced an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, providing that the right of suffrage be based on\r\ncitizenship without any distinction or discrimination because of sex.\r\nThis was the first federal woman suffrage amendment ever proposed in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nOpportunity to campaign for this amendment was now offered Susan and\r\nElizabeth Stanton as they addressed a series of conventions in Ohio,\r\nIllinois, Wisconsin, and Missouri. Press notices were good, a\r\nMilwaukee paper describing Susan as \"an earnest enthusiastic, fiery\r\nwoman--ready, apt, witty and what a politician would call sharp ...\r\nradical in the strongest sense,\" making \"radical everything she\r\ntouches.\"[234] She found woman suffrage sentiment growing by leaps and\r\nbounds in the West and western men ready to support a federal woman\r\nsuffrage amendment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a lighter heart than she had had in many a day and with new\r\nsubscriptions to _The Revolution_, Susan returned to New York. She\r\nmoved the _Revolution_ office to the first floor of the Women's\r\nBureau, a large four-story brownstone house at 49 East Twenty-third\r\nStreet, near Fifth Avenue, which had been purchased by a wealthy New\r\nYorker, Mrs. Elizabeth Phelps, who looked forward to establishing a\r\ncenter where women's organizations could meet and where any woman\r\ninterested in the advancement of her sex would find encouragement and\r\ninspiration. Susan's hopes were high for the Women's Bureau, and in\r\nthis most respectable, fashionable, and even elegant setting, she\r\nexpected her _Revolution_, in spite of its inflammable name, to live\r\ndown its turbulent past and win new friends and subscribers.[235]\r\n\r\nShe made one last effort to resuscitate the American Equal Rights\r\nAssociation, writing personal letters to old friends, urging that past\r\ndifferences be forgotten and that all rededicate themselves to\r\nestablishing universal suffrage by means of the Sixteenth Amendment.\r\nShe was optimistic as she prepared for a convention in New York,\r\nparticularly as one obstacle to unity had been removed. George Francis\r\nTrain had voluntarily severed all connections with _The Revolution_ to\r\ndevote himself to freeing Ireland. She soon found, however, that the\r\nmisunderstandings between her and her old antislavery friends were far\r\ndeeper than George Francis Train, although he would for a long time be\r\nblamed for them. The Fifteenth Amendment was still a bone of\r\ncontention and _The Revolution's_ continued editorials against it\r\nwidened the breach.\r\n\r\nThe fireworks were set off in the convention of the American Equal\r\nRights Association by Stephen S. Foster, who objected to the\r\nnomination of Susan and Mrs. Stanton as officers of the Association\r\nbecause they had in his opinion repudiated its principles. When asked\r\nto explain further, he replied that not only had they published a\r\npaper advocating educated suffrage while the Association stood for\r\nuniversal suffrage but they had shown themselves unfit by\r\ncollaboration with George Francis Train who ridiculed Negroes and\r\nopposed their enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nTrying to pour oil on the troubled waters, Mary Livermore, the popular\r\nnew delegate from Chicago, asked whether it was quite fair to bring up\r\nGeorge Francis Train when he had retired from _The Revolution_.\r\n\r\nTo this Stephen Foster sternly replied, \"If _The Revolution_ which has\r\nso often endorsed George Francis Train will repudiate him because of\r\nhis course in respect to the Negro's rights, I have nothing further to\r\nsay. But they do not repudiate him. He goes out; but they do not cast\r\nhim out.\"[236]\r\n\r\n\"Of course we do not,\" Susan instantly protested.\r\n\r\nMr. Foster then objected to the way Susan had spent the funds of the\r\nAssociation, accusing her of failing to keep adequate accounts.\r\n\r\nThis she emphatically denied, explaining that she had presented a full\r\naccounting to the trust fund committee, that it had been audited, and\r\nshe had been voted $1,000 to repay her for the amount she had\r\npersonally advanced for the work.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to accept her explanation and calling it unreliable, he\r\ncontinued his complaints until interrupted by Henry Blackwell who\r\ncorroborated Susan's statement, adding that she had refused the $1,000\r\ndue her because of the dissatisfaction expressed over her management.\r\nDeclaring himself completely satisfied with the settlement and\r\nconfident of the purity of Susan's motives even if some of her\r\nexpenditures were unwise, Henry Blackwell continued, \"I will agree\r\nthat many unwise things have been written in _The Revolution_ by a\r\ngentleman who furnished part of the means by which the paper has been\r\ncarried on. But that gentleman has withdrawn, and you, who know the\r\nreal opinions of Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton on the question of\r\nNegro suffrage, do not believe that they mean to create antagonism\r\nbetween the Negro and woman question....\"\r\n\r\nTo Susan's great relief Henry Blackwell's explanation satisfied the\r\ndelegates, who gave her and Mrs. Stanton a vote of confidence. Not so\r\neasily healed, however, were the wounds left by the accusations of\r\nmismanagement and dishonesty.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was still tense, for differences of opinion on policy\r\nremained. Most of the old reliable workers stood unequivocally for the\r\nFifteenth Amendment, which they regarded as the crowning achievement\r\nof the antislavery movement, and they heartily disapproved of forcing\r\nthe issue of woman suffrage on Congress and the people at this time.\r\nAlthough they had been deeply moved by the suffering of Negro women\r\nunder slavery and had used this as a telling argument for\r\nemancipation, they now gave no thought to Negro women, who, even more\r\nthan Negro men, needed the vote to safeguard their rights. Believing\r\nwith the Republicans that one reform at a time was all they could\r\nexpect, they did not want to hear one word about woman suffrage or a\r\nSixteenth Amendment until male Negroes were safely enfranchised by the\r\nFifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nOffering a resolution endorsing the Fifteenth Amendment, Frederick\r\nDouglass quoted Julia Ward Howe as saying, \"I am willing that the\r\nNegro shall get the ballot before me,\" and he added, \"I cannot see how\r\nanyone can pretend that there is the same urgency in giving the ballot\r\nto women as to the Negro.\"\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash, Susan was on her feet, challenging his statements,\r\nand as the dauntless champion of women debated the question with the\r\ndark-skinned fiery Negro, the friendship and warm affection built up\r\nbetween them over the years occasionally shone through the sharp words\r\nthey spoke to each other.\r\n\r\n\"The old antislavery school says that women must stand back,\" declared\r\nSusan, \"that they must wait until male Negroes are voters. But we say,\r\nif you will not give the whole loaf of justice to an entire people,\r\ngive it to the most intelligent first.\"\r\n\r\nHere she was greeted with applause and continued, \"If intelligence,\r\njustice, and morality are to be placed in the government, then let the\r\nquestion of woman be brought up first and that of the Negro last....\r\nMr. Douglass talks about the wrongs of the Negro, how he is hunted\r\ndown ..., but with all the wrongs and outrages that he today suffers,\r\nhe would not exchange his sex and take the place of Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know,\" shouted Frederick Douglass, \"if granting you the\r\nright of suffrage will change the nature of our sexes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will change the pecuniary position of woman,\" Susan retorted\r\nbefore the shouts of laughter had died down. \"She will not be\r\ncompelled to take hold of only such employments as man chooses for\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nLucy Stone, who so often in her youth had pleaded with Susan and\r\nFrederick Douglass for both the Negro and women, now entered the\r\nargument. She had matured, but her voice had lost none of its\r\nconviction or its power to sway an audience. Disagreeing with\r\nDouglass's assertion that Negro suffrage was more urgent than woman\r\nsuffrage, she pointed out that white women of the North were robbed of\r\ntheir children by the law just as Negro women had been by slavery.\r\n\r\nThis was balm to Susan's soul, but with Lucy's next words she lost all\r\nhope that her old friend would cast her lot wholeheartedly with women\r\nat this time. \"Woman has an ocean of wrongs too deep for any plummet,\"\r\nLucy continued, \"and the Negro too has an ocean of wrongs that cannot\r\nbe fathomed. But I thank God for the Fifteenth Amendment, and hope\r\nthat it will be adopted in every state. I will be thankful in my soul\r\nif anybody can get out of the terrible pit....\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" she admitted, \"that the national safety of the government\r\nwould be more promoted by the admission of women as an element of\r\nrestoration and harmony than the other. I believe that the influence\r\nof woman will save the country before every other influence. I see the\r\nsigns of the times pointing to this consummation. I believe that in\r\nsome parts of the country women will vote for the President of these\r\nUnited States in 1872.\"\r\n\r\nSusan grew impatient as Lucy shifted from one side to the other,\r\nstraddling the issue. Her own clear-cut approach, earning for her the\r\nreputation of always hitting the nail on the head, made Lucy's seem\r\nlike temporizing.\r\n\r\nThe men now took control, criticizing the amount of time given to the\r\ndiscussion of woman's rights, and voted endorsement of the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment. Nevertheless, a small group of determined women continued\r\ntheir fight, Susan declaring with spirit that she protested against\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment because it was not Equal Rights and would put\r\n2,000,000 more men in the position of tyrants over 2,000,000 women who\r\nuntil now had been the equals of the Negro men at their side.[237]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was now clear to Susan and to the few women who worked closely with\r\nher that they needed a strong organization of their own and that it\r\nwas folly to waste more time on the Equal Rights Association. Western\r\ndelegates, disappointed in the convention's lack of interest in woman\r\nsuffrage, expressed themselves freely. They had been sorely tried by\r\nthe many speeches on extraneous subjects which cluttered the meetings,\r\nthe heritage of a free-speech policy handed down by antislavery\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n\"That Equal Rights Association is an awful humbug,\" exploded Mary\r\nLivermore to Susan. \"I would not have come on to the anniversary, nor\r\nwould any of us, if we had known what it was. We supposed we were\r\ncoming to a woman suffrage convention.\"[238]\r\n\r\nAt a reception for all the delegates held at the Women's Bureau at the\r\nclose of the convention, this dissatisfaction culminated in a\r\nspontaneous demand for a new organization which would concentrate on\r\nwoman suffrage and the Sixteenth Amendment. Alert to the\r\npossibilities, Susan directed this demand into concrete action by\r\nturning the reception temporarily into a business meeting. The result\r\nwas the formation of the National Woman Suffrage Association by women\r\nfrom nineteen states, with Mrs. Stanton as president and Susan as a\r\nmember of the executive committee. The younger women of the West,\r\ntrusting the judgment of Susan and Mrs. Stanton, looked to them for\r\nleadership, as did a few of the old workers in the East--Ernestine\r\nRose, always in the vanguard, Paulina Wright Davis, Elizabeth Smith\r\nMiller, Lucretia Mott, who although holding no office in the new\r\norganization gave it her support, Martha C. Wright, and Matilda Joslyn\r\nGage who never wavered in her allegiance. Lucy Stone, who would have\r\nfound it hard even to step into the _Revolution_ office, did not\r\nattend the reception at the Women's Bureau or take part in the\r\nformation of the new woman suffrage organization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paulina Wright Davis]\r\n\r\nAided and abetted by her new National Woman Suffrage Association,\r\nSusan continued her opposition in _The Revolution_ to the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment until it was ratified in 1870.\r\n\r\nSo incensed was the Boston group by _The Revolution's_ opposition to\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment, so displeased was Lucy Stone by the formation\r\nof the National Woman Suffrage Association without consultation with\r\nher, one of the oldest workers in the field, that they began to talk\r\nof forming a national woman suffrage organization of their own. They\r\ncharged Susan with lust for power and autocratic control. Mrs. Stanton\r\nthey found equally objectionable because of her radical views on sex,\r\nmarriage, and divorce, expressed in _The Revolution_ in connection\r\nwith the Hester Vaughn case. They sincerely felt that the course of\r\nwoman suffrage would run more smoothly, arouse less antagonism, and\r\nmake more progress without these two militants who were forever\r\nstirring things up and introducing extraneous subjects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring these trying days of accusations, animosity, and rival\r\nfactions, Mrs. Stanton's unwavering support was a great comfort to\r\nSusan as was the joy of having a paper to carry her message.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all the responsibilities connected with publishing her\r\nweekly paper, advertising, subscriptions, editorial policy, and\r\nraising the money to pay the bills, Susan was also holding successful\r\nconventions in Saratoga and Newport where men and women of wealth and\r\ninfluence gathered for the summer; she was traveling out to St. Louis,\r\nChicago, and other western cities to speak on woman suffrage, making\r\ntrips to Washington to confer with Congressmen, getting petitions for\r\nthe Sixteenth Amendment circulated, and through all this, building up\r\nthe National Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\nThe _Revolution_ office became the rallying point for a\r\nforward-looking group of women, many of whom contributed to the\r\nhard-hitting liberal sheet. Elizabeth Tilton, the lovely dark-haired\r\nyoung wife of the popular lecturer and editor of the _Independent_,\r\nselected the poetry. Alice and Phoebe Cary gladly offered poems and a\r\nnovel; and when Susan was away, Phoebe Cary often helped Mrs. Stanton\r\nget out the paper. Elizabeth Smith Miller gave money, encouragement,\r\nand invaluable aid with her translations of interesting letters which\r\n_The Revolution_ received from France and Germany. Laura Curtis\r\nBullard, the heir to the Dr. Winslow-Soothing-Syrup fortune, who\r\ntraveled widely in Europe, sent letters from abroad and took a lively\r\ninterest in the paper. Another new recruit was Lillie Devereux Blake,\r\nwho was gaining a reputation as a writer and who soon proved to be a\r\nbrilliant orator and an invaluable worker in the New York City\r\nsuffrage group. Dr. Clemence S. Lozier, unfailingly gave her support,\r\nand her calm assurance strengthened Susan. The wealthy Paulina Wright\r\nDavis of Providence, Rhode Island, who followed Parker Pillsbury as\r\neditor, when he felt obliged to resign for financial reasons, gave the\r\npaper generous financial backing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Isabella Beecher Hooker]\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Davis who brought into the fold the half sister of Henry\r\nWard Beecher, Isabella Beecher Hooker, a queenly woman, one of the\r\nelect of Hartford, Connecticut. Hoping to break down Mrs. Hooker's\r\nprejudice against Susan and Mrs. Stanton, which had been built up by\r\nNew England suffragists, Mrs. Davis invited the three women to spend a\r\nfew days with her. After this visit, Mrs. Hooker wrote to a friend in\r\nBoston, \"I have studied Miss Anthony day and night for nearly a\r\nweek.... She is a woman of incorruptible integrity and the thought of\r\nguile has no place in her heart. In unselfishness and benevolence she\r\nhas scarcely an equal, and her energy and executive ability are\r\nbounded only by her physical power, which is something immense.\r\nSometimes she fails in judgment, according to the standards of\r\nothers, but in right intentions never, nor in faithfulness to her\r\nfriends.... After attending a two days' convention in Newport,\r\nengineered by her in her own fashion, I am obliged to accept the most\r\nfavorable interpretation of her which prevails generally, rather than\r\nthat of Boston. Mrs. Stanton too is a magnificent woman.... I hand in\r\nmy allegiance to both as leaders and representatives of the great\r\nmovement.\"[239]\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Mrs. Hooker did her best to reconcile the Boston and New\r\nYork factions, hoping to avert the formation of a second national\r\nwoman suffrage organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[232] _The Revolution_, II, Dec. 24, 1868, p. 385.\r\n\r\n[233] George W.

Each organization will attract those who naturally\r\nbelong to it--and there will be harmonious work.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the ground had been prepared by these letters, Lucy asked old\r\nfriends and new to sign a call to a woman suffrage convention, to be\r\nheld in Cleveland, Ohio, in November 1869, \"to unite those who cannot\r\nuse the methods which Mrs. Stanton and Susan use....\"[241]\r\n\r\nThose feeling as she did eagerly signed the call, while others who\r\nknew little about the controversy in the East added their names\r\nbecause they were glad to take part in a convention sponsored by such\r\nprominent men and women as Julia Ward Howe, George William Curtis,\r\nHenry Ward Beecher, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and William Lloyd\r\nGarrison. Still others who did not understand the insurmountable\r\ndifferences in temperament and policy between the two groups hoped\r\nthat a new truly national organization would unite the two factions.\r\nEven Mary Livermore, who had been active in the formation of the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association, was by this time responding to\r\novertures from the Boston group, writing William Lloyd Garrison, \"I\r\nhave been repelled by some of the idiosyncrasies of our New York\r\nfriends, as have others. Their opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment,\r\nthe buffoonery of George F. Train, the loose utterances of the\r\n_Revolution_ on the marriage and dress questions--and what is equally\r\npotent hindrance to the cause, the fearful squandering of money at\r\nthe New York headquarters--all this has tended to keep me on my own\r\nfeet, apart from those to whom I was at first attracted.... I am glad\r\nat the prospect of an association that will be truly national and\r\nwhich promises so much of success and character.\"[242]\r\n\r\nNeither Susan nor Mrs. Stanton received a notice of the Cleveland\r\nconvention, but Susan, scanning a copy of the call sent her by a\r\nsolicitous friend, was deeply disturbed when she saw the signatures of\r\nLydia Mott, Amelia Bloomer, Myra Bradwell, Gerrit Smith, and other\r\ngood friends.\r\n\r\nThe New York _World_, at once suspecting a feud, asked, \"Where are\r\nthose well-known American names, Susan B. Anthony, Parker Pillsbury,\r\nand Elizabeth Cady Stanton? It is clear that there is a division in\r\nthe ranks of the strong-minded and that an effort is being made to\r\nostracize _The Revolution_ which has so long upheld the cause of\r\nSuffrage, through evil report and good....\"[243]\r\n\r\nThe Rochester _Democrat_, loyal to Susan, put this question, \"Can it\r\nbe possible that a National Woman's Suffrage Convention is called\r\nwithout Susan's knowledge or consent?... A National Woman's Suffrage\r\nAssociation without speeches from Susan B. Anthony and Mrs. Stanton\r\nwill be a new order of things. The idea seems absurd.\"[244]\r\n\r\nTo Susan it also seemed both absurd and unrealistic, for she\r\nremembered how almost single-handed she had held together and built up\r\nthe woman suffrage movement during the years when her colleagues had\r\nbeen busy with family duties. She was appalled at the prospect of a\r\ndivision in the ranks at this time when she believed victory possible\r\nthrough the action of a strong united front.\r\n\r\nConfident that many who signed the call were ignorant of or blind to\r\nthe animus behind it, she did her best to bring the facts before them.\r\nShe put the blame for the rift entirely upon Lucy Stone, believing\r\nthat without Lucy's continual stirring up, past differences in policy\r\nwould soon have been forgotten. The antagonism between the two burned\r\nfiercely at this time. Susan was determined to fight to the last ditch\r\nfor control of the movement, convinced that her policies and Mrs.\r\nStanton's were forward-looking, unafraid, and always put women first.\r\n\r\nSusan now also had to face the humiliating possibility that she might\r\nbe forced to give up _The Revolution_. Not only was the operating\r\ndeficit piling up alarmingly, but there were persistent rumors of a\r\ncompetitor, another woman suffrage paper to be edited by Lucy Stone\r\nand Julia Ward Howe.\r\n\r\nSusan had assumed full financial responsibility for _The Revolution_\r\nbecause Mrs. Stanton and Parker Pillsbury, both with families to\r\nconsider, felt unable to share this burden. Mrs. Stanton had always\r\ncontributed her services and Parker Pillsbury had been sadly\r\nunderpaid, while Susan had drawn out for her salary only the most\r\nmeager sums for bare living expenses.\r\n\r\nWith a maximum of 3,000 subscribers, the paper could not hope to pay\r\nits way even though she had secured a remarkably loyal group of\r\nadvertisers.[245] Reluctantly she raised the subscription price from\r\n$2 to $3 a year. Her friends and family were generous with gifts and\r\nloans, but these only met the pressing needs of the moment and in no\r\nway solved the overall financial problem of the paper.\r\n\r\nAppealing once again to her wealthy and generous Quaker cousin, Anson\r\nLapham, she wrote him in desperation, \"My paper must not, shall not go\r\ndown. I am sure you believe in me, in my honesty of purpose, and also\r\nin the grand work which _The Revolution_ seeks to do, and therefore\r\nyou will not allow me to ask you in vain to come to the rescue.\r\nYesterday's mail brought 43 subscribers from Illinois and 20 from\r\nCalifornia. We only need time to win financial success. I know you\r\nwill save me from giving the world a chance to say, 'There is a\r\nwoman's rights failure; even the best of women can't manage business!'\r\nIf only I could die, and thereby fail honorably, I would say, 'Amen,'\r\nbut to live and fail--it would be too terrible to bear.\"[246] He came\r\nto her aid as he always had in the past.\r\n\r\nSusan's sister Mary not only lent her all her savings, but spent her\r\nsummer vacation in New York in 1869, working in _The Revolution_\r\noffice while Susan, busy with woman suffrage conventions in Newport,\r\nSaratoga, Chicago, and Ohio, was building up good will and\r\nsubscriptions for her paper. Concerned for her welfare, Mary\r\nrepeatedly but unsuccessfully urged her to give up. Daniel added his\r\nentreaties to Mary's, begging Susan not to go further into debt, but\r\nto form a stock company if she were determined to continue her paper.\r\nShe considered his advice very seriously for he was a practical\r\nbusinessman and yet appreciated what she was trying to do. For a time\r\nthe formation of a stock company seemed possible, for the project\r\nappealed to three women of means, Paulina Wright Davis, Isabella\r\nBeecher Hooker, and Laura Curtis Bullard, but it never materialized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the financial problem of _The Revolution_ still unsolved, Susan\r\ndecided to make her appearance at Lucy Stone's convention in\r\nCleveland, Ohio, on November 24, 1869. Not only did she want to see\r\nwith her own eyes and hear with her own ears all that went on, but she\r\nwas determined to walk the second mile with Lucy and her supporters,\r\nor even to turn the other cheek, if need be, for the sake of her\r\nbeloved cause.\r\n\r\nSeeing her in the audience, Judge Bradwell of Chicago moved that she\r\nbe invited to sit on the platform, but Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who\r\nwas presiding, replied that he thought this unnecessary as a special\r\ninvitation had already been extended to all desiring to identify\r\nthemselves with the movement. Judge Bradwell would not be put off, his\r\nmotion was carried, and as Susan walked up to the platform to join the\r\nother notables, she was greeted with hearty applause. Sitting there\r\namong her critics, she wondered what she could possibly say to\r\npersuade them to forget their differences for the sake of the cause.\r\nAfter listening to Lucy Stone plead for renewed work for woman\r\nsuffrage and for petitions for a Sixteenth Amendment, she\r\nspontaneously rose to her feet and asked permission to speak. \"I\r\nhope,\" she began, \"that the work of this association, if it be\r\norganized, will be to go in strong array up to the Capitol at\r\nWashington to demand a Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The\r\nquestion of the admission of women to the ballot would not then be\r\nleft to the mass of voters in every State, but would be submitted by\r\nCongress to the several legislatures of the States for ratification,\r\nand ... be decided by the most intelligent portion of the people. If\r\nthe question is left to the vote of the rank and file, it will be put\r\noff for years.[247]\r\n\r\n\"So help me, Heaven!\" she continued with emotion. \"I care not what may\r\ncome out of this Convention, so that this great cause shall go\r\nforward to its consummation! And though this Convention by its action\r\nshall nullify the National Association of which I am a member, and\r\nthough it shall tread its heel upon _The Revolution_, to carry on\r\nwhich I have struggled as never mortal woman or mortal man struggled\r\nfor any cause ... still, if you will do the work in Washington so that\r\nthis Amendment will be proposed, and will go with me to the several\r\nLegislatures and _compel_ them to adopt it, I will thank God for this\r\nConvention as long as I have the breath of life.\"\r\n\r\nLoud and continuous applause greeted these earnest words. However,\r\ninstead of pledging themselves to work for a Sixteenth Amendment, the\r\nnewly formed American Woman Suffrage Association, blind to the\r\nexceptional opportunity at this time for Congressional action on woman\r\nsuffrage, decided to concentrate on work in the states where suffrage\r\nbills were pending. Instead of electing an outstanding woman as\r\npresident, they chose Henry Ward Beecher, boasting that this was proof\r\nof their genuine belief in equal rights. Lucy Stone headed the\r\nexecutive committee.\r\n\r\nDivisions soon began developing among the suffragists in the field.\r\nMany whose one thought previously had been the cause now spent time\r\nweighing the differences between the two organizations and between\r\npersonalities, and antagonisms increased.\r\n\r\nHardest of all for Susan to bear was the definite announcement of a\r\nrival paper, the _Woman's Journal_, to be issued in Boston in January\r\n1870 under the editorship of Lucy Stone, Mary A. Livermore, and Julia\r\nWard Howe, with Henry Blackwell as business manager. Mary Livermore,\r\nwho previously had planned to merge her paper, the _Agitator_, with\r\n_The Revolution_ now merged it with the _Woman's Journal_. Financed by\r\nwealthy stockholders, all influential Republicans, the _Journal_,\r\nSusan knew, would be spared the financial struggles of _The\r\nRevolution_, but would be obliged to conform to Republican policy in\r\nits support of woman's rights. Had not the _Woman's Journal_ been such\r\nan obvious affront to the heroic efforts of _The Revolution_ and a\r\nthreat to its very existence, she could have rejoiced with Lucy over\r\none more paper carrying the message of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nMore determined than ever to continue _The Revolution_, Susan\r\nredoubled her efforts, announcing an imposing list of contributors\r\nfor 1870, including the British feminist, Lydia Becker, and as a\r\nspecial attraction, a serial by Alice Cary. Through the efforts of\r\nMrs. Hooker, Harriet Beecher Stowe was persuaded to consider serving\r\nas contributing editor provided the paper's name was changed to _The\r\nTrue Republic_ or to some other name satisfactory to her.[248]\r\n\r\nHaving struggled against the odds for so long, Susan had no intention\r\nof being stifled now by Mrs. Stowe's more conservative views, nor\r\nwould she give her crusading sheet an innocuous name. However, the\r\ndecision was taken out of her hands by _The Revolution's_ coverage of\r\nthe sensational McFarland-Richardson murder case, which so shocked\r\nboth Mrs. Hooker and Mrs. Stowe that they gave up all thought of being\r\nassociated in a publishing venture with Susan or Mrs. Stanton.\r\n\r\nThe whole country was stirred in December 1869 by the fatal shooting\r\nin the _Tribune_ office of the well-known journalist, Albert D.\r\nRichardson, by Daniel McFarland, to whose divorced wife Richardson had\r\nbeen attentive. When just before his death, Richardson was married to\r\nthe divorced Mrs. McFarland by Henry Ward Beecher with Horace Greeley\r\nas a witness, the press was agog. So strong was the feeling against a\r\ndivorced woman that Henry Ward Beecher was severely condemned for\r\nofficiating at the marriage, and Mrs. Richardson was played up in the\r\npress and in court as the villain, although her divorce had been\r\ngranted because of the brutality and instability of McFarland.\r\n\r\nIndignant at the sophistry of the press and the general acceptance of\r\na double standard of morals, _The Revolution_ not only spoke out\r\nfearlessly in defense of Mrs. Richardson but in an editorial by Mrs.\r\nStanton frankly analyzed the tragic human relations so obvious in the\r\ncase. With Susan's full approval, Mrs. Stanton wrote, \"I rejoice over\r\nevery slave that escapes from a discordant marriage. With the\r\neducation and elevation of women we shall have a mighty sundering of\r\nthe unholy ties that hold men and women together who loathe and\r\ndespise each other....\"[249] When the court acquitted McFarland,\r\ngiving him the custody of his twelve-year-old son, Susan called a\r\nprotest meeting which attracted an audience of two thousand.\r\n\r\nSuch words and such activities disturbed many who sympathized with\r\nMrs. Richardson but saw no reason for flaunting exultant approval of\r\ndivorce in a woman suffrage paper, and they turned to the _Woman's\r\nJournal_ as more to their taste.\r\n\r\nSusan, however, reading the first number of the _Woman's Journal_,\r\nfound its editorials lacking fire. She rebelled at Julia Ward Howe's\r\ncounsel, \"to lay down all partisan warfare and organize a peaceful\r\nGrand Army of the Republic of Women ... not ... as against men, but as\r\nagainst all that is pernicious to men and women.\"[250] Susan's fight\r\nhad never been against men but against man-made laws that held women\r\nin bondage. There had always been men willing to help her. Experience\r\nhad taught her that the struggle for woman's rights was no peaceful\r\nacademic debate, but real warfare which demanded political strategy,\r\nself-sacrifice, and unremitting labor. She was prouder than ever of\r\nher _Revolution_ and its liberal hard-hitting policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConvinced that the National Woman Suffrage Association must publicize\r\nits existence and its value, Susan began the year 1870 with a\r\nconvention in Washington which even Senator Sumner praised as\r\nexceeding in interest anything he had ever witnessed there. Its\r\nstriking demonstration of the vitality and intelligence of the\r\nNational Association was the best answer she could possibly have given\r\nto the accusations and criticism aimed at her and her organization.\r\n\r\nJessie Benton Frémont, watching the delegates enter the dining room of\r\nthe Arlington Hotel, called Susan over to her table and said with a\r\ntwinkle in her eyes, \"Now, tell me, Miss Anthony, have you hunted the\r\ncountry over and picked out and brought to Washington a score of the\r\nmost beautiful women you could find?\"[251]\r\n\r\nThey were a fine-looking and intelligent lot--Paulina Wright Davis,\r\nIsabella Beecher Hooker, Josephine Griffin of the Freedman's Bureau,\r\nCharlotte Wilbour, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Martha C. Wright, and Olympia\r\nBrown; Phoebe Couzins and Virginia Minor from Missouri, Madam Annekè\r\nfrom Wisconsin, and best of all to Susan, Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\r\nTheir presence, their friendship and allegiance were a source of great\r\npride and joy. Elizabeth Stanton had come from St. Louis, interrupting\r\nher successful lecture tour, when she much preferred to stay away from\r\nall conventions. She had written Susan, \"Of course, I stand by you to\r\nthe end. I would not see you crushed by rivals even if to prevent it\r\nrequired my being cut into inch bits.... No power in heaven, hell or\r\nearth can separate us, for our hearts are eternally wedded\r\ntogether.\"[252]\r\n\r\nAlso at this convention to show his support of Susan and her program,\r\nwas her faithful friend of many years, the Rev. Samuel J. May of\r\nSyracuse. Clara Barton, ill and unable to attend, sent a letter to be\r\nread, an appeal to her soldier friends for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nNot only did the large and enthusiastic audiences show a growing\r\ninterest in votes for women, but two great victories for women in\r\n1869, one in Great Britain and the other in the United States, brought\r\nto the convention a feeling of confidence. Women taxpayers had been\r\ngranted the right to vote in municipal elections in England, Scotland,\r\nand Wales, through the efforts of Jacob Bright. In the Territory of\r\nWyoming, during the first session of its legislature, women had been\r\ngranted the right to vote, to hold office, and serve on juries, and\r\nmarried women had been given the right to their separate property and\r\ntheir earnings. This progressive action by men of the West turned\r\nSusan's thoughts hopefully to the western territories, and early in\r\n1870 when the Territory of Utah enfranchised its women, she had\r\nfurther cause for rejoicing.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate these victories for which her twenty years' work for\r\nwomen had blazed the trail, some of her friends held a reception for\r\nher in New York at the Women's Bureau on her fiftieth birthday. She\r\nwas amazed at the friendly attention her birthday received in the\r\npress. \"Susan's Half Century,\" read a headline in the _Herald_. The\r\n_World_ called her the Moses of her sex. \"A Brave Old Maid,\" commented\r\nthe _Sun_. But it was to the _Tribune_ that she turned with special\r\ninterest, always hoping for a word of approval from Horace Greeley and\r\nfinding at last this faint ray of praise: \"Careful readers of the\r\n_Tribune_ have probably succeeded in discovering that we have not\r\nalways been able to applaud the course of Miss Susan B. Anthony.\r\nIndeed, we have often felt, and sometimes said that her methods were\r\nas unwise as we thought her aims undesirable. But through these years\r\nof disputation and struggling. Miss Anthony has thoroughly impressed\r\nfriends and enemies alike with the sincerity and earnestness of her\r\npurpose....\"[253]\r\n\r\nTo Anna E. Dickinson, far away lecturing, Susan confided, \"Oh, Anna, I\r\nam so glad of it all because it will teach the young girls that to be\r\ntrue to principle--to live an idea, though an unpopular one--that to\r\nlive single--without any man's name--may be honorable.\"[254]\r\n\r\nA few of Susan's younger colleagues still insisted that a merger of\r\nthe National and American Woman Suffrage Associations might be\r\npossible. Again Theodore Tilton undertook the task of mediation and\r\nLucretia Mott, who had retired from active participation in the\r\nwoman's rights movement, tried to help work out a reconciliation.\r\nSusan was skeptical but gave them her blessing. Representatives of the\r\nAmerican Association, however, again made it plain that they were\r\nunwilling to work with Susan and Mrs. Stanton.[255]\r\n\r\nBy this time _The Revolution_ had become an overwhelming financial\r\nburden. For some months Mrs. Stanton had been urging Susan to give it\r\nup and turn to the lecture field, as she had done, to spread the\r\nmessage of woman's rights. Susan hesitated, unwilling to give up _The\r\nRevolution_ and not yet confident that she could hold the attention of\r\nan audience for a whole evening. However, she found herself a great\r\nsuccess when pushed into several Lyceum lecture engagements in\r\nPennsylvania by Mrs. Stanton's sudden illness. \"Miss Anthony evidently\r\nlectures not for the purpose of receiving applause,\" commented the\r\nPittsburgh _Commercial_, \"but for the purpose of making people\r\nunderstand and be convinced. She takes her place on the stage in a\r\nplain and unassuming manner and speaks extemporaneously and fluently,\r\ntoo, reminding one of an old campaign speaker, who is accustomed to\r\ntalk simply for the purpose of converting his audience to his\r\npolitical theories. She used plain English and plenty of it.... She\r\nclearly evinced a quality that many politicians lack--sincerity.\"[256]\r\n\r\nFor each of these lectures on \"Work, Wages, and the Ballot,\" she\r\nreceived a fee of $75 and was able as well to get new subscribers for\r\n_The Revolution_. She now saw the possibilities for herself and the\r\ncause in a Lyceum tour, and when the Lyceum Bureau, pleased with her\r\nreception in Pennsylvania wanted to book her for lectures in the West,\r\nshe accepted, calling Parker Pillsbury back to _The_ _Revolution_ to\r\ntake charge. All through Illinois she drew large audiences and her\r\nfees increased to $95, $125, and $150. In two months she was able to\r\npay $1,300 of _The Revolution's_ debt.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to New York, she realized that she could not\r\ncontinue to carry _The Revolution_ alone, in spite of increased\r\nsubscriptions. Its $10,000 debt weighed heavily upon her. Parker\r\nPillsbury's help could only be temporary; Mrs. Stanton's strenuous\r\nlecture tour left her little time to give to the paper; and Susan's\r\nown friends and family were unable to finance it further.\r\n\r\nFortunately the idea of editing a paper appealed strongly to the\r\nwealthy Laura Curtis Bullard, who had the promise of editorial help\r\nfrom Theodore Tilton. Susan now turned the paper over to them\r\ncompletely, receiving nothing in return but shares of stock, while she\r\nassumed the entire indebtedness.\r\n\r\nGiving up the control of her beloved paper was one of the most\r\nhumiliating experiences and one of the deepest sorrows she ever faced.\r\n_The Revolution_ had become to her the symbol of her crusade for\r\nwomen. Overwhelmed by a sense of failure, she confided to her diary on\r\nthe date of the transfer, \"It was like signing my own death warrant,\"\r\nand to a friend she wrote, \"I feel a great, calm sadness like that of\r\na mother binding out a dear child that she could not support.\"[257]\r\n\r\nShe made a valiant announcement of the transfer in _The Revolution_ of\r\nMay 26, 1870, expressing her delight that the paper had at last found\r\nfinancial backing and a new, enthusiastic editor. \"In view of the\r\nactive demand for conventions, lectures, and discussions on Woman\r\nSuffrage,\" she added, \"I have concluded that so far as my own personal\r\nefforts are concerned, I can be more useful on the platform than in a\r\nnewspaper. So, on the 1st of June next, I shall cease to be the _sole_\r\nproprietor of _The Revolution_, and shall be free to attend public\r\nmeetings where ever so plain and matter of fact an old worker as I am\r\ncan secure a hearing.\"[258]\r\n\r\nFinancial backing, however, did not put _The Revolution_ on its feet,\r\nalthough its forthright editorials and articles were replaced by spicy\r\nand brilliant observations on pleasant topics which offended no one.\r\nBefore the year was up, Mrs. Bullard was making overtures to Susan to\r\ntake the paper back. Susan wanted desperately \"to keep the Old Ship\r\nRevolution's colors flying\"[259] and to bring back Mrs. Stanton's\r\nstinging editorials. She also feared that Mrs. Bullard on Theodore\r\nTilton's advice might turn the paper over to the Boston group to be\r\nconsolidated with the _Woman's Journal_. As no funds were available,\r\nshe had to turn her back on her beloved paper and hope for the best.\r\n\"I suppose there is a wise Providence in my being stripped of power to\r\ngo forward,\" she wrote at this time. \"At any rate, I mean to try and\r\nmake good come out of it.\"[260]\r\n\r\nFor one more year, _The Revolution_ struggled on under the editorship\r\nof Mrs. Bullard and Theodore Tilton and then was taken over by the\r\n_Christian Enquirer_. The $10,000 debt, incurred under Susan's\r\nmanagement, she regarded as her responsibility, although her brother\r\nDaniel and many of her friends urged bankruptcy proceedings. \"My pride\r\nfor women, to say nothing of my conscience,\" she insisted, \"says\r\nno.\"[261]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[240] Lucy Stone to Frank Sanborn, Aug. 18, 1869, Alma Lutz\r\nCollection.\r\n\r\n[241] Lucy Stone to Esther Pugh, Aug. 30, 1869, Ida Husted Harper\r\nCollection, Henry E.

Anthony\r\nCollection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW SLANT ON THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Susan was lecturing in the West, hoping to earn enough to pay\r\noff _The Revolution's_ debt, she was pondering a new approach to the\r\nenfranchisement of women which had been proposed by Francis Minor, a\r\nSt. Louis attorney and the husband of her friend, Virginia Minor.\r\n\r\nFrancis Minor contended that while the Constitution gave the states\r\nthe right to regulate suffrage, it nowhere gave them the power to\r\nprohibit it, and he believed that this conclusion was strengthened by\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment which provided that \"no State shall make or\r\nenforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of\r\ncitizens of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nTo claim the right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment made a great\r\nappeal to both Susan and Elizabeth Stanton. Susan published Francis\r\nMinor's arguments in _The Revolution_ and also his suggestion that\r\nsome woman test this interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment by\r\nattempting to vote at the next election; while Mrs. Stanton used this\r\nnew approach as the basis of her speech before a Congressional\r\ncommittee in 1870.\r\n\r\nWith such a fresh and thrilling project to develop, Susan looked\r\nforward to the annual woman suffrage convention to be held in\r\nWashington in January 1871. So heavy was her lecture schedule that she\r\nreluctantly left preparations for the convention in the willing hands\r\nof Isabella Beecher Hooker, who was confident she could improve on\r\nSusan's meetings and guide the woman's rights movement into more\r\nladylike and aristocratic channels, winning over scores of men and\r\nwomen who hitherto had remained aloof. At the last moment, however,\r\nshe appealed in desperation to Susan for help, and Susan, canceling\r\nimportant lecture engagements, hurried to Washington. Here she found\r\nthe newspapers full of Victoria C. Woodhull and her Memorial to\r\nCongress on woman suffrage, which had been presented by Senator Harris\r\nof Louisiana and Congressman Julian of Indiana. Capitalizing on the\r\nnew approach to woman suffrage, Mrs. Woodhull based her arguments on\r\nthe Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, praying Congress to enact\r\nlegislation to enable women to exercise the right to vote vested in\r\nthem by these amendments. A hearing was scheduled before the House\r\njudiciary committee the very morning the convention opened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Victoria C. Woodhull]\r\n\r\nConvinced that she and her colleagues must attend that hearing, Susan\r\nconsulted with her friends in Congress and overrode Mrs. Hooker's\r\nhesitancy about associating their organization with so questionable a\r\nwoman as Victoria Woodhull. She engaged a constitutional lawyer,\r\nAlbert G. Riddle,[262] to represent the 30,000 women who had\r\npetitioned Congress for the franchise. Then she and Mrs. Hooker\r\nattended the hearing and asked for prompt action on woman suffrage.\r\nThis was the first Congressional hearing on federal enfranchisement.\r\nPrevious hearings had considered trying the experiment only in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nSusan had never before seen Victoria Woodhull. Early in 1870, however,\r\nshe had called at the brokerage office which Victoria and her sister,\r\nTennessee Claflin, had opened in New York on Broad Street. The press\r\nhad been full of amused comments regarding the lady bankers, and\r\nSusan had wanted to see for herself what kind of women they were. Here\r\nshe met and talked with Tennessee Claflin, publishing their interview\r\nin _The Revolution_, and also an advertisement of Woodhull, Claflin &\r\nCo., Bankers and Brokers.[263]\r\n\r\nAbout six weeks later, these prosperous \"lady brokers\" had established\r\ntheir own paper, _Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly_, an \"Organ of Social\r\nRegeneration and Constructive Reform,\" but Susan had barely noticed\r\nits existence, so burdened had she been by the impending loss of her\r\nown paper and by pressing lecture engagements. She was therefore\r\nunaware that this new weekly explored a field wider than finance,\r\nadvocating as well woman suffrage and women's advancement,\r\nspiritualism, radical views on marriage, love, and sex, and the\r\nnomination of Victoria C. Woodhull for President of the United States.\r\n\r\nNow in a committee room of the House of Representatives, Susan\r\nlistened carefully as the dynamic beautiful Victoria Woodhull read her\r\nMemorial and her arguments to support it, in a clear well-modulated\r\nvoice. Simply dressed in a dark blue gown, with a jaunty Alpine hat\r\nperched on her curls, she gave the impression of innocent earnest\r\nyouth, and she captivated not only the members of the judiciary\r\ncommittee, but the more critical suffragists as well. For the moment\r\nat least she seemed an appropriate colleague of the forthright\r\ncrusader, Susan B. Anthony, and her fashionable friends, Isabella\r\nBeecher Hooker and Paulina Wright Davis. They invited Victoria and her\r\nsister, Tennessee Claflin, to their convention, and asked her to\r\nrepeat her speech for them.\r\n\r\nAt this convention Susan, encouraged by the favorable reception among\r\npoliticians of the Woodhull Memorial, mapped out a new and militant\r\ncampaign, based on her growing conviction that under the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment women's rights as citizens were guaranteed. She urged women\r\nto claim their rights as citizens and persons under the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment, to register and prepare to vote at the next election, and\r\nto bring suit in the courts if they were refused.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo enthusiastic had been the reception of this new approach to woman\r\nsuffrage, so favorable had been the news from those close to leading\r\nRepublicans, that Susan was unprepared for the adverse report of the\r\njudiciary committee on the Woodhull Memorial. She now studied the\r\nfavorable minority report issued by Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts\r\nand William Loughridge of Iowa. Their arguments seemed to her\r\nunanswerable; and hurriedly and impulsively in the midst of her\r\nwestern lecture tour, she dashed off a few lines to Victoria Woodhull,\r\nto whom she willingly gave credit for bringing out this report.\r\n\"Glorious old Ben!\" she wrote. \"He surely is going to pronounce the\r\nword that will settle the woman question, just as he did the word\r\n'contraband' that so summarily settled the Negro question....\r\nEverybody here chimes in with the new conclusion that we are already\r\nfree.\"[264]\r\n\r\nFar from New York where Victoria's activities were being aired by the\r\npress, Susan thought of her at this time only in connection with the\r\nMemorial and its impact on the judiciary committee. To be sure, she\r\nheard stories crediting Benjamin Butler with the authorship of the\r\nWoodhull Memorial, and rumors reached her of Victoria's unorthodox\r\nviews on love and marriage and of her girlhood as a fortune teller,\r\ntraveling about like a gypsy and living by her wits. Even so, Susan\r\nwas ready to give Victoria the benefit of the doubt until she herself\r\nfound her harmful to the cause, for long ago she had learned to\r\ndiscount attacks on the reputations of progressive women. In fact,\r\nVictoria Woodhull provided Susan and her associates with a spectacular\r\nopportunity to prove the sincerity of their contention that there\r\nshould not be a double standard of morals--one for men and another for\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nReturning to New York in May 1871, to a convention of the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association, Susan found that Mrs. Hooker, Mrs.\r\nStanton, and Mrs. Davis had invited Victoria Woodhull to address that\r\nconvention and to sit on the platform between Lucretia Mott and Mrs.\r\nStanton.\r\n\r\nThrough them and others more critical, Susan was brought up to date on\r\nthe sensational story of Victoria Woodhull, who had been drawing\r\nrecord crowds to her lectures and whose unconventional life\r\ncontinuously provided reporters with interesting copy. Victoria's home\r\nat 15 East Thirty-eighth Street, resplendent and ornate with gilded\r\nfurniture and bric-a-brac, housed not only her husband, Colonel Blood,\r\nand herself but her divorced husband and their children as well, and\r\nalso all of her quarrelsome relatives. Here many radicals, social\r\nreformers, and spiritualists gathered, among them Stephen Pearl\r\nAndrews, who soon made use of Victoria and her _Weekly_ to publicize\r\nhis dream of a new world order, the Pantarchy, as he called it.\r\nVictoria, herself, was an ardent spiritualist, controlled by\r\nDemosthenes of the spirit world to whom she believed she owed her most\r\nbrilliant utterances and by whom she was guided to announce herself as\r\na presidential candidate in 1872. Needless to say, with such a\r\nbackground, Victoria Woodhull became a very controversial figure among\r\nthe suffragists.\r\n\r\nIn New York only a few days, it was hard for Susan to separate fact\r\nfrom fiction, truth from rumor and animosity. Even Demosthenes did not\r\nseem too ridiculous to her, for many of her most respected friends\r\nwere spiritualists. Nor did Victoria's presidential aspirations\r\ntrouble her greatly. Presidential candidates had been nothing to brag\r\nof, and willingly would she support the right woman for President. If\r\nVictoria lived up to the high standard of the Woodhull Memorial, then\r\neven she might be that woman. After all, it was an era of radical\r\ntheories and Utopian dreams, of extravagances of every sort. Almost\r\nanything could happen.\r\n\r\nWhatever doubts the suffragists may have had when they saw Victoria\r\nWoodhull on the platform at the New York meeting of the National\r\nAssociation, she swept them all along with her when, as one inspired,\r\nshe made her \"Great Secession\" speech. \"If the very next Congress\r\nrefuses women all the legitimate results of citizenship,\" she\r\ndeclared, \"we shall proceed to call another convention expressly to\r\nframe a new constitution and to erect a new government.... We mean\r\ntreason; we mean secession, and on a thousand times grander scale than\r\nwas that of the South. We are plotting revolution; we will overthrow\r\nthis bogus Republic and plant a government of righteousness in its\r\nstead....\"[265]\r\n\r\nSusan, who felt deeply her right to full citizenship, who herself had\r\ntalked revolution, and who had so often listened to the extravagant\r\nantislavery declarations of William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips,\r\nand Parker Pillsbury, was not offended by these statements. She was,\r\nhowever, troubled by the attitude of the press, particularly of the\r\n_Tribune_ which labeled this gathering the \"Woodhull Convention\" and\r\naccused the suffragists of adopting Mrs. Woodhull's free-love\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nHaving experienced so recently the animosity stirred up by her\r\nalliance with George Francis Train, Susan resolved to be cautious\r\nregarding Victoria Woodhull and was beginning to wonder if Victoria\r\nwas not using the suffragists to further her own ambitions. Yet many\r\ntrusted friends, who had talked with Mrs. Woodhull far more than she\r\nhad the opportunity to do, were convinced that she was a genius and a\r\nprophet who had risen above the sordid environment of her youth to do\r\na great work for women and who had the courage to handle subjects\r\nwhich others feared to touch.\r\n\r\nFree love, for example, Susan well knew was an epithet hurled\r\nindiscriminately at anyone indiscreet enough to argue for less\r\nstringent divorce laws or for an intelligent frank appraisal of\r\nmarriage and sex. Was it for this reason, Susan asked herself, that\r\nMrs. Woodhull was called a \"free-lover,\" or did she actually advocate\r\npromiscuity?\r\n\r\nWith these questions puzzling her, she left for Rochester and the\r\nWest. Almost immediately the papers were full of Victoria Woodhull and\r\nher family quarrels which brought her into court. This was a\r\ndisillusioning experience for the National Woman Suffrage Association\r\nwhich had so recently featured Victoria Woodhull as a speaker, and\r\nSusan began seriously to question the wisdom of further association\r\nwith this strange controversial character. Nevertheless, Victoria\r\nstill had her ardent defenders among the suffragists, particularly\r\nIsabella Beecher Hooker and Paulina Wright Davis. Even the thoughtful\r\njudicious Martha C. Wright wrote Mrs. Hooker at this time, \"It is not\r\nalways 'the wise and prudent' to whom the truth is revealed; tho' far\r\nbe it from me to imply aught derogatory to Mrs. Woodhull. No one can\r\nbe with her, see her gentle and modest bearing and her spiritual face,\r\nwithout feeling sure that she is a true woman, whatever unhappy\r\nsurroundings may have compromised her. I have never met a stranger\r\ntoward whom I felt more tenderly drawn, in sympathy and love.\"[266]\r\n\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton spoke her mind in Theodore Tilton's new paper,\r\n_The Golden Age_: \"Victoria C. Woodhull stands before us today a\r\ngrand, brave woman, radical alike in political, religious and social\r\nprinciples. Her face and form indicate the complete triumph in her\r\nnature of the spiritual over the sensuous. The processes of her\r\neducation are little to us; the grand result everything.\"[267]\r\n\r\nVictoria was in dire need of defenders, for the press was venomous,\r\ngoading her on to revenge. Susan, now traveling westward, lecturing in\r\none state after another, thinking of ways to interest the people in\r\nwoman suffrage, was too busy and too far away to follow Victoria\r\nWoodhull's court battles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton met Susan in Chicago late in May 1871, to join her on a\r\nlecture tour of the far West. Together they headed for Wyoming and\r\nUtah, eager to set foot in the states which had been the first to\r\nextend suffrage to women. The long leisurely days on the train gave\r\nthese two old friends, Susan now fifty-one and Mrs. Stanton,\r\nfifty-six, ample time to talk and philosophize, to appraise their past\r\nefforts for women, and plan their speeches for the days ahead. While\r\ntheir main theme would always be votes for women, they decided that\r\nfrom now on they must also arouse women to rebel against their legal\r\nbondage under the \"man marriage,\" as they called it, and to face\r\nfrankly the facts about sex, prostitution, and the double standard of\r\nmorals. In Utah, in the midst of polygamy fostered by the Mormon\r\nChurch, they would encounter still another sex problem.\r\n\r\nAfter an enthusiastic welcome in Denver, they moved on to Laramie,\r\nWyoming, where one hundred women greeted them as the train pulled in.\r\nFrom this first woman suffrage state, Susan exultingly wrote, \"We have\r\nbeen moving over the soil, that is really the land of the free and the\r\nhome of the brave.... Women here can say, 'What a magnificent country\r\nis ours, where every class and caste, color and sex, may find\r\nfreedom....'\"[268]\r\n\r\nThey reached Salt Lake City just after the Godbe secession by which a\r\ngroup of liberal Mormons abandoned polygamy. As guests of the Godbes\r\nfor a week, they had every opportunity to become acquainted with the\r\nMormons, to observe women under polygamy, and to speak in long all-day\r\nsessions to women alone.\r\n\r\nSusan tried to show her audiences in Utah that her point of attack\r\nunder both monogamy and polygamy was the subjection of women, and that\r\nto remedy this the self-support of women was essential. In Utah she\r\nfound little opportunity for women to earn a living for themselves and\r\ntheir children, as there was no manufacturing and there were no free\r\nschools in need of teachers. \"Women here, as everywhere,\" she\r\ndeclared, \"must be able to live honestly and honorably without the aid\r\nof men, before it can be possible to save the masses of them from\r\nentering into polygamy or prostitution, legal or illegal.\"[269]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony, 1871]\r\n\r\nSome of Susan's' critics at home felt she was again besmirching the\r\nsuffrage cause by setting foot in polygamous Utah, but this was of no\r\nmoment to her, for she saw the crying need of the right kind of\r\nmissionary work among Mormon women, \"no Phariseeism, no shudders of\r\nPuritanic horror, ... but a simple, loving fraternal clasp of hands\r\nwith these struggling women\" to encourage them and point the way.\r\n\r\nHearing that Susan and Mrs. Stanton were in the West en route to\r\nCalifornia, Leland Stanford, Governor of California and president of\r\nthe recently completed Central Pacific Railway, sent them passes for\r\ntheir journey. They reached San Francisco with high hopes that they\r\ncould win the support of western men for their demand for woman\r\nsuffrage under the Fourteenth Amendment. Their welcome was warm and\r\nthe press friendly. An audience of over 1,200 listened with real\r\ninterest to Mrs. Stanton. Then the two crusaders made a misstep. Eager\r\nto learn the woman's side of the case in the recent widely publicized\r\nmurder of the wealthy attorney, Alexander P. Crittenden, by Laura\r\nFair, they visited Laura Fair in prison. Immediately the newspapers\r\nreported this move in a most critical vein, with the result that an\r\nuneasy audience crowded into the hall where Susan was to speak on \"The\r\nPower of the Ballot.\" As she proceeded to prove that women needed the\r\nballot to protect themselves and their work and could not count on the\r\nsupport and protection of men, she cited case after case of men's\r\nbetrayal of women. Then bringing home her point, she declared with\r\nvigor, \"If all men had protected all women as they would have their\r\nown wives and daughters protected, you would have no Laura Fair in\r\nyour jail tonight.\"[270]\r\n\r\nBoos and hisses from every part of the hall greeted this statement;\r\nbut Susan, trained on the antislavery platform to hold her ground\r\nwhatever the tumult, waited patiently until this protest subsided,\r\nstanding before the defiant audience, poised and unafraid. Then, in a\r\nclear steady voice, she repeated her challenging words. This time,\r\nabove the hisses, she heard a few cheers, and for the third time she\r\nrepeated, \"If all men had protected all women as they would have their\r\nown wives and daughters protected, you would have no Laura Fair in\r\nyour jail tonight.\"\r\n\r\nNow the audience, admiring her courage, roared its applause. \"I\r\ndeclare to you,\" she concluded, \"that woman must not depend upon the\r\nprotection of man, but must be taught to protect herself, and here I\r\ntake my stand.\"\r\n\r\nReading the newspapers the next morning, she found herself accused not\r\nonly of defending Laura Fair, but of condoning the murder of\r\nCrittenden. This story was republished throughout the state and\r\neagerly picked up by New York newspapers.\r\n\r\nAs it was now impossible for her or for Mrs. Stanton to draw a\r\nfriendly audience anywhere in California, they took refuge in the\r\nYosemite Valley for the next few weeks. Susan was inconsolable. These\r\nslanders on top of the loss of _The Revolution_ and the split in the\r\nsuffrage ranks seemed more than she could bear. \"Never in all my hard\r\nexperience have I been under such fire,\" she confided to her diary.\r\n\"The clouds are so heavy over me.... I never before was so cut\r\ndown.\"[271]\r\n\r\nNot until she had spent several days riding horseback in the Yosemite\r\nValley on \"men's saddles\" in \"linen bloomers,\" over long perilous\r\nexhausting trails, did the clouds begin to lift. Gradually the beauty\r\nand grandeur of the mountains and the giant redwoods brought her peace\r\nand refreshment, putting to flight \"all the old six-days story and the\r\n6,000 jeers.\"\r\n\r\nBearing the brunt of the censure in California, Susan expected Mrs.\r\nStanton to come to her defense in letters to the newspapers. When she\r\ndid not do so, Susan was deeply hurt, for in the past she had so many\r\ntimes smoothed the way for her friend. Even now, on their return to\r\nSan Francisco, where she herself did not yet dare lecture, she did her\r\nbest to build up audiences for Mrs. Stanton and to get correct\r\ntranscripts of her lectures to the papers. Disillusioned and\r\nheartsick, she was for the first time sadly disappointed in her\r\ndearest friend.\r\n\r\nMoving on to Oregon to lecture at the request of the pioneer\r\nsuffragist, Abigail Scott Duniway, she wrote Mrs. Stanton, who had\r\nleft for the East, \"As I rolled on the ocean last week feeling that\r\nthe very next strain might swamp the ship, and thinking over all my\r\nsins of omission and commission, there was nothing undone which\r\nhaunted me like the failure to speak the word at San Francisco again\r\nand more fully. I would rather today have the satisfaction of having\r\nsaid the true and needful thing on Laura Fair and the social evil,\r\nwith the hisses and hoots of San Francisco and the entire nation\r\naround me, than all that you or I could possibly experience from their\r\nunited eulogies with that one word unsaid.\"[272]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far Susan's western trip had netted her only $350. This was\r\ndisappointing in so far as she had counted upon it to reduce\r\nsubstantially her _Revolution_ debt. She now hoped to build her\r\nearnings up to $1,000 in Oregon and Washington. Everywhere in these\r\ntwo states people took her to their hearts and the press with a few\r\nexceptions was complimentary. The beauty of the rugged mountainous\r\ncountry compensated her somewhat for the long tiring stage rides over\r\nrough roads and for the cold uncomfortable lonely nights in poor\r\nhotels. Only occasionally did she enjoy the luxury of a good cup of\r\ncoffee or a clean bed in a warm friendly home.\r\n\r\nAt first in Oregon she was apprehensive about facing an audience\r\nbecause of her San Francisco experience, and she wrote Mrs. Stanton,\r\n\"But to the rack I must go, though another San Francisco torture be in\r\nstore for me.\"[273] She spoke on \"The Power of the Ballot,\" on women's\r\nright to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment, on the need of women to\r\nbe self-supporting, and clearly and logically she marshaled her facts\r\nand her arguments. Occasionally she obliged with a temperance speech,\r\nor gathered women together to talk to them about the social evil,\r\nrelieved when they responded to this delicate subject with earnestness\r\nand gratitude. Practice soon made her an easy, extemporaneous speaker.\r\nYet she was only now and then satisfied with her efforts, recording in\r\nher diary, \"Was happy in a real Patrick Henry speech.\"[274]\r\n\r\nThe proceeds from her lectures were disappointing, as money was scarce\r\nin the West that winter, and she had just decided to return to the\r\nEast to spend Christmas with her mother and sisters when she was urged\r\nto accept lecture engagements in California. Putting her own personal\r\nlongings behind her, she took the stage to California, sitting outside\r\nwith the driver so that she could better enjoy the scenery and learn\r\nmore about the people who had settled this new lonely overpowering\r\ncountry. \"Horrible indeed are the roads,\" she wrote her mother, \"miles\r\nand miles of corduroy and then twenty miles ... of black mud.... How\r\nmy thought does turn homeward, mother.\"[275]\r\n\r\nThis time she was warmly received in San Francisco. The prejudice, so\r\nvocal six months before, had disappeared. \"Made my Fourteenth\r\nAmendment argument splendidly,\" she wrote in her diary. \"All delighted\r\nwith it and me--and it is such a comfort to have the friends feel that\r\nI help the good work on.\"[276]\r\n\r\nShe was gaining confidence in herself and wrote her family, \"I miss\r\nMrs. Stanton. Still I can not but enjoy the feeling that the people\r\ncall on me, and the fact that I have an opportunity to sharpen my wits\r\na little by answering questions and doing the chatting, instead of\r\nmerely sitting a lay figure and listening to the brilliant\r\nscintillations as they emanate from her never-exhausted magazine.\r\nThere is no alternative--whoever goes into a parlor or before an\r\naudience with that woman does it at a cost of a fearful overshadowing,\r\na price which I have paid for the last ten years, and that cheerfully,\r\nbecause I felt our cause was most profited by her being seen and\r\nheard, and my best work was making the way clear for her.\"[277]\r\n\r\nStarting homeward through Wyoming and Nevada where she also had\r\nlecture engagements, she wrote in her diary on January 1, 1872, \"6\r\nmonths of constant travel, full 8000 miles, 108 lectures. The year's\r\nwork full 13,000 miles travel--170 meetings.\" On the train she met the\r\nnew California Senator, Aaron A. Sargent, his wife Ellen, and their\r\nchildren. A warm friendship developed on this long journey during\r\nwhich the train was stalled in deep snow drifts. \"This is indeed a\r\nfearful ordeal, fastened here ... midway of the continent at the top\r\nof the Rocky mountains,\" she recorded. \"The railroad has supplied the\r\npassengers with soda crackers and dried fish.... Mrs. Sargent and I\r\nhave made tea and carried it throughout the train to the nursing\r\nmothers.\"[278] The Sargents had brought their own food for the journey\r\nand shared it with Susan. This and the good conversation lightened the\r\nordeal for her, especially as both Senator and Mrs. Sargent believed\r\nheartily in woman's rights, and Senator Sargent in his campaign for\r\nthe Senate had boldly announced his endorsement of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis friendly attitude among western men toward votes for women was\r\nthe most encouraging development in Susan's long uphill fight. These\r\nmen, looking upon women as partners who had shared with them the\r\ndangers and hardships of the frontier, recognized at once the justice\r\nof woman suffrage and its benefit to the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan traveled directly from Nevada to Washington instead of breaking\r\nher journey by a visit with her brothers in Kansas, as she had hoped\r\nto do. She even omitted Rochester so that she might be in time for the\r\nnational woman suffrage convention in Washington in January 1872, for\r\nwhich Mrs. Hooker, Mrs. Davis, and Mrs. Stanton were preparing. She\r\nfound Victoria Woodhull with them, her presence provoking criticism\r\nand dissension.\r\n\r\nImpulsively she came to Victoria's defense at the convention: \"I have\r\nbeen asked by many, 'Why did you drag Victoria Woodhull to the front?'\r\nNow, bless your souls, she was not dragged to the front. She came to\r\nWashington with a powerful argument. She presented her Memorial to\r\nCongress and it was a power.... She had an interview with the\r\njudiciary committee. We could never secure that privilege. She was\r\nyoung, handsome, and rich. Now if it takes youth, beauty, and money to\r\ncapture Congress, Victoria is the woman we are after.\"[279]\r\n\r\n\"I was asked by an editor of a New York paper if I knew Mrs.\r\nWoodhull's antecedents,\" she continued. \"I said I didn't and that I\r\ndid not care any more for them than I do about those of the members of\r\nCongress.... I have been asked along the Pacific coast, 'What about\r\nWoodhull? You make her your leader?' Now we don't make leaders; they\r\nmake themselves.\"\r\n\r\nVictoria, however, did not prove to be the leading light of this\r\nconvention, although she made one of her stirring fiery speeches\r\ncalling upon her audience to form an Equal Rights party and nominate\r\nher for President of the United States. By this time, Susan had\r\nconcluded that Victoria Woodhull for President did not ring true and\r\nshe would have nothing to do with her self-inspired candidacy. Quickly\r\nshe steered the convention away from Victoria Woodhull for President\r\ntoward the consideration of the more practical matter of woman's right\r\nto vote under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\r\n\r\nThis time it was Susan, not Victoria, who was granted a hearing before\r\nthe Senate judiciary committee. \"At the close of the war,\" Susan\r\nreminded the Senators, \"Congress lifted the question of suffrage for\r\nmen above State power, and by the amendments prohibited the\r\ndeprivation of suffrage to any citizen by any State. When the\r\nFourteenth Amendment was first proposed ... we rushed to you with\r\npetitions praying you not to insert the word 'male' in the second\r\nclause. Our best friends ... said to us: 'The insertion of that word\r\nputs no new barrier against women; therefore do not embarrass us but\r\nwait until we get the Negro question settled.' So the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment with the word 'male' was adopted.[280]\r\n\r\n\"When the Fifteenth was presented without the word 'sex,'\" she\r\ncontinued, \"we again petitioned and protested, and again our friends\r\ndeclared that the absence of the word was no hindrance to us, and\r\nagain begged us to wait until they had finished the work of the war,\r\nsaying, 'After we have enfranchised the Negro, we will take up your\r\ncase.'\r\n\r\n\"Have they done as they promised?\" she asked. \"When we come asking\r\nprotection under the new guarantees of the Constitution, the same men\r\nsay to us ... to wait the action of Congress and State legislatures in\r\nthe adoption of a Sixteenth Amendment which shall make null and void\r\nthe word 'male' in the Fourteenth and supply the want of the word\r\n'sex' in the Fifteenth. Such tantalizing treatment imposed upon\r\nyourselves or any class of men would have caused rebellion and in the\r\nend a bloody revolution....\"\r\n\r\nUnconvinced of the urgency or even the desirability of votes for\r\nwomen, the Senate judiciary committee promptly issued an adverse\r\nreport, but Susan was assured that her cause had a few persistent\r\nsupporters in Congress when Benjamin Butler presented petitions to the\r\nHouse for a declaratory act for the Fourteenth Amendment and\r\nCongressman Parker of Missouri introduced a bill granting women the\r\nright to vote and hold office in the territories.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan now turned to the more sympathetic West to take her plea for\r\nwoman suffrage directly to the people. Speaking almost daily in\r\nKansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois, she had little time to think of\r\nthe work in the East; the glamor of Victoria Woodhull faded, and she\r\nrealized that her own hard monotonous spade work would in the long run\r\ndo more for the cause than the meteoric rise of a vivid personality\r\nwho gave only part of herself to the task.\r\n\r\nWhen letters came from Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Hooker showing plainly\r\nthat they were falling in with Victoria's plans to form a new\r\npolitical party, Susan at once dashed off these lines of warning: \"We\r\nhave no element out of which to make a political party, because there\r\nis not a man who would vote a woman suffrage ticket if thereby he\r\nendangered his Republican, Democratic, Workingmen's, or Temperance\r\nparty, and all our time and words in that direction are simply thrown\r\naway. My name must not be used to call any such meeting.\"[281]\r\n\r\nThen she added, \"Mrs. Woodhull has the advantage of us because she has\r\nthe newspaper, and she persistently means to run our craft into her\r\nport and none other. If she were influenced by women spirits ... I\r\nmight consent to be a mere sail-hoister for her; but as it is she is\r\nwholly owned and dominated by _men_ spirits and I spurn the whole lot\r\nof them....\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, as she looked over the latest copy of _Woodhull &\r\nClaflin's Weekly_, she was horrified to find her name signed to a call\r\nto a political convention sponsored by the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Immediately she telegraphed Mrs. Stanton to remove her\r\nname and wrote stern indignant letters begging her and Mrs. Hooker not\r\nto involve the National Association in Victoria Woodhull's\r\npresidential campaign. Although she herself had often called for a new\r\npolitical party while she was publishing _The Revolution_, she was\r\npractical enough to recognize that a party formed under Victoria\r\nWoodhull's banner was doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nReturning to New York, she found both Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Hooker\r\nstill completely absorbed in Victoria's plans. Bringing herself up to\r\ndate once more on the latest developments in the colorful life of\r\nVictoria Woodhull, she found that she had been lecturing on \"The\r\nImpending Revolution\" to large enthusiastic audiences and that she had\r\nagain been called into court by her family. Goaded to defiance by an\r\nincreasingly virulent press, Victoria had also begun to blackmail\r\nsuffragists who she thought were her enemies, among them Mrs. Bullard,\r\nMrs. Blake, and Mrs. Phelps. This made Susan take steps at once to\r\nfree the National Association of her influence.\r\n\r\nWhen Victoria Woodhull, followed by a crowd of supporters, sailed into\r\nthe first business session of the National Woman Suffrage Association\r\nin New York, announcing that the People's convention would hold a\r\njoint meeting with the suffragists, Susan made it plain that they\r\nwould do nothing of the kind, as Steinway Hall had been engaged for a\r\nwoman suffrage convention. With relief, she watched Victoria and her\r\nflock leave for a meeting place of their own. Disgruntled at what she\r\ncalled Susan's intolerance, Mrs. Stanton then asked to be relieved of\r\nthe presidency. Elected to take her place, Susan was now free to cope\r\nwith Victoria, should this again become necessary.\r\n\r\nNot to be outmaneuvered by Susan, Victoria made a surprise appearance\r\nnear the end of the evening session and moved that the convention\r\nadjourn to meet the next morning in Apollo Hall with the people's\r\nconvention. Quickly one of her colleagues seconded the motion. Susan\r\nrefused to put this motion, standing quietly before the excited\r\naudience, stern and somber in her steel-gray silk dress. Beside her on\r\nthe platform, Victoria, intense and vivid, put the motion herself, and\r\nit was overwhelmingly carried by her friends scattered among the\r\nsuffragists. Declaring this out of order because neither Victoria nor\r\nmany of those voting were members of the National Association, Susan\r\nin her most commanding voice adjourned the convention to meet in the\r\nsame place the next morning. Victoria, however, continued her demands\r\nuntil Susan ordered the janitor to turn out the lights. Then the\r\naudience dispersed in the darkness.\r\n\r\nWith these drastic measures, Susan rescued the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation from Victoria Woodhull, who had her own triumph later at\r\nApollo Hall, where, surrounded by wildly cheering admirers, she was\r\nnominated for President of the United States by the newly formed Equal\r\nRights party.\r\n\r\nReading about Victoria's nomination in the morning papers, Susan\r\nbreathed a prayer of gratitude for a narrow escape, recording in her\r\ndiary, \"There never was such a foolish muddle--all come of Mrs. S.\r\n[Stanton] consulting and conceding to Woodhull & calling a People's\r\nCon[vention].... All came near being lost.... I never was so hurt with\r\nthe folly of Stanton.... Our movement as such is so demoralized by\r\nletting go the helm of ship to Woodhull--though we rescued it--it was\r\nas by a hair breadth escape.\" She was surprised to find no\r\ncondemnation of her actions in _Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly_ but only\r\nthe implication that the suffragists were too slow for Victoria's\r\ngreat work.[282]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of some of the leading suffragists toward Victoria\r\nWoodhull remained a problem. Fortunately Mrs. Stanton came back into\r\nline, but both Mrs. Hooker and Mrs. Davis seemed bound to drift under\r\nVictoria's influence, and the promising young lawyer, Belva Lockwood,\r\ncampaigned for the Equal Rights party and its candidate Victoria\r\nWoodhull.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Victoria Woodhull's fortunes were speedily dropping from the\r\nsublime heights of a presidential nomination to the humiliation of\r\nfinancial ruin, the loss of her home, and the suspended publication\r\nof her _Weekly_, Susan was knocking at the doors of the Republican and\r\nDemocratic national conventions. She had previously appealed to the\r\nliberal Republicans, among whose delegates were her old friends George\r\nW. Julian, B. Gratz Brown, and Theodore Tilton, but they had ignored\r\nwoman suffrage and had nominated for President, Horace Greeley, now a\r\npersistent opponent of votes for women. The Democrats did no better.\r\nFaced with Grant as the strong Republican nominee, they too nominated\r\nHorace Greeley with B. Gratz Brown as his running mate, hoping by this\r\ncoalition to achieve victory. The Republicans, still unwilling to go\r\nthe whole way for woman suffrage by giving it the recognition of a\r\nplank in their platform, did, however, offer women a splinter at which\r\nSusan grasped eagerly because it was the first time an important,\r\npowerful political party had ever mentioned women in their platform.\r\n\r\n\"The Republican party,\" read the splinter, \"is mindful of its\r\nobligations to the loyal women of America for their noble devotion to\r\nthe cause of freedom; their admission to wider fields of usefulness is\r\nreceived with satisfaction; and the honest demands of any class of\r\ncitizens for equal rights should be treated with respectful\r\nconsideration.\"[283]\r\n\r\nThankful to have escaped involvement with Victoria Woodhull and her\r\nEqual Rights party just at this time when the Republicans were ready\r\nto smile upon women, Susan basked in an aura of respectability thrown\r\naround her by her new political allies. She was even hopeful that the\r\ntwo woman-suffrage factions could now forget their differences and\r\nwork together for \"the living, vital issue of today--freedom to\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nShe at once began speaking for the Republican party, looking forward\r\nto carrying the discussion of woman suffrage into every school\r\ndistrict and every ward meeting. In the beginning the Republicans were\r\ngenerous with funds, giving her $1,000 for women's meetings in New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, Rochester, and other large cities. For speakers\r\nshe sought both Lucy Stone and Anna E. Dickinson, but Lucy made it\r\nplain in letters to Mrs. Stanton that she would take no part in\r\nRepublican rallies conducted by Susan, and Anna responded with a\r\ntorrent of false accusations.[284] Only Mary Livermore of the American\r\nAssociation consented to speak at Susan's Republican rallies; but with\r\nMrs. Stanton, Mrs. Gage, and Olympia Brown to call upon, Susan did\r\nnot lack for effective orators.\r\n\r\nIn an _Appeal to the Women of America_, financed by the Republicans\r\nand widely circulated, she urged the election of Grant and Wilson and\r\nthe defeat of Horace Greeley, whom she described as women's most\r\nbitter opponent. \"Both by tongue and pen,\" she declared, \"he has\r\nheaped abuse, ridicule, and misrepresentation upon our leading women,\r\nwhile the whole power of the _Tribune_ had been used to crush our\r\ngreat reform....\"[285]\r\n\r\nBeyond this she was unwilling to go in criticizing her one-time\r\nfriend. In fact her sense of fairness recoiled at the ridicule and\r\ndefamation heaped upon Horace Greeley in the campaign. \"I shall not\r\njoin with the Republicans,\" she wrote Mrs. Stanton, \"in hounding\r\nGreeley and the Liberals with all the old war anathemas of the\r\nDemocracy.... My sense of justice and truth is outraged by the\r\nHarper's cartoons of Greeley and the general falsifying tone of the\r\nRepublican press. It is not fair for us to join in the cry that\r\neverybody who is opposed to the present administration is either a\r\nDemocrat or an apostate.\"[286]\r\n\r\nSusan sensed a change in the Republicans' attitude toward women, as\r\nthey grew increasingly confident of victory. Not only did they refuse\r\nfurther financial aid, but criticized Susan roundly because in her\r\nspeeches she emphasized woman suffrage rather than the virtues of the\r\nRepublican party. She ignored their complaints, and wrote Mrs.\r\nStanton, \"If you are willing to go forth ... saying that you endorse\r\nthe party on any other point ... than that of its recognition of\r\nwoman's claim to vote, _I_ am not....\"[287]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[262] A former Congressman from Ohio, a personal friend of Senator\r\nBenjamin Wade who was a loyal friend of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[263] _The Revolution_, V, March 19, 1870, pp. 154-155, 159.\r\n\r\n[264] Clipping from _Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly_, Susan B.

In the\r\ncase of the 5,346 householders of Manchester, the court held that\r\n\"every woman is personally incapable\" in a legal sense.[288] This\r\nlegal contest had been fully reported in _The Revolution_, and\r\ndisappointing as the verdict was, Susan looked upon this attempt to\r\nestablish justice as an indication of a great awakening and uprising\r\namong women.\r\n\r\nThere had also been heartening signs in her own country, which she\r\nhoped were the preparation for more successful militancy to come. She\r\nhad exulted in _The Revolution_ in 1868 over the attempt of women to\r\nvote in Vineland, New Jersey. Encouraged by the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen in Wyoming in 1869, Mary Olney Brown and Charlotte Olney French\r\nhad cast their votes in Washington Territory. A young widow, Marilla\r\nRicker, had registered and voted in New Hampshire in 1870, claiming\r\nthis right as a property holder, but her vote was refused. In 1871,\r\nNannette B. Gardner and Catherine Stebbins in Detroit, Catherine V.\r\nWhite in Illinois, Ellen R. Van Valkenburg in Santa Cruz, California,\r\nand Carrie S. Burnham in Philadelphia registered and attempted to\r\nvote. Only Mrs. Gardner's vote was accepted. That same year, Sarah\r\nAndrews Spencer, Sarah E. Webster, and seventy other women marched to\r\nthe polls to register and vote in the District of Columbia. Their\r\nballots refused, they brought suit against the Board of Election\r\nInspectors, carrying the case unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States.[289] Another test case based on the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment had also been carried to the Supreme Court by Myra Bradwell,\r\none of the first women lawyers, who had been denied admission to the\r\nIllinois bar because she was a woman.\r\n\r\nWith the spotlight turned on the Fourteenth Amendment by these women,\r\nlawyers here and there throughout the country were discussing the\r\nlegal points involved, many admitting that women had a good case. Even\r\nthe press was friendly.\r\n\r\nSusan had looked forward to claiming her rights under the Fourteenth\r\nand Fifteenth Amendments and was ready to act. She had spent the\r\nthirty days required of voters in Rochester with her family and as she\r\nglanced through the morning paper of November 1, 1872, she read these\r\nchallenging words, \"Now Register!... If you were not permitted to vote\r\nyou would fight for the right, undergo all privations for it, face\r\ndeath for it....\"[290]\r\n\r\nThis was all the reminder she needed. She would fight for this right.\r\nShe put on her bonnet and coat, telling her three sisters what she\r\nintended to do, asked them to join her, and with them walked briskly\r\nto the barber shop where the voters of her ward were registering.\r\nBoldly entering this stronghold of men, she asked to be registered.\r\nThe inspector in charge, Beverly W. Jones, tried to convince her that\r\nthis was impossible under the laws of New York. She told him she\r\nclaimed her right to vote not under the New York constitution but\r\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, and she read him its pertinent lines.\r\nOther election inspectors now joined in the argument, but she\r\npersisted until two of them, Beverly W. Jones and Edwin F. Marsh, both\r\nRepublicans, finally consented to register the four women.\r\n\r\nThis mission accomplished, Susan rounded up twelve more women willing\r\nto register. The evening papers spread the sensational news, and by\r\nthe end of the registration period, fifty Rochester women had joined\r\nthe ranks of the militants.\r\n\r\nOn election day, November 5, 1872, Susan gleefully wrote Elizabeth\r\nStanton, \"Well, I have gone and done it!!--positively voted the\r\nRepublican ticket--Strait--this A.M. at 7 o'clock--& swore my vote in\r\nat that.... All my three sisters voted--Rhoda deGarmo too--Amy Post\r\nwas rejected & she will immediately bring action against the\r\nregistrars.... Not a jeer not a word--not a look--disrespectful has\r\nmet a single woman.... I hope the mornings telegrams will tell of many\r\nwomen all over the country trying to vote.... I hope you voted\r\ntoo.\"[291]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElection day did not bring the general uprising of women for which\r\nSusan had hoped. In Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Connecticut, as in\r\nRochester, a few women tried to vote. In New York City, Lillie\r\nDevereux Blake and in Fayetteville, New York, Matilda Joslyn Gage had\r\ncourageously gone to the polls only to be turned away. Elizabeth\r\nStanton did not vote on November 5, 1872, and her lack of enthusiasm\r\nabout a test case in the courts was very disappointing to Susan.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that Susan B. Anthony had voted won immediate\r\nresponse from the press in all parts of the country. Newspapers in\r\ngeneral were friendly, the New York _Times_ boldly declaring, \"The act\r\nof Susan B. Anthony should have a place in history,\" and the Chicago\r\n_Tribune_ venturing to suggest that she ought to hold public office.\r\nThe cartoonists, however, reveling in a new and tempting subject,\r\ncaricatured her unmercifully, the New York Graphic setting the tone.\r\nSome Democratic papers condemned her, following the line of the\r\nRochester _Union and Advertiser_ which flaunted the headline, \"Female\r\nLawlessness,\" and declared that Miss Anthony's lawlessness had proved\r\nwomen unfit for the ballot.\r\n\r\nBefore she voted, Susan had taken the precaution of consulting Judge\r\nHenry R. Selden, a former judge of the Court of Appeals. After\r\nlistening with interest to her story and examining the arguments of\r\nBenjamin Butler, Francis Minor, and Albert G. Riddle in support of the\r\nclaim that women had a right to vote under the Fourteenth and\r\nFifteenth Amendments, he was convinced that women had a good case and\r\nconsented to advise her and defend her if necessary. Judge Selden, now\r\nretired from the bench because of ill health, was practicing law in\r\nRochester where he was highly respected. A Republican, he had served\r\nas lieutenant governor, member of the Assembly, and state senator.\r\nSusan had known him as one of the city's active abolitionists, a\r\nfriend of Frederick Douglass who had warned him to flee the country\r\nafter the raid on Harper's Ferry and the capture of John Brown. Such\r\na man she felt she could trust.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet for about two weeks after the election and it looked as\r\nif the episode might be forgotten in the jubilation over Grant's\r\nelection. Then, on November 18, the United States deputy marshal rang\r\nthe doorbell at 7 Madison Street and asked for Miss Susan B. Anthony.\r\nWhen she greeted him, he announced with embarrassment that he had come\r\nto arrest her.\r\n\r\n\"Is this your usual manner of serving a warrant?\" she asked in\r\nsurprise.[292]\r\n\r\nHe then handed her papers, charging that she had voted in violation of\r\nSection 19 of an Act of Congress, which stipulated that anyone voting\r\nknowingly without having the lawful right to vote was guilty of a\r\ncrime, and on conviction would be punished by a fine not exceeding\r\n$500, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years.\r\n\r\nThis was a serious development. It had never occurred to Susan that\r\nthis law, passed in 1870 to halt the voting of southern rebels, could\r\nactually be applicable to her. In fact, she had expected to bring suit\r\nagainst election inspectors for refusing to accept the ballots of\r\nwomen. Now charged with crime and arrested, she suddenly began to\r\nsense the import of what was happening to her.\r\n\r\nWhen the marshal suggested that she report alone to the United States\r\nCommissioner, she emphatically refused to go of her own free will and\r\nthey left the house together, she extending her wrists for the\r\nhandcuffs and he ignoring her gesture. As they got on the streetcar\r\nand the conductor asked for her fare, she further embarrassed the\r\nmarshal by loudly announcing, \"I'm traveling at the expense of the\r\ngovernment. This gentleman is escorting me to jail. Ask him for my\r\nfare.\" When they arrived at the commissioner's office, he was not\r\nthere, but a hearing was set for November 29.\r\n\r\nOn that day, in the office where a few years before fugitive slaves\r\nhad been returned to their masters, Susan was questioned and\r\ncross-examined, and she felt akin to those slaves. Proudly she\r\nadmitted that she had voted, that she had conferred with Judge Selden,\r\nthat with or without his advice she would have attempted to vote to\r\ntest women's right to the franchise.[293]\r\n\r\n\"Did you have any doubt yourself of your right to vote?\" asked the\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\n\"Not a particle,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 1872, in Rochester's common council chamber, before a\r\nlarge curious audience, Susan, the other women voters, and the\r\nelection inspectors were arraigned. People expecting to see bold\r\nnotoriety-seeking women were surprised by their seriousness and\r\ndignity. \"The majority of these law-breakers,\" reported the press,\r\n\"were elderly, matronly-looking women with thoughtful faces, just the\r\nsort one would like to see in charge of one's sick-room, considerate,\r\npatient, kindly.\"[294]\r\n\r\nThe United States Commissioner fixed their bail at $500 each. All\r\nfurnished bail but Susan, who through her counsel, Henry R. Selden,\r\napplied for a writ of habeas corpus, demanding immediate release and\r\nchallenging the lawfulness of her arrest. When a writ of habeas corpus\r\nwas denied and her bail increased to $1,000 by United States District\r\nJudge Nathan K. Hall, sitting in Albany, Susan was more than ever\r\ndetermined to resist the interference of the courts in her\r\nconstitutional right as a citizen to vote. She refused to give bail,\r\nemphatically stating that she preferred prison.\r\n\r\nSeeing no heroism but only disgrace in a jail term for his client and\r\nunwilling to let her bring this ignominy upon herself. Henry Selden\r\nchivalrously assured her that this was a time when she must be guided\r\nby her lawyer's advice, and he paid her bail. Ignorant of the\r\ntechnicalities of the law, she did not realize the far-reaching\r\nimplications of this well-intentioned act until they left the\r\ncourtroom and in the hallway met tall vigorous John Van Voorhis of\r\nRochester who was working on the case with Judge Selden. With the\r\nimpatience of a younger man, eager to fight to the finish, he\r\nexclaimed, \"You have lost your chance to get your case before the\r\nSupreme Court by writ of habeas corpus!\"[295]\r\n\r\nAghast, Susan rushed back to the courtroom, hoping to cancel the bond,\r\nbut it was too late. Bitterly disappointed, she remonstrated with\r\nHenry Selden, but he quietly replied, \"I could not see a lady I\r\nrespected in jail.\" She never forgave him for this, in spite of her\r\ncontinued appreciation of his keen legal mind, his unfailing kindness,\r\nand his willingness to battle for women.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days she appeared before the Federal Grand Jury in\r\nAlbany and was indicted on the charge that she \"did knowingly,\r\nwrongfully and unlawfully vote for a Representative in the Congress of\r\nthe United States....\"[296] Her trial was set for the term of the\r\nUnited States District Court, beginning May 13, 1873, in Rochester,\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Judge Henry R. Selden]\r\n\r\nDuring these difficult days in Albany, Susan found comfort and\r\ncourage, as in the past, in the friendliness of Lydia Mott's home.\r\nHere she planned the steps by which to win public approval and\r\nfinancial aid for her test case. She addressed the commission which\r\nwas revising New York's constitution on woman's right to vote under\r\nthe Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, pointing out that the law\r\nlimiting suffrage to males was nullified by this new interpretation.\r\nEager to spread the truth about her own legal contest, she distributed\r\nprinted copies of Judge Selden's argument. Then traveling to New York\r\nand Washington, she personally presented copies to newspaper editors\r\nand Congressmen. To one of these men she wrote, \"It is not for\r\nmyself--but for all womanhood--yes and all manhood too--that I most\r\nrejoice in the appeal to the legal mind of the Nation. It is no\r\nlonger whether women wish to vote, or men are willing, but it is\r\nwoman's Constitutional right.\"[297]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Susan was technically in the custody of the\r\nUnited States Marshal, who objected to her leaving Rochester, she\r\nmanaged to carry out a full schedule of lectures in Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois, and also the usual annual Washington and New York woman\r\nsuffrage conventions at which she told the story of her voting, her\r\narrest, and her pending trial, and where she received enthusiastic\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nBecause she wanted the people to understand the legal points on which\r\nshe based her right to vote, Susan spoke on \"The Equal Right of All\r\nCitizens to the Ballot\" in every district in Monroe County. So\r\nthorough and convincing was she that the district attorney asked for a\r\nchange of venue, fearing that any Monroe County jury, sitting in\r\nRochester, would be prejudiced in her favor. When her case was\r\ntransferred to the United States Circuit Court in Canandaigua, to be\r\nheard a month later, she immediately descended upon Ontario County\r\nwith her speech, \"Is It a Crime for a Citizen of the United States to\r\nVote?\" and Matilda Joslyn Gage joined her, speaking on \"The United\r\nStates on Trial, Not Susan B. Anthony.\"\r\n\r\nOn the lecture platform Susan wore a gray silk dress with a soft,\r\nwhite lace collar. Her hair, now graying, was smoothed back and\r\ntwisted neatly into a tight knot. Everything about her indicated\r\nrefinement and sincerity, and most of her audiences felt this.\r\n\r\n\"Our democratic-republican government is based on the idea of the\r\nnatural right of every individual member thereof to a voice and vote\r\nin making and executing the laws,\" she declared as she looked into the\r\nfaces of the men and women who had gathered to hear her, farmers,\r\nstorekeepers, lawyers, and housewives, rich and poor, a cross section\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nRepeating to them salient passages from the Declaration of\r\nIndependence and the Preamble to the Constitution, she added, \"It was\r\nwe, the people, not we, the white male citizens, nor yet we, the male\r\ncitizens: but we the whole people, who formed this Union. And we\r\nformed it, not to give the blessings of liberty, but to secure them;\r\nnot to the half of ourselves and the half of our posterity, but to the\r\nwhole people--women as well as men.\"[298]\r\n\r\nShe asked, \"Is the right to vote one of the privileges or immunities\r\nof citizens? I think the disfranchised ex-rebels, and the ex-state\r\nprisoners will agree with me that it is not only one of them, but the\r\none without which all the others are nothing.\"[299]\r\n\r\nQuoting for them the Fifteenth Amendment, she told them it had settled\r\nforever the question of the citizen's right to vote. The Fifteenth\r\nAmendment, she reasoned, applies to women, first because women are\r\ncitizens and secondly because of their \"previous condition of\r\nservitude.\" Defining a slave as a person robbed of the proceeds of his\r\nlabor and subject to the will of another, she showed how state laws\r\nrelating to married women had placed them in the position of slaves.\r\n\r\nAs she analyzed the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments\r\nand cited authorities for her conclusions, she left little doubt in\r\nthe minds of those who heard her that women were persons and citizens\r\nwhose privileges and immunities could not be abridged.\r\n\r\nOn this note she concluded: \"We ask the juries to fail to return\r\nverdicts of 'guilty' against honest, law-abiding, tax-paying United\r\nStates citizens for offering their votes at our elections ... We ask\r\nthe judges to render true and unprejudiced opinions of the law, and\r\nwherever there is room for doubt to give its benefit on the side of\r\nliberty and equal rights to women, remembering that 'the true rule of\r\ninterpretation under our national constitution, especially since its\r\namendments, is that anything for human rights is constitutional,\r\neverything against human rights unconstitutional.' And it is on this\r\nline that we propose to fight our battle for the ballot--all\r\npeaceably, but nevertheless persistently through to complete triumph,\r\nwhen all United States citizens shall be recognized as equals before\r\nthe law.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpeaking twenty-one nights in succession was arduous. \"So few see or\r\nfeel any special importance in the impending trial,\" she jotted down\r\nin her diary. In towns, such as Geneva, where she had old friends,\r\nlike Elizabeth Smith Miller, she was assured of a friendly welcome and\r\na good audience.[300]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The Woman Who Dared\"]\r\n\r\nAs the collections, taken up after her lectures, were too small to pay\r\nher expenses, her financial problems weighed heavily. The notes she\r\nhad signed for _The Revolution_ were in the main still unpaid, and\r\none of her creditors was growing impatient. She had recently paid her\r\ncounsel, Judge Selden, $200 and John Van Voorhis, $75, leaving only\r\n$3.45 in her defense fund, but as usual a few of her loyal friends\r\ncame to her aid, and both Judge Selden and John Van Voorhis, deeply\r\ninterested in her courageous fight, gave most of their time without\r\ncharge.[301]\r\n\r\nIf this campaign was a problem financially, it was a success in the\r\nmatter of nation-wide publicity. The New York _Herald_ exulted in\r\nhostile gibes at women suffrage and published fictitious interviews,\r\nridiculing Susan as a homely aggressive old maid, but the New York\r\n_Evening Post_ prophesied that the court decision would likely be in\r\nher favor. The Rochester _Express_ championed her warmly: \"All\r\nRochester will assert--at least all of it worth heeding--that Miss\r\nAnthony holds here the position of a refined and estimable woman,\r\nthoroughly respected and beloved by the large circle of staunch\r\nfriends who swear by her common sense and loyalty, if not by her\r\npeculiar views.\" In fact the consensus of opinion in Rochester was\r\nmuch like that of the woman who remarked, \"No, I am not converted to\r\nwhat these women advocate. I am too cowardly for that; but I am\r\nconverted to Susan B. Anthony.\"[302]\r\n\r\nThis, however, was far from the attitude of Lucy Stone's _Woman's\r\nJournal_, which had ignored Susan's voting in November 1872 because it\r\nwas out of sympathy with this militant move and with her\r\ninterpretation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Later, as\r\nher case progressed in the courts, the _Journal_ did give it brief\r\nnotice as a news item, but in 1873 when it listed as a mark of honor\r\nthe women who had worked wisely for the cause, Susan B. Anthony's name\r\nwas not among them, and this did not pass unnoticed by Susan; nor did\r\nthe fact that she was snubbed by the Congress of Women, meeting in New\r\nYork and sponsored by Mary A. Livermore, Julia Ward Howe, and Maria\r\nMitchell. This drawing away of women hurt her far more than newspaper\r\ngibes. In fact she was sadly disappointed in women's response to the\r\nherculean effort she was making for them.\r\n\r\nEven more disconcerting was the adverse decision of the Supreme Court\r\non the Myra Bradwell case, which at once shattered the confidence of\r\nmost of her legal advisors. The court held that Illinois had violated\r\nno provision of the federal Constitution in refusing to allow Myra\r\nBradwell to practice law because she was a woman and declared that the\r\nright to practice law in state courts is not a privilege or an\r\nimmunity of a citizen of the United States, nor is the power of a\r\nstate to prescribe qualifications for admission to the bar affected by\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, filing a\r\ndissenting opinion, lived up to Susan's faith in him, but Benjamin\r\nButler wrote her, \"I do not believe anybody in Congress doubts that\r\nthe Constitution authorizes the right of women to vote, precisely as\r\nit authorizes trial by jury and many other like rights guaranteed to\r\ncitizens. But the difficulty is, the courts long since decided that\r\nthe constitutional provisions do not act upon the citizens, except as\r\nguarantees, ex proprio vigore, and in order to give force to them\r\nthere must be legislation.... Therefore, the point is for the friends\r\nof woman suffrage to get congressional legislation.\"[303]\r\n\r\nSusan, however, never wavered in her conviction that she as a citizen\r\nhad a constitutional right to vote and that it was her duty to test\r\nthis right in the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[288] Ray Strachey, _Struggle_ (New York, 1930), pp. 113-116.\r\n\r\n[289] The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision of a lower court that\r\nwithout specific legislation by Congress, the 14th Amendment could not\r\noverrule the law of the District of Columbia which limited suffrage to\r\nmale citizens over 21. _History of Woman Suffrage_, II, pp. 587-601.\r\n\r\n[290] Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 423.\r\n\r\n[291] Nov. 5, 1872, Ida Husted Harper Collection, Henry E.

TO VOTE?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCharged with the crime of voting illegally, Susan was brought to trial\r\non June 17, 1873, in the peaceful village of Canandaigua, New York.\r\nSimply dressed and wearing her new bonnet faced with blue silk and\r\ndraped with a dotted veil,[304] she stoically climbed the court-house\r\nsteps, feeling as if on her shoulders she carried the political\r\ndestiny of American women. With her were her counsel, Henry R. Selden\r\nand John Van Voorhis, her sister, Hannah Mosher, most of the women who\r\nhad voted with her in Rochester, and Matilda Joslyn Gage, whose\r\ninterest in this case was akin to her own.\r\n\r\nIn the courtroom on the second floor, seated behind the bar, Susan\r\nwatched the curious crowd gather and fill every available seat. She\r\nwondered, as she calmly surveyed the all-male jury, whether they could\r\npossibly understand the humiliation of a woman who had been arrested\r\nfor exercising the rights of a citizen. The judge, Ward Hunt, did not\r\npromise well, for he had only recently been appointed to the bench\r\nthrough the influence of his friend and townsman, Roscoe Conkling, the\r\nundisputed leader of the Republican party in New York and a bitter\r\nopponent of woman suffrage. She tried to fathom this small,\r\nwhite-haired, colorless judge upon whose fairness so much depended.\r\nPrim and stolid, he sat before her, faultlessly dressed in a suit of\r\nblack broadcloth, his neck wound with an immaculate white neckcloth.\r\nHe ruled against her at once, refusing to let her testify on her own\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nShe was completely satisfied, however, as she listened to Henry\r\nSelden's presentation of her case. Tall and commanding, he stood\r\nbefore the court with nobility and kindness in his face and eyes,\r\nbringing to mind a handsome cultured Lincoln. So logical, so just was\r\nhis reasoning, so impressive were his citations of the law that it\r\nseemed to her they must convince the jury and even the expressionless\r\njudge on the bench.\r\n\r\nPointing out that the only alleged ground of the illegality of Miss\r\nAnthony's vote was that she was a woman, Henry Selden declared, \"If\r\nthe same act had been done by her brother under the same\r\ncircumstances, the act would have been not only innocent and laudable,\r\nbut honorable; but having been done by a woman it is said to be a\r\ncrime.... I believe this is the first instance in which a woman has\r\nbeen arraigned in a criminal court, merely on account of her\r\nsex.\"[305] He claimed that Miss Anthony had voted in good faith,\r\nbelieving that the United States Constitution gave her the right to\r\nvote, and he clearly outlined her interpretation of the Fourteenth and\r\nFifteenth Amendments, declaring that she stood arraigned as a criminal\r\nsimply because she took the only step possible to bring this great\r\nconstitutional question before the courts.\r\n\r\nAfter he had finished, Susan followed closely for two long hours the\r\narguments of the district attorney, Richard Crowley, who contended\r\nthat whatever her intentions may have been, good or bad, she had by\r\nher voting violated a law of the United States and was therefore\r\nguilty of crime.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the district attorney's argument, Judge Hunt without\r\nleaving the bench drew out a written document, and to her surprise,\r\nread from it as he addressed the jury. \"The right of voting or the\r\nprivilege of voting,\" he declared, \"is a right or privilege arising\r\nunder the constitution of the State, not of the United States.[306]\r\n\r\n\"The Legislature of the State of New York,\" he continued, \"has seen\r\nfit to say, that the franchise of voting shall be limited to the male\r\nsex.... If the Fifteenth Amendment had contained the word 'sex,' the\r\nargument of the defendant would have been potent.... The Fourteenth\r\nAmendment gives no right to a woman to vote, and the voting of Miss\r\nAnthony was in violation of the law....\r\n\r\n\"There was no ignorance of any fact,\" he added, \"but all the facts\r\nbeing known, she undertook to settle a principle in her own person....\r\nTo constitute a crime, it is true, that there must be a criminal\r\nintent, but it is equally true that knowledge of the facts of the case\r\nis always held to supply this intent....\"\r\n\r\nThen hesitating a moment, he concluded, \"Upon this evidence I suppose\r\nthere is no question for the jury and that the jury should be directed\r\nto find a verdict of guilty.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately Henry Selden was on his feet, addressing the judge,\r\nrequesting that the jury determine whether or not the defendant was\r\nguilty of crime.\r\n\r\nJudge Hunt, however, refused and firmly announced, \"The question,\r\ngentlemen of the jury, in the form it finally takes, is wholly a\r\nquestion or questions of law, and I have decided as a question of law,\r\nin the first place, that under the Fourteenth Amendment which Miss\r\nAnthony claims protects her, she was not protected in a right to vote.\r\n\r\n\"And I have decided also,\" he continued, \"that her belief and the\r\nadvice which she took does not protect her in the act which she\r\ncommitted. If I am right in this, the result must be a verdict on your\r\npart of guilty, and therefore I direct that you find a verdict of\r\nguilty.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Henry Selden was on his feet. \"That is a direction,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"that no court has power to make in a criminal case.\"\r\n\r\nThe courtroom was tense. Susan, watching the jury and wondering if\r\nthey would meekly submit to his will, heard the judge tersely order,\r\n\"Take the verdict, Mr. Clerk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" intoned the clerk, \"hearken to your verdict\r\nas the Court has recorded it. You say you find the defendant guilty of\r\nthe offense whereof she stands indicted, and so say you all.\"\r\n\r\nClaiming exception to the direction of the Court that the jury find a\r\nverdict of guilty in this a criminal case. Henry Selden asked that the\r\njury be polled.\r\n\r\nTo this, Judge Hunt abruptly replied, \"No. Gentlemen of the jury, you\r\nare discharged.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night Susan recorded her estimate of Judge Hunt's verdict in her\r\ndiary in one terse sentence, \"The greatest outrage History ever\r\nwitnessed.\"[307]\r\n\r\nThe New York _Sun_, the Rochester _Democrat and Chronicle_, and the\r\nCanandaigua _Times_ were indignant over Judge Hunt's failure to poll\r\nthe jury. \"Judge Hunt,\" commented the _Sun_, \"allowed the jury to be\r\nimpanelled and sworn, and to hear the evidence; but when the case had\r\nreached the point of rendering the verdict, he directed a verdict of\r\nguilty. He thus denied a trial by jury to an accused party in his\r\ncourt; and either through malice, which we do not believe, or through\r\nignorance, which in such a flagrant degree is equally culpable in a\r\njudge, he violated one of the most important provisions of the\r\nConstitution of the United States.... The privilege of polling the\r\njury has been held to be an absolute right in this State and it is a\r\nsubstantial right ...\"[308]\r\n\r\nClaiming that the defendant had been denied her right of trial by\r\njury. Henry Selden the next day moved for a new trial. Judge Hunt\r\ndenied the motion, and, ordering the defendant to stand up, asked her,\r\n\"Has the prisoner anything to say why sentence shall not be\r\npronounced.\"[309]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your honor,\" Susan replied, \"I have many things to say; for in\r\nyour ordered verdict of guilty, you have trampled underfoot every\r\nvital principle of our government. My natural rights, my civil rights,\r\nmy political rights, my judicial rights, are all alike ignored....\"\r\n\r\nImpatiently Judge Hunt protested that he could not listen to a\r\nrehearsal of arguments which her counsel had already presented.\r\n\r\n\"May it please your honor,\" she persisted, \"I am not arguing the\r\nquestion but simply stating the reasons why sentence cannot in justice\r\nbe pronounced against me. Your denial of my citizen's right to vote is\r\nthe denial of my right of consent as one of the governed, the denial\r\nof my right of representation as one of the taxed, the denial of my\r\nright to a trial by a jury of my peers ...\"\r\n\r\n\"The Court cannot allow the prisoner to go on,\" interrupted Judge\r\nHunt; but Susan, ignoring his command to sit down, protested that her\r\nprosecutors and the members of the jury were all her political\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nAgain Judge Hunt tried to stop her, but she was not to be put off. She\r\nwas pleading for all women and her voice rang out to every corner of\r\nthe courtroom.\r\n\r\n\"The Court must insist,\" declared Judge Hunt, \"the prisoner has been\r\ntried according to established forms of law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your honor,\" admitted Susan, \"but by forms of law all made by\r\nmen, interpreted by men, administered by men, in favor of men, and\r\nagainst women....\"\r\n\r\n\"The Court orders the prisoner to sit down,\" shouted Judge Hunt. \"It\r\nwill not allow another word.\"\r\n\r\nUnheeding, Susan continued, \"When I was brought before your honor for\r\ntrial, I hoped for a broad and liberal interpretation of the\r\nConstitution and its recent amendments, that should declare all United\r\nStates citizens under its protecting aegis--that should declare\r\nequality of rights the national guarantee to all persons born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States. But failing to get this\r\njustice--failing, even, to get a trial by a jury _not_ of my peers--I\r\nask not leniency at your hands--but rather the full rigors of the\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more Judge Hunt tried to stop her, and acquiescing at last, she\r\nsat down, only to be ordered by him to stand up as he pronounced her\r\nsentence, a fine of $100 and the costs of prosecution.\r\n\r\n\"May it please your honor,\" she protested, \"I shall never pay a dollar\r\nof your unjust penalty. All the stock in trade I possess is a $10,000\r\ndebt, incurred by publishing my paper--_The Revolution_ ... the sole\r\nobject of which was to educate all women to do precisely as I have\r\ndone, rebel against your man-made, unjust, unconstitutional forms of\r\nlaw, that tax, fine, imprison, and hang women, while they deny them\r\nthe right of representation in the government.... I shall earnestly\r\nand persistently continue to urge all women to the practical\r\nrecognition of the old revolutionary maxim that 'Resistance to tyranny\r\nis obedience to God.'\"\r\n\r\nPouring cold water on this blaze of oratory. Judge Hunt tersely\r\nremarked that the Court would not require her imprisonment pending the\r\npayment of her fine.\r\n\r\nThis shrewd move, obviously planned in advance, made it impossible to\r\ncarry the case to the United States Supreme Court by writ of habeas\r\ncorpus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, Susan was on hand for the trial of the three\r\nelection inspectors. This time Judge Hunt submitted the case to the\r\njury but with explicit instructions that the defendants were guilty.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the inspectors, denied a\r\nnew trial, were each fined $25 and costs. Two of them, Edwin F. Marsh\r\nand William B. Hall, refused to pay their fines and were sent to jail.\r\nSusan appealed on their behalf to Senator Sargent in Washington, who\r\neventually secured a pardon for them from President Grant. He also\r\npresented a petition to the Senate, in January 1874, to remit Susan's\r\nfine, as did William Loughridge of Iowa to the House, but the\r\njudiciary committees reported adversely.\r\n\r\nBecause neither of these cases had been decided on the basis of\r\nnational citizenship and the right of a citizen to vote, Susan was\r\nheartsick. To have them relegated to the category of election fraud\r\nwas as if her high purpose had been trailed in the dust. Wishing to\r\nspread reliable information about her trial and the legal questions\r\ninvolved, she had 3,000 copies of the court proceedings printed for\r\ndistribution.[310]\r\n\r\nIt was hard for her to concede that justice for women could not be\r\nsecured in the courts, but there seemed to be no way in the face of\r\nthe cold letter of the law to take her case to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. This would have been possible on writ of habeas\r\ncorpus had Judge Hunt sentenced her to prison for failure to pay her\r\nfine, but this he carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nEven that intrepid fighter, John Van Voorhis, could find no loophole,\r\nand another of her loyal friends in the legal profession, Albert G.\r\nRiddle, wrote her, \"There is not, I think, the slightest hope from the\r\ncourts and just as little from the politicians. They will never take\r\nup this cause, never! Individuals will, parties never--till the thing\r\nis done.... The trouble is that man can govern alone, and that, though\r\nwoman has the right, man wants to do it, and if she wait for him to\r\nask her, she will never vote.... Either man must be made to see and\r\nfeel ... the need of woman's help in the great field of human\r\ngovernment, and so demand it; or woman must arise and come forward as\r\nshe never has, and take her place.\"[311]\r\n\r\nThe case of Virginia Minor of St. Louis still held out a glimmer of\r\nhope. She had brought suit against an election inspector for his\r\nrefusal to register her as a voter in the presidential election of\r\n1872, and the case of Minor vs. Happersett reached the United States\r\nSupreme Court in 1874. An adverse decision, on March 29, 1875,\r\ndelivered by Chief Justice Waite, a friend of woman suffrage, was a\r\nbitter blow to Susan and to all those who had pinned their faith on a\r\nmore liberal interpretation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\r\nAmendments.\r\n\r\nCarefully studying the decision, Susan tried to fathom its reasoning,\r\nso foreign to her own ideas of justice. \"Sex,\" she read, \"has never\r\nbeen made of one of the elements of citizenship in the United\r\nStates.... The XIV Amendment did not affect the citizenship of women\r\nany more than it did of men.... The direct question is, therefore,\r\npresented whether all citizens are necessarily voters.\"[312]\r\n\r\nShe read on: \"The Constitution does not define the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens.... In this case we need not determine what\r\nthey are, but only whether suffrage is necessarily one of them. It\r\ncertainly is nowhere made so in express terms....\r\n\r\n\"When the Constitution of the United States was adopted, all the\r\nseveral States, with the exception of Rhode Island, had Constitutions\r\nof their own.... We find in no State were all citizens permitted to\r\nvote.... Women were excluded from suffrage in nearly all the States by\r\nthe express provision of their constitutions and laws ... No new State\r\nhas ever been admitted to the Union which has conferred the right of\r\nsuffrage upon women, and this has never been considered valid\r\nobjection to her admission. On the contrary ... the right of suffrage\r\nwas withdrawn from women as early as 1807 in the State of New Jersey,\r\nwithout any attempt to obtain the interference of the United States to\r\nprevent it. Since then the governments of the insurgent States have\r\nbeen reorganized under a requirement that, before their\r\nRepresentatives could be admitted to seats in Congress, they must have\r\nadopted new Constitutions, republican in form. In no one of these\r\nConstitutions was suffrage conferred upon women, and yet the States\r\nhave all been restored to their original position as States in the\r\nUnion ... Certainly if the courts can consider any question settled,\r\nthis is one....\r\n\r\n\"Our province,\" concluded Chief Justice Waite, \"is to decide what the\r\nlaw is, not to declare what it should be.... Being unanimously of the\r\nopinion that the Constitution of the United States does not confer the\r\nright of suffrage upon any one, and that the Constitutions and laws of\r\nthe several States which commit that important trust to men alone are\r\nnot necessarily void, we affirm the judgment of the Court below.\"\r\n\r\n\"A states-rights document,\" Susan called this decision and she scored\r\nit as inconsistent with the policies of a Republican administration\r\nwhich, through the Civil War amendments, had established federal\r\ncontrol over the rights and privileges of citizens. If the\r\nConstitution does not confer the right of suffrage, she asked herself,\r\nwhy does it define the qualifications of those voting for members of\r\nthe House of Representatives? How about the enfranchisement of Negroes\r\nby federal amendment or the enfranchisement of foreigners? Why did\r\nthe federal government interfere in her case, instead of leaving it in\r\nthe hands of the state of New York?\r\n\r\nLike most abolitionists, Susan had always regarded the principles of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence as underlying the Constitution and as\r\nthe essence of constitutional law. In her opinion, the interpretation\r\nof the Constitution in the Virginia Minor case was not only out of\r\nharmony with the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, but also\r\ncontrary to the wise counsel of the great English jurist, Sir Edward\r\nCoke, who said, \"Whenever the question of liberty runs doubtful, the\r\ndecision must be given in favor of liberty.\"[313]\r\n\r\nIn the face of such a ruling by the highest court in the land, she was\r\nhelpless. Women were shut out of the Constitution and denied its\r\nprotection. From here on there was only one course to follow, to press\r\nagain for a Sixteenth Amendment to enfranchise women.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[304] Ms., Diary, April 26, 1873.\r\n\r\n[305] _Trial_, p. 17.\r\n\r\n[306] _Ibid._, pp. 62-68.\r\n\r\n[307] Ms., Diary, June 18, 1873.\r\n\r\n[308] Susan B.

The Rochester\r\n_Democrat and Chronicle_ called the booklet \"the most important\r\ncontribution yet made to the discussion of woman suffrage from a legal\r\nstandpoint.\" The _Woman's Suffrage Journal_, IV, Aug. 1, 1873, p. 121,\r\npublished in England by Lydia Becker, said: \"The American law which\r\nmakes it a criminal offense for a person to vote who is not legally\r\nqualified appears harsh to our ideas.\"\r\n\r\n[311] Harper, _Anthony_, I, pp. 455-456.\r\n\r\n[312] _History of Woman Suffrage_, II, pp. 737-739, 741-742.\r\n\r\n[313] _Trial_, p. 191.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL PURITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitancy among the suffragists continued to flare up here and there\r\nin resistance to taxation without representation. Abby Kelley Foster's\r\nhome in Worcester was sold for taxes for a mere fraction of its worth,\r\nwhile in Glastonbury, Connecticut, Abby and Julia Smith's cows and\r\npersonal property were seized for taxes. Both Dr. Harriot K. Hunt in\r\nBoston and Mary Anthony in Rochester continued their tax protests.\r\nMuch as Susan admired this spirited rebellion, she recognized that\r\nthese militant gestures were but flames in the wind unless they had\r\nbehind them a well-organized, sustained campaign for a Sixteenth\r\nAmendment, and this she could not undertake until _The Revolution_\r\ndebt was paid. Nor was there anyone to pinch-hit for her since\r\nErnestine Rose had returned to England and Mrs. Stanton gave all her\r\ntime to Lyceum lectures.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the prospect looked bleak for woman suffrage. In\r\nCongress, there was not the slightest hope of the introduction of or\r\naction on a Sixteenth Amendment. In the states, interest was kept\r\nalive by woman suffrage bills before the legislatures, and year by\r\nyear, with more people recognizing the inherent justice of the demand,\r\nthe margin of defeat grew smaller. Whenever these state contests were\r\ncritical, Susan managed to be on hand, giving up profitable lecture\r\nengagements to speak without fees; in Michigan in 1874 and in Iowa in\r\n1875, she made new friends for the cause but was unable to stem the\r\ntide of prejudice against granting women the vote. After the defeat in\r\nMichigan, she wrote in her diary, \"Every whisky maker, vendor,\r\ndrinker, gambler, every ignorant besotted man is against us, and then\r\nthe other extreme, every narrow, selfish religious bigot.\"[314]\r\n\r\nA new militant movement swept the country in 1874, starting in small\r\nOhio towns among women who were so aroused over the evil influence of\r\nliquor on husbands, sons, fathers, and brothers, that they gathered in\r\nfront of saloons to sing and pray, hoping to persuade drunkards to\r\nreform and saloon keepers to close their doors. Out of this uprising,\r\nthe Women's Christian Temperance Union developed, and within the next\r\nfew years was organized into a powerful reform movement by a young\r\nschoolteacher from Illinois, Frances E. Willard.\r\n\r\nA lifelong advocate of temperance, Susan had long before reached the\r\nconclusion that this reform could not be achieved by a strictly\r\ntemperance or religious movement, but only through the votes of women.\r\nNevertheless, she lent a helping hand to the Rochester women who\r\norganized a branch of the W.C.T.U., but she told them just how she\r\nfelt: \"The best thing this organization will do for you will be to\r\nshow you how utterly powerless you are to put down the liquor traffic.\r\nYou can never talk down or sing down or pray down an institution which\r\nis voted into existence. You will never be able to lessen this evil\r\nuntil you have votes.\"[315]\r\n\r\nAs she traveled through the West for the Lyceum Bureau, she did what\r\nshe could to stimulate interest in a federal woman suffrage amendment,\r\nspeaking out of a full heart and with sure knowledge on \"Bread and the\r\nBallot\" and \"The Power of the Ballot,\" earning on the average $100 a\r\nweek, which she applied to the _Revolution_ debt.\r\n\r\nLyceum lecturers were now at the height of their\r\npopularity,--particularly in the West, where in the little towns\r\nscattered across the prairies there were few libraries and theaters,\r\nand the distribution of books, magazines, and newspapers in no way met\r\nthe people's thirst for information or entertainment. Men, women, and\r\nchildren rode miles on horseback or drove over rough roads in wagons\r\nto see and hear a prominent lecturer. Susan was always a drawing card,\r\nfor a woman on the lecture platform still was a novelty and almost\r\neveryone was curious about Susan B. Anthony. Many, to their surprise,\r\ndiscovered she was not the caricature they had been led to believe.\r\nShe looked very ladylike and proper as she stood before them in her\r\ndark silk platform dress, a little too stern and serious perhaps, but\r\nfrequently her face lighted up with a friendly smile. She spoke to\r\nthem as equals and they could follow her reasoning. Her simple\r\nconversational manner was refreshing after the sonorous pretentious\r\noratory of other lecturers.\r\n\r\nContinuous travel in all kinds of weather was difficult. Branch lines\r\nwere slow and connections poor. Often trains were delayed by\r\nblizzards, and then to keep her engagements she was obliged to travel\r\nby sleigh over the snowy prairies. There were long waits in dingy\r\ndirty railroad stations late at night. Even there she was always busy,\r\nreading her newspapers in the dim light or dashing off letters home on\r\nany scrap of paper she had at hand, thinking gratefully of her sister\r\nMary who in addition to her work as superintendent of the neighborhood\r\npublic school, supervised the household at 7 Madison Street. Hotel\r\nrooms were cold and drab, the food was uninviting, and only\r\noccasionally did she find to her delight \"a Christian cup of\r\ncoffee.\"[316] She often felt that the Lyceum Bureau drove her\r\nunnecessarily hard, routed her inefficiently, and profited too\r\ngenerously from her labors. Now and then she dispensed with their\r\nservices, sent out her own circulars soliciting engagements, and\r\narranged her own tours, proving to her satisfaction that a woman could\r\nbe as businesslike as a man and sometimes more so.[317]\r\n\r\nWeighed down by worry over the illness of her sisters, Guelma and\r\nHannah, she felt a lack of fire and enthusiasm in her work. Anxiously\r\nshe waited for letters from home, and when none reached her she was in\r\ndespair. At such times, hotel rooms seemed doubly lonely and she\r\nreproached herself for being away from home and for putting too heavy\r\na burden on her sister Mary. Yet there was nothing else to be done\r\nuntil the _Revolution_ debt was paid, for some of her creditors were\r\nbecoming impatient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs often as possible Susan returned to Rochester to be with her\r\nfamily, and was able to nurse Guelma through the last weeks of her\r\nillness. Heartbroken when she died, in November 1873, she resolved to\r\ntake better care of Hannah, sending her out to Colorado and Kansas for\r\nher health. She then tried to spend the summer months at home so that\r\nMary could visit Hannah in Colorado and Daniel and Merritt in Kansas.\r\n\r\nThese months at home with her mother whom she dearly loved were a\r\ngreat comfort to them both. They enjoyed reading aloud, finding George\r\nEliot's _Middlemarch_ and Hawthorne's _Scarlet Letter_ of particular\r\ninterest as Susan was searching for the answers to many questions\r\nwhich had been brought into sharp focus by the Beecher-Tilton case,\r\nnow filling the newspapers. Like everyone else, she read the latest\r\ndevelopments in this tragic involvement of three of her good friends.\r\nShe was especially concerned about Elizabeth and Theodore Tilton, in\r\nwhose home she had so often visited and toward whom she felt a warm\r\nmotherly affection. Her sympathy went out to Elizabeth Tilton, whose\r\nhelp and loyalty during the difficult days of _The Revolution_ she\r\nnever forgot. Although she had often differed with Theodore, whose\r\nquick changes of policy and temperament she could not understand, he\r\nhad won her gratitude many times by befriending the cause. The same\r\nwas true of Henry Ward Beecher, who had found time in his busy life to\r\nsay a good word for woman's rights.\r\n\r\nSusan was close to the facts, for in desperation a few years before,\r\nElizabeth Tilton had confided in her. Unfortunately both Elizabeth and\r\nTheodore had made confidants of others less wise than Susan. Mrs.\r\nStanton had passed the story along to Victoria Woodhull, who late in\r\n1872 had revived her _Weekly_ for a crusade on what she called \"the\r\nsocial question\" and had published her expose, \"The Beecher-Tilton\r\nScandal Case.\" As a result the lives of all involved were being ruined\r\nby merciless publicity.\r\n\r\nThe Beecher-Tilton story as it unfolded revealed three admirable\r\npeople caught in a tangled web of human relationships. Henry Ward\r\nBeecher, for years a close friend and benefactor of his young\r\nparishioners, Theodore and Elizabeth Tilton, had been accused by\r\nTheodore of immoral relations with Elizabeth. Accusations and denials\r\ncontinued while intrigue and negotiations deepened the confusion. The\r\nwhole matter burst into flame in 1874 in the trial of Henry Ward\r\nBeecher before a committee of Plymouth Church, which exonerated him.\r\nReading Beecher's statement in her newspaper, Susan impulsively wrote\r\nIsabella Beecher Hooker, \"Wouldn't you think if God ever did strike\r\nanyone dead for telling a lie, he would have struck then?\"[318]\r\n\r\nWhen early in 1875 the Beecher-Tilton case reached the courts in a\r\nsuit brought by Theodore Tilton against Henry Ward Beecher for the\r\nalienation of his wife's affections, it became headline news\r\nthroughout the country. The press, greedy for sensation, published\r\nanything and everything even remotely connected with the case.\r\nReporters hounded Susan, who by this time was again lecturing in the\r\nWest, and she seldom entered a train, bus, or hotel without finding\r\nthem at her heels, as if by their very persistence they meant to force\r\nher to express her opinion regarding the guilt or innocence of Henry\r\nWard Beecher. They never caught her off guard and she steadfastly\r\nrefused to reveal to them, or to the lawyers of either side, who\r\nastutely approached her, the story which Elizabeth Tilton had told her\r\nin confidence. Yet in spite of her continued silence, she was twice\r\nquoted by the press, once through the impulsiveness of Mrs. Stanton,\r\nwho expressed herself frankly at every opportunity, and again when the\r\nNew York _Graphic_ without Susan's consent published her letter to\r\nMrs. Hooker.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy of the public was generally with Henry Ward Beecher,\r\nwhose popularity and prestige were tremendous. A dynamic preacher,\r\nwhose sermons drew thousands to his church and whose written word\r\ncarried religion and comfort to every part of the country, he could\r\nnot suddenly be ruined by the circulation of a scandal or even by a\r\nsensational trial. Behind him were all those who were convinced that\r\nthe future of the Church and Morality demanded his vindication. On his\r\nside, also, as Susan well knew, was the powerful, behind-the-scenes\r\ninfluence of the financial interests who profited from Plymouth Church\r\nreal estate, from the earnings of Beecher's paper, _Christian Union_,\r\nand from his book the _Life of Christ_, now in preparation and for\r\nwhich he had already been paid $20,000.\r\n\r\nSusan and Mrs. Stanton paid the penalty of being on the unpopular\r\nside. When Elizabeth Tilton was not allowed to testify in her own\r\ndefense, they accused Beecher and Tilton of ruthlessly sacrificing her\r\nto save their own reputations. In fact, Susan and Mrs. Stanton knew\r\nfar too much about the case for the comfort of either Beecher or\r\nTilton, and to discredit them, a whispering campaign, and then a press\r\ncampaign was initiated against them. They and their National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association were again accused of upholding free love. Their\r\nprevious association with Victoria Woodhull was held against them, as\r\nwere the frank discussions of marriage and divorce published in _The\r\nRevolution_ six years before.\r\n\r\nActually Susan's views on marriage were idealistic. \"I hate the whole\r\ndoctrine of 'variety' or 'promiscuity,'\" she wrote John Hooker, the\r\nhusband of her friend Isabella. \"I am not even a believer in second\r\nmarriages after one of the parties is dead, so sacred and binding do I\r\nconsider the marriage relation.\"[319]\r\n\r\nAlthough in public Susan uttered not one word relating to the guilt or\r\ninnocence of Henry Ward Beecher, she did confide her real feelings to\r\nher diary. She believed that to save himself Beecher was withholding\r\nthe explanation which the situation demanded. \"It is almost an\r\nimpossibility,\" she wrote in her diary, \"for a man and a woman to have\r\na close sympathetic friendship without the tendrils of one soul\r\nbecoming fastened around the other, with the result of infinite pain\r\nand anguish.\" Then again she wrote, \"There is nothing more\r\ndemoralizing than lying. The act itself is scarcely so base as the lie\r\nwhich denies it.\"[320]\r\n\r\nSusan's silence probably brought her more notoriety than anything she\r\ncould have said on this much discussed subject, and it heightened her\r\nreputation for honesty and integrity. \"Miss Anthony,\" commented the\r\nNew York _Sun_, \"is a lady whose word will everywhere be believed by\r\nthose who know anything of her character.\" The Rochester _Democrat and\r\nChronicle_ had this to say: \"Whether she will make any definite\r\nrevelations remains to be seen, but whatever she does say will be\r\nreceived by the public with that credit which attaches to the evidence\r\nof a truthful witness. Her own character, known and honored by the\r\ncountry, will give importance to any utterances she may make.\"[321]\r\n\r\nShe was not called as a witness by either side during the 112 days of\r\ntrial which ended in July 1875 with the jury unable to agree on a\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRealizing that many taboos were being broken down by the lurid\r\nnation-wide publicity on the Beecher-Tilton case and that as a result\r\npeople were more willing to consider subjects which hitherto had not\r\nbeen discussed in polite society, Susan began to plan a lecture on\r\n\"Social Purity.\"\r\n\r\nShe was familiar with the public protest Englishwomen under the\r\nleadership of Josephine Butler were making against the state\r\nregulation of vice. Following with interest and admiration their\r\ncourageous fight for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, which\r\nplaced women suspected of prostitution under police power, Susan found\r\nencouragement in the support these reformers had received from such\r\nmen as John Stuart Mill and Jacob Bright. Such legislation, she\r\nresolved, must not gain a foothold in her country, because it not only\r\ndisregarded women's right to personal liberty but showed a dangerous\r\ncallousness toward men's share of responsibility for prostitution.\r\n\r\nShe was awake to the problems prostitution presented in cities like\r\nNew York and Washington, its prevalence, the police protection it\r\nreceived, the political corruption it fostered and the reluctance of\r\nthe public to face the situation, the majority of men regarding it as\r\na necessity, and most women closing their eyes to its existence.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1875, while the Beecher-Tilton case was being\r\ntried in Brooklyn, she delivered her speech on \"Social Purity\" at the\r\nChicago Grand Opera House, in the Sunday dime-lecture course, facing\r\nwith trepidation the immense crowd which gathered to hear her. Even\r\nthe daring Mrs. Stanton had warned her that she would never be asked\r\nto speak in Chicago again, and with this the manager of the Slayton\r\nLecture Bureau agreed. But they were wrong. The people were hungry for\r\nthe truth and for a constructive policy. In the past they had heard\r\nthe \"social evil\" described and denounced in vivid thunderous words by\r\neloquent men and by the dramatic Anna E. Dickinson. Now an earnest\r\nwoman with graying hair, one of their own kind, talked to them without\r\nmincing matters, calmly and logically, and offered them a remedy.\r\n\r\nCalling their attention to the daily newspaper reports of divorce and\r\nbreach-of-promise suits, of wife murders and \"paramour\" shootings, of\r\nabortions and infanticide, she told them that the prevalence of these\r\nevils showed clearly that men were incapable of coping with them\r\nsuccessfully and needed the help of women. She cited statistics,\r\nrevealing 20,000 prostitutes in the city of New York, where a\r\nfoundling hospital during the first six months of its existence\r\nrescued 1,300 waifs laid in baskets on its doorstep. She courageously\r\nmentioned the prevalence of venereal disease and spoke out against\r\nEngland's Contagious Diseases Acts which were repeatedly suggested for\r\nNew York and Washington and which she described as licensed\r\nprostitution, men's futile and disastrous attempt to deal with social\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nDeclaring that the poverty and economic dependence of women as well as\r\nthe passions of men were the causes of prostitution, she quoted more\r\nstatistics which showed a great increase in the poverty of women. Work\r\nformerly done in the household, she explained, was being gradually\r\ntaken over by factories, with the result that women in order to earn a\r\nliving had been forced to follow it out of the home and were\r\nsupporting themselves wholly or in part at a wage inadequate to meet\r\ntheir needs. No wonder many were tempted by food, clothes, and\r\ncomfortable shelter into an immoral life.\r\n\r\nHer solution was \"to lift this vast army of poverty-stricken women who\r\nnow crowd our cities, above the temptation, the necessity, to sell\r\nthemselves in marriage or out, for bread and shelter.\" \"Women,\" she\r\ntold them, \"must be educated out of their unthinking acceptance of\r\nfinancial dependence on man into mental and economic independence.\r\nGirls like boys must be educated to some lucrative employment. Women\r\nlike men must have an equal chance to earn a living.\"[322]\r\n\r\n\"Whoever controls work and wages,\" she continued, \"controls morals.\r\nTherefore we must have women employers, superintendents, committees,\r\nlegislators; wherever girls go to seek the means of subsistence, there\r\nmust be some woman. Nay, more; we must have women preachers, lawyers,\r\ndoctors--that wherever women go to seek counsel--spiritual, legal,\r\nphysical--there, too, they will be sure to find the best and noblest\r\nof their own sex to minister to them.\"\r\n\r\nThen she added, \"Marriage, to women as to men, must be a luxury, not a\r\nnecessity; an incident of life, not all of it.... Marriage never will\r\ncease to be a wholly unequal partnership until the law recognizes the\r\nequal ownership in the joint earnings and possessions.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked for the vote so that women would have the power to help make\r\nthe laws relating to marriage, divorce, adultery, breach of promise,\r\nrape, bigamy, infanticide, and so on. These laws, she reminded them,\r\nhave not only been framed by men, but are administered by men. Judges,\r\njurors, lawyers, all are men, and no woman's voice is heard in our\r\ncourts except as accused or witness, and in many cases the married\r\nwoman is denied the right to testify as to her guilt or innocence.\r\n\r\nNever before had the audience heard the case for social purity\r\npresented in this way and they listened intently. When the applause\r\nwas subsiding, Susan saw Parker Pillsbury and Bronson Alcott,\r\nfellow-lecturers on the Lyceum circuit, coming toward her, smiling\r\napproval. They were generous in their praise, Bronson Alcott\r\ndeclaring, \"You have stated here this afternoon, in a fearless manner,\r\ntruths that I have hardly dared to think, much less to utter.\"[323]\r\n\r\nShe repeated this lecture in St. Louis, in Wisconsin, and in Kansas,\r\nand while most city newspapers, acknowledging the need of facing the\r\nissues, praised her courage, small-town papers were frankly disturbed\r\nby a spinster's public discussion of the \"social evil,\" one paper\r\nobserving, \"The best lecture a woman can give the community ... on the\r\nsad 'evil' ... is the sincerity of her profound ignorance on the\r\nsubject.\"[324]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving bravely done her bit for social purity, Susan with relief\r\nturned again to her favorite lecture, \"Bread and the Ballot.\" Her\r\nmessage fell on fertile ground. These western men and women saw\r\njustice in her reasoning. Having broken with tradition by leaving the\r\nEast for the frontier, they could more easily drop old ways for new.\r\nWestern men also recognized the influence for good that women had\r\nbrought to lonely bleak western towns--better homes, cleanliness,\r\ncomfort, then schools, churches, law and order--and many of them were\r\nwilling to give women the vote. All they needed was prodding to\r\ntranslate that willingness into law.\r\n\r\nAs she continued her lecturing, she kept her watchful eye on her\r\nfamily and the annual New York and Washington conventions, attending\r\nto many of the routine details herself. Finally, on May 1, 1876, she\r\nrecorded in her diary, \"The day of Jubilee for me has come. I have\r\npaid the last dollar of the _Revolution_ debt.\"[325]\r\n\r\nEven the press took notice, the Chicago _Daily News_ commenting, \"By\r\nworking six years and devoting to the purpose all the money she could\r\nearn, she has paid the debt and interest. And now, when the creditors\r\nof that paper and others who really know her, hear the name of Susan\r\nB. Anthony, they feel inclined to raise their hats in reverence.\"[326]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[314] Ms., Diary, Nov. 4, 1874.\r\n\r\n[315] Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 457.

Susan\r\npointed out, however, that one hundred years after the signing of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, women were still deprived of basic\r\ncitizenship rights.\r\n\r\nAs an afterthought, a Woman's Pavilion had been erected on the\r\nexposition grounds and exhibited here she found only women's\r\ncontribution to the arts but nothing which would in any way show the\r\npart women had played in building up the country or developing\r\nindustry. She longed to explain so that all could hear how the skilled\r\nwork of women had contributed to the prosperous textile and shoe\r\nindustries, to the manufacture of cartridges and Waltham watches, and\r\ncountless other products. Could she have had her way, she would have\r\nmade the Woman's Pavilion an eloquent appeal for equal rights, but\r\nunable to do this, she established a center of rebellion for the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association at 1431 Chestnut Street, in\r\nparlors on the first floor. Here she spent many happy hours directing\r\nthe work, often sleeping on the sofa so that she could work late and\r\nsave money for the cause.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia had always been a friendly city because of Lucretia Mott.\r\nNow Lucretia came almost daily to the women's headquarters, bringing a\r\ncomforting sense of support, approval, and friendship. When Mrs.\r\nStanton, free at last from her lecture engagements, joined them in\r\nJune, Susan's happiness was complete and she confided to her diary,\r\n\"Glad enough to see her and feel her strength come in.\"[327]\r\n\r\nSusan and Mrs. Stanton now sent the Republican and Democratic national\r\nconventions well-written memorials pointing out the appropriateness of\r\nenfranchising women in this centennial year. But no woman suffrage\r\nplank was adopted by either party. Susan put Mrs. Stanton and Mrs.\r\nGage to work on a Women's Declaration of 1876, and so \"magnificent\" a\r\ndocument did they produce that she not only had many copies printed\r\nfor distribution but had one beautifully engrossed on parchment for\r\npresentation to President Grant at the Fourth of July celebration in\r\nIndependence Square.\r\n\r\nUnable to secure permission to present this declaration, she made\r\nplans of her own. For herself, she managed to get a press card as\r\nreporter for her brother's paper, the Leavenworth _Times_. Mrs.\r\nStanton and Lucretia Mott refused to attend the celebration, so\r\nindignant were they over the snubs women had received from the\r\nCentennial Commission, and they held a women's meeting at the First\r\nUnitarian Church. When at the last minute four tickets were sent Susan\r\nby the Centennial Commission, she gave them to the most militant of\r\nher colleagues, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Lillie Devereux Blake, Sarah\r\nAndrews Spencer, and Phoebe Couzins. With Susan in the lead, they\r\npushed through the jostling crowd to Independence Square on that\r\nbright hot Fourth of July and were seated among the elect on the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had learned that Thomas W. Ferry of Michigan, Acting\r\nVice President, would substitute for President Grant at the ceremony.\r\nBecause he was a good friend of woman suffrage, Phoebe Couzins made\r\none more effort for orderly procedure, sending him a note asking for\r\npermission to present the Women's Declaration. This failed, and rather\r\nthan take part in creating a disturbance, she withdrew, leaving her\r\nfour friends on the platform.\r\n\r\n\"We ... sat there waiting ...\" reported Mrs. Blake. \"The heat was\r\nfrightful.... Amid such a throng it was difficult to hear anything ...\r\nWe decided that our presentation should take place immediately after\r\nMr. Richard Lee of Virginia, grandson of the Signer, had read the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. He read it from the original document,\r\nand it was an impressive moment when that time-honored parchment was\r\nexposed to the view of the wildly cheering crowd.... Mr. Lee's voice\r\nwas inaudible, but at last I caught the words, 'our sacred honors,'\r\nand cried, 'Now is the time.'\r\n\r\n\"We all four rose, Miss Anthony first, next Mrs. Gage, bearing our\r\nengrossed Declaration, and Mrs. Spencer and myself following with\r\nhundreds of printed copies in our hands. There was a stir in the\r\ncrowd just at the time, and General Hawley who had been keeping a wary\r\neye on us, had relaxed his vigilance for a moment, as he signed to the\r\nband to resume playing. He did not see us advancing until we reached\r\nthe Vice President's dais. There Miss Anthony, taking the parchment\r\nfrom Mrs. Gage, stepped forward and presented it to Mr. Ferry, saying,\r\n'I present to you a Declaration of Rights from the women citizens of\r\nthe United States.'\"[328]\r\n\r\nNonplussed, Mr. Ferry bowed low and received the Declaration without a\r\nword. Then the four intrepid women filed out, distributing printed\r\ncopies of their declaration while General Hawley boomed out, \"Order!\r\nOrder!\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the square and mounting a platform erected for musicians in\r\nfront of Independence Hall, they waited until a curious crowd had\r\ngathered around them. Then while Mrs. Gage held an umbrella over Susan\r\nto shield her from the hot sun, she read the Women's Declaration in a\r\nloud clear voice that carried far.\r\n\r\n\"We do rejoice in the success, thus far, of our experiment of\r\nself-government,\" she began. \"Our faith is firm and unwavering in the\r\nbroad principles of human rights proclaimed in 1776, not only as\r\nabstract truths, but as the cornerstones of a republic. Yet we cannot\r\nforget, even in this glad hour, that while all men of every race, and\r\nclime, and condition, have been invested with the full rights of\r\ncitizenship under our hospitable flag, all women still suffer the\r\ndegradation of disfranchisement.\"[329]\r\n\r\nThen she enumerated women's grievances and the crowd applauded as she\r\ndrove home point after point.\r\n\r\n\"Woman,\" she continued, \"has shown equal devotion with man to the\r\ncause of freedom and has stood firmly by his side in its defense.\r\nTogether they have made this country what it is.... We ask our rulers,\r\nat this hour, no special favors, no special privileges.... We ask\r\njustice, we ask equality, we ask that all civil and political rights\r\nthat belong to the citizens of the United States be guaranteed to us\r\nand our daughters forever.\"\r\n\r\nStepping down from the platform into the applauding crowd which\r\neagerly reached for printed copies of the declaration, she and her\r\nfour companions hurried to the First Unitarian Church where an eager\r\naudience awaited their report and hailed their courage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aaron A. Sargent]\r\n\r\nThe New York _Tribune_, commenting on Susan's militancy, prophesied\r\nthat it foreshadowed \"the new forms of violence and disregard of order\r\nwhich may accompany the participation of women in active partisan\r\npolitics.\"[330]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNor was Congress impressed by Susan's centennial publicity demanding a\r\nfederal woman suffrage amendment. She had gathered petitions from\r\ntwenty-six states with 10,000 signatures which were presented to the\r\nSenate in 1877. The majority of the Senators found these petitions\r\nuproariously funny, and Susan in the visitors' gallery at the time of\r\ntheir presentation was infuriated by the mirth and disrespect of these\r\nmen. \"A few read the petitions as they would any other, with dignity\r\nand without comment,\" reported the popular journalist, Mary Clemmer,\r\nin her weekly Washington column, \"but the majority seemed intensely\r\nconscious of holding something unutterably funny in their hands....\r\nThe entire Senate presented the appearance of a laughing school\r\npracticing sidesplitting and ear-extended grins.\" After a few humorous\r\nand sarcastic remarks the petitions were referred to the Committee on\r\nPublic Lands. Only one Senator, Aaron A. Sargent of California, was\r\n\"man enough and gentleman enough to lift the petitions from this\r\ninsulting proposition.... He ... demanded for the petition of more\r\nthan 10,000 women at least the courtesy which would be given any\r\nother.\"[331]\r\n\r\nAlthough his words did not deter the Senators, Susan was proud of this\r\ntall vigorous white-haired Californian and grateful for his\r\nspontaneous support in this humiliating situation. He had been a\r\ntrusted friend and counselor ever since she had shared with him and\r\nhis family the long snowy journey from Nevada in 1872. She looked\r\nforward to the time when woman suffrage would have more such advocates\r\nin the Congress and when she would find there new faces and a more\r\nliberal spirit.\r\n\r\nDisappointment only drove Susan into more intensive activity. Between\r\nlectures she now nursed her sister Hannah who was critically ill in\r\nDaniel's home in Leavenworth. After Hannah's death in May 1877, Susan\r\nworked off her grief in Colorado, where the question of votes for\r\nwomen was being referred to the people of the state.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists in Colorado were headed by Dr. Alida Avery, who had\r\nleft her post as resident physician at the new woman's college,\r\nVassar, to practice medicine in Denver. Making Dr. Avery's home her\r\nheadquarters, Susan carried her plea for the ballot to settlements far\r\nfrom the railroads, traveling by stagecoach over rough lonely roads\r\nthrough magnificent scenery. Holding meetings wherever she could, she\r\nspoke in schoolhouses, in hotel dining rooms, and even in saloons,\r\nwhen no other place was available, and always she was treated with\r\nrespect and listened to with interest. Occasionally only a mere\r\nhandful gathered to hear her, but in Lake City she spoke to an\r\naudience of a thousand or more from a dry-goods box on the court-house\r\nsteps. She was equal to anything, but the mining towns depressed her,\r\nfor they were swarming with foreigners who had been welcomed as\r\nnaturalized, enfranchised citizens and who almost to a man opposed\r\nextending the vote to women. This precedence of foreign-born men over\r\nAmerican women was not only galling to her but menaced, she believed,\r\nthe growth of American democracy.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage was defeated in Colorado in 1877, two to one. With the\r\nChinese coming into the state in great numbers to work in the mines,\r\nthe specter that stalked through this campaign was the fear of putting\r\nthe ballot into the hands of Chinese women.\r\n\r\nFrom Colorado, Susan moved on to Nebraska with a new lecture, \"The\r\nHomes of Single Women.\" Although she much preferred to speak on \"Woman\r\nand the Sixteenth Amendment\" or \"Bread and the Ballot,\" she realized\r\nthat, in order to be assured of return engagements, she must\r\noccasionally vary her subjects, but she was unwilling to wander far\r\nafield while women's needs still were so great. By means of this new\r\nlecture she hoped to dispel the widespread, deeply ingrained fallacy\r\nthat single women were unwanted helpless creatures wholly dependent\r\nupon some male relative for a home and support. Aware that this\r\nmistaken estimate was slowly yielding in the face of a changing\r\neconomic order, she believed she could help lessen its hold by\r\npresenting concrete examples of independent self-supporting single\r\nwomen who had proved that marriage was not the only road to security\r\nand a home. She told of Alice and Phoebe Cary, whose home in New York\r\nCity was a rendezvous for writers, artists, musicians, and reformers;\r\nof Dr. Clemence Lozier, the friend of women medical students; of Mary\r\nL. Booth, well established through her income as editor of _Harper's\r\nBazaar_; and of her beloved Lydia Mott, whose home had been a refuge\r\nfor fugitive slaves and reformers.[332]\r\n\r\nIn Nebraska, she made a valuable new friend for the cause, Clara\r\nBewick Colby, whose zeal and earnest, intelligent face at once\r\nattracted her. Within a few years, Mrs. Colby established in Beatrice,\r\nNebraska, a magazine for women, the _Woman's Tribune_, which to\r\nSusan's joy spoke out for a federal woman suffrage amendment.\r\n\r\nBecause Susan's contract with the Slayton Lecture Bureau allowed no\r\nbreak in her engagements, she was obliged to leave the Washington\r\nconvention of the National Woman Suffrage Association in the hands of\r\nothers in 1878. It was much on her mind as she traveled through\r\nDakota, Minnesota, Missouri, and Kansas, and she sent a check for $100\r\nto help with the expenses of the convention. Particularly on her mind\r\nwas a federal woman suffrage amendment, for since 1869 when a\r\nSixteenth Amendment enfranchising women had been introduced in\r\nCongress and ignored, no further efforts along that line had been\r\nmade. Now good news came from Mrs. Stanton, who had attended the\r\nconvention. She had persuaded Senator Sargent to introduce in the\r\nSenate, on January 10, 1878, a new draft of a Sixteenth Amendment,\r\nfollowing the wording of the Fifteenth. It read, \"The right of\r\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged\r\nby the United States or by any State on account of sex.\"[333]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clara Bewick Colby]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years the Sixteenth Amendment made little headway,\r\nalthough the complexion of Congress changed, the Democrats breaking\r\nthe Republicans' hold and winning a substantial majority. Encouraging\r\nas was the more liberal spirit of the new Congress and the defeat of\r\nseveral implacable enemies, Susan found California's failure to return\r\nSenator Sargent an irreparable loss. In addition she now had to face a\r\nnewly formed group of anti-suffragists under the leadership of Mrs.\r\nDahlgren, Mrs. Sherman, and Almira Lincoln Phelps, who sang the\r\nrefrain which Congressmen loved to hear, that women did not want the\r\nvote because it would wreck marriage and the home.\r\n\r\nHoping to counteract this adverse influence by increased pressure for\r\nthe Sixteenth Amendment, Susan once more appealed for help to the\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association through her old friends, William\r\nLloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. Garrison replied that her efforts\r\nfor a federal amendment were premature and \"would bring the movement\r\ninto needless contempt.\" This she found strange advice from the man\r\nwho had fearlessly defied public opinion to crusade against slavery.\r\nWendell Phillips did better, writing, \"I think you are on the right\r\ntrack--the best method to agitate the question, and I am with you,\r\nthough between you and me, I still think the individual States must\r\nlead off, and that this reform must advance piecemeal, State by State.\r\nBut I mean always to help everywhere and everyone.\"[334]\r\n\r\nThe American Association continued to follow the state-by-state\r\nmethod, and this holding back aroused Susan to the boiling point, for\r\nexperience had taught her that in state elections woman suffrage faced\r\nthe prejudiced opposition of an ever-increasing number of naturalized\r\nimmigrants, who had little understanding of democratic government or\r\nsympathy with the rights of women. A federal amendment, on the other\r\nhand, depending for its adoption upon Congress and ratifying\r\nlegislatures, was in the hands of a far more liberal, intelligent, and\r\npreponderantly American group. \"We have puttered with State rights for\r\nthirty years,\" she sputtered, \"without a foothold except in the\r\nterritories.\"[335]\r\n\r\nYear by year she continued her Washington conventions, convinced that\r\nthese gatherings in the national capital could not fail to impress\r\nCongressmen with the seriousness of their purpose. As women from many\r\nstates lobbied for the Sixteenth Amendment, reporting a growing\r\nsentiment everywhere for woman suffrage, as they received in the press\r\nrespectful friendly publicity, Congressmen began to take notice. At\r\nthe large receptions held at the Riggs House, through the generosity\r\nof the proprietors, Jane Spofford and her husband, Congressmen became\r\nbetter acquainted with the suffragists, finding that they were not\r\ncranks, as they had supposed, but intelligent women and socially\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton's poise as presiding officer and the warmth of her\r\npersonality made her the natural choice for president of the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association through the years. Her popularity, now well\r\nestablished throughout the country after her ten years of lecturing\r\non the Lyceum circuit, lent prestige to the cause. To Susan, her\r\npresence brought strength and the assurance that \"the brave and true\r\nword\" would be spoken.[336] A new office had been created for Susan,\r\nthat of vice-president at large, and in that capacity she guided,\r\nsteadied, and prodded her flock.\r\n\r\nThe subjects which the conventions discussed covered a wide field\r\ngoing far beyond their persistent demands for a federal woman suffrage\r\namendment. Not only did they at this time urge an educational\r\nqualification for voters to combat the argument that woman suffrage\r\nwould increase the ignorant vote, but they also protested the counting\r\nof women in the basis of representation so long as they were\r\ndisfranchised. They criticized the church for barring women from the\r\nministry and from a share in church government. They took up the case\r\nof Anna Ella Carroll,[337] who had been denied recognition and a\r\npension for her services to her country during the Civil War, and they\r\nurged pensions for all women who had nursed soldiers during the war.\r\nThey welcomed to their conventions Mormon women from Utah who came to\r\nWashington to protest efforts to disfranchise them as a means of\r\ndiscouraging polygamy.\r\n\r\nSusan injected international interest into these conventions by\r\nreading Alexander Dumas's arguments for woman suffrage, letters from\r\nVictor Hugo and English suffragists, and a report by Mrs. Stanton's\r\nson, Theodore, now a journalist, of the International Congress in\r\nParis in 1878, which discussed the rights of women. Occasionally\r\nforeign-born women, now making new homes for themselves in this\r\ncountry, joined the ranks of the suffragists, and a few of them, like\r\nMadam Anneké and Clara Heyman from Germany contributed a great deal\r\nthrough their eloquence and wider perspective. These contacts with the\r\nthoughts and aspirations of men and women of other countries led Susan\r\nto dream of an international conference of women in the not too\r\ndistant future.[338]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[327] Ms., Diary, June 18, 1876.\r\n\r\n[328] Katherine D.

She also made it clear that although she\r\nworked for the amendment long and hard, she did not draft it. After\r\nher death, during the climax of the woman suffrage campaign, these\r\nfacts were overlooked by the younger workers who made a point of\r\nfeaturing the Susan B.

Men had always been the historians and had as a matter of\r\ncourse extolled men's exploits, passing over women's record as\r\nnegligible. Susan intended to remedy this and she was convinced that\r\nif women close to the facts did not record them now, they would be\r\nforgotten or misinterpreted by future historians. Already many of the\r\nold workers had died, Martha C. Wright, Lydia Mott, whom Susan had\r\nnursed in her last illness, Lucretia Mott, and William Lloyd Garrison.\r\nThere was no time to be lost.[339]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1880, Susan's mother died, and it was no longer\r\nnecessary for her to fit into her schedule frequent visits in\r\nRochester. Her sister Mary, busy with her teaching, was sharing her\r\nhome with her two widowed brothers-in-law and two nieces whose\r\neducation she was supervising.[340] Mrs. Stanton had just given up the\r\nstrenuous life of a Lyceum lecturer and welcomed work that would keep\r\nher at home. Susan, who had managed to save $4,500 out of her lecture\r\nfees, felt she could afford to devote at least a year to the history.\r\n\r\nShe now shipped several boxes of letters, clippings, and documents to\r\nthe Stanton home in Tenafly, New Jersey.[341] As they planned their\r\nbook, it soon became obvious that the one volume which they had hoped\r\nto finish in a few months would extend to two or three volumes and\r\ntake many years to write. They called in Matilda Joslyn Gage to help\r\nthem, and the three of them signed a contract to share the work and\r\nthe profits.\r\n\r\nThe history presented a publishing problem as well as a writing\r\nordeal, and Susan, interviewing New York publishers, found the subject\r\nhad little appeal. Finally, however, she signed a contract with Fowler\r\n& Wells under which the authors agreed to pay the cost of composition,\r\nstereotyping, and engravings; and as usual she raised the necessary\r\nfunds.[342]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Matilda Joslyn Gage]\r\n\r\nReturning to Tenafly as to a second home, Susan usually found Mrs.\r\nStanton beaming a welcome from the piazza and Margaret and Harriot\r\nrunning to the gate to meet her. The Stanton children were fond of\r\nSusan. It was a comfortable happy household, and Susan, thoroughly\r\nenjoying Mrs. Stanton's companionship, attacked the history with\r\nvigor. Sitting opposite each other at a big table in the sunny tower\r\nroom, they spent long hours at work. Susan, thin and wiry, her graying\r\nhair neatly smoothed back over her ears, sat up very straight as she\r\nrapidly sorted old clippings and letters and outlined chapters, while\r\nMrs. Stanton, stout and placid, her white curls beautifully arranged,\r\nwrote steadily and happily, transforming masses of notes into readable\r\neasy prose.[343]\r\n\r\nHaving sent appeals for information to colleagues in all parts of the\r\ncountry, Susan, as the contributions began to come in, struggled to\r\ndecipher the often almost illegible, handwritten manuscripts, many of\r\nthem careless and inexact about dates and facts. To their request for\r\ndata about her, Lucy Stone curtly replied, \"I have never kept a diary\r\nor any record of my work, and so am unable to furnish you the required\r\ndates.... You say 'I' must be referred to in the history you are\r\nwriting.... I cannot furnish a biographical sketch and trust you will\r\nnot try to make one. Yours with ceaseless regret that any 'wing' of\r\nsuffragists should attempt to write the history of the other.\"[344]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the writing fell upon Mrs. Stanton, but Matilda\r\nJoslyn Gage contributed the chapters, \"Preceding Causes,\" \"Women in\r\nNewspapers,\" and \"Women, Church, and State.\" Susan carefully selected\r\nthe material and checked the facts. She helped with the copying of the\r\nhandwritten manuscript and with the proofreading. Believing that\r\npictures of the early workers were almost as important for the\r\n_History_ as the subject matter itself, she tried to provide them, but\r\nthey presented a financial problem with which it was hard to cope, for\r\neach engraving cost $100.[345]\r\n\r\nWhen the first volume of the _History of Woman Suffrage_ came off the\r\npress in May 1881, she proudly and lovingly scanned its 878 pages\r\nwhich told the story of women's progress in the United States up to\r\nthe Civil War.\r\n\r\nShe was well aware that the _History_ was not a literary achievement,\r\nbut the facts were there, as accurate as humanly possible; all the\r\neloquent, stirring speeches were there, a proof of the caliber and\r\nhigh intelligence of the pioneers; and out of the otherwise dull\r\nrecord of meetings, conventions, and petitions, a spirit of\r\nindependence and zeal for freedom shone forth, highlighted\r\noccasionally by dramatic episodes. As Mrs. Stanton so aptly expressed\r\nit, \"We have furnished the bricks and mortar for some future architect\r\nto rear a beautiful edifice.\"[346]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the book was very much on Susan's mind, for she\r\nrealized that it would not be in great demand because of its cost,\r\nbulk, and subject matter. Nor could she at this time present it to\r\nlibraries, as she wished, for she had already spent her savings on the\r\nillustrations. \"It ought to be in every school library,\" she wrote\r\nAmelia Bloomer, \"where every boy and girl of the nation could see and\r\nread and learn what women have done to secure equality of rights and\r\nchances for girls and women....\"[347]\r\n\r\nSo much material had been collected while Volume I was in preparation\r\nthat both Susan and Mrs. Stanton felt they should immediately\r\nundertake Volume II. After a summer of lecturing to help finance its\r\npublication, Susan returned to Tenafly to the monotonous work of\r\ncompilation. \"I am just sick to death of it,\" she wrote her young\r\nfriend Rachel Foster. \"I had rather wash or whitewash or do any\r\npossible hard work than sit here and go there digging into the dusty\r\nrecords of the past--that is, rather _make_ history than write\r\nit.\"[348]\r\n\r\nYet she never entirely gave up making history, for she was always\r\nplanning for the future and Rachel Foster was now her able lieutenant,\r\nrelieving her of details, doing the spade work for the annual\r\nWashington conventions, and arranging for an occasional lecture\r\nengagement. Susan would not leave Tenafly for a lecture fee of less\r\nthan $50.\r\n\r\nShe took this intelligent young girl to her heart as she had Anna E.\r\nDickinson in the past. Rachel, however, had none of Anna's dramatic\r\ntemperament or love of the limelight, but in her orderly businesslike\r\nway was eager to serve Susan, whom she had admired ever since as a\r\nchild she had heard her speak for woman suffrage in her mother's\r\ndrawing room.\r\n\r\nWhile Susan was pondering the ways and means of financing another\r\nvolume of the _History_, the light broke through in a letter from\r\nWendell Phillips, announcing the astonishing news that she and Lucy\r\nStone had inherited approximately $25,000 each for \"the woman's cause\"\r\nunder the will of Eliza Eddy, the daughter of their former benefactor,\r\nFrancis Jackson. Although the legacy was not paid until 1885 because\r\nof litigation, its promise lightened considerably Susan's financial\r\nburden and she knew that Volumes II and III were assured. Her\r\ngratitude to Eliza Eddy was unbounded, and better still, she read\r\nbetween the lines the good will of Wendell Phillips who had been Eliza\r\nEddy's legal advisor. That he, whom she admired above all men, should\r\nafter their many differences still regard her as worthy of this trust,\r\nmeant as much to her as the legacy itself.\r\n\r\nIn May 1882 she had the satisfaction of seeing the second volume of\r\nthe _History of Woman Suffrage_ in print, carrying women's record\r\nthrough 1875. Volume III was not completed until 1885.\r\n\r\nWomen's response to their own history was a disappointment. Only a few\r\nrealized its value for the future, among them Mary L. Booth, editor of\r\n_Harper's Bazaar_. The majority were indifferent and some even\r\ncritical. When Mrs. Stanton offered the three volumes to the Vassar\r\nCollege library, they were refused.[349] Nevertheless, every time\r\nSusan looked at the three large volumes on her shelves, she was happy,\r\nfor now she was assured that women's struggle for citizenship and\r\nfreedom would live in print through the years. To libraries in the\r\nUnited States and Europe, she presented well over a thousand copies,\r\ngrateful that the Eliza Eddy legacy now made this possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Susan surprised everyone by taking a vacation in Europe. Soon\r\nafter Volume II of the _History_ had been completed, Mrs. Stanton had\r\nleft for Europe with her daughter Harriot.[350] Her letters to Susan\r\nreported not only Harriot's marriage to an Englishman, William Henry\r\nBlatch, but also encouraging talks with the forward-looking women of\r\nEngland and France whom she hoped to interest in an international\r\norganization. Repeatedly she urged Susan to join her, to meet these\r\nwomen, and to rest for a while from her strenuous labors. The\r\npossibility of forming an international organization of women was a\r\ngreater attraction to Susan than Europe itself, and when Rachel Foster\r\nsuggested that she make the journey with her, she readily consented.\r\n\r\n\"She goes abroad a republican Queen,\" observed the Kansas City\r\n_Journal_, \"uncrowned to be sure, but none the less of the blood\r\nroyal, and we have faith that the noblest men and women of Europe will\r\nat once recognize and welcome her as their equal.\"[351]\r\n\r\nIn London, Susan met Mrs. Stanton, \"her face beaming and her white\r\ncurls as lovely as ever.\" Then after talking with English suffragists\r\nand her two old friends, William Henry Channing and Ernestine Rose,\r\nnow living in England, Susan traveled with Rachel through Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, Germany, and France, where a whole new world opened\r\nbefore her. She thoroughly enjoyed its beauty; yet there was much that\r\ndistressed her and she found herself far more interested in the\r\npeople, their customs and living conditions than in the treasures of\r\nart. \"It is good for our young civilization,\" she wrote Daniel, \"to\r\nsee and study that of the old world and observe the hopelessness of\r\nlifting the masses into freedom and freedom's industry, honesty and\r\nintegrity. How any American, any lover of our free institutions, based\r\non equality of rights for all, can settle down and live here is more\r\nthan I can comprehend. It will only be by overturning the powers that\r\neducation and equal chances ever can come to the rank and file. The\r\nhope of the world is indeed our republic....\" To a friend she\r\nreported, \"Amidst it all my head and heart turn to our battle for\r\nwomen at home. Here in the old world, with ... its utter blotting out\r\nof women as an equal, there is no hope, no possibility of changing her\r\ncondition; so I look to our own land of equality for men, and partial\r\nequality for women, as the only one for hope or work.\"[352]\r\n\r\nBack in London again, she allowed herself a few luxuries, such as an\r\nexpensive India shawl and more social life than she had had in many a\r\nyear, and she longed to have Mary enjoy it all with her. She visited\r\nsuffragists in Scotland and Ireland as well as in England and\r\noccasionally spoke at their meetings.[353] Here as in America\r\nsuffragists differed over the best way to win the vote, and even the\r\nmost radical among them were more conservative and cautious than\r\nAmerican women, but she admired them all and tried to understand the\r\nvery different problems they faced. Gradually she interested a few of\r\nthem in an international conference of women, and before she sailed\r\nback to America with Mrs. Stanton in November 1883, she had their\r\npromise of cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers welcomed her home. \"Susan B. Anthony is back from\r\nEurope,\" announced the Cleveland _Leader_, \"and is here for a winter's\r\nfight on behalf of woman suffrage. She seems remarkably well, and has\r\ngained fifteen pounds since she left last spring. She is sixty-three,\r\nbut looks just the same as twenty years ago. There is perhaps an extra\r\nwrinkle in her face, a little more silver in her hair, but her blue\r\neyes are just as bright, her mouth as serious and her step as active\r\nas when she was forty. She would attract attention in any crowd.\"[354]\r\n\r\nSusan came back to an indifferent Congress. \"All would fall flat and\r\ndead if someone were not here to keep them in mind of their duty to\r\nus,\" she wrote a friend at this time, and to her diary she confided,\r\n\"It is perfectly disheartening that no member feels any especial\r\ninterest or earnest determination in pushing this question of woman\r\nsuffrage, to all men only a side issue.\"[355]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[339] The only such history available was the _History of the National\r\nWoman's Rights Movement for Twenty Years_ (New York, 1871), written by\r\nPaulina Wright Davis to commemorate the first national woman's rights\r\nconvention in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1850. This brief record,\r\nending with Victoria Woodhull's Memorial to Congress, was inadequate\r\nand placed too much emphasis on Victoria Woodhull who had flashed\r\nthrough the movement like a meteor, leaving behind her a trail of\r\ndiscord and little that was constructive.\r\n\r\n[340] Aaron McLean, Eugene Mosher, his daughter Louise, Merritt's\r\ndaughter, Lucy E.

I hope against hope, but still I hope,\"\r\nSusan wrote in her diary in 1885, as she waited for news from Oregon\r\nTerritory regarding the vote of the people on a woman suffrage\r\namendment.[356] Woman suffrage was defeated in Oregon; and in\r\nWashington Territory, where in 1883 it had carried, a contest was\r\nbeing waged in the courts to invalidate it. In Nebraska it had also\r\nbeen defeated in 1882. Since the victories in Wyoming and Utah in 1869\r\nand 1870, not another state or territory had written woman suffrage\r\ninto law.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these setbacks, Susan still saw great promise in the West\r\nand resumed her lecturing there. She knew the rapidly growing young\r\nwestern states and territories as few easterners did, and she\r\nunderstood their people. Here women were making themselves\r\nindispensable as teachers, and state universities, now open to them,\r\ngraduated over two thousand women a year. The Farmers' Alliance, the\r\nGrange, and the Prohibition party, all distinctly western in origin,\r\nadmitted women to membership and were friendly to woman suffrage.\r\nSchool suffrage had been won in twelve western states as against five\r\nin the East, and Kansas women were now voting in municipal elections.\r\nIn a sense, woman suffrage was becoming respectable in the West, and a\r\nwoman was no longer ostracized by her friends for working with Susan\r\nB. Anthony.\r\n\r\nStill critical of her own speaking, Susan was often discouraged over\r\nher lectures, but her vitality, her naturalness, and her flashes of\r\nwit seldom failed to win over her audiences. Her nephew, Daniel Jr., a\r\nstudent at the University of Michigan, hearing her speak, wrote his\r\nparents, \"At the beginning of her lecture, Aunt Susan does not do so\r\nwell; but when she is in the midst of her argument and all her\r\nenergies brought into play, I think she is a very powerful\r\nspeaker.\"[357]\r\n\r\nOn these trips through the West, she kept in close touch with her\r\nbrothers Daniel and Merritt in Kansas, frequently visiting in their\r\nhomes and taking her numerous nieces to Rochester. She valued\r\nDaniel's judgment highly, and he, well-to-do and influential, was a\r\ngreat help to her in many ways, investing her savings and furnishing\r\nher with railroad passes which greatly reduced her ever-increasing\r\ntraveling expenses.\r\n\r\nEverywhere she met active zealous members of the Women's Christian\r\nTemperance Union. Since the Civil War, temperance had become a\r\nvigorous movement in the Middle West, doing its utmost to counteract\r\nthe influence of the many large new breweries and saloons. Through the\r\nProhibition party, organized on a national basis in 1872, temperance\r\nwas now a political issue in Kansas, Iowa, and the Territory of\r\nDakota, and through the W.C.T.U. women waged an effective\r\ntotal-abstinence campaign. Brought into the suffrage movement by\r\nFrances Willard under the slogan, \"For God and Home and Country,\"\r\nthese women quickly sensed the value of their votes to the temperance\r\ncause. Nor was Susan slow to recognize their importance to her and her\r\nwork, for they represented an entirely new group, churchwomen, who\r\nheretofore had been suspicious of and hostile toward woman's rights.\r\nThrough them, she anticipated a powerful impetus for her cause.\r\n\r\nWith admiration she had watched Frances Willard's career.[358] This\r\nvivid consecrated young woman was a born leader, quick to understand\r\nwoman's need of the vote and eager to lead women forward. It was a\r\ndisappointment, however, when she joined the American rather than the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association. The reasons for this, Susan\r\nreadily understood, were Frances Willard's warm friendship with Mary\r\nLivermore and her own preference for the American's state-by-state\r\nmethod, similar to that she had so successfully followed in her\r\nW.C.T.U. Yet Frances Willard, whenever she could, cooperated with\r\nSusan whom she admired and loved; and through the years these two\r\ngreat leaders valued and respected each other, even though they\r\nfrequently differed over policy and method.\r\n\r\nSusan, for example, was often troubled because women suffrage and\r\ntemperance were more and more linked together in the public mind, thus\r\nconfusing the issues and arousing the hostility of those who might\r\nhave been friendly toward woman suffrage had they not feared that\r\nwomen's votes would bring in prohibition. She did her best to make it\r\nclear to her audiences that she did not ask for the ballot in order\r\nthat women might vote against saloons and for prohibition. She\r\ndemanded only that women have the same right as men to express their\r\nopinions at the polls. Such an attitude was hard for many temperance\r\nwomen to understand and to forgive.\r\n\r\nOver women's support of specific political parties, Susan and Frances\r\nWillard were never able to agree. Susan had never been willing to ally\r\nherself with a minority party. Therefore, to Frances Willard's\r\ndisappointment, she withheld her support from the Prohibition party in\r\n1880, although their platform acknowledged woman's need of the ballot\r\nand directed them to use it to settle the liquor question, and in 1884\r\nwhen they recommended state suffrage for women. Finding women eager to\r\nsupport the Prohibitionists in gratitude for these inadequate planks,\r\nSusan even issued a statement urging them to support the Republicans,\r\nwho held out the most hope to them even if woman suffrage had not been\r\nmentioned in their platform. Her experience in Washington had proved\r\nto her the friendliness and loyalty of individual Republicans, and she\r\nwas unwilling to jeopardize their support.\r\n\r\nHer judgment was confirmed during the next few years when friendly\r\nRepublicans spoke for woman suffrage in the Senate, and when in 1887\r\nthe woman suffrage amendment was debated and voted on in the Senate.\r\nIn the Senate gallery eagerly listening, Susan took notice that the\r\nsixteen votes cast for the amendment were those of Republicans.[359]\r\n\r\nStill hoping to win Susan's endorsement of the Prohibition party in\r\n1888, Frances Willard asked her to outline what kind of plank would\r\nsatisfy her.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean so satisfy me,\" Susan replied, \"that I would work, and\r\nrecommend to all women to work ... for the success of the third party\r\nticket?... Not until a third party gets into power ... which promises\r\na larger per cent of representatives, on the floor of Congress, and in\r\nthe several State legislatures, who will speak and vote for women's\r\nenfranchisement, than does the Republican, shall I work for it. You\r\nsee, as yet there is not a single Prohibitionist in Congress while\r\nthere are at least twenty Republicans on the floor of the United\r\nStates Senate, besides fully one-half of the members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives who are in favor of woman suffrage.... I do not\r\npropose to work for the defeat of the party which thus far has\r\nfurnished nearly every vote in that direction.\"[360]\r\n\r\nNor was she lured away when, in 1888, the Prohibition party endorsed\r\nwoman suffrage and granted Frances Willard the honor of addressing its\r\nconvention and serving on the resolutions committee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe temperance issue also cropped up in the annual Washington\r\nconventions of the National Woman Suffrage Association, preparations\r\nfor which Susan now left to Rachel Foster, May Wright Sewall, a\r\ncapable young recruit from Indiana, and Jane Spofford. However, she\r\nstill supervised these conventions, prodding and interfering, in what\r\nshe called her most Andrew Jackson-like manner. She always returned to\r\nWashington with excitement and pleasure, and with the hope of some\r\noutstanding victory, and the suite at the Riggs House, given her by\r\ngenerous Jane Spofford, was a delight after months of hard travel in\r\nthe West. \"I shall come both ragged and dirty,\" she wrote Mrs.\r\nSpofford in 1887. \"Though the apparel will be tattered and torn, the\r\nmind, the essence of me, is sound to the core. Please tell the little\r\nmilliner to have a bonnet picked out for me, and get a dressmaker who\r\nwill patch me together so that I shall be presentable.\"[361]\r\n\r\nOpen to all women irrespective of race or creed, the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association attracted fearless independent devoted members.\r\nThey welcomed Mormon women into the fold, and when the bill to\r\ndisfranchise Mormon women as a punishment for polygamy was before\r\nCongress in 1887, they did their utmost to help Mormon women retain\r\nthe vote, but were defeated.\r\n\r\nThey welcomed as well many temperance advocates. A few delegates,\r\nhowever, among them Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Gage, and Mrs. Colby, scorned\r\nwhat they called the \"singing and praying\" temperance group and\r\nprotested that temperance and religion were getting too strong a hold\r\non the organization. Abigail Duniway from Oregon contended that\r\nsuffragists should not join forces with temperance groups and blamed\r\nthe defeat of woman suffrage in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, in\r\n1887, on men's fear that women would vote for prohibition.\r\n\r\nOften Susan was obliged to act as arbiter between the temperance and\r\nnontemperance groups. She did not underestimate the momentum which the\r\nwell-organized W.C.T.U. had already given the suffrage cause,\r\nparticularly in states where the National Association had only a few\r\nand scattered workers. She needed and wanted the help of these\r\ntemperance women and of Frances Willard's forceful and winning\r\npersonality. She also saw the importance of breaking down with Frances\r\nWillard's aid the slow-yielding opposition of the church.\r\n\r\nOccasionally enthusiastic workers undertook projects which to her\r\nseemed unwise. She told them frankly how she felt and left it at that,\r\nbut most of them had to learn by experience. When Belva Lockwood, one\r\nof her most able colleagues in Washington, accepted the nomination for\r\nPresident of the United States, offered her by the women of California\r\nin 1884 and by the women of Iowa in 1888 through their Equal Rights\r\nparty, she did not lend her support or that of the National\r\nAssociation, but followed her consistent policy of no alignment with a\r\nminority party. Nevertheless, she heartily believed in women's right\r\nand ability to hold the highest office in the land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEver since her trip to Europe in 1883, Susan had been planning for an\r\ninternational gathering of women. Interest in this project was kept\r\nalive among European women by Mrs. Stanton during her frequent visits\r\nwith her daughter Harriot in England and her son Theodore in France.\r\nIt was Susan, however, who put the machinery in motion through the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association and issued a call for an\r\ninternational conference in Washington, in March 1888, to commemorate\r\nthe fortieth anniversary of the first woman's rights convention. Ten\r\nthousand invitations were sent out to organizations of women in all\r\nparts of the world, to professional, business, and reform groups as\r\nwell as to those advocating political and civil rights for women, and\r\nan ambitious program was prepared. Most of the work for the conference\r\nand the raising of $13,000 to finance it fell upon the shoulders of\r\nSusan, Rachel Foster, and May Wright Sewall, but they also had the\r\nenthusiastic cooperation of Frances Willard, who, with her nation-wide\r\ncontacts, was of inestimable value in arousing interest among the many\r\nand varied women's organizations and the labor groups. Another happy\r\ndevelopment was Clara Colby's decision to publish her _Woman's\r\nTribune_ in Washington during the conference. Mrs. Colby's _Tribune_,\r\nestablished in Beatrice, Nebraska, in 1883, had since then met in a\r\nmeasure Susan's need for a paper for the National Association and she\r\nwelcomed its transfer to Washington.[362]\r\n\r\nWomen from all parts of the world assembled in Albaugh's Opera House\r\nin Washington for the epoch-making international conference which\r\nopened on Sunday, March 25, 1888, with religious services conducted\r\nentirely by women, as if to prove to the world that women in the\r\npulpit were appropriate and adequate. Fifty-three national\r\norganizations sent representatives, and delegates came from England,\r\nFrance, Norway, Denmark, Finland, India, and Canada.\r\n\r\nPresiding over all sixteen sessions, Susan rejoiced over a record\r\nattendance. Her thoughts went back to the winter of 1854 when she and\r\nErnestine Rose had held their first woman's rights meetings in\r\nWashington, finding only a handful ready to listen. The intervening\r\nthirty-four years had worked wonders. Now women were willing to travel\r\nnot only across the continent but from Europe and Asia to discuss and\r\ndemand equal educational advantages, equal opportunities for training\r\nin the professions and in business, equal pay for equal work, equal\r\nsuffrage, and the same standard of morals for all. Aware of their\r\nresponsibility to their countries, they asked for the tools, education\r\nand the franchise, to help solve the world's problems. They were\r\nlistened to with interest and respect, and were received at the White\r\nHouse by President and Mrs. Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThrough it all, a dynamic, gray-haired woman in a black silk dress\r\nwith a red shawl about her shoulders was without question the heroine\r\nof the occasion. \"This lady,\" observed the Baltimore _Sun_, \"daily\r\ngrows upon all present; the woman suffragists love her for her good\r\nworks, the audience for her brightness and wit, and the multitude of\r\npress representatives for her frank, plain, open, business-like way of\r\ndoing everything connected with the council.... Her word is the\r\nparliamentary law of the meeting. Whatever she says is done without\r\nmurmur or dissent.\"[363]\r\n\r\nA permanent International Council of Women to meet once every five\r\nyears was organized with Millicent Garrett Fawcett of England as\r\npresident, and a National Council to meet every three years was formed\r\nas an affiliate with Frances Willard as president and Susan as\r\nvice-president at large. Emphasizing education and social and moral\r\nreform, the International Council did not rank suffrage first as\r\nSusan had hoped. Nevertheless, she was happy that an international\r\nmovement of enterprising women was well on its way. They would learn\r\nby experience.\r\n\r\nOf all the favorable results of the International Council of Women,\r\ntwo were of special importance to Susan, meeting Anna Howard Shaw and\r\novertures from Lucy Stone for a union of the National and American\r\nWoman Suffrage Associations.\r\n\r\nPrejudiced against Anna Howard Shaw, who had aligned herself with Mary\r\nLivermore and Lucy Stone, and who she assumed, was a narrow Methodist\r\nminister, Susan was unprepared to find that the pleasing young woman\r\nin the pulpit on the first day of the conference, holding her audience\r\nspellbound with her oratory, was Anna Howard Shaw. Here was a warm\r\npersonality, a crusader eager to right human wrongs, and above all a\r\nmatchless public speaker. Anna too had heard much criticism of Susan\r\nand had formed a distorted opinion of her which was quickly dispelled\r\nas she watched her preside. They liked each other the moment they met.\r\n\r\nAnna Howard Shaw had grown up on the Michigan frontier, her\r\nindomitable spirit and her eagerness for learning conquering the\r\nhardships and the limitations of her surroundings. Encouraged by Mary\r\nLivermore, who by chance lectured in her little town, she worked her\r\nway through Albion College and Boston University Theological School,\r\nfrom which she graduated in 1878. She then served as the pastor of two\r\nCape Cod churches, but was refused ordination by the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church because of her sex. Eventually she was ordained by\r\nthe Methodist Protestant church. During her pastorate, she studied\r\nmedicine at Boston University, and because of her ability as a speaker\r\nwas in demand as a lecturer for temperance and woman suffrage groups.\r\nThrough the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, she met an\r\ninspiring group of reformers, and their influence and that of Frances\r\nWillard, in whose work she was intensely interested, led her to leave\r\nthe ministry for active work in the temperance and woman suffrage\r\nmovements. After several years as a lecturer and organizer for the\r\nMassachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, she was placed at the head\r\nof the franchise department of the W.C.T.U. This was her work when she\r\nmet Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anna Howard Shaw]\r\n\r\nThe more Susan talked with Anna, the better she liked her, and the\r\nfeeling was mutual. This wholesome woman of forty-one, with abundant\r\nvitality, unmarried and without pressing family ties to divert her,\r\nseemed particularly well fitted to assist Susan in the arduous\r\ncampaigns which lay ahead. A natural orator, she could in a measure\r\ntake the place of Mrs. Stanton, who could no longer undertake western\r\ntours. Before the International Council adjourned, Susan had Anna's\r\npromise that she would lecture for the National Association.\r\n\r\nOne of Susan's nieces, Lucy E. Anthony, also felt drawn to Anna after\r\nmeeting her at the International Council. A warm friendship quickly\r\ndeveloped and continued throughout their lives. Within a few years\r\nthey were living together, Lucy serving as Anna's secretary and\r\nplanning her lecture tours and campaign trips. Educated in Rochester\r\nthrough the help of her aunts, Susan and Mary, living in their home\r\nand loving them both, Lucy readily made their interests her own and\r\ndevoted her life to the suffrage movement. Neither a public speaker\r\nnor a campaigner, she put her executive ability to work, and her\r\ntasks, though less spectacular, were important and freed both Susan\r\nand Anna from many details.\r\n\r\nJust as the International Council of Women had broken down Anna Howard\r\nShaw's prejudice regarding Susan B. Anthony and her National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association, just so it clarified the opinions of other young\r\nwomen, now aligning themselves with the cause. Admiring the leaders of\r\nboth factions, these young women saw no reason why the two groups\r\nshould not work together in one large strong organization, and this\r\nseemed increasingly important as they welcomed women from other\r\ncountries to this first international conference. Unfamiliar with the\r\npersonal antagonisms and the sincere differences in policy which had\r\ncaused the separation after the Civil War, they did not understand the\r\ndifficulties still in the way of union. So strongly, however, did they\r\npress for a united front that the leaders of both groups felt\r\nthemselves swept along toward that goal. Susan herself had long looked\r\nforward to the time when all suffragists would again work together,\r\nbut since the unsuccessful overtures of her group in 1870, she had\r\nmade no further efforts in that direction. She was completely taken by\r\nsurprise when in the fall of 1887 the American Association proposed\r\nthat she and Lucy Stone confer regarding union.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe negotiations revived old arguments in the minds of zealous\r\npartisans, and in the _Woman's Journal_, the _Woman's Tribune_, and\r\nelsewhere, attempts were made to fasten the blame for the\r\ntwenty-year-old rift upon this one and that one; but so strong ran the\r\ntide for union among the younger women that this excursion into the\r\npast aroused little interest.\r\n\r\nThe election of the president of the merged organizations was the most\r\ndifficult hurdle. Lucy Stone suggested that neither she, Mrs. Stanton,\r\nnor Susan allow their names to be proposed, since they had been blamed\r\nfor the division, but this was easier said than done. The clamor for\r\nSusan and Mrs. Stanton was so strong and continuous among the younger\r\nmembers that it soon became apparent that unless one or the other were\r\nchosen, there would be no hope of union. The odds were in Susan's\r\nfavor. Her popularity in the National Association was tremendous.\r\nAlthough Mrs. Stanton was revered as the mother of woman suffrage and\r\nadmired for her brilliant mind and her poise as presiding officer, she\r\nnow spent so much time in Europe with her daughter Harriot that many\r\nwho might otherwise have voted for her felt that the office should go\r\nto Susan, who was always on the job.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harriot Stanton Blatch]\r\n\r\nMost of the American Association regarded Susan as safer and less\r\nradical than Mrs. Stanton, less likely to stray from the straight path\r\nof woman suffrage, and Henry Blackwell recommended her election.\r\n\r\nSusan did not want the presidency. She wanted it for Mrs. Stanton, who\r\nhad headed the National Association so ably for so many years. She\r\npleaded earnestly with the delegates of the National Association: \"I\r\nwill say to every woman who is a National and who has any love for the\r\nold Association, or for Susan B. Anthony, that I hope you will not\r\nvote for her for president.... Don't you vote for any human being but\r\nMrs. Stanton.... When the division was made 22 years ago it was\r\nbecause our platform was too broad, because Mrs. Stanton was too\r\nradical.... And now ... if Mrs. Stanton shall be deposed ... you\r\nvirtually degrade her.... I want our platform to be kept broad enough\r\nfor the infidel, the atheist, the Mohammedan, or the Christian....\r\nThese are the broad principles I want you to stand upon.\"[364]\r\n\r\nWhen the two organizations met in February 1890 to effect formal union\r\nas the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton was elected president by a majority of 41 votes, while Susan\r\nwas the almost unanimous choice for vice-president at large. With Lucy\r\nStone chosen chairman of the executive committee, Jane Spofford\r\ntreasurer, and Rachel Foster and Alice Stone Blackwell\r\nsecretaries,[365] the new organization was well equipped with able\r\nleaders for the work ahead. It was dedicated to work for both state\r\nand federal woman suffrage amendments and its official organ would be\r\nthe _Woman's Journal_.\r\n\r\nSusan now faced the future with gratitude that a strong unified\r\norganization could be handed down to the younger women who would\r\ngradually take over the work she had started, and her confidence in\r\nthese young women grew day by day. Working closely with Rachel Foster\r\nand May Wright Sewall, she knew their caliber. Anna Howard Shaw and\r\nAlice Stone Blackwell showed great promise, and Harriot Stanton Blatch\r\nwas living up to her expectations. In England where Harriot had made\r\nher home since her marriage in 1882, she was active in the cause, and\r\non her visits to her mother in New York, she kept in touch with the\r\nsuffrage movement in the United States. She took part in the union\r\nmeeting, and in her diary, Susan recorded these words of commendation,\r\n\"Harriot said but a few words, yet showed herself worthy of her mother\r\nand her mother's lifelong friend and co-worker. It was a proud moment\r\nfor me.\"[366]\r\n\r\nTo such she could entrust her beloved cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[356] Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 592.\r\n\r\n[357] _Ibid._, p. 658.\r\n\r\n[358] Miss Anthony first met Frances Willard in 1875 when she lectured\r\nin Rochester. Invited to sit on the platform, by her side, she\r\nthoughtfully refused, adding \"You have a heavy enough load to carry\r\nwithout me.\" Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 472. When Frances Willard took\r\nher stand for woman suffrage in the W.C.T.U. in 1876, Miss Anthony\r\nwrote her, \"Now you are to go forward. I wish I could see you and make\r\nyou feel my gladness.\" Mary Earhart, _Frances Willard_ (Chicago,\r\n1944), p. 153.\r\n\r\n[359] During the debate, Frances Willard rendered valuable aid with a\r\npetition for woman suffrage, signed by 200,000 women. This\r\ncounteracted in a measure the protests against woman suffrage by\r\nPresident Eliot of Harvard and 200 New England clergymen.\r\n\r\n[360] Harper, _Anthony_, II, pp. 622-623.\r\n\r\n[361] _Ibid._, p. 612.\r\n\r\n[362] So successful was Mrs. Colby's Washington venture that she\r\ncontinued to publish her _Woman's Tribune_ there for the next 16 years\r\n\r\n[363] Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 637.\r\n\r\n[364] _Woman's Tribune_, Feb. 22, 1890.\r\n\r\n[365] The credit for achieving union after two years of patient\r\nnegotiation goes to Rachel Foster Avery, secretary of the National\r\nAssociation, and to Lucy Stone's daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell,\r\nsecretary of the American Association.\r\n\r\n[366] Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 675.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIES IN THE WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nNew western states were coming into the Union, North and South Dakota,\r\nMontana, Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming, and in Susan's opinion it was\r\nhighly important that they be admitted as woman suffrage states, for\r\nshe had not forgotten that disturbing line of the Supreme Court\r\ndecision in the Virginia Minor case which read, \"No new State has ever\r\nbeen admitted to the Union which has conferred the right of suffrage\r\non women, and this has never been considered a valid objection to her\r\nadmission.\"[367] Susan wanted to start a new trend.\r\n\r\nOpposition to Wyoming's woman suffrage provision was strong in\r\nCongress in spite of the fact that it had the unanimous approval of\r\nWyoming's constitutional convention. To Susan in the gallery of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, listening anxiously to the debate on the\r\nadmission of Wyoming, defeat was unthinkable after women had voted in\r\nthe Territory of Wyoming for twenty years; but Democrats, wishing to\r\nblock the admission of a preponderantly Republican state, used woman\r\nsuffrage as an excuse. With a sinking heart, she heard an amendment\r\noffered, limiting suffrage in Wyoming to males. At the crucial moment,\r\nhowever, the tide was turned by a telegram from the Wyoming\r\nlegislature, the words of which rejoiced Susan, \"We will remain out of\r\nthe Union a hundred years rather than come in without woman\r\nsuffrage.\"[368] After this, the House voted to admit Wyoming, 139 to\r\n127, but the Senate delayed, renewing the attack on the woman suffrage\r\nprovision. Not until July 1890, while she was speaking to a large\r\naudience in the opera house at Madison, South Dakota, did the good\r\nnews of the admission of Wyoming reach her. Jubilant as she commented\r\non this great victory, she spoke as one inspired, for she saw this as\r\nthe turning point in her forty long years of uphill work.\r\n\r\nNeither North Dakota nor South Dakota had wanted to risk their\r\nchances of statehood by incorporating woman suffrage in their\r\nconstitutions.[369] Yet public opinion in both states was friendly,\r\nSouth Dakota directing its first legislature to submit the question to\r\nthe voters. It was this that brought Susan to South Dakota in 1890.\r\nSentiment for woman suffrage in South Dakota had previously been\r\ncreated almost entirely by the W.C.T.U., and this had linked woman\r\nsuffrage and prohibition together. Now, the liquor interests made\r\nprohibition an issue in this woman suffrage campaign, as they rallied\r\ntheir forces for the repeal of prohibition which had been adopted when\r\nSouth Dakota was admitted to statehood. Through the propaganda of the\r\nliquor interests the 30,000 foreign-born voters became formidable\r\nopponents, and newly naturalized Russians, Scandinavians, and Poles,\r\ngiven the vote before American women, wore badges carrying the slogan,\r\n\"Against Woman Suffrage and Susan B. Anthony.\"[370] Both Republicans\r\nand Democrats cultivated these foreign-born voters, turning a cold\r\nshoulder to the woman suffrage amendment and refusing to endorse it in\r\ntheir state conventions. Even the Farmers' Alliance and the Knights of\r\nLabor, previously friendly to woman suffrage, now joined with the\r\nProhibitionists to form a third political party which also failed to\r\nendorse the woman suffrage amendment. On top of all this,\r\nanti-suffragists from Massachusetts, calling themselves Remonstrants,\r\nflooded South Dakota with their leaflets.\r\n\r\nIt now seemed to Susan as if every clever politician had lined up\r\nagainst women. During these trying days, Anna Howard Shaw joined her,\r\nand together they covered the state, hoping by the truth and sincerity\r\nof their statements to quash the propaganda against woman suffrage.\r\nOften they traveled in freight cars, as transportation was limited, or\r\ndrove long distances in wagons over the sun-baked prairie. The heat\r\nwas intense and the hot winds, blowing incessantly, seared everything\r\nthey touched. After two years of drouth, the farmers were desperately\r\npoor, and Susan, concerned over their plight, wondered why Congress\r\ncould not have appropriated the money for artesian wells to help these\r\nhonest earnest people, instead of voting $40,000 for an investigating\r\ncommission.[371]\r\n\r\nOccasionally Susan and Anna spent the night in isolated sod houses\r\nwhere ingenious pioneer women cooked their scant meals over burning\r\nchips of buffalo bones gathered on the prairie. Glorying in the\r\nvaliant spirit of these women, who in loneliness and hardship played\r\nan important but unheralded role in the conquest of this new country,\r\nSusan was generous with her praise. To them her words of commendation\r\nwere like a benediction, and few of them ever forgot a visit from\r\nSusan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nBy this time life on the frontier was an old story to her, for she had\r\ncampaigned under similar conditions in Kansas and in the far West.\r\nNonetheless, the hardships were trying. Yet this plucky woman of\r\nseventy wrote friends in the East, \"Tell everybody that I am perfectly\r\nwell in body and in mind, never better, and never doing more work....\r\nO, the lack of modern comforts and conveniences! But I can put up with\r\nit better than any of the young folks.... I shall push ahead and do my\r\nlevel best to carry this State, come weal or woe to me personally....\r\nI never felt so buoyed up with the love and sympathy and confidence of\r\nthe good people everywhere....\"[372]\r\n\r\nYoung vigorous Anna Howard Shaw proved to be a campaigner after\r\nSusan's own heart, tireless, uncomplaining, and good-tempered, an\r\nexceptional speaker, witty and quick to say the right word at the\r\nright time. It was a joy to find in Anna the same devotion to the\r\ncause that she herself felt, the same crusading fervor and\r\nreliability. During the long drives over the prairie, she talked to\r\nAnna of the work that must be done, of what it would mean to the women\r\nof the future, and she fired Anna's soul \"with the flame that burned\r\nin her own.\"[373]\r\n\r\nAnother young western woman, Carrie Chapman Catt, also attracted\r\nSusan's attention at this time. She had volunteered for the South\r\nDakota campaign, after attending her first national woman suffrage\r\nconvention; and Susan, meeting her in Huron, South Dakota, to map out\r\na speaking tour for her, found a tall handsome confident young woman\r\nready to attack the work and see it through, in spite of the hardships\r\nwhich confronted her.\r\n\r\nCarrie Lane, a graduate of Iowa State College, had briefly studied law\r\nand taught school before her marriage to Lee Chapman. Now, four years\r\nafter his death, she had married George W. Catt of Seattle, a\r\npromising young engineer and a former fellow-student at Iowa State\r\nCollege. What particularly impressed Susan was that Carrie, in spite\r\nof her marriage in June, had kept her pledge to come to South Dakota.\r\nShe was pleased with the way Carrie not only heroically filled every\r\ndifficult engagement, but sized up the campaign for herself and\r\nplanned for the future. In Carrie's report of her work there was a\r\nruthless practicality which was rare and which instantly won Susan's\r\napproval. Here was a young woman to watch and to keep in the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Anthony home, Rochester, New York]\r\n\r\nThe visible result of six months of campaigning was defeat, with the\r\nvote 22,972 for woman suffrage and 45,632 opposed, and as Susan\r\nremembered the maneuvers of the politicians, the trading of votes for\r\nthe location of the state capital, and the scheming of the liquor\r\ninterests, she felt she was championing a lonely cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom now on Susan hoped to turn over to the younger women much of the\r\nlecturing and organizing in the West, and she needed an anchorage, a\r\nhome of her own from which she could direct the work. Her mother had\r\nwilled 17 Madison Street to Mary, who had rented the first floor and\r\nwas living on the second where there was a room for Susan. Now that\r\nSusan planned to spend more time at home and Mary had retired from\r\nteaching, they decided to take over the whole house, modernize and\r\nredecorate it, and enjoy it the rest of their lives. Mary as usual\r\ntook charge, but Susan had definite ideas about what should be done.\r\nMary, who had learned to be cautious and frugal, was more willing\r\nthan Susan to make old furnishings do, but their friends came to the\r\nrescue, showering them with gifts.\r\n\r\nFreshly painted and papered, with new rugs on the floor, lace curtains\r\nat the windows, easy chairs and new furniture here and there, the\r\nhouse was all Susan had wished for, and everywhere were familiar\r\ntouches, such as her mother's spinning wheel by the fireplace in the\r\nback parlor.\r\n\r\nShe spent most of her time in her study on the second floor. Here she\r\nhung her pictures of the reformers she admired and loved; and right\r\nover her desk, looking down at her, was the comforting picture of her\r\ndearest friend, Mrs. Stanton. Hour after hour, she sat at this desk,\r\nwriting letters, hurriedly dashing off one after another, writing just\r\nas the thoughts came, as if she were talking, bothering little with\r\npunctuation, using dashes instead, and vigorously underlining words\r\nand phrases for emphasis. Instructions to workers in all parts of the\r\ncountry, letters of friendship and sympathy, answers to the many\r\nquestions which came in every mail, these were signed and sealed one\r\nafter another, and slipped into the mail box when she took a brisk\r\nwalk before going to bed.\r\n\r\nShe started each day with the morning newspaper, stepping out on the\r\nfront veranda to pick it up, taking a deep breath of fresh air, and\r\nenjoying the green grass and the tall graceful chestnut trees in front\r\nof the house. Then sitting down in the back parlor beside the big\r\ntable covered with magazines and mail, she carefully read her paper\r\nbefore beginning the work at her desk, for she must keep up-to-date on\r\nthe news.\r\n\r\nRochester was important to her. It was her city, and she was on hand\r\nwith her colleagues whenever there was an opportunity for women to\r\nexpress interest in its government, progress, or welfare. Not only did\r\nshe encourage women to make use of their newly won right to vote in\r\nschool elections, she also urged municipal suffrage for women.\r\nAppealing to the governor to appoint a woman to fill a vacancy on the\r\nboard of trustees of Rochester's State Industrial School, she herself\r\nreceived the appointment which the _Democrat and Chronicle_ called \"a\r\nfitting recognition of one of the ablest and best women in the\r\ncommonwealth.\"[374]\r\n\r\nOne of her first acts as trustee was a practical one for the girls.\r\n\"Spent entire day at State Industrial School,\" she wrote in her diary,\r\n\"getting the laundry girls--who had always washed for the entire\r\ninstitution by hand and ironed that old way--transferred to the boys'\r\nlaundry room to use its machinery--am sure it will work well--girls 12\r\nof them delighted.\"[375] She also taught the boys to patch and darn,\r\nand later asked for coeducation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony at her desk]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan looked forward to welcoming Mrs. Stanton at 17 Madison Street\r\nwhen she returned to this country in 1891, particularly because she\r\nhad sold her home in Tenafly after her husband's death, in 1887, and\r\nnow had no home to go to. Susan hoped that as they again worked\r\ntogether she could persuade Mrs. Stanton to concentrate on more\r\nserious writing than the chatty reminiscences she had just published\r\nand which Susan felt were \"not the greatest\" of herself.[376] When she\r\nheard that Mrs. Stanton seriously contemplated living in New York with\r\ntwo of her children, she begged her to reconsider, writing, \"This is\r\nthe first time since 1850 that I have anchored myself to any\r\nparticular spot, and in doing it my constant thought was that you\r\nwould come here ... and stay for as long, at least, as we must be\r\ntogether to put your writings into systematic shape to go down to\r\nposterity. I have no writings to go down, so my ambition is not for\r\nmyself, but is for the one by the side of whom I have wrought these\r\nforty years, and to get whose speeches before audiences ... has been\r\nthe delight of my life.\"[377]\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton decided to make her home in New York, but first she\r\nvisited Susan who found her as stimulating as ever and brimful of\r\nideas. They plotted and planned as of old and managed to stir up\r\npublic opinion on the question of admitting women to the University of\r\nRochester. With women enrolled at the University of Michigan since\r\n1870, and at Cornell since 1872, and with Columbia University yielding\r\nat last to women's entreaties by establishing Barnard College in 1889,\r\nthey felt it their duty to awaken Rochester, and although their\r\nagitation produced no immediate results, it did start other women\r\nthinking and made news for the press. The cartoons on the subject\r\ndelighted them both.[378]\r\n\r\nSusan soon realized that the writing she had planned for Mrs. Stanton\r\nwould never be done, for Mrs. Stanton had already made up her mind to\r\nwrite for magazines and newspapers on new and controversial subjects,\r\nfeeling this was the best contribution she could make to the cause.\r\nSusan also found it increasingly difficult to hold her old friend to\r\nthe straight path of woman suffrage, Mrs. Stanton insisting that too\r\nmuch concentration on this one subject was narrowing and left women\r\nunprepared for the intelligent use of the ballot. Women, Mrs. Stanton\r\nargued, needed to be stirred up to think, and this they would not do\r\nas long as their minds were dominated by the church, which, she\r\nbelieved, had for generations hampered their development by\r\nemphasizing their inferiority and subordination. She was determined to\r\nanalyze and rebel, and Susan could in no way divert her. Completely\r\nabsorbed in trying to prove that the Bible, accurately translated and\r\ninterpreted, did not teach the inferiority or the subordination of\r\nwomen, she was writing a book which she called _The Woman's Bible_,\r\nchapters of which were already appearing in the _Woman's Tribune_.\r\n\r\nSusan was not unsympathetic to Mrs. Stanton's ideas, but she opposed\r\nthis excursion into religious controversy because she was sure it\r\nwould stir up futile wrangles among the suffragists and keep Mrs.\r\nStanton from giving her best to the cause. Her lack of interest then\r\nand her frank disapproval as _The Woman's Bible_ progressed were a\r\ngreat disappointment to Mrs. Stanton, and these two old friends began\r\nto grow somewhat apart as they took different roads to reach their\r\ngoal, the one intent on freeing women's minds, the other determined to\r\nestablish their citizenship. Yet their friendship endured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton]\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Susan reluctantly consented to Mrs. Stanton's retirement as\r\npresident of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Mrs.\r\nStanton's request that she be followed by Susan won unanimous\r\napproval, and Anna Howard Shaw was moved up to second place,\r\nvice-president at large. For forty years, Susan had watched Mrs.\r\nStanton preside with a poise, warmth, and skill which few could equal.\r\nShe knew she would miss her dynamic reassuring presence at the\r\nconventions. Yet she was obliged to admit to herself that it was more\r\nthan fitting that she should at last head the ever-growing\r\norganization which she had built up. This was the last convention\r\nwhich Mrs. Stanton attended, and it was the last for Lucy Stone who\r\ndied the next year. Susan appreciated the eager young women who now\r\ntook their places, but she did not yet feel completely at home with\r\nthem. \"Only think,\" she wrote an old-time colleague, \"I shall not have\r\na white-haired woman on the platform with me, and I shall be alone\r\nthere of all the pioneer workers. Always with the 'old guard' I had\r\nperfect confidence that the wise and right thing would be said. What a\r\nplatform ours then was of self-reliant strong women! I felt sure of\r\nyou all.... I can not feel quite certain that our younger sisters will\r\nbe equal to the emergency, yet they are each and all valiant, earnest,\r\nand talented, and will soon be left to manage the ship without even\r\nme.\"[379]\r\n\r\nIn 1892, the year of the presidential election, Susan hopefully\r\nattended the national political conventions. Again the Republicans\r\nmade their proverbial excuses, explaining that they not only faced a\r\nformidable opponent in Grover Cleveland but also the threat of a new\r\nPeople's party. The familiar ring of their alibis, which they had\r\nrepeated since Reconstruction days, made Susan wonder when and if ever\r\nthe Republicans would feel able to bear the strain of woman suffrage.\r\nTheir platform remembered the poor, the foreign-born, and male\r\nNegroes, but it still ignored women. Yet hope for the future stirred\r\nin her heart as she saw at the convention two women serving as\r\ndelegates from Wyoming. Here was the entering wedge.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats as usual were silent on woman suffrage, but undismayed\r\nby them or by the Prohibitionists, who this year failed to endorse\r\nvotes for women, Susan moved on to Omaha with Anna Howard Shaw for the\r\nfirst national convention of the new People's party. Here she met\r\nrepresentatives of the Farmers' Alliance and the Knights of Labor,\r\nboth friendly to woman suffrage, and men from other groups, critical\r\nof the two major political parties for their failure to solve the\r\npressing economic problems confronting the nation. Susan was\r\nsympathetic with many of the aims of the People's party, having seen\r\nwith her own eyes the plight of debt-burdened, hard-working farmers\r\nand having crusaded in her own paper, _The Revolution_, for the rights\r\nof labor and for the control of industrial monopoly. However, she\r\nstill viewed minor, reform parties with a highly critical eye. The\r\nPeople's party gave her no woman suffrage plank and she found them\r\n\"quite as oblivious to the underlying principle of justice to women as\r\neither of the old parties....\"[380]\r\n\r\nWith the election of Grover Cleveland, whose opposition to woman\r\nsuffrage was well known, and with the Democrats in the saddle for\r\nanother four years, Congressional action on the woman suffrage\r\namendment was blocked. Nevertheless, the cause moved ahead in the\r\nstates; Colorado was to vote on the question in 1893 and Kansas in\r\n1894, and New York was revising its constitution. In addition, the\r\nWorld's Fair in Chicago in 1893 offered endless opportunities to bring\r\nthe subject before the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as plans for the World's Fair were under way, Susan began to\r\nwork indirectly through prominent women in Washington and Chicago for\r\nthe appointment of women to the board of management. \"Lady Managers\"\r\nwere appointed, 115 strong, who proved to be very much alive under the\r\nleadership of Mrs. Bertha Honoré Palmer. Susan found Mrs. Palmer\r\nalmost as determined as she to secure equality of rights for women at\r\nthe World's Fair, and nothing that she herself might have planned\r\ncould have been more effective than the series of world congresses in\r\nwhich both men and women took part, or than the World's Congress of\r\nRepresentative Women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elizabeth Smith Miller, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and\r\nSusan B. Anthony]\r\n\r\nTwo of Susan's \"girls,\" as she liked to call them, Rachel Foster\r\nAvery[381] and May Wright Sewall, were appointed by Mrs. Palmer to\r\ntake charge of the World's Congress of Representative Women, and they\r\narranged a meeting of the International Council of Women as a part of\r\nthis Congress.\r\n\r\nConvening soon after the opening of the World's Fair, the Congress of\r\nRepresentative Women drew record crowds at its eighty-one sessions.\r\nTwenty-seven countries and 126 organizations were represented. Here\r\nSusan, to her joy, heard Negroes, American Indians, and Mormons tell\r\nof their progress and their problems, and saw them treated with as\r\nmuch respect as American millionaires, English nobility, or the most\r\nvirtuous, conservative housewife. Watching these women assemble,\r\ntalking with them, and listening to their well-delivered speeches, she\r\nfelt richly rewarded for the lonely work she had undertaken forty\r\nyears before, when scarcely a woman could be coaxed to a meeting or be\r\npersuaded to express her opinions in public. Although only one session\r\nof the congress was devoted to the civil and political rights of\r\nwomen, it was gratifying to her that women's need of the ballot was\r\nspontaneously brought up in meeting after meeting, showing that\r\nwomen, whatever their cause or whatever their organization, were\r\nrecognizing that only by means of the vote could their reforms be\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the subject to which she had dedicated her life, Susan\r\ngave credit to the pioneering suffragists for the change which had\r\ntaken place in public opinion regarding the position of women. She\r\nurged women's organizations to give suffrage their wholehearted\r\nsupport and pointed out the great power of some of the newer\r\norganizations, such as the W.C.T.U. with its membership of half a\r\nmillion and the young General Federation of Women's Clubs of 40,000\r\nmembers. Confessing that her own National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation in comparison was poor in numbers and limited in funds,\r\nshe added, \"I would philosophize on the reason why. It is because\r\nwomen have been taught always to work for something else than their\r\nown personal freedom; and the hardest thing in the world is to\r\norganize women for the one purpose of securing their political liberty\r\nand political equality.\"[382] Even so, the vital woman's rights\r\norganizations, she concluded, drew the whole world to them in spirit\r\nif not in person.\r\n\r\nHer very presence among them without her words, in fact her very\r\npresence on the fair grounds, advertised her cause, for in the mind of\r\nthe public she personified woman suffrage. This tall dignified woman\r\nwith smooth gray hair, abundant in energy and spontaneous\r\nfriendliness, was the center of attraction at the World's Congress of\r\nRepresentative Women. In her new black dress of Chinese silk,\r\nbrightened with blue, and her small black bonnet, trimmed with lace\r\nand blue forget-me-nots, she was the perfect picture of everyone's\r\ngrandmother, and the people took her to their hearts.[383] She was the\r\none woman all wanted to see. Curious crowds jammed the hall and\r\ncorridors when she was scheduled to speak, and often a policeman had\r\nto clear the way for her. At whatever meeting she appeared, the\r\naudience at once burst into applause and started calling for her,\r\ninterrupting the speakers, and were not satisfied until she had\r\nmounted the platform so that all could see her and she had said a few\r\nwords. Then they cheered her. After years of ridicule and\r\nunpopularity, she hardly knew what to make of all this, but she\r\naccepted it with happiness as a tribute to her beloved cause. Many\r\nwho had been critical and wary of her newfangled notions began to\r\nreverse their opinions after they saw her and heard her words of good\r\ncommon sense. Even those who still opposed woman suffrage left the\r\nWorld's Fair with a new respect for Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nShe stayed on in Chicago for much of the summer and fall, for she was\r\nin demand as a speaker at several of the world congresses and had five\r\nspeeches to read for Mrs. Stanton, who felt unable to brave the heat\r\nand the crowds. She felt at home in this bustling, rapidly growing\r\ncity which for so many years had been the halfway station on her\r\nlecture and campaign trips through the West. Here she had always found\r\na warm welcome, first from her cousins, the Dickinsons, then from the\r\never-widening circle of friends she won for her cause. Now she was\r\nliterally swamped with hospitality.[384] She rejoiced that such great\r\nnumbers of everyday people were able to enjoy the beauty of the fair\r\ngrounds and the many interesting exhibits, and when a group of\r\nclergymen urged Sunday closing, she took issue with them, declaring\r\nthat Sunday was the only day on which many were free to attend. Asked\r\nby a disapproving clergyman if she would like to have a son of hers\r\nattend Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show on Sunday, she promptly and\r\nbluntly replied, \"Of course I would, and I think he would learn far\r\nmore there than from the sermons in some churches!\"[385]\r\n\r\nHearing of this, Buffalo Bill offered her a box at his popular Wild\r\nWest Show, and she appeared the next day with twelve of her \"girls.\"\r\nDashing into the arena on his spirited horse while the band played and\r\nthe spotlight flashed on him, Buffalo Bill rode directly up to Susan's\r\nbox, reined his horse, and swept off his big western hat to salute\r\nher. Quick to respond, she rose and bowed, and beaming with pleasure,\r\nwaved her handkerchief at him while the immense audience applauded and\r\ncheered.\r\n\r\nShe returned home early in November 1893, with happy memories of the\r\nWorld's Fair and to good news from Colorado. \"Telegram ... from\r\nDenver--said woman suffrage carried by 5000 majority,\" she recorded in\r\nher diary.[386] This laconic comment in no way expressed the joy in\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\nHer diaries, written hurriedly in small fine script, year after year,\r\nin black-covered notebooks about three inches by six, were a brief\r\nterse record of her work and her travels. Only occasionally a line of\r\nphilosophizing shone out from the mass of routine detail, or an\r\nilluminating comment on a friend or a difficult situation, but she\r\nnever failed to record a family anniversary, a birthday, or a death.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado victory, referred to so casually in her diary, was\r\nactually of great importance to her and her cause, for it carried\r\nforward the trend initiated by the admission of Wyoming as a woman\r\nsuffrage state in 1890. Colorado also proved to her that her \"girls\"\r\ncould take over her work. So busy had she been winning good will for\r\nthe cause at the World's Fair that she had left Colorado in the\r\ncapable hands of the women of the state and of young efficient Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, to whom she now turned over the supervision of all state\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\nEncouragement also came from another part of the world, from New\r\nZealand, where the vote was extended to women. This confirmed her\r\ngrowing conviction that equal citizenship was best understood on the\r\nfrontier and that in her own country victory would come from the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[367] Minor vs. Happersett, _History of Woman Suffrage_, II, pp.\r\n741-742.

She was now seventy-four years old. Political machines and\r\nfinancial interests were deeply intrenched in New York, and although\r\ntwo governors had recommended that women be represented in the\r\nconstitutional convention and a bill had been passed making women\r\neligible as delegates, neither Republicans nor Democrats had the\r\nslightest intention of allowing women to slip into men's stronghold.\r\nIt was obvious to Susan that without representation at the convention\r\nand without power to enforce their demands, women's only hope was an\r\nintensive educational campaign which she now directed with vigor.\r\nWhenever she could, she conferred with Mrs. Stanton, whose judgment\r\nshe valued, and there was zest in working together as they had during\r\nthe previous constitutional convention in 1867.\r\n\r\nThe women of New York were aroused as never before. Young able\r\nspeakers went through the state, piling up signatures on their\r\npetitions, but they had few influential friends among the delegates.\r\nAnti-suffragists were active, encouraged by Bishop Doane of the\r\nProtestant Episcopal church and Mrs. Lyman Abbott, whose name carried\r\nthe prestige and influence of her husband's popular magazine, _The\r\nOutlook_.\r\n\r\nWith the election of Joseph Choate of New York as president of the\r\nconvention, Susan knew that woman suffrage was doomed, for Choate had\r\npolitical aspirations and was not likely to let his sympathies for an\r\nunpopular cause jeopardize his chances of becoming governor. While he\r\ngave women every opportunity to be heard, at the same time he arranged\r\nfor the defeat of woman suffrage by appointing men to consider the\r\nsubject who were definitely opposed, and they submitted an adverse\r\nreport. Here was a situation similar to that in 1867, when her\r\none-time friend, Horace Greeley, had deserted women for political\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\n\"I am used to defeat every time and know how to pick up and push on\r\nfor another attack,\" she wrote as she now turned her attention to\r\nKansas.[388]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Republicans in Kansas had sponsored school and municipal suffrage\r\nfor women and had passed a woman suffrage amendment to be referred to\r\nthe people in 1894. Yet they proved to be as great a disappointment to\r\nSusan as they were in 1867, when as a last resort she had been obliged\r\nto campaign with the Democrats and George Francis Train.\r\n\r\nThe population of Kansas had changed with the years, as immigrants\r\nfrom Europe had come into the state, and Susan was again confronted\r\nwith the powerful opposition of foreign-born voters for whose support\r\nthe political parties bargained. The liquor interests were also\r\nactive, and the Republicans, who had brought prohibition to Kansas,\r\nnow left the question discreetly alone, even making a deal with German\r\nDemocrats for their votes by promising to ignore in their platform\r\nboth prohibition and woman suffrage. Prohibition and woman suffrage\r\nwere synonymous in the minds of voters, because women had generally\r\nvoted for enforcement in municipal elections, and no matter how hard\r\nSusan tried, she found it impossible to have woman suffrage considered\r\non its own merits.\r\n\r\nWatching the straws in the wind, she saw Republican supremacy\r\nseriously threatened by the new Populist party. Convinced that she\r\ncould no longer count on help from Kansas Republicans, she turned to\r\nthe Populist party, ignoring the pleas of Republican women who warned\r\nher she would hurt the cause by association with such a radical group.\r\nThe Populists were generally regarded as the party of social unrest,\r\nof a regulated economy, and unsound money, and they were looked upon\r\nwith suspicion. To many they represented a threat to the American\r\nfree-enterprise system, and they were blamed for the labor troubles\r\nwhich had flared up in the bloody Homestead strike in the steel mills\r\nof Pennsylvania and in the Pullman strike, defying the powerful\r\nrailroads. Susan was never afraid to side with the underdog, and she\r\ncould well understand why western farmers, in the hope of relief, were\r\neagerly flocking into the Populist party when their corn sold for ten\r\ncents a bushel and the products they bought were high-priced and their\r\nmortgage interest was never lower than 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nTo the Populist convention, she declared, \"I have labored for women's\r\nenfranchisement for forty years and I have always said that for the\r\nparty that endorsed it, whether Republican, Democratic, or Populist, I\r\nwould wave my handkerchief.\"[389]\r\n\r\n\"We want more than the waving of your handkerchief, Miss Anthony,\"\r\ninterrupted a delegate, who then asked her, \"If the People's party put\r\na woman suffrage plank in its platform, will you go before the voters\r\nof this state and tell them that because the People's party has\r\nespoused the cause of woman suffrage, it deserves the vote of every\r\none who is a supporter of that cause?\"\r\n\r\n\"I most certainly will,\" she replied, adding as the audience cheered\r\nher wildly, \"for I would surely choose to ask votes for the party\r\nwhich stood for the principle of justice to women, though wrong on\r\nfinancial theories, rather than for the party which was sound on\r\nquestions of money and tariff, and silent on the pending amendment to\r\nsecure political equality to half of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I most certainly will\" was the phrase which was remembered and was\r\nflashed through the country, and as a result, the Republican press and\r\nSusan's Republican friends harshly criticized her for taking her stand\r\nwith the radicals.\r\n\r\nLike all political parties, the Populists found it hard to comprehend\r\njustice for women, but after a four-hour debate, the convention\r\nendorsed the woman suffrage amendment, absolving, however, members who\r\nrefused to support it. The rank and file rejoiced as if each and every\r\none of them were heart and soul for the cause. They cheered, they\r\nwaved their canes, they threw their hats high in the air, and then\r\nswarmed around Susan and Anna Shaw to shake their hands and welcome\r\nthem into the Populist party.\r\n\r\nWith woman suffrage at last a political issue in Kansas, Susan left\r\nthe field to her \"girls.\" Her homecoming brought reporters to 17\r\nMadison Street for the details about her alignment with the Populist\r\nparty. \"I didn't go over to the Populists,\" she told them. \"I have\r\nbeen like a drowning man for a long time, waiting for someone to throw\r\na plank in my direction. I didn't step on the whole platform, but just\r\non the woman suffrage plank.... Here is a party in power which is\r\nlikely to remain in power, and if it will give its endorsement to our\r\nmovement, we want it.\"[390]\r\n\r\nThis explanation, however, did not satisfy her critics, and as the\r\nRepublican press circulated false stories about her enthusiasm for the\r\nPopulist party, letters of protest poured in, among them one from\r\nHenry Blackwell. To him, she replied, \"I shall not praise the\r\nRepublicans of Kansas, or wish or work for their success, when I know\r\nby their own confessions to me that the rights of the women of their\r\nstate have been traded by them in cold blood for the votes of the\r\nlager beer foreigners and whisky Democrats.... I never, in my whole\r\nforty years work, so utterly repudiated any set of politicians as I do\r\nthose Republicans of Kansas.... I never was surer of my position that\r\nno self-respecting woman should wish or work for the success of a\r\nparty that ignores her political rights.\"[391]\r\n\r\nThe contest in Kansas was close and bitter. Kansas women carried on an\r\nable campaign with the help of Anna Howard Shaw and Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt. When Susan returned to the state in October, she not only found\r\nthat the Democrats had entered the fight with an anti-suffrage plank\r\nbut the Populists had noticeably lost ground since the Pullman strike\r\nriots, the court injunction against the strikers, and the arrest of\r\nEugene V. Debs. Again this prairie state, from which she had hoped so\r\nmuch, refused to extend suffrage to women. Impulsively she recommended\r\na little \"Patrick Henryism\" to the women of Kansas, suggesting that\r\nthey fold their hands and refuse to help men run the churches, the\r\ncharities, and the reform movements.[392]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCalifornia was the next state to demand Susan's attention. A\r\nRepublican legislature had submitted a woman suffrage amendment to be\r\nvoted on by the people in 1896, and the women of California asked for\r\nher help. She toured the state in the spring of 1895 with Anna Howard\r\nShaw, and everywhere she won friends. The continuous travel and\r\nspeaking, however, taxed her far more than she realized, and soon\r\nafter her return to the East, she collapsed. As this news flashed over\r\nthe wires, letters poured in from her friends, begging her to spare\r\nherself. Two of these letters were especially precious. One in bold\r\nvigorous script was from her good comrade, Parker Pillsbury, now\r\neighty-six, who had been an unfailing help during the most difficult\r\nyears of her career and whom she probably trusted more completely than\r\nany other man. The other from her dearest friend, Elizabeth Stanton,\r\nread, \"I never realized how desolate the world would be to me without\r\nyou until I heard of your sudden illness. Let me urge you with all the\r\nstrength I have, and all the love I bear you, to stay at home and rest\r\nand save your precious self.\"[393]\r\n\r\nShe now realized that rest was imperative for a time, but it troubled\r\nher that people thought of her as old and ill, and she wrote Clara\r\nColby never to mention anyone's illness in her _Woman's Tribune_,\r\nadding, \"It is so dreadful to get public thought centered on one as\r\nill--as I have had it the last two months.\"[394]\r\n\r\nShe had no intention of retiring from the field. She knew her own\r\nstrength and that her life must be one of action. \"I am able to endure\r\nthe strain of daily traveling and lecturing at over three-score and\r\nten,\" she observed, \"mainly because I have always worked and loved\r\nwork.... As machinery in motion lasts longer than when lying idle, so\r\na body and soul in active exercise escapes the corroding rust of\r\nphysical and mental laziness, which prematurely cuts off the life of\r\nso many women.\"[395]\r\n\r\nYet she did slow up a little, refusing an offer from the Slayton\r\nLecture Bureau for a series of lectures at $100 a night, and she\r\nengaged a capable secretary, Emma B. Sweet, to help her with her\r\ntremendous correspondence. \"Dear Rachel\" had given her a typewriter,\r\nand now instead of dashing off letters at her desk late at night, she\r\nlearned to dictate them to Mrs. Sweet at regular hours. As requests\r\ncame in from newspapers and magazines for her comments on a wide\r\nvariety of subjects, she answered those that made possible a word on\r\nthe advancement of women.\r\n\r\nBicycling had come into vogue and women as well as men were taking it\r\nup, some women even riding their bicycles in short skirts or bloomers.\r\nWhat did she think of this? \"If women ride the bicycle or climb\r\nmountains,\" she replied, \"they should don a costume which will permit\r\nthem the use of their legs.\" Of bicycling she said, \"I think it has\r\ndone more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I\r\nrejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a\r\nfeeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her\r\nseat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammeled womanhood.\"[396]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ida Husted Harper]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan returned to California in February 1896. Through the generosity\r\nand interest of two young Rochester friends, her Unitarian minister,\r\nWilliam C. Gannett, and his wife, Mary Gannett, she was able to take\r\nher secretary with her. Making her home in San Francisco with her\r\ndevoted friend, Ellen Sargent, she at once began to plan speaking\r\ntours for herself and her \"girls,\" many of whom, including her niece\r\nLucy, had come West to help her. She appealed successfully to Frances\r\nWillard to transfer the national W.C.T.U. convention to another state,\r\nfor she was determined to keep the issue of prohibition out of the\r\nCalifornia campaign.\r\n\r\nWith the press more than friendly and several San Francisco dailies\r\nrunning woman suffrage departments, she realized the importance of\r\nkeeping newspapers fed with readable factual material and enlisted the\r\naid of a young journalist, Ida Husted Harper, whom she had met in 1878\r\nwhile lecturing in Terre Haute, Indiana, and who was in California\r\nthat winter. When the San Francisco _Examiner_, William Randolph\r\nHearst's powerful Democratic paper, offered Susan a column on the\r\neditorial page if she would write it and sign it, she dictated her\r\nthoughts to Mrs. Harper, who smoothed them out for the column, helping\r\nher as Mrs. Stanton had in the past, for writing was still a great\r\nhardship. Grateful to Mrs. Harper, she sang her praises: \"The moment I\r\ngive the idea--the point--she formulates it into a good\r\nsentence--while I should have to haggle over it half an hour.\"[397]\r\n\r\nCalifornia women had won suffrage planks from Republicans, Populists,\r\nand Prohibitionists, and the prospects looked bright. Rich women came\r\nto their aid, Mrs. Leland Stanford, with her railroad fortune,\r\nfurnishing passes for all the speakers and organizers, and Mrs. Phoebe\r\nHearst contributing $1,000 to their campaign. What warmed Susan's\r\nheart, however, was the spirit of the rank and file, the seamstresses\r\nand washerwomen, paying their two-dollar pledges in twenty-five-cent\r\ninstallments, the poorly clad women bringing in fifty cents or a\r\ndollar which they had saved by going without tea, and the women who\r\nhad worked all day at their jobs, stopping at headquarters for a\r\npackage of circulars to fold and address at night. The working women\r\nof California made it plain that they wanted to vote.\r\n\r\nSusan insisted upon carrying out what she called her \"wild goose\r\nchase\" over the state.[398] People crowded to hear her at farmers'\r\npicnics in the mountains, in schoolhouses in small towns, and in\r\npoolrooms where chalked up on the blackboard she often found \"Welcome\r\nSusan B. Anthony.\" She was at home everywhere and ready for anything.\r\nThe men liked her short matter-of-fact speeches and her flashes of\r\nwit. Her hopes were high that the friendly people she met would not\r\nfail to vote justice to women.\r\n\r\nShe grew apprehensive, however, when the newspapers, pressured by\r\ntheir advertisers, one by one began to ignore woman suffrage. The\r\nLiquor Dealers' League had been sending letters to hotel owners,\r\ngrocers, and druggists, as well as to saloons, warning that votes for\r\nwomen would mean prohibition and would threaten their livelihood. Word\r\nwas spread that if women voted not one glass of beer would be sold in\r\nSan Francisco. As in Kansas, liquor interests had persuaded\r\nnaturalized Irish, Germans, and Swedes to oppose woman suffrage, so\r\nnow in California, they appealed to the Chinese.\r\n\r\nOn election day Susan was in San Francisco with Anna Howard Shaw and\r\nEllen Sargent, watching and anxiously waiting for the returns. Telling\r\nthe story of those last tense hours when women's fate hung in the\r\nbalance, Anna Howard Shaw reported, \"I shall always remember the\r\npicture of Miss Anthony and the wife of Senator Sargent wandering\r\naround the polls arm in arm at eleven o'clock at night, their tired\r\nfaces taking on lines of deeper depression with every minute, for the\r\ncount was against us.... When the final counts came in, we found that\r\nwe had won the state from the north down to Oakland and from the south\r\nup to San Francisco; but there was not sufficient majority to overcome\r\nthe adverse votes of San Francisco and Oakland. In San Francisco the\r\nsaloon element and the most aristocratic section ... made an equal\r\nshowing against us.... Every Chinese vote was against us.\"[399]\r\n\r\nIn spite of defeat in California, Susan had the joy of marking up two\r\nmore states for woman suffrage in 1896. Utah was granted statehood\r\nwith a woman suffrage provision in its constitution and Idaho's\r\nfavorable vote, though contested in the courts, was upheld by the\r\nState Supreme Court. Now women in Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, and Utah\r\nwere voters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[387] Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 763.\r\n\r\n[388] To Elizabeth Smith Miller, July 25, 1894, Elizabeth Smith Miller\r\nPapers, New York Public Library.\r\n\r\n[389] Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 788.\r\n\r\n[390] _Ibid._, p. 791.\r\n\r\n[391] _Ibid._, p. 794.\r\n\r\n[392] To Clara Colby, July 22, 1895, Anthony Collection, Henry E.\r\nHuntington Library.\r\n\r\n[393] Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 842.\r\n\r\n[394] N.d., Anthony Collection, Henry E.

This organization which she had conceived and\r\nnursed through its struggling infancy had grown in numbers and\r\nprestige, and she understood, as no one else could, the importance of\r\nleaving it in the right hands so that it could function successfully\r\nwithout her.\r\n\r\nThe young women now in the work, many of them just out of college,\r\nwere intelligent, efficient, and confident, and yet as she compared\r\nthem with the vivid consecrated women active in the early days of the\r\nmovement, she observed in her diary, \"[Clarina] Nichols--Paulina\r\nDavis--Lucy Stone--Frances D. Gage--Lucretia Mott & E. C.\r\nStanton--each without peer among any of our college graduates--young\r\nwomen of today.\"[400]\r\n\r\nEven so, she appreciated the \"young women of today\" whom she\r\naffectionately called her girls or her adopted nieces, but she still\r\nheld the reins tightly, although they often champed at the bit.\r\nRecognizing, however, that she must choose between personal power and\r\nprogress for her cause, she characteristically chose progress. Quick\r\nto appreciate ability and zeal when she saw it, she seldom failed to\r\nmake use of it. When Carrie Chapman Catt presented a detailed plan for\r\na thorough overhauling of the mechanics of the organization, she gave\r\nher approval, remarking drily, \"There never yet was a young woman who\r\ndid not feel that if she had had the management of the work from the\r\nbeginning, the cause would have been carried long ago. I felt just\r\nthat way when I was young.\"[401]\r\n\r\nOn four of her adopted nieces, Rachel Foster Avery, Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nHarriet Taylor Upton, and Carrie Chapman Catt, Susan felt that the\r\ngreater part of her work would fall and be \"worthily done.\"[402] Yet\r\nshe feared that in their enthusiasm for efficient organization they\r\nmight lose the higher concepts of freedom and justice which had been\r\nthe driving force behind her work. Not having learned the lessons of\r\nleadership when the cause was unpopular, they lacked the discipline of\r\nadversity, which bred in the consecrated reformer the wisdom,\r\ntolerance, and vision so necessary for the success of her task. What\r\nthey did understand far better than the highly individualistic\r\npioneers was the value of teamwork, which grew in importance as the\r\nNational American Association expanded far beyond the ability of one\r\nperson to cope with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rachel Foster Avery]\r\n\r\nProbably first in her affections was Rachel Foster Avery, who had been\r\nlike a daughter to her since their trip to Europe together in 1883.\r\nThe confidence she felt in their friendship was always a comfort.\r\nRachel's intelligent approach to problems made her an asset at every\r\nmeeting, and Susan relied much on her judgment.\r\n\r\nIn Anna Howard Shaw, ten years older than Rachel, Susan had found the\r\nhardy campaigner and orator for whom she had longed. Anna expressed a\r\nwarmth and understanding that most of the younger women lacked, and\r\nbest of all she loved the cause as Susan herself loved it. Because of\r\nher close friendship with Susan's niece Lucy, she was regarded as one\r\nof the family, and whenever possible between lectures she stopped over\r\nin Rochester for a good talk with \"Aunt Susan.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet Taylor Upton of Warren, Ohio, had enlisted in the ranks in\r\nthe 1880s when her father was a member of Congress. Because of her\r\ninfluence in Washington and Ohio, Harriet was invaluable, and Susan\r\nspeedily brought her into the official circle of the National American\r\nAssociation as treasurer, even thinking of her as a possible\r\npresident.[403] Harriet's jovial irrepressible personality readily won\r\nfriends, and Susan found her a refreshing and comfortable companion,\r\nable to see a bit of humor in almost every situation. When differences\r\nof opinion at meetings threatened to get out of hand, Harriet could\r\nalways be relied on to break the tension with a few witty remarks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harriet Taylor Upton]\r\n\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt gave every indication of developing into an\r\noutstanding executive. Not another one of Susan's \"girls\" could so\r\nquickly or so intelligently size up a situation as Carrie, nor could\r\nthey so effectively put into action well-thought-out plans. Not as\r\npopular a speaker as the more emotional Anna Howard Shaw, she held her\r\naudiences by her appeal to their intelligence. Tall, handsome, and\r\nwell dressed, she never failed to leave a favorable impression. Only\r\nher name irked Susan, and as Susan wrote Clara Colby, \"If Catt it must\r\nbe then I insist, she should keep her own father's name--Lane--and\r\nnot her first husband's name--Chapman,\"[404] but the three Cs\r\nintrigued Carrie and she continued to be known as Carrie Chapman Catt.\r\nNow living in the East because her husband's expanding business had\r\nbrought him to New York, she was easily accessible, and from her\r\nbeautiful new home at Bensonhurst, a suburb of Brooklyn, she carried\r\non the rapidly growing work of the organization committee until a New\r\nYork City office became imperative. In Carrie, Susan recognized\r\nqualities demanded of a leader at this stage of the campaign when\r\nsuffragists must learn to be as keen as politicians and as well\r\norganized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Spring is not heralded in Washington by the arrival of the robin,\"\r\ncommented a Washington newspaper, \"but by the appearance of Miss\r\nAnthony's red shawl.\" Susan was still the dominating figure at the\r\nannual woman suffrage conventions. Everyone looked eagerly for the\r\ntall lithe gray-haired woman with a red shawl on her arm or around her\r\nshoulders. Once when Susan appeared on the platform with a new white\r\ncrepe shawl, the reporters immediately registered their displeasure by\r\nputting down their pencils. This did not escape her, and always on\r\ngood terms with the newsmen and informal with her audiences, she\r\ncalled out, \"Boys, what is the matter?\"[405]\r\n\r\n\"Where is the red shawl?\" one of them asked. \"No red shawl, no\r\nreport.\"\r\n\r\nEnjoying this little by-play, she sent her niece Lucy back to the\r\nhotel for the red shawl, and when Lucy brought it up to the platform\r\nand put it about her shoulders, the audience burst into applause, for\r\nthe red shawl, like Susan herself, had become the well-loved symbol of\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\nSusan was convinced that the annual national convention should always\r\nbe held in Washington, where Congress could see and feel the growing\r\nstrength and influence of the movement. Her \"girls,\" on the other\r\nhand, wanted to take their conventions to different parts of the\r\ncountry to widen their influence. Not as certain as Susan that work\r\nfor a federal amendment must come first, many of them contended that a\r\nfew more states won for woman suffrage would best help the cause at\r\nthis time. The southern women, now active, were firm believers in\r\nstates' rights and supported state work.[406] Susan's experience had\r\ntaught her the impracticability of direct appeal to the voters in the\r\nstates, now that foreign-born men in increasing numbers were arrayed\r\nagainst votes for women. In spite of her arguments and her pleas, the\r\nNational American Association voted in 1894 to hold conventions in\r\ndifferent parts of the country in alternate years. Disappointed, but\r\ntrying her best graciously to follow the will of the majority, she\r\ntraveled to Atlanta and to Des Moines for the conventions of 1895 and\r\n1897.\r\n\r\nNor did the younger women welcome the messages which Mrs. Stanton, at\r\nSusan's insistence, sent to every convention. Susan herself often\r\nwished her good friend would stick more closely to woman suffrage\r\ninstead of introducing extraneous subjects, such as \"Educated\r\nSuffrage,\" \"The Matriarchate,\" or \"Women and the Church,\" but\r\nnevertheless she proudly read her papers to successive conventions.\r\nInsisting that the conventions were too academic, Mrs. Stanton urged\r\nSusan to inject more vitality into them by broadening their platform.\r\nSusan, however, had come to the conclusion that concentration on woman\r\nsuffrage was imperative in order to unite all women under one banner\r\nand build up numbers which Congressmen were bound to respect. With\r\nthis her \"girls\" agreed 100 per cent. While all of them were convinced\r\nsuffragists, they were divided on other issues, and few of them were\r\nwholehearted feminists, as were Susan and Mrs. Stanton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the publication of _The Woman's Bible_ in 1895, Mrs. Stanton\r\nalmost upset the applecart, stirring up heated controversy in the\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association. _The Woman's Bible_ was\r\na keen and sometimes biting commentary on passages in the Bible\r\nrelating to women. It questioned the traditional interpretation which\r\nfor centuries has fastened the stigma of inferiority upon women, and\r\npointed out that the female as well as the male was created in the\r\nimage of God. To those who regarded every word of the Bible as\r\ninspired by God, _The Woman's Bible_ was heresy, and both the clergy\r\nand the press stirred up a storm of protest against it. Suffragists\r\nwere condemned for compiling a new Bible and were obliged to explain\r\nagain and again that _The Woman's Bible_ expressed Mrs. Stanton's\r\npersonal views and not those of the movement.\r\n\r\nSusan regarded _The Woman's Bible_ as a futile, questionable\r\ndigression from the straight path of woman suffrage. To Clara Colby,\r\nwho praised it in her _Woman's Tribune_, she wrote, \"Of all her great\r\nspeeches, I am always proud--but of her Bible commentaries, I am not\r\nproud--either of their spirit or letter.... I could cry a heap--every\r\ntime I read or think--if it would undo them--or do anybody or myself\r\nor the cause or Mrs. Stanton any good--they are so entirely unlike her\r\nformer self--so flippant and superficial. But she thinks I have gone\r\nover to the enemy--so counts my judgment worth nothing more than that\r\nof any other narrow-souled body.... But I shall love and honor her to\r\nthe end--whether her _Bible_ please me or not. So I hope she will do\r\nfor me.\"[407]\r\n\r\nShe was, however, wholly unprepared for the rebellion staged by her\r\n\"girls\" at the Washington convention of 1896, when, led by Rachel\r\nFoster Avery, they repudiated _The Woman's Bible_ and proposed a\r\nresolution declaring that their organization had no connection with\r\nit. This was clear proof to Susan that her \"girls\" lacked tolerance\r\nand wisdom. Listening to the debate, she was heartsick. Anna Howard\r\nShaw and Mrs. Catt as well as Alice Stone Blackwell spoke for the\r\nresolution. Only a few raised their voices against it, among them her\r\nsister Mary, Clara Colby, Mrs. Blake, and a young woman new to the\r\nranks, Charlotte Perkins Stetson.\r\n\r\nSusan was presiding, and leaving the chair to express her opinions,\r\nshe firmly declared, \"To pass such a resolution is to set back the\r\nhands on the dial of reform.... We have all sorts of people in the\r\nAssociation and ... a Christian has no more right on our platform than\r\nan atheist. When this platform is too narrow for all to stand on, I\r\nshall not be on it.... Who is to set up a line? Neither you nor I can\r\ntell but Mrs. Stanton will come out triumphant and that this will be\r\nthe great thing done in woman's cause. Lucretia Mott at first thought\r\nMrs. Stanton had injured the cause of woman's rights by insisting on\r\nthe demand for woman suffrage, but she had sense enough not to pass a\r\nresolution about it....[408]\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to cater to the whims and prejudices of people?\" she\r\nasked them. \"We draw out from other people our own thought. If, when\r\nyou go out to organize, you go with a broad spirit, you will create\r\nand call out breadth and toleration. You had better organize one woman\r\non a broad platform than 10,000 on a narrow platform of intolerance\r\nand bigotry.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice tense with emotion, she concluded, \"This resolution adopted\r\nwill be a vote of censure upon a woman who is without a peer in\r\nintellectual and statesmanlike ability; one who has stood for half a\r\ncentury the acknowledged leader of progressive thought and demand in\r\nregard to all matters pertaining to the absolute freedom of\r\nwomen.\"[409]\r\n\r\nWhen the resolution was adopted 53 to 40, she was so disappointed in\r\nher \"girls\" and so hurt by their defiance that she was tempted to\r\nresign. Hurrying to New York after the convention to talk with Mrs.\r\nStanton, she found her highly indignant and insistent that they both\r\nresign from the ungrateful organization which had repudiated the women\r\nto whom it owed its existence. The longer Susan considered taking this\r\nstep, the less she felt able to make the break. She severely\r\nreprimanded Mrs. Catt, Rachel, Harriet Upton, and Anna, telling them\r\nthey were setting up an inquisition.\r\n\r\nFinally she wrote Mrs. Stanton, \"No, my dear, instead of my resigning\r\nand leaving those half-fledged chickens without any mother, I think it\r\nmy duty and the duty of yourself and all the liberals to be at the\r\nnext convention and try to reverse this miserable narrow action.\"[410]\r\n\r\nTo a reporter who wanted her views on _The Woman's Bible_, she made it\r\nplain that she had no part in writing the book, but added, \"I think\r\nwomen have just as good a right to interpret and twist the Bible to\r\ntheir own advantage as men have always twisted it and turned it to\r\ntheirs. It was written by men, and therefore its reference to women\r\nreflects the light in which they were regarded in those days. In the\r\nsame way the history of our Revolutionary War was written, in which\r\nvery little is said of the noble deeds of women, though we know how\r\nthey stood by and helped the great work; it is so with history all\r\nthrough.\"[411]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor some years, Susan's girls had been urging her to write her\r\nreminiscences, spurred on by the fact that Mrs. Stanton, Mary\r\nLivermore, and Julia Ward Howe were writing theirs. There were also\r\nother good reasons for putting her to work at this task. Writing would\r\nkeep her safely at home and away from the strenuous work in the field\r\nwhich they feared was sapping her strength. It would keep her well\r\noccupied so that they could develop the work and the conventions in\r\ntheir own way.\r\n\r\nSusan put off this task from month to month and from year to year,\r\ntorn between her desire to leave a true record of her work and her\r\nlonging to be always in the thick of the suffrage fight. Finally she\r\nbegan looking about for a collaborator, convinced that she herself\r\ncould never write an interesting line. Ida Husted Harper, with her\r\nnewspaper experience and her interest in the cause, seemed the logical\r\nchoice, and in the spring of 1897, she came to 17 Madison Street to\r\nwork on the biography.[412]\r\n\r\nThe attic had been remodeled for workrooms and here Susan now spent\r\nher days with Mrs. Harper, trying to reconstruct the past. She had\r\ndefinite ideas about how the book should be written, holding up as a\r\nmodel the biography of William Lloyd Garrison recently written by his\r\nchildren. Mrs. Harper also had high standards, and influenced by\r\nthe formalities of the day, edited Susan's vivid brusque\r\nletters--hurriedly written and punctuated with dashes--so that they\r\nconformed with her own easy but more formal style. To this Susan\r\nreadily consented, for she always depreciated her own writing ability.\r\nOn one point, however, she was adamant, that her story be told without\r\ndwelling upon the disagreements among the old workers.\r\n\r\nThe household was geared to the \"bog,\" as they called the biography.\r\nMary, supervising as usual, watched over their meals and the housework\r\nwith the aid of a young rosy-cheeked Canadian girl, Anna Dann, who had\r\nrecently come to work for them and whom they at once took to their\r\nhearts, making her one of the family. Soon another young girl,\r\nGenevieve Hawley from Fort Scott, Kansas, was employed to help with\r\nthe endless copying, sorting of letters, and pasting of scrapbooks,\r\nand with the current correspondence which piled up and diverted Susan\r\nfrom the book.[413] Through 1897 and 1898, they worked at top speed.\r\n\r\n_The Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony, A Story of the Evolution of\r\nthe Status of Women_, in two volumes, by Ida Husted Harper, was\r\npublished by the Bowen Merrill Company of Indianapolis just before\r\nChristmas 1898. Happy as a young girl out of school, Susan inscribed\r\ncopies for her many friends and eagerly watched for reviews, pleased\r\nwith the favorable comments in newspapers and magazines throughout\r\nthis country and Europe.[414]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy this time the Cuban rebellion was crowding all other news out of\r\nthe papers, and Susan followed it closely, for this struggle for\r\nfreedom instantly won her sympathy. She hoped that Spain under\r\npressure from the United States might be persuaded to give Cuba her\r\nindependence, but the blowing up of the battleship _Maine_ and the war\r\ncries of the press and of a faction in Congress led to armed\r\nintervention in April 1898. Always opposed to war as a means of\r\nsettling disputes, she wrote Rachel, \"To think of the mothers of this\r\nnation sitting back in silence without even the power of a legal\r\nprotest--while their sons are taken without a by-your-leave! Well all\r\nthrough--it is barbarous ... and I hope you and all our young women\r\nwill rouse to work as never before--and get the women of the Republic\r\nclothed with the power of control of conditions in peace--or when it\r\nshall come again--which Heaven forbid--in war.\"[415]\r\n\r\nNot only did she express these sentiments in letters to her friends,\r\nbut in a public meeting, where only patriotic fervor and flag-waving\r\nwere welcome, she dared criticize the unsanitary army camps and the\r\ngreed and graft which deprived soldiers of wholesome food. \"There\r\nisn't a mother in the land,\" she declared, \"who wouldn't know that a\r\nshipload of typhoid stricken soldiers would need cots to lie on and\r\nfuel to cook with, and that a swamp was not a desirable place in which\r\nto pitch a camp.... What the government needs at such a time is not\r\nalone bacteriologists and army officers but also women who know how to\r\ntake care of sick boys and have the common sense to surround them with\r\nsanitary conditions.\"[416] At this her audience, at first hostile,\r\nburst into applause.\r\n\r\nMore and more disturbed by the inefficient care of the wounded and the\r\nfeeding of enlisted men, she wrote Rachel, \"Every day's reports and\r\ncomments about the war only show the need of women at the front--not\r\nas employees permitted to be there because they begged to be--but\r\nthere by right--as managers and dictators in all departments in which\r\nwomen have been trained--those of feeding and caring for in health and\r\nnursing the sick.\"[417]\r\n\r\nThe war over, the problem of governing the Philippines, Puerto Rico,\r\nand Hawaii was of great interest to her, and she at once asked for the\r\nenfranchisement of the women of these newly won island possessions.\r\nShe regarded it as an outrage for the most democratic nation in the\r\nworld to foist upon them an exclusively masculine government, a \"male\r\noligarchy,\" as she called it. \"I really believe I shall explode,\" she\r\nwrote Clara Colby, \"if some of you young women don't wake up and raise\r\nyour voice in protest.... I wonder if when I am under the sod--or\r\ncremated and floating in the air--I shall have to stir you and others\r\nup. How can you not be all on fire?\"[418]\r\n\r\nThe unwillingness of her \"girls\" to relate woman suffrage to\r\ncontemporary public affairs such as this, repeatedly disappointed her.\r\nYet she was well aware that the younger generation would never see the\r\nwork through her eyes, or exactly follow her pattern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDisappointed that her National American Woman Suffrage Association did\r\nnot attract members as did the W.C.T.U. or the General Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs, she confessed to Clara Colby, \"It is the disheartening\r\npart of my life that so very few women will work for the emancipation\r\nof their own half of the race.\"[419] Watching women flock into these\r\nother organizations and contributing to all sorts of charities, she\r\nwas obliged to admit that \"very few are capable of seeing that the\r\ncause of nine-tenths of all the misfortunes which come to women, and\r\nto men also, lies in the subjection of women, and therefore the\r\nimportant thing is to lay the ax at the root.\"[420]\r\n\r\nShe also discovered that it was one thing to build up a large\r\norganization and another to keep women so busy with pressing work for\r\nthe cause that they did not find time to expend their energies on the\r\nmechanics of organization. Not only did she chafe at the red tape most\r\nof them spun, but she often felt that they were too prone to linger in\r\nacademic by-ways, listening to speeches and holding pleasant\r\nconventions. Since the California campaign of 1896, only one state,\r\nWashington, had been roused to vote on a woman suffrage amendment,\r\nwhich was defeated and only one more state Delaware had granted women\r\nthe right to vote for members of school boards.\r\n\r\nAgain and again she warned her \"girls\" that some kind of action on\r\nwoman suffrage by Congress every year was important. A hearing, a\r\ncommittee report, a debate, or even an unfavorable vote would, she was\r\nconvinced, do more to stir up the whole nation than all the speakers\r\nand organizers that could be sent through the country.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts as these, relative to the work which was always on her\r\nmind, she dashed off to one after another of her young colleagues.\r\n\"Your letters sound like a trumpet blast,\" wrote Anna Howard Shaw,\r\ngrateful for her counsel. \"They read like St. Paul's Epistles to the\r\nRomans, so strong, so clear, so full of courage.\"[421]\r\n\r\nAt seventy-eight, Susan realized that the time was approaching when\r\nshe must make up her mind to turn over to a younger woman the\r\npresidency of the National American Association, and during the summer\r\nof 1898 she announced to her executive committee that she would retire\r\non her eightieth birthday in 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[400] Ms., Diary, Nov. 7, 1895\r\n\r\n[401] Mary Gray Peck, _Carrie Chapman Catt_ (New York, 1944), p. 84.\r\n\r\n[402] Ms., Diary, Nov. 27, 1895.\r\n\r\n[403] To Mrs. Upton, Sept. 5, 1890, University of Rochester Library,\r\nRochester, New York.\r\n\r\n[404] Feb. 10, 1894, Anthony Collection, Henry E.

Yet she had no illusion of\r\nspeedy or easy success for her \"girls\" and she did her best to prepare\r\nthem for the obstacles they would inevitably meet. She warned them not\r\nto expect their cause to triumph merely because it was just.\r\n\"Governments,\" she told them, \"never do any great good things from\r\nmere principle, from mere love of justice.... You expect too much of\r\nhuman nature when you expect that.\"[422]\r\n\r\nThe movement had reached an impasse. The temper of Congress, as shown\r\nby the admission of Hawaii as a territory without woman suffrage, was\r\nboth indifferent and hostile. That this attitude did not express the\r\nwill of the American people, she was firmly convinced. It was due, she\r\nbelieved, to the political influence of powerful groups opposed to\r\nwoman suffrage--the liquor interests controlling the votes of\r\nincreasing numbers of immigrants, machine politicians fearful of\r\nlosing their power, and financial interests whose conservatism\r\nresisted any measure which might upset the status quo. How to\r\nundermine this opposition was now her main problem, and she saw no\r\nother way but persistent agitation through a more active, more\r\neffective, ever-growing woman suffrage organization, reaching a wider\r\ncross section of the people. She herself had established a press\r\nbureau which was feeding interesting factual articles on woman\r\nsuffrage to newspapers throughout the country, for as she wrote Mrs.\r\nColby, the suffrage cause \"needs to picture its demands in the daily\r\npapers where the unconverted can see them rather than in special\r\npapers where only those already converted can see them.\"[423]\r\n\r\nOf greatest importance to her was winning the support of organized\r\nlabor. Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of\r\nLabor, had already shown his friendliness toward equal pay and votes\r\nfor women and was putting women organizers in the field to speed the\r\nunionization of women. Even so she was surprised at the enthusiasm\r\nwith which she was received at the American Federation of Labor\r\nconvention in 1899, when the four hundred delegates by a rising vote\r\nadopted a strong resolution urging favorable action on a federal woman\r\nsuffrage amendment.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible she had always established friendly relations with\r\nlabor organizations, first in 1869 with William H. Sylvis's National\r\nLabor Union and then with the Knights of Labor and their leader,\r\nTerrence V. Powderly.[424] When Eugene V. Debs, president of the\r\nAmerican Railway Union, was arrested during the Pullman strike in 1894\r\nfor defying a court injunction, she did not rate him, as so many did,\r\na dangerous radical, but as an earnest reformer, crusading for an\r\nunpopular cause. They had met years before in Terre Haute, where at\r\nhis request she had lectured on woman suffrage, and immediately they\r\nhad won each other's sympathy and respect. She did not see indications\r\nof anarchy in the Pullman and Homestead strikes or in the Haymarket\r\nriot, but regarded them as an unfortunate phase of an industrial\r\nrevolution which in time would improve the relations of labor and\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThat women would be effected by this industrial revolution was obvious\r\nto her, and she wanted them to understand it and play their part in\r\nit. For this reason she saw the importance of keeping the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association informed on all developments\r\naffecting wage-earning women and to her delight she found three young\r\nsuffragists wide awake on this subject. One of them, Florence Kelley,\r\nhad joined forces with that remarkable young woman, Jane Addams, in\r\nher valuable social experiment, Hull House, in the slums of Chicago,\r\nand was now devoting herself to improving the working conditions of\r\nwomen and children. She represented a new trend in thought and\r\nwork--social service--which made a great appeal to college women and\r\nset in motion labor legislation designed to protect women and\r\nchildren. Another young woman of promise, Gail Laughlin, pioneering as\r\na lawyer, approached the subject from the feminist viewpoint, seeking\r\nprotection for women not through labor legislation based on sex, but\r\nthrough trade unions, the vote, equal pay, and a wider recognition of\r\nwomen's right to contract for their labor on the same terms as men.\r\nHer survey of women's working conditions, presented at a convention of\r\nthe National American Association was so valuable and attracted so\r\nmuch attention that she was appointed to the United States Labor\r\nCommission. Harriot Stanton Blatch also understood the significance of\r\nthe industrial revolution and woman's part in it, and she too opposed\r\nlabor legislation based on sex. Coming from England occasionally to\r\nvisit her mother in New York, she brought her liberal viewpoint into\r\nwoman suffrage conventions with a flare of oratory matching that of\r\nher gifted parents. \"The more I see of her,\" Susan remarked to a\r\nfriend, \"the more I feel the greatness of her character.\"[425]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough it was Susan's intention to hew to the line of woman suffrage\r\nand not to comment publicly on controversial issues, she could not\r\nkeep silent when confronted with injustice. Religious intolerance,\r\nbigotry, and racial discrimination always forced her to take a stand,\r\nregardless of the criticism she might bring on herself.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the Negro in both the North and the South was always\r\nof great concern to her, and during the 1890s, when a veritable\r\nepidemic of lynchings and race riots broke out, she expressed herself\r\nfreely in Rochester newspapers. She noted the dangerous trend as\r\nindicated by new anti-Negro societies and the limitation of membership\r\nto white Americans in the Spanish-American War veterans' organization.\r\nWhenever the opportunity presented itself, she put into practice her\r\nown sincere belief in race equality. During every Washington\r\nconvention, she arranged to have one of her good speakers occupy the\r\npulpit of a Negro church, and in the South she made it a point to\r\nspeak herself in Negro churches and schools and before their\r\norganizations, even though this might prejudice southerners. In her\r\nown home, she gladly welcomed the Negro lecturers and educators who\r\ncame to Rochester. This seeking out of the Negro in friendliness was a\r\nreligious duty to her and a pleasure. She demanded of everyone\r\nemployed in her household, respectful treatment of Negro guests. She\r\nrejoiced when she saw Negroes in the audience at woman suffrage\r\nconventions in Washington, and it gave her great satisfaction to hear\r\nMary Church Terrell, a beautiful intelligent Negro who had been\r\neducated at Oberlin and in Europe, making speeches which equaled and\r\neven surpassed those of the most eloquent white suffragists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan did not fail to keep in touch with the international feminist\r\nmovement, and in the summer of 1899, when she was seventy-nine years\r\nold, she headed the United States delegation to the International\r\nCouncil of Women, meeting in London. Visiting Harriot Stanton Blatch\r\nat her home in Basingstoke, she first conferred with the leading\r\nBritish feminists, bringing herself up to date on the progress of\r\ntheir cause. In England as in the United States, the burden of the\r\nsuffrage campaign had shifted from the shoulders of the pioneers to\r\ntheir daughters, and they were carrying on with vigor, pressing for\r\nthe passage of a franchise bill in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nMoving on to London, she was acclaimed as she had been at the World's\r\nFair in Chicago. \"The papers here have been going wild over Miss\r\nAnthony, declaring her to be the most unaggressive woman suffragist\r\never seen,\" reported a journalist to his newspaper in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFrom China, India, New Zealand, and Australia, from South Africa,\r\nPalestine, Persia, and the Argentine, as well as from Europe and the\r\nUnited States, women had come to London to discuss their progress and\r\ntheir problems, and Susan, pointing out to them the goal toward which\r\nthey must head, declared with confidence, \"The day will come when man\r\nwill recognize woman as his peer, not only at the fireside but in the\r\ncouncils of the nation. Then, and not until then, will there be the\r\nperfect comradeship ... between the sexes that shall result in the\r\nhighest development of the race.\"[426]\r\n\r\nShe had hoped that Queen Victoria would receive the delegates at\r\nWindsor Castle, thus indicating her approval of the International\r\nCouncil. She longed to talk with this woman who had ruled so long and\r\nso well. That a queen sat on the throne of England, this in itself was\r\nimportant to her and she wanted to express her gratitude, although she\r\nwas well aware that the Queen had never used her influence for the\r\nimprovement of laws relating to women. She had hoped to convince her\r\nof the need of votes for women, but Queen Victoria never gave her the\r\nopportunity. All that influential Englishwomen were able to arrange\r\nwas the admission of the delegates to the courtyard of Windsor Castle\r\nto watch the Queen start on her drive and to tea in the banquet room\r\nwithout the Queen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carrie Chapman Catt]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning home late in August 1899, Susan began at once to make\r\ndefinite plans to turn over the presidency of the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association to a younger woman. Although she well knew\r\nthat the choice of her successor was actually in the hands of the\r\nmembership, it was her intention to do what she could within the\r\nbounds of democratic procedure to insure the best possible leadership.\r\nTo fill the office, she turned instinctively to Anna Howard Shaw whom\r\nshe loved more dearly as the years went by and whose selfless devotion\r\nto the cause she trusted implicitly. Yet Anna, in spite of her many\r\nqualifications, lacked a few which were exceptional in Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt--creative executive ability, diplomacy, a talent for working with\r\npeople, directing them, and winning their devotion. With growing\r\nadmiration, Susan had been watching Mrs. Catt's indefatigable work in\r\nthe states where she had been building up active branches. Her flare\r\nfor raising money was outstanding, and Susan realized, as few others\r\ndid, the crying need of funds for the campaigns ahead. In addition\r\nMrs. Catt had no personal financial worries, for her husband,\r\nsuccessful in business, was sympathetic to her work. Anna, on the\r\nother hand, would have to support herself by lecturing and carry as\r\nwell the burden of the presidency of a rapidly growing organization.\r\n\r\nAnna made the decision for Susan. She urged the candidacy of Mrs.\r\nCatt, although her highest ambition had always been to succeed her\r\nbeloved Aunt Susan. As she later confessed to Susan, this was a\r\npersonal sacrifice which cost her many a heartache, but she \"honestly\r\nfelt that Mrs. Catt was better fitted ... as well as freer to go into\r\nan unpaid field.\"[427] Susan therefore approached Mrs. Catt through\r\nRachel and Harriet Upton, and was relieved when she consented to stand\r\nfor election.\r\n\r\nRumors of Susan's retirement aroused ambitions in Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake, who from the point of seniority and devoted work in New York\r\nwas regarded as being next in line for the presidency by Mrs. Stanton\r\nand Mrs. Colby. Unable to visualize Mrs. Blake as the leader of this\r\nlarge organization with its diverse strong personalities, Susan\r\nnevertheless conceded her right to compete for the office. Although\r\nshe appreciated Mrs. Blake's valuable work for the cause, there never\r\nhad been understanding or sympathy between them. Temperamentally the\r\nblunt stern New Englander with untiring drive had little in common\r\nwith the southern beauty turned reformer.\r\n\r\nA change in the presidency needed wise and patient handling as\r\npersonal ambitions, prejudices, and misunderstandings reared their\r\nheads. When there were murmurings of secession among a small group if\r\nMrs. Catt were elected, Susan wrote Mrs. Colby that such talk was\r\n\"very immature, very despotic, very undemocratic,\" and she hoped she\r\nwas not one of the malcontents.[428]\r\n\r\nAnother problem was the future of the organization committee which\r\nunder Mrs. Catt's chairmanship had carried on a large part of the\r\nwork. Its influence was considerable and could readily develop so as\r\nto conflict with that of the officers, thus threatening the unity of\r\nthe whole organization. To dissolve the committee seemed to Susan and\r\nher closest advisors the wisest procedure. Mary Garrett Hay, who had\r\nworked closely with Mrs. Catt on the organization committee, opposed\r\nthis plan, but after earnest discussion the officers, including Mrs.\r\nCatt, agreed to dissolve the organization committee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Susan appeared on the platform at the opening session of the\r\nWashington convention in February 1900, there was thunderous applause\r\nfrom an audience tense with emotion at the thought of losing the\r\nleader who had guided them for so many years. The tall gray-haired\r\nwoman in black satin, with soft rich lace at her throat and the\r\nproverbial red shawl about her shoulders, had become the symbol of\r\ntheir cause. Now, as she looked down upon them with a friendly smile\r\nand motherly tenderness, tears came to their eyes, and they wanted to\r\nremember always just how she looked at that moment. Then she broke the\r\ntension with a call to duty, a summons to press for the federal\r\namendment, and one more plea that they always hold their annual\r\nconventions in the national capital.\r\n\r\nDifficult and sad as this official leave-taking was, she had made up\r\nher mind to carry if through with good cheer. Tirelessly she presided\r\nat three sessions daily. With the pride of a mother, she listened to\r\nthe many reports and with particular satisfaction to that of the\r\ntreasurer which showed all debts paid and pledges amounting to $10,000\r\nto start the new year. Susan herself had made this possible, raising\r\nenough to pay past debts and securing pledges so that the new\r\nadministration could start its work free from financial worries.\r\n\r\n\"I have fully determined to retire from the active presidency of the\r\nAssociation,\" she announced when the reports and speeches were over.\r\n\"I am not retiring now because I feel unable, mentally or physically,\r\nto do the necessary work, but because I wish to see the organization\r\nin the hands of those who are to have its management in the future. I\r\nwant to see you all at work, while I am alive, so I can scold if you\r\ndo not do it well. Give the matter of selecting your officers serious\r\nthought. Consider who will do the best work for the political\r\nenfranchisement of women, and let no personal feelings enter into the\r\nquestion.\"[429]\r\n\r\nWatching developments with the keen eye of a politician, she was\r\nconfident that Mrs. Catt would be elected to succeed her, although\r\nMrs. Blake's candidacy was still being assiduously pressed and\r\ncirculars recommending her, signed by Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Russell Sage\r\nand Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, were being widely distributed. Just before\r\nthe balloting, however, Mrs. Blake withdrew her name in the interest\r\nof harmony. This left the field to Mrs. Catt, who received 254 votes\r\nof the 278 cast.\r\n\r\nA burst of applause greeted the announcement of Mrs. Catt's election.\r\nThen abruptly it stopped, as the realization swept over the delegates\r\nthat Aunt Susan was no longer their president. Walking to the front of\r\nthe platform, Susan took Mrs. Catt by the hand, and while the\r\ndelegates applauded, the two women stood before them, the one showing\r\nin her kind face the experience and wisdom of years, the other young,\r\nintelligent, and beautiful, her life still before her. There were\r\ntears in Susan's eyes and her voice was unsteady as she said, \"I am\r\nsure you have made a wise choice.... 'New conditions bring new\r\nduties.' These new duties, these changed conditions, demand stronger\r\nhands, younger heads, and fresher hearts. In Mrs. Catt, you have my\r\nideal leader. I present to you my successor.\"[430]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan's joyous confidence in the new administration was rudely jolted\r\nas controversy over the future of the organization committee flared up\r\nduring the last days of the convention. Under strong pressure from\r\nMary Garrett Hay, Mrs. Catt had counseled with Henry Blackwell, and at\r\none of the last sessions he had slipped in a motion authorizing the\r\ncontinuance of the organization committee.[431]\r\n\r\nStunned by this development and looking upon it as a threat to the\r\nharmony of the new administration, Susan, supported by Harriet Upton\r\nand Rachel, prepared to take action, and the next morning, at the\r\nfirst post-convention executive committee meeting at which Mrs. Catt\r\npresided, Susan proposed that the national officers, headed by Mrs.\r\nCatt, take over the duties of the organization committee. This\r\nprecipitated a heated debate, during which Henry Blackwell and his\r\ndaughter, Alice, called such procedure unconstitutional, and Mary Hay\r\nresigned. As the discussion became too acrimonious, Mrs. Catt put an\r\nend to it by calling up unfinished business, and thus managed to\r\nsteer the remainder of the session into less troubled waters. The next\r\nday, however, Susan brought the matter up again, and on her motion the\r\norganization committee was voted out of existence with praise for its\r\nadmirable record of service.\r\n\r\nHere were all the makings of a factional feud which, if fanned into\r\nflame, could well have split the National American Association. Not\r\nonly had the old organization interfered with the new, indirectly\r\nreprimanding Mrs. Catt, but Susan, by her own personal influence and\r\ndetermination, had reversed the action of the convention. As a result,\r\nMrs. Catt was indignant, hurt, and sorely tempted to resign, but after\r\nsending a highly critical letter to every member of the business\r\ncommittee, she took up her work with vigor.\r\n\r\nDisappointed and heartsick over the turn of events, Susan searched for\r\na way to re-establish harmony and her own faith in her successor.\r\nRealizing that a mother's cool counsel and guiding hand were needed to\r\nheal the misunderstandings, and convinced that unity and trust could\r\nbe restored only by frank discussion of the problem by those involved,\r\nshe asked for a meeting of the business committee at her home. \"What\r\ncan we do to get back into trust in each other?\" she wrote Laura Clay.\r\n\"That is the thing we must do--somehow--and it cannot be done by\r\nletter. We must hold a meeting--and we must have you--and every single\r\none of our members at it.\"[432]\r\n\r\nImpatient at what to her seemed unnecessary delay, she kept prodding\r\nMrs. Catt to call this meeting. Fortunately both Susan and Mrs. Catt\r\nwere genuinely fond of each other and placed the welfare of the cause\r\nabove personal differences. Both were tolerant and steady and\r\nunderstood the pressures put on the leader of a great organization.\r\nAnxious and troubled as she waited for this meeting, Susan appreciated\r\nAnna Shaw's visits as never before, marking them as red-letter days on\r\nher calender.\r\n\r\nLate in August 1900, all the officers finally gathered at 17 Madison\r\nStreet, and Susan listened to their discussions with deep concern. She\r\nwas confident she could rely completely on Harriet Upton, Rachel, and\r\nAnna and could count on Laura Clay's \"level head and good common\r\nsense.\"[433] She never felt sure of Alice Stone Blackwell and knew\r\nthere was great sympathy and often a working alliance between her, her\r\nfather, and Mrs. Catt. Of the latest member of the official family,\r\nCatharine Waugh McCulloch, she had little first-hand knowledge. Mrs.\r\nCatt, whom she longed to fathom and trust, was still an enigma. During\r\nthose hot humid August days, misunderstandings were healed, unity was\r\nrestored, and Susan was reassured that not a single one of her \"girls\"\r\ndesired \"other than was good for the work.\"[434]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSusan had always been a champion of coeducation, speaking for it as\r\nearly as the 1850s at state teachers' meetings and proposing it for\r\nColumbia University in her _Revolution_. In 1891, she and Mrs. Stanton\r\nhad agitated for the admission of women to the University of\r\nRochester. Seven years later the trustees consented to admit women\r\nprovided $100,000 could be raised in a year, and Susan served on the\r\nfund-raising committee with her friend, Helen Barrett Montgomery.\r\nBecause the alumni of the University of Rochester opposed coeducation\r\nand the city's wealthiest men were indifferent, progress was slow, but\r\nthe trustees were persuaded to extend the time and to reduce by one\r\nhalf the amount to be raised.\r\n\r\nWith so much else on her mind in 1900, including the sudden death of\r\nher brother Merritt, she had given the fund little thought until the\r\ncommittee appealed to her in desperation when only one day remained in\r\nwhich to raise the last $8,000. Immediately she went into action.\r\nRemembering that Mary had talked of willing the University $2,000 if\r\nit became coeducational, she persuaded her to pledge that amount now.\r\nThen setting out in a carriage on a very hot September morning, she\r\nslowly collected pledges for all but $2,000. As the trustees were in\r\nsession and likely to adjourn any minute, she appealed to Samuel\r\nWilder, one of Rochester's prominent elder citizens who had already\r\ncontributed, to guarantee that amount until she could raise it. To\r\nthis he gladly agreed. Reaching the trustees' meeting with Mrs.\r\nMontgomery just in time, with pledges assuring the payment of the full\r\n$50,000, she was amazed at their reception. Instead of rejoicing with\r\nthem, the trustees began to quibble over Samuel Wilder's guarantee of\r\nthe last $2,000 because of the state of his health. When she offered\r\nher life insurance as security, they still put her off, telling her\r\nto come back in a few days. Even then they continued to quibble, but\r\nfinally admitted that the women had won. Disillusioned, she wrote in\r\nher diary, \"Not a trustee has given anything although there are\r\nseveral millionaires among them.\"[435] Only her life insurance policy\r\nand her dogged persistence had saved the day.\r\n\r\nThis effort to open Rochester University to women, on top of a very\r\nfull and worrisome year, was so taxing and so disillusioning that she\r\nbecame seriously ill. When she recovered sufficiently for a drive, she\r\nasked to be taken to the university campus and afterward wrote in her\r\ndiary, \"As I drove over the campus, I felt 'these are not forbidden\r\ngrounds to the girls of the city any longer.' It is good to feel that\r\nthe old doors sway on their hinges--to women! Will the vows be kept to\r\nthem--will the girls have equal chances with the boys? They promised\r\nwell--the fulfilment will be seen--whether there shall not be some\r\nhitch from the proposed to a separate school.\"[436]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStill keeping her watchful eye on the National American Association,\r\nSusan traveled to Minneapolis in the spring of 1901 for the first\r\nannual convention under the new administration. There was talk of an\r\n\"entire new deal,\" the retirement of all who had served under Miss\r\nAnthony, and the election of a \"new cabinet of officers,\" and Susan\r\nwas so concerned that there might also be a change in the presidency\r\nthat she felt she must be on hand to guide and steady the\r\nproceedings.[437]\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt was re-elected and Susan returned to Rochester well\r\nsatisfied and ready to devote herself to completing the fourth volume\r\nof the _History of Woman Suffrage_ on which she and Mrs. Harper had\r\nbeen working intermittently for the past year. It was published late\r\nin 1902. While working on the History, Susan, although more than\r\nsatisfied with Mrs. Harper's work, often thought nostalgically of her\r\nhappy stimulating years of collaboration with Mrs. Stanton. She seldom\r\nsaw Mrs. Stanton now, but they kept in touch with each other by\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1902, she visited Mrs. Stanton twice in New York, and\r\nplanned to return in November to celebrate Mrs. Stanton's\r\neighty-seventh birthday. In anticipation, she wrote Mrs. Stanton, \"It\r\nis fifty-one years since we first met and we have been busy through\r\nevery one of them, stirring up the world to recognize the rights of\r\nwomen.... We little dreamed when we began this contest ... that half a\r\ncentury later we would be compelled to leave the finish of the battle\r\nto another generation of women. But our hearts are filled with joy to\r\nknow that they enter upon this task equipped with a college education,\r\nwith business experience, with the freely admitted right to speak in\r\npublic--all of which were denied to women fifty years ago.... These\r\nstrong, courageous, capable, young women will take our place and\r\ncomplete our work. There is an army of them where we were but a\r\nhandful....\"[438]\r\n\r\nTwo weeks before Mrs. Stanton's birthday, Susan was stunned by a\r\ntelegram announcing that her old comrade had passed away in her chair.\r\nBewildered and desolate, she sat alone in her study for several hours,\r\ntrying bravely to endure her grief. Then came the reporters for copy\r\nwhich only this heartbroken woman could give. \"I cannot express myself\r\nat all as I feel,\" she haltingly told them. \"I am too crushed to\r\nspeak. If I had died first, she would have found beautiful phrases to\r\ndescribe our friendship, but I cannot put it into words.\"[439]\r\n\r\nFrom New York, where she had gone for the funeral, she wrote in\r\nanguish to Mrs. Harper, \"Oh, the voice is stilled which I have loved\r\nto hear for fifty years. Always I have felt that I must have Mrs.\r\nStanton's opinion of things before I knew where I stood myself. I am\r\nall at sea--but the Laws of Nature are still going on--with no shadow\r\nor turning--what a wonder it is--it goes right on and on--no matter\r\nwho lives or who dies.\"[440]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNational woman suffrage conventions were still red-letter events to\r\nSusan and she attended them no matter how great the physical effort,\r\ntraveling to New Orleans in 1903. Of particular concern was the 1904\r\nconvention because of Mrs. Catt's decision at the very last moment not\r\nto stand for re-election on account of her health. Looking over the\r\nfield, Susan saw no one capable of taking her place but Anna Howard\r\nShaw. Not to be able to turn to Mrs. Stanton's capable daughter,\r\nHarriot Stanton Blatch, at this time was disappointing, but Harriot's\r\nlong absence in England had made her more or less of a stranger to the\r\nmembership of the National American Association, and for some reason\r\nshe did not seem to fit in, lacking her mother's warmth and\r\nappeal.[441]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quotation in the handwriting of Susan B. Anthony]\r\n\r\n\"I don't see anybody in the whole rank of our suffrage movement to\r\ntake her [Mrs. Catt's] place but you,\" Susan now wrote Anna Howard\r\nShaw. \"If you will take it with a salary of say, $2,000, I will go\r\nahead and try to see what I can do. We must not let the society down\r\ninto _feeble_ hands.... Don't say _no_, for the _life_ of _you_, for\r\nif Mrs. Catt _persists_ in going out, we shall simply _have_ to\r\n_accept it_ and we must _tide over_ with the _best material_ that we\r\nhave, and _you are the best_, and would you have taken office _four\r\nyears ago_, you would have been elected over-whelmingly.\"[442]\r\n\r\nAnna could not refuse Aunt Susan, and when she was elected with Mrs.\r\nCatt as vice-president, Susan breathed freely again.\r\n\r\nIt warmed Susan's heart to enter the convention on her eighty-fourth\r\nbirthday to a thundering welcome, to banter with Mrs. Upton who called\r\nher to the platform, and to stop the applause with a smile and \"There\r\nnow, girls, that's enough.\"[443] Nothing could have been more\r\nappropriate for her birthday than the Colorado jubilee over which she\r\npresided and which gave irrefutable evidence of the success of woman\r\nsuffrage in that state. There was rejoicing too over Australia, where\r\nwomen had been voting since 1902 and over the new hope in Europe, in\r\nDenmark, where women had chosen her birthday to stage a demonstration\r\nin favor of the pending franchise bill.\r\n\r\nFor the last time, she spoke to a Senate committee on the woman\r\nsuffrage amendment. Standing before these indifferent men, a tired\r\nwarrior at the end of a long hard campaign, she reminded them that she\r\nalone remained of those who thirty-five years before, in 1869, had\r\nappealed to Congress for justice. \"And I,\" she added, \"shall not be\r\nable to come much longer.\r\n\r\n\"We have waited,\" she told them. \"We stood aside for the Negro; we\r\nwaited for the millions of immigrants; now we must wait till the\r\nHawaiians, the Filipinos, and the Puerto Ricans are enfranchised; then\r\nno doubt the Cubans will have their turn. For all these ignorant,\r\nalien peoples, educated women have been compelled to stand aside and\r\nwait!\" Then with mounting impatience, she asked them, \"How long will\r\nthis injustice, this outrage continue?\"[444]\r\n\r\nTheir answer to her was silence. They sent no report to the Senate on\r\nthe woman suffrage amendment. Yet she was able to say to a reporter of\r\nthe New York _Sun_, \"I have never lost my faith, not for a moment in\r\nfifty years.\"[445]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[422] Rachel Foster Avery, Ed., _National Council of Women_, 1891\r\n(Philadelphia, 1891), p. 229.\r\n\r\n[423] Dec. 1, 1898, Anthony Collection, Henry E.

ANTHONY OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan was on the ocean in May 1904 with her sister Mary and a group of\r\ngood friends, headed for a meeting of the International Council of\r\nWomen in Berlin. What drew her to Berlin was the plan initiated by\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt to form an International Woman Suffrage Alliance\r\nprior to the meetings of the International Council. This had been\r\nSusan's dream and Mrs. Stanton's in 1883, when they first conferred\r\nwith women of other countries regarding an international woman\r\nsuffrage organization and found only the women of England ready to\r\nunite on such a radical program. Now that women had worked together\r\nsuccessfully in the International Council for sixteen years on other\r\nless controversial matters relating to women, she and Mrs. Catt were\r\nconfident that a few of them at least were willing to unite to demand\r\nthe vote.\r\n\r\nChosen as a matter of course to preside over this gathering of\r\nsuffragists in Berlin, Susan received an enthusiastic welcome. For her\r\nit was a momentous occasion, and eager to spread news of the meeting\r\nfar and wide, she could not understand the objections of many of the\r\ndelegates to the presence of reporters who they feared might send out\r\nsensational copy.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, what are we here for?\" she asked her more timid\r\ncolleagues. \"We have come from many countries, travelled thousands of\r\nmiles to form an organization for a great international work, and do\r\nwe want to keep it a secret from the public? No; welcome all reporters\r\nwho want to come, the more, the better. Let all we say and do here be\r\ntold far and wide. Let the people everywhere know that in Berlin women\r\nfrom all parts of the world have banded themselves together to demand\r\npolitical freedom. I rejoice in the presence of these reporters, and\r\ninstead of excluding them from our meetings let us help them to all\r\nthe information we can and ask them to give it the widest\r\npublicity.\"[446]\r\n\r\nThis won the battle for the reporters, who gave her rousing applause,\r\nand the news flashed over the wires was sympathetic, dignified, and\r\nabundant. It told the world of the formation of the International\r\nWoman Suffrage Alliance by women from the United States, Great\r\nBritain, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, Norway, and\r\nDenmark, \"to secure the enfranchisement of women of all nations.\" It\r\npraised the honorary president, Susan B. Anthony, and the American\r\nwomen who took over the leadership of this international venture,\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, the president, and Rachel Foster Avery,\r\ncorresponding secretary.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the occasion, German suffragists called a public mass\r\nmeeting, and Susan, eager to rejoice with them, was surprised to find\r\nmembers of the International Council disgruntled and accusing the\r\nInternational Woman Suffrage Alliance of stealing their thunder and\r\ncasting the dark shadow of woman suffrage over their conference. To\r\nplacate them and restore harmony, she stayed away from this public\r\nmeeting, but she could not control the demand for her presence.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Susan B. Anthony?\" were the first words spoken as the mass\r\nmeeting opened. Then immediately the audience rose and burst into\r\ncheers which continued without a break for ten minutes. Anna Howard\r\nShaw there on the platform and deeply moved by this tribute to Aunt\r\nSusan, later described how she felt: \"Every second of that time I\r\nseemed to see Miss Anthony alone in her hotel room, longing with all\r\nher big heart to be with us, as we longed to have her.... Afterwards,\r\nwhen we burst in upon her and told her of the great demonstration, the\r\nmere mention of her name had caused, her lips quivered and her brave\r\nold eyes filled with tears.\"[447]\r\n\r\nThe next morning her \"girls\" brought her the Berlin newspapers,\r\ntranslating for her the report of the meeting and these heart-warming\r\nlines, \"The Americans call her 'Aunt Susan.' She is our 'Aunt Susan'\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nThis was but a foretaste of her reception throughout her stay in\r\nBerlin. To the International Council, she was \"Susan B. Anthony of the\r\nWorld,\" the woman of the hour, whom all wanted to meet. Every time she\r\nentered the conference hall, the audience rose and remained standing\r\nuntil she was seated. Every mention of her name brought forth cheers.\r\nThe many young women, acting as ushers, were devoted to her and eager\r\nto serve her. They greeted her by kissing her hand. Embarrassed at\r\nfirst by such homage, she soon responded by kissing them on the\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony at the age of eighty-five]\r\n\r\nThe Empress Victoria Augusta, receiving the delegates in the Royal\r\nPalace, singled out Susan, and instead of following the custom of\r\nkissing the Empress's hand, Susan bowed as she would to any\r\ndistinguished American, explaining that she was a Quaker and did not\r\nunderstand the etiquette of the court. The Empress praised Susan's\r\ngreat work, and unwilling to let such an opportunity slip by, Susan\r\noffered the suggestion that Emperor William who had done so much to\r\nbuild up his country might now wish to raise the status of German\r\nwomen. To this the Empress replied with a smile, \"The gentlemen are\r\nvery slow to comprehend this great movement.\"[448]\r\n\r\nWhen the talented Negro, Mary Church Terrell, addressing the\r\nInternational Council in both German and French, received an ovation,\r\nSusan's cup of joy was filled to the brim, for she glimpsed the bright\r\npromise of a world without barriers of sex or race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe newspapers welcomed her home, and in her own comfortable sitting\r\nroom she read Rochester's greeting in the _Democrat and Chronicle_,\r\n\"There are woman suffragists and anti-suffragists, but all Rochester\r\npeople, irrespective of opinion ... are Anthony men and women. We\r\nadmire and esteem one so single-minded, earnest and unselfish, who,\r\nwith eighty-four years to her credit, is still too busy and useful to\r\nthink of growing old.\"[449]\r\n\r\nHer happiness over this welcome was clouded, however, by the serious\r\nillness of her brother Daniel, and she and Mary hurried to Kansas to\r\nsee him. Two months later he passed away. Now only she and Mary were\r\nleft of all the large Anthony family. Without Daniel, the world seemed\r\nempty. His strength of character, independence, and sympathy with her\r\nwork had comforted and encouraged her all through her life. A fearless\r\neditor, a successful businessman, a politician with principles, he had\r\nplayed an important role in Kansas, and proud of him, she cherished\r\nthe many tributes published throughout the country.\r\n\r\nCourageously she now picked up the threads of her life. Her precious\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association was out of her hands, but\r\nshe still had the _History of Woman Suffrage_ to distribute, and it\r\ngave her a great sense of accomplishment to hand on to future\r\ngenerations this record of women's struggle for freedom.[450]\r\n\r\nMissing the stimulous of work with her \"girls,\" she took more and more\r\npleasure in the company of William and Mary Gannett of the First\r\nUnitarian Church, whose liberal views appealed to her strongly. She\r\nliked to have young people about her and followed the lives of all her\r\nnieces and nephews with the greatest interest, spurring on their\r\nambitions and helping finance their education. The frequent visits of\r\n\"Niece Lucy\" were a great joy during these years, as was the nearness\r\nof \"Niece Anna O,\"[451] who married and settled in Rochester. The\r\nyoung Canadian girl, Anna Dann, had become almost indispensable to her\r\nand to Mary, as companion, secretary, and nurse, and her marriage left\r\na void in the household. Anna Dann was married at 17 Madison Street by\r\nAnna Howard Shaw with Susan beaming upon her like a proud grandmother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLonging to see one more state won for suffrage, Susan carefully\r\nfollowed the news from the field, looking hopefully to California and\r\nurging her \"girls\" to keep hammering away there in spite of defeats.\r\nHer eyes were also on the Territory of Oklahoma, where a constitution\r\nwas being drafted preparatory to statehood. \"The present bill for the\r\nnew state,\" she wrote Anna Howard Shaw, in December 1904, \"is an\r\ninsult to women of Oklahoma, such as has never been perpetrated\r\nbefore. We have always known that women were in reality ranked with\r\nidiots and criminals, but it has never been said in words that the\r\nstate should ... restrict or abridge the suffrage ... on account of\r\nilliteracy, minority, _sex_, conviction of felony, mental condition,\r\netc.... We must fight this bill to the utmost....\"[452]\r\n\r\nThe brightest spot in the West was Oregon, where suffrage had been\r\ndefeated in 1900 by only 2,000 votes. In June 1905, when the National\r\nAmerican Association held its first far western convention in Portland\r\nduring the Lewis and Clark Exposition, Susan could not keep away,\r\nalthough she had never expected to go over the mountains again. As she\r\ntraveled to Portland with Mary and a hundred or more delegates in\r\nspecial cars, she recalled her many long tiring trips through the West\r\nto carry the message of woman suffrage to the frontier. In\r\ncomparison, this was a triumphal journey, showing her, as nothing else\r\ncould, what her work had accomplished. Greeted at railroad stations\r\nalong the way by enthusiastic crowds, showered with flowers and gifts,\r\nshe stood on the back platform of the train with her \"girls,\" shaking\r\nhands, waving her handkerchief, and making an occasional speech.\r\n\r\nPresiding over the opening session of the Portland convention,\r\nstanding in a veritable garden of flowers which had been presented to\r\nher, she remarked with a droll smile, \"This is rather different from\r\nthe receptions I used to get fifty years ago.... I am thankful for\r\nthis change of spirit which has come over the American people.\"[453]\r\n\r\nOn Woman's Day, she was chosen to speak at the unveiling of the statue\r\nof Sacajawea, the Indian woman who had led Lewis and Clark through the\r\ndangerous mountain passes to the Pacific, winning their gratitude and\r\ntheir praise. In the story of Sacajawea who had been overlooked by the\r\ngovernment when every man in the Lewis and Clark expedition had been\r\nrewarded with a large tract of land, Susan saw the perfect example of\r\nman's thoughtless oversight of the valuable services of women. Looking\r\nup at the bronze statue of the Indian woman, her papoose on her back\r\nand her arm outstretched to the Pacific, Susan said simply, \"This is\r\nthe first statue erected to a woman because of deeds of daring....\r\nThis recognition of the assistance rendered by a woman in the\r\ndiscovery of this great section of the country is but the beginning of\r\nwhat is due.\" Then, with the sunlight playing on her hair and lighting\r\nup her face, she appealed to the men of Oregon for the vote. \"Next\r\nyear,\" she reminded them, \"the men of this proud state, made possible\r\nby a woman, will decide whether women shall at last have the rights in\r\nit which have been denied them so many years. Let men remember the\r\npart women have played in its settlement and progress and vote to give\r\nthem these rights which belong to every citizen.\"[454]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReporters were at Susan's door, when she returned to Rochester, for\r\ncomments on ex-President Cleveland's tirade against clubwomen and\r\nwoman suffrage in the popular _Ladies' Home Journal_. \"Pure\r\nfol-de-rol,\" she told them, adding testily, \"I would think that Grover\r\nCleveland was about the last person to talk about the sanctity of the\r\nhome and woman's sphere.\" This was good copy for Republican newspapers\r\nand they made the most of it, as women throughout the country added\r\ntheir protests to Susan's. A popular jingle of the day ran, \"Susan B.\r\nAnthony, she took quite a fall out of Grover C.\"[455]\r\n\r\nSusan, however, had something far more important on her mind than\r\nfencing with Grover Cleveland--an interview with President Theodore\r\nRoosevelt. Here was a man eager to right wrongs, to break monopolies,\r\nto see justice done to the Negro, a man who talked of a \"square deal\"\r\nfor all, and yet woman suffrage aroused no response in him.\r\n\r\nIn November 1905, she undertook a trip to Washington for the express\r\npurpose of talking with him. The year before, at a White House\r\nreception, he had singled her out to stand at his side in the\r\nreceiving line. She looked for the same friendliness now. Memorandum\r\nin hand, she plied him with questions which he carefully evaded, but\r\nshe would not give up.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Roosevelt,\" she earnestly pleaded, \"this is my principle request.\r\nIt is almost the last request I shall ever make of anybody. Before you\r\nleave the Presidential chair recommend to Congress to submit to the\r\nLegislatures a Constitutional Amendment which will enfranchise women,\r\nand thus take your place in history with Lincoln, the great\r\nemancipator. I beg of you not to close your term of office without\r\ndoing this.\"[456]\r\n\r\nTo this he made no response, and trying once more to wring from him\r\nsome slight indication of sympathy for her cause, she added, \"Mr.\r\nPresident, your influence is so great that just one word from you in\r\nfavor of woman suffrage would give our cause a tremendous impetus.\"\r\n\r\n\"The public knows my attitude,\" he tersely replied. \"I recommended it\r\nwhen Governor of New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" she acknowledged, \"but that was a long time ago. Our enemies\r\nsay that was the opinion of your younger years and that since you have\r\nbeen President you have never uttered one word that could be construed\r\nas an endorsement.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have no cause to think I have changed my mind,\" he suavely\r\nreplied as he bade her good-bye. In the months that followed he gave\r\nher no sign that her interview had made the slightest impression.\r\n\r\nOne of the most satisfying honors bestowed on Susan during these last\r\nyears was the invitation to be present at Bryn Mawr College in 1902\r\nfor the unveiling of a bronze portrait medallion of herself. Bryn\r\nMawr, under its brilliant young president, M. Carey Thomas, herself a\r\npioneer in establishing the highest standards for women's education,\r\nshowed no such timidity as Vassar where neither Susan nor Elizabeth\r\nCady Stanton had been welcome as speakers. At Bryn Mawr, Susan talked\r\nfreely and frankly with the students, and best of all, became better\r\nacquainted with M. Carey Thomas and her enterprising friend, Mary\r\nGarrett of Baltimore, who was using her great wealth for the\r\nadvancement of women. She longed to channel their abilities to woman\r\nsuffrage and a few years later arranged for a national convention in\r\ntheir home city, Baltimore, appealing to them to make it an\r\noutstanding success.[457]\r\n\r\nArriving in Baltimore in January 1906 for this convention, Susan was\r\nthe honored guest in Mary Garrett's luxurious home. Frail and ill, she\r\nwas unable to attend all the sessions, as in the past, but she was\r\npresent at the highlight of this very successful convention, the\r\nCollege Evening arranged by M. Carey Thomas. With women's colleges\r\nstill resisting the discussion of woman suffrage and the Association\r\nof Collegiate Alumnae refusing to support it, the College Evening\r\nmarked the first public endorsement of this controversial subject by\r\ncollege women. Up to this time the only encouraging sign had been the\r\nformation in 1900 of the College Equal Suffrage League by two young\r\nRadcliffe alumnae, Maud Wood Park and Inez Haynes Irwin. Now here, in\r\nconservative Baltimore, college presidents and college faculty gave\r\nwoman suffrage their blessing, and Susan listened happily as\r\ndistinguished women, one after another, allied themselves to the\r\ncause: Dr. Mary E. Woolley, who as president of Mt. Holyoke was\r\ndeveloping Mary Lyons' pioneer seminary into a high ranking college;\r\nLucy Salmon, Mary A. Jordan, and Mary W. Calkins of the faculties of\r\nVassar, Smith, and Wellesley; Eva Perry Moore, a trustee of Vassar and\r\npresident of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, with whom she\r\ndared differ on this subject; Maud Wood Park, representing the younger\r\ngeneration in the College Equal Suffrage League; and last of all, the\r\npresident of Bryn Mawr, M. Carey Thomas. After expressing her\r\ngratitude to the pioneers of this great movement, Miss Thomas turned\r\nto Susan and said, \"To you, Miss Anthony, belongs by right, as to no\r\nother woman in the world's history, the love and gratitude of all\r\nwomen in every country of the civilized globe. We your daughters in\r\nspirit, rise up today and call you blessed.... Of such as you were the\r\nlines of the poet Yeats written:\r\n\r\n    'They shall be remembered forever,\r\n    They shall be alive forever,\r\n    They shall be speaking forever,\r\n    The people shall hear them forever.'\"[458]\r\n\r\nDuring the thundering applause, Susan came forward to respond, her\r\nface alight, and the audience rose. \"If any proof were needed of the\r\nprogress of the cause for which I have worked, it is here tonight,\"\r\nshe said simply. \"The presence on the stage of these college women,\r\nand in the audience of all those college girls who will someday be the\r\nnation's greatest strength, tell their story to the world. They give\r\nthe highest joy and encouragement to me....\"[459]\r\n\r\nDuring her visit at the home of Mary Garrett, Susan spoke freely with\r\nher and with M. Carey Thomas of the needs of the National American\r\nAssociation, particularly of the Standing Fund of $100,000 of which\r\nshe had dreamed and which she had started to raise. Now, like an\r\nanswer to prayer, Mary Garrett and President Thomas, fresh from their\r\nsuccessful money-raising campaigns for Johns Hopkins and Bryn Mawr,\r\noffered to undertake a similar project for woman suffrage, proposing\r\nto raise $60,000--$12,000 a year for the next five years.\r\n\r\n\"As we sat at her feet day after day between sessions of the\r\nconvention, listening to what she wanted us to do to help women and\r\nasking her questions,\" recalled M. Carey Thomas in later years, \"I\r\nrealized that she was the greatest person I had ever met. She seemed\r\nto me everything that a human being could be--a leader to die for or\r\nto live for and follow wherever she led.\"[460]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the convention, Susan went to Washington with the\r\nwomen who were scheduled to speak at the Congressional hearing on\r\nwoman suffrage. In her room at the Shoreham Hotel, a room with a view\r\nof the Washington Monument which the manager always saved for her, she\r\nstood at the window looking out over the city as if saying farewell.\r\nThen turning to Anna Shaw, she said with emotion, \"I think it is the\r\nmost beautiful monument in the whole world.\"[461]\r\n\r\nThat evening she sat quietly through the many tributes offered to her\r\non her eighty-sixth birthday, longing to tell all her friends the\r\ngratitude and hope that welled up in her heart. Finally she rose, and\r\nstanding by Anna Howard Shaw who was presiding, she impulsively put\r\nher hand on her shoulder and praised her for her loyal support. Then\r\nturning to the other officers, she thanked them for all they had done.\r\n\"There are others also,\" she added, \"just as true and devoted to the\r\ncause--I wish I could name everyone--but with such women consecrating\r\ntheir lives--\" She hesitated a moment, and then in her clear rich\r\nvoice, added with emphasis, \"Failure is impossible.\"[462]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Rochester, in the home she so dearly loved, she spent her last\r\nweeks, thinking of the cause and the women who would carry it on.\r\nLonging to talk with Anna Shaw, she sent for her, but Anna, feeling\r\nshe was needed, came even before a letter could reach her. With Anna\r\nat her bedside, Susan was content.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to give me a promise,\" she pleaded, reaching for Anna's\r\nhand. \"Promise me you will keep the presidency of the association as\r\nlong as you are well enough to do the work.\"[463]\r\n\r\nDeeply moved, Anna replied, \"But how can I promise that? I can keep it\r\nonly as long as others wish me to keep it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Promise to make them wish you to keep it,\" Susan urged. \"Just as I\r\nwish you to keep it....\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, she continued, \"I do not know anything about what\r\ncomes to us after this life ends, but ... if I have any conscious\r\nknowledge of this world and of what you are doing, I shall not be far\r\naway from you; and in times of need I will help you all I can. Who\r\nknows? Perhaps I may be able to do more for the Cause after I am gone\r\nthan while I am here.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later, on March 13, 1906, she passed away, her hand in\r\nAnna's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAsked, a few years before, if she believed that all women in the\r\nUnited States would ever be given the vote, she had replied with\r\nassurance, \"It will come, but I shall not see it.... It is inevitable.\r\nWe can no more deny forever the right of self-government to one-half\r\nour people than we could keep the Negro forever in bondage. It will\r\nnot be wrought by the same disrupting forces that freed the slave, but\r\ncome it will, and I believe within a generation.\"[464]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony, 1905]\r\n\r\nShe had so longed to see women voting throughout the United States, to\r\nsee them elected to legislatures and Congress, but for her there had\r\nonly been the promise of fulfillment in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and\r\nIdaho, and far away in New Zealand and Australia.\r\n\r\n\"Failure is impossible\" was the rallying cry she left with her \"girls\"\r\nto spur them on in the long discouraging struggle ahead, fourteen more\r\nyears of campaigning until on August 26, 1920, women were enfranchised\r\nthroughout the United States by the Nineteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nEven then their work was not finished, for she had looked farther\r\nahead to the time when men and women everywhere, regardless of race,\r\nreligion, or sex, would enjoy equal rights. Her challenging words,\r\n\"Failure is impossible,\" still echo and re-echo through the years, as\r\nthe crusade for human rights goes forward and men and women together\r\nstrive to build and preserve a free world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[446] Harper, _Anthony_, III, p. 1325.\r\n\r\n[447] Shaw, _The Story of a Pioneer_, p. 210.\r\n\r\n[448] Harper, _Anthony_, III, p. 1319.\r\n\r\n[449] _Ibid._, p. 1336.\r\n\r\n[450] Miss Anthony also carefully prepared her scrapbooks, her books,\r\nand bound volumes of _The Revolution_, woman's rights and antislavery\r\nmagazines for presentation to the Library of Congress, inscribing each\r\nwith a note of explanation.\r\n\r\n[451] Ann Anthony Bacon.\r\n\r\n[452] _New York Suffrage Newsletter_, Jan., 1905.\r\n\r\n[453] _History of Woman Suffrage_, V, p. 122.\r\n\r\n[454] Harper, _Anthony_, III, p. 1365.
