The old process of sailing-ships, and a monthly\r\nsailing-packet from Falmouth, conveying mails, were the only medium of\r\ncommunication. In that year, the Royal Mail Company entered upon the\r\nservice they had undertaken with government, to run a monthly steamer\r\nfrom Southampton to Rio Janeiro, and a branch steamer to the River\r\nPlate. The vessels placed on the station were drafted from their West\r\nIndia fleet; and, although not possessed of extraordinary steaming or\r\nsailing qualities, they performed the voyage with regularity, and in a\r\nspace of time which reduced to one half that ordinarily occupied by the\r\nsailing-craft. The consequence was an augmentation of traffic, both of\r\ngoods and passengers, such as few persons contemplated, and the line\r\nproved speedily unequal to the task of dealing with either to the extent\r\nrequired. Moreover, it was found that one very important feature in the\r\ncase, a direct traffic with the River Plate, was quite unprovided for,\r\nand no provision whatever made by which goods and merchandize could\r\nbe forwarded thither, the branch steamer from Rio Janeiro only taking\r\npassengers. But, even had mercantile necessities in this direction been\r\nsupplied, there was a strong feeling that Liverpool, as the emporium\r\nof British trade with South America, ought to possess a steam-line of\r\nits own, and that goods and passengers should not be compelled to find\r\ntheir way to Southampton. The great manufacturing districts which have\r\nLiverpool for their seaport supply at least seven-eighths of the entire\r\ntrade to South America,[1] and it seemed an anomaly that no direct steam\r\ncommunication should exist between them. Accordingly, in 1851, parties\r\nconnected with the district, having organized a company, went before\r\nthe Board of Trade for a royal charter, alleging, as a reason for such\r\nconcession, the importance of our interests in the quarter named, the\r\nnecessity of more frequent intercourse since steam had been established,\r\nand that once a month was not sufficient for wants so extensive and\r\npressing. These arguments, backed, as they were, by memorials from\r\nLiverpool, Manchester, and other places, had weight with Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment, and a charter of incorporation was obtained. The directors\r\nimmediately proceeded to contract for the building of suitable steamers;\r\nbut delay, caused by unusual pressure of work, somewhat retarded intended\r\noperations.[2]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of August, 1853, the company’s first, or pioneer, steamer\r\nintended for the River Plate station, sailed from Liverpool, and was\r\nfollowed on the 24th of September by the ocean steamer, Brazileira,\r\nCaptain Daniel Green, who had long commanded clipper vessels in the\r\nBrazil trade. As secretary to the company, and possessing a local\r\nknowledge of Brazil, it was thought desirable that the author should\r\nproceed in the Argentina, for the purpose of seeing that proper\r\narrangements were made at the ports of call for their vessels, and to\r\nobtain from foreign governments the facilities and assistance requisite\r\nto carry on a steam company of this magnitude with any success. The\r\nvoyage was accomplished in a little more than three months, the writer\r\nhaving returned to Liverpool, by the Brazileira, on the 5th of November,\r\nduring which time he had gone over nearly 15,000 miles of distance\r\n(including a trip up the Parana), spent a fortnight at Rio Janeiro, and\r\nthree weeks in the River Plate, besides calling at all the stations\r\nboth ways, namely, outwards—Lisbon, Madeira, St. Vincent, Pernambuco,\r\nand Bahia; and, homewards—Bahia, Pernambuco, St. Vincent, and Lisbon,\r\nwhich latter is to be the track of the regular ocean line, subject to\r\nmodifications, &c.\r\n\r\nThus, it will be seen, from this brief recapitulation of dates and\r\ndistances, that in the space of two months a merchant can visit his\r\nBrazil establishment, and another, under three months, can look after\r\nhis River Plate affairs, often saving himself much anxiety and loss\r\nof time. The manufacturer can, without great trouble, make himself\r\npractically acquainted with the markets he wishes to trade to; the\r\nbotanist and naturalist can quickly be transported to the virgin\r\nground of Paraguay, or, now that the Brazilian government have placed\r\ncontract steamers on the greatest of all great rivers, may ascend the\r\nAmazon, with like certainty of reward as novel and varied, and depend\r\non a prompt return of his newly acquired specimens. Whilst, which is\r\nequally important, the natives of those countries have an opportunity\r\nof visiting Europe, and forming, by personal contact, those relations of\r\namity and good will which tend so much to soften prejudices, and bring\r\nabout a right understanding on all points mutually advantageous. Hence\r\nthe ramifications of such enterprises as steam are most interesting in\r\ntheir results to mankind; and, if once the tide of emigration begins to\r\nset in fairly towards that immense agricultural field watered by the\r\nrivers of South America, there is no foreseeing the extension of wealth\r\nand prosperity that must assuredly follow; for population is the sole\r\nrequirement to fit these limitless and teeming regions to work out the\r\ndestiny which it is impossible to doubt that Providence, in the fulness\r\nof time, has designed for that portion of the earth, where the majesty\r\nand the luxuriance of nature invite the presence of man through highways\r\nat once the mightiest and most facile in the world.\r\n\r\nA desire to place these objects forcibly before the public is the origin\r\nof this work. Though conscious of its imperfections and short-comings,\r\nthe writer would guard against the imputation of impertinence in offering\r\nit as the result merely of the experience derived from the rapid run out\r\nand home indicated in the remarks just preceding. He is no book-maker;\r\nthough he ventures to hope that his book will, in some degree, fill a\r\nvacuum left by certain recent accomplished professors of that branch\r\nof the fine arts in this department of travellers’ information for\r\nthe untravelled public. The several topics discussed in the ensuing\r\npages have been the subject-matter of his earnest consideration for\r\nmany years. Long resident in South America, and familiar with its\r\ncommercial necessities, his attention had naturally been directed to\r\nall the mercantile points embraced in the old circle of communication\r\nwith Europe; while the circumstances of his position, in connection\r\nwith a new enterprise, enabled him to contemplate matters in a somewhat\r\nnovel light; and he was peculiarly fortunate in deriving his knowledge\r\nof the recent interesting diplomatic and commercial incidents in the\r\nUpper Parana and the Paraguay on the spot, and from the most competent\r\nsources. Assiduously availing of these and all others of a like kind\r\nwhenever they presented themselves,—which was not unfrequently—he\r\nhas, wherever practicable, rendered the expression of his own remarks\r\nsubordinate to the main design of bringing together whatever data should\r\nserve to make his volume useful as an exposition, at one view, of the\r\npresent condition, primarily, of the East Coast and the Amazon and\r\nPlatine interior, and, incidentally, of South America generally—an object\r\nembraced in no other single publication of this class. He is well aware\r\nthat a complete embodiment of such a design would tax powers far higher\r\nand opportunities more varied than his. But he will be content, if, in\r\nsucceeding a little, he should be the means of stimulating others to\r\nachieve a great deal more in a like direction.\r\n\r\nThough necessarily containing little that is new, the _resumé_ of\r\ndiscoveries, prefixed to the opening chapter, is offered as likely to be\r\nserviceable in recalling to the elder reader some of the more salient\r\nfacts he already knows, but which are necessary to be repeated: and\r\nin suggesting to the younger student of South American history,—than\r\nwhich it is hardly possible to name any more exciting, delightful, or\r\ninstructive,—those sources that will render him easily cognizant of\r\nwhat has been written on the several branches of the subject up to the\r\npresent date. A similar justification, it is hoped, will serve for the\r\nseeming surplusage of the remarks under the head of Lisbon, Madeira, and\r\nthe Verds; though it will be found that the chapters devoted to those\r\nwell-known places contain a good deal of fresh information calculated to\r\nbe acceptable too all calling at the several ports.\r\n\r\nOften observing the inconvenience experienced by South Americans\r\ncoming to England, and by Englishmen proceeding to South America, from\r\nunacquaintance with the names and residences of the respective diplomatic\r\nand consular agents in both countries, the author has been at some pains\r\nto collect the necessary information on this head; and, as regards the\r\nantecedents of the English officials, has relied upon that very useful\r\nmanual, the ‘Foreign Office List for 1854,’ by Mr. F. W. H. Cavendish,\r\n_Précis_ Writer to the Earl of Clarendon. The large map of South America\r\nhas been expressly prepared for this volume, chiefly with a view to\r\nexhibit the river navigation affected by the late treaties, and will be\r\nfound, I have every reason to believe, much the most correct that has yet\r\nbeen published of the whole continent; for, generally speaking, maps of\r\nSouth America, or of any portion of it, are ludicrously inaccurate. The\r\nmap of the growingly important settlement of the Falkland Islands has\r\nlikewise been adapted from the most recent surveys, and is calculated to\r\nprove of benefit to captains making the homeward Australian voyage by\r\nCape Horn.\r\n\r\n    Claughton, Birkenhead,\r\n      March 30, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n    Cursory Retrospect of South American Discoveries.—Their\r\n    difficulties then, how to be estimated at present.—Their\r\n    interest to this age as compared with ancient\r\n    conquests.—Cruelties of the early invaders.—Retributive\r\n    visitations.—Columbus and his cotemporaries.—Cortez and the\r\n    conquest of Mexico.—Subsequent position of the country.—Santa\r\n    Anna, his antecedents and prospects.—Pizarro in Peru, and his\r\n    Lieutenant, Almagro, in Chili.—Condition of those Republics\r\n    since and now: their past gold and present guano.—Modern\r\n    commanders in those countries.—Predominance of the Irish\r\n    element in the fray.—The O’Learys and O’Higginses in the\r\n    Andes.—San Martin and his aid-de-camp, O’Brien, and _his_\r\n    auxiliary, M’Cabe.—The Portuguese discoverers.—Magellan and his\r\n    Straits, and Peacock’s steaming to the Pacific three hundred\r\n    years afterwards.—Cabra, and Brazil.—De Gama and the Cape, and\r\n    Camoens’ celebration of the achievement.—Enrichment of the\r\n    Iberian Peninsula from these causes—Subsequent impoverishment\r\n    of mother countries and colonies.—Exceptional position of\r\n    Brazil in this respect, and reason thereof.—Different results\r\n    in North America, and why.—Imperfect knowledge in Europe of\r\n    South America.—Works thereon.—Characteristics of the several\r\n    authorities: Prescott, Southey, Koster, Gardner, Humboldt,\r\n    Dr. Dundas, Woodbine Parish, M’Cann, Edwards, Maury, and\r\n    others.—Want of information still on Paraguay and the region of\r\n    the Amazon.—Object of this Volume to supply that void.—Aim of\r\n    the Author not Political, but Commercial.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly four centuries have rolled past since the great discoveries of\r\nColumbus and his followers led to the establishment of Spanish and\r\nPortuguese dominion over the vast continent of South America, and were\r\nsucceeded somewhat later by the still more important settlement of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race on the northern portion of the New World.[3] These\r\nevents, marvellous in themselves and in their accessories, and momentous\r\nfrom the way in which they have affected the destinies of the human\r\nrace, present a study singularly and enduringly interesting, differing\r\nso strongly as they do from the characteristics of ancient history. The\r\nlatter are necessarily contemplated by the reader as types and symbols\r\nof the past, on which he has only the privilege of reflecting; whilst\r\nin the former case, in perusing the story of these comparatively modern\r\ndiscoveries of hitherto unknown continents, he feels himself almost a\r\nsharer in the adventures of those extraordinary men by whose deeds his\r\nown present destiny is so essentially influenced. He cannot desire to\r\nbe a Lycurgus or a Phocion, a Cæsar or a Cato; but it is no tax on the\r\nimagination, no repulse to the feeling, to picture himself a Columbus\r\nin embryo, and his soul and being is wrapt up in the narrative of that\r\ngreat voyager. The English are proverbially a nautical people, nursed\r\nand cradled in the lap of that ocean with whose element their earliest\r\nsympathies are enlisted and identified. In these days it is a light\r\nmatter indeed, with the facilities of progression abounding on all sides,\r\nand the great ministrant of celerity, steam, at our command in every\r\nform, to ramble from one extremity of the earth to the other; but the\r\nslightest retrospection suffices to demonstrate how very different a\r\nstate of things prevailed at the close of the fifteenth century. The\r\nmere existence of a western continent was a phantasy of dream-land, when\r\nthe mysteries of that mighty waste of waters which separated the then\r\nknown world from all beyond, was shrouded in obscurity as unfathomable\r\nas its deepest depths; when only frail barks and mariners who dreaded to\r\nlose sight of the land could be found to attempt the seemingly-desperate\r\nfate of exploring an unknown sea in search of what at best existed\r\nbut in the imagination of those who were regarded as visionaries, and\r\nwhose presumptuous rashness the very winds themselves seemed to rebuke\r\nby blowing with unprecedented constancy in the one direction, as if to\r\nproclaim the impossibility of return.[4] Taking these circumstances into\r\nour consideration, a most thrilling interest is attached to this recital\r\nthat will endure to the latest posterity; and school-boys for generations\r\nto come will ponder over the amazing achievements of these wondrous\r\nknights-errant of the main with the same eager curiosity as the grown men\r\nof to-day.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be as readily conceded that there is\r\nsomething painfully oppressive in the records of ancient history, with\r\nits never-ending conflict between nations for the aggrandisement of a\r\nfew ambitious monarchs or republican leaders, in which the destruction\r\nof cities, towns, and countries, as well as of the lives of their\r\ninhabitants, is the theme perpetually dwelt upon, as if the annihilation\r\nof his kind were the only achievement entitling man to the admiration of\r\nhumanity. War in all its horrors, and the military extirpation of our\r\nspecies, is the delight of the classic chroniclers, whether in poetry\r\nor prose; and its accompaniments of battles, sieges, pillage, murder,\r\nand atrocities such as nature revolts at, are depicted with a species\r\nof barbaric satisfaction, calculated (as it no doubt often did) to\r\nevoke the vengeance of the Deity against enormities perpetrated in the\r\nmere wantonness of licentious ferocity, and too frequently lacking the\r\nmiserable palliative of provocation. Infinitely is it to be deplored\r\nthat this sanguinary animus was carried, in a large degree, by the\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese, but probably still more by the Dutch (with\r\nwhom, however, we are not now concerned), into their conquests in the\r\nNew World; but it brought with it its own retributive punishment; and\r\nfinally, under Providence, became the most potent instrument that caused\r\nwar to be looked upon as an enormous evil, and a curse upon any country\r\nunrighteously practising it.\r\n\r\nTo the discovery of the New World we may fairly trace the benign\r\neffects of that wholesome correction of a most pernicious estimate of\r\nhuman merit. This, gradually softening the minds of men, instilled the\r\nprinciple of commercial intercourse amongst nations; demonstrating\r\nhow much more conducive to true greatness and human happiness is\r\nthe cultivation of amicable relations than even the most successful\r\naggression and devastation, and the acquisition of wealth by iniquitous\r\nappliances.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1492 that Columbus landed on one of the West India\r\nislands. (See _ante_, page 8.) Subsequently, what is now termed the\r\nSpanish Main was crossed in rapid succession by various Peninsular\r\nadventurers, one and all of whom were distinguished by bravery the\r\nmost exalted and selfishness the most abased, each attribute being\r\ninflamed by a fanaticism that sought to honour God and appease His\r\nanger towards their iniquities, by incredible offences in the name of\r\nreligion against the unoffending aborigines. Preëminent, perhaps, among\r\nthese bold bad captains, on the score of political prescience, military\r\nskill, and administrative civil ability, as well as from the magnitude\r\nof his acquisitions, was Hernan Cortez, who, in 1521, conquered the\r\ntable land of Mexico, its coasts being discovered some three years\r\nbefore.[5] The immensity and enormity of his massacres, and the perfidy\r\nthat distinguished them—the ingenuity of his multitudinous outrages upon\r\nthe Emperor Montezuma and scores of thousands of his subjects—have\r\nrendered his name indelibly detestable, though there were many traits\r\nof true heroism about him, beyond what their biographers have been\r\nable to preserve of his invading cotemporary destroyers on the same\r\nscene. As was the case, too, with so many of them, his fruit in the\r\nend proved but bitterness and ashes; for though the vast enrichment of\r\nthe revenues of Spain, through his means, extorted from an ungrateful\r\nsovereign a marquisate, and the grant of a portion of the territories\r\nhe had conquered, he died at home, the object of courtly suspicion and\r\ndistrust; stung to death by mortification, that all his achievements\r\nhad been productive of coldness and neglect; where he had most expected\r\nto meet with eulogium and honour, he found, like Columbus, (says the\r\neloquent historian of his conquests) that it was possible to deserve too\r\ngreatly.[6]\r\n\r\nPassing next to him before whose golden sun the star of Cortez waned, we\r\nfind that the ruthless valour and iron perseverance of Pizarro subjugated\r\nPeru[7] in 1531; while one of his followers, who most resembled him\r\nin the cruelty of his life, as he did in the untimeliness of his death\r\n(caused by a quarrel with his old master about the spoil), after the\r\nseeming consummation of his ambition—Diego Almagro—having committed\r\nhorrors till then almost unheard of, over-ran Chili[8] in 1535. He\r\nexterminated the family of Atahualpa, the last of the Incas, in a mode\r\nwhich only the most hardened familiars of the Inquisition, in the mother\r\ncountry, could read of without emotion; and to this day the records of\r\nsuch revolting transactions constitute probably the foulest blot on\r\nthe Columbian escutcheon of the country of Du Guesclin and the Cid.\r\nBut the sins of these men may be said to have been avenged by heaven\r\nin the noon of their iniquities. Pizarro, having defeated Almagro at\r\nCuzco, and put many of his officers to death, in cold blood, had his old\r\ncomrade strangled and then beheaded in Lima, where the despot himself\r\nwas assassinated by young Almagro, who, in his turn, being defeated in\r\nbattle, also at Cuzco, by Vaca de Castro, was likewise put to death by\r\ndecapitation.\r\n\r\nPassing next to the Portuguese discoveries, that of Brazil was effected\r\nby Alvarez de Cabral, he having landed, by accident, through stress of\r\nweather, at Porto Seguro, on the 24th of April, 1500, calling the country\r\nSanta Cruz (Holy Cross) in gratitude for his delivery from shipwreck; but\r\nthe appellation was afterwards altered to that which it at present bears,\r\nsignifying redwood, the well-known substance familiar to us as Brazil\r\nwood; yet it was the subsequent exploration of this coast, some four\r\nyears afterwards, that enabled Amerigo Vespucci to eternise his own name\r\nas the accepted discoverer of the continent itself.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the vagaries and mutations of geographical\r\nnomenclature, in this region of the world, occurs in connection with\r\nthe great achievement that next solicits our notice, viz., the doubling\r\nof the Cape, and consequent opening-up of an oceanic highway to India.\r\nThis was second in importance only to the discovery of the New World\r\nitself, and, indeed, well nigh placed Portugal on a par with Spain\r\nin honorary maritime status. Vasco de Gama, whose exploits inspired\r\nthe muse of Camoens in the Lusiad,[10] which noble poem is in a great\r\nmeasure only a rythmetical narrative of the perils of the navigator,\r\n‘made the Cape’ November 20th, 1497; and, with the expressiveness of all\r\nthe earlier mariners, named it the ‘Cape of Tempests,’[11] and it was\r\nafterwards known as the ‘Lion of the Sea,’ and the ‘Head of Africa.’\r\nThese designations were different indeed to that it has long rejoiced\r\nin—the ‘Cape of Good Hope’—so called by John the Second of Portugal, who\r\ndrew a favourable augury of future discoveries thence, because of his\r\nadventurous subject, Diaz, having reached the extremity of Africa, at\r\nthat point, though in doing so, he perished there in 1500, having divided\r\nwith Gama the honour of being its original discoverer, and supposed by\r\nsome to have preceded him by nearly ten years. Previous, however, to this\r\nlatter occurrence, even if we accept the earliest date claimed for Diaz,\r\nmankind was amazed by reports of the circumnavigation of the globe—a\r\nfeat, which, like those already named, has been a fruitful source of\r\ncontroversy as to the just recipient of the meed of priority. Sebastian\r\nde Elcano is, perhaps, the most generally accepted by foreign writers.\r\nGoralva and Alvalradi, both Spaniards, performed the task—astounding,\r\nindeed, when we think of the fragile craft employed, and the unknown\r\ncourses ventured upon—in one and the same year, 1537, without concert\r\nwith each other. Mendana, another Spaniard, repeated it in 1567—preceding\r\nour own immortal sovereign of the seas, Drake, by ten years. But long\r\nanterior to all these, was the Portuguese Magellan, who, in 1519, being\r\nin the service of Spain, determined the sphericity of the earth by\r\nkeeping a westerly course through the straits bearing his name, across\r\nthe Pacific, and returning to the spot he set out from, or rather the\r\nship did, for he was killed at the Philippines, on his passage back, the\r\nwhole voyage occupying three years and twenty-nine days.[12] These,\r\nand a series of marvels, only subordinate in wonder because inferior in\r\nimportance, kept the western world in unflagging excitement for a long\r\nsuccession of years, during which Europe tingled with the tidings of\r\nvast countries being discovered, assailed, and captured, by mere handfuls\r\nof obscure fortune-hunters, and yielding up such exhaustless treasures\r\nas rendered the Spanish and Portuguese peninsula, for a prolonged season,\r\nthe richest kingdoms in the world—the veritable ‘envy and admiration\r\nof surrounding nations.’ To all this we may add that momentum given to\r\ncommerce and navigation which has gone rolling on, until fleets of all\r\nnations cover the seas; and, so far as we are aware at present, not an\r\nisland now unknown, of any importance, remains to reward the search of\r\nhim[13] who has been last commissioned to find one if he can, even in the\r\ncomparatively little frequented Polynesian group, for the penal purposes\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on the different results that have attended different\r\ncourses of action with reference to the conquered territories of North\r\nand South America; nor attempt to trace the decline of one power at the\r\nexpense of another. Spain and Portugal, unfortunately for themselves,\r\ndealt with their gifts on purely selfish principles; and the consequence\r\nof such a system was, not only the loss of the greater part of their\r\ncolonies, but an almost total estrangement between the parent and child,\r\nnever afterwards thoroughly healed. We attempted the same game in North\r\nAmerica, and the giant-like progress of the United States has followed;\r\nonly that, wiser in our generation, more forgiving, and actuated by\r\ntrue commercial principles, we have cultivated, to the utmost extent,\r\nrelations of amity and good-will with the new power, and both countries\r\nare largely gainers thereby, and will continue to be so while the same\r\nfeelings of mutual concession and respect actuate both.\r\n\r\nWhilst, therefore, North America has made such astonishing progress, and\r\ncompletely outstrips the Old World in rapidity of thought and execution,\r\ncarrying her commerce and people to the limits of the habitable\r\nglobe, the states to the southward have had many severe ordeals to go\r\nthrough—arising, in the first place, from the cause just mentioned, viz.,\r\nthat the mother countries considered their colonies as mere appanages,\r\nand prevented communication, in some cases even intercourse, with other\r\nnations. Secondly, from the disseverment of the link which united them\r\nto Europe, having an entirely new phase to pass through, new forms of\r\ngovernment to establish, and fresh relations to cultivate; whilst another\r\nimmediate effect of the revolution was to drive away most of the wealthy\r\ninhabitants who, being Spanish and Portuguese citizens, were not a\r\nlittle vain of their superiority in that respect to their colonial-born\r\nbrethren. This fruitful source of dissent and violence in nearly all\r\nthe disturbances by which the several states were torn is by no means\r\nwholly obliterated to this day, any more than in some of the transmarine\r\npossessions of Great Britain, in either hemisphere. Then came intestine\r\ndivisions among the American-born colonists themselves, raging between\r\nthe upstart leaders of mushroom parties, whose very names it taxed the\r\nmemory of men at the time to remember; and, as a matter of course, there\r\nfollowed all the thousand drawbacks resulting from a state of anarchic\r\nconfusion. Hence, as is obvious must have been the case under such\r\ncircumstances, material progress has been slow, and political progress\r\nfor a long time almost imperceptible, if not frequently retrogressive,\r\nif one may use a phrase so seemingly contradictory. Moreover, until of\r\nlate years very little was known of the internal resources of South\r\nAmerica, with the exception of the Brazils—a country to which a variety\r\nof circumstances conspired to impart an impetus along the groove of\r\ncivilization and consequent advancement. Paramount amongst those aids\r\nwas undoubtedly the establishment there, in 1806, of the old Portuguese\r\nmonarchy, consequent upon the European troubles of the house of Braganza.\r\nThe inappreciable advantage of this regular form of government, arising\r\nout of local monarchic institutions, that country has retained, though\r\nunder a new sovereign and with a liberalized system of administration,\r\never since, with every guarantee for continuously rapid but enduring\r\nimprovement. Still, even Brazil was, to Europeans, comparatively\r\nspeaking, an unknown region, to which, in incongruous confusion, attached\r\nassociations of the soft and the savage, of barbarism and luxury, of the\r\nmajestic and the feeble, in the minds of all nearly whose reading about\r\nher was not corrected by personal familiarity with the country itself.\r\nBut ignorance so arising is being happily fast dissipated; and it shall\r\nnot be the author’s fault if its departure be not further expedited on\r\nsome points to which it still adheres.\r\n\r\nBoth the Spaniards and Portuguese possess works of rare merit, far\r\nexceeding in magnitude and minuteness any we can boast of, illustrating\r\nthe achievements of their early navigators, and the rise and progress\r\nof their former colonial possessions. But few of these works have\r\nbeen rendered familiar to the British public, and are very imperfectly\r\nknown, even to those writers who profess to treat of the same or similar\r\nsubjects. Of course we except Prescott, the appreciation of whose\r\ninvaluable volumes on the Conquest of Peru, the Conquest of Mexico,\r\nand the History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, is testified\r\nby the exhaustion of six large and expensive editions, and one cheaper\r\nedition, in this country, besides the incorporation of the fruits of\r\nhis extraordinary research in a thousand publications that have since\r\nbeen issued on either side of the Atlantic. Previously, however, to\r\nPrescott, and in nearly as large a degree, in respect to the territory\r\ndescribed, were we indebted to Southey, for his History of Brazil;[14]\r\nto Koster for valuable details of his travels in the northern provinces\r\nof the same empire; and to Gardner, for a most elaborate research into\r\nits botanical treasures, as also a graphic description of the interior\r\nof the empire, which he traversed from north to south.[15] The hygiene\r\nof the same region has been thoroughly investigated, and its rationale\r\nexpounded with consummate ability and simplicity of style, by my learned\r\nand accomplished fellow-townsman, Dr. Dundas, than whom no man was more\r\ncompetent for the task; and I rejoice to see that, though the subject\r\nis necessarily of a very circumscribed range, comparatively speaking,\r\nand one not very likely to command public attention, its treatment was\r\nso masterly, that nearly all the professional journals in the kingdom\r\nreceived it as an important contribution to medical literature.[16]\r\nIts perusal, however, may be also recommended to the general reader as\r\ncontaining notices of Brazilian life and manners and scenery nowhere else\r\nto be met with, and which the peculiar facilities enjoyed by the author\r\nenabled him to describe with a life-like minuteness whose truthfulness at\r\nonce stamps its accuracy both on the stranger at a distance and on the\r\nmost experienced Brazilian resident or native. In speaking thus, I am\r\nmerely echoing well-recognized facts; my opinion, which would of course\r\nbe utterly valueless in a medical sense, being in no degree warped by the\r\npersonal obligation Dr. Dundas has placed me under from the circumstance\r\nof his having kindly consented to enrich this volume with a special\r\nchapter on a theme analogous to that which his ‘Sketches’ are devoted to.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the now patriarchal, or, as he calls himself,\r\n‘Antediluvian’ Humboldt, who has showered upon European understanding\r\nthe light of scientific knowledge concerning the vast South American\r\ncontinent, and his inimitable descriptions of the country and its natural\r\nresources have scarcely been appreciated amongst us as they deserve. It\r\nis only when confronted with the great fact, so long regarded as the\r\nsentimental aspiration of utopiaists, that South America is actually\r\nbecoming an additional field for our industry and enterprise—when its\r\nmagnificent fluvial highways are about being traversed by an endless\r\nsuccession of steamers, and its plains by railways—that we really\r\ndiscover how infinitesimal is our knowledge of those resources or\r\ncapabilities to whose development these means can alone effectually\r\nconduce. As a medium of forming an estimate of the material position,\r\nas well as of the natural features of the countries described by him,\r\nHumboldt cannot be too highly commended, as the author, of all others,\r\nwhose flowing narrative, profundity of reflection, and copiousness of\r\nillustration—commensurate with the greatness of the subject itself—will\r\namply repay all ordinary curiosity; apart from that superabounding\r\nerudition and scientific affluence which pervade the whole works of the\r\ngreat living father of historical philosophers, though singularly freed,\r\nlike the treatises of our own Herschel, from technicalities that repel\r\nthe uninitiated. As relates to the Rio Plata and its immense tributaries,\r\nwe have had, in the course of the preceding year, Sir W. Parish’s\r\nelaborate and excellent volume,[17] whose only, though it is undoubtedly\r\na great drawback, is, that having been written obviously from inspiration\r\nof Rosas, and through the sources that personage opened to him for the\r\npurpose at Buenos Ayres, events are recorded in a light entirely in\r\nconformity with the views of the Dictator, whose whole past policy is\r\nupheld, and his intended plans prospectively eulogised in a manner to\r\nwhich subsequent events, and the judgment pronounced upon them, furnish a\r\nsignificant commentary. In harmony with Rosas’s principle of representing\r\nBuenos Ayres as virtually constituting the whole Argentine Confederation,\r\nand himself as the exponent of public opinion and the embodiment of\r\nactual power therein, Sir Woodbine almost altogether ignores the\r\nexistence of Monte Video, and scarcely alludes to such a state as the\r\nBanda Oriental. Hence, as regards the latter province and its capital,\r\nand all pertaining to them, Sir Woodbine’s book is a blank, or something\r\nworse—a deficiency which it is one of the objects of the present volume,\r\nin some degree, to supply. Of the condition of some of the interior\r\nprovinces, likewise, Sir Woodbine, being obliged to take his information,\r\nnot only at second hand, but through a channel in which every thing\r\nwas conductive to the one end, that of exalting Rosas, or depreciating\r\nhis opponents, gives us particulars not merely inaccurate, but leading\r\nto conclusions the very reverse of what a true state of the case would\r\nwarrant. On this head, especially as regards by far the most important\r\nof all the interior states—Paraguay—it is hoped that the present volume\r\nwill be found to contain much new and reliable information. For this,\r\nthe writer is mainly indebted to notes of observations made on the\r\nroute to, and during a residence in, Assumption, by parties personally\r\ncognizant of the late most successful and important mission sent out by\r\nLord Malmesbury, whose prescience, in foreseeing the right moment—and in\r\nselecting the right agent, Sir C. Hotham, for urging negociations towards\r\nthat object—the author had the satisfaction of hearing emphatically\r\npanegyrized in all commercial circles—whether native, British, or\r\nforeign—in the course of his late visit to South America.\r\n\r\nLastly, Mr. M’Cann,[18] whose previous work on the Plate had evinced\r\ngreat knowledge of the subject, has recorded his later experience of\r\nsome of the Riverine provinces in a very agreeable and instructive work,\r\npartly formed on the model of Sir F. Bond Head’s fascinating Rough Rides\r\non the Pampas, and embracing a review of mercantile matters and prospects\r\nin those countries. Written with that knowledge of trade which only a\r\nmercantile man can be expected to possess, its spirit is so dispassionate\r\nas to be quite unique in a critic, on topics which would seem to impart\r\ntheir partizan atmosphere to all who endeavour to detail their position\r\nto those at a distance. Neither must I, by any means, omit to mention\r\nthe labours of another of my townsmen, Mr. Thomas Baines, who, with that\r\nmastery of detail and facility of statistic exposition which seem to\r\nbe an heir-loom in the family of the late estimable member for Leeds,\r\nplaced in a very lucid light, some years ago, a subject to which it\r\nwas difficult at the time to draw general attention, and a popular\r\nelucidation of which could only be expected from a pen so qualified.\r\n\r\nBut of all portions of South America, there is one perhaps concerning\r\nwhich our knowledge is most imperfect, and with which it is most\r\nessential that it should be extended, because of the rapid extension\r\nof both native and European enterprise in that quarter. We especially\r\nallude to that district of the vast region watered by the Amazon of\r\nwhich Pará (city) may be considered the _entrepot_. Fortunately, two\r\nvery admirable volumes have recently been directed to supplying our\r\ndeficiency on this head.[19] The obligations due to these sources will\r\nbe found amply acknowledged in the chapter devoted to a consideration of\r\nthe subject. Our own text is enriched with matter drawn from original\r\nauthorities, long resident on the spot, and in every way calculated to\r\nsupply trustworthy intelligence. From these the reader will draw his\r\nown deductions, as our informants, not encumbering their data with\r\ndisquisition, have left their facts to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the number of publications enumerated as being lately\r\nissued upon South America, and not taking into account others published\r\nin the United States, still there is a field of immense extent, as\r\nyet comparatively unexplored and hidden, which requires to be opened\r\nup to view, in order to enable us to form a sufficiently accurate\r\njudgment of the character and capabilities of such countries as Brazil\r\nand the republics bordering on the river Plate and its affluents. The\r\nmain design, therefore, towards this end on the part of the writer\r\nin revisiting the scenes of his early youth, is to endeavour to\r\npresent some fresh sources of information; partly derived from his own\r\nactual observation, and partly from the experience of others, who,\r\npossessing the best opportunities, have converted them to the best\r\nuse in furtherance of the purpose now sought to be attained—viz., the\r\nelimination of what shall serve for a compact but comprehensive _precis_\r\nof the general condition of the countries named in the title page, and\r\nparticularly their commercial status and prospective indications of a\r\nmercantile complexion. To refresh the memory on such analogous subjects\r\nas may prove interesting in connection with these matters, there is\r\nappended what it is hoped will prove a mass of desirable information, in\r\nthe shape of a collection of notes, bringing down incidents to the latest\r\npracticable period antecedent to publication. In order to interfere as\r\nlittle as possible with the current of the narrative, in which it has\r\nbeen deemed expedient to convey the accompanying observations, the writer\r\nintends offering his memoranda in the shape of a record of his voyage,\r\ntaking in all points touched upon as they naturally arose in connection\r\nwith it; and incidentally referring to those authors who have exhibited\r\nthe greatest acquaintance with the topics embraced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOUTWARD BOUND.—LIVERPOOL TO LISBON.\r\n\r\n    The Argentina on her maiden voyage.—Capacity and capability of\r\n    the river boat at sea.—From the Mersey to the Tagus in four\r\n    days.—Lisbon and its Laureats, Vathek and Childe Harold.—Lord\r\n    Carnarvon on Mafra and its marble halls.—Monasticism and\r\n    Monarchy.—Aspect and Attributes of the Lusitanian Capital\r\n    and its Vicinage.—Portuguese Millers and the Grinding\r\n    process among the Grain Growers.—A ‘bold peasantry, their\r\n    country’s pride,’ the same everywhere.—Native memorabilia of\r\n    the earthquake, and Anglo reminiscence thereof.—Anatomical\r\n    offerings extraordinary.—The hic jacet of Tom Jones, and eke\r\n    of Roderick Random.—Memento Mori, with admonitions to the\r\n    Living.—Portuguese peculiarities.—Personal and political\r\n    economy.—Fiscal fatuities.—Market-place notabilia.—Lisbon\r\n    society.—Clubs and Cookery.—Tea and Turn-out.—Friars, Females,\r\n    Fashions, and so forth, Operatic and Terpsichoratic.—Lusitanian\r\n    fidalgos, or Portuguese Peers in Parliament.—Portugal the\r\n    Paradise of Protectionists and Poverty.—Free-trade the only\r\n    corrective of such calamities.—Court Circulars, Conventions,\r\n    and Commanders.—Few books about Portugal, and necessity for\r\n    more.—Hints from the newest, including the Oliveira Prize\r\n    Essay.—A man’s house something like a castle in Lisbon, at the\r\n    cost of a cottage ornée.—Diplomatic and Consular Memoranda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARGENTINA—OUTWARD BOUND.]\r\n\r\n      On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,\r\n      And winds are rude in Biscay’s sleepless bay.\r\n      _Three_ days are sped, but with the _fourth_, anon,\r\n      New shores descried make every bosom gay;\r\n      And Cintra’s mountain greets them on their way,\r\n      And Tagus, dashing onward to the deep,\r\n      His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;\r\n      And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,\r\n    And steer ’twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.\r\n\r\n                                                          CHILDE HAROLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nInnumerable as are the craft of every calibre and formation,—sail, steam,\r\nand screw,[20]—by which this favourite and familiar route is traversed,\r\nseldom had the voyager seen in its course a vessel of dimensions similar\r\nto those of the Argentina, paddle-wheel, in which I had embarked,\r\nconstructed at Birkenhead by Mr. John Laird, to run between Monte Video\r\nand Buenos Ayres. She is, (or rather was, for alack, she is now a\r\nthing of the past,) 185 feet long by 21 feet beam, and with very fine,\r\nhollow lines; her engines of 120-horse power, by Fawcett, Preston, and\r\nCo. Intended for river work, and of a light draught of water, it was\r\nhardly to be expected that in ocean steaming, when compelled to carry\r\ncoals, provisions, and all the bulky and ponderous requirements of a\r\nlong voyage, the same results could be obtained as in the comparatively\r\ntranquil waters of inland navigation; but under all the disadvantages of\r\nbeing so laden, and having to make way against a strong head-wind and\r\nheavy sea, our average speed to Cape Finisterre was nearly 12 knots.\r\nSubsequently, we had a more favourable wind, and canvas assisted us a\r\nlittle, until we made the Berlings, (bold islets standing out some\r\nhalf-dozen miles from the land, with a light-house upon them,) getting to\r\nour moorings in the Tagus, before dark, on the evening of the fourth day\r\nafter quitting the Mersey.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive an easier navigation than that to Lisbon;\r\nwhen once across the Bay of Biscay and round Cape Finisterre, you make\r\ndirect for the Berlings, and other high rocks more to seaward, called\r\nthe ‘Estellas’ and ‘Farilhoes de Velha.’ There is plenty of spare room\r\nfor any vessel to pass inside the Berlings, thus saving some distance;\r\nand from Cape Corvoeiro the coast tends inwards to the mouth of the\r\nTagus,[21] presenting a succession of scenery, so novel and attractive,\r\nas at once to satisfy the spectator that the poetry of Byron and the\r\npoetic prose of Beckford,[22] have failed to exaggerate its beauties.\r\nConspicuous among the latter, though it is the handiwork of man\r\navailing himself of nature in her picturesquest mood, stands out the\r\nheight-crowning, marble-built Mafra, termed the Escurial of Portugal,\r\nfrom its immensity, magnificence, and the diversity of its contents,\r\nconsisting of a palace, a convent, and most superb church, whose six\r\norgans were pronounced by Byron to be the most beautiful he ever beheld\r\nin point of decoration, and was told that their tones corresponded to\r\ntheir splendour. The town of Mafra itself is a small place, 18 miles\r\nN.W. of Lisbon, containing about 3,000 inhabitants, and owes what\r\nimportance it possesses to the celebrated regal and ecclesiastical\r\nedifice, constructed in its vicinity by John V., in pursuance of a vow\r\nthat he would select the poorest locality in the kingdom; and, finding\r\ntwelve Franciscan friars living in one hut here, he gave the preference\r\nto Mafra—a partiality which its position, if not its preëminent poverty,\r\nabundantly justifies.[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELEM CASTLE, LISBON.]\r\n\r\nA cluster of shoals, called the bar, forms a semicircle at the mouth of\r\nthe Tagus, but is seldom an obstacle to vessels entering, for there is\r\ngenerally abundance of water on it to float even the largest vessels, the\r\nleast depth in the north channel, at low water, being 4 fathoms, and in\r\nthe south, 6. The only time that any difficulty is encountered, is when\r\nthe freshes, after heavy rains up the country, add their strength to that\r\nof the ebbing tide, which then runs out at the rate of seven or eight\r\nmiles an hour, and encounters a gale from seaward, for this causes the\r\nwater to break right across, and vessels must await the turn of the tide\r\nto get in; but in other respects the approach appears very easy, scarcely\r\nany captain who has been there before requiring the services of a pilot.\r\nAfter the intricacies and dangers of our own (the St. George’s) Channel\r\nnavigation, with the miles of sandbank that have to be threaded in\r\napproaching Liverpool, such an entrance as that to Lisbon calls but for\r\nsmall skill indeed in seamanship; and almost the veriest tyro in boxing\r\nthe compass might enact the part of Palinurus.\r\n\r\nPassing up the Tagus there are numerous forts, palaces, and other\r\nimposing buildings, or at least what appeared to be such in the dim\r\ntwilight that prevailed during our advance towards the Lusitanian\r\ncapital. The most commanding object (whereof presently) among these is\r\nBelem Castle, near which we were visited by the health officers, and\r\nallowed to proceed to our moorings off Lisbon, or rather to those of the\r\nRoyal Mail Company, which had been kindly lent until such time as our\r\nown are laid down. The rule at the Custom-house, in respect to vessels,\r\nis for the masters to enter them and declare whether their cargoes are\r\ndestined to be landed in Lisbon or not; if this be doubtful, which was\r\nnot our case, they ask to be put in _franquia_, that is, for leave to\r\nremain eight days in port until the point is decided. On obtaining this\r\nthey proceed a little way up the river for the appointed period. From\r\nBelem to that part of the river which is opposite to the centre of the\r\ncity, a distance of about four miles, the Tagus is some one and a half\r\nwide, and displays on its northern bank, mingled with the dark foliage\r\nof the orange and other trees, successive clusters of dwellings and\r\nchurches, including the palaces of the Ajúda and of Necessidades, in\r\nwhich latter the court is generally held, and from it mostly are dated\r\nthe royal decrees.\r\n\r\nWith but few exceptions, these buildings are white, which gives the\r\ncity, at first sight, a much cleaner appearance than is presented on\r\na nearer view. On the south side, which is hilly, but few buildings,\r\nunless we include a small fishing village near the mouth of the river,\r\nare visible, until the small town of Almada, opposite to the city, is\r\nreached, containing 4,000 inhabitants, and in whose vicinity is the gold\r\nmine of Adissa, which has been worked now for some years. A peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of the neighbourhood of Lisbon are the little mills with\r\nsails, gyrating away on every eminence, sometimes half a dozen within\r\na few yards of each other, and they whisk round so merrily, as to be\r\nquite a pleasant feature in the landscape. It might be the land, _par\r\nexcellence_, of Jolly Millers; for the floury sons of the Tagus seem\r\nto belong to the same race as their jovial brothers of the Dee, whose\r\nphilosophic indifference to the opinion of the world has been made alike\r\nmusical and memorable by Mr. Braham. That the Portuguese should be\r\nsprightly, however, is extremely surprising, seeing that they are ground\r\ninto dust, almost as literally as their own grain, or at least, the\r\ngrowers thereof; for one who knows them well, writing during a visit as\r\nlate as last year, (1853), says:—\r\n\r\n    They are a people much resembling in heartiness and good will\r\n    our own Irish brethren: they are also most apt to learn, and,\r\n    like the much calumniated sons of Erin, can work, and will\r\n    work when they are properly encouraged and remunerated. They\r\n    toil under a burning sun, half-naked and bare-headed, or in\r\n    the winter under drenching rains and piercing cold, with\r\n    naught else to protect them from the weather than a straw\r\n    thatch, or cloak; and without other aliment at times than a\r\n    lump of Indian-maize bread, and a mess of humble pottage, or,\r\n    at others, the same bread, and a raw onion, with water from\r\n    the brook as their only drink. _Couve gallego_ (cow cabbage,)\r\n    from their own little garden, a spoonful of oil from their own\r\n    olive-tree, a handful of salt gathered from the rocks on the\r\n    sea-shore, with crumbled Indian-corn bread, baked in their own\r\n    oven, (which, as is still the case in Canada, is built outside\r\n    every tenement,) form a stir-about, on which the labourer\r\n    contentedly makes his principal or even-tide meal, after the\r\n    toils of the day are over. Occasionally, he may indulge in a\r\n    morsel of _bacalhao_ (salt cod-fish), or a rancid sardine: but\r\n    where the family is numerous, from year’s end to year’s end,\r\n    they know not the taste of animal food.\r\n\r\nThere are but few wharves alongside of which vessels can take in and\r\ndischarge their cargoes, so they lie at anchor in the stream, and those\r\noperations are performed by means of lighters. There are, nevertheless,\r\nsome handsome quays, with convenient landing-places, of which those\r\nat the fish-market and the Caes Sodré are the most frequented; at the\r\nformer, the scene being highly animated, particularly in the season for\r\nsardinhas, or sardines, which constitute a considerable proportion of\r\nthe food of the lower orders. The handsomest quay is that which forms\r\none side of Blackhorse Square (Terreiro do Paço), so called from the\r\nstatue of Joseph the First on horseback in the centre; the other sides\r\nconsisting of public buildings, viz.: the Public Library, the Offices of\r\nthe Ministers of State, the Custom-house, and, at the eastern extremity,\r\nthe Exchange, being chiefly of marble, as, indeed, nearly all the\r\nprincipal edifices are. It makes a splendid promenade, where crowds of\r\nwell-dressed persons may be seen, on the sultry summer evenings, walking,\r\nor seated on the stone benches, enjoying the cool air from the river,\r\nuntil a late hour. From this square, five parallel and level streets,\r\nin which are the best shops, lead to the Roçio—a large, open space\r\nsurrounded by buildings, and appropriated to reviews, processions, &c.,\r\nand where, on its northern side, at one time existed the odious Prison\r\nof the Inquisition, adjoining the Palace of the same name, now no longer\r\noccupied, though sometimes visited on festive occasions by royalty. Just\r\nbeyond are the public gardens, well laid out, and stocked with flowers\r\nand shrubs, that bespeak the luxuriance and brilliancy of the Lusitanian\r\narboretum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRACA DO COMMERCIO, LISBON.]\r\n\r\nAll this portion of the city is more regularly built than the remainder,\r\nand is situated just over the very spot that felt the effects of the\r\nterrible earthquake, traces of which are now and then met with, in the\r\nshape of patches of old pavement, in digging for the foundations of\r\nhouses, &c.; though there are no traces of the successful storming of the\r\ncity by the French, under Junot, in 1807, nor of its equally successful\r\nresistance of a similar attempt a couple of years afterwards. In the\r\nvicinity of the Hospital of St. José are the ruins of a church, in which,\r\nembedded in the earth, were to be seen, some years since, if not now,\r\nskeletons, in various attitudes, of persons who formed the congregation\r\nat the time the catastrophe took place, which was, as the reader will\r\nrecollect, when the greater number of the citizens were assembled at mass\r\nin the churches on All-Saints’ Day, November 1st, in the ever-memorable\r\nyear 1755—a circumstance that will probably account for the enormous\r\nnumber of 30,000 lives being lost; for, although 6,000 private dwellings\r\nwere destroyed, the fatality could hardly have been so great but for the\r\nmultitudes being assembled in the mode mentioned. The celebration of the\r\nfestival, too, was otherwise the occasion of prodigious mischief; for,\r\nowing to the immense number of tapers in the churches, the curtains,\r\ndrapery, and other combustible materials, caught fire, and a devastating\r\nconflagration swept the doomed city from end to end, carrying off what\r\nthe convulsion had not already prostrated in ruin. Indirectly, however,\r\nthe commemoration of the festival was productive of some good—at least\r\nto our countrymen in Lisbon; for, in order to avoid exciting religious\r\nprejudice during a fête so solemn in the Papal calendar, they had nearly\r\nall retired to their country houses, and but ten who remained in the\r\ncity were killed, a fact which renders, if possible, more magnanimous\r\nthe grant by the British parliament of £100,000 to the relief of the\r\nsuffering Portuguese, immediately the dismal tidings arrived; news\r\nof like events, but not on such a scale, continuing to be received\r\nfor a long time after, from various portions of the New World. As in\r\nthe case of our own dear delightful ante-diluvian Chester, the older\r\nquarters of Lisbon city generally interest a stranger most, from their\r\nvery irregularity; the streets being narrow, steep, and destitute of\r\n_trottoirs_, and the houses very lofty, ranging in height from five to\r\nas many as eleven stories, in each of which dwells a separate family,\r\nall using one staircase in common. Notwithstanding the seeming peril\r\nfrom this cause, in the event of another earthquake, the danger of the\r\nwalls falling is considerably lessened by their being built with a strong\r\nframework of timber, dovetailed together, before the addition of brick or\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nSome of the churches are very handsome, although the absence of steeples\r\nwill perhaps cause them to be hardly so regarded by the majority of\r\nEnglishmen; and, moreover, many are in an unfinished state, for want of\r\nfunds. The one that probably astonishes unsophisticated Saxons most,\r\nis the Patriarchal Church, from the circumstance of the pillars which\r\nsupport the roof being covered with wax models of heads, arms, legs,\r\n&c.—the _naif_ native offerings of individuals, desirous of testifying\r\ntheir gratitude to the Virgin, for her cures of complaints affecting\r\nthose corporeal adjuncts. In the church of St. Roque is a small chapel,\r\ncontaining imitations, in mosaic, of several pictures of the Italian\r\nmasters. These, with the splendid decorations, consisting of lapis lazuli\r\ncolumns, candelabra in the precious metals, &c., are credibly estimated\r\nto have cost upwards of one million sterling. This vast expense, of\r\ncourse, could only have been in Portugal’s most palmy days, when the\r\ngenius of Albuquerque threw open the portals of the East, and showered\r\n‘barbaric pearl and gold’ upon his noble king, Emanuel, rightly indeed\r\ncalled the ‘Fortunate,’ and deserving so to be, as worthily inheriting\r\nthe throne of Alphonso the Victorious (son of the heroic Henry of\r\nBurgundy) who routed five Saracen monarchs at Ourique, and freed his\r\ncountry from the Moors. The British cemetery[24] (_Os aciprestes_),\r\nsurrounding a neat chapel, is well worth a visit, including, in its\r\nattractions, a monument to Fielding, who there lies buried. Few of our\r\ncountrymen, who have the opportunity, ever fail to make a pilgrimage to\r\nthe spot where rests all that is mortal of him who drew Partridge and\r\nBlifil, Squire Western and Sophia, Parson Adams and Tom Jones—his tomb\r\nbeing as eagerly sought as is that of his brother humourist, Smollett,\r\nat Leghorn. Strange that two of the most essentially English of all our\r\nwriters should have died and been entombed so far from their native land,\r\nwhose literature their genius has so long enriched, and will for ever\r\ncontinue to do so.\r\n\r\nBesides the public buildings already mentioned, there are several\r\nwell-managed hospitals, an arsenal, academies for instruction in the\r\nnaval, military, and other sciences; the Castle of St. George, used as\r\na prison more than as a place of defence: museums; a noble national\r\nlibrary, of 30,000 volumes, formed from those of the convents suppressed\r\nin 1835; and, lastly, the aqueduct of Alcantara, with thirty-six arches,\r\na splendid structure, north of the city, supplying the greater part of\r\nthe inhabitants with water, and so solid, that it withstood the shock\r\nof earthquake, which laid nearly all else in ruins. The central arch is\r\nof sufficient dimensions to allow of a three-decker, under full sail,\r\npassing through, were there water to float her.\r\n\r\nThe population of Lisbon is between 250,000 and 300,000, having increased\r\nrapidly of late years, though sadly thinned during Don Miguel’s\r\nusurpation, owing to the wholesale murders which were then committed, the\r\nnumbers obliged to serve in the army, and killed, and also the emigration\r\nso many hundreds, nay thousands, were compelled to have recourse to, in\r\norder to escape from his cruelties, and those of his satellites. The\r\nremembrance of these atrocities, however, would seem insufficient to\r\ndeprive him of some partizans in the country yet, if we may judge by the\r\nintrigues in his favour that have supervened on the death of the queen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CINTRA, NEAR LISBON.]\r\n\r\nA first visit to Portugal cannot fail to revive—in the minds of\r\nEnglishmen—‘memories of the past,’ full of ‘sweet and bitter fancies,’\r\nas being alike the spot where England, by her diplomatic fatuity, earned\r\nan immortality of ridicule, and, by her valour, an eternity of praise,\r\nthanks to the Great Duke and his troops, so many of whom fell in defence\r\nof those liberties, which, if what survives here be a fair specimen,\r\nwere certainly hardly worth the cost of preservation;[25] for, even at\r\nthis distance of time, how many families can recal the bereavements\r\nthey sustained in that glorious struggle. Moreover, Portugal possesses\r\na deep interest from the great deeds of its early navigators, already\r\nslightly adverted to. None who sympathize with the noble qualities the\r\nmention of these heroic names conjures up can fail to deplore that the\r\nspirit of Vasco de Gama, Cabral, Camoens,[26] and many others, has not\r\ndescended to succeeding generations, rendering the land their genius and\r\npatriotism had adorned what it might yet be made under an enlightened\r\ngovernment, viz., one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. That it\r\nis not so, even after the mismanagement it has endured, and is enduring\r\nnow, nearly as bad as ever, is a matter of never-ending wonderment to\r\nthose who know its means and appliances for advancement in the scale of\r\nnations. As regards myself, desire for personal authentication on the\r\nspot of what I had known from others, imparted an additional zest to my\r\nvisit, from long acquaintance with the Brazils, even in the time of the\r\ngrandfather of the late Queen, when the present splendid South American\r\nempire was a struggling colony of the now enfeebled and decaying parent\r\nkingdom. Hence I was prepared to look with a favourable eye on all that\r\ncame under my notice in the capital of Portugal—a disposition enhanced\r\nby the first glance I had an opportunity of bestowing upon it; for, seen\r\nfrom the river on a bright sunny morning, Lisbon’s strikingly picturesque\r\naspect and position reminded me strongly both of Bahia and Rio Janeiro, a\r\nportion of the city being built, like them, on low ground; hills, covered\r\nin every direction with handsome structures of variegated colours,\r\nchiefly white, rising like an amphitheatre behind; whilst the red-tiled\r\nroofs, green verandahs, and other fanciful decorations, lend to the whole\r\na very foreign, almost tropical, but extremely pleasing appearance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the parallel between the capital of Portugal and the\r\nmetropolis of her flourishing transatlantic offspring further holds good,\r\nas, on landing, much of the pleasing illusion vanishes:\r\n\r\n      For whoso entereth within this town,\r\n      That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,\r\n      Disconsolate will wander up and down,\r\n      ’Mid many things unsightly to strange ee;\r\n      For hut and palace show like filthily;\r\n      The dingy denizens are rear’d in dirt;\r\n      No personage of high or mean degree\r\n      Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,\r\n    Though shent with Egypt’s plague, unkempt, unwash’d, unhurt.\r\n\r\nNor are you greatly disposed to make allowances for the cause of your\r\ntopographical disenchantment, as you find yourself a mere object of\r\nfiscal surveillance—obliged to be set ashore at the Custom-house, like\r\na biped bale of merchandise, and have your hat or umbrella scanned as\r\nif they ought to be subjected to duty, like everything else, animate\r\nand inanimate, that approaches these most absurdly protected waters.\r\nVery soon, however, mere chagrin at such petty personal annoyances\r\ndeepens into gloom, as you observe the mournful absence of that incessant\r\nactivity you expect to meet with in so large and important a place.\r\nThe fatal spell of lethargy and exclusiveness seems to be laid upon\r\neverything and everybody:—the very carriages and public conveyances (at\r\nleast a large portion) are redolent of the past century, and all idea of\r\nlocomotion is put to flight at the sight of them; and just the same is\r\nthe case with the owners. Torpidity pervades the whole population, from\r\nthe infant in arms, who is too lazy to laugh, to the cripple on crutches,\r\nwho is too sluggish to grumble. An exception to this rule, however, is\r\nthe market-place, where fruit, vegetables, the sardines already spoken\r\nof, and other odd articles, are brought for sale. The motley groups, with\r\ntheir baskets or little stalls, sheltered by umbrellas of all sizes and\r\ncolours, are like so many fancy-fair Chinese, whom Portuguese a good deal\r\nresemble in bodily configuration, as well as in other attributes equally\r\nlittle spiritualised, however Celestial. The kaleidoscopic tableau going\r\non here is a relief to the monotony of other places of resort, and so\r\nvividly impresses the stranger that he fancies the performers in the\r\nscene must be foreigners, and not ‘natives and to the manner born.’ The\r\ntheatrical air of the whole thing is not a little heightened, in his\r\nopinion, on finding that no sooner has the clock told one, than, like\r\none o’clock, they all have to pack up their wares and depart till next\r\nday, in preparation for the business whereof the market is thoroughly\r\ncleaned and put in order. This regulation might be advantageously\r\nadopted in regions where the mention of the word Portuguese, especially\r\nin connection with cleanliness, immediately superinduces a spasmodic\r\nagitation in the hearer’s nose, if indeed he can keep his countenance at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut Portuguese society, as I happen to know very well, from long and\r\nvaried experience, is extremely agreeable in many places; and certainly\r\nthe natives of the old country are exceedingly hospitable to strangers.\r\nThere are several clubs, at the balls of one of which, the Foreign\r\nAssembly-rooms, all the rank and fashion of the capital are to be seen,\r\nto the number of several hundreds. I had the gratification of being\r\nintroduced at the Lisbon Club. The house had been formerly, like so many\r\nsimilar institutions in London, a nobleman’s palace. Although not on so\r\ngrand a scale, it possesses superior accommodation to most places of\r\nthe kind amongst us; and if the Portuguese keep no Soyer, Francatelli,\r\nor Ude, with a _batterie de cuisine_ corresponding in magnitude and\r\ndiversity to the celebrity of these professors of the finest art—that\r\nof giving a good dinner—they have a social party of an evening,[27]\r\nwhen a piquant and substantial tea is provided for those who wish to\r\nsacrifice to the ‘Chinese nymph of tears, Bohea.’ The original taste of\r\nthe Portuguese, who were the first to introduce the beverage to Europe,\r\nlong before Mr. Pepys drank his ‘cup of China drink,’ [1661,] still\r\nsurvives, as well as the taste for coffee, the berry of Mocha being a\r\nfavourite among the offspring of the victims of the Arabs. Chocolate,\r\nalso, is a very popular beverage, and is consumed in considerable\r\nquantities at breakfast and supper, the two principal meals among the\r\nmajority of Portuguese. The upper classes dress like those of other\r\nEuropean capitals, but the lower order of females still retain the cloak\r\nand hood peculiar to this part of the Peninsula. There is not, however,\r\nso much difference now between the costume of the population and that of\r\nother cities, as the cowls, sandals, and rope belts of the friars, are no\r\nlonger to be seen; for, as is well known, all the religious orders (not\r\nthose of nuns) were suppressed in 1835. There is a strong partiality for\r\ngaudy colours and trinkets; but that is passing away.\r\n\r\nThough, generally speaking, the female population of Portugal are not\r\nof very prepossessing appearance, especially the humbler classes, whose\r\nnaturally swarthy complexion is embrowned by exposure to the sun, there\r\nare few capitals in Europe where more perfect specimens of beauty are\r\nto be seen than in Lisbon: and what enhances the effect their somewhat\r\nunexpected presence produces is, that they are almost invariably\r\n_blondes_, therein differing from most of their Iberian sisterhood on\r\nthe other side of the Douro, especially those of Cadiz, of whom the\r\nnoble lord, already quoted, says that they are the Lancashire Witches\r\nof Spain. But the other noble lord, whom we have also quoted—and we\r\ncertainly can corroborate all he says, from our individual experience in\r\nBrazil, of the classes he speaks of—observes: ‘If I could divest myself\r\nof every national partiality, and suppose myself an inhabitant of the\r\nother hemisphere, and were asked in what country society had attained its\r\nmost polished form, I should say in Portugal. This perfection of manner\r\nis, perhaps, most appreciated by an Englishman: Portuguese politeness\r\nis delightful, because it is by no means purely artificial, but flows,\r\nin a great measure, from a national kindness of feeling. The restless\r\nfeeling, so often perceptible in English society, hardly exists in\r\nPortugal; there is little prepared wit in Portuguese society, and no one\r\ntalks for the mere purpose of producing an effect, but simply because his\r\nnatural taste leads him to take an active part in conversation. Dandyism\r\nis unknown among their men, and coquetry, so common among Spanish women,\r\nis little in vogue among the fair Portuguese. They do not possess, to\r\nthe same extent, the hasty passions and romantic feelings of their\r\nbeautiful neighbours; but they are softer, more tractable, and equally\r\naffectionate. Even when they err, the aberrations of a married Portuguese\r\nnever spring from fashion or caprice, seldom from vanity, and, however\r\nculpable, are always the result of real preference. Certainly, with\r\nsome exceptions, the women are not highly educated; they feel little\r\ninterest, on general subjects, and, consequently, have little general\r\nconversation. A stranger may, at first, draw an unfavourable inference\r\nas to their natural powers, because he has few subjects in common with\r\nthem; but, when once received into their circles, and acquainted with\r\ntheir friends, he becomes delighted with their liveliness, wit, and\r\nready perception of character.’ I quote this passage, believing from all\r\nI heard and observed in Lisbon, that it is an accurate summary of the\r\nPortuguese character there; that it is nearly equally applicable, in a\r\ngreat degree, to Portuguese society in Madeira; and, knowing that it is\r\nso, in respect to Portuguese society in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe places of amusement consist of five theatres, including the\r\nopera-house, where, as the London and Parisian _dilettanti_ well know,\r\nmany excellent singers make their _début_: the getting up the scenery,\r\n&c., are inferior to few establishments of the kind anywhere, and the\r\nprices are very moderate. It is called San Carlos, and it is scarcely\r\ninferior in any respect, either in its architectural extent or the\r\nliberality of its appointments, to its more famous Neapolitan namesake.\r\nMadame Castellan—herself, I believe, a fellow-countrywoman of Inez de\r\nCastro, whose portrait she greatly resembles—has been the principal lyric\r\nartiste during the past season. There is also a building for bull-fights,\r\nwhich, though perhaps as much a national sport as in Spain, is not\r\npursued with the same passionate ardour, nor with the same skill, as is\r\ndisplayed by professors of the tauro-machiac art in the sister country.\r\n\r\nI also attended a sitting of the two Chambers, which appeared to be\r\nconducted with great decorum, but, at the same time, without that\r\nlistlessness or buzzy-fussiness which pervades our own Senate when\r\na bore or a nobody happens to be on his legs. The accommodation for\r\nmembers is at least as good as ours. To be sure, it could not possibly\r\nbe much worse, if we may judge from those most qualified to form an\r\nopinion—the members themselves; for, what with the perpetual complaints\r\nabout pestilent smells, hot blasts, freezing draughts, blinding light,\r\nand sightless darkness, one would imagine that the British Senate-house\r\nwas constructed to serve as a ‘frightful example’ of deleterious\r\narchitecture. The wonder is, that any M.P. has the face to approach a\r\nlife-insurance office, at the beginning of a session, without being\r\nprepared with a ‘doubly hazardous’ premium on his ‘policy,’ knowing\r\nthat he is going to talk, or listen to the talk, of politics for some\r\nsix months; and, certainly, the looks of many of our law-makers can be\r\nconsolatory to none but coffin-makers and residuary legatees. Not so\r\nwith the Portuguese Conscript Fathers, nearly all of whom seemed as\r\nhale as new moidores out of the mint, both as to stamina, complexion,\r\nand sensibility. The enormous building where they meet (the old convent\r\nof San Bento) contains all the needful official and red-tape-ical\r\ndepartments. In the Upper Chamber, the Patriarch occupied the chair, in\r\nhabiliments not unlike those of the Bishop of Oxford, when enrobed in\r\nhis costume of Chancellor of the Order of the Garter; and it was curious\r\nto see an epitome of our own admixture of the ecclesiastical with the\r\ntemporal system of legislation, in the House of Lords, carried out in\r\nthis Portuguese conjunction of spiritual with lay law-makers.\r\n\r\nIn vain you look in the Tagus for that forest of shipping which should\r\nfringe the watery highway to, and ought to constitute the leading feature\r\nin, so fine a port—the capital of a country the once nautical genius of\r\nwhose people is expressed in the only poem in any language that makes\r\nadventures on the deep its theme. A few stray vessels here and there,\r\nwith river and fishing boats, and those singular latine sails, that so\r\nstrike the stranger,[28] some steamers and Government vessels, were\r\nall that could now be seen on the bosom of the river, so famed amongst\r\nthe ancients for its golden attributes, not because of its auriferous\r\nsands,[29] but because of the affluent tide of its teeming commerce—that\r\nport whence, in after ages, though now ages long ago, went forth those\r\nexpeditions which brought much of Asia into comparative contiguity with\r\nEurope, and discovered, and long held so much of, the finest portion of\r\nthe New World. For a wonder, not a ‘speck of power’ of that nation, whose\r\ncommerce rose as Lusitania’s fell, not an English man-of-war, ubiquitous\r\nin every water, and very often present, and too long at a time, in most\r\nunnecessary numbers, in these waters in particular, was to be seen,\r\nthough Admiral Corry’s squadron, containing many of the finest and latest\r\nbuilt men-of-war in our navy, including the ‘Duke of Wellington,’ and now\r\nwith Napier in the Baltic, has since been there. Their absence, however\r\ngratifying to financial economists and advocates of non-intervention in\r\npolitics, helped to complete the triste and dreary air of the empty mart\r\nand shipless bay. The cause of this poverty of trade must be obvious\r\nto all, even to enlightened Portuguese. The Government, blind to all\r\nexperience elsewhere, deaf to the supplications of common sense and\r\neven self-interest, draw a kind of cordon round the little trade they\r\nstill possess, and encumber it with such a net-work of preposterous\r\nrestrictions, as actually to squeeze the life-blood out of it, or,\r\nrather, altogether arrest its circulation, which is the same thing in\r\nthe end, as regards the vitality of commerce. The evil extends to every\r\nramification of industrial pursuit; and one half of the population live\r\nupon a system that seems to have been invented to exclude, instead of\r\nencouraging business to come to their shores. Hence, it need hardly be\r\nsaid, that smuggling is the most profitable trade going; and a large\r\nand rapidly increasing business in that line is carried on, along the\r\nfrontier in particular.\r\n\r\nIf Colonel Sibthorpe, Mr. Newdegate, and the remainder of that Spartan\r\nband of fifty-nine, who followed the phantom of Protection into the lobby\r\nof the House of Commons a couple of years ago, finding that the sun of\r\nEngland has indeed for ever set, as they so often anticipated, desire\r\nto bask in the beams of unmitigated monopoly, by all means let them hie\r\nhither forthwith; and they will behold one realm, at least, that carries\r\nout their views to the utmost possible extent. By way of apparently\r\nbolstering up native industry, Portugal fosters a few stray manufacturing\r\nestablishments, and farms out monopolies of certain articles (tobacco\r\nand soap for instance) to parties who, in the rigorous exercise of their\r\nprivileges, put another and most effectual drag-chain on the march of\r\ncommerce. The fruits of such policy are but too apparent; for even\r\nthe neighbouring state of Spain, so long the synonyme of every fiscal\r\nfatuity, but now awaking to a true sense of what it owes to her glorious\r\nmaritime associations, and to her present and perspective well-being,\r\nis taking away a large portion of Portuguese traffic, by judiciously\r\nreducing her tariff, promoting railway enterprise, and gradually\r\nadopting those liberal views, without whose practical recognition now\r\nevery country must lapse into almost primeval barbarism. Undoubtedly an\r\nextenuation of the imbecility of Portugal is her complete dependence\r\nand reliance on her colonies so long, for while she enjoyed a monopoly\r\nof them she flourished at their expense. Now things are reversed, and\r\nPortugal cannot bring herself to adopt the only remedy, free-trade and\r\nunrestricted commerce, in its largest and fullest extent. These would\r\nsoon fill her ports with shipping, raise rents, augment revenue, and\r\nplace her in a position worthy of the countrymen of Cabral, and of the\r\n_prestige_ which he and so many of his cotemporaries and followers so\r\nlong secured her. That she has an aptitude for commerce is well known;\r\nfor, though it was long deemed degrading, and even criminal, in high\r\ncaste Portuguese, to meddle in commercial matters, or to intermarry or\r\nassociate with those who did, there is scarcely any ’Change in the world\r\nat the present day that does not number a Lisbon or Oporto merchant among\r\nits ablest members.\r\n\r\nA stay of two days is a short time to enable a stranger to appreciate\r\nfully the merits of a large place like Lisbon; but the defects in her\r\nnational fiscal system as here manifested, at the very fountain head\r\nof the intelligence and influence of the empire, and its mischievous\r\ntendency in retarding prosperity, are unmistakeable. The handwriting\r\non the wall requires no interpreter; it points out approaching decay,\r\nunless Portugal alters her system before it is too late, and determines\r\nto go with the stream of events and the destinies of the world. The\r\nreal hope for the country still points in the direction of Brazil; not\r\nonly because of the peculiar weight of example in that quarter, where\r\nprosperity has progressively and unvaryingly followed every step in the\r\npath of commercial and political enlightenment—every assimilation to the\r\nexisting English system of mercantile polity—but from the circumstance\r\nof the affluence of Brazil healthily reacting upon, and wakening up\r\nthe energies of the old country to join _pari passu_ in the march with\r\nher vigorous progeny. In a trading, especially in a passenger-trading\r\nsense, the connection between the two is still important, and is every\r\nday becoming more so, through Anglo-Brazilian enterprise, (of which\r\nthe Liverpool Company I have the honour to belong to affords the most\r\nprominent instance yet), and is likely to be vastly improved by the\r\nestablishment of direct steam navigation, chiefly carried on by native\r\nand South American capital. The principal promoter of this is Mr. Moser,\r\nwell known for enterprise of a like kind in the navigation of the Minho,\r\nfrom which river to the Guadiana a screw steamer now plies.\r\n\r\nMost of the _bourgeoisie_ of Brazil were either born in Portugal\r\nor are descendants of Portuguese. Shop-keeping is a business these\r\nPeninsulars fully understand, especially those from Oporto; particularly\r\nin everything pertaining to trinkets, articles of jewellery, and\r\ngoldsmith’s-work, the Portuguese being therein cunning workmen, though\r\nfor the most part, regarded as indifferent carpenters, shoemakers, and\r\nthe like, at least by British employers. After realizing money abroad,\r\nthey naturally find their way to Portugal; where, if even for a season,\r\nthey enjoy themselves as only children of the South or of the tropics\r\ncan when they have the means; or spend the remainder of their days\r\nwhere their fathers lived and died before them. They will soon have the\r\ninvaluable advantage of the steamers of no less than three companies\r\ncalling at Lisbon, including the ‘Luso-Brazileira,’ which is also\r\ncomposed of Portuguese and Brazilian shareholders. These, let us hope,\r\nwill prove the immediate harbingers of that good time which can alone be\r\nbrought about by the multiplication of such instruments of a national\r\ngood; for it must be obvious to every one who knows Portugal, or the\r\nPortuguese abroad, that what is wanted is abundance of communication\r\nby steam, both by sea and land, railways, and free-trade, or some\r\napproximation to it. With these she may resume her position amongst the\r\nnations, and share with her oldest ally, England, the benefits arising\r\nfrom a mutually advantageous intercourse.\r\n\r\nRespecting the Royal Family, during my stay at Lisbon, when there was,\r\nof course, every apparent prospect of a long, if not a very tranquil\r\nand happy reign for the late Queen, I learnt that they kept themselves\r\nas retired and quiet as their exalted station would permit, appearing\r\nlittle in public, but understood to be busy in those plots and intrigues,\r\nsuspicion of which on the part both of the people and the upper classes,\r\ndeprived her Majesty of much of that popularity which her many excellent\r\nqualities were calculated personally to secure her. What may be the\r\ncourse that her husband, the Regent, will pursue, or that may be pursued\r\nby her son when he attains his legal majority in 1858, it is of course\r\nimpossible to foresee. His young Majesty is now in the course of making\r\na tour through Europe, chiefly with a view, it is said, of finding a\r\npartner for his throne; and rumour points to one of the house of Coburg\r\nto which his father belongs, viz., a daughter of the King of the\r\nBelgians. This alliance, though otherwise eligible in itself, is deemed\r\nby some politicians likely to aggravate the troubles of the country, by\r\nmaking it a hot-bed of extraneous intrigue, in addition to the domestic\r\nMiguelite plottings that appear chronic in Portugal.\r\n\r\nThere are, as already mentioned, several royal palaces, but few of them\r\ncompletely finished, or ever likely to be so, owing to the limited state\r\nof the civil list and the reluctance of the Cortes to grant supplies\r\nfor such purposes. The Palace of Ajúda is a truly regal building, whose\r\nexternal magnificence at least, fills every one with regret that it\r\nshould so far resemble so many others, of vast pretensions and undoubted\r\nbeauty, as to remain incompleted, and in consequence, unoccupied.\r\nVisitors to the Court are generally located in a pretty marine palace,\r\nwith a terrace and garden facing the river, at Belem, the town of\r\nwhich name contains about 5,000 inhabitants. In its vicinage is the\r\nburial-place of many of the earlier Portuguese monarchs; it possesses\r\nalso, in addition to the castle and custom-house already mentioned,\r\nand a singular-looking fortress, some other public institutions of\r\nnote, including a high-school, a convent, and the largest iron-foundry\r\nin Portugal, together with a noble church, built to commemorate the\r\nmemorable departure of Vasco de Gama on his great voyage, as so\r\nbeautifully alluded to by the national poet.\r\n\r\nIt may not be superfluous to caution the young or casual reader not to\r\nconfound this town with one somewhat similarly pronounced, Baylen, in\r\nSpain—a spot that sounds in French ears pretty much as Cintra does in\r\nours. And for much the same reason—the blundering incapacity of those\r\ncharged with the conduct of the transactions that took place, almost\r\nsimultaneously, in the same year, and within a month of each other;\r\nexcept that the former, having had priority of occurrence, rendered\r\nthe latter more inexcusable. It was in July, 1808, that 14,000 French,\r\ncommanded by Dupont and Wedel, being defeated by 25,000 Spaniards under\r\nPena and Compigny, Dupont’s entire division of 8,000 men laid down their\r\narms—the beginning of the French disasters in Spain, as lending courage\r\nto the whole native population to pursue that system of resistance which\r\nin the end, aided and directed by British valour and science, rendered\r\nnugatory all the efforts of the invader permanently to subdue the\r\ncountry. Of Belem, the recent military celebrity is not great, the two\r\nchief incidents in its history being its capture by the French, the year\r\nbefore the occurrence just named; and, secondly, its capture under the\r\ntroops of Don Pedro, in 1833. What lends its real historic, or at least\r\narchæologic interest to the place, is its propinquity to the remains\r\nof some of the finest Moorish architecture in the world, the Alhambra\r\nitself scarcely excepted; and these alone ought to suffice to render a\r\ntrip fashionable among our _ennuyéd_ tourists, to whom almost all the\r\nremainder of Europe is nearly as well known as the beach at Brighton or\r\nthe Westmoreland lakes. Notwithstanding the charm to British ears of the\r\nwords Busaco, Vimiera, Badajos, Braga, Torres Vedras, and the Douro,\r\nPortugal is a _terrâ incognita_ to the pic-nicish and Pickwickian tribe,\r\nand altogether exempt from the remonstrance of the _blazé_ bard—\r\n\r\n    And is there then no earthly place,\r\n      Where we can rest, in dream Elysian,\r\n    Without some curst, round English face,\r\n      Popping up near, to break the vision?\r\n    ’Mid northern lakes, ’mid southern vines,\r\n      Unholy cits we’re doom’d to meet;\r\n    Nor highest Alps nor Apennines\r\n      Are sacred from Threadneedle Street!\r\n    If up the Simplon’s path we wind,\r\n    Fancying we leave this world behind,\r\n    Such pleasant sounds salute one’s ear\r\n    As—‘Baddish news from ’Change, my dear.’\r\n\r\nBut how can it be wondered that Portugal should be a yet untrodden Eden\r\nto the tourist, seeing that it is the only country, or tract of country,\r\nin Europe, or on the confines thereof, from Odessa to Iceland, that\r\nMurray hasn’t hand-booked? The ‘Anak of Booksellers,’ who has ‘done’ the\r\nPyramids and the Pyrenees, Styria and Finland, Whitechapel and Wallachia,\r\nthe Dnieper and the Nile, has left Portugal undone; for it cannot be\r\ncalled doing it, in the Albemarle-street sense of the term, to devote to\r\nit a few small pages of large type, and call them ‘Hints.’ Nevertheless,\r\nfar below the Murrayan standard as that is, still it will be useful, as\r\nbeing likely to incite travellers thitherward;[30] and then the great\r\npublisher will, doubtless, provide for their use some Head capable of\r\nturning out a sizeable and seasonable octavo of reading as delightful as\r\nBorrow and as instructive as Ford has done for the scarcely more romantic\r\nregion the other side of the Guadiana. Meanwhile, calling attention to\r\nthat one[31] of the ‘Hints’ which tells how others may be taken, as to\r\nthe London means of getting there, in addition to those still better\r\nLiverpool means furnished by our South American Steam Company, it is well\r\nto apprise the reader, desirous of the latest and best information about\r\nPortugal, that it will be found in the extremely agreeable and attractive\r\nvolume[32] which owes its origin to the munificence and patriotism of\r\nthe accomplished member for Pontefract, Mr. Oliveira, who, sprung of\r\nthe ancient Lusitanian stock himself, and numbering among his ancestors\r\nthe Pombals, de Castros, Tojals, and Thomars, has laboured assiduously,\r\nand most successfully, in disseminating among the most intelligent and\r\ninfluential minds of either country a correct knowledge of what conduces\r\nto the commercial prosperity of both. Towards this end nothing can be\r\nmore effectual than a careful study of the admirable essay alluded to\r\nbelow, and from which some few of the foregoing facts are taken. Indeed,\r\nwe would fain hope that, at least some of the excellent arguments it\r\naddresses to the Portuguese government have already produced a good\r\neffect; for, in the speech to the Cortes by the Regent, in January last,\r\nthere is great promise not only of railway encouragement, but regulations\r\nwe have spoken of being relinquished, such as the monopoly on salt, and\r\neven that on tobacco is likely soon to be abandoned. Improvements of a\r\nsimilar kind are to be extended to Madeira.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this brief chapter, which is, unfortunately, necessarily\r\nmuch more brief than the subject warrants, we have only to add, that\r\nshould its perusal, or that of the several works already enumerated,\r\ninduce readers to visit Lisbon in search of pleasure, and more especially\r\nthose in search of health, the important item of house-rent will be found\r\nalmost fabulously moderate compared with any other capital in Europe,\r\nand, I should imagine, in the world. A perfect palace, in the literal\r\nmeaning of the term, may be had for £100 a year, containing suites of\r\nrooms in which a coach and four might be turned. Provisions and all the\r\nproduce of the country are exceedingly cheap, but all imported articles\r\nare equally dear, because of the absurd protective system already spoken\r\nof, which permits and encourages native manufacturers to make the worst\r\narticles at the highest price, thus of course entailing the most limited\r\nconsumption, and restricts purchases of all commodities that can possibly\r\nbe dispensed with. Amongst hotels, the Braganza, built on an eminence\r\noverlooking the Tagus, stands preëminent, and is part of the Braganza\r\nfamily estate. The bill of fare is attractive, and charges moderate,\r\nregret being felt that travellers by sea cannot go at once to such\r\ncomfortable quarters, instead of to the vile Lazarette, to which they are\r\nnow consigned _en route_ from England or Brazil!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADJUDA PALACE, RESIDENCE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF PORTUGAL,\r\nNEAR LISBON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLISBON TO MADEIRA.\r\n\r\n    Two more days’ pleasant Paddling on the Ocean.—Approach\r\n    to Madeira.—Charming aspect of the Island.—Unique boats\r\n    and benevolent boatmen.—Pastoral progression in bucolic\r\n    barouches extraordinary.—Personal appearance of the\r\n    inhabitants.—Atmospheric attractions of Madeira, and absence of\r\n    all natural annoyances.—The Vine-Blight and its consequences,\r\n    present and prospective, on the people at home and the\r\n    consumption of their wine abroad.—Funchal, and its urban and\r\n    suburban et ceteras.—Romance and reality of the History of the\r\n    Island, ‘Once Upon a Time.’—Importance of English residents\r\n    to the place.—Cost of living, and what you get for your\r\n    money.—Royal and illustrious visitors.—Mercantile matters, and\r\n    consular cordiality.—Grave Reflections in the British Burial\r\n    Ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAUREL TREE, MADEIRA.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE ILLUSTRATION.—Views of Funchal, of the English\r\n    Burial-place, and other objects in Madeira, are so familiar,\r\n    that in preference to any of them, there is here given, as\r\n    being much less hacknied, one representing a small fort or\r\n    outwork, called Loureiro, or the Laurel Tree, on the coast to\r\n    the east of Funchal, being the first of the series copied from\r\n    the portfolio of the gentleman to whom our volume is so much\r\n    indebted for such privilege.\r\n\r\n    Oh! had we some bright little isle of our own,\r\n    In a blue summer ocean, far off and alone,\r\n    Where a leaf never dies in the still blooming bowers,\r\n    And the bee banquets on through a whole year of flowers;\r\n    Where simply to feel that we breathe, that we live,\r\n    Is worth the best joy that life elsewhere can give.\r\n    The glow of the sunshine, the balm of the air,\r\n    Would steal to our hearts, and make all summer there.\r\n    Our life should resemble a long day of light,\r\n    And our death come on, holy and calm as the night.—MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOcean sailing, perhaps, does not present anything more delightful than\r\nthe trip from Lisbon to this island in fine or moderate weather. We soon\r\nbade adieu to the Tagus, with its merry-going windmills, and its palaces\r\nand churches, the bold dome of the Coraçao de Jesus being the last\r\nvisible in the horizon as we steamed away; and, on the second morning at\r\ndaylight, made the Island of Porto Santo, which looks bleak and dreary\r\nenough, but has the repute of having some verdant spots upon it; and a\r\nsmall harbour called by the same name. Madeira, some 35 miles distant,\r\nwas in sight a-head, its mountains peeping out of the clouds; and a\r\ncouple of hours brought us up to the south side, along which we steamed.\r\nThe hills were covered with innumerable cottages, and huts built amongst\r\nthe vine plantations, which rise in ridges, nearly from the water’s edge\r\nto the height of 2,000 feet; the best vine growths, no doubt, being found\r\nat about half that elevation. It is needless to say that the _coup d’œil_\r\nso presented is as charming as it is singular. Immediately after passing\r\nBrazen Head, the Bay of Funchal opened before us, and a more beautiful\r\nsight cannot well be conceived, the hills towering to a considerable\r\naltitude, dotted a long way up with pretty-looking villas and well\r\ncultivated gardens, until, reaching the town, these become merged in\r\nits compact mass. Funchal, which contains a population of some 20,000\r\ninhabitants, bears the usual Portuguese characteristics of white or\r\nfancifully-coloured houses, many being lofty, with look-outs to the sea,\r\nforts, churches, &c. The Loo Rock, commanding the entrance of the bay, is\r\nvery remarkable, being quite separated from the main land, which it there\r\nprotects from the roll of the sea. Here we found lying in the roads,\r\namongst other vessels, two American men-of-war, just come over from the\r\nAfrican station to refresh, as well as the Severn steamer, coaling on\r\nher way from the Brazils to Lisbon and England. This opportunity enabled\r\nus to send home dispatches forthwith. An assemblage of those peculiarly\r\nstrong-built boats, with double keels to protect them from being stove in\r\nby the tremendous swell that sets in-shore so frequently, soon came to us\r\nwith offers of service, chiefly in the shape of miscellaneous matters for\r\nsale; and we found ourselves amongst a pushing, energetic race, anxious\r\nto trade and make money, with an earnestness that was quite refreshing.\r\nMany spoke tolerably good English, and showed evident signs of being\r\naccustomed to deal with our countrymen. Landing on the beach is sometimes\r\na formidable operation here; but the boats, as we have said, are well\r\nadapted for all emergencies incident to the operation, whether performed\r\nby those in robust health, or, as is too frequently the case, by\r\ninvalids, in almost the last stage preceding dissolution. The boatmen are\r\nvery active and obliging on such occasions, and considerate to a degree\r\nthat would be perfectly incredible to a Thames wherry-man at Gravesend.\r\nWe were immediately beset by a crowd of applicants for favours in one\r\nshape or another, amongst whom were not a few beggars, although I believe\r\nthey are prohibited from soliciting alms, and a very good institution\r\nexists for the helpless and houseless. Some of our passengers, with the\r\nprecipitancy of English in all such matters the moment a foreign shore is\r\nreached, proceeded to test the vehicular conveniences of the island, by a\r\ndrive in one of those extraordinary bovine sledges drawn by two bullocks,\r\nand which travel up the hills at a pace sufficiently surprising,\r\nconsidering the apparently sluggish conformation of the steeds.\r\n\r\nI took a ramble over the town, and made sundry diplomatic calls;\r\nafterwards proceeding [aloft, as may be literally said,] to enjoy the\r\nhospitality of Mr. Blandy, who occupies a charming country seat about\r\na mile up the hill, where there is a splendid view of the town and\r\nbay, as well as of the towering mountains above. One of the sleighs or\r\nsledges, just mentioned, carried us along a succession of steep hills\r\nvery quickly, a mode of conveyance which, notwithstanding its primeval\r\nfashion, appears to be of recent date here. This _char rustique_ of\r\nthe mountains resembles, as nearly as possible, one of our turn-abouts\r\nat a fair, with two seats opposite to each other; but the most curious\r\nuses to which this odd contrivance is put, is in coursing down-hill by\r\nexpress train, as they call it. Two persons seat themselves side-by-side\r\nin the sledge, and an equal number of boys, holding a strap attached\r\nto it, commence running down the steep declivities at a pace that must\r\nbe felt to be understood; but an idea of it may be formed by those who\r\nremember the Vauxhall illustration of centrifugal force, some years\r\nago, when an unhappy monkey was placed in a carriage and shot down an\r\ninclined plain, at the bottom whereof was a huge wheel, over and around\r\nwhich the traveller and his vehicle were propelled, and brought to a\r\nstand-still after attaining a level on the other side. The Madeira roads\r\nare paved with sharp stones set very close together; so the machine\r\nglides downwards without meeting with any resistance, and, in ten\r\nminutes, descends a distance that takes half an hour or more to mount on\r\nhorseback. It was the most curious sensation I ever felt; and, though\r\nassured of its safety, one cannot make the experiment for the first time\r\nwithout thoughts of an upset running in one’s head, contact between which\r\nand the stones would not have been very agreeable. Mountainous countries\r\nare doubtless favourable to the promotion of personal activity; and\r\ncertainly the way in which the natives go up and down the steep paths\r\nhere, with burthens on their backs, especially in such a climate, is\r\nsomething remarkable.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the English are fond of Madeira, but a very great\r\nwonder that far larger numbers do not resort thither, to pass the winter\r\nmonths, with the numerous facilities of steam navigation now presented to\r\nthem. The climate, the total change of people and scenery, the teeming\r\nvegetation, yielding the produce both of Europe and the tropics, the\r\npicturesque disposal of the houses on the very ridges of the hills, with\r\nevery regard to comfort and even luxury, all combine to render this a\r\nkind of earthly paradise, to which the seeming rhapsody at the head\r\nof our chapter is really only literally applicable. Here indeed nature\r\nshowers down her choicest bounties: no fogs, miasmas, or even hurtful\r\ndews; atmosphere almost always translucent and bright; the thermometer in\r\nwinter scarcely ever falling below 60 degrees; and where, during the hot\r\nsummer months, a cool and comfortable retreat, of almost any temperature,\r\nmay be found up the mountains. Lastly, there are no poisonous reptiles,\r\nmerely a brown lizard, harmless to everything save the vines; frogs are\r\nquite a recent importation; and so far as I could learn, there are none\r\nof that numerous tribe of annoying insects which infest the tropical\r\nregions, only the familiar household flea, that makes himself at home\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the dependence of the population and the staple of Madeira\r\nhas been its vines, whose produce this year, as well as last, has totally\r\nfailed, from some cause almost as inscrutable, or at least as incurable,\r\nand in its consequences nearly as calamitous, on a small scale, as the\r\npotato rot in isles nearer home. I could not have believed without seeing\r\nit:—in every direction the grapes were withered up like parched peas,\r\nand, in many cases, the trees themselves dying. Such an extraordinary\r\nvisitation has, I believe, never been known here before. It partakes very\r\nmuch of the same virulent character as the diseases that at times affect\r\nthe cereal world, and something of the kind was experienced with terrible\r\nseverity in the Canaries in 1704. Two years’ failure of a vintage, in\r\nan island like Madeira, would be almost annihilation, if it were not\r\nfor its other boundless vegetable resources; and, as in the case of the\r\ndestruction of the Irish root, it is augured that much good may arise\r\nto the people from the increased stimulus to industry so occasioned,\r\nand their being induced not to place too great a dependence on any one\r\nproduct. Still, it is a melancholy sight to behold the support of a whole\r\npeople struck down by such an inconceivable blight. Every means have\r\nbeen tried to arrest its progress, but without success; and, should it\r\ncontinue its ravages, Madeira wine bids fare to become greatly increased\r\nin value a few years hence, when, as a matter of course, it will be\r\nmore in vogue and sought after, than has been the case for a long time\r\nback.[33]\r\n\r\nThe streets of Funchal are narrow, but clean, and intersected by streams\r\nof water, brought also into nearly every large dwelling. Their silence,\r\nowing to the absence of vehicles, strikes the European stranger as\r\nextraordinary; especially at night, when he seems to be placed in a city\r\nof marionettes, as it were; and, from the presence of the palanquin,\r\nbearing fair occupants about, quite an oriental tinge is imparted to\r\nthe aspect of the whole urban scene. Speaking of that, a note on the\r\nphysical attributes of the Madeirans; and we cannot do better than\r\nquote the authority of a gentleman[33]—perhaps we should say a lady, as\r\nit is doubtless her impressions in letter-press that are reflected on\r\nthis point[34]—who is the latest authority on what may be called the\r\n_agremens_ of the island.\r\n\r\nThere are aqueducts made to bring the water from the mountain side, and\r\nseveral deep gullies or ravines run through the town and empty themselves\r\ninto the sea. These cavities being crossed by bridges, the sides have\r\nbeen built up at a considerable expense, and are covered with verdure,\r\ntropical and European, producing a most picturesque effect. They are also\r\nmost beneficial in a sanitary sense, being in fact main arteries for\r\ncirculating pure fresh air, as well as for carrying off the impurities.\r\n\r\nExcepting epidemics, Madeira, both town and country, must naturally be\r\nthe healthiest place in the world, for the reasons already stated. The\r\npopulation of the island is estimated at upwards of 100,000, or, at least\r\nwas so till lately; but there is a good deal of emigration going on, and\r\nowing to the late distress it is likely to increase materially, both to\r\nDemerara and the Brazils, where the natives prove to be most valuable\r\nlabourers.\r\n\r\nThe history of Madeira, or at least its political history, is of no\r\ngreat importance. Like Brazil, it is named after its wood, and so is\r\nits capital, Funchal, from a species of fern abounding in still greater\r\nprofusion than the magnificent timber. A romantic interest belongs to its\r\nearly annals, as it was discovered, it is said, by Mr. Macham, an English\r\ngentleman, or mariner, who fled from England for an illicit amour. He\r\nwas driven here by a storm, and his mistress, a French lady, dying, he\r\nmade a canoe, and carried the news of his discovery to Pedro, King of\r\nArragon, which occasioned the report that the island was discovered by\r\na Portuguese, A.D. 1345. But it is maintained that the Portuguese did\r\nnot visit the place until 1419, nor did they colonise it until 1431.[35]\r\nIt was taken possession of by the British in July, 1801; and again,\r\nby Admiral Hood and General (afterwards Viscount) Beresford, Dec. 24,\r\n1807, and retained in trust for the royal family of Portugal, which had\r\njust then emigrated to the Brazils. It was subsequently restored to the\r\nPortuguese crown.\r\n\r\nThe residence of Englishmen here, is of course highly advantageous to\r\nthe place, and they are welcomed, as they deserve to be, by a poor\r\nbut industrious, and by no means abject or cringing, people. On the\r\ncontrary, the population of all classes are remarkable for their frank\r\nand ingenuous bearing. Living[36] is reasonable; and it is to be hoped\r\nthat thousands, instead of hundreds, of our countrymen, will ere long\r\nfind their way here. The visits of our late estimable Queen Adelaide,\r\nof the Dowager Empress of Brazils, and others of eminent station and\r\ncorresponding means, are dwelt upon with gratitude, as they not only\r\ncaused a considerable circulation of money, but did much good personally.\r\nIn no part of the world can the bounties of nature, or the precious\r\ngift of health be so richly enjoyed, or in a manner so agreeable to\r\nEuropeans, as here. The island has some little commerce with different\r\nplaces, but administered in a manner that renders all we said about\r\nLisbon restrictions, monopolies, and mercantile impediments, applicable\r\nin an aggravated degree, if that be possible; and, of course, until\r\nthings mend there, no improvement can be looked for here. The trading\r\nportion of the community seem to be very social and friendly amongst\r\nthemselves, although not mixing a great deal with the English, or rather,\r\nthe English maintain their constitutional isolation from the natives,\r\nbut with a rigidity which time is rapidly mitigating. The character for\r\nBritish hospitality is fittingly maintained by Mr. George Stoddard, our\r\nConsul, who occupies the palatial residence of a Portuguese noble, and\r\ndispenses the duties of his office in a manner that may well reconcile\r\nthe strictest economist at home to the most inadequate stipend of £300 a\r\nyear attached to it; for the obligations are often irksome, if not very\r\nonerous; and not a few of them arising out of melancholy occurrences, to\r\nwhose frequency the tombstones and monuments in the English burial-ground\r\nbear such significant testimony. This Anglo _Père la Chaise_ of the\r\nWestern Atlantic is one of the first objects visited—and, alas! often the\r\nlast, by the survivors of those whom\r\n\r\n    The verdant rising and the flowery hill,\r\n    The vale enamell’d, and the crystal rill,\r\n    The ocean rolling, and the shelly shore,\r\n    Beautiful objects, shall delight no more.\r\n    Now the lax’d sinews of the weaken’d eye\r\n    In watery damp and dim suffusion lie.\r\n\r\nBidding adieu, however, to these melancholy matters, we again resume our\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMADEIRA TO CAPE VERDS, WITH A GLANCE AT THE CANARIES.\r\n\r\n    Oceanic Sailing again.—Halcyon weather, and modern steaming\r\n    to the _Fortunatæ Insulæ_ of the Ancients.—A stave on the\r\n    saffron-coloured singing birds.—Touching Teneriffe, and\r\n    Miltonic parallel to the Arch-Enemy.—Approach to Porto Grande,\r\n    and what we found there, especially its extensive accommodation\r\n    for steamers.—Deficiency of water the one draw-back.—Something\r\n    concerning Ethiopic Serenaders under the Line.—Promethean\r\n    Promontary extraordinary.—A memento of mortality midway\r\n    in the world.—Portuguese rewards honourably earned by\r\n    an Englishman.—Utility of Consuls in such places.—First\r\n    acquaintance with an earthquake.—Verd Grapes soured by a\r\n    paternal government.—Interchange of news between the Outward\r\n    and the Homeward bound.—A good propelling turn towards a\r\n    brother of the screw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOTEL, FORMERLY CONVENT, TENERIFFE.]\r\n\r\n    Or other worlds they seem’d, or Happy Isles,\r\n      Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,\r\n      Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales,\r\n      Thrice happy isles.—Paradise Lost, Book iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis track is, generally speaking, about the most pleasant in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean; fine sunny weather and fresh north-east trade winds,\r\nwhich blow with tolerable regularity nearly the whole year round,\r\nrendering it very easy sailing indeed, and proportionably agreeable to\r\npassengers, who may be supposed by this time to have attained their\r\nsea-legs. In our case the wind was, unfortunately too light to be of much\r\nuse, as a vessel going from ten to eleven knots, under steam, must have a\r\nvery strong breeze to get a-head of such speed and assist the machinery,\r\nas well as obtain another knot or two. We pass the Canaries (or Fortunate\r\nIsles, as they were called,) to windward, having in view the far-famed\r\nPeak of Teneriffe, upheaving high its giant bulk 12,182 feet, and\r\nkeeping our course direct for St. Vincent. The Canaries are naturally\r\nassociated with our earliest school-boy notions, as the original home\r\nof the charming little universal household songster,[37] to whom they\r\nhave given their name, but here called thistle-finch, and having for its\r\ncompanions the blackbird, linnet, and others of the same tuneful and\r\nnow Saxonized family. The real Canary of these islands, however, the\r\n_Fringilla Canaria_ of Linnæus, and which still abounds here, is not of\r\nthe saffron or yellow colour it attains in Europe; but is, in its wild\r\nstate, the colour of our common field or grey linnet, the yellow hue\r\nbeing the result of repeated crossings in its artificial state amongst\r\nus. The Canaries are amongst several other islands that were known to the\r\nancients, but not discovered by modern Europe until the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century, when, after a brave resistance from the natives, the\r\nSpaniards conquered and have since retained them.\r\n\r\nThough not exactly in the route of the Argentina, nor intended to be\r\ntouched at by any of the company’s vessels, still being comparatively so\r\nnear the Canaries, and especially of that particular one whereof mention\r\nis made by the great English bard, in verse as majestic as the phenomenon\r\nhe speaks of:\r\n\r\n                  On the other side, Satan, alarmed,\r\n    Collecting all his might, dilated stood,\r\n    Like _Teneriff_ or Atlas, unremoved:\r\n    His stature reach’d the sky, and on his crest\r\n    Sat horror plumed.—Paradise Lost, Book iv.\r\n\r\nwe must present a souvenir of our proximity to so celebrated a vicinage;\r\nand we cannot do so in a more graceful or welcome form than the sketch\r\nprefixed to this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Verds consist of seven principal islands, and were tolerably\r\npopulous, but of late years have been subjected to a continuous\r\nemigration to South America and the West Indies, where, like the hardy\r\nmountaineers from Madeira, they are found most useful in tilling the\r\nsoil, and in other laborious occupations; thus demonstrating the\r\nfallacy of the old notion, that laziness is the predominant element in\r\nthe Spanish and Portuguese idiosyncrasy. What appears to be a present\r\ndisadvantage, in regard to this human flight from the Verds, may prove\r\nbeneficial hereafter, when the Ilheos (as they are called) return to\r\ntheir homes, possessed of a little money wherewith to improve their\r\nsocial and moral condition. The islands produce wine, barilla, large\r\nquantities of orchilla weed, and cochineal, the cultivation of which\r\nis rapidly forming a more and more considerable item of export. Steam\r\nnavigation will ere long bring them into much closer commercial contact\r\nwith the world, and enhance the appreciation of their products and\r\nnatural advantages. The climate is fine, though subject to occasional\r\nhigh temperature and frequent droughts. Despite the name Verds,\r\nsuggestive of Arcadian animation, nothing can be more desolate than the\r\nappearance of the islands, as approached from the sea; bold, high rocks,\r\nagainst which the surge breaks violently, with mountains towering in the\r\nclouds, are general characteristics, to which those of the island of St.\r\nVincent offer no exception. On our arrival the weather was thick, with\r\ndrizzling rain, as we made Porto Grande; and only cleared up in time to\r\nenable us to see Bird Island, a most remarkable sugar-loaf rock, standing\r\nright in the entrance of the bay, after passing which we reached the\r\nanchorage ground in a few minutes. A more convenient little harbour can\r\nhardly be imagined, being nearly surrounded with hills (or mountains as\r\nthey may be called), which protect it from all winds save the westward,\r\nwhere Bird Island stands as a huge beacon, most admirably adapted for\r\na light-house, and on which it is to be hoped one will soon be placed.\r\nThere is deep water close to the shore on most sides of the bay, that\r\nwhere the town is built being the shallowest; and here some wooden\r\njetties are run out, having very extensive coal and patent fuel _depôts_\r\nclose at hand, where these combustibles are put into iron lighters, and\r\nsent off to the vessels. So beautifully clear is the water in the bay\r\nthat you can see the bottom at a depth of from twenty to thirty feet,\r\nliterally alive with fish of all kinds, but for which the people seem to\r\ncare very little, either for home consumption or export, though there is\r\nno doubt that, in the latter direction, a large business might be done\r\nwith profitable results.\r\n\r\nPorto Grande must become a most important coaling station, situated as\r\nit is midway between Europe and South America, and close to the African\r\ncoast. Several important steam companies have already adopted it, viz.,\r\nthe Royal Mail (Brazil), the General Screw, the Australian, as also the\r\nSouth American, and General Steam Navigation Company, whilst occasional\r\nsteamers are, likewise, glad to touch at it. At the period of which I am\r\nwriting, the Great Britain was the last that coaled here, on her way\r\nto Australia. In order to meet this increased demand, a proportionate\r\ndegree of activity and exertion is observable on shore; and a large\r\nnumber of iron lighters, carrying from 15 to 40 tons each, are now\r\nin constant requisition, loaded, and ready to be taken alongside the\r\nsteamers the instant they cast anchor. Unfortunately, there is a very\r\npoor supply of water, the want of it having been the occasion of frequent\r\nemigration in the history of the islands; but it is understood to be\r\nattainable at a slight expense; and a small outlay conjointly made by\r\nthe steam companies might not only procure a plentiful provision of this\r\nall-necessary element, but also other conveniences, essential to the\r\ncomfort of passengers. There is no doubt that, as the place progresses,\r\nsupplies of meat, fruit, and vegetables, will be forwarded thither\r\nfrom the neighbouring islands, which are so productive that there is a\r\nconsiderable export of corn; and the cattle are numerous. Until lately,\r\nfowls were only a penny a piece; and turtles abound. Hitherto there has\r\nbeen no regular marketable demand for such things; but one, and a large\r\none too, is henceforth established, from the causes assigned, and will\r\ndoubtless be regularly and economically supplied. The labourers here are\r\nchiefly free blacks and Kroomen, from the coast of Africa, most of whom\r\nspeak English, and chatter away at a great rate, as they work in gangs,\r\nwith a kind of boatswain over them, who uses a whistle to direct their\r\ntoil—the movements of all the race of Ham to the days of Uncle Tom, being\r\nseemingly susceptible of regulation to musical noise of some sort or\r\nother; whether the ‘concord of sweet sounds,’ or what would appear to be\r\nsuch to more refined ears, does not greatly matter.\r\n\r\nBut for want of vegetation in its neighbourhood, a more picturesque\r\nlittle bay than Porto Grande can hardly be conceived. Towering a short\r\ndistance above the town, is a kind of table mountain, some 2,500 feet\r\nhigh; and at the opposite side, forming the south-west entrance, is\r\nanother very lofty one, remarkable as representing the colossal profile\r\nof a man lying on his back, _à la_ Prometheus. He has his visage towards\r\nheaven, wherein there are generally soaring vultures enough to devour\r\nhim up were he a trifle less tender than volcanic granite. The features\r\nare perfect, even to the eyebrows; and a very handsome profile it makes,\r\nthough it does not appear that any tropical Æschylus has yet converted\r\nthe material to the humblest legendary, much less epic, purpose. On the\r\nshore ground, forming the right side of the bay, looking towards the\r\ntown, there is a neat little monument, erected to the lamented lady of\r\nColonel Cole, who died here on her way home from India. The spot where\r\nshe lies is, from its quietude and seclusion, most meet for such a\r\nresting-place, there being a small, conical hill behind, with a cottage\r\nor two near, and a sprinkling of vegetation on the low ground between,\r\nserving to ‘keep her memory green’ in the mind of many an ocean voyager\r\nin his halt at this half-way house between the younger and the elder\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThis little town was thrown back sadly by the epidemic which afflicted\r\nit in 1850 and decimated the population. During its continuance Mr.\r\nMiller, one of the few English residents, did so much in assisting the\r\ninhabitants, as to elicit from the late Queen of Portugal the honour of\r\na knighthood, in one of the first orders in her dominions. It requires\r\nno small degree of patience and philanthropy to aid the development\r\nof a place like this, labouring, as it does, under such great natural\r\ndifficulties, and where everything has to be brought from a distance,\r\nthere not being a tree or a blade of grass to be seen—nothing but dry,\r\narid sand, or a burnt-up kind of soil. Undoubtedly, the heat is very\r\ngreat at times; and there are about three months of blowing, rainy\r\nweather, which is the only period when vessels might be subjected to\r\ninconvenience whilst coaling, as the southerly winds drive up a good\r\ndeal of sea into the bay. There is an English Consul resident here, Mr.\r\nRendall, who has done much to assist in bringing these islands into\r\nnotice, and into comparative civilization; and, by so doing, has many\r\ntimes over reimbursed this country in the cost of his stipend of £400 a\r\nyear, saying nothing of the services he has performed to shipping, in the\r\nordinary discharge of his duties.\r\n\r\nCape Verds are a very numerous family of islands, called after a\r\ncape on the African coast (originally named Cabo Verde, or Green\r\nCape, by the Portuguese) to which they lie contiguous, though at a\r\nconsiderable distance from each other in some cases. All are of volcanic\r\nformation—one, that of Fogo, or Fuego, once very celebrated as being\r\nvisible, especially in the night time, at an immense distance at sea.\r\nThe islands generally do not possess any very attractive points, being\r\nunlike Madeira and the Canaries in this respect, as well as in extent of\r\npopulation, that of the latter being four or five times more numerous\r\nthan the others—say about 200,000 in one, 40,000 in the other case,\r\nthough some statements make the inhabitants of the Verds considerably\r\nmore. The islands are occasionally subject to shocks of earthquakes;\r\nand there was rather a strong one at Porto Grande the night before we\r\nleft, supposed on board our vessel to be thunder, from the noise it\r\nmade, though we were not aware until next day that a shock had been felt\r\non shore. The chief product is salt, a valuable article for vessels\r\ntrading to South America, though it is here manufactured by the somewhat\r\nprimitive process of letting the sea-water into the lowlands, where\r\nthe sun evaporates it. Though Porto Grande, in St. Vincent, is the\r\ngreat place for shipping, and as such almost the only place of interest\r\nfor passengers in transit, Ribeira Grande, in St. Jago, the principal\r\nisland, and most southerly of the group, is the chief town, though it\r\nis at Porto Playa, (often touched at by ships on the Indian voyage),\r\nthat the Governor General resides, particularly in the dry season. The\r\nisland second in importance, in point of size, is St. Nicholas, where\r\nare some small manufactories, in the shape of cotton-stuffs, leather,\r\nstockings, and other matters. The orchilla weed, however, is the great\r\nobject of governmental interest, and its monopoly is said to yield some\r\n£60,000 per annum; the same wise policy that grasps at that interdicting\r\nthe manufacture of wine, though grapes grow in profusion, and are of\r\nexcellent quality for the production of a very acceptable beverage.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Porto Grande we had the satisfaction of seeing the General\r\nScrew Company’s fine vessel, the Lady Jocelyn, arrive on the day she was\r\ndue from India and the Cape of Good Hope, on her way to Southampton, with\r\nmails, and upwards of one hundred passengers. I went on board to give\r\nthem the latest news from England, which was of course very acceptable,\r\nand the columns of the leading journals were eagerly devoured. In\r\nexchange I received the ‘Cape News,’ which did not contain anything very\r\nparticular, all being quiet there, our old perturbed friend, Sandilli,\r\nand his ebonized insurrectionists of the hills having apparently subsided\r\ninto lilies-of-the-valley of peace and philanthropy. The fine steamers\r\nbelonging to the General Screw line appeared destined to convey a large\r\nportion of passengers between England and India, in preference to the\r\noverland route; and, certainly, when one could make the passage in about\r\nsixty days, direct, without change of conveyance, and with such splendid\r\naccommodation and such conveniences as these vessels afford, it was only\r\nnatural that they should fill well; and a more comfortable, happy-looking\r\ngroup of passengers I never saw in any vessel.\r\n\r\nBut, alack for the worthlessness of such moralizings and anticipations\r\nas these. This enterprising company have been obliged to abandon their\r\nIndian contract, owing to their coaling expenses being out of all\r\nproportion to the small sum they received for conveying the mails.\r\nThe Cape of Good Hope contract, too, will most likely be given up, to\r\nthe great detriment of that important colony, and at the rate we are\r\nprogressing, steam communication to Australia does not promise to require\r\nthe coaling facilities of St. Vincent; still we are of opinion that this\r\nisland must increase in importance, and that whenever coal freights\r\nrevert to a moderate scale, steamers will gather there to and from the\r\nSouthern Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCAPE ST. VINCENT TO PERNAMBUCO.—A WORD ON THE CLIMATE OF THE BRAZILS.\r\n\r\n    Progress from Porto Grande to Pernambuco.—Steam triumphs\r\n    against adverse wind.—Further Superiority of Screw over\r\n    Sail.—The Argentina in a South-Wester.—_Apropos_ of Malaria,\r\n    and something sanitary about Brazil.—The yellow fever:\r\n    whence it comes, and what has become of it?—Quarrels about\r\n    Quarantine.—Brazil in advance of the old country in these\r\n    matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Porto Grande, we shaped our rapid course southwards, to the\r\nBrazils, across the wide expanse of ocean lying between the two\r\ncontinents, and in all which prodigious waste of waters there is no port\r\nof call nearer than St. Helena, latitude, 15 deg. 55 min. S., long.,\r\n5. 44 E., unless we except the turtle-famed Island of Ascension, 800\r\nmiles N.E. of the Bonapartean place of exile, which itself is 1,200\r\nmiles from the coast of Lower Guinea. The trade winds vary a good deal\r\nin their extension towards the line, and in these latitudes commence\r\nthe difficulties of a sailing ship, which has to deal with calms and\r\nvariable winds, blowing from all points of the compass, until such time\r\nas it catches the south-east trade, and is carried onwards. Our course\r\nlay towards Pernambuco, a place I visited for the first time upwards of\r\nthirty years back, and where I have often been since, but never in a\r\nsteamer; and only those who have experienced the difference between the\r\ntwo modes of propulsion, wind alone and steam, can fairly appreciate the\r\nvalue of the latter power. In former years, 40 to 50 days were considered\r\nan average passage to Pernambuco, lately reduced to about 30 to 35 by\r\nclipper-vessels, whilst a steamer will traverse the distance easily in 20\r\ndays, including stoppages to coal, and for any other requisite purpose.\r\nThe consequence is, that numbers pass to and fro, who would never do so\r\nbut for the facilities thus afforded, and which afford at the same time a\r\nfurther evidence of the trite truth, already frequently dwelt upon, and\r\nwhich will have to be still more frequently repeated, before we come to\r\na close, that steam navigation becomes the great civilizer of the world,\r\nand brings distant nations so much nearer to our own shores.\r\n\r\nOur run from St. Vincent to Brazil was a very hard one. Losing the\r\ntrade-wind the day after that on which we left the island, it was\r\nreplaced by an implacable south-wester, against which our little vessel\r\nsteamed vigorously, and we could barely carry fore and aft canvas. When,\r\nafter eight days’ tugging we arrived at Pernambuco, there was not an\r\nhour’s coal left, a consideration which naturally rendered all on board\r\nanxious for some short time before. We shaved close past the Island of\r\nFernando de Noronha, showing a conical hill, very like a ship under\r\ncanvas at a distance. It is a penal settlement of Brazil, and considered\r\nvery healthy.\r\n\r\nBefore describing other ports of call on our way to the River Plate,\r\nlet us just take a glance at the Empire of Brazil, which, from its\r\ngeographical position, immense fertility and internal resources,\r\nis second only in importance to the great Empire of the West—the\r\nUnited States of North America. And, first, in regard to that primal\r\nconsideration, health, as affected by the climate—a subject on which\r\nmany years’ experience in my own person, and an attentive observation of\r\nthe health of various classes of Europeans in the tropics enable me to\r\nspeak with as much weight as should probably attach to the opinion of the\r\nmajority of non-medical men on a medical topic; and some remarks on that\r\nhead in the chapter on Pernambuco will probably be found not altogether\r\nunworthy of the attention even of the faculty.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its well-known heat, in common with all other countries\r\nwithin the tropics, and especially a country so large a portion of which\r\nis directly beneath the equator, until within the last few years Brazil\r\nhas been proverbially one of the healthiest climates in the world, and\r\nEuropean residents could indulge almost with impunity in the pleasures\r\nand luxuries of tropical life. Unfortunately yellow fever has changed\r\nall this, and rendered the vital statistics of the harbours and cities\r\nof the empire mournful catalogues of suffering and disaster, threatening\r\nserious injury to its national prosperity, if the scourge does not soon\r\nfinally depart from its shores. This, it is devoutly hoped may be the\r\ncase, and fortunately seems to be so at present, as far as can be augured\r\nfrom the reports now continued for a considerable time. During over\r\nthirty years’ acquaintance with, and frequent residence in the country, I\r\nnever experienced or heard of any existing epidemic worthy of the name,\r\nor such as could not be readily accounted for; but the aspect of things,\r\nat the period of my last arrival, had sadly indeed changed, and the dread\r\npestilence in its ravages seemed to spare neither the hardy European\r\nmariner, the native resident, the blacks, nor indeed any class of\r\npersons brought within its influence. How or from whence this mysterious\r\nvisitation had arisen it was impossible to say. Some maintain that it was\r\nbrought from the coast of Africa, and is a kind of retributive punishment\r\nfor the iniquitous traffic in human flesh carried on so extensively in\r\nthe Brazils, until lately, that the government have shown themselves\r\ndetermined to put it down. But those who argue in this fashion forget\r\nthat the same doctrine would apply in a thousand instances at home and\r\nabroad; that the exceptions are unfortunately more numerous than the rule\r\nwhich would be thus set up by human presumption for the admeasurement of\r\nthe justice of Omniscience; and that it is always imprudent, to say the\r\nleast of it, to attempt to interpret the causes of such dispensations of\r\nProvidence by our own notions of human requirement. Others deny the fever\r\nto be either epidemic or contagious, affirming that it must be induced by\r\nsome peculiar atmosphere, generated, no one knows how, on the sea coast;\r\nand it certainly is curious enough that vessels have had the sickness on\r\nboard, whilst coming down the coast, before even touching at a Brazilian\r\nport. Whatever be the true cause of this affliction, it ought to teach\r\nthe Brazilians a lesson not to abuse the bounties of Providence, which\r\nthey enjoy in almost unexampled profusion, or neglect those means of\r\nsanitary protection which are needful even in the healthiest portions\r\nof Europe. No doubt much is required to be done in this way, and not\r\nin trying to enforce stupid quarantine regulations, which only add to\r\nsuffering without arresting the arm of the devastator. Indeed, the\r\nBrazilian government has shown great good sense in eschewing the absurd\r\nformalities in question, therein again exhibiting an immense superiority\r\nof intelligence over the mother country; for at Lisbon all the antiquated\r\nand superannuated encumbrances and ceremonials are rigorously exacted,\r\nthough there be not even the shadow of a pretext for enforcing them; for\r\nalthough a ship’s bill of health may be perfectly clean, and although the\r\nports she last sailed from may have been long known to be uninfected,\r\nstill the circumstance of their having been once tainted is sufficient\r\nwarrant for the Portuguese procrastinators in exacting any amount of\r\ndetention that may be agreeable to their caprice, whether the vessel be\r\nsail or steamer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE OF BRAZIL.\r\n\r\n    “Stern winter smiles on this auspicious clime;\r\n    The fields are florid in eternal prime;\r\n    From the bleak pole no winds inclement blow,\r\n    Mould the round hail, or flake the fleecy snow;\r\n    But from the breezy deep the groves inhale\r\n    The fragrant murmurs of the eastern gale!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEMPIRE OF BRAZIL.\r\n\r\n    Rather prefatory and not very particular, though somewhat\r\n    personal.—Books on Brazil should be in _Mediam Viam_ for the\r\n    present route, avoiding the Scylla of extreme succinctness\r\n    and the Charybdis of needless diffuseness.—Object of the\r\n    Author to attain the golden medium.—With what success, gentle\r\n    reader, say?—Discovery of the country by the Portuguese.\r\n    Their subsequent disputes with, and final expulsion of\r\n    the Dutch.—Extent and Population; variety of soil and\r\n    produce.—Difficulty of communication between the provinces\r\n    and the capital, in consequence of extreme distance and\r\n    imperfect means of travelling.—Extraordinary instance of\r\n    the roundabout nature of news circulating in Brazil some\r\n    time ago.—Steam corrective of such sluggishness.—A glance\r\n    at the Brazilian littoral, beginning with the Amazon, and\r\n    ending with Rio Grande do Sul.—Pará and its productions.—Rio\r\n    Negro, and its recent political elevation.—Maranham and its\r\n    Mercantile importance.—Laird’s steam leveller, on the singular\r\n    stream of the Itapecuru.—Justice for England by Maranham\r\n    Magistrates.—Piauhy and its products; also Ceara, Rio Grande\r\n    do Norte, and Paraiba.—Pernambuco revisited by the writer, and\r\n    welcomed with a rhythmetical sentimental something concerning\r\n    ‘Long, long, ago!’\r\n\r\n\r\nLet not the reader suppose, from the heading of this chapter, ‘Empire\r\nof Brazil,’ that he is going to encounter either a dilution or a\r\ncondensation of Southey, Kidder, Weech, Mawe, Prince Adalbert, St.\r\nHilaire, and others, who have written at great length and in many\r\nlanguages, on so fertile and so expansive a theme. The object of the\r\nauthor in this portion of the volume is merely, by presenting at a glance\r\nthe position and condition of Brazil generally, to enable those who\r\naccompany him in these pages the more readily to recognize the points\r\nhe is about to put hereafter as the result of his own experience, more\r\nespecially with reference to the machinery of commercial matters in\r\nBrazil. It is often the fault of men very full of a particular subject\r\nthemselves to take for granted that the public either know a very great\r\ndeal, or wish to know everything about it. Brazil has suffered much from\r\nboth these causes in European, and especially in English estimation.\r\nThose familiar with and competent to write about it, have either presumed\r\nthat the public were nearly as wise as themselves, and have passed over\r\nmatters of great interest, believing them to be stale and exhausted,\r\nand dwelling upon the trivialities of personal travel by way of varying\r\na beaten track:—or, on the other hand, the exhaustive process has been\r\napplied, and historic and topographic disquisition have been employed\r\nwith a minuteness that would be only tolerated in English county\r\ngazetteers or family chronicles. The consequence is that all but the\r\nstudent or the virtuoso in such matters have been repelled from their\r\nperusal. When the idea of writing this book occurred to the author—an\r\nidea suggested by frequent inquiries for works that should, in a brief\r\ncompass, give a tolerable notion of things to be met with and that ought\r\nto be known in a route of yearly increasing importance between two\r\nquarters of the globe—it was suggested that he should steer between the\r\ntwo extremes just indicated. He has endeavoured to do so; and without\r\nfurther circumlocution, he places before the reader the means of deciding\r\nwith what success.\r\n\r\nBrazil,[38] as already noticed, was discovered by Cabral on his way to\r\nIndia in 1500 (although it has been asserted that the coast was visited\r\nby Martin Belem in 1484) who at first supposed it to be a large island\r\non the coast of Africa.[39] The reports as to her mineral wealth not\r\nbeing at that time encouraging, little progress was made in colonizing\r\nBrazil until 1542, when the Portuguese rulers sent out Thomas de Souza\r\nas first governor, who built San Salvador, (or Bahia, as it is now\r\ncalled, capital of the province of the same name,) and materially aided\r\nthe mission of the Jesuits in civilizing the Indian population. This\r\nPortuguese possession was afterwards disputed both by the Spaniards\r\nand the Dutch, and the latter succeeded in appropriating several of\r\nthe northern provinces, viz.:—Ceara, Seregipe, Pernambuco, and Bahia,\r\nwhich they held for a considerable time during the 17th century, and\r\ndid much towards the permanent prosperity of the country, by building\r\nforts, enlarging towns, and carrying out a number of useful public works,\r\nwhich remain as monuments of their laboriousness and perseverance to\r\nthis day, especially in the capitals of the two last-named provinces.\r\nMuch gallantry and patriotism were shown by the native Brazilian and\r\nPortuguese residents in their conflict with the Hollanders, ending in\r\nthe final expulsion of the latter from the entire coast, although this\r\nevent may be considered a misfortune to the country itself, in losing so\r\nindustrious and painstaking a race.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian empire extends from about 4 degrees north, to 33 degrees\r\nsouth, latitude; its extreme length is from 2,500 to 2,600 miles, and\r\nbreadth above 2,000 at the widest part; it contains some 2,500,000 square\r\nmiles of territory, comprising every variety of soil and culture, and\r\nis possessed of considerable variety of climate. Its population has\r\nbeen variously estimated at from six to seven millions; but no data\r\nexist from which one can form more than an approximate calculation.\r\nOut of this number, one half may be set down as slaves, and the other\r\nhalf mixed races, from the native-born Portuguese downwards to the pure\r\nIndian. One of the great draw-backs hitherto experienced in administering\r\nthe government of the Brazils has been the distance of the towns and\r\nprovinces from the metropolis, Rio Janeiro; and this has more especially\r\napplied to the northern provinces, from Pará to Pernambuco, where, owing\r\nto the almost constant prevalence of a northerly current, sailing-vessels\r\ntook a very long time in getting down the coast; so that, in the absence\r\nof communication by land, the intelligence of disturbances or temporary\r\nrebellion only reached the seat of government a considerable period after\r\nthe first outbreak. An extraordinary and almost incredible instance of\r\nthis occurred on the occasion of the formidable revolt of the province\r\nof Pará, the first news of which was received at Rio Janeiro by way\r\nof England, sixty days after a British sailing ship had left Pará,\r\nand another recrossed the Atlantic, and anchored in the port of the\r\nBrazilian capital, no ship, within all that period, having been able to\r\nmake way from Pará to Rio against the monsoon and current and wind that\r\nprevails for a great part of the year, blowing from the antarctic circle\r\ntowards the equator. Perhaps the astonishment created by this state of\r\nthings will, however, be triflingly mitigated if the reader will bear\r\nin mind that Brazil is as large as nearly a dozen Great Britains; and\r\nwill also recollect what vagueness, incertitude, and delay characterise\r\nthe receipt of intelligence in London from Constantinople and St.\r\nPetersburgh, notwithstanding special steamers, express trains, electric\r\ntelegraphs, government couriers, and time-and-space-annihilating editors\r\nof innumerable newspapers, at both ends and all along the whole line of\r\noperations. Steam navigation has however in a great measure remedied\r\nthis evil, as it has done so many others; and news is now regularly\r\ntransmitted between Rio Janeiro and Pará by a steam company, liberally\r\nsubsidized by the government, the former being bound to dispatch a\r\nvessel once a fortnight, calling at all the ports. In the absence\r\nof internal roads or communications along the coast, steam must very\r\nproperly be regarded as the main-stay of the executive, at the same time\r\nthat it offers the needful facility for provincial deputies attending\r\nthe sittings of the Rio chambers. Steam, valuable everywhere, is\r\ninvaluable here, and may, indeed, be looked upon as the great civilizer\r\nand regenerator of a country like Brazil, with a sea-coast extending\r\nnearly 4,000 miles from north to south; while other tributary lines of\r\nsteamers are being established in the innumerable bays and rivers. The\r\nnorthernmost point is the mighty Amazon, which is being explored and\r\nopened to general traffic by another steam company, established at Rio\r\nJaneiro, and likewise aided with an ample subsidy from the government;\r\nthough from the terms in which certain North American and other writers,\r\nto some of whom we shall have to allude hereafter, speak of the Brazilian\r\nauthorities, it might be inferred that not a particle of enterprise of\r\nthis kind is tolerated, much less encouraged. Considering that it is\r\nonly 20 years since the first funnel darkened the Brazilian waters,\r\nthis wonder-working agent of steam may fairly be said to be only in its\r\ninfancy, and its progeny will no doubt ere long be greatly multiplied\r\non the coast and up the vast fluvial arteries of the empire. A brief\r\nglance along the littoral boundaries of this almost boundless dominion\r\nwill soon shew the transcendent importance of steam to such a region. The\r\nnorthernmost province of the Brazils is\r\n\r\n_Pará_, with a capital of the same name, otherwise called Belem, situated\r\non the north-eastern bank of the Amazon, 80 miles from its entrance.\r\nFrom the cause already assigned (distance from the seat of government)\r\nthe progress of this important province, containing upwards of a million\r\nsquare miles, much of which is yet unknown, has been greatly retarded\r\nby civil wars and an unruly population. Its chief productions are corn,\r\ncaoutchouc (or gum elastic), ipecacuanha, nuts, &c.; but there is no\r\ndoubt that the navigation of the Amazon will lead to great additional\r\nsources of export, and soon render this province one of the most\r\nflourishing in the empire, as its immense fertility, miscellaneous\r\nproduce, and the incalculable advantages of having the greatest river\r\nin the world traversing its entire length, so well entitle it to be.\r\nThe population, of whom some ten thousand are probably Indians, amounts\r\nto about 350,000. Of their condition, and that of the province and its\r\ncapital, we shall speak in detail under the head of the Amazon; as also of\r\n\r\n_Rio Negro_, an internal province situated on the Amazon, and\r\ncommunicating with the seaport of Pará. It has only lately been raised to\r\nthe dignity of a province.\r\n\r\n_Maranhao_, or _Maranham_, or _San Luiz_, follows on the line of\r\nsea-coast, with a large, well-built capital, similarly named, but is\r\nnot very densely populated, containing probably not more than a quarter\r\nof a million inhabitants to an area of nearly 70,000 square miles, the\r\nsoil being well watered and fertile, and, like nearly the whole of the\r\nBrazilian empire, producing wood of the finest kind for almost every\r\npurpose. It has always been looked upon as a steady-going place, although\r\nits progress has not kept pace with other more favoured provinces to\r\nthe southward. Its chief production is cotton, of which the export\r\nis considerable, averaging about 30,000 bags per annum, and rice and\r\nsarsaparilla also form considerable items. The town is situated on an\r\nisland, some 30 miles from the coast, with rather a dangerous navigation\r\nto it, though of easy access for small vessels, a couple of forts\r\ndefending the entrance. It is said to contain a population of 30,000,\r\nwhich is probably an exaggeration. Its buildings, however, are on a\r\nscale not unworthy of such numbers, and consist of a theatre, hospital,\r\nseveral convents, and schools of a very superior order. About 200 miles\r\nup the River Itapicuru is the important town of Caxias, formerly Aldeas\r\nAltas, and which, though suffering itself considerably in the civil wars\r\nof 1838-40, has nearly double the population of Maranham. Its connection\r\nwith the latter has been greatly accelerated by means of a small steamer\r\nrunning between the two places, and called the Caxiense, built by the\r\nconstructor of the Argentina, Mr. John Laird, of Birkenhead, under\r\npeculiar reservation as to her draught of water; which was not to be\r\nmore than three feet, and even this appears too much for the shallow\r\nplaces in the river during the dry season, though she seems to have\r\nbeen eminently successful in other respects, and of great utility, not\r\nonly in going up and down the river with freight and passengers, but\r\nalso in towing vessels and small craft. The scenery on the Itapicuru is\r\ndescribed as most romantic, the banks being high, and lined with towering\r\ntrees, in many places almost meeting across. The navigation however is\r\nvery uncertain and irregular, as will have been inferred from what we\r\nhave said of the necessity of exceedingly shallow-bottomed steamers, in\r\nthe dry season, when there is not more than from two to three feet of\r\nwater in some places, whilst in the rainy season it will rise to 20 or\r\n30 feet, inundating, or rather irrigating, the country round to some\r\nextent, and rendering it, like the Delta of the Nile, and for the same\r\nreason, uncommonly fertile, so much so, indeed, as to leave little scope\r\nfor industry; for, by merely striking a few plants in the mud, two or\r\nthree crops a-year can be obtained, more than sufficient for the wants of\r\nthe inhabitants. On the banks of the river are many large fazendas, or\r\nestates, where cotton only was formerly grown, but they are now trying\r\nsugar likewise, and with encouraging assurance of remunerative results.\r\n\r\nAscending the river, the first important place arrived at is the Villa\r\nde Rosario, situated in a fertile district, and where many influential\r\nplanters reside. Next in rotation are Paioul and St. Nicholas;\r\nafterwards, there comes Itapicuru-Merim, where vessels, drawing 4 feet\r\nof water can go in the driest season; but beyond the latter-named place,\r\nnot more than two feet and a half. Nearly all the produce shipped at\r\nMaranham comes down this river in canoes, of about 40 tons register,\r\ncarrying 300 bags of cotton; and in the dry season this voyage will take\r\nthree months to perform what the steamer does now in less than four days!\r\nIn the rainy season these river craft will come down much more quickly;\r\nbut the average time then occupied in going up is still greater, owing\r\nto the strength of the freshes in the river, the vessel having to be\r\nhauled up by bodily force, ropes being taken from tree to tree, and\r\nrequiring a crew for the purpose. This slight sketch of the difficulties\r\nattending the navigation of one of the internal rivers of the Brazils by\r\nnative craft, will show what may be effected by steam, even under the\r\nmost unfavourable circumstances of a very shallow stream; and what may we\r\nnot expect from such a communication being established along the mighty\r\nAmazon?\r\n\r\nMaranham was a short time back the scene of a most brutal murder of an\r\nEnglish resident; and, to the credit of the local government, four of the\r\nmiscreants concerned in it were hanged, the force of which observation\r\nwill be understood by those who know the difficulty of administering\r\njustice in a country like Brazil, where, owing to the vast distance of\r\none town from another, and the consequent difficulty of sustaining the\r\nvigilance of pursuit, and the facilities for baffling it, crimes of\r\nthis nature may be expected to go long unpunished, if the perpetrators\r\nbe not caught almost red-handed in the very deed of blood. The acting\r\nPresident of Maranham is represented as most energetic and efficient,\r\nhaving done much to improve the town and maintain civil order in his\r\ndistrict. His official residence is a very fine one, and should have been\r\nmentioned among the imposing structures of the town, or rather city, for\r\nsuch Maranham is, at least in the English sense of the term, being the\r\nresidence of a bishop, and containing an episcopal palace of considerable\r\ndimensions, and of striking architectural appearance. The place, and some\r\nof its people, still retain slight traces of its French origin, having\r\nbeen founded by that nation, as late as the end of the 17th century; and,\r\nit is said, that that language is better spoken in Maranham than in any\r\nother part of Brazil, the capital itself not excepted.\r\n\r\n_Piauhy._—Beyond Maranham lies the little province of this name, which\r\nhas no port or outlet; but in the district of Parahyba, 100 miles to the\r\neastward of Maranham, are extensive plains, extending over 6,000 square\r\nmiles, watered by numerous rivers and covered with cattle, which can be\r\nbought exceedingly cheap. Much carne seca (dried beef) is cured here and\r\nsent to Maranham, as well as cattle, in beautiful condition. It is easy\r\nto imagine what an important element of supply this will be to other\r\nparts of the empire not so well provided, so soon as better means of\r\ntransit exist. Unlike most other portions of Brazil, Piauhy is deficient\r\nin wood; but, in addition to its fine pastures, it produces in great\r\nabundance maize, millet, sugar, rice, cotton, jalap, ipecacuanha, and\r\nsome silver, iron, and lead, but none of these yield anything like what\r\nmay be expected when there is a population something better proportioned\r\nto the area we have named, for at present the inhabitants do not exceed\r\n70,000. Its capital, Oeyras, has but about 3,000 inhabitants, but\r\ncontains some remarkable ecclesiastical evidences of the former presence\r\nof the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n_Ceara_ is a very sandy district, but with a good back country where\r\nmany cattle are bred, but which suffers much from occasional drought.\r\nCeara exports a fair quantity of hides, some cotton, and fustic. The\r\ntown of Aracati is situated on a picturesque river, but with a very bad\r\nbar entrance, on which several vessels have been lost; they, therefore,\r\nnow generally load outside, some miles higher up the coast, where an\r\nindent admits of shelter, and to which the cotton is taken in jangadas\r\n(native craft.) Though the heat in this province is excessive in summer,\r\nthe climate is nevertheless healthy. Its population is somewhat about\r\n200,000; and gold, as well as copper, iron, and salt, is among its yet\r\nvery imperfectly ascertained mineral resources. The town of Ceara is\r\nquite on the coast, and has no harbour, or protection, beyond a reef of\r\nrocks that forms a kind of breakwater, within which vessels can ride at\r\nanchor. It is a curious thing that the reef, of which this constitutes a\r\npart, extends along nearly the whole coast of Brazil, from Cape St. Roque\r\nto the Abrolhos, near Rio Janeiro, and is of the same hard coral nature.\r\nIn many places an entrance through, or a break in the reef, enables\r\nvessels to get to small ports inside, and jangadas can sail along the\r\ncoast, within these reefs for hundreds of miles, entirely protected from\r\nthe sea, which rolls in and breaks upon them with a deafening noise.\r\n\r\n_Rio Grande do Norte_, a name derived from the river which, after an\r\neast course, enters the Atlantic at Natal, its capital, possesses a good\r\nharbour, but has little direct trade, procuring its supplies chiefly from\r\nPernambuco. Compared with any of the provinces already spoken of, it is\r\nwell peopled, there being about 140,000 inhabitants to 32,000 square\r\nmiles. A few cargoes of Brazil wood were formerly shipped here, being\r\nthe best quality produced in the whole empire, and prized accordingly,\r\ntill it fell into disrepute from the causes we have already specified,\r\nin speaking of that once-prized ingredient in the art of dyeing. Like\r\nPiauhy, Rio Grande do Norte is favourable to cattle-rearing; but exports\r\nof that kind, in the shape of hides, tallow, or jerked beef, are scanty,\r\nbecause of the paucity of means of transport.\r\n\r\n_Paraiba_ is a very fertile province, bordering on that of Pernambuco,\r\nand vastly better peopled than the one last described, as it has a\r\npopulation of 70,000 to an area of 9,000 square miles; and cattle of\r\nEuropean breeds are raised in considerable numbers with great facility.\r\nThere is a fine river, some 20 miles in length, leading up to the town,\r\nof the same name as the province, where vessels can load alongside the\r\ntrapixes. The bar entrance is rather intricate, but there is very good\r\nanchorage just inside. Paraiba exports largely of cotton, and also of\r\nsugar and hides. The upper city is extensive, with large, well-built\r\nhouses; while the lower, or commercial part of the town, is also\r\nextremely good, possessing a splendid Government warehouse, and the whole\r\nindicating quondam prosperity, as well as affording additional proof\r\nof the industry and perseverance of the Dutch, who formerly held this\r\nprovince in conjunction with Pernambuco. The treasury, in particular,\r\nis considered a very fine building; its educational establishments are\r\nalso excellent; and in the neighbourhood of the town are some of the\r\nbest-managed coffee plantations probably in the empire.\r\n\r\n_Pernambuco._—We now approach the most flourishing and remarkable\r\nprovince in the Brazils, upon which the writer hopes he may be pardoned\r\nif he descant at some length, as a place intimately mixed up with\r\nall his boyish ideas and first impressions; where he spent many happy\r\ndays, and always returned with considerable pleasure, although, on this\r\noccasion, alas! very few of the old familiar faces he once knew any\r\nlonger arrested his vision, as he cast his eye along the well-known\r\nmart and into the well-remembered homes of other days; for a quarter of\r\na century makes a terrible void indeed in the limited ranks of one’s\r\ncountrymen who take up their abode in such places.\r\n\r\n    Musical the rippling\r\n    Of the tardy current,\r\n    Musical the murmur\r\n    Of the wind-swept trees,\r\n    Musical the cadence\r\n    Of the friendly voices,\r\n    Laden with the sweetness\r\n    Of the songs of old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO PERNAMBUCO HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF THE EMPIRE OF BRAZIL, _Shewing the Line of the_\r\nProjected Railway & Navigable _Upper Level of the_ RIVER SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\n_S Straker lith. 80 Bishopsgate St. London._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPERNAMBUCO.\r\n\r\n    ‘That Strain Again!’—‘It hath a dying fall.’—‘Auld Lang\r\n    Syne, or ’tis thirty years ago.’—Aspect of Pernambuco from\r\n    the Sea.—Tripartite division of the City, Recife, St.\r\n    Antonio, and Boa Vista.—Note on the old town of Olinda\r\n    and its new namesake, the late steamer No. 2 of this A 1\r\n    line.—March of improvement by land and sea, in respect to\r\n    ships and city.—Such Brazilian progress a lesson for West\r\n    Indians.—Frugality and personal activity on the one hand,\r\n    prodigality and vicarial mismanagement on the other, being\r\n    the real difference between the position of the planters in\r\n    either place.—Sugar Manufacturing improvements.—De Mornay’s\r\n    Patent Cane Crushing Mill, and its Merits.—Appreciation of\r\n    the invention in the West Indies as well as Brazil.—Exports\r\n    of Pernambuco to United States.—Political and Martial feeling\r\n    of the Pernambucanos.—Peculiarities of the Population,\r\n    soil, and produce.—Unique effects of rain and drought in\r\n    the Matta.—Hygienic hints to the consumptive and the yellow\r\n    feverish.—Initiation of the Railway Era, by the De Mornays,\r\n    in Pernambuco.—Immense importance of the proposed line, and\r\n    certainty of its success, sustained by British Capital,\r\n    and specially supported by the Emperor personally, and the\r\n    Brazilian executive.—Mr. Borthwick’s report on the project.—The\r\n    writer’s anticipation that it will be successful, and\r\n    expectation that the reader will approve of his suggestion for\r\n    making it so.—Note on Planters’ life in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERNAMBUCO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a trite remark, that there is probably no more permanent or abiding\r\nimpression on the mind than that created by first visiting a country,\r\nwhose climate, people, habits, and ideas, differ essentially from those\r\nwe have been brought up with and are accustomed to regard as a part of\r\nour nature. After a lapse of more than thirty years, the sensations\r\nI experienced on my first arrival here are as fresh in my memory as\r\nif occurring only yesterday. The voyage, which occupied no less than\r\nfifty-six days; the eager anxiety for a sight of land; the first view of\r\nthe foreign port and outlandish looking craft; and then the pilot coming\r\non board with a crew of blacks, seen for the first time; the debarkation\r\namongst strange faces of every possible shade of colour; with the\r\ncuriously formed streets and singular houses, filled with a population of\r\nhues so different from that left behind—every one apparently shouting at\r\nthe top of their voices; whilst hundreds of rainbow-tinted parrots, and\r\nharlequin-skinned animals, more numerous than the managerial knowledge of\r\na boy of fifteen believed had ever appeared out of the Ark, all helped to\r\naggravate the preternatural a perpetual din—the whole scene, as may be\r\nimagined, being such as to become indelibly engraven on such a spectator\r\nfor the remainder of his life. It was a season of eager curiosity and\r\nenjoyment. ‘Youth at the prow and Pleasure at the helm’ look only to the\r\nbright side of life’s river; but neither time nor distance has since\r\ndimmed the halo that seemed then to environ the portals of this first\r\nlaunch into active being. _Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis_;\r\nstill the characteristic peculiarities of a new country and new scenes\r\nremain fixed in our minds, as if no change had ever come over the spirit\r\nof our dream; and such is Pernambuco still to me, though in many respects\r\ngreatly improved, altered, and enlarged, as I shall proceed to show\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nApproaching Pernambuco from the main, it appears, like Venice, to rise\r\ngradually out of the waters, though, unlike the ‘Sea Cybele, fresh from\r\nocean,’ we cannot perhaps exactly descry her ‘tiara of proud towers,’\r\nat least in the sense applied to the mistress of the Mediterranean; but\r\nstill the reality of the resemblance is quite sufficient to justify the\r\ncomparison. You first discern church-steeples, domes, lofty houses,\r\nglittering in the sun; then shipping, and the general features of a\r\ncommercial town, become visible. The harbour is quite a natural one,\r\nformed by a reef of coral rocks, already described as running along\r\nnearly the whole extent of the Brazilian coast, and supposed to be\r\ncontinued inland, where the coast projects beyond the line of the reef.\r\nAt Pernambuco it has positively all the appearance of a wall some yards\r\nwide, just as if erected by the industry of man, and extending along\r\nthe whole sea-front of the town, breaking off the swell of the ocean,\r\nand leaving the water in the harbour or creeks perfectly smooth, except\r\nsometimes at high water, and at periods of high tide, when the sea,\r\nfinding its way over the reef, causes a little bubbling inside. The\r\nentrance is through a kind of break in the reef, which also forms the\r\nmouth of a river, intersecting the town, but not going any great distance\r\ninland;—passing through and rounding the reef, in an instant you are in\r\nsmooth water, and in Pernambuco harbour. The width of the passage is not\r\nmuch above 200 yards, taken from the reef to the shore, and this is lined\r\nwith quays and wharves, which have been much extended of late years, and\r\na dredging-machine is now constantly at work, deepening the channels,\r\nwhich are influenced by the current and freshes of the river. The bar\r\nformerly allowed only of the passage of vessels drawing 14 feet, but,\r\nthey say, it is now quite safe for those of 15 to 15½ feet; and hopes are\r\nentertained that it can be deepened so as to admit the largest class of\r\nvessels, which would be a boon of immense importance to the place.\r\n\r\nThe town, or city, of Pernambuco is divided into three compartments:—the\r\nfirst, called the Recife (literally Reef), being that directly\r\nopposite the reef, and where most of the foreign commercial firms are\r\nlocated; crossing a wooden bridge, is St. Antonio, inhabited chiefly\r\nby shopkeepers; and a well-built and extensive compartment further on\r\nis Boa Vista, to which you cross by another long wooden bridge, but\r\nprotected with a light iron railing at the sides. The river runs under\r\nthese bridges very rapidly at times, and with a snake-like course, almost\r\ninsulating the two first divisions. From Boa Vista good roads branch off\r\nto the country, and a new one has latterly been made to Olinda[40] along\r\nthe margin of the river, lighted with lamps, &c., a very useful and\r\npraiseworthy undertaking on the part of the government.\r\n\r\nThe town is generally well-built; lofty houses whitewashed, with red\r\ntiles, and plenty of verandahs, and windows to admit the cool breezes;\r\nand for miles in every direction, towards the interior, are comfortable\r\nvillas, some very large, and constructed with considerable taste. When\r\nI first came here in 1821 only two or three carriages existed in the\r\nplace, old-fashioned ones belonging to equally old-fashioned Portuguese,\r\nand I should suppose something like the ‘dormeuse’ of the Grand Prior of\r\nAlcobaça, so graphically described by Beckford, when he travelled with\r\nthat dignitary to the grand abbey of Batalha [_vide_ Lisbon, page 36];\r\nnow there are some 200 vehicles, of all sorts and sizes, and many very\r\ngood ones for hire, besides those belonging to private individuals; and\r\nno doubt taste and luxury would be still more extended in this direction\r\nif it were not for the narrow archways through which the Recife is\r\ntraversed.\r\n\r\nIn all respects, Pernambuco has been not only a thriving but an\r\nimproving place, so much so that one who would visit it now for the\r\nfirst time could hardly believe it to be the same town of which Koster,\r\na comparatively short time ago, said that the shops were without\r\nwindows, light being admitted only by the door, and that there were no\r\ndistinctions of trades, and no municipal regulations worthy of being\r\nso called. Extensive waterworks have been constructed, which bring\r\ngood water some distance to the town; and doubtless, in a few years,\r\nit will be lighted with gas. A bank has been established on a safe and\r\nrespectable footing; and the merchants have their news-room, as a sort of\r\nrendezvous for business, instead of an Exchange, whilst extensive quays\r\nhave been formed on the margin of the rivers that would serve as models\r\nfor the conservators of ‘Father Thames.’\r\n\r\nThe increased production of sugar is something marvellous; from 10,000\r\ntons in 1821 to nearly 70,000 during the last year, with the certainty\r\nof a still further progressive increase. And this circumstance is\r\nadduced as an argument, by the old West Indian interest, to show the\r\ngreat injustice of our present Free-trade system, which, they say,\r\nencourages the production of slave to the detriment of free labour. In\r\nthis instance, however, the assertion is quite fallacious; for the truth\r\nis, that whilst this province is the most fertile one in the empire,\r\nfewer slaves have been imported into it than into any other. There is,\r\nmoreover, a large coloured population, a considerable portion of them\r\nbeing analogous to the yeoman class amongst us. The owners of more\r\nextensive properties are industrious and enterprising, and not burthened\r\nwith debts and mortgages, as in the West Indies; they farm their own\r\nestates, so to speak, and live amongst their labourers, overcoming local\r\ndifficulties that would daunt paid agents and attorneys such as swarmed\r\nin Jamaica and all the adjacent islands during the period of their\r\nprosperity. This is the secret of the well-doing of Brazil, and not the\r\nalteration in our fiscal system, although the latter has no doubt acted\r\nas a stimulus to the South American planter to increase his productions,\r\nby which he is enabled to consume more of our manufactures.\r\n\r\nWhether we consider the frugal habits of the planters of Pernambuco,\r\ntheir unremitting attention to their occupation, or their enterprising\r\ndisposition, we shall arrive at the conclusion that, aided by a soil and\r\nclimate second to none in their powers of production, they will very\r\nsoon take the lead among the sugar-producing countries; indeed, the\r\nexcellent improvements introduced by them within a few years upon the old\r\nmethods of manufacture will go far to give them that preëminence. Among\r\nsuch recent improvements I may here more particularly mention that of\r\na very practical centrifugal machine, constructed principally of wood,\r\nand manufactured in the country. Mr. Eustaquio Vellozo de Silveira has,\r\non his estate, Rainha dos Anjos, one of these centrifugals at work, and\r\nwith the best results. A most intelligent and much respected member of\r\nthe General Legislative Assembly, Dr. Domingos de Souza Leao, (to whom\r\nI had the pleasure of being introduced at a ball, in Rio Janeiro, and\r\nof dancing with his sister-in-law), ordered for his estate, Carauna, in\r\n1851, the first mill of an entirely new patent for crushing the canes,\r\ninvented by the Messrs. De Mornay. This cane mill is very simple in its\r\nconstruction; and the owner affirms that it gives a much more powerful\r\npressure to the canes than the old mills. Several others on the same\r\npatent have since been put up in that province, which have proved quite\r\nsuccessful; and it is only this year that others of the same description\r\nwill be erected in the West Indies, the planters of these islands having\r\nbeen made acquainted with the result of the experiments in Brazil. A very\r\nlarge portion of Brazilian produce, both sugar and coffee, is consumed\r\non the continent of Europe and in the United States, as appears by the\r\nreturns for 1853, at the end of the chapter on Rio Janeiro.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that we are not the only customers of Brazil, and\r\nthat it is a mere fallacy to attribute its prosperity to our legislative\r\nmeasures, although the latter were acts of common justice to our growing\r\ntrade with the country, as well as to our own over-taxed population.\r\nUntil the West Indian Islands can exist on principles similar to those\r\nestablished in Brazil, it is idle to suppose that there can be any\r\npermanent or rational prosperity in connection with them.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the province of Pernambuco has long been noted as\r\nthe most go-a-head and enterprising of the empire; and the same spirit\r\nthat has led to these results has also been the cause of much political\r\nfeeling. Several revolutions have occurred here that threatened a\r\ndismemberment of the state; the first, during the old _regime_ of the\r\nPortuguese in 1817, followed by another very serious affair in 1824,\r\nwhen Manuel Carvalho assumed the dictatorship of the province; and\r\na considerable land and sea force had to be sent there before the\r\nrevolution could be repressed, the port being blockaded by the Brazilian\r\nsquadron, under Commodore Taylor, for about six months. Other outbreaks\r\nhave taken place, attended with much bloodshed, the last in 1848, when\r\nthe town had a narrow escape from falling into the hands of a set of\r\nmiscreants, who would first have pillaged and then devastated it with\r\nfire and sword; fortunately for the province, their leader, a man of\r\ntalent and influence, was killed in the outskirts, of the town, and a\r\nsalutary example set by the punishment of his followers. Since then the\r\nprovince has remained perfectly quiet, and apparently with every prospect\r\nof continuing so.\r\n\r\nThe Pernambucanos, as the inhabitants of this province are termed,\r\nhave always evinced a martial spirit, commencing with their determined\r\nand successful resistance to the Dutch in the 17th century; and it was\r\nundoubtedly owing to them that that people were finally expelled. Still,\r\nthis bellicose feeling is apt to endanger internal tranquillity, when\r\nturned in a wrong direction. Happily, the wish to trade and make money\r\nseems now to be the predominant sentiment, and we must hope that it will\r\ncontinue to influence the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nLike all the other provinces, Pernambuco is governed by a President,\r\nselected by the Government at Rio, generally some man of influence\r\nresiding in the district; and there is a provincial assembly appointed to\r\nact under him, as also a municipal and other bodies elected for the local\r\nmanagement of the towns.\r\n\r\nThe coloured and free population of Pernambuco amounts to about 650,000,\r\nand the slave races to about 100,000; of the former, 250,000 inhabit\r\ntowns, and the remainder follow agricultural pursuits. The slaves are\r\nabout equally divided between town and country. There is a striking\r\ndifference between the people inhabiting that part of the province\r\nnearest to the sea and those living far in the interior; and not only do\r\nthe people differ in appearance and manners, but the districts differ\r\ntotally in character and in climate. The sea board, in some parts as\r\nfar inland as 50 miles, goes under the denomination of the ‘Matta,’ or\r\nforest country, and above that it is called Catinga, or Sertao; Catinga,\r\nis the name of a peculiar growth of herbage which there abounds, and\r\nSertao means literally desert, applied to this district on account of\r\nthe peculiar nature of the country, which, being open and unwooded, has\r\nan appearance to warrant such a name. The Sertao is, nevertheless, far\r\nfrom being, as the name might lead one to infer, a barren waste, but,\r\non the contrary, the vegetation surprises even those who, born in the\r\n‘Matta,’ have been nurtured among the wonders of the tropical vegetable\r\nkingdom. In 1846, two years of drought had driven thousands to seek for\r\nfood and water in the ‘Matta,’ and had spread desolation and death among\r\nthousands of those who remained; and the cotton planters, in the hope of\r\nmore abundant showers, opened and planted with fresh cotton plants new\r\nlands every year, on the first appearance of rain. But they were doomed\r\nin each successive season to disappointment, for the little moisture that\r\nfell was in each case but sufficient to make the plants germinate, until\r\nthe return of hot and dry weather parched both ground and foliage. On the\r\nthird year copious rain fell, and although the young plants of former\r\nyears had been literally toasted, and the leaves, together with those of\r\nall the trees and grass throughout the country, had long fallen to the\r\nground, and might be discerned in heaps where they had been whirled by\r\neddies of wind, looking more like mounds of snuff than foliage of trees,\r\nthe rain had hardly slaked the thirsty ground, when all the plants, even\r\nthose longest in the ground, showed signs of vigour in green buds that\r\ndeveloped themselves; and pasture land that had been converted into bare\r\nearth by the incessant rays of a scorching sun, was, as by magic, from\r\none day to another, converted into fields of the most delicate verdure.\r\n\r\nThese distressing droughts in the Sertao are now of far more frequent\r\noccurrence than formerly, and they are attributable to the fatal practice\r\nof clearing and burning large tracts of timber country for the plantation\r\nof cotton and maize; for, owing to the peculiar nature of the soil, this\r\nland never again becomes wooded; and, being soon unfit for tillage, it is\r\nconverted into pasture land, and devoted to the grazing of horned cattle\r\nand horses. The ‘Matta’ is not subject to a dearth of rain, because,\r\nunlike the ‘Sertao,’ it is still covered by the most magnificent forests;\r\nand what is worthy of remark is, that here, unlike the former district,\r\nthe land after clearing becomes again clothed with dense wood, although\r\nof an entirely different species to that felled in the first instance.\r\nThe primitive forest is called ‘Matta Virgem,’ and that of second growth\r\n‘Capoeira.’\r\n\r\nThere is little difference in the temperature of the two districts of\r\nwhich we have been speaking; perhaps the sun in the ‘Sertao’ is more\r\npowerful than in the ‘Matta.’ In the shade in either place it rarely\r\nexceeds 85 degrees of Farenheit; but the average heat for the 24 hours\r\nin the ‘Sertao’ is considerably below that of the ‘Matta.’ The former,\r\nhowever, has a totally different climate to the latter; while that is\r\ndry, and peculiarly healthy, this is humid, and produces in natives and\r\nforeigners both remittent and intermittent fever. The ‘Sertanejos’ are\r\na remarkably fine and healthy race; but those of the ‘Matta,’ weak and\r\nsickly.\r\n\r\nA very singular circumstance attended the visitation of the yellow fever\r\nto the seaport towns of this province some years back; viz.:—that it\r\nproved as fatal to the ‘Sertanejos,’ who came down to the coast, as to\r\nEuropeans freshly arrived by sea from cold climates. Another remarkable\r\npoint about the climate of the ‘Sertao,’ and one that is deserving of the\r\nattention of English physicians is, that the most surprising relief is\r\nexperienced by consumptive patients, who are sent there from the coast by\r\nthe native doctors, on breathing the exhilarating air of this peculiar\r\nclimate. I have heard of numerous cases of men going up apparently in the\r\nlast stage of the complaint, and in a few weeks becoming quite strong,\r\nand so stout that they could not get on the clothes they had taken with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe most vital question affecting the development of the resources of\r\nBrazil just now is the promotion of railway undertakings. The first\r\nmovement has been made at Rio Janeiro, where a short line of about ten\r\nmiles opens a communication between the city and Petropolis, a thriving\r\nlittle establishment up the mountains, where the Emperor has a palace.\r\nOther extensive lines are projected from Rio; but as regards local\r\nadvancement, that from Pernambuco, southwards, offers the strongest\r\ninducement to individual enterprise, and there is every chance of this\r\none being at once proceeded with; for the design was conceived and\r\nthe plan matured by accomplished English engineers, long resident in\r\nBrazil, though principally occupied in pursuits of the kind mentioned in\r\nconnection with improvements in sugar plantations. Such plans have been\r\nrevised and approved of by a distinguished consulting engineer, expressly\r\ndespatched by British capitalists for that purpose from London; and on\r\nthe strength of whose report (to be referred to presently) the necessary\r\nfunds for all preliminaries are being advanced; and, lastly, the Imperial\r\nGovernment of Brazil has made the most liberal concessions on behalf of\r\nthe project, in which the Emperor has personally most warmly interested\r\nhimself, having examined the whole of the drawings pertaining to it\r\nwith that minute, and, it might be almost said, intimate _practical_ or\r\nprofessional knowledge which his Majesty, as is well known, brings to\r\nbear on all investigations of the kind, being probably the best informed\r\nprince living in the theory of scientific pursuits and in general\r\nliterature, as we shall have occasion to mention when speaking of the\r\nCourt of Rio in the next chapter but one.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the difficulties of transit here, it must be borne\r\nin mind that nearly every article of import and export has to be conveyed\r\non the backs of horses to and from the towns, as mentioned; so that the\r\nexpense of transport, when the distance to be traversed is considerable,\r\nis often equal to the value of the article conveyed.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Pernambuco Railway is to have three divisions:—1st, from\r\nthe city to Agua Preta, a distance of 75 miles, and comprising within\r\nits range some 300 sugar estates; 2nd, from Agua Preta to Garanhuns,\r\na distance of 85 miles, passing through an extensive cotton district;\r\n3rdly, from Garanhuns to Paulo Affonso, the falls of the great river\r\nSan Francisco, 100 miles, a fine and extensive cattle district. The\r\ntotal distance would thus be 360 miles; but it is only intended to\r\ncommence with the first division of the line, which will afford immense\r\nconvenience to the planters and others brought within its scope, enabling\r\nthem to send their produce to market at a moderate cost, and to keep\r\nthe men, at present required to accompany the horses, employed in\r\nvaluable labour on the spot. Moreover, the planters and their families\r\nwill then travel backwards and forwards much more frequently between\r\ntheir estates and the city, transact their business, and make their own\r\npurchases, whilst the great internal resources of the country will be\r\nbrought into play, and all will be large gainers by the facilities thus\r\nafforded. The ground is in general favourable for the construction of the\r\nrailway; there are few rivers to cross, none of them deep, whilst there\r\nis a population computed at 60,000 free persons (white and coloured)\r\nand 15,000 blacks, besides some 50,000 inhabitants of villages, &c.,\r\nthat will be brought within the scope, without taking into consideration\r\nthe population of Pernambuco itself, which is about 100,000. It is,\r\ntherefore, clear that few countries possess such strong inducements for\r\nthe establishment of railway communication as Brazil; for at present she\r\nis destitute of internal roads, at the same time that she teems with\r\nvaluable natural productions, and a healthy vigorous population. It is,\r\nin fact, quite a virgin country in many respects, and capable of infinite\r\ndevelopement in resources, commerce, and their natural concomitant,\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nMr. Borthwick in his admirable report, in the course of which he pays a\r\nhigh and deserved compliment to the Messrs. De Mornay, who first broached\r\nthe scheme, and subsequently most carefully surveyed the ground of the\r\nsection for which they have obtained the concession, viz., from Recife\r\nto Agua Preta, says, that a grand internal communication between the\r\ncapital and the most thriving provinces is of such obvious importance as\r\nto be only a question of time, and the way is pointed out by the natural\r\nfacilities of the San Francisco, extending for so great a distance, and\r\nserving so large and rich a territory.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the immense importance of the connection, by\r\nmeans of a railroad, of the River San Francisco, at some point above the\r\nfalls of Paulo Affonco, with the seaport of the Recife, by referring to\r\nthe accompanying map, showing the course of that majestic river. From the\r\nrapids, in connection with the Falls, this river is navigable to the bar\r\nof the Rio das Velhas, in the heart of the province of Minas Geraes, a\r\ndistance of more than 700 miles; numerous considerable tributary rivers\r\nincrease the extent of continuous navigation to nearly 2,000 miles.\r\nA large portion of the commerce of Minas Geraes, all that of Goiaz,\r\nand Matto Grosso, and much of Piauhi, Bahia, and Pernambuco, would be\r\nconveyed by this new channel, increasing, in an incredible manner, the\r\npresent trade, and developing sources of wealth and profit at present\r\ntotally unknown or unheeded.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened views of the Brazilian government point to an early\r\nconsummation of these great arteries of prosperity and riches, so soon\r\nas political and monetary affairs in this country become settled. It\r\nhas wisely undertaken to guarantee a certain per centage on the outlay\r\nnecessary for making the lines, until such time as they are self-paying,\r\nof which no reasonable doubt can exist in the mind of any one who has\r\nstudied the question fully and fairly. But even supposing this not to be\r\nthe case, and the government had to incur a permanent guarantee for the\r\nconstruction of the lines, the return in other ways, and the direct and\r\npositive benefit conferred by them on the population, are too obvious to\r\nrequire comment. Steam navigation and railways are, as already repeatedly\r\nobserved, the great desiderata of the empire of Brazil; and, in now\r\ntaking my leave of Pernambuco, I devoutly hope, if ever I revisit the\r\nplace, to find these potent civilizers of mankind in active operation. It\r\nmust not be lost sight of by those who may be dubious as to the success\r\nof railway enterprise in such a country, that the inhabitants are a\r\nvery social, travelling people; that there is a great intermingling of\r\nfamilies in the provinces that would be sure to give rise to constant\r\nexcursions by rail, to and fro, between given points; and, in fact, that\r\nall the elements of railway success are at present to be found, only\r\nawaiting the appearance of the lines which would successively call them\r\ninto operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHORA MENINAS—THE PLACE OF THE WAILING CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE SECOND ILLUSTRATION.—DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE\r\n    BRAZILIAN PLANTERS.—Chora Meninas, the place represented in the\r\n    second of the larger sketches in this chapter on Pernambuco, is\r\n    in the environs of the city of the Recife, situated at an angle\r\n    formed by two high roads, both leading to localities much liked\r\n    by the foreign merchants, and consequently selected by them for\r\n    their country residences. The road shown in the engraving leads\r\n    to the Magdalena Bridge, over the river Capibaribe, beyond\r\n    which the Sitios, or country houses, thickly scattered on\r\n    either side, with their mango, bread-fruits and orange trees,\r\n    and their fragrant flowery shrubs, convey to the stranger\r\n    most pleasing sensations as he rides leisurely past them. The\r\n    other road turn to the right of Chora Meninas, and passing\r\n    the Manguinho, leads to the Ponte d’Uchoa, the other locality\r\n    much frequented by foreigners. The two places lie, indeed, in\r\n    the vicinity of the same river, the Capibaribe, the one on the\r\n    right bank, and the other on the left. Chora Meninas means,\r\n    literally, the Place of Wailing Infants, an appellation given\r\n    to it from the spot having been the scene of much bloodshed in\r\n    a civil conflict in times gone by, when the children of the\r\n    slain filled the air with their lamentations over the bodies\r\n    that strewed the ground. The edifice shown in the sketch\r\n    was once the dwelling house of the owner of a sugar factory\r\n    situated on that spot, and the chapel was erected by the\r\n    planter. The buildings are old, and it is many years since the\r\n    plantations of canes have been discontinued there, as suburbs\r\n    of the increasing city of Pernambuco have encroached upon the\r\n    lands. No vestige even now remains of the out-buildings, once\r\n    destined for the manufacture of the sugar. The dwelling and\r\n    chapel are built in the ancient Portuguese style, and exhibit\r\n    signs of Moorish architecture in various parts. The house is a\r\n    very good sample of many to be found upon the old sugar estates\r\n    that are in the hands of rustic proprietors, who are very far\r\n    behind in all those things that indicate an advanced state\r\n    of civilization. The low roofs, the small unglazed windows,\r\n    situated under the very eaves of the building, the lean-to\r\n    roof over a long veranda, the unceiled rooms, the uninhabited\r\n    ground-floor, partly used for store rooms, and partly abandoned\r\n    to toads and serpents, and to the sheep and goats, which, as\r\n    well as a decrepid ox or two, will, at times, enter by the\r\n    doorless apertures to procure shelter from the heavy tropical\r\n    rains,—all are characteristics of many of the residences of\r\n    the less educated planters, who were born and bred to the\r\n    occupation of cane-planting, as their fathers and grandfathers\r\n    were before them. If some old and comfortless brick building\r\n    does not exist upon the estate, you will find the planter\r\n    domiciled in an edifice of his own constructing. It will then\r\n    consist of but few rooms, all on the ground-floor. These will\r\n    not be ceiled, neither will the partition walls be carried up\r\n    to the roof, so that in one apartment everything is overheard\r\n    that passes in the others. Often has the writer of this note\r\n    had to occupy for the night one of these small partitions,\r\n    without even a window or aperture to admit the light, and has\r\n    had to listen to many a curtain lecture, while lying on a camp\r\n    bedstead or stretcher, rolled up in a piece of printed calico\r\n    in his uncomfortable dormitory. The following is a specimen\r\n    of many occurrences of the kind that may be witnessed by a\r\n    traveller when quartered at such plantations.—_Wife._ Zuza,\r\n    have you bolted the strangers in? _Planter._ No, I forgot it;\r\n    but never mind. _Wife._ Never mind, indeed! but I do mind.\r\n    Gertruda! _Black Girl._ Nhora! (meaning senhora). _Wife._ Get\r\n    up, and bolt the door in the passage leading to the stranger’s\r\n    room. _Black Girl._ Nhora, sim, (meaning, sim, senhora.) Pause,\r\n    during which the stranger hears somebody in his room, and\r\n    heavy articles being moved across the floor, and he asks who\r\n    is there? _Wife._ Gertruda, you baggage! what are you doing?\r\n    Why don’t you bolt the door? _Gertruda._ There are some things\r\n    in the way, and I can’t shut it.—A pack saddle, two panniers\r\n    full of dried beef, and half a cask of salt cod-fish have\r\n    been lying near the door, inside the unfortunate stranger’s\r\n    room, the aroma from the beef and fish being more intolerable\r\n    than any one not having slept under similar circumstances can\r\n    possibly conceive. At last the impediments are removed, the\r\n    door is heard to close, the bolts are drawn, and the stranger\r\n    would compose himself to sleep, in spite of what has passed, of\r\n    beef and fish, but he is still irritated by the lady avowing to\r\n    the unfortunate slave that she is a shameless hussy, and that\r\n    a dozen blows with the palmatorio in the morning will no doubt\r\n    improve her morals and her agility.\r\n\r\n    The meals and other domestic arrangements on these plantations\r\n    are of a piece with the dwelling. The dinner is served to the\r\n    stranger and the male members of the family only, and consists\r\n    of broth and a portion of the contents of the above-mentioned\r\n    panniers, with perhaps the addition of a little fresh beef; but\r\n    this, having been several hours on the fire to make the broth,\r\n    is not easily separated from the other. This dish fills a plate\r\n    to the very outside, and is well piled up, and another plate\r\n    equally well filled with pirao, made of manioc flour, mixed\r\n    with some of the broth, and formed into an unctuous sort of\r\n    pudding. Besides these two dishes, which constitute the most\r\n    important part of the meal, there will be a plate containing\r\n    some of the contents of the cask baked on the embers, and two\r\n    small plates, one containing bruised chili peppers, lime juice,\r\n    and broth, as sauce for the beef, and the other some of the\r\n    peppers, oil, vinegar, raw small onions, and garlic sliced, as\r\n    sauce for the cod fish. Dessert will consist of bananas, Dutch\r\n    cheese, and guava, potato, or other sweets. All help themselves\r\n    with their own knives and forks, when they have such things,\r\n    sometimes the guest only being supplied with them, because he\r\n    is a foreigner. In the latter case the rest help themselves\r\n    with the apparatus nature gave them. It is done thus: each\r\n    has a plate near him, and the meat, pirao, and sauces remain\r\n    in the middle of the table. They draw from the dish a portion\r\n    of the meat which they lay in their respective plates; this\r\n    is subdivided by hand. With the ends of the fingers each then\r\n    scoops out a piece of pirao, about as big as a hen’s egg, a\r\n    shred of the beef is laid into the hot sauce and withdrawn; and\r\n    the two having been a little worked up together with the ends\r\n    of the fingers and the palm of the same hand until they are\r\n    tolerably incorporated, the elongated bolus is conveyed to the\r\n    mouth and swallowed in a manner that would probably astonish\r\n    a Neapolitan macaroni eater, and certainly astounds everybody\r\n    else who witnesses it for the first time.\r\n\r\n    The class of Brazilians of whose mode of living the foregoing\r\n    conveys a slight idea is fast disappearing before the rapid\r\n    strides that civilization is making in the country. The\r\n    majority of the planters of the present day are intelligent,\r\n    and free from most of the prejudices inherited from the old\r\n    Portuguese settlers. Many of the landed proprietors live in\r\n    large, well-built houses, keep excellent tables, and, indeed,\r\n    are generally of high acquirements, some having received a\r\n    university education, and mixed in the first circles in Europe,\r\n    and at the court of Rio Janeiro, assimilating in a great\r\n    measure to the squatters in Australia, or the landowners in New\r\n    Zealand, many of whom, as is well known, consist of cadets and\r\n    collateral branches of the noblest and most ancient families of\r\n    the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n    The hospitality of the Brazilians to strangers, and their\r\n    attentions particularly to Englishmen, when travelling in their\r\n    country, are remarkable. They have got the notion that all\r\n    Englishmen imbibe wine, brandy, and beer largely; and it is\r\n    unfortunately but too true that what they have witnessed during\r\n    their intercourse with our islanders in some measure warrants\r\n    the conclusion they have come to. They always expressed the\r\n    greatest astonishment when the writer refused to take wine\r\n    except at dinner; and when they found that he never took their\r\n    new harsh rum, or worse liqueurs, they exclaimed ‘Nao hé\r\n    Inglez!’ When a man is very drunk they say he is Bem Inglez;\r\n    and a dram they call, huma baieta Ingleza—an English wrapper.\r\n    Some further particulars relative to domestic life among the\r\n    planters, and among various grades of the Brazilians, will\r\n    be found in a note somewhat similar to this appended to the\r\n    chapter on Bahia; but, as partially helping to complete the\r\n    foregoing picture of a Brazilian interior and _menage_, I\r\n    select the following from a German work published in the course\r\n    of the present year, entitled ‘Reise nach Brasilien,’ by D.\r\n    Hermann Burmeister, the original of which I have not seen, and\r\n    am therefore indebted to a review in the ‘Athenæum,’ of last\r\n    month, for a translation of the extract:—\r\n\r\n      At sunrise, the family is awake. The servant, or (where\r\n      there is none) the housewife lights the fire, and boils the\r\n      coffee, which, though prepared in a peculiar manner, is\r\n      always excellent. The raw sugar and the unroasted berries\r\n      are stirred together and roasted in a covered pan, so that\r\n      when the sugar melts and cools it forms a tough mass with the\r\n      berries. A spoonful of this is pounded in a mortar and put\r\n      into a linen bag. Boiling water is then poured upon it, cups\r\n      are held underneath, and the beverage is ready. Coffee-pots\r\n      are not used, but the cups are made separately, and handed\r\n      about on a salver: they are small, and without handles. Milk\r\n      is only added in the morning; in the evening the coffee is\r\n      taken without it. The hour for breakfast is ten o’clock;\r\n      black beans, porridge (_angù_), dried meat, meal (_farinha_),\r\n      bacon (_toucinho_), cabbage, rice, and even a fowl, when the\r\n      entertainment is of a superior kind, are served up. Everyone\r\n      eats what he pleases, the same plate being used at once for\r\n      everything. The host and his guests sit at the table to their\r\n      meal, while the wife remains without, and looks on, eating\r\n      apart. When these have finished, the slaves and servants take\r\n      their turn. Now come the occupations of the day. The wife\r\n      goes to her work, that is to say, she mends her own, her\r\n      husband’s, and her children’s clothes, while the man goes out\r\n      to walk, or to game, or to gossip on the highway. At three\r\n      or four o’clock, there is a fresh repast of the same kind as\r\n      the other. They eat heartily, drinking water either alone, or\r\n      mixed with a little brandy, and soon after dinner take a cup\r\n      of coffee. After this comes the period of repose, during the\r\n      hottest hours of the day, and then comes another walk, which\r\n      generally lasts till late at night. Between five and six\r\n      o’clock, the ladies call upon their friends, accompanied by a\r\n      black female servant. Some families take a third meal between\r\n      seven and eight o’clock, but this is an exception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE MILL HOUSE OF THE ‘CARAUNA’ SUGAR ESTATE,\r\nIN PERNAMBUCO, BELONGING TO DR. DOMINGOS DE SOUZA LEAO; SHOWING DE\r\nMORNAY’S PATENT CANE MILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nALAGOAS AND SEREGIPE.\r\n\r\n    Area, Products, and Population of Alagoas.—Maceio, the\r\n    principal Seaport.—Rivers navigable only by boats, except the\r\n    San Francisco.—Cataract on the same, at the famous Falls of\r\n    Affonso; a new sight for Used Up travellers in search of the\r\n    picturesque in the tropics.—Primitive condition of the Province\r\n    of Seregipe, and prospects of rapid improvement through\r\n    Railways.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adjoining province to Pernambuco is that of _Alagoas_, so called from\r\nlakes situated a short distance from the coast, and where the capital of\r\nthe province was originally placed; but latterly the shipping port of\r\nMaceio has been preferred, and it has grown into a flourishing little\r\ntown, where a good deal of produce is cleared. It is built on the gentle\r\nslope of a hill, a short distance from the bay or harbour, formed, like\r\nall others in Brazil, by a reef of coral rocks, inside of which a vessel\r\nrides in safety with plenty of water. Its exports first in importance are\r\ncotton, and sugar, and then hides. With the exception of the Reconvavo\r\nof Bahia, there is probably no part of Brazil so populous as the greater\r\npart of this province, which, embracing an area of about 150 by 60 miles,\r\nhas a population of fully a quarter of a million, chiefly addicted to\r\nagriculture, here prosecuted with great success, as the soil is most\r\nrich, yielding nearly every Brazilian produce in great profusion; but\r\ntobacco, once a prime staple, is falling off, owing to the cessation\r\nof imported slave labour; cotton is now fast taking its place, and its\r\ncultivation is being followed most encouragingly, common cotton cloth\r\nbeing also made in most of the houses, though the manufactured article\r\nis imported, with trifling exceptions. There are numerous rivers in the\r\nprovince, but none of them navigable for any distance, except by boats,\r\nin the construction of which the inhabitants greatly excel. In this\r\nprovince is the famous cataract of Paulo Affonso, over which the River\r\nSan Francisco is precipitated a perpendicular height of fifty feet, one\r\nof the grandest sights in nature; and we look forward with confidence to\r\nthe time when it will be a familiar sight also to the western traveller,\r\nas the projected railway from Pernambuco, after traversing nearly the\r\nwhole province, is to terminate almost at the very foot of the Falls. Of\r\nall the provinces of the great empire of Brazil there is none probably\r\nthat may calculate with greater certainty on a more rapid augmentation\r\nof its prosperity from railroads than Alagoas, as nearly all the traffic\r\nis now conducted on horse-back and in a species of canoe; and as the\r\nproductiveness and variety of the soil are vast, correspondingly large\r\nwill be the result of affording the numerous population the means of\r\ntransport. The town of Alagoas itself contains about 14,000 inhabitants,\r\nand possesses some good educational and large religious establishments,\r\nbeing situate in the midst of an agreeable and fertile country,\r\nsurrounded by some of the finest timber-trees in the empire, the province\r\nyielding to none in the quality or quantity of its forest produce,\r\ninclusive of Brazil wood.\r\n\r\n_Seregipe_, contiguous to, is also a good deal mixed up with Alagoas.\r\nThey are both intersected by the great river San Francisco, which, though\r\nit might be made navigable for hundreds of miles above the falls of the\r\nsame name, and be rendered a source of valuable commerce, is navigable\r\nonly by small smacks for a comparatively very short distance from the\r\nsea, all goods destined for the interior farther up having to be carried\r\non the backs of horses to another part of the river, and there put on\r\nboard jojos, that is, two or more canoes lashed together, and traversed\r\nat top by a piece of board. It is worth remarking, that in ascending this\r\nriver, and indeed most rivers on this coast, the wind blows up for some\r\ntwo hours continuously, which admits of sails being used, and the descent\r\nis easily effected by the current without the wind, which blows downwards\r\nfor nearly the same space of time towards the coast. The area of Seregipe\r\nis estimated at 18,000 square miles, the population at about 200,000.\r\nThis province is likewise very productive, especially in fine timber,\r\nthough vast tracts are still altogether uncultivated, but very large\r\nherds of cattle prosper on the fine pastures which everywhere abound. The\r\nprincipal town is Sao Christovao, but is not of importance, sufficient to\r\nrequire any detailed notice, or to detain us from the large and important\r\ntown and province we next proceed to, viz., Bahia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBAHIA.\r\n\r\n    Bahia, its old name retained in a new place: the province\r\n    and the city; present condition and splendid prospect\r\n    of both.—Intra-mural peculiarities and Extra-mural\r\n    properties.—Prolific sugar produce.—Historic, artistic,\r\n    and archæological attractions of Bahia.—Souvenirs of the\r\n    Jesuits.—Relics of St. Ignatius Loyola and St. Francis\r\n    Xavier.—A Bahian church built in Europe.—British Bahian\r\n    clergyman and local railways.—Health of the city.—A Brazilian\r\n    poet warbling native wood-notes very wild.—Necessity for\r\n    keeping a nautical eye in fine frenzy rolling towards the\r\n    Abrolhos.—Departure from Bahia.—Approach to the Brazilian\r\n    capital, and untoward preliminary to the Argentina’s\r\n    acquaintance therewith.—Stray notes on Bahia, containing\r\n    memoranda on Brazilian matters in general.\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS.—Both the illustrations in this\r\n    chapter are copied from ‘Sketches in South America,’ by Sir W.\r\n    Gore Ouseley, who, in a letter-press ‘Key’ to his beautiful\r\n    portfolio of drawings, affords some interesting particulars,\r\n    of which the annexed is an abridgment:—The first remarkable\r\n    object in approaching the harbour of Bahia is the Fort of St.\r\n    Antonio, situated on the point of a rock, forming the extremity\r\n    of the Cape called after that saint. It is not large, but it is\r\n    a fair specimen of the numerous solidly-constructed stone forts\r\n    that have been scattered by the Portuguese (and Spaniards)\r\n    throughout their colonial possessions, wherever deemed\r\n    necessary for purposes of defence or aggression, and which bear\r\n    witness, in their well-built walls, and often handsome details,\r\n    to the ample means, military skill, and power, that backed the\r\n    zeal of the first settlers in South America, and founded the\r\n    Brazilian empire. Fort St. Antonio has on its highest part a\r\n    light-house, of great service to mariners in making the port\r\n    at night, as there are shoals off the point. Opposite to Cape\r\n    St. Antonio is a long low island, called Itaparicá, between\r\n    which and the port is the channel for large vessels. The\r\n    scenery near Bahia does not present the striking features that\r\n    distinguish Rio de Janeiro; it has neither the well-wooded\r\n    hills nor the lofty precipitous rocks that environ the capital\r\n    of Brazil. It is, however, very pretty, varied by small hills\r\n    and acclivities, and ornamented by the tall, graceful cocoa-nut\r\n    and the usual luxuriant vegetation of Brazil. The Cape, like\r\n    the coast generally of the province of Bahia, is surrounded\r\n    by coral rocks; and a reef of coral extends to a considerable\r\n    distance from and along the shore. The beach is sandy, with\r\n    large stones strewed on it by the action of the waves. After\r\n    passing the Cape and Fort St. Antonio, which are on the right\r\n    on entering the harbour of Bahia, the next prominent objects\r\n    are the church and villas on the high land, called Victoria,\r\n    overlooking the harbour. It is a favourite and picturesque\r\n    suburb of Bahia, and is the chosen site of several ‘chacras’\r\n    or quasi country residences. The elevation is sufficient to\r\n    avoid the extreme heat of the lower town and to get the benefit\r\n    of the sea-breeze. It is considered a healthy situation, and\r\n    a tolerable carriage-road leads to the English cemetery,\r\n    marked by a cross in the foreground, and to the point of St.\r\n    Antonio, as well as along the coast. On the beach are several\r\n    ‘Armaçaos,’ or places where whale-boats are kept, and whales\r\n    cut up. They are provided with capstans and tackle, for hauling\r\n    up the carcase and blubber to be reduced to food by the poor,\r\n    the flesh looking like coarse beef. The whale on this coast\r\n    is pursued in large sailing-boats, and harpooned while the\r\n    boat is under sail. In the inner harbour are situated most\r\n    of the wharves, quays, and warehouses along the beach and\r\n    projecting into the water; and here numerous vessels lie in\r\n    perfect safety; the foreign men-of-war generally near a round\r\n    castellated tower or fort, not far from the entrance. Bahia is\r\n    divided into two towns, the upper and the lower, the former of\r\n    which being more modern, is built with greater regularity than\r\n    the latter; and contains many handsome buildings, including a\r\n    rich cathedral, the palaces of the archbishop and governor, a\r\n    court of appeal, theatre, hospitals, a library of from 60,000\r\n    to 70,000 volumes, and many other edifices, chiefly of an\r\n    ecclesiastical character. The lower town, San Salvador, or\r\n    Bahia, is dirty and badly laid out, but in it are to be found\r\n    the exchange, arsenal, and imperial dockyard. About three miles\r\n    north-east are yards for the construction of merchant shipping.\r\n    The houses are mostly of stone, and often lofty. The Dutch\r\n    have left traces of former possession in the brick paving of\r\n    some of the streets. At the foot of the steep height, covered\r\n    with foliage, and crowned by the ‘Paseo Publico,’ or public\r\n    promenade, is a small landing-place for boats, conveniently\r\n    situated for those who prefer a steep but clambering ascent\r\n    to the upper town, to being first taken round the point\r\n    into the interior basin and landed in the lower town, to be\r\n    thence carried up by negroes in a sort of palanquin. Those in\r\n    use here consist merely of a chair on a platform of boards,\r\n    suspended from the centre of an arched pole or beam, the\r\n    projecting swan-necked ends of which are born on the shoulders\r\n    of two men, who relieve themselves by the occasional use of\r\n    a stick as a lever applied under the pole as it rests under\r\n    the opposite shoulder. The motion is neither pleasant nor the\r\n    position seemingly secure. Yet not only ladies, but men, and\r\n    of no light calibre, invariably use them for transport to\r\n    the upper town and in visiting. The chairs are sheltered by\r\n    curtains from the sun, and the woodwork as well as curtains\r\n    are often gilt and showily and expensively ornamented. The\r\n    steepness of the streets prevents the use of wheel-carriages,\r\n    except in a few directions, and causes the substitution of\r\n    these palanquins. Bahia, founded in 1549 by Thomas de Souza,\r\n    first captain-general of Brazil, is one of the most important\r\n    commercial cities in America; and prior to the transfer of the\r\n    vice-royalty in 1763 to Rio, was the capital of Brazil. It\r\n    is defended by several forts, some of great strength. It was\r\n    stated some years ago to contain above 150,000 inhabitants,\r\n    among whom are many very wealthy proprietors and merchants.\r\n    This population is divided pretty equally into whites,\r\n    mulattoes, and blacks. A few miles from Bahia, on the Atlantic\r\n    coast near Rio Vermelho, is a small ruined chapel, dedicated to\r\n    St. Gonçalo, said to be the first building devoted to Christian\r\n    worship constructed in Brazil, or, as some say, in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nBahia, or San Salvador da Bahia, is commonly called by the former name,\r\nwhich is only the abbreviation of the title given by the first settlers\r\nto the bay, at the head whereof stands the capital, viz., ‘Bahia de todos\r\nos Santos,’ or ‘All Saints’ Bay,’ as already stated; but some geographers\r\nof the present day retain the old nomenclature; and in so recent\r\nand authoritative a work as the eighth edition of the ‘Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica,’ now in course of publication, the reader is referred, for\r\nthe province and city of Bahia, to the article San Salvador, which may\r\nbe expected to make its appearance somewhere towards the end of 1856,\r\nby which time, it is to be hoped, the subject will have expanded to\r\ndimensions corresponding with such procrastination in its treatment by\r\nsuch means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE PORT OF BAHIA.]\r\n\r\nThis province contains within itself the germs of enduring prosperity:\r\na splendid bay many miles in extent, where countless ships can ride\r\nclose to the shore, with lakes and rivers branching from it, form so\r\nmany natural harbours, docks, and canals; whilst it abounds with sugar\r\nplantations, forests of timber fit for shipbuilding and other purposes,\r\nprecious stones, and many tropical productions, the latter of which can\r\nbe all procured in a degree only limited by the amount of labour and the\r\nfacility of bringing things down to the ports for shipment.\r\n\r\nEverything at Bahia bespeaks the former head-quarter of an important\r\ngovernment. The removal of the latter to Rio was of course a great\r\ndisadvantage to this place, which has since had to work its way up\r\nas a commercial entrepot, with frequent interruptions from political\r\ndisturbances, the last in 1837 amounting to a positive civil war, when a\r\nmost lawless band obtained possession of the city, which they held for\r\nseveral months, and were only driven out, with much slaughter, after\r\nhaving attempted to fire it, in which they partially succeeded. Since\r\nthat time things have been tolerably quiet, the discovery of large\r\ndeposits of diamonds in a district called the Chapada having given an\r\nimpetus to business, and taken away many restless spirits, there being\r\nnow a population of some 40,000, collected there in pursuit of gems\r\nhere found in considerable abundance—some of extraordinary value. It is\r\n50 to 60 leagues distant from the town of Cachoeira at the head of a\r\nriver of that name, which is navigable for steam-boats and a source of\r\nconsiderable traffic, there joining the Paraguassa, into which sundry\r\nsmall tributaries, of more or less importance, flow.\r\n\r\nThe production of sugar, for the fine quality of which the province is\r\ngreatly celebrated, as also for that of its tobacco, so highly praised\r\nin Portugal and Spain, has latterly revived, amounting for the crop just\r\nfinished, to 80,000 tons. As already observed in the case of Pernambuco,\r\nthis increase has not originated from any fiscal changes in England,\r\nbut simply from the cessation of civil discord, enabling the planters\r\nto devote their entire energies to the culture of their estates. It is\r\ntrue that large importations of slaves have aided this movement, and\r\nthat Bahia has been the great focus of this detestable traffic; but the\r\nstimulus cannot be traced in any way to our treatment of the West India\r\nColonies, however disposed interested parties may be to ascribe it to\r\nthis circumstance. The Brazilians had begun to find out the advantages\r\nattendant on peace and tranquillity, and that the greater the quantity of\r\nproduce they could export the larger would be the means at their disposal\r\nfor the purchase of the necessaries and luxuries of life, which they\r\nnow began to look upon as desirable to possess. Improved machinery for\r\nthe making of sugar was brought into operation, as well as additional\r\ncapital for the development of that product, and likewise of cotton; in\r\nthe export of which latter commodity Bahia now nearly equals Pernambuco,\r\nexceeding that port and province, and all the rest of Brazil put\r\ntogether, in the quantity of its sugar. The natural consequence of such\r\napplication of skill and means has been a largely extended production\r\nfrom almost virgin soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAPEL OF SAN GONCALO, AT BAHIA.]\r\n\r\nWhilst the trade of Bahia has thus progressed, signs of local and\r\nmunicipal improvement are also visible. Short as is the time since the\r\naccomplished author of the note, page 123, wrote—viz., in 1845—the\r\nstreets have been generally repaired, and the roads leading to the upper\r\ntown put in an efficient state, so that carriages can now traverse\r\nthem safely; new quays, extending along the margin of the bay, are in\r\nprocess of erection; also a new custom-house, together with many other\r\nmuch-needed improvements, chiefly owing to the personal activity of\r\nSen. Gonsalvez Martins, formerly President of Bahia, and late Minister\r\nof the Empire, who is a native of the place, to which he has shown\r\nhimself devotedly attached. Bahia possesses more attractions for the\r\nmere traveller, in search of curiosities, than probably any town in\r\nBrazil, or even in the whole of South America; formerly the capital\r\nof the empire, as we have just said, and still next in extent and\r\nimportance to the metropolis, and as being also the chief seat of the\r\necclesiastical jurisdiction, its religious structures are the most\r\nnumerous, imposing, and unique, of any in all Brazil. The cathedral of\r\nSan Salvador is a splendid monument of the architectural genius of the\r\nJesuits, and its interior corresponds in magnificence with its external\r\nbeauty, containing, among other remarkable mementos of those colonizers,\r\na portrait, said to be taken from life, of their famous founder, Ignatius\r\nLoyola, and that of St. Francis Xavier. The ancient college of the order,\r\nnow a military hospital, is also very fine. There are probably not less\r\nthan 40 churches, one of them being situated in the principal street, the\r\nPraya, called the Church of the Conception, chiefly composed of blocks of\r\nmarble which were forwarded from Europe already numbered, like the plates\r\nof an iron house in these days, and on their arrival they had merely to\r\nbe put together, and the building was constructed at once, according to\r\nthe precise design of the architect at home. This is the more singular\r\nas very excellent stone abounds on the spot, the theatre, for instance,\r\nbeing erected on a rock, and numbers of houses are built therewith from\r\nthe same material, to the height of five stories, some having balconies\r\nand blinds, instead of windows—a most desirable arrangement in such a\r\nclimate, and one which speaks much for the honesty of the lower classes\r\nin a town of great trade like Bahia, the extent of whose business\r\nmay be surmised when it is stated that upwards of a million pounds’\r\nsterling worth of English goods alone enter it annually. Mr. Borthwick,\r\nthe engineer, sent from London to determine on the accuracy of Messrs.\r\nDe Mornay’s survey of the Pernambuco railway, in his report, already\r\nreferred to in the preceding chapter, speaking of the rival claims of\r\nBahia to a railway of its own, and contrasting the condition of the\r\ntwo extraordinary nourishing provinces, says:—‘In 1851 the imperial\r\nrevenue, from Bahia was 4,784,600 milreis, and from Pernambuco 4,639,427\r\nmilreis, irrespective of movements of funds, &c., which would reverse the\r\ncomparison in that way.’ I have not the returns for the last two years\r\nbefore me, but believe that the general relative proposition is still\r\nabout the same.\r\n\r\nHere I saw the first practical adoption of the Brazilian railway system,\r\nin the working of a tram road, to level a large space of uneven ground\r\ncalled the Campo, on the Victoria Hill, by which means a large amount of\r\nwork has been done in a very short time. For much of this the natives are\r\nconsiderably indebted to the English clergyman who officiates as chaplain\r\nto the British residents, and who, not satisfied with paving the road\r\nto heaven leading to the path he points out, and building a handsome\r\nnew church in this locality, has been public-spirited enough to afford\r\nmaterial assistance in the construction of highways, building of bridges,\r\nand other engineering works, thus clearly and beneficially proving his\r\naptitude for business of this kind.\r\n\r\nBahia has suffered severely from that dreadful scourge the yellow fever;\r\nbut we found it had in a great measure passed over; and it is to be\r\nhoped that it will gradually die away, though it appears that the chief\r\nmedical men in the empire have decided that it will remain a permanent,\r\nor at least intermittent, visitant, something probably like the cholera\r\namongst us, which has apparently become acclimated in England, continuing\r\na steady course of mortality, without those sudden inroads whose speedy\r\ndevastation so greatly shocked, because they so much surprised, us.\r\n\r\nThere is a romantic kind of history attached to the first settlement of\r\nthis province, embodied in an attempt to copy Camoens in his splendid\r\nwork, commemorative of the discovery of India by Vasco da Gama. (_Vide_\r\nintroductory chapter.) It is called ‘Caramaru,’ and was written by José\r\nBasilio da Gama, a Brazilian, born in Minas Geres, about the year 1740,\r\nand is descriptive of the adventures of a Portuguese sailor, who was\r\nwrecked somewhere near Bahia, and rescued from the fate of his shipmates\r\n(who were sacrificed by the cannibals, then in possession of the coast)\r\nby an Indian princess, who became enamoured of and married him; he then\r\nfigured in the wars of the Indians, by whom he was looked upon as a kind\r\nof demi-god, and afterwards made a trip to Europe with his wife. Some of\r\nthe scenes in this poem are well and graphically depicted, giving a good\r\ninsight into the state of the country at that period, and of the savage\r\nlife existing; but after reading Camoens, it sinks immeasurably into the\r\nshade, and we have difficulty in believing it to be written in the same\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nOur stay at Bahia was limited to the day. We sailed again at night, and\r\nwere obliged to pass outside the Abrolhos, it being night when we came\r\nup with them; otherwise there is a good channel for a steamer between\r\nthese rocks and the main land, and it is a great saving in distance.\r\nThe name of these crags is very appropriate (‘Open Your Eyes’) there\r\nbeing much need of it, and no light-house to warn the mariner, should he\r\nunfortunately be driven by the current or some other casualty near such\r\nperils at night-time. Few accidents, however, happen, because a wide\r\nberth is given to the Abrolhos. Off Cape Frio we were met by a stiff\r\nsouth-wester, which came down upon us with a freshness and determination\r\nworthy of St. George’s Channel; our little steamer went through it\r\nmanfully, only sending the spray over us. We did not descry the light\r\non Cape Frio owing to the mist and drizzling showers, but soon came up\r\nwith that on the Island of Raza, opposite to Rio Harbour, which is a\r\nsplendid light seen from a long distance, and it renders the entrance to\r\nRio comparatively easy. We steamed on, and passed the fort of Santa Cruz,\r\nwhere vessels are hailed; but in running in to the anchorage ground\r\nwe unfortunately came in contact with a small vessel, placed in the\r\nroads with chains and anchors to afford succour to vessels in distress,\r\nodd enough called the ‘Succorro,’ or ‘Succour.’ She had neglected\r\nthe precaution of having a light up, so stringently enforced by the\r\nregulations of the port; and we could not see her till close upon her,\r\ndoing some damage, but nothing very material, and came to anchor close to\r\nher for the night.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting ‘scraps,’ touching manners, customs, and things\r\nat Bahia, have been supplied by my valued relative, Mr. Wetherell, for\r\nsome time British Vice-Consul there, who employs much of his leisure\r\nhours not merely in collecting information of this nature and placing it\r\non record, but also in other useful pursuits connected with botany and\r\nnatural history, of which he has sent home many interesting results.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAY NOTES ON BAHIA.\r\n\r\n    One of the most singular appearances the upper city has to a\r\n    stranger is its apparent desertion. There were, until very\r\n    lately, only about a dozen wheeled vehicles in the place,\r\n    but the march of intellect has been here, and now there are\r\n    omnibuses plying to the Victoria. All burdens are carried on\r\n    the head, from an orange, a candle, or a bottle, to a barrel\r\n    of fish. The larger kinds, such as pipes of wine, are slung\r\n    between poles, whilst logs of wood are carried upon the\r\n    shoulders of twenty or thirty, looking, for all the world, like\r\n    an immense centipede. During the time of carrying a wild kind\r\n    of chorus is kept up; one man makes observations as he goes\r\n    along, and the rest come in with a chorus, which seldom varies,\r\n    however much the recitative solo part may. Although large\r\n    burdens are thus carried, one man will not take nearly so much\r\n    as a European, and would rather lose his chance of a journey\r\n    than carry more than he thinks proper.\r\n\r\n    The cupolas of the church towers are very frequently covered\r\n    with pieces of earthenware, assorted according to their colour,\r\n    and laid on stucco in patterns, which gives them a glistening\r\n    appearance, as if they were enamelled. It appears to withstand\r\n    the effects of time. Some of them are covered with Dutch tiles,\r\n    and others are formed of marble. Part of the front of the\r\n    Italian friars’ church, and the bell tower, are covered with\r\n    the above curious stucco, but a near approach destroys the\r\n    effect.\r\n\r\n    Little naked blacks are constantly seen in the street, with\r\n    no more clothing than a pair of bracelets or ear-rings, and\r\n    some are very fine-looking. Their appearance is not improved,\r\n    however, by the protuberance of the abdomen caused by eating\r\n    farinha, which swells extremely when any liquid is mixed with\r\n    it. The shape, nevertheless, is soon regained. One peculiarity\r\n    is the infrequency of a child crying: their food is simple,\r\n    so that they do not often suffer from indigestion, and they\r\n    are less encumbered with clothing than the higher classes,\r\n    although, in the country, none are very particular in that\r\n    respect. The manner in which the mother carries the child,\r\n    slung across the back with her shawl, binds its legs in a\r\n    curve, but they soon recover their straightness when able to\r\n    walk. When thus tied, the child presents the very picture of\r\n    resignation, its little head nodding about, when fast asleep,\r\n    or when awake crowing, or beating a tattoo on its mother’s\r\n    back, who frequently holds a conversation with it, its replies\r\n    being in the only universal language now in use.\r\n\r\n    The huts of the blacks are very curious; they are built of\r\n    stakes of bamboo &c., driven into the ground, and these\r\n    intertwined with others; the whole, being filled up with clay,\r\n    and thatched with palm-leaves. The interior presents the very\r\n    acmé of wretchedness on a rainy day, and but little better in\r\n    fine weather. All kinds of rubbish huddled together, a few\r\n    daubs of saints hung on the walls, a ricketty table with some\r\n    carved saint upon it, a coach dog, (a hideous animal, without\r\n    hair, having only a few bristles on the head, back, and tail,\r\n    and of a dull leaden colour,) or a long-legged scraggy cat, and\r\n    a few fowls, quite as great curiosities in their way, are the\r\n    usual characteristics of these primitive habitations.\r\n\r\n    The blacks of this place swim almost as if they were\r\n    amphibious. You see numbers of children constantly dabbling\r\n    at the water’s edge for hours together, and soon learning to\r\n    strike out boldly. One mode of swimming is very singular; one\r\n    arm is always out of the water, advanced in front, alternately\r\n    with the other, sweeping or drawing the water towards them, and\r\n    raising the body out of the water at each stroke. This method\r\n    is considerably quicker than the ordinary style of swimming,\r\n    but appears to be more difficult of attainment.\r\n\r\n    It is agreed by phrenologists that the head of the negro, above\r\n    all others, presents the greatest development of Music, and\r\n    certainly some of the blacks do play remarkably well. You hear\r\n    little boys in the street, whom you might fancy could scarcely\r\n    speak, whistle tunes with great correctness; and the negro\r\n    dances show how admirably the science of time is appreciated.\r\n\r\n        O surely melody from heaven was sent\r\n        To cheer the soul, when tired of human strife,\r\n        To soothe the wayward heart, by sorrow bent,\r\n        And soften down the rugged path of life.—KIRKE WHITE.\r\n\r\n    It is to European ears, however, that taught combination music\r\n    has the charm; the monotony of the negro chanting, and its\r\n    never-ending repetition, convey no idea of the ‘melody of sweet\r\n    sounds,’ and the dances that are exhibited to these tunes are\r\n    anything but edifying.\r\n\r\n    The manner of catching fish here is curious. At low water four\r\n    or five large canoes will start; two of them divide the net,\r\n    which is of great length, and has the lower edge loaded with\r\n    lead, and the upper lightened with cork. On arriving at a given\r\n    spot, they separate, and dropping the net with all speed, form\r\n    as wide a circle as possible, and thus enclose the fish in a\r\n    pen. The canoes are then ranged around the outside of the net,\r\n    at some distance from each other, and a hand-net, the length of\r\n    the canoe, is held by two blacks. This net is about six feet\r\n    in height, and supported by two poles. The other men then beat\r\n    the water and the sides of the canoes with paddles, making as\r\n    much noise as they can, which frightens the fish, which, trying\r\n    to escape, and finding themselves effectually prevented by the\r\n    net, leap out of the water, and are caught by the hand-net,\r\n    and fall into the boat. In a few minutes a large catch is\r\n    made, though numbers of course escape. It is a curious sight\r\n    to see them flying, as it were, in all directions, out of the\r\n    enclosure.\r\n\r\n    The roasted grains of milho (Indian corn) form a dish of which\r\n    the blacks, are very fond; it is called pipokas, and is thus\r\n    prepared:—an earthen pot is partly filled with white sand, and\r\n    placed over a small open stove until it becomes thoroughly\r\n    heated, when the grains of new milho are stripped off the\r\n    bunch, thrown in, and stirred amongst the sand with a long\r\n    stick. The grains soon swell, and burst the skin, and the corn\r\n    becomes white and light. These grains are eaten with pieces of\r\n    cocoa nut. ‘Vai plantas pipokas,’ (go plant roasted milho,) is\r\n    a phrase, rather more expressive than polite, used in bidding a\r\n    person go and mind his own business.\r\n\r\n    It is a curious circumstance that the minds of the blacks\r\n    should, for so many ages, have remained in a stationary\r\n    condition; and although political and local circumstances may\r\n    have greatly operated to retard their mental development,\r\n    yet it seems much more probable that this state of darkness\r\n    proceeds more from physical causes. Their stupidity, or rather\r\n    want of intellectuality, is a most unaccountable fact, and one\r\n    of those mysterious dispensations of Providence that man tries\r\n    in vain to unravel. Individual, but almost solitary, instances\r\n    occur of a contrary nature; and although cultivation of the\r\n    intellect may thus have developed the black’s faculties, it\r\n    only serves to show more clearly the wild and blank from which\r\n    he has been separated.\r\n\r\n    A very singular, in fact almost a barbaric, custom exists here\r\n    on gala days, such as the birth-day of the Emperor or Empress.\r\n    The President issues invitations to a ‘Cortejo’ at the Palace,\r\n    a large building in the upper town. The portion occupied by the\r\n    President is older than the rest, which is new, and contains\r\n    the Treasury, and other public offices. The attendance on one\r\n    of these gala days consists of all the authorities, and many\r\n    of the principal inhabitants of the city. The ceremony usually\r\n    commences with a ‘Te Deum’ in the cathedral. The foreign\r\n    consuls appear in their uniforms, a motley habited, but showy,\r\n    group: the officers of the army and navy, with the President,\r\n    all in full regimentals; the archbishop in his robes, and the\r\n    priests in the habits of their respective orders; the judges\r\n    in their robes of office, the corporation in their quaint\r\n    dresses, and a crowd of civilians, all habited in black, and\r\n    many of them decorated with ribbons and stars. The entry is\r\n    up a dilapidated stair-case, on the top landing of which a\r\n    military band is stationed playing national airs. Two large\r\n    and scantily furnished rooms are entered, and a short time is\r\n    spent in conversation, until the preparations for the Cortejo\r\n    are complete. Then the President’s aid-de-camp pushes aside\r\n    the heavy door curtain, and invites the company to enter. The\r\n    assemblage enters a long room, papered with green and gold, and\r\n    lighted by a line of windows overlooking the sea, curtained\r\n    with green and gold damask, looped with bullion. At the further\r\n    end of the room, under a velvet canopy, with a kind of dais\r\n    in front, are portraits of the Emperor and the Empress, which\r\n    constitute the sole furniture of the room. On one side of the\r\n    portraits stand the President and the Archbishop, and on the\r\n    other the General-at-arms, Commander of the National Guard, and\r\n    other principal authorities. The procession advances down the\r\n    centre of the room, in Indian file, the consuls going first,\r\n    and according to precedence; and when within a few yards of the\r\n    dais, each person makes a profound bow to the portraits, and\r\n    then to the authorities. Foreigners generally omit the first\r\n    obeisance, as being too _savage_, but those who come after most\r\n    ceremoniously perform the rite. After bowing, each person takes\r\n    his leave by passing out by a side door, and the Cortejo is\r\n    over. When all have bowed their way out, the President invites\r\n    the consuls he is friendly with to view the troops defile\r\n    before him, as he stands at one of the front windows of the\r\n    Palace. The military march past to martial music, and then we\r\n    take our leave.\r\n\r\n    Caugica is a species of food of a peculiarly national\r\n    character, and is made in various ways. One is simply taking\r\n    the skin off the Indian corn, and boiling it in milk or water;\r\n    this is eaten cold. Another method is to grind the corn, mix\r\n    the meal with sugar and spices, and boil it with milk, when it\r\n    makes a very agreeable food.\r\n\r\n    The butterflies of this country are most gorgeous; agile and\r\n    graceful, they flutter in the sunlight, their magnificent robes\r\n    glistening like scales of gold. These sylph-like inhabitants of\r\n    the air, issuing from the dark cradle in which they exist as\r\n    chrysalises, seem to rejoice in their new life, hovering from\r\n    flower to flower, sipping the choicest nectar, and revelling in\r\n    perpetual enjoyment, and the continued pursuit of novelty and\r\n    pleasure.\r\n\r\n    The Solidade Convent is the great _locale_ where they make\r\n    those beautiful feather flowers without dye, which are so much\r\n    esteemed in Europe. On my first visit to this place, all the\r\n    romance of nuns and nunneries was revived in my mind. The lady\r\n    abbess, or superior, or whatever else she may be, was a stately\r\n    woman: but the nun who acted as saleswoman was most beautiful—a\r\n    Carlo Dolci countenance, pale, but with glorious eyes; and far\r\n    more flowers were bought from her than would have been from\r\n    any other. Visitors are ushered into a small room, whither\r\n    the flowers are conveyed in large baskets through a double\r\n    grating, and the attendants of the different nuns are there to\r\n    look after their own. None of our party were very proficient\r\n    in Portuguese, and we had great fun in the purchases, though\r\n    we probably paid double what we ought to have done. On our\r\n    departure, the lovely nun came to the door, and as we passed\r\n    out, courteously bade us ‘adios,’ and requested us, if we came\r\n    again, to ask for Maria.\r\n\r\n    A beautiful species of duck is found at Maronia, to the north\r\n    of this place, of the manner of catching which a description\r\n    has been given me. The lakes which they frequent are very much\r\n    choked with vegetable matter, and near their haunts a large\r\n    gourd is floated, having two small holes bored through the\r\n    side. After a few days, when the ducks have become accustomed\r\n    to the presence of the gourd, a man wades into the water with\r\n    it on his head, and catching a duck by its legs, breaks its\r\n    neck, and fastens it to his girdle. In this manner, several are\r\n    quietly killed, and the fowler wades ashore with a well-filled\r\n    pouch.\r\n\r\n    The Botocudo Indians make an incision in the under lip,\r\n    which becomes so distended that they insert in the orifice a\r\n    round piece of wood, as large as the top of a common-sized\r\n    tumbler-glass; the lobe of the ear is also perforated and\r\n    elongated, in order to receive a similar ornament. In height\r\n    they are about 5 feet 6 inches, and have quite an independent\r\n    bearing and _ar de franqueza_.\r\n\r\n    The Indians, like the Greeks of the Homeric age, deem it the\r\n    greatest of evils to be unburied, and therefore they delight in\r\n    making flutes and trumpets of their enemies’ bones. I have seen\r\n    some of these flutes of the present day: they contain about\r\n    four or five holes; and are sometimes ornamented with tufts of\r\n    red and yellow feathers attached to the bone by strings.\r\n\r\n    The market is a most curious place, and I am told by persons\r\n    who have travelled in Africa, that it has a thoroughly African\r\n    appearance. Amongst heaps of fruit, vegetables, &c., shaded by\r\n    mats, some of which are formed into huts, and others merely\r\n    propped up by sticks, are seated the black women, in dresses\r\n    of many diversified colours, but all of the same fashion.\r\n    Some with their infants slung across their backs, and tied\r\n    by the pano da Costa; others with heavy baskets of fruit or\r\n    vegetables on their head; little children, whose only articles\r\n    of clothing are bracelets, ear-rings, and bands of coral beads\r\n    round the body, squat on a wooden dish, like an Indian god,\r\n    or sprawl amidst fowls, ducks, &c. Here and there you see a\r\n    black girl in her holiday attire, her hands covered with rings,\r\n    and her neck adorned with chains of solid gold, which she is\r\n    constantly displaying by arranging her shawl. In this part of\r\n    the market the boxes of papadura, attended by the taberoá, in\r\n    his leather jacket and hat; the half-naked qaubadomes busy\r\n    with unloading and loading, and the different and absolutely\r\n    gorgeous colours of the fruit, vegetables, and dresses, form a\r\n    most brilliant picture. The constant chatter of talking, the\r\n    screaming of parrots, the laughter of the women, and sometimes\r\n    the serious talk, added to which the procession of the Espiritu\r\n    Santo, accompanied by its band of music, the ringing of the\r\n    church bells, and the constant firing of rockets, constitute a\r\n    perfect Babel of sounds. The dark shades are the dusky sons of\r\n    Ethiop themselves, the dirty buildings, and the still dirtier\r\n    streets; but a busier, gayer, or more amusing scene will seldom\r\n    be found.\r\n\r\n    This is the land of parasite plants; a thousand different kinds\r\n    of these vagaries of nature are here. Some, attached to the\r\n    branches of trees, derive sustenance therefrom and from the\r\n    air; others form a nucleus with their roots for dead leaves,\r\n    decayed wood, &c., and flourish; others, again, merely rest\r\n    upon the branches, and live on air alone. Every curiosity of\r\n    form is to be seen: some of the flowers like flies; others\r\n    of indescribable shapes; many with their flowers filled with\r\n    water, which thus becomes scented; a dozen different varieties\r\n    on one tree; some of most brilliant colours, others shades of\r\n    green alone; some long and pendant, one variety of which has\r\n    received the name of the ‘rat’s tail;’ some without leaves,\r\n    like nothing but a string, wave with every wind until they\r\n    reach the ground, where they become fixed and rooted.\r\n\r\n    The bread-fruit tree is very beautiful; but is not very common\r\n    in this place, its use being superseded by farinha. The leaves\r\n    are very large, of a bright green colour, and much indented\r\n    at the edges. The fruit is green, and the surface has the\r\n    appearance of network. There are two varieties: in one kind the\r\n    divisions of the fruit’s surface are raised pyramidally, in the\r\n    other they are smooth. The latter is the sort used for food,\r\n    it having no seeds. Roasted and eaten with butter and salt it\r\n    is palatable, but insipid; and here it is usually planted for\r\n    ornament, as it grows quickly, and makes a pleasing variety\r\n    among other trees. The coffee is another very beautiful plant;\r\n    when in blossom, the long, glossy, dark green leaves present a\r\n    pleasing contrast to the clusters of white flowers round the\r\n    stem, and it exhales a delicious fragrance. When the berries\r\n    arrive at maturity, they are of a dusky red colour; each\r\n    contains two grains of coffee, surrounded by a soft pulp, which\r\n    soon dries after being plucked, and is then removed. The labour\r\n    of picking is very slight, and children can with great ease be\r\n    thus employed. The cultivation of the coffee-plant is much more\r\n    attended to in this province than formerly, and is gradually\r\n    taking the place of sugar. Towards the south a good deal is\r\n    cultivated for exportation.\r\n\r\n    The mantis is a very curious insect, which Rondelet, the\r\n    naturalist, says is called indifferently devin and prega diou,\r\n    or preché dieu, in consequence of having their fore-feet\r\n    extended as if preaching or praying. The Latin name of mantis\r\n    signifies ‘diviner,’ and supposed to have been so designated\r\n    from the motion they make with their fore-feet; and it was\r\n    imagined that they could divine or indicate events. The\r\n    fore-feet are used by the insect to carry food to its mouth;\r\n    it is of a beautiful green colour. In one of the Idylls of\r\n    Theocritus the term mantis is used to designate a thin young\r\n    girl with slender and elongated arms.—See Griffith’s Edition of\r\n    ‘Cuvier’s Animal Kingdom.’\r\n\r\n    The banana is a plant about twelve feet high, having a stem\r\n    similar to bulbous plants in general, and the leaves, many of\r\n    them two feet wide, and from twelve to fourteen feet long,\r\n    springing from the top. The new leaf rises from the centre,\r\n    and is rolled up straight; as it increases in length, it\r\n    gradually unfolds, and gives way for another. The fruit is\r\n    green, and grows round the stem in regular semi-circular\r\n    groups. The blossoms are protected by a thick fleshy leaf-like\r\n    covering, which rises to allow the sun to have its full\r\n    influence in maturing the fruit. When the blossoms drop off,\r\n    the half-circles remain, but it is seldom that more than six\r\n    or eight rows of bananas are produced, and each smaller than\r\n    the preceding. The juices of the plant gradually lose their\r\n    nutritious qualities, and there are numerous rows of abortive\r\n    flowers, which produce nothing; and the stem is terminated by\r\n    a mass of the fleshy leaves enclosing embryo bananas never to\r\n    be matured. The plant is generally cut down when the fruit has\r\n    attained its full size, to make it shoot for the next season,\r\n    and the fruit is hung up to ripen, which it soon does, when it\r\n    becomes of a fine yellow colour.\r\n\r\n    The sunsets here are sometimes very fine, and I have noticed\r\n    that when the twilight is hastening on, a brighter glow will\r\n    appear, with very vivid and distinct bands of blue and pink,\r\n    alternately shaded off into each other, and radiating from the\r\n    spot when the sun has gone down. The difference in the apparent\r\n    sunset is about half-an-hour between winter and summer. Bright\r\n    as the sky is by day, it is brighter far by night, when the\r\n    spangled heavens are spread out like a curtain. The air is\r\n    so pure that the stars seem to shine with an increasing\r\n    brightness. The Southern Cross is a beautiful object, and so\r\n    different are the heavens from the northern hemisphere, that\r\n    nothing seems to produce the effect of the long distance from\r\n    home so much as the difference of the starry constellations.\r\n    The Milky Way seems to have received fresh refulgence; and all\r\n    is magnificence.\r\n\r\n    The small black ants found in gardens, generally in great\r\n    numbers, are the most annoying of the species; their bite\r\n    produces a burning pain, which must be partly the effect\r\n    of poison, and continues for some time. The red ants very\r\n    soon strip the foliage off trees, which they are constantly\r\n    ascending and descending, one party empty, the other loaded; a\r\n    third party remains in the tree, cutting away whole leaves, so\r\n    that it is no unusual thing to be passing under a tree, and to\r\n    see the leaves falling as it were miraculously. A fourth party\r\n    is employed cutting them up into proper sizes for carrying\r\n    to their nests. Most of these ants, if squeezed between the\r\n    fingers, emit a strong smell of lemon. Rose-buds seem to be\r\n    their most favourite food, and gardens here suffer extremely\r\n    from their ravages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nRIO JANEIRO, CAPITAL OF BRAZIL.\r\n\r\n    Night upon the watery, and daybreak on the land.—Beauty\r\n    of the approaches.—Apprehended retrogression, but real\r\n    progression, in the City.—The stag mania in the tropics,\r\n    and some of its consequences.—Notes on carriages, operas,\r\n    snuff-taking, polking-washerwomen, blacks, whites, odds and\r\n    ends, and things in general, original and imported.—Social,\r\n    sanitary, and governmental matters of divers kinds.—Composition\r\n    of the Brazilian chambers, and business therein.—State\r\n    of parties.—Abolition of the Slave Trade.—Sittings of\r\n    the Senate.—No necessity for Mr. Brotherton in the\r\n    Brazils.—Character of the present Emperor.—Wreck of the\r\n    Pernambucano.—Heroism of a black sailor.—Rigorous regulations\r\n    of the Rio custom-house.—Suggestions for the extension of\r\n    Brazilian commerce, and the prevention of smuggling.—Revisal of\r\n    the Brazilian tariff.—Educational progress since 1808.—French\r\n    literature and fashion.—Provisions in the Rio market.—Monkeys\r\n    and lizards articles of food.—Oranges, bananas, chirimoyas,\r\n    and granadillas.—Difficulties of the Labour Question since\r\n    the suppression of the Slave Trade.—Character of the\r\n    Indians.—State of feeling as regards the coloured people.—Negro\r\n    emancipation ‘looming in the future.’—An experimental trip\r\n    on the Rio and Petropolis railway.—Facts and figures on the\r\n    commercial and monetary connexion between the Empire and\r\n    Great Britain.—Comparative humanity of the Brazilians and\r\n    Uruguayans.—The Slave Trade Question, and European intervention\r\n    in South American politics.—Prospective glance at the\r\n    advantages of steam communication between Brazil and the United\r\n    States.—Authorities of all kinds on these heads; also on the\r\n    territorial pretensions of Brazil, especially in reference to\r\n    the disputes in the River Plate.—Portrait and Memoir of Admiral\r\n    Grenfell.\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS.—As in the case of Bahia, the\r\n    illustrations in this chapter are from Sir W. Gore Ouseley’s\r\n    ‘Sketches in South America,’ the original, however, containing\r\n    no less than thirteen beautiful views of Rio Janeiro and its\r\n    vicinity. In the ‘Key,’ accompanying the drawings, Sir William\r\n    has embodied, in a very graphic manner, the result of his\r\n    experiences in search of the picturesque in the neighbourhood\r\n    of the capital to which he was accredited for several years as\r\n    the representative of England. Describing some of the spots\r\n    he has so faithfully delineated by his pencil, he says:—The\r\n    Sugar-loaf Hills at the entrance of the magnificent harbour of\r\n    Rio de Janeiro, (or simply Rio), literally ‘January River,’ are\r\n    far off discernible, with the lofty Peak of the Corcovado, or\r\n    ‘Hunchback,’ in the back-ground. On entering, the hill to the\r\n    left, called par excellence, the Sugar-loaf, is a prominent\r\n    object; then follows the wooded peninsular hill, on which is\r\n    the Fort St. Juan, united to the base of the Sugar-loaf by the\r\n    Isthmus of the Praya Vermelho, or ‘Red Beach;’ opposite this\r\n    hill lies Fort Santa Cruz, commanding the narrow entrance of\r\n    the harbour. Its formidable batteries of heavy guns are perhaps\r\n    nearer the level of the sea than necessary caution, inspired by\r\n    proximity of the vast Atlantic, would dictate. For, sometimes,\r\n    even placed as they are, twenty or thirty feet above the water,\r\n    the heavy gales from the south-west or south have caused the\r\n    sea to break over these batteries, with sufficient force to\r\n    dismount the cannon, as if they were reeds.\r\n\r\n    The harbour is among the finest in the world; no pilots\r\n    required by night or by day, entering or leaving; no dangers\r\n    not visible, or avoidable with prudence; of course a sailing\r\n    vessel, venturing in or out in very light winds, or if it falls\r\n    suddenly calm, may, by the enormous Atlantic swell, be cast on\r\n    the rocks, when little or no steerage way is imparted by the\r\n    wind.\r\n\r\n    More than one vessel has thus been lost, in the finest weather\r\n    in mid-day; but from attempting to pass the narrow entrance\r\n    of the harbour, without a steady breeze. Steam tugs would\r\n    obviate such danger, and sea and land breezes, excepting at\r\n    some seasons, afford a regular means of entrance or exit to\r\n    those who await their commencement. There are boats with cables\r\n    and anchors in readiness, sometimes inconveniently so, as the\r\n    Argentina experienced at Fort Santa Cruz and Fort St. Juan, on\r\n    the opposite shore, to be sent to vessels in danger. The bay is\r\n    17 miles in length, and 11 in extreme width, and contains many\r\n    small islands, the largest, Ilha do Gobernador, or ‘Governor’s\r\n    Island,’ six miles in length.\r\n\r\n    The city, whose original name was San Sebastian, now altogether\r\n    lost, was founded not long after the discovery of Brazil\r\n    by Cabral in the sixteenth century. It is of oblong shape,\r\n    situated on an elevated tongue of land, the most easterly\r\n    point of which is Punta do Calabouço, (‘Dungeon Point’), and\r\n    the most northerly, opposite to which is the little Ilha das\r\n    Cobras (‘Snake Island’), that of the Armazem do Sal (‘Salt\r\n    Store’). The more ancient north-east part is traversed by eight\r\n    straight, narrow, and parallel, streets, crossed by many others\r\n    at right angles. In these the houses are high, though not quite\r\n    so lofty as those in the metropolis of the mother country; but\r\n    in the new town, built for the most part since the arrival of\r\n    the royal family from Portugal in 1808, they are handsomer,\r\n    being generally of granite. The two towns are separated by the\r\n    Campo de Santa Anna, one of many large squares, agreeable to\r\n    the eye, in consequence of the somewhat fatiguing regularity\r\n    of the streets. Rio, the most important commercial city of\r\n    South America, is naturally, from its position, the great\r\n    mart of Brazil, and its advantages are such as to fit it for\r\n    concentrating the commerce of the globe; but, as we have said\r\n    above, comparatively little has been done to assist nature, so\r\n    far as regards the convenience of the considerable quantity of\r\n    shipping which frequents the port. Lighters are employed in\r\n    loading and discharging all vessels as they lie at anchor in\r\n    the harbour; but Government is now carrying out a plan, by an\r\n    English engineer, for a quay or wharf, to extend between the\r\n    Military and Naval Arsenals, at which sixteen vessels will be\r\n    enabled to unload at once, as well as lighters. This is a step\r\n    in the right direction, and, although even such accommodation\r\n    will not be sufficient to meet the future requirements of Rio,\r\n    there is no doubt that the enlightened spirit which at present\r\n    animates the Brazilian government and nation will induce them\r\n    to execute fresh improvements as their provincial resources\r\n    increase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE PORT OF RIO JANEIRO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the second time I have entered Rio at night and missed the\r\nproverbially fine view of the approaches to the bay.[41] Morning broke\r\namidst drizzling showers, everything looking very gloomy. We were visited\r\nabout breakfast time, and steamed to our regular anchorage, near the\r\nisland where our coal depôt is. I will not indulge in any lengthened\r\ndisquisition upon the merits of the city of Rio Janeiro, so often\r\ndescribed, but content myself with noticing the changes or improvements\r\nthat have taken place since I last visited the place four years back;\r\nor, on the other hand, allude to what many consider as its want of\r\nprogress and the local difficulties which impede its onward march of\r\nevents. As the capital of so large and important an empire, Rio Janeiro\r\nis certainly deserving of a closer analysis than has hitherto been\r\nattempted in any public work with which I am acquainted.[42] The fatal\r\nbarrier to improvement, during the last few years, has been the yellow\r\nfever, which has carried off large numbers of the population, especially\r\nthe industrial and foreign portion, on whom so much depended; whilst\r\nduring the same period the import of slaves from the coast of Africa has\r\nbeen almost entirely suppressed. In this comparatively short space of\r\ntime the spirit of joint-stock enterprise has made considerable advance\r\nhere, resulting in the establishment of a bank, a railway over the flat\r\nground going to Petropolis (nearly completed); other extensive railways\r\nand public roads to the interior, for which contracts are now about\r\nbeing completed; a gas company, to light the city, very far advanced\r\ntowards actual completion, pipes being already laid, lamps erected to\r\nabout one-half of the city, and works building for making the gas, &c.;\r\na company to navigate the River Amazon, which has already commenced\r\noperations with a liberal grant from the government; besides a number\r\nof minor enterprises, all conducive to the comfort and well-being of\r\nthe country. The origin of this movement was no doubt owing to the\r\njoint-stock mania prevailing at home, aided by a superabundance of\r\ncapital from cessation of the slave-trade; and the opportunity was\r\nseized by some patriotic individuals to give a right direction to the\r\npublic mind in the undertakings adverted to. But, as might be expected,\r\nthings got a little wild; shares of every kind were driven up to a very\r\nhigh premium, and a change has followed, detrimental, for the time being,\r\nto practical advancement. Money, so very abundant last year at from 4 to\r\n5 per cent., is now difficult to get at 8 or 10. Many people are locked\r\nup in share transactions, which must take them some time to realize.\r\nIt has been, in fact, a repetition, on a comparatively small scale, of\r\nthose scenes of monetary derangement to which our own country is so often\r\nsubjected, and by the result of which the Brazilians have not taken\r\nwarning. No doubt the effect will soon pass over, there having been no\r\nreal abstraction of capital from the place.\r\n\r\nThe city of Rio Janeiro extends some three miles along the south-west\r\nside of the bay, and being much intersected by hills, it is difficult\r\nto get a good view of the whole range, unless from the top of one of\r\nthe mountains near the city, such as the celebrated ‘Corcovado,’ which\r\nstands out like a pulpit on the plain below, and is some 2,500 feet\r\nperpendicular. The view from this pulpit on a clear day is superb,\r\nand I should say almost unequalled in the world: the city, with its\r\nnumerous divisions and suburbs below you—the bay, extending as far as\r\nthe eye can reach until lost in the plain below the Organ Mountain—the\r\nsea, studded with numerous picturesque islands, with vessels looking\r\nlike white specks upon it, and seen to a great distance—all together\r\nform a most enchanting picture, and amply repay the toil of an ascent.\r\nThe mountain is of granite rock, like all others in this country, but\r\nthickly wooded almost to the summit, and you come out quite suddenly\r\non the bare point before alluded to, so much resembling a pulpit. In\r\nconsequence of the tortuous formation of the streets, constructed round\r\nthe base of the hills, it is difficult to get more than a bird’s-eye view\r\nof the city, on ground made by encroachment on the sea; consequently,\r\nthe streets are low, without drainage, and in several of the back ones\r\nthe water collects and stagnates, to the great detriment of health and\r\ncomfort. Rio itself is a bad copy of Lisbon—streets at right angles, a\r\nlarge square facing the sea, and the suburbs extending up the hills,\r\nwhich everywhere meet your eye. In Lisbon the streets are tolerably\r\nwide, but here they have built them so miserably narrow, that scarcely\r\neven one carriage can pass through, much less pass each other; and it\r\nis evident that such vehicles were never contemplated in the original\r\nformation of these streets. The only way of getting over the difficulty\r\nis for carriages coming into the city to take one line of streets, and\r\nthose leaving it another, which they do, excluding omnibuses altogether\r\nfrom the principal thoroughfares. Improvements in this way were what\r\nI found most backward; indeed there was a marked falling-off in such\r\nrespect since I was last here, and there seems a great want of municipal\r\ngovernment.[43] In many places the pavement is execrable, and generally\r\nvery bad, the difficulty having probably been increased by laying down\r\nmains for water and gas, the latter now in process of execution, and also\r\nto heavy rains having washed away many parts of the road, and otherwise\r\ncaused much damage. Once this troublesome job is got through, it is to\r\nbe hoped some effective measures will be taken to put the streets and\r\nbranch-roads in order; otherwise they will soon be rendered impassable.\r\nCoach and coach spring making must be thriving trades here, especially\r\nwith the immense increase that has taken place in the number of carriages\r\nand omnibuses; and it is really wonderful how they stand the continual\r\nshocks they have to endure.[44] Government seems at last alive to the\r\nabsolute necessity of doing something to improve the sanitary condition\r\nof the city, and also its internal organization, as they have lately\r\ngot out some good practical English engineers, who I have no doubt\r\nwill suggest an effective mode of dealing with present difficulties.\r\nIf they do not adopt decisive measures, the rate of mortality may be\r\nexpected to augment fearfully in a dense population of 300,000 to 400,000\r\ninhabitants, huddled together in some 15,000 houses, surrounded by\r\nimpurities of every kind, not the least being the stagnant water in the\r\nstreets. No exact census has ever been taken of the population of Rio\r\nJaneiro, which is generally believed to be between the two figures above\r\ngiven. There is a migratory population, but the accumulation of humanity\r\nof every race and colour, contained in some of the large dwelling-houses,\r\nis something extraordinary. As before observed, nature has done much for\r\nthis country, and if the natural facilities of Rio Janeiro were properly\r\navailed of, and local improvements carried out with energy and spirit, it\r\nmight be rendered one of the finest and most luxurious places within the\r\ntropics.[45] The opportunity is now open to them; the government possess\r\nample means, and it is just a question whether measures of progress are\r\nto be effectively achieved, or the city to be abandoned to its fate. The\r\ngreat evil attending all improvement in Brazil is an undue appreciation\r\nof native capability, and a disparagement or distrust of those whose\r\npractical experience would enable them to grapple with the difficulties\r\nthat surround them—a kind of little jealousy and mistrust that prevents\r\ntheir availing themselves of opportunities thrown in their way to carry\r\nout undertakings necessary to the well-being of the country; nor can\r\nthey understand the principle on which such things are regulated in\r\nEngland, still less the magnitude of operations carried on there and in\r\nmany other parts of Europe. Yet the time seems to be coming when these\r\nprinciples will be better understood here, and when the application of\r\nEnglish capital towards the improvement of the country may be safely and\r\nlegitimately brought to bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERRA DOS ORGAOS—CABECA DO FRAILE, RIO JANEIRO.]\r\n\r\nThe political and social position of this great empire, whose influence\r\nand example are of such incalculable importance to the present, and\r\nstill more to the future, of the whole continent of South America, must\r\nnecessarily be a subject of anxiety to all who wish to see it prosper,\r\nand who are at the same time practically acquainted with the difficulties\r\nthat have to be overcome in the maintenance of its present system of a\r\nrepresentative government. Without attempting anything in the shape of\r\na history of that government, or of the circumstances which led to its\r\nformation and have ensured its consolidation, a few particulars may not\r\nbe unacceptable to such readers as have not had their attention directed\r\nto the subject. After the expulsion of the Portuguese in 1822, Don Pedro\r\nwas declared Emperor, and, in 1824, the constitution, which is a very\r\nclose imitation of our own, was proclaimed. The government is confided\r\nto ministers chosen by the Emperor; there is a chamber of deputies, 548\r\nin number, elected by the towns and 18 provinces, and a senate or upper\r\nchamber, consisting of 54 members, titled and untitled, the numbers in\r\nboth being limited, and titles are not hereditary. Hence, though there\r\nare, we believe, upwards of 20 marquises, 7 counts, 29 viscounts, and 32\r\nbarons, the sons of these do not succeed to the titular distinction of\r\ntheir fathers, notwithstanding the honours emanating from a crown that\r\nis hereditary. The business of the country passes under the same sort of\r\ndiscussion, and just with as much freedom of debate, but not more, than\r\nwith us; and according to the support given or withheld by the chambers\r\nis the government strong or weak. The revenue of the empire is accounted\r\nfor, and finds its way into the national treasury at Rio de Janeiro;\r\nand hence the difficulty encountered in dealing with its distribution,\r\nas each representative of a province naturally wishes to favour his own\r\nconstituency, and is opposed to what he may think an undue proportion\r\nof expenditure lavished, and of interest taken, in the province already\r\nfavoured with the establishment of the capital and the residence of the\r\ncourt, and where the largest population centres. This is one of their\r\ngreat legislative difficulties, which gives rise to long and violent\r\ndiscussions. Another is the existence of two factions in the state, the\r\nold Portuguese and the purely Brazilian party. Some years back the former\r\nheld the reins, and were the supposed abettors of the slave-trade; but\r\nsince 1848 the present ministry, mostly composed of pure Brazilians, have\r\nretained office, and been enabled to carry out most stringent measures\r\nfor putting down that abominable traffic, which is for the present not\r\nonly suppressed, but its restoration is impossible,[46] owing, first,\r\nto the complete revulsion that has taken place in public opinion, and,\r\nsecondly, to the new direction that has been given to the employment\r\nof capital, as explained in our chapters on Pernambuco and Bahia. To\r\nsuch lengths have an honest and energetic administration, supported by\r\na high-minded sovereign, jealous of the honour of his country, and,\r\nabove all, of its credit for integrity in adhering to its engagements,\r\nbeen able to act upon this truly national sentiment, that many of the\r\ninfluential Portuguese, known to be actively engaged in the traffic, and\r\nsome of whom had sunk vast sums in its prosecution, have been banished\r\nthe country. Five years is a long time for a ministry to retain office\r\nin any country; for even in our own that period far exceeds the average\r\nduration of a British cabinet, at least during the last three reigns;\r\nconsequently, the greater the wonder at the stability of one in a country\r\nsuch as Brazil, and under many trying circumstances. Not the least\r\nembarrassing of these was the perpetual interference of England to put\r\ndown the external symptoms of the slave-trade, though Brazilian ministers\r\nwere doing it in a manner so rapid and effectual as to constitute one of\r\nthe most startling and complete social revolutions ever recorded in the\r\nhistory of any nation in the world as the work of half-a-dozen ages, much\r\nless of half-a-dozen years.[47] This speaks well indeed for the personal\r\nability as well as for the representative system under which the existing\r\nministry govern, as without a decided majority in the chambers they could\r\nnot possibly endure a single session. Brazilian policy and Brazilian\r\nviews seem to be now much more firmly established in the legislature, and\r\nthe native party greatly preponderates. Still this clashing of interests\r\ntends to impede the regular march of business, by giving rise to endless\r\npersonal discussion and personal invective. The chamber of deputies and\r\nthe senate are a long way apart from each other, which must occasion\r\ninconvenience, and destroy that prompt action and unity of purpose so\r\nnecessary in a legislative assembly. The locality ought always to be the\r\nsame, with the monarch as the head, opening and closing the sessions\r\nunder the same building. Considering their late elevation to political\r\ndistinction, some of the deputies and senators of Brazil display no\r\nsmall amount of oratorical, and, what is still more valuable, debating,\r\nability; whilst many of the former must make a great sacrifice of time\r\nand personal convenience in spending so many months away from their\r\nfamilies and estates, which are difficult to be reached in a country\r\nwhere the means of travelling are comparatively so primitive, and the\r\ndistance to be traversed generally very great. The hours of discussion\r\nin the chambers are as much too brief as ours are too long, being only\r\nfrom 11 a.m. to 2 or 2.30 p.m., during which one orator will often occupy\r\nthe time for speaking sake only, and the business of the day has to be\r\nadjourned; whereas if ministers, with no Mr. Brotherton to be afraid\r\nof, could keep them at it occasionally until midnight, or 2 or 3 in the\r\nmorning, it would tire out declaimers, who seek only to pander to the\r\nappetite for fervid or piquant rhetorical popularity, and would insure\r\nquicker despatch of the business in hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AQUEDUCT AND CONVENT OF SAINT TERESA. RIO JANEIRO.]\r\n\r\nThe present Emperor is in every respect admirably fitted for his high\r\nstation. Born in the country, without the advantage of a knowledge of\r\nEuropean life, and that finished tone of education it affords, but\r\npossessed of natural endowments of an exalted order, and having turned\r\nto the utmost advantage the opportunities of a studious and virtuous\r\nyouth, he carries with him the full national sympathies of the native\r\nBrazilians, the respect of the old Portuguese party, and the esteem\r\nof the whole foreign diplomatic body, to whom he dispenses the honours\r\nand hospitality of a prudently managed court. As the sovereign of a\r\nconstitutional country, content to abide within the strict limits imposed\r\nby his coronation oath, his reign has been prosperous and happy. In his\r\nprivate capacity he is kind and attentive to all around him, as well as\r\na close observer of passing events. Possessed of a benevolent heart,\r\nand actuated by a noble singleness of purpose, he knows how to direct\r\nthe reins of government, without undue interference or an injudicious\r\nexercise of his prerogative. It has often been emphatically said that\r\nthe Emperor is not only the highest, but the best man in the country,\r\nboth from his public conduct and his private virtues. The value of such a\r\ncompliment is not enhanced, or probably we should say is not impaired, by\r\nany universal laxity and corruption around him, as in the case of another\r\nempire nearer home, wherein it is said that the principal personage is\r\nnot only the most honest, but the only honest, man in his own dominions.\r\nProbity[48] and high-mindedness of every kind in public life are as\r\ngeneral in Brazil as in any part of Europe, England itself certainly not\r\nexcepted; consequently the standard the Emperor is measured by is one by\r\nno means conventional or equivocal, but is such as any sovereign in the\r\nwestern world might feel proud of having applied to himself. Certainly,\r\nin the matter of truthfulness, the rarest of all monarchic virtues,\r\nhe has set an example to the royal brotherhood of kings that might be\r\nfollowed with infinite profit to the reputation of the regal race, and\r\nwith corresponding advantage to their subjects in numerous instances. His\r\nBrazilian Majesty is admirably supported by an excellent and high-minded\r\npartner, who, like her husband, is beloved by all classes in the empire.\r\nThe imperial couple frequently attend public balls, and mix in social\r\nparties with citizens and foreigners, taking also the warmest interest in\r\nall local improvements, or measures calculated to benefit the country,\r\nand to raise the character of their subjects. When the kind of life they\r\nare compelled to lead is fairly considered, and the extent of court\r\nintrigue necessarily prevailing where parties are so much divided and\r\nrespectively so potent, too much merit cannot be ascribed to the Emperor\r\nand Empress for the manner in which they conduct themselves, and the\r\ncontrolling influence they exercise over others. Every one who has been\r\nin Rio well knows how exceedingly popular he is, and how strong is the\r\nconviction that that popularity is most just and most deserved, though\r\nhe never goes out of his way to obtain it by any _ad captandum_ arts, or\r\nany conduct whatever that is not the result of sound judgment guiding\r\nan estimable nature. M. Reybaud, a Frenchman, in a biographical memoir,\r\nwhich appeared also in English in one of our illustrated journals at the\r\nclose of the year before last, says:\r\n\r\n    ‘But the great work of Don Pedro the 2nd, a work at once of\r\n    humanity and policy, and which will be his indelible title of\r\n    glory in the eyes of Europe, is, that of having openly attacked\r\n    the national prejudice of the necessity of black slaves, and\r\n    having overcome it. Thanks to him, thanks to his Ministers and\r\n    the Legislative Chambers of Rio, the traffic is henceforth\r\n    definitively suppressed in Brazil, for the people have\r\n    understood and accepted the Imperial policy, which has for its\r\n    motto, “No more traffic in slaves; European colonization.” Such\r\n    is at this moment the cry of all Brazil. The agriculturists\r\n    themselves, until lately insensible to the anathemas of\r\n    philanthropy, have opened their eyes, and joined the Government\r\n    and the Chambers in demanding the deliverance of the country\r\n    from the living leprosy of the slave traffic. It was imperative\r\n    that it should. It was indispensable that the country should\r\n    associate itself with the measures of the Government, for up\r\n    to this time the laws that were made were not carried out, and\r\n    the people who thought them prejudicial to their interests did\r\n    not scruple to infringe them. The policy of the Emperor and\r\n    the Brazilian Chambers was very simple and sensible. It was\r\n    not sufficient to decree the suppression of the traffic, but\r\n    it was necessary to open up to the agriculturists new ways and\r\n    means by which they should, within a longer or shorter delay,\r\n    dispense with black labourers. The Legislature, to provide\r\n    for this necessity, took proper means to attract European\r\n    colonization. Several attempts tried on this new basis have\r\n    been attended with the happiest results. Little colonies have\r\n    sprung up, especially in the south of the empire, and are in\r\n    a flourishing condition. The planters and landed proprietors\r\n    throughout the empire give a decided preference to free over\r\n    slave labour, as experience teaches them that it is infinitely\r\n    to their advantage.’\r\n\r\nIt is impossible too highly to eulogise the conduct of his Imperial\r\nMajesty in reference to the slave trade; but as one evidence, which\r\nmay be useful by way of example in a certain portion of the world that\r\nregards itself as far more advanced than Brazil, I transcribe the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter dated Rio, November 14th, 1853, and which\r\nappeared in some of the English papers in January last:—\r\n\r\n    ‘The “Pernambucana,” one of the vessels of the Brazilian Steam\r\n    Packet Company, was wrecked near St. Catherine’s, and upwards\r\n    of 40 passengers drowned. This disaster afforded an opportunity\r\n    for a display of heroism and bravery rarely equalled. A black\r\n    sailor, belonging to the vessel, succeeded with many others\r\n    in reaching the shore; numbers had perished in the attempt,\r\n    and but few of the passengers remained upon the wreck. All of\r\n    these, including a mother and six children, did Simon save. It\r\n    is pleasing to add that the Brazilians were by no means slow\r\n    in marking their appreciation of, and rewarding, this heroic\r\n    action. A subscription was opened in the Praça do Commercio,\r\n    and the amount subscribed in two days exceeded seven contos\r\n    of reis, or about £800. The Emperor and Empress, whose hands\r\n    are always open for the succour of the needy, or the reward\r\n    of the meritorious, contributed 900 milreis, and the total\r\n    amount already received approaches to £1,000. In addition to\r\n    this, a statue of the black is to be placed in the exchange. An\r\n    unfortunate circumstance, peculiarly annoying to our English\r\n    community in Rio, may be noticed in connection with this\r\n    affair. The promoters of the subscription, persons of great\r\n    influence and respectability, brought the black to the Praça\r\n    do Commercio, not merely to gratify the curiosity of those who\r\n    were anxious to see one become so celebrated, but to afford\r\n    any information which parties connected with the victims or\r\n    survivors might require. The director of the month, who was\r\n    unfortunately an Englishman, objected to the presence of a\r\n    black in the _sala_, and in spite of the remonstrances of all\r\n    present, insisted upon his immediate removal. This arbitrary\r\n    proceeding has called forth some severe articles in the public\r\n    papers, and it is provoking that one of us who pretend to\r\n    so much philanthropy for the race should have shown so much\r\n    prejudice against the colour. This heroic fellow, with whom the\r\n    Emperor of the Brazils expressed himself proud to shake hands,\r\n    was driven from the exchange because he was an African! And by\r\n    an Englishman!’\r\n\r\nI cannot learn that this conduct has called for any reprobation in\r\nEngland; that there have been any encomiums passed by our abolitionist\r\npress or declaimers on the monarch of that country wherein partiality\r\nfor the slave trade was declared by the highest authority amongst us\r\nto be ineradicable, except by violent measures on the part of England.\r\nNor, indeed, can I find that there has been the least desire to make the\r\n_amende_ in any way to Brazil for all the calumnies so long heaped upon\r\nher; for even that portion of the Slave Trade Treaties Report quoted,\r\nwhich relates to Brazil (and which has been circulated throughout the\r\nBrazilian press), has been passed over with indifference by our purists\r\nand censors. Nay, more, within a very short period preceding the date\r\nof these remarks, a tale of horrors was tricked out for the regalement\r\nof our _gobemouche_ public in this country by a pair of travelling\r\nphilanthropic malevolents concerning a certain planter in Pernambuco\r\ninviting his brother planters of the province to a grand spectacle of\r\nboiling a slave alive; and the name of her Britannic Majesty’s consul\r\nwas actually adduced as that of a witness to the act. The absurdity was,\r\nof course, scouted in Brazil as the conjuration of a diseased fancy; but\r\nthe journals here that gave currency to the figment have evinced small\r\nalacrity in recording the contradiction elicited on the spot. So in the\r\ncase of the imperial conduct towards Simon. Had the President of the\r\nUnited States acted as the Emperor did in this instance, or had a North\r\nAmerican Uncle Tom performed any portion of what the Brazilian black\r\nachieved, dramas and novels by the score would have appeared, and, in\r\nfact, we should never have heard the last of it.[49]\r\n\r\nThough she has made wonderful strides in the right direction—advances\r\npositively marvellous, considering the locality, and even as contrasted\r\nwith what would have been the case in England at this present day, had\r\na large section of otherwise enlightened men amongst us had had their\r\nway—still, commercially speaking, Brazil has yet much to do in the shape\r\nof reform. A great deal of the old leaven of Portuguese exclusiveness and\r\nexaction remain to this day, although it is not carried to such an absurd\r\nextent as at Lisbon, where is placed in the hands of every shipmaster\r\nvisiting the port a document,[50] which, considering that its provisions\r\nare enforced by a civilised mercantile nation of Europe in the second\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century, and in a great port whence once sailed\r\nsome of the mightiest maritime enterprises in history, deserves to be\r\nregarded as a curiosity of commercial literature, and is preserved as\r\nsuch in a note. No wonder the trade of Lisbon should dwindle down to\r\na mere cypher, and the finances of the country be in so deplorable a\r\nstate. Any nation issuing such a document as this places itself on a\r\npar with, if not on a lower footing than, China or Japan. In Brazilian\r\nports you have the same ordeal of health visits, police, and custom-house\r\nsearchers, before you can even leave the ship; and if a vessel arrives\r\nafter dusk, no matter where from, coasting or otherwise, she must remain\r\ntill morning for the visit, after which she is a kind of custom-house\r\nprey, watched and pounced upon in every possible manner, if all is not\r\nfound to be strictly in accordance with the long string of regulations,\r\nnumbered like a criminal code; and woe betide the unfortunate shipmaster\r\nor merchant, importing goods, who innocently falls into the trap laid\r\nfor him. It is a case of heavy fines, damages, and often confiscation\r\nof ship or property; although it can be clearly and satisfactorily\r\nproved that no one is to blame in the matter, and that there has been\r\nno fraudulent intention whatever. The stipulations of the custom-house\r\ncode are being continually infringed, and yet, like the laws of the Medes\r\nand Persians, it altereth not! All this is very sad, and unworthy of a\r\ncountry that looks to commerce for its intercourse with Europe, and as a\r\nmain source of revenue and social progress. The only excuse lies in the\r\nforce of habit, founded on inveterate prejudice, bequeathed by the old\r\nsuperannuated mother country.[51]\r\n\r\nIt is true that our own fiscal system twenty years ago contained much of\r\nthe objectionable matter alluded to, although it was never distinguished\r\nby those absurd forms and regulations that are not only a check to\r\npersonal liberty, but involve the loss of much valuable time. If some\r\npublic-spirited minister, who took a right and far-seeing view of the\r\ntrue interests of Brazil, were to grapple fairly with this subject, and\r\nhad the moral courage to bring forward liberal measures, I firmly believe\r\nthat he would carry them. For instance, let him abolish the farce of\r\nvisiting vessels, both inwards and outwards, for sanitary or other state\r\npurposes; and as regards customs’ revenue, once let the duties be reduced\r\nto a scale that would render smuggling unprofitable, and there would be\r\nno need of a commercial code or of fines and restrictions. All experience\r\nproves that where duties have to be levied for the absolute necessities\r\nof the state, the more moderate the scale the less chance there is for\r\nsmuggling, and the greater the increase and encouragement to consumption\r\nof the articles imported, which can then be sold at cheaper rates. It is\r\nnotorious that for many years after the trade with Brazil was opened,\r\nnot half, probably not a quarter, of the duties entitled to be levied\r\nfound their way into the public treasury; and although a good deal of\r\nthis iniquity has been done away with by the firmness of a few public\r\nservants,[52] yet the temptation remains, and some parties still profit\r\nby illegal importation at the expense of legitimate traders. I repeat my\r\nstrong conviction that Brazil might derive a much larger revenue under\r\na moderate scale of duties, and she could then afford to wipe away all\r\nthe existing restrictions on commerce and shipping. It is true that she\r\nhas done something, both in reduction of her tariff as well as of her\r\nanchorage dues, a step in the right direction, which, for her own sake,\r\nit is devoutly to be hoped she will soon follow up vigorously.\r\n\r\nAs regards the social condition of the Brazilian empire, there is\r\ndoubtless still much room for improvement. Where is there not? But when\r\nwe recollect that until 1808 there was not a printing-press in the whole\r\ncountry—and now behold no large town without its journal, generally very\r\nadmirably managed, and when we see educational establishments, many on a\r\nvery large and highly efficient scale, in nearly every province of the\r\nempire—certainly we cannot say her progress has been slow. Previously to\r\nthat time the only instruction imparted was through the convents, and\r\nconsequently it was tinctured with all the old monastic and narrow-minded\r\nleaven attached to those institutions, whose downfall in Spain and\r\nPortugal was soon followed by similar measures in Brazil. Secular\r\neducation became extended; seminaries and schools were established,\r\nboth under the patronage of government and by private individuals;\r\nnewspapers increased, and are now multiplied to the number of upwards of\r\n50, including scientific and literary; and the whole course of things\r\nwas changed; but without so far resulting in any general plan by which\r\ninstruction is communicated to the masses of the people. French being the\r\nprincipal medium of intercommunication between the better classes and\r\nall foreigners, and being very generally spoken, publications in that\r\nlanguage are necessarily most in request; and an assortment of French\r\nreading of the latest Parisian stamp may be had in Rio equal to what is\r\nprocurable in any second-rate town in the country it comes from. It is\r\nneedless to say that French fashions, in other than strictly intellectual\r\nitems, prevail among all the educated classes in the Brazilian capital;\r\nand by ministering to such tastes a large number of native French derive\r\nconsiderable profit. In addition to the educational advantages already\r\nenumerated, and the list might be greatly extended were we to include\r\nthe libraries, &c., some excellent institutions of a charitable nature\r\nabound, as well as hospitals; the one last founded of this class at Rio\r\nis on a most magnificent scale, in a small bay near the entrance of the\r\nport, where an admirably executed marble statue of the Emperor has also\r\nbeen most fittingly placed.[53] As it is under his auspices it has been\r\ncommenced, and by his munificence and example, and that of his estimable\r\nconsort, it has become one of the noblest edifices of the kind in\r\nexistence on either side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAnother of the social evils of Brazil is the difficulty of obtaining a\r\nlabouring population, a necessity consequent on the importation of slaves\r\nhaving ceased. It is one which, unless seriously and promptly dealt\r\nwith, must entail very momentous consequences: a continuous immigration\r\nof free labourers appears to be the only solution of the question. But\r\nwhence are they to come in anything like the required numbers? It is\r\nquite clear that European labourers cannot work with slaves, nor will\r\nthe hardy islanders of the Atlantic consent to do so; people, moreover,\r\nare needed who can bear the climate, and will put up with hardships\r\nwhich only those acclimated can be expected to endure—that is, the\r\nclimate of the more torrid parts of the Brazils; for there are vast\r\nregions, larger than the whole United Kingdom, where out-door labour is\r\nperfectly practicable to natives of Great Britain, and where some of such\r\nnatives have settled and prospered as agriculturists, as we shall have\r\noccasion to refer to in speaking of the Banda Oriental, in respect to the\r\nadjoining Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. The only alternative\r\nseems to be coolies from China; and with the present propensities of\r\nthat class, no doubt numbers would flock to Brazil, if the needful\r\nencouragement and facilities were given. At all events the experiment\r\nmight easily be tried, and the sooner it is done the better.[54] Some\r\nparties are sanguine enough to believe that the aborigines of the\r\ncountry, the remnants of the Indian tribes, might be brought under\r\ncivilized rule, and instructed so as eventually to be rendered capable\r\nof replacing slaves; but this plan seems very problematical, unless in\r\nthose districts where they have already been accustomed to mingle and\r\nwork with the other inhabitants, as in the northern provinces of Bahia\r\nand Pernambuco. In the latter province especially, there is a very fine\r\nrace of men called Sertanejos, who make good labourers, and are very\r\nuseful in bringing produce to market by means of horses. The number of\r\nmen so employed may be imagined when, by the law of Pernambuco, one man\r\nmust accompany every horse; and in the busy season 2,000 horses have been\r\nknown to pass the toll-bar inwards, and the same number outwards, making\r\naltogether 4,000, although the edict alluded to is not very strictly\r\nenforced, the distance travelled by these horses being from 50 to 300\r\nmiles. It is literally impossible to form a proximate conjecture as to\r\nthe number of Indians in Brazil, the estimates of various authorities\r\nranging from one-fourth of a million to a million and a half, divided\r\ninto Indios, Mansos, and Tapirios; the former partially civilized and\r\nspeaking some Portuguese, the latter still savage. Nearly all the\r\ntribes are of large stature; and though exceedingly low in the scale of\r\ncivilization, possess many of the virtues of the barbarian, especially\r\nwhen uncontaminated by the vices of the white man, or proximity to him.\r\nFor the most part they are warlike, the climate by no means enervating\r\ntheir bodies or subduing their spirit; and though in some respects\r\nferocious when excited, the practice of cannibalism towards prisoners\r\ntaken in battle is quite extinct, if indeed it ever really existed.\r\nSome of the tribes exhibit an extraordinary antipathy to the negroes,\r\nwhich is the more remarkable as the marriages of people of colour\r\nwith whites are very common, and degrees of black that would throw a\r\ncitizen of the United States into a fever of indignation are looked\r\nupon with philosophic indifference, both by Brazilians and natives of\r\nPortugal in Brazil. Probably this is one reason why slaves in Brazil\r\nare treated with a kindness and humanity altogether unexampled in any\r\nother part of the world, a fact upon which all authorities are agreed,\r\nnotwithstanding some shocking exceptions that were wont to be practised\r\ntowards newly-imported unfortunates from the coast of Africa, a custom\r\nnow fortunately at an end. No doubt a wise and conciliatory policy\r\nexercised towards those Indian tribes who still occupy large districts of\r\nBrazil would be attended with beneficial results; but this is a work of\r\ntime. What the country now wants is immediate labour, and for a supply\r\nof this, emigration of some kind is the only available source. The towns\r\nare already beginning to feel the effects of the diminution, and wages\r\nhave consequently risen considerably; whilst in the interior the value\r\nof slaves has greatly increased, a preliminary perhaps to their future\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of Rio improvements, I may note an\r\ninteresting excursion made over a short line of railway, and the first\r\never attempted in this country, which is to connect the city with\r\nPetropolis (the mountain and summer residence of the court and upper\r\nclasses), and which was recorded as below in the ‘Journal do Commercio’\r\nof the 6th September, 1853, the day on which we left Rio for the River\r\nPlate.[55]\r\n\r\nRespecting the mercantile position of Brazil generally, I turned with\r\nsome considerable curiosity to the edition published in the course of\r\nthe present year, 1854, of ‘M’Culloch’s Commercial Dictionary,’ a work\r\nof deserved authority and influence, as every business man is aware,\r\nthough, I regret to be obliged to add, the article on the country I\r\nam now treating of does not sustain the character to which the volume\r\nis in so many other respects entitled. I had expected, as the result\r\nof recent events in Brazil, some marked modification in the writer’s\r\nopinions as expressed under this head in former editions, but could find\r\nnone; and indeed the whole of his remarks, which I annex, would appear,\r\nfrom internal evidence, to be as emphatic as in previous editions,\r\nnotwithstanding the date on his title-page, and his assertion in the\r\npreface that the latest information had been brought to bear on every\r\npoint. He says:—\r\n\r\n    ‘The imports into Brazil, which are chiefly from Great Britain,\r\n    consist principally of our cottons, woollens, linen, iron and\r\n    steel, hardware, butter, and other articles, amounting in all,\r\n    in ordinary years, to about £2,500,000. It is frequently,\r\n    no doubt, said that our exports to Brazil amount to double\r\n    that sum, or to more than £5,000,000. But there is no room\r\n    or ground for any such statement. The return is not derived\r\n    from Brazil, but from our own Custom-house; and there is no\r\n    reason why the merchants should undervalue the exports to\r\n    Brazil more than to any other country. The commercial policy of\r\n    Brazil has, on the whole, been characterised by considerable\r\n    liberality. The duties on imports and exports have been\r\n    mostly moderate, and have been imposed more for the sake of\r\n    revenue than of protection. In October, 1847, the legislature\r\n    of Brazil issued a decree, imposing 33⅓ per cent. higher\r\n    duties on the ships and produce of those nations which did\r\n    not admit the ships and produce of Brazil into their ports\r\n    on a fair footing of reciprocity. This decree was, in part,\r\n    provoked by our policy in regard to the slave trade, and was\r\n    in avowed retaliation of the high discriminating duties we\r\n    had imposed on Brazilian and other slave-grown sugar. But the\r\n    modified views of the Brazilian government in regard to the\r\n    slave-trade, and the admission of slave-grown sugars into our\r\n    markets under reasonable duties, which are to be equalised\r\n    with those on British colonial sugars in 1854, occasioned, in\r\n    1849, the revocation of the discriminating duties referred\r\n    to. A provincial duty of 15 per cent., imposed in some of\r\n    the provinces on hides and other articles, has also been\r\n    repealed. Great Britain enjoys the largest share of the trade\r\n    of Brazil; and that share will, it is probable, be a good deal\r\n    increased, when the duties on foreign and colonial sugars are\r\n    equalised in 1854. The abolition of the discriminating duty on\r\n    foreign coffee in the course of the year 1851 has occasioned\r\n    a considerable increase in the imports of Brazilian coffee.\r\n    The commerce of Brazil has sustained great injury from the\r\n    wretched state of the currency and of the finances; the value\r\n    of the former, which consists almost wholly of paper, being\r\n    excessively depreciated and liable to extreme fluctuations,\r\n    and the revenue being inadequate to meet the expenditure.\r\n    Latterly, however, vigorous efforts have been made to increase\r\n    the revenue; and it is hoped that, in the event of the finances\r\n    being placed on a better footing, measures may also be taken to\r\n    improve the currency.’\r\n\r\nThe concluding passage, as to the inadequacy of the income to the\r\nexpenditure, is altogether questionable; and the admission of such an\r\nassertion into a work of the character just quoted from, betrays a\r\ndetermination altogether inexplicable, for of course it is impossible\r\nto put it down to the score of ignorance. The rapid and progressive\r\nliquidation of the national debt, and the unfailing punctuality of the\r\ndividends, added to the price Brazilian stocks command in the British\r\nmarket, sufficiently bespeak the healthiness of Brazilian finance. I have\r\nnot been able to discover upon what data it is that Mr. M’Culloch fixes\r\nthe annual imports of British produce into Brazil at so low a figure as\r\nhe mentions in the foregoing extract, and which figure has appeared in\r\nsuccessive editions of his work for many years back. But it is quite\r\nincorrect; and, at least, as much below the actual amount as the one\r\nhe condemns as too high. A witness before the committee on Slave Trade\r\nTreaties last year, a gentleman officially connected with the Brazilian\r\nembassy, and having the best means of knowing the accuracy of what he\r\nsaid, declared the amount of trade during the year 1852 between Great\r\nBritain and the Brazils to be about three millions and a half sterling\r\nper annum of imports, entirely from England. Those imports[56] are sold\r\nthere on one year’s credit; so that every year there are £7,000,000 of\r\nEnglish goods in Brazil. There is always a deposit of British goods equal\r\nto one year’s consumption, and one year’s consumption due. Besides that,\r\nthere is a national debt to England of £6,000,000 sterling; Brazil has to\r\npay interest for that. Then there is the internal debt, where £600,000 of\r\nbonds belong to Englishmen; which makes a total of £13,600,000 of British\r\nproperty engaged in Brazil.\r\n\r\nHence, then, the magnitude of the interests in this country as affected\r\nby our relations with Brazil. Nor are the interests of humanity at large\r\non a less extensive scale. The witness last adverted to—and I can state\r\nof my own knowledge that the authority he adduces is a most competent\r\none—an Englishman long resident in Brazil, in the public service of that\r\ncountry, says:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Allow me to cite from the writings of an Englishman who\r\n    appears to be very well acquainted with the affairs of the\r\n    Brazils: it is an article about a book published by Sir\r\n    Woodbine Parish, from the British Quarterly Review for\r\n    February, 1853. The book is about the River Plate, but there\r\n    are in the article of the Review two or three little passages\r\n    to which I will beg the attention of the Committee; beginning\r\n    about the attack of Caseros, where Rosas had been put down.\r\n    He says, “On this occasion, however, the Brazilian alliance\r\n    introduced a regular, well disciplined, and properly commanded\r\n    army into the contest, and in the hour of Buenos Ayrean defeat,\r\n    it was to its humanity, order, discipline, and obedience that\r\n    the troops of Rosas appealed; Surrender to the blue pants\r\n    (so the Brazilian infantry was termed), they do not kill!\r\n    was their cry.” This is to prove that Brazilians are not so\r\n    blackened in civilization as they generally think in Europe,\r\n    and not so inhuman; “and thus a body not exceeding 3,000 men\r\n    had upwards of 5,000 prisoners, not one of whom was injured; on\r\n    the contrary, a contingent of Rosas’ army refused to surrender\r\n    to the Oriental forces of Urquiza; but on the appearance of\r\n    a Brazilian officer (Captain Petra) at once laid down their\r\n    arms; nor was this example of humanity lost on the Argentines\r\n    themselves, in the subsequent occurrences at Buenos Ayres.”\r\n    I have read that to show that the Brazilian people are ill\r\n    judged of, and that they are more desirous to put an end to\r\n    slavery than they have had credit for, on account of the point\r\n    of civilization they have come to, and on account of the\r\n    circumstance of its being to their interest. The article of the\r\n    Review contains still the following observations: “Nor ought\r\n    the events we have narrated to be uninstructive to Europe; for\r\n    they teach the impolicy of England and France attempting to\r\n    precipitate, either by diplomatic or military agency, events in\r\n    distant countries, whose circumstances they are so imperfectly\r\n    acquainted with; and the shortsightedness of prohibiting the\r\n    intervention of a nation materially and geographically, as well\r\n    as politically, concerned. They teach us also the dignity and\r\n    office of the Empire of Brazil in the political system of the\r\n    world; and how much more that state may be made to contribute\r\n    its share to the great mass of human happiness, by promoting\r\n    its welfare, than, as has been done, by wounding its pride.”\r\n    Thus by promoting its welfare, and coming to an amicable\r\n    understanding with it, there would have been a much fairer\r\n    result, perhaps much quicker, than by wounding its pride, and\r\n    by much stronger measures.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH OF THE NOSSA SENOR A DA GLORIA, AND AQUEDUCT, RIO\r\nDE JANEIRO.]\r\n\r\nThis is most just and true; and though the cause of irritation to Brazil,\r\nindirectly glanced at in the concluding sentence, has happily passed\r\naway, it is no less necessary to remember with what forbearance that\r\ncountry endured the slights and indignities put upon her, and with what\r\nmagnanimity she forbore from soliciting the aid of a neighbouring nation\r\nthat might have required small inducement to vindicate the honour and\r\ninviolability of the Brazilian flag; for there cannot be a question\r\nthat the government of Washington would very gladly avail itself of any\r\nopportunity that might contribute to strengthen the connection between\r\nthe States and Brazil, though it is remarkable that some attempt of the\r\nkind has not been made, in the mode of which the establishment of such a\r\nsteam company as the one I represent is an example.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE OF BRAZIL.\r\n\r\n(STATISTICS LATELY ISSUED SHOW THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE RESULTS IN ROUND\r\nNUMBERS.)\r\n\r\n1839 and 1844.—Average annual value of imports and exports, 13 millions\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\n1845 and 1849.—Average annual value was 16 millions sterling, or an\r\nincrease of 3 millions.\r\n\r\nIn this latter period the average yearly number of vessels employed was\r\n\r\n             10,694; tonnage, 1,937,944;\r\n             ------           ---------\r\n    of which  5,464     ”       953,654 inw.\r\n              5,230     ”       914,290 outw.\r\n             ------           ---------\r\n    vessels, 10,694     tons, 1,937,944\r\n             ------           ---------\r\n\r\nshowing an average increase over the former period of 1839 to 1844 of\r\n\r\n    vessels, 34 per cent.\r\n    tonnage, 42    ”\r\n\r\nOf the above figures, the imports averaged\r\n\r\n    in value,      49 per cent,\r\n        exports,   51    ”\r\n                  ---\r\n                  100\r\n                  ---\r\n\r\nDuring the same period, the proportions of foreign and coasting trade\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n    foreign imports and exports, 76 per cent.\r\n    coasting      ”      ”       24    ”\r\n                                ---\r\n                                100\r\n                                ---\r\n\r\nOf the aforesaid total imports and exports,\r\n\r\n    Great Britain figures for 36 per cent.\r\n    United States     ”       16    ”\r\n    other parts of the world  58    ”\r\n                             ---\r\n                             100\r\n                             ---\r\n\r\nAnd in the total value of imports,\r\n\r\n    Great Britain figures for 50 per cent.\r\n    France            ”       10    ”\r\n    United States     ”       11    ”\r\n    other parts       ”       29    ”\r\n                             ---\r\n                             100\r\n                             ---\r\n\r\n    Ditto in exports:\r\n      Great Britain   ”       24    ”\r\n      United States   ”       23    ”\r\n      other parts     ”       53    ”\r\n                             ---\r\n                             100\r\n                             ---\r\n\r\nThe percentage of this commerce divided amongst the ports of Brazil, is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    Rio Janeiro, 53 per cent.\r\n    Bahia,       17    ”\r\n    Pernambuco,  13    ”\r\n    Other ports, 17    ”\r\n                ---\r\n                100\r\n                ---\r\n\r\nThe value of imports and exports bearing about a relative proportion to\r\nthese figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE, SUGAR, AND HIDES, EXPORTED FROM RIO JANEIRO, IN 1847, 1848, 1849,\r\n1850, 1851, 1852, 1853.\r\n\r\nThe total number of bags and barrels of coffee exported from Rio Janeiro\r\nin 1847 was 1,650,300; in 1848, 1,706,544; in 1849, 1,451,715; in\r\n1850, 1,392,361; in 1851, 1,993,255; in 1852, 1,899,861; and in 1853,\r\n1,657,520.

The document so published\r\npresents, in a very succinct and comprehensive form, the financial\r\nstatus of the empire; and a further condensation of it, to suit these\r\npages, cannot but be acceptable to such readers as the previous _chevaux\r\nde frize_ of figures may repel from the perusal of what is really most\r\ninteresting fiscal and instructive political facts.\r\n\r\nThe National Debt of Brazil dates from 1824, when the imperial government\r\ncontracted a loan of 1,000,000_l._, 5 per cents, at the price of 75, in\r\norder to defray the expenses of the war of independence. In the following\r\nyear, the government contracted a second loan of 2,000,000_l._, also 5\r\nper cents, at the price of 85, with the further advantage of a year’s\r\ndividend, to provide for the expenses attendant on the suppression of the\r\nrevolt in the northern provinces; and in consideration of the recognition\r\nof Brazilian independence by Portugal, they undertook the liability of\r\nthe loan of 1,500,000_l._ 5 per cents., which the mother country had\r\ncontracted at 87 in 1823. The expenditure was seriously increased by\r\nthe subsequent war with Buenos Ayres, and scarcely was this brought to\r\na conclusion when the government was led into fresh liabilities by the\r\nassistance which Dom Pedro I. gave the constitutional party in Portugal,\r\non the usurpation of the crown of that country by his brother, Dom\r\nMiguel. In 1829, two 5 per cent. loans, 392,584_l._, were contracted\r\nat 54; and the Regency, ten years later, were compelled to contract\r\nanother 5 per cent. loan of 312,512_l._ at 78, in order to meet the\r\ndeficit in the revenue, which then embarrassed the government. During the\r\nusurpations of Dom Miguel, the payment of the dividends on the Portuguese\r\nloan of 1823 was suspended; but as soon as the authority of Donna Maria\r\nwas established, her government provided for the arrears, and in 1842 a\r\nfinancial treaty was concluded between Brazil and Portugal, under which\r\nthe former delivered to the Portuguese agents stock to the amount of\r\n732,600_l._, which at 85, the price at which it was issued, was equal to\r\n622,702_l._, the sum agreed to be paid by Brazil, in liquidation of this\r\nand all other claims.\r\n\r\nThe National Debt of Brazil, therefore, amounted in 1853 to\r\n6,999,200_l._, the interest on which, throughout all the difficulties\r\nand embarrassments of the government, has been punctually paid, though,\r\nat times, the measures necessary to provide for its payment have been\r\nseverely felt by the people. The several loans specified were contracted\r\non the terms of a sinking fund, which were fully carried out until 1828,\r\nwhen the increased expenditure compelled the government to put a period\r\nto its operations. But as soon as the expiration of the commercial treaty\r\nwith England in 1844 allowed the government of Dom Pedro II. to revise\r\nthe tariff of customs duties, and by that means to obviate the pressure\r\nof a deficiency in the revenue, the provisions of the sinking fund were\r\nrevived. The Portuguese loan was thus reduced to 954,250_l._, and in 1852\r\nit was paid off by a new 4½ per cent. loan of that amount, contracted at\r\n95. Reductions of the other loans have been effected in the same way,\r\nand the foreign debt of Brazil now stands at only 5,900,000_l._ Further\r\nreductions are being gradually effected, and if the provisions of the\r\nSinking Fund continue to be carried out, as doubtless they will be, the\r\ntime cannot be far distant when the foreign debt of the empire will be\r\nentirely liquidated.\r\n\r\nBetween 1836 and 1840 the deficiency in the revenue increased from\r\n476,825,000 reis to 3,639,608,000 reis, and in consequence of the\r\nexpenditure consequent on the rebellion in the province of Rio Grande\r\ndo Sul, this deficiency continued to increase until 1844, in which year\r\nit amounted to 9,484,520,000. This deficit did not entirely disappear\r\nduring the next three or four years, but in 1849-50 there was a surplus\r\nof 3,035,006,000 reis (341,438_l._), in 1850-1 of 3,552,404,000 reis\r\n(399,645_l._), in 1851-2 of 4,010,220,000 reis (451,149_l._), in 1852-3\r\nof 3,970,202,000 reis (446,647_l._), and in 1853-4 of 3,528,934,000 reis\r\n(397,005_l._). Since 1836 the revenue has increased from 13,024,749,000\r\nreis to 35,290,691,000 reis, at which sum it may reasonably be estimated\r\nfor some years. The expenditure has increased from 13,501,574,000 reis to\r\n30,471,066,000, which increase has not only been at a slower rate than\r\nthat of the receipts, but exhibits a progression from a deficiency to a\r\nsurplus, and since 1844 it may be taken as representing an improvement\r\nin the administration, the growth of an efficient steam navy, and those\r\nnumerous public works which have been referred to in preceding pages.\r\nThe surplus revenue of the last five years has been the natural result\r\nof the fiscal reforms of 1844, which have extended commerce and promoted\r\ninternal prosperity, at the same time that their success has paved the\r\nway for further and more extensive reforms in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThese accounts refer only to the imperial revenue, in addition to which\r\neach of the twenty provinces into which the empire is divided has its\r\nseparate revenue, raised by its Provincial Assembly, and expended on\r\nlocal objects, the aggregate amount of which is about one-third that of\r\nthe imperial revenue. This system causes the demands on the imperial\r\ntreasury to be much fewer than in countries where the administration\r\nis centralised, and the entire expenditure is defrayed from the\r\ngeneral revenue. The entire debt of Brazil does not much exceed three\r\nyears’ revenue, and while the latter is yearly increasing, the former\r\nexhibits an annual diminution. This proportion between income and\r\nliabilities is such as few states can exhibit, and considering the almost\r\nillimitable resources of the country, and the commercial prosperity\r\nthat is fast growing out of its adoption of a Free Trade policy, a debt\r\nof 12,362,290_l._ cannot be deemed a serious or burdensome charge.\r\nIndeed, when we look at the progress which has been made towards the\r\ndiminution of the debt, in years when the facilities of the government\r\nfor meeting its liabilities were much less than at present, there can be\r\nno doubt that it will in the course of a few more years be extinguished\r\naltogether, and thus enable the government to carry out farther\r\nreductions, and promote many schemes of improvement.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this summary of the commercial and social status of Brazil,\r\nI venture, before making any observations on the Plate, to solicit the\r\nattention of the reader to some very admirable remarks which appeared in\r\nan influential morning journal a few weeks ago, with the signature of\r\n‘Braziliensis,’ explanatory of the precise relationship of the empire\r\nto the Oriental del Uruguay and to the Argentine states generally. A\r\nknowledge of this relationship is essential to an appreciation of what\r\nis called, often erroneously, the ‘River Plate Question;’ and, with the\r\naid of the writer referred to, whose remarks I am about to epitomise,\r\nand a few explanatory addenda incorporated with them, the matter may\r\nbe rendered transparent in a brief compass. First, as to the Uruguay,\r\ntouching which republic Brazil is assumed by ill-informed politicians\r\nin England to have sinister designs. Now, Brazil, of all countries, has\r\nmost interest in the peace and progress of Uruguay as an independent\r\nstate. But it must not be overlooked that Brazil is a Platine state,\r\njust as much as Uruguay, as the Argentine Confederation, as Bolivia, or\r\nParaguay. It is in Brazilian territories that the River Paraguay has its\r\nmain source, that the River Uruguay rises, that the Parana begins to\r\nflow, and that these (with their tributaries) form the River Plate. All\r\nthree are navigable in Brazil; each forms the natural access to great and\r\nrich provinces of that empire, which has, therefore, a deep interest in\r\nthe free navigation of the upper waters of the Plate; and that interest\r\nis the key to her policy on the southern side of the empire. She has a\r\nplethora of land. What she wants is an increase to her free population:\r\nto European immigration all parties are directing earnest attention.\r\nCivilians, not soldiers of fortune, govern Brazil. The Emperor is a\r\ncivilian; his ministers are civilians: there is nothing aggressive or\r\nambitious in Brazilian policy. Law, order, commerce, and peace—not the\r\nsword—prevail. The army is small, not exceeding 65,000 men, of which\r\nthe regular troops number 22,540 officers and privates (including 3,127\r\ncavalry, and 3,582 artillery); the remainder are militia, and the whole\r\nare strictly obedient to the civil power. Like England, Brazil cultivates\r\na naval force, and that never sways the destinies of the state in any\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTo save itself from the unlicensed soldiery of the Spanish provinces—from\r\nthe savage Artigas—Monte Video sought and found admission into the\r\nBrazilian empire, and became its Cis-Platine province. The jealousies of\r\nthe Spanish and Portuguese races (and Buenos Ayrean intrigues) produced\r\nrevolt, and led to war between Brazil and Buenos Ayres for possession\r\nof the Banda. But this war was most unpopular in Brazil. Her native\r\npopulation did not regard the territory as worth fighting for, and the\r\nobstinacy of Dom Pedro I., in persevering against public opinion, was\r\none cause of his downfall. Hostilities terminated by the creation of the\r\nindependent Republic of Uruguay. But Lord Ponsonby’s treaty, by which\r\nit was accomplished, was one of preliminaries only. So little, however,\r\ndid Brazil then care to intrigue in Uruguay, that, notwithstanding her\r\nmaterial interests suffered from the want of definite arrangements, she\r\nwas content, so long as Uruguay preserved the shadow of independence, to\r\ngo on with provisional relations only. But Rosas first attacked and then\r\nsubdued the independence of Uruguay; and then Uruguay became a source of\r\ndanger, for it adjoins Rio Grande do Sul, in which serious disturbances\r\nhad with difficulty been suppressed. These Rosas tried to revive. Its\r\nboundaries, too, were unsettled; and Oribe carried his incursions into\r\nBrazilian territories, levied enormous contributions on Brazilian\r\nsubjects, and carried off 800,000 head of cattle. Nor was this all: the\r\nnavigation of the Uruguay, Parana, and Paraguay was closed to Brazil, and\r\ncommerce down the Plate, Brazil was allowed to have none. Still, whilst\r\nthere was a chance that British and French intervention would remedy\r\nthis state of things, she waited patiently. When those powers not only\r\nretired, but wholly failed, Rosas openly assumed the protectorate of\r\nUruguay, and required Brazil to submit to the depredations of Oribe, his\r\nlieutenant. Brazil expelled the power of Rosas from Uruguay, then drove\r\nhim from Buenos Ayres, but at once withdrew within its own frontiers,\r\nand, in the succeeding troubles, refused to interfere further than to\r\ngive good and the same advice to all. Brazil had then the opportunity\r\nof annexing the Oriental State, and of again advancing her frontier to\r\nthe Plate. In fixing the boundary line she has gained no territory; her\r\npecuniary claims she has postponed until those of other countries are\r\ndischarged; she has insisted on the free navigation of the rivers, not\r\nfor herself only, but for all the countries they water; and when the\r\ngovernment of Monte Video was lately oppressed by poverty, she consented\r\nto lend it 60,000 dols. a month, in order that it might preserve its\r\nindependence. Brazil was no party to the recent change of presidents at\r\nMonte Video; and just as Brazil supported Giro himself when in power, as\r\nthe head of the government _de facto_, so, in the interests of peace and\r\nindependence, she now lends moral support to the present government.[58]\r\nShe takes no part against Urquiza; she is neither his partisan nor that\r\nof Buenos Ayres in Argentine disputes; she has, indeed, tried to throw\r\noil on their troubled waters; but, as that was not to be done, like\r\nEngland and France, Brazil now waits for their natural solution. She\r\nis the only South American state with a stable government, with a large\r\nand increasing commerce, with a growing surplus, with an augmenting\r\npopulation. She has secured the esteem of England by at last abandoning\r\nthe slave trade, and she will not risk either her prosperity or her\r\nreputation by ambitious designs on Uruguay. [See chapter on the River\r\nPlate.] We have seen that she is most favourable to the free navigation\r\nof those rivers on her southern and eastern frontier, whose opening has\r\nso long been the desideratum of European and South American commerce;\r\nand we shall see presently that she is most wisely and energetically\r\ncoöperating with an affluent company, composed of English, Brazilian, and\r\nPortuguese capitalists, for bringing the blessings of steam to bear upon\r\nthe Amazon, the results of which proceeding it is entirely impossible to\r\nexaggerate.\r\n\r\nTen years ago the finances of Brazil were in very great embarrassment.\r\nUnder all circumstances of distress and difficulty, Brazil had, indeed,\r\npaid, as she still continues regularly to pay, the interest on her debt,\r\nthereby honourably distinguishing herself from other South American, and\r\nnot a few European states. But, at that time, her expenditure largely\r\nexceeded her income. Gradually Brazil has reversed this state of things;\r\ninstead of a heavy deficit, she now has a steadily increasing surplus,\r\nhas been able to reduce the rate of interest on part of her foreign debt,\r\nis slowly reducing its capital, and is in a position to compete in the\r\nmoney market of London with the most favoured European governments. Ten\r\nyears ago Brazil was not a little embarrassed by the fiscal restrictions\r\nshe had imposed on herself by her commercial treaties with other\r\ncountries. Now she is free from all such embarrassments, has full powers\r\nover her own trading and financial system, and has no treaties at all\r\nwith other states. Intermediately she raised for revenue purposes her\r\ntariff of Custom duties; but now that she has a surplus to dispose of,\r\nher Government is engaged in reducing those duties, to the enlargement,\r\nof course, of her commerce. The total funded domestic debt of the empire\r\non the 31st of Dec. last amounted to 57,704,200,000 reis, and the funded\r\ndebt of the province of Rio Janeiro to 3,940,000,000 reis. The total\r\nrevenue for the present year, 1854, is estimated at about 32,353,000\r\nmilreis (£3,594,700), and the expenditure at about 29,633,706 milreis\r\n(£3,292,630). The income is chiefly derived from the _ad valorem_ duty\r\ncharged on all articles imported into Brazil, amounting in 1851-2 to\r\n£2,814,443; a low duty charged on the articles exported, amounting in the\r\nsame year to £503,070; and rents, royalties on mines, &c. The estimated\r\nexpenditure for 1853-4 is thus distributed: Ministry of the Interior,\r\n£412,355; Justice, £250,020; Foreign Affairs, £60,000; Marine, £452,138;\r\nWar, £813,935; Finances, £1,304,162: total, £3,292,630.\r\n\r\nTen years ago the Brazilian navy was small: it is now rising into\r\nimportance; its courage and capacity were lately seen in the Plate; many\r\nof its younger officers have been reared in the British service, and from\r\nBritish yards it is yearly adding to its steam flotilla. It now consists\r\nof 1 frigate of 50 guns, 5 corvettes, 5 brigs, and 9 schooners, carrying\r\ntogether 188 guns; and 4 smaller vessels, carrying together 27 guns; 10\r\nsteamers, mounting 36 guns; with various unarmed ships and steamers,\r\nand several others are building. The Brazilian army has established its\r\nreputation at once for success, bravery, and humanity. Ten years ago\r\nBrazil had little external influence; now Brazil is obviously at the head\r\nof South American states, and has a distinct and separate part assigned\r\nto her in the destinies of the human race. Then she had but slow and\r\ndilatory intercourse with Europe; now she has two monthly steam services\r\nfrom England—another is being established from Lisbon; and Rio Janeiro is\r\nnow only a month’s distance from London and Paris.\r\n\r\nWhilst London, Liverpool, and Lisbon are thus sweeping its coasts with\r\nsteam, Manchester is lighting Brazilian cities with gas. Messrs. Peto\r\nand Jackson, (the members for Norwich and Newcastle-under-Lyne,) whose\r\ncapital and connections are interlacing Canada and the British North\r\nAmerican provinces with a magnificent net-work of railways, are also with\r\nother capitalists about to bring their vast resources and long practised\r\nexperience to bear in a like manner in several of the Brazilian\r\nprovinces, and doubtless with a like result within as brief a period as\r\nthe circumstances of the country and the obstacles to be overcome will\r\npossibly permit. The Government is opening up new roads, clearing away\r\nimpediments in rivers, and is arranging the internal improvement of\r\nthe empire on a large and comprehensive system. A great and a happier\r\nfuture is opening on Brazil—one calculated to advance and extend moral\r\nimprovement and political freedom, as well as to promote material comfort.\r\n\r\nIn thus recording the material prosperity and anticipating the\r\nprogressive greatness of this magnificent empire, it affords me\r\ninfinite gratification to be able to attribute to my distinguished\r\nfellow-townsman, Admiral Grenfell, the Brazilian consul-general[59] for\r\nEngland, a large and conspicuous share in consolidating the strength,\r\nand enhancing the reputation of Brazil, as eminent among the nations\r\nalike for the valour of its arms, the clemency of its counsels, and\r\nthe magnanimity it has evinced in eschewing territorial aggrandisement\r\nwhich its bravery and sagacity might so readily have secured it. A more\r\nbefitting preliminary to the subsequent chapter on the Amazon there could\r\nnot be than a memoir of the gallant seaman to whose skill and bravery\r\nthe retention of the principal Amazonian province is due, and to whose\r\nequally admirable conduct on a scarcely less trying occasion is also\r\ndue an acceleration of the settlement of the affairs of the Plate, to\r\na correct understanding of which, in their latter phases at least, a\r\nperusal of the annexed biographical data, gleaned from the most reliable\r\nsources, will greatly contribute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERFALL OF ITAMARITY. DISTANT TWO DAYS’ JOURNEY FROM RIO\r\nJANEIRO.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE ILLUSTRATION.\r\n\r\n    The cataract shown in the foregoing page consists, says Sir W.\r\n    G. Ouseley, from whose portfolio it is copied, of a succession\r\n    of three waterfalls, subsiding into rapids, and then continuing\r\n    its course as a turbulent rocky brook, working its way among\r\n    the hills of the Serra de Estrella. The falls of Itamarity\r\n    are not near any high road, and have been seldom visited by\r\n    Europeans. It is not possible to obtain a general view of all\r\n    the falls. That in the Plate is taken from an insulated rock,\r\n    standing opposite the second fall. The first fall has worked a\r\n    basin in the rock, as in other similar sites, and, as usual,\r\n    it is asserted by the natives to be of vast or fathomless\r\n    depth. Below the isolated rock is a third fall of considerable\r\n    size; but the rich and thick vegetation prevents much of it\r\n    from being seen. On the morning that this sketch was taken,\r\n    when a party visited the Falls, some negroes were sent on\r\n    beforehand to cut away the underwood and parasites, and to fell\r\n    trees in order to _improviser_ a bridge for the nonce. The\r\n    ligatures used in fastening the trees, and the sort of parapet\r\n    railing, were made of the lianes or parasitical plants from\r\n    the surrounding trees. They hang from the highest branches\r\n    like ropes of various sizes, some little larger than whipcord,\r\n    others of the circumference of a large cable; indeed, they are\r\n    often thicker than a man’s body, and frequently form spiral and\r\n    intricate knots, like the writhings of gigantic serpents, à la\r\n    Laocoon. The profuse variety of growth and rapid vegetation in\r\n    this part of Brazil is scarcely credible to Europeans. A very\r\n    few weeks, or rather days, after this path had been opened,\r\n    and the bridge constructed to enable the party to visit these\r\n    Falls, strangers might have passed close to them, only made\r\n    aware of their proximity by the loud roar of the falling\r\n    waters, the hoarse sound of which, deadened and rendered\r\n    deceptive by the close growth of the forest, would be but an\r\n    indifferent guide, and hardly enable them to find any approach\r\n    by which to obtain a view of the Falls. The negroes and country\r\n    people have alarming stories or traditions respecting vast\r\n    crocodiles, differing from the common sort in their nature\r\n    and habits, and unlike the alligators of the rivers emptying\r\n    themselves directly into the bay of Rio de Janeiro, at the\r\n    foot of these mountains. They are said to be infinitely larger\r\n    and more voracious than their relations near the salt water.\r\n    These monsters, they affirm, inhabit the deep pools formed\r\n    occasionally in the course of the mountain rivers. Poisonous\r\n    snakes are asserted to be often found in these waters. The\r\n    present existence of these crocodiles seems very apocryphal;\r\n    nor are serpents so often met with, even by naturalists anxious\r\n    to enrich their collections, as is generally supposed. The\r\n    name of these Falls, ‘Itamariti,’ or ‘Itamarity,’ signifies in\r\n    the Indian language (probably that of the Guarani tribe) ‘the\r\n    shining stones,’ or ‘the rock that shines,’ doubtless so called\r\n    from the glittering appearance of the large mass of rock, the\r\n    face of which is worn smooth by the water. ‘Ita’ means stone or\r\n    rock.\r\n\r\n    The old road over the Serra de Estrella, constructed when\r\n    Brazil was a colony of Portugal, was, although much too steep\r\n    according to modern ideas of engineering, infinitely better\r\n    than the track dignified with the name of road, formerly\r\n    leading to the Serra dos Orgaos. Being paved, it was at least\r\n    safe and practicable. But the road recently opened to these\r\n    heights is on vastly improved principles, and on a scale\r\n    thought even unnecessarily large. The foundation and progress,\r\n    however, of the new city of Petropolis, situated at the height\r\n    of about 3,000 feet above the level of the sea, on this route,\r\n    has doubtless called for the construction of a road wider and\r\n    more convenient than those hitherto made in this part of the\r\n    country. The Emperor has built a summer residence here, near\r\n    the highest part of the road, and the court and many of the\r\n    wealthier citizens of Rio Janeiro have followed the example,\r\n    encouraged by his Imperial Majesty’s liberal allotment of land\r\n    for dwelling-houses, hotels, &c. The idea of founding this\r\n    mountain city as a retreat during the great heats originated\r\n    with the late Emperor, Don Pedro I., who made grants of land,\r\n    absolutely or conditionally, to different noblemen of his\r\n    Court. He was not enabled, however, to carry into effect either\r\n    his plan for a city, or the construction of a new road to and\r\n    through the mountains. To the reigning Emperor belongs the\r\n    credit of practically calling into existence this thriving and\r\n    healthy settlement, of which the success is now beyond a doubt.\r\n    Petropolis may now be regarded as like the Royal Sitios in\r\n    Spain,—Aranjuez, La Granja, &c., to which the Court regularly\r\n    removes at certain seasons. The temperature and climate are\r\n    delightful, and the annual removal to this and the other Serras\r\n    is sufficient to restore to health those who have suffered\r\n    from the enervating heats of the summer in the low lands\r\n    around the capital. European invalids especially derive great\r\n    benefit during convalescence from a few weeks’ stay in these\r\n    picturesque mountains. Many foreigners, particularly Germans,\r\n    have settled at or near this city. To the naturalist, and\r\n    more particularly to the entomologist and botanist, a sojourn\r\n    in these Serras affords endless interest and employment. A\r\n    railroad is now opened from Rio Janeiro to the foot of the\r\n    hills, which promises great advantages to the new settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL GRENFELL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL GRENFELL, CONSUL GENERAL FOR BRAZIL]\r\n\r\n\r\nVice-Admiral John Pascol Grenfell, of the Imperial Brazilian Navy, is\r\nson of the late Mr. J. Granville Grenfell, of the city of London, and\r\nwas born at Battersea, in 1800. At eleven years of age, he embarked in\r\nthe maritime service of the Honourable East India Company, and made\r\nseveral voyages to India in the capacity of midshipman and mate in the\r\nCompany’s ships. In the year 1819, he left the Company’s service, and\r\njoined the naval service of the Republic of Chili, with the rank of\r\nlieutenant, under the command of the present Admiral Earl of Dundonald,\r\nthen Lord Cochrane, Admiral of the Chilian Naval Forces, engaged in\r\nthe contest with Spain for the independence of the Spanish colonies on\r\nthe coast of the Pacific Ocean. On the night of the 5th of Nov., 1820,\r\nLieutenant Grenfell commanded one of the boats of the Chilian squadron,\r\nwhich, under the personal direction of Lord Cochrane, boarded and cut\r\nout from under the Castles of Callao de Lima, and from the midst of a\r\nsquadron of armed vessels and gunboats, the Spanish Admiral’s ship, the\r\nEsmeralda, a frigate of 40 guns, fully manned, and perfectly prepared for\r\nthe attack. This gallant exploit was performed by 240 volunteers, chiefly\r\nEnglishmen, embarked in 14 boats, five of which were gigs. About 50 of\r\nthe assailants fell killed or wounded in the attack, amongst the latter\r\nLieutenant Grenfell; and 200 Spaniards, stretched on the decks of the\r\nfrigate next morning, showed how sharply the contest had been maintained.\r\nThe following order, issued by Lord Cochrane previous to the attack, will\r\nbe interesting to naval men:—\r\n\r\n    _On Board the Chilian States’ Ship O’Higgins, Nov. 1.,\r\n    1820.—First Division: O’Higgins—1st launch, 2nd launch, barge,\r\n    cutter, green gig, black gig, small gig. Second Division:\r\n    Lautaro and Independencia—1st launch, 2nd launch, barge,\r\n    cutter, cutter, gig, gig. The boats will proceed, towing the\r\n    launches in two lines, parallel to each other, which lines\r\n    are to be at the distance of three boats’ lengths asunder.\r\n    The first line will be under the charge of Capt. Crosbie, the\r\n    second under the charge of Capt. Guise; each boat will be under\r\n    the charge of a volunteer commissioned officer, so far as\r\n    circumstances will permit, and the whole under the command of\r\n    the Admiral. The officers and men are to be dressed in white\r\n    jackets, frocks or skirts, and are to be armed with pistols,\r\n    sabres, knives, tomahawks or pikes. Two boat-keepers are to be\r\n    appointed to each boat, who, on no pretence, shall quit their\r\n    respective boats, but are to remain therein, and take care that\r\n    the boats do not get adrift. Each boat is to be provided with\r\n    one or more axes, or sharp hatchets, which are to be kept slung\r\n    to the girdles of the boat keepers. The frigate Esmeralda being\r\n    the chief object of the expedition, the whole force is first to\r\n    attack that ship, which, when carried, is not to be cut adrift,\r\n    but is to remain in possession of the Patriot Seamen to ensure\r\n    the capture of the rest. On securing the frigate, the Chilian\r\n    seamen and marines are not to cheer, as if they were Chilians,\r\n    but in order to deceive the enemy, and give time for completing\r\n    the work, are to cheer, ‘Viva el Rey.’ The two brigs of war are\r\n    to be fired on by musketry from the Esmeralda, and are to be\r\n    taken possession of by Lieutenants Esmond and Morgell, in the\r\n    boats they command, which being done they are to cut adrift,\r\n    and run out into the offing as soon as possible. The boats of\r\n    the Independencia are to busy themselves in turning adrift all\r\n    the outward Spanish merchantmen; and the boats of the Lautaro,\r\n    under Lieutenants Bell and Roberton, are to set fire to one or\r\n    more of the headmost hulks; but these are not to be cut adrift,\r\n    so as to fall down on the rest. The watchword, (or parole\r\n    and countersign,) should the white dress not be sufficient\r\n    distinction in the dark, is, ‘Gloria,’ to be answered by\r\n    ‘Victoria.’—Signed, COCHRANE._\r\n\r\nNOTE.—After the first attempt on the night of the 4th of Nov., it was\r\nfound inconvenient to tow the launches; and, on the night of the 5th,\r\norders were given by the Admiral, on shoving-off from his flagship, for\r\nthe boats to pull in two lines, and for all officers to report themselves\r\nto him on the quarter-deck of the enemy’s frigate.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Grenfell continued to serve with Lord Cochrane till, by the\r\nsurrender of the remainder of the Spanish naval forces, the war in the\r\nPacific was concluded; and in the beginning of 1823 he left Chili, and\r\naccompanied Lord Cochrane to Brazil, whose newly emancipated government\r\nsolicited the aid of that distinguished nobleman to expel the Portuguese\r\nforces from its territory and shores. This was effected by Lord Cochrane\r\nat the head of the Brazilian squadron, by a series of able manœuvres on\r\nthe coast of Brazil, extending from Bahia to Pará, during the latter part\r\nof 1823, when upwards of one hundred of the enemy’s vessels, and three\r\nthousand troops, were sent prisoners into the Brazilian ports; and the\r\nPortuguese squadron, of superior force to the Brazilian, was driven with\r\nloss and in confusion across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Grenfell, now promoted to the rank of commander, had the\r\ngood fortune of terminating the naval campaign, by effecting alone, in\r\na captured brig of war, manned from the flagship, the surrender of the\r\nPortuguese force in the city of Pará, and the adhesion of that immense\r\nand rich province to the cause of the empire, and rejoined his admiral\r\nat Rio de Janeiro in 1824, in a new frigate of 50 guns, which he found\r\nin the Port of Pará. In the execution of this service, while quelling\r\nan insurrection of the newly subjugated Portuguese, Commander Grenfell\r\nreceived a dangerous wound with a poignard in the back. For these\r\nservices, Commander Grenfell was subsequently made an officer of the\r\nOrder of the Southern Cross.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgment of the independence of Brazil by Portugal the\r\nfollowing year terminated the services of Lord Cochrane, who retired to\r\nEngland. At this period the aggressions of the Argentine Confederation on\r\nthe Southern frontier of Brazil called the naval forces of the empire to\r\nthe River Plate, where Captain Grenfell, now promoted to the post rank,\r\nproceeded in command of a brig of 18 guns, under the Brazilian Admiral,\r\nBaron do Rio da Prata.\r\n\r\nThe naval forces of Buenos Ayres, very inferior to those of Brazil, were\r\ncommanded by Admiral William Brown, an Irishman,—one of those singular\r\ncharacters whose indomitable bravery, converting weakness into strength,\r\nfor a long time baffled all the efforts of the Brazilian Admiral. A\r\ndecisive action at last occurred off Buenos Ayres, in July 1826, in which\r\nAdmiral Brown’s ship, with two-thirds of her men killed and wounded, was\r\ndriven ashore a complete wreck, in front of that city. On this occasion\r\nCaptain Grenfell, whilst in close action with Admiral Brown, and\r\nattacked by a fresh ship of the enemy, had his right arm shattered by a\r\ngrape-shot as he stood on the hammock-nettings of his brig, encouraging\r\nhis men to do their duty. Captain Grenfell’s wound was very severe,\r\nrequiring amputation of the right arm, at the shoulder-joint, which\r\nwas performed three weeks afterwards at Monte Video. On his partial\r\nrecovery, he came on leave to England, but returned to the River Plate\r\nagain in 1828, in command of a corvette, just in time to witness the\r\ntermination of the war. For his services therein, Captain Grenfell was\r\nmade a Dignitary of the Order of the Southern Cross, received a pension\r\nfor the loss of his arm, and other marks of friendship and consideration\r\nfrom H.I.M. Don Pedro I. In 1829, Captain Grenfell married Donna Maria\r\nDolores, second daughter of the late Don Antonio Masini, of the city of\r\nMonte Video, by whom he has had a family of six sons and four daughters.\r\nIn the same year, he was appointed one of the escort of H.I.M. the\r\nEmpress Amelia and H.M. the late Queen of Portugal, Donna Maria II., in\r\ntheir voyage from Europe to Brazil; and afterwards, in the year 1830, he\r\nconveyed the Duchess of Goyaz, a natural daughter of Don Pedro I., from\r\nBrazil to Europe, in the Isabel, a frigate of 60 guns.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Revolution of 1831, and the abdication of Don\r\nPedro I., Captain Grenfell was absent from Brazil, but was recalled\r\nagain to employment by the Regency in 1835. In 1835, he was sent to\r\nthe province of Rio Grande de Sul, in command of the naval force on\r\nthe lakes of that province, then in rebellion against the Imperial\r\nGovernment. Success at first attended the Imperial arms; the rebels in\r\nvarious encounters were driven from their positions on the lakes and\r\nrivers; their flotilla captured, and their principal chiefs, with all\r\ntheir artillery, a considerable force of infantry and cavalry, reduced\r\nto surrender on the River Jacuhy, in a fruitless attempt to force its\r\npassage. In all these operations, the naval force under Captain Grenfell\r\nhad a principal share, for which services, in 1833, he was promoted to\r\nthe rank of commodore. The scene, however, soon changed: the loyal forces\r\npenetrating into the interior were, in 1837, completely routed by the\r\nrebels at Rio Pardo, and Casapava, the president of the province, taken\r\nprisoner, and the Imperial authority again restricted to the capital, the\r\nport, and the lakes; and both the former were closely besieged, and in\r\ngreat danger of falling into the hands of the rebels. At this critical\r\njuncture, the Commodore, through his personal influence with the rebels,\r\noriginating simply from the humanity with which he had treated the\r\nprisoners that on various occasions had fallen into his hands, effected\r\nat great personal risk a suspension of arms with the rebel chiefs, with\r\nreference to the Imperial Government at Rio de Janeiro, which gained\r\nimportant time, checked the rebel career of success, and saved the\r\nprovince to the empire.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government profited by the opportunity afforded for\r\nremedying past errors: troops were poured into the province, a new army\r\nwas organized, the naval forces were augmented with several steamers,\r\nand, at length, in 1842, under the able direction of General the Count\r\nof Caxias, the army took the field, routed the rebels in various\r\nengagements, and finally, in 1844, effected their complete submission to\r\nthe Imperial Government. In attention (as expressed in his commission)\r\nto the distinguished services rendered with so much intelligence, zeal,\r\nand activity in the Province of Rio Grande de San Pedro de Sul, towards\r\nthe pacification of the same province and integrity of the empire, the\r\nCommodore was raised to the rank of Rear-Admiral, and made a Grand\r\nDignitary of the Imperial Order of the Rose; and shortly afterwards\r\nreceived the permission of Her Britannic Majesty to hold his rank, and\r\ncontinue in the service of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Brazil.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1844, Rear-Admiral Grenfell was appointed to command the\r\nImperial squadron in the River Plate, where the contest between Buenos\r\nAyres and Monte Video, affecting the commercial interests of neutral\r\nstates, called the naval forces of most of the maritime powers to the\r\nspot, where he supported with firmness the rights of Brazilian subjects.\r\nThe following year the Rear Admiral received the most marked proof of\r\nthe estimation of the Imperial Government, in being appointed to command\r\nthe squadron that carried their Imperial Majesties to the southern\r\nprovinces of the empire, and hoisted his flag in the frigate Constitution\r\nof 50 guns. With the Imperial squadron, were incorporated Her Britannic\r\nMajesty’s ship Grecian, Her Most Faithful Majesty’s ship Don John, and\r\nthe United States’ ship Raritan. The Rear Admiral had the honour of\r\naccompanying their Imperial Majesties during their tour, and in the\r\ncourse thereof received many notable proofs of the estimation and regard\r\nof the inhabitants of those provinces, who took this opportunity of\r\nshewing their grateful sense of his conduct during the civil war. Shortly\r\nafter the return of the court to Rio Janeiro the Rear Admiral proceeded\r\nin the Constitution to England, with his family, and resigning his naval\r\ncommand at Plymouth, in Sept. 1846, assumed his civil appointment of\r\nConsul General of Brazil, in the United Kingdom. In the spring following,\r\nhe was presented at St. James’s. During the years 1847-48, he built and\r\nfitted out at Liverpool, for the Imperial Government, the steam frigate\r\n‘Alfonso.’\r\n\r\nIn August, 1848, Rear Admiral Grenfell received the thanks of the town\r\nof Liverpool, and the gold medal of the Liverpool Seamens Shipwreck\r\nSociety, for his exertions in saving the lives of the passengers and crew\r\nof the emigrant ship Ocean Monarch,[60] burnt off that port, and which\r\nwas promptly succoured by the Alfonso under Captain Marques Lisboa, then\r\non her trial trip. The following letter from H.R. Highness the Prince de\r\nJoinville, who was present, shews the sense H.R. Highness entertained of\r\nthe Rear-Admiral’s behaviour on that trying occasion.\r\n\r\n    _Claremont, 28 Aôut, 1848.—Monsieur,—J’ai reçu la lettre que\r\n    vous m’avez fait l’honneur de m’écrire au sujet du sauvetage\r\n    des passagers de l’Ocean Monarch. Je ne mérite point les\r\n    éloges que vous voulez bien m’addresser. Passager seulement\r\n    abord de l’Alfonzo je n’ai été malheureusement que le témoin\r\n    impuissant de la plus douloureuse des catastrophes, mais j’ai\r\n    vu tenter les plus noble efforts d’arracher à une mort horrible\r\n    des femmes et des enfans. Qu’il me soit permis de signaler\r\n    à la reconnaissance publique les Officiers et l’equipage de\r\n    l’Alfonzo, le matelot Jerome, et surtout Monsieur l’Admiral\r\n    Grenfell, dont le noble devouement m’a pénétré d’admiration. Ma\r\n    femme me charge de vous exprimer toute sa reconnaissance pour\r\n    les sentimens que vous avez bien voulu lui exprimer. Recevez,\r\n    Monsieur, l’assurance de ma haute considération.—(Signé) F.\r\n    d’Orleans.—His Worship the Mayor of Liverpool._\r\n\r\nThe serious misunderstanding which occurred in 1850 between the\r\ngovernments of Brazil and Buenos Ayres, on the subject of the occupation\r\nof the territory of Monte Video by the latter power, induced the Imperial\r\nGovernment to augment its forces by sea and by land; and Rear-Admiral\r\nGrenfell was selected to command the squadron in the River Plate; and,\r\nleaving England in the beginning of 1851, he hoisted his flag at Rio\r\nJaneiro again on board the frigate Constitution, and proceeded with\r\nseveral corvettes and steamers to his destination. The Buenos Ayrean\r\narmy, under General Oribe, was found cantonned round the city of Monte\r\nVideo: the Buenos Ayrean flotilla, under Commodore Coe, lay in the inner\r\nroads of Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nThe Rear-Admiral, after concerting measures with the Governor of Entre\r\nRios, General Don Justo Urquiza and the Count of Caxias, who again\r\nwas at the head of the Brazilian army on the frontier of Monte Video,\r\nproceeded to occupy the rivers Uruguay and Parana, so as to impede the\r\ncommunication of General Oribe with Buenos Ayres. This measure entirely\r\ndisconcerted the plans of the Governor of Buenos Ayres, Don Juan Manuel\r\nRosas, who, not confiding in his own resources, counted on the assistance\r\nof Great Britain and France. These powers, however, preserved their\r\nneutrality, and in November the simultaneous advance of the forces of\r\nEntre Rios and Brazil, together with the position maintained by the\r\nBrazilian squadron, compelled General Oribe to surrender himself and his\r\narmy to terms dictated by General Urquiza. Monte Video, thus freed from\r\nits enemies, the Argentine troops lost to General Rosas, and incorporated\r\nwith the allies, nothing remained but to cross the river, and march\r\non Buenos Ayres, where General Rosas was doing his utmost to levy and\r\norganize a new army. The vanguard of this army, under General Mansilla,\r\noccupied a position on the River Parana, at the Pass of Tonelero,\r\nwhich was fortified and armed with 16 pieces of cannon, provided with\r\nfurnaces for hot shot. This passage was forced on the 17th Dec, by the\r\nRear-Admiral, at the head of a division of steamers and corvettes, with\r\ntrifling loss; and on the following days the allied army, 24,000 strong,\r\nunder General Urquiza, crossed the Parana, and marched on Buenos Ayres.\r\nThe battle of Monte Caseros, on the 3rd of February, 1852, the flight\r\nof General Rosas, and the conclusion of a treaty between Brazil, Buenos\r\nAyres, Monte Video, and Paraguay, guaranteeing their respective rights,\r\nand opening the navigation of the Rivers Parana, Uruguay, and Paraguay,\r\nput an end to this short and glorious campaign. Rewards and promotion\r\nwere liberally bestowed by the Brazilian Government on the victors. The\r\nCount of Caxias was made a Marquis; the Imperial Plenipotentiary Honorio\r\nCarnero Leon was created Viscount Parana, and Rear-Admiral Grenfell was\r\nmade a Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Rose, and promoted to the\r\nrank of Vice-Admiral. In August, 1852, he resigned his command of the\r\nimperial squadron, and returned to his civil appointment in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGION OF THE AMAZON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Westward the course of empire takes its way,\r\n      The four first acts already past;\r\n    A fifth shall close the drama with the day:\r\n      Time’s noblest offspring is the last.\r\n\r\nEach year we open upon new prospects in an increasing ratio, and among\r\nthose which now present themselves as calculated to develope fresh fields\r\nfor adventure and for an extension of traffic, are the navigation, just\r\nconsummated, of 1,200 miles of the River Murray, and the expedition that\r\nis commencing to explore the Amazon.—_Times’ Commercial Retrospect of\r\n1853._\r\n\r\n    Wide o’er his isles the branching Orinoque\r\n    Rolls a brown deluge; and the native drives\r\n    To dwell aloft on life-sufficing trees;\r\n    At once his dome, his robe, his food, and arms.\r\n    Swell’d by a thousand streams, impetuous hurl’d\r\n    From all the roaring Andes, huge descends\r\n    The mighty Orellana.—THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE AMAZON.\r\n\r\n    Sources of the Marañon.—Rapids and cataracts.—Embouchures\r\n    of the Amazon.—Its volume, compared with the Ganges and\r\n    the Brahmapootra.—Its discovery by Pinzon.—Expedition of\r\n    Orellana.—Gold-seeking expedition of Pedro de Orsua.—Settlement\r\n    of Pará, and discovery of the Rio Negro.—The Missions of the\r\n    Jesuits, and their expulsion.—Discovery of the communication\r\n    between the Amazon and the Orinoco.—Revolution of 1835.—Pará:\r\n    its streets and public buildings.—Explorations of M.

In conversing with enlightened inhabitants of Brazil,\r\nnatives of the capital or elsewhere, on the vastness and fertility of\r\ntheir country, and on the magnificent destiny it is certain to attain,\r\nthey concur with you, as a matter of course, but conclude with an\r\nintimation that you estimate but half of the reality, and a fourth of the\r\nprobability of what is in store; for you leave out of your calculation\r\nthe wondrous but almost unknown district of the Amazon. _There_,\r\nindeed, they imply, are the germs of marvellous and unmatched natural\r\ngreatness to be sought; for, prodigal as nature has everywhere been to\r\nthe country in every possible respect, it is there that she has been\r\nmost profuse; and there are her bounties most accessible to man, if he\r\nwould only make the slightest exertion to secure them. These views are\r\nentertained in a like degree by many of the most intelligent citizens of\r\nthe United States, the attention of which country is being drawn in an\r\nincreasingly marked degree to the commercial capabilities of the Amazon;\r\nand the frequency of the publications respecting it, and the wide and\r\ngeneral circulation they obtain throughout the Union, attest the interest\r\nwherewith North America regards the locale of what one of their writers\r\ndescribes as the future inevitably greatest mercantile entrepot (Pará)\r\nin the world. With what justice this anticipation is formed it is the\r\ndesign of the annexed few pages to exhibit, consisting, as they do, in\r\na great degree, of a digest of the more influential of the publications\r\nalluded to. Considering the magnitude of the existing relations between\r\nEngland and Brazil, and how large a share Great Britain will derive from\r\nthe enterprises that are now being directed to the opening up of the\r\nAmazon, it is conceived that a summary of the most recent circumstances\r\nconnected with the countries and peoples bordering on that mighty stream\r\nwill not fail to be acceptable, the more so as, with the exception of Mr.\r\nWallace’s volume already alluded to, and which is not a commercial, nor\r\nyet geographical, nor descriptive work, there has been in this country no\r\nrecent publication of an analogous nature to those of the United States’\r\nwriters we shall presently enumerate.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon, the largest river in the world, traverses the tropical\r\nregions of South America from west to east, discharging its immense\r\nvolume of water into the Atlantic, nearly under the equator. The\r\nTanguragua, or Upper Marañon, is regarded as its principal head-stream,\r\nand rises in the Lake of Llanricocha, 14,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, in the region of nearly perpetual snow. For about 120 miles from its\r\nsource it flows through a ravine, and is full of rapids and cataracts,\r\nhaving a fall in that distance of more than 11,000 feet. Near Huary the\r\nravine opens into a wide valley, through which the river flows gently\r\nfor about 380 miles, and is navigable for canoes. Its course is then\r\ninterrupted by the rapids of the Pongo Rentema, and turns eastward, in\r\nwhich direction it runs nearly 180 miles, leaving the mountain region by\r\nthe Pongo de Manseriche, a rapid seven miles long. In this part of its\r\ncourse the current is so strong that it can be descended only by floats;\r\nbut from the rapids of Manseriche the river passes through an extensive\r\nplain, its entire length exceeding 3,000 miles.\r\n\r\nA great number of tributaries pour their waters into the Amazon in\r\nthe lower part of its course. On the north side the first from the\r\nwest, below the rapids of Manseriche, is the Morona, and then come in\r\nsuccession the Pastaça, Tigre, Napo, Iça, Yapurà, Rio Negro, and Oximina.\r\nFrom the south it receives, proceeding from west to east, the Huallaga,\r\nUcayali, Yavari, Jutai, Jurua, Teffé, Coavy, Purus, Madera, Tapajos,\r\nXingù, and Tocantins. Most of these affluents discharge their waters into\r\nthe Amazon by more than one mouth, which frequently are widely apart.\r\nThus the two most distant of the four mouths of the Yapurà are more than\r\n200 miles asunder, and the outer embouchures of the Purus are about 100\r\nmiles from each other. In the upper portion of its course the Amazon\r\ndivides Equador from Peru, between which its width varies from half a\r\nmile to a mile; beyond the limits of Equador it increases to two miles,\r\nand below the Madera (its most considerable tributary, having a course\r\nlittle less than 2,000 miles in length) it is nearly three miles. Between\r\nFaro and Obydos, to which place the tide reaches, it decreases to less\r\nthan a mile; but below Obydos it widens again, and after the junction of\r\nthe Tapajos it is nearly seven miles across. The width of the channel\r\nof Braganza do Norte, the northern mouth of this vast river, is 30\r\nmiles opposite the island Marajó, and 50 at its embouchure; that of the\r\nTangipurà channel is 18 miles at the junction of the Tocantins, and 30 at\r\nits mouth. One of the most remarkable characteristics of the Amazon is\r\nthe immense volume of water which it discharges into the ocean, which is\r\nascribable to the forests which cover so large an extent of the immense\r\nregion which it flows through, and attract a much greater quantity of\r\nrain than the scorched _Llanos_ of the Orinoco, and the treeless _pampas_\r\nof the Rio Plata. While the principal branch of the Ganges discharges\r\n80,000 cubic feet of water per second, and the Brahmapootra pours forth\r\n176,188 cubic feet per second, the volume of water which flows through\r\nthe Narrow of Obydos per second is calculated at 550,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the Madera among the tributaries of the Amazon, is\r\nthe Rio Negro, which, after a course of 1400 miles, falls into the Father\r\nof Waters twelve miles below the town of Barra, where it is a mile and\r\na half wide. The Xingù has a course of 1000 miles, the Tapajos and the\r\nYapurà each 900 miles, and the Napo and Iça each of 700.[61]\r\n\r\nAccording to the best writers, the first expedition up the Amazon\r\noccurred in 1500, when a Portuguese named Pinzon discovered the mouth\r\nof the river, and took possession of its left bank. In 1540, Francisco\r\nOrellana descended the Napo and the Amazon to its mouth, and finding\r\nthe native women in arms to oppose him, gave the name of Amazonia to\r\nthe country, and conferred his own upon the river, by which it is still\r\ncalled by some geographers. In 1560, Pedro de Orsua, commissioned to\r\nexplore the country in search of gold, descended the Jutai and Jurua, but\r\nwas prevented by a mutiny from proceeding farther. In 1615 the governor\r\nof Maranham, Alexandro de Moura, in order to establish the sovereignty\r\nof Portugal, sent an expedition to the Amazon under Francisco Caldeira,\r\nwho sailed up the Tocantins, and formed a settlement where Pará now\r\nstands. In 1648 a party of Portuguese discovered the Rio Negro, and\r\nreached Quito overland, which was regarded as a remarkable feat. Shortly\r\nafterwards, the Jesuits commenced their settlements on the banks of the\r\nMarañon; and during the reign of Philip III., when Portugal was united\r\nto Spain, it was seriously contemplated to make the Amazon the means of\r\ntransit for the treasures of Peru and Chili, by which the sea-voyage\r\nwould be much shortened, and the dangers from English and French cruisers\r\nmore than proportionately lessened.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits warmly espoused the cause of the cruelly treated Indians,\r\nbut, unfortunately, their zeal outran their discretion, and, in 1604,\r\nthey were expelled. Several settlements were made about this time on the\r\nMarañon and the Rio Negro, among others that of San José, now the town\r\nof Barra; and in the expeditions which took place between 1726 and 1730,\r\nthe communication between the Rio Negro and the Orinoco was discovered.\r\nDuring the next twenty or thirty years, colonization appears to have made\r\nrapid strides, so much so that, in 1784, a commission was despatched\r\nfrom Portugal to explore the country for botanical and other scientific\r\nobjects. Settlements continued to be formed, but no event worthy of\r\nrecord occurred until the change of dynasty in 1823. Since then the only\r\noccurrence of consequence has been the revolution of 1835, when the\r\npresident of the province was assassinated, the citizens of Pará fled,\r\nand the whole of the province, with the exception of the town of Cametá,\r\non the Tocantins, fell under the power of the insurgents, who sacked the\r\ntowns, and carried off the slaves and the cattle. Quarrels between the\r\ninsurgent leaders increased the miseries of the country, and several\r\npresidents succeeded each other. At length, (see memoir of Admiral\r\nGrenfell), President Andrea arrived from Rio Janeiro with a sufficient\r\nforce, and succeeded in recovering possession of Pará. The inland places\r\ngradually returned to their allegiance, and though the effects of these\r\ndisturbances are still felt in some districts, Pará has fully recovered\r\nits former prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe province of Pará, though naturally the richest portion of the\r\nimmense empire of Brazil, of which it is the most northern part, is\r\nlittle known, and at present of but little commercial importance.[62]\r\nPará, the capital, contains about 15,000 inhabitants, and has a pretty\r\nappearance from the river. Most of the houses are white, which, against\r\nthe dark green of the forest that surrounds it on the land side, and with\r\nthe clear blue sky above, give it a pleasing aspect. The small islands\r\nin the river are wooded to the water’s edge, and canoes are constantly\r\npassing, paddled by negroes or Indians. The custom-house, formerly a\r\nconvent, is a large and handsome building, and there are several churches\r\nthat will bear comparison with those of Europe. The squares are more\r\nlike village greens, being covered with a rank growth of weeds, but\r\nthe graceful-looking palms which are planted in their midst impart a\r\npicturesque appearance in the eyes of a stranger. The principal street\r\nis the Rua dos Mercadores (street of merchants), which contains the only\r\ngood shops in the town, and this, or rather a part of it, is the only\r\nportion that is paved. The other streets are very narrow, and some not\r\nfree from holes.\r\n\r\nWhat most strikes the observer is the number and size of the public\r\nbuildings of Pará, which are far beyond the present wants of the place,\r\nbut form a good foundation for its future requirements as the great depôt\r\nof the Amazon. The palace is large and massive, but has no pretensions\r\nto architectural beauty. In its rear is the theatre, unfinished, and\r\novergrown with vines and climbing shrubs. Near these buildings is the\r\ncathedral, the largest in Brazil, the bells of whose two steeples, with\r\nthose of the numerous churches, seem to be continually ringing. Near the\r\narsenal, and sufficiently removed from the city to be no nuisance to the\r\ninhabitants, is the public slaughter-house, in the neighbourhood of which\r\nmany vultures are always to be seen.\r\n\r\nMost of the towns and villages of the extensive country watered by the\r\nAmazon, are situated on that river and its tributaries; and the rest is\r\nan impenetrable forest, trodden only by the Indian and the jaguar. Very\r\nlittle is known of the greater portion of the interior, but M. Castlenau,\r\nwho explored the valley of the Amazon in 1843, and Lieutenant Herndon,\r\nof the United States Navy, who descended the ‘King of Rivers’ in 1852,\r\nhave supplied considerable information respecting the Tocantins, the\r\nMadera, and Huallaga. The first-named flows through a fertile and healthy\r\ncountry, and has many flourishing settlements on its banks. Among them\r\nis Salinas, famous for its salt works, near which is the Lake of Pearls,\r\nsurrounded by beautiful scenery, and inhabited by numbers of aquatic\r\nbirds. The town of Goyaz, with a population of about 7,500, is situated\r\non the Vermelho, a branch of the Tocantins, and can be reached by vessels\r\nfrom Pará. The voyage occupies five months, the up freight being about\r\n20s., and the down one fourth, per 100 lbs. Large canoes are paddled up\r\nthe river as far as Porto Imperial, and take down hides, which at Goyaz\r\nare worth fifty cents, and at Pará are sold for a dollar and a half. Pará\r\nalso trades with the inland town of Diamantino, by means of the Tapajos,\r\nthe voyage up and down occupying eight months. The foreign merchandise\r\nthat reaches Diamantino by this route is sold at an advance, on the\r\naverage, of 850 per cent. on its price at Pará, which is from 50 to 100\r\nper cent. on New York prices. When steam-boats are introduced on these\r\nwaters trade will be largely increased, and prices reduced by competition\r\nand the facility of transit, so that both producer and consumer will be\r\ngreatly benefitted.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter which gives a promising aspect to the question of future\r\ncommercial intercourse with the interior that the elements of a large\r\nand profitable trade already exist in abundance. Cinchona to the value\r\nof two millions of dollars is annually exported from the eastern slopes\r\nof Bolivia, but, at present, for the want of steam-boats on the Amazon\r\nand its tributaries, it is carried over the Andes on the backs of llamas\r\nand mules to the ports of Peru. Large quantities of wool, clipped on\r\nthe banks of the Bolivian tributaries of the Amazon, instead of going\r\ndown the river to Pará, for shipment to England or the United States,\r\nare carried over the Andes in the same manner, and have then to make the\r\nvoyage round Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nThe Madera runs through a beautiful valley, clothed with verdure, and\r\nabounding in scenery the most striking and picturesque. It is among\r\nthe upper tributaries of this river that the traditions of the country\r\nplace the lost mines of Urucumaguam, the riches of which equalled those\r\nof Potosi. When Lieutenant Gibbon, who was sent by the United States\r\ngovernment to explore the valley of the Madera, was at Cochabamba, the\r\nattention of the Bolivian government was called to the establishment,\r\non the navigable waters of that river, of ports of entry to foreign\r\ncommerce, and of steam communication with the Amazon. Belzu, the\r\nPresident of Bolivia, received him in the most gracious manner, and is\r\nsaid to have promised to grant privileges to a company for that purpose,\r\nif application were made to him in due form. The course of the Madera\r\nis interrupted by cataracts and rapids, but the former only commence\r\n450 miles from its mouth, and the latter may be passed by canoes. The\r\ncataracts passed, the river is navigable into the heart of Bolivia by its\r\ntributaries, the Beni and the Mamoré, and quite through the Brazilian\r\nprovince of Matto Grosso by the Guaporé. Mr. Clay, the United States\r\nchargé d’affaires at Lima, was told that a Brazilian war-schooner had\r\nascended the Madera above the rapids as far as Exaltacion, which is in\r\nBolivia, above the junction of the Beni.\r\n\r\nAbout one-half of Bolivia, two-thirds of Peru, three-fourths of\r\nEquador, and one-half of New Grenada are drained by the Amazon and its\r\ntributaries. For the want of steam communication, the trade of all these\r\nparts of those countries goes west over the Andes to Callao. There it is\r\nshipped, and after doubling Cape Horn, and sailing eight or ten thousand\r\nmiles, it is then only off the mouth of the Amazon, on its way to Europe\r\nor the United States; whereas, if the navigation of the Amazon were free,\r\nand steam-vessels placed on its waters, the produce of the interior could\r\nbe landed at Pará for what it costs to convey it across the Andes to the\r\nports of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Herndon embarked on the Huallaga at Tinga-Maria, the head of\r\ncanoe navigation, and 335 miles from the city of Lima, and descended to\r\nits junction with the Amazon, and thence to the mouth of the latter, a\r\ndistance of not less than 3,500 miles. The first place he came to was\r\nTarapoto, situated in a beautiful plain, watered by many rivulets, and\r\nproducing cotton, coffee, sugar, cocoa, and drugs in great abundance.\r\nThe district is very healthy, and free from annoying insects. Indigo\r\ngrows wild, and storax, cinnamon, and gums may be procured of the Indians\r\nin any quantity, and at prices merely nominal. A great deal of good\r\ncotton cloth is made here by the women, and exchanged at Egas for straw\r\nhats and English prints brought from Pará. There is very little money\r\nin circulation, cotton cloth, wax, and balls of sewing cotton being\r\nused instead. English goods brought over the Andes sell in Tarapoto\r\nfor four times their value in Lima. All the land carriage is performed\r\nby Indians, for want of roads: an Indian will carry 75 lbs. of goods\r\non his shoulders from Tarapoto to Juan Guerra, whence he paddles in a\r\ncanoe to Tinga-Maria, and there shoulders his burthen again, and carries\r\nit to Huanaco, the distance of which town from Tarapoto is 390 miles.\r\nThe population of the place in 1848 was 3,500. Concerning its natural\r\nadvantages and future prospects, Lieutenant Herndon thus speaks:—\r\n\r\n    ‘I spoke with an active and intelligent young Spanish trader,\r\n    named Morey, about the feasibility of a steamboat enterprise\r\n    upon these rivers, bringing American goods and taking\r\n    return-cargoes of coffee, tobacco, straw-hats, hammocks, and\r\n    sarsaparilla to the ports of Brazil on the river. He thought\r\n    that it could not fail to enrich any one who would attempt\r\n    it; but that the difficulty lay in the fact that my proposed\r\n    steamer would never get as far as this, for that my goods\r\n    would be bought up and paid for in return-cargoes long before\r\n    she reached Peru. He thought, too, that the Brazilians along\r\n    the river had money which they would be glad to exchange for\r\n    comforts and luxuries. Were I to engage in any scheme of\r\n    colonization for the purpose of evolving the resources of the\r\n    Valley of the Amazon, I think I should direct the attention\r\n    of settlers to this district of Tarapoto. It combines more\r\n    advantages than any other I know; it is healthy, fertile, and\r\n    free from the torment of musquitoes and sand-flies. Wheat may\r\n    be had from the high lands above it; cattle thrive well; and\r\n    its coffee, tobacco, sugar-cane, rice, and maize are of fine\r\n    quality. It is true that vessels cannot come up to Shapaja,\r\n    the port of the town of Tarapoto; but a good road may be made\r\n    from this town eighteen miles to Chasuta, to which vessels of\r\n    five feet draught may come at the lowest stage of the river,\r\n    and any draught at high water. Tarapoto is situated on an\r\n    elevated plain twenty miles in diameter; is seventy miles\r\n    from Moyobamba, the capital of the province, a city of seven\r\n    thousand inhabitants; and has close around it the villages of\r\n    Lamas, Tabalosas, Juan Guerra, and Shapaja. The Ucayali is\r\n    navigable higher up than this point, and the quality of cotton\r\n    and coffee seems better, within certain limits further from\r\n    the equator. But the settler at the head-waters of the Ucayali\r\n    has to place himself in a profound wilderness, with the forest\r\n    and the savage to subdue, and entirely dependent upon his own\r\n    resources. I think he would be better placed near where he can\r\n    get provisions and assistance whilst he is clearing the forest\r\n    and planting his fields. I am told that the governors of the\r\n    districts in all the province of Mainas have authority to give\r\n    titles to land to any one who desires to cultivate it.’\r\n\r\nSix leagues below Tarapoto is Chasuta, with a population of 1,200. The\r\nannual value of the trade between this place and the ports below is\r\n1,500 dollars; but all articles which can be carried on the backs of\r\nIndians or mules come from Lima. Implements of iron, copper kettles,\r\nguns, earthenware, and glass, come from Pará, and obtain prices which\r\nafford very large profits. Though the distance from this place to the\r\nmouth of the Amazon is above 3,000 miles, a 74-gun ship would find water\r\nenough, during the greater part of the year, to reach it from the sea.\r\nThe villages of Yurimaguas, Santa Cruz, and Chamizuras, respectively\r\n24, 35, and 89 leagues below Chasuta, have each a population of about\r\n320, and in the woods around the last, valuable resins and gums abound.\r\nHalf a mile below Yurimaguas is the mouth of the Cachiyacu, which is\r\nnavigable for large canoes, from January to June, as far as Balza Puerto,\r\na considerable village, five days’ journey from Moyobamba, between which\r\nand the ports of the Amazon this river is the general route. It also\r\nserves as a means of communication with the many villages which dot the\r\nfine country between the Marañon and the Huallaga, so that Yurimaguas is\r\nprobably destined to become an important place in the future. Laguna, 44\r\nleagues below Chasuta, and four above the mouth of the Huallaga, has a\r\npopulation of 1,044. Urarinas, a village on the Amazon, five leagues from\r\nthe mouth of the Huallaga, contains only 80 inhabitants, but the immense\r\nnumber in the vicinity of the trees which produce gum copal mark it as an\r\nimportant place in the future. Nauta, on the right bank of the Amazon, 46\r\nleagues below the junction of the Huallaga, has a population of 1,000.\r\nIt is to this place that Brazil, by treaty with Peru, has engaged to run\r\nsteamers, under the Brazilian flag, from Pará, the contractors to have\r\nthe monopoly of steam-boat navigation on the Amazon for thirty years,\r\nwith an annual bonus of 100,000 dollars for the first fifteen. The voyage\r\nis to be performed by two steamers, one ascending the Amazon from Pará,\r\nthe other descending it from Nauta, and meeting the up boat at Barra.\r\nPassing Omaguas, with its 240 inhabitants, Iquitos with its 227, and\r\nArau with its 80, the mouth of the Napo is reached; and thirteen leagues\r\nlower down is Pebas, with a population of 387. This place is embosomed\r\nin the immense forest, producing in abundance sarsaparilla, vanilla,\r\nstorax, copal, caoutchouc, and wax, which may be obtained from the\r\nIndians in exchange for cotton goods, needles, beads, &c. Thirty-four\r\npounds of sarsaparilla may be bought for 24 yards of common cotton, and\r\nother articles at a like proportionate price; but the great sarsaparilla\r\ncountry is along the banks of the Ucayali and the Ahuaytia, where 100\r\nlbs. of the drug, which are worth fully £5 at Pará, and twice as much in\r\nEurope, may be bought for eight yards of cotton.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the circumambulatory manner in which the commerce\r\nof this extensive region is carried on, let us trace the progress of the\r\ncotton goods from the warehouse in Liverpool to the banks of the Ucayali.\r\nThe goods have to be carried round Cape Horn to Callao, where duty is\r\ncharged upon them, and whence it is conveyed to Lima, and across the\r\nAndes, on the backs of mules. Freight, land carriage, and commission cost\r\nmore than the goods, and in about twelve months from the time of their\r\nleaving Liverpool they reach the mouth of the Ucayali, whence they are\r\nsent up by boat to Sarayacu, the centre of the sarsaparilla country, a\r\ndistance of 300 miles. It is now exchanged for 100 lbs. of sarsaparilla,\r\nthe value of which is 9 dollars at Nauta, 10½ at Tabatinga, 25 at Pará,\r\nand from 40 to 60, according to the markets, in Liverpool. The voyage is\r\nlong, tedious, and circumgyratory, but the profits are enormous. Now,\r\nif the navigation of the Amazon were free, and ports of entry, open to\r\nall nations, were established at such places as Chasuta and Nauta, not\r\nonly would the trade be considerably increased, to the benefit of both\r\nparties, but the people of Peru and Brazil instead of eight yards of\r\ncotton for 100 lbs. of sarsaparilla, would get three or four hundred\r\nyards. Such will soon be the case.\r\n\r\nConcerning the cost and profit of steam vessels on the Amazon, and the\r\narrangements that would have to be made, Lieut. Herndon says:—\r\n\r\n    ‘I have estimated the annual cost of running a small steamer\r\n    between Loreto, the frontier port of Peru and Chasuta,\r\n    a distance of eight hundred miles, entirely within the\r\n    Peruvian territory, at twenty thousand dollars, including the\r\n    establishment of blacksmiths’ and carpenters’ shops at Nauta\r\n    for her repairs. According to the estimate of Arebalo, (and\r\n    I judge that he is very nearly correct,) the value of the\r\n    imports and exports to and from Brazil is twenty thousand\r\n    dollars annually. I have no doubt that the appearance of a\r\n    steamer in these waters would at once double the value; for it\r\n    would, in the first place, convert the thousand men who are\r\n    now employed in the fetching and carrying of the articles of\r\n    trade into producers, and would give a great impulse to trade\r\n    by facilitating it. A loaded canoe takes eighty days to ascend\r\n    these eight hundred miles. A steamer will do it in twelve,\r\n    giving ample time to take in wood, to land and receive cargo at\r\n    the various villages on the river, and to lay by at night.’\r\n\r\nNearly midway between Loreto and Barra, and near the mouths of the\r\nJurua, the Yapurá, and the Teffé, is Egas, with a population of about\r\n800, which is the most thriving place above Barra. It has eight or ten\r\ncommercial houses that carry on a brisk trade between Peru and Pará,\r\nbesides employing agents to ascend the neighbouring rivers, and collect\r\nfrom the Indians the produce of the country. Schooners of between 30 and\r\n40 tons average five months in the round trip between Egas and Pará, a\r\ndistance of 1250 miles, the expenses being 150 dollars, including wages\r\nand rations of crew, and a tax of 13 per cent. Sarsaparilla and salt-fish\r\nare the principal exports, which are sold at Pará for double what they\r\ncost at Egas, to which the vessels return with cotton goods, earthenware,\r\nand hardware, all of the commonest description, to be sold at an advance\r\nof 20 per cent. on Pará prices. There are five vessels engaged in this\r\ntrade, making two trips a year, so that the annual value of the trade\r\nbetween Egas and Pará may be estimated at 38,000 dollars. Between Egas\r\nand Peru it is about 20,000 dollars. The vessels engaged in this trade\r\nare not well adapted to it; they are too broad in the beam, and their\r\nsails are two small, so that the voyage occupies a great deal more time\r\nthan it might be performed in by clipper-built and properly rigged\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThe Comarca of the Rio Negro, one of the territorial divisions of the\r\nimmense province of Pará, has, within the last year, been erected into\r\na province, with the title of Amazonas. A custom-house will probably\r\nsoon be established at Barra, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, for the\r\ncollection of the duties now paid at Pará, and there can be no doubt that\r\ncommercial enterprise will, in a few years, bring the manufactures of\r\nEurope from Demerara by the Essequibo and the Rio Branco. The president\r\nof the new province, Senhor Joâo B. de F. T. Aranha, is labouring for\r\nthe good of the district, and has had many conferences with the chiefs\r\nof the Indian tribes with the view of inducing them to settle and engage\r\nin systematic agricultural labour. Lieutenant Herndon was told that\r\nBrazil would give titles to vacant lands to any foreigners who would\r\nsettle there, and the President expressed a wish that he would bring out\r\na thousand Americans to set an example of energy and industry to the\r\nnatives.[63] The value in dollars of the exports of the entire Comarca\r\nin 1840 was as follows:—Sarsaparilla, 12,000; oil of turtle-eggs, 6,000;\r\nsalt fish, 4,250; coffee, 1,000; copaiba, 1,000; tobacco, 720; cocoa,\r\n600; heavy boards, 600; hammocks, 500; Brazil nuts, 350; pitch, tow,\r\nhides, tapioca, &c., 1,203; total, 28,323. That the trade is increasing\r\nwill be seen by the exports of the town of Barra alone for the year 1850,\r\nthe value of which in dollars was as follows: Salt-fish, 7,001; Brazil\r\nnuts, 5,203; sarsaparilla, 3,144; oil of turtle-eggs, 1,818; piasaba,\r\n1,802[64]; ropes, 896; cocoa, 631; hammocks, 785; coffee, 474; tobacco,\r\n616; planks, 250; Brazilian nutmegs, 100[65]; copaiba, hides, tow, &c.,\r\n304; total, 22,975. It will be seen that the exports of Barra alone in\r\n1850 were not in value far below those of the whole province in 1840. It\r\nis probable that the value of the imports is nearly double that of the\r\nexports, so that the trade of Barra with Pará may fairly be estimated at\r\n£15,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe population of Barra in 1848 was 3,848 persons; the marriages in the\r\nyear had been 115, the births 250, and the deaths 25. The number of\r\ninhabited houses was 470, so that upon an average of five persons to each\r\nfamily, there must be nearly two families to every house; but 234 of\r\nthe population were slaves, and probably the children exceed the adults\r\nin a greater proportion than the usual ratio of three to two. The Rio\r\nNegro, opposite the town, is a mile and a half wide, and very beautiful.\r\nIt is navigable for almost any draught as far as Rio Maraya, a distance\r\nof about 400 miles; there the rapids commence, and the further ascent\r\nmust be made in canoes. A few miles above Barcellos is the mouth of the\r\nriver Quiuni, which is known to run nearly up to the Yapurá; and nearly\r\nopposite to San Isabel, two days journey from Barcellos, is the mouth\r\nof the Jurubashea, which also runs up to within a very short distance\r\nof the same river. Between these rivers the country is very low, and is\r\noften inundated; it is from this place that the Brazilian nutmegs are\r\nbrought. Just above San Isabel great quantities of Brazil nuts are grown,\r\nand a little further up is the mouth of the Cababuri, where the finest\r\nsarsaparilla is produced. Cocoa of very superior quality is produced in\r\nabundance about San Carlos, at the mouth of the Cassiquiari, which is the\r\nfrontier port of Venezuela. Most of the vessels which ply both on the Rio\r\nNegro and the Orinoco are built at this place, the Cassiquiari forming a\r\nnatural canal connecting those two rivers. Lieutenant Herndon calculates\r\nthat a flat-bottomed iron-steamer, constructed to pass the rapids, would\r\nmake seventy-five miles a day against the current on the Rio Negro, and\r\n125 miles a day with the current on the Orinoco. The distance from Barra\r\nto San Carlos is about 660 miles, from thence to the Orinoco 180 miles,\r\nfrom the junction of the Cassiquiari and the Orinoco to Angostura 780\r\nmiles, and from Angostura to the mouth of the Orinoco 250 miles. The\r\nvoyage between Barra and the mouth of the last-named river might thus\r\nbe made by such a vessel in 19½ days, allowing time to take in wood and\r\nreceive and discharge cargo; and a canal cut through the isthmus of\r\nTuamini would shorten the voyage by five days.[66]\r\n\r\nThe Rio Branco, the principal tributary of the Negro, is navigable for\r\nlarge craft for about 300 miles from its mouth, but from thence it is\r\ninterrupted by rapids, only passable by flat-bottomed boats. Its banks\r\nare very thickly wooded below the rapids, but above them the country\r\nis a wide plain, which affords pasturage to immense herds of cattle.\r\nThe downward passage from San Joachim, near the sources of the river,\r\nto Barra, a distance of 500 miles, may be made in twelve days; but the\r\nascent is very tedious, owing to the rapids and the strong north-easterly\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nScarcely any attempt at regular cultivation has yet been made in any\r\npart of Amazonas; but the natural productions of its teeming soil are\r\nnumerous as they are varied and valuable. The forests contain many trees\r\nwhich afford solid and durable timber, and others that furnish excellent\r\ncabinet woods, among which may be mentioned the beautiful _muirapinima_,\r\nor tortoise-shell wood. There are numerous plants, unknown in Europe,\r\nfamous for their medicinal uses; and others which produce valuable\r\nresins and oils. Wild cotton, with a fine glossy fibre, like silk, grows\r\nabundantly, and is used at Guayaquil to stuff mattresses. Some silk\r\nmanufacturers in France, to whom specimens of this cotton were sent by\r\nMr. Clay, the United States chargé d’affaires at Lima, thought that,\r\nmixed with silk, a cheap and pretty fabric might be wove from it.\r\n\r\nSantarem, a mile above the mouth of the Tapajos, which is there a mile\r\nand a half wide, is the largest town in the province after Pará. In 1849\r\nthe population was 6,768, the number of marriages 32, of births 289, of\r\ndeaths 42; but in this return is included the inhabitants of a large\r\nsurrounding district. Lieut. Herndon estimated the population of the\r\ntown alone at about 2,000. There is a church, and two or three primary\r\nschools. The situation is picturesque, and there are many agreeable rides\r\nin the environs. It is a thriving town, as is shown by the increase\r\nin the exports between 1843 and 1846. For three months of the former\r\nyear the quantity of cocoa exported was 12,808 arrobas, and in the same\r\nperiod of 1846 it was 19,940 arrobas. Sarsaparilla increased from 665 to\r\n4,836 arrobas, pitch from 64 to 933, tobacco from 499 to 3,352, cloves\r\nfrom 226 to 998, cotton from 24 to 226, oil of copaiba from 427 pots to\r\n3,056 pots, and oil of turtle-eggs from 420 to 1,628 pots. Hides and\r\npiasaba rope appear in the list for the first time in 1846, the number\r\nof the former exported being 664. The trade in farina had considerably\r\ndecreased, probably owing to the increased importation of flour from\r\nthe United States. The trade between Santarem and Pará is carried on in\r\nschooners of about a hundred tons, of which there were five or six lying\r\noff the town when Mr. Herndon was there. The average passage downward is\r\nthirteen, and upward twenty-five days.\r\n\r\nFrom Santarem to Itaituba, a distance of about 200 miles, the Tapajos\r\nis navigable for large vessels, though the current is very strong; but\r\nabove the latter place the ascent can be made only by boats, as there are\r\nfifteen or twenty rapids to pass, where the boats have to be unloaded,\r\nand the cargoes carried round on the backs of the crew. At one or two of\r\nthe rapids the boat itself has to be hauled over the land. The voyage to\r\nthe head of navigation on the Rio Preto occupies about two months. From\r\nthis point the cargoes are carried on the backs of mules to Diamantino,\r\na distance of fifteen miles, and from thence to Cuiaba, the capital of\r\nthe rich province of Matto Grosso, a further distance of ninety miles.\r\nIn 1850 a nearer route was discovered, by ascending the Arinos, below\r\nthe mouth of the Preto, and employing oxen to drag the boat eighteen\r\nmiles to the river Cuiaba, which is navigable thence to the town of that\r\nname; but, for some reason or other, the trade is still carried on by the\r\nold route. Cuiaba receives from Santarem salt, iron, wines, arms, and\r\nearthenware, which it pays for with diamonds, gold-dust, and hides. M.\r\nAlphonse M. de Lincourt, who ascended the Tapajos a few years since, says\r\nthat the forests, which extend from its banks far away on both sides,\r\nare inhabited by hostile Indians, who paint and tattoo themselves, and\r\nwear caps of feathers, and collars and bracelets of beads, shells, and\r\njaguars’ teeth. The Mundrucus, the most warlike tribe of the Amazon,\r\nnumber from fifteen to twenty thousand warriors, and are the terror of\r\nall the other tribes.\r\n\r\nNinety miles below Santarem is the village of Prainha, situate on a green\r\neminence on the left bank of the Amazon, with a population of about 500.\r\nFifty-five miles below this place is the mouth of the little river Parú,\r\nour only knowledge of which is derived from the Indians, who report that\r\nthe country through which it flows produces sarsaparilla and cloves, but\r\nthat its current is very strong, its course broken by rapids, and the\r\nIndians who live on its banks are hostile. Seventy miles below the mouth\r\nof the river, and on the right bank, is the village of Gurupá, with a\r\npopulation of 300, and a small trade in caoutchouc. Near this place is\r\nthe mouth of the Xingù, of which very little is known; but the municipal\r\njudge of Porto de Moz, near its mouth, who met Mr. Herndon at the house\r\nof the military commandant of Gurupá, informed that gentleman that it was\r\nobstructed by rapids within four days’ journey from its mouth, and that\r\nboats could not ascend far up on account of the hostility of the Indian\r\ntribes on its banks.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles below Gurupá the Amazon spreads out to a width of\r\nnearly 150 miles, but it is divided into numerous channels by a multitude\r\nof islands, the principal of which is Marajó, which contains about\r\n10,000 square miles, and occupies about the middle of the river. The\r\nvillage of Breves, on this island, exports annually to Pará about 3,000\r\narrobas of caoutchouc: it has a church and several shops, and has a\r\nthriving appearance. Three days’ sailing lower down is the mouth of\r\nthe Tocantins, which falls into the Bay of Limoeiro, a deep and wide\r\nindentation of the right bank of the Amazon. The Tocantins, according\r\nto M. Castelnau, who descended it in 1846, is an almost continuous\r\nsuccession of cataracts and rapids; but by unloading the boats at three\r\nplaces, and dragging them with ropes, it can be ascended as high as Porto\r\nImperial, the voyage to which place from Pará occupies from four to five\r\nmonths, but, owing to the fall in the river, the downward voyage may be\r\nperformed in from twenty-five to thirty days.\r\n\r\nThe opening of new markets to commercial enterprise must always\r\ntend to increase the prosperity of the countries concerned, and the\r\nfree navigation of the Amazon has become a question of the greatest\r\nimportance. According to General Villamil, the Secretary of State of\r\nthe republic of Equador, the Pastaça is navigable nearly up to Quito,\r\nand nothing is wanting but the removal of the restrictions which have\r\nunwisely been placed upon the navigation of the Amazon to enable the\r\nmerchants of Europe and the United States to send the manufactured\r\ngoods of their respective countries to the very foot of the Andes, and\r\ntake back in exchange the raw produce with which the Atlantic slopes of\r\nthose mountains so largely abound. But because the mouth of the river is\r\nwithin Brazil, she once persisted in shutting out New Grenada, Equador,\r\nBolivia,[67] and Peru from the advantages which the Creator, in rolling\r\nits broad stream through their fertile plains and teeming valleys,\r\nintended they should enjoy. The reciprocal interests of all nations now\r\nimperatively demand that the barrier which these restrictions present to\r\nthe progress of civilization in the interior of South America should be\r\nremoved. One of the first results of the opening up of the vast regions\r\nwatered by the Amazon and its tributaries to Anglo-Saxon enterprise would\r\nbe a large influx of immigrants, and this is precisely what is wanted\r\nto develope the boundless natural resources of those countries.[68]\r\nBrazil is alive to the necessity. Persons unacquainted with the country,\r\nforming their opinion from other tropical regions, are apt to conclude\r\nthat the climate is unhealthy, but this is very far from being the case.\r\nSimilarity of latitude by no means produces similarity of climate; for\r\nEngland and Labrador are under the same parallel, but how different the\r\nclimates of the two countries. The elevation of a country is a better\r\nmeans of estimating its climate than its latitude, and the extent of wood\r\nand water have also to be taken into account. The province of Caxamarca\r\nwhich is watered by the Peruvian tributaries of the Amazon, is one of\r\nthe most healthy portions of the globe. Mr. Edwards, who, as already\r\nobserved, ascended the Amazon in 1846, and resided some time at Pará,\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n    ‘It seems singular that, directly under the equator, where,\r\n    through a clear atmosphere, the sun strikes vertically upon the\r\n    earth, the heat should be less oppressive than in the latitude\r\n    of New York; this is owing to several causes. The days are but\r\n    twelve hours long, and the earth does not become so intensely\r\n    heated as where they are sixteen. The vast surface of water\r\n    constantly cools the air by its evaporation, and removes the\r\n    irksome dryness that, in temperate regions, renders a less\r\n    degree of heat insupportable. And, finally, the constant winds\r\n    blowing from the sea refresh and invigorate the system.’\r\n\r\nHe adds that the temperature is so equable, that the climate is\r\npeculiarly favourable to health, that no form of epidemic disease is\r\nknown, and that the average duration of life is probably as high as in\r\nNew York. The salubrity of the climate,[69] therefore, the fertility of\r\nthe soil, its mineral riches, and the number and length of its navigable\r\nrivers, combine to render the region watered by the Amazon and its\r\ntributaries a most eligible field for the emigrant.[70] All that the\r\ncountry wants is increased facilities for commerce and for developing its\r\nimmense natural resources, and these would be given to it by the opening\r\nof the Amazon and immigration.[71]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BRAZIL: ITS CLIMATE AND PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT DUNDAS, M.D.,\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN TO THE NORTHERN HOSPITAL, LIVERPOOL; FORMERLY SURGEON TO\r\nHER MAJESTY’S 60TH REGIMENT; AND FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS MEDICAL\r\nSUPERINTENDENT OF THE BRITISH HOSPITAL, BAHIA.\r\n\r\n    Climate of Brazil.—Its salubrity.—Proofs of, causes of,\r\n    objections to.—Northern, southern, and central provinces.\r\n    —Equability of temperature.—Heat.—Humidity.—Rain.—Winds.—\r\n    Electricity.—Hail.—Ice.—Tropical heat and light.—Influence on\r\n    Europeans.—In health and in disease.—Acclimatization.—Increase\r\n    of certain diseases.—Others modified.—Insanity.—Yellow\r\n    fever.—Its probable disappearance.—Ancient writers on\r\n    the epidemics of Brazil: Rocha Pita, Père Labat, Fereira\r\n    da Rosa.—Physical, social, and moral condition of the\r\n    Brazilians.—Habits and religion of the people.—Prophylactic\r\n    measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a publication like the present, any elaborate disquisition on the\r\nclimate and people of Brazil would be obviously misplaced, at the same\r\ntime that a brief notice of these important subjects should not be\r\naltogether omitted. The Brazilian empire placed chiefly in the southern\r\nhemisphere, extending from 4° 20″ N. lat. to 33° 55″ S., is widely\r\nintersected by lakes rivers and mountains, and bounded by the South\r\nAtlantic, by the highest mountains, and by the two most magnificent\r\nrivers in the world: it enjoys, beyond dispute, one of the finest\r\nclimates of the globe, and may be fairly designated as ‘the Italy’ of\r\nthe New World. The heat, intense at Pará on the equator, moderates as\r\nwe approach the central provinces of the empire, and becomes altogether\r\nEuropean on reaching the southern regions of Rio Grande and the Uruguay;\r\nwhilst the climate of the entire line of coast is tempered by a cool\r\nand never-failing breeze. It should however be borne in mind that\r\nclimate cannot be justly measured by latitude, and that we must, in all\r\ninstances, take into consideration the position and the elevation of the\r\ndistrict, the nature and surface of the soil, and its consequent capacity\r\nfor the absorption and the radiation of heat. First, then, as regards\r\nheat, which may be termed the distinctive element of the climate of\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nThe mean heat of Brazil ranges from 88° to 81° F., according to the\r\ndifferent seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nRIO GRANDE DO SUL.—The summer temperature is 87° to 88°; the winter, 40°\r\nto 44°.\r\n\r\nSAINT CATHERINE.—The summer heat never passes 90° in the sun; and\r\ndescends to 54° in winter—June and July.\r\n\r\nSAINT PAUL.—Mean temperature, 72°.\r\n\r\nMINAS GERAES.—Max., 84° summer; min., 54° winter.\r\n\r\nRIO JANEIRO.—The mean temperature of 30 years was 73°: in December, the\r\nmax., 89½°; min., 70°; mean, 79°; in July (coldest month), max., 79°;\r\nmin., 66°; mean, 73½°.\r\n\r\nBAHIA.—Summer: 74° morning; noon, 80°; evening, 75½°.\r\n\r\nPERNAMBUCO.—Summer: Varies from 77° to 86°, with a slight decline in the\r\nrainy season.\r\n\r\nCEARA.—95° in the hottest months; 83° in the coldest.\r\n\r\nMARANHAM.—St. Louis reaches 93°; and Pará, on the line, maintains about\r\nthe same temperature.\r\n\r\nThe hottest period of the day, on the sea coast, is about 11 a.m., when\r\nthe sea-breeze commonly sets in and moderates the temperature. The\r\nthermometer ranges in the northern provinces on the coast, at midday, 75°\r\nto 77° from March to September, and 77° to 85° from September to March;\r\nwhilst at forty to fifty miles inland a high range of temperature almost\r\ninvariably prevails. The barometrical variations are less extensive than\r\nthose of the thermometer; but the range of the hygrometer is considerable\r\nin the southern provinces. The object, however, of the present work\r\nprohibits our entering minutely on these questions, or on the geology\r\nof Brazil; and we must therefore refer our readers to the scientific\r\nlabours of M.M. Eschwège, Sellow, Spix and Martius, and Saint Hilaire,\r\nand especially to the valuable and more recent investigations of M.\r\nPissis, who has explored the country from 13° to 26° south latitude, and\r\n40° to 52° west longitude, including in this vast polygon the provinces\r\nof Minas Geraes, St. Paul, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, and Bahia.[72]\r\nThe observations of Herschel, Humboldt and others, prove that both heat\r\nand cold, up to 34th degree of latitude, are much more moderate in the\r\nsouthern than in the northern hemisphere; in addition to which, Brazil,\r\ncovered by extensive forests and consequent moisture, the surface\r\nclothed with perpetual verdure, from which the solar heat is but feebly\r\nreflected, its skies ever bright and a never-failing breeze, constitute a\r\nclimate of unequalled mildness in any other region of the tropical world.\r\n\r\nHUMIDITY: This grand and universal source of vegetable life in high\r\nlatitudes is infinitely more detrimental to man than even the highest\r\nsolar heat. Humidity, indeed, is the great modifier of all climates, and\r\nconstitutes the chief element of their insalubrity. The hygrometrical\r\nvariations of Brazil have been studied by numerous observers, amongst\r\nwhom the most accurate as well as the most recent is M. Pissis, and to\r\nhis conclusions we shall briefly allude, confining ourselves to the\r\nclimate of the capital, Rio de Janeiro, which, notwithstanding its clear\r\natmosphere, holds in solution just double the quantity of aqueous vapour\r\nsustained by the sombre, foggy air of Paris! a fact explained however by\r\nthe high temperature of the one, as compared with the low temperature of\r\nthe other, the capacity of air for retaining moisture being in nearly\r\nexact proportion to its temperature. M. Pissis arrives at the following\r\nresults:—\r\n\r\n1. From May to October, when the air is serene, the quantity of vapour\r\nvaries little throughout the day. During the other months, the minimum\r\ncorresponds with sunrise, and attains its maximum about 4 p.m.; but the\r\nvariations are trifling.\r\n\r\n2. That on rainy days the air is always near its point of saturation,\r\nthough the amount of vapour dissolved little exceeds that of the\r\npreceding clear weather: this is due to the lower temperature of the\r\nrainy days.\r\n\r\n3. That humidity increases from the month of June to February, when\r\nit attains its maximum, which is about double that of June; from this\r\nmaximum it declines until it reaches its former amount in June and July.\r\n\r\n4. That the absorbing power of the air is lowest at sunrise, and attains\r\nits maximum about 2 p.m., the hottest period of the day. In like manner\r\nas regards the year, it augments in proportion as the sun advances to the\r\nsouthern tropic, and attains its maximum in December and January, and\r\nthen declines until the cloudy months of June and July.\r\n\r\nRAIN: The wet season sets in at different epochs along the coast of\r\nBrazil, and is subject to great variation. At RIO the rains commonly\r\ncommence in March, and last till September; at ST. PAUL, in October\r\nand November, and continue till April; whilst at ST. CATHERINE the\r\nfour seasons are, as in Europe, pretty distinctly defined—July and\r\nthe following three months wet, cloudy, and boisterous. These latter\r\nprovinces, placed just beyond the Tropic of Capricorn, enjoy the\r\nadvantages of a tropical climate without its inconveniences. RIO GRANDE\r\nDO SUL is wet and stormy in the winter months, but otherwise healthy. In\r\nthe provinces north of RIO, including BAHIA and PERNAMBUCO, the rains\r\nset in commonly about the end of March, and continue until August;\r\nand as we follow the coast to the equator, including the provinces of\r\nCEARA, MARANHAM, and PARÁ, storms are frequent, and the rains commence\r\nin December or January; August, September, October, and November being\r\nthe dryest or summer months. The foregoing may be taken as the rule,\r\nbut the exceptions are numerous; and the winter of the coast does not\r\nextend beyond 100 miles into the interior, which is watered, chiefly, by\r\nfrequent storms.\r\n\r\nWINDS: The general winds of tropical regions are eastern; and in Brazil\r\nthe prevailing currents along the coast, from St. Catherine to Maranham,\r\nare E.S.E., and S.S.E., during the southern, and E.N.E. and N.N.E.\r\nduring the northern monsoon; subject however to much irregularity. The\r\nland breeze sets in from 9 to 11 p.m., and lasts till morning, increasing\r\nin force and regularity as we approach the equator; and its strength is\r\ngenerally in proportion to that of the sea breeze which precedes it. As\r\nin other tropical countries, the sea breeze prevails more in the hot,\r\nand the land breeze in the cold season of the year; they favour the\r\nappearance of certain maladies and check others, and constitute, after\r\nheat and moisture the chief element in the determination of disease—the\r\nsalubrity of any country depending more, perhaps, on its winds than on\r\nits latitude.\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY: All tropical regions are distinguished by intensity of\r\nelectrical phenomena, and Brazil forms no exception to the law. Réaumur\r\nmaintains, and we believe justly, that a difference of 5° in the\r\nthermometer decidedly affects the nervous system; and that all living\r\norganisms are powerfully influenced by electrical changes no close\r\nobserver in equatorial regions can for an instant question. In Brazil,\r\nthe most intense variations are noticed about the change of the monsoons,\r\nand the storms of lightning and thunder originating in the great chain of\r\nthe Organ Mountains, which burst over Rio, are grand and awful beyond\r\nthe possibility of description; whilst the profound influence of these\r\nchanges on individuals is strongly pourtrayed in the moral and physical\r\nprostration of some, and the high nervous excitement of others. Saussure\r\nhas shown that an excess of watery saturation diminishes atmospheric\r\npressure; and the effect of certain conditions of the atmosphere on the\r\nhuman economy in tropical climates cannot for a moment be denied: for\r\nexample, when the weather is wet and cloudy, the sun obscured, and the\r\nair calm; all animal life languishes. The Brazilians distinguish this\r\nstate of atmosphere by a particular term, ‘mormaço,’ and during its\r\ncontinuance, especially in summer, the mental and bodily powers of man\r\nseem alike paralysed, and are only restored to activity when the rain has\r\ndescended and the breeze resumed its power over the close and stagnant\r\natmosphere. Here electricity plays an important part. In connection with\r\nthis subject, it is remarkable that Brazil should have hitherto escaped\r\nthose formidable earthquakes which have so often desolated the fairest\r\nregions of South America. FOGS are rare in Brazil, and seen only in the\r\nmorning, on low and marshy grounds, and in the neighbourhood of rivers\r\nand lakes. HAIL often falls in Minas, St. Paul, and the south, and even\r\noccasionally at Rio. ICE is sometimes met with at Rio Grande in the\r\nwinter, and even on the Organ Mountains, close to Rio, but never snow.\r\nWATERSPOUTS have been, at long intervals, observed on the coast and in\r\nthe interior; the last of any importance was observed at San Marcos in\r\n1823.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing and other data, we shall now submit certain\r\ngeneral conclusions on the climate of Brazil, and its influence on the\r\nhuman constitution in health and disease; these conclusions must be taken\r\nas more especially referring to the seaboard and the large cities on the\r\ncoast; and the reader should bear in mind that some allowance must also\r\nbe made for the difference in position and latitude of the northern,\r\nthe southern, and the central provinces. We would further premise, that\r\nthese observations are founded on our own personal experience of nearly a\r\nquarter of a century, and prior to the advent of the yellow fever which,\r\nfor the last four or five years, has infested the maritime cities of the\r\nempire, and on which we shall presently offer some remarks.\r\n\r\nThe great characteristic of Brazil, as compared with other countries,\r\nis the general equability of its climate, and which constitutes, in\r\nfact, the chief element of its salubrity. This unparalleled uniformity\r\nof temperature must be chiefly ascribed to the absence of high and\r\nmountainous regions, and of all arid and sandy deserts, aided by the\r\ngenial influence of refreshing showers at all seasons of the year; it\r\nis further maintained by the perpetual verdure of the country, and\r\nby a cool, powerful, and never-failing monsoon, laden with moisture,\r\nand sweeping along the entire line of coast direct from the Southern\r\nAtlantic. Thus, even in the height of summer, the diurnal heat is rarely\r\nfound oppressive to the European, and the nights are almost invariably\r\nserene and beautiful, and unattended with much deposition of dew,\r\nespecially in the northern and central provinces; so that the delightful\r\ncoolness of tropical moonlight may be enjoyed undisturbed by those\r\nvisions of fever and malaria which float before the imagination in less\r\nfavoured lands. If precautions be observed to avoid exposure to direct\r\ncurrents of air, the windows of the sleeping chamber may also be left\r\nopen with impunity at all seasons of the year; an advantage that can\r\nscarcely be over estimated in high latitudes, as disposing to sound and\r\nrefreshing sleep; which, more perhaps than any other influence enables\r\nthe European constitution to resist the deleterious effects of climate,\r\njust as a succession of hot and sleepless nights invariably predisposes\r\nthe human system to be impressed by every tropical malady.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the singular salubrity of Brazil, we need only state that,\r\nuntil within the last four years, although its provinces have been at\r\nintervals visited by revolutions, wars, and famine, the country has\r\nhitherto escaped from all those epidemic and endemic scourges—_yellow\r\nfever_, _cholera_, _influenza_, _typhus_, and _dysentery_—which have\r\nso frequently desolated other, and the fairest regions of the globe.\r\nIn this favoured land the solar heat proves scarcely less influential\r\nand salutary to animal than to vegetable life; and years of subsequent\r\nexhaustion can never entirely efface from the recollection of the\r\nEuropean sojourner the buoyancy of spirit, unclouded mind, and exquisite\r\nappreciation of mere animal existence which marked the first years of his\r\nresidence in Brazil. These vivid sensations may be in part determined by\r\nthe novelty and splendour of a New World, its brilliant skies, perpetual\r\nverdure, and the variety, luxuriance, and beauty of its vegetable\r\nlife; but they are chiefly due to the direct influence of the heat and\r\nlight of a tropical sun, supplying a new and powerful stimulus to the\r\nperformance of all the functions of animal and organic life. The medal,\r\nunfortunately, has its reverse: this favourable condition of the animal\r\neconomy proves, as in vegetable life under similar circumstances, but\r\nof limited duration; and from five to seven years may be set down as\r\nthe average period at which a tropical residence begins to affect the\r\nEuropean constitution to such an extent as to influence longevity or\r\ninjure health; the precise epoch being determined by the constitution,\r\noccupation, predisposition, and habits of the individual. It should be\r\nhere stated that the month of April is that best suited to the stranger’s\r\narrival in Brazil, as affording time for his gradual acclimatisation\r\nto the summer heat of December, January, and February; though we may\r\nobserve, and the fact is singular, that the European suffers but little\r\ninconvenience from the highest temperature during the first years of his\r\nresidence, just as the Brazilian seldom complains of the winter cold on\r\nhis first arrival in Europe. The chief objection to the climate is, in\r\naddition to high temperature, its great humidity; shown in the rapid\r\ndecomposition of all organized, and certain inorganic matter, the quick\r\noxidation of metals, deliquescence of salts, destruction of wood, &c.\r\n&c.; and after a certain interval, the depression of moral and physical\r\nenergy in man. The deleterious effects of this condition of atmosphere\r\non the animal economy is happily tempered, if not entirely corrected in\r\nBrazil, by the general equability of its climate, and the influence of\r\na cool and _never-failing breeze_, so that a stagnant, or even calm,\r\nstate of the atmosphere is almost entirely unknown. Were this otherwise,\r\nthe chief cities of Brazil inundated by the most offensive animal and\r\nvegetable exhalations,[73] and with an almost total neglect of those\r\npolicial and sanatory regulations so essential to the public health in\r\nother countries, would, we are satisfied, prove no less fatal to man than\r\nthe charnel houses of Africa and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIn estimating, however, the influence of climate on the public health,\r\nthe moral and physical condition of the people demands especial\r\nconsideration. The Brazilian is in general well-formed, compact, and\r\nof healthy organization, but not of athletic frame. His intellectual\r\nfaculties are acute, though little developed by cultivation. Descended\r\nfrom European ancestors, he has still a considerable admixture of\r\nAfrican, and some native American blood. He is indolent by nature, and\r\nindisposed for active exertion or industry; but he is protected against\r\nthe evil influence of the former on his health by a simple and abstemious\r\ndiet, and the injurious consequences of the latter to his social position\r\nare obviated by the fact that the four great wants of the humbler classes\r\nin Europe press but lightly on the Brazilian. Fuel he scarcely requires,\r\nclothing but little; his primitive habitation is simply constructed, and\r\none day’s labour will amply provide for the moderate demands of the whole\r\nweek. With passions naturally quick, he is nevertheless placable; his\r\ndisposition is kindly; the future rarely disturbs him with its doubts,\r\nor the past with its regrets: the struggles and vicissitudes of European\r\nlife are unknown. The contentions of party, the yearnings of ambition,\r\nthe bitterness of fanaticism, never disturb his repose; and after\r\ngliding down the stream of time, unscathed by the tumultuous passions\r\nand harassing cares which so frequently embitter the existence and\r\nundermine the constitution of man in other countries, he meets at length\r\nthe inevitable doom, if not with philosophy, at least with resignation,\r\nsatisfied of his claims to eternal felicity in the confident assurance of\r\nan infallible church.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding account of Brazil and its inhabitants, we would be\r\nled to conclude, _à priori_, that disease would there assume a mild and\r\ntractable character; and this inference we find fully borne out, until\r\nwithin the last twenty years, by the medical and general history of the\r\ncountry. Within the last thirty years, however, vast changes—moral,\r\nsocial, and political—have been developed in Brazil, and it interests\r\nalike the philosopher and the physician to mark how profoundly these\r\nchanges have already impressed and modified the manners, habits, and\r\ndiseases—nay, even the physiognomy of its people. After a brief struggle,\r\nthe establishment of Brazil as an independent empire was effected\r\nin 1823; and since that epoch the country and its population have\r\nundergone a series of remarkable and comprehensive political and social\r\nchanges. From the strict and simple forms of despotic government they\r\nhave passed, at a bound, to one almost of license; including household\r\nsuffrage, popular legislative assemblies (imperial and provincial),\r\nopen courts of law, trial by jury, local justices, and a national guard\r\nelected on popular principles. This sudden and premature concession of\r\npolitical privileges to a people yet in the infancy of civilization has\r\nbeen naturally attended by great and numerous evils, mingled, it must\r\nbe admitted, with many and great advantages. In the intoxication of a\r\nnew-born freedom, the empire has committed numerous excesses; province\r\nhas been arrayed against province, in a succession of intestine broils;\r\nthe laws have been inefficiently or corruptly administered; and a lax\r\nmorality has but too generally pervaded the whole community. On the other\r\nhand, an extensive and well-organized system of national education has\r\nbeen established throughout the empire; the slumbering intellectual\r\npowers of the nation have been aroused; wealth and intelligence\r\ndeveloped; political and military ambition awakened; commercial\r\nenterprise created; agriculture revived; and of all those mighty powers\r\nwhich move and mould societies, the controlling influence of religion has\r\nalone remained stationary. The priesthood, deprived of wealth, power, and\r\ninfluence, has utterly-lost its _prestige_, unless, perhaps, with the\r\nvery lowest classes of the community—a question of curious speculation as\r\nregards the cause, and of vast importance as regards its future results\r\non the character and institutions of the Brazilian people. In addition to\r\nthe foregoing rapid transition of society into new forms and combinations\r\nof social existence, we find the face of the country changed by the\r\nmarch of civilization and agricultural improvement,—woods cleared, roads\r\nopened, internal and external navigation developed, population largely\r\nincreased, and the great maritime cities of the empire assuming an\r\nimportance second to none, and superior to most, of the cities of the new\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nCoeval with these great and rapidly advancing changes, we can already\r\ndiscern some of those evils too commonly attendant on increased wealth,\r\nluxury, and intelligence: anxieties, excesses, passions are largely\r\nmultiplied, and the medical observer cannot fail to distinguish, amongst\r\ncertain ranks of the hitherto contented and indolent Brazilians,\r\nunequivocal traces of that premature ‘wear and tear,’ so strongly and\r\npainfully characteristic of high civilization. It now only remains that\r\nwe should briefly notice the extent to which certain great classes of\r\ndisease have been influenced and modified by the preceding moral and\r\nphysical agencies. This is chiefly manifested in the increasing number\r\nof cerebral and pulmonary maladies, and diseases of the heart and great\r\nvessels. Insanity has also become much more frequent than formerly,\r\nthough still rare as compared with other nations; which, indeed, might\r\nbe inferred from the fact that the ‘Mad Doctor’ is a species of the\r\nprofession as yet unknown to Brazil. Suppurative inflammation of the\r\nliver has increased, but of all the acute diseases, fevers have been the\r\nmost profoundly modified; they partake much more generally of the low,\r\nor asthenic character, and assume the remittent and continued type, and\r\nare greatly more fatal in their results than formerly. This naturally\r\nbrings us to the important question of the ‘yellow fever,’ which for the\r\nlast four or five years has ravaged the great maritime cities of the\r\nempire. Its origin has given rise to the most conflicting views, amongst\r\nthe best observers;—for example, Dr. Pennell of Rio, and Dr. Paterson of\r\nBahia, both men of undoubted talent and great professional experience,\r\nentertain precisely opposite opinions; the former contending for the\r\nindigenous, the latter for the foreign origin of the disease; and both\r\noffer cogent arguments and striking facts in support of these opposite\r\nconclusions. The scope of this work does not admit of medical discussion,\r\nyet as the facts observed by Dr. Pennell are highly important, and as\r\nhis conclusions entirely coincide with our own experience, we will\r\ncondense them here. Dr. Pennell states that for some years the fevers of\r\nthe country had been clearly changing their character, that the genuine\r\nremittent had been little seen for three years; that it was replaced in\r\n1847, ’48, and ’49, by a fever of its own class, popularly known as the\r\n‘polka fever,’ but in reality a remittent; and that this fever was,\r\nin its turn, superseded by the ‘yellow fever,’ a disease with similar\r\nfeatures: he adds the following words, ‘coincident with these and other\r\nchanges in the diseases of Brazil, the climate, in its broad features,\r\nhas altered strangely: thunder-storms, formerly of daily occurrence,\r\nat a certain hour, during the summer, are now but seldom heard, &c.,’\r\nand concludes, ‘that bilious remittent and yellow fever are essentially\r\nthe same disease,’—a proposition entirely in accordance with my own\r\nexperience in Brazil and other countries. The abettors of the foreign\r\norigin of yellow fever insist that it was imported by a certain ship\r\nfrom New Orleans into Bahia, and thence diffused throughout the empire;\r\nwhilst the facts adduced by Dr. Pennell go far to establish, as already\r\nstated, its indigenous parentage. In support of this opinion we have the\r\nstrong additional fact that, for the last forty years, there has existed\r\nuncontrolled by any efficient quarantine laws, an extensive intercourse\r\nwith the United States, Africa, and the West Indies, the very hot-beds of\r\nyellow fever; and yet, up to 1849, Brazil remained perfectly healthy. Can\r\nwe then in reason believe, if the disease be deemed really importable,\r\nthat the maritime cities of Brazil could, under such circumstances, have\r\nescaped infection for a period of forty years? It is moreover important\r\nto know that several of the older writers, as Rocha Pita in 1666, Père\r\nLabat in 1686, Fereira da Rosa in 1694, have recorded the appearance\r\nof epidemics closely resembling the yellow fever, and which, after\r\npersisting for some years and desolating several of the large cities\r\non the coast, finally passed away. Some seventy years ago, the capital\r\nitself was visited by an epidemic fever no less fatal to the population\r\nthan that from which it now suffers.\r\n\r\nFrom the above and other facts, we are firmly convinced that the yellow\r\nfever which now afflicts Brazil is not an _imported_ disease, but owes\r\nits origin to certain obscure atmospheric disturbances, embracing\r\nvariations of temperature, hygrometric influence, electrical tension,\r\natmospheric pressure, &c.; and judging from the previous history of\r\nBrazil, we believe that these unfavourable conditions are but temporary\r\nand will pass away, and that the country will again resume its former\r\ncharacter of unparalleled salubrity amongst the tropical regions of the\r\nglobe.[74]\r\n\r\nPROPHYLACTIC MEASURES.—A few words on the precautions to be adopted by\r\ntemporary as well as permanent residents in Brazil may perhaps prove\r\nuseful. In the first place, all the ordinary hygienic laws should be\r\nattended to; the habitation selected should be in a dry locality,\r\non a moderate elevation, and well ventilated, but at the same time\r\nprotected against strong currents of wind; lengthened or direct exposure\r\nto the sun’s rays should be avoided, and all sudden vicissitudes of\r\ntemperature guarded against. Loose waistcoats without sleeves, of fine\r\nflannel, should be worn next the skin, during the day, but never slept\r\nin; sleeping in the open air or unprotected, should be avoided. After\r\nexposure to rain, the clothes should be immediately changed; after\r\nexhaustion by exercise, or from any other cause, collapse or chill must\r\nbe carefully guarded against, by avoiding for a time exposure to the cool\r\nbreeze or by taking some slight stimulant, as coffee, wine, or a little\r\nspirits. Spirits, otherwise, should be altogether avoided, and wine\r\nresorted to only at dinner, in great moderation, and by those accustomed\r\nto its use. Generally, animal food should be used only at dinner; no\r\nsupper; and no stimulating drinks, _however diluted_, should be taken\r\nbetween meals. Ripe fruit may be used before breakfast, and after the\r\nmiddle of the day, but never after the principal meal. Moderation IN\r\nEVERY SENSE must be observed. When compelled to go out early in the\r\nmorning, the individual should take some support. In warm and swampy\r\ndistricts, over fatigue, or prolonged exposure to the sun, cannot be too\r\ncarefully avoided, and the use of quinine, in moderate doses, should\r\nnever be neglected; the cold bath, or cold sponging, every morning on\r\ngetting out of bed, should be constantly resorted to. The sleeping\r\napartments should be cool and well ventilated, but not exposed to strong\r\ncurrents of air.\r\n\r\nOf all the above principles, refreshing sleep is the most efficient\r\npreservative to the European constitution against the inroads of tropical\r\ndisease; but unless the above rules are pretty closely observed, sound\r\nand refreshing sleep in equatorial latitudes is unattainable. The\r\n_morale_ must never be lost sight of, and a calm and cheerful disposition\r\nof mind should be especially encouraged. The above prophylactic measures\r\napply with equal or greater force to the European seaman on arrival\r\nin Brazil. In addition, awnings by day and by night are absolutely\r\nindispensable to health. Fatigue and dockyard duties, and watering\r\nexpeditions, should never be permitted during the mid-day heat, nor\r\nshould the seaman ever be permitted to sleep out of his vessel. The high\r\nimportance of this latter injunction will be obvious from the fact that a\r\ndifference of _fifty degrees_ will be found often to obtain between the\r\nheat of a mid-day tropical sun and the air near the earth’s surface at\r\nsun-rise. Surely, then, we need not evoke the phantom Malaria to account\r\nfor the sudden supervention of malignant or fatal disease in seamen, or\r\nothers, exposed during sleep to such great and sudden transitions of\r\ntemperature, especially when their animal and organic powers have been\r\ndepressed by previous exertion and profuse perspiration under a tropical\r\nsun, aided, too often, by intemperance and other excesses.\r\n\r\n    Nec Deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus.\r\n\r\nFinally, we are profoundly convinced, by long and large observation,\r\nthat if the foregoing principles are attended to, the most formidable\r\nlocalities of southern climates may be encountered with impunity, and\r\nespecially as regards that dreaded, but visionary enemy, Malaria or marsh\r\npoison.[75]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIO DE LA PLATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sea-like Plata, to whose dread expanse,\r\n    Continuous depth, and wondrous length of course,\r\n    Our floods are rills. With unabated force,\r\n    In silent dignity they sweep along;\r\n    And traverse realms unknown, and blooming wilds,\r\n    And fruitful deserts, worlds of solitude!\r\n    Where the sun smiles and seasons teem in vain,\r\n    Unseen, and unenjoyed. Forsaking these,\r\n    O’er peopled plains they fair-diffusive flow;\r\n    And many a nation feed; and circle safe,\r\n    In their soft bosom, many a happy isle;\r\n    The seat of blameless Pan, yet undisturbed\r\n    By Christian crimes and Europe’s cruel sons.\r\n    Thus pouring on they proudly seek the deep,\r\n    Whose vanquished tide, recoiling from the shock,\r\n    Yields to this liquid weight of half the globe;\r\n    And Ocean trembles for his green domain.\r\n    But what avails this wondrous waste of wealth,\r\n    This gay profusion of luxurious bliss?\r\n    This pomp of Nature? what their balmy meads,\r\n    Their powerful herbs, and Ceres void of pain,\r\n    By vagrant birds dispersed, and wafting winds?\r\n    What their unplanted fruits?

GORE OUSELEY, K.C.B.—LATE HER MAJESTY’S MINISTER\r\nPLENIPOTENTIARY TO THE STATES OF LA PLATA, AND FORMERLY CHARGE D’AFFAIRES\r\nAT THE COURT OF BRAZIL.]\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE PORTRAIT.—The sketch in the preceding page is copied from\r\nan early likeness, but can hardly be considered an accurate one now. In\r\na book of this nature, which owes much of whatever attractiveness it\r\nmay possess to his permission to avail of the pictorial and literary\r\nmemoranda of his prolonged sojourn in South America, and especially in\r\na chapter on the River Plate, in whose affairs he played so important a\r\npart in the chief crisis of its history, full biographical details of Sir\r\nW. Gore Ouseley’s career may reasonably be anticipated. For such purpose,\r\nhowever, the writer has access only to the ordinary data to be found in\r\nworks of public reference; nor, if others of a private nature were open,\r\nwould it, perhaps, be in the best taste to insert them here, as they\r\nwould necessarily be supposed to be used with an unduly partial bias.\r\nWithout entering at length into details more fitted for a genealogical\r\nwork than for our pages, it will suffice to say that, previous to the\r\nsixteenth century, the Ouseley family was allied to several of the most\r\nancient and honourable patrician names of this country, and thus their\r\nancestry can be traced to a remote period. The Irving family, into\r\nwhich the late Sir W. Ouseley (father of Sir W. Gore Ouseley) married,\r\nis allied to the Douglases, the Rollos, and many other noble Scotch\r\nfamilies. Referring to ‘Burke’s Baronetage,’ and ‘Landed Gentry,’ ‘Dod’s\r\nKnightage’ for 1854, and other cognate authorities, we find that Sir W.\r\nG. Ouseley is descended from an ancient Shropshire family who settled in\r\nNorthamptonshire in 1571, the then head of the family, Richard Ouseley\r\nOuseley, having received from Queen Elizabeth, under whom he was a judge,\r\na grant of the estate of Courteen Hall, in that county, with many of\r\nthe most eminent families in which the Ouseleys were connected, such\r\nas the Actons of Alderham, as also the Barons Giffard of Brinsfield,\r\nand Barons Lestrange of Blackmere.[76] Nicholas Ouseley, a relative of\r\nRichard Ouseley Ouseley, was envoy to the courts of Spain and Portugal,\r\nand some of his correspondence with Sir Francis Walsingham is preserved\r\namong the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum. John, son of Richard\r\nOuseley, was knighted by James I. in 1603, for his gallant conduct during\r\nthe war in Ireland with the turbulent Earl of Tyrone. The diplomatic\r\nservices of Sir John are mentioned in a subsequent note, and by Purchas\r\nin his ‘Pilgrims.’ Sir Richard Ouseley, his son, held the commission of\r\nmajor in the royalist army during the civil war between Charles I. and\r\nthe Parliament, and in consequence of debts incurred in support of the\r\nroyal cause he was obliged to sell Courteen Hall in 1650. The family then\r\nsettled in Ireland, where they held Ballinasloe Castle, and afterwards\r\nDunmore Castle, in the county of Galway, which latter remained in the\r\nfamily until the death of Major Ralph Ouseley, grandfather of Sir William\r\nGore Ouseley. The major was a great antiquarian, and had a very fine\r\ncollection of Irish antiquities, MSS., &c. His eldest son, Sir William\r\nOuseley, served in the 8th Dragoons during the unfortunate campaign in\r\nHolland, where the British forces were commanded by the Duke of York;\r\nbut after attaining the rank of major, he abandoned war for the more\r\ncongenial pursuit of literature, and became a member of most of the\r\nlearned and scientific societies of Europe. He published ‘Travels in\r\nPersia,’ (to which country he accompanied his brother, Sir Gore Ouseley,\r\nin 1810,) and many other works on Eastern antiquities and literature, in\r\nwhich he has left a mine of Oriental and classical learning that will\r\nalways remain a monument of his great industry and talent. Sir G. Ouseley\r\nwas the first ambassador accredited from the court of St. James’s to that\r\nof Persia, though Sir Harford Jones, Sir John Malcolm, and others, had\r\npreviously been sent by the East India Company to that country. He was\r\nchairman of the Oriental Translation Society, to whose papers, and those\r\nof the Asiatic Society, he was a contributor. Sir William, who married\r\nthe daughter of the late Lieutenant-Colonel Irving, (son of General Sir\r\nPaulus E. Irving, governor-general of Canada,) left a numerous family,\r\nthe eldest of whom, Sir William Gore Ouseley, entered the diplomatic\r\nservice at a very early age. He was attached to the mission at Stockholm\r\nin 1817, and in 1825 was appointed paid attaché at Washington. While in\r\nthat capital, he married the daughter of Mr. Van Ness, formerly governor\r\nof the state of Vermont, and subsequently the United States envoy at\r\nMadrid. He was next appointed acting secretary of legation at Brussels\r\nduring Sir R. Adair’s special embassy, and subsequently at Rio Janeiro,\r\nat which court he represented our government for several years as chargé\r\nd’affaires. In 1844 Sir William was named minister plenipotentiary at\r\nBuenos Ayres, and in 1845 special minister to the states of La Plata.\r\nIn tardy acknowledgment of his important diplomatic services in South\r\nAmerica, he received the Order of the Bath in 1852. He is the author of\r\n‘Remarks on the Slave Trade,’ ‘South American Sketches,’ and several\r\npolitical pamphlets. We cannot forbear quoting a few lines from a\r\ncritique on his ‘Remarks on the Statistics and Political Institutions\r\nof the United States,’ in the ‘Quarterly Review’ for December, 1832,\r\nwhich, although opposed to the views taken in that periodical of the\r\nUnited States and their institutions, had the fairness to say,—‘We have\r\nno desire to be severely critical on the _coup d’essai_ of a young\r\nauthor—one, we believe, of a family in which diplomatic ability may be\r\ncalled an hereditary possession.’ Some facts in connection with Sir\r\nWilliam’s memorable mission to the River Plate will be found a few pages\r\nfurther on, as also in the notice of Rosas, whose enmity our minister had\r\nthe honour of provoking in an eminent degree, by firmly protecting the\r\npersons and interests of his countrymen, and acting up to the spirit of\r\nhis instructions. How deservedly he did so will be seen when we come to\r\nspeak of one, at least, of those transactions of which the guilt has been\r\nincontestibly fixed upon the ex-Dictator within the last few months, but\r\nfor accusing him of which at the time, our unsuspecting innocents at home\r\ndeemed the British representative very culpable indeed, or, at least,\r\nvery troublesome. Doubtless, so he was, as compared with certain of his\r\npredecessors and successors in the same post, who quietly winked at the\r\natrocities of the despot without appealing to England against their\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMONTE VIDEO.\r\n\r\n    Biographical memoranda on the late British minister to\r\n    the Plate.—First impressions of the Uruguayan capital\r\n    unfavourable.—The New Custom House.—An instance of\r\n    enterprise without prudence.—Commercial advantages of\r\n    Monte Video.—Prosperity obtained at the expense of Buenos\r\n    Ayres.—Revisal of the Buenos Ayrean tariff.—Alluvial deposits\r\n    of the Rio Plata.—Gas from mares’ grease.—Traces of a\r\n    siege.—Unprofitable ploughing by Oribe’s projectiles.—Condition\r\n    of the streets.—The Horses of La Plata, and the Lasso.—Commerce\r\n    of London with Monte Video and Buenos Ayres.—Mules for the\r\n    Australian Gold Diggings.—Diminution of the Customs.—Bitter\r\n    fruits of British and French intervention.—Sir William Gore\r\n    Ouseley and the British Loan.—The Market-place.—Italian\r\n    boatmen.—Encouragement given to foreigners.—Aspect of\r\n    the environs.—The English burial ground.—The latest\r\n    revolution.—Sketch of the History of Monte Video.—Senhor\r\n    Castellanos.—Immigration from Europe.—Abolition of slavery in\r\n    Uruguay.—Formation of agricultural colonies.—Diplomatic and\r\n    consular memoranda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTE VIDEO—CAPITAL OF THE BANDA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY]\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE ILLUSTRATION.—Pursuing the plan adopted in several\r\n    of the preceding chapters, we here follow, in great part, from\r\n    the source drawn upon in the former instances, the description\r\n    given of Monte Video, by the same hand to which we are indebted\r\n    for the illustration. Monte Video, situate in latitude 35\r\n    degrees S., longitude 56 degrees W., is the capital of the\r\n    ‘Banda Oriental’ (eastern shore or banks), or, as it is more\r\n    formally designated, the ‘Republic of the Uruguay;’ it is on\r\n    the left bank of the River Plate, but, in part, is a seaport,\r\n    the river being here above 120 miles across, although this\r\n    capital is about 100 miles from the ocean. Yet even near Monte\r\n    Video, after the prevalence of certain winds, the water is not\r\n    too salt for drinking, in case of necessity; indeed, when off\r\n    the port, were it not for this freshness, the stranger could\r\n    hardly credit he is not still at sea, instead of in a river,\r\n    so immense is it. Monte Video is most advantageously placed\r\n    for commercial purposes. It is not enough to say that Buenos\r\n    Ayres is the capital of the Argentine Provinces, and Monte\r\n    Video that of the Banda Oriental—the extent of territory of\r\n    which latter is small in comparison with the former—for these\r\n    two places are not only the chief ports of entry through which,\r\n    says Parish, the trade of these countries is carried on with\r\n    foreign nations, but it will be found that at whichever of them\r\n    the largest amount of foreign goods is landed, they are for the\r\n    most part destined for the consumption of the people of the\r\n    countries watered by the Rio de la Plata and its tributaries.\r\n    The amount of foreign goods—so greatly out of proportion to\r\n    its population—which, a few years back, was landed at Monte\r\n    Video, is chiefly to be ascribed to the blockade of Buenos\r\n    Ayres, which temporarily diverted the trade from its ordinary\r\n    course. Whenever Buenos Ayres has the misfortune to be so\r\n    attacked, the advantageous situation of Monte Video, as a\r\n    central port, will always give it importance as an entrepot for\r\n    goods destined for the provinces in the interior. This was the\r\n    case in a remarkable degree during the late beleaguerment of\r\n    Buenos Ayres, by Urquiza, until the admiral of his fleet, the\r\n    North American adventurer Coe, went over to the authorities of\r\n    the City. During the whole of this time, Monte Video, being the\r\n    only open port, prospered immensely in the amount of shipping\r\n    entering it. There is no doubt, also, that its situation offers\r\n    facilities for the supply at all times by indirect means\r\n    of the adjoining provinces of Brazil and of the Argentine\r\n    Confederation, of which the Monte Videans will probably avail\r\n    themselves, to the detriment of their neighbours’ interests,\r\n    unless, in self-defence, the latter so regulate their customs\r\n    duties as to countervail all temptations to avoid them. Now\r\n    this the Buenos Ayreans are wisely doing; for before the\r\n    close of the past year (1853) they effected an important\r\n    modification in their tariff, which, coupled with the opening\r\n    of the great internal streams, is sure to be productive of\r\n    infinite advantage.[77] The harbour at Monte Video, except\r\n    during certain winds and violent gales, is good, and the river\r\n    basin well sheltered. But the vast body of fresh water of the\r\n    River Plate brings with it, especially after floods, immense\r\n    quantities of earth, sand, &c., forming continual deposits,\r\n    gradually filling up this and other harbours in La Plata, and\r\n    diminishing the depth of water in many places. For instance,\r\n    in the harbour of Monte Video—the best in the river—formerly\r\n    large vessels of war, then called frigates (during the Spanish\r\n    colonial government), used to lie quite close to the wharves in\r\n    the inner part of the harbour, where none but merchant vessels,\r\n    and those not of the largest size, now find sufficient depth.\r\n    This gradual accumulation of alluvial deposit might easily be\r\n    prevented in the harbour by the use of excavating and dredging\r\n    machines. They were, in fact, successfully tried some years\r\n    ago, but the invasion of the country and the late siege of its\r\n    capital, which lasted above nine years, forced the government\r\n    to employ all its resources in self-defence, and this, like\r\n    many other useful measures, was suspended, but will be again\r\n    resumed speedily, as also many other essential improvements\r\n    prosecuted with vigour, now that the prospects of peace are\r\n    assured, from the determination of the whole bulk of the\r\n    population to abstain from siding with any of the disturbers of\r\n    tranquillity. Lighthouses have been erected at the entrance of\r\n    the river; its most dangerous parts are buoyed, and licensed\r\n    pilots ply off its mouth to take vessels either into the\r\n    harbour of Monte Video, or up to Buenos Ayres. With their help,\r\n    and the excellent charts and sailing directions that have been\r\n    published, the navigation, which would otherwise be difficult,\r\n    on account of sand-banks, is made tolerably safe for the vast\r\n    number of merchant vessels which are continually on their\r\n    passage up and down the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impression on landing here is unfavourable, or at least, was so when\r\nI visited it, though such is the rapidity of change in South American\r\nregions, that, I believe, matters have put on a very much improved aspect\r\nwithin the short period that has since elapsed. At that time, at all\r\nevents, the place was very dirty, from rainy weather; ill-paved streets;\r\ngreat confusion with carts and horses; all kinds of queer-looking beings\r\nabout; and a medley of nations, remarkable even in this focus of motley\r\nemigration. Things looked in a rough, unfinished state, such as you would\r\nhardly expect to find in the second important city of the La Plata; and\r\nthe reality contrasted sadly with the gay houses, their fantastic turrets\r\nand look-outs, which present such a picturesque appearance from the sea.\r\nThe poverty the place displays is too fully accounted for by the many\r\nyears of siege, blockade, civil war, and disaster it has gone through,\r\nrendering it almost miraculous that so much should still exist in the\r\nshape of a city. You land at the ponte, or custom-house wharf, built out\r\na short distance into the bay, whilst the custom-house itself is in a\r\nstreet some little distance off. On the right, near the entrance of the\r\nharbour, is the new custom-house, an immense pile, which, when finished,\r\nmust prove a great convenience to commerce, so long as the latter is\r\nmade to go through the ordeal of fiscal duties, which here comprise\r\nnearly the entire revenue of the state. Close to the new custom-house is\r\na light-looking jetty, made chiefly of iron, with a good landing-place,\r\nand rails running along the wharf to bonded warehouses on shore. This\r\nwharf or pier was the work of an enterprising Englishman, who had more\r\npublic spirit than prudence, and was unsuccessful in his views, owing\r\npartly to there not being sufficient water to enable vessels to come\r\nalongside the structure. The city of Monte Video is erected on a kind\r\nof promontory, running out into the sea, which washes one side, and the\r\nbay the other. Like most Spanish towns in South America, it is built\r\nin squares, with parallel streets, the houses all shapes and sizes,\r\nwith square courts, from which you enter the different suites of rooms,\r\nmany very handsomely arranged and furnished, the area of the court being\r\nadorned with plants and flowers. Since the siege was raised, parts of\r\nthe old fortifications have been pulled down, and new streets are in\r\nprocess of building, as also a new theatre; so that with a continuance\r\nof peace, Monte Video would soon assume more importance, and many of\r\nits civic defects be remedied. Some spirited individuals have got up\r\na gas company, and the town is now excellently lighted from a local\r\ncommodity called mares’ grease, and certainly a clearer or better light\r\nI never saw anywhere. Country houses are also springing up since the\r\ndesolation in which the outskirts were left by the nine years’ siege at\r\nthe hands of Rosas and his creatures, of which it still bears the traces\r\nin all directions, particularly at that memorable point between the city\r\nand General Oribe’s camp at Cerrito, where every house was riddled or\r\ndestroyed with cannon-shot, and the very ground ploughed up by the same\r\nunproductive metal. In a large square, at the extremity of the town,\r\nstands the cathedral, a huge unfinished building, which towers above\r\neverything else, and is emblematic of the old Spanish taste in churches.\r\nThis square will be an acquisition when finished and put in order,\r\nplanted with trees, &c., towards which there is already some movement;\r\nbut the majority of the streets are scarcely passable in a conveyance,\r\nmany being without any pavement at all, a few rough stones being here and\r\nthere visible; the rest is a compound of mud and filth, and with holes\r\nthat would astonish any well-educated European animal, however profound\r\nhis gravity or elongated his ears, but apparently quite natural to the\r\nhorses and mules of this country, and regarded by them with an exemplary\r\nequanimity which bipeds of philosophic pretensions in vain endeavour to\r\nemulate.\r\n\r\nThe difference of race between the inhabitants of Brazil and the River\r\nPlate is very remarkable, indicating at once the great change in climate,\r\nand those other physiological influences that contribute to determine\r\nvariety of character among people. At the same time it must be observed\r\nthat South America furnishes many almost irreconcilable anomalies of\r\nthis kind; for instance, a feeble and peaceful people dwelt on the cold\r\nmountains of Peru; a hardy and warlike race wandered under the burning\r\nsun of Brazil. The Uruguayans partake largely of the attributes of the\r\nlatter. The natives are generally athletic-looking men, mounted on horses\r\nthat appear part and parcel of themselves; seemingly centaur-like,\r\n‘demi-encorpsed with the brave beast;’ and dressed in a fashion savouring\r\nstrongly of the Turk—minus the turban.\r\n\r\n    And tall, and strong, and swift of foot are they,\r\n    Beyond the dwarfing city’s pale abortions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EL LAZO—THROWING THE LASSO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA VACA ESTRAVIADA—THE STRAY COW.]\r\n\r\nThe Plata is indeed the land of the horse, _par excellence_, as will\r\nbe inferred from the fact of this, the first town of importance on its\r\nbanks, being lighted with mares’-grease gas. The animals are, generally\r\nspeaking, described by connoisseurs as not exactly equalling the splendid\r\nSpanish parent stock they are descended from, and the first appearance\r\nof which in the country where they are now counted by millions, and\r\nare part almost of the very being of the natives, was regarded with\r\nan awe and astonishment that well nigh paralysed resistance to the\r\ninvader. Those that swarm along the plains are rather more useful\r\nthan handsome; heads not clumsy, though not elegantly shaped; body\r\ntolerably round, though croup often low; legs, though light, firm and\r\nwell placed. They are caught with the lasso, in the use of which, as\r\nlikewise of course in the bolas, the Uruguayan Guacho is fully equal,\r\nand is deemed by many even superior, if possible, to his brother of\r\nthe Buenos Ayrean pampas, with which the European idea of the exercise\r\nof these captivating implements is chiefly associated; for the Banda\r\nOriental being much intersected with streams, and trees, and hills, a\r\ngreater degree of address is perhaps required in managing a herd of wild\r\nhorses or oxen than in the vast table-land stretching, for hundreds upon\r\nhundreds of miles, in an almost unvaried flat, on the opposite bank of\r\nthe river. But if the Plate be the land of horses, doubly is it the\r\nland of cows: the whole region may be said to be one vast horn-and-hoof\r\nfair; and the predominant bovine element in the air, the street, the\r\nfield, proclaims itself overpoweringly to every sense. This, of course,\r\nstrikes one more forcibly, because of its novelty, on landing at Monte\r\nVideo, than subsequently at Buenos Ayres, and in the interior; for it is\r\nextraordinary how quickly one loses his fastidiousness, and looks with\r\nindifference upon sights, and inhales odours, that appear insufferably\r\nrevolting at the outset of one’s noviciate. The trade carried on by\r\nthe Uruguayans in the flesh, and hides, and tallow, of cattle, and the\r\nskins of horses, is very great,[78] considering the extent of territory\r\nand population, and bearing in mind the many impediments of which we\r\nhave already spoken, and to which we shall have further to advert\r\npresently. Latterly, a profitable trade is springing up in the article\r\nof mules for Australia; those animals being reared in great perfection\r\nin the fine pastures of the Banda Oriental, and being of infinite use\r\nin the gold fields, owing to their hardy constitution, strength, and\r\ndocility. Passengers from Australia, calling at Monte Video, declare the\r\nneighbourhood greatly to resemble the vicinage of Melbourne; and there\r\nis little doubt that judicious explorations would reveal the presence\r\nof large quantities of gold, some having already been found. That the\r\nwhole state abounds in metalliferous riches is the conviction of many\r\ncompetent judges; and, probably, in no part of the civilised world might\r\nsmall mining capitals be invested with greater certainty of success, or\r\nsmall ‘captains’ commence operations on their own account with stronger\r\nassurance of reward, especially as the climate, a most important\r\nconsideration, admits of Englishmen pursuing their labours without the\r\nenervation experienced from the greater heat and drying winds that\r\nprevail on the opposite side of the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAMBO A REAL EL VASO—MILK AT A RIAL A GLASS.]\r\n\r\nTo judge from the number of vessels and small craft laying in the\r\nharbour, you would conclude a large trade was carried on; but such is not\r\nexactly the case, although matters are fast improving; the custom-house\r\nrevenue, from being down to 700,000 dollars, is now doubled, or 1,400,000\r\ndollars, against 3½ millions of dollars which it returned in 1842,\r\nprevious to the siege. The work of destruction was industriously pursued\r\nduring that disastrous period, and for hundreds of miles the Banda\r\nOriental was not only shorn of its cattle but of its population. The\r\nland, in fact, was rendered a desert waste, and made only subservient\r\nto the wants of Oribe’s army. Future annalists will hardly believe it\r\npossible that the history of a second Troy could be illustrated in the\r\nduration of the aggression it was subjected to, under the protective\r\ncannon of the two most powerful nations of Europe, France and England;\r\nbut such, alas! was the fact; and the recent melancholy position of Monte\r\nVideo is the fruit of an intervention that was not rendered effective,\r\nas it might have been, if vigorously followed up in conformity with the\r\njudicious advice of the resident English minister during a great part\r\nof the troubles, and whose wise suggestions are now reverted to with\r\nregretful but admiring respect, by all dispassionate men in Europe or\r\nAmerica who have read the then requirements of the Plate by the light\r\nof subsequent experience.[79] Indeed, that this feeling has at length\r\nprevailed is shown by acts, more of justice than of favour, on the\r\npart of succeeding governments that, though tardy, are not the less\r\nhonourable to those concerned. It will require many years of peaceful\r\nindustry to restore this district to what it was in 1842, rich as the\r\nsoil undoubtedly is, and reproductive as its affluence in cattle may\r\nbe. In the meantime, a good deal of produce is brought hither from the\r\nneighbouring ports and down the rivers, in small craft, which occupy a\r\nlong time on the voyage; and some idea may be formed of the number of\r\nthese conveyances, when I mention having seen one as high as No. 1,200 at\r\nBuenos Ayres, where they are all numbered, and, it is to be presumed,\r\nat Monte Video likewise. It is hardly necessary to say that there is a\r\nstrong rivalry between the two ports for this kind of trade, and also in\r\nnumerous other respects; but Monte Video has immeasurably the advantage\r\nas a harbour, and it might be rendered as commodious as any in the world\r\nby a little energy and judicious outlay. It is much to be regretted\r\nthat this peaceful rivalry should not be the predominant incentive to\r\nmercantile action, instead of each country wasting its strength and\r\nenergies in interminable political squabbles. But both have paid so\r\nbitterly for the indulgence of these internecine animosities, that they\r\nare at length beginning to learn charity and reciprocal indulgence of\r\neach other’s foibles; and there is a reasonable probability that this\r\nmutual comparative toleration is the precursor of joint stability of\r\ninstitutions, and of that solid and progressive prosperity of which each\r\nis so eminently capable. A most remarkable evidence of the growth of this\r\nbetter spirit was afforded on the occasion of some disturbances in the\r\nBanda Oriental, at the close of last year, when the authorities at Buenos\r\nAyres actually offered to place their vessels of war at the disposal\r\nof the Uruguayan authorities, for the maintenance of peace and order.\r\nThis the latter were fortunately able to preserve without extraneous\r\naid; the proffer of which, from such a quarter, augurs the advent of\r\nan era when peace as well as plenty shall take up its abiding place in\r\nthese luxuriant regions, from which it seems to have fled from the hour\r\nthe white man set foot upon the soil. But the good time, so ardently\r\ndesiderated, is not yet exactly arrived; for such is the fluctuating\r\ncondition of things in these countries, that almost every alternate mail\r\nbrings accounts that upset all one’s previous calculations, and hardly\r\nis the ink dry with which we record our felicitations on the seeming\r\nsolidity of peace, when tidings of civil broils once more open the door\r\nof incertitude as to the present, and the worst apprehensions as to the\r\nfuture. But Brazil is now the great peace-maker, and, as long as she is\r\nso, outrage at least is impossible.\r\n\r\nOne of the old defences of Monte Video is a Spanish wall, of which only\r\na portion remains, with a Moorish-looking gateway, which has a very\r\npicturesque air about it, contrasting with the modern appearance of the\r\nhouses near it. Through the gateway is visible a large quadrangular\r\nbuilding, apparently used as a barrack in former times, but now\r\nappropriated to a much more useful purpose, that of a public market;\r\nand early in the morning may be seen dozens of people going to and fro\r\nwith their purchases for the day—meat, fish, and fine vegetables. The\r\nlatter appear to be in profusion; and some cauliflowers were far the\r\nlargest I ever saw. Things of this sort are dear, owing to the limited\r\ncultivation, which is carried on chiefly by the Basque population,\r\nwhilst the boatmen who ply for hire about the port are Italians to a\r\nman.[80] Some idea may be formed of the scarcity of labourers, when the\r\ncommonest cannot be got on board ship for less than 2 dollars each (eight\r\nshillings) per day, and this must be a great drawback to the progress of\r\nthe place; otherwise, what may be seen of the soil, even close to the\r\nwalls of Monte Video, proves that anything could be grown there under\r\nproper cultivation. Hedges of immense aloes, cactus, clover, and other\r\nspontaneous vegetation, are everywhere visible; whilst near the edge of\r\nthe bay there is splendid granite rock, in any quantity, for building\r\npurposes and paving the streets. True, you see no trees about, as they\r\nwere all levelled for firewood, &c.; but that the soil close to the town\r\ncan grow thousands of them, there cannot be the shadow of a doubt, and\r\nthe territory of the Uruguay itself, in many parts, is famous for its\r\ntimbered affluence. The citizens are now planting some trees, and with\r\npeace for a few years, the outskirts of Monte Video would present a very\r\ndifferent appearance indeed to what they do at present. The walls of the\r\nEnglish burial-ground were also levelled during the siege; and there is\r\nnow only a hedge of aloes, which does not hide even the tombstones. Owing\r\nto that and other circumstances, there is some talk of the site being\r\nremoved. Before our arrival, a revolution, attended with some bloodshed,\r\nhad again broken out, and things appeared in a very unsettled state,\r\nfinally coming to a head by a total upset of the then existing president,\r\nGiro, and his foreign minister, Berro, who took refuge in a French vessel\r\nof war.[81] A provisional government was soon formed, which certainly\r\nseemed to carry with it the sympathies of the people, who, it is to be\r\nhoped, will settle down again quietly—a consummation to which everything\r\nthat has happened, as far as is known in Europe, since our departure,\r\nwould seem to be steadily tending. Hitherto, as is notorious to every\r\none, the great curse of these countries is personal ambition; for no man\r\nconsiders it necessary to consult the interests of his fellow-citizens\r\nbeyond what will serve his own purpose. Such a principle as that of true\r\npatriotism, or dispensing legislation for the good of the many, was a\r\nmere chimera, and no wonder the masses should at length kick against a\r\nsystem by which they are always sufferers.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, a most marked change in this respect has recently\r\noccurred. The love of anarchic excitement has well nigh subsided, even\r\namongst the most volatile and hitherto inflammable portion of the\r\npopulation; while the sentiment conveyed in the Shakspearean malison,\r\n‘A plague on both your houses,’ is that uppermost in the mouths of the\r\nreally intelligent and respectable classes of every way of thinking,\r\nwhen appealed to by contending chiefs, panting for public embroilment\r\nfor the sake of personal aggrandisement. A most striking, and, it is to\r\nbe hoped, conclusive, evidence of this was furnished in the case of the\r\nrecent ejection of the President Giro, or, rather, his own renunciation\r\nof office and attempted exercise of its functions afterwards; for, rather\r\nthan join any standard, at least any that involved the disruption of\r\nthe public peace, certain classes, who had hitherto been at the beck\r\nof every incendiary in turn, actually fled into the country and hid\r\nthemselves, for fear of being compelled to participate in scenes they\r\nhad previously so often rejoiced to riot in. The adherents of the Giro\r\ngovernment have since made an attempt to seize upon the power they have\r\nso capriciously abandoned, and succeeded in producing some confusion for\r\na while, especially at Colonia, whence the authorities had to fly in a\r\nwhale-boat to Buenos Ayres; but the provisional executive, strong in the\r\npacific disposition of the whole people, as already adverted to, quickly\r\nsucceeded in restoring order, and maintained it with firmness and temper,\r\ntill Brazil has insured enduring peace.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the overthrow or dissolution of the recent government of\r\nPresident Giro, it may be necessary to state, in justice to a deserving\r\nand distinguished public servant, Sen. Don F. Castellanos, that he had\r\nno hand whatever in the circumstances which led to that occurrence,\r\nhaving many months before resigned the office of Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, the duties of which he discharged with exemplary assiduity,\r\nability, and success, under the exceedingly difficult obligations imposed\r\nupon the State of the Uruguay, subsequent to the siege being suddenly\r\nraised by the defeat and flight of Rosas. M. Castellanos, whose personal\r\nacquaintance I had the honour of making, is a gentleman of European as\r\nwell as American repute, being well versed in the constitutional laws\r\nof the New World, and familiar with the institutions and literature of\r\nthe old, speaking French and English with facility and correctness.\r\nDuring his administration everything possible was done to supply\r\nthat great desideratum of the Uruguay and of all the South American\r\nstates—immigration from Europe. To this end Senr. Castellanos, shortly\r\nafter he accepted office, addressed a despatch to the Consul-General for\r\nthe Republic of the Uruguay in London, commanding him to make known to\r\nall whom it might concern, that the whole of the fertile territory of\r\nthe Banda Oriental was in a condition of perfect tranquillity, in which\r\nit has virtually since remained, notwithstanding the sudden cessation\r\nsince of the government of which he was at the time the Foreign Minister.\r\nHe stated that the authorities were anxious to receive any number of\r\npeaceable, well-disposed European emigrants, to whose industry they were\r\nprepared to guarantee all the protection extended to native citizens,\r\ntogether with peculiar exemptions because of their introduction of skill\r\nand capital. Complete toleration in all matters of religious observance\r\nwas insured; and, in a word, every inducement held out to the redundant\r\npopulation of the Old World to avail itself of the fruitful soil and\r\ngenial climate of a constitutionally governed country, admirably adapted\r\nin every respect to Europeans of the Saxon and German stock, the climate\r\nbeing temperate and healthy in an eminent degree, and its numerous\r\nrivers, extensive sea-coast, and noble harbours, affording every facility\r\nfor commerce. In the present condition of our Russian trade in tallow,\r\nfor whose production this region has unlimited capabilities, as it has\r\nfor another staple—cotton—whose supply is by no means encouragingly\r\n‘looming in the future,’ the announcement here made is likely to have\r\nthe effect of directing towards the La Plata a considerable stream\r\nof emigration, which circumstances of various kinds—moral, sanative,\r\nand social—may repel from quarters more alluring to the inconsiderate\r\nmillions. Indeed, we understand that a formidable ‘exodus,’ as the\r\nphrase is, may be looked for shortly from the Rhenish provinces on the\r\nSwiss border, to the Banda Oriental; and that an organization on a very\r\nlarge scale is being matured for colonizing with Germans several hundred\r\nthousand acres of the beautiful undulating tract on the borders of the\r\nRivers Arapey Grande, Arapey Chico, and the Curaeim. There is no doubt\r\nthat the causes which attract the industry and energy of the prudent\r\nGermans in this marked manner will also draw a great number of English\r\nagricultural settlers to the neighbourhood of a city in which so much\r\nEnglish capital and enterprise are being commercially employed as in\r\nMonte Video; and a very potent stimulus to the wishes of the Uruguayan\r\ngovernment in this respect must be afforded by the new Liverpool line of\r\nsteamers, running monthly to Brazil and the Plata, under circumstances\r\nvery different from those that formerly characterised the Anglo steam\r\ncommunication with that part of South America.\r\n\r\nSome twelve years since, slavery was abolished in the territory of the\r\nRepublic. Many hands, then obliged to devote themselves to tillage,\r\nabandoned it in order to occupy themselves in some other branches of\r\nindustry which appeared to them more lucrative. Agriculture, which\r\neven then was not engaged in to any great extent, felt the blow; but\r\nwhat appeared fatal to it was converted into a benefit. For slaves was\r\nsubstituted free labour, because the government at once comprehended\r\nthe necessity of favouring, by all possible means, the principal branch\r\nof industry which supports states; and agriculture, instead of dwindling\r\naway, comparatively flourished. The abandonment of the most fertile\r\nplains, and the prices of their produce, encouraged strangers to come\r\nto cultivate them; and not only did agriculture gain in extent, but the\r\nsoil likewise in production, which was doubled by industry. Attracted\r\nby the certainty of profit, and encouraged by the government, the\r\nemigration to the Uruguay was daily increased, and vessels, loaded with\r\n200 to 300 emigrants, continually arrived at Monte Video. More than one\r\ncompany has been formed, in order, in conjunction with the government, to\r\npromote emigration to the interior of the country and its colonization.\r\nOne, under the name of ‘Pastoral and Agricultural Company of Merinos,’\r\n(Sociedade Agricola Pastoral de Merinos) is establishing a colony near\r\nthe village of Carmelo, to which it destines a large tract of land.\r\nIn its centre will be formed a city, under the name of Pueblo de la\r\nEstrella; and the same colony will have a normal school of agriculture,\r\nand a garden of acclimatization and practical essays of this science. On\r\nthe banks of the Uruguay, an agricultural colony of European families\r\nof the same class is also being established. In the same manner a town\r\nwill be constructed there, the plan of which is being formed. Another\r\nagricultural society of the colony has promoted an association among the\r\ninhabitants of the city of Colonia, for the colonization of the country.\r\nSome time ago it issued the greater portion of its shares, and, as I\r\nlearned, intended to import from the Canary Islands 50 agricultural\r\nfamilies, of four persons each, to whom to distribute lands, seeds,\r\ninstruments, &c. In the department of Soriano, other societies intend to\r\nintroduce 800 to 1,000 European families, who are to devote themselves to\r\nagriculture; lastly, the necessity for the encouragement of colonization\r\nis everywhere recognized, and its promotion is sought in every possible\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThese and many other schemes of a somewhat similar kind are yet a very\r\nlong way indeed from fruition; and some considerable time must elapse\r\nbefore they can be anything but dreams. Doubtless the disturbed state of\r\nEurope will lend a great impetus to the immigration we have spoken of,\r\nand the mere talk of the improvements we adverted to bespeaks a yearning\r\nafter social good that must ultimately realize its own object. For one\r\nwho knows the people well, says:—\r\n\r\n    Of natural or unschooled talent there is a great deal there. A\r\n    vivacious imagination is almost universal in the inhabitants;\r\n    and in the fine language which they possess, they express\r\n    themselves with a fluency, if not an eloquence, at which we\r\n    seldom aim, and to which we much seldomer attain. This facility\r\n    has grown out of their tertulia, or conversazione habits.\r\n    Among the lawyers, the constant practice of dictating to an\r\n    amanuensis, the definitions, reasonings, and refutations in the\r\n    various cases in which they are retained, enable them often to\r\n    write, and to write with fluency and elegance, upon subjects,\r\n    the theory and bearing of which they study for the occasion. Of\r\n    course all such writings are more plausible than profound, more\r\n    replete with declamation than sound reasoning. The imagination\r\n    of the South American is constantly at work; and unconsciously,\r\n    perhaps, he is ever showing forth, among his countrymen, things\r\n    as they ought to be, not as they are. When we hear him descant,\r\n    in glowing and eloquent terms on civil liberty, freedom of the\r\n    press, liberal education, privileges of the constitution, we\r\n    fancy there must be a tolerably good foundation laid of all\r\n    these blessings before so much could be said about them.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads me to speak of social life in Monte Video, which,\r\nas far as I had an opportunity of judging, is frank, cordial, and\r\nagreeable, there being a much greater admixture of the citizens with\r\nforeigners, and especially with English, than I observed at Lisbon,\r\nand than I know exists in Brazil. English society in itself is also\r\nmuch more extensive than I could have well believed, and is of a very\r\nsuperior order—refined, intelligent, and hospitable. There is full\r\nfreedom for religious worship of every kind; and Mr. Samuel Lafone,\r\nof the firm of Lafone Brothers, of Monte Video and Liverpool—a name\r\npreëminent in British trade with the Plate—having, at the expense of\r\nseveral thousand pounds, constructed a handsome and commodious church\r\nfor the use of his Protestant fellow-countrymen, presented it, and the\r\nground on which it stands (convenient to the anchorage for men-of-war),\r\nto them in perpetuity, without the slightest reserve or expectancy of\r\nremuneration, save the reward conveyed by the consciousness of having\r\ndone a noble act, for the best of purposes, and with the purest motives.\r\nThere are also considerable numbers of British mechanics in Monte\r\nVideo, and agriculturists and shepherds in the Republic, the climate\r\nbeing humid, temperate, and bracing, like our own. The Uruguay adjoins\r\nthat fine healthy province of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, to which some\r\nhundreds of Irish emigrants, more especially from the Barony Forth, in\r\nthe county of Wexford—admirable specimens indeed of ‘the finest peasantry\r\nin the world’—have proceeded, within the last few years, from Liverpool,\r\nunder the auspices of Admiral Grenfell, the Brazilian Consul-General at\r\nthat port; and all the accounts they have hitherto sent home, whether\r\nby themselves, or the pastor who accompanied them, the Rev. R. Walsh,\r\nrepresent their circumstances and situation as prosperous and happy, an\r\nadmirable loamy land being obtainable, in an unlimited quantity, at a\r\ndollar an acre. Some Anglo-South American houses also have a good many\r\nWelch on their properties in the same province, and their reports are all\r\nto the like effect. At still cheaper rates may yet finer land, and in a\r\nstill better climate, be obtained in the Uruguay; and from all I have\r\nbeen able to see, hear, or read, I am inclined to believe that there is\r\nno more eligible spot in the world for an intending emigrant than the\r\nBanda Oriental, whether capitalist or labourer, whether an agriculturist,\r\na grazier, a wool grower, or even a cotton grower, a horse or cattle\r\nbreeder, or one skilled in the preparation of hides, horns, or tallow\r\nfor the home market; or whether he be a rural mechanic or farm servant,\r\nor small yeoman desirous of bringing up a family in any or every branch\r\nof husbandry. On all subjects connected with agricultural pursuits in\r\nthis region of the world, but more especially as regards the breeding of\r\nhorses, cattle, and sheep, and their preparation for the several markets\r\nthey are suited to, the excellent work of Mr. M’Cann (‘Two Thousand\r\nMiles’ Ride through the Argentine Provinces’), may with great confidence\r\nbe recommended, as furnishing on these points a mass of information\r\nnowhere else to be found, and valuable especially as being the result\r\nof the author’s actual experience. My own observations were naturally\r\nconfined to the capital and its immediate vicinity; and my opinion,\r\ntherefore, on such extensive matters as those embraced by Mr M’Cann would\r\nbe of about the same value as those of a Cockney who should pronounce\r\non the territorial condition of England from a Sunday afternoon’s\r\ncontemplation of a suburban tea-garden. And, speaking somewhat in the\r\nlatter sense, I should say that the neighbourhood of Monte Video would\r\nbe pronounced by the sentimental gentleman in Pickwick to be the very\r\nparadise of market gardeners, with or without gazelles, as the case might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe mention of gazelles is naturally suggestive of some remarks about\r\ncertain other and biped proprietors of _beaux yeux_; but we must reserve\r\nsuch matters for the next chapter, merely premising that the observations\r\ntherein offered are in every respect perfectly applicable to the fair\r\nMonte-Videans, who are, indeed, even fairer, or at least less embrowned,\r\nthan the Buenos Ayrean belles, being, if possible, more distinctive\r\ntypes of Spanish beauty, or what used to be such; for according to the\r\nrecent[82] pronunciamento of a most competent and accomplished critic,\r\nthe syrens of Southern Europe are no such great charmers after all—an\r\nassurance that must be consolatory to the British mammas of young\r\nHopefuls quartered at Gibraltar. But, be that as it may, few of the\r\nworser half of humanity will question the right of the Transatlantic\r\ndescendants of Castillian dames to the suzerainty of all beholders,\r\nespecially when to the Moresque complexion is added that distinctive\r\noptic attribute of the Goth which the Celts so much admire, as shown in\r\nthe familiar Portuguese ditty:—\r\n\r\n    Olhos pardos e negros\r\n    Sao os commues;\r\n    Mais os do minha amante\r\n    Deos fez azues.\r\n\r\n    Black eyes and brown\r\n    You may every day see;\r\n    But blue like my lover’s\r\n    The gods made for me.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to fortify my own opinion of the attractions and\r\nconveniences of Monte Video by the very competent authority of Mr.\r\nL. Hugh de Bonelli, secretary to Her Britannic Majesty’s legation in\r\nBolivia, who, in a very interesting couple of volumes, published by\r\nMessrs. Hurst and Blackett, in the course of last month, (February,\r\n1854,) entitled ‘Travels in Bolivia, with a Tour across the Pampas to\r\nBuenos Ayres, &c.,’ expresses himself infinitely pleased with the place;\r\nand his description is so felicitous that I venture to append it in a\r\nnote.[83]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IDA A MISA—GOING TO MASS.]\r\n\r\nSince these remarks were written, the news from the Uruguay continues\r\nto be of so conclusive a character as to give every assurance that this\r\nfine country has really at last entered upon the prosperous destiny\r\nits great natural advantages so clearly point to, provided only peace\r\nwere ensured. That peace will henceforth be preserved is now certain,\r\nand consequently we may calculate on ordinary events following ordinary\r\ncauses, as in all other parts of the world. By the common consent of the\r\nmoderate and intelligent of all classes in the Banda Oriental, Brazil\r\nhas been solicited to assume the protectorate of the Republic. This high\r\nand responsible trust she has undertaken in the spirit of magnanimity\r\nand disinterestedness that will be inferred from the perusal of our\r\nobservations towards the close of the chapter on Rio Janeiro. As there\r\nstated, Brazil has no acquisitive designs on Uruguayan territory; but\r\nshe has a design and determination to keep peace in that state for\r\nthe sake of having a quiet neighbour on her own important southern\r\nfrontier, irrespective of her natural anxiety for the advancement of\r\nso important a portion of the South American east coast as has Monte\r\nVideo for its capital. She has not interfered, nor does she intend to\r\ninterfere, with the internal or domestic affairs of the Republic in\r\nany way, further than securing the inhabitants the exercise of the\r\nright to elect their own rulers, and securing to those so elected the\r\nright of peaceably discharging their functions without the perpetual\r\nmolestations which the armed violence of military adventurers have\r\nfor so many years entailed upon all administrations in succession. As\r\nthe most essential preliminary to quietude, Brazil has undertaken to\r\nremove one source of ever-irritating provocation and confusion from\r\nthe Uruguay, by subsidizing the government to pay what is necessary to\r\ncarry on its affairs properly and efficiently, without those pecuniary\r\nimpediments that have so frequently paralysed every administration in\r\nturn; but Brazil has insisted that the fiscal resources of the Republic\r\nshall not be squandered in the mere process of collection, as has been\r\nthe case hitherto. Brazil, in fact, occupies the position of a police,\r\nwho has only the one object to prevent outrage, compel the observance of\r\nhonesty, and ensure obedience not to _her_ arbitrary edicts or capricious\r\nordinances, but to the recognized laws of the country itself. It is\r\nneedless to say that if the native Orientals are delighted at this stable\r\nstate of things following on the anarchy that had become almost chronic,\r\nstill more so are the foreigners, who constitute so large a portion of\r\nthe wealthy and influential trading inhabitants of the capital, and of\r\nthe landed proprietary. Some suspicions have been expressed that Brazil\r\nwould convert her present position to the frustration of the liberal\r\ncommercial policy lately established between some of the adjoining\r\nSouth American states and Europe, and that Paraguay may be relegated to\r\nher former isolation once more in consequence. But nothing can be more\r\nunfounded than such apprehension; for, apart from its being the obvious\r\ninterest of Brazil to bring all portions of the continent of which she\r\nforms so important a section into commercial contiguity with the old\r\nworld, the former treaties between the Banda Oriental and England and\r\nFrance and Sardinia, and the new ones between those latter countries and\r\nParaguay would necessarily demand an intervention from which Brazil would\r\nintuitively shrink; and, moreover, the United States of North America\r\nwould immediately resent any obstructions that should impede the course\r\nof events which she evidently contemplates by despatching a diplomatic\r\nand consular representative to Paraguay. Altogether, then, there is\r\nevery reason to believe that the good offices of Brazil will prove of\r\ninestimable benefit to the Uruguay, and that that Republic and England\r\nwill alike find in such offices the best auxiliary to the mutually\r\nbeneficial interests between the two countries.[84]\r\n\r\nIn Monte Video, accommodation for travellers is naturally very limited,\r\nprincipally owing to the disorganized state of the city for so many\r\nyears. Still, there are some tolerably good hotels, and a fair number of\r\ncafés and restaurants. At Buenos Ayres hotels are numerous, and so far as\r\nmy experience extended, the charges are by no means extravagant, as will\r\nbe sufficiently proved by a perusal of my bill of costs presented to me\r\non leaving the Hotel de Paris, where I remained some ten days, retaining\r\nmy apartments, though absent up the river nearly half the time:—\r\n\r\n                              Paper dollars.\r\n\r\n    Bedroom and sitting-room        210\r\n    Breakfasts                       20\r\n    Dinners and wine                130\r\n    Lights                           11\r\n                                   ----\r\n                                    370\r\n    Waiters and chambermaid          50\r\n                                   ----\r\n                                    420\r\n                                   ----\r\n                            Or about 5 guineas.\r\n\r\nThere are also plenty of good lodging and boarding-houses, several of\r\nthem kept by English and other foreign residents; and the increase to\r\nthis kind of accommodation appears to be only limited by the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nBUENOS AYRES.\r\n\r\n    Departure from Monte Video.—Moonlight on the La\r\n    Plata.—Deficiency of landing accommodation at Buenos\r\n    Ayres.—Streets and buildings of the Argentine capital.—The\r\n    climate and the people.—Prohibition of the slave\r\n    trade.—General Whitelock, the Calle de Defensa, and Colonel\r\n    Thompson.—Expedition against Monte Video.—Palermo, the country\r\n    residence of General Rosas.—Characters of the dictator\r\n    and his successor, Urquiza.—Donna Manueleta.—Argentine\r\n    confederation.—Government of General Rosas.—War on the Plata\r\n    and the Parana.—Foreign intervention and capture of Rosas’\r\n    fleet.—Blockade of Buenos Ayres and ascent of the Parana.—The\r\n    pass of Obligado.—Intervention of Brazil, and passage of the\r\n    Uruguay by Urquiza.—Capitulation of General Oribe.—Battle of\r\n    Moron, and fall of Rosas.—Fluvial obstructions to trade and\r\n    navigation.—Buenos Ayrean washerwomen.—English residents, their\r\n    churches and newspaper, hotels and boarding-houses.—Anglo\r\n    intermarriages.—Railway projects.—A word on the Buenos Ayrean\r\n    constitution.—A South American debate.—Society in Buenos\r\n    Ayres.—The Opera-house, and its galaxy of beauty.—Foreign\r\n    shopkeepers and Irish servants.—General Paz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUENOS AYRES FROM THE AÇOTEA OR, TERRACE OF THE QUINTA.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS.—The view preceding this chapter\r\n    is a reduced fac simile of the drawing of the city, taken by\r\n    Sir W. G. Ouseley, from the house, or quinta, occupied by him\r\n    during the period he was Minister here, it having formerly\r\n    been the residence of the two diplomatists who preceded him,\r\n    Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Mandeville. Sir William says the dwelling\r\n    is situated in the suburb of the city, and stands in a pretty\r\n    garden and pleasure grounds, occupying above nine acres. The\r\n    sketch was taken while a squall was coming on, the precursor\r\n    of one of the hurricanes called Pamperos, but which are not\r\n    quite peculiar to the Pampas, inasmuch as something of the same\r\n    kind will be found to be of occasional occurrence in Brazil,\r\n    as specified in the note to the illustration of Rio Janeiro,\r\n    at page 150. Vessels in the Plate, and along the coast, often\r\n    suffer severely from the Pamperos, or gales blowing over plains\r\n    that stretch out to the foot of the Andes. These storms come\r\n    on very suddenly, so that not unfrequently, while one part\r\n    of the landscape is still basking in calm sunshine, the rest\r\n    is shrouded in a dark veil, almost intercepting the light\r\n    of day, while black clouds are impetuously swept onwards by\r\n    the advancing gale, discharging in their course torrents\r\n    of rain, until in a short time the whole of the horizon is\r\n    alike inducted by the Pamperos, generally lasting for three\r\n    days. Even experienced pilots and mariners have but short\r\n    warning of their approach; and at certain seasons of the year\r\n    particularly great vigilance is highly necessary to guard\r\n    against their sudden violence. Buenos Ayres, like Monte Video\r\n    and nearly all the towns in these provinces, is built on the\r\n    rectangular system prescribed by the laws of the Indies, the\r\n    streets intersecting each other at right angles every 150\r\n    yards, forming what the Americans call regular squares or\r\n    blocks. It does not follow, however, that this regularity\r\n    contributes in reality either to the beauty or convenience of\r\n    a town. It is monotonous, and the uniformity is certainly far\r\n    less picturesque than the sort of irregularity that gives so\r\n    pleasing an effect to the Boulevards of Paris, and to many\r\n    parts of the older capitals of Europe. Here the more handsome\r\n    buildings, as usual in Spanish and Portuguese America, are\r\n    mostly of an ecclesiastical character—churches, convents,\r\n    &c. At a distance, or softened by the shades of evening,\r\n    they have an imposing appearance; but a nearer approach and\r\n    bright daylight show, as in Eastern towns, that the ravages\r\n    of time have never been checked by proper care; that few have\r\n    ever been completely finished or repaired; and many bear\r\n    marks of utter neglect and decay. This is especially the case\r\n    with edifices constructed for charitable purposes and public\r\n    buildings. Hospitals, schools, lunatic asylums, &c., were\r\n    until lately going to ruin, and whatever funds or estates may\r\n    have originally been granted by private or public benefactors\r\n    for the support of these institutions, they had not been\r\n    employed by recent governments, more especially that of Rosas,\r\n    for their maintenance, as intended by the donors. Several of\r\n    the streets are paved with granite, brought from the islands\r\n    above Buenos Ayres—chiefly from Martin Garcia; but being on a\r\n    bad principle, as the stones are neither of equal size, nor\r\n    properly cut, they, therefore, soon become uneven and very\r\n    trying for carriages. The unpaved ones are actually dangerous\r\n    or impassable for vehicles with springs and horses, especially\r\n    after heavy rains; for, there being no stones, while the soil\r\n    is fine and of great depth, deep holes, quagmires, and pools of\r\n    water, form in parts of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Monte Video for a time, let us now ascend the La Plata, and\r\ntake a peep at this far-famed Lion’s Den, where for so many years the\r\ndespotic Rosas pursued his iniquitous course with impunity. We got up\r\nsteam, and left just before dark, with a fair number of passengers for\r\na first trip, and any quantity of luggage belonging to them. It was a\r\nmagnificent moonlight as we glided over the great waters, for such they\r\nmay truly be called; scarcely a breath of wind, but a cold, rarified air,\r\nthat made many resort to their coats, cloaks, and any other available\r\ncovering. Our only difficulty was in making the vessel go _slow_ enough,\r\nand even so we arrived off the outer roads long before daylight, after\r\nwhich we made our way through a fleet of shipping, and the city of Buenos\r\nAyres was spread before us, rising, as it were, out of the water, tall\r\nchurches and domes standing forth in strong relief against a glittering\r\nsun; but in other respects, appearances were not very inviting. After two\r\nhours consumed in waiting for the officer to board us, we were enabled to\r\nland—and such landing! worse even than what met the Spaniards on their\r\nfirst visit; for since that time heaps of petrified mud have accumulated\r\non the shore, which thus looks like rock, and boats are obliged literally\r\nto grope their way through it, going as near as they can to the land;\r\nbut the usual process is for visitors to be bundled out of the boat into\r\nan open cart, drawn by two horses, like so many pigs or sheep, often at\r\nthe risk of being drenched. Indeed, nothing can be more wretched than\r\nthis landing at one of the finest cities of South America, which does\r\nnot possess a single jetty, wharf, pier, or accommodation of any kind in\r\nthis way, although there is a fine walk built along the margin of the\r\nriver, serving as a public promenade, but yet very little frequented.\r\nThe only redeeming point in this landing is the singularity of the turn\r\nout, the picturesque dress and character of the drivers being again much\r\nof the Turk, only a finer and more athletic race, with any degree of\r\npersonal activity, and no touch of pity in them towards the unfortunate\r\nanimals they ride; for there is no driving here, all done _en postilion_,\r\nand I believe they even fish on horseback, to say nothing of begging.\r\nThe position of the roadstead is bad enough, the outer roads being five\r\nto six miles from shore, and the inner roads from one to two miles,\r\n(according to the position taken up,) without being subjected to such\r\ninconvenience when you do reach the land; but on this point we shall have\r\nsome further remarks to make when reviewing the commercial character of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUENOS AYRES—QUINTA, FORMERLY THE SEAT OF THE BRITISH\r\nLEGATION.]\r\n\r\nThe unfavourable sensation produced by the vile landing and unfinished\r\nlook of the churches and buildings from the river vanishes when fairly\r\nin the heart of the city. You are struck with astonishment at its vast\r\nsize, many well-paved streets, public buildings, and houses redolent\r\nof luxurious comfort. Nor does a closer inspection quite remove this\r\nimpression; on the contrary, the more you examine and penetrate, the\r\ngreater the surprise that after so long a period of civil and foreign\r\nwarfare, there should still exist so much vitality. The conviction at\r\nonce forces itself upon you that there must be wealth, and no small\r\namount of it, somewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAny lengthened description of Buenos Ayres, beyond what is supplied in\r\nthe note below,[85] and that on the illustration, would be superfluous,\r\nso many thousand English having visited and recorded their experiences\r\nof it; but it is very questionable whether the public generally have any\r\nadequate idea of the magnitude of the city, the extent of its inland\r\nterritory, or the leading characteristics of both. At all events, very\r\nfew works have been published from which accurate information of this\r\nkind can be derived; the recent and most valuable one of Sir Woodbine\r\nParish being as yet only partially known, in consequence of its being but\r\na second edition of one published several years ago; and even since the\r\nsecond edition appeared, scarcely two years back, there is necessity for\r\nfurther information, so unstable is the condition of things, and so rapid\r\nthe mutation of momentous events in these regions. Certainly there is\r\nample scope for dissertation in all that comes under one’s notice here,\r\nlook with what indifference or contempt we may upon the individuals and\r\nparties by whom political occurrences are influenced. First, as regards\r\nthe climate and people: the difference in temperature between Buenos\r\nAyres and Rio Janeiro at this season of the year is from 20 to 30 deg.,\r\nand after four or five days’ sailing, you find yourself obliged to change\r\nthe lightest possible clothing for English tweeds and stout broad-cloth,\r\nwhich, mindful of such vicissitude, and therein being much more provident\r\nthan some of my fellow voyagers, I had fortunately with me. It is a\r\nprecaution I would recommend all voyagers in the Plate to adopt, as it is\r\none that will not only save them much inconvenience at the outset, but\r\nprobably obviate a material cause of subsequent illness, consequent upon\r\nexposure to such rapid transitions as are here experienced, especially\r\nuntil the traveller becomes somewhat acclimated.\r\n\r\nThe mornings and evenings are positively cold, even according to our\r\nEnglish acceptation of the word; and most houses had fires in their\r\nsitting rooms. In the day time the sun is warm and pleasant; the air of\r\nthat bracing kind which is calculated to raise the animal spirits, and\r\ngive a tone and energy to the mind. The difference, too, in the people\r\nbetween this place and Brazil is remarkable:—strong, healthy-looking men,\r\nclear complexioned, bright-eyed women, many of whom have as much bloom\r\non their cheeks as would become an English dairy-maid. Of course, there\r\nis a considerable mixture of races; but the true native Buenos Ayreans\r\ncan be easily distinguished by their rather dark but clear complexion,\r\ndark eyes, and dark hair, strongly-marked sharp features, and somewhat\r\naquiline nose; whilst the Guachos, or horsemen of the Pampas, the\r\nSouth American Bedouins, combining the attributes of their Hispaniolan\r\nforefathers with the later ‘blood of the desert,’ are the most\r\npicturesque-looking objects in the world, being dressed in fancy-coloured\r\nponchos, with much ornamental work about them, and long, embroidered\r\nwhite trousers, galloping about on equally grotesque-looking steeds. They\r\nremind one immediately of Arab sketches, or, still more vividly, of real\r\nArabs, if you have been fortunate enough to have made the overland trip,\r\nand beheld the followers of the Prophet in the land of dates, palm-trees,\r\nand dromedaries; many of these Guachos being, also, immensely muscular,\r\nfine-looking men. Numerous black faces are also to be seen here, the\r\nowners thereof being all free, and mostly occupied as regular soldiers,\r\nas likewise at Monte Video.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENDEDOR DE PTALCES—SWEETMEAT-SELLER.]\r\n\r\nBuenos Ayres literally forms a regular chess-board, as the plans of the\r\ncity show. It is about four miles square, and supposed to contain nearly\r\n100,000 inhabitants; but as no census has ever been taken, this is only\r\nconjecture: some asserting that there are 120,000, others, not 80,000;\r\nand others again, as low as 50,000.[86] At all events, the mass of the\r\nhouses being well occupied, rents are very high, paying the owners from\r\n12 to 20 per cent. per annum; so there would appear to be plenty of\r\noccupants, and great encouragement to go on building. The same remark\r\nas to the description, extent, and elegance, of private houses, applies\r\nhere precisely as in the capital of the Uruguay, only that they are ten\r\nto one in number, more costly and elegant; indeed, the city itself,\r\ncompared with Monte Video, is as London to Liverpool, the great maritime\r\nand commercial advantages and facilities of the one being regarded as an\r\nequivalent, and perhaps more than an equivalent, to the architectural and\r\ngeneral urban superiority of the other. The size of the (fifteen) Buenos\r\nAyrean churches is something marvellous; and it is impossible to enter\r\nthem without admiring these monuments of the power and wealth exercised\r\nby the Jesuits, as well as of that undaunted tenacity of Spanish\r\ncharacter which could erect such huge piles in a country where there are\r\nneither bricks, mortar, nor stones on the spot, all having to come from a\r\ndistance. But, as we have said, the brick-work in many of them has never\r\nbeen completed; and they look very bad when contrasted with the glaring\r\nwhite of other parts of the building, covered with large patches of\r\ngrass and rubbish. The cathedral is the crowning point of Buenos Ayrean\r\nattractions, only more modern, and the exterior is in the same unfinished\r\nstate as much older edifices; the interior being gorgeously ‘fitted up’\r\nwith numerous side altars and oratories, well cleaned, lighted, and\r\nventilated, with numerous glass chandeliers down the nave. There is less\r\ntinsel and glare than in many Roman Catholic churches in Europe, but more\r\nsolidity and pleasing effect; nor can a stranger help expressing surprise\r\non entering so fine a building, whose architectural merit is enhanced by\r\nits situation in so handsome a square, the other sides being occupied by\r\nthe Cabilda, or police-office, and good shops and dwelling-houses, with\r\nstriking piazzas. There is also an ornamental archway on the side facing\r\nthe sea, looking towards the old fort and government house, together with\r\na pillar in the centre of the square, to commemorate the independence of\r\nthe country. This square has been the scene of many important political\r\nchanges: it was here that our brave soldiers under General Whitelock\r\nforced their way, and from the Square Manzo, what is now styled Calle\r\nde Defensa (Defence-street), by which the troops entered the town, and\r\nwere shot down from the flat tops of the houses,[87] without the power or\r\nmeans of defending themselves. It does not require a military eye to see\r\nthe error and folly of the tactics pursued in this melancholy business,\r\nnor to be satisfied with how little trouble and loss of life such an\r\narmy as the British, so circumstanced, could have reduced a city like\r\nBuenos Ayres, even supposing they had preferred a more summary process to\r\nthat of starving out the enemy. There was an infatuation about the whole\r\naffair for which it is difficult to account, especially when coupled\r\nwith the gratuitous surrender of Monte Video, under the same terms as\r\nthose which ensured the capitulation of Whitelock, a clause inserted\r\nby the Spanish general, Liniers, without the least idea that it would\r\nbe acceded to. But, at that period, imbecility and absurdity the most\r\nincredible seemed to preside at our military councils, leading to the\r\nsame futile and mortifying results as had characterized our operations\r\nin Walcheren and elsewhere in Europe, some few years before. With Monte\r\nVideo and Buenos Ayres under our flag, it is difficult to conjecture what\r\nmight not have been the fate of a country traversed by boundless rivers,\r\nand in every way so admirably adapted to the agricultural pursuits of\r\nEnglishmen. The tide of emigration from our own shores would then, in\r\nall probability, have flowed freely towards this part of the world, and\r\nthe United States of North America have taken considerably more time to\r\ndevelope themselves, and to have attained their present position, which,\r\nof course, has been reached mainly in consequence of the enormous influx\r\nof the redundant bone, sinew, and brain of Europe. On such slight threads\r\nand events does the destiny of nations often hang. But it is time that we\r\nleave speculation for fact.\r\n\r\nThe name of Rosas has been so long identified with Buenos Ayres, that\r\nyou no sooner find yourself within the recent sphere of his undisputed\r\nand unquestioned domination than you naturally ask, where exist the\r\nmonuments of his activity, and the proofs of his successful promotion\r\nof the interests of this his dependent capital? Beyond a large town\r\nresidence, which he built for government purposes, a country residence,\r\ncalled Palermo, and a mole constructed in front of the sea, there is\r\nnothing to mark the reign of a man desirous of elevating the character of\r\nhis countrymen in the scale of civilized nations, or of contributing to\r\ntheir commercial prosperity. In spite of civil wars and bad government,\r\nthe city of Buenos Ayres has contrived to extend itself, although the\r\ncountry round it is, more or less, in a state of desolation; but he has\r\nfailed to leave any enduring personal impress, either outside or inside,\r\nof those walls where for many years he ruled lord of life and means, and\r\nalmost of thought, so comprehensive and exhaustive was his despotism. The\r\ntown residence alluded to is now occupied by the executive for public\r\npurposes, and the private one at Palermo will soon go to ruin and decay.\r\nThis latter characteristic evidence of selfish gratification, without\r\neither taste, utility, or architectural design, has cost endless sums\r\nof money; but the approximate extent of the outlay will never be known.\r\nPalermo is built on a swampy bank of the river, with only a ground floor,\r\nat times several feet under water, which must be a prolific source of\r\nfever and ague. It is reported of Rosas, that on one occasion the water\r\nwas so high, that the cook sent him word he could not dress his dinner;\r\nbut on ascertaining that the kitchen-fires were not out, the command was\r\nto prepare the meal forthwith. The unfortunate subterranean ruler of the\r\nroast did so at once, congratulating himself that he only suffered the\r\npenalty of a severe attack of rheumatism, instead of the more summary\r\nvisitation wherewith the dictator generally followed up the slightest\r\nimplied opposition to his wishes, even in so trumpery a matter as the one\r\nwe speak of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALERMO—FORMERLY THE RESIDENCE OF ROSAS.]\r\n\r\nA good level road has been carried from the city to Palermo, at\r\nconsiderable expense, the approach being ‘through an avenue of willows,’\r\nmade to look as park-like as possible. About the house, or palace,\r\nas it might have been called in the days of its glory, are numerous\r\nout-buildings and barracks for cavalry, of which Rosas always kept\r\na strong body-guard, as might naturally have been expected from his\r\nantecedents, he having principally risen to power in the first instance\r\namong his fellow guachos by the superior daring and dexterity of his\r\nhorsemanship; added, of course, to his extreme adroitness in turning to\r\nhis own account the dissentions of his rivals in the race for power.\r\nPassing the house, down another long avenue towards the river, you are\r\nsurprised at seeing a large vessel, evidently fitted up for some special\r\npurpose. It appears she was driven ashore there in some heavy gale; and\r\nRosas had her converted into a pleasure house, where balls and parties\r\nwere held—another toy or plaything suited to the character of the man.\r\nNature being found rather stubborn in yielding to the wishes of the\r\nowner of Palermo, immense sums were expended in planting orange trees,\r\never-greens, and exotics, of one kind or another, which were brushed and\r\ncombed daily, and coaxed into a sickly existence; but it would not do.\r\nNothing but willows flourish, or will continue to flourish, over the\r\ndilapidated abode from which issued many a bloody decree of this Borgia\r\nof the Pampas.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to say anything unnecessarily harsh of Rosas: on the\r\ncontrary, knowing, as I do, what was the state of parties in this portion\r\nof South America, I am quite willing to admit the extreme exigency of\r\nhis position in the first instance, as one who must put down, with an\r\niron, and even a remorseless, hand, that universal anarchy and violence\r\nin the midst of which he attained the eminence of being the most daring\r\nand sanguinary member of a community of semi-civilized brigands. But what\r\nshould silence, or rather should have silenced, for they are all mute\r\nenough now, his well-paid eulogists and defenders, is the continuance\r\nof mean and miserable cruelties, long after the faintest pretext for\r\ntheir perpetration on political grounds had passed away. I will not\r\nshock the reader by a revival of stories at which one’s blood runs\r\ncold. He is gone; fled as ignominiously as he had lived detestably;\r\nand, notwithstanding his gangs of gorged assassin friends, who would\r\nprofit by his return, he has left none behind who bless his memory.\r\nIf any proof were wanted, this would be conclusive, as to the purely\r\nselfish career of the man; for even a comity of crime evokes no benison\r\non the head of the expelled despot, who never thought of anything but\r\nthe aggrandisement of himself and family, at the expense of the national\r\ntreasury. The revulsion of popular feeling towards him is only what might\r\nhave been anticipated, though hardly, perhaps, to the extent that has\r\nactually taken place, considering the length of time he ruled, and the\r\nimmense number of personal retainers one would have thought he might have\r\ncontrived to attach to him. Some of these remained faithful after his\r\nfall, to the length of employing a portion of the ample funds left behind\r\nhim to endeavour to promote his recall.\r\n\r\nThere has been an end of this for some time, and, consequently, a\r\ncessation of the intrigues arising from it. Urquiza, his sometime\r\nsuccessor in the dictatorship, and the present President of the Argentine\r\nConfederation, (though long since repudiated by the principal state of\r\nthe confederacy, Buenos Ayres, itself), extended to Rosas the almost\r\nunheard-of generosity of sparing his so-called private property—property\r\nwhich he wrung from the state, and which, on his departure, was employed\r\nby his myrmidons to effect the expulsion of Urquiza, and bring about\r\nthe restoration of the elder tyrant. The former object it undoubtedly\r\ngreatly helped to accomplish; in the latter it entirely failed; for,\r\nthough Urquiza certainly entered upon unwise courses, was too precipitate\r\nand sweeping in his changes, and mistook violence for vigour, in many\r\ninstances, as was not unnatural in a soldier fresh from another country,\r\nfor the province of which he was president, Entre Rios, may be called\r\nso, still, from all I could learn among dispassionate critics, it would\r\nseem that he and the citizens, friends of order, would soon have become\r\nreconciled to each other, and there would have been a mutual softening\r\nof acerbities, were it not for the emissaries of Rosas being enabled,\r\nby the means just mentioned, to foment those antagonist feelings which\r\neventually led to the siege and blockade, by Urquiza, of the very place\r\nhe had so lately freed from the presence of the despot. Whatever may\r\nhave been the faults of Urquiza, and they certainly find no apologist\r\nin me, his brief tenure of supreme power was sufficiently long to\r\nprove that he was altogether a man of superior stamp to Rosas, whose\r\nselfishness lacked even the ambition to make his tyranny respectable,\r\nin the sense that the most narrow-minded of oppressors have endeavoured\r\nto do elsewhere. Francia, whilst isolating Paraguay from all the world,\r\ncontrived to make the Paraguayans proud of their country, and to cause\r\nothers to believe that that pride was not altogether unfounded. Not so\r\nwith Rosas: short-sighted as Francia, he had not a particle of the lofty\r\nfeeling which influenced that gloomy bigot; for, while endeavouring to\r\nrender Buenos Ayres powerful, it was all for himself individually; and\r\nhe cared not to give the Buenos Ayreans an interest in saying that the\r\ntyrant who ground them was otherwise than simply hateful, and that what\r\nhe achieved for them in the eyes of foreigners was purely contemptible.\r\nSaying nothing of the total absence, under his regime, of any commercial\r\nconvenience, as already pointed out, not a single thing was done during\r\nhis sway that had for its object real internal improvement. No newspapers\r\nwere allowed to appear, except those under his sanction, in the same way\r\nas the one St. Petersburgh journal under the Czar’s surveillance. Not a\r\nsingle literary, historical, descriptive, or local work was allowed to\r\nbe published or sold in Buenos Ayres, and barely a common-place almanack\r\ncould be procured; so that to the present day you cannot find such a\r\nthing in the city as the slightest evidence that the mind of the whole\r\npopulation was otherwise than embruted to the level of helots, which\r\nindeed was virtually the case all the time his blighting influence was\r\nin the ascendant. The answer to any inquiry at the shops for works of\r\ninformation about either the city or provinces, during that period, is\r\ninvariably the same, ‘Rosas did not permit their publication!’ The\r\nconsequence is, you are obliged to grope your way along, and glean what\r\nyou can from those you meet.\r\n\r\nThe rationale of this argument is altogether incomprehensible; for\r\nhow are we to understand what could be his motive for such conduct at\r\nhome, when we know that he was particularly assiduous, by means of the\r\nFrench, English, and even German press, and through every instrument of\r\npublicity he could influence, whether on stock exchanges, in diplomatic\r\ncircles, or in fashionable coteries, to disseminate through Europe the\r\nbelief that his capital was the abode of luxurious and intellectual\r\nenjoyment of every kind, its inhabitants delighted with his paternal\r\nsway, and that any interference on behalf of the unfortunate Uruguayans\r\nor others of his victims, external or domestic, was to be deprecated as\r\nthe most irremediable of calamities, not merely to Buenos Ayres itself,\r\nbut the whole of South America? That he succeeded in propagating this\r\nbelief in some of the best informed quarters of Europe, particularly\r\nin England, is but too well known; and it is not a little curious that\r\nalmost simultaneously with his arrival here, there appeared in certain\r\norgans, influenced by him, loud praises of a Hamburgh publication devoted\r\nto the exposition of the wisdom of his commercial policy, and ridiculing\r\nthe notion of the affluents of the Plata ever being opened to European\r\ntrade. But he and his system have passed away, and the memory of them is\r\nfast departing too in the coming of that better time which is believed\r\nto be at hand. His brother arrived in Europe in January last, despairing\r\nof any restoration of the family fortunes whatever; so I take leave of\r\na topic that has become as obsolete as it would have been disagreeable\r\nto pursue it; and shall make no apology for the omission in these pages\r\nof anecdotic scandals,[88] for which readers at one time looked, as\r\na matter of course, in every book professing to treat of the terrible\r\nDictator, and eke of his famous daughter, the Donna Manueleta, who has\r\nbeen married (to a South American) since her father’s arrival in England,\r\nand now lives, I believe, in the neighbourhood of Southampton. Unwilling\r\nto dwell on the political complications in the Plate, and, at the same\r\ntime, fearing it would be a contradiction of the desire expressed in the\r\npreface, to render this volume as informing as possible, especially to\r\nreaders who may draw from it for the first time their knowledge of South\r\nAmerican matters, I append, in a note, from the excellent geographical\r\nwork of Mr. Charles Knight, now (1854) in course of publication[89] by\r\nMessrs. Bradbury and Evans, a brief, but comprehensive and dispassionate\r\nstatement of recent incidents in the Argentine Confederation, and have\r\nadded a few particulars, which, together, will, it is hoped, bring\r\nthe narrative of occurrences necessary to be known down to the period\r\nof going to press, without the occupation of much space, or tediously\r\nencumbering the text with minutiæ of proper names, dates, and places, for\r\nthese are really of little value to the general reader save for purposes\r\nof reference.\r\n\r\nThe view of the port of Buenos Ayres (if it can be called a port) from\r\nthe flats of the houses is picturesque, vessels lying at anchor as\r\nfar as the eye can reach. On the left, towards Palermo, is some high\r\nground, with numerous pretty-looking villa residences; on the right, is\r\nthe old fort, afterwards the custom-house, warehouses, and depôts of\r\nvarious kinds; further on, what is called the Boca, or Mouth, a small\r\nriver, where large numbers of minor craft discharge and load in safety;\r\nbut, at times, it is difficult even for them to get out, owing to an\r\naccumulation of sand at the river’s mouth which Rosas might have kept\r\nopen, but made a really effectual effort to close it. Looking seaward,\r\nswarms of carts are visible going to and from lighters or small vessels\r\nat anchor in the inner road, the only means by which shipping can be\r\ndischarged or loaded, the merchandise exposed of course to damage from\r\nbeing wet, as the horses are often up to their chests, and the cart\r\nitself even higher, in the water, through which it has to be dragged\r\nfor a mile and upwards. The wonder is how any trade whatever can be\r\ncarried on under such disadvantages. Another singular feature in the\r\nvicinage of the landing place is to see the shore covered with garments\r\nof cotton and linen undergoing every stage of the ablutionary process,\r\nthe Buenos Ayrean naiads of the oceanic wash-tub converting the Atlantic\r\nto a purpose undreamed of by the Mesdames Partington of the elder\r\nworld. As far as the eye can reach the detergent sisterhood may be seen\r\nof an afternoon, like the laundry-maid in the fable, ‘spreading out\r\ntheir clothes;’ and their gesticulations, and the chattering they keep\r\nup, especially if there is a squall blowing, and one can hear their\r\nshrill treble piping fitfully above the blast at intervals, recalls a\r\nrecollection of the Witches’ Dance as played by Paganini, if you ever\r\nhappen to have heard that weird fantasia on one string; or, if not,\r\nperhaps you will be inclined to account for what must have been the\r\nsensation of Columbus and his companions, on nearing the shores of the\r\nnew world, when, according to Rogers,\r\n\r\n              The sound of harpy wings they heard\r\n    And shrieks, not of men, were mingling in the blast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAS LABANDERAS—THE LAUNDRESSES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAZA DE LA VICTORIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTICA—CHEMIST’S SHOP.]\r\n\r\nWe have said there is a large foreign population, some say 50,000; but\r\nthough that must be a great exaggeration, there are at all events some\r\n5000 English of all denominations, many being small tradesmen, and not\r\na few owners of cattle and cultivators of the soil in the province; the\r\nAnglo Buenos Ayrean community mustering altogether in sufficient strength\r\nto support liberally a well-conducted though not always impartial local\r\norgan of their own, in their own language, called the _British Packet_,\r\nwhich holds somewhat the same rank among the family of John Bull on\r\nthe East coast of South America that _Galignani_ does in Paris—saving\r\nthe political neutrality of the latter. There is a tolerably handsome\r\nwell-frequented English, and several other protestant churches, nearly\r\nall of which have good schools in connection with them; as have also the\r\nplaces of worship belonging to the Germans, who muster to the number of\r\nabout 900, or nearly equal to the Scotch; but the governmental influence\r\nexercised over these schools renders them less satisfactory to the\r\nparents of the children than could be desired. It is to be hoped that\r\nnow there is a stable form of administration established, there will be a\r\nreformation in this respect; for, from the circumstance of Buenos Ayres\r\npossessing many institutions for the promotion of science, for painting\r\nand drawing, and some excellent libraries, not saying anything of several\r\ngood newspapers, which, though in Spanish, are very useful to the foreign\r\ninhabitants, the city is perhaps one of the best for educational purposes\r\nin South America. Indeed, there is a very English aspect in many features\r\nof Buenos Ayres, not the least prominent of which are perhaps the hotels\r\nand boarding-houses, several of these establishments being conducted by\r\nEnglish people, and by natives of the United States. Anglo intermarriages\r\nwith the natives are frequent, and a few years of peace and tranquillity\r\nhere, as at Monte Video, would give a wonderful impetus to population,\r\nand to the trade of the place. Some railway projects were being talked\r\nof when I was there, and still more sanguinely since I left. These, if\r\nundertaken by joint stock companies on the spot, may be carried out\r\nwith remunerative success; but the government are totally helpless in\r\nthe present state of their finances. One railway scheme, from the mole\r\nround to the custom-house along the margin of the river, would be a great\r\npublic convenience, and easily made. Railways and steam navigation must\r\nbe established, to drive these countries a-head, or they will recede\r\ninto a state of semi-barbarism. They cannot stand still, or remain in\r\ntheir present normal condition; and it is to be hoped they will take\r\nheart of grace from the position and example of Brazil, which shows\r\nthat it is not climate, race, geographical position, nor fertility of\r\nsoil, that gives prosperity to a country; but 1st, peace, and, above all,\r\ninternal peace; and, 2ndly, a determination to avail of the advantages\r\nwhich peace alone permits of, when it is a peace secured, not by the\r\nleaden despotism of a Paraguayan Francia or a Muscovite Nicholas, but\r\nby a constitutional government, rendering every man equal in the eye of\r\nthe law, and rendering the law equally applicable to every man’s case,\r\nfrom the President or Emperor, to the humblest citizen, whatever his\r\ncreed, colour, or profession. In reference to the system of government\r\nprevailing in Buenos Ayres, it is only necessary to say that, like all\r\nthe South American republics, nominal freedom is maintained on the widest\r\nbasis. Forty-four deputies, one-half of whom are elected every year by\r\nthe people, compose the junta, or legislative assembly, by whom the\r\ngovernor,[90] or captain-general, is chosen for three years, he being\r\naltogether unfettered in his choice of ministry, but their policy must\r\nof course be acceptable to the junta to be rendered effective, as in\r\nthe case of the British Cabinet and House of Commons. The provisional\r\ngovernor now in office is Don Manuel Pinto; and from all I could hear,\r\nhis conduct, and that of his ministers, is regarded with as much general\r\nfavour as could be reasonably expected, considering his and their\r\nexceedingly anomalous position. For it is to be remembered that Buenos\r\nAyres is, _de jure_, a province of the Argentine Confederation, and yet\r\n_de facto_, separated from it, the difficulty being to determine how far\r\neither condition is acceptable, or the contrary, whether to the Buenos\r\nAyreans themselves, or to any, and how many, of the other provinces,\r\nwhose constancy to any one view, whether as affecting their individual or\r\nfederative status, cannot be counted upon for a month together. I had not\r\nan opportunity of attending the Buenos Ayrean Assembly, but believe that\r\nthe description given of that at Rio is tolerably applicable to it, and\r\nthat both, and indeed those of all the states of the continent, were very\r\naccurately pourtrayed by Mr. Robinson several years ago, nothing whatever\r\nhaving occurred since to qualify his sketch, viz.,—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VISTA DE UNA CASA SOBRE EL RIO—VIEW OF A HOUSE ON THE\r\nRIVER.]\r\n\r\n    The form of South American debates is this: members take their\r\n    seats, having previously assembled in an ante-room, till a\r\n    sufficient number is collected to constitute what is called\r\n    a ‘sala,’ and by us, ‘a house.’ The government secretaries\r\n    or ministers have their respective places, but no vote in\r\n    the house. The president (or speaker) sits at a table on a\r\n    platform raised above the level of the room. There is a bell\r\n    at his right-hand, with which he tinkles to order. He has a\r\n    secretary on either side of him; and one or two reporters are\r\n    seated immediately under him. In some places, the members\r\n    speak in a sitting position, which, to an Englishman, has\r\n    an awkward effect. In other places they mount up into a\r\n    ‘tribuno,’ or rostrum. By the former position the graces and\r\n    vehemence of action are precluded; and by the latter, not only\r\n    does action become a mere studied display, but the notion of\r\n    business is superseded by the expectancy of a formal oration.\r\n    We cannot reconcile it to ourselves in the one case, to see a\r\n    man sitting and taking his snuff-box out, during the heat of\r\n    debate (himself being at once the snuffer and the speaker),\r\n    any more than in the other we can feel ourselves warmed by\r\n    the over-wrought rapidity of action of a mercurial spirit,\r\n    or the measured solemnity of a grave one, putting forth its\r\n    ebullitions from a box, of which the sides are too high for\r\n    elbow-room. South American members of parliament, in the\r\n    exercise of a politeness not in use with ours, do not at once\r\n    rise to speak, but preface all they have to say with a ‘pido\r\n    la palabra,’ that is, ‘I desire leave to speak.’ The president\r\n    nods assent. His eye has been caught; and the honourable\r\n    member proceeds in a strain, that, in accordance, at first,\r\n    with the modesty of his appeal, rises by degrees, into such\r\n    rude charges, and round assertions against his opponents,\r\n    as to draw from them, long before he has finished, loud and\r\n    frequent interruptions, much denial of premises, and motioning\r\n    of the hand and head, as if to say, ‘You shall have an answer.’\r\n    This impatience often proceeds so far, not on the part of the\r\n    immediate opponent alone, of the speaking member, but of all\r\n    who take a different view of the case, that the president is\r\n    obliged to tinkle many times the bell by which he calls the\r\n    members to order before he can procure it; and no sooner is\r\n    it procured, than it is again interrupted. There are frequent\r\n    calls, during the heat of debate, for the ‘quarto intermedio,’\r\n    or quarter of an hour’s rest; and few subjects, indeed, are\r\n    ever deemed of interest enough to warrant a prolongation of\r\n    the morning sitting, which ends at two o’clock P.M., or of\r\n    the evening one, which closes at nine. In an early congress\r\n    of Buenos Ayres, some point was discussed of such unusual\r\n    importance, that at five o’clock in the afternoon the sitting\r\n    had not come to a close. At this hour, a worthy but rather\r\n    gastronomic member rose and said: ‘Gentlemen, I beg you to\r\n    observe, that if we thus prolong our debates beyond our\r\n    regular dinner-hour, these political discussions will at last\r\n    land us in our graves.’ He was cheered by all the old doctors\r\n    present; and more regular hours were thenceforth observed. Mr.\r\n    Brotherton would be a well-supported member in the Buenos Ayres\r\n    House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IDA AL BAILE—GOING TO THE BALL.]\r\n\r\nThe _agremens_ of social life for natives, and, what is still more rare\r\nin South American cities, for foreigners, are numerous. Not only are\r\nthere comfortable Club-Houses, to which they resort in considerable\r\nnumbers, but there is the opera for lovers of music—an art, or rather a\r\npassion pursued here with even greater devotion than in the rival sister\r\ncity of the Plate, of which we have spoken in the previous chapter; but\r\nhere of course this passion is far more effectually administered to\r\nthan at Monte Video, because of the presence of a well-supported and\r\nvery effective lyric corps. As with ourselves at home, to be sure, the\r\nopera-house is resorted to not exclusively because of its chromatic or\r\nchoreographic allurements, but for the fashion of the thing, and, on\r\nthe part of the male sex, for the sake of the opportunity of witnessing\r\nthe Buenos Ayrean belles, who, on such occasion, are seen to infinite\r\nadvantage, probably even more so than on the Prado, in all the magic\r\nof mantilla, and that peculiarly bewitching gait they derive from\r\ntheir Andalusian mammas. Much as I had heard before-hand of what Lord\r\nPalmerston, in describing aldermen’s wives at Lord Mayors’ dinners, calls\r\nthe ‘galaxy of beauty’ which assembles in the Buenos Ayrean Opera-House,\r\nI was altogether unprepared for the reality; and certainly I never saw\r\nso many charming looking women collected together, especially in a part\r\nof the theatre corresponding to our upper boxes, but here nicknamed the\r\nHen-Coop, into which sanctum none of the worser half of humanity is\r\nadmitted any more than is the better half in the Omnibus Box in Covent\r\nGarden, or what used to be such when there was a place once known as\r\nHer Majesty’s Theatre. Unlike our Omnibus Box, however, the Hen-Coop\r\nadmits of its occupants being seen by the whole house, and the privilege\r\nis apparently no less gratifying to those who dispense than those who\r\nparticipate in it. In the regular dress boxes, ladies and gentlemen\r\nmingle as with us; and whether in mien, physiognomy, or manners, may\r\nchallenge comparison with any audience I have ever seen anywhere. The\r\nBuenos Ayrean ladies are social and unreserved, without the least degree\r\nof boldness or effrontery; they mix freely with foreigners, and go about\r\nout of doors without either duenna or cavalier servente. The peculiar\r\ncustom of seeming exclusiveness at the theatre just alluded to, arises\r\nfrom a wish to go unattended whenever they feel disposed, in their\r\nregular sitting or house dresses, which evince great natural taste and\r\nsimplicity, and not from any wish to avoid the company of the other sex.\r\nComing out of the theatre, they are met by their brothers, parents, or\r\nhusbands, and walk home as unceremoniously as they go. Among their other\r\naccomplishments should be included a peculiarly graceful equestrianism,\r\nwhich invariably excites the admiration of all Europeans in a marked\r\ndegree, and not the least so of the English, who pursue the sports of\r\nthe turf with the ardour which our countrymen carry with them for that\r\npastime wherever they go. The Buenos Ayrean races are very popular\r\nwith the inhabitants; and in return their fetes and festivals find\r\nconsiderable favour in British eyes.[91]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIESTAS MAYAS.—MAY-DAY IN BUENOS AYRES.]\r\n\r\nSince the restoration of peace, consequent upon the raising of the\r\nblockade by Urquiza, the trade of Buenos Ayres has wonderfully improved,\r\nand not only as regards the exports of the staples of the Plate of\r\nwhich we have already spoken, but in the imports of all manner of\r\nEuropean luxuries;[92] and the letters that continue to be received here\r\nby every mail represent the animation in commercial circles as most\r\nbuoyant.[93] There is now the greatest reason to believe that this state\r\nof things will long continue, or at least not be terminated by civil war,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact of Urquiza having been re-appointed President\r\nof all the provinces of the Confederation, with the exception of that of\r\nBuenos Ayres. Brazil, having effected the tranquillization of the Banda\r\nOriental, must of course be equally solicitous for the peace of the\r\nwhole region on either side of the Plate; and now that the Uruguay is\r\nthus effectually closed against the machinations of any of the agitators\r\nof the Confederation, it is to be presumed that the object for which\r\nthis country[94] made such costly but abortive efforts will at length be\r\naccomplished, and in a great degree by the instrumentality that would\r\nhave been employed there had judicious advice been followed, viz. by the\r\nfirm mediation of Brazil.\r\n\r\nWhile these pages were going through the press, there have occurred, or\r\nrather the recollection has been revived, of some circumstances that\r\ninduce me to supply a few details I did not originally contemplate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: URQUIZA AND ROSAS.]\r\n\r\nThough on a small scale, the preceding sketches of these remarkable\r\nmen are excellent likenesses, in either of which the physiognomist and\r\nphrenologist may find it difficult to decipher attributes that should\r\nreconcile the requirements of science with the characteristics of the\r\nindividual. First, as regards the elder of the two. Not only did Rosas\r\nincur unexampled odium by his cruelties in a sphere where what would be\r\nregarded as barbarity elsewhere is looked upon as laudable firmness of\r\ndisposition, but he enjoyed a reputation for a caustic pleasantry and\r\nwit, such indeed as pertained to many of the most remarkable tyrants of\r\nall ages, in all parts of the world; though, perhaps, less so to those\r\nof Spanish idiosyncrasy than any others. As he has now been expelled,\r\nbeyond the possibility of restoration, from the scene of his prolonged\r\nenormities, I should not seek to revive the recollection of them, or\r\nto disturb the quietude of his declining years in his retreat in this\r\ncountry by now adverting to them, were it not that some of the most\r\nsingular, and, as it was alleged by many of his salaried partizans in\r\nEurope at the time, some of the most apocryphal, have suddenly been\r\nrehabilitated with indisputable truth, and surrounded with a degree\r\nof interest not unworthy of one of M. Dumas’ romances, under the\r\ncircumstances named in the annexed paragraph, which appeared in the\r\nleading English journal while these pages were being prepared for the\r\npress, viz.:—\r\n\r\n    Two more of the ‘mashorqueros’ have been condemned and shot—a\r\n    fate they so richly merited. One of them, it is said, confessed\r\n    to having assassinated no less than 21 persons by the orders\r\n    of Rosas, and 19 on his own account. It is said the Government\r\n    is in possession of undoubted proof of the murder of the\r\n    English family (Kidd), when Mr. Ouseley was in Buenos Ayres in\r\n    1845, by the orders of Rosas; and that it is their intention\r\n    to place these proofs before the British Government. This,\r\n    however, may be a work of supererogation, as it is believed\r\n    here that Mr. Ouseley sent home ample proofs of the facts many\r\n    years ago, as well as proofs of the deliberate murder of the\r\n    midshipman Ross some time after.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the meaning of the strange term used in the first\r\nline of the preceding quotation, it may be necessary for the information\r\nof the younger reader,—for during Rosas’ sway the phrase occurred too\r\nfrequently to need explanation to any one who perused the revolting\r\nreports from the Plate—to supply an elucidation. This cannot be better\r\ndone than in the words addressed by the Uruguayan Agent in this country,\r\nGeneral O’Brien, to the then Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and present\r\nPrime Minister of England, in 1844, when seeking British assistance\r\nagainst the Buenos Ayrean oppressor of the Banda Oriental. The General\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n    The Masorcas, or secret affiliation, in support of Rosas’s\r\n    government, derives its name from the inward stalk of the\r\n    maize, when deprived of its grain, and has been used by the\r\n    members of the clubs as an instrument of torture, of which\r\n    your Lordship may form some idea when calling to mind the\r\n    agonizing death inflicted upon Edward II. By the members of\r\n    this club, assassination of those indisposed to the rule of\r\n    Rosas was, audaciously in some instances, covertly in more,\r\n    constantly exercised. Amongst the victims was Maya, the first\r\n    benefactor of Rosas. The estates of all who fell by the hands\r\n    of the band of Rosas, as well as of those who fled from his\r\n    vengeance, were seized by him. His absolute command of Buenos\r\n    Ayres, and his possession of the bank, enabled him to manage\r\n    the finances of the country, and in 1842 gave to him an army\r\n    of 10,000 men. Many were collected by fear, from the positive\r\n    knowledge that, if they did not obey his summons, their fate\r\n    would be similar to that of men who, having refused to join his\r\n    troops, were dragged out of their beds at night by members of\r\n    the Masorca Club, and in the very presence of their wives and\r\n    children brutally put to death! Like as it happened with the\r\n    early revolutionary armies of France, which had commissioners\r\n    from the Convention, the soldiers of Rosas were accompanied by\r\n    individuals of the Masorca Club, and they but too faithfully\r\n    executed the commission confided to them, depriving the victims\r\n    of Rosas’s vengeance or suspicion of life, amid tortures and\r\n    cruelties that shock humanity but to hear of them. My Lord, I\r\n    know of these tortures being inflicted. At the time that Oribe\r\n    invaded the Banda Oriental, with the army and the Masorca\r\n    commissioners of Rosas, I was residing on my estate in the\r\n    country. I am aware of wretches being staked into the ground\r\n    forty-eight hours before their heads were sawed, not cut,\r\n    off;—of the lasso being flung over persons’ necks, and then\r\n    drawn by a horse at full speed until life became extinct;—of\r\n    spikes being driven into the mouths of human beings, and they,\r\n    whilst living, thus nailed to trees.\r\n\r\nOf the way in which such machinery was capable of being used by such a\r\nman as Rosas, we may form an idea from General O’Brien’s description of\r\nhis antecedents:—\r\n\r\n    Rosas is known to me for five-and-twenty years. For his early\r\n    education he was indebted to Maza, afterwards president of\r\n    the Buenos Ayres congress. His calling in life was that of a\r\n    ‘Capataz,’—or care-taker of the property of his relatives, the\r\n    Anchorenas, and this brought him into constant intercourse with\r\n    the wild Indian tribes of the Pampas. He ingratiated himself\r\n    greatly with these tribes, for he not only conformed himself to\r\n    their habits, but he also won the favour of their Caciques by\r\n    presents, judiciously distributed amongst them. This was his\r\n    state of life until 1820, when the influence of his kinsmen,\r\n    the Anchorenas, obtained for him the lieutenant-colonelcy of\r\n    the militia of the frontiers of the Indian territory. It was\r\n    then, and not till then, that he appeared as a soldier. It was\r\n    to aid Martin Rodriguez in a successful revolution; but once\r\n    the victory of his friend had been secured, he again retired\r\n    to the Pampas, put himself in contact with the Patagonian\r\n    and Pampa Indians, and thus added to his popularity and his\r\n    influence amongst that savage race of men. Rosas maintained\r\n    his friendly relations with the Indians until the civil war,\r\n    in 1829, in Buenos Ayres. In that war the President Dorrego\r\n    was shot by Lavalle, and Rosas at once became the head of\r\n    the party of Dorrego. With the death of Dorrego commence the\r\n    calamities of that part of the world. The conduct, the bearing,\r\n    and the demeanour of Rosas, were such as to obtain for him\r\n    universal approbation. He gained in his favour the opinions\r\n    of the good, whilst he was concocting schemes for winning the\r\n    bad. He left the society of civilized men, and again repaired\r\n    to the Indians. It was under his auspices, it has since been\r\n    discovered, that the Indians were incited to attack the\r\n    property of those who were civilized; and their hostility was\r\n    especially directed by Rosas against all whom he believed would\r\n    be capable or disposed to resist his attempts at possessing\r\n    himself of despotic power. He established a camp, which had all\r\n    the privileges of a sanctuary for every malefactor of every\r\n    district, from Buenos Ayres to Upper Peru and the Cordilleras\r\n    of the Andes. His protectorate of crime was not avowed, but\r\n    it was actively exercised. It shielded the criminal from the\r\n    punishment of man, and it won impunity by the perpetration of\r\n    new atrocities upon all who were suspected by Rosas. Between\r\n    1829 and 1833, Rosas laid the foundation for that despotism\r\n    which he has since exercised. The means he employed were\r\n    worse even than the object itself, for they consisted in ‘the\r\n    organization of a band of assassins.’ I assure your lordship\r\n    there is not the slightest exaggeration in the phrase.\r\n\r\nA French writer whom we shall again have occasion to quote at the\r\nconclusion of this chapter, in explanation of the causes which lead to\r\nthat indifference to the lives of others which distinguishes the guachos,\r\ndescribes a characteristic trait of Rosas, which it is necessary to\r\nunderstand, viz.—\r\n\r\n    Every one who has visited the provinces of La Plata, and has\r\n    written about General Rosas, has spoken of his energy, his\r\n    patience, his cleverness, and his cruelty; but there is that in\r\n    him which is paramount to all his other qualities, and which\r\n    may be said to be the most prominent trait of his character,\r\n    and that is his science in mendacity, his skill in working out,\r\n    even to a most perfect system—a gigantic scheme of lying. It\r\n    is an accomplishment in which he never has been equalled, and\r\n    never can be surpassed. It would be difficult to convey an idea\r\n    of the degree to which this faculty has been developed in the\r\n    dictator of Buenos Ayres. The only explanation of his being\r\n    permitted to exercise power for such a length of time, is to be\r\n    found in this instrument of action, and which he has employed\r\n    at all times and in all places with a perseverance that cannot\r\n    but excite our wonder. Are the acts of his government denounced\r\n    to the indignation of Europe, he audaciously denies them even\r\n    to the very face of those who have been eye-witnesses to them.\r\n    Is an accusation preferred against himself, he instantly turns\r\n    it against his adversaries, and unceasingly pursues them with\r\n    it before the entire world; and this he does by means of his\r\n    journal printed in three languages, with which he inundates the\r\n    American continent, and which his agents sedulously circulate\r\n    in every part of Europe. Sustained by a dogged obstinacy which\r\n    defies all obstacles, nothing can make him deviate from the\r\n    course he has marked out for himself, and unscrupulous as to\r\n    the means, he knows that time and patience will effect for him\r\n    all that he desires. In this respect Rosas has been perfectly\r\n    consistent. At the moment in which he consecrated in his own\r\n    person a government essentially Unitarian, by effacing even the\r\n    last traces of a federation, he compelled the population, upon\r\n    pain of death, to cry out, ‘Long live the Federation!’ The same\r\n    day, on which he substituted his own will for all the codes of\r\n    the republic, he caused himself to be saluted with the title\r\n    of ‘restorer of the laws!’ Whilst his portrait was publicly\r\n    incensed in the churches, and received, by his order, divine\r\n    honours, he invoked the vengeance of heaven upon the impious\r\n    Unitarians who daily offend the Almighty. When, in fine, he let\r\n    loose, in the broad day, into the streets of Buenos Ayres,\r\n    bands of assassins, who massacred the population, he could not\r\n    find tears enough to deplore ‘this unhappy popular ebullition,\r\n    which made his paternal heart bleed!’ We do not believe that\r\n    hypocrisy and audacity ever reached to such an extreme degree\r\n    of shameless impudence. It was thus that Europe was misled as\r\n    to the real character of the events that occurred, and that it\r\n    accustomed itself to consider as the representative of peace,\r\n    and as the protector of order, commerce, and civilization, the\r\n    man who has never ceased for eighteen years to be on the banks\r\n    of La Plata, the element of sanguinary wars, of crimes, and of\r\n    violence of every kind.\r\n\r\nReverting to the case of the Kidd Family, their murder was one of the\r\nmost atrocious on record in any age or any country, considering, first,\r\nthe number, ages, and utter inoffensiveness of the victims; secondly,\r\nthe rank, motive, and perfidiousness of the assassin; and, thirdly, the\r\nwant of public virtue or spirit to resent it among the community in the\r\nmidst of whom it was perpetrated, but who had been so subdued by such\r\ndeeds amongst themselves as actually to affect indignation that strangers\r\nshould name the culprit. The object of Rosas was, under the pretext of\r\npopular hatred of foreigners, on account of the policy that was being\r\npursued by the British Government, to strike terror into the English\r\nresidents in the province and city of Buenos Ayres; so that this terror,\r\nreacting on the diplomatist, or at least upon the English cabinet, which\r\nit is now notorious that it unfortunately did, might lead to a change in\r\nthe course so obnoxious to the Dictator, because so fatal to his power of\r\ndesolating the Uruguay. The Kidds were a highly respectable English, or\r\nrather Scotch, family who resided on an estancia a short distance from\r\nthe city of Buenos Ayres, engaged, as they had been for several years,\r\nin the rearing of cattle, and neither interfering, nor being accused of\r\ninterfering, in the political disputes of the country in the smallest\r\npossible degree. They were nine in number—from the aged grandfather, to\r\nthe infant in arms. These were found one morning with their throats cut\r\nin the most barbarous and revolting, yet deliberate, manner; their bodies\r\nranged along the floor; and, in the case of two young girls about fifteen\r\nor sixteen, and remarkable for the luxuriance of their hair, their\r\ntresses were brought round the head, and tied in fantastic knots in the\r\ngashes in their throats. That the object of this bloody business was not\r\nplunder was obvious from the circumstance of there not being a particle\r\nof property removed, or the least disturbance of the furniture, and also\r\nfrom the ferocious mockery of decency exhibited in the orderly adjustment\r\nof the bodies. Of course it made a vast sensation, and it was intended\r\nthat it should do so.\r\n\r\nBut Rosas little calculated how completely the tables were about to be\r\nturned upon him, and how the engineer would be hoisted with his own\r\npetard. Every man, woman, and child in Buenos Ayres knew that the deed\r\nhad been done by Rosas’ directions, and his ‘Mashorqueros’ brigands\r\nboasted of it as the crowning audacity of their master, and one that\r\nwould soon bring the English minister to his senses. The blow, however,\r\nhad hardly been struck when it recoiled upon the author. Sir W. G.\r\nOuseley immediately offered the sum of ten thousand dollars for the\r\ndetection of the murderers; and, inviting the coöperation of all who\r\nabhorred the crime to aid in augmenting the reward for the discovery\r\nof its perpetrators, carried the list to Rosas himself, and demanded\r\nthat _he_ and his daughter, Donna Manueleta, should head it! Of course\r\nrefusal was impossible, without an open avowal of his guilt, about which\r\nno one entertained, or could entertain, a doubt. Accordingly, forth there\r\ncame, the following morning, and daily for a long time afterwards, the\r\nnames of Rosas and the British minister, and of many British inhabitants,\r\nstigmatising the outrage, and invoking vengeance on the monsters who\r\nhad effected it. But mark the result. Not only was there no detection,\r\nbut not a single Buenos Ayrean citizen, or a single person in any way\r\namenable to the power of Rosas, put down his name for a solitary rial, or\r\nwas heard to whisper a syllable of desire that the assassins should be\r\nbrought to justice. But there was no hope of anything of the kind, nor\r\nwould there ever have been as long as Rosas remained in the position he\r\nwas at the time of that villany, as well as the subsequent one alluded\r\nto in the extract, and which was more the prompting of baffled spite\r\nagainst the British minister, than with the least idea it could have had\r\nany effect of the kind intended in the direction where the Kidd massacre\r\nhad so signally failed. But ‘murder, though it hath no tongue, will speak\r\nwith most miraculous organs;’ and certainly a more strange one could\r\nhardly be than that of a ‘mashorquero’ implicating Rosas in one of the\r\ngreatest enormities of this age, and while yet there is proof sufficient\r\nto make its truth apparent even to those whom the Dictator had persuaded\r\nhe was the victim of foreign calumny. He tried this sanguinary strategy\r\nwith considerable success, on the occasion of the French intervention in\r\nBuenos Ayrean affairs, in 1842, and likewise practised it against some\r\nBritish subjects, as in the case of the midshipman alluded to in the\r\nextract from the _Times_, and also in the still more ferocious one of the\r\nmurder of Lieut. Wardlaw, the depositions of the boat’s crew, who saw him\r\nfoully butchered, when landing on the Rosista territory under a flag of\r\ntruce, having been published in full detail in the English papers soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nBut enough, and more than enough, of Rosas. Turning now to his former\r\nfriend and sometime successor, General Urquiza. Although he has been\r\nexpelled from Buenos Ayres, yet, in consequence of his having been again\r\nrechosen as President of the Confederation by all the other provinces,\r\nas well also as continuing in the position he had filled for many years\r\nas President of his native province of Entre Rios, there is little doubt\r\nthat he is destined to play again a conspicuous part on the stage of\r\nSouth American politics, especially should there be a separation of the\r\nstates into distinct and independent governments, or minor confederacies,\r\nas has frequently been proposed, and to which the position and vast\r\nextent of these regions point as a prudent course, particularly now that\r\nBuenos Ayres may be regarded as having virtually and practically ceased\r\nto be a component part of the Argentine republic. I have thought it may\r\nnot be uninteresting to the English reader to furnish some particulars\r\nof this remarkable man, and for that purpose have subjoined a condensed\r\ntranslation of a little work that has attained a great circulation in\r\nSouth America. It is entitled ‘Seis Dias con el General Urquiza, que\r\ncomprenden Muchas Noticias Sobre su Persona. El esclarcie miento de\r\nhechos importantes. Y Algunos Datos Sobre la Situacion Actual de la\r\nProvincia de Entre-Rios.’ It will be seen that it is the production of\r\na great admirer of Urquiza, and on that score will be received with\r\ndue qualification, which must be further extended to the style of the\r\nwriter, whose grandiloquent idiom has been preserved with some closeness\r\nin the translation. The principal reason, however, for giving the annexed\r\ndata is because of the picture afforded of the private life of a South\r\nAmerican chief, and, incidentally, of society in portions of that country\r\nhitherto undescribed by English travellers. I will only preface these\r\nmemoranda by saying that Urquiza is now about 54 years of age, abstains\r\nfrom wine and tobacco, and though a great admirer of beauty is still a\r\nbachelor. Since 1840 he has been president of Entre Rios, and sided with\r\nRosas during the civil war of Lavellé and Rivera, the latter of whom he\r\nrouted at the battle of Inda Muerta, in 1846. At last perceiving that the\r\ninterest of his own state was highly prejudiced by the conduct of Rosas\r\nin excluding it from all access to the ocean, he seized the opportunity\r\nwhen Rosas annually resigned the presidency of the Confederation to\r\naccept such resignation, thereby depriving the dictator of the legal\r\nauthority longer to represent and conduct the foreign relations of the\r\nConfederation. He then joined Brazil in driving Rosas and Oribe out of\r\nthe Uruguay, and subsequently out of Buenos Ayres, of which he became\r\npresident, and was himself in turn ejected from that city and state,\r\nunder the circumstances already detailed. In the translation the use of\r\nthe first personal pronoun has been retained:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIX DAYS WITH GENERAL URQUIZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI arrived at the General’s residence, which is eighteen leagues from the\r\nvillage of Gualeguachú, on the left bank of the river of that name; and,\r\nto my surprise, about that magnificent country house, where I expected\r\nto find a military encampment, full of officers, soldiers, and men in\r\nthe service of the renowned champion of Entre-Rios, a profound silence\r\nreigned, interrupted only by the blows of the axe of a rustic, who was\r\nworking upon some trees. I alighted, and entered the house. At the door\r\nof one of the apartments stood a man whom I at once recognized as the\r\nGeneral, having seen him in the Oriental Republic twenty years before. I\r\nknew him because his visage was not changed, and not because his dress\r\nmanifested anything by which I might recognise him as the supreme chief\r\nof the province of Entre-Rios. I took off my hat, but he immediately bade\r\nme follow him, and put his hand on the neck of a mastiff, which was lying\r\nat his feet. This animal is the famous Purvis,[95] the only sentinel and\r\ncompanion General Urquiza has in a spacious edifice in which five hundred\r\npersons can accommodate themselves. His only attendants are an old man\r\nwho serves him, and a coloured woman who attends to the apartments,\r\nwhere they receive the persons who daily arrive to see the General,\r\nsome in the public service, but the greater part with private objects.\r\nSome other men have occupations in the house, in the labours of his\r\nbeautiful garden, and in the indispensable services of a country mansion,\r\nwhere there reign order and the most admirable economy. The General\r\nmade me sit down, and asked me some questions, which inspired me with\r\nconfidence, at the same that his presence imposed respect. He was dressed\r\nrather negligently, covered with a light poncho of the finest vicuna,\r\nand wearing a hat of white cloth, with a coloured ribbon, which is\r\ndistinctive of the Entre-Riano army. I saw him in the same dress all the\r\ntime that I was with him. He has very little beard, nor does he wear the\r\nmoustache, so general among the military, and still worn by the peasants;\r\nbut he does not lose thereby the aspect of a warrior. He is of a very\r\nrobust constitution, has a broad and extremely prominent chest, and is\r\naltogether a remarkably well-formed man. His face preserves all the\r\nfreshness of youth, although, in my judgment, he must have been born at\r\nthe commencement of the century. He is of moderate stature, and slightly\r\ninclined to corpulence. His complexion is fair, but its bloom has been\r\nsomewhat darkened by the sun during his military career. All his features\r\nare full of expression. His mouth is small, his teeth good, his eyes of a\r\nclear grey colour, and full of fire and vivacity. They are unsteady when\r\nhe speaks, fixing themselves on every object around him, especially when\r\nhe refers to any act of extreme severity. His hair is black, and begins\r\nto fall off his clear unwrinkled forehead. His manners are frank, jovial,\r\nand cheerful, so that he predisposes in his favour all who approach him.\r\n\r\n‘Why,’ he inquired, after a brief pause, ‘have you come to this country,\r\nafter having been associated with the foreigners, who have deceived\r\nyou all, and prolonged a war which ought to have been by this time\r\nconcluded?’ ‘It is true, sir,’ I replied, ‘but past events linked\r\nthemselves by degrees, and the torrent of successes has led us’—‘Stop!\r\nyou must not say that the torrent of successes has precipitated it; you\r\nmust say that it deceived you, for men of ideas and education do not\r\npermit themselves to be led with the multitude, who observe nothing. The\r\nMonte Videans have not comprehended their own interests; they ought long\r\nsince to have settled that unfortunate question, in which so much blood\r\nhas been shed, and I am persuaded, if such were the case, things would go\r\non well, and the Orientals would not see their country destroyed.’\r\n\r\nWith these words, he rose, and went out, leaving me quite alone; so I\r\nbegan my toilette, and had the comb in my hand when he returned. ‘You do\r\nwell to adorn yourself, because you are so ugly,’ said he, in so affable\r\nand familiar a tone that it inspired me with complete confidence, for I\r\nwas already aware that such is his manner when he receives a person with\r\npleasure and good-will. I replied that, at least, I had not a crooked\r\nnose, a phrase which General Urquiza often uses, and applies to military\r\ncowards and men of small mental capacity. It is the familiar expression\r\nwhich he employs to manifest the contempt which a person deserves from\r\nhim. Dinner was now announced, and he invited those who were present to\r\ndine with him. His table is plain, but abundant; he eats very little\r\nmeat, and does not drink wine or any kind of liquors; neither does he\r\nsmoke or take snuff. His principal food, during the six days that I\r\nwas with him, was roast chicken; at supper he eats very little, and\r\nchiefly pastry, with the object, as he says, of taking a little water.\r\nAfter dinner, he remains long at the table, and talks of the events\r\nof his youth, particularly of the period when, as representative of\r\nthe people, he manifested his firmness in opposing anarchy, and had to\r\nendure a thousand vicissitudes, by which his life was often in danger,\r\nhaving once been ordered to be shot, and owed his escape to providential\r\ncauses. He speaks very often of recent events, which he details with\r\nso much exactitude that he does not forget the most trifling incident.\r\nHe never forgets the name or the features of any person he has once\r\nseen. He relates the events of the war with an impartiality which does\r\nhim honour, since he has been so conspicuous an actor in many of them.\r\n‘Do not believe,’ he said to me one day, ‘that I fail to recognise\r\nthe tendencies of the political parties who have fought for so long a\r\ntime. On both sides there have been errors, but the Monte Videans have\r\nlost by committing themselves to the drowsiness brought on by foreign\r\nintervention, and those foreigners have not comprehended what would\r\nbe beneficial to their interests; in my judgment, they have done the\r\ncontrary of what they ought to have done. There was that unfortunate\r\nGeneral Lavalle, whom I have liked, notwithstanding that he sullied the\r\nlustre of his services by serving under the Governor Dorrego; he ruined\r\nhimself by wishing to combat me without understanding the revolution. I\r\nwished to draw him from the way of his destruction, and to bring him to\r\nEntre-Rios, for he was a virtuous man; but he refused my offers, because\r\nhis political friends at that moment surrounded him. I did all I could\r\nfor him, but my duty was to conquer him. I detested the disloyalty of\r\nsome of his officers, who treacherously abandoned him, dividing one part\r\nof his army from the other, after the battle of Tucuman, and who came\r\nto Corrientes, passing through the Great Chaco. There is in Entre-Rios\r\nan officer who was faithful, who did not abandon him after the defeat\r\nof Famalla, and who accompanied him until his death. This individual\r\nis commendable for his loyalty, and I assure you that I esteem him.\r\nThe Monte Videans have much reproached me for the death of Carlos Paz,\r\nwhom, after the battle of Vences, I made a prisoner, and sent to be\r\nshot; but he deserved death, for he was a traitor, who was betraying\r\nthe Madariagas, and afterwards betrayed me. He placed himself in\r\ncommunication with me, supplying me with important information as to the\r\nstate of the Corrientine army, and certainly he was not deceiving me. He\r\ndid more still; he assured me that he would not make use of the artillery\r\nthat he was commanding, if it arrived at the commencement of a battle.\r\nBut he probably repented his perfidy, for he ceased all correspondence\r\nwith me, and on the day of the battle, confiding in the superiority of\r\nthe forces of Madariaga, and in the elements of defence which they had\r\nconcentrated in the formidable position of the potrero of Vences, the\r\nartillery which he was commanding opened a deadly fire upon my infantry.\r\nColonel Saavedra also perished after the victory: the unhappy man, when\r\nhe already had in his hands the guarantees which I had sent him, was\r\nsurprised by a force of Corrientines, whose officer beheaded him. I\r\nregret his death, but his imprudence deserved it. Thus it is that my\r\nenemies, without investigating the circumstances of the deeds, represent\r\nme as a terrible man, and write a thousand injurious censures against me.’\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, the General, speaking of the press of Monte Video,\r\nreferred to the time when Rivera Indarte used to conduct the ‘National,’\r\nand reproved the mean publications and immoral doctrines of that epoch.\r\n‘In the battle of Pago Largo,’ said he, ‘Baron Astrada met with his\r\ndeath, and, according to my enemies, I was the cause of it, and likewise\r\nof that which was done to his corpse—stripping off part of the skin\r\nof the body; and it was also published in Monte Video that I made a\r\nhorsecloth of it, and presented it to General Rosas. Abominable lie! Of\r\nthat skin nothing has been made, for it is not long since that it was\r\npreserved in Gualeguachú, in the house of D. N., in the wardrobe. Baron\r\nAstrada died in Pago Largo, as many others died, in the retreat, and the\r\nskin was drawn off from the neck to the shoulders, the first notice of\r\nwhich was given to me by M. Asumbrulla, a Brazilian, who was commissioned\r\nby General Bentos Gonzalez, a relative of General Echague, who was with\r\nme on the second or third day of the battle. There was a young soldier\r\npassing near us, at the sight of whom the Brazilian exclaimed, “See that;\r\nsee that.” I fixed my eyes on the soldier, but could not recognize in\r\nhim anything that should call forth the exclamation, until the Brazilian\r\nsaid to me, “The thing which that soldier carries hanging from the neck\r\nof his horse is the skin of the Governor of Corrientes.” I called the\r\nsoldier immediately, to inform myself of the deed.’ The General was going\r\nto continue this narration, when a peasant entered. ‘What a strange\r\ncoincidence,’ said the General; ‘here you see him who drew off the skin\r\nof Baron Astrada. Who drew off the skin of the Governor of Corrientes?’\r\nhe enquired. ‘I, sir,’ replied the peasant. ‘And who commanded you to do\r\nit?’ ‘I say no more, sir.’ ‘And what did I tell you when I called you to\r\nask what it was you carried on the neck of your horse?’ ‘That I could\r\nnot deny that I was an assassin, and that I would have been rewarded by\r\nbeing shot, but that I was very young.’ ‘And why did you declare in the\r\nBanda Oriental that I had commanded the act?’ ‘Because General Nunez, who\r\nthen served with Rivera, told me that unless I declared that it was your\r\nExcellency who had stripped the skin off the Governor of Corrientes, I\r\nshould be shot; and because I did not wish to die, I told an untruth, and\r\nsaid that your Excellency had commanded me.’ ‘And why did you declare the\r\nsame afterwards in Monte Video?’ ‘Because I apprehended that something\r\nwould happen to me.’ ‘Well,’ said the General, addressing himself to me,\r\n‘you may now perceive that this boy is a knave, who has been amongst\r\nthe uncultivated Unionites until he implored my pardon, and I granted\r\nit. You now know the history of a deed which has been attributed to me,\r\nwhen I have not had the slightest part in it. It has also been written\r\nthat I commanded all the boys who were made prisoners at Pago Largo to\r\nbe destroyed. This is false: the prisoners whom we made in that victory\r\nwere not sacrificed, although it is true that some were executed by the\r\norder which I gave, for which I had just and powerful reasons. After the\r\ndefeat, the infantry of the Corrientines retired, but I followed them\r\nwith the cavalry that I was commanding, for Don Pascual Echague was then\r\ngeneral-in-chief. I was commencing active hostilities in the retreat,\r\nwhen, seeing themselves lost, they wished to surrender, but asked for\r\nguarantees before they laid down their arms. I immediately sent them\r\nto them, but the officer who carried them was killed by the very men\r\nwho wished to capitulate. The second time the same thing was done, and\r\nI then gave more rigorous orders. They began to separate, and to seek\r\nthe mountains near hand, but all were made prisoners, and consequently\r\nI had to chastise the perfidy. The investigation made resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of those who were the authors of the murders, and those only I\r\ncommanded to be shot. This is the truth; and if my enemies and the Monte\r\nVideans have said to the contrary, and have written slanders against me,\r\nI look upon them with scorn. There has been here one of those who in\r\nMonte Video was a fabricator of impostures, who used to say that I was\r\na Gaucho, and my mother a Chinese woman. I have had him in my presence,\r\nand I have asked him if I really was a Gaucho, and why he was guilty of\r\nsuch falsehoods; and, as is natural, he found himself confounded, without\r\nknowing what to say in reply. This individual is now in Entre-Rios, and\r\nhas no reason to repent having come, for I have done something for him,\r\nas I do for all who come to this country.’\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation, the General retired, and I remained alone,\r\nmeditating upon what I had heard. The account which he had given me of\r\nthe unfortunate Baron Astrada was to me interesting, for it removed from\r\nmy mind the error under which I was labouring until that moment, and I\r\nsaw with satisfaction General Urquiza exonerated from an atrocious act.\r\n\r\nWhen General Urquiza speaks of deeds such as those which I have here\r\ndetailed, he gives to his voice an accent, and to his action an\r\nexpression, so vivid, that it impresses on his words the seal of truth,\r\nand manifests, to whoever observes him, that he is not one of those men\r\nwho, because they have power, hold in contempt the judgment of their\r\ncotemporaries. General Urquiza likes to preserve a good reputation, and\r\nhas respect for public opinion. He prefers to govern from retirement to\r\nbeing surrounded by the trophies of his victories and the insignia of his\r\npower. Morality and education are his special care, and a magnificent\r\nedifice is being erected under his directions, to be called the\r\nEntre-Riano College. Nothing proves more completely that the tendencies\r\nof General Urquiza are towards progress than the interest which he takes\r\nin the education of the people.\r\n\r\nEducation is completely disseminated, and the most convenient system for\r\naccelerating the progress of early instruction has been adopted. There is\r\nno country district which has not a school sustained by the treasury of\r\nthe province, to which fathers are under the obligation of sending their\r\nsons. These establishments are independent of those that are in all the\r\ntowns, and are under the immediate supervision of the local magistrates.\r\nTheir purpose is the instruction of those children whose parents live in\r\nthe scattered villages, far away from the towns. With this system there\r\nwill, in a short time, be few persons destitute of the rudiments of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n‘Entre-Rios,’ said General Urquiza one day, ‘receives all men, whatever\r\nmay be their origin, their opinions, and their political antecedents;\r\nthey will be respected, and even favoured, if their tendencies are\r\ntowards goodness, and they do not interfere in our affairs. I wish from\r\nthose who come to this land only respect for the established authorities,\r\nand the observance of the laws. The Unionites, French, English, all may\r\ncome to Entre-Rios, to pass through our villages, to cross over our\r\ncountry in all directions, and to establish themselves where they wish,\r\nin the assurance that they will not hear a single voice raised against\r\nthem which might cause the slightest offence. I wish to be at peace\r\nwith all, and will provoke no one; but he that incites me will find me\r\ndisposed to fight in defence of my country. The Entre-Riano army is\r\nvaliant, and has proved itself capable of great things, and I have great\r\nconfidence in its valour and its enthusiasm.’\r\n\r\nThe army of Entre-Rios embraces from nine to ten thousand men of the\r\nthree arms, but its principal force consists in the cavalry. This is\r\ncomposed of eleven divisions, corresponding to the departments into which\r\nthe province is divided, which, although I have no data upon the extent\r\nof the territory of Entre-Rios, ought, I think, to comprise a little\r\nmore or less than 5,000 square leagues. The cavalry, in times of peace,\r\nis completely liberated, and a portion is employed in the police of\r\nthe departments. When the army returns from any campaign, it lays down\r\nits arms and disbands, with the understanding that, at the slightest\r\nrumour of a military summons, they are to present themselves with their\r\nuniforms, and the cavalry with their horses. It is an undoubted fact\r\nthat, in six or seven days after the issue of the first order from the\r\nGeneral’s quarters, for the reunion of the army, it can be completely\r\nreunited, armed, clothed, perfectly equipped, and in readiness to march,\r\nso that General Urquiza, with the Entre-Riano army, can be in front of\r\nthe city of Monte Video in twenty or twenty-two days after issuing the\r\nfirst orders for its reunion, notwithstanding the difficulties presented\r\nby the majestic river Uruguay. With such troops it is not strange that\r\nGeneral Urquiza should have obtained such signal victories.\r\n\r\n‘The battle of Vences,’ said the General, ‘is an affair which does great\r\nhonour to the Entre-Riano army, which had to combat powerful enemies,\r\nand yet penetrated to where the Corrientines were not expecting it.\r\nThey were astonished and terrified at the courage of my soldiers, who\r\npenetrated through immense morasses and difficulties which the enemies\r\nplaced in their way; and I can assure you that I myself was astonished\r\nby the magnitude of the dangers which we encountered, and the obstacles\r\nwhich we overcame. This daring gave us the victory, as the army of\r\nMadariaga was superior to mine in its number, and particularly in\r\ninfantry and artillery.’ On another occasion, the General entertained me\r\nwith interesting details of the campaign in the Oriental Republic, in\r\nwhich he manifested a degree of activity and skill which has done him\r\ngreat credit, for, though he had to combat in a land unknown to him, the\r\nvictory was his, and was a work exclusively of his own inspiration. These\r\ndetails convince me that the General is a man of great penetration, and\r\nof elevated capacity, so that he has been known to foresee many events\r\nwhich have prolonged the war, and upon which he looks as the origin of\r\nmany evils.\r\n\r\n‘I have the satisfaction of knowing,’ he observed, ‘that the army of\r\nEntre-Rios has been a model of morality and subordination, and that there\r\nhave been few complaints of it. I have acted throughout from conviction,\r\nand the public accounts will show that I have not taken a single dollar\r\nfor my own use, not even the pay to which my rank of general entitled\r\nme. On the contrary, the treasury of the province is indebted to me in\r\nthe sum of 30,000 dollars, the amount of debts contracted in the public\r\nservice, and which I have yet to pay. From the Oriental country I have\r\nbrought nothing but compromises and this dog,’ pointing to the mastiff,\r\nPurvis, which was lying at his feet. ‘It is true he is a wicked animal,\r\nfor he respects no one but me, and even those who feed him are not\r\ncertain that he will not leave his food to bite them; but in me he seems\r\nto recognize a certain superiority. He has his history and his instincts\r\nwhich I cannot comprehend, and which no one will ever be able to explain.\r\nHe belonged to Colonel Galazza, but suddenly attached himself to me, and\r\nwould not be driven away. Seeing the pertinacity with which he persisted\r\nin following me, I allowed him to remain, and he has never left me since,\r\nrunning by the side of my horse throughout the campaigns of the Banda\r\nOriental and Corrientes. He manifests no terror under fire, and when\r\nstruck by a spent cannon-ball at India Muerto, and hurled several yards\r\nfrom me, he quickly recovered his legs, and resumed his post by my side!’\r\n\r\nThe superficial character of Entre Rios being that of an extensive plain,\r\nwatered by numerous rivers, and affording excellent and abundant pasture\r\nfor cattle, not equal to that of the beautiful territory of the Oriental\r\nrepublic, but superior to that of the province of Buenos Ayres, General\r\nUrquiza is so sensible of the advantage of promoting the breeding of\r\ncattle that he will not permit the killing of cows; but this prohibition\r\nis not absolute, depending on the number belonging to each individual;\r\nand while far from being a real grievance to the land-owners, it will\r\ntend to greatly increase the wealth and importance of the country. This\r\nis the general’s great aim, his whole policy being directed to the\r\ndevelopment of the natural resources of the country.\r\n\r\nThe frequent allusions in the foregoing to the sanguinary practices\r\npursued by rival chiefs against each other suggests the desirability of\r\nendeavouring to account for the creation and growth of the disposition\r\nto which such ferocity is attributable. We cannot do better than quote\r\nthe words of M. Chevalier de St. Robert, a Frenchman, officially engaged\r\nin the affairs of the Plate, who, in his pamphlet, entitled _Le General\r\nRosas et la Question de la Plata_, and translated by M’Cabe, the late\r\nActing Consul-General for the Uruguay in London, gives probably the best\r\naccount anywhere to be met with of life in the wilds, in this region of\r\nthe world, and of the mode in which such life affects humanity in the\r\ncities afterwards. He says:—\r\n\r\n    The population of the Pampas have a peculiar physiognomy, such\r\n    as is to be found in no other part of the world. They exhibit\r\n    the instincts and the faculties which the desert every where\r\n    developes, but still they have not those traits which elsewhere\r\n    particularise a pastoral or a warlike tribe. The Arab, who\r\n    dwells or wanders in the deserts of Asia, is but a fraction of\r\n    that great Mahommedan society that dwells in cities. The tribe\r\n    coincides with society in many things, it has the same creed,\r\n    the same obedience to religious dogmas, and preserves every\r\n    where the same traditional organization. There is nothing like\r\n    this to be found in the Pampas. In the bosom of those immense\r\n    plains, which extend from Salta to the Cordilleras, that is,\r\n    over a space of more than seven hundred leagues, there are\r\n    to be found neither distinct castes, nor tribes, nor creeds,\r\n    nor even that which may be properly called a nation. There is\r\n    nothing to be found but _estançias_ (farms) scattered here\r\n    and there, which form so many petty republics, isolated from\r\n    the rest of the world, living by themselves, and separated\r\n    from each other by the desert. Alone in the midst of those\r\n    over whom he is a complete master, the _estanciero_ is out of\r\n    every kind of society whatsoever, with no other law than that\r\n    of force, with no other rules to guide him but those that are\r\n    self-imposed, and with no other motive to influence him than\r\n    his own caprice. There is nothing to disturb his repose, to\r\n    dispute his power, or interfere with his tranquillity except\r\n    the tiger that may lurk about his grounds, or the wild Indians\r\n    that may occasionally make a hostile incursion on his domains.\r\n    His children and his domestics, _gauchos_ like himself, pass\r\n    the same sort of life, that is to say, without ambition,\r\n    without desires, and without any species of agricultural\r\n    labour. All they have to do is to mark and to kill, at\r\n    certain periods, the herds of oxen and flocks of sheep which\r\n    constitute the fortune of the _estanciero_, and that satisfy\r\n    the wants of all. Purely carnivorous, the gaucho’s only food\r\n    consists of flesh and water—bread and spirituous liquors are\r\n    as much unknown to him as the simplest elements of social\r\n    life. In a country in which the only wealth of the inhabitants\r\n    arises from the incessant destruction of innumerable flocks,\r\n    it can be easily understood how their sanguinary occupation\r\n    must tend to obliterate every sentiment of pity, and induce\r\n    an indifference to the perpetration of acts of cruelty. The\r\n    readiness to shed blood—a ferocity which is at the same time\r\n    obdurate and brutal—constitutes the prominent feature in the\r\n    character of the pure _gaucho_. The first instrument that the\r\n    infantile hand of the gaucho grasps is the knife—the first\r\n    things that attract his attention as a child, are the pouring\r\n    out of blood, and the palpitating flesh of expiring animals.\r\n    From his earliest years, as soon as he is able to walk, he is\r\n    taught how he may with the greatest skill approach the living\r\n    beast, hough it, and if he has the strength, kill it. Such\r\n    are the sports of his childhood—he pursues them ardently,\r\n    and amid the approving smiles of his family. As soon as he\r\n    acquires sufficient strength, he takes part in the labours of\r\n    the estancia; they are the sole arts he has to study, and he\r\n    concentrates all his intellectual powers in mastering them.\r\n    From that time forth he arms himself with a large knife, and\r\n    for a single moment of his life he never parts with it. It\r\n    is to his hand an additional limb—he makes use of it always,\r\n    in all cases, in every circumstance, and constantly with\r\n    wonderful skill and address. The same knife that in the morning\r\n    had been used to slaughter a bullock, or to kill a tiger,\r\n    aids him in the day time to cut his dinner, and at night to\r\n    carve out a skin tent, or else to repair his saddle, or to\r\n    mend his mandoline. With the gaucho the knife is often used\r\n    as an argument in support of his opinions. In the midst of a\r\n    conversation apparently carried on in amity, the formidable\r\n    knife glitters on a sudden in the hands of one of the speakers,\r\n    the _ponchos_ are rolled around the left arm, and a conflict\r\n    commences. Soon deep gashes are seen on the face, the blood\r\n    gushes forth, and not unfrequently one of the combatants falls\r\n    lifeless to the earth; but no one thinks of interfering with\r\n    the combat, and when it is over the conversation is resumed as\r\n    if nothing extraordinary had occurred. No person is disturbed\r\n    by it—not even the women, who remain as cold unmoved spectators\r\n    of the affray! It may easily be surmised what sort of persons\r\n    they must be, of which such a scene is but a specimen of their\r\n    domestic manners. Thus the savage education of the estancia\r\n    produces in the gaucho a complete indifference as to human\r\n    life, by familiarizing him from his most tender years to\r\n    the contemplation of a violent death, whether it is that he\r\n    inflicts it on another or receives it himself. He lifts his\r\n    knife against a man with the same indifference that he strikes\r\n    down a bullock: the idea which everywhere else attaches to the\r\n    crime of homicide does not exist in his mind; for in slaying\r\n    another he yields not less to habit than to the impulse of his\r\n    wild and barbarous nature. If, perchance, a murder of this\r\n    kind is committed so close to a town that there is reason to\r\n    apprehend the pursuit of justice, every one is eager to favour\r\n    the flight of the guilty person. The fleetest horse is at his\r\n    service, and he departs certain to find wherever he goes the\r\n    favour and sympathy of all. Then, with that marvellous instinct\r\n    which is common to all the savage races, he feels no hesitation\r\n    in venturing into the numerous plains of the pampas. Alone, in\r\n    the midst of a boundless desert, and in which the eye strains\r\n    itself in vain to discover a boundary, he advances without the\r\n    slightest feeling of uneasiness—he does so watching the course\r\n    of the stars, listening to the winds, watching, interrogating,\r\n    discovering the cause of the slightest noise that reaches his\r\n    ears, and he at length arrives at the place he sought, without\r\n    ever straying for it, even for a moment. The _lasso_ which is\r\n    rolled around his horse’s neck: the _bolas_ suspended to his\r\n    saddle, and the inseparable knife suffice to assure him food,\r\n    and to secure him against every danger—even against the tiger.\r\n    When he is hungry, he selects one out of the herd of beeves\r\n    that cover the plain, pursues it, _lassos_ it, kills it, cuts\r\n    out of it a piece of flesh, which he eats raw, or cooks, and\r\n    thus refreshes himself for the journey of the following day. If\r\n    murder be a common incident in the life of a gaucho, it often\r\n    also becomes the means to him of emerging from obscurity, and\r\n    of obtaining renown amongst his associates. When a gaucho has\r\n    rendered himself remarkable by his audacity and address in\r\n    single combats, companions gather around him, and he soon finds\r\n    himself at the head of a considerable party. He ‘commences a\r\n    campaign,’ sets himself in open defiance to the laws, and in a\r\n    short time acquires a celebrity which rallies a crowd about him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUP THE PARANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nUP THE PARANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Preparations for an experimental trip up the Parana.—Captain\r\n    Sullivan’s descent of the river at a terrific pace.—Island\r\n    of Martin Garcia.—Note on the confluents of the Rio Plata.—A\r\n    Scotch experimental philosopher in Corrientes.—Alluvial\r\n    deposits at the delta of the Parana.—Signs of progress in\r\n    the interior.—An American pioneer of civilization.—The\r\n    steamer aground, and fired upon.—Moonlight on the river\r\n    and the woods.—Geographical note on the Parana and the Rio\r\n    Plata.—Obligado and San Nicolas.—Mr. Mackinnon’s description of\r\n    the scenery.—Arrival at Rosario.—Multifarious applications of\r\n    hides and horns.—Descent of the river, and arrival at Martin\r\n    Garcia.—Corrientes and the guachos.—Military system of the\r\n    country.—Its evil effects on the morals and industry of the\r\n    people.—Grazing capabilities of Corrientes.—Facilities and\r\n    prospects for commerce.—Interest of the Platine provinces in\r\n    the opening of the river to foreign trade.—Difficulties of the\r\n    navigation, and a word about the Uruguay.\r\n\r\nThe important light in which England, and, yet more especially, those\r\nportions of England to whose mercantile wants the company I represented\r\nadminister, regarded the opening of the great confluents of the Plate,\r\nparticularly those leading to the famed fairyland of Paraguay, so long\r\nguarded by the wondrous Ogre, Francia, naturally rendered me anxious\r\nto follow, for however trifling a distance, in the wake the French and\r\nBritish ministers had so lately pursued towards the capital of that\r\nmystic country which, after almost half a century’s total isolation from\r\nthe rest of the world, they have brought into commercial relationship\r\nwith Europe. Accordingly, though not contemplating anything of the kind\r\non leaving Liverpool, I gladly availed myself of certain favourable\r\ncircumstances that turned up somewhat unexpectedly, to make a short\r\nexperimental trip up the Parana, as far as the towns of San Nicolas and\r\nRosario, although for so doing time was very short, as the Argentina\r\nhad to be back at Monte Video to meet the Brazileira, expected out from\r\nLiverpool, _viâ_ Rio Janeiro, on the 28th or 29th of September. The\r\ncommanders of H.M. ships Vixen and Locust gave us valuable information,\r\nand kindly recommended an experienced pilot, whom I engaged. The British\r\nVice-consul at Buenos Ayres, Mr. Parish—a name of long-recognized Anglo\r\ninfluence in those regions, as the mention of his relative, the veteran\r\nSir Woodbine, and of _his_ relatives, Messrs. Parish Robinson, the\r\nauthors of the delightful ‘Letters from Paraguay,’ will sufficiently\r\nvouch—also obliged us with the loan of some admirable charts published\r\nunder sanction of the Admiralty, from surveys made by Captain Sullivan of\r\nH.M. ship Philomel, and these, so far as our observation extended, proved\r\nto be wonderfully correct.[96] Of course, in an extensive navigation of\r\nthis kind, with shifting sands, there will be occasionally variations\r\nof depth of water, but nothing to alter the general character of the\r\nsurvey, or the correctness of the gallant officer’s explorations and\r\nsoundings. We left Buenos Ayres at 1 p.m. on the 21st, with a pleasant\r\nparty on board, and steamed across to Martin Garcia, where the navigation\r\nbecomes difficult, and the channel very narrow. This rather large island,\r\ncomposed of granite rocks with a good elevation, and entirely commanding\r\nthe channel of the great rivers, has long been a disputed point among\r\nthe belligerents in the Plate, and among the diplomatists on paper,\r\nfor only lately has the free navigation of the rivers been recognized;\r\nbut a good deal of ill-feeling still exists with reference to its\r\npossession, belonging, as it does, ostensibly to Buenos Ayres, though it\r\nis stated that, if everyone had their own, it is really the property of\r\nan individual from whom it was forcibly taken, on the principle so very\r\nextensively practised in this quarter of the globe, that might gives\r\nright, and that there is nothing wrong but the want of means to defend\r\nit. One thing is certain, that whoever holds Martin Garcia will control\r\nthe entrance to and exit from the whole stream above it;[97] for, as the\r\nonly navigable channel runs close past it, there is no possible means\r\nof escaping the guns of its batteries. Thus, it is obvious, that the\r\nfuture progress of commerce up these immense rivers, as also, in a very\r\ngreat degree, the well-being of the countries watered by them, is really\r\ndependent on the way in which this important point is disposed of.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is impossible to look back on the policy pursued by former\r\nrulers of Buenos Ayres without the deepest regret that the navigation\r\nof such noble rivers, and the development of so fine a country, should\r\nhave been subjected to such miserable trammels, or their destinies\r\nbeen placed in hands so unworthy of the bounties that Providence had\r\nshowered upon them. There cannot be a doubt, that if a liberal-minded,\r\ncommon-sense view of things had been taken by the rulers of the city and\r\nprovince, after their emancipation from Spain, at this moment fleets of\r\nsteamers would be navigating the rivers, and a countless population be\r\nsettled in the upper countries watered by them. It would be, in fact, the\r\nvalley of a southern Mississippi, vying with its northern counterpart in\r\neverything that could contribute to the prosperity and grandeur of an\r\nimmense continent. Even comparatively short as the time has been since\r\nthe destinies of this part of South America were under native control,\r\nit is sufficient to have turned a barren waste into a land teeming with\r\nriches and abundance—a fact indisputable, and which must be evident to\r\nthe most cursory observer. But, alas! the gifts of Providence have\r\nbeen bestowed in vain: the ‘dog in the manger’ principle has been\r\nbeautifully illustrated; and, unless a stronger power and a stronger\r\narm than that which exists in the country be brought to bear, the long\r\nnight of Egyptian darkness may otherwise even still prevail. Amongst the\r\nnumerous conflicting statements and opinions, as to what policy shall be\r\ncarried out, it is difficult to ascertain who are really the stop-gaps\r\nin a work of this kind. There can be no question that the barbarous\r\npolicy of Rosas was virtually to close the rivers; and the wonder is,\r\nthat he did not effectually destroy the entrances, which he might easily\r\nhave done by sinking vessels laden with stone in the channel off Martin\r\nGarcia. His object, as everyone knows, was to reduce the upper provinces\r\nto a state of complete dependence on the city, towards which end the\r\nequally barbarous but much more romantic, and, perhaps, more justifiable,\r\ndespotism of Dr. Francia materially aided. Latterly, a feeling seems to\r\nbe gaining ground in the provinces, that the navigation of their rivers\r\nand the promotion of immigration, are objects of importance; and, once\r\nthis is backed by free and uncontrolled navigation, things will advance\r\nrapidly. The late mission of Sir Charles Hotham and the Chevalier St.\r\nGeorge is one of the means to such end; and their treaty with Paraguay\r\nmust, sooner or later, bring forth its fruits, especially if a real\r\ncession of Martin Garcia forms part of the arrangements stipulated.\r\nConsiderable jealousy still exists on this point; but there are the\r\ninterests of a mighty continent and of civilized Europe against the\r\npetty pride of a people who have not yet learned even to govern or take\r\ncare of themselves; and desperate diseases require strong remedies. In\r\nthe hands of nautical parties, with the guarantee of the most powerful\r\nnations of Europe and America, Martin Garcia would soon be rendered the\r\nnucleus of commerce extending from thence to the shores of the Pacific;\r\nthe channels and entrances would be properly buoyed and lighted under\r\nsome equitable tax on shipping, and countless fleets would soon be\r\npassing backwards and forwards. Unless something of this kind is done,\r\nlocal dissensions between provinces will always mar the general good.\r\nMoreover, a considerable outlay of money is absolutely required to render\r\nthe navigation safe and practical; and where is that to come from, except\r\nthrough the now almost sole machinery of all revenue in these regions—the\r\ncustoms, which foreign shipping, and abundance of it, can alone furnish\r\nto the smallest respectable amount?\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable pioneers of the present day, in connection\r\nwith the development of the river navigation and of the upper provinces,\r\nis an American citizen, Mr. Hopkins, who, with all the characteristic\r\nardour and discerning forethought of his country, in seizing upon ‘fresh\r\nfields and pastures new,’ wherever the spirit of commerce is likely\r\nto find the smallest resting-place for the sole of its foot, had just\r\nleft Buenos Ayres for Assumption, in a steamer, with various kinds of\r\nmachinery on board for establishing manufactories in the Paraguayan\r\nmetropolis. One of these is for the preparation of cigars for the\r\nEuropean and North American markets, on the plan pursued at the Havannah.\r\nThere are not less than fourteen or fifteen different descriptions of\r\ntobacco grown in Paraguay, each of its kind pronounced by connoisseurs,\r\nto whom samples have been submitted in England, to be superior to\r\ncorresponding qualities produced elsewhere, whether for the purposes\r\nof snuff or smoking. On the score of its tobacco alone, therefore, the\r\nopening of intercourse with Paraguay is calculated to prove a boon to\r\nmany a used-up Sybarite, pining dyspeptically for a new pleasure. Mr.\r\nHopkins also, I understand, contemplates improvements in the preparation\r\nof the famous Paraguay tea, maté, that will, if possible, enhance its\r\npopularity throughout South America, where there is scarcely a meal in\r\na house with the least pretentions to respectability or refinement in\r\nwhich the beverage is not introduced; and elegance and adroitness in\r\nsipping it, through a tube or reed, something after the fashion adopted\r\nin the Yankee beverage, known as sherry-cobbler, affords scarcely less\r\nopportunity at a _tertullia_, or evening party, for the display of\r\nbreeding than does the use of the fan in Spain. The taste of maté is not\r\nat all dissimilar to that of green tea, but without the acrid flavour\r\nof the Chinese infusion; and it is not improbable that Mr. Hopkins may\r\nrender it a very acceptable addition to our drinks in this country; for\r\nit would, at least, form an agreeable variety to the somewhat limited\r\nrange of compounds now in vogue among our temperance preachers and\r\npractitioners. Mr. Hopkins is the head of an enterprising and affluent\r\njoint-stock company, formed some few years ago in the States, who have\r\nalready expended considerable funds in the prosecution of South American\r\nenterprise of this nature, undeterred by the wreck of a fine vessel they\r\nwere bringing out, called ‘El Paraguay,’ which was condemned and sold\r\nat Maranham. He is one of those rare, indomitable spirits who often\r\nrevolutionize countries without benefiting themselves; and this I should\r\nmuch fear, and deeply deplore, would be his case now, unless, indeed,\r\nafter having been so long buffeted by the billows of mishap, he now at\r\nlength ride on the tide of regenerate Paraguay, and ‘share the triumph\r\nand partake the gale’ of its prosperity, which is seemingly soon to come.\r\nHe has spent many years in that extraordinary country;[98] been four\r\ntimes backwards and forwards; travelled on horseback some 36,000 miles!\r\nand his whole life, in short, has been a romance, as wonderful in reality\r\namong real inhabitants of an almost unknown planet, as was the apocryphal\r\nexistence of the imaginative Mr. Herman Melville among his ideal Omoos\r\nand phantasmagoric Typees of the Marquesas and the South Sea Islands.\r\nHe is a great favourite of the present Governor of Paraguay, M. Lopez;\r\nand he will confer immense benefit on mankind if he succeeds in still\r\nfurther developing those commercial and philanthropic ideas of which\r\nthe mind of the governor has shown itself so creditably susceptible, by\r\ndespatching to Europe his two sons, and a large suite, to reciprocate\r\nthe overtures towards mercantile cordiality proffered by Lord Malmesbury\r\nand the imperial government of France [see chapter on Paraguay]. If any\r\nperson can carry such highly desirable points as we have adverted to,\r\nMr. Hopkins appears the man to complete, by personal interposition,\r\nand personal explanation of the workings of the commercial system in\r\ncommercial countries, those purposes that were intended by the framers of\r\nthe Malmesbury treaty, and in the carrying out of which North America has\r\nnearly as great an interest as France, or England itself. At all events,\r\nwe must hope for the best. But, meanwhile, it is time that we proceed\r\nwith our trip to Rosario.\r\n\r\nAs we approached Martin Garcia, we saw near it two or three small vessels\r\nat anchor, and there appeared to be a roughly-built fort on shore, where\r\nthe Argentine flag was flying, in salutation of which we hoisted our\r\ncolours. We thought we heard the report of a musket or two on land, but\r\nsupposed it was the mere shooting of some idlers for amusement, and\r\nso steamed quickly past; when, to our great astonishment, a ball came\r\nwhistling over us from a small schooner at anchor under the island,\r\nfollowed by a second, that fell short. We were in the narrowest part of\r\nthe channel, impossible to bring to, or even stop with safety; and, owing\r\nto the confusion caused by this unexpected salute, the steamer grounded\r\non a spit, from which we soon backed her off, and continued our route,\r\nbeing anxious to get into the mouth of the river before sunset, now fast\r\napproaching. When the second shot was fired we immediately hoisted the\r\nArgentine flag, and these punctilious representatives of ‘confederated\r\ndignity’ did not fire again, and we were soon out of their reach if they\r\nwere disposed for the exaction of any further deference beyond what\r\nwe had already paid. An hour brought us to what is called the Boca de\r\nGuasa, one of the chief entrances to the great river, up which we were\r\nsoon steaming, guided by the banks, wooded nearly the whole distance.\r\nBefore midnight a thick fog came on, which compelled us to drop anchor\r\nuntil about 2 P.M., when we resumed our silent course, aided by a late\r\nmoon, the effect of which, as seen on this waste of waters, surpassed\r\nanything I remember to have experienced elsewhere; for the solitude of\r\nriver navigation differs from the loneliness of ocean sailing, inasmuch\r\nas in the former case you _feel_ there is land-life around you, and\r\nwhere you feel that it is _not_, as in this instance, the depression is\r\ncorrespondingly great. In traversing the ocean, however still, there is\r\nalways a sense of animation and vivacity, and the consciousness that you\r\nare in the pathway of intercommunication with your kind. But in pursuing\r\na vast river of this sort, through a country superabounding in every\r\nelement calculated to sustain the densest population on the face of the\r\nglobe, and knowing all the while that population there is almost none,\r\nyou are bowed down by a conviction of the insignificance of man’s efforts\r\nto effect any radical change in nature; for the European voyager here is\r\ndeprived of the buoyant pride and hopeful expectancy that sustain the\r\nexplorer of hitherto undiscovered seas or countries; and, gloomily, but\r\nnaturally, his mind reverts to the early navigators of these rivers—their\r\nmighty achievements, and the little results that had followed them—a\r\nlapse of four centuries leaving things here pretty much as they were\r\nwhen the first European flag floated upon this now placid and majestic\r\nstream.[99]\r\n\r\nThese are sentiments, however, which the reader may naturally think\r\nare not very pertinent to a purpose like the present, and not exactly\r\nin keeping with an occasion expressly connected with the commercial\r\nopening-up of those streams by the instrumentality of English enterprise,\r\nin a form so indicative of progress as steam. So, too, thought the\r\nwriter, after a moment’s rumination of the ‘cud of sweet and bitter\r\nfancy;’ for he reflected that these magnificent regions, first discovered\r\nby Cabot—English, born and bred, though of Venetian parentage—had\r\nstagnated, not under the rule of the countrymen of that ‘good olde\r\nand famuse man,’ but under the rule of those in whose service he had\r\nfound out a river which might, indeed, have proved worthy of the name\r\nthe avaricious Spaniards had bestowed upon it—La Plata, the River of\r\nSilver—had they been imbued with a particle of the spirit which has\r\nconverted ‘icy Labrador,’ the first territory discovered by the same\r\nglorious adventurer, into a comparatively industrial paradise. I augured,\r\nI hope with no unjustifiable audacity, that now the descendants of Cabot\r\nand of his companions had been brought into direct relationship with the\r\npeople of the Parana, something would be done to render that ‘Mississippi\r\nof the South’ not altogether unworthy of some slight social and political\r\ncomparison with the Northern ‘Father of Waters’ before many more\r\ngenerations should roll by; and I deemed it a not altogether impossible\r\ncontingency that the younger members of our crew might live to cast\r\nanchor in certain riverine ports hereabouts, amid a forest of masts and\r\nfunnels belonging to all the maritime states in the world, not one of\r\nwhich countries but may find produce of some kind or other profitably\r\nsuitable to its markets on these fertile shores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAN NICOLAS DE LOS ARROYOS, ON THE PARANA.]\r\n\r\nThe turns and windings of the Parana, all along the portion now being\r\npassed over, and indeed nearly throughout its entire length, are\r\nnumerous, without at all impeding the navigation, being, in many parts,\r\nsufficiently wide and imposing to justify its native appellation of\r\nParana Guazú, or Sea River. After daylight, fog and mist again enveloped\r\nus, but we were enabled to continue our course, guided by trees,\r\nprofusely growing, and which, on the low grounds, are chiefly of the\r\nwillow species. We passed Obligado, on whose high bank Rosas erected\r\nthose batteries to dispute the passage of the convoy under protection of\r\nthe French and English vessels of war, which were, as we have seen, of so\r\nvery little avail. The scenery around Obligado is pretty, and was more so\r\nas we proceeded—occasional lofty banks covered with verdure—estançias,\r\nand cattle grazing about. This interest was heightened as we approached\r\nSan Nicolas,[100] which is one of the first towns of consequence, situate\r\non a shelving bank, where a troop of Argentine cavalry were bivouacked;\r\nand as they came galloping down to the water’s edge, their gay-coloured\r\ndresses, scarlet ponchos, and glittering equipments reflected against\r\nthe bright green grass, the effect was highly picturesque and animated.\r\nHere we landed, took in a small quantity of fire-wood on trial, and\r\nwent to call on the Juiz da Paz, and other authorities. I had a ramble\r\nover the town, which is _intended_ to be large: streets laid out in\r\nthe usual Spanish right-angled triangle mode, but the sites of future\r\nmansions, castles in the air, veritable _casas en Espagna_, dotted with\r\nonly unfinished straggling houses here and there, with dozens of what\r\nlooked like Irish cabins stretching around, the Hibernian and Hispaniolan\r\nidentity being here developed as strongly as any member of the Celtic\r\nAntiquarian Society can desire. The solitary church of this city, as\r\nthe local hidalgos insist on designating the place, has been almost\r\ndestroyed by an explosion of gunpowder, which did great mischief to every\r\nbuilding but the house itself where the catastrophe originated. A Buenos\r\nAyrean brig and steamer of war were at anchor here, from the commanders\r\nof whom we received a degree of attention and civility that altogether\r\nobliterated any resentful reminiscence which our preceding rough\r\nreception might have awakened. The commander of the steamer, Muratore,\r\nspoke English well, and expressed himself very indignant at the treatment\r\nwe had experienced at Martin Garcia, which, he said, they were wholly\r\nunwarranted in practising; adding, that he would report such conduct to\r\nthe chief of the naval forces at head quarters. There is very deep water\r\nhere, from ten to twelve fathoms, with muddy bottom, and it took us half\r\nan hour to get up our anchor, after which we steamed on towards Rosario,\r\nthrough a country increasing in cultivation and teeming in verdure every\r\nmile we advanced; and it was not difficult to realize the accuracy of\r\nMr. Mackinnon’s description of the topography hereabouts, in the annexed\r\npassage, which appears to me to be fully deserving of the prominence of\r\nconspicuous type:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORRIENTES ON THE PARANA.]\r\n\r\n‘Our progress this day was remarkable for the beautiful scenery on the\r\nside of the Banda Oriental. The view was similar to that which is seen\r\nwhen sailing from Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, to Cowes, (without the high\r\nland,) and about the same width of water. In the afternoon, we entered a\r\nlabyrinth of islands, which contracted the channel considerably. As we\r\nadvanced, the scenery was very much varied; sometimes between islands\r\nso close together, that we shot birds and animals on each shore. These\r\nislands are plentifully interspersed with the date palm, which had a\r\nmost beautiful appearance; and, when we drew out near the main land, the\r\nstream widened considerably. We passed either bold, bluff barrancas, over\r\nwhich nothing was visible, and whence we might easily have been picked\r\noff by musketry; or a gently sloping green pasture down to the river’s\r\nmargin, dotted with horned cattle, horses, and sometimes ostriches and\r\ndeer. Clumps of trees were interspersed, and beautifully grouped by\r\nthe hand of Nature. Sometimes, for a short distance, a dense forest of\r\nlarge timber-trees impeded the view. A high sand-bank then intervened,\r\nwith a belt (about fifty yards broad) of trees and shrubs, where I often\r\nstopped to rest the men, and then surveyed the country, which was mainly\r\ncharacterized by undulating pasture land, interspersed with coppices and\r\nclumps of trees, stretching inland as far as the eye could reach, and\r\ncompletely covered by animal life in great variety, like a very extensive\r\nand well-kept park in England. The only thing wanting to make this the\r\nmost enchanting scene in the world, was the presence of civilized man;\r\nbut, alas! the brute creation alone enjoyed the terrestrial paradise. As\r\nwe advanced, we every now and then perceived deer come down fearlessly to\r\ndrink. Pheasants walked quietly along the banks, or sat in the trees in\r\nfancied security, five and six, and even more together. The partridges,\r\nboth large and small, constantly rose close to the boat; whilst numerous\r\ncarpinchas sat quietly on their haunches, like Brobdignag brown\r\nguinea-pigs, staring at us with the most perfect unconcern. Here was a\r\nsituation for a sportsman!’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSARIO—ON THE PARANA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARETAS DE VIAGE—TRAVELLING WAGGONS.]\r\n\r\nExtensive farms and cattle-grazing districts were seen along the heights,\r\nand we were told that a large number of wealthy landowners resided\r\nbetween San Nicolas and Rosario. The opposite bank of the river (Entre\r\nRios) is low and swampy, but well lined with trees. As the sun was\r\nsetting in splendid tranquillity, we came to anchor off Rosario de Santa\r\nFé, and found it a large, well constructed town, with a good cathedral,\r\nwhose unique-looking towers were visible many miles distant, in an\r\natmosphere that is singularly translucent beyond the immediate vicinage\r\nof the river, which is sometimes obscured by fogs and haze, though we\r\ncould not learn that any ill effects to human health were experienced\r\nin consequence; and certainly the vegetation and herbage appear at\r\nonce luxuriant and delicate. The cathedral is in a large square,\r\nentirely built up, and streets branch from it at right angles, many\r\nextensive, substantial looking houses being now in course of erection,\r\nand, altogether, an appearance of prosperous activity, as refreshing\r\nas unanticipated, pervades the whole place. The town contains about\r\n7,000 inhabitants, and is the great rendezvous for the upper provinces,\r\nnumerous huge, unwieldy but most capacious waggons being collected\r\nabout, ready for their laborious service, which they perform chiefly by\r\nmeans of leather. However pertinent the phrase ‘nothing like leather’\r\nmay be elsewhere, here it is of universal and unerring applicability.\r\nStreets and roads are repaired with heads and horns of cows and horses. A\r\nhorse’s or cow’s head serves for a stool, or a chair, or a pillow, just\r\nas the case may be;[101] but a horse or cow-hide serves for purposes\r\ninnumerable out of doors, and in all matters of vehicular concernment\r\nare inestimable; for where ropes or harness would be but as pack-thread,\r\na slip of raw hide, drying after it has been attached, binds like links\r\nof adamant, if any such linking there be. The supply, of course, is\r\ninexhaustible; and the dexterity with which a strip of skin, of any\r\ndimensions, is fastened to a waggon, or to luggage upon a waggon, and\r\nthence coupled, when needful, to the horses, is extraordinary. The only\r\nthing that occurred to awaken unpleasant feelings during our stay at\r\nRosario, was the general presence of that ill-omened symbol of sanguinary\r\nanarchy and benumbing oppression, the red badge, which unaccountably\r\ncontinues to be exhibited long after the downfall of him whose supremacy\r\nit but too significantly testified, though now used by the partizans of\r\nUrquiza. Until such emblems be finally discarded, it is in vain to look\r\nfor any real amalgamation of the provinces, let parchment treaties and\r\nratifications be multiplied as numerously as they may. San Nicolas is\r\nthe last Buenos Ayrean frontier town, Rosario being in the possession\r\nof Urquiza, who was residing not far from it, but living, at that time,\r\nvery quietly. Advancing upwards between these two places against the\r\nstream, we had a fine view of the extensive plains branching from Rosario\r\neastward; there seemed to be abundance of sheep and cattle grazing, and\r\nplenty of grass and clover, together with a crop of barley that might\r\nhave been dressed with guano, and nurtured under the special supervision\r\nof Mr. Mechi himself, with all the patent contrivances of Tiptree Farm\r\ntripled three times over. Would that there were a myriad of Mechis\r\nsettled down here! What a glorious country would it be under a better\r\nstate of even political organization, with a soil prolific, yet not rank,\r\nand a climate the most delicious that could be imagined at this season\r\nof the year; a positive tonic for the languid in every breath of it, and\r\nyet not enfeebling to the robust. From Rosario can be seen the convent\r\nof San Lourenço, one of the gigantic establishments of the Jesuits; and\r\nat this point occurred the famous encounter with the convoy, under care\r\nof Captains Hotham and Thrèhouart, on their return from Paraguay, after\r\nforcing the passage of the river, when Rosas erected batteries, and had\r\na huge chain placed across the river, that was soon destroyed by our\r\ngallant tars, as we shall see in some detail when we speak of Sir C.\r\nHotham in the chapter on Paraguay.[102]\r\n\r\nAfter spending the night at Rosario, and collecting as much wood\r\ntogether as could be cut by 1 P.M. next day, we got under weigh on our\r\nreturn, with the cordial good wishes of the inhabitants, who had shown\r\nus every possible attention, and taking several passengers, who availed\r\nthemselves of the opportunity to make an easy visit to Buenos Ayres. As\r\na proof of the utility of steam navigation in bringing people together,\r\nsoftening prejudices, and creating a more kindly feeling, I may mention\r\nthat our passengers were of all shades of party, some ready, under other\r\ncircumstance, to draw a sword or a trigger on each other; but here they\r\nwere hale fellows well met, and played together at cards, or conversed,\r\nwith not the slightest appearance of ill feeling. A steamer is a great\r\nleveller of prejudices and party distinctions.\r\n\r\nWe soon reached San Nicolas, and brought up for some hours, augmenting\r\nour number of passengers and supply of wood, as we found our coals\r\ngetting short; got under weigh again at 3 A.M., steaming fast down with\r\nthe current, which runs two and three knots at this season of the year.\r\nSaw the convent of San Pedro, another remarkable establishment of the\r\nJesuits, situated on rising ground, and where a branch of the main river\r\nruns; towards afternoon approached the Boca, or entrance of the river,\r\nand brought up to get more wood, which we fortunately did from a vessel\r\nat anchor there, every gentleman on board taking off his coat, and\r\nworking like a common peon. Again we got under weigh and approached our\r\nover-officious official friends at Martin Garcia, where we determined to\r\nbring up for the night, and ask for an explanation of what had occurred\r\nat that most disputatious and pugnacious point before. On rowing towards\r\nthe schooner, those on board hailed us to go on shore to the commandant,\r\nan injunction which we managed, after some difficulty in groping our way\r\nthrough the rocky beach, to fulfil. The commandant said he had no wish\r\nto obstruct our passage, nor had he given orders to fire at us; so we\r\nreturned on board, satisfied that the salute would not be repeated. So\r\nsplendid a night I have rarely seen; not a breath of air, and yet cool\r\nand pleasant; the stars reflected in the waters like a double firmament,\r\nthe slight motion causing one portion to oscillate a little, the other\r\nfirmament remaining motionless. Morning broke equally glorious, though a\r\nheavy dew had fallen, and the air was positively cold. Finally, steamed\r\nacross to the bank, and disembarked passengers at 9:30 A.M., under five\r\ndays; had we not been detained by want of fuel it would have occupied\r\nonly four days; 21½ hours time up steaming, and 20 hours down.\r\n\r\nTo show the comparative ignorance as to this boundless country, it may be\r\nmentioned that several of our passengers, who had resided 20 and 30 years\r\nat Buenos Ayres, had never before been up the rivers: others, compelled\r\nto do so, had occupied weeks in doing what we did in a few days; and,\r\naltogether, great satisfaction was felt at this practical result of\r\nsteaming, the Argentina, it is true, being the fastest steamer that had\r\never appeared on the waters of La Plata; and hence one reason why her\r\nloss has since been mourned over as a national bereavement, which it\r\nundoubtedly was, though perhaps the temporary presence in these waters of\r\nthe Menai paddle-wheel will prove some compensation till a more imposing\r\ncraft shall permanently take the place of that very excellent vessel.\r\n\r\nMy practical acquaintance with this river navigation being thus only\r\nlimited in extent, I was unable to gratify my curiosity by exploring\r\nit further up, where the scenery, according to all testimony, is\r\nsingularly fine; and, approaching Paraguay, the country becomes rich\r\nand fertile, and picturesque in a high degree. Beyond Rosario, the\r\ndistance to the city of Assumption is about 700 miles, 1,000 miles being\r\nthe entire reported distance from Buenos Ayres, and the navigation\r\nbecomes more difficult. Still, the fact of the ‘Alecto’ steamer having\r\nreached Corrientes,[103] and the ‘Locust’ Assumption, proves that it is\r\npracticable enough for vessels of small draught of water. H.M.S. ‘Vixen’\r\nhas also been much up this river, and the ‘Fanny’ steamer, taking up the\r\nAmerican expedition already alluded to, would not draw less than from\r\nnine to ten feet, whilst our little steamer did not draw seven feet, with\r\nher coals on board, nor was her great length any difficulty in turning\r\nangles of the river. There is no doubt that a class of steamers could be\r\nbuilt that would make the passage to Assumption in a few days; and it is\r\nsaid that General Lopez, the Paraguayan Plenipotentiary to England and\r\nFrance, has already ordered two for the service, which augurs well for\r\nhis desire to cultivate external relations.\r\n\r\nOf the ‘Uruguay’ I know nothing but from hearsay and information: that it\r\nis a noble stream, much wider and more easily navigated than the Parana,\r\nwith the same boundless extent of uncultivated country. We saw the\r\nentrance to it on the right from the Boca of the Parana, which makes a\r\nsharp angle. The main difficulty in connection with this river navigation\r\nare the channels about Martin Garcia, which are tortuous and very narrow\r\nin some places. It appears, indeed, to be a deep gulley, formed by the\r\nmass of waters pressing their way through the miles of sand and mud lying\r\nacross the main entrance, much of it almost dry at the surface; and until\r\nthese channels are properly buoyed and lighted, even steamers will be\r\nsubject to delay and damage, as the most experienced pilot can scarcely\r\nrely on his eye or bearing in such an expanse of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAGUAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPARAGUAY.\r\n\r\n    Sources of information.—General Pacheco.—Inaccuracies of\r\n    Sir Woodbine Parish.—Navigability of the Parana by large\r\n    vessels.—Decrees of the government of Paraguay on the\r\n    treatment of foreigners.—Decrees relative to inventions\r\n    and improvements.—Mr. Drabble’s commercial mission, and\r\n    its results.—Cultivation of cotton.—Drawbacks to its\r\n    extension.—Scarcity of labour.—Provisions of the treaty\r\n    between Great Britain and Paraguay.—The commercial resources\r\n    of the country little known in this.—Navigability of the\r\n    Paraguay and the Uruguay.—Obligation of the Brazilian and\r\n    Buenos Ayrean governments to remove impediments.—Population\r\n    of Paraguay.—Public works undertaken by the Consular\r\n    Government.—Salubrity of the climate.—Fertility of\r\n    the soil.—Pasturage illimitable.—Character of the\r\n    Paraguayans.—President Lopez.—Diplomatic mission of Sir Charles\r\n    Hotham.—General Lopez.—State of the country at the death of\r\n    Francia.—First measures of the Consular Government.—Revenue\r\n    of Paraguay.—Administration of justice.—Revision of the\r\n    tariff.—Release of political prisoners at the termination of\r\n    Francia’s Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR CHARLES HOTHAM, K.C.B., LATE HER MAJESTY’S\r\nPLENIPOTENTIARY TO PARAGUAY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs indicated at the conclusion of the last chapter, my ascent of the\r\nParana ceased at Rosario, whence I descended to the mouth of the Plate,\r\non the return voyage to Europe; consequently, what I am about to say of\r\nParaguay is not the result of actual personal experience in that strange\r\nland. Nevertheless, I offer the annexed observations with considerable\r\nconfidence, as the fruits of diligent inquiry among several who had been\r\nthere, some for many years, some very recently; and as the fruits also\r\nof the perusal of nearly all accredited works on the subject, of one\r\nof which in particular,[104] whose merits and reliability are vouched\r\nfor by the distinguished Uruguayan soldier and administrator who has\r\nedited it—General Pacheco—I have availed myself to some extent, having\r\nbeen also assured by other competent critics that it is most trustworthy\r\nin its data and most dispassionate in its views. The paucity of works\r\non this country is not surprising, but the inaccuracy of that which,\r\nbeing the most recent, is naturally accepted as the most authoritative\r\nin England, is indeed marvellous. The obligations of all interested in\r\nPlatine affairs are so great to Sir Woodbine Parish, and as regards\r\nParaguay in particular, members of his family long ago afforded so much\r\ninvaluable information then derivable from no other source, that it\r\nis with the utmost reluctance I say a word calculated to diminish the\r\ndeference due to the veteran diplomatist and author; nor should I attempt\r\nto impugn his statements if he spoke from his own individual knowledge.\r\nStill, his predilection in favour of Rosas, to which I have adverted in\r\nthe introductory chapter (page 30), and his antipathy to everybody and\r\neverything inimical to the regime and the system of the Buenos Ayrean\r\nDictator, are, or at least in 1852 were, so potent as completely to run\r\naway with his otherwise excellent judgment. On what other grounds can\r\nwe account for his lending all the emphasis of italics to such passages\r\nas these, for which he quotes Colonel Graham, the United States Consul,\r\nwho proceeded on an official mission to Paraguay, in 1845, and who is\r\napparently regarded by Sir Woodbine as an indisputable authority, viz.:—\r\n\r\n    ‘_Were its resources developed, and encouragement given to the\r\n    industry of its inhabitants, it might become a comparatively\r\n    wealthy part of South America, but it could never support\r\n    an active trade excepting with the adjoining States. Yerba,\r\n    the tea of Paraguay, its chief product, is only consumed in\r\n    South America; its fine woods would not bear the expense of\r\n    transport to Europe; its sugar, tobacco, cotton, and rice, on\r\n    account of the distance which they would have to be conveyed\r\n    from the interior, even were the Parana open, could never enter\r\n    into competition with those of Brazil and the United States.\r\n    If the Parana were declared open to all nations, the United\r\n    States could not carry on any direct intercourse with Paraguay\r\n    under its own flag. The vessels adapted for crossing the ocean\r\n    would not go up the Parana, and merchandise would have to be\r\n    re-embarked at the mouth of the river in craft suitable to its\r\n    navigation, and owned by parties resident in the country. Mr.\r\n    Graham’s observations are equally applicable to the shipping\r\n    of European nations, and they cannot too often be repeated for\r\n    the information of parties embarking in trade with those remote\r\n    countries._’\r\n\r\nThe best answer to all this is what I have already said in the preceding\r\nchapter respecting Colonel Graham’s fellow-countryman, Mr. Hopkins; and\r\nas to ‘vessels adapted for crossing the ocean not going up the Parana,’\r\nSir Woodbine must surely have been well aware, even at the time Graham\r\nwrote, saying nothing of subsequent experience, of the facts borrowed\r\nfrom Sir W. Gore Ouseley, in the note to the illustration of Corrientes\r\n(see p. 324), respecting the ascent, not merely of the Parana, by British\r\nvessels of war, but of the Paraguay, as far as Assumption, by the French\r\nwar steamer Fulton, commanded by Captain Mazeres; also that for upwards\r\nof 300 miles beyond Assumption the navigation of the Paraguay is even\r\nbetter than it is below the capital, as was lately exemplified, since my\r\nreturn to England, by the voyage of the American steamer Waterwitch, far\r\nbeyond the limits previously understood to be navigable, except to the\r\nsmall river craft of the country.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that Colonel Graham could not have known these latter\r\nfacts when he wrote what Sir Woodbine has quoted. But Sir Woodbine\r\nhimself must have known them, and should not, therefore, have quoted\r\nthe Colonel; and he must have known also that public notification had\r\nbeen given, in the following document, which I also take the liberty of\r\nprinting in italics, that there had been an end put to the isolation in\r\nwhich Paraguay had so long been kept by Francia; and that ‘one Lopez,’\r\nas Sir Woodbine calls the present enlightened President, had made every\r\nadvance to the external world years before the world became persuaded\r\nthat the system of Francia had been buried with him.\r\n\r\n    DECREES AS TO THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGNERS IN PARAGUAY, AND THE\r\n    PRIVILEGES AND RECOMPENSES TO BE AWARDED TO THOSE WHO SHALL\r\n    CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPE AND ENCOURAGE INDUSTRY AND THE MATERIAL\r\n    IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n    _The Supreme Government of the Republic: Considering that\r\n    it behoves us to extend and cultivate relations of amity,\r\n    good understanding, and harmony with foreign nations, and\r\n    consequently to acquaint the national authorities with the\r\n    system which the Government follows and seeks to enforce for\r\n    this purpose with reference to foreign subjects, decrees,\r\n    in virtue of and in conformity with the fundamental laws of\r\n    the State and its political and commercial principles, that\r\n    the said authorities shall punctually observe the following\r\n    rules:—Art. 1. The Supreme Government of the Republic\r\n    will maintain, as a general and unalterable privilege in\r\n    its relations with foreign powers, a perfect and absolute\r\n    equality; so that wheresoever there may be any identity of\r\n    cases or circumstances, no privileges, immunities, or favours\r\n    whatsoever shall be granted to any nation which shall not in\r\n    like manner be conceded to all others. Art. 2. Consequently,\r\n    every foreigner, whosoever he may be, can betake himself to\r\n    such ports of the Republic as are open to foreign commerce, and\r\n    there carry on his mercantile operations in perfect freedom.\r\n    Art. 3. Now, and for the whole time that the Government shall\r\n    consider those circumstances to exist which have induced it\r\n    to appoint certain ports for the admission of foreigners, the\r\n    latter will not be allowed to proceed (s’interner) to other\r\n    ports without a special permission from the Government. Art.\r\n    4. Every foreigner, during his stay in the territory of the\r\n    Republic, shall have full liberty to commence and to exercise\r\n    his trade or profession: he shall obtain for his person all\r\n    protection and security, provided that on his side he respects\r\n    the authorities and the laws of the State. Art. 5. All\r\n    foreigners are exempt from forced service by sea or land, from\r\n    all military exactions or requisitions, and from extraordinary\r\n    contributions, and shall only pay those levied on natives,\r\n    with the slight difference consecrated by law between citizens\r\n    and foreigners. Art. 6. No foreigner shall be persecuted on\r\n    account of his religion, on condition that he does not exercise\r\n    his worship publicly, and that he respects the religion of\r\n    the State, its ministers, and its public ceremonies. Art. 7.\r\n    Foreigners are in no case obliged to trust their business\r\n    to agents or brokers; they have in this respect the same\r\n    immunities as natives. Art. 8. Money, goods, or property of\r\n    any nature whatsoever belonging to foreigners residing within\r\n    the territory of the Republic, and confided either to the\r\n    State or to private individuals, shall be respected and kept\r\n    inviolate, both in time of war and in time of peace. Art.\r\n    9. In virtue of the principle recognised in the preceding\r\n    article, should a rupture occur between the Republic and a\r\n    foreign country, the subjects and citizens of that country\r\n    residing within the territory of the Republic shall be allowed\r\n    to remain there and continue their trade or profession without\r\n    hindrance, provided that they conduct themselves with suitable\r\n    fidelity, and in nowise violate the laws and regulations in\r\n    force. Art. 10. The exportation of the produce of the country\r\n    by foreigners shall be subjected to no other duty than that\r\n    paid by natives. Art. 11. The Supreme Government of the\r\n    Republic can eject from its territories, either in time of\r\n    peace or of war, any foreigner whose bad conduct gives rise\r\n    to the adoption of this measure, but he shall be allowed a\r\n    reasonable time for the settlement of his affairs. Art. 12.\r\n    All foreigners residing within the territory of the Republic\r\n    have a right to dispose of their property, either by will or\r\n    in whatever form they may consider advisable. Art. 13. In case\r\n    of the decease of a foreigner without a will, his property\r\n    shall be preserved in the form prescribed in the following\r\n    article, for his heirs ab intestato, or for his creditors.\r\n    Art. 14. In the case stated in the preceding article, that is\r\n    to say, the decease of a foreigner ab intestato, the judge of\r\n    the district where the decease takes place, assisted by two\r\n    honourable fellow-countrymen of the deceased, and in default of\r\n    these by two inhabitants of the locality, shall proceed, with\r\n    the least possible delay, to make out a minute inventory of\r\n    all the property of the defunct, shall keep them in a place of\r\n    safety, and shall render an account of the whole, accompanied\r\n    by the inventory, to the Government, so that the property may\r\n    be deposited in a proper place, according to its nature. Art.\r\n    15. The said decease, _ab intestato_ shall then be announced\r\n    in the Gazette, in order that all those concerned may be\r\n    made acquainted with it. If any heir or creditor appears he\r\n    shall produce legal proof of his claim. Art. 16. If no party\r\n    concerned appears, or delays in the proceedings threaten to\r\n    occasion a deterioration of the property, the latter shall be\r\n    converted into the currency of the country, and which shall be\r\n    deposited in the chest of the Treasurer or Receiver-General,\r\n    and under their responsibility. Art. 17. In case the parties\r\n    concerned cannot legally prove their claims, or shall not\r\n    appear after the lapse of two years dated from the commencement\r\n    prescribed in art. 15, the property so deposited shall be\r\n    adjudged to the national treasury. Art. 18. Property delivered\r\n    to foreigners who are the legitimate progenitors or descendants\r\n    of foreigners who have died testate or ab intestato, shall\r\n    pay at the time they receive it a duty of five per cent. When\r\n    it is delivered to any other foreign heir, who is neither a\r\n    progenitor nor a descendant in virtue of a will or succession\r\n    _ab intestato_, the duty shall be ten per cent._\r\n\r\n    _In order that all may be made acquainted with the present\r\n    decree, it shall be promulgated in the legal form and deposited\r\n    in the public archives._\r\n\r\n                              _CARLOS ANTONIO LOPEZ._\r\n                              _AUDRES GIL, Sec. to the Supreme Govt._\r\n\r\n    _Assumption, 20th May, 1845._\r\n\r\nAt the same time, publicity had been given to another document, which\r\nshowed that not only were the persons and property of strangers perfectly\r\nsafe in Paraguay, but that protection was afforded to the fruits of their\r\ninvention and ingenuity, in a manner that other nations, pretending to a\r\nmuch higher degree of civilization, would do well to imitate, viz.:—\r\n\r\n    _The Supreme Government of the Republic, desirous of\r\n    encouraging industry and developing the elements of improvement\r\n    possessed by the State, and considering that one of the most\r\n    efficient means consists in properly defining and guaranteeing\r\n    the position and rights of those who conduce to so useful an\r\n    end, decrees:—_\r\n\r\n    Art. 1. Every discovery or new invention in whatever branch of\r\n    industry it may be, is the property of the inventor, and its\r\n    enjoyment is guaranteed to him in the form and for the time\r\n    specified in the following articles. Art. 2. Every means of\r\n    giving to a production already in existence a greater degree\r\n    of perfection shall be considered as a new discovery. Art.\r\n    3. Whosoever shall introduce into the Republic a discovery\r\n    of foreign origin shall enjoy the same advantages which he\r\n    would have derived from it had he been the inventor. Art. 4.\r\n    Whosoever is desirous of obtaining and insuring to himself\r\n    the enjoyment of an industrial property of the description\r\n    above-mentioned, shall—first, address to the Secretary of\r\n    the Supreme Government a declaration in writing specifying\r\n    the nature of his claim, whether it is for a discovery, the\r\n    perfecting, or the introduction of one; secondly, forward\r\n    under seal an exact description of the principles, means,\r\n    and procedure which constitute the discovery, as well as the\r\n    plans, designs, models, and other documents which relate to\r\n    it, and which sealed paper or volume shall be opened at the\r\n    moment when the inventor shall receive a title to his property.\r\n    Art. 5. The inventor shall be granted a patent which shall\r\n    guarantee him the discovery as his property for the space\r\n    of five or ten years, reckoned from the date of the patent.\r\n    This period, however, may be extended, and other advantages\r\n    conceded if the importance of the invention is so great as to\r\n    call for extraordinary protection. Art. 6. The period during\r\n    which a patent granted for an invention introduced from a\r\n    foreign country remains in force cannot exceed by more than six\r\n    months that stated in the patent taken out for the invention\r\n    in that country. Art. 7. The possessor of a patent shall be\r\n    exclusively entitled to the use and proceeds of the discovery,\r\n    or the perfecting or introduction of one, for which it shall\r\n    have been granted; consequently he can bring an action against\r\n    infractors of his patent, and on conviction they shall be\r\n    condemned, besides confiscation, to pay to the patentee all\r\n    costs and damages; and, moreover, a fine of twenty per cent.\r\n    on the total amount of the preceding condemnation, which shall\r\n    be applied to public expenses. Art. 8. Should the denunciation\r\n    of fraud, followed by the sequestration of the defendant’s\r\n    property, be found devoid of proofs, the patentee shall be\r\n    condemned to pay to the defendant all losses and damages which\r\n    he may have sustained, besides a fine of twenty per cent. on\r\n    the total amount of the said losses and damages, to be applied\r\n    in like manner to public expenses. Art. 9. Every patentee shall\r\n    have the right of forming establishments in different parts of\r\n    the Republic, excepting only such reserved places as have been\r\n    declared to him beforehand, as well as of authorising other\r\n    individuals to use and put his procedure, his discovery, and\r\n    his secret in practice—in fine, to dispose of his patent as if\r\n    it were personal property. Art. 10. Before the expiration of\r\n    the period for which the patent is granted, the descriptions of\r\n    the invention can only be communicated to some citizen who may\r\n    wish to consult them, unless political or commercial reasons\r\n    should require the whole to be kept secret, or the inventor has\r\n    solicited and obtained at the time he took out the patent an\r\n    assurance that complete reserve shall be maintained with regard\r\n    to his invention. Art. 11. At the expiration of the patent\r\n    the invention or discovery shall become the property of the\r\n    Republic; and the Supreme Government shall cause a description\r\n    of it to be published, and shall allow it to be generally used\r\n    and engaged, save and except when it shall be necessary to\r\n    place some restrictions on it. Art. 12. This publication shall\r\n    also take place, and the use of the operations which constitute\r\n    the invention declared free, if the possessor of a patent\r\n    loses his right to it, which can only happen in the following\r\n    cases: First, when the inventor shall be convicted of having\r\n    omitted in his description any of the procedure essential to\r\n    the preparation of the article invented, or of not having set\r\n    it forth with sufficient fidelity or details; secondly, when he\r\n    has not communicated the new modifications or improvements of\r\n    his discovery known to him at the time when he takes out his\r\n    patent or even discovered by him after having obtained it, and\r\n    the enjoyment of which is as safely guaranteed to him as that\r\n    of the first invention; thirdly, when it shall be demonstrated\r\n    that he has obtained his patent by an invention already to be\r\n    found and described in works printed and published, so that\r\n    in reality it is no new invention; fourthly, when, during the\r\n    lapse of two years from the date of the patent, he has not\r\n    begun to make use of his discovery, excepting when he can\r\n    give good reasons for the delay; fifthly, when, after he has\r\n    obtained a patent from the republic, he is convicted for having\r\n    obtained another for the same invention in a foreign country\r\n    without preliminary authority; sixthly, the patent shall in\r\n    like manner be revoked, the invention published, and its use\r\n    made free, if the purchaser of the right to use an invention\r\n    specified in a patent violates the conditions imposed on the\r\n    inventor, conditions which are not the less binding on the\r\n    purchaser. Art. 13. If a discovery which is useful to the\r\n    public is found to be eminently simple in its execution and\r\n    susceptible of being too easily imitated, the inventor, instead\r\n    of a patent, may demand an equivalent remuneration. Art. 14.\r\n    This may likewise take place when the inventor prefers the\r\n    honour of causing the nation to enjoy the advantages of his\r\n    discovery at once. This remuneration shall be proportionate\r\n    to the respective utility of the inventions, well and duly\r\n    certified and appreciated. Art. 15. If any one discovers a\r\n    fresh improvement for an invention already guaranteed by a\r\n    patent, he shall obtain, at his request, another patent for the\r\n    separate use of this new improvement, nevertheless he shall\r\n    never be permitted, under any pretext whatsoever, to use or\r\n    cause to be used the principal invention, and reciprocally the\r\n    inventor cannot use or cause to be used the new improvement,\r\n    without prejudice to such arrangements as may be made between\r\n    themselves. Art. 16. The priority of invention, in cases of\r\n    dispute between two patentees relative to the same article,\r\n    shall be awarded to him who has first made the declaration and\r\n    deposited the documents, as required in Art. 4.\r\n\r\n    _In order that every one may be made acquainted with the\r\n    present decree, it shall be published in the legal form and\r\n    deposited in the public archives._\r\n\r\n                        _CARLOS ANTONIO LOPEZ._\r\n                        _AUDRES GIL, Sec. to the Supreme Government._\r\n\r\n    _Assumption, 20th May, 1845._\r\n\r\nIn respect to what Sir Woodbine says in reference to the products of\r\nParaguay not bearing the expense of transport, it will perhaps be\r\nsufficient to cite in a note[105] the opinions of practical men upon\r\nthe exceeding desirability and the feasibility of Europeans availing\r\nthemselves of one of its staples most essential to English manufactures,\r\nas set forth in the leading journal a few months back.\r\n\r\nThere was always a strong presentiment among commercial men in this\r\ncountry that a treaty with Paraguay would be productive of great\r\nadvantages; and there is an equally strong conviction still, despite\r\nthe apprehended obstacles raised by the Buenos Ayrean Government in\r\nrespect to the enforced protectorate of the island of Martin Garcia,\r\nthat the treaty ratified on November 2nd, by Lord Clarendon and his\r\nExcellency Don F. Lopez, the accomplished son and representative of\r\nthe President of Paraguay at the British Court, and a copy of which\r\nwas presented to parliament the opening day of the present Session, by\r\nLord John Russell,[106] will, in due time, effect most of the benefits\r\nanticipated. But so complete is the ignorance in England of the real\r\nmercantile resources of Paraguay, that even public writers most disposed\r\nto augur well of the treaty in question propagated notions concerning\r\nthat territory so far short of the actual fact, that, if they were\r\ntrue, certain politicians might be almost justified in now pooh-poohing\r\nwhat has been accomplished, just as they did when it was attempted some\r\nyears ago. For instance, one journal, long celebrated for its supposed\r\npeculiarly accurate information on foreign topics, mercantile as well\r\nas political, stated, immediately after the ratification of the treaty,\r\nas a piece of intelligence of great significance, that Paraguay was the\r\nmost populous of all the La Plata provinces, ‘except Buenos Ayres’—the\r\ntruth being that the Paraguayan population exceeds the Buenos Ayrean\r\nupwards of threefold—exceeds that of all the Argentine States and the\r\nBanda Oriental put together! while, contrary to the general belief even\r\nin South America, its power of consumption is greater than the rest\r\nof the interior provinces of the Confederation.[107] Considering its\r\nextreme isolation hitherto, and that modern writers professing to treat\r\nof it have almost invariably drawn their information from second-hand or\r\napocryphal sources, it is perhaps but natural that there should be extant\r\nbut little reliable knowledge respecting Paraguay. In proceeding to\r\nsupply much of the void complained of, the first fact to which we would\r\ndraw the attention of mercantile men is, not so much its varied products,\r\nmany of them most suitable to British purposes, nor its advantages,\r\npeculiarly fitting it to nourish an important commerce, considering its\r\nfine climate,[108] fruitful soil, and numerous[109] population, but to\r\nthe stable and enduring nature of its governmental status.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW NEAR ASSUMPTION.]\r\n\r\nUnlike all the Platine provinces, Paraguay is blest with a government\r\nwhich, though Republican in name and in the forms of its administration,\r\nguarantees the preservation of public order; and is not exposed to those\r\nconstant revolutionary vicissitudes that have come to be regarded as the\r\nnormal condition of the neighbouring powers of Spanish origin. Hence,\r\nto our thinking, the great value of this treaty with a government not\r\nonly willing but able to realize its intended share in the arrangement.\r\nWe have not only fully entered into relations with a country new, rich\r\nin natural treasures, peopled with a docile race well disposed towards\r\nus,[110] and situate at the head of a vast internal navigation, but we\r\nmay rely upon the utmost effect being given by the executive to the\r\nstipulations it has undertaken to observe, and that the open navigation\r\nof the Paraguay and Upper Parana shall be secured to the British flag,\r\nfree from all alteration or sudden closing of these rivers;—thus\r\ncompleting that security so essential to successful enterprise and\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nSurely we are not too sanguine in believing that a noble territory\r\ngeographically so situate, politically so secure under the firm and\r\nsagacious guidance of President Lopez,[111] whose capacity promises to\r\nbe hereditary, and affluent in so many of the raw materials of European\r\nmanufacture and necessity, will speedily develope itself among nations\r\nin a manner worthy of its natural endowments. The prospective mutual\r\nbenefits that are likely to be derived from this treaty are of far\r\ngreater magnitude than appear to be generally understood in England,\r\nor perhaps even in Paraguay itself, although they must, in a great\r\nmeasure, depend on the spirit in which the new reciprocal relations may\r\nbe cultivated and extended; but, be the result what it may hereafter,\r\nwe have abundant reason to be grateful for the exertions of Sir Charles\r\nHotham in having done so much to lay the foundation of future commercial\r\nprosperity. Probably opposition will continue to be made by Buenos\r\nAyres to the execution of the other treaty with Urquiza, although the\r\nactive energies of Sir Charles were, in both cases, exerted only for the\r\nobvious mutual advantage of all parties concerned; but as regards the\r\nParaguay treaty, at all events, no such obstacles are to be apprehended.\r\nThe government of Paraguay have constantly shown a laudable desire to\r\nestablish European intimacy, which circumstances not depending upon\r\nitself have too long delayed. Had the project so wisely entertained,\r\nand so vigorously promoted, as far as his power extended, by our able\r\nMinister at Monte Video in 1845-6, been prosecuted to the end, and\r\nthe independence of Paraguay recognized by the British Government in\r\nconformity with the wishes of Sir W. Gore Ouseley, when, in conjunction\r\nwith Baron Defaudis, the French Minister, Captain (now Sir C.) Hotham\r\nwas sent to Assumption, to treat with President Lopez, there can be no\r\nquestion that many of the subsequent troubles and difficulties of the La\r\nPlata question would have been altogether obviated; Rosas would long ago\r\nhave been expelled; his vast property (the non-sequestration of which\r\nwas the grand error of Urquiza) would not have been employed to promote\r\nthe revolutionary intrigues it has since done, but which it will do no\r\nlonger, as it is now confiscated; and Paraguay, instead of merely being\r\nabout entering on its noviciate, would have had seven years’ experience\r\nof reciprocity with the old world by this time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING TOWARDS ASSUMPTION.]\r\n\r\nBy selecting Sir C. Hotham for the mission to Paraguay, Lord Malmesbury\r\nvirtually continued, in the person of the very officer chosen for that\r\npurpose, the commercial policy initiated in ’45-6 by Sir W. G. Ouseley.\r\nOn that occasion, as more recently, the English were received by the\r\nParaguayans with the greatest cordiality, though at the same time with\r\na reserve not unbecoming a people whose _amour propre_ was wounded by\r\ntheir independence not being recognized in the first instance. Once\r\nthat all-essential formality was complied with, negotiations proceeded\r\nas satisfactorily as could be desired. It is understood that when the\r\nParaguayan Envoys were sent to Monte Video in ’46 to treat with our then\r\nMinister there, Sir William suggested that a number of distinguished\r\nyoung natives should be sent to England, that they might judge of our\r\ninstitutions and commercial spirit for themselves, and report to him that\r\nthis country had, and could have, no sinister motive to serve by a treaty\r\nwith Paraguay. Concurring in that opinion, President Lopez wisely caused\r\nhis son, the minister plenipotentiary to this court, General Lopez, to\r\nbe accompanied by a numerous suite of military officers and civilians,\r\ntogether with a younger brother of the General’s, as secretary, full of\r\nintelligence, and by M. Gelli, a veteran diplomatist. The General, though\r\na young man, has for some years been commander-in-chief of the Paraguayan\r\nforces, and is said to manifest great ability and a large faculty of\r\nobservation, evincing a keen desire to obtain information on all subjects\r\nlikely to be of benefit to his country. He made a very favourable\r\nimpression in England, and still more so in France, where he was received\r\nwith the greatest distinction, the Emperor, Napoleon the Third, according\r\nhim public and private audiences amidst the most imposing ceremonial\r\nof state. He is now (April, 1854,) engaged in making a tour in Italy,\r\nand through the continent; and in the course of the present summer will\r\nreturn to Paraguay, his naturally fine mind stored with the fruits of an\r\nobservant and diversified experience, and his excellent disposition in no\r\nway deteriorated, it is to be hoped, by his acquaintance with the peoples\r\nof the old world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGADIER GENERAL FRANCISCO SOLANO LOPEZ, ENVOY\r\nEXTRAORDINARY AND MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY.]\r\n\r\nWhoever has any knowledge of the history of the American republics,\r\nand of the Spanish language, will not fail to remark in Paraguay a\r\nrare and singular circumstance, which does great honour to its men of\r\nthe sword,[112] and must inspire confidence in the future stability of\r\nauthority in the country. The military in all the new American states\r\nhave always shown, without any exception, a propensity most fatal to\r\norder, that of making and unmaking governments without consulting the\r\nopinions and wishes of their fellow-citizens, only those of the chiefs\r\nof certain factions with whom they may concert their plans. Here, on the\r\ncontrary, so soon as the first case, and the most extraordinary one which\r\nit is possible to imagine, occurred, the men of the sword did not usurp\r\nthe right of creating and establishing the supreme authority. They set\r\nthe example of calling together an assembly of their fellow-countrymen to\r\ntake the opinion and votes of the country, and submit themselves to the\r\nauthorities which the general wishes might elect. The new administration\r\nhad all to create, because everything had been destroyed. The dictator\r\nleft neither individuals or materials of any description, of which the\r\ngovernment that succeeded him could avail themselves.[113] Everything\r\nwas in disorder as an effect of the monstrous centralization in his\r\nperson alone of all the branches of the administration. High and low,\r\npolicy, justice, finances, war, ecclesiastical matters, in fine all was\r\nabsorbed; nothing was done by any one but him. There was not a single\r\nindividual who had been enabled to acquire any practice, any routine for\r\nthe dispatch of business, as there were no fixed and general principles\r\nto serve as guides for particular cases which presented themselves,\r\neverything depending on the caprice or will of the dictator, who only\r\nemployed people as scribes, little else than the merest copying clerks.\r\nNo person had obtained the least instruction, or the least experience,\r\nto enable him to prepare, and facilitate the labour of the government\r\ndepartments, and the dispatch of business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH OF THE RECOLETA—BURIAL-GROUND—NEAR ASSUMPTION.]\r\n\r\nWith these difficulties to encounter, the new government set to work with\r\nenergy, but without noise or ostentation. It did not announce itself by\r\nthe proclamation of pompous promises. It would have been imprudent to\r\narouse hopes which might only be realized in time, and in spite of many\r\nobstacles. It did not set up theories and doctrines of an exaggerated\r\nliberalism, which subsequently, besides their being at first ill\r\nunderstood, it might have itself been obliged to abandon in practice. It\r\ndid not allow the smallest sign of blame or disapprobation of the conduct\r\nof the dictator to transpire. It would have been useless, and even\r\nsetting a bad example, to abuse his memory, and awaken the remembrance\r\nof irreparable evils. We may believe that the Consular Government wished\r\nto be judged according to its acts, and not by its proclamations and\r\ndissertations.\r\n\r\nSome small capital of which no one had suspected the existence was soon\r\nseen to appear and circulate, and this gave much impulse to industry and\r\noccupation to labourers, who, until then, had been unable to find any.\r\nThe apparition of these little capitals, and the activity which ensued,\r\nwere sure signs of confidence in public order, and in the government.\r\nInstead of the inaction and apathy which previously reigned, a spirit of\r\nenterprise and animation was every where seen. Assumption was cleared\r\nof the ruins and rubbish which rendered its aspect disgusting. The\r\nspaces left by buildings half demolished were masked by walls, and new\r\nhabitations were raised, modest in truth, but which gave an air of life\r\nto the city.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no saying much with accuracy of the present revenue of\r\nParaguay,[114] it is certain that it suffices to meet its public ordinary\r\nexpenses, which cannot be more moderate. Paraguay has not that numerous\r\nbody of _employés_ which has been, and is still, a cancer gnawing into\r\nthe heart of the new states which so proudly clothe themselves with the\r\ntitle of republics. Her functionaries are not numerous. They mostly\r\nreceive but very slender emoluments, either because living is very cheap\r\nin Paraguay, or because offices are there considered rather as public\r\nduties to fulfil, than places which, to be well filled, should be well\r\nremunerated. The judges are annually selected amongst the inhabitants of\r\nthe different districts, of divers professions, without any necessity\r\nfor their engaging in preliminary studies, or for their being previously\r\ndestined for the magistracy, and the government allows them only what is\r\nindispensable for their office expenses and the dispatch of business,\r\nwithout any fees being paid by the parties concerned. When the service\r\nrequires more functionaries, and those of special capacity, who will have\r\nto devote themselves exclusively to the duties of their employments, the\r\npublic treasury will be better provided, and in a better position to\r\nremunerate those whom the government will have to employ.[115]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the sum, however, at present produced by each branch of\r\nthe revenue, it cannot but increase, and rapidly, not only in consequence\r\nof the development of those things on which duties are chargeable, but\r\nalso because, with time and experience, the distribution of the taxes,\r\n&c., will be improved.[116] They will be convinced of a truth long\r\naccepted in political economy, but which does not the less pass for\r\nparadoxical, elsewhere than in Paraguay, viz.: that duties, when moderate\r\nand properly collected, are much more productive than high ones.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps this principle which gave rise to the reform introduced\r\nby the President’s Government in the Tariff. That of 1841, which was\r\nimprinted with the doctrines of the protectionist school, was reformed\r\nand reduced by M. Lopez in 1846. That of 1841, not content with\r\nestablishing very heavy duties on the generality of articles imported,\r\nand on all those exported, was intended to favour, at the expense of all,\r\nsome hatters and vine-dressers who made bad hats and still worse wine,\r\nand levied a duty of 40 per cent. on wines and hats imported. The Tariff\r\nof 1846 has remedied these evils, and diminished the duties in general,\r\nbut they are still too heavy, especially those on exports, which ought to\r\nbe reduced almost to nothing.[117]\r\n\r\nRespecting the trade that may be expected to ensue between this country\r\nand Paraguay, I am not fanatical enough to suppose that it will be either\r\nvery rapid or very extensive at first. But, at the same time, as little\r\ncan I share the apprehensions of a Buenos Ayrean writer quoted in the\r\nleading English journal on the arrival of the mail of the 16th of this\r\nmonth, (April, 1854,) that because certain mercantile ventures to the\r\nParana had not proved lucrative, therefore the means of the inhabitants,\r\nand, by inference, of Paraguay also, were at a very low ebb, and that\r\nthere was an indisposition to commerce. The same consequences, and from\r\nthe same causes, were observable in China on the first partial opening\r\nof intercourse with that empire. The markets were not suited with proper\r\ngoods and were glutted with superfluities. As to Paraguay, at all events,\r\nwe know that both the taste and the means exist in the indulgence\r\nof what among so comparatively simple a people may be considered\r\ngreat luxuries.[118] Opportunity alone was wanted; and now that that\r\nopportunity is afforded, and that European wealth will be forthcoming\r\nfor the numerous indigenous commodities so much required in this quarter\r\nof the world, there can be no doubt that all reasonable expectations\r\nformed by the parties to the Malmesbury treaty, and by those who long ago\r\nlaboured to bring such treaties about, will soon begin to be realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES HOTHAM, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis distinguished officer, now Governor of the Australian Colony of\r\nVictoria, comes of an ancient ancestry, many members of whom attained\r\neminence in that special branch of the public service in which he himself\r\nhas acquired such deserved repute. Indeed, there are few families that\r\nhave for so long a time, and for such a continuance, given so many\r\nservants to the state. As early as the reign of Edward II., we find that\r\nJohn de Hotham, great grandson of the first of the name, who settled\r\nat the family seat of Hotham, Yorkshire, was Bishop of Ely, Treasurer\r\nof the Exchequer, and subsequently Lord Chancellor to Edward III. Sir\r\nJohn Hotham, the first baronet, Governor of Hull, who had five wives,\r\nwas beheaded on Tower-hill, together with his son, Sir John Hotham,\r\nKnt., by the Parliamentarians, for corresponding with the Royalists,\r\nin 1643. His grandson and successor married into the noble family of\r\nBeaumont, in Ireland, and hence the Irish peerage, which the present\r\nLord Hotham, member for the East-Riding of Yorkshire, and uncle of Sir\r\nCharles, retains, his lordship being a major-general in the army, and\r\nhaving served at Waterloo. Of the many naval officers in the family,\r\nboth in direct descent and collaterally, the most celebrated was the\r\nRt. Hon. William, Baron Hotham, of South Dalton, in the peerage of\r\nIreland, so created 7th March, 1797, with remainder, in default of direct\r\ndescendants, to the heirs male of his deceased father, in consideration\r\nof his gallant achievements, as a naval commander, at the commencement\r\nof hostilities with republican France. Having previously attained the\r\nrank of rear-admiral, he was advanced to that of admiral of the white,\r\nappointed second in command of the fleet ordered to the Mediterranean,\r\nunder Lord Hood, of which he obtained the chief command a few months\r\nafterwards, upon Lord Hood’s return to England; and but a short time\r\nsubsequently elapsed until Admiral Hotham had the good fortune to bring\r\nthe French squadron to action (14th March, 1795), and to obtain a\r\ndecisive victory over it, for which he received the thanks of both houses\r\nof parliament, and was made admiral of the blue. He died, unmarried, in\r\n1813, and was succeeded by his brother Beaumont, Lord Hotham, father of\r\nthe present Lord Hotham, M.P., and of the late Vice-Admiral Hotham, who\r\nwas, consequently, uncle of the subject of the present sketch, of whom\r\nthe annexed particulars are taken from the great nautical professional\r\nauthority, ‘O’Byrne’s Naval Biography’:—\r\n\r\n‘Sir Charles Hotham, born in 1806, is eldest son of the Rev. Fras.\r\nHotham, Prebendary of Rochester (second son of the second Lord Hotham,\r\none of the Barons of the Court of Exchequer), by Anne Elizabeth, eldest\r\ndaughter of Thos. Hallett Hodges, Esq., of Hemsted Place, Kent; and\r\nfirst cousin of Capt. Hon. Geo. Fred. Hotham, R.N. Sir Charles, who\r\nis brother-in-law of Lieut.-Col. Grieve, of the 75th Regt., has also\r\na brother, Augustus Thomas Hotham, in the army. This officer entered\r\nthe navy 6 Nov., 1818; and on the night of the 23 May, 1824, when\r\nmidshipman of the Naiad, 46, Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer, served\r\nin the boats under Lieut. Michael Quin at the gallant destruction of a\r\n16-gun brig, moored in a position of extraordinary strength alongside\r\nthe walls of the fortress of Bona, in which was a garrison of about\r\n400 soldiers, who, from cannon and musket, kept up a tremendous fire,\r\nalmost perpendicularly, on the deck. He was made lieutenant, 17 Sept.,\r\n1825, into the Revenge, 76, flag-ship of Sir Harry Burrard Neale in the\r\nMediterranean; and next appointed—15 May, 1826, to the Medina, 20, Capts.\r\nTimothy Curtis and William Burnaby Greene, on the same station—and, 8\r\nDec. 1827, and 26 July, 1828, as first, to the Terror and Meteor bombs,\r\nCapts. Wm. Fletcher and David Hope. As a reward for his distinguished\r\nexertions on the occasion of the wreck of the Terror, Mr. Hotham was\r\npromoted by the Lord High Admiral to the rank of commander on the 13th of\r\nAugust, 1828. After an interval of half-pay he obtained an appointment\r\non the 17th of March, 1830, to the Cordelia, 10, and returned to the\r\nMediterranean, whence he ultimately came home and was paid off in\r\nOctober, 1833—having been raised to post-rank on 28 of the preceding\r\nJune, in compliment to the memory of his uncle, the late Vice-Admiral\r\nHon. Sir Henry Hotham, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. His next appointment was, 25\r\nNov., 1842, to the Gorgon steam-sloop, stationed on the S.E. coast of\r\nAmerica. In Nov., 1845, having assumed command of a small squadron, he\r\nascended the river Parana, in conjunction with a French naval force under\r\nCapt. Trèhouart, and on 20 of that month, after a hard day’s fighting,\r\nsucceeded in effecting the destruction of four heavy batteries belonging\r\nto General Rosas at Punta Obligado, also of a schooner-of-war carrying 6\r\nguns, and of 24 vessels chained across the river. Towards the close of\r\nthe action he landed with 180 seamen and 145 marines, and accomplished\r\nthe defeat of the enemy, whose numbers had originally consisted of at\r\nleast 3,500 men, in cavalry, infantry, and artillery, and whose batteries\r\nhad mounted 22 pieces of ordnance, including 10 brass guns, which\r\nlatter were taken off to the ships, the remainder being all destroyed.\r\nThe loss of the British in this very brilliant affair amounted to 9\r\nmen killed and 24 wounded. In acknowledgment of the gallantry, zeal,\r\nand ability displayed throughout its various details by Capt. Hotham,\r\nhe was recommended in the most fervent terms of admiration by his\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Rear-Admiral S. Hood Inglefield, in his despatches\r\nto the Admiralty, and he was in consequence nominated a K.C.B. 9 March,\r\n1846. Since 13 May in that year he has been employed as commodore on\r\nthe coast of Africa, with his broad pennant successively flying in the\r\nDevastation and Penelope steamers. While Sir Chas. Hotham was in the\r\nGorgon, that vessel was blown far on shore in a hurricane at Colonia, and\r\nit was only by the most indomitable and procrastinated exertion on the\r\npart of himself and his crew that she was saved.’\r\n\r\nThe glorious and almost unequalled, and certainly unique, exploits in\r\nthe Parana, here alluded to, are far too important to be passed over\r\nso summarily as in the preceding paragraph, especially as, in a work\r\nof this nature, the history of these transactions, however brief,\r\nserves to furnish some interesting information respecting one of the\r\nmost celebrated and remarkable sites in the entire of that navigation\r\nwhich the diplomatic skill of the same commander has since opened to\r\nthe commerce of the world no less effectually than did his gallantry to\r\nthe combined fleets of England and France seven years previously. Full\r\nprofessional details of the operations will be found in Mackinnon’s\r\n‘Steam Warfare in the Parana,’ published in 1848, in which the writer\r\nsays:—‘The great secret of the success which crowned almost every\r\neffort, with one miserable exception, was due, firstly, to the excellent\r\narrangements which, by the powers of steam, were so perfectly and\r\nexpeditiously carried out; and, secondly, to the admirable nature of the\r\nordnance, and the skilful application of its different branches. Where\r\nthe leader is of great ability, and possesses the confidence of those\r\nunder his command, coupled with such _materiel_ and _personnel_ as Sir\r\nCharles Hotham had in his control, it is not by any means astonishing\r\nthat everything succeeded admirably. It is rare, too, for a British\r\nofficer to combine the talent for languages which Sir Charles Hotham\r\npossesses in such an eminent degree, with the perseverance and skill\r\nrecently evinced in the extraordinary recovery of H. M. ship Gorgon, and\r\nin the after operations in the Parana.’\r\n\r\nA still more emphatic and authoritative tribute to the genius of Sir\r\nCharles is supplied by the diplomatist under whose instruction he\r\nacted at the time, and who, as we have already seen [see _ante_],\r\nhad previously availed himself of his services in the then attempted\r\ninitiation of that European intercourse whose subsequent consummation\r\nhas indissolubly associated the name of Hotham with the peaceful as well\r\nas the warlike annals of South America. Appended is Sir W. G. Ouseley’s\r\ngraphic account of the passage of the Parana at Obligado, the writer\r\nbeing lavish of praise on everybody, but silent as regards himself,\r\nwho was really responsible in every respect for the conception and\r\norganization, if not for the execution, of the whole design.\r\n\r\n    The pass of Obligado, on the River Parana, was the position\r\n    selected for obstructing the passage of the English and French\r\n    vessels employed in completing the blockade of the province\r\n    of Buenos Ayres, by cutting off its communication with the\r\n    provinces on the opposite bank. A blockade of the capital\r\n    only of Buenos Ayres, and of its River Plate shores would,\r\n    of course, be nugatory unless enforced along the course of\r\n    the Parana as far as the limits of that province extend.\r\n    Reinforcements of troops, horses, artillery, and warlike stores\r\n    of all sorts, would continue to be sent across the Parana into\r\n    the province of Entre Rios, from whence continually to renew\r\n    and supply the Buenos Ayrean army invading the Banda Oriental\r\n    and besieging Monte Video. To prevent this and ultimately cause\r\n    a cessation of these disastrous hostilities it was necessary\r\n    to blockade the whole fluvial coast of the province of Buenos\r\n    Ayres. In order, therefore, to effect this blockade a small\r\n    combined squadron of French and English vessels was detached\r\n    from the force in the River Plate to occupy the Parana, as far\r\n    as the effectual enforcement of the blockade of the province of\r\n    Buenos Ayres might require. The boundary between the province\r\n    of Buenos Ayres and that of Santa Fé strikes the Parana at the\r\n    ‘Arroyo del Medio.’ This division, marked by a brook running\r\n    into the river, is about thirty or forty miles above the turn\r\n    in the Parana, called the ‘Vuelta de Obligado,’ which it was of\r\n    course necessary to pass in order to reach the limits of the\r\n    province. It was determined by the Government of Buenos Ayres\r\n    to prevent the combined squadron from proceeding beyond the\r\n    pass of Obligado if possible. But although the preparations\r\n    for defence could not but have been known to hundreds, long\r\n    previous to the declaration of the blockade, as well as the\r\n    fact of works being in progress for barring the passage, the\r\n    construction of batteries, and placing the chain cables,\r\n    vessels, &c., all of which must have occupied much time, it\r\n    is remarkable that no information whatever as to the plan or\r\n    real nature of the intended obstruction could be obtained\r\n    either at Buenos Ayres or Monte Video. Vague rumours did\r\n    reach the admirals commanding in chief, and other officers, of\r\n    preparations in progress, but some reported that vessels were\r\n    sunk in the channel, others said that forts or batteries were\r\n    in course of construction at every commanding point on the\r\n    river; in fact, the true nature of the intended resistance was\r\n    entirely unknown, until some boats which preceded the squadron\r\n    when proceeding up the river were fired upon a few miles below\r\n    Obligado, at a place called San Pedro. And even then it was\r\n    not believed that any serious opposition would be attempted\r\n    to the advance of the blockading flotilla. However, when once\r\n    the fire had been opened by the Buenos Ayreans at Obligado it\r\n    became of course necessary to return it, and the result was the\r\n    general engagement that ensued. When it is recollected that\r\n    the scale on which the defences had been prepared was quite\r\n    unexpected, and that the Buenos Ayrean force employed was much\r\n    greater than was anticipated (amounting to about 4,000 men),\r\n    while the nature of the other obstacles to be encountered was\r\n    previously unknown, it will be evident that the skill and\r\n    experience of the able officer who commanded the squadron were\r\n    put to a severe test, and that it required his well concerted\r\n    arrangements in the plan of attack and the gallantry displayed\r\n    in carrying them into effect, to obtain the successful result\r\n    that added to the high professional reputation of Sir Charles\r\n    Hotham, already too well known to need any tribute here. It\r\n    must also be borne in mind, in order to form a just estimate\r\n    of this successful engagement, that with the exception of the\r\n    steamers and a corvette, the major part of the force consisted\r\n    of a mere flotilla of small vessels, armed for the purpose\r\n    of ascending the river, and that they were for several hours\r\n    exposed at no great distance to a heavy and well-directed\r\n    fire from formidable and skilfully planned batteries. It is,\r\n    however, needless here to give any detailed description of\r\n    the action that resulted in the destruction of the batteries\r\n    and other defences at this place. The despatches of the\r\n    commanders of the English and French squadrons, Sir Charles\r\n    Hotham and Admiral Tréhouart, were published at the time, and\r\n    give a clear account of the manner in which the affair was\r\n    conducted, showing the skill and great gallantry manifested\r\n    generally throughout this affair. Across the pass from the\r\n    Buenos Ayrean shore and batteries to the wooded island in the\r\n    plan and sketch, a number of coasting vessels and river craft,\r\n    chiefly Sardinian, as are most of that class of vessels in\r\n    those rivers, were moored, supporting four large chain cables,\r\n    solidly fastened to the shore on either side, thus presenting\r\n    no trifling barrier to the passage up the river. On the right\r\n    bank (_i. e._ on the Buenos Ayrean side) were constructed\r\n    four batteries, of which two were close to the level of the\r\n    water, and all well placed for defending the approach to the\r\n    barrier of chains and boats. On the opposite, or Entre Rios\r\n    bank, above the chains were anchored a brig of war and some\r\n    gun boats, with heavy guns, out of the line of fire from\r\n    the opposite batteries, but well placed for the annoyance\r\n    of any attacking force. The brig was anchored off the Entre\r\n    Rios shore, near an island, between which and the main land\r\n    the water was too shallow to admit of the brig and gun-boats\r\n    being attacked from that side. The batteries, four in number,\r\n    mounted, according to the despatch of Gen. Mancilla, the Buenos\r\n    Ayrean Commander-in-Chief, twenty-nine guns; the vessel had six\r\n    mounted on one broadside, which, with field-pieces posted in\r\n    the woods, made forty-two guns. The guns were well manned and\r\n    served, chiefly by Europeans and North Americans, and troops to\r\n    the number of about 3 or 4,000 lined the Buenos Ayrean shore.\r\n    Some of the smaller vessels were fired upon as they approached\r\n    the batteries: this was of course returned, and then commenced\r\n    the action, which lasted for several hours, and was kept up\r\n    with much spirit by the Buenos Ayrean batteries, until the fire\r\n    of some of their guns was silenced, when boats were sent to\r\n    break the chains, which service was gallantly effected under\r\n    a heavy fire, and ultimately parties of English marines and\r\n    seamen, (and subsequently French,) were landed, and, led by\r\n    Sir Charles Hotham, succeeded in completely driving the Buenos\r\n    Ayreans from their guns and obliging their forces to retire,\r\n    and the flotilla passed up the river. This very arduous service\r\n    was performed in the coolest and most effectual manner by Capt.\r\n    J. Hope, of the ‘Firebrand,’ Mr. Nicholson, with two engineers\r\n    of the ‘Gorgon,’ and a few men, who proceeded in small boats,\r\n    under a most galling fire, deliberately to break the chains\r\n    with cold chisels and sledge-hammers, after an attempt to\r\n    saw them had failed. The depth of water at Obligado is about\r\n    twenty-five fathoms, in some places (and at certain seasons)\r\n    much more. The stream runs at about four knots, which was of\r\n    course an additional source of difficulty, especially to the\r\n    sailing vessels and boats.\r\n\r\nContinuing the biographical notice of Sir C. Hotham from the point at\r\nwhich Lieut. O’Byrne leaves off, it is only necessary to add, that in\r\nApril, 1852, he was appointed plenipotentiary in that mission with\r\nthe record and anticipation of whose results so large a portion of\r\nthe present volume is occupied. The mode in which he discharged that\r\ndelicate and important trust recommended him to Her Majesty’s present\r\nadvisers as the most fit and proper person for probably as difficult\r\nand onerous a duty as it is possible for the crown to expect at the\r\nhands of a public servant at the present moment, viz., the Governorship\r\nof Victoria, a colony that presents innumerable phases of social and\r\npolitical transmutation and anomaly, of which history affords not only\r\nno parallel, but nothing in the least degree approximating to its\r\nsimilitude. If Sir Charles had been at liberty to follow the bent of\r\nhis own inclination, if he did not feel that to decline such a service\r\nwould in some measure embarrass the executive, it is considered that\r\nhe would have preferred, in these stirring times, seeking the probable\r\nrepetition of such incidents as the Pass of Obligado, and with foes more\r\nworthy of his hereditary fame than he then encountered. The crest of the\r\nhouse of Hotham is, according to the heralds, a demi-seaman issuing out\r\nof the water, holding in his dexter-hand a flaming sword:—supporters,\r\ntwo seamen, habited, and each holding a sword, the point resting on\r\nthe ground, the motto being the significant shibboleth, ‘Lead on.’ Sir\r\nCharles married, in 1853, the Hon. Jane Sarah, (born 1817) relict of\r\nHugh Holbech, Esq., and daughter of Lord Bridport, a name illustrious in\r\nnautical annals, and allied by marriage to one still more famous, that of\r\nNelson; the mother of the present Lady Charles Hotham being niece of the\r\nvictor of Trafalgar, and now Duchess of Bronté.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nHOMEWARD BOUND.\r\n\r\n    Departure from Buenos Ayres.—Arrival at Monte Video.—Guano\r\n    deposits of Patagonia.—Bahia Blanca.—Eligibility of the\r\n    district for an overland route to Chili.—Chilian grant for\r\n    direct steam communication with England.—Accessions to\r\n    steam navigation on the Brazilian coast.—Opening of the\r\n    Amazon.—Departure from Monte Video.—Rough wind and heavy\r\n    sea.—Aspect of Raza under various lights and shades.—Hotel\r\n    accommodation of Rio Janeiro.—A wet day at Bahia.—Consular\r\n    memoranda on Venezuela, Bolivia, and Equador.—Arrival at\r\n    Pernambuco, and meeting with the Olinda.—Arrival at Porto\r\n    Grande.—Seven days’ steaming against the wind.—Madeira in the\r\n    distance.—Arrival at Belem.—Miseries and absurdities of the\r\n    quarantine system.—Towing the Pilot astern.—Passage up St.\r\n    George’s Channel.—Arrival in the Mersey.—Loss of the Olinda and\r\n    the Argentina.—New ocean and river steamers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRAZILEIRA ON HER RETURN VOYAGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBuenos Ayres being the extent of my mission, and expecting the Brazileira\r\nso soon at Monte Video, I hastened my departure for Monday, the 27th\r\nSeptember, when we embarked early, with a very heavy surf, caused by the\r\nnortherly wind blowing right on shore. Few passengers would venture off,\r\nand it took me nearly an hour to reach the Argentina, in a good boat,\r\npulled by stalwart rowers, than whom there are few better than the Buenos\r\nAyreans, thanks to the perpetual practice required in their perilous\r\nroadstead of a harbour. For a place with shallow water, I never saw so\r\nheavy a surf, which renders it most uncomfortable to those who may be\r\ncompelled to embark under such circumstances. We had a fresh breeze the\r\ngreater part of the way, increasing to a strong one as we approached\r\nthe mount of Monte Video, reaching it at dark, so as to get into that\r\nexcellent haven. This, however, we did quite safely, and landed our\r\npassengers in buoyant spirits, and full of admiration of our craft’s\r\nperformance, in the face of such difficulties. Next morning was wet and\r\nhazy, but on its clearing off at about eleven o’clock we were agreeably\r\nsurprised to see our ocean steamer, Brazileira, close to the harbour. She\r\nsoon came to an anchor, two days before her time, to the inexpressible\r\nconfusion of many unbelieving individuals, who had been very prolific\r\nin their forebodings that she would be considerably in arrear of her\r\npromised undertaking. She was the first steamer that ever came direct to\r\nthe River Plate with cargo and passengers, both which were landed, at\r\nMonte Video in thirty-five days, and Buenos Ayres in thirty-six days,\r\nthus completely establishing the practicability of such a communication,\r\nand adding another triumph to the wonders of steam. In such a country it\r\nis a boon that can only be understood and appreciated by degrees, but\r\nevery practical writer on the affairs of the River Plate has pointed to\r\nsteam as the alpha and omega—the one thing needful towards a successful\r\ndevelopment of its resources, and the only element by which these vast\r\ncountries can be rendered available to mankind, or perform their part\r\nin the great work of their Creator. With steam and railways would come\r\nhands and emigration, so much required, and where there is a vast\r\nand lucrative field, perhaps the most lucrative in the world, for its\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the La Plata, and its future destinies, I would say a\r\nfew words on subjects connected therewith, although they may have no\r\nimmediate bearing on the present narrative. I have before remarked how\r\ncomparatively little is known in Europe of the past history of this part\r\nof South America, and of its internal resources. South of Buenos Ayres\r\nthe curtain has been somewhat raised by guano researches on the coast of\r\nPatagonia, which have not resulted in any great gain to the adventurers.\r\nThe climate is too humid, and the expense of drying the guano too great,\r\nto admit of much extension in that trade, which would scarcely have been\r\nopened but for the enterprize arising out of Ichaboe. Buenos Ayres has,\r\ntherefore, lost nothing by this supposed encroachment on her territory,\r\nif it be rightfully hers—a point not altogether undisputed—which is, in\r\nother respects, wide enough, in all conscience, to admit of any multitude\r\nof industrious settlers, if they were disposed to come. Had similar\r\ndeposits of guano to those on the coasts of Chili and Peru existed at\r\nPatagonia, then, indeed, there might have been a reasonable chance for\r\nthe interest on Buenos Ayres Bonds being paid, considerably sooner than\r\nnow seems likely. There is a spot to the southward, called Bahia Blanca,\r\nwith a good bay, and a river running from a long distance westward, that\r\npromises well to become of much future importance. Parish makes allusion\r\nto military operations in that locality, and I found that at Buenos Ayres\r\nseveral parties had their attention directed there, as a place offering\r\nconsiderable advantages, in the centre of large cattle districts, and\r\nthrough which the shortest cut could be made to the south-west coast\r\nof this continent. There is little doubt that if a safe and easy route\r\ncould be established across the country, it would be much frequented,\r\nand by many be preferred to Panama, with its sickly tendencies; a voyage\r\nof thirty or thirty-five days from England, and then a journey of ten or\r\ntwelve days’ might enable the traveller to reach the territory of Chili\r\nthrough a fine country and healthy climate.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of Chili and Peru, the present may not be an inopportune\r\nplace—at least I can now avail of no other—to state that a further link\r\nin the steam chain, wherein Brazil may be expected to play a prominent\r\npart, is that to the west coast of South America, through the Straits of\r\nMagellan, as already indicated in the introductory chapter in reference\r\nto Chili, whose government have granted a subsidy of £12,000 a year for a\r\ndirect steam communication with England; and it is believed this can be\r\nbest effected by having branch steamers from Rio to Valparaiso, making\r\nRio, what it really ought to be, the port of transit for the southern\r\nocean.[119] The mineral wealth of Chili and Peru is still, as all know,\r\nsomething almost fabulous, and the consumption of British manufactures in\r\nthose countries very considerable; so that steamers would be sure of a\r\npaying freight both ways, with abundance of passengers, who would prefer\r\nsuch a route to the inconvenience and expense of crossing the isthmus.\r\nAll that is required to secure to Brazil these important advantages, is\r\na relaxation in its fiscal system, by which steamers can discharge and\r\nload in transit, without being subjected to local dues and restrictions,\r\nwhich are an extinguisher to progress in any country. If they decline to\r\ngive these facilities, Monte Video and the Falkland Islands[120] will\r\nbe only too glad of the opportunity, and wherever it takes root there\r\nit will remain. The question is important for Brazil, as a large number\r\nof vessels now put into Rio in transitu that would follow in the wake\r\nof steamers. Unfortunately, the facilities for dealing with cases of\r\ndistressed vessels are no further advanced than they were fifty years\r\nback: not a graving dock, patent slip, or other convenient apparatus\r\nyet existing in the otherwise noble harbour of Rio Janeiro, although a\r\nfloating sectional dock was in course of construction at Ponta d’Area.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the formidable difficulties in navigating the\r\nStraits of Magellan exist only in name. Winter and summer the passage\r\nis quite easy and practicable, and settlements are taking place by\r\nwhich both sailing ships and steamers can be furnished with stores and\r\nprovisions, whilst there is coal of the country ready to assist the\r\nmovements of steam. But in reality, the dreaded peril of Cape Horn\r\nitself will soon be quite a matter of history,[121] if a halfway house\r\nhereabouts be established, as the proofs already adduced, and now\r\nquoted in a note, render a certainty. The coal is said to be a kind\r\nof bituminous anthracite, which gets up steam very well when mixed\r\nwith English coal. Coal has been found on the coast of Chili of this\r\ndescription, and in places readily accessible for steam purposes. With\r\nthe present high freights for coal shipped hence, the certainty of a\r\nsupply of even inferior fuel of the kind is most important.\r\n\r\nOther lines of steam communication are in process of formation along\r\nthe South American, especially the Brazilian, coast, to connect the bye\r\nports and rivers with the principal cities and towns; and two steamers,\r\ncalled the ‘Santa Cruz’ and ‘Continguiba,’ are shortly to leave for Bahia\r\non this most useful errand; so that, in a few years, we may expect to\r\nfind coasting steamers in Brazil as numerous almost as on our own coast,\r\nconveying to and fro passengers and produce, to the great advantage of\r\nthe country and of our mercantile relations with it.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Company which has undertaken the contract with the Brazilian\r\ngovernment for opening up the navigation of the Amazon has hardly yet\r\nbeen long enough in operation to show what can be accomplished. There\r\nare immense difficulties to overcome in pioneering a navigation of this\r\nkind through such wild, uncultivated, and almost unknown districts;\r\nand without a considerable subsidy, no association would undertake the\r\ntask. Great credit is due to the Brazilian government for making a heavy\r\nsacrifice in order to insure so desirable an object. They are moreover\r\nnegotiating with the Company with the view of correcting the clause of\r\nthe contract which insures to the Company the exclusive privilege of\r\nnavigating the river with steamers. These arrangements will doubtless\r\nbe brought to a successful issue, for a more enlightened and patriotic\r\ncitizen than Senhor Irenêo Evangelista de Souza, with whom the government\r\ncontract was made, does not exist in any country. He has done more\r\nfor the internal advancement of Brazil than any other man; witness the\r\nsplendid establishment at Ponta d’Area, for foundry work, engineering,\r\nand ship building; the short railway to the foot of the Organ Mountains;\r\nlighting the city of Rio with gas, the establishment of a new bank which\r\nhas lately merged into a national one; and, latterly, opening up the\r\nnavigation of the Amazon; besides many other improvements that little is\r\nheard of. Only those personally acquainted with the indefatigable labours\r\nof Senhor Irenêo in such a country can judge of their real beneficial\r\ntendency, or of the gigantic mind required to cope with the difficulties\r\nentailed. Great stir is making by our Yankee friends in this part of\r\nthe world; they have contracted with the Peruvian government for two\r\nsmall wooden steamers, which were sent out piecemeal, and put together\r\nat Pará. Report says very little in favour of the strength or speed of\r\nthese steamers, qualities very essential to such a navigation, exposed to\r\nstrong currents, and impediments from want of a proper knowledge of the\r\nchannel of the river. I believe the Rio Company are building some fine\r\npowerful boats in this country, that will shortly be brought to bear on\r\nthis increasing and, I venture to predict, wonderful traffic.\r\n\r\nMy mission being for the promotion of steam in South America, and\r\nthe main aim and object of this volume being to make known here the\r\ndesirability of, and the field for, such enterprise in that country, I\r\ntrust the foregoing apparent digression in the midst of the return voyage\r\nwill not appear irrelevant.\r\n\r\nLeaving Monte Video on the morning of the 1st October, we steamed down\r\nthe river, with a light breeze and sunny weather; soon passed Flores,\r\nwhich very much resembles some of our channel lighthouses, on a low\r\nisland, a short distance from the land. Before sunset we had left the\r\nisland of Lobos behind, and soon came into a nasty head wind and sea,\r\nwhich lasted for two or three days, causing the vessel to pitch a good\r\ndeal, and making every one uncomfortable. At daylight on the fifth\r\nmorning the mountains of Rio were in sight, the Corcovado towering over\r\nthem. Passing Raza, the scenery is very fine, and will bear oft-repeated\r\ninspection with largely increased advantage, as it varies much with the\r\nparticular period of the day when seen, the lights and shadows being so\r\ndifferent, and changing with each succeeding hour. Early morning throws\r\nits sharp silvery touch over everything, tinting the sides and peaks\r\nof the mountains, which seem floating in mist, whilst the forts and\r\nbuildings of the city have a sombre hue. At mid-day all this effect has\r\ncleared away; the hills stand out in bold relief—bright green is the\r\ndistinguishing character of the landscape—and the glare of white houses\r\nand red tiles meets your eye in every direction. Towards evening the\r\naspect again changes to a deep brown or purple, steeping all things in\r\nmore glowing richness; and presently there is thrown over the whole that\r\npeculiar olive which is quite a reality in the tropics, but the painting\r\nof which looks more or less ideal to the vision accustomed only to the\r\ncomparatively frigid atmosphere of our temperate zone. I merely allude to\r\nthe general character of the scenery, which, of course, varies materially\r\nwith the changes of weather, and needless is it to add that there are\r\noccasional sunsets which no description of language could adequately\r\npourtray.\r\n\r\nWe regret to say that the hotel accommodation of Rio Janeiro is very\r\ndeficient for the size of the place and the extent of traffic passing\r\nthrough it. The best hotels are those of Pharoux and De l’Europe, in\r\nthe city, and the Hotel des Etrangers and Johnson’s Hotel, on the road\r\nto Botafogo, the latter being peculiarly adapted for English ideas of\r\ncomfort, and also long known to English travellers passing through,\r\nas well as a comfortable home to many residents there. The Hotel des\r\nEtrangers is a large, spacious building, now kept by a Frenchman, and is\r\nquite a fashionable resort for deputies visiting Rio for the session, as\r\nalso for foreign diplomatists. The accommodation at Johnson’s Hotel is\r\nlimited, and quite of a select nature. Comfortable boarding-houses, in\r\nour meaning of the term, are very few and far between. The majority of\r\nnew-comers to, or passers-through, Rio, have private friends, to whose\r\nhouses they resort during their brief sojourn; but, undoubtedly, there\r\nis ample scope for much greater accommodation being afforded to ‘man and\r\nbeast’ in this large city. The Emperor of Brazil is said to be coming to\r\nEurope on a tour of some duration. It is to be hoped that not only will\r\nhe be accompanied by a large retinue, but that numbers of the affluent\r\ninhabitants of this capital will also visit the old world at the same\r\ntime; for if so, they can carry back with them no experience that may be\r\nturned to more desirable account in Rio than that which they will derive\r\nfrom an acquaintance with first class British, French, or German hotels.\r\n\r\nAfter four days’ detention at Rio, coaling, taking in cargo, &c., we\r\nleft, on the morning of the 20th October, with some eighty passengers on\r\nboard, for the northern ports of Brazil, Lisbon, and England. Again we\r\nencountered the head wind and sea which had so perplexed us previously,\r\nbetween Monte Video and Rio; but arriving, nevertheless, in three and\r\na half days at Bahia, where we spent a miserably wet day coaling. In\r\nspite of the weather we got away in the afternoon, under a salute from\r\nthe forts in honour of the President[122] of Pará, who was a passenger\r\non board. Forty hours took us to Pernambuco Roads, which we left again\r\non Sunday afternoon, the 16th, once more in direct route for home. The\r\nOlinda was due at Pernambuco, and strange enough, the next morning\r\nwe met her as if a line had been drawn for us to do so. Saluting each\r\nother with two guns, and a reciprocal round of three hearty cheers, time\r\nbeing too valuable for either to stop to satisfy curiosity, we pursued\r\nour respective routes, not a little elated by reciprocal punctuality\r\nand success thus far in our mutual maiden voyage. She looked remarkably\r\nwell, appeared to be steaming fast, and would be in Pernambuco early next\r\nday. Our passenger list comprised fifty, of all denominations, English,\r\nFrench, Brazilians, Portuguese, Argentine, &c.; but it is surprising\r\nhow everything gets into shape and order under such circumstances. We\r\nsighted the Island of St. Paul’s, looking like the white sails of a\r\nvessel, and on Sunday afternoon, the 22nd of October, came to anchor in\r\nPorto Grande, St. Vincent, under seven days from Pernambuco, a distance\r\nof 2,000 miles, very good work it must be confessed, though, perhaps,\r\nnothing to boast of, considering what we had already achieved. Leaving\r\nSt. Vincent the same night, we had to steam against the north-east wind\r\nand waves for seven consecutive days, with no aid from our canvass.\r\nThen we passed Porto Santo, and saw both the Desertas and Madeira at a\r\ngood distance, basking in fine clear weather. The morning of the 3rd\r\nOctober broke splendidly on the coast of Portugal, Cape Espectrial and\r\nthe distant hills in sight, the lower land being shrouded in mist; we\r\nstood towards Cascaes Bay, got a pilot on board, and once more entered\r\nthe Tagus, in the short space of fifteen days from Pernambuco, and\r\ntwenty-one from Rio. We were obliged to bring up at Belem, and undergo\r\nquarantine, although we brought clean bills of health, there being no\r\ncases of fever reported at any of the Brazilian ports. A certificate\r\nfrom four medical men on board attested this fact; as well as our\r\nhaving no invalids on board of any kind. Between twenty and thirty of\r\nour passengers left us here, having to endure the misery of eight days\r\nin the Lazaretto—a castellated looking building, situated on the south\r\nside of the Tagus—they were all transferred, with their luggage, to a\r\nlarge lighter. A more lovely day could scarcely be conceived than the\r\none when we were at anchor at the quarantine station, coaling; most\r\ntantalising to be debarred from availing ourselves of the opportunity\r\nto land and have a run over the city, which many of our passengers had\r\nseen for the first time. As to preventing an importation of yellow fever\r\nby their quarantine regulations, it is a complete farce, as all kind of\r\ncommunication are kept up with the shore; the officers of the ship are\r\nallowed to go on shore to the health office, which is right on the main\r\nroad passing Belem, and the shore is a common thoroughfare; caravans\r\nand people bathing where the boats land. It is difficult to conceive on\r\nwhat grounds these absurd regulations are introduced, unless it be to\r\nannoy and drive away people wishing to visit the place, and as part and\r\nparcel of a system of intolerant restrictions that are enough to paralyse\r\nthe energies of any country. The inconvenience which such restrictions\r\ncause is indescribable, nor can anything justify the infliction in such\r\ncases as ours. If at any time there is really sufficient grounds for\r\nadopting quarantine regulations, they ought to be delighted to remove\r\nthem so soon as the grounds were removed. In the present advanced\r\nstate of civilization, and with the rapid intercourse between nations,\r\nquarantine is almost a barbarity, calculated to shut out the country\r\nthat exercises it from the rest of the world, whilst it is impossible it\r\ncan be efficacious in the manner it is carried on at Lisbon; besides,\r\nthe yellow fever has never been known to travel out of the tropics,\r\nand surely a voyage of twenty or thirty days across the ocean, without\r\na case on board, is sufficient security, even supposing the fever to\r\nexist in the country the vessel comes from. On the other hand, reports\r\nof cholera in England cause an enforcement of quarantine outwards, thus\r\nputting the crowning piece to this mass of absurdity and annoyance. The\r\nsubject cannot be alluded to with common patience, especially when it is\r\npublicly stated that the medical men who have to determine these sanitary\r\npoints have a strong pecuniary interest in the lazarettos, and numbers of\r\npeople prey upon the unfortunate vessel and passengers subjected to these\r\nterrible inflictions. Since my return, however, the Lisbon officials\r\nseem to have become a little amenable to reason and decency, and their\r\npreposterous regulations are in a trifling degree relaxed.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. on the morning of the 1st November we weighed anchor, and\r\nsteamed past Belem, towing a pilot in his boat astern. Our late fellow\r\npassengers in the Lazaretto were assembled at the top of the building,\r\nwaving flags and handkerchiefs, to bid us farewell, and one could\r\nscarcely help feeling melancholy to see so many worthy people stuck up in\r\na kind of cage, for no earthly object but to gratify a morbid sensibility\r\non points sanitary. The pilot would not come on board, as it would\r\nsubject him to perform a given number of days’ quarantine afterwards.\r\nThere was a fresh breeze from the southward, and the rope soon broke,\r\nleaving Mr. Pilot to find his way back to Lisbon, and the steamer to\r\nfind her own way out as best she could. A heavy sea was breaking on the\r\nbar, in which the pilot could not possibly have been towed, so we were\r\nwell rid of him; but it only shows the operation of things under such\r\nan iniquitous system, where a man is well paid for doing absolutely\r\nworse than nothing—being in the way; for how is it possible for a pilot\r\nto direct a vessel when he is towed astern of her, and any directions\r\nhe might give are impossible to be heard? However, we crossed the bar\r\nsafely, and soon passed the Rock of Lisbon, after which our fair wind\r\nvanished; came strong ahead, with a good deal of sea, against which we\r\nsteamed until next day 2nd Nov., when it became calm, and the wind\r\ngradually veered to south-east. Saw Cape Finisterre, and from thence\r\nto St. Agnes Light (Scilly Islands); we were only thirty-five hours in\r\ndoing 450 miles of distance. From Scilly we posted our way up Channel;\r\nwent inside the Smalls; passed close to the Island of Grasholm, a very\r\nwild spot; missed Bardsey, but saw Holyhead Light; had a tug round the\r\nSkerries, blowing hard; at daylight got a pilot on board, and at 11 A.M.\r\nentered the Mersey, exactly twenty-six days from Rio Janeiro, including\r\nstoppages. My trip of 15,000 miles (including the run up the Parana)\r\noccupied me very little over three months, during which time I visited\r\nall the important sea ports of Brazil, Monte Video, Buenos Ayres, &c.,\r\nspending a fortnight in Rio, and about the same time in the La Plata.\r\nThe ‘Brazileira’s’ entire voyage occupied seventy-three days, including\r\neighteen days’ stoppages, clearly proving that it is only a question of\r\ntime for these valuable countries to be brought within the scope of a\r\npleasure trip.\r\n\r\nThe performances of the Brazileira and of her sister ships of our fleet\r\nhad, on the whole, been highly satisfactory, and promised to realize to\r\nthe utmost every anticipation that had been entertained at the period\r\nof the formation of the company. But, alas, for bright visions! two of\r\nthe flotilla unexpectedly, I may say unaccountably, are numbered with\r\nthe departed, and under pretty nearly identical circumstances—both from\r\nshaving too close. The Olinda, wrecked hard by Holyhead, but fortunately\r\nwithout sacrifice of life, in one of those terrible storms that swept\r\nthe British coast the beginning of this year, is a loss to the company\r\nas regards her keeping up the main ocean line. The Argentina had, for a\r\ntime, been a shining light to the numerous passengers between the two\r\ngreat cities on the La Plata, and she is, emphatically, a national loss\r\nto them, as well as to the surrounding district, retarding, in fact,\r\nthe work of civilization and improvement. On a fine, clear, and almost\r\nbreathless evening, still daylight, she carried her temerity so far as to\r\napproach too closely some sunken rocks near the entrance to Monte Video\r\nharbour, going twelve miles an hour at the time, and in a moment her\r\ncareer of usefulness was ended! There was almost a general mourning over\r\nher, so great a favourite had she become, by the rapid and satisfactory\r\nmanner in which she illustrated the blessings of steam navigation in a\r\nregion where, of all others, such agency is most to be desired.[123]\r\n\r\nIn order to repair as speedily as possible the damages caused by the loss\r\nof the Olinda and Argentina, the company have purchased the paddle-wheel\r\nsteamer Menai, well known for her quick passages between Liverpool,\r\nBeaumaris, and Bangor, to replace the Argentina on the station between\r\nMonte Video and Buenos Ayres, until such time as a larger and more\r\nefficient vessel, now in course of construction, and that will be in\r\nevery way worthy of the passenger traffic between those two great cities,\r\ncan be built. They have also sent out the La Plata, a fine new screw,\r\nbuilt by Mr. John Laird, originally intended for the London and Oporto\r\ntrade, and to be called the Bacchante; but now destined to run between\r\nRio Janeiro, Monte Video, and Buenos Ayres, in connection with the ocean\r\nsteamers, which will not proceed beyond Rio Janeiro. In conjunction with\r\nthe above-mentioned vessels, the company intend placing on the line the\r\nImperador and Imperatrice, two steamers also in process of construction,\r\nsame size and power as the Bahiana. Our fleet will thus consist of the\r\nImperador, Imperatrice, and Bahiana, all new ships; the Brazileira and\r\nLusitania, now running; the La Plata, a branch boat; and the two River\r\nPlate passenger-boats. I doubt not the public, as well as the respective\r\ngovernments embraced in this line of steam communication, will consider\r\nthe enterprise as deserving of their especial support.\r\n\r\nA page of my allotted space remains to be filled, and I cannot better\r\noccupy it than with a brief summary of the news brought to the latest\r\nmoment before going to press, viz., that by the Mail, which arrived on\r\nthe 16th of April, with dates from Buenos Ayres, March 4; Monte Video, 6;\r\nRio Janeiro, 17; Bahia, 22; Pernambuco, 25; St. Vincent’s, Cape Verde,\r\nApril 4; Teneriffe, 8; Madeira, 9; and Lisbon, 12, as quoted in the\r\nleading journal of the 17th.\r\n\r\nTranquillity continued undisturbed on the Plate. Business in imported\r\ngoods and manufactures was dull, owing to the total absence of dealers\r\nfrom the interior. Since the blockade of July last upwards of 2,000\r\nhouses had been erected in the city of Buenos Ayres, and buildings were\r\nstill being raised with the greatest rapidity. Trade was expected to\r\nimprove. Articles of consumption were very dear. The supplies of produce\r\nwere very stinted, and at advancing prices. A large portion of the last\r\nclip of wool remained on hand. The following extracts from a letter,\r\ndated Buenos Ayres, March 4, give the latest particulars of political\r\nevents:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Here everything goes on quite smoothly: at least, there is\r\n    nothing within the province to cause any uneasiness. Our\r\n    attention at present is wholly directed to Monte Video,\r\n    where the Brazilian policy is being carried out with rapid\r\n    strides. The only important question for us is how their\r\n    proceedings may be viewed by General Urquiza, as President\r\n    of the Confederation, whether he may make friends with us to\r\n    resist the Imperialists, or join with the Imperialists that he\r\n    may attack this province? Mr Buchental, a wealthy Brazilian\r\n    capitalist and speculator, has crossed over to Chili to consult\r\n    as to the means of forming a railroad from Valparaiso to the\r\n    Rosario. The latest news from the west coast represents nearly\r\n    all the Republics to the north in a state of excitement, but\r\n    we suspect there is a great deal of exaggeration. Mr. Gore,\r\n    British Minister at Buenos Ayres, has gone up the Parana for\r\n    the purpose, it is supposed, of exchanging the ratifications\r\n    of the treaty, and, perhaps, to grace the installation of the\r\n    Constitutional Presidency, which is to take place about this\r\n    time, some say on this very day. If Urquiza is wise, he will do\r\n    the best he can with his own domains, and leave us alone.’\r\n\r\nFrom Rio there is nothing worth noticing, as regards political affairs.\r\nA considerable reaction had taken place in the coffee-market, and prices\r\nwere lower. Supplies regular. From Pernambuco we learn that the South\r\nAmerican and General Steam Navigation Company’s steamer Lusitania\r\nreached Pernambuco on the 18th ult. Great tightness exists in the\r\nmoney-market—more so than had been experienced for a long period.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, the South American and General Steam Navigation Company’s\r\nsteam vessel for the Plate, Menai, was off Cape Finisterre. Our Lisbon\r\naccounts are to the 12th instant. The passengers by the Mail had been\r\nplaced in quarantine for eight days, in consequence of the reported\r\nappearance of yellow fever at Pernambuco. The little rain which had\r\nfallen in Portugal was not sufficient materially to improve the prospects\r\nof the grain harvest, while the cattle in some parts were suffering much\r\nfrom want of food.\r\n\r\n    ERRATUM.—In the hurry of passing the foregoing pages through\r\n    the press, many errors have occurred, which unavoidable absence\r\n    from London, and the nature of my duties in Liverpool, did not\r\n    permit of being corrected in time. For these I must crave the\r\n    reader’s indulgence, promising that they shall not be repeated,\r\n    and that many short comings shall be supplied, in the event of\r\n    another edition being called for, which I am in hopes, from\r\n    the nature of the subject itself, though not from its present\r\n    treatment, will soon be the case. One oversight, however, is of\r\n    too conspicuous a nature not to require notice, namely, that in\r\n    which the printers have confounded the sugar and cotton growing\r\n    province of Paraiba do Norte with the coffee plantations on the\r\n    River Parayba, in the province of Rio Janeiro, there being no\r\n    coffee grown in the former province, and consequently it is to\r\n    the latter the remarks in the text are intended to apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALKLAND ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n    The Falklands recommended by the Colonial Land Emigration\r\n    Commissioners, as a place of Re-fit, Naval Station, and\r\n    Convict Settlement.—The Corporation of the Falkland Islands\r\n    Company.—How it could assist Her Majesty’s Government in\r\n    forming a Convict Settlement.—Proposal to demonstrate\r\n    the superior eligibility of this Colony for a Convict\r\n    Settlement.—Climate healthy.—Fresh Water abundant.—Cost of\r\n    Transport less than that to other Colonies.—Safe Custody and\r\n    Classification.—Geographical position and extent.—Distance from\r\n    the Main.—Little Naval Force required.—Causes of insecurity\r\n    at other Settlements not found at the Falklands.—Detached\r\n    Islands provide against escape.—Guard required less than\r\n    elsewhere.—Provisions cheap.—How supplied.—Cereals may be\r\n    raised.—Employment.—Supply of Convicts need not be gradual.—How\r\n    first comers are to be disposed of.—Preliminary outlay very\r\n    small, and may be recovered.—Opinions of various Servants of\r\n    the Crown.—Two Propositions.—1.

Matthews, Commander of the\r\n    Great Britain Steamer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FALKLAND ISLES\r\n\r\nEngraved by George Philip & Son]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the British Government was disposed to entertain the\r\nidea of placing a Convict Establishment on the Falkland Islands (a\r\npurpose to which they had been applied by their former occupants),\r\nand it appears that this idea was suggested by the representations of\r\nvarious persons employed in the service of the Crown, in and about the\r\nislands, and on the neighbouring continent, to the effect that the\r\nlocality was highly eligible for the purpose; in fact, the Colonial Land\r\nand Emigration Commissioners have strongly recommended these islands\r\nas a place of re-fit for merchantmen, as a naval station, and as a\r\nconvict settlement—and advised that the first operations to promote the\r\nsettlement should be undertaken by a public company. It is because the\r\nattention of Government has been thus directed to the eligibility of\r\nthese islands, that it is thought well to present, in this brief form,\r\na statement of the advantages they naturally present, as well as of\r\nthose that may be secured, should Her Majesty’s Government be disposed\r\nto resume the consideration of forming a convict settlement there, which\r\nwas probably postponed at the date referred to because convenient means\r\nof carrying the project into execution did not then present themselves.\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that any objection was raised to the\r\nlocality itself, nor does it appear that any objection does actually\r\nexist; on the contrary, it may be satisfactorily demonstrated that no\r\nspot in Her Majesty’s dominions is better suited for a convict station.\r\n\r\nA public company now exists, under the style of the ‘Falkland Islands\r\nCompany,’ the primary object of which is to trade in the produce of\r\nthe colony, and which has obtained from the Crown a royal charter,\r\nincorporating it for that purpose. This fact is premised, to render it\r\napparent that, if her Majesty’s Government thinks well to avail itself of\r\nthe company’s services in making arrangements for a convict settlement\r\nat the Falklands, the means needful to carry out the project are not\r\nwanting. The existing establishments in the colony, recently assigned\r\nto the corporation, are already in that state of forwardness, and the\r\ncapital they have at call in this country is sufficient to enable them\r\nto assure Her Majesty’s Government of their capability to undertake\r\nthe immediate supply of all necessaries for a large number of convicts\r\nas soon as they can arrive in the colony; moreover, they are prepared\r\nto provide every description of stores on terms as reasonable as those\r\npaid in any other colony, and in respect to the important items of beef,\r\nmutton, and fuel, at a cheaper rate than they can be supplied elsewhere.\r\nIf, therefore, it be considered desirable to find a new locality for\r\nconvicts (which it appears from public report Her Majesty’s Government\r\nhave it in contemplation to select), this company can assist in carrying\r\nout the object, and it only remains to point out why the Falklands\r\nshould be deemed most eligible in every point of view for the purpose in\r\nquestion. The proposition would seem to be sustained by the following\r\nfacts:—\r\n\r\n1. The climate is remarkably healthy. In proof of this assertion may be\r\nadduced the concurrent testimony of numerous respectable and honourable\r\nmen:—amongst others, Captains Fitzroy, Sulivan, and Robertson, who\r\nconducted the nautical survey—of Dr. Darwin, who accompanied Captain\r\nFitzroy’s expedition—of Weddell, and Captain Sir James C. Ross—of Captain\r\nMackinnon, and Captain Eden, who, together with the late Governor,\r\nCaptain Moody, and Mr. Hamblin, the colonial surgeon (now in England),\r\nall unite in attributing extraordinary salubrity to the climate of\r\nthese islands. That it is considered agreeable may be inferred from\r\nthe existence of the present settlers, some of them men of capital and\r\nstation, who have formed establishments, and resided there for many\r\nyears. The temperature is declared to be remarkably equable, the extremes\r\nof heat and cold, usual in England, being unknown there; then there is a\r\nprevalence of south-westerly gales, which render the air of a peculiarly\r\nbracing character, whilst it is considered far more enjoyable than\r\nthat of European countries situate north of the 52nd or 53rd degree of\r\nlatitude. Fresh water is everywhere found of excellent quality. From\r\nthese authorized statements, it may be taken for granted, that such a\r\ntemperature for active and healthy labour is far better suited to the\r\nconstitutions of men born in the climate of Great Britain, than the\r\nhot and relaxing atmosphere of the equatorial latitudes, whereby the\r\npower and inclination to labour is diminished, whilst residence in such\r\nclimates has the effect of fomenting the evil passions of men under\r\nlittle or no moral or religious constraint.\r\n\r\n2. The cost of transport would be one half of that to any of the existing\r\npenal settlements. This fact being self-evident, requires no testimony\r\nfor its support. The islands lie less than half way between Great Britain\r\nand Australia, California, and China, on the direct route to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n3. This colony is peculiarly well adapted for the safe custody and\r\nclassification of convicts. The Falkland group, situated in the same\r\nlatitude, south, as the English midland counties are, north, consists\r\nof two large islands, comprising an area of 6,400 square miles, and\r\nseveral hundred smaller islands, from 20,000 acres each to islets of one\r\nacre, and the total extent of territory is equal to rather more than\r\nhalf that of the kingdom of Belgium. The numerous detached islands offer\r\nremarkably well-adapted positions for permanent stations, say for a penal\r\nsettlement, whilst the western island combines those advantages that\r\nare requisite to insure the practical working of the forced labour, and\r\nsubsequent reformed settlement, system, which might eventually render the\r\nEast Falkland a flourishing free colony, entirely unconnected with the\r\nconvict establishment. The situation of the islands is wholly isolated;\r\nthe nearest land is Staten Island, distant 250 miles by chart—they are\r\n350 miles from Terra del Fuego, and 400 from the coast of Patagonia\r\nin direct lines, countries either uninhabited, or peopled by savages,\r\nwithout port or shipping—and there is no small shipping trade in or\r\nabout the Falklands. By means of the semaphore, a communication can be\r\nkept up every ten minutes between the extreme western point of the West\r\nIsland and Port Stanley on the extreme east of the group—consequently\r\nthe naval force stationed there need be very trifling. Then the vessels\r\ncalling are all bound round the Horn, or returning from the Pacific, or\r\nwhalers—none of these, wanting men, would take convicts, and there is\r\nnone of that class of shipping on this track that are likely to take\r\nthem off. There are no woods to conceal fugitives, and no means of\r\nconstructing boats or rafts, should any contemplate so wild an adventure\r\nas to try to gain the main, where certain death by starvation, or at the\r\nhands of ruthless savages, would await them. These advantages cannot\r\nfail to be appreciated when the position of this settlement is compared\r\nwith that of Van Dieman’s Land, Norfolk Island, or any of the islands of\r\nthe northern groups in that hemisphere. Here are no native population or\r\nsettlers to be corrupted by contact with convicts—no coasting traffic,\r\naffording constant opportunity for escape, and both of which render safe\r\ncustody costly in other colonies. Norfolk Island, and more particularly\r\nNew Caledonia and the Fidgee group, lie in the track of a host of\r\nindependent traders, men who own and command their ships, and whose\r\noccupation is trading between these islands, Sydney, the Society Islands,\r\nthe Marquesas and the Paumotu Islands, as well as with Valparaiso—whose\r\nexpeditions frequently last two or three years, and who notoriously take\r\npart in the quarrels between the various petty Polynesian kingdoms;\r\nin which cases they not unfrequently undertake to provide the party,\r\nwho is able to pay them for the service, with English soldiers, and in\r\nperformance of such engagements, kidnap convicts as a matter of traffic.\r\nThe existence of this trade, carried on to a considerable extent by men\r\nwho have some of them been convicts themselves, must always render the\r\ncustody of criminals at the islands named both hazardous and expensive.\r\nThe numerous detached islands which form the Falkland group afford every\r\nfacility for classification, and are most of them only approachable\r\non the north-eastern side, the rest of the coast being fringed with\r\nsunken rocks, naturally buoyed by kelp, which render landing or getting\r\noff impossible. The peculiarities of form and position herein noticed\r\nwould render the presence of a large military or civil guard quite\r\nunnecessary—and it will probably appear, that such part of the duty of\r\nan establishment there as appertains to their safe custody and to the\r\nmaintenance of proper order amongst the prisoners, could be carried out\r\nmore economically than at any other station.\r\n\r\n4. Provisions of all kinds would be plentiful at cheaper rates than in\r\nany other colony. Beef, mutton, and pork are in abundance, and could be\r\nsupplied of the best quality at 2_d._ to 3_d._ per lb. Flour, biscuit,\r\nand clothing would have to be imported, probably from England and the\r\nCanadas (until they could be raised in sufficient quantity on the\r\nislands), and as vessels bound round the Horn can obtain fresh supplies\r\nof provisions and water at Stanley, these articles could be landed in the\r\nFalklands at a cheaper rate than elsewhere. Vegetables may be raised in\r\nany quantity required, and white celery and other antiscorbutic plants\r\nare indigenous. Labour is only needed to insure the raising of cereal\r\ncrops, and therefore the supply of such produce would follow the location\r\nof convicts.\r\n\r\n5. Employment would not be wanting. Good building stone and slate exists.\r\nCoal and limestone are reported to have been discovered, but this\r\nrequires confirmation. Timber would have to be imported from our North\r\nAmerican colonies for some purposes, though the quantity of drift from\r\nStaten Island and the neighbouring coasts is very great; and some of it\r\nlarge enough for ship’s repairs. Roads, buildings, public works, the\r\ncollection and preparation of fuel, preparation of stores, &c., would\r\nafford ample occupation for a large number of unskilled labourers, whilst\r\ntradesmen and artizans could be occupied in providing for the other wants\r\nof the community. Convicts of the lowest class could be advantageously\r\nemployed in the construction of slips, quays, a careening dock, barracks,\r\nenclosures for cattle, dwellings for government officers, stone portage,\r\nmilitary works, levelling town allotments, road-laying, brick-making,\r\ndrainage, well sinking, and cutting channels for the supply of water\r\nto the town and shipping. Whilst those of a superior class might have\r\nample occupation found for them in the construction of dwellings for\r\nthemselves, churches, working of salt-works, raising embankments and\r\nplanting, horse-breaking and keeping, tending flocks of sheep and herds\r\nof cattle, curing beef and fish, opening streams for drainage, baking,\r\nbutchering, cutting, washing, and consolidating turf, collecting guano,\r\ngrowing vegetable supplies, making shoes, clothing, cheese, butter, &c.,\r\nfor the consumption of the establishment and exportation; and procuring\r\nfodder for the Government troop of horses; with many other occupations\r\nwhich experience would suggest.\r\n\r\n6. It is less necessary that the supply of convicts should be gradual in\r\nthese islands than in any other of our colonies. The labour of the first\r\ncomers would be mainly directed to providing for their own immediate\r\nwants. These, in the first instance, might be lodged on board of hulks,\r\nthe same that conveyed them out, and their employment would be in the\r\nerection of a large stone barrack, church, gaol, and storehouses, with\r\nsuitable dwellings for the overseers; all as regards the external walls\r\nsound and strong, and on a scale to receive at least double their number,\r\nwith the needful attendants on the establishment. An old line-of-battle\r\nship, jury rigged, could be prepared to receive on board 1,500 to 2,000\r\nconvicts; and such a vessel, after her arrival, would not be required\r\nfor more than a year or two, but would last four or five years without\r\nneeding repairs as a convict hulk. They might afterwards be broken up,\r\nand used as stores in finishing some of the buildings, and for other\r\nsuitable purposes. Wooden barracks constructed in this country might\r\nof course be taken out with the convicts; but a hulk is suggested as a\r\ntemporary dwelling that could more probably be readily found, and would\r\nnot swell the preliminary estimate which it appears always desirable to\r\navoid in the formation of a new establishment. It should not be lost\r\nsight of, that the stiff clay of the islands works up with the stone of\r\nthe ‘streams’ into very sound and durable walls, as witness those of the\r\nold Spanish fort at Port Louis, built, it is said, in 1771, and now in a\r\ngood state of preservation.\r\n\r\nIt results, then, that a convict establishment may be planted at the\r\nFalklands with a very small amount of preliminary outlay on the part\r\nof the Home Government, and that such outlay may speedily be returned.\r\nSuch has been the expressed opinion of nearly all the men, who, being\r\nqualified to form an opinion on such a subject, have had an opportunity\r\nof examining the locality. Amongst these gentlemen, there appear the\r\nnames of Captains Fitzroy, Ross, Mackinnon, and Sulivan, as well as of\r\nMr., now Sir, Wm. Gore Ouseley, who, in his official correspondence some\r\nyears ago, expressed a very decided opinion on this subject. In fine,\r\nthese islands have been recommended by the Colonial Land and Emigration\r\nCommissioners, ‘as a place of transportation, perhaps more eligible than\r\nany other British possession,’ and these gentlemen have already forcibly\r\nsuggested a notice to Parliament on the subject.\r\n\r\nHaving thus demonstrated that no more eligible spot could be found for\r\nconvicts, it only remains to point out specifically what the Falkland\r\nIslands Company should undertake, provided Her Majesty’s Government\r\ndecide to send such persons to the Falklands, and to avail themselves\r\nof the company’s services in so doing:—and then to set forth the highly\r\nimportant results _in a national point of view_ that would follow the\r\nadoption of this measure.\r\n\r\nThe company should contract to furnish all such supplies as the\r\nGovernment might require of them. They should also undertake to employ\r\nconvict labour in the drainage and general improvement of their own\r\nterritory, paying to government a fair rate of wages for such labour; and\r\nthis would provide a considerable source of revenue, as doubtless the\r\ncompany would be only too glad to avail themselves of such a means of\r\nrendering their very extensive possessions really productive, in a far\r\ngreater space of time than they could hope to accomplish it by importing\r\nfree labour, and probably even at less cost.\r\n\r\nThus this colony, hitherto almost overlooked, notwithstanding its very\r\nremarkable geographical position, may become one of the most valuable\r\npossessions of the Crown: and, in times to come, or rather in the time\r\nthat has come, rank in importance not second to Gibraltar, Malta, Aden,\r\nHong Kong, and such other places as are valuable in proportion to the\r\npower they confer on their possessors of maintaining friendly relations\r\nwith the other nations of the earth, or protecting their own interests in\r\nthe present rupture with Russia. The following national advantages would\r\nthus be secured.\r\n\r\nFirst:—We should get rid of the vexed question of ‘What are we to do\r\nwith our convicts?’ and that in a manner not obnoxious to any one of the\r\nobjections raised against other localities.\r\n\r\nSecondly:—Her Majesty’s Government would be relieved from the\r\nembarrassment that must always attend the attempt to retain convicts in\r\nthis country. For the time must come when their terms expire, and then\r\nthe real difficulty of disposing of them must be grappled with. It can\r\nhardly be supposed that the mother country will consent to receive among\r\nher highly moral people those whom the colonies have _una voce_ agreed\r\nto reject. And it would be an injustice and impolicy, that could not be\r\ncontemplated, to condemn such men to constant isolation. In the East\r\nFalkland they may settle, and thence they may insensibly migrate whither\r\nthey list, without the blazonry of their former guilt preceding them,\r\nand thus have really a fair chance of resuming an honest and respectable\r\nposition; which it is, to say the least, extremely difficult for men to\r\naccomplish at the spot whereon they have undergone their punishment, and\r\nconsequently amongst a people where they are branded with disgrace.\r\n\r\nThirdly:—The philanthropist will hail with infinite satisfaction the\r\nestablishment of a settlement which, whilst it provides for the proper\r\npunishment of offenders against the laws, affords the best possible\r\nopportunity of promoting and encouraging genuine reform—a reform that\r\nwould eventually restore the penitent to society, and moreover without\r\nthe outward symbol of past crime that would cause it, by rejecting him,\r\nto drive him back on his evil habits. The process would be accomplished\r\nwithout the risk of any moral stain upon the innocent, and the locality\r\nproposed is physically adapted, by a very remarkable combination of\r\ncircumstances, to the promotion of morality. A _juvenile_ Convict\r\nAgricultural School, on principles already tried elsewhere, might\r\nadvantageously form part of the general system adopted in the Falklands;\r\nand, being entirely separate from the adult establishment, would prove a\r\nvaluable aid in the progress of reformation.\r\n\r\nFourthly:—The most convenient place for re-fit for our merchantmen and\r\nforeigners, as well as for steamers, trading between Europe and the\r\nPacific, would speedily be rendered perfectly available. The enormous\r\nport charges of the east and west coast ports of South America would\r\nbe avoided. Freight would be saved to shipowners, and the comforts of\r\npassing emigrants promoted, by the facility of re-provisioning and\r\nwatering half way. And all this at a port wholly unconnected with\r\nthe convict settlement, where a small dockyard could be economically\r\nconstructed, and would amply and speedily repay the expense incurred.\r\n\r\nFifthly:—Her Majesty’s ships, and those of the merchant navy also, could\r\nundergo repair here cheaper than at any port in those seas—and, if a\r\npatent slip were laid down, more speedily; for at present there is not,\r\nstrange to say, one patent slip south of the line, on all the coast round\r\nto Callao. This important advantage would effect an immense saving in\r\nthe cost of Her Majesty’s squadron constantly kept afloat on the east\r\ncoast, and that also on the west coast of South America, one item of\r\nwhich would be a fortnight to three weeks’ saving of wear and tear on\r\nevery voyage home from the Pacific. This consideration becomes of double\r\nimportance now that Russian men-of-war are known to be in the Pacific on\r\nthe look-out for our merchantmen.\r\n\r\nSixthly:—As lines of steamers are established round the Horn, the\r\nFalklands are the point of all others most suitable for a coaling\r\nstation, (as the documents in this work from the most competent\r\nauthorities have abundantly proved,) and one that in time of war could be\r\neasily rendered impregnable.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, now that war is in reality upon us, with the certainty of\r\nbeing a tolerably long one, it is difficult to exaggerate the advantage\r\nwhich the possession of these islands would afford to Great Britain\r\nin respect to their position, provided proper works were constructed,\r\nfor which there are great local advantages. In this point of view, any\r\nprotracted delay in rendering the Falklands thoroughly available as a\r\nfirst-rate naval station, on the footing of Gibraltar and other places,\r\nwould appear to be an oversight.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above objects may be speedily accomplished with the\r\naccession of convict labour; without it, the prospect of these advantages\r\nis very remote, and their realization might, at any moment, be frustrated\r\nby the colony passing (as heretofore) into the hands of some more\r\nenterprising nation, whose rulers may entertain a shrewd notion of the\r\nvast importance attaching to a naval station that may truly be called\r\n‘the key to the Pacific.’ One position may be advanced as indisputable;\r\nnamely, that now war has involved us with at least one of the great\r\nmaritime powers, the entire Pacific fishery, and the whole trade on and\r\nabout the Western Coasts of America, may come under the absolute control\r\nof the possessors of the Falkland Islands, should a _coup de main_ of our\r\nunscrupulous foe bring about the temporary transfer of the station to him.\r\n\r\nP.S. Since the above was in type, Mr. Bentley has published a work\r\nfrom the pen of Earl Grey, entitled ‘The Colonial Policy of Lord John\r\nRussell’s Administration,’ containing much valuable matter relative to\r\nthe system of transportation, and a brief notice of the Falkland Islands.\r\nRespecting the Falklands, the noble Earl observes, that the object of the\r\nGovernment was—\r\n\r\n    ‘To create a small settlement, where passing ships might re-fit\r\n    and obtain supplies for which these islands, notwithstanding\r\n    the inclemency of their climate, were considered to be\r\n    peculiarly well adapted, from their possessing admirable\r\n    harbours, and lying directly in the track of vessels returning\r\n    to this country from Australia, or the Pacific, by Cape Horn.\r\n    They also afforded considerable resources in the herds of wild\r\n    cattle which are to be found upon them.’ His lordship goes\r\n    on to remark, that ‘An arrangement was concluded by which a\r\n    regular communication will be established between this country\r\n    and the Falkland Islands, by means of a small vessel plying\r\n    between these islands and Monte Video, where it will meet the\r\n    mail steamer from England every alternate month.’ And that,\r\n    ‘Hitherto this settlement has not advanced rapidly; probably\r\n    it would hardly have been expected to do so, unless a larger\r\n    expenditure had been incurred than was considered advisable in\r\n    carrying out and establishing emigrants there; but it seems\r\n    now to have taken root, and will, I trust, do well hereafter.\r\n    Already, from the growing up of some little trade, and from\r\n    land having been brought into cultivation, it has been found\r\n    possible, in the last four years, to discontinue the issue of\r\n    rations from the Government stores to the inhabitants, who\r\n    can now purchase for themselves what they require. Those of\r\n    the working-class can find ample employment at good wages,\r\n    and ships which call there can depend upon obtaining the most\r\n    necessary supplies. The advantages offered by this place of\r\n    call on the long voyage home are beginning to be known, so\r\n    that each year more vessels are stopping there on their way;\r\n    and, from the great increase of the trade with Australia and\r\n    California, it is probable that the port of Stanley (the name\r\n    of the settlement) will be more and more resorted to. I am\r\n    informed that a ship wanting, water or provisions, in the run\r\n    home from Cape Horn, may save not less than from ten days to\r\n    a fortnight by calling at Stanley, instead of Buenos Ayres,\r\n    or Rio de Janeiro besides having no port charges to pay. In\r\n    proportion as more vessels call for supplies, these will be\r\n    furnished more abundantly and better, since private enterprise\r\n    will be sure to meet the demand which the greater resort of\r\n    shipping to the port will create. It is to be hoped, also, that\r\n    the means of re-fitting ships that have suffered in the stormy\r\n    passage round Cape Horn, which already exist to some extent,\r\n    will be increased there in the same manner, and that the plan\r\n    of establishing there a patent slip, which was at one time\r\n    under consideration with a view of its being undertaken by the\r\n    Government, will be taken up as a private speculation.’\r\n\r\nThe annexed official document has been presented to Parliament during\r\nthe present session; and although its date is anterior to that of the\r\nvaluable communication from Capt. Matthews, of the Great Britain, as\r\nalready quoted, it so materially confirms the value of the settlement\r\nas to suggest that Government should lose no time in increasing the\r\ntwo-monthly mail service now existing between the islands and Monte\r\nVideo, and in erecting a patent slip, as they have lately done a\r\nlighthouse; for it is obvious that the Falklands must now assume, in the\r\nconsideration of England, the status to which their political, as well as\r\ntheir geographical, position entitles them:\r\n\r\n_Copy of a despatch from Governor Bennie to the Right Honourable Sir\r\nJohn S. Pakington, Bart.—Government House, Stanley, Falkland Islands,\r\nJanuary 8, 1853.—(Received March 17, 1853.)—Sir,—In transmitting the\r\nBlue Book of this colony for the year ending 31st December 1852, I have\r\nthe honour to report a continuance of the same steady, though not very\r\nrapid progress, which has prevailed in this small community during the\r\nlast four years. The resort of shipping to these islands for supplies and\r\nrepairs, forming one of the chief sources of prosperity, it is gratifying\r\nfor me to observe the progressive increase shown by the returns of the\r\nyear just ended over that of the previous year. In the year ending\r\nDecember 1851, 17,538 tons of shipping from England and foreign parts\r\nentered this harbour; in the year ending December 1852, there were 22,024\r\ntons, being an increase of 4,486 tons. This augmentation necessarily\r\nproduces a demand for produce, labour, and stores of every description,\r\naffording remunerative profits to the storekeepers, and employment at\r\ngood wages to the labouring classes, unskilled 3s. to 5s. per diem, and\r\nskilled 6s. to 10s. Provisions are abundant, and at reasonable prices.\r\nThe transference to the Falkland Islands Company of the large interests\r\nheld by Mr. Lafone, and the commencement by that corporation of a more\r\ncomprehensive system of operation, supported by a large capital, gives\r\nme very favourable hopes of benefit to the colony, and I trust to the\r\nshareholders. It is, however, worthy of remark, that whilst a powerful\r\ncompany, invested with great privileges by Her Majesty’s Government (as\r\nregards its property in land and cattle) has likewise established a\r\nconsiderable mercantile warehouse in the town of Stanley, the general\r\nbusiness is going on so satisfactorily that all the original storekeepers\r\nare now adding to their premises and extending their dealings. The master\r\nof a barque, the Record, lately in the harbour, publicly notified that\r\nhe would take passengers to the gold diggings in Australia at 10l. per\r\nhead, and it gives me much pleasure to add, that not a person could be\r\nfound in the colony to accept his proposition. In the year 1849, I put\r\nup for sale 12 allotments of one acre each, of suburban land near the\r\ntown, suitable for the working classes to build on or to cultivate as\r\ngardens, and the amount idealized averaged 6l. per acre, being three\r\ntimes the usual government price. A few weeks since, having been given to\r\nunderstand that other parties wished to have an opportunity of purchasing\r\nsimilar allotments, I selected 11 of the same extent, but not quite equal\r\nto the former in situation. The prices on this occasion reached 12l. per\r\nacre on the average, or six times the usual fixed sum, and twice that\r\nof 1849. The grumbling and discontent manifested by a portion of the\r\nenrolled pensioners settled here has subsided since the notification\r\nto them by the Secretary-at-War that they were at liberty to return to\r\nEngland if they preferred to do so, nor has even one of them up to the\r\npresent time availed himself of the permission. Small, comparatively, as\r\nthe instances are which I have the honour to communicate, I trust they\r\nmay lead to a more just appreciation of the capabilities and utility of\r\nthis colony, and of the favourable prospects which it affords to steady\r\nand industrious emigrants.—I have, &c. (Signed) GEORGE RENNIE.—The Right\r\nHon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart. &c., &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In reference to the preponderating interest of Liverpool in this\r\ntrade, an influential metropolitan journalist, commenting on the treaty\r\nwith Paraguay soon after its ratification in London, observes:—\r\n\r\n    Liverpool is the very centre and focus of our foreign trade.\r\n    There almost every man you meet is either engaged in commerce,\r\n    or is in the service of those so engaged. Liverpool, like the\r\n    seat of the Pope of Rome—but in a widely different sense—has\r\n    its agents and its commercial missionaries in every climate\r\n    and in every latitude, and there is not one among them who is\r\n    not as intent and energetic in his work as those ‘soldiers\r\n    of the faith,’ whom Rome sent out on the South American\r\n    missions in the two centuries from 1535 to 1735. The fiery\r\n    enthusiasm of Don Pedro de Mendoza himself, who offered\r\n    Charles V. to complete the conquest of Paraguay and the Rio\r\n    de la Plata at his own expense, is equalled by some of those\r\n    indomitable agents of the counting-house, who are as zealous\r\n    for commercial conquests as the Andalusian Hidalgo was for\r\n    the aggrandisement of his Sovereign and master. We doubt that\r\n    even Father Charlevoix himself, so often cited and praised\r\n    by his brother Breton, Chateaubriand, and who has given\r\n    us six volumes of a charming history of Paraguay—which he\r\n    explored in person—exhibited more zeal for the interests of\r\n    his order in the countries watered by the Rio de la Plata,\r\n    the Rio Salado, the Rio Negro, the Catapuliche, and the Rio\r\n    de la Encarnacion, than do those Liverpool junior partners,\r\n    clerks, and supercargoes, who are charged with the interests\r\n    of considerable commercial houses in such distant latitudes.…\r\n    Through the rivers opened to us by the efforts of Lord\r\n    Malmesbury, one-fourth, at least, of the produce of South\r\n    America, must be brought to the market of the world, and of\r\n    this commerce Liverpool will certainly have the largest, and\r\n    Bristol, Glasgow, and London, a considerable share.\r\n\r\n[2] In the original prospectus of the company, whose calculations,\r\napart from two wrecks, as to the performances of their vessels have\r\nsince been so well verified by experience, it was stated that, ‘The\r\nimportance and extent of our trade with Brazil and the River Plate, and\r\nthe necessity which exists for a more perfect postal communication with\r\nthese countries, mainly suggested this enterprise; and, accordingly, the\r\nfirst efforts of this company will be devoted, not only to supply the\r\ndesideratum of a bi-monthly mail, but to afford to shippers of goods a\r\ncheap and speedy conveyance, which the acceleration of the mails over\r\nthe old system of sailing packets renders most desirable; the tonnage\r\nat present employed in the Rio and River Plate trades, from the Port\r\nof Liverpool alone amounts to 30,000 tons annually, while the value of\r\nexports, principally consisting of Manchester and other similar fabrics,\r\nis upwards of three millions sterling per annum. The number of first\r\nclass passengers was, until the establishment of the mail steamers, very\r\ncircumscribed; but since that period it has materially increased, not\r\nless than one hundred per month, each way, being now the average. Of the\r\nsecond class of passengers and the lower description of emigrants the\r\nnumbers who have gone from Great Britain and the continent, by sailing\r\nvessels, has been very great, more than is generally supposed, not fewer\r\nthan 4,000 persons having emigrated to Rio Grande and the southern ports\r\nof Brazil during the last year, while to the River Plate the numbers\r\nfor years past has been still more considerable; and the inducements\r\nheld out to emigrants in both countries are so great, that, with the\r\nadditional facilities afforded by a regular steam communication, a\r\nlargely progressive increase may be fairly calculated on. Thus it will\r\nbe seen that a large field is open for this company’s operations, and,\r\nas the rates of passage proposed to be charged are extremely moderate,\r\nbeing within what has hitherto been obtained by sailing ships, it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that the estimate of the number of passengers,\r\nupon which the requisite calculations are based, is under what may\r\nfairly be expected from this country, the continent, and Portugal. Three\r\nsteam-ships, of from 1,500 to 1,700 tons, and about 300 horse-power,\r\nwill, in the first instance, be built for the Rio line. The vessels will\r\nbe modelled after the most approved principles, and, with the ample\r\npower proposed, it is confidently anticipated that an average speed of\r\nat least 10 knots per hour will be attained. The branch boat will be of\r\nsmaller dimensions, suitable for the navigation of the River Plate. It\r\nis calculated that the passage to Rio will not exceed twenty-five days,\r\nand that the whole distance to the River Plate will be accomplished in\r\nthirty-five days, including the needful detention in Rio to transfer the\r\ncargo and passengers to the branch boat. The average passages of the best\r\nships at present employed is not less than fifty days to Rio, and sixty\r\nto the River Plate.’ The branch boat, it will be seen hereafter, was\r\nlost, as likewise the Olinda, the second ship of the Ocean line, both,\r\nhowever, having been replaced.\r\n\r\n[3] Though the great Genoese came in sight of St. Salvador, Bahama\r\nIslands, on the 11th of October, 1492, it was not until 1497 that he\r\nfound the continent, the same year that Cabot, the son of a Venetian\r\npilot residing at Bristol, discovered Newfoundland, and named it Prima\r\nVista; the year also (or, as some say, the year before), that Amerigo\r\nVespucci, a Florentine in the service of Spain, and subsequently of\r\nPortugal, and again of Spain, reached the east coast, and was fortunate\r\nin giving his name to the entire of the continent, north and south.\r\nThe Bahamas were not known to the English for nearly 200 years (1667)\r\nafter the discovery by Columbus, when Captain Seyle was nearly wrecked\r\nthere while proceeding to Carolina, also discovered by Cabot in 1500.\r\nThe Bahamas were long infested by pirates; but in 1718 Captain Rogers\r\nexpelled them, and the islands became and have since remained the\r\nproperty of the Crown of England, with the consent of Spain, though the\r\nBritish had had a settlement there long previously.\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n    He turned; but what strange thoughts perplexed his soul,\r\n    When, lo! no more attracted to the Pole,\r\n    The Compass, faithless to the circling Vane,\r\n    Fluttered and fixed, fluttered and fixed again!\r\n    At length, as by some unseen Hand imprest,\r\n    It sought, with trembling energy, the West!\r\n    ‘Ah, no!’ he cried, and calmed his anxious brow;\r\n    ‘Ill, nor the signs of ill, ’tis Thine to show;\r\n    Thine but to lead me where I wished to go!’\r\n\r\n                                              ROGERS’ COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n[5] Though his scope embraces no part of the West Coast, nor any portion\r\nof the East Coast beyond the line, the author hopes, by the introduction\r\nof a few of the more prominent facts connected with each republic, to\r\nrender this volume somewhat useful to those of his readers who may be\r\ndesirous of a slight _precis_ of the history and position of the various\r\nstates of South America, but who would, nevertheless, be deterred from\r\nentering upon details of feuds and complications more unintelligibly\r\nperplexing than the records of the dynastic chaos of the Saxon heptarchy,\r\nor the septic entanglements of the earliest Celtic kings. To this\r\nend, therefore, there will be appended a note on each of the outlying\r\ndistricts, if we may so call them, as they occur in the text; and first\r\nin the foregoing order comes\r\n\r\nMEXICO.—After the usual experience of viceregal misrule, common to all\r\nthe Spanish transmarine dependencies, this noble province threw off\r\nthe yoke and asserted its independence in 1820, and virtually achieved\r\nit about a year afterwards, principally through Iturbide, a Spanish\r\nsoldier of great valour and military skill, and who might probably have\r\ndone for the land of his adoption what Washington had effected for the\r\nUnited States. Unlike that great character, however, he abused for his\r\nown selfishness the power he acquired; and, not content with being head\r\nof the state as regent on behalf of the people, he perfidiously caused\r\nhimself to be proclaimed emperor, in 1822, and imperial revenues and\r\nhonours to be decreed to himself and to his family. These measures,\r\nwith many others of a like kind, produced such general defection, that\r\nhe assembled the dispersed members of Congress in the capital, in 1823,\r\nand abdicated, agreeing to reside for the remainder of his life in\r\nItaly, on which condition a large allowance was made him. But, faithless\r\nto his word in this instance, as before, he returned from Leghorn,\r\nthrough England, attempted a revolution, miserably failed in raising\r\nany followers, and was ignominiously shot, at Padilla, in Santander, by\r\nLa Garza, commander of that province, pursuant to instructions from the\r\nprovincial legislature, in 1824. Vittoria, one of the ablest lieutenants\r\nof Iturbide in the war of independence, had been proclaimed president the\r\nyear before; and the year after (’25) a treaty of commerce was ratified\r\nwith Great Britain. Such proceedings, with the recognition that was soon\r\nto follow of the independence of the revolted country, had formed a topic\r\nof urgent interest at the Congress of Verona, in 1822, when, seeing what\r\nwas looming in the future of South America, the Duke of Wellington,\r\nplenipotentiary from England, instructed by Mr. Canning, in continuation\r\nof the policy of Lord Castlereagh, to whom the Duke had just succeeded,\r\npresented a note, stating, that ‘The connection subsisting between the\r\nsubjects of his Britannic Majesty and the other parts of the globe has\r\nfor long rendered it necessary for him to recognise the existence,\r\n_de facto_, of governments formed in different places, so far as was\r\nnecessary to conclude treaties with them. The relaxation of the authority\r\nof Spain in her colonies of South America has given rise to a host of\r\npirates and adventurers,—an insupportable evil, which it is impossible\r\nfor England to extirpate without the aid of the local authorities\r\noccupying the adjacent coasts and harbours; and the necessity of this\r\ncoöperation cannot but lead to the recognition, _de facto_, of a number\r\nof governments of their own creation.’\r\n\r\nAustria, Russia, Prussia, and France (represented by M. de\r\nChateaubriand), diplomatically ignored this overture to humiliate their\r\nroyal brother of Spain by admitting that which they were soon afterwards\r\ncompelled, for their own sakes, to acquiesce in. All the efforts of the\r\nsuccessor of Ferdinand and Isabella ignominiously failed to win back\r\nor retain any portion of the glorious inheritance of the throne of the\r\nIndies. A vast expedition, sent against Mexico, surrendered to the now\r\nsuccessful revolutionists in 1829, a few months after the expulsion\r\nof the Spaniards had been decreed. Unfortunately, however, democratic\r\nanarchy soon supervened upon monarchic despotism; for hardly was the old\r\ntyranny got rid of, than Guerrero, the president, was deposed; and Mexico\r\nhas since been but another word for whatever is most unwise in foreign\r\npolicy or most pernicious in domestic administration. In 1838 war was\r\ndeclared against France, and of course, ended in disaster to Mexico,\r\nafter five months’ duration, the most memorable incidents being the\r\ncapture of the strong fortress of St. Jean d’Ulloa, by Prince Joinville,\r\nwho greatly distinguished himself; and the brave defence of Vera Cruz,\r\nby Santa Anna, who there lost a leg. This soldier of fortune, something\r\nof the stamp of Rosas, having been repeatedly elected to supreme power,\r\ndeposed, exiled, imprisoned, and restored, is once more president,\r\nwith what prospect of continuance it is impossible to tell. Neither\r\nmisfortune, nor experience of the impolicy of excessive severity, seems\r\nto have mitigated the innate ferocity of the man’s character. With a\r\ndefiance of opinion more in consonance with the era of the Borgias than\r\nof constitutional government, or even of a civilized government in the\r\nmiddle of the 19th century, only as late as November last the Dictator\r\ncaused death to be inflicted, by shooting, without the pretext of a\r\ntrial, and as though they were the veriest wild beasts, on Senhor Tornel,\r\nformerly President Arista’s Minister of War, and Senhor de la Rosa, who\r\nwas minister for foreign affairs immediately after the capitulation of\r\nthe city of Mexico, and was the immediate instigator of Santa Anna’s\r\nexpulsion from the country on that occasion, being also the writer of\r\nthe letter officially informing him of his disgrace. Their offence\r\nwas, simply, being obnoxious to the dictator—nothing more. Like Rosas,\r\nhowever, he has evinced more consideration for the foreign creditor than\r\nmight have been expected; and about the period of the barbarity just\r\nnamed, devoted a considerable sum in liquidation of the more pressing of\r\nthese demands, his ability to do so arising, it was said, (though the\r\nauthority is as apocryphal as the circumstance itself) from a donation\r\nby the pope, as an equivalent for the restoration of the order of the\r\nJesuits in Mexico. Others say that his funds have accrued from a sale\r\nto the United States of territory adjoining the present Californian\r\npossessions of the Union; and that, with the proceeds, he means to repeat\r\nIturbide’s experiment in imperial power and title. Be this as it may,\r\nthe area of Santa Anna’s sway, is much less now than it was formerly;\r\nfor, owing to a succession of decisive repulses sustained from the United\r\nStates, with which war was declared in 1846, and carried on till the\r\nbeginning of 1848, Mexico has lost California; Texas having been annexed\r\nto the States in 1846; Yucatan, &c., having also seceded; and now, of\r\nthe once prodigious territory of the Montezumas, and known in Spanish\r\ncolonial history as the vice-royalty of Mexico, there remains, according\r\nto the treaty of 1848, but the comparatively narrow strip of land between\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThis, though only a fragment of what it once belonged to, is still most\r\nrich in minerals, and most fruitful in valuable products, and highly\r\nimportant from its position; but nearly all its natural advantages\r\nare destroyed by the insecurity and deficiencies of its political\r\ninstitutions, and the incapacity and selfishness of those administering\r\nthem among a very numerous population, equal, at least, to that of\r\nScotland, after all the curtailments we have spoken of. It is needless to\r\nacquaint any reader of the public journals, to whom the words ‘Mexican\r\nBondholders’ must be a ‘horrid, hideous sound of woe, sadder than\r\nowl-songs on the midnight blast,’ that the finances of the state are in\r\na condition the reverse of consolatory to creditors. For the precise\r\nnature of those obligations, in whose fulfilment England is so much\r\ninterested, we must refer to the very numerous pamphlets published by\r\nthe various committees appointed in London to advise upon this intricate\r\nand unsatisfactory subject. That there is every desire on Santa Anna’s\r\npart to meet English liabilities, there can be no doubt; one motive\r\nfor his anxiety being, it is said, the achievement of a stock-jobbing\r\n_coup_ on his own account, or, rather, on account of the adventurers\r\nhe is surrounded by. If internal peace could only be secured, the vast\r\nresources of the country, and its unparagoned geographical position,\r\nmidway, as it were, in the very path of the commerce of both hemispheres,\r\nwould soon permit of its financial difficulties being adjusted. The\r\nquestion is, whether Santa Anna, in putting down anarchy—if he can\r\nkeep it down—will not commit excesses as bad as the revolutionists in\r\nan opposite direction? The latter is the tendency of his acts at the\r\npresent; but it is impossible to predicate of such a country what may or\r\nmay not turn up from one hour to another. The representative of Mexico,\r\nhitherto charged, until lately, with the difficult task of negociating\r\nin this country with the English creditors, has been Colonel Facio. The\r\nMexican diplomatic staff in London consists of Senhor de Castillo y\r\nLanzas, 10, Park-place, Regent’s-park, envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary; Don Augustin A. Franco, first secretary; Don José\r\nHidalgo, 2nd secretary; Don Ignacio Luijano, attaché; Don B. G. Farias,\r\n32, Great Winchester-street, vice-consul.\r\n\r\nThough Consuls were sent, for commercial purposes, to nearly all the\r\nimportant ports of the new South American states, as early as October,\r\n1823, it was not for several years afterwards that political or\r\ndiplomatic representatives were despatched. The first was Mr. Alexander\r\nCockburn, as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to\r\nColumbia, February, 1820; second, Sir R. Ker Porter, chargé d’affaires\r\nto Venezuela, July, 1835; third, Mr. Turner, envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to New Granada, June, 1837; and fourth, Mr.\r\nW. Wilson, chargé d’affaires to Bolivia, 1837. These states will be\r\nseverally noticed as they occur in the text. It was in March, 1835, that\r\nSir Richard Pakenham, now British Minister in Portugal [see Lisbon] was\r\naccredited as plenipotentiary to Mexico. At present the same post is\r\nfilled by Mr. Percy William Doyle (many years chargé d’affaires there)\r\nwhose salary is £3,600, with £400 a-year house rent; secretary of\r\nlegation, William Edward Thornton, salary, £600; paid attaché, Mr. A.\r\nH. Hastings Berkeley, salary, £200; and an unpaid attaché. The annexed\r\nlist exhibits the names and salaries of the British consular corps in\r\nMexico:—Mexico, F. Glennie, consul, £400; Vera Cruz, F. Giffard, consul,\r\n£500; Tampico, consul, Cleland Cumberlege, £500; San Bias, Eustace W.\r\nBarron, consul, £300; Mazatlan, S. Thomson, vice-consul, £150; Acapulco,\r\nCharles Wilthew, consul, £400.\r\n\r\n[6] In the month of February, 1554, he addressed a long letter to the\r\nemperor,—it was the last he ever wrote him,—soliciting his attention\r\nto his suit. He begins, by proudly alluding to his past services to\r\nthe Crown: ‘He had hoped, that the toils of youth would have secured\r\nhim repose in his old age. For forty years he had passed his life with\r\nlittle sleep, bad food, and with his arms constantly by his side. He had\r\nfreely exposed his person to peril, and spent his substance in exploring\r\ndistant and unknown regions, that he might spread abroad the name of\r\nhis sovereign, and bring under his sceptre many great and powerful\r\nnations. All this he had done, not only without assistance from home,\r\nbut in the face of obstacles thrown in his way by rivals and by enemies,\r\nwho thirsted like leeches for his blood. He was now old, infirm, and\r\nembarrassed with debt. Better had it been for him not to have known the\r\nliberal intentions of the emperor, as intimated by his grants; since he\r\nshould then have devoted himself to the care of his estates, and not have\r\nbeen compelled, as he now was, to contend with the officers of the Crown,\r\nagainst whom it was more difficult to defend himself than to win the land\r\nfrom the enemy.’ He concludes with beseeching his sovereign to ‘order the\r\nCouncil of the Indies, with the other tribunals which had cognisance of\r\nhis suits, to come to a decision; since he was too old to wander about\r\nlike a vagrant, but ought, rather, during the brief remainder of his\r\nlife, to stay at home and settle his account with Heaven, occupied with\r\nthe concerns of his soul, rather than with his substance.’ This appeal\r\nto his sovereign, which has something in it touching from a man of the\r\nhaughty spirit of Cortez, had not the effect to quicken the determination\r\nof his suit. He still lingered at the court, from week to week, and from\r\nmonth to month, beguiled by the deceitful hopes of the litigant, tasting\r\nall that bitterness of the soul which arises from hope deferred. After\r\nthree years more, passed in this unprofitable and humiliating occupation,\r\nhe resolved to leave his ungrateful country and return to Mexico. He had\r\nproceeded as far as Seville, accompanied by his son, when he fell ill\r\nof an indigestion, caused, probably, by irritation and trouble of mind.\r\nThis terminated in dysentery, and his strength sank so rapidly under the\r\ndisease, that it was apparent his mortal career was drawing towards its\r\nclose.—_Prescott._\r\n\r\n[7] PERU.—Referring to what has been already said as regards Mexico for\r\na general notion of the relationship between Spain and her colonies,\r\nwhen the spirit of revolt began to develope itself in the latter, it\r\nis only necessary to add here that, since its emancipation, Peru has,\r\nlike all the congeries of republics of which it forms one, been a prey\r\nto civil dissension and military turmoil. Of late years its increasing\r\ncommerce, the vast pecuniary means it has discovered, in its guano\r\nislands, of meeting its engagements with the European creditor, and\r\nthe comparatively pacific spirit that prevails in its councils and in\r\nthose of the neighbouring states, are producing their natural results;\r\nand, despite occasional exceptions, there is every reason to look for\r\na prosperous future. The conquest of Peru having been effected with\r\ninfinitely more ease than that of Mexico, as far as the mere military\r\nresistance of the natives was concerned, it continued for nearly 300\r\nyears subject to Spain, and formed its last stronghold in that quarter\r\nof the world. The history of the struggles for independence, from the\r\ntime that the first Protector, San Martin, [see Chili, page 18] entered\r\nthe country with the combined Chilian and Buenos Ayrean army, and\r\nproclaimed its freedom at Lima, the capital, in 1821, till the Spaniards\r\nwere finally expelled, would embrace the biography of the commander\r\njust named, and the still more celebrated one, Bolivar, who, with his\r\nvictorious troops from Columbia, to which he had given liberty in 1821,\r\nmainly contributed to the liberation of Peru, whereof he became President\r\nin 1825, San Martin retiring in 1822, with these memorable words:—‘I\r\nhave proclaimed the independence of Chili and Peru; I have taken the\r\nstandard with which Pizarro came to enslave the empire of the Incas;\r\nand I have ceased to be a public man.’ Bolivar ran through pretty much\r\nthe same vicissitudes of popular caprice as we have recounted in the\r\ncase of Santa Anna, though an incomparably superior character in every\r\nrespect; and, after numberless feuds, and escaping plots against his\r\nlife by those he had raised to power, was on the point of returning from\r\nvoluntary seclusion, on his patrimonial estate, to assume once more the\r\ndirection of affairs, in obedience to the voice of the public, who,\r\ntoo late, found out that he was the only man for the occasion, when he\r\ndied in 1830, in his 47th year, leaving behind the highest reputation\r\nwhich South American history has afforded, not only as a commander\r\nand an administrator, but as a constitutional legislator. Repeated\r\nrevolutions have since ensued, partly caused by rivalries of internal\r\nfactions, and partly by the hostilities of neighbouring states, which,\r\nbeing themselves torn with dissension, and constantly changing their\r\nterritorial status, have rendered war upon Peru, or on the part of Peru,\r\nalmost unavoidable. This is the case at present; Bolivia, under its\r\nPresident, Belzu, having invaded Peru, and protracted hostilities being\r\ncertain. Under such circumstances it is hardly necessary to add, that\r\nthe finances of the country have been inadequate to its expenditure,\r\nand that, consequently, the foreign creditors have fared exceedingly\r\nill. Of late, however, the prospects have greatly improved, owing to the\r\nimmense demand for that peculiar manure which is found in the condition\r\nmost approved by agriculturists on the Peruvian coast, and in the next\r\ngreatest perfection on the neighbouring coast of Chili, whence, indeed,\r\nthe first cargo, which created so much interest, was brought a few years\r\nback into Liverpool, causing small observation, however, for a long time.\r\nBut, unluckily for the foreign creditor and the true interests of the\r\nPeruvian government, the latter fixed so high a price on the commodity,\r\nas to create a complete monopoly, attended with most of the mischiefs\r\nof which all monopolies are the parents. Until the close of the last\r\nyear, it was imagined that the supply of this most essential ingredient\r\nin farming economy was literally inexhaustible, and that the cost to\r\nthe consumer might be kept up at the original excessive rate. About\r\nthat period, however, it was ascertained, through a survey instituted\r\nby Admiral Moresby, commanding the British squadron on the West Coast,\r\nthat at the then rate of demand (and it has gone on increasing since) the\r\nwhole stock (many millions of tons though it was) would be exhausted in\r\nthe course of about twenty years. Moreover, as the discovery, first, of\r\nthe unique virtues of guano, and, secondly, of its deposit in the finest\r\nknown quality and greatest quantity here, were purely accidental, it is\r\nnot improbable, indeed is regarded as certain, that there will also be\r\ndiscoveries of other excellent fertilizers of a like kind, and of other\r\nvast deposits of guano, if not quite so excellent, yet sufficiently so\r\nto deprive Peru of its principal customers at existing rates. Should\r\neither of these occurrences take place—should it be found, as Lord\r\nClarendon anticipated, in answer to a deputation on the subject, that\r\nnitrate of soda is extractable from the immense heaps of fish refuse\r\non the Newfoundland coast, and will supply, as chemists believe, the\r\nfructifying element of guano; or should it be found that those deposits\r\nof guano in more damp latitudes,—the Falklands, for instance—will admit\r\nof being profitably freed from the effects of moisture, of course the\r\nvalue of the Peruvian commodity will decline accordingly, and so will the\r\nprospects of the bondholders, who have probably been amongst the greatest\r\nof all the sufferers from the _mala fides_ and impoverishment of South\r\nAmerican debtors. A species of new bonds have recently been created, to\r\nthe great detriment of the interest of the holders of the old ones, and\r\nthe dissatisfaction is extreme, especially as the government, instead of\r\nbeing warned by the facts we have recounted in respect to guano, and by\r\nthe discovery of valuable guano islands by North American citizens in\r\nthe Caribbean Sea, have actually advanced the price of the commodity to\r\nthe extent of the recently enhanced freights, as compared with the usual\r\nrates of shipping charges.\r\n\r\nApart from the monetary, the diplomatic credit of Peru has always\r\nbeen respectably sustained at the Court of St. James’s. The corps at\r\npresent consists of Don Manuel de Mendiburu, minister plenipotentiary;\r\nDon Francisco de Rivero, consul-general, 78, Grosvenor-street,\r\nGrosvenor-square; Don Emilio Altheus, D. M. Espantosa, and Major D. S.\r\nOsma, attachés. Consul’s-office, 6, Copthall-court. Consuls—J. E. Naylor,\r\nLiverpool; R. J. Todd, Cardiff; John G. Dodd, Newcastle-upon-Tyne; Edward\r\nWright, Dublin.\r\n\r\nEngland is represented in Peru by Mr. S. H. Sullivan, chargé d’affaires\r\nat Lima; salary as such £1,700 a-year, besides the usual £1 per diem\r\nallowed to all functionaries of that class discharging consular duties.\r\nUntil last year (1853) the diplomatic salary was £2,000. At Callao, the\r\nport of Lima, the salary of the consul (Mr. J. Barton) has also been\r\nreduced from £500 to £200, but the fees of office still make the post\r\nvery lucrative. At Islay, the vice-consul, Mr. T. Crompton, receives\r\n£500; and at Arica and Payta, Mr. G. H. Nugent and Mr. Alexander Blacker,\r\nvice-consuls, £300 and £100 respectively.\r\n\r\n[8] CHILI.—Though probably none of the Spanish conquests in South\r\nAmerica were effected with greater ease than that of Chili—a sort of\r\ndependency on the Incas of Peru, and faithful to their cause long after\r\nit was lost at head-quarters—nowhere were the natives impressed so\r\nmuch at first with the superiority of the invincible stranger, a sum\r\nequivalent to half a million of ducats being presented to Almagro, in\r\nrecognition of his ‘divinity’ when he crossed the Cordilleras; yet none\r\nof their acquisitions, subsequently, cost the conquerors more trouble.\r\nNotwithstanding the scandalous cruelties of the invaders, it was not\r\ntill 1546, ten years after Valdivia (a second lieutenant of Pizarro’s)\r\nhad entered their country, that resistance was wholly put down. The\r\nChilians, the last in being subdued, were also among the first to take\r\nadvantage of the troubles of the mother country in her decrepitude and\r\ndecline. On the invasion of Spain by the French, and the rout of the\r\nSpanish Bourbons in 1809, Chili, affecting to be solicitous for the\r\nsovereignty of Ferdinand VII., and to be desirous of administering the\r\ngovernment of itself in his name, established a junta in the capital,\r\nSt. Jago, in 1810, and ultimately avowed itself a decided separatist.\r\nSpain, however, was still able to make head against the revolutionists;\r\nand after a series of encounters, in which fortune alternated rapidly,\r\nshe vindicated her authority by a very decisive victory at Rancagua, in\r\n1817. This, however, did not prevent the popular party triumphing at\r\nChacabuco, in the same year, and seizing on the capital. Again the king’s\r\ntroops succeeded at Chancarayada; but, once more, and conclusively, the\r\nrepublicans carried all before them in the eventful battle of Maypu, in\r\n1818, though it was not till the beginning of 1826 that the province\r\nwas finally freed from the presence of the peninsular cohorts, and\r\ndeclared independent, the old country itself, however, refusing any such\r\nrecognition till 1842, when a treaty of peace and friendship was signed\r\nat Madrid, and ratifications exchanged in 1845. Throughout these wars\r\nthe most conspicuous revolutionary leader was General San Martin, a\r\nsoldier of Irish origin, as his name imports,[9] being one of the many\r\nof his countrymen whom the struggles for independence brought forward in\r\nthe Spanish colonies, in none more so than in Chili, the first Supreme\r\nDirector, as the officer elected by the juntas was originally called,\r\nbeing Barnardo O’Higgins, with whom were associated Col. O’Leary, General\r\nMiller, and numerous others ‘racy of the soil’ of saints and shillelaghs.\r\nOf all the European celebrities, however, who figured on the stage\r\nof South American strife, none are to be compared to the heroic Lord\r\nCochrane, now the venerable Admiral Earl Dundonald, who, having fitted\r\nout a ship of his own in England in the cause of the patriots, and being\r\nappointed to the command of the Chilian fleet, coöperating with the land\r\nforces of Bolivar, displayed that characteristic skill and enterprise\r\nwhich have so preëminently distinguished him throughout his chivalrous\r\nand romantic career, some few incidents of which will be found mentioned\r\nin our notice of a congenial and no less heroic spirit, Admiral Grenfell,\r\nof the Brazilian service, in which Dundonald played a conspicuous part.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have said already, both of Mexico and also of Peru, it will\r\nnaturally be inferred that Chili has suffered greatly from internal\r\ndisorders; but, unlike those countries, she has contrived to avoid\r\na very onerous national debt; and consequently her credit abroad is\r\ncomparatively very good; indeed, better probably than that of any South\r\nAmerican state, save Brazil, whose securities rank next to those of Great\r\nBritain itself. The recent gold discoveries in California and Australia\r\nhave immensely increased her export trade, and will continue to do so\r\nfor an indefinite period; while a large source of domestic revenue\r\nhas been opened up by the possession of guano islands (of which more\r\nhereafter), second only in extent, and scarcely second in richness, to\r\nthose treasures of a like kind whereof we have spoken under the head of\r\nPeru, the example of which country is followed as to the maintenance of\r\nthe price of the article at an exorbitant rate.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian diplomatic and consular corps in England consists of\r\nSpencer N. Dickson, consul, 8, Great Winchester-street, London; W. W.\r\nAlexander, consul, Bristol, Cardiff, and Newport; William Jackson,\r\nconsul, Liverpool; Thomas W. Fox, jun., consul, Plymouth; James H.\r\nWolff, consul, Southampton; John W. Leach, consul, Swansea. The British\r\ndiplomatic and consular corps in Chili consists of the Hon. E. J. Harris,\r\nchargé d’affaires at the capital, St. Jago, salary £1,600, and the usual\r\nconsular allowance of £1 per diem; consul at Valparaiso, Mr. Henry Rouse,\r\nsalary £300, reduced from £700; consul at Coquimbo, Mr. David Ross,\r\nsalary £300; and vice-consul at Conception, Mr. Robert Cunningham, salary\r\n£250—all exclusive of fees.\r\n\r\n[9] His aid-de-camp was General John O’Brien, afterwards accredited by\r\nthe Banda Oriental, or State of the Uruguay, as diplomatic representative\r\nto England, where he contributed greatly to familiarise the British\r\npublic with the bearings of the Plate Question, and to popularise the\r\ncause of Monte Videan resistance to the aggression of Rosas. In this\r\nobject he was essentially assisted by his learned and accomplished\r\ncountryman, Mr. W. Bernard Macabe, a distinguished London journalist,\r\nand well-known author in historical and miscellaneous literature, who\r\ndischarged the duties of acting consul-general for the Uruguay in London\r\nfor some years, till the end of 1852, when he proceeded to Dublin, where\r\nhe has since prosecuted his intellectual avocations with his customary\r\nassiduity and success. The General, we believe, is now residing in\r\nhonoured retirement, in his old age, in the neighbourhood of Valparaiso,\r\non a property allowed him by the Government of Chili, to whose original\r\nindependence his exertions materially contributed.\r\n\r\n[10] The subject of this poem is the establishment of the Portuguese\r\nempire in India; but whatever of chivalrous, great, beautiful, or\r\nnoble, could be gathered from the traditions of his country, has been\r\ninterwoven into the story. Among all the heroic poets, says Schlegel,\r\neither of ancient or modern times, there has never, since Homer, been any\r\none so intensely national, or so loved or honoured by his countrymen,\r\nas Camoens. It seems as if the national feelings of the Portuguese had\r\ncentred and reposed themselves in the person of this poet, whom they\r\nconsider as worthy to supply the place of a whole host of poets, and as\r\nbeing in himself a complete literature to his country. Of Camoens they\r\nsay,\r\n\r\n    Vertere fas; æquare nefas; æquabilis uni\r\n    Est sibi; par nemo; nemo secundus erit.\r\n\r\nFew modern poems in any language, have been so frequently translated as\r\nthe ‘Lusiad.’ Mr. Adamson, whose ‘Memoirs of the Life and Writings of\r\nCamoens’ must be familiar to the reader, notices one Hebrew translation\r\nof it, five Latin, six Spanish, four Italian, three French, four German,\r\nand two English. Of the two English versions one is that of Sir R.\r\nFanshawe, written during Cromwell’s usurpation, and distinguished for\r\nits fidelity to the original; the other is that of Mickle, who, unlike\r\nthe former, took great liberties with the original, but whose additions\r\nand alterations have met with great approbation from all critics—except,\r\nas indeed was to be expected, from the Portuguese themselves.—_Dr.\r\nCauvin._—In the course of the present year (1854) another English\r\nversion, from the pen of Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of New\r\nSouth Wales, and formerly on the staff in the Peninsula, has been issued\r\nby Messrs. Boone, of Bond-street, in one volume, with an engraving, said\r\nto be an excellent likeness, of the poet.\r\n\r\n[11]\r\n\r\n    ‘Eu sou aquelle occulto, e grande Cabo,\r\n    A quem chamais vos outros Tormentario;\r\n    Que nunca a Ptolemeo, Pomponio, Estrabo,\r\n    Plinio, e quantos passaram, foi notorio:\r\n    Aqui toda a Africana Costa acabo\r\n    Neste meu nunca visto promentorio,\r\n    Que para o polo Antartico se estende,\r\n    A quem vossa ousadia tanto offende.’\r\n\r\n                                              CAMOENS, canto 5, verse 50.\r\n\r\n    ‘In me the spirit of the Cape behold,\r\n    That Rock by you the Cape of Torments named,\r\n    By Neptune’s rage in horrid Earthquake framed,\r\n    Where Jove’s red bolts o’er Titan’s offspring flamed.\r\n    With wide-stretch’d piles I guard the pathless strand,\r\n    And Afric’s southern mound unmoved I stand;\r\n    Nor Roman prow, nor daring Tyrian oar,\r\n    Ere dashed the white wave foaming to my shore;\r\n    Nor Greece, nor Carthage, ever spread the sail\r\n    On these my seas to catch the trading gale.\r\n    You, you alone, have dared to plough my main,\r\n    And with the human voice disturb my lonesome reign.’\r\n\r\n                Mickle’s Translation of this verse, the ‘Lusiad,’ p. 205.\r\n\r\n[12] STEAM THROUGH THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN TO THE PACIFIC.—In a work like\r\nthis, almost specially devoted to an exemplification of the achievements\r\nand the prospects of steam enterprise in South America, we take the\r\nearliest opportunity of placing on record the efforts of a gentleman,\r\nwho, in those distant waters first explored by Magellan, and through the\r\nvery straits named after that daring navigator, conducted a steamer to\r\nthe West Coast long before the Royal Mail Company, as mentioned in our\r\nprefatory remarks, sent any of their paddle-wheels to the East Coast.\r\nThe first steamers that ever navigated these straits were the Peru and\r\nChili, belonging to the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, under the\r\norders of Captain George Peacock, a gentleman well known in connection\r\nwith naval steam tactics, now superintendent of the Southampton docks,\r\nand vice-consul for the Uruguay at that port. Leaving England in command\r\nof the Peru, in July, 1840, and touching only at Rio de Janeiro for a\r\nsupply of fuel, he anchored in Port Famine, Patagonia, on the 13th of\r\nSeptember, after a passage at sea of only 43 days. These vessels, built\r\nby Messrs. Curling and Young, of Limehouse, were contracted and fitted\r\nout with great care, under the superintendence of Captain Peacock, being\r\nalso rigged on a new plan proposed by him, whereby they were enabled to\r\nproceed under sail alone during a great part of the voyage, the steam\r\nonly having been used for 21 out of the 43 days occupied between Plymouth\r\nand Port Famine. This was an unprecedented feat in the annals of steam\r\nnavigation up to that period, and has scarcely been surpassed since, as\r\nthese vessels carried out a large amount of general cargo to Valparaiso,\r\nbesides their spare machinery, and a great quantity of stores, proving\r\nthe importance of all steamships for long voyages, whether screw or\r\npaddle-wheel, being fully and properly rigged. The Pacific Steam\r\nNavigation Company was projected in 1833 by William Wheelwright, Esq., an\r\nenterprising American gentleman, who had passed many years on the West\r\nCoast of South America, and who obtained exclusive privileges, from the\r\nChilian and Peruvian governments, for establishing steam in the Pacific,\r\nprovided steamers were placed on the coast within a given period. On Mr.\r\nWheelwright’s arrival in England he found great difficulty in forming a\r\ncompany, although no one doubted but that the navigation and requirements\r\nof the West Coast were, perhaps, better adapted for steam navigation than\r\nany other spot on the face of the globe. Unfortunately for the projector,\r\nthe extreme pressure of the money-market at that time, coupled with the\r\ndistance of the intended scene of operations, the want of confidence\r\nin the grants of South American states, and the political changes to\r\nwhich they were exposed, all conduced to impede the enterprise; and,\r\nafter passing upwards of three years of untiring patience and suffering,\r\nnumberless anxieties, heart-sickening vexations, and even personal\r\nprivations (the fate of too many enterprising men in the prosecution of\r\nnew and useful projects), and when his capital was nigh wrecked, and\r\nhis favourite scheme about to be abandoned as hopeless, he had the good\r\nfortune to meet with the late Lord Abinger, who, together with the noble\r\nmembers of the Scarlett family, warmly espoused the undertaking, and\r\nwith the aid of other kind friends, the company was at length formed,\r\nand, towards the close of the year 1839, two vessels, of 750 tons and\r\n180 horse power each, were contracted for. The keels were laid Jan.,\r\n1840, and the ships built, launched, fitted out, and sent to sea in\r\nJuly, within a period of seven months, no expense being spared to effect\r\nthis object, with a view of saving the privileges to be conceded by the\r\nChilian government.\r\n\r\nThis proved to be impracticable, notwithstanding the extraordinary\r\nexertions that had been made, owing to the vexatious annoyances of\r\nthe port authorities at Rio de Janeiro, who exacted such stringent\r\nregulations and created such difficulties, that the steamers were delayed\r\nfourteen days, where 48 hours would have sufficed. The fine harbour of\r\nPort Stanley, at the Falkland Islands, was not then known to possess the\r\nfacilities it now does for such repairs, nor were there at the time the\r\nnecessary means of effecting them; otherwise Captain Peacock, who has the\r\nhighest opinion of that harbour, and has urged it as a port of call and\r\nfor coaling on the captains of all sailing or steam-vessels coming home\r\nfrom Australia by Cape Horn, would have at once resorted to it, and so\r\nsaved the almost ruinous delay and vast expense occasioned him at Rio.\r\nThe consequence of this detention was, that the vessels did not arrive at\r\nPort Famine, the southern-most harbour claimed by the republic of Chili,\r\nuntil the 13th of September, whilst the privileges, already alluded to,\r\nexpired on the first of that month.\r\n\r\nBy the 18th of September both ships were completed with wood and water,\r\nevery man, from the captain downwards, assisting in sawing and splitting\r\nup drift-wood, found in abundance along the shores of the harbour, an\r\nAmerican axe having been provided for each person on board, together with\r\ncross-cut saws and iron wedges, for such object, before leaving England.\r\nThis day, being the ‘diesiocho,’ or great anniversary of the Chilian\r\nIndependence, Captain Peacock caused a beacon, 30 feet high, with a large\r\ndiamond-shaped head, to be erected on the heights of Santa Anna, the\r\nwestern point of the entrance; and, hoisting the Chilian flag upon it at\r\nnoon, saluted the same from the guns of both ships, accompanied by three\r\nhearty British cheers; and having buried a parchment manuscript at the\r\nfoot of the beacon, in a sealed jar, descriptive of this event and the\r\nparticulars of the voyage, &c., together with a few new coins of the year\r\n1840, the steamers proceeded into the Pacific, accomplishing the passage\r\nfrom ocean to ocean, a distance of 300 miles, in 30 hours’ steaming. Four\r\nyears subsequently, the Chilian government sent a vessel of war, and took\r\nformal possession of this harbour, for a convict establishment, naming\r\nit Port Bulnes, after the President at that time in power, when a fort\r\nwas built round the before mentioned beacon, the jar was dug up, and the\r\nmanuscript, &c., taken to St. Jago, the capital, and there lodged in the\r\ngovernment archives. Upon the arrival of the steamers at Valparaiso, by\r\na representation to the government, the privileges of the company were\r\nimmediately renewed for a period of ten years; and probably nothing has\r\ncontributed so much to the advancement, welfare, and prosperity of the\r\nChilian and Peruvian republics, as the successful establishment of steam\r\nnavigation upon this coast, where the names of Don Guilliermo Wheelwright\r\nand Don Jorje Peacock, will perhaps never be forgotten, as they certainly\r\nought not to be. The Chilian government, in the course of last year,\r\n(1853) renewed its relations with the Pacific Company for continuing\r\nsteam communication with England, through the Straits, and also for\r\nextending steam intercourse to other parts of Europe, in connection with\r\nthe vessels now rounding the Horn, granting liberal subsidies for that\r\npurpose. See end of chapter on Amazon.\r\n\r\n[13] Captain Denham, R.N., who has been sent on an exploratory cruise in\r\nthe various Archipelagoes of the Southern Pacific, in hope of meeting\r\nwith an eligible depôt for convicts, whom the cessation of transportation\r\nto Australia (or at least to all except the Western portion) has thrown\r\non the hands of the home government, very much to the embarrassment of\r\nthe executive, and to the consternation of the community; for, as was\r\nforeseen when the project was first mooted, not only do the British\r\npublic dread the introduction among them of the class known in France as\r\n_libres forçats_, but the former honest associates of these domesticated\r\n‘emancipatists,’ to use an antipodean phrase, will not consort with them;\r\nhasten to denounce them to their employers as ‘black sheep;’ forcibly\r\ndrive them from amongst them; and, in fact, surround them with such\r\nannoyances that their existence becomes intolerable in the society of\r\nany but those who are qualifying for, or have already graduated at, the\r\nhulks. The consideration of this subject will be found pursued at some\r\nlength in treating of the Falklands. These islands are in every way\r\nadmirably adapted, both to meet the difficulties just mooted, as to the\r\ndisposal of our felonrie, and to supersede the labour of Capt. Denham,\r\nshould he even be successful in discovering a spot in the southern\r\nhemisphere that is not open to innumerable objections on the score—1st,\r\nof propinquity to other islands; 2nd, being at double the distance of the\r\nFalklands from the mother country; and 3rd, the cost of conveyance being\r\nproportionably great; saying nothing of the expensiveness of founding a\r\nnew settlement in a place that is already deserted, or from which the\r\naborigines, if any, must be removed.\r\n\r\n[14] The History of Brazil—his _opus majus_, a work on which he hoped\r\nto base the remembrance of his name—now appeared, the most conspicuous\r\nand elaborate of his works, and written _con amore_. It forms a branch\r\nof the more extensive History of Portugal, which he had no leisure\r\nto complete. The materials from which this work was constructed had\r\nbeen collected by his uncle, the Rev. Herbert Hill, were unrivalled in\r\nvalue, and accessible to him alone. No political bias interrupted the\r\nstraightforwardness and breadth of his judgment; and his poetic fervour\r\nfound scope in the character of the clime, the productions of the soil,\r\nand the features of savage life, which he describes in the most glowing\r\ncolours.—Life of Southey, by Charles T.

A Series of Letters under the Signature of ‘Inca.’ By M. F.\r\nMAURY, LL.D., Lieut. U. S. Navy; who, under date, Washington City,\r\nJanuary, 1853, says: ‘These Letters were originally published by the\r\nNational Intelligencer and the Union, of this City. They treat of one\r\nof the most important commercial questions of the age: they are eagerly\r\nsought after in all parts of the country; and though they have been\r\nextensively read, the demand for them in a more permanent shape than\r\nthat of a newspaper is such that the Publisher has obtained leave of\r\ntheir Author to re-issue them in their present form.’ On the recent\r\nvisit of Professor Silliman to Humboldt, at Berlin, the veteran explorer\r\nexpressed his great gratification at the progress which enterprise was\r\nmaking throughout South America, especially in the region of the Amazon;\r\nand made particular mention of the Professor’s countryman, Lieutenant\r\nMaury, of whose work we are now speaking, and from which we shall draw\r\ncopiously hereafter. In giving the gallant Lieutenant all praise,\r\nhowever, we should not omit to acknowledge how much the reading public\r\nof this quarter of the globe are indebted for their previous knowledge\r\nof the same region to another countryman of his, whose excellent little\r\nvolume has lately been re-issued in England in a cheap form, by Murray,\r\nviz., A Voyage up the River Amazon, including a Residence at Pará, by W.\r\nH. EDWARDS; of which it was justly said that it was a work valuable for\r\nthe information it gave on this very little known part of the world, and\r\nlikely to excite many adventurous young men to explore the Amazon, so\r\nthat going back on the traces of Orellana, and crossing to the Pacific,\r\nmay probably become, ere long, as familiar to our countrymen as a voyage\r\nup the Rhine or the Nile. Mr. Edwards’ charming little volume has led\r\nto such exploration; and the interesting results will be found in our\r\nchapter upon the Amazon, which we are particularly desirous of drawing\r\nattention to.\r\n\r\n[20] According to the official returns for the twelvemonth ending March\r\nlast, the amount of British tonnage entered inwards from Portugal\r\nconsisted of 7 steam and 735 sailing-vessels; the total amount of both\r\nclass of vessels being 71,536 tons. The amount of British tonnage cleared\r\noutwards for Portugal consisted of 7 steam and 716 sailing-vessels; the\r\ntotal amount of tonnage being 76,662. Great Britain receives nearly\r\na half of all the exports of Portugal, and Portugal only receives\r\none-fiftieth of all the exports of Great Britain.—It appears from\r\nM’Gregor’s ‘Synthetical View of Legislation,’ that in 1851, the total\r\namount of the exportations of Great Britain and Ireland was about\r\n£75,000,000, of which only £1,048,356 was to Portugal! being less than\r\nthe amount sent by Great Britain and Ireland to Chili and Peru! Whereas,\r\nin the United States the consumption of British goods has doubled since\r\n1841, and now amounts to nearly one-fifth of all the British manufactures\r\nexported.\r\n\r\n[21] It is so needless to tell any one entering the Tagus, much less any\r\none who has entered, how topographically accurate is the description in\r\n‘Childe Harold,’ that the stanzas are quoted merely to save the reader\r\nthe trouble of referring to the volume itself, in case he do not quite\r\nremember the lines:—\r\n\r\n      The horrid crags, by toppling convent crown’d,\r\n      The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,\r\n      The mountain-moss by scorching skies embrown’d,\r\n      The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,\r\n      The tender azure of the unruffled deep,\r\n      The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,\r\n      The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,\r\n      The vine on high, the willow branch below,\r\n    Mix’d in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.\r\n\r\n      Then slowly climb the many-winding way,\r\n      And frequent turn to linger as you go,\r\n      From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,\r\n      And rest ye at ‘Our Lady’s house of woe;’\r\n      Where frugal monks their little relics show,\r\n      And sundry legends to the stranger tell:\r\n      Here impious men have punish’d been, and lo!\r\n      Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,\r\n    In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a hell.\r\n\r\n[22] Next to Byron, the great modern English literary name associated\r\nwith this part of Portugal, and not merely from his residence here, but\r\nfrom his delightful and extraordinary pourtrayal of the conventual life\r\nof the neighbourhood, in his almost posthumous work, the ‘Monasteries\r\nof Alcobaça and Batalha,’ is he whom the noble bard alludes to in the\r\nwell-known lines:—\r\n\r\n      On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,\r\n      Are domes where whilome kings did make repair;\r\n      But now the wild flowers round them only breathe;\r\n      Yet ruin’d splendour still is lingering there,\r\n      And yonder towers the Prince’s palace fair:\r\n      There thou, too, Vathek! England’s wealthiest son,\r\n      Once form’d thy Paradise, as not aware\r\n      When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,\r\n    Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.\r\n\r\nBeckford, as is well known, soon after his return to England, built\r\nthe fairy-like structure of Fonthill Abbey, gorgeous as his own Caliph\r\nVathek, and, like it, as unsubstantial; for, on its being sold to Mr.\r\nFarquharson for some £40,000, about one-seventh of what it cost, [the\r\ncatalogues describing its contents were in prodigious demand at a guinea\r\na piece] it fell to the ground. He died in 1844, aged 84; and was father\r\nto the late Duchess of Hamilton, and father-in-law to the present Duke of\r\nHamilton and Duchess of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n[23] At this convent was educated Don John VI., grandfather to the\r\nlate ‘Lusian’s luckless Queen,’ who died in 1816 in Brazil, from the\r\nmelancholy derangement from which Dr. Willis, who had attended George\r\nIII. for a similar malady, was unable to recover her. The young prince\r\nwas placed here with the idea of his wearing the cowl as abbot, prior to\r\nattaining the highest ecclesiastical honours; but the unexpected death\r\nof his elder brother made him heir to the throne, which he afterwards\r\nfilled. Of the suitability of the structure for so august an inmate,\r\nthe late Lord Carnarvon, who visited it in 1827, says:—I rode through a\r\nbleak but not unpleasant country to Mafra. The convent and palace united\r\nconstitute an immense pile of building, which excites admiration rather\r\nfrom its vast extent than from any architectural merits, and forms a\r\nquadrangle, measuring 760 feet from east to west, and 670 feet from north\r\nto south. The church is situate in the centre, and three hundred cells\r\nare placed behind the choir; the palace might perhaps contain without\r\ninconvenience all the courts of Europe. The thermometer had risen to more\r\nthan 90°, and it was indeed no common luxury to exchange such intolerable\r\nheat for the refreshing temperature of the convent galleries, which are\r\nbuilt of stone, and are high, wide, dark, and apparently interminable.\r\nWithin those massive walls the fluctuations of the external atmosphere\r\nare never felt; and rarely indeed do any external sounds pierce through\r\nthose mighty barriers. The monks showed us the refectory, a spacious\r\napartment, and the library, well stored with books.—Portugal and Galicia,\r\nwith a Review of the Social and Political State of the Basque Provinces.\r\nBy the Earl of CARNARVON. Third Edition.—London: John Murray, Albemarle\r\nStreet. 1848.\r\n\r\n[24] The mention of the English burial-ground, in Lisbon, induces us\r\nto correct an error into which the recent religious persecutions in\r\nItaly have betrayed some of our countrymen at home, as to the supposed\r\nexistence of such practices in Portugal. Such a mistake is perfectly\r\nnatural, but it is wholly unfounded; for, though the religion of the\r\nstate is strictly Roman Catholic, of the most unmitigated character,\r\nstill, like Brazil, though unlike Spain, there is toleration for all\r\nreligions, and no impediment thrown in the way of their being observed.\r\nA Portuguese resident in London, writing to a leading journal on the\r\npoint raised in consequence of the iniquitous treatment of the Madiai\r\nand others by the Duke of Tuscany, says:—‘The liberality and toleration\r\nof the Portuguese government towards Protestants, either resident\r\nor travelling, in Portugal, has existed for ages past. That line of\r\nconduct has never been altered, and for the truth of this assertion\r\nI appeal to the British Legation at Lisbon, and to the very numerous\r\nand respectable British commercial body connected with that country. A\r\nBritish subject has as much civil and religious liberty in Portugal as\r\nhe can possibly enjoy in his own country. Christianity and civilization\r\nwere first carried to Asia, Africa, and America, by that nation which\r\nhis Lordship so much depreciates, and the door of that vast empire which\r\nGreat Britain possesses in India was opened by the inhabitants of that\r\nsoil.’ The imputation on the religious liberality of Portugal excites\r\nsome indignation in that country, and a letter from Lisbon, in one of\r\nthe papers, at the beginning of the year, says:—Not only since the\r\nestablishment of the constitution, but even during the absolute regime,\r\na large measure of toleration was always allowed to all other religions.\r\nThe English and German Protestants have long had churches and cemeteries\r\nof their own, and, unlike their brethren in Spain, are allowed to bury\r\ntheir dead with as much ‘pomp and publicity’ as they please. The only\r\nrestriction imposed upon people of other persuasions is, that they shall\r\nnot, by word of mouth, or in writing, revile and insult the established\r\nreligion of the country. This restriction, which was formerly operative,\r\nhas now, however, become a dead letter, the real religion of the liberal\r\nparty generally being materialism, against which nobody here seems\r\ndisposed to declaim. At the beginning of the present year, (1854), a\r\nstatement, signed by many of the principal British residents in Oporto,\r\nappeared in the London journals, setting forth that the most unreserved\r\nliberty for the performance of Protestant Service, with any degree of\r\npublicity, was allowed in that city, and had been for a great number of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[25]\r\n\r\n      Lo! Cintra’s glorious Eden intervenes\r\n      In variegated maze of mount and glen.\r\n      Ah, me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,\r\n      To follow half on which the eye dilates,\r\n      Though views more dazzling unto mortal ken\r\n      Than those whereof such things the bard relates,\r\n    Who to the awe-struck world unlock’d Elysium’s gates?\r\n\r\nSir Wm. Napier’s correction, in his History of the Peninsular War, of the\r\nblunder about the supposed site of the convention, is well known, but\r\ndeserves to be repeated:—\r\n\r\n    “The armistice, the negotiations, the convention itself,\r\n    and the execution of its provisions, were all commenced,\r\n    conducted, and concluded, at the distance of thirty miles\r\n    from Cintra, with which place they had not the slightest\r\n    connection, political, military, or local; yet Lord Byron has\r\n    gravely asserted, in prose and verse, that the convention was\r\n    signed at the Marquis of Marialva’s house at Cintra; and the\r\n    author of ‘The Diary of an Invalid,’ improving from a poet’s\r\n    discovery, detected the stains of the ink spilt by Junot upon\r\n    the occasion.”\r\n\r\n[26]\r\n\r\n                As when to them who sail\r\n    Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past\r\n    Mozambic, off at sea, north-east winds blow\r\n    Sabean odours from the spicy shore\r\n    Of Araby the blest.—Paradise Lost, Book iv.\r\n\r\nThe voyage from Portugal to India was, in those days, more perilous\r\nthan will easily be believed in these. The seas swarmed with pirates,\r\nshipwrecks were dreadfully frequent, and even when these dangers were\r\nescaped, the common mortality was so great, that Vieyra says—‘If the\r\ndead, who had been thrown overboard between the coast of Guinea and the\r\nCape of Good Hope, and between that cape and Mozambique, could have\r\nmonuments placed for them each on the spot where he sunk, the whole way\r\nwould appear like one continued cemetery.’ Hyperbolical as this is, it\r\nshows how enormous the expenditure of life must have been, which could\r\nthus be spoken of in the pulpit! The ship in which Camoens sailed was the\r\nonly one of the fleet which reached its destination.\r\n\r\n[27] The middle classes promenade with their families until the sun\r\nbegins to have effect, when they return to breakfast and to business.\r\nDinner is usually served from noon till 2 p.m., and consists of sopa,\r\nvaca cozida, e arroz, (soup, boiled beef, and rice,) with occasionally\r\nhum prato do meio (a dish of roast for the centre). Potatoes are seldom\r\nor never used, excepting in the kitchen. Fish is only eaten on fast-days,\r\nand the delicious sardine (because common and plentiful) shares the\r\nfate of the potatoes. The common vin ordinaire of the country is drunk\r\nat table out of small tumblers, being supplied from a neighbouring\r\ntenda (wine-store) daily or hourly, as it may be required, at a price\r\nnever exceeding 2d. per pint. Fine old bottled wine (such as we are\r\nacquainted with) is altogether unknown in Portugal, and it would be\r\nalmost as rare to find in any house a couple of dozen bottles of wine,\r\nas it would be to discover as many books. Fire-places have not yet\r\nbecome general in dwelling-houses. In cold weather, gentlemen in society\r\nwear capotes (large cloth cloaks), and ladies wrap up in thick shawls.\r\nDinner-parties are quite uncommon; but social evening meetings, where\r\ntea and simple biscuits are the only refreshments, are of constant\r\noccurrence.—_Forrester’s Essay._\r\n\r\n[28] These peculiar latine sails are exquisitely beautiful when seen in\r\nprofile and, when beheld in front, resemble a butterfly perched on a dark\r\nground with expanded wings.—_Carnarvon._ British naval architects will\r\nprobably be surprised to hear that the Portuguese craft of every kind are\r\nall prime built and beautiful models, the elegance of their lines being\r\na source of admiration to every critic. The Oporto fishing-boats, in\r\nparticular, are fine specimens of the country’s capacity for this sort of\r\nexcellence, and, when under sail, fly through the water at the rate of 12\r\nto 14 knots an hour.\r\n\r\n[29] In the days of Pliny, we are told, the provinces of Minho, Galicia,\r\nand Asturias paid not less than a million and a half octaves of gold to\r\nthe Roman Empire, as a tribute on the ore extracted from various mines\r\nthen in active operation, and yet, in the present day, the revenues\r\nderived by the Portuguese Government from all their mines does not amount\r\nto more than £72 17_s._ The Romans worked mines of gold, silver, iron,\r\nlead, coal, antimony, copper, quicksilver, bismuth, arsenic, and tin,\r\nin Portugal: and Faria e Souza graphically remarks, ‘Hardly is there a\r\nriver, or mountain-base that it laves, which does not cover precious\r\nstones and grains of gold.’ This language may be considered poetic,\r\nbut there is no doubt that ‘le sol de Portugal est essentiellement\r\nmetalifere,’—that metals abound throughout the whole country; but\r\nthe mines are not worked; neither can their value be correctly\r\nascertained, in the absence of every means of transport, and internal\r\ncommunication.—_Forrester._\r\n\r\n[30] Hints to Travellers in Portugal, in Search of the Beautiful and the\r\nGrand.

Coutinho, Oporto. 1852.\r\n\r\n[32] There is scarcely any difficulty now in going to Portugal, for a\r\nsteamer sails from Southampton for Lisbon on the 7th, 17th, and 27th\r\nof every month, or on the following day, when any of those days should\r\nfall on a Sunday, and generally enters Vigo Bay in three days; and,\r\nweather permitting, calls off Oporto, and arrives in five or six days\r\nat Lisbon, from which city a steamer occasionally sails for Oporto, at\r\nwhich place the traveller is recommended to commence his excursions,\r\nthe province of Minho excelling all others in Portugal in whatever is\r\nfertile and picturesque, and being equal, if not superior, in grandeur to\r\nthe district of the Estrella Mountains. The ordinary mode of travelling\r\nis on horses or mules, which can be hired for about 5_s._ 6_d._ per\r\nday, including their food; but the arrieros who accompany them must be\r\nmaintained at the cost of him who hires them, and he likewise expects to\r\nreceive a gratuity. The money of the country is calculated in reis, and\r\ntaking the mil rei, or 1,000 reis, to be equal to 4_s._ 6_d._, the value\r\nof the current coin will be nearly as follows:—_In Silver_: The Cruzado\r\n_novo_, or 480 reis = 2_s._ 2_d._; the 12 Vintem piece, or 240 reis =\r\n1_s._ 1_d._; the 6 Vintem piece, or 120 reis= 6½; the 3 Vintem piece, or\r\n60 reis = 3¼_d._; the testoon, or 100 reis = 5½_d._; the Half Testoon, or\r\n50 reis = 2⅓_d._—_In Gold_: Moidore, or 4,800 reis = £1 1_s._ 8_d._; the\r\nsmall gold piece, or 5000 reis = £1 2_s._ 6_d._; the gold piece, or 8000\r\nreis = £1 16_s._ The English sovereign circulates in Portugal for 4500\r\nreis. The copper coins in general circulation are the following:—The 5\r\nreis, equal to little more than 0¼_d._; the 10 reis, equal to little more\r\nthan 0½_d._; the 20 reis, or Vintem, equal to little more than 1_d._; the\r\n40 reis, or Pataca, equal to little more than 2_d._\r\n\r\nOur political relationship with Portugal, from the personal family\r\nalliances between the two countries, and from other causes, has of late\r\nyears been kept up at great expense; and, according to some critics,\r\nwith very little good to any but the individuals at whose instance and\r\non whose behalf British interference has taken place, the Portuguese\r\npopulation being understood to be as little pleased with its effects as\r\nEnglish taxpayers are enamoured of its expense. Ostensibly our diplomatic\r\nand consular corps now in Portugal consists of the following members, and\r\nat the salaries annexed to their names:—Envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary, Rt. Hon. Sir Richard Pakenham, K.C.B., salary £4000 per\r\nann.; and house-rent £500; secretary of legation, W. R. Ward, salary\r\n£500; paid attaché, Jos. Hume Burnley, £250; unpaid attachés, Hon. W. G.\r\nCornwallis Elliot, and Hon. Francis Pakenham. Consuls:—Lisbon, William\r\nSmith, £600; vice-consul, Jeremiah Meagher, £300; Oporto, Edwin Johnston,\r\n£500; Loanda, Geo. Brand, vice-consul, £50; St. Michael (Azores) T. C.\r\nHunt, consul, £400; Fayal, J. Minchin, vice-consul, £100; Terciera, J.\r\nRead, vice-consul, £100. Of the officers at Madeira and Cape Verds,\r\n(Portuguese possessions) due mention will be made under those heads. The\r\nPortuguese diplomatic and consular staff in England consists of:—Envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, Count de Lavradrio, 12,\r\nGloucester Place, Portman Square; secretary of legation, Chevalier Pinto\r\nde Soveral; attachés, E. F. de la Figaniere, J. C. Stone, and Geo.\r\nManders; consul-general, F. J. Vanzeller, 5, Jeffrey Square, St. Mary\r\nAxe; consuls: Liverpool, Almeida Campos; Bristol, Ant. B. de Mascarenhas;\r\nCork, Geo. Manders.\r\n\r\n[33] A Sketch of Madeira; containing Information for the Traveller, or\r\nInvalid Visitor. By EDWARD VERNON HARCOURT, Esq. With Sketches by Lady\r\nSusan Vernon Harcourt.—London; John Murray, Albemarle Street. 1851.\r\n\r\n[34] You must not look for many pretty faces in Madeira after the age of\r\nthirteen: amongst the upper classes inertness, and amongst the lower,\r\nhard work, reduce the standard of beauty. The upper class of women\r\nare hardly ever seen in the streets, save on their road to mass, or\r\nwhen going to pay a visit; on these occasions all the jewels, plate,\r\nand ribbons, of apparently very ancient families, are to be seen in\r\nfull display. The ladies generally live on their balconies, watching\r\npassers-by. The English ladies, going to church draw forth many fair\r\nbeholders and critics, and on Sundays the balconies are lined with native\r\nfashion. The glory of the Madeira women is their hair, which is of the\r\nrichest growth and blackest hue, and their eyes, which are dark and\r\nbright.—_Harcourt._\r\n\r\n[35] One of these traditions is very gracefully and attractively told\r\nby Mr. Charles Knight, in his agreeable volumes, published by Murray, a\r\ncouple of months back, and entitled ‘Once upon a Time.’\r\n\r\n[36] Lodgings in Madeira are plentiful and good. For a family, the most\r\ncomfortable plan is to take a _Quinta_, that is to say, a house with a\r\ngarden, standing in the suburbs of the town. The price asked for the\r\nseason of six months varies according to their size, from £50 to £200.\r\nIn such cases the tenant is supplied with everything but plate and house\r\nlinen. For single persons the boarding-houses are least troublesome, as\r\nwell as most economical: a bed-room, sitting-room, attendance, and board\r\nare obtained there for fifty dollars, or £10 8_s._ 4_d._ a month. These\r\nhouses are conducted on a liberal scale, and every English comfort is\r\nprovided. If a _Quinta_ is taken, a supply of servants, board, plate\r\nand linen, may be procured at a given rate. It is inconceivable what\r\nannoyances you are saved by such an arrangement; besides the endless\r\nimpositions practised upon the ignorance of foreigners by servants and\r\ntradesmen, it is no small luxury to be able to pay a given sum down\r\nmonthly, instead of the interminable daily payments which the ready money\r\nsystem of Madeira requires. Plate, furniture, pianofortes, saddles, guns,\r\nand, in fact, any things that are brought out as _luggage_, are allowed\r\nto pass through the Custom House free of charge, on the bond of some\r\nresident householder being given that the owner of the property will\r\nexport it in eighteen months. Portuguese servants may be hired for house\r\nand kitchen work at the rate of about from four to six dollars per month\r\nfor the former, and from six to eight dollars for the latter, service.\r\nThose who are content with a plain table, average honesty, and moderate\r\nattention, have no reason to be dissatisfied. Provisions of all sorts are\r\ncheap. English bread, which is sold at 2½_d._ the pound, is the dearest\r\narticle of food; the quality of it, however, is excellent. Mutton, which\r\nis an indifferent meat, fetches from 3½_d._ to 4_d._ a pound; beef, which\r\nis good, from 3½_d._ to 4_d._; and veal, from 4_d._ to 5_d._ Fowls may be\r\npurchased at from 10_d._ to 1_s._ 3_d._ a couple. The markets are held at\r\ndaybreak, and all the meat, the best fish, and best fruits are brought at\r\nthat time. Tea, soap, and tobacco are contraband, but the Custom House\r\nis not inexorable. A common English wardrobe, with the addition of a few\r\nlighter articles, and a waterproof covering for the mountains, suffice\r\nfor clothing.—_Harcourt._\r\n\r\n[37] Two distinct species of finch (_Carduelis_) appear to have afforded\r\nthe different varieties of singing bird, familiarly known by this name.\r\nThe one which is best known in its wild state is the _Carduelis canaria_\r\nof Cuvier, and is very abundant in Madeira, where its characters and\r\nhabits have been observed with much attention by Dr. Heineken. ‘It\r\nbuilds,’ says this naturalist, ‘in thick, bushy, high shrubs and trees,\r\nwith roots, moss, feathers, hair, &c.; pairs in February; lays from four\r\nto six pale blue eggs; and hatches five, and often six times in the\r\nseason. It is a delightful songster, with, beyond doubt, much of the\r\nnightingale’s and sky-lark’s, but none of the wood-lark’s, song.’—‘A\r\npure wild song from an island canary, at liberty, in full throat, in a\r\npart of the country so distant from the haunts of men that it is quite\r\nunsophisticated, is unequalled, in its kind, by any thing I have ever\r\nheard in the way of bird-music’ The canary-bird was brought into Europe\r\nas early as the 16th century, and is supposed to have spread from the\r\ncoast of Italy, where a vessel, which was bringing to Leghorn a number of\r\nthese birds, besides its merchandise, was wrecked. As, however, they were\r\nmales chiefly which were thus introduced, they were for some time scarce;\r\nand it is only of late years that their education and the proper mode of\r\ntreating them have been known.—_Brande_, 1853.\r\n\r\n[38] Brazil, as before stated, was originally so named from its valuable\r\ndye-wood, called Braziletto or ‘Cisaljuna Braziletto,’ or Pernambuco,\r\nWood of Saint Martha, or Sipan, according to the place which produces\r\nit, and by Linnæus, _Cæsalpinia custa_, which was for many years the\r\nrichest dye in Europe, and from which the famous Turkey red colours were\r\nproduced, rivalling the ancient Tyrian purple, and, like it, passing into\r\noblivion, after vast popularity; for other drugs having been substituted,\r\nBrazil wood became comparatively little used. It was a close monopoly\r\nof the government, who derived a large revenue from its sale, from £100\r\na ton upwards being the current price in London, and only 8 years ago\r\n4,500 tons were imported into Great Britain. Brazil timber also possesses\r\nqualities not generally known, one of which is mentioned by Sir W. G.\r\nOuseley, and accounts for the infrequency of conflagrations in some\r\nof the cities of South America, as compared with what happens in the\r\nnorthern portion of the continent, where fire brigades are among the\r\nmost prominent institutions of the country, and yet do not by any means\r\nprevent the mischief they are meant to guard against. He says:—‘A proof\r\nof the incombustible nature of Brazil wood was afforded at this house\r\n(the Mangueiras) previous to my arrival at Rio de Janeiro, when it was\r\noccupied by Baron Palencia, at that time Russian Minister to the Imperial\r\nCourt. One night an attempt was made to set fire to the outside door-like\r\nshutters of one of the windows, with a view, doubtless, to getting into\r\nand robbing the apartments. In the morning was discovered a heap of\r\nstill smoking, combustible materials, partially consumed, applied to the\r\noutside of the shutter, the planks of which were little injured, although\r\ntheir surface was charred, as the fire had been in actual contact with\r\nthe wood probably for some hours.’ Brazil wood (the dye now so called) is\r\nvery small sized—sticks, comparatively speaking,—and is not used at all\r\nfor building purposes, being much too valuable. The ordinary timber of\r\nthe country is of quite another description.\r\n\r\n[39] Of the simultaneousness of these discoveries, Humboldt says:—‘The\r\ncourse of great events, like the results of natural phenomena, is ruled\r\nby eternal laws, with few of which we have any perfect knowledge.\r\nThe fleet which Emanuel, King of Portugal, sent to India, under the\r\ncommand of Pedro Alvarez Cabral, on the course discovered by Gama, was\r\nunexpectedly driven on the coast of Brazil on the 22nd April, 1500. From\r\nthe zeal which the Portuguese had manifested since the expedition of\r\nDiaz in 1487, to circumnavigate the Cape of Good Hope, a recurrence of\r\nfortuitous circumstances, similar to those exercised by oceanic currents\r\non Cabral’s ships, could hardly fail to manifest itself. The African\r\ndiscoveries would thus probably have brought about that of America south\r\nof the Equator; and thus Robertson was justified in saying that it was\r\ndecreed in the destinies of mankind that the new continents should be\r\nmade known to European navigators before the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.’\r\n\r\n[40] It is after this beautiful quarter of the city of Pernambuco that\r\nthe second vessel of the ocean line of the South American and General\r\nSteam Navigation Company was called. Olinda is situated on several hills,\r\nclothed with the most luxuriant tropical vegetation, from the midst\r\nof which the convents, churches, snow-white cathedral, and numerous\r\nprivate residences, mostly of the same colour, are seen to great effect,\r\nthough, on a near approach, in a sadly decayed state. Olinda, however,\r\nmay be regarded in something of the light of an East End to St. Antonio,\r\nthe West End, or official quarter, where are situate the principal\r\ngovernmental departments and offices; while Recife is the actual place\r\nof business, and where all the foreign merchants are located. The value\r\nof the exports from Pernambuco annually exceeds a million and a half\r\nsterling; and that of the imports from England is about £800,000.\r\n\r\n[41] Few spots in the New World are more indebted to nature than the\r\nenvirons, all possible combinations of scenery being included in one\r\nmagnificent perspective. One of the best views is from the Corcovado\r\nMountain, which although upwards of 3,000 feet in height, can be ascended\r\non horseback. Like most mountains around, it is rather a rock, or titanic\r\nmonolith, than a mountain, and it may be compared with the gnomon of a\r\ngigantic sun-dial; and, in fact, its shadow in particular localities\r\nsupplies the place of a parish clock. Its sides are still in great part\r\ncovered with forest and ‘matta,’ or jungle, notwithstanding numerous\r\nfires by which it has been devastated, the immediate result of the last\r\nbeing a deficiency in the supply of water to parts of the capital, for\r\nthe destruction of trees here, as elsewhere, causes a scarcity of the\r\naqueous element, and the springs which rise on and around this mountain\r\nfeed the conduits and aqueducts that convey that fluid into Rio. From the\r\nsummit may be seen the whole extent of the harbour and city; the Organ\r\nMountains in the distance, several lakes along the coast, a wide expanse\r\nof ocean, and innumerable ravines and spurs of the mountain clothed with\r\nrichest foliage. The most remarkable, however, of all the mountains near\r\nthe capital, is the Gavia, with a flattened summit, sometimes called by\r\nthe English the Table Mountain, in Portuguese, the ‘square topsail,’ to\r\nwhich it bears a resemblance. It is reputed to be inaccessible, at least\r\nit has not yet, as far as can be ascertained, been ascended. Opening into\r\nthe outer harbour is Botafogo Bay, a short distance from the capital,\r\nwhere many foreign merchants reside to enjoy the cool sea breezes,\r\nand where the buildings are of a superior description, with beautiful\r\ngardens attached, many being luxuriantly planted with oranges and lemons,\r\nbananas, pomegranates, palm trees, and a vast variety of shrubs and\r\nvegetables peculiar to Brazil, including the universal cabbage plant in\r\ngreat profusion. The aqueduct, which is passed in several places in the\r\nascent of the Corcovado, is a well-built and striking object, crossing\r\nseveral streets of Rio, and conveying excellent water from the heights of\r\nthat mountain to the different fountains in the town.\r\n\r\n[42] The only publication relative to Brazil that has appeared since I\r\nleft England, or at least that I have seen since my return, is one which,\r\nthough it touches but lightly on the country, as might be expected in ‘A\r\nSketcher’s Tour Round the World,’ [by Mr. Robert Elwes], contains some of\r\nthe best word-painting of Brazilian city life anywhere to be met with.\r\nThe following description, for instance, will be readily recognized as\r\nmost just by all who have been long in the capital; and the concluding\r\npassage in particular, I fear, is but too applicable:—\r\n\r\n‘The town of Rio Janeiro (its proper name is St. Sebastiano) is the\r\nlargest and best in South America, and the population about equals that\r\nof Liverpool. It is laid out in regular squares: the streets are narrow,\r\nwhich, at first sight, seems objectionable to an Englishman, but he\r\nsoon finds that it affords protection from the scorching sun; and the\r\nthoroughfares are tolerably well-paved and lighted, and have _trottoirs_\r\nat the sides. To obviate the inconvenience arising from the narrowness\r\nof the streets, carriages are only allowed to go one way, up one street\r\nand down the next, and a hand is painted up on the corners to show which\r\nway the traffic is to flow. The best street, Rua d’Ouvidor, is nearly\r\nall French, so that one can almost fancy oneself in the Palais Royal;\r\nand nearly everything that is to be found in London or Paris may be\r\nbought in Rio. Many English merchants have houses in the city, but most\r\nof the shopkeepers are French; and this proves a perfect blessing to\r\nvisitors, for a Brazilian shopman is so careless and indolent, that he\r\nwill hardly look for anything in his stores, and will often say he has\r\nnot got the article asked for, to save himself the trouble of looking for\r\nit. The best native shops are those of the silversmiths, who work pretty\r\nwell, and get a good deal of custom, for Brazilians and blacks revel in\r\nornament, often wearing silver spurs and a silver-hafted knife though\r\nperhaps they may not have any shoes to their feet. The Brazilians are\r\nvery fond of dress; and though it seems so unsuitable for the climate,\r\nwear black trowsers and an evening suit to walk about the streets in.\r\nStrangers will find no curiosities in Rio Janeiro except the feather\r\nflowers, which are better here than in Madeira, and fetch a higher price.\r\nA Frenchwoman, who employs a number of girls of all complexions in her\r\nbusiness, is the principal manufacturer. They are made (or ought to be)\r\nentirely of undyed feathers, the best being those of a purple, copper,\r\nor crimson colour, from the breasts and heads of humming-birds. One of\r\nthese wreaths has a beautiful effect, and reflects different-coloured\r\nlight. The wing cases of beetles are also used, and glitter like precious\r\nstones. Madame has her patterns from Paris, so the wreaths are generally\r\nin good style and newest fashion. The worst shops are kept by English,\r\nand this will be found a general rule in these foreign towns. The\r\nmerchants are good and honest; but if one wishes to be well taken in, go\r\nto a shop kept by an Englishman.’\r\n\r\n[43] The Bank, Exchange, Custom House, and Arsenal, (of late years\r\ngreatly extended,) are in the Rua Direita. Besides these, the chief\r\npublic edifices are, the Imperial Palace, a plain brick building; the\r\nOld Palace, on the shore, used for public offices; a Public Hospital,\r\nalluded to elsewhere, erected in 1841; a National Library, with 800,000\r\nprinted volumes, and many valuable MSS.; and a well supported Opera\r\nHouse, which has supplied Europe with some very popular performers,\r\nespecially in the ballet line, as witness that general favourite, Madame\r\nCeleste, who came from Rio, in 1830, with her sister Constance, another\r\ndanseuse, and appeared for the first time in England at Liverpool, in\r\nthe divertissement in Masaniello, Sinclair being Auber’s hero. The\r\neducational establishments are, the Imperial College of Don Pedro II.;\r\nthe College of St. José; Schools of Medicine and Surgery; Military and\r\nNaval Academy; and many Public Schools. It has also many Scientific\r\nInstitutions; a Museum rich in Ornithology, Entomology, and Mineralogy;\r\nand a fine Botanic Garden. Of Churches there are upwards of fifty, not of\r\nmuch external elegance, but mostly sumptuously decorated in the interior.\r\n\r\n[44] The inhabitants of Rio Janeiro are fond of carriages, but the\r\nspecimens generally seen would hardly do for Hyde Park, being chiefly\r\nold-fashioned coaches, drawn by four scraggy mules, with a black coachman\r\non the box, and a postillion in jack-boots on the leaders, sitting\r\nwell back, and with his feet stuck out beyond the mule’s shoulders.\r\nThe liveries are generally gorgeous enough, and there is no lack of\r\ngold lace on the cocked hats and coats; but a black slave does not\r\nenter into the spirit of the thing, and one footman will have his hat\r\ncocked athwartships, the other fore and aft; one will have shoes and\r\nstockings, with his toes peeping through, the other will dispense with\r\nthem altogether. But the old peer rolls on unconscious, and I dare say\r\nthe whole thing is pronounced a neat turn-out. The Brazilians are great\r\nsnuff-takers, and always offer their box, if the visitor is a welcome\r\nguest. It is etiquette to take the offered pinch with the left hand.\r\nRapé is the Portuguese for snuff, hence our word rappee. They do not\r\nsmoke much. The opera was good, the house very large, tolerably lighted,\r\nbut not so thickly attended as it might be. The ladies look better by\r\ncandle-light, their great failing being in their complexions, the tint\r\nof which may be exactly described by the midshipman’s simile of snuff\r\nand butter. The orchestra was good, many of the performers being blacks\r\nor mulattos, who are excellent musicians. The African race seem to like\r\nmusic, and generally have a pretty good ear. Both men and women often\r\nwhistle well, and I have heard the washerwomen at their work whistling\r\npolkas with great correctness. I was amused one evening on going out of\r\nthe opera when it was half over: offering my ticket to a decent-looking\r\nman standing near the door, he bowed, but refused it, saying that men\r\nwith jackets were not allowed in the house.—_Elwes._\r\n\r\n[45] The population of Rio, on the arrival of the royal family, did not\r\namount to 50,000, but afterwards rapidly augmented; so that in 1815,\r\nwhen declared independent, the number had nearly doubled, and now is\r\nestimated at about 400,000, with the suburbs and the provincial capital\r\nof Nitherohy, on the opposite shore of the Bay. This increase is partly\r\nto be ascribed to the afflux of Portuguese, who have at different times\r\nleft their country in consequence of the civil commotions which have\r\ndisturbed its peace, as well as of English, French, Dutch, Germans,\r\nand Italians, who, after the opening of the port, settled here, some\r\nas merchants, others as mechanics, and have contributed largely to its\r\nwealth and importance. These accessions of Europeans have effected a\r\ngreat change in the character of the population, for at the commencement\r\nof the century, and for many years afterwards, the blacks and coloured\r\npersons far exceeded the whites, whereas now they are reduced to less\r\nthan half the number of inhabitants. In the aggregate population of the\r\nempire, however, the coloured portion is still supposed to be treble the\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n[46] Senhor Pereira de Andrade, the Brazilian gentleman referred to in\r\nthe next note, in the course of his examination before the committee\r\non the 19th of July, 1853, is asked by Sir George Pechell:—‘You stated\r\nwhat must have given very great pleasure to this committee, that you\r\nconsidered Brazil had done its duty with regard to the fulfilment of\r\nits treaties, and also that the feeling of the country was generally\r\nin favour of employing free labour?’—Andrade answered, there can be no\r\ndoubt of it. Question.—Do you think that a candidate for election to the\r\nParliament of Brazil would have any chance of being elected if he were\r\nin favour of the importation of slaves? Answer.—Certainly not; not a man\r\nin Brazil now would dare utter a single word in Parliament in favour of\r\nthe slave trade. Question.—In short the popular cry would be all against\r\nit? Answer.—Yes. All his answers are to the same effect; and upon these\r\nanswers, as well as those of the other witnesses, the committee made the\r\nreport adverted to in the adjoining page.\r\n\r\n[47] Those who would fully understand the bearings of this\r\nmost interesting subject, concerning which an infinite deal of\r\nmisunderstanding was, I may almost say designedly, propagated in England,\r\nso perverse was the determination, in certain quarters, to disbelieve\r\neverything that redounded to the credit, and to swallow implicitly all\r\nthat was supposed to tell to the discredit, of Brazil, will find it\r\nfully set forth in the evidence given before the committee on Slave\r\nTrade Treaties, which sat in the course of last session, under the\r\nchairmanship of Mr. Hume. On that committee were several gentlemen who\r\nhad been most strenuous in their resistance to all remonstrance on the\r\npart of Brazil, against the too often wanton, and almost always violent\r\nand irritating, conduct of our cruisers; gentlemen who were incessant in\r\ntheir appeals for vigorous measures on the part of our squadron on the\r\ncoast, and of our ambassadors at the court, of Brazil; yet the committee\r\nso composed reported as follows:—The importation of slaves into Brazil,\r\nin ’47, was 56,172: in ’48, 60,000; in ’49, 54,000; but in ’51, it had\r\ndiminished to 3,287, and in ’52, to 700, of which last importation a\r\nconsiderable portion had been seized by the Brazilian Government. Mr.\r\nConsul Porter reported to Viscount Palmerston in ’48, that 74 slave-trade\r\nvessels had sailed from Bahia in the year ’47, and 93 in ’48;—that the\r\nslave traffic was carried on with great activity; and, as an example, he\r\nstated that one vessel, the ‘Andorinha,’ of 80 tons burden, which cost\r\n£2,000 sterling, had made eight successful voyages with slaves from the\r\nWest Coast of Africa, having actually landed at Bahia 3,392 slaves, and\r\nreceived for freight 120 milreis per head, or £40,704 sterling, giving\r\na profit of 800 per cent.; also that towards the end of ’50, and in\r\n’51, stringent orders had arrived at Bahia for the suppression of the\r\ntrade, and that when he left Bahia in the end of ’51, ‘the slave trade\r\nwas perfectly suspended.’ He thinks that the British ships alone cannot\r\nstop the trade, but that if the Brazilian Government be sincere, it will\r\ncertainly be put down. Your committee invite the attention of the House\r\nto the evidence of Senhor D’Andrade and others, and to the reports of the\r\nBrazilian Ministers, for an explanation of the manner in which so great a\r\nchange has been effected in the Brazils. The speech of the Emperor to the\r\nassembly of this year, on the subject of the slave trade; the stringent\r\nlaws that have been passed, and others that are in progress, by the\r\nBrazilian Government against the slave trade; and, above all, the seizure\r\nand banishment of some Portuguese merchants, who, were suspected of an\r\nintention to renew the trade, convince your committee that the Brazilian\r\nGovernment is sincere, and that the slave trade is actually abolished in\r\nthe Brazils. Your committee refer to the correspondence of the Earl of\r\nAberdeen with the Brazilian Government, in 1845, to explain the state of\r\nthe slave question at that time, and the reasons that induced Parliament\r\nto pass the 8 and 9 Vict. c. 122. The favourable change which has taken\r\nplace in the councils and conduct of the Brazilian Government respecting\r\nslavery, whether accelerated by the active services of Captain Schomberg\r\nor not, may induce Parliament to repeal that Act, as intimated in his\r\nLordship’s letter of the 2d July 1845.—It is to be hoped that this\r\nrecommendation of the committee will be carried out in the course of the\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\n[48] We have said that of all public securities those of Brazil rank the\r\nhighest, next to those of Great Britain itself. It may not be amiss to\r\ngive the following ‘monetary’ evidence of the same fact from a well-known\r\ndispassionate Stock Exchange authority, the last edition of _Fortune’s\r\nEpitome of the Funds_, under the head of Brazilian Five per Cents, 1843.\r\nCapital £732,000. This was a transference of a portion of the claim of\r\nPortugal to Brazil, ‘that land of wonders, whose rivers roll over beds\r\nof gold, where the rocks glow with topazes, and the sands sparkle with\r\ndiamonds, where nature assumes her richest dress beneath the blaze of\r\ntropical suns, and birds of the gaudiest plumage vie with the splendid\r\nefflorescence of the forests they inhabit; this gorgeous picture, drawn\r\nin dazzling, but not false colours, leaves unnoticed the greatest riches\r\nof Brazil, which consist in her almost unlimited power of producing the\r\nstaple commodities of life and commerce. Possessed of the finest climate,\r\nand of a virgin soil of the richest fertility, cotton, coffee, sugar, in\r\nfact every production of the tropics, as well as of the temperate zone,\r\nmay be cultivated to any extent, and at small expense. Numerous sea\r\nports, with safe harbours, and noble rivers, which, at a comparatively\r\nsmall cost, might be rendered navigable, afford the means of turning\r\nthese natural facilities to the best advantage; and, judging from the\r\nrapid increase of the commerce of late years, the Brazilians are not\r\naltogether negligent in availing themselves of these sources of boundless\r\nand lasting wealth. The progress of Brazil has been remarkable during the\r\nlast ten years, the revenue having been nearly doubled. The punctuality\r\nof the payment of the dividends, the disposition evinced to preserve\r\nthe credit of the country, and the presumption that it will be well\r\nmaintained, gives Brazilian stock a good position in the market, as an\r\ninvestment; and prices have not latterly experienced much fluctuation.\r\n\r\n[49] The following letter, illustrative of some of the scenes on that\r\noccasion, appeared in the ‘Journal do Commercio’:—‘I was expecting\r\nmy family in this capital, from Rio Grande do Sul, by the steamer\r\nPernambucana, when the melancholy and lamentable shipwreck of this\r\nvessel took place; and I must confess my eternal obligation and sincere\r\ngratitude for the heroic and brilliant action performed by the very\r\ndistinguished, valiant, and intrepid mariner, Simon, belonging to the\r\ncrew of the steamer, who was the only one of them that came forward and\r\ncontributed, in a manner without example, to the salvation, besides many\r\nunhappy individuals who were looking on death as certain, of persons\r\nso dear to me as my wife, eight children, and three slaves, who were\r\nmore than 24 hours on board the steamer after she had struck, without\r\nany other resource than Divine Providence, who sent them a protector,\r\nthe black Simon; so that my loss consisted only of a little daughter, a\r\nfemale slave, and all the baggage.—Rio de Janeiro, 5th Nov., 1853.—LOUIS\r\nVIEIRA DA COSTA.’\r\n\r\nAs a frightful contrast to the conduct of the brave Simon, it appears\r\nthat even on board the steamer the other sailors broke open the trunks\r\nof the passengers, with knife in hand, to get possession of the money\r\nthey contained; and afterwards committed the most shocking atrocities on\r\nshore, such as cutting the fingers off the bodies that had been washed on\r\nland for the sake of the rings.\r\n\r\n[50] RESUME OF THE PORT REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE BRITISH VICE-CONSUL\r\nAT BELEM CASTLE, LISBON.—‘[If not asked for, retain these papers until\r\nthe consignee is on board.] Deliver to the Custom-house Officer who\r\nconducts your vessel to the anchorage ground, off the Lisbon Custom house\r\n(quadrangle), your manifest list of stores and every single article on\r\nboard; whatever you omit to declare will be seized, and liable you to\r\nimprisonment, and seizure of the vessel. You must declare in writing:\r\nif your cargo, or any part is destined to any other Port. The cause you\r\nput in for, orders, wind bound, or from other casualties. If any part of\r\ncargo has been thrown overboard; or picked up any articles at sea. If\r\nfish laden, or cargo on speculation, or even in ballast, by declaring you\r\nask franquia for cargo, or vessel, you will avoid part of port charges,\r\non proceeding to sea. Be particular to give correct account of all\r\npackages, parcels, and other articles not manifested; list of passengers,\r\nwith correct note of luggage; list of crew, with a note of their tobacco,\r\nsoap, and slops; list of provisions, stores, live stock, slops, nautical\r\ninstruments, new clothes, &c.; separate list of all tobacco, segars,\r\nand soap, every particular, with crew and passengers to produce all\r\nthey have; if any is found concealed, you are liable to transportation\r\nand seizure of vessel. Deliver up all letters, except letter for the\r\nconsignee of vessel; if any are found on board you will pay nine times\r\nthe amount of postage; deliver up all your gunpowder. Allow no ballast,\r\ndunnage, sweepings, or any kind of rubbish to be thrown overboard, as\r\nyou will pay a penalty of 5 shillings for every ton register. To have\r\nbuoys, and buoy ropes on anchors. To house jibboom, and flying jibboom.\r\nOnly to have long boat astern, and the painters not to have more scope\r\nthan six fathoms. To have spare bower anchor at bows, always ready to\r\nlet go in case of necessity. Not to have top-gallant-masts an end during\r\nbad weather. Take care the vessel is never slack moored. Always to keep\r\nwatch, and assist other vessels in best way possible, in order to avoid\r\ndamage. As soon as you anchor in anchorage ground (quadrangle), land at\r\nthe custom house quay; be sure on sending your boat off, or on leaving\r\nthe vessel, that you give orders to your boat to go alongside of the\r\nnearest gun boat; if you omit, the boat will be seized. You cannot go on\r\nboard of any vessel at anchor in the quadrangle, nor can you leave your\r\nvessel, or return on board after sunset without an order, as your boat\r\nwill be seized. On leaving your vessel you are liable to be searched. I\r\ndraw your particular attention to these regulations of the port, as the\r\nauthorities are very severe, allow nothing to pass, and take advantage of\r\nthe least omission; a strict search is made over the vessel’s rigging and\r\nsails.—Belem. J. Philipps.’\r\n\r\n[51] Whilst making this general observation, only in a spirit and with a\r\ndesire that the Brazilians may see their true interests, in applying a\r\nremedy to these absurdities, and follow out the principles of free-trade\r\nin their regulation of commercial matters, I must not omit to acknowledge\r\nthe exemptions made in favour of the steam company which I represented.\r\nIn all the ports of the empire we were not only freed from ordinary\r\nrestrictions and delays that could possibly be dispensed with, but\r\neverywhere met with the most kind and cordial reception; indeed, I may\r\nsay, we were welcomed with open arms.\r\n\r\n[52] Since my return these anticipations have been to a considerable\r\nextent realized; for previous to the close of the last session the\r\nchambers passed a law, conferring power on the imperial government to\r\nalter a great variety of duties in the Brazilian tariff, effecting a\r\nreduction on the principal articles of import from England of from 25\r\nto 30 per cent. Though the extremely flourishing state of the imperial\r\nrevenue has admitted of this improvement without any serious sacrifice,\r\neven for the moment, it must also be attributed in a great degree to the\r\nprogress of a knowledge of sound commercial policy, not only among the\r\ndiscerning men to whom the administration is committed, but among the\r\nrepresentatives by whose support alone they are able to carry out such\r\njudicious views. It will be seen, also, that other portions of the South\r\nAmerican continent, both on the West and the East coast, have acted in a\r\nlike spirit; and now that the vast internal streams are opening to the\r\ntide of European commerce and civilization, there begins to loom in the\r\nnot distant future the certainty of those magnificent conceptions of Mr.\r\nCanning being realized, when he spoke of calling into political being\r\nthese states of the new world to redress the balance of the old.\r\n\r\n[53] That the Brazilian capital should be deemed a pleasant place for the\r\nresidence of many Europeans will be inferred from what Mr. Elwes says of\r\nthe profusion find varieties of its supplies of food:—\r\n\r\n    The market of Rio is a fine large building, to the north of the\r\n    principal square. It is well supplied with fish; but the price\r\n    is always very high, as the fishermen have a sort of monopoly,\r\n    and will only bring a certain quantity to market, in order\r\n    to keep it up. The best fish is the garoupa; immense prawns\r\n    (camaroes) are very plentiful. Strangers are often told, as a\r\n    joke, that these are kept in pits, and fed with the dead bodies\r\n    of slaves thrown in from time to time; and I have known people\r\n    who would never touch them on that account. Parrots, monkeys,\r\n    &c., are very common, and a few game birds. Occasionally,\r\n    large lizards of two or three feet in length are brought to\r\n    market, and they are said to be excellent eating. Deer are\r\n    sometimes killed in the woods; but I have never seen them in\r\n    the market, though there is a small animal, called the paca,\r\n    to be had, the flesh of which is very good. Fruit is supplied\r\n    in great abundance. Oranges and bananas are to be had all\r\n    the year. The oranges were superior to anything I had before\r\n    tasted, and excel the Maltese. They are said to be better in\r\n    Bahia, and better still in Pernambuco; so it appears that the\r\n    hotter the climate, the more suitable it is to this fruit, as\r\n    the Maltese and the Egyptian are certainly far superior to\r\n    those of Portugal and Sicily. The banana (_Musa paradisaica_,\r\n    called ‘plantano’ by the Spaniards, and ‘plantain’ in the West\r\n    Indies,) is a most nutritious fruit; but few people like it at\r\n    first, as the taste is rather sickly and insipid. There are\r\n    a variety of sorts, which bear fruit of different sizes, but\r\n    the short thick one is the best. It is very nutritious and\r\n    productive; and it is said that forty square feet, planted\r\n    with bananas, will support a man for a year. The plant itself\r\n    is very handsome, and the great leaves, ten or twelve feet\r\n    in length, and two in breadth, make a splendid feature in\r\n    the landscape of the tropics. Each plant bears one bunch of\r\n    fruit, after which it should be cut down, when suckers spring\r\n    up in all directions from the root, so that it is a vegetable\r\n    more suited for idle people than even the potato, as it does\r\n    not require planting, and the fruit can be eaten without the\r\n    trouble of cooking it. The fruta do Conde, or chirimoya of the\r\n    Spaniard, and custard-apple of the West Indies, is delicious,\r\n    but varies a good deal in quality. The maricuja, Spanish\r\n    granadilla, the fruit of the passion-flower, is very good.\r\n    It is about as large as a swan’s egg, with a pulp and seeds\r\n    like a gooseberry. The alligator or avocada pear, the mammon,\r\n    papaw, or mammy apple, are common fruits, not so good as those\r\n    before-named. Pine-apples are common enough, but not very good.\r\n\r\n[54] The Brazil government have adopted measures to introduce immigrants\r\nto supply the place of slaves, they have established some large colonies\r\nfrom Germany, France, and Portugal, principally by private speculation\r\nand by the government; and those colonies of private individuals are\r\nthe surest guarantee for the abolition of the slave trade, because\r\nthose parties are now interested by the larger profit they derive from\r\nfree labour, in keeping this system instead of the other, especially in\r\ncoffee. They are greatly prized for their steady industry, peaceable\r\ndisposition, and easy adaptation of themselves to the manners and\r\nusages of the people among whom they come to reside. As is the case in\r\nAustralia, and in most parts of North America, they are very general\r\nfavourites with the inhabitants of all classes, and, on the whole,\r\nare preferred probably to any other Europeans. The number of German\r\nimmigrants now in Brazil may be considered as amounting to somewhere\r\nabout 15,000; and to these considerable additions are still being made\r\nfrom the large importations which are now daily taking place from the Old\r\nWorld. They bear coffee labour pretty well, but most of them are employed\r\nin the province of Rio Janeiro and Rio Grande; the government is very\r\nsolicitous to treat them as well as possible, and it has established\r\nthose colonies in the provinces which are best for it, more like the\r\nclimate of Europe; the provinces of Rio Grande and St. Catherine are the\r\ncoldest provinces in the country. They imported, besides those Germans,\r\na great many Portuguese, a different set of people altogether. They are\r\nfrom Madeira, and from all parts of Portugal, and from their islands;\r\nthey generally arrive in greater numbers than the Germans. Very few\r\nChinese have been tried. The white natives of Brazil do not work much\r\nupon the sugar and coffee plantations; they only serve like what we\r\ncall headmen, superintendents; not in any other way. The Germans are\r\ncontracted with and brought to Brazil; the Portuguese come on their own\r\naccount; they do not contract them in Portugal; they come of themselves\r\nby hundreds; they generally get employment about the towns, about the gin\r\nshops, and gin taverns, and small businesses. For particulars of this\r\nkind, see the Report on Slave Trade Treaties. It is calculated that the\r\nsugar crop this year, 1854, will be about 30,000 tons less than the last.\r\n\r\n[55] Yesterday an experiment was tried with a locomotive steam-engine\r\non the rails of a finished portion of the road from Mauá to the\r\nEstrella mountain. Our ‘Weekly Correspondent’ sent us last night the\r\nfollowing communication respecting this trip:—Whilst the political\r\nworld was agitated this morning, and the sword of Damocles, ceasing its\r\noscillations for a moment, fell on the ministry, myself, and some other\r\ncuriosity seekers, amongst whom were noticed the ministers of England\r\nand of Austria, risked ourselves in a trial of the first steam-carriage\r\nthat travelled over the first railway in Brazil. We crossed the bay in a\r\nvessel, also moved by Fulton’s agency, and in two hours (the steamer was\r\nof small power) we arrived at Mauá. The first part only of the pier for\r\ndisembarking being laid, we climbed up by the aid of ropes, and threaded\r\nour way amongst a succession of loose and insecure planks to the shore,\r\nat the risk of taking a mud-bath. A few paces distant we saw a single,\r\ngraceful-looking locomotive, with the certificate of the year of its\r\nbirth and the name of its worthy papa engraved on the central wheels. The\r\nletters, in yellow metal, were as follows: ‘Wm. Fairbairn & Son, 1853.\r\nManchester.’ The proper carriage was not yet attached; they substituted\r\nfor it a rough waggon, used for the conveyance of materials, and without\r\nfurther delay we squatted ourselves at the bottom of this impromptu\r\nvehicle. Suddenly a prolonged and roaring shriek, a whistle with the\r\nforce of 50 sopranos, screamed through the air, deafening the hearers,\r\nand causing us to raise our hands to our ears. It was the signal for\r\ndeparture; the warning to those who might be on the line to guard against\r\na mortal blow; an announcement made by a tube attached to the locomotive\r\nitself. Swifter than an arrow, than the flight of a swallow, the\r\nlocomotive threaded the rails, swung about, ran, flew, devoured space,\r\nand, passing through fields, barren wastes, and affrighted animals, it\r\nstopped at last breathless, at the point where the road does not yet\r\nafford a safe passage. The space traversed was a mile and three quarters,\r\nand the time occupied in the transit four minutes. It is just that we\r\nshould here record the names of Messrs. Trever and Bragg; the first,\r\nfor having had the boldness to undertake the enterprise, the other, for\r\nexecuting, with zeal and skill, the respective works. Mr. Hadfield,\r\nwho also went on this excursion, appeared greatly delighted. One of\r\nhis dreams for many years past has been the application of railroads\r\nand steam in this empire. Being amongst us as the representative of a\r\ncompany which undertook the line of steamers from Liverpool, towards the\r\nestablishment of which he greatly contributed, he could see his dreams\r\nrealized, as our Latin masters would say, terrâ marique. Whether it was\r\nGeorge Stephenson or Trevithick, as the English assert, the Brothers\r\nSequin, according to the French, or Oliver Evans, as the Americans\r\npretend,—whoever was the inventor of locomotives, what is certain is,\r\nthat humanity has taken a gigantic stride since that acquisition. The\r\nPeace Congress ought to commemorate in annual session so prodigious an\r\ninvention, which can, more than half-a-dozen pompous discourses, cement\r\nthe bonds of union of nations, bring nations together into one family,\r\nand develop commerce, that most powerful element of peace and greatness.\r\nWhat a brilliant future for Brazil do we see in the wheels of that\r\nlocomotive! Happy those amongst us who may have long lives—they will pass\r\nby great cities, by great rural establishments, recollecting that on\r\ntheir sites were swamps and forests. Oh! if the existence of man was not\r\nso short; if, at least, we could return to this world invisible shadows,\r\nwandering in our native country, how small we should find ourselves,\r\ncomparing our past, that is, our present of to-day, with the progress\r\nmade by the generation then before us. But human beings are like the\r\nworkmen who assist each other in raising an edifice: each age deposits\r\nits stone towards the completion of the great work. Our first stone has\r\nbeen laid on the plain of Mauá. The edifice is already commenced; let us\r\nnot be discouraged; and if death should overtake us in the midst of the\r\nwork, here are our generations to continue it. Peace, in the meantime,\r\nand eternal rest to the poor Mauar race. The invisible power has come\r\nto replace their services, with the first-fruits and benefits of which\r\na bright morning succeeds to a dark and ugly night. May the material\r\nimprovements of the country come, and with them peace and industry; and,\r\nto commence the sooner the better, let us have the roads of Minas and San\r\nPaulo.\r\n\r\n[56] Exports of staple productions of Rio Janeiro, the result of slave\r\nlabour, during 1851: coffee, 2,037,305 bags, value, 4,756,794_l._;\r\nsugar, 12,832 cases, value, 234,980_l._; rosewood, 36,813 planks,\r\nvalue, 82,000_l._ In addition to these, other articles of produce, such\r\nas hides, horns, rice, tobacco, tapioca, rum, &c., were exported, the\r\nvalue of which may be estimated at 264,000_l._, making the total value\r\nof produce shipped in that year 5,337,074_l._ Exports of the staple\r\nproductions of Rio Janeiro, the result of slave labour, during 1852:\r\ncoffee, 1,906,336 bags, value, 4,265,800_l._; sugar, 13,960 cases, value,\r\n160,000_l._; rosewood, 25,500 planks, value, 55,000_l._ The value of the\r\nother articles cannot be correctly ascertained, but may be estimated at\r\nabout 290,000_l._, making the total value of produce exported in that\r\nyear 4,770,800_l._ Rio Janeiro, February 24th, 1853. J. J. C. WESTWOOD,\r\nActing Consul.\r\n\r\n[57] Steamers running from Brazil to the United States, starting, say,\r\nfrom Rio, touching at Bahia, Pernambuco, Maranham, Pará, and one or more\r\nof the most important of the West India Islands, would prove a lucrative\r\nundertaking. The importance of this line of steamers to those interested\r\nin the trade between the two countries must impress itself upon all who\r\nare conversant with the trade carried on; but although a considerable\r\namount of freight may be relied on, the passenger traffic will probably\r\nbe far more important. Besides the Americans and others interested in\r\nthis trade, many English and Brazilians intending to travel from South\r\nAmerica to Europe, and vice versa, would go _viâ_ the United States,\r\nsome for business purposes, and many to visit that country. Another\r\nvery important object would also be attained, viz. the completion of\r\nthe communication between all the large maritime towns of Brazil and\r\nthe capital of the Empire, by efficient steam-ships. At present the\r\ncommunication, from Pernambuco to Pará, is carried on by small steamers\r\nbelonging to a native company, which is subsidised by the government,\r\nand the reason given for the continuation of the subsidy was, that,\r\nalthough English steam companies now put some of the northern ports in\r\nrapid communication with the capital, those beyond Pernambuco still\r\nrelied solely on these small steamers. Although the trade between the\r\nWest Indies and Brazil is unimportant, these countries are at present\r\nso thoroughly devoid of means of intercommunication that advantages\r\ncould not fail to be derived by the establishment of this line. At\r\npresent, a person wishing to leave a Brazilian port for the West Indies\r\nwill generally find that he must go _viâ_ England or the United States,\r\nand this even from the most northern ports. The importance of such an\r\nundertaking to Brazil would be immense, and I have no doubt that the\r\nBrazilian government would be fully alive to the advantages they would\r\nderive from it, and that they would be ready to grant a liberal amount\r\nfor mails, &c.—_Contributed._\r\n\r\n[58] A Monte Videan writer in the City article of the _Times_ on the\r\n17th of last month, has the following remarks, at once explanatory of\r\nthe condition of the government of the Banda Oriental, and of Brazilian\r\nrelations to it, and of the feelings prevailing in the Uruguay as to the\r\ntendency it is desired that such relationship should assume:—\r\n\r\n    By a decree of the Provisional Government, Berro, the\r\n    ex-Minister of Giro, having been detected in fomenting the\r\n    civil war, has been outlawed. Any person is authorized to\r\n    kill him. This decree does not meet with the approbation of\r\n    the people, but in these countries public opinion has little\r\n    influence with governments. Brazil, it is said, has been\r\n    offered the protectorate of this republic, and refused it;\r\n    but she will use force, if necessary, to exact the fulfilment\r\n    of treaties; and it is generally believed here that the Banda\r\n    Oriental will soon be occupied by troops from the empire, to\r\n    restore and maintain order and support any constitutionally\r\n    established government. This news is as generally agreeable\r\n    as it is credited. The respectable portion of the Orientals\r\n    are convinced the country cannot be governed without foreign\r\n    aid, and the numerous foreigners residing here, of course,\r\n    rejoice in the prospect of peace and order. The Government\r\n    has authorized its agent in Paris to contract a loan of\r\n    12,000,000 duros, at 70 per cent., interest payable half-yearly\r\n    at the rate of 6 per cent. on the nominal capital; also to\r\n    grant a privilege for ten years to a company (with a capital\r\n    of 3,000,000 duros) of a bank of issue and discount on the\r\n    principles of the Bank of France; and, lastly, to concede\r\n    lands to an association which undertakes to despatch several\r\n    thousands of emigrant agricultural families to this republic.\r\n    These three projects are connected with each other. If Brazil\r\n    maintains order in the country for a few years, no doubt the\r\n    immigration scheme would be as beneficial to the immigrants as\r\n    to the republic.\r\n\r\n[59] Brazil has long been diplomatically represented in this country\r\nby M. Sergio Teixeira de Macedo, envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary, 5, Mansfield-street, Portland-place, a gentleman whose\r\nhigh breeding, varied intelligence, and conciliatory manner towards\r\nall who have business at the Legation have rendered him deservedly\r\npopular, both with the _corps diplomatique_ and the public. He writes\r\nand speaks English with ease and accuracy, and having married an English\r\nlady (lately deceased) of rare accomplishments, by whom he has had a\r\nnumerous family, he is necessarily almost as familiar with the manners\r\nand usages of society amongst us as a native. His staff consists of\r\nJ. T. do Amaral, Esq., secretary of legation, and Chevaliers H. C.\r\nd’Albuquerque, J. A. da Silva Maya, A. de P. Lopes Gama, H. de T. M. de\r\nMontezuma, and J.

Robins, of Nassau, a gentleman\r\nwho has already filled many honorary posts there with much distinction,\r\nand is qualified in every way to secure to the imperial flag the same\r\nrespect that attaches to those of France, Spain, the United States,\r\n&c., in that thriving British dependency. England is represented in\r\nBrazil by Mr. H. F. Howard, who was attached to the mission at Munich in\r\n1828, appointed paid attaché at Berlin in 1832, secretary of legation\r\nat the Hague in 1845, and in 1846 at Berlin, where he was several times\r\nchargé d’affaires. He was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary at Rio Janeiro in 1853, with a salary of 4000_l._, and\r\n500_l._ per annum for house-rent. His secretary of legation is the Hon.\r\nW. G. Jerningham, who was attached to the missions at Munich and Berlin\r\nin 1834, to the embassy at Vienna in 1836, appointed paid attaché at\r\nthe Hague in 1839, and to his present post, with a salary of 550_l._\r\nper year, in 1850. The British consuls are—at Rio Janeiro, where he\r\nhad previously been vice-consul, Mr. J. J. C. Westwood, 800_l._; at\r\nBahia, Mr. J. Morgan, who was attached to the legation at Rio Janeiro\r\nas translator in 1845, appointed consul at Rio Grande in 1847, and\r\ntransferred to Bahia, where his salary is 800_l._ per annum, in 1852;\r\nvice-consul at Bahia, Mr. J. Wetherell; at Pernambuco, Mr. H. A. Cowper,\r\nformerly consul at Pará, 500_l._; at Maranham, Mr. H. W. Ovenden,\r\n300_l._; at Pará, Mr. S. Vines, 450_l._; at Paraiba, Mr. B. M. Power,\r\n400_l._; at Rio Grande do Sul, the Hon. H. P. Vereker, who was appointed\r\nto a clerkship under the Commissioners of Railways in 1848, a clerkship\r\nin the Board of Trade in 1851, and to his present post, with 800_l._\r\nper annum, in 1852; and at St. Catherine’s, Mr. R. Callander, 500_l._\r\nThese salaries are all exclusive of fees, which, in many instances, are\r\nvery considerable, emoluments frequently arising from commissions on\r\nAustralian gold dust left at Brazilian ports for shipment to Europe; but\r\nthat source of gain is far more lucrative on the west than on the east\r\ncoast of South America, and hence the increasing pecuniary importance of\r\nconsular appointments in the Chilian and Peruvian ports.\r\n\r\n[60] This was one of the most appalling disasters ever known at sea,\r\nand the sensation it produced exceeded, perhaps, that occasioned by\r\nany similar incident since the memorable destruction of the Kent East\r\nIndiaman. The Ocean Monarch American emigrant ship left Liverpool, bound\r\nfor Boston, August 24th, 1848, having 396 passengers on board. She had\r\nnot advanced far into the Irish Channel, being within six miles of Great\r\nOrmshead, Lancashire, when she took fire, and in a few hours was burnt\r\nto the water’s edge. The Brazilian steam-frigate Alfonso happened to\r\nbe out on a trial trip at the time, with the Prince and Princess de\r\nJoinville and the Duke and Duchess de Aumale on board, who witnessed\r\nthe catastrophe, and aided in rescuing and comforting the sufferers\r\nwith exceeding humanity. They, with the crews and passengers of the\r\nAlfonso and the yacht Queen of the Ocean, so effectually rendered their\r\nheroic and unwearied services as to save 156 persons from their dreadful\r\nsituation, and 62 others escaped by various means. But the rest, 178 in\r\nnumber, perished in the flames or the sea. The conduct of the New York\r\nsailor, Jerom, on this occasion, was scarcely less distinguished for\r\nbravery and self-sacrifice than that of the black sailor, Simon, at the\r\nwreck of the Pernambucana, as described at page 132.\r\n\r\n[61] A writer in the 8th edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, now\r\npublishing, says, ‘Nearly all the branches of this noble stream are\r\nnavigable to a great distance from their junction with the main trunk;\r\nand, collectively, the whole affords an extent of water communication\r\nunparalleled in any other part of the globe. What adds to this advantage\r\nis, that as the wind and the current are always opposed to each other,\r\na vessel can make her way either up or down with great facility, by\r\navailing herself of her sails in the one case, and committing herself to\r\nthe force of the current in the other.’\r\n\r\n[62] Mr. Edwards, in his ‘Voyage up the Amazon,’ before alluded to,\r\nsays, that Pará contains an area of 950,000 square miles, nearly half\r\nthe area of the United States, and all its territories. Its soil is\r\neverywhere of exhaustless fertility, and but an exceedingly small\r\nportion of it is unfitted for cultivation. The noblest rivers of the\r\nworld open communication with its remotest parts, and lie spread like a\r\nnet-work over its surface.… There is scarcely a product raised in the\r\ntwo countries in which Brazil could not undersell the United States in\r\nevery market of the world were it not for the export-tax. Its cotton\r\nand rice, even during the past year, have been shipped from Pará to New\r\nYork; its tobacco is preferable to the best Virginian, and can be raised\r\nin inexhaustible quantities.… Sooner or later, the Amazon must be the\r\nchannel of a vast commerce, and Pará must be, from the advantages of its\r\nsituation, one of the largest cities in the world.—_Edwards’s Voyage up\r\nthe Amazon._\r\n\r\nThe value of the exports from Pará in 1848 was about £148,720, of which\r\none-fourth was taken by the United States, a like quantity by Portugal,\r\none-fifth by France, one-sixth by Great Britain, and the remainder by the\r\nHanseatic towns, Belgium, Genoa, and Denmark. The value of foreign goods\r\nimported in the same year was about £147,322, principally from the United\r\nStates, Great Britain, Portugal, and France. The increase in the trade\r\nof this port will be seen by comparing the preceding statement with the\r\nexports and imports of 1851. In that year the value of the former was\r\nabout £356,200, and that of the latter about £273,067. Proportionately\r\nwith the aggregate increase, the American and British shares of the trade\r\nhad slightly advanced; while the French share had declined to one-eighth,\r\nand the Portuguese had diminished more than one-half. The trade with\r\nGenoa had ceased; but that with Sweden, which had declined since 1846,\r\nshowed very promising signs of a revival. The principal articles of\r\nexport from Pará are caoutchouc and cocoa, the mean yearly value of the\r\ntrade in the former being about £138,000, and of the latter, £67,725.\r\nAmong the articles of export in which a lesser trade is carried on may be\r\nenumerated rice, piasaba rope, annatto, sarsaparilla, hides, nuts, sugar,\r\nisinglass, and cotton.\r\n\r\n[63] Every one whom I conversed with on the subject of the Amazon\r\nadvocates with earnestness the free navigation of the river, and says\r\nthat they will never thrive until the river is thrown open to all, and\r\nforeigners are invited to settle on its banks. I think that they are\r\nsincere, for they have quite intelligence enough to see that they will be\r\nbenefited by calling out the resources of the country.—_Herndon._\r\n\r\n[64] Piasaba is a species of palm from the bark of which is made nearly\r\nall the rope used upon the Amazon. The appearance of the rope made from\r\nit is similar to that of the East India coir. The fibres of the bark are\r\nbrought down the rivers Negro and Branco, and made into ropes at Barra.\r\n\r\n[65] The Brazilian nutmeg is the fruit of a large tree that grows\r\nabundantly in the low moist lands between the rivers Negro and Yapurá,\r\nabove Barcellos, a village on the first named river. The fruit is round,\r\nand has a hard shell, containing two seeds, which are ligneous and\r\naromatic, but not equal in flavour to the Ceylon nutmeg; though this may\r\nbe owing to the want of cultivation.\r\n\r\n[66] Since my departure from the banks of the Orinoco and the Amazon, a\r\nnew era unfolds itself in the social state of the nations of the West.\r\nThe fury of civil discussions will be succeeded by the blessings of peace\r\nand a freer development of the arts of industry. The bifurcation of the\r\nOrinoco, the isthmus of Tuamini, so easy to pass over by an artificial\r\ncanal, will fix the attention of commercial Europe. The Cassiquiari—as\r\nbroad as the Rhine, and the course of which is one hundred and eighty\r\nmiles in length—will no longer form in vain a navigable canal between\r\ntwo basins of rivers, which have a surface of 190,000 square leagues.\r\nThe grain of New Grenada will be carried to the banks of the Rio Negro;\r\nboats will descend from the sources of the Napo and the Ucayali, from the\r\nAndes of Quito and upper Peru, to the mouths of the Orinoco—a distance\r\nwhich equals that from Timbuctoo to Marseilles. A country nine or ten\r\ntimes larger than Spain, and enriched with the most varied productions,\r\nis navigable in every direction by the medium of the natural canal of the\r\nCassiquiari and the bifurcation of the rivers. This phenomenon, which\r\none day will be so important for the political connexions of nations,\r\nunquestionably deserves to be carefully examined.—_Humboldt._\r\n\r\n[67] Bolivia has but one sea-port on the Pacific, that is Cobija, an open\r\nroadstead and a miserable village, at the head of the great desert of\r\nAtacama. The land transportation between this port and the agricultural\r\ndistricts of the republic is too rough, too tedious, and too expensive\r\never to admit of its becoming a commercial emporium. The direction in\r\nwhich Bolivia looks for an outlet to a market for her produce, is along\r\nher navigable water-courses that empty into the Amazon, and then down\r\nthat stream to the sea.—_Maury’s Valley of the Amazon._\r\n\r\n[68] Vast, many, and great, doubtless, are the varieties of climates,\r\nsoils, and productions within such a range. The importance to the\r\nworld of settlement, cultivation, and commerce in the Valley of the\r\nAmazon cannot be over-estimated. With the climates of India, and of\r\nall the habitable portions of the earth, piled one above the other in\r\nquick succession, tillage and good husbandry here would transfer the\r\nproductions of the East to this magnificent river-basin, and place them\r\nwithin a few days’ easy sail of Europe and the United States. Only a few\r\nmiles back we had first entered the famous mining districts of Peru. A\r\nlarge portion of the silver which constitutes the circulation of the\r\nworld was dug from the range of mountains upon which we were standing,\r\nand most of it came from that slope of them which is drained off into\r\nthe Amazon. Is it possible for commerce and navigation up and down this\r\nmajestic water-course and its beautiful tributaries to turn back this\r\nstream of silver from its western course to the Pacific, and conduct it,\r\nwith steamers, down the Amazon to the United States, there to balance the\r\nstream of gold with which we are likely to be flooded from California and\r\nAustralia?—_Herndon’s Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon._\r\n\r\n[69] On the subject of climate, I refer to the annexed chapter by my\r\nvalued friend, Dr. Dundas, who has kindly complied with my solicitation\r\nto enrich this volume with a contribution in which he has epitomised, for\r\npopular use, and in a most simple form, some of the results of his great\r\nprofessional experience and scientific research; and I am sure I only\r\nanticipate the verdict of the reader, whether medical or otherwise, in\r\ndeclaring the annexed pages to be as completely exhaustive of the subject\r\ntreated of as any reasonable limits of a work of this nature would\r\npossibly admit.\r\n\r\n[70] Mr. Wallace, in his ‘Travels on the Amazon and the Rio Negro,’\r\nobserves—‘In the districts we passed through, sugar, cotton, coffee,\r\nand rice might be grown in any quantity, and of the finest quality. The\r\nnavigation is always safe and uninterrupted, and the whole country is so\r\nintersected by igaripès and rivers that every estate has water carriage\r\nfor its productions. But the indolent disposition of the people, and the\r\nscarcity of labour, will prevent the capabilities of this fine country\r\nfrom being developed till European or North American colonies are formed.\r\nThere is no country where people can produce for themselves so many of\r\nthe necessaries and luxuries of life.… And then what advantages there\r\nare in a country where there is no stoppage of agricultural operations\r\nduring winter, but where crops may be had, and poultry be reared, all\r\nthe year round; where the least possible amount of clothing is the most\r\ncomfortable, and where a hundred little necessaries of a cold region are\r\naltogether superfluous.\r\n\r\n[71] Its capacities for trade and commerce are inconceivably great.\r\nIts industrial future is the most dazzling; and to the touch of steam,\r\nsettlement, and cultivation, this rolling stream and its magnificent\r\nwater-shed would start up into a display of industrial results that would\r\nmake the Valley of the Amazon one of the most enchanting regions on the\r\nface of the earth. From its mountains you may dig silver, iron, coal,\r\ncopper, quicksilver, zinc, and tin; from the sands of its tributaries\r\nyou may wash gold, diamonds, and precious stones; from its forests you\r\nmay gather drugs of virtues the most rare, spices of aroma the most\r\nexquisite, gums and resins of the most useful properties, dyes of hues\r\nthe most brilliant, with cabinet and building woods of the finest polish\r\nand most enduring texture. Its climate is an everlasting summer, and its\r\nharvest perennial.—_Herndon._\r\n\r\n[72] Comte-rendu de l’Académie des Sciences de Juillet, 1843, and Les\r\nMémoires des Savants étrangers de 1843.\r\n\r\n[73] Within the last few years this censure does not so strongly apply.\r\n\r\n[74] Since the above lines were written, we have had later intelligence\r\n(14th January, 1854,) from Brazil, stating the important fact that the\r\ndisease had totally disappeared from all the seaports of the empire.\r\n\r\n[75] By late accounts from Pernambuco we notice the death of Anna Vieira,\r\naged 150.\r\n\r\n[76] Since the above was written, we have learned incidentally that a\r\nletter exists from a near relative of the late Sir William Ouseley, who\r\ntook a great interest in genealogical studies, and had traced the Ouseley\r\nfamily to a high antiquity, in which the writer, after relating how he\r\nhad been foiled in endeavouring to trace a particular ancestor, adds, ‘I\r\nhave proved our descent lineally from the Carlovingian, Merovingian, and\r\nCapetian monarchs of France, the Saxon and Norman kings of England, and\r\nthe ancient kings of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. I think that is enough\r\nin all conscience, in addition to nineteen of King John’s twenty-five\r\nbarons.’\r\n\r\n[77] Gold (coined or in bullion,) is admitted duty free; wrought gold\r\nand silver at an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent.; wools and furs, 10\r\nper cent.; raw and sewing silk, 12 per cent.; woollen, flax, cotton,\r\nhardware, and paper manufactures, 15 per cent.; clothes, boots and shoes,\r\nsaddlery, sugar, coffee, tobacco, tea, olive oil, and generally all\r\nedibles, 20 per cent.; spirituous liquors, 25 per cent.; wheat and Indian\r\ncorn, small fixed duties. By chapter 2nd, relating to maritime exports,\r\nhorse skins are charged with a duty of one dollar each; sheep skins,\r\nthree dollars a dozen; other skins 4 per cent. on their marketable value;\r\nsalt tongues four reals a dozen; tallow 12 reals an arroba; hair and\r\nwool, two dollars an arroba; horns, 4 per cent. on their value. All other\r\nproducts of the province of Buenos Ayres, and in general all the fruits\r\nand production of the Argentine provinces, duty free. The introduction\r\nlandwards of foreign merchandise is prohibited. The tariff is subject to\r\nannual revision.\r\n\r\n[78] _The Trade of London with the River Plate_ has materially increased\r\nduring the last few years, and is very different now from what it was\r\ntwenty years ago. Then vessels used to be a long time on the berth, or\r\nwere partly loaded with manufactured goods, and afterwards filled up with\r\ncoals, or called at the Cape de Verds to load salt, as the remainder\r\nof their cargo; whereas, now they are despatched with full cargoes of\r\nmanufactured goods every two or three weeks. This marked improvement\r\narises partly from the comparative tranquillity of the River Plate\r\nprovinces, and the greater wants of the people, and partly from the more\r\nexpeditious and commercial mode of carriage in this country, by means of\r\nwhich considerable parcels of goods from the manufacturing districts are\r\nnow forwarded to London for shipment by the vessels regularly despatched\r\nby Messrs. Martin and Scott, the London and River Plate ship-brokers,\r\nwho afford merchants every facility in shipping by their vessels, the\r\nexpenses of goods thus forwarded never exceeding and, in many cases,\r\nbeing very considerably less, by this than by any other route whatever.\r\nThe number of vessels despatched from London within the last four years\r\nhas been about 60, averaging 15 ships, aggregating 2,745 tons’ register,\r\nor 4,423 tons of actual storeage, shipped annually. Of this number, 37\r\nwere British and 23 foreign, chiefly of the Danish flag; 25 of these\r\nvessels were sent to Buenos Ayres direct, 12 to Monte Video direct, and\r\n23 to Monte Video and Buenos Ayres, the restrictions formerly existing\r\nbetween Monte Video and Buenos Ayres, so that no vessel touching at\r\nthe one port could discharge at the other, having been abolished since\r\nthe deposition of Rosas. The goods shipped from London are coals, when\r\nrequired for ballast, iron, zinc, and other metals, paint, oil, anchors\r\nand chains, hardware, hollow ware, tools and agricultural implements,\r\nearthenware, rope, beer, &c. There are also considerable shipments of\r\nlinen, cotton, and woollen goods, hosiery, haberdashery, together with\r\na considerable quantity of millinery, silks, and fancy goods, wines,\r\nspirits, furniture, toys, and pianos. Of these goods, anchors and chains,\r\ntools and agricultural implements, earthenware, and cotton goods are,\r\nfor the most part, sent up specially from the inland manufacturing\r\ndistricts for shipment. The produce of the River Plate arriving in London\r\nis very considerable, and consists of salted and dry ox and cow-hides,\r\nhorse-hides, tallow, mares’ grease, bone-ash, animal manure, wool, hair,\r\nhorns, and bones. There is also, occasionally, a small quantity of\r\nParaguay tobacco, ostrich and vulture feathers, nutria, chinchilla, and\r\nother skins. These remarks apply in an increased degree to Liverpool,\r\nbetween which port and the Plate the commercial intercourse is infinitely\r\ngreater than between London and the Plate, the imports and exports being\r\nnecessarily much the same as to quality. The trade between Liverpool and\r\nthe ports of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video for 1853 collectively amounted\r\nto 64 vessels, consisting of 11,850 tons.\r\n\r\n[79] Sir William Gore Ouseley was the British Minister here referred to.\r\nIt is alike foreign to the purposes of this volume, and to the wishes\r\nof the writer, to express any opinion on the policy pursued by England,\r\nin the affairs of the Plate, at the period mentioned; but he deems it\r\nthe merest justice to the reputation of the diplomatist just named for\r\nsagaciously judging of ‘coming events’ by the ‘shadows cast before,’\r\nto record a fact familiar to every one who has sojourned, for ever so\r\nbrief a period, in the River Plate, viz., that the inhabitants of all\r\nclasses, without exception, native or foreign, are as unanimous now in\r\ntheir approving remembrance of his conduct, as they were at the time it\r\nelicited their spontaneous applause in an enduring and complimentary\r\nform. Not less than 800 native Monte Videans, embracing the elite of\r\nthe whole community[A] not actually in the interest of the enemy,\r\ntendered their grateful thanks for his efforts to preserve the national\r\nindependence—efforts which, had they not been thwarted in quarters where\r\nthe utmost assistance should have been accorded, would have secured\r\nthat object, while avoiding years of war and bloodshed, and saving some\r\nmillions of property lost to the commerce of the world by a continuance\r\nof the disturbances by Rosas. His exertions for the promotion of commerce\r\nformed the most marked item of eulogium in the address from the French[B]\r\ninhabitants, and is particularly deserving of being dwelt upon, now\r\nthat the mercantile course of action he recommended so strenuously, as\r\nto the opening of the rivers, has been ratified in respect to Paraguay,\r\nwhither he sent our recent Plenipotentiary there no less than eight\r\nyears ago, as we shall see when we come to speak of that country. Of the\r\nsense entertained of his merits by the English at Monte Video, their\r\naddress,[C] subjoined below, is sufficiently explanatory; but something\r\nstill more significant is the circumstance that, though Sir William was\r\na party to the unfortunate loan by British capitalists, and though it\r\nhas been hitherto found impossible to obtain payment thereof, principal\r\nor interest, in any form, no word of censure is vented against him; for\r\nit is felt that the loan was a wise and prudent measure at the time,\r\nand that had the spirit in which it was entered into on both sides been\r\ncarried out in the sense then understood, as it readily might have been,\r\nbut for shortsightedness at home, the lenders would have been paid with\r\nat least as much regularity as the French government, who continued their\r\nassistance long after England had backed out of the engagement, to the\r\nsame effect. And, undoubtedly, the French government have every right\r\nto be paid; for, without their continuous aid Monte Video must have\r\nfallen, and Rosas would at this moment have been Dictator of the whole\r\nArgentine Confederation, of which the Uruguay, and probably Paraguay\r\nalso, would have been component parts. It is further felt that even after\r\nthe untoward turn affairs have taken, as regards the original engagement\r\nabout the loan, the interest might readily be continued to be paid, were\r\nthe customs’ receipts administered in the judicious mode initiated when\r\nSir William obtained the money for the government, viz., by a committee,\r\ncomposed chiefly of foreign merchants, who collected the dues with so\r\nsmall an expense that there was always a considerable surplus; whereas in\r\nnative hands the aggregate received barely paid the cost of collection.\r\nIt is gratifying to find, even at the twelfth hour, years after\r\nmisrepresentations to the contrary had effected their momentary object\r\nin causing the recall of Sir William from an arena where the cajolery\r\nand the bullying of Rosas were rendered alike abortive by the tact and\r\nvigour of the British Minister, that these truths are now recognized, not\r\nmerely by the Anglo South American public, but by the English authorities\r\nat home, whose _esprit de corps_ renders them ever reluctant to admit\r\nthat an injustice can be committed against a servant of the Crown, and\r\nstill more reluctant to make any reparation for it.[D] On the accession\r\nof the Derby administration, one of the first acts of the Foreign\r\nMinister, Lord Malmesbury, who, in common with the Imperial ruler of\r\nFrance, had devoted a great deal of consideration to questions of South\r\nAmerican commercial policy, was to despatch Sir C. Hotham on a mission\r\nfor the completion of the work in which that gallant officer had been\r\npreviously engaged at the instance of Sir William; and the noble lord,\r\nrightly feeling how much was due to the originator of the same design,\r\nobtained the Order of the Bath for the late minister to the Plate,\r\nexpressly on the ground of the services he had rendered to his country\r\nand to humanity during his mission there, and which are specially alluded\r\nto in the addresses presented to him, as quoted in the foregoing page.\r\nThough the present administration do not, or at least did not, appear\r\nto attach the same importance as their predecessors to the recent South\r\nAmerican commercial treaties, it is understood that they have not failed\r\nto express their appreciation of the pioneer in the path of progress\r\nin that direction; and that they have admitted that a very hasty, and\r\nconsequently very erroneous, judgment had been passed on his political\r\nconduct in the Plate. Why that judgment should have been hasty, why it\r\nshould have been formed on the representations of those whose policy and\r\nwhose patron, (the Dictator,) have since been swept away, and are now\r\nonly mentioned to be derided, is a secret which it would require the\r\npenetrative perseverance of Mr. Urquhart himself to detect. But it is, at\r\nleast, satisfactory to know that the _amende_ has been made as liberally\r\nas it is in the nature of the official genus to do these things; and\r\nthat a gentleman in whose family the diplomatic faculty may be said\r\nto be hereditary,[E] and with whom we have reason to hope it will not\r\nterminate,[F] has been authoritatively pronounced to have proved himself\r\nworthy of his antecedents. It is, however, more immediately in reference\r\nto his services to commerce that his name is introduced here; for it is\r\nimpossible to allude to the late South American treaties of ’53 without\r\nfeeling that Sir W. Gore Ouseley’s labours of ’46 in that cause place him\r\nin the same relation to what has been accomplished by Lord Malmesbury and\r\nSir C. Hotham as the inquiries of the Import Duties’ Committee placed\r\nMr. Hume in respect to the Free-trade achievements of Messrs. Cobden and\r\nBright.\r\n\r\n[A] Senor.

Ciertos de la eficacia de esta\r\ngarantia y del interes politico y comercial que tienen esas dos grandes\r\npotencias en el mantenimiento de la Nacionalidad Oriental,—con todas sus\r\nconsecuencias, y en que no que—de absorvida por un Poder anti-social\r\ny repulsivo de toda idea civilizadora, los Orientales procuraron su\r\napoyo y una alianza justa y decorosa. El principio en que esta alianza\r\nse basaba era honroso, y los fines, a mas de honrosos civilizadores y\r\nfecundos en resultados beneficos, para la paz externa de estas regiones,\r\ny para la paz interior de nuestro pais que deseamos, con toda la fuerza\r\nde que somos capaces, teniendo por mira unica, que reconciliada la\r\nfamilia Oriental a que pertenecemos, fuera de toda coaccion e influencia\r\nestrana, pueda elegir en libertad, y en la forma consagrada en sus\r\nleyes, un Gobierno suyo, que la rija con suecion a la Constitucion y\r\na los intereses Orientales.

The war\r\n    which desolates our native soil is strictly, on the part\r\n    of the Orientals, a struggle of legitimate defence and of\r\n    independence—a struggle which we have not provoked, and in\r\n    the result of which we neither seek nor desire more than the\r\n    preservation of the position in which we were placed by the\r\n    compact celebrated in 1828, between the Empire of Brazil and\r\n    the Argentine Republic—a position recognized by all nations,\r\n    and virtually, but solemnly, guaranteed by England and\r\n    France. Certain of the efficacy of this guarantee, and of the\r\n    political and commercial interest of these two great Powers\r\n    in the maintenance of the Oriented Nationality, with all its\r\n    consequences, and in its not being crushed by an anti-social\r\n    power, repelling every idea of civilization, the Orientals\r\n    sought their aid, and a just and proper alliance. The principle\r\n    on which this alliance was based was honourable, and its\r\n    objects, besides being honourable, were civilizing and fertile\r\n    in beneficial results for the external peace of these regions,\r\n    and for the internal peace of our country, which we desire with\r\n    all the strength we possess, having for sole object, that the\r\n    Oriental family to which we belong being reconciled, it may,\r\n    without foreign coercion or influence, elect, freely, and in\r\n    the mode consecrated by its laws, its own government, which\r\n    shall rule it in conformity with the constitution and the\r\n    Oriental interests. The two agents charged in 1845, by England\r\n    and France, to give aid to the Oriental nationality and restore\r\n    peace to our hearths, and the Admirals Englefield and Lainé,\r\n    who had command of the intervening forces, have discharged so\r\n    noble a mission in the manner most cordial, most in conformity\r\n    with the intentions explicitly declared by their governments,\r\n    and with the thoughts and desire of ours, and of all good\r\n    Orientals; for which we acknowledge that we owe them sincere\r\n    and profound gratitude. We beg your Excellency will permit us\r\n    to record in this letter, as regards yourself personally, the\r\n    expression of this sentiment; let us add that of the wishes\r\n    we entertain for your prosperity, and we beg you always to\r\n    preserve a recollection of our country and that of those\r\n    citizens, who, faithful interpreters of the feelings of the\r\n    country in which they live, have the honour of offering to your\r\n    Excellency the homage of the respect, adhesion and friendship\r\n    which we possess, and with which we are,—your Excellency’s most\r\n    faithful servants, &c., &c._\r\n\r\n[B] Monsieur le Ministre Plénipotentiaire. Les soussignés, residants\r\nFrançais à Montevideo, ont appris avec une sincere affliction votre\r\nprochain départ pour l’Angleterre. Les preuves réitérées de votre\r\nbienveillance pour nous, le parfait accord qui a tonjours régné entre\r\nvous et Monsieur le Baron Deffaudis, votre générosité envers nos com\r\npatriotes malheureux, la noblesse de votre caractère, votre constante\r\nsollicitude à défendre les intérèts généraux du commerce, peuvent\r\nvous avoir attiré l’animosité des ennemis de l’intervention et de\r\nl’humanite; mais ils vous ont acquis la reconnaissance des populations\r\ncivilisées des deux rives de la Plate. Daignez done, Monsieur le Ministre\r\nPlénipotentiaire, accepter le tribut de nos regrets les plus sinceres;\r\ncroire que votre souvenir nous sera toujours cher, et agréer l’hommage\r\ndes sentiments respectueux avec lesquels nous avons l’honneur d’être,\r\nMonsieur le Ministre Plénipotentiaire, vos très-obeissants serviteurs.\r\n\r\n[C] Address of the British residents and merchants to the British\r\nminister to the states of La Plata.—We, the undersigned, British\r\nmerchants and residents of Monte Video, having learned with sorrow, that\r\nyour Excellency is on the eve of retiring from the position you have\r\nheld amongst us, with so much credit to yourself and benefit to our\r\ncountry, beg leave to express our sense of admiration at the enlightened\r\nand impartial conduct, just views, and penetrating judgment which have\r\ndistinguished you throughout your arduous career, during the intervention\r\nof the British and French governments in the River Plate. We gladly bear\r\nwitness to the firmness, justice, and humanity, which characterized your\r\nproceedings, amidst the numerous difficulties and afflicting scenes which\r\nhave often surrounded you; and we have beheld with unmixed satisfaction\r\nthe constant harmony that has prevailed between your Excellency and your\r\nrespected colleague, Baron Deffaudis, which as well as your individual\r\nefforts, has so greatly promoted concord and unanimity among all classes\r\nof both nations, and foreigners, in Monte Video. Impressed with a deep\r\nsense of obligation for your invariable attention to the interests of\r\nBritish subjects, and for your watchful care over their persons and\r\nproperty, whenever endangered, and also for the kindness and urbanity\r\nwhich have marked your personal intercourse with us, we cannot permit\r\nyour Excellency to leave these shores without receiving our heartfelt\r\nthanks and grateful acknowledgments. With a just appreciation of the\r\nmerits of your Excellency in your official capacity, and an affectionate\r\nregard for your private character, we beg you will accept our sincere\r\nwishes for the future health and happiness of yourself and family. We\r\nhave the honour to be, &c. (Signed by 85 British residents.)\r\n\r\n[D] This, however, is more apparent than real. Though the Earl of Derby,\r\nspeaking on the Address to the Throne, the opening night of the present\r\nsession, pleasantly twitted Ministers with their omission in the Royal\r\nSpeech of all allusion to Sir C. Hotham’s Paraguayan mission, and with\r\nconsequent indifference to its objects, it must not be inferred that the\r\nAberdeen Cabinet is in the least degree insensible to the importance of\r\nsecuring such benefits to our commerce as the Malmesbury Treaty seeks\r\nto accomplish, though there may be some discrepancy of opinion as to\r\nthe extent that treaty succeeded in such direction. Seven years ago,\r\nLord Aberdeen, then foreign secretary in the Peel Administration, in his\r\ninstructions to Sir William G. Ouseley, then minister at Buenos Ayres,\r\nfor his guidance in the joint intervention by England and France between\r\nBuenos Ayres and Monte Video, said:—‘The war in which the Argentine arms\r\nare at present engaged, is waged against a state, the independence of\r\nwhich England is virtually bound to uphold.’ Lord Aberdeen instructed his\r\nminister, ‘to open up the great arteries of the South-American continent\r\nto the free circulation of commerce, would be not only a vast benefit to\r\nthe trade of Europe, but a practical, and perhaps the best, security for\r\nthe preservation of peace in South America.’\r\n\r\n[E] So long ago as the reign of Elizabeth, Sir John Ouseley, of\r\nCourteen-hall, Northamptonshire, a distinguished military officer,\r\nin obedience to the orders of the Earl of Essex, then commanding in\r\nPortugal, went ambassador to the Emperor of Morocco, and subsequently\r\nfell at the siege of Breda, in 1624. The uncle of Sir William and father\r\nof the present baronet (Rev. Sir F. Arthur Gore Ouseley, to whom the Duke\r\nof Wellington, the Duke of York, and Marchioness of Salisbury, stood\r\nsponsors), was the celebrated ambassador to Persia, of which country he\r\nobtained the Order of the Lion and the Sun, and subsequently the Grand\r\nCross of the Imperial Russian Order of St. Alexander Newski, when he was\r\nappointed plenipotentiary to St. Petersburgh. His brother, Sir William,\r\n(father of the late minister to the Plate), accompanied him to Persia,\r\nwas the well-known historian of that mission, as already stated, and\r\nauthor of many learned Oriental works, in recognition of whose merits he\r\nreceived the Order of Knighthood.\r\n\r\n[F] The eldest son of Sir William, Mr. W. Charles Ouseley, accompanied\r\nthe expedition of the blockading squadron up the Parana river; and,\r\ninheriting his father’s faculty of pictorial delineation, as evinced in\r\nthe ‘South American Sketches,’ contributed to that magnificent volume two\r\nsubjects, taken at Corrientes, which will be found copied in the chapter\r\ndevoted to that country; but, owing to haste on the part of our artist,\r\nthe copy affords an imperfect idea of the original. Mr. W. C. Ouseley\r\nlikewise accompanied Sir C. Hotham, as attaché, during the recent mission\r\nto Paraguay, and returned with his Excellency in the autumn of 1853.\r\n\r\n[80] The liberal spirit of this State encourages foreigners. Imitating\r\nthe United States, it facilitates the acquirements of the privileges of\r\nnative citizens by emigrants from foreign countries, and even surpasses,\r\nin this respect, the wise provisions of that system, so advantageous\r\nfor a new and thinly-peopled country, and so successfully adopted\r\nby North America. Foreign merchants have brought their business and\r\ncapital to Monte Video, while hard-working Basques, Germans, Irish,\r\nFrench, and Italians, (chiefly Genoese) have flocked to this city,\r\nand, in most instances, obtained the rights of denizens or citizens.\r\nResidence, marriage with a native, the acquisition of a certain amount\r\nof property, real or personal, are among the conditions conferring\r\ncitizenship. This privilege may appear to be somewhat easily granted;\r\nbut it must be recollected that no ‘Oriental’ citizen existed previous\r\nto 1828; consequently there has not been time for the development of\r\nany very jealous feeling of exclusive national rights, as possessed by\r\none race only in the republic of the Uruguay. It is for these reasons\r\nthat so many foreigners have flocked to the Banda Oriental, and settled\r\nin the interior as well as in the towns; and hence the rapid increase\r\nof Monte Video in trade and population, which even the invasion and\r\nsiege of its capital, so lately at an end, have not sufficed to reduce\r\nto the level of their former comparative insignificance. The whole of\r\nthe Banda Oriental being freed from the invaders, and the independence\r\nof the republic being guaranteed by Brazil, commerce and agriculture\r\nare therefore now reviving; and it is to be hoped that the numerous\r\nresources of the country will be peaceably and usefully developed; while\r\nthe free navigation of the tributaries of the River Plate, now ensured,\r\nwill be of the greatest importance to the trade of all nations, and\r\nproduce incalculable benefits to the States through which those noble\r\nrivers flow. The exports, as before stated, comprise all of the staple\r\ncommodities produced by the Argentine provinces, viz: hides, tallow,\r\nhorns, horse-hair, jerked beef, wool, &c., to which, in all probability,\r\ncorn will be added in a few years, the soil of this State being for the\r\nmost part admirably adapted to agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\n[81] It is not within the scope of this publication to give anything\r\nlike a history of the several places touched at, still less of a place\r\nwhose late history, in particular, has been so unprecedentedly troublous,\r\neven in these regions of disorder, as has that of the capital of the\r\nUruguay. Still a few particulars are essential, and in matters of this\r\nsort no authority is preferable to that of Sir W. Parish. Monte Video\r\nwas commenced in 1726, under the name of San Felipe, Puerto de Monte\r\nVideo, by Zavala, governor of Buenos Ayres, who had been ordered by the\r\ngovernment to make permanent settlements there and at Maldonado, for the\r\nmore effectual maintenance of the rights of the Spanish crown, after\r\ndislodging the Portuguese from the vicinity of the former place, where\r\nthey had established themselves. Some families were transported thither\r\nfrom the Canaries, and others removed there from Buenos Ayres, in order\r\nto secure the privileges offered to the new settlers. The viceroy sent\r\nlarge sums of money from Potosi to carry on the works; and the walls in\r\ndue time assumed, with the labour of the Guavian Indians, the appearance\r\nof an important fortification. In 1808, when the intelligence of the\r\nabdication of the king, and the declaration of war against France, was\r\nreceived at Buenos Ayres, Elio, the Governor of Monte Video, was the\r\nfirst to disobey the orders of Don Santiago Liniers, the viceroy at the\r\ntime; and convoking the inhabitants, established an independent junta of\r\nthe Monte Videans, after the example of those set up in the Peninsula.\r\nThey subsequently took their share in the war of independence; and their\r\ndeputies, with those of all the other provinces of the Rio de la Plata,\r\nassembled in congress at Tucuman, solemnly declared their separation\r\nfrom Spain, and their determination to constitute a free and independent\r\nState, on the 19th of July, 1816. During the struggle with the mother\r\ncountry, one common object, paramount to all other considerations, the\r\ncomplete establishment of their political independence, bound together\r\nthe widely spread provinces of the old viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres; but\r\nthe very circumstances of that struggle, and the vicissitudes of the\r\nwar, which often for long periods cut off their communications with\r\ntheir old metropolis and with each other, obliging them to provide\r\nseparately for their new temporary government and security, gave rise,\r\nespecially in those at a distance, to habits of independence, which, as\r\nthey acquired strength, loosened, more or less, the ties which bound\r\nthem to Buenos Ayres, and in some cases produced an entire separation.\r\nAmongst others, the Banda Oriental was withdrawn from the authority of\r\nthe capital by the notorious Artigas, whose anarchical proceedings,\r\nfraught with the most fatal consequences to the peace of the republic,\r\nafforded a plausible pretext for the occupation of Monte Video by their\r\nPortuguese neighbours—the cause, eventually, of a long and ruinous war\r\nbetween the republic and Brazil, which was only terminated by British\r\nmediation, and by the territory in question being erected into a new and\r\nindependent State, in 1828. Some further particulars, respecting both\r\nits previous and subsequent history, will be found under the head of\r\nBuenos Ayres. Besides Monte Video, the chief towns are Colonia (nearly\r\nopposite Buenos Ayres) and Maldonado; together with sixteen smaller\r\ntowns, several hamlets, and numerous estançias or farms, and ranchos or\r\ncottages; but the whole population of the republic, which is divided\r\ninto nine departments, and covers a fertile area of about 200,000 square\r\nmiles suited for almost every purpose required by man, does not exceed\r\nprobably one half the population of Liverpool. Still it is growing, and\r\nwill continue to grow, for, during the few years of peace, since its\r\nindependence, the population has increased, that of the capital from\r\nabout 12,000 to nearly 50,000. The city proper, formerly not extending\r\nbeyond the citadel (now converted into a marketplace), rapidly spread,\r\nand handsome buildings and streets were constructed, extending as far\r\nas the recent inner (formerly the outer) lines of the fortification,\r\nenlarging the area to several times its previous size. Beyond are villas\r\nand ‘saladeros’ (establishments for slaughtering cattle and preparing\r\nhides and tallow), while pretty and sometimes spacious suburban dwellings\r\nsurrounded by well-cultivated gardens, extend to a considerable distance\r\nbeyond the outer walls.\r\n\r\n[82] Lady Louisa Tennison, who, in her beautiful work _Andalusia, &c._,\r\npublished by Bentley at the close of last year [1853], says:—\r\n\r\n    I know that I shall be accused of insensibility and want of\r\n    taste, when I confess that my first disappointment on landing\r\n    in Spain was the almost total absence of beauty amongst the\r\n    Spanish women. Poets have sung of Spain’s ‘dark-glancing\r\n    daughters,’ and travellers have wandered through the country,\r\n    with minds so deeply impressed with the preconceived idea of\r\n    the beauty of the women, that they have found them all their\r\n    imaginations so fondly pictured, and their works have fostered,\r\n    what I cannot help maintaining, is a mere delusion; one of the\r\n    many in which people still indulge when they think and dream\r\n    of Spain. The women of Spain have magnificent eyes, beautiful\r\n    hair, and generally fine teeth; but more than that cannot be\r\n    said by those who are content to give an honest opinion. I\r\n    have rarely seen one whose features could be called strictly\r\n    beautiful, and that bewitching grace and fascination about\r\n    their figures and their walk which they formerly possessed,\r\n    have disappeared with the high comb which supported the\r\n    mantilla, and the narrow _basquina_, which gave a peculiar\r\n    character to their walk. With the change in their costume,\r\n    those distinctive charms have vanished. The gaudy colours which\r\n    now prevail have destroyed the elegance that always accompanies\r\n    black, in which alone, some years since, a lady could appear\r\n    in public. No further proof of this is required than to see\r\n    the same people at church, where black is still considered\r\n    indispensable, and on the Alameda with red dresses and yellow\r\n    shawls, or some colours equally gaudy, and combined with as\r\n    little regard to taste. The men have likewise abandoned the\r\n    cloak, and now appear in paletots and every variety of foreign\r\n    invention: nor have they either gained by their sacrifices\r\n    at the altar of French fashion. By no means distinguished\r\n    in figure, none needed more the rich folds of the _capa_ to\r\n    lend them that air of grace and dignity which it peculiarly\r\n    possesses.\r\n\r\n[83] The appearance of the city of Monte Video is most prepossessing.\r\nIt is built on an eminence which forms a small peninsula, being washed\r\non three sides by the sea, and from the various sea-breezes to which\r\nthe situation exposes it, must be a very healthy spot. It is calculated\r\nto maintain a very extensive commerce, and would, doubtless, long have\r\nenjoyed it, had not the vitality of the little Republic sunk under\r\nthe obstinate persecution to which it was subjected by Rosas, in the\r\nperson of the savage and overbearing Lieutenant Orebbe. At the time of\r\nmy visit the Brazilian fleet, under the command of Admiral Wingfield,\r\nwas in the offing. Notwithstanding the devastating effects of war, this\r\ncity, Phœnix-like, is again rising from her ashes. Lines of bastions and\r\nbatteries are daily giving place to scenes of commercial enterprise and\r\nagricultural activity. The husbandman labours with his ploughshare and\r\nthe sickle, where deadly engines of war once vented forth their flames.\r\nStreets lined with new and extensive buildings are met with at every\r\nturn. Elegant French shops attract the eye, as their well-stored windows\r\nexhibit the beautiful fabrics of European manufacture. So great is the\r\nnumber of foreigners who are domiciled in the city, that it has quite the\r\nappearance of a colony of strangers, the natives of the country forming\r\nbut a small proportion of the entire population. The Basques predominate.\r\nAfter that the Italians take the lead. Little good has been effected\r\nby the maintenance of a foreign legion for so long a time, under the\r\nauspices of the celebrated Italian leader, Garibaldi. The present troops\r\nof the Republic are the emancipated negroes, officered by native whites.\r\nThe Hotel de Paris is kept by a French cook, who at one time belonged to\r\na French vessel of war. For the accommodation of a few rooms and board\r\nfor three persons, I was charged here at the rate of a doubloon a day.\r\nThere are several other hotels in the city. That of Il Comercio bears a\r\ngood repute. The whole place, including the suburbs, literally swarms\r\nwith _cafés_ and _estaminets_. That of the Bal d’Oro, which is a large\r\nestablishment near the quay, carries off the palm, and is much frequented\r\nby officers of the French navy. The various dwelling-houses are provided\r\nwith flat roofs, and these, combined with a number of observatories,\r\nwhich are the constant resort of the inmates, gave the city a lively and\r\nagreeable aspect. The market-place, which formerly formed a part of the\r\nold fort or citadel in the time of the Spaniards, is well supplied with\r\nevery species of provisions. Its display of fish far surpasses that of\r\nBuenos Ayres, both as regards variety and quality.\r\n\r\nAs a maritime and commercial port, Monte Video holds a very desirable\r\nposition, and will doubtless before long supersede Buenos Ayres, as the\r\nfirst port on the coast for the disembarkation of goods for the internal\r\nconsumption of the country. The effects of the cessation of hostilities\r\nbegin already to be seen in a great outlay of capital; and in the course\r\nof a few years, when commercial relations are on a better basis, and\r\nsecurity to life and property is better insured, this city will rise into\r\ngreater mercantile importance than any other in this part of the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n[84] Owing to the disturbed condition in which the Banda Oriental had\r\nbeen for so many years, during the aggression of Rosas, and the absorbing\r\nanxiety that has since prevailed to repair some of the disasters so\r\noccasioned, added to the domestic dissentions that have too often\r\nsupervened, the authorities in the Uruguay have not been able to devote\r\nmuch attention to the cultivation of European diplomatic relations.\r\nAny affairs of that nature in England pertaining to the republic are\r\ntransacted at the Consulate Office, New Palace Yard, Westminster; and\r\ncommercial consular matters in Liverpool by Mr. Hall, Dale-street, who\r\nis himself a citizen, and the son of a citizen, of the Uruguay, having\r\nsucceeded his father in his present office. The British diplomatic and\r\nconsular staff in the Uruguay consists of Mr. G. J. R. Gordon, who was\r\nprivate secretary to the late Sir Edward Disbrowe, at Stuttgard, in 1832,\r\nwas appointed unpaid attaché at Frankfort in 1833, at Stockholm in 1834,\r\npaid attaché at Rio Janeiro in 1836, chargé d’affaires there in 1837, to\r\na special mission in Paraguay in 1842, secretary of legation at Stockholm\r\nin 1843, and chargé d’affaires and consul-general in the Uruguay in 1853.\r\nHis salary in the latter capacity is 1400l. per annum, exclusive of 1_l._\r\nper day for diplomatic services as chargé d’affaires. The vice-consul at\r\nMonte Video, who receives 500_l._ per annum, or 100_l._ more than the\r\nsame officer at Buenos Ayres, is Mr. G. S. L. Hunt, who served some time\r\nin the army, was a supernumerary clerk in the Librarian’s Department of\r\nthe Foreign Office in 1846, and in 1847 was appointed to his present post\r\nat Monte Video, where he for some time acted as consul-general.\r\n\r\n[85] Many of the Buenos Ayrean houses, especially in the suburbs, consist\r\nof a square of building surrounding a Patio, or quadrangular court,\r\npaved with marble, and having either a fountain, or, more frequently, a\r\ndraw-well, in the centre, and often pleasingly ornamented with flowers,\r\nshrubs and fruit. The mode and materials of building here, as in other\r\nparts of South America, are such as to obviate, in a great degree, the\r\ndanger of fire. Stone or brick, iron, stucco, and tiles are the chief\r\ncomponent parts of a house; little wood is employed, except for beams,\r\nand this is generally hard and heavy, especially in Brazil, and not\r\nreadily combustible, as explained in a previous chapter. The floors,\r\nexcept in some houses built by foreigners, are not constructed of wood,\r\nbut of glazed tiles, as in the South of Europe; the staircases being also\r\nof solid masonry. The population of Buenos Ayres had been constantly\r\ndecreasing since the time Rosas introduced his reign of terror; but\r\nthere is now a decided turn in the state of things in that respect. It\r\nmay be simply classified into the white and coloured races; the latter\r\nconstituting nearly a fourth of the whole, which is a smaller proportion\r\nthan in any other town on the east side of South America. The slave-trade\r\nwas prohibited in 1813, by a decree of the first constituent assembly,\r\nconsequently any further supply of the negro-stock has ceased; and since\r\nthen slavery has gradually become extinguished, not only in Buenos Ayres,\r\nbut in all the provinces of La Plata, either by the slaves enrolling\r\nthemselves as soldiers, or by their purchasing their freedom. The negroes\r\nnow constitute, perhaps, the most useful and industrious class of the\r\nlower orders of the community.\r\n\r\n[86] A large proportion of the population of Buenos Ayres, as is stated\r\nin the text, consists of foreigners, many of whom have formed matrimonial\r\nalliances with the native ladies. The latter are reputed the handsomest\r\nwomen in South America; though the palm is disputed by their fair sisters\r\nof Monte Video, on the grounds set forth in the chapter on that head;\r\nand, in the unsophisticated state of society in which they move, their\r\nfrank and obliging manners render them doubly attractive to strangers.\r\nThey are passionately fond of dancing; and in their love of, if not\r\nproficiency in, music will vie with the young ladies of any country in\r\nthe world. Amongst the men the same taste, in a higher degree, appears to\r\nbe developed in a talent for poetry; and they are generally well-grounded\r\nin most of the leading branches of general, and especially of commercial,\r\nknowledge. Living is very moderate here: the river abounds in excellent\r\nfish; and fresh meat may be purchased at an exceedingly low rate. Water\r\nis comparatively the most expensive article, for the lower orders are\r\nobliged to depend for a supply upon the itinerant water-carriers, who\r\nhawk it about the streets in ox-carts. But the higher classes generally\r\nhave large tanks or reservoirs under the pavement of their courtyards,\r\ninto which the rain-water, collected from the flat-terraced roofs of\r\ntheir houses, is conducted by pipes, and, in general, a sufficiency may\r\nthus be secured for the ordinary purposes of the family. In addition to\r\nwhat has been said of the climate of Buenos Ayres, it may be remarked\r\nthat at times it is insufferably hot; the prevailing character of the\r\natmosphere, however, being dampness, which produces many bronchial\r\naffections. But although the whole country appears low and marshy, cases\r\nof intermittent fever are hardly known there; and it may therefore be\r\nconsidered generally healthy, but certainly not to the extent to justify\r\nthe appellation of Buenos Ayres—Good Airs—bestowed upon it by Menoza, its\r\noriginal founder, in special allusion to its supposed salubrity.\r\n\r\n[87] The buildings are generally not more than two stories high, _i.e._,\r\na ground floor, and one over it, unless the ‘açoteas,’ or terraces,\r\nare to be considered as a third, along which, the whole range of a\r\n‘block’ of houses may, by climbing over the partitions or parapets, be\r\ntraversed without descending into the streets. In times of siege, attacks\r\nby foreign enemies, or during internal struggles, these houses form\r\ntemporary fortresses, admitting of formidable defence; and being solidly\r\nbuilt and furnished with strong gates and doors, while the windows of\r\nthe lower and ground-floors are protected by strong iron bars, it is no\r\neasy matter to take a town, or even a house, built in this way, as has\r\nbeen sufficiently proved on the occasion in question. Whitelock was a\r\nvain, foolish, insensible man, though not a coward, as was generally\r\nbelieved, and the prevalence of which belief partly led to his being\r\ndisgraced on his return home. The fact is, he seems to have had a most\r\ncontemptuous opinion of the Spaniards, from the circumstance of the place\r\nhaving been taken a short time previously, almost without resistance,\r\nby Admiral Sir Home Popham and Viscount Beresford, the armament having\r\nbeen fitted out, without any authority from England, at the Cape of Good\r\nHope; and so elated was its commander by his unexpected success that he\r\nwrote home declaring all South America to be ready to receive us with\r\nopen arms. So indeed, it proved in one sense, as Whitelock subsequently\r\nfound to his cost on attempting to recover the city after the British\r\ngarrison had been expelled; for his men were mown down with musketry\r\nand grape in scores, without being able to return the fire with any\r\neffect. It was on this occasion that the gallant Colonel Thompson, late\r\nM.P. for Bradford, was taken prisoner by General Liniers, who was shot\r\nas a rebel three years afterwards himself. The excesses Thompson saw\r\ncommitted under Whitelock impelled him to that denunciation of flogging,\r\nand other military abuses, which had so offended the authorities at home\r\nthat he has never had his proper promotion by seniority, and is now\r\n(March, 1854) an unredressed complainant against the injustice of having\r\nbeen passed over in the last brevet, and told that his name shall never\r\nappear in another. As the news of the extraordinary success of Popham\r\nand Beresford at Buenos Ayres stimulated the despatch of an expedition\r\nthe following year, under Sir Samuel Auchmuchty, against Monte Video,\r\nwhere, however the British suffered most severely, one third of the\r\nwhole army being killed, though finally effecting the capture of the\r\nplace, so was its evacuation caused some six months subsequently by the\r\nintelligence of the defeat of Whitelock—the withdrawal of the whole of\r\nthe English force from the Plate being, indeed, the condition on which\r\nthe Spaniards gave up their prisoners, and permitted the survivors of\r\nthese ill-starred expeditions to withdraw in peace. The commander of\r\nthe land forces of the first expedition against Buenos Ayres, Viscount\r\nBeresford, who was then taken prisoner, but escaped, and afterwards\r\ncaptured Madeira, which he held for some years on behalf of the crown\r\nof Portugal, in the wars of which country, especially at Albuera, he so\r\neminently distinguished himself, died only in the course of the present\r\nyear. The late Lord Holland, in his posthumous ‘Memoirs of the Whig\r\nParty during My Time,’ published a few weeks back, has a very singular\r\nchapter on the secret history of these expeditions. His lordship, who was\r\na member of the cabinet at the time, says that Whitelock’s was but one\r\nof a series of South American expeditions, and that it was originally\r\ndestined for Valparaiso. It was fortunately ‘detained by subsequent\r\nevents at Buenos Ayres, and the worst part of our plan was thus concealed\r\nfrom the knowledge, and escaped the censure, of the public.’ Had the then\r\nminister, Lord Grenville, remained in office, he would have sent against\r\nMexico Sir Arthur Wellesley, who, in that case, might probably never have\r\nbecome Duke of Wellington. Sir Arthur, however, was sent to Portugal,\r\nwhere the Convention of Cintra seemed to offer an augury of evil to the\r\ncroakers, which his genius subsequently so gloriously falsified.\r\n\r\n[88] I shall not only not repeat none of the Cenci-like stories told\r\nof this lady and her father, and current in every mouth on the Plata,\r\nbut tell something of a very different kind from Mr. Bonelli, adding,\r\nhowever, that it is the first of the sort I ever heard, and I am quite\r\nsure it will be looked upon as rare news in Buenos Ayres, though Mr.\r\nM’Cann also says something similar, viz.—\r\n\r\nThis severe and bloodthirsty man had a daughter, and it is pleasing to\r\nturn away from the contemplation of the many vices which disfigure his\r\ncharacter to those beautiful traits of humanity and tenderness which\r\ndistinguished hers. Manisiletta was loved and honoured by all; pity\r\nlurked within her soul, and every attribute of womanly feeling was there.\r\nThis good creature, with tears and supplication, often prevailed with\r\nthe harsh tyrant when other means were useless. At her entreaties, many\r\na life was spared, and many a prayer of gratitude has ascended to heaven\r\nfor the rescue of a father or a brother from his impending fate, at her\r\nkind interference.\r\n\r\n[89] In January 1831, the provinces of Buenos Ayres, Entre Rios,\r\nCorrientes, and Santa Fé, entered into a federal compact, to which all\r\nthe other provinces at subsequent periods became parties. The union was\r\na voluntary alliance. No general constitution was promulgated, and the\r\nadhesion of the several members was left to be secured by the resources\r\nof the person who might obtain the direction of affairs. This Argentine\r\nConfederation, like the republic which it had succeeded, soon fell into\r\na state of anarchy, and it was not till the election of General Rosas as\r\ngovernor or captain-general, with almost absolute power, in 1836, that\r\neven temporary quiet was secured. By this arrangement the provincial\r\ngovernment of Buenos Ayres was invested with extraordinary powers, and\r\ntemporarily charged with the transaction of all matters appertaining to\r\nthe common interests of the confederation, and the carrying out of its\r\nbusiness with foreign nations. Rosas had previously served as governor\r\nand captain-general of Buenos Ayres for the usual term of three years,\r\nand had obtained unrivalled influence in that province, chiefly through\r\nhis military powers, as displayed against the Indians. His decision and\r\nenergy secured for awhile internal peace, and the provinces began to\r\nrecover from the effects of the long prevalent anarchy. But cruelty and\r\ndespotism marked his sway at home, and his ambition, which continually\r\nprompted him to endeavours to extend his power over the whole country\r\nwatered by the Plata and the Parana, led him into disputes with foreign\r\npowers: and these ultimately brought about his downfall. His commercial\r\npolicy had for its object to secure for Buenos Ayres the monopoly of the\r\ntrade of the Plata, his political policy to obtain a like territorial\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Francia, dictator of Paraguay, he refused to acknowledge\r\nthe independence of that power, insisting that it should join the\r\nArgentine Confederation, at the same time he refused to allow the\r\nnavigation of the Parana by vessels bound to Paraguay. Lopez, the new\r\ndictator of Paraguay, therefore entered into alliance with the Banda\r\nOriental, now called Uruguay, with which Rosas was at war. These powers\r\napplied for assistance to Brazil. The war was prolonged until the whole\r\ncountry on both sides of the Plata and the Parana was in a state of\r\nconfusion. On the earnest appeal of the merchants and others interested,\r\nGreat Britain volunteered her mediation, but it was rejected by Rosas,\r\nwho marched his troops within a few miles of Monte Video, which his\r\nfleet at the same time blockaded. The emperor of Brazil now interfered,\r\nand sent a special mission to request the interposition of the courts\r\nof London and Paris. The British and French governments in February\r\n1845, decided on sending plenipotentiaries to the Plata to offer their\r\nmediation, and to announce their intention to enforce a cessation of\r\nhostilities if needful, by an armed intervention. The offer was rejected\r\nby Rosas, but readily accepted by his opponents. The united fleet of\r\nEngland and France at once commenced operations by seizing the fleet of\r\nRosas which was blockading Monte Video, and the island of Martin Garcia\r\nwhich commands the entrances of the Parana and the Uruguay. The harbour\r\nof Buenos Ayres was at the same time declared under blockade, and the\r\ncombined fleet prepared to open the Parana, and to convoy as far as\r\nCorrientes any merchant vessels that might desire to ascend that river.\r\nRosas on his part made hasty preparations to intercept the fleet by\r\nplanting batteries with parks of heavy artillery at Point Obligado; and\r\nplacing three strong chains across the river, supported by 24 vessels\r\nand 10 fire-ships. On the 19th of November 1845, the combined fleet,\r\nconsisting of eight sailing and three steam vessels, forced the passage\r\nwith trifling loss to itself, but entirely destroying the batteries, and\r\nconsiderably injuring the army of Rosas. On the return of the fleet, with\r\na convoy of 110 vessels, it was encountered at San Lorenzo by a very\r\npowerful battery which Rosas had erected in an admirable position, in the\r\nfull expectation of destroying a large number of the merchant vessels,\r\nand of crippling the naval force. The battery commanded the river, and\r\nwas difficult of attack by the steamers, but it was speedily silenced by\r\na rocket-brigade, which had been the previous night secretly landed on\r\na small island in the river. The combined fleet escaped with trifling\r\nloss, the rocket-brigade lost not a man; but four of the merchant vessels\r\nwhich, through unskilful pilotage, ran ashore, were burnt to prevent them\r\nfalling into the hands of Rosas. The loss to the Argentine army was very\r\ngreat. Again plenipotentiaries were sent out by the combined powers,\r\nbut Rosas refused to yield; and England withdrew from the blockade in\r\nJuly, 1848. It was however continued by France until January, 1849. On\r\nthe final withdrawal of the two great powers in 1850, Brazil determined\r\non active interference. The power of the Dictator, General Rosas,\r\nessentially despotic, and devoted to the maintenance of the supremacy\r\nof Buenos Ayres, had moreover become intolerable to the provinces which\r\ndesired a federal and equal union. Accordingly, towards the close of\r\n1850, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay entered into a treaty, to which\r\nCorrientes and Entre Rios, as represented by General Urquiza, became\r\nparties, by which they bound themselves to continue hostilities until\r\nthey had effected the deposition of Rosas, ‘whose power and tyranny’ they\r\ndeclared to be ‘incompatible with the peace and happiness of this part\r\nof the world.’ Early in the spring of 1851 a Brazilian fleet blockaded\r\nBuenos Ayres, and soon after an Argentine force commanded by Urquiza\r\ncrossed the Uruguay. The struggle was now virtually terminated. General\r\nOribe, who commanded the army of Rosas at Monte Video, made a show of\r\nresistance, but it was merely to gain time in order to complete his\r\narrangements with Urquiza, and he soon after capitulated. His soldiers\r\nfor the most part joined the army of Urquiza, who, at the head of a force\r\namounting it is said to 70,000 men, crossed into Buenos Ayres. A general\r\nengagement was fought on the plains of Moron, February 2, 1851, when the\r\narmy of Rosas was entirely defeated. Rosas, who had commanded in person,\r\nsucceeded in escaping from the field; and, in the dress of a peasant, he\r\nreached in safety the house of the British minister at Buenos Ayres. From\r\nthence, with his daughter, he proceeded on board H.M.’s steamer Locust,\r\nand on the 10th of February sailed in the Conflict steamer for England.\r\n\r\nBut the fall of the tyrant did not bring peace to the unhappy country.\r\nUrquiza, by the governors of the provinces assembled at San Nicolas, was\r\ninvested with the chief power, and appointed Provisional Director of the\r\nArgentine Confederation. The Chamber of Representatives of Buenos Ayres,\r\nhowever, declared against him, and protested against the proceedings of\r\nthe convention on the ground of the superior privileges of Buenos Ayres\r\nbeing menaced. Urquiza dissolved the Chamber, and insurrection broke out.\r\nCivil war, with all its aggravated evils, thereupon ensued. [See memoir\r\nof Urquiza.]\r\n\r\n[90] General José Maria Paz, minister of war, to whom I had the pleasure\r\nof a personal introduction, is a man of benevolent aspect and quick\r\naddress. He is a native of Buenos Ayres, and commenced his military\r\ncareer during the war of independence against Spain, in which he greatly\r\ndistinguished himself. In the campaign against Brazil, in 1825, he\r\ncommanded a brigade in the army of General Alviar, and added to the\r\nlaurels he had already won. When General Rosas seized upon the supreme\r\ngovernment of Buenos Ayres, General Paz was among those who opposed his\r\nusurpations; but in one of the engagements which followed he was taken\r\nprisoner, and kept a long time in confinement. Having at length obtained\r\nhis liberation, he commanded in the province of Corrientes, and defeated\r\nGeneral Echague at the battle of Cargaassu, in which he displayed the\r\ngreatest tact and ability. He commanded the garrison of Monte Video\r\nduring the memorable siege that city sustained from the forces of Rosas\r\nand Oribe, and is generally esteemed one of the ablest, and the most\r\nhonourable, truthful, and humane of the South American chiefs.\r\n\r\n[91] The English and foreign merchants residing in this city have\r\nestablished an English club-house, where a limited number of beds is\r\nprovided for bachelor members. This fine establishment is conducted\r\nby a committee of gentlemen, and contains every possible convenience,\r\nincluding a reading and news-room, as well as one for billiards; and, in\r\nfact, economy, comfort, and every facility of commercial intercourse,\r\nhave been consulted in all its arrangements. The foreign population of\r\nthis city includes a great number of shopkeepers, who form quite a little\r\nParis of elegant shops. Hatmakers, tailors, _coiffeurs_, _modistes_,\r\nand bootmakers predominate amongst the French; merchants, storekeepers,\r\npublicans, and boarding-house keepers amongst the English; and amongst\r\nthe Italians, warehousemen and captains of small craft trading to the\r\ninland ports on the mighty Plata. The immigration of Irish to this\r\nplace must have been on a very extensive scale, since all the hotel\r\nand boarding-houses, which are invariably European, have them in their\r\nemploy. They are also to be found in great numbers on the farms in the\r\nneighbourhood of the capital, which are held by Englishmen, and which\r\nsupply the city regularly with butter, eggs, and milk. The difficulty in\r\nfinding a washerwoman is indescribable, and would scarcely be credited.\r\nI had to send my servant in all directions before he could find one, and\r\nthen I discovered that I could enlist her in my service only on these\r\nconditions—first, that I should await her leisure, and next that I should\r\npay at the rate of three or four royals for each article!—_Bonelli._\r\n\r\n[92] The remarks made in reference to the description of trade carried\r\non with Monte Video may be considered as applicable in a great degree to\r\nBuenos Ayres. The following is the latest published official statement\r\nof the imports into the United Kingdom from the Oriental Republic in\r\n1851:—untanned hides, 10,247 cwts.; seal-skins, 12,008; tallow, 8,664\r\ncwts. In the same year the imports from the Argentine Republic were as\r\nfollows:—untanned hides, 261,653; lamb skins, 55,744; nutria skins,\r\n7,417; tallow, 135,856 cwts.; wool, 853,194 lbs.; unwrought copper,\r\n127 cwts.; cotton goods, 90_l._ value; India silk handkerchiefs, 432\r\npieces; brandy, 18 galls.; Spanish wines, 56 galls.; French ditto, 19\r\ngalls.; tobacco, 18 lbs. Buenos Ayres is the great source of our supply\r\nof hides, and the quantity of tallow imported thence is only exceeded\r\nby the supplies we obtain from Russia and our Australian colonies. The\r\nlatter source being now closed by war, and likely to be so as long as the\r\nEastern difficulty continues, our trade with the Plate in that respect\r\nbecomes of course proportionably important.\r\n\r\n[93] In reference to the correspondence between England and the River\r\nPlate, Buenos Ayres had long enjoyed considerable advantage over the\r\nUruguay; but both are now on the same footing in this respect. One great\r\nreason of the little interchange of correspondence between Great Britain\r\nand Monte Video has been the high rate of postage; but such cause is now\r\nremoved by a Treasury warrant, (dated February 24th, 1854,) directing\r\nthat on every letter not exceeding half an ounce in weight, posted in or\r\naddressed to any part of the republic of Uruguay, to or from the British\r\nislands and colonies, or transmitted from Uruguay to any foreign country,\r\nthrough England, there shall be charged 1_s._ If the letter exceeds half\r\nan ounce in weight, the postage is 2_s._; exceeding one ounce, 4_s._;\r\nexceeding two ounces, 6_s._; exceeding three ounces, 8_s._; and for every\r\nounce above four ounces, two additional rates of postage. Fractions above\r\nfour ounces to be charged as an additional ounce. Books and magazines to\r\npay the following rates:—not exceeding half a pound in weight, 6_d._;\r\nabove that weight, 1_s._ per pound, and all fractions charged as an\r\nadditional pound. The postage must be prepaid in stamps, and the packets\r\nmust be open at the ends or sides, contain printed matter only, and not\r\nexceed twenty-four inches in length, breadth, or depth. British and\r\nUruguayan newspapers may be sent direct to and from the United Kingdom\r\nand the Uruguay at the rate of 1_d._ each.\r\n\r\n[94] Our present diplomatic relations with the Disunited Provinces of\r\nthe Plata are of a peculiarly embarrassing and uncertain kind, owing\r\nto Urquiza being the ostensible head of the Confederation, though not\r\nof its most important province, Buenos Ayres. This anomalous state of\r\nthings long occasioned proceedings on the part of our representative\r\nthere, Captain R. Gore, R.N., that have naturally and almost unavoidably\r\nproduced some strong opposition and animadversion. Into the justness\r\nof these strictures it is not the business of the author to inquire;\r\nand, accordingly, he contents himself with supplying some few data of\r\nthe antecedents of the functionaries about to be enumerated. First,\r\nthe gallant gentleman just named, whose salary as consul-general is\r\n1600_l._, with the usual 1_l._ per day as chargé d’affaires. He is\r\nfourth brother of the Earl of Arran, and sat for the borough of New Ross\r\nin 1841 and 1847, when he declared himself ‘a cordial supporter of the\r\nMelbourne ministry,’ and an ‘advocate for free trade and the abolition\r\nof monopolies.’ He was appointed chargé d’affaires and consul-general\r\nin the Uruguay in 1846, and transferred to Buenos Ayres in 1851. Our\r\nBuenos Ayrean consul, whose salary, I believe, is 600_l._, is Mr. M. T.\r\nHood, who was employed for some years in the consulate-general at Monte\r\nVideo, appointed vice-consul there in 1841, acting consul-general there\r\nin 1846, and consul-general at Buenos Ayres in 1847. Our Buenos Ayrean\r\nvice-consul is Mr. T. Parish, to whom I shall have to express a sense\r\nof my obligations in a subsequent chapter. As regards the diplomatic\r\nrepresentation in this country of the Argentine Confederation, like the\r\nUruguay, and for much the same reason, it is confined merely to the\r\nconsul-general in London, Mr. George F. Dixon, Great Winchester-street,\r\nCity, the minister, Don Manuel Moreno, having for some considerable time\r\nleft England, where he had resided for many years during the supremacy\r\nof Rosas. The consuls and vice-consuls for the Argentine Confederation\r\nare Liverpool, Mr. Hugh C. Smith; Dover, Mr. S. M. Latham; Falmouth, Mr.\r\nAlfred Fox; Plymouth, Mr. J. Luscombe; and Glasgow, Mr. George Young.\r\n\r\n[95] A present probably from the English admiral of that name.\r\n\r\n[96] Speaking of the descent of the river, at a terrific pace, by the\r\nAlecto, Commander M’Kinnon, in his work ‘Steam Warfare on the Parana,’ to\r\nwhich reference has already been made, says:—There was only one person\r\nin South America who had either the nerve, knowledge, or ability to do\r\nit. It is natural to suppose that this person must have been a native of\r\nthe country, brought up on the river, and who had spent a long and active\r\nlife in getting such a thorough and precise knowledge. With pride do I\r\nsay it, this was not the case. The pilot was a brother officer, Captain\r\nB. J. Sullivan, who coolly stood on the paddle-box, and conned the vessel\r\nby a motion of his hand to the quarter-master. The whole of the river, up\r\nto Corrientes, is now surveyed by the above-mentioned officer, and better\r\nknown, by his means, in London, than at Rosas’ capital, Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n[97] The author on whom we have so frequently drawn for facts and\r\nillustrations, seems to attach greater moment to Corrientes, speaking\r\nof which he says, ‘There is more of a military authority combined with\r\nusual duties of a Captain of the Port in South America than is exercised\r\nby our Harbour Master, giving him some of the powers of a commandant.\r\nThe existence of regularly organized ports of entry for foreign vessels\r\nso far up the river (and there are others much higher up the Parana and\r\nParaguay) is not generally known. It has been the not unnatural, but\r\ninjurious, policy of the government of Buenos Ayres (Rosas) to seek to\r\nmonopolise the trade of the states of La Plata, and to prevent direct\r\nintercourse between the other maritime, or rather fluvial, provinces and\r\nforeign countries. Europeans have been in the habit of looking on Buenos\r\nAyres and Monte Video as the sole ports fitted for foreign commerce in\r\nthe states of La Plata, whereas there is no doubt that the best ports are\r\nin the river Parana itself, which affords excellent positions for depôts\r\nof produce, and for loading or discharging vessels. Many such ports\r\nexist on the banks, not only of the Parana, but of the rivers Uruguay\r\nand Paraguay. In the Parana there is deep water, generally from five to\r\ntwenty, and sometimes forty, fathoms, with good anchorage. The current\r\nruns three or four knots, often more, when floods increase the large body\r\nof water coming down from the river Paraguay and the numerous smaller\r\nrivers which empty themselves into the Parana from various quarters, and\r\nare swollen by the melting snow of the Andes. The soil about Corrientes\r\nis sandy: trees thrive, but there is more brushwood than timber. The\r\ninhabitants, having hitherto had but little intercourse with the rest of\r\nthe world, are naturally ignorant respecting Europe and its usages. Many\r\nof them know but little Spanish, using the Indian dialect, the ‘Guarani,’\r\nwhich prevails more or less throughout all this part of the interior of\r\nSouth America, including Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil. Of their little\r\nknowledge of things considered as the everyday comforts or necessaries\r\nof life in other countries, an eye-witness related a somewhat amusing\r\nproof. ‘An old Scotchman, who had been settled at Corrientes for the\r\ngreater part of his life, begged some coal from a British war-steamer\r\non her way up. His sole object in making the request was to be enabled\r\nto vindicate his reputation for veracity. It seems that he had often\r\ntold them that in England they had a kind of black stone that could be\r\nused as fuel, an assertion which was scouted as absurd and incredible,\r\nand he was considered as a Scotch Munchausen. He obtained the coal,\r\nhowever, and on the day fixed for the experiment half the town assembled,\r\nand, seated in a large circle, with their cigarritos in their mouths,\r\nwatched the smoke arising from the coal with silent incredulity. It\r\ndid not readily ignite, so the Dons began to shrug their shoulders and\r\nintimate their contempt for the whole affair; but when the fire blazed\r\nup, a total change came over them, and it was highly amusing to witness\r\nthe enthusiastic delight they evinced, shouting energetically, vivaing,\r\n&c.’ He adds, speaking of the Corrientines, ‘As a race, the men of this\r\ncountry seem much finer in stature and appearance than the women, who\r\nare generally small, fair, and delicate, and it is said that further\r\nin the interior and in Paraguay they are still more fair and northern\r\nlooking.’ Some travellers assert that what they call their religion is\r\noften little else than superstition, and that their morality is far from\r\nstrict, but this may be a false impression, adopted on slight grounds. In\r\ndress they are perfectly innocent of any superfluity, for which the great\r\nheat is a valid reason. But whatever are their shortcomings resulting\r\nfrom their isolated position, they are most hospitable and kind towards\r\nstrangers. ‘Travelling through the country one is well received at every\r\nhouse one rides up to; refreshment is always promptly offered, especially\r\nwater melons, which are particularly grateful in these climates. Payment\r\nwhen offered is almost invariably declined, and never demanded.’ In\r\nconsequence of the gradual filling up of the Parana by alluvial deposits\r\ntowards the Delta at its mouth, the navigation is much better higher up\r\nin the river than where it spreads into many small channels, emptying\r\nthemselves into the upper part of the River Plate; still a vessel\r\ndrawing sixteen or seventeen feet of water can go over all the passes\r\nwhen the river is moderately high; although during the prevalence of\r\ncertain winds from the north and west there is less water, and near the\r\nisland of Martin Garcia generally not more on the banks than fourteen\r\nfeet. Thus from Colonia to the Bajada, and further up to the pass of San\r\nJuan, without any extraordinary rise in the water, a large vessel can\r\nascend. From San Juan to Corrientes there is only a depth of thirteen\r\nfeet on the worst passes, and about the same depth may be had all the\r\nway to Assumption, watching opportunity. There are neither ‘snags’ nor\r\n‘sawyers’ [trunks of trees carried down by the current and fixed in the\r\nbottom, very dangerous in the Mississippi and other great rivers of\r\nNorth America, where they are known by these names], rocks, nor other\r\nobstructions, but steamers may go at full speed up or down by keeping the\r\nright channel. In the broad parts the stream runs at the rate of about\r\nthree, and in the narrow channels, four knots, or even more.’\r\n\r\n[98] I have since ascertained that not only did Mr. Hopkins and his\r\nparty arrive safely at Assumption, but that the vessel had returned to\r\nBuenos Ayres, and was going up again—a proof how easily the river can\r\nbe navigated. Mr. Hopkins was received with great cordiality by General\r\nLopez, and in return for the present of an American carriage, had given\r\nto him a large quantity of maté, with a grant of valuable land on the\r\nbanks of the river, near Assumption. He has been appointed, I hear,\r\nUnited States consul to Paraguay, and thus infinitely increased his means\r\nof effecting the results I confidently venture to anticipate at his hands.\r\n\r\n[99] The description of this magnificent and important river, by the\r\nauthors of ‘Letters from Paraguay,’ is too accurate and graphic to be\r\nomitted here, viz.:—The Paraná, having its source in the southern part\r\nof the Brazilian province of Goyaz, flows down from latitude 81 degrees\r\nsouth, still increased, as it runs, by numerous tributary springs. It\r\nis uninterrupted in its course by any obstacle to navigation, except\r\nby that formidable one, called the Salto Grande, (the Great Waterfall,\r\n_literally_, the Great Leap,) which in latitude 24 degrees, with a noise\r\nand tumult, heard many miles off, dashes its foaming mass of water over\r\nrocks, precipices, and chasms, of the most stupendous character. Resuming\r\nafter this its placid course, the wide and glassy Paraná, richly wooded\r\non both sides, and navigable by small vessels, pours down its salubrious\r\nwaters impregnated with sarsaparilla, till, at Corrientes, it forms its\r\njunction with the River Paraguay. From that point the two rivers joined,\r\ngo under the name of the one river, Paraná, the latter being, sometimes,\r\nthough erroneously, below this, considered the parent stream. The Paraná\r\ndischarges itself into the River Plate, by several mouths; by that of\r\nthe Paraná Guazú, at which point the waters of the Uruguay also fall\r\nin: of the Paraná Miní, lower down; and of the Paraná de las Palmas,\r\nstill near to Buenos Ayres. Thus formed, the Rio de la Plata pours its\r\naccumulated waters into the Atlantic; and although its mouth at the two\r\nopposite capes of Santa Maria and San Antonio is one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles wide, it does no more than correspond to the grandeur of the inland\r\nnavigation. From its source, in Matto Grosso, latitude 14 degrees south,\r\ntill its confluence with the Paraná at Corrientes, the River Paraguay has\r\nalready run a course of 1,200 miles; from Corrientes to Buenos Ayres,\r\nthe distance measured by both these streams under the one name of the\r\nParaná is 740; while from Buenos Ayres to Cape St. Antonio and Maria,\r\nthe combined waters of the Paraguay, Paraná, and Uruguay, united under\r\nthe one name of River Plate, run a farther distance of 200; making a\r\ntotal course of 2,150 miles, including the windings, which are often of\r\na very sweeping kind. Of this immense tract of water, fifteen hundred\r\nmiles are navigable by vessels drawing ten feet. The river abounds\r\nwith fish from its mouth to its source. The pexerey (king’s fish), the\r\ndorado, mullet, pacū (a sort of turbot), and many others, are found in\r\nit; its banks are for the most part richly studded with wood; its various\r\nislands are adorned with beautiful shrubs, evergreens, creepers, &c.;\r\nthe woods abound with game, and the adjacent country teems with cattle.\r\nThe waters are highly salubrious; the soil all along the banks of the\r\nriver, with the exception of the Great Chaco, is rich and fertile in the\r\nhighest degree. But notwithstanding all these advantages—notwithstanding\r\nthat the country has been for three hundred years in the possession of\r\na civilized European nation—after I had galloped two hundred and eighty\r\nleagues, I did not see above four or five small towns. Not more than a\r\nlike number of vessels were to be descried on my route, while at every\r\nfifteen miles distance a miserable hut, with its half-dozen inhabitants,\r\nwas alone interposed to relieve the monotony of the scene. The secret of\r\nall the silence, solitude, and abandonment of Nature to herself, which I\r\nsaw and lamented, is of course to be traced to the inadequate means which\r\nhave hitherto been used to provide even a semblance of the population\r\nnecessary to cover a country of such vast fertility and extent.\r\n\r\n[100] Mr. McCann is in error in stating the population of this town at\r\n8,000; and his general description of it would apply more to Rosario,\r\nprobably owing to some error in his notes afterwards, when describing the\r\ntwo towns.\r\n\r\n[101] ‘I will mention a few of the uses to which I have seen hides\r\napplied. The hammocks in which the people sleep were hides cut, like a\r\npuzzle, to spread out as so much net-work, neat, cool, and pleasant.\r\nThe milk from cows was collected and emptied into a hide spread out on\r\nsticks in the shape of a large bucket or tub, capable of holding from\r\nsixteen to twenty gallons. The houses and carts were covered with hides;\r\na hide-spout conveyed water off roofs. The tanpits were hides spread out\r\nlike the milk tub before mentioned, containing other hides under tanning\r\nprocess. Everything connected with horse furniture was supplied by hides.\r\nThe beams and supports of houses were lashed by hide thongs. The doors\r\nand windows, and, frequently, the very walls, were hides laced together;\r\nin short, everything almost was hides.’—_Mackinnon._\r\n\r\n[102] Rosario is most favourably situated for carrying on a large trade,\r\nwhich promises soon to locate itself here. Already there is an English\r\nbranch establishment here, and a resident English consul has been\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\n[103] The capital of the province of Corrientes, of which our sketch is\r\ntaken from the deck of a man-of-war, is not a large place. Its population\r\nhas been variously estimated at 3,000, 6,000, and 8,000 inhabitants.\r\nThis difference is partly accounted for by the fluctuations incident to\r\nthe military system by which they have too long been oppressed. In fact,\r\nsubjection to martial law has hitherto been, not the exceptional, but the\r\nnormal state of these countries. A traveller visiting one of these towns\r\nwhile the greater part of its male inhabitants are absent on military\r\nservice as volunteers, would have a very different impression as to the\r\nnumber of its population from that which he would receive during a time\r\nof peace, and in the commercial and busy season. Moreover, a great many\r\nof the wives and children of these men follow, as best they may, the\r\nmarch of the troops, so that whole districts are thus nearly depopulated\r\nby these frequent drains of their inhabitants. The ‘Gauchos,’ as the\r\ncountry people are called, are naturally a good-natured, hardy, and\r\ncourageous race. The demoralization and recklessness consequent on their\r\nbeing forcibly taken from useful and peaceful occupations to swell the\r\nranks of some ambitious ‘caudillo’ or chieftain, have of course produced\r\nmuch evil, inuring them to scenes of violence, bloodshed, and injustice.\r\nIt is true that they are called out and armed for the loudly-proclaimed\r\npurpose of defending ‘la libertad, la patria,’ &c., and appeals to the\r\nfeelings of independence, honour, virtue, and all the high-sounding words\r\nof the sonorous language of Spain are employed by those who want their\r\nservices. Here, as too generally in Spanish America, their feelings of\r\npatriotism have been so frequently invoked either to defend or attack\r\nsome individual or party, that it is only surprising their characters\r\nare not more perverted, and that the moral devastation should not keep\r\npace with that which has so long physically blighted these naturally\r\nfine provinces. The resources of these states have been wasted in order\r\nto maintain a military force much too large in proportion to their\r\npopulation, and it has been employed either in aggression on neighbouring\r\ncountries, or for the intimidation or coercion of the provinces\r\nthemselves, to support the personal policy of the executive. Thus their\r\ngreat capabilities of production have not been developed, and industrial\r\nimprovement has been completely checked. The evils of such a system are\r\neven more injuriously felt in these vast and thinly inhabited regions\r\nthan they might be in countries differently circumstanced.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of Corrientes consists chiefly in vast herds of cattle, sheep,\r\nand horses. The pasturage of the province is remarkably fine: its exports\r\nare hides, tallow, wool, hair, and some agricultural produce. The trade\r\nwhich might arise with the countries in the interior, through which these\r\nmighty rivers flow, were the navigation open, is beyond calculation, and\r\nits profits would soon enable the States of La Plata to pay with ease\r\ntheir foreign and domestic creditors, and to raise funds for internal\r\nimprovements. During the few months that the navigation of the Parana\r\nwas kept open in 1845-6, two convoys, (under the admirable arrangements\r\nadopted by the distinguished officer who commanded H.M. squadron in the\r\nParana, Commodore Sir Charles Hotham), one consisting of upwards of one\r\nhundred vessels, laden with produce, the other of more than seventy, came\r\ndown that river and the Paraguay with very little loss or damage, after\r\nhaving exchanged the cargoes of European or North American merchandise\r\nthat they brought up for the goods with which the different depôts at\r\nCorrientes and other places were overflowing, to the value of some\r\nmillions of hard dollars. It is true that an accumulation of produce\r\nat the ports of the river then existed, caused by the interdiction\r\nof the navigation by the governing power of one of the banks of the\r\nriver. But as it is the manifest interest of the different states whose\r\nnatural outlet is by the River Plate and its confluents,—the Parana\r\nand Uruguay,—that internal navigation should be free, or placed, for\r\ninstance, on a similar footing to that of the Rhine, it is to be hoped\r\nthat before very long the governments most interested in this question,\r\nthose of La Plata especially, will awaken to a sense of the vast interest\r\nthey have in opening these great channels of inter-communication to the\r\ncommerce of the world.\r\n\r\n[104] Le Paraguay; son passe, son present, et son avenir; par un\r\nEtranger, qui a vecu longtemps dans ce pays, ouvrage publie a\r\nRio-Janeiro, et reproduit en France; par General Oriental Pacheco-y-Obes.\r\n\r\n[105] Mr. G. W. Drabble, a gentleman who proceeded some time ago from\r\nManchester on a visit to the River Plate, determined to devote some of\r\nhis time and attention to ascertaining the capability of the Argentine\r\nterritory and the Banda Oriental for growing cotton. Lord Clarendon\r\nhaving been written to by the Manchester Commercial Association to ask\r\nhis assistance for Mr. Drabble in carrying out this intention, replied,\r\nin a letter, dated the 1st of March, that he would have particular\r\npleasure in complying with the request, and that his Lordship ‘had\r\nrecommended Mr. Drabble to the kind offices of Captain Gore (Her\r\nMajesty’s Chargé d’Affaires at Buenos Ayres) and Mr. Hunt (the British\r\nActing Consul-General), and had instructed them to afford to Mr. Drabble\r\nevery facility and assistance in their power in furtherance of his\r\nobject, which was one in which Her Majesty’s Government take great\r\ninterest.’ A letter was afterwards received from the Consul-General at\r\nMonte Video, 4th of June, stating that he would be very glad indeed to\r\ngive Mr. Drabble every assistance in his power. The following letter to\r\nMr. J. A. Turner, president of the Manchester Commercial Association,\r\ndetails the result of Mr. Drabble’s investigations:—‘Buenos Ayres, Oct.\r\n1. The unsettled state of politics that prevailed on my arrival here\r\nprevented my being able to avail myself of the offers of assistance\r\nby Mr. Gore and Mr. Hunt, nor was a journey to the interior provinces\r\nthen practicable. From Paraguay, fortunately, General Lopez, son of\r\nthe President of that country, was passing through this city, on a\r\nvisit to Europe; which enabled me to be presented to him by Sir Charles\r\nHotham, who has rendered me every assistance, and given me most valuable\r\ninformation as to that country. That territory appearing to hold forth\r\nmore prospect of success in the cultivation of cotton, I have sent up\r\na gentleman possessing the requisite talent, so that he may be enabled\r\nto furnish an accurate report as to the facilities that may be there\r\nfound. Even here, however, I would observe that much more attention is\r\nbeing attached to the country of Paraguay, as a rich field of enterprise;\r\nand, as a pioneer to what we hope may be continued efforts, a steamer\r\nstarted from this port yesterday to that destination, conveying a company\r\nrecently arrived from the United States’ said to be well supported,\r\nconsisting of several directors, and conveying with them machines for the\r\ncultivation and cleaning of cotton, tobacco, sugar, and rice; sawmills,\r\nfor making available for export the valuable wood that there so abounds,\r\nand other machines suitable for the development of its resources. If\r\nthey are once enabled to establish a footing there, and, especially, if\r\nthe project of steam navigation up our interior rivers is accomplished,\r\ngreat results may attend these primary efforts. Some of the interior\r\nprovinces of this confederation have been long said to be most suitable\r\nfor the cultivation of cotton, and a sample, pronounced to be of very\r\nfine quality, from one of them (Tucuman), was last year exhibited in\r\nManchester. I have forwarded, per steamer, another example from the\r\nneighbouring province of Catamarca, the lands of which are reported as\r\nbeing capable of producing a much superior article to any other of these\r\nStates. I consider, however, that a great difficulty will exist in the\r\ndevelopment of this cultivation, in any of these interior provinces, from\r\nthe long land carriage required to bring it to an exterior market. The\r\ncost of the best qualities there, as plucked, say with seed, is 7rs. to\r\n8rs. per arroba; if cleaned up there, as it must be to give the least\r\nhope of successful competition, it is calculated that the yield would\r\ngive about 25 per cent. of gross, thus placing the cost of an arroba,\r\nor 25 lbs., at an average of 30rs.; expenses of cleaning would be 2rs.;\r\ncarriage to Buenos Ayres, per arroba, 6rs.; total, 38rs.; which, taken\r\nat to-day’s rate of exchange, would net per lb. 8⅕d. In Catamarca the\r\ncotton tree has been cultivated regularly, but, attention never having\r\nbeen paid to it as an article of export, the production has never\r\nincreased. It is a perennial plant, sown in spring, and yielding the\r\nsame year. It grows about four feet to five feet high. In the winter it\r\nis cut down, but the following spring it shoots up for another year’s\r\nyield. No great care is paid to it till the time of gathering the pod,\r\nwhen it is regularly plucked. The Paraguay and Corrientes plants are of\r\nthe same class. The quality of the Corrientes cotton has so far been\r\nmuch inferior. It is, however, in the same latitude, and the soil is\r\nrepresented as being equally fertile, and from its geological position,\r\nthat province would seem to be the most preferable. The great drawback\r\nto the extension of this cultivation will be the want of labour. The\r\npopulation of Catamarca is not more than 40,000; that of Tucuman may\r\nbe estimated at 50,000. But even so, there are so many other articles\r\nof production of great value, and requiring little labour, as tobacco,\r\nsugar, &c., that it will be difficult to obtain sufficient hands for the\r\nplucking and cleaning, unless expressly imported. The requirements of\r\nthe native population are few, and their ambition soon satisfied. It is,\r\ntherefore, almost impossible to get them to labour for more than their\r\nactual wants. That these countries, however, present many facilities and\r\nadvantages for the extension of this cultivation cannot be doubted; nor\r\nthat capital, properly laid out, would, with care and energy, give every\r\nprospect of ample profit. But the commencement of this, as of all other\r\nundertakings, requires to be followed up with the greatest energy, and\r\nunder the personal superintendence of a practical and interested party.\r\nAlthough Mr. Drabble estimates that only 25 per cent. of clean cotton\r\nwould be obtained from the seed, some gentlemen in Manchester, who have\r\nhad much acquaintance with the subject, are of opinion that, with such\r\nfine growths as the samples already sent home from the district, the net\r\nproduce of clean cotton would be much more likely to be one-third of the\r\ngross weight than one-fourth, and, consequently, the cost at which cotton\r\ncould be supplied would be proportionately reduced.\r\n\r\n[106] The chief provisions are the following:—British subjects are free\r\nto navigate the banks of the rivers of Paraguay. British traders may\r\nsettle and carry on commerce in any of their towns, instead of being\r\nrestricted to Assumption, as hitherto. Finally, they may marry the\r\ndaughters of the country—a privilege from which they have until now\r\nbeen debarred. Similar treaties have been made with France, the United\r\nStates, and Sardinia. This treaty (said an eminent ‘Economical’ authority\r\nat the time it was made known in England,) will help to forward the\r\ndesigns of Bolivia to promote the free navigation of the rivers that\r\nrun from her territory into the Plate. Could that navigation be opened,\r\nit would be something like spreading the advantages conferred by the\r\nMississippi on North America over South America. The Plate is formed by\r\nthe junction of the Parana and the Uruguay. From the Plate to Assumption,\r\nthe Parana, with its branch the Paraguay, is navigable for 800 miles\r\nin the dry season by vessels drawing six feet of water, and in the\r\nrainy season by vessels drawing twice as much. Beyond that 800 miles,\r\nit is navigable as a canal for 600 miles, almost to its sources in the\r\nmountains of Brazil, not far from one of the streams navigable into the\r\nheart of Bolivia upwards of 1,000 miles from the Atlantic. The Uruguay\r\nis navigable for 300 miles from its junction with the Parana, and there\r\nthe navigation is stopped by a ledge of rocks which does not affect the\r\nlevel of the stream. Were this impediment removed—and the governments of\r\nBrazil and Buenos Ayres are bound by treaty to remove it—the river would\r\nbe navigable for 300 miles further. Thus together there is an interior\r\nnavigation from the Plate of at least 1,600 miles, and probably when the\r\ncountry shall be fully explored for many hundred more miles, opening up\r\nfor the use of the closely-pressed people of Europe some of the finest\r\ncountries of the globe. The great empire of the south, extending through\r\nmore than thirty degrees of latitude, and in its widest part through\r\nthirty degrees of longitude, with a population of about 5,000,000, and a\r\nportion of them slaves, is increasing in people and wealth much faster\r\nthan the countries on the Plate. It is extending its trade year by year,\r\nand may in the end absorb and incorporate the neighbouring republics;\r\nbut it is yet far from that consummation. Unless, therefore, some more\r\nEuropean life be infused into the countries on the Plate, unless spare\r\nhands from England, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany, each of which\r\nhas already supplied some of the scattered population on the Plate, go\r\nthither, and bring those countries more into contact with Europe, they\r\nare likely to remain only half tenanted for ages.\r\n\r\n[107] When Rosas, in his protest, announced that he was preparing great\r\nmilitary and naval armaments, with a view of invading and incorporating\r\nher in the Argentine Confederation, Paraguay speedily raised an effective\r\narmy of more than 30,000 men; and calculating that force at the moderate\r\nrate of two per cent. on the entire population, the result is above a\r\nmillion, which, as already stated, is more than double the population\r\nof the Argentine provinces and the State of Uruguay united—a fact which\r\nexplains why it is that Paraguay imports more than all the interior\r\nprovinces of the Confederation, including the province, though not the\r\nport, of Buenos Ayres itself.\r\n\r\nThe town of _Conception_ has been resuscitated from its decay by the\r\ngovernment founding the town of St. Salvador, on the Paraguay, and\r\ncovering all the fords by a line of small fortified posts. New works and\r\nbranches of industry have been commenced, and quarries of calcareous\r\nstone, an article which Paraguay, before Francia’s time, imported, are\r\nnow worked. The _Encyclopædia Britannica_, now being published, puts down\r\nthe population of Assumption, the capital, at 12,000, which is certainly\r\nconsiderably under the real number. With an activity and zeal which would\r\ndo honour to governments better furnished with resources and auxiliary\r\nmeans, the consular government undertook to open new roads, by cutting\r\nthrough the forests to an extraordinary extent, in order to facilitate\r\ntransit and the trade to the exterior. The road which was opened across\r\nthe mountain called _Caro_ is twelve leagues in length and fifty feet\r\nbroad. That which traverses Mount _Palomares_ is thirteen leagues long,\r\nand of the same breadth as the first; and Mount _Caagazu_ has been cut\r\nby a road six leagues long and thirty-six feet wide. There is also now\r\napproaching completion a road which is passable for carriages from\r\n_Villa-Rica_ to the bank of the Parana. Bridges have been constructed\r\nover several water-courses and dangerous ravines, and where the\r\nbreadth of the rivers has been too great, commodious ferries have been\r\nestablished at the expense of the government. In the district of Rosario,\r\nwhere there are many grazing estates, the proprietors were frequently\r\nexposed to excessive droughts, which occasioned the dispersion, mixture,\r\nand loss of the herds. The government has had a canal opened from five\r\nto six leagues long, and which, serving as a reservoir to many brooks,\r\nwill retain water even in the most terrible droughts. A similar route has\r\nbeen carried out in the department of _San Estanislao_. The government\r\nhas resolved on founding other new towns, and has overcome the obstacles\r\nopposed to the development of others already existing, such as _Villa\r\nFranca_, which, situated at the bottom of a plain, suffered much in the\r\nrainy season. It opened drains for the stagnant waters, and the soil has\r\nbeen much improved.\r\n\r\nThere is one arrangement which does the greatest honour to the liberalism\r\nand equity of the consular government. We may, properly speaking, say\r\nthat there are no slaves in Paraguay; the number is not quite certain,\r\nbut, from the statement of a recent traveller, there would not appear to\r\nbe more than one thousand in the whole of the territory of the Republic.\r\nThe consular government, in order to put a stop to slavery in a natural\r\nmanner, although it be on so small a scale, has declared every child\r\nborn of slaves to be free, and has prohibited, by a decree, all fresh\r\nimportations.\r\n\r\n[108] The climate, which has so much influence on the prosperity of a\r\ncountry, is salubrious, equable, and agreeable. Although tropical, this\r\nregion is exempt from the fevers which commit such ravages at Havana and\r\nNew Orleans, and from the earthquakes and hurricanes of the West Indies\r\nand other tropical countries. All epidemics are unknown: in fact, the\r\nclimate of Paraguay is proverbially salubrious, one proof of which is,\r\nthat there is an unusual proportionate number of octogenarians, and even\r\ncentenarians. The British and French war-steamers, Locust and Flambart,\r\nwere lately there for upwards of two months, during the hottest season,\r\nwithout a single case of serious illness occurring on board. Such, too,\r\nwas the case when a French steamer was sent up by the British and French\r\nMinisters in 1846. Though the heat is great, it is infinitely more\r\nbearable than in most parts of the Brazils; while all experience goes to\r\nshow that Europeans become speedily acclimated.\r\n\r\n[109] Prolific as are so many portions of South America, there is no one\r\narea of anything like the same magnitude to be compared for a moment with\r\nParaguay. Here are cultivated, with an easy success to which the wants\r\nof the inhabitants are the only limit, cotton, sugar, indigo, cochineal,\r\nand the finest tobacco in the world; dyes of great value abound, as also\r\nvarious wild plants of the hemp kind, capable of being converted to the\r\ngreatest utility; resinous trees, amongst them several producing the\r\nIndian-rubber and gutta-percha gums; copaiba, rhubarb, and medicinal\r\nplants of equal virtue, its sarsaparilla being superior to all others,\r\nand its bark having still as high a repute among pharmaceutical savants\r\nas when first introduced thence into Europe by the Jesuits towards the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century. Plantations of coffee have lately\r\nbeen commenced, and answer excellently. Fruits and grain embrace nearly\r\nall that are indigenous to the temperate and the torrid zone; and the\r\ncattle may be multiplied to an indefinite extent if advantage be taken\r\nfor that purpose of the illimitable pasturage—an important consideration\r\njust now, bearing in mind the sources of our supply of hides and tallow,\r\nwhether from the North of Europe or South America itself. Direct European\r\nintercourse, by means of the Malmesbury treaty, not only promises to be\r\nproductive of the utmost good to Paraguay proper, but, through Paraguay,\r\nto the remotest provinces of the Confederation, and beyond, to the\r\nspurs of the Andes. The Vermejo, already twice explored, puts Paraguay\r\nin communication with the vast provinces of Salta, Jujui, and Tucuman;\r\nand if, as there is good reason to believe, the Pilcomayo is navigable\r\nconsiderably above Paraguay, her commerce would go straight to the\r\nheart of Bolivia. By the river Paraguay itself ships of 200 tons can\r\nascend to Cuiaba, the capital of the Brazilian province of Matto-Grosso;\r\nwhile the interior of Paraguay is interlaced all over with navigable\r\nstreams emptying themselves into the great fluvial artery after which\r\nthe province is named—thus facilitating the transport, in the manner of\r\nthe Chinese canals, of its produce to the markets of Assumption and the\r\nthriving town of Pilar.\r\n\r\n[110] The natives of Paraguay are docile to their superiors, vigorous,\r\ninured to hardship, and intelligent; at the same time that they are\r\nsober, phlegmatic, and not likely to be carried away by enthusiasm. They\r\ndo not appear to be endowed with that impetuous and exalted valour which\r\nseeks to confront danger and death; they would, therefore, not be well\r\nadapted for offensive warfare. But they possess, without any doubt, that\r\nsevere and immovable intrepidity which sees danger and death without\r\nbeing shaken by them, an invaluable quality for defensive war, and which,\r\ndeveloped by exercise and arms, may in its turn serve for the attack.\r\nThe Paraguayan is firm and tenacious in his projects: in whatever he\r\nundertakes, if he meets with resistance, he grows obstinate, and dies\r\nrather than yield or desist. He is insensible to stimulants, and the\r\nseduction of immoderate desires. His family, his valley, his country, the\r\ngovernment which he idolizes, are all the world to him. He is, however,\r\nnotwithstanding his apparent phlegm, most susceptible in whatsoever\r\nhe considers to be foreign domination, superiority, or influence, and\r\nattributes to contempt the most indifferent act which is repugnant to\r\nhis habits, his customs, or his interests. He does not, however, evince\r\nhis resentment by words or cries—he is too concentrated for that; but\r\nstill he allows no opportunity to escape of expressing by monosyllables,\r\ngestures, or actions, more energetic than words, what is passing at the\r\nbottom of his heart.\r\n\r\n[111] The first consul, Don Carlos Antonio Lopez, is a rich landed\r\nproprietor. He received in his youth, at the College of Assumption,\r\nsuch education as during the first years of this century could be met\r\nwith in the American colleges. When his studies were concluded, he gave\r\nlessons in theology at the same college, and was installed in a chair of,\r\nwhat at that time was termed, philosophy. He afterwards devoted himself\r\nparticularly to the study of jurisprudence, and to the profession of\r\nan advocate, and exercised it, according to general report, with zeal,\r\nimpartiality, and disinterestedness, which acquired him credit, friends,\r\nand a select number of clients. When it became dangerous, under the\r\ntyranny of the Dictator, to exercise a profession so independent as that\r\nof advocate, M. Lopez retired to his estate, 40 leagues from Assumption,\r\nand gave himself up entirely to agriculture, and to the perusal of the\r\nfew books which he had been able to procure. He very rarely went to the\r\ncapital, and then only for a few days. His retired life, the description\r\nof seclusion to which he had condemned himself, providentially saved him\r\nfrom the distrust and terrors of the Dictator, and from imprisonment or\r\ndeath, which were their usual consequences. M. Lopez has never quitted\r\nhis country, and previously he had not taken the smallest share in public\r\naffairs. He was unable to make acquaintance with the excellent works\r\npublished on numerous branches of public administration and political\r\neconomy, or to obtain the least intelligence of the events which had\r\noccurred in Europe and America during the preceding twenty years, for the\r\nDictator persecuted, with more rigour than the Inquisition itself, men\r\nof learning and their books, and neither one nor the other had been able\r\nto penetrate Paraguay. Nevertheless, the acts and writings of M. Lopez\r\nhave shown that he was no stranger to sound doctrines of administration,\r\nand that he had meditated in his retreat on the situation of his country,\r\nits necessities, the evils it suffered, and their causes, as well as on\r\nthe remedies which it would be possible to apply to them. Such qualities\r\nwould naturally acquire for him an ascendancy and preponderance in\r\nthe management of affairs; and, thus acquired, he has exercised them\r\ndiscreetly and vigorously.\r\n\r\nThe second consul, Don Mariano Roque Alonzo, was a soldier who reckoned\r\nmany years service in barracks and garrisons. He commanded a corps or\r\nbattalion of the troops which occupied the capital, when his companions\r\nin arms appointed him Commandant-General in the interval between the\r\ndeath of the Dictator and the assembly of Congress. During this short\r\nperiod he maintained public order, and protected the tranquillity of the\r\ncitizens with zeal and moderation. Like a man of good sense and honour,\r\nand of docile character, he at once acknowledged the superiority of his\r\ncolleague, which of itself is a merit, and always deferred to it, in\r\nwhich he rendered a great service to his country.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, Congress again assembled, and elected M. Lopez president, a\r\nrenewal of confidence which his excellent conduct in the interval of\r\nyears that had elapsed since his first election fully justified; and the\r\nsame may, of course, be said of his subsequent re-election.\r\n\r\n[112] In 1849, when the army of Paraguay gave signs of life by occupying\r\na part of the province of Corrientes, to protect the introduction of\r\na large convoy of military equipments purchased from Brazil by the\r\npresident, General Rosas, who had laughed at the army of Paraguay, found\r\nnothing to oppose to it when it appeared but a defensive attitude. At\r\nthe present time that army, from its acquirements and discipline, is the\r\nenvy of the armies of the different nations of South America. A treaty\r\nof alliance, offensive and defensive, entered into somewhat later with\r\nthe Brazils, and ratified by the Emperor, revealed the existence of\r\nParaguay to the political world, since this treaty had for its basis the\r\npreservation of the nationality of the Oriental State.\r\n\r\nThe Dictator had a great number of men under arms; but there was no army\r\nor any military organization of any kind, and the soldiery was allowed\r\nto oppress the other classes. On the other hand, it happened with the\r\nmilitary service, as with all other branches of the administration,\r\nthat there were no other laws nor rules than the capricious will of\r\nthe Dictator: there was no law to fix the term of service; the private\r\nsoldiers had already served a long time, and had a right to their\r\ndischarge. Detachment and garrison duty, even in the remotest parts of\r\nthe frontiers, was performed without any turn of service or regularity.\r\nThe troops remained there sometimes as long as fifteen years without\r\nbeing relieved, and without receiving any other assistance or pay than a\r\nmeagre ration of meat. The consular government gradually allowed these\r\nofficers and soldiers to retire, and replaced them with 3,000 men,\r\nobtained by recruiting. The officers who had served for long periods had\r\nsmall pensions awarded them, and the longest term for the most distant\r\ndetachments was reduced to three years.\r\n\r\n[113] The Dictator died in 1840, at the age of 85, of apoplexy, leaving\r\nthe country in the most dangerous crisis in which a nation can find\r\nitself, that of complete ‘acephalousness’ (being without a head).\r\nExclusively occupied with himself, the Dictator had neither foreseen\r\nnor prepared anything for cases so easy to anticipate as illness or\r\ndeath. Nevertheless, there were no parties in Paraguay; neither violent\r\nreactions nor disorders have been seen there, which has, with reason,\r\nsurprised all the world. Nor did the country return to the subjection of\r\nBuenos Ayres, which, however, is sufficiently explained by the character\r\nof the inhabitants. The moment the Dictator was dead, his ‘actuario,’\r\n(the person through whom all business with Francia was transacted,)\r\nwho doubtless desired to follow out his system, and succeed him under\r\nthe name and shadow of some military chiefs, suggested to the four\r\ncommandants of four of the ‘corps d’armée’ which occupied the capital\r\nthe idea of self-electing themselves into authority and forming a\r\ngovernment. The advice pleased these officers; they added an alcalde to\r\ntheir number, elected the president, and composed a governmental junta,\r\nof which the ‘actuario’ made himself secretary. But neither the junta\r\nnor the secretary knew how to, or were able to, maintain their footing.\r\nThe junta itself had been installed but a few days when it decreed\r\nthe arrest of its own secretary, who knowing well, doubtless, what he\r\ndeserved, hung himself in prison. The other military chiefs soon made\r\nthose who formed the junta imperatively feel the necessity of convoking a\r\ncongress, and of doing so by an authority not confined to theirs. After\r\nsome hesitation, the natural consequence of the acephalous state of the\r\ncountry, these military chiefs named a ‘Commandant General of Arms,’\r\nwithout any administrative authority, and with no other attribute than\r\nthat of convoking a congress within a given time, and of watching in the\r\ninterval over the maintenance of public order. This new personage did not\r\nfail to execute the orders he had received, and convoked a congress in\r\nMarch, 1841, six months after the death of the Dictator. This congress,\r\ncomposed of 500 members, elected directly by universal suffrage, hastened\r\nto satisfy the first necessity of Paraguay, that of an authority to take\r\nthe cause of the country and its administration in hand; and the void, so\r\nfull of danger to the public weal, was filled up. A government, composed\r\nof two consuls, was immediately appointed, and no other obligation was\r\nimposed on it than that of ‘maintaining and defending the independence\r\nand integrity of the Republic,’ and which it was to swear before being\r\nformally inducted into office. Finally, the congress had the wisdom to\r\nconsider its task to be thus terminated, and it added nothing to the\r\nduties of the consuls thus elected than a recommendation to encourage\r\npublic education, relying for the rest on the conscience and knowledge of\r\nthese magistrates.\r\n\r\nA consular government, composed of two individuals, with identical\r\nrights and attributes, but who unavoidably differed in character, ideas,\r\nand education, was eminently defective, and carried within itself the\r\ngerms of great inconveniences and dangers to the State. But, happily, it\r\nproduced none, thanks to the deference and docility of one magistrate,\r\nthe prudence and superiority of the other, and the short duration of\r\ntheir term of office, which was but for three years.\r\n\r\nDuring the Dictatorship education had been altogether abandoned; the\r\nestablishments devoted to instruction had been closed, and their\r\nresources diverted to other purposes. Lopez established primary schools,\r\nand laid the foundation for a college; and two Jesuits arriving about\r\n1844, one of them took charge of a school for mathematics; but they left\r\nthe country in 1846.\r\n\r\nReligion and public worship, which exercise so much influence on the\r\nmorality of a people, were suffering much from the want of spiritual\r\nadvisers. At the death of the Dictator there were only fifty priests in\r\nParaguay, all old, and several verging on decrepitude. Many churches\r\nin the country, even in populous parishes, were closed for want of\r\npastors. The consular government hastened to remedy so great an evil: it\r\ncommenced negotiations with the Holy See, and presented two priests for\r\nconsecration as bishops; one, as diocesan, and the other as coadjutor.\r\nIn the meantime it pressed the head of the bishopric to extend to those\r\nparishes which were destitute of pastors the jurisdiction of the nearest\r\nrectors.\r\n\r\n[114] The revenue of Paraguay is derived principally from the duties\r\nlevied on goods imported and exported, (the former of which ought to be\r\nconsiderably modified, and the latter reduced to almost nothing,) stamped\r\npaper, shopkeepers’ licences, the tithe of the produce of the soil, and\r\nthe ‘half-annaata’ tax (half the value of the waste lands granted by\r\ngovernment); but we are, as yet, ignorant of the details, no statistical\r\ndocuments being yet published in the Republic.\r\n\r\nThere is also, however, another and not inconsiderable branch of revenue,\r\nviz.: the monopoly enjoyed by government of the sale of ‘maté,’ or\r\nParaguay tea. It purchases this herb as prepared in the forests of the\r\nstate, and when well packed and in good condition, at a given price,\r\nand disposes of it to the merchants for exportation, as well as to the\r\nconsumers, at the rate of seven rials per arrobe.\r\n\r\nWhat will at a later period constitute incalculable wealth for Paraguay\r\nare its lands and forests: it will derive a very considerable revenue\r\nfrom them. More than half of the surface of the territory is public\r\nproperty, comprising immense forests of timber, of the most varied and\r\nvalued kinds, within reach of navigable rivers. These lands at present\r\nare of little value; but they will speedily acquire a much greater, for\r\nthe president has adopted a very wise system of disposing of them, viz.,\r\ngranting them to applicants at a perpetual ground-rent of five per cent.\r\non the amount at which they are valued by competent persons. This plan\r\nwill greatly facilitate their sale.\r\n\r\n[115] The consular government opened the world to men who had been\r\nseparated from it for thirty years, through the complete isolation in\r\nwhich Francia kept the country; internal communications and relations,\r\nwhich were limited to the most indispensable acts of material life, were\r\nrelieved from the dangers and obstacles which tended to restrict and\r\nparalyse them. Access to _Stapua_ was permitted to every one who desired\r\nto betake himself to that market, and navigation to all who desired\r\nto export the produce of the country. The idea and the hope of seeing\r\ncommerce spring up anew, alone sufficed to reanimate the spirits and\r\nawaken the minds of men long benumbed under an oppressive yoke.\r\n\r\nThis renewal of hope and labour was, in a great measure, due to the\r\nencouragement given to the consular government. There were families\r\nfallen into a state of poverty bordering on utter destitution; the\r\ngovernment came to their assistance by causing to be distributed amongst\r\nthem more than three thousand head of cattle; and in goods, instruments,\r\nand tools, to the value of more than twenty-two thousand dollars. They\r\nwere thus set up again, and enabled to resume their labours.\r\n\r\n[116] The administration of justice at Paraguay is as simple as it\r\nnaturally ought to be with a people whose civil relations are few\r\nin number and little complicated; but the increase of property and\r\nthe complication of relations will require tribunals more learnedly\r\norganized. What the consular government did sufficed to create legal\r\norder, and put an end to the reign of force and arbitrary sway, which\r\nthe Dictator had substituted for the rule of justice; but in criminal\r\ntrials an innovation was introduced, which, although imperfect, will\r\nbe perfected in time, when education has made greater advance, and\r\nwhich will incontestably serve as a basis for the institution of the\r\njury, the source of so many benefits. It was ordained, that in order to\r\npronounce criminal sentences, the judge should associate with himself\r\ntwo individuals, drawn by lot out of a list previously made. The\r\nconfiscations under the Dictator, the enormous fines which he imposed,\r\nand which were equivalent to confiscation, had reduced a great number of\r\nfamilies to misery; the consular government restored such property as yet\r\nexisted, and adjudged some indemnities for those which had been disposed\r\nof; the rural estates which had been applied to the public service, and\r\nwhich it would not have been convenient to withdraw, were purchased from\r\nthe former and legitimate possessors. This striking act of equity alone\r\ncompleted a revolution in the social and administrative order of Paraguay.\r\n\r\n[117] The government which succeeded Francia’s despotism, and of\r\nwhich M. Lopez was the head, did not allow the least sign of blame or\r\ndisapprobation of the Dictator’s conduct to transpire. It would indeed\r\nhave been useless, and have set a bad example, to abuse his memory and\r\nawaken a remembrance of irreparable evils.\r\n\r\nFrom the death of the Dictator to the installation of the consulate, all\r\npersecution, as well as the sanguinary executions and fusillades, so\r\ncommon during Francia’s tyrannical sway, had ceased. But the political\r\nprisoners, to the number of more than 600, had not been released, with\r\nfour or five exceptions, and suffered the same evils in the dungeons and\r\ncasemates. When the consuls, however, were elected, they released all\r\nthese political prisoners, and sent them to their families. It was a\r\nsignificant act. It showed to all that the reign of cruelty and terror\r\nhad given place in the counsels of the government to principles of\r\nmildness and sound policy. It was natural that the agents and employés of\r\nthe Dictator should have inspired resentments and profound hatred by the\r\npitiless way in which they had executed the orders they had received; and\r\ncomplaints did begin to be heard against some of the officials for the\r\nabuse they had made of their authority.\r\n\r\n[118] From the crowd of rank and fashion, I had a good opportunity of\r\nobserving the costumes. The limited intercourse between this part of\r\nSouth America and other lands has, of late years, degenerated to almost\r\nentire seclusion. It would, therefore, be unreasonable to expect the\r\ninhabitants could procure dresses of equal beauty to those of more\r\nfavoured nations. But the country manufactures of which the garments were\r\nprincipally formed, though comparatively coarse, were very elaborately\r\nworked by hand, and, consequently, infinitely dearer than female attire\r\nof the same quality in Europe. For example, a small coarse towel, or\r\nnapkin, embroidered or worked all round by hand, was worth a doubloon, or\r\nounce of gold, equal, nearly, to four pounds sterling.—_Robertson._\r\n\r\n[119] The Pacific Steam Navigation Company under contract with Her\r\nMajesty’s Government for the conveyance of the mails semi-monthly between\r\nPanama and Valparaiso, in connection with the Royal Mail Steam Packet\r\nCompany, have now on the West Coast of South America the following\r\nsteam-ships, viz:—\r\n\r\n    Lima        1,100 tons and 400 horse power\r\n    Bogota      1,100  ”    ”  400     ”\r\n    Santiago    1,000  ”    ”  400     ”\r\n    Bolivia       800  ”    ”  280     ”\r\n    New Granada   600  ”    ”  200     ”\r\n    Valdivia      700  ”    ”  180     ”\r\n    Osprey        300  ”    ”  100     ”\r\n\r\nThe distance steamed annually is about 200,000 miles, and the number of\r\nintermediate ports touched at on the coasts of New Granada, Equador,\r\nPeru, Bolivia, and Chili, between the termini, is about 13. The company\r\nhave also a contract with the Government of Chili for the conveyance of\r\nmails monthly between Valparaiso and Chili, as mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n[120] Though I have quoted in the appendix a good deal of data referring\r\nto the Falklands, I cannot mention those islands in the text of this\r\nvolume for the last time without adducing in evidence of their extreme\r\neligibility, in connection with Australian commerce, the annexed letter\r\nfrom the very competent authority whose signature it bears. It is\r\naddressed to my fellow-townsman, Mr. Jeffrey, of Compton House, who,\r\nafter a very able speech in Liverpool in promotion of the decimal system,\r\nin illustration of which he quoted the principle of circle sailing, put\r\nsome questions, at the instance of a friend, to Mr. Towson, in respect\r\nto the Falklands, and received in reply the following remarks, whose\r\naccuracy has been so strikingly corroborated by Captain Matthews, of the\r\nGreat Britain, whose letter will be found in another page:—\r\n\r\n    Local Marine Board, Liverpool, 31st December, 1853: My dear\r\n    Sir,—The Falkland Islands are the best possible coaling\r\n    stations for steamers homeward bound from Australia. The Marco\r\n    Polo and Eagle sighted them on their celebrated homeward\r\n    passages; consequently they lay in the best track. They are\r\n    also situated about midway. It is true that less than one-third\r\n    of the coals is required between Australia and the Falkland\r\n    Islands, which will be consumed during the homeward voyage.\r\n    But, under all circumstances, it is desirable to coal here,\r\n    as it will enable the ship to start from Australia in good\r\n    sailing trim, instead of being overburdened with coals on that\r\n    part of the voyage in which steam is of but little value. A\r\n    half-cargo of coals at Australia, and a full cargo of coals at\r\n    the Falkland Islands, is what I have recommended for steamers,\r\n    in cases in which I have been consulted. Although I think it\r\n    possible that steamers will at length make the voyage without\r\n    coaling at any intermediate station; I still think that it is\r\n    less likely that this will be adopted on the homeward passage\r\n    than on the outward, because, on the first half of the voyage\r\n    out, coals will be required most, but homeward on the second\r\n    half, so that, as a coaling station, the Falkland Islands\r\n    stand preëminent. Also for steamers bound to the West coast of\r\n    America, North and South, the Falkland Islands will be the best\r\n    coaling station both out and home.—I am, my dear Sir, yours\r\n    truly,—JOHN THOMAS TOWSON.—_To James R. Jeffery, Esq._\r\n\r\n[121] In proof of this we may here cite the letter of Captain Matthews,\r\nof the Great Britain, as already alluded to:—\r\n\r\n    Liverpool, 1st April, 1854.\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen,—I have much pleasure in complying with your\r\n    request that I should lay before you a brief statement of the\r\n    advantages afforded by the Falkland Islands as a place of call\r\n    for ocean steamers. Captain Grant, of the Sea Bird, in the very\r\n    interesting letter which he wrote to you from Stanley relative\r\n    to the deposit of coal for the Great Britain, has already made\r\n    you aware of the excellence of that harbour, and of its easy\r\n    access. I am able, from my own experience, to confirm, in every\r\n    particular, Capt. Grant’s remarks.\r\n\r\n    The government charts are exceedingly correct; the land as\r\n    you approach it is made out without any difficulty, and we\r\n    saw Pembroke Point and its beacon (now to be superseded by a\r\n    lighthouse) at the distance of seven miles. The harbour itself\r\n    is like a large dock, secure from all winds, and with an\r\n    entrance sufficiently wide for a good smart sailing vessel to\r\n    beat through with ease. All the dangerous points are distinctly\r\n    marked by the kelp or sea-weed. The anchorage is excellent,\r\n    varying from four to five fathoms at low water, so that the\r\n    Great Britain is everywhere in perfect safety; and even were\r\n    she to touch the ground, she would not receive any injury, as\r\n    the bottom is all soft mud.\r\n\r\n    The facility for watering ships is good: a reservoir, holding\r\n    about 200 tons of water, communicates by means of pipes with\r\n    the end of a jetty, where, even when the tide is out, there\r\n    is always about three feet of water, which is sufficient for\r\n    a flat boat to float off ten tons at a time. The casks in\r\n    the boat are filled by fastening a short hose to the pipes,\r\n    and thus one ship can be watered as rapidly as if she were\r\n    in Liverpool. The Governor, of whose courteous and obliging\r\n    conduct I cannot speak too highly, promised that, should\r\n    Stanley become a port of call for steamers, a floating tank\r\n    shall be built, so that water could be alongside the ship\r\n    immediately on her arrival, and pumped into the tanks or casks,\r\n    as the case may be.\r\n\r\n    There are considerable herds of cattle on the islands, and when\r\n    put up to feed (as was the case with the Great Britain) their\r\n    beef is very good; vegetables of the more ordinary kind, such\r\n    as potatoes, cabbages, and turnips, can be had when in season.\r\n    Ship chandlery and grocery stores can also be purchased to a\r\n    limited extent. Labour is scarce, as the population of Stanley\r\n    (the only settlement) is only about 400. But every year as the\r\n    islands become better known this want will no doubt be less\r\n    felt.\r\n\r\n    I should add that the hulk for coaling the Great Britain was\r\n    placed in the most convenient situation. I experienced not\r\n    the slightest difficulty in this or any other matter during\r\n    this detention of four days in these islands, owing chiefly to\r\n    the good management of Mr. Dale, the agent for the Falkland\r\n    Islands’ Company, who was immediately in attendance on arrival\r\n    of the ship, and continued until the hulk with coals was\r\n    alongside. The zealous attention and kindness of this gentleman\r\n    to my passengers and myself whenever his services were required\r\n    will always be remembered by us.\r\n\r\n    I remain, gentlemen,\r\n\r\n    Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) BARNARD R. MATTHEWS.\r\n\r\n    Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n[122] Speaking of this functionary, I am reminded that I have left the\r\ndiplomatic and consular corps of some few of the states of South America\r\nunenumerated. The following brief particulars, however, will be found to\r\nembrace all that is necessary to be known on such head, in respect to the\r\nstates in any way coming within the scope of the foregoing pages:—\r\n\r\nVenezuela has at present no diplomatic representative in this country.\r\nThe consuls are Mr. J. Milligan, London; Mr. A. Fox, Falmouth; Mr. W.\r\nWatson, Liverpool; and Mr. J. Ferguson, Belfast. The British consuls are\r\nthe Hon. R. Bingham, who was attached to the mission at Naples in 1818,\r\nto the embassy at Paris in 1823, to the mission at Madrid in 1825, to\r\nthe embassy at Lisbon in 1828, appointed paid attaché at Madrid in 1829,\r\nsecretary of legation at Munich in 1831, at Turin in 1839, and chargé\r\nd’affaires and consul-general in Venezuela in 1852, salary 1200_l._;\r\nMr. J. Riddel, La Guyra, 200_l._; Mr. J. McWhirter, acting consul in\r\nVenezuela from 1835 to 1837, and from 1839 to 1843, appointed vice-consul\r\nat Puerto Cabello in 1843, 200_l._; Mr. E. T. Harrison, Maracaibo,\r\n200_l._; and Mr. K. Mathison, unpaid consul at Angostura from 1841 to\r\n1845, appointed vice-consul at Bolivar in 1847, salary 200_l._\r\n\r\nBolivia is diplomatically represented in England by General Andrea Santa\r\nCruz, minister plenipotentiary. The Bolivian consuls are Baron Scholey,\r\nconsul-general, whose office is 1, London-street, Fenchurch-street,\r\nLondon; Mr. H. Morris, Dover; Mr. T. W. Fox, Plymouth; and Mr. R. Dunkin,\r\nLlanelly and Swansea. The British chargé d’affaires and consul-general\r\nin Bolivia is Mr. J. A. Lloyd, formerly aide-de-camp to a West India\r\ngovernor, who permitted him to proceed to Columbia, where he was officer\r\nof engineers to General Bolivar, in 1827 was sent to the isthmus of\r\nDarien, and laid down the line of railway, was afterwards scientifically\r\nemployed by the Admiralty and the Royal Society, in 1831 was appointed\r\nsurveyor-general and civil engineer in chief at Mauritius, in 1850 a\r\nspecial commissioner for the Exhibition of 1851, and at the close of the\r\nlatter year to his present post at Sucre, where his salary is 1200_l._\r\n\r\nThe consuls of Equador in this country are Mr. W. P. Robertson,\r\nconsul-general, 5, Barge-yard, Bucklersbury, London; Mr. E. Mocatta,\r\nLiverpool; Mr. G. Dunlop, Southampton; and Mr. M. R. Ryan, Limerick. The\r\nBritish consul at Guayaquil is Mr. W. Cope, whose salary is 1000_l._\r\n\r\n[123] A writer in the city article of the _Times_ of February 17th,\r\ndating from the Plate, shortly after the occurrence, says:—\r\n\r\n    The Lusitania, belonging to the Liverpool Screw Steam Company,\r\n    made the passage from England in 35 days. The Argentine\r\n    paddle-wheel steamboat, belonging to the same company, when\r\n    leaving the harbour about a fortnight since for Buenos Ayres,\r\n    struck upon a reef of rocks running from the Cerro. All efforts\r\n    to get her off proving ineffectual, she was abandoned, and\r\n    sold on account of the underwriters for 4,600 duros, but is\r\n    likely to prove a dead loss to the purchasers, as the engines\r\n    cannot be abstracted. The loss of this vessel is not only a\r\n    serious one to the company, but to the public in this part of\r\n    the world. By her punctuality and speed she had just succeeded\r\n    in driving away all competitors, and would have paid very\r\n    handsomely. When replacing her, it is believed, the company\r\n    would do well to send a larger vessel, but of no deeper draught\r\n    of water.",
