D.C.L. OF DURHAM UNIVERSITY\r\nAUTHOR OF 'ITALY AND HER INVADERS'\r\n\r\nLONDON: HENRY FROWDE\r\nAMEN CORNER, PATERNOSTER ROW, E.C.\r\n\r\n1886.\r\n\r\n[_All rights reserved_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abstract of the 'Variae' of Cassiodorus which I now offer to the\r\nnotice of historical students, belongs to that class of work which\r\nProfessor Max Müller happily characterised when he entitled two of his\r\nvolumes 'Chips from a German Workshop.' In the course of my\r\npreparatory reading, before beginning the composition of the third and\r\nfourth volumes of my book on 'Italy and Her Invaders,' I found it\r\nnecessary to study very attentively the 'Various Letters' of\r\nCassiodorus, our best and often our only source of information, for\r\nthe character and the policy of the great Theodoric. The notes which\r\nin this process were accumulated upon my hands might, I hoped, be\r\nwoven into one long chapter on the Ostrogothic government of Italy.\r\nWhen the materials were collected, however, they were so manifold, so\r\nperplexing, so full of curious and unexpected detail, that I quite\r\ndespaired of ever succeeding in the attempt to group them into one\r\nharmonious and artistic picture. Frankly, therefore, renouncing a task\r\nwhich is beyond my powers, I offer my notes for the perusal of the few\r\nreaders who may care to study the mutual reactions of the Roman and\r\nthe Teutonic mind upon one another in the Sixth Century, and I ask\r\nthese to accept the artist's assurance, 'The curtain is the picture.'\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that I only profess to give an abstract, not a full\r\ntranslation of the letters. There is so much repetition and such a\r\nlavish expenditure of words in the writings of Cassiodorus, that they\r\nlend themselves very readily to the work of the abbreviator. Of course\r\nthe longer letters generally admit of greater relative reduction in\r\nquantity than the shorter ones, but I think it may be said that on an\r\naverage the letters have lost at least half their bulk in my hands. On\r\nany important point the real student will of course refuse to accept\r\nmy condensed rendering, and will go straight to the fountain-head. I\r\nhope, however, that even students may occasionally derive the same\r\nkind of assistance from my labours which an astronomer derives from\r\nthe humble instrument called the 'finder' in a great observatory.\r\n\r\nA few important letters have been translated, to the best of my\r\nability, verbatim. In the not infrequent instances where I have been\r\nunable to extract any intelligible meaning, on grammatical principles,\r\nfrom the words of my author, I have put in the text the nearest\r\napproximation that I could discover to his meaning, and placed the\r\nunintelligible words in a note, hoping that my readers may be more\r\nfortunate in their interpretation than I have been.\r\n\r\nWith the usual ill-fortune of authors, just as my last sheet was\r\npassing through the press I received from Italy a number of the 'Atti\r\ne Memorie della R. Deputazione di Storia Patria per le Provincie di\r\nRomagna' (to which I am a subscriber), containing an elaborate and\r\nscholarlike article by S. Augusto Gaudenzi, entitled 'L'Opera di\r\nCassiodorio a Ravenna.' It is a satisfaction to me to see that in\r\nseveral instances S. Gaudenzi and I have reached practically the same\r\nconclusions; but I cannot but regret that his paper reached me too\r\nlate to prevent my benefiting from it more fully. A few of the more\r\nimportant points in which I think S. Gaudenzi throws useful light on\r\nour common subject are noticed in the 'Additions and Corrections,' to\r\nwhich I beg to draw my readers' attention.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps be allowed to add that the Index, the preparation of\r\nwhich has cost me no small amount of labour, ought (if I have not\r\naltogether failed in my endeavour) to be of considerable assistance to\r\nthe historical enquirer. For instance, if he will refer to the heading\r\n_Sajo_, and consult the passages there referred to, he will find, I\r\nbelieve, all that Cassiodorus has to tell us concerning these\r\ninteresting personages, the Sajones, who were almost the only\r\nrepresentatives of the intrusive Gothic element in the fabric of Roman\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nFrom textual criticism and the discussion of the authority of\r\ndifferent MSS. I have felt myself entirely relieved by the\r\nannouncement of the forthcoming critical edition of the 'Variae,'\r\nunder the superintendence of Professor Meyer. The task to which an\r\neminent German scholar has devoted the labour of several years, it\r\nwould be quite useless for me, without appliances and without special\r\ntraining, to approach as an amateur; and I therefore simply help\r\nmyself to the best reading that I can get from the printed texts,\r\nleaving to Professor Meyer to say which reading possesses the highest\r\ndiplomatic authority. Simply as a a matter of curiosity I have spent\r\nsome days in examining the MSS. of Cassiodorus in the British Museum.\r\nIf they are at all fair representatives (which probably they are not)\r\nof the MSS. which Professor Meyer has consulted, I should say that\r\nthough the titles of the letters have often got into great confusion\r\nthrough careless and unintelligent copying, the main text is not\r\nlikely to show any very important variations from the editions of\r\nNivellius and Garet.\r\n\r\nI now commend this volume with all its imperfections to the indulgent\r\ncriticism of the small class of historical students who alone will\r\ncare to peruse it. The man of affairs and the practical politician\r\nwill of course not condescend to turn over its pages; yet the anxious\r\nand for a time successful efforts of Theodoric and his Minister to\r\npreserve to Italy the blessings of _Civilitas_ might perhaps teach\r\nuseful lessons even to a modern statesman.\r\n\r\nTHOS. HODGKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Note as to the MSS. at the British Museum may save a\r\nfuture enquirer a little trouble.\r\n\r\n(1) 10 B. XV. is a MS. about 11 inches by 8, written in a fine bold\r\nhand, and fills 157 folios, of which 134 belong to the 'Variae' and 23\r\nto the 'Institutiones Divinarum Litterarum.' There are also two folios\r\nat the end which I have not deciphered. The MS. is assigned to the\r\nThirteenth Century. The title of the First Book is interesting,\r\nbecause it contains the description of Cassiodorus' official rank, 'Ex\r\nMagistri Officii,' which Mommsen seems to have looked for in the MSS.\r\nin vain. The MS. contains the first Three Books complete, but only 39\r\nletters of the Fourth. Letters 40-51 of the Fourth Book, and the whole\r\nof the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Books, are missing. It then goes on\r\nto the Eighth Book (which it calls the Fifth), but omits the first\r\nfive letters. The remaining 28 appear to be copied satisfactorily. The\r\nNinth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Books, which the transcriber calls\r\nthe Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth, seem to be on the whole\r\ncorrectly copied.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a certain degree of correspondence between the\r\nreadings of this MS. and those of the Leyden MS. of the Twelfth\r\nCentury (formerly at Fulda) which are described by Ludwig Tross in his\r\n'Symbolae Criticae' (Hammone, 1853).\r\n\r\n(2) 8 B. XIX. is a MS. also of the Thirteenth Century, in a smaller\r\nhand than the foregoing. The margins are very large, but the Codex\r\nmeasures only 6-3/4 inches by 4-1/4. The rubricated titles are of\r\nsomewhat later date than the body of the text. The initial letters are\r\nelaborately illuminated. This MS. contains, in a mutilated state and\r\nin a peculiar order, the books from the Eighth to the Twelfth. The\r\nfollowing is the order in which the books are placed:\r\n\r\n       IX. 8-25,   folios   1-14.\r\n        X.            \"    14-33.\r\n       XI.            \"    33-63.\r\n      XII.            \"    63-83.\r\n     VIII.            \"    83-126.\r\n       IX. 1-7,       \"   126-134.\r\n\r\nThe amanuensis, who has evidently been a thoroughly dishonest worker,\r\nconstantly omits whole letters, from which however he sometimes\r\nextracts a sentence or two, which he tacks on to the end of some\r\npreceding letter without regard to the sense. This process makes it\r\nexceedingly difficult to collate the MS. with the printed text. Owing\r\nto the Eighth Book being inserted after the Twelfth, it is erroneously\r\nlabelled on the back, 'Cassiodori Senatoris Epistolae, Lib. X-XIII.'\r\n\r\n(3) 10 B. IV. (also of the Thirteenth Century, and measuring 11 inches\r\nby 8) contains, in a tolerably complete state, the first Three Books\r\nof the 'Variae,' Book IV. 5-39, Book VIII. 1-12, and Books X-XII. The\r\norder, however, is transposed, Books IV. and VIII. coming after Book\r\nXII. These excerpts from Cassiodorus, which occupy folios 66 to 134 of\r\nthe MS., are preceded by some collections relative to the Civil and\r\nCanon Law. The letters which are copied seem to be carefully and\r\nconscientiously done.\r\n\r\nThese three MSS. are all in the King's Library.\r\n\r\nBesides these MSS. I have also glanced at No. 1,919 in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary at Oxford. Like those previously described it is, I believe,\r\nof the Thirteenth Century, and professes to contain the whole of the\r\n'Variae;' but the letters are in an exceedingly mutilated form. On an\r\naverage it seems to me that not more than one-third of each letter is\r\ncopied. In this manner the 'Variae' are compressed into the otherwise\r\nimpossible number of 33 folios (149-182).\r\n\r\nAll these MSS., even the best of them, give me the impression of being\r\ncopied by very unintelligent scribes, who had but little idea of the\r\nmeaning of the words which they were transcribing. In all, the\r\nsuperscription V.S. is expanded (wrongly, as I believe) into 'Viro\r\nSenatori;' for 'Praefecto Praetorio' we have the meaningless\r\n'Praeposito;' and the Agapitus who is addressed in the 6th, 32nd, and\r\n33rd letters of the First Book is turned, in defiance of chronology,\r\ninto a Pope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF

S. Gaudenzi remarks that the addresses of\r\nthe laws in the Code of Justinian forbid us to suppose that Heliodorus\r\nwas Praetorian Praefect for eighteen years. He thinks that most likely\r\nthe meaning of the words 'in illa republica nobis videntibus\r\npraefecturam bis novenis annis gessit eximie' is that twice in the\r\nspace of nine years Heliodorus filled the office of Praefect.\r\n\r\nP. 159, Letter 27 of Book I. The date of this letter is probably 509,\r\nas Importunus, who is therein mentioned as Consul, was Consul in that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nP. 160, Letter 29 of Book I. S. Gaudenzi points out that a letter has\r\nprobably dropped out here, as the title does not fit the contents of\r\nthe letter, which seems to have been addressed to a Sajo.\r\n\r\nIn the titles of I. 14, 26, 34, 35, and II. 5 and 9, for 'Praepositus'\r\nread 'Praetorian Praefect.' The contraction used by the early\r\namanuenses for Praefecto Praetorio has been misunderstood by their\r\nsuccessors, and consequently many MSS. read 'Praeposito,' and this\r\nreading has been followed by Nivellius. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that Garet is right in restoring 'Praefecto Praetorio.'\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have been misled by Garet's edition into quoting\r\nthe following letters as addressed _Viro Senatori_; I. 38; II. 23, 28,\r\n29, 35; III. 8, 13, 15, 16, 27, 32, 41; IV. 10, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20,\r\n21, 28; V. 21, 24. Here, too, the only MSS. that I have examined read\r\n'Viro Senatori;' but Nivellius preserves what is no doubt the earlier\r\nreading, 'V.S.,' which assuredly stands for 'Viro Spectabili.'\r\nPractically there is no great difference between the two readings, and\r\nthe remarks made by me on II. 29, 35, &c., as to Senators with Gothic\r\nnames may still stand; for as every Senator was (at least) a\r\nClarissimus, it is not likely that any person who reached the higher\r\ndignity of a Spectabilis was not also a Senator. (See pp. 90 and 91.)\r\n\r\nP. 181, Letter 19 of Book II.

He was a statesman of considerable\r\nsagacity and of unblemished honour, a well-read scholar, and a devout\r\nChristian; but he was apt to crouch before the possessors of power\r\nhowever unworthy, and in the whole of his long and eventful life we\r\nnever find him playing a part which can be called heroic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of Cassiodorus on the confines of the Ancient and\r\nthe Modern.]\r\n\r\nHis position, however, which was in more senses than one that of a\r\nborderer between two worlds, gives to the study of his writings an\r\nexceptional value. Born a few years after the overthrow of the Western\r\nEmpire, a Roman noble by his ancestry, a rhetorician-philosopher by\r\nhis training, he became what we should call the Prime Minister of the\r\nOstrogothic King Theodoric; he toiled with his master at the\r\nconstruction of the new state, which was to unite the vigour of\r\nGermany and the culture of Rome; for a generation he saw this edifice\r\nstand, and when it fell beneath the blows of Belisarius he retired,\r\nperhaps well-nigh broken-hearted, from the political arena. The\r\nwritings of such a man could hardly fail, at any rate they do not\r\nfail, to give us many interesting glimpses into the political life\r\nboth of the Romans and the Barbarians. It is true that they throw more\r\nlight backwards than forwards, that they teach us far more about the\r\nconstitution of the Roman Empire than they do about the Teutonic\r\ncustoms from whence in due time Feudalism was to be born. Still, they\r\ndo often illustrate these Teutonic usages; and when we remember that\r\nthe writer to whom after Tacitus we are most deeply indebted for our\r\nknowledge of Teutonic antiquity, Jordanes, professedly compiled his\r\nill-written pamphlet from the Twelve Books of the Gothic History of\r\nCassiodorus, we see that indirectly his contribution to the history of\r\nthe German factor in European civilisation is a most important one.\r\n\r\nThus then, as has been already said, Cassiodorus stood on the confines\r\nof two worlds, the Ancient and the Modern; indeed it is a noteworthy\r\nfact that the very word _modernus_ occurs for the first time with any\r\nfrequency in his writings. Or, if the ever-shifting boundary between\r\nAncient and Modern be drawn elsewhere than in the fifth and sixth\r\ncenturies, at any rate it is safe to say, that he stood on the\r\nboundary of two worlds, the Roman and the Teutonic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Also on the confines of Politics and Religion.]\r\n\r\nBut the statesman who, after spending thirty years at the Court of\r\nTheodoric and his daughter, spent thirty-three years more in the\r\nmonastery which he had himself erected at Squillace, was a borderer in\r\nanother sense than that already mentioned--a borderer between the two\r\nworlds of Politics and Religion; and in this capacity also, as the\r\ncontemporary, perhaps the friend, certainly the imitator, of St.\r\nBenedict, and in some respects the improver upon his method,\r\nCassiodorus largely helped to mould the destinies of mediaeval and\r\ntherefore of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to indicate the chief points in the life and\r\ncareer of Cassiodorus. Where, as is generally the case, our\r\ninformation comes from his own correspondence, I shall, to avoid\r\nrepetition, not do much more than refer the reader to the passage in\r\nthe following collection, where he will find the information given as\r\nnearly as may be in the words of the great Minister himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His ancestors.]\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of Cassiodorus for three generations, and their public\r\nemployments, are enumerated for us in the letters (Var. i. 3-4) which\r\nin the name of Theodoric he wrote on his father's elevation to the\r\nPatriciate. From these letters we learn that--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great grandfather.]\r\n\r\n(1) Cassiodorus, the writer's great grandfather, who held the rank of\r\nan Illustris, defended the shores of Sicily and Bruttii from the\r\nincursions of the Vandals. This was probably between 430 and 440, and,\r\nas we may suppose, towards the end of the life of this statesman, to\r\nwhom we may conjecturally assign a date from 390 to 460.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grandfather.]\r\n\r\n(2) His son and namesake, the grandfather of our Cassiodorus, was a\r\nTribune (a military rank nearly corresponding to our 'Colonel') and\r\nNotarius under Valentinian III. He enjoyed the friendship of the great\r\nAetius, and was sent with Carpilio the son of that statesman on an\r\nembassy to Attila, probably between the years 440 and 450. In this\r\nembassy, according to his grandson, he exerted an extraordinary\r\ninfluence over the mind of the Hunnish King. Soon after this he\r\nretired to his native Province of Bruttii, where he passed the\r\nremainder of his days. We may probably fix the limits of his life from\r\nabout 420 to 490.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Father.]\r\n\r\n(3) His son, the third Cassiodorus, our author's father, served under\r\nOdovacar (therefore between 476 and 492), as Comes Privatarum Rerum\r\nand Comes Sacrarum Largitionum. These two offices, one of which\r\nnominally involved the care of the domains of the Sovereign and the\r\nother the regulation of his private charities, were in fact the two\r\ngreat financial offices of the Empire and of the barbarian royalties\r\nwhich modelled their system upon it. Upon the fall of the throne of\r\nOdovacar, Cassiodorus transferred his services to Theodoric, at the\r\nbeginning of whose reign he acted as Governor (Consularis[1]) of\r\nSicily. In this capacity he showed much tact and skill, and thereby\r\nsucceeded in reconciling the somewhat suspicious and intractable\r\nSicilians to the rule of their Ostrogothic master. He next\r\nadministered (as Corrector[2]) his own native Province of 'Bruttii et\r\nLucania[3].' Either in the year 500 or soon after, he received from\r\nTheodoric the highest mark of his confidence that the Sovereign could\r\nbestow, being raised to the great place of Praetorian Praefect, which\r\nstill conferred a semi-regal splendour upon its holder, and which\r\npossibly under a Barbarian King may have involved yet more\r\nparticipation in the actual work of reigning than it had done under a\r\nRoman Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: We get these titles from the Notitia Occidentis I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: [See previous footnote.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: On the authority of a letter of Pope Gelasius, 'Philippo\r\net Cassiodoro,' Usener fixes this governorship of Bruttii between the\r\nyears 493 and 496 (p. 76).]\r\n\r\nThe Praefecture of this Cassiodorus probably lasted three or four\r\nyears, and at its close he received the high honour of the Patriciate.\r\nWe are not able to name the exact date of his retirement from office;\r\nbut the important point for us is, that while he still held this\r\nsplendid position his son was first introduced to public life. To that\r\nson's history we may now proceed, for we have no further information\r\nof importance as to the father's old age or death beyond the\r\nintimation (contained in Var. iii. 28) that Theodoric invited him,\r\napparently in vain, to leave his beloved Bruttii and return to the\r\nCourt of Ravenna.\r\n\r\nMAGNUS AURELIUS CASSIODORUS SENATOR was born at Scyllacium\r\n(_Squillace_) about the year 480. His name, his birthplace, and his\r\nyear of birth will each require a short notice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Name.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus, or Cassiodorius.]\r\n\r\n(1) _Name._ Magnus (not Marcus, as it has been sometimes incorrectly\r\nprinted) is the author's praenomen. Aurelius, the gentile name,\r\nconnects him with a large gens, of which Q. Aurelius Memmius Symmachus\r\nwas one of the most distinguished ornaments. As to the form of the\r\ncognomen there is a good deal of diversity of opinion, the majority of\r\nGerman scholars preferring Cassiodor_i_us to Cassiodorus. The argument\r\nin favour of the former spelling is derived from the fact that some of\r\nthe MSS. of his works (not apparently the majority) write the name\r\nwith the termination _rius_, and that while it is easy to understand\r\nhow from the genitive form _ri_ a nominative _rus_ might be wrongly\r\ninferred instead of the real nominative _rius_, it is not easy to see\r\nwhy the opposite mistake should be made, and _rius_ substituted for\r\nthe genuine _rus_.\r\n\r\nThe question will probably be decided one way or the other by the\r\ncritical edition of the 'Variae' which is to be published among the\r\n'Monumenta Germaniae Historica;' but in the meantime it may be\r\nremarked that the correct Greek form of the name as shown by\r\ninscriptions appears to be Cassiodo_rus_, and that in a poem of\r\nAlcuin's[4] occurs the line\r\n\r\n    'Cassiodorus item Chrysostomus atque Johannes,'\r\n\r\nshowing that the termination _rus_ was generally accepted as early as\r\nthe eighth century. It is therefore to be hoped that this is the form\r\nwhich may finally prevail.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: De Pontificibus et Sanctis Ecclesiae Eboracensis, p. 843\r\nof Migne's Second Volume of Alcuin's Works. I owe this quotation to\r\nAdolph Franz.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Senator.]\r\n\r\nSenator, it is clear, was part of the original name of Cassiodorus,\r\nand not a title acquired by sitting in the Roman Senate. It seems a\r\ncurious custom to give a title of this kind to an infant as part of\r\nhis name, but the well-known instance of Patricius (St. Patrick) shows\r\nthat this was sometimes done, and there are other instances\r\n(collected by Thorbecke, p. 34) of this very title Senator being used\r\nas a proper name.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from Jordanes (who calls the Gothic History of Cassiodorus\r\n'duodecem Senatoris volumina de origine actibusque Getarum[5]'), from\r\nPope Vigilius (who speaks of 'religiosum virum filium nostrum\r\nSenatorem[6]'), from the titles of the letters written by\r\nCassiodorus[7], and from his punning allusions to his own name and the\r\nlove to the Senate which it had prophetically expressed, that Senator\r\nwas a real name and not a title of honour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Preface to Getica (Mommsen's Edition, p. 53).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Epist. XIV. ad Rusticum et Sebastianum (Migne, p. 49).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Nearly all the letters in the XIth and XIIth Books of the\r\nVariae are headed 'Senator Praefectus Praetorio.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birthplace, Scyllacium.]\r\n\r\n(2) Scyllacium, the modern Squillace, was, according to Cassiodorus,\r\nthe first, either in age or in importance, of the cities of Bruttii, a\r\nProvince which corresponds pretty closely with the modern Calabria. It\r\nis situated at the head of the gulf to which it gives its name, on the\r\neastern side of Italy, and at the point where the peninsula is pinched\r\nin by the Tyrrhene and Ionian Seas to a width of only fifteen miles,\r\nthe narrowest dimensions to which it is anywhere reduced. The Apennine\r\nchain comes here within a distance of about five miles of the sea, and\r\nupon one of its lower dependencies Scyllacium was placed. The slight\r\npromontory in front of the town earned for it from the author of the\r\nAeneid the ominous name of 'Navifragum Scylaceum[8].' In the\r\ndescription which Cassiodorus himself gives of his birthplace (Var.\r\nxii. 15) we hear nothing of the danger to mariners which had attracted\r\nthe attention of Virgil, possibly a somewhat timid sailor. The name,\r\nhowever, given to the place by the Greek colonists who founded it,\r\n_Scylletium_, is thought by some to contain an allusion to dangers of\r\nthe coast similar to those which were typified by the barking dogs of\r\nthe not far distant Scylla.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8:\r\n\r\n        'Adtollit se diva Lacinia contra,\r\n    Caulonisque arces, et navifragum Scylaceum.'\r\n\r\n    (iii. 552-3.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Greek city.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Cassiodorus, this Greek city was founded by Ulysses after\r\nthe destruction of Troy. Strabo[9] attributes the foundation of it to\r\nthe almost equally widespread energy of Menestheus. The form of the\r\nname makes it probable that the colonists were in any case of Ionian\r\ndescent; but in historic times we find Scylletion subject to the\r\ndomineering Achaian city of Crotona, from whose grasp it was wrested\r\n(B.C. 389) by the elder Dionysius. It no doubt shared in the general\r\ndecay of the towns of this part of Magna Graecia consequent on the\r\nwars of Dionysius and Agathocles, and may very probably, like Crotona,\r\nhave been taken and laid waste by the Bruttian banditti in the Second\r\nPunic War. During the latter part of this war Hannibal seems to have\r\noccupied a position near to, but not in, the already ruined city, and\r\nits port was known long after as Castra Hannibalis[10].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: p. 375: ed. Oxon. 1807.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Pliny (Hist. Nat. iii. 10) says: 'Dein sinus Scylacius\r\net Scyllacium, Scylletium Atheniensibus, cum conderent, dictum: quem\r\nlocum occurrens Terinaeus sinus peninsulam efficit: et in eâ portus\r\nqui vocatur Castra Annibalis, nusquam angustiore Italia XX millia\r\npassuum latitudo est.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman colony.]\r\n\r\n[11]'A century before the end of the Republic, a city much more\r\nconsiderable than that which had existed in the past was again\r\nestablished near the point where the Greek Scylletion had existed.\r\nAmong the colonies of Roman citizens founded B.C. 123 on the rogation\r\nof Caius Gracchus, was one sent to this part of Bruttii, under the\r\nname of Colonia Minervia Scolacium, a name parallel to those of\r\nColonia Neptunia Tarentum and Colonia Junonia Karthago, decided on at\r\nthe same time. _Scolacium_ is the form that we meet with in Velleius\r\nPaterculus, and that is found in an extant Latin inscription of the\r\ntime of Antoninus Pius. This is the old Latin form of the name of the\r\ntown. _Scylacium_, which first appears as used by the writers of the\r\nfirst century of our era, is a purely literary form springing from the\r\ndesire to get nearer to the Greek type _Scylletion_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: I take the two following paragraphs from Lenormant's La\r\nGrande Grèce, pp. 342-3.]\r\n\r\n'Scolacium, or Scylacium, a town purely Roman by reason of the origin\r\nof its first colonists, was from its earliest days an important city,\r\nand remained such till the end of the Empire. Pomponius Mela, Strabo,\r\nPliny, and Ptolemy speak of it as one of the principal cities of\r\nBruttii. It had for its port Castra Hannibalis. Under Nero its\r\npopulation was strengthened by a new settlement of veterans as\r\ncolonists. The city then took the names of Colonia Minervia Nervia\r\nAugusta Scolacium. We read these names in an inscription discovered in\r\n1762 at 1,800 metres from the modern Squillace, between that city and\r\nthe sea--an inscription which mentions the construction of an aqueduct\r\nbringing water to Scolacium, executed 143 A.D. at the cost of the\r\nEmperor Antoninus.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appearance of the city at the time of Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\nFor the appearance of this Roman colony in the seventh century of its\r\nexistence the reader is referred to the letter of Cassiodorus before\r\nquoted (Var. xii. 15). The picture of the city, 'hanging like a\r\ncluster of grapes upon the hills, basking in the brightness of the sun\r\nall day long, yet cooled by the breezes from the sea, and looking at\r\nher leisure on the labours of the husbandman in the corn-fields, the\r\nvineyards, and the olive-groves around her,' is an attractive one, and\r\nshows that kind of appreciation of the gentler beauties of Nature\r\nwhich befits a countryman of Virgil.\r\n\r\nThis picture, however, is not distinctive enough to enable us from it\r\nalone to fix the exact site of the Roman city. Lenormant (pp.\r\n360-370), while carefully distinguishing between the sites of the\r\nGreek Scylletion and the Latin Scolacium, and assigning the former\r\nwith much apparent probability to the neighbourhood of the promontory\r\nand the Grotte di Stalletti, has been probably too hasty in his\r\nassertion that the modern city of Squillace incontestably covers the\r\nground of the Latin Scolacium. Mr. Arthur J. Evans, after making a\r\nmuch more careful survey of the place and its neighbourhood than the\r\nFrench archaeologist had leisure for, has come to the conclusion that\r\nin this identification M. Lenormant is entirely wrong, and that the\r\nRoman city was not at Squillace, where there are no remains of earlier\r\nthan mediaeval times, but at Roccella del Vescovo, five or six miles\r\nfrom Squillace in a north-easterly direction, where there are such\r\nremains as can only have belonged to a Roman provincial city of the\r\nfirst rank. For a further discussion of the question the reader is\r\nreferred to the Note (and accompanying Map) at the end of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nWe pass on from considering the place of Cassiodorus' birth to\r\ninvestigate the date of that event.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Date of birth.]\r\n\r\n(3) The only positive statement that we possess as to the birth-year\r\nof Cassiodorus comes from a very late and somewhat unsatisfactory\r\nsource. John Trittheim (or Trithemius), Abbot of the Benedictine\r\nMonastery of Spanheim, who died in 1516, was one of the ecclesiastical\r\nscholars of the Renaissance period, and composed, besides a multitude\r\nof other books, a treatise 'De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis,' in which\r\nis found this notice of Cassiodorus[12]:--\r\n\r\n'Claruit temporibus Justini senioris usque ad imperii Justini junioris\r\npaene finem, annos habens aetatis plus quam 95, Anno Domini 575.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The reference is given by Köpke (Die Anfänge des\r\nKönigthums, p. 88) as 'De scr. ecc. 212 Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica, ed.\r\nFabricius, p. 58;' by Thorbecke (p. 8) as 'Catalogus seu liber\r\nscriptorum ecclesiasticorum, Coloniae 1546, p. 94.' Franz (p. 4)\r\nquotes from the same edition as Köpke, 'De script. eccl. c. 212 in\r\nFabricii biblioth. eccl., Hamburgi 1728, iii. p. 58.']\r\n\r\nThis notice is certainly not one to which we should attach much\r\nimportance if it contradicted earlier and trustworthy authorities, or\r\nif there were any internal evidence against it. But if this cannot be\r\nasserted, it is not desirable entirely to discard the assertion of a\r\nscholar who, in the age of the Renaissance and before the havoc\r\nwrought among the monasteries of Germany by the Thirty Years' War, may\r\neasily have had access to some sources which are now no longer\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the information which is thus given us, we find it\r\ncertainly somewhat vague. 'Cassiodorus was illustrious' (no doubt as a\r\nwriter, since it is 'ecclesiastici scriptores' of whom Trittheim is\r\nspeaking) 'in the time of Justin the Elder [518-527] down nearly to\r\nthe end of the reign of Justin the Younger [565-578], attaining to\r\nmore than 95 years of age in the year of our Lord 575.' But on\r\nreflection we see that the meaning must be that Cassiodorus died in\r\n575 (which agrees well with the words 'paene finem imperii Justini\r\njunioris'), and that when he died he was some way on in his 96th year,\r\nor as we say colloquially 'ninety-five off.' The marvel of his\r\nattaining such an age is no doubt the reason for inserting the 'plus\r\nquam,' to show that he did not die immediately after his 95th\r\nbirthday. If this notice be trustworthy, therefore, we may place the\r\nbirth of Cassiodorus in 479 or 480.\r\n\r\nNow upon examining all the facts in our possession as to his career as\r\na statesman and an author, and especially our latest acquired\r\ninformation[13], we find that they do in a remarkable manner agree\r\nwith Trittheim's date, while we have no positive statement by any\r\nauthor early or late which really conflicts with it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The Anecdoton Holderi.]\r\n\r\nThe only shadow of an argument that has been advanced for a different\r\nand earlier date is so thin that it is difficult to state without\r\nconfuting it. In some editions of the works of Cassiodorus there\r\nappears a very short anonymous tract on the method of determining\r\nEaster, called 'Computus Paschalis,' and composed in 562. In the\r\n'Orthographia,' which was undoubtedly written by Cassiodorus at the\r\nage of 93, and which contains a list of his previously published\r\nworks, no mention is made of this 'Computus.' It must therefore, say\r\nthe supporters of the theory, have been written after he was 93. He\r\nmust have been at least 94 in 562, and the year of his birth must be\r\nput back at least to 468. In this argument there are two absolutely\r\nworthless links. There is no evidence to show that the 'Computus\r\nPaschalis' came from the pen of Cassiodorus at all, but much reason to\r\nthink that Pithoeus, the editor who first published it under his name,\r\nwas mistaken in doing so. And if it were his, a little memorandum like\r\nthis--only two pages long, and with no literary pretension\r\nwhatever--we may almost say with certainty would _not_ be included by\r\nthe veteran author in the enumeration of his theological works\r\nprefixed to his 'Orthographia.'\r\n\r\nThe reason why a theory founded on such an absurdly weak basis has\r\nheld its ground at all, has probably been that it buttressed up\r\nanother obvious fallacy. A whole school of biographers of Cassiodorus\r\nand commentators on his works has persisted, in spite of the plainest\r\nevidence of his letters, in identifying him with his father, who bore\r\noffice under Odovacar (476-493). To do this it was necessary to get\r\nrid of the date 480 for the birth of Cassiodorus Senator, and to throw\r\nback that event as far as possible. And yet, not even by pushing it\r\nback to 468, do they make it reasonably probable that a person, who\r\nwas only a child of eight years old at Odovacar's accession, could in\r\nthe course of his short reign (the last four years of which were\r\nfilled by his struggle with Theodoric) have held the various high\r\noffices which were really held during that reign by the father of\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\nWe assume therefore with some confidence the year 480 as the\r\napproximate date of the birth of our author; and while we observe that\r\nthis date fits well with those which the course of history induces us\r\nto assign to his ancestors in the three preceding generations[14], we\r\nalso note with interest that it was, as nearly as we can ascertain,\r\nthe year of the birth of two of the most distinguished contemporaries\r\nof Cassiodorus--Boethius and Benedict.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Cassiodorus the First, born about 390; the Second, about\r\n420; the Third, about 450.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education of Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\nOf the training and education of the young Senator we can only speak\r\nfrom their evident results as displayed in the 'Variae,' to which the\r\nreader is accordingly referred. It may be remarked, however, that\r\nthough he evidently received the usual instruction in philosophy and\r\nrhetoric which was given to a young Roman noble aspiring to employment\r\nin the Civil Service, there are some indications that the bent of his\r\nown genius was towards Natural History, strange and often laughable as\r\nare the facts or fictions which this taste of his has caused him to\r\naccumulate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consiliarius to his father.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 500[15], when Senator had just attained the age of twenty,\r\nhis father, as we have already seen, received from Theodoric the high\r\noffice of Praetorian Praefect. As a General might make an\r\n_Aide-de-camp_ of his son, so the Praefect conferred upon the young\r\nSenator the post of _Consiliarius_, or Assessor in his Court[16]. The\r\nConsiliarius[17] had been in the time of the Republic an experienced\r\njurist who sat beside the Praetor or the Consul (who might be a man\r\nquite unversed in the law) and advised him as to his judgments. From\r\nthe time of Severus onwards he became a paid functionary of the Court,\r\nreceiving a salary which varied from 12 to 72 solidi (£7 to £43). At\r\nthe time which we are now describing it was customary for the Judge to\r\nchoose his Consiliarius from among the ranks of young jurists who had\r\njust completed their studies. The great legal school of Berytus\r\nespecially furnished a large number of Consiliarii to the Roman\r\nGovernors. In order to prevent an officer in this position from\r\nobtaining an undue influence over the mind of his principal, the\r\nlatter was forbidden by law to keep a Consiliarius, who was a native\r\nof the Province in which he was administering justice, more than four\r\nmonths in his employ[18]. This provision, of course, would not apply\r\nwhen the young Assessor, as in the case of Cassiodorus, came with his\r\nfather from a distant Province: and in such a case, if the Magistrate\r\ndied during his year of office, by a special enactment the\r\nfairly-earned pay of the Assessor was protected from unjust demands on\r\nthe part of the Exchequer[19]. The functions thus exercised by Senator\r\nin his father's court at Rome, and the title which he bore, were\r\nsomewhat similar to those which Procopius held in the camp of\r\nBelisarius, but doubtless required a more thorough legal training. In\r\nour own system, if we could imagine the Judge's Marshal invested with\r\nthe responsibilities of a Registrar of the Court, we should perhaps\r\nget a pretty fair idea of the position and duties of a Roman\r\nConsiliarius[20].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Or possibly 501.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: This fact, and also the cause of Senator's promotion to\r\nthe Quaestorship, we learn from the Anecdoton Holderi described in a\r\nfollowing chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The terms Adsessor, Consiliarius, [Greek: Paredros],\r\n[Greek: Symboulos], seem all to indicate the same office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Cod. Theod. i. 12. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: This seems to be the meaning of Cod. Theod. i. 12. 2.\r\nThe gains of the 'filii familias Assessores' were to be protected as\r\nif they were 'castrense peculium.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Some points in this description are taken from Bethmann\r\nHollweg, Gerichtsverfassung der sinkenden Römischen Reichs, pp.\r\n153-158.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Panegyric on Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appointed Quaestor.]\r\n\r\nIt was while Cassiodorus was holding this agreeable but not important\r\nposition, that the opportunity came to him, by his dexterous use of\r\nwhich he sprang at one bound into the foremost ranks of the official\r\nhierarchy. On some public occasion it fell to his lot to deliver an\r\noration in praise of Theodoric[21], and he did this with such\r\nadmirable eloquence--admirable according to the depraved taste of the\r\ntime--that Theodoric at once bestowed upon the orator, still in the\r\nfirst dawn of manhood[22], the 'Illustrious' office of Quaestor,\r\ngiving him thereby what we should call Cabinet-rank, and placing him\r\namong the ten or eleven ministers of the highest class[23], by whom,\r\nunder the King, the fortunes of the Gothic-Roman State were absolutely\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: 'Cassiodorus Senator ... juvenis adeo, dum patris\r\nCassiodori patricii et praefecti praetorii consiliarius fieret et\r\nlaudes Theodorichi regis Gothorum facundissime recitasset, ab eo\r\nquaestor est factus' (Anecdoton Holderi, ap. Usener, p. 4).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: He himself says, or rather makes Theodoric's grandson\r\nsay to him, 'Quem _primaevum_ recipiens ad quaestoris officium, mox\r\nreperit [Theodoricus] conscientiâ praeditum, et legum eruditione\r\nmaturum' (Var. ix. 24).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: At this time the Illustres actually in office would\r\nprobably be the Praefectus Praetorio Italiae (Cassiodorus the father),\r\nthe Praefectus Urbis Romae, the two Magistri Militum in Praesenti, the\r\nPraepositus Sacri Cubiculi, the Magister Officiorum, the Quaestor, the\r\nComes Sacrarum Largitionum, the Comes Rerum Privatarum, and the two\r\nComites Domesticorum Equitum et Peditum.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of the Quaestor's office.]\r\n\r\nThe Quaestor's duty required him to be beyond all other Ministers the\r\nmouthpiece of the Sovereign. In the 'Notitia[24]' the matters under\r\nhis control are concisely stated to be 'Laws which are to be dictated,\r\nand Petitions.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: 'Sub dispositione viri illustris Quaestoris\r\n\r\n     Leges dictandae\r\n     Preces.\r\n\r\nOfficium non habet sed adjutores de scriniis quos voluerit.']\r\n\r\nTo him therefore was assigned the duty (which the British Parliament\r\nin its folly assigns to no one) of giving a final revision to the laws\r\nwhich received the Sovereign's signature, and seeing that they were\r\nconsistent with one another and with previous enactments, and were\r\nclothed in fitting language. He replied in the Sovereign's name to the\r\npetitions which were presented to him. He also, as we learn from\r\nCassiodorus, had audience with the ambassadors of foreign powers, to\r\nwhom he addressed suitable and stately harangues, or through whom he\r\nforwarded written replies to the letters which they had brought, but\r\nalways of course speaking or writing in the name of his master. In the\r\nperformance of these duties he had chiefly to rely on his own\r\nintellectual resources as a trained jurist and rhetorician. The large\r\nofficial staff which waited upon the nod of the other great Ministers\r\nof State was absent from his apartments[25]; but for the mere manual\r\nwork of copying, filing correspondence, and the like, he could summon\r\nthe needful number of clerks from the four great bureaux (scrinia)\r\nwhich were under the control of the Master of the Offices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Officium non habet.]\r\n\r\nWe have an interesting summary of the Quaestor's duties and privileges\r\nfrom the pen of Cassiodorus himself in the 'Variae' (vi. 5), under the\r\ntitle 'Formula Quaesturae,' and to this document I refer the reader\r\nwho wishes to complete the picture of the occupations in which the\r\nbusiest years of the life of Cassiodorus were passed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Special utility of a Quaestor to Theodoric.]\r\n\r\nTo a ruler in Theodoric's position the acquisition of such a Quaestor\r\nas Cassiodorus was a most fortunate event. He himself was doubtless\r\nunable to speak or to write Latin with fluency. According to the\r\ncommon story, which passes current on the authority of the 'Anonymus\r\nValesii,' he never could learn to write, and had to 'stencil' his\r\nsignature. I look upon this story with some suspicion, especially\r\nbecause it is also told of his contemporary, the Emperor Justin; but I\r\nhave no doubt that such literary education as Theodoric ever received\r\nwas Greek rather than Latin, being imparted during the ten years of\r\nhis residence as a hostage at Constantinople. Years of marches and\r\ncountermarches, of battle and foray, at the head of his Ostrogothic\r\nwarriors, may well have effaced much of the knowledge thus acquired.\r\nAt any rate, when he descended the Julian Alps, close upon forty years\r\nof age, and appeared for the first time in Italy to commence his long\r\nand terrible duel with Odovacar, it was too late to learn the language\r\nof her sons in such fashion that the first sentence spoken by him in\r\nthe Hall of Audience should not betray him to his new subjects as an\r\nalien and a barbarian.\r\n\r\nYet Theodoric was by no means indifferent to the power of well-spoken\r\nwords, by no means unconcerned as to the opinion which his\r\nLatin-speaking subjects held concerning him. He was no Cambyses or\r\nTimour, ruling by the sword alone. His proud title was 'Gothorum\r\nRomanorumque Rex,' and the ideal of his hopes, successfully realised\r\nduring the greater part of his long and tranquil reign, was to be\r\nequally the King of either people. He had been fortunate thus far in\r\nhis Praetorian Praefects. Liberius, a man of whom history knows too\r\nlittle, had amid general applause steered the vessel of the State for\r\nthe first seven years of the new reign. The elder Cassiodorus, who had\r\nsucceeded him, seemed likely to follow the same course. But possibly\r\nTheodoric had begun to feel the necessity laid upon all rulers of men,\r\nnot only to be, but also to seem, anxious for the welfare of their\r\nsubjects. Possibly some dull, unsympathetic Quaestor had failed to\r\npresent the generous thoughts of the King in a sufficiently attractive\r\nshape to the minds of the people. This much at all events we know,\r\nthat when the young Consiliarius, high-born, fluent, and learned,\r\npoured forth his stream of panegyric on 'Our Lord Theodoric'--a\r\npanegyric which, to an extent unusual with these orations, reflected\r\nthe real feelings of the speaker, and all the finest passages of which\r\nwere the genuine outcome of his own enthusiasm--the great Ostrogoth\r\nrecognised at once the man whom he was in want of to be the exponent\r\nof his thoughts to the people, and by one stroke of wise audacity\r\nturned the boyish and comparatively obscure Assessor into the\r\nIllustrious Quaestor, one of the great personages of his realm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Composition of the VARIAE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their style.]\r\n\r\nThe monument of the official life of Cassiodorus is the correspondence\r\nstyled the 'Variae,' of which an abstract is now submitted to the\r\nreader. There is no need to say much here, either as to the style or\r\nthe thoughts of these letters; a perusal of a few pages of the\r\nabstract will give a better idea of both than an elaborate\r\ndescription. The style is undoubtedly a bad one, whether it be\r\ncompared with the great works of Greek and Latin literature or with\r\nour own estimate of excellence in speech. Scarcely ever do we find a\r\nthought clothed in clear, precise, closely-fitting words, or a\r\nmetaphor which really corresponds to the abstract idea that is\r\nrepresented by it. We take up sentence after sentence of verbose and\r\nflaccid Latin, analyse them with difficulty, and when at last we come\r\nto the central thought enshrouded in them, we too often find that it\r\nis the merest and most obvious commonplace, a piece of tinsel wrapped\r\nin endless folds of tissue paper. Perhaps from one point of view the\r\nstudy of the style of Cassiodorus might prove useful to a writer of\r\nEnglish, as indicating the faults which he has in this age most\r\ncarefully to avoid. Over and over again, when reading newspaper\r\narticles full of pompous words borrowed from Latin through French,\r\nwhen wearied with 'velleities' and 'solidarities' and 'altruisms' and\r\n'homologators,' or when vainly endeavouring to discover the real\r\nmeaning which lies hidden in a jungle of Parliamentary verbiage, I\r\nhave said to myself, remembering my similar labour upon the 'Variae,'\r\n'How like this is to Cassiodorus.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lack of humour.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The letter about the sucking-fish.]\r\n\r\nIntellectually one of the chief deficiencies of our author--a\r\ndeficiency in which perhaps his age and nation participated--was a\r\nlack of humour. It is difficult to think that anyone who possessed a\r\nkeen sense of humour could have written letters so drolly unsuited to\r\nthe character of Theodoric, their supposed author, as are some which\r\nwe find in the 'Variae.' For instance, the King had reason to complain\r\nthat Faustus, the Praetorian Praefect, was dawdling over the execution\r\nof an order which he had received for the shipment of corn from the\r\nregions of Calabria and Apulia to Rome. We find the literary Quaestor\r\nputting such words as these into the mouth of Theodoric, when\r\nreprimanding the lazy official[26]: 'Why is there such great delay in\r\nsending your swift ships to traverse the tranquil seas? Though the\r\nsouth wind blows and the rowers are bending to their oars, has the\r\nsucking-fish[27] fixed its teeth into the hulls through the liquid\r\nwaves; or have the shells of the Indian Sea, whose quiet touch is said\r\nto hold so firmly that the angry billows cannot loosen it, with like\r\npower fixed their lips into your keels? Idle stands the bark though\r\nwinged by swelling sails; the wind favours her but she makes no way;\r\nshe is fixed without an anchor, she is bound without a cable; and\r\nthese tiny animals hinder more than all such prospering circumstances\r\ncan help. Thus, though the loyal wave may be hastening its course, we\r\nare informed that the ship stands fixed on the surface of the sea, and\r\nby a strange paradox the swimmer [the ship] is made to remain\r\nimmovable while the wave is hurried along by movements numberless. Or,\r\nto describe the nature of another kind of fish, perchance the sailors\r\nin the aforesaid ships have grown dull and torpid by the touch of the\r\ntorpedo, by which such a deadly chill is struck into the right hand of\r\nhim who attacks it, that even through the spear by which it is itself\r\nwounded, it gives a shock which causes the hand of the striker to\r\nremain, though still a living substance, senseless and immovable. I\r\nthink some such misfortunes as these must have happened to men who are\r\nunable to move their own bodies. But I know that in their case the\r\necheneis is corruption trading on delays; the bite of the Indian\r\nshell-fish is insatiable cupidity; the torpedo is fraudulent pretence.\r\nWith perverted ingenuity they manufacture delays that they may seem to\r\nhave met with a run of ill-luck. Wherefore let your Greatness, whom it\r\nspecially concerns to look after such men as these, by a speedy rebuke\r\nbring them to a better mind. Else the famine which we fear, will be\r\nimputed not to the barrenness of the times but to official\r\nnegligence, whose true child it will manifestly appear.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Var. i. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Echeneis.]\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that Theodoric ever read a letter like this before\r\naffixing to it his (perhaps stencilled) signature. If he did, he must\r\nsurely have smiled to see his few angry Teutonic words transmuted into\r\nthis wonderful rhapsody about sucking-fishes and torpedoes and\r\nshell-fish in the Indian Sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\nThe French proverb 'Le style c'est l'homme,' is not altogether true as\r\nto the character of Cassiodorus. From his inflated and tawdry style we\r\nmight have expected to find him an untrustworthy friend and an\r\ninefficient administrator. This, however, was not the case. As was\r\nbefore said, his character was not heroic; he was, perhaps, inclined\r\nto humble himself unduly before mere power and rank, and he had the\r\nfault, common to most rhetoricians, of over-estimating the power of\r\nwords and thinking that a few fluent platitudes would heal inveterate\r\ndiscords and hide disastrous blunders. But when we have said this we\r\nhave said the worst. He was, as far as we have any means of judging, a\r\nloyal subject, a faithful friend, a strenuous and successful\r\nadministrator, and an exceptionally far-sighted statesman. His right\r\nto this last designation rests upon the part which he bore in the\r\nestablishment of the Italian Kingdom 'of the Goths and Romans,'\r\nfounded by the great Theodoric.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His work in seconding the policy of Theodoric.]\r\n\r\nTheodoric, it must always be remembered, had entered Italy not\r\nostensibly as an invader but as a deliverer. He came in pursuance of a\r\ncompact with the legitimate Emperor of the New Rome, to deliver the\r\nElder Rome and the land of Italy from the dominion of 'the upstart\r\nKing of Rugians and Turcilingians[28],' Odovacar. The compact, it is\r\ntrue, was loose and indefinite, and contained within itself the germs\r\nof that misunderstanding which, forty-seven years later, was developed\r\ninto a terrible war. Still, for the present, Theodoric, King of the\r\nOstrogoths, was also in some undefined way legitimate representative\r\nof the Old Roman Empire within the borders of Italy. This double\r\naspect of his rule was illustrated by that which (rather than the\r\ndoubtful Rex Italiae) seems to have been his favourite title,\r\n'Gothorum Romanorumque Rex.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Jordanes, De Rebus Geticis, lvii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theodoric's love of _Civilitas_.]\r\n\r\nThe great need of Italy was peace. After a century of wars and rumours\r\nof wars; after Alaric, Attila, and Gaiseric had wasted her fields or\r\nsacked her capital; after she had been exhausting her strength in\r\nhopeless efforts to preserve the dominion of Gaul, Spain, and Africa;\r\nafter she had groaned under the exactions of the insolent _foederati_,\r\nRoman soldiers only in name, who followed the standards of Ricimer or\r\nOdovacar, she needed peace and to be governed with a strong hand, in\r\norder to recover some small part of her old material prosperity. These\r\ntwo blessings, peace and a strong government, Theodoric's rule ensured\r\nto her. The theory of his government was this, that the two nations\r\nshould dwell side by side, not fused into one, not subject either to\r\nthe other, but the Romans labouring at the arts of peace, the Goths\r\nwielding for their defence the sword of war. Over all was to be the\r\nstrong hand of the King of Goths and Romans, repressing the violence\r\nof the one nation, correcting the chicanery of the other, and from one\r\nand all exacting the strict observance of that which was the object of\r\nhis daily and nightly cares, CIVILITAS. Of this civilitas--which we\r\nmay sometimes translate 'good order,' sometimes 'civilisation,'\r\nsometimes 'the character of a law-abiding citizen,' but which no\r\nEnglish word or phrase fully expresses--the reader of the following\r\nletters will hear, even to weariness. But though we may be tired of\r\nthe phrase, we ought none the less to remember that the thing was that\r\nwhich Italy stood most in need of, that it was secured for her during\r\nforty years by the labours of Theodoric and Cassiodorus, and that\r\nhappiness, such as she knew not again for many centuries, was the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foresight of Cassiodorus in aiding this policy.]\r\n\r\nBut the theory of a warrior caste of Goths and a trading and labouring\r\ncaste of Romans was not flattering to the national vanity of a people\r\nwho, though they had lost all relish for fighting, could not forget\r\nthe great deeds of their forefathers. This was no doubt the weak point\r\nof the new State-system, though one cannot say that it is a weakness\r\nwhich need have been fatal if time enough had been given for the\r\nworking out of the great experiment, and for Roman and Goth to become\r\nin Italy, as they did become in Spain, one people. The grounds upon\r\nwhich the praise of far-seeing statesmanship may be claimed for\r\nCassiodorus are, that notwithstanding the bitter taste which it must\r\nhave had in his mouth, as in the mouth of every educated Roman, he\r\nperceived that here was the best medicine for the ills of Italy. All\r\nattempts to conjure with the great name of the Roman Empire could only\r\nend in subjection to the really alien rule of Byzantium. All attempts\r\nto rouse the religious passions of the Catholic against the heretical\r\nintruders were likely to benefit the Catholic but savage Frank. The\r\ncruel sufferings of the Italians at the hands of the Heruli of\r\nBelisarius and from the ravages of the Alamannic Brethren are\r\nsufficient justification of the soundness of Cassiodorus' view that\r\nTheodoric's State-system was the one point of hope for Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His religious tolerance.]\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made in the last paragraph to the religious\r\ndifferences which divided the Goths from the Italians. It is well\r\nknown that Theodoric was an Arian, but an Arian of the most tolerant\r\ntype, quite unlike the bitter persecutors who reigned at Toulouse and\r\nat Carthage. During the last few years of his reign, indeed, when his\r\nmind was perhaps in some degree failing, he was tempted by the\r\npersecuting policy of the Emperor Justin into retaliatory measures of\r\npersecution towards his Catholic subjects, but as a rule his policy\r\nwas eminently fair and even-handed towards the professors of the two\r\nhostile creeds, and even towards the generally proscribed nation of\r\nthe Jews. So conspicuous to all the world was his desire to hold the\r\nbalance perfectly even between the two communions, that it was said of\r\nhim that he beheaded an orthodox deacon who was singularly dear to\r\nhim, because he had professed the Arian faith in order to win his\r\nfavour. But this story, though told by a nearly contemporary\r\nwriter[29], is, it may be hoped, mere Saga.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Theodorus Lector (circa 550), Eccl. Hist. ii. 18. Both\r\nhe and some later writers who borrow from him call the King [Greek:\r\nTheoderichos ho Aphros]; why, it is impossible to say.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: This did not proceed from indifference.]\r\n\r\nThe point which we may note is, that this policy of toleration or\r\nrather of absolute fairness between warring creeds, though not\r\ninitiated by Cassiodorus, seems to have thoroughly commended itself to\r\nhis reason and conscience. It is from his pen that we get those golden\r\nwords which may well atone for many platitudes and some ill-judged\r\ndisplay of learning: _Religionem imperare non possumus, quia nemo\r\ncogitur ut credat invitus_[30]. And this tolerant temper of mind is\r\nthe more to be commended, because it did not proceed from any\r\nindifference on his part to the subjects of religious controversy.\r\nCassiodorus was evidently a devout and loyal Catholic. Much the larger\r\npart of his writings is of a theological character, and the\r\nthirty-five years of his life which he passed in a monastery were\r\nevidently\r\n\r\n    'Bound each to each in natural piety'\r\n\r\nwith the earlier years passed at Court and in the Council-chamber.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Var. ii. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Date of the commencement of the Variae.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot trace as we should like to do the precise limits of time by\r\nwhich the official career of Cassiodorus was bounded. The 'Various\r\nLetters' are evidently not arranged in strict chronological order, and\r\nto but few of them is it possible to affix an exact date. There are\r\ntwo or three, however, which require especial notice, because some\r\nauthors have assigned them to a date previous to that at which, as I\r\nbelieve, the author entered the service of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter to Anastasius.]\r\n\r\nThe first letter of the whole series is addressed to the Emperor\r\nAnastasius. It has been sometimes connected with the embassy of\r\nFaustus in 493, or with that of Festus in 497, to the Court of\r\nConstantinople, the latter of which embassies resulted in the\r\ntransmission to Theodoric of 'the ornaments of the palace' (that is\r\nprobably the regal insignia) which Odovacar had surrendered to Zeno.\r\nBut the language of the letter in question, which speaks of 'causas\r\niracundiae,' does not harmonise well with either of these dates, since\r\nthere was then, as far as we know, no quarrel between Ravenna and\r\nConstantinople. On the other hand, it would fit perfectly with the\r\nstate of feeling between the two Courts in 505, after Sabinian the\r\ngeneral of Anastasius had been defeated by the troops of Theodoric\r\nunder Pitzias at the battle of Horrea Margi; or in 508, when the\r\nByzantine ships had made a raid on Apulia and plundered Tarentum. To\r\none of these dates it should probably be referred, its place at the\r\nbeginning of the collection being due to the exalted rank of the\r\nreceiver of the letter, not to considerations of chronology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters to Clovis.]\r\n\r\nThe fortieth and forty-first letters of the Second Book relate to the\r\nsending of a harper to Clovis, or, as Cassiodorus calls him, Luduin,\r\nKing of the Franks. In the earlier letter Boethius is directed to\r\nprocure such a harper (citharoedus), and to see that he is a\r\nfirst-rate performer. In the later, Theodoric congratulates his royal\r\nbrother-in-law on his victory over the Alamanni, adjures him not to\r\npursue the panic-stricken fugitives who have taken refuge within the\r\nOstrogothic territory, and sends ambassadors to introduce the harper\r\nwhom Boethius has provided. It used to be thought that these letters\r\nmust be referred to 496, the year of the celebrated victory of Clovis\r\nover the Alamanni, commonly, but incorrectly, called the battle of\r\nTulbiacum. But this was a most improbable theory, for it was difficult\r\nto understand how a boy of sixteen (and that was the age of Boethius\r\nin 496) should have attained such eminence as a musical connoisseur as\r\nto be entrusted with the task of selecting the citharoedus. And in a\r\nvery recent monograph[31] Herr von Schubert has shown, I think\r\nconvincingly, that the last victory of Clovis over the Alamanni, and\r\ntheir migration to Raetia within the borders of Theodoric's territory,\r\noccurred not in 496 but a few years later, probably about 503 or 504.\r\nIt is true that Gregory of Tours (to whom the earlier battle is\r\nall-important, as being the event which brought about the conversion\r\nof Clovis) says nothing about this later campaign; but to those who\r\nknow the fragmentary and incomplete character of this part of his\r\nhistory, such an omission will not appear an important argument.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Die Uterwerfung der Alamannen: Strassburg, 1884.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters to Gaulish princes.]\r\n\r\nThe letters written in Theodoric's name to Clovis, to Alaric II, to\r\nGundobad of Burgundy, and to other princes, in order to prevent the\r\noutbreak of a war between the Visigoths and the Franks, have been by\r\nsome authors[32] assigned to a date some years before the war actually\r\nbroke out; but though this cannot, perhaps, be disproved, it seems to\r\nme much more probable that they were written in the early part of 507\r\non the eve of the war between Clovis and Alaric, which they were\r\npowerless to avert.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Especially Binding, Geschichte des\r\nBurgundisch-Romanischen Königreichs, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duration of Cassiodorus' office.]\r\n\r\nMore difficult than the question of the beginning of the Quaestorship\r\nof Cassiodorus is that of its duration and its close. It was an office\r\nwhich was in its nature an annual one. At the commencement of each\r\nfresh year 'of the Indiction,' that is on the first of September of\r\nthe calendar year, a Quaestor was appointed; but there does not seem\r\nto have been anything to prevent the previous holder of the office\r\nfrom being re-appointed. In the case of Cassiodorus, the Quaestor\r\nafter Theodoric's own heart, his intimate friend and counsellor, this\r\nmay have been done for several years running, or he may have\r\napparently retired from office for a year and then resumed it. It is\r\nclear, that whether in or out of office he had always, as the King's\r\nfriend, a large share in the direction of State affairs. He himself\r\nsays, in a letter supposed to be addressed to himself after the death\r\nof Theodoric[33]: 'Non enim proprios fines sub te _ulla dignitas_\r\ncustodivit;' and that this was the fact we cannot doubt. Whatever his\r\nnominal dignity might be, or if for the moment he possessed no\r\nostensible office at all, he was still virtually what we should call\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Ostrogothic King[34].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: ix. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Thorbecke has pointed out (pp. 40-41) that we possess\r\nletters written by Cassiodorus to four Quaestors before the year 510,\r\nand that therefore the fact of others holding the nominal office of\r\nQuaestor did not circumscribe his activity as Secretary to Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consulship of Cassiodorus, 514.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 514 he received an honour which, notwithstanding that it\r\nwas utterly divorced from all real authority, was still one of the\r\nhighest objects of the ambition of every Roman noble: he was hailed as\r\nConsul Ordinarius, and gave his name to the year. For some reason\r\nwhich is not stated, possibly because the City of Constantinople was\r\nin that year menaced by the insurrection of Vitalian, no colleague in\r\nthe East was nominated to share his dignity; and the entry in the\r\nConsular Calendars is therefore 'Senatore solo Consule.'\r\n\r\nIn his own Chronicle, Cassiodorus adds the words,'Me etiam Consule in\r\nvestrorum laude temporum, adunato clero vel [= et] populo, Romanae\r\nEcclesiae rediit optata concordia.' This sentence no doubt relates to\r\nthe dissensions which had agitated the Roman Church ever since the\r\ncontested Papal election of Symmachus and Laurentius in the year 498.\r\nVictory had been assured to Symmachus by the Synod of 501, but\r\nevidently the feelings of hatred then aroused had still smouldered on,\r\nespecially perhaps among the Senators and high nobles of Rome, who had\r\nfor the most part adopted the candidature of Laurentius. Now, on the\r\ndeath of Symmachus (July 18, 514) the last embers of the controversy\r\nwere extinguished, and the genial influence of Cassiodorus, Senator by\r\nname and Consul by office, was successfully exerted to induce nobles,\r\nclergy, and people to unite in electing a new Pope. After eight days\r\nHormisdas the Campanian sat in the Chair of St. Peter, an undoubted\r\nPontiff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deference to the Roman Senate.]\r\n\r\nNot only in maintaining the dignity of the Consulship, but also in\r\ntreating the Roman Senate with every outward show of deference and\r\nrespect, did the Ostrogothic King follow and even improve upon the\r\nexample of the Roman Emperors. The student of the following letters\r\nwill observe the tone of deep respect which is almost always adopted\r\ntowards the Senate; how every nomination of importance to an official\r\npost is communicated to them, almost as if their suffrages were\r\nsolicited for the new candidate; what a show is made of consulting\r\nthem in reference to peace and war; and what a reality there seems to\r\nbe in the appeals made to their loyalty to the new King after the\r\ndeath of Theodoric. In all this, as in the whole relation of the\r\nEmpire to the Senate during the five centuries of their joint\r\nexistence, it is difficult to say where well-acted courtesy ended, and\r\nwhere the desire to secure such legal power as yet remained to a\r\nvenerable assembly began. Perhaps when we remember that for many\r\nglorious centuries the Senate had been the real ruler of the Roman\r\nState, we may assert that the attitude and the language of the\r\nsuccessors of Augustus towards the Conscript Fathers were similar to\r\nthose used by a modern House of Commons towards the Crown, only that\r\nin the one case the individual supplanted the assembly, in the other\r\nthe assembly supplanted the individual. But whatever the exact\r\nrelations between King and Senate may have been, and though\r\noccasionally the former found it necessary to rebuke the latter pretty\r\nsharply for conduct unbecoming their high position, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the general intention of Theodoric was to soothe the\r\nwounded pride and flatter the vanity of the Roman Senators by every\r\nmeans in his power: and for this purpose no one could be so well\r\nfitted as Cassiodorus, Senator by name and by office, descendant of\r\nmany generations of Roman nobles, and master of such exuberant\r\nrhetoric that it was difficult then, as it is often impossible now, to\r\nextract any definite meaning from his sonorous periods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus Patrician.]\r\n\r\nIt was possibly upon his laying down the Consulship, that Cassiodorus\r\nreceived the dignity of Patrician--a dignity only, for in itself it\r\nseems to have conferred neither wealth nor power. Yet a title which\r\nhad been borne by Ricimer, Odovacar, and Theodoric himself might well\r\nexcite the ambition of Theodoric's subject. If our conjecture be\r\ncorrect that it was conferred upon Cassiodorus in the year 515, he\r\nreceived it at an earlier age than his father, to whom only about ten\r\nor eleven years before he had written the letter announcing his\r\nelevation to this high dignity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chronicon.]\r\n\r\nFive years after his Consulate, Cassiodorus undertook a little piece\r\nof literary labour which he does not appear to have held in high\r\naccount himself (since he does not include it in the list of his\r\nworks), and which has certainly added but little to his fame. This was\r\nhis 'Chronicon,' containing an abstract of the history of the world\r\nfrom the deluge down to A.D. 519, the year of the Consulship of the\r\nEmperor Justin, and of Theodoric's son-in-law Eutharic. This\r\nChronicle is for the most part founded upon, or rather copied from,\r\nthe well-known works of Eusebius and Prosper, the copying being\r\nunfortunately not correctly done. More than this, Cassiodorus has\r\nattempted with little judgment to combine the mode of reckoning by\r\nConsular years and by years of Emperors. As he is generally two or\r\nthree years out in his reckoning of the former, this proceeding has\r\nthe curious result of persistently throwing some Consulships of the\r\nreigning Emperor into the reign of his predecessor.[35] Thus Probus is\r\nConsul for two years under Aurelian, and for one year under Tacitus;\r\nboth the two Consulships of Carus and the first of Diocletian are\r\nunder Probus, while Diocletian's second Consulship is under Carinus\r\nand Numerianus; and so forth. It is wonderful that so intelligent a\r\nperson as Cassiodorus did not see that combinations of this kind were\r\nfalse upon the face of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: It need hardly be explained that, as a matter of\r\ncompliment to the reigning Emperor, the first Consulship that fell\r\nvacant after his accession to the throne was (I believe invariably)\r\nfilled by him, and that though he might sometimes have held the office\r\nof Consul before his assumption of the diadem, this was not often the\r\ncase. Certainly, in the instances given above, Probus, Carus, and\r\nDiocletian held no Consulships till after they had been saluted as\r\nEmperors.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Chronicle gets nearer to the compiler's own times it becomes\r\nslightly more interesting, but also slightly less fair. Throughout the\r\nfourth century a few little remarks are interspersed in the dry list\r\nof names and dates, the general tendency of which is to praise up the\r\nGothic nation or to extenuate their faults and reverses. The battle of\r\nPollentia (402[36]) is unhesitatingly claimed as a Gothic victory; the\r\nclemency of Alaric at the capture of Rome (410) is magnified; the\r\nvalour of the Goths is made the cause of the defeat of Attila in the\r\nCatalaunian plains (451); the name of Gothic Eutharic is put before\r\nthat of Byzantine Justin in the consular list; and so forth. Upon the\r\nwhole, as has been already said, the work cannot be considered as\r\nadding to the reputation of its author; nor can it be defended from\r\nthe terrible attack which has been made upon it by that scholar of our\r\nown day whose opinion upon such a subject stands the highest, Theodor\r\nMommsen[37]. Only, when he makes this unfortunate Chronicle reflect\r\nsuspicion on the other works of Cassiodorus, and especially on the\r\nGothic History[38], the German scholar seems to me to chastise the\r\nbusy Minister more harshly than he deserves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Clinton's date for this battle, 403, differs from that\r\nassigned by Cassiodorus, and is, in my judgment, erroneous.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Abhandlungen der philologisch-historischen Klasse der\r\nKöniglich Sächsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, iii. 547-696.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: 'Dass die ganze Procedur von der übelsten Art ist und\r\nden viel gefeierten gothischen Historiker in jeder weise\r\ncompromittirt, bedarf keiner Ausaneindersetzung' (l.c. 564).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gothic History.]\r\n\r\nI have just alluded to the Gothic History of Cassiodorus. It was\r\napparently shortly after the composition of his Chronicle[39] that\r\nthis, in some respects his most important work, was compiled and\r\narranged according to his accustomed habit in twelve books. His own\r\nestimate--and it is not a low one--of the value of this performance is\r\nexpressed in a letter which he makes his young Sovereign Athalaric\r\naddress to the Senate on his promotion to the Praefecture[40]: 'He\r\nextended his labours even to our remote ancestry, learning by his\r\nreading that which scarcely the hoar memories of our forefathers\r\nretained. He drew forth from their hiding-place the Kings of the\r\nGoths, hidden by long forgetfulness. He restored the Amals to their\r\nproper place with the lustre of his own[41] lineage (?), evidently\r\nproving that up to the seventeenth generation we have had kings for\r\nour ancestors. He made the origin of the Goths a part of Roman\r\nhistory, collecting as it were into one wreath all the flowery growth\r\nwhich had before been scattered through the plains of many books.\r\nConsider therefore what love he showed to you [the Senate] in praising\r\nus, he who showed that the nation of your Sovereign had been from\r\nantiquity a marvellous people; so that ye, who from the days of your\r\nforefathers have ever been deemed noble, are yet ruled over by the\r\nancient progeny of Kings[42].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: It could not have been written, at any rate in its\r\npresent shape, before 516, because Athalaric's birth is mentioned in\r\nit. I prefer Jordanes' date for this event, 516 or 517, to that given\r\nby Procopius, 518. On the other hand, Usener proves (p. 74), from the\r\nreference to it in the Anecdoton Holderi, that it could not have been\r\nwritten after 521.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Var. ix. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: 'Iste Amalos cum generis _sui_ claritate restituit.'\r\nPerhaps it is better to take 'sui' as equivalent to 'illorum,' and\r\ntranslate 'their lineage.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: 'Ut sicut fuistis a majoribus vestris semper nobiles\r\naestimati, ita vobis rerum antiqua progenies imperaret.' For 'rerum'\r\nwe must surely read 'regum.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its purpose.]\r\n\r\nIn reading this estimate by Cassiodorus of his own performance, we can\r\nsee at once that it lacked that first of all conditions precedent for\r\nthe attainment of absolute historic truth, complete impartiality[43].\r\nLike Hume and like Macaulay Cassiodorus wrote his history with a\r\npurpose. We may describe that purpose as two-fold:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: My meaning would be better expressed by the useful\r\nGerman word 'voraussetzungslosigkeit,' freedom from a foregone\r\nconclusion.]\r\n\r\n(1) To vindicate the claim of the Goths to rank among the historic\r\nnations of antiquity by bringing them into some sort of connection\r\nwith Greece and Rome ('Originem Gothicam historiam fecit esse\r\nRomanam'); and (2) among the Goths, to exalt as highly as possible the\r\nfamily of the Amals, that family from which Theodoric had sprung, and\r\nto string as many regal names as possible upon the Amal chain\r\n('Evidenter ostendens in decimam septimam progeniem stirpem nos habere\r\nregalem').\r\n\r\nI have said that the possession of a purpose like this is unfavourable\r\nto the attainment of absolute historic truth; but the aim which\r\nCassiodorus proposed to himself was a lofty one, being in fact the\r\nreconciliation of the past and the future of the world by showing to\r\nthe outworn Latin race that the new blood which was being poured into\r\nit by the northern nations came, like its own, from a noble ancestry:\r\nand, for us, the labour to which it stimulated him has been full of\r\nprofit, since to it we owe something like one half of our knowledge of\r\nthe Teutonic ancestors of Modern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusion between Goths and Getae.]\r\n\r\nThe much-desired object of 'making the origin of Gothic history Roman'\r\nwas effected chiefly by attributing to the Goths all that Cassiodorus\r\nfound written in classic authors concerning the Getae or the\r\nScythians. The confusion between Goths and Getae, though modern\r\nethnologists are nearly unanimous in pronouncing it to be a confusion\r\nbetween two utterly different nations, is not one for which\r\nCassiodorus is responsible, since it had been made at least a hundred\r\nyears before his time. When the Emperor Claudius II won his great\r\nvictories over the Goths in the middle of the Third Century, he was\r\nhailed rightly enough by the surname of _Gothicus_; but when at the\r\nbeginning of the Fifth Century the feeble Emperors Arcadius and\r\nHonorius wished to celebrate a victory which, as they vainly hoped,\r\nhad effectually broken the power of the Goths, the words which they\r\ninscribed upon the Arch of Triumph were 'Quod _Getarum_ nationem in\r\nomne aevum docuere extingui.' In the poems of Claudian, and generally\r\nin all the contemporary literature of the time, the regular word for\r\nthe countrymen of Alaric is Getae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The term Scythian.]\r\n\r\nThe Greek historians, on the other hand, freely applied the general\r\nterm Scythian--as they had done at any time since the Scythian\r\ncampaign of Darius Hystaspis--to any barbarian nation living beyond\r\nthe Danube and the Cimmerian Bosporus. With these two clues, or\r\nimaginary clues, in his hand, Cassiodorus could traverse a\r\nconsiderable part of the border-land of classical antiquity. The\r\nbattles between the Scythians and the Egyptians, the story of the\r\nAmazons, Telephus son of Hercules and nephew of Priam, the defeat of\r\nCyrus by Tomyris, and the unsuccessful expedition of Darius--all were\r\nconnected with Gothic history by means of that easily stretched word,\r\nScythia. Then comes Sitalces, King of Thrace, who makes war on\r\nPerdiccas of Macedon; and then, 'in the time of Sylla,' a certain wise\r\nphilosopher-king of Dacia, Diceneus by name, in whose character and\r\nhistory Cassiodorus perhaps outlined his own ideal of wisdom swaying\r\nbrute force. With these and similar stories culled from classical\r\nauthors Cassiodorus appears to have filled up the interval--which was\r\nto him of absolutely uncertain duration--between the Gothic migration\r\nfrom the Baltic to the Euxine and their appearance as conquerors and\r\nravagers in the eastern half of the Roman Empire in the middle of the\r\nthird century of the Christian era. Now, soothing as it may have been\r\nto the pride of a Roman subject of Theodoric to be informed that his\r\nmaster's ancestors had fought at the war of Troy and humbled the pride\r\nof Perdiccas, to a scientific historian these Scytho-Getic histories\r\nculled from Herodotus and Trogus are of little or no value, and his\r\nfirst step in the process of enquiry is to eliminate them from\r\n'Gothica historia,' thus making it, as far as he can, _not_ 'Romana.'\r\nThe question then arises whether there was another truly Gothic\r\nelement in the history of Cassiodorus, and if so, what value can be\r\nattached to it. Thus enquiring we soon find, both before and after\r\nthis intrusive Scytho-Getic element, matter of quite a different kind,\r\nwhich has often much of the ring of the true Teutonic _Saga_. It is\r\nreasonable to believe that here Cassiodorus, whose mission it was to\r\nreconcile Roman and Goth, and who could not have achieved this end by\r\naltering the history of the less civilised people out of all\r\npossibility of recognition by its own chieftains and warriors, has\r\nreally interwoven in his work some part of the songs and Sagas which\r\nwere still current among the older men who had shared the wanderings\r\nof Theodoric. This legendary portion, which Cassiodorus himself\r\nperhaps half despised, as being gathered not from books but from the\r\nlips of rude minstrels, is in fact the only part of his work which has\r\nany scientific value.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Amal pedigree.]\r\n\r\nIn his glorification of the Amal line, Cassiodorus follows more\r\nclosely these genuine national traditions than in his history of the\r\nGothic people. References to Herodotus and Trogus would have been here\r\nobviously out of place, and he accordingly puts before us a pedigree\r\nfashioned on the same model as those which we find in the Saxon\r\nChronicle, and therefore probably genuine. By genuine of course is\r\nmeant a pedigree which was really current and accepted among the\r\npeople over whom Theodoric ruled. How many of the links which form it\r\nrepresent real historical personages is a matter about which we may\r\nalmost be said neither to know nor care. We see that it begins in the\r\napproved fashion with 'Non puri homines sed semidei id est Anses[44],'\r\nand that the first of these half-divine ancestors is named _Gaut_,\r\nevidently the eponymous hero of the Gothic people. Some of the later\r\nlinks--Amal, Ostrogotha, Athal--have the same appearance of names\r\ncoined to embody facts of the national consciousness. At the end of\r\nthe genealogy appear the undoubtedly historical names of the immediate\r\nancestors of Theodoric. It is noteworthy that several, in fact the\r\nmajority of the names of Kings who figure in early Gothic history, are\r\nnot included in this genealogy. While this fact permits us to doubt\r\nwhether Cassiodorus has not exaggerated the pre-eminence of the Amal\r\nrace in early days, it must be admitted to be also an evidence of the\r\ngood faith with which he preserved the national tradition on these\r\npoints. Had he been merely inventing, it would have been easy to\r\ninclude every name of a distinguished Gothic King among the\r\nprogenitors of his Sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Jordanes, De Reb. Get. xiii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abstract by Jordanes.]\r\n\r\nSuch then was the general purpose of the Gothic History of\r\nCassiodorus. The book itself has perished--a tantalising loss when we\r\nconsider how many treatises from the same pen have been preserved to\r\nus which we could well have spared. But we can speak, as will be seen\r\nfrom the preceding remarks, with considerable confidence as to its\r\nplan and purpose, because we possess in the well-known treatise of\r\nJordanes 'On the Origin of the Goths[45]' an abbreviated copy,\r\nexecuted it is true by a very inferior hand, but still manifestly\r\npreserving some of the features of the original. It will not be\r\nnecessary here to go into the difficult question as to the personality\r\nof this writer, which has been debated at considerable length and with\r\nmuch ingenuity by several German authors[46]. It is enough to say that\r\nJordanes, who was, according to his own statement, 'agrammatus,' a man\r\nof Gothic descent, a notary, and then a monk[47], on the alleged\r\nrequest of his friend Castalius, 'compressed the twelve books of\r\nSenator, _de origine actibusque Getarum_, bringing down the history\r\nfrom olden times to our own days by kings and generations, into one\r\nlittle pamphlet.' Still, according to his statement, which there can\r\nbe little doubt is here thoroughly false, he had the loan of the\r\nGothic History for only three days from the steward of Cassiodorus,\r\nand wrote chiefly or entirely from his recollection of this hasty\r\nperusal[48]. He says that he added some suitable passages from the\r\nGreek and Latin historians, but his own range of historical reading\r\nwas evidently so narrow that we may fairly suspect these additions to\r\nhave been of the slenderest possible dimensions. Upon the whole, there\r\ncan be little doubt that it is a safe rule to attribute everything\r\nthat is good or passable in this little treatise to Cassiodorus, and\r\neverything that is very bad, childish, and absurd in it to Jordanes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: 'De Rebus Geticis,' or 'De Gothorum Origine,' is the\r\nname by which this little treatise is usually known. It seems to be\r\ndoubtful, however, what title, if any, Jordanes himself prefixed to\r\nit. Mommsen calls it simply 'Getica.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Especially Schirren, 'De Ratione quae inter Jordanem et\r\nCassiodorum intercedat' (Dorpat, 1858); Sybel, 'De Fontibus Libri\r\nJordanis' (Berlin, 1838); and Köpke, 'Die Anfänge des Königthums bei\r\nden Gothen' (Berlin, 1859).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Possibly_ in the end Bishop of Crotona, or a Defensor\r\nof the Roman Church, since we find a Jordanes in each of these\r\npositions; but this is mere guesswork, and to me neither theory seems\r\nprobable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: 'Sed ut non mentiar, ad triduanam lectionem\r\ndispensatoris ejus beneficio libros ipsos antehac relegi.'\r\nNotwithstanding the 'ut non mentiar,' most of those who have enquired\r\ninto the subject have come to the opinion which is bluntly expressed\r\nby Usener (p. 73), 'Die dreitägige Frist die Jordanes zur Benutzung\r\nder 12 Bücher gehabt haben will, _ist natürlich Schwindel_.' Even by\r\nan expert précis-writer a loan of three months would be much more\r\nprobably needed for the purpose indicated by Jordanes than one of\r\nthree days.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary retirement from official life (?).]\r\n\r\nThe literary labours of Cassiodorus, of which the Gothic History was\r\none of the fruits, were probably continued for two or three years\r\nafter its completion[49]. At least there is reason to believe that he\r\nwas not actively engaged in the service of the State during those\r\nterrible years (524 and 525) in which the failing intellect of\r\nTheodoric, goaded almost to madness by Justin's persecution of his\r\nArian co-religionists, condescended to ignoble measures of\r\nretaliation, which brought him into collision with Senate and Pope,\r\nand in the end tarnished his fame by the judicial murder of Boethius\r\nand Symmachus. It was fortunate indeed for Cassiodorus if he was\r\nduring this time, perhaps because of his unwillingness to help the\r\nKing to his own hurt, enjoying an interval of literary retirement at\r\nSquillace. His honour must have suffered if he had abetted the\r\nintolerant policy of Theodoric; his life might have been forfeit if he\r\nhad openly opposed it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: This was probably 521 at latest.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus as Master of the Offices, 526.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the cause of the temporary obscuration of\r\nCassiodorus, he was soon again shining in all the splendour of\r\nofficial dignity; for when Theodoric died, his old and trusted\r\nminister was holding--probably not for the first time in his official\r\ncareer[50]--the great place of Master of the Offices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: The language of Cassiodorus in Var. ix. 24 implies that\r\nhe had held this office for a considerable time before the death of\r\nTheodoric. Usener thinks that he was made Magister Officiorum for the\r\nfirst time about the year 518.]\r\n\r\nThe _Magister Officiorum_, whose relation to the other members of the\r\nCabinet of the Sovereign was somewhat indefinite, and who was in fact\r\nconstantly trying to enlarge the circle of his authority at their\r\nexpense, was at the head of the Civil Service of the Roman Empire, and\r\nafterwards occupied a similar position in the Ostrogothic State. It\r\nwas said of him by the Byzantine orator Priscus (himself a man who had\r\nbeen engaged in important embassies), 'Of all the counsels of the\r\nEmperor the Magister is a partaker, inasmuch as the messengers and\r\ninterpreters and the soldiers employed on guard at the palace are\r\nranged under him.' Quite in harmony with this general statement are\r\nthe more precise indications of the 'Notitia.' There, 'under the\r\ndisposition of the illustrious Magister Officiorum,' we find five\r\n_Scholae_, which seem to have been composed of household troops[51].\r\nThen comes the great Schola of the _Agentes in rebus_ and their\r\ndeputies--a mighty army of 'king's messengers,' who swarmed through\r\nall the Provinces of the Empire, executing the orders of the\r\nSovereign, and earning gold and hatred from the helpless Provincials\r\namong whom their errands lay. In addition to these the four great\r\nstationary bureaux--the Scrinium Memoriae, Scrinium Dispositionum,\r\nScrinium Epistolarum, and Scrinium Libellorum--the offices whose duty\r\nit was to conduct the correspondence of the Sovereign with foreign\r\npowers, and to answer the petitions of his own subjects, all owned the\r\nMaster of the Offices as their head. Moreover, the great arsenals (of\r\nwhich there were six in Italy at Concordia, Verona, Mantua, Cremona,\r\nTicinum, and Lucca) received their orders from the same official. An\r\nanomalous and too widely dispersed range of functions this seems\r\naccording to our ideas, including something of the Secretaryship for\r\nForeign Affairs, something of the Home Secretaryship, and something of\r\nthe War Office and the Horse Guards. Yet, as if this were not enough,\r\nthere was also transferred to him from the office of the Praetorian\r\nPraefect the superintendence of the Cursus Publicus, that excellent\r\ninstitution by which facilities for intercourse were provided between\r\nthe capital and the most distant Provinces, relays of post-horses\r\nbeing kept at every town, available for use by those who bore properly\r\nsigned 'letters of evection.' Thus to the multifarious duties of the\r\nMaster of the Offices was added in effect the duty of\r\nPostmaster-General. It was found however in practice to be an\r\ninconvenient arrangement for the Master of the Offices to have the\r\ncontrol of the services of the 'public horses,' while the Praetorian\r\nPraefect remained responsible for the supply of their food; and the\r\ncharge of the _Cursus Publicus_ was accordingly retransferred--at any\r\nrate in the Eastern Empire--to the office of the Praefect, though the\r\nletters of evection still required the counter-signature of the\r\nMaster[52].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: They are 'Scutariorum prima, secunda et tertia,\r\narmaturarum seniorum et gentilium seniorum' (Notitia Occidentis, cap.\r\nix.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: This is the account of the matter given by Lydus (De\r\nMagistratibus ii. 10); but as the Notitia (Or. xi.) puts the 'Curiosus\r\nCursus Publici Praesentalis' under the disposition of the Magister\r\nOfficiorum, the retransfer had probably not then taken place. It would\r\nseem also from the Formula of Cassiodorus (Var. vi. 6) that in his\r\ntime the Magister Officiorum still had the charge of the Cursus\r\nPublicus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Theodoric, Aug. 30, 526.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of Cassiodorus when, on the 30th of August, 526,\r\nby the death of Theodoric, he lost the master whom he had served so\r\nlong and so faithfully. The difficulties which beset the new reign are\r\npretty clearly indicated in the letters which Cassiodorus published in\r\nthe name of the young King Athalaric, Theodoric's grandson, and which\r\nare to be found in the Eighth Book of the 'Variae.' Athalaric himself\r\nbeing only a boy of eight or ten years of age, supreme power was\r\nvested in his mother Amalasuentha, with what title we are unable to\r\nsay, but apparently not with that of Queen. This Princess, a woman of\r\ngreat and varied accomplishments, perhaps once a pupil, certainly a\r\nfriend, of Cassiodorus, ruled entirely in accordance with the maxims\r\nof his statesmanship, and endeavoured with female impulsiveness to\r\ncarry into effect his darling scheme of Romanising the Goths. During\r\nthe whole of her regency we may doubtless consider Cassiodorus as\r\nvirtually her Prime Minister, and the eight years which it occupied\r\nwere without doubt that portion of his life in which he exercised the\r\nmost direct and unquestioned influence on State affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Services of Cassiodorus to the Regent Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\nHis services at the commencement of the new reign will be best\r\ndescribed in his own words: 'Nostris quoque principiis[53]' (the\r\nletter is written in Athalaric's name) 'quanto se labore concessit,\r\ncum novitas regni multa posceret ordinari? Erat solus ad universa\r\nsufficiens. Ipsum dictatio publica, ipsum consilia nostra poscebant;\r\net labore ejus actum est ne laboraret imperium. _Reperimus eum quidem\r\nMagistrum sed implevit nobis Quaestoris officium_: et mercedes\r\njustissima devotione persolvens, cautelam, quam ab auctore nostro\r\ndidicerat, libenter haeredis utilitatibus exhibebat[54].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Variarum ix. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: The meaning apparently is: 'The experience which he had\r\ngained in Theodoric's service was employed for the advantage of his\r\ngrandson.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fears of invasion.]\r\n\r\nCassiodorus then goes on to describe how he laboured for his young\r\nSovereign with the sword as well as with the pen. Some hostile\r\ninvasion was dreaded, perhaps from the Franks, or, more probably, from\r\nthe Vandals, whose relations with the Ostrogoths at that time were\r\nstrained, owing to the murder of Theodoric's sister Amalafrida by\r\nHilderic the Vandal King. Cassiodorus provided ships and equipped\r\nsoldiers at his own expense, probably for the defence of his beloved\r\nProvince of Bruttii. The alarm of war passed away, but difficulties\r\nappear to have arisen owing to the sudden cancellation of the\r\ncontracts which had been entered into when hostilities seemed\r\nimminent; and to these difficulties Cassiodorus tells us that he\r\nbrought his trained experience as an administrator and a judge,\r\nresolving them so as to give satisfaction to all who were concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus as Praetorian Praefect, 533.]\r\n\r\nSeven years of Amalasuentha's regency thus passed, and now at length,\r\nat fifty-three years of age, Cassiodorus was promoted (Sept. 1, 533)\r\nto the most distinguished place which a subject could occupy. He\r\nreceived from Amalasuentha the office of Praetorian Praefect. As\r\nthirty-three years had elapsed since his father was invested with the\r\nsame dignity, we may fairly conjecture that father and son both\r\nclimbed this eminence at the same period of their lives; yet,\r\nconsidering the extraordinary credit which the younger Cassiodorus\r\nenjoyed at Court, we might have expected that he would have been\r\nclothed with the Praefecture before he attained the fifty-third year\r\nof his age. And, in fact, he hints in the letter composed by him, in\r\nwhich he informs himself of his own elevation[55], that that elevation\r\nhad been somewhat too long delayed, though the reason which he alleges\r\nfor the delay (namely, that the people might greet the new Praefect\r\nthe more heartily[56]) is upon the face of it not the true cause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Var. ix. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: 'Diutius quidem differendo pro te cunctorum vota\r\nlassavimus, ut benevolentiam in te probaremus generalitatis, et\r\ncunctis desiderabilior advenires.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Office of the Praetorian Praefect.]\r\n\r\nThe majesty of the Praetorian Praefect's office is fully dwelt upon\r\nand its functions described in a letter in the following\r\ncollection[57], to which the reader is referred. Originally only the\r\nchief officer of those Praetorian troops in Rome by whom the Emperor\r\nwas guarded, until, as was so often the case, he was in some fit of\r\npetulance by the same pampered sentinels dethroned, the Praefectus\r\nPraetorio had gradually become more and more of a judge, less and less\r\nof a soldier. In the great changes wrought by Constantine the\r\nPraetorian guards disappeared--somewhat in the same fashion after\r\nwhich the Janissaries were removed by Sultan Mahmoud. The Praetorian\r\nPraefect's dignity, however, survived, and though he lost every shred\r\nof military command he became or continued to be the first civil\r\nservant of the Empire. Cassiodorus is fond of comparing him to Joseph\r\nat the Court of Pharaoh, nor is the comparison an inapt one. In the\r\nConstantinople of our own day the Grand Vizier holds a position not\r\naltogether unlike that which the Praefect held in the Court of\r\nArcadius and Theodosius. 'The office of this Praefect,' said one who\r\nhad spent his life as one of his subordinates[58],' is like the Ocean,\r\nencircling all other offices and ministering to all their needs. The\r\nConsulate is indeed higher in rank than the Praefecture, but less in\r\npower. The Praefect wears a _mandye_, or woollen cloak, dyed with the\r\npurple of Cos, and differing from the Emperor's only in the fact that\r\nit reaches not to the feet but to the knees. Girt with his sword he\r\ntakes his seat as President of the Senate. When that body has\r\nassembled, the chiefs of the army fall prostrate before the Praefect,\r\nwho raises them and kisses each in turn, in order to express his\r\ndesire to be on good terms with the military power. Nay, even the\r\nEmperor himself walks (or till lately used to walk) on foot from his\r\npalace to meet the Praefect as he moves slowly towards him at the head\r\nof the Senate. The insignia of the Praefect's office are his lofty\r\nchariot, his golden reed-case [pen-holder], weighing one hundred\r\npounds, his massive silver inkstand, and silver bowl on a tripod of\r\nthe same metal to receive the petitions of suitors. Three official\r\nyachts wait upon his orders, and convey him from the capital to the\r\nneighbouring Provinces.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Var. vi. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Joannes Lydus, De Dignitatibus ii. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Praetorian Praefect as Judge of Appeal.]\r\n\r\nThe personage thus highly placed had a share in the government of the\r\nState, a share which the Master of the Offices was for ever trying to\r\ndiminish, but which, in the hands of one who like Cassiodorus was\r\n_persona grata_ at the Court, might be made not only important but\r\npredominant[59]. The chief employment, however, of the ordinary\r\nPraefectus Praetorio consisted in hearing appeals from the Governors\r\nof the Provinces. When the magical words 'Provoco ad Caesarem' had\r\nbeen uttered, it was in most cases before the Praetorian Praefect that\r\nthe appeal was practically heard; and when the Praetorian Praefect had\r\npronounced his decision, no appeal from that was permitted, even to\r\nthe Emperor himself[60].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Bethmann Hollweg (pp. 75, 76) enumerates the functions\r\nof the Praetorian Praefect thus: '(1) _Legislative._ He promulgated\r\nthe Imperial laws, and issued edicts which had almost the force of\r\nlaws. (2) _Financial._ The general tax (indictio, delegatio) ordered\r\nby the Emperor for the year, was proclaimed by each Praefect for his\r\nown Praefecture. Through his officials he took part in the levy of the\r\ntax, and had a special State-chest (arca praetoria) for the proceeds.\r\n(3) _Administrative._ The Praefect proposed the names of provincial\r\ngovernors, handed to them their salaries, had a general oversight of\r\nthem, issued rescripts on the information furnished by them, and could\r\nas their ordinary Judge inflict punishments upon them, even depose\r\nthem from their offices, and temporarily nominate substitutes to act\r\nin their places. (4) _Judicial_, as the highest Judge of Appeal.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: See authorities quoted by Bethmann Hollweg, pp. 79, 80.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters written during the Praefecture of Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\nCassiodorus held the post of Praetorian Praefect, amid various changes\r\nin the fortunes of the State, from 533 to 538, or perhaps a year or\r\ntwo longer. Of his activity in the domain of internal administration,\r\nthe Eleventh and Twelfth Books of the 'Variae' give a vivid and\r\ninteresting picture. Unfortunately, neither those books nor the Tenth\r\nBook of the same collection, which contains the letters written by him\r\nduring the same time in the names of the successive Gothic Sovereigns,\r\ngive any sufficient information as to the real course of public\r\nevents. Great misfortunes, great crimes, and the movements of great\r\narmies are covered over in these documents by a veil of unmeaning\r\nplatitudes and hypocritical compliments. In order to enable the\r\nstudent to 'read between the lines,' and to pierce through the\r\nverbiage of these letters to the facts which they were meant to hint\r\nat or to conceal, it will be necessary briefly to describe the\r\npolitical history of the period as we learn it from the narratives of\r\nProcopius and Jordanes--narratives which may be inaccurate in a few\r\nminor details but are doubtless correct in their main outlines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition to Romanising policy of Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\nThe Romanising policy of the cultivated but somewhat self-willed\r\nPrincess Amalasuentha met with considerable opposition on the part of\r\nher Gothic subjects. Above all, they objected to the bookish education\r\nwhich she was giving to her son, the young King. They declared that it\r\nwas entirely contrary to the maxims of Theodoric that a young Goth\r\nshould be trembling before the strap of a pedagogue when he ought to\r\nbe learning to look unfalteringly on spear and sword. These\r\nrepresentations were so vigorously made, and by speakers of such high\r\nrank in the State, that Amalasuentha was compelled to listen to them,\r\nto remove her son from the society of his teachers, and to allow him\r\nto associate with companions of his own age, who, not being wisely\r\nchosen, soon initiated him in every kind of vice and dissipation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amalasuentha puts three Gothic nobles to death.]\r\n\r\nThe Princess, who had not forgiven the leaders of the Gothic party for\r\ntheir presumptuously offered counsels, singled out three of the most\r\npowerful nobles who were at the head of that party and sent them into\r\nhonourable banishment at the opposite ends of Italy. Finding, however,\r\nthat they were still holding communication with one another, she sent\r\nto the Emperor Justinian to ask if he would give her an asylum in his\r\ndominions if she required it, and then gave orders for the secret\r\nassassination of the three noblemen. The _coup d'état_ succeeded: she\r\nhad no need to flee the country; and the ship bearing the royal\r\ntreasure, which amounted to 40,000 pounds weight of gold, which she\r\nhad sent to Dyrrhachium to await her possible flight, was ordered to\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embassies between Ravenna and Constantinople.]\r\n\r\nAthalaric's health was now rapidly failing, owing to his licentious\r\nexcesses, and Amalasuentha, fearing that after his death her own life\r\nmight be in danger, began again secretly to negotiate with Justinian\r\nfor the entire surrender of the kingdom of Italy into his hands, on\r\nreceiving an assurance of shelter and maintenance at the Court of\r\nByzantium. These negotiations were masked by others of a more public\r\nkind, in which Justinian claimed the Sicilian fortress of Lilybaeum,\r\nwhich had once belonged to the Vandals; insisted on the surrender of\r\nsome Huns, deserters from the army of Africa; and demanded redress for\r\nthe sack by the Goths of the Moesian city of Gratiana. These claims\r\nAmalasuentha met publicly with a reply as brave and uncompromising as\r\nher most patriotic subjects could desire, but in private, as has been\r\nalready said, she was prepared, for an adequate assurance of personal\r\nsafety, to barter away all the rights and liberties of her Italian\r\nsubjects, Roman as well as Gothic, and to allow her father's\r\nhard-earned kingdom to sink into a mere dependency of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Athalaric, Oct. 2, 534.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs when on the 2nd October 534, little\r\nmore than a year after Cassiodorus had donned the purple of the\r\nPraefect, Athalaric died, and by his death the whole attitude of the\r\nparties to the negotiations was changed. The power to rule, and with\r\nit the very power to make terms of any kind with the Emperor, was in\r\ndanger of slipping from the hands of Amalasuentha. The principle of\r\nfemale sovereignty was barely accepted by any Teutonic tribe.\r\nEvidently the Ostrogoths had not accepted it, or Amalasuentha would\r\nhave ruled as Queen in her own right instead of as Regent for her son.\r\nIn order to strengthen her position, and ensure her acceptance as\r\nSovereign by the Gothic warriors, she decided to associate with\r\nherself, not in matrimony, for he was already married, but in regal\r\npartnership, her cousin Theodahad, the nearest male heir of Theodoric,\r\nand to mount the throne together with him. Previously, however, to\r\nannouncing this scheme in public, she sent for Theodahad and exacted\r\nfrom him 'tremendous oaths[61]' that if he were chosen King he would\r\nbe satisfied with the mere name of royalty, leaving her as much of the\r\nactual substance of power as she possessed at that moment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: [Greek: horkois deinotatois].]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amalasuentha associates Theodahad in the Sovereignty.]\r\n\r\nThe partnership-royalty and the oath of self-abnegation were the\r\ndesperate expedients of a woman who knew herself to have mighty\r\nenemies among her subjects, and who felt power slipping from her\r\ngrasp. With one side of her character her new partner could\r\nsympathise; for Theodahad, though sprung from the loins of Gothic\r\nwarriors, was a man of some literary culture, who preferred poring\r\nover the 'Republic' of Plato to heading a charge of the Gothic\r\ncavalry. But his acquaintance with Latin and Greek literature had done\r\nnothing to ennoble his temper or expand his heart. A cold, hard,\r\navaricious soul, he had been entirely bent on adding field to field\r\nand removing his neighbour's landmark, until the vast possessions\r\nwhich he had received from the generosity of Theodoric should embrace\r\nthe whole of the great Tuscan plain. It will be seen by referring to\r\ntwo letters in the following collection[62] that Theodoric himself had\r\ntwice employed the pen of Cassiodorus to rebuke the rapacity of his\r\nnephew; and at a more recent date, since the beginning of Athalaric's\r\nillness, Amalasuentha had been compelled by the complaints of her\r\nTuscan subjects to issue a commission of enquiry, which had found\r\nTheodahad guilty of the various acts of land-robbery which had been\r\ncharged against him, and had compelled him to make restitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Variarum iv. 39 and v. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amalasuentha is deposed and imprisoned by Theodahad, April\r\n30, 535.]\r\n\r\nThe new Queen persuaded herself, and tried to persuade her cousin,\r\nthat this ignominious sentence had in some way put the subject of it\r\nstraight with the world, and had smoothed his pathway to the throne.\r\nShe trusted to his gratitude and his tremendous oaths for her own\r\nundisturbed position at the helm of the State, but she found before\r\nmany months of the joint reign had passed that the reed upon which she\r\nwas leaning was about to pierce her hand. Only four letters, it will\r\nbe seen, of the following collection were written by order of\r\nAmalasuentha after the commencement of the joint reign. Soon Theodahad\r\nfelt himself strong enough to hurl from the throne the woman who had\r\ndared to compel him to draw back the boundary of his Tuscan\r\n_latifundium._ The relations of the three noblemen whom Amalasuentha\r\nhad put to death gathered gladly round him, eager to work out the\r\nblood-feud; and by their help he slew many of the strongest supporters\r\nof the Queen, and shut her up in prison in a little lonely island upon\r\nthe lake of Vulsinii. This event took place on the 30th of April, 535,\r\nnot quite seven months after the death of Athalaric[63].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: The dates of the death of Athalaric and deposition of\r\nAmalasuentha are given by Agnellus in his Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae\r\nRavennatis, p. 322 (in the edition comprised in the Monumenta\r\nGermaniae Historica).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embassy of Peter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\nDuring all these later months there had been a perpetual flux and\r\nreflux of diplomatic communications between Ravenna and\r\nConstantinople. The different stages of the negotiations are marked,\r\napparently with clearness, by Procopius; but it is not always easy to\r\nharmonise them with the letters published by Cassiodorus, who either\r\ndid not write, or shrank from republishing, some of the most important\r\nletters to the Emperor. This remark applies to the missive which was\r\nprobably taken by the Senators Liberius and Opilio, who were now sent\r\nby Theodahad to Justinian to apologise for the imprisonment of\r\nAmalasuentha, and to promise that she should receive no injury.\r\nMeanwhile Peter, a rhetorician and an ex-Consul, was travelling from\r\nConstantinople with a commission the character of which was being\r\nconstantly changed by the rapid current of events. He started with\r\ninstructions to complete the transaction with Amalasuentha as to the\r\nsurrender of Italy, and to buy from Theodahad, who was still a private\r\nindividual, his possessions in Tuscany. Soon after his departure he\r\nmet the ambassadors, who told him of the death of Athalaric and the\r\naccession of Theodahad. On the shores of the Hadriatic he heard of\r\nAmalasuentha's captivity. He waited for further instructions from his\r\nmaster, and on his arrival at Ravenna he found that all was over. The\r\nletter which he was to have handed to the deposed Queen, assuring her\r\nof Justinian's protection, was already obsolete. The kinsmen of the\r\nthree nobles had been permitted or encouraged by Theodahad to end the\r\nblood-feud bloodily. They had repaired to the Lake of Vulsinii and\r\nmurdered Amalasuentha in her bath[64]. The Byzantine ambassador sought\r\nthe presence of the King, boldly denounced his wicked deed, and\r\ndeclared on the part of his master a war which would be waged without\r\ntruce or treaty till Amalasuentha was avenged. Thus began the eighteen\r\nyears' war between Justinian and the Ostrogoths.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: We do not seem to have the precise date of the death of\r\nAmalasuentha, but apparently it happened about the month of May, 535.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why did Cassiodorus continue in the service of Theodahad?]\r\n\r\nIt might certainly have been expected that a statesman who had been\r\nhonoured with the intimate friendship of Theodoric and his daughter,\r\neven if unable to avenge her death, would have refused to serve in the\r\nCabinet of her murderer. It is accordingly with a feeling of painful\r\nsurprise that we find Cassiodorus still holding the Secretary's pen,\r\nand writing letter after letter (they form the majority of the\r\ndocuments in the Tenth Book of the 'Variae') in the name of Theodahad\r\nand his wife Gudelina. Dangers no doubt were thickening round his\r\nbeloved Italy. He may have thought that whoever wore the Gothic crown,\r\nDuty forbade him to quit the Secretum at Ravenna just when war with\r\nthe Empire was becoming every day more imminent. On the other hand,\r\nthe Praetorian Praefecture, the object of a life's ambition, was now\r\nhis, but had been his only for two years. It was hard to lay aside the\r\npurple _mandye_ while the first gloss was yet upon it; hard to have to\r\nfall back into the ranks of the ordinary senators, and no longer to\r\nreceive the reverent salutations of the chiefs of the army when he\r\nentered the hall of meeting. Whether the public good or the private\r\nadvantage swayed him most who shall say? There are times when\r\npatriotism calls for the costliest sacrifice which a statesman can\r\nmake--the sacrifice, apparently, of his own honour. The man who has\r\nmade such a sacrifice must be content to be misjudged by his\r\nfellow-men. Certainly, to us the one stain upon an otherwise pure\r\nreputation seems to be found in the service, the apparently willing\r\nservice, which in the Tenth Book of his letters Cassiodorus renders to\r\nTheodahad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vacillation of Theodahad.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the latter half of 535, Belisarius in Sicily and Mundus in\r\nDalmatia were warring for Justinian against Theodahad. The rhetorician\r\nPeter, who had boldly rebuked the Gothic King for the murder of his\r\nbenefactress, and had on his master's behalf denounced a truceless war\r\nagainst him, still lingered at his Court. Theodahad, who during part\r\nof the summer and autumn of 535 seems to have been at Rome, not at\r\nRavenna, was more than half inclined to resume his old negotiations\r\nwith the Emperor, and either to purchase peace by sinking into the\r\ncondition of a tributary, or to sell his kingdom outright for a\r\nrevenue of £48,000 a year and a high place among the nobles of the\r\nEmpire. Procopius[65] gives us a vivid and detailed narrative of the\r\nmanner in which these negotiations were conducted by Theodahad, who\r\nwas perpetually wavering between arrogance and timidity; trembling at\r\nthe successes of Belisarius, elated by any victory which his generals\r\nmight win in Dalmatia; and who at length, upon receiving the tidings\r\nof the defeat and death of Mundus, broke off the negotiations\r\naltogether, and shut up Peter and his colleague Athanasius in prison.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: De Bello Gotthico, i. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Silence of the 'Variae' as to many of the negotiations\r\nbetween Theodahad and Justinian.]\r\n\r\nHere again, while not doubting the truth of the narrative of\r\nProcopius, I do not find it possible exactly to fit in the letters\r\nwritten by Cassiodorus for Theodahad with the various stages of the\r\nnegotiation as described by him. Especially the striking letter of the\r\nKing to the Emperor--striking by reason of its very abjectness--which\r\nis quoted by Procopius in the sixth chapter of his First Book, appears\r\nto be entirely unrepresented in the collection of Cassiodorus.\r\nEvidently all this part of the 'Variae' has been severely edited by\r\nits author, who has expunged all that seemed to reflect too great\r\ndiscredit on the Sovereign whom he had once served, and has preserved\r\nonly some letters written to Justinian and Theodora by Theodahad and\r\nhis wife, vaguely praising peace, and beseeching the Imperial pair to\r\nrestore it to Italy; letters which, as it seems to me, may be applied\r\nwith about equal fitness to any movement of the busy shuttle of\r\ndiplomacy backwards and forwards between Ravenna and Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theodahad deposed, Witigis elected, Aug. 536.]\r\n\r\nThe onward march of Belisarius trampled all the combinations of\r\ndiplomatists into the dust. In the early part of July, 536, he had\r\nsucceeded in capturing the important city of Neapolis, and had begun\r\nto threaten Rome. The Gothic warriors, disgusted at the incapacity of\r\ntheir King, and probably suspecting his disloyalty to the nation, met\r\n(August, 536) under arms upon the plain of Regeta[66], deposed\r\nTheodahad, and elected a veteran named Witigis as his successor.\r\nWitigis at once ordered Theodahad to be put to death, and being\r\nhimself of somewhat obscure lineage, endeavoured to strengthen his\r\ntitle to the crown by marrying Matasuentha, the sister of Athalaric\r\nand the only surviving descendant of Theodoric.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The situation of this plain is unknown.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter on the elevation of Witigis.]\r\n\r\nWhether Cassiodorus had any hand in this revolution--which was\r\npre-eminently a Gothic movement--we cannot tell; but certainly one of\r\nthe best specimens of his letters is that written in the name of the\r\nnew King[67], in which he makes Witigis thus speak, 'Universis\r\nGothis'--not as Theodoric had so often spoken, 'Universis Gothis et\r\nRomanis:'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Var. x. 31.]\r\n\r\n'Unde Auctori nostro Christo gratias humillimâ satisfactione\r\nreferentes, indicamus parentes nostros Gothos inter procinctuales\r\ngladios, more majorum, scuto supposito, regalem nobis contulisse,\r\npraestante Deo, dignitatem, ut honorem arma darent, cujus opinionem\r\nbella pepererant. Non enim in cubilis angustis, sed in campis latè\r\npatentibus electum me esse noveritis: nec inter blandientium delicata\r\ncolloquia, sed tubis concrepantibus sum quaesitus, ut tali fremitu\r\nconcitatus desiderio virtutis ingenitae regem sibi Martium Geticus\r\npopulus inveniret.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters written in name of Witigis.]\r\n\r\nWe have only five letters written by Cassiodorus for Witigis (who\r\nreigned from August, 536, to May[68], 540). One has been already\r\ndescribed. All the other four are concerned with negotiations for\r\npeace with Justinian, and may probably be referred to the early part\r\nof the new reign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: We get this date only from Agnellus (loc. cit. p. 522).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Share of Cassiodorus in the administration during the war.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the letters written by Cassiodorus for the\r\nSovereign during the five years following the death of Athalaric are\r\nfew and somewhat unsatisfactory. But, on the other hand, it was just\r\nduring these years that he wrote in his own name as Praetorian\r\nPraefect the letters which are comprised in the Eleventh and Twelfth\r\nBooks of his collection, and which are in some respects the most\r\ninteresting of the whole series. There is a strong probability that he\r\nwas not present at the long siege of Rome (March, 537, to March, 538),\r\nnor is it likely that he, an elderly civilian, would take much part in\r\nany of the warlike operations that followed. Upon the whole, it seems\r\nprobable that during the greater part of this time Cassiodorus was, to\r\nthe best of his power, keeping the civil administration together by\r\nvirtue of his own authority as Praetorian Praefect, without that\r\nconstant reference to the wishes of the Sovereign which would have\r\nbeen necessary under Theodoric and his daughter. Perhaps, in the\r\ntransitional state of things which then prevailed in Italy, with the\r\npower of the Gothic sceptre broken but the sway of the Roman Caesar\r\nnot yet firmly established in its stead, men of all parties and both\r\nnationalities were willing that as much as possible of the routine of\r\ngovernment should be carried on by a statesman who was Roman by birth\r\nand culture, but who had been the trusted counsellor of Gothic Kings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dates of later letters.]\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured as far as possible to fix the dates of these later\r\nletters. It will be seen that we have one[69] probably belonging to\r\nthe year 536, five[70] to 537, and one[71] (possibly) to 538. These\r\nlater letters refer chiefly to the terrible famine which followed in\r\nthe train of the war, and of which Cassiodorus strenuously laboured to\r\nmitigate the severity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Var. xii. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Var. xii. 22, 23, 24, 27, 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Var. xii. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Cassiodorus' official career.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Praefect may have continued to hold office\r\ndown to the capture of Ravenna in May, 540, which made Witigis a\r\nprisoner, and seemed to bring the Ostrogothic monarchy to an end. Upon\r\nthe whole, however, it is rather more probable that in the year 538\r\nor 539 he finally retired from public life. The dates of his letters\r\nwill show that there is nothing in them which forbids us to accept\r\nthis conclusion; and the fact, if it be a fact, that in 540, when\r\nBelisarius, with his Secretary Procopius in his train, made his\r\ntriumphal entry into Ravenna, the late Praefect was no longer there,\r\nbut in his native Province of Bruttii, a little lessens the difficulty\r\nof that which still remains most difficult of comprehension, the\r\nentire omission from Procopius' History of the Gothic War of all\r\nmention of the name of Cassiodorus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Variae edited.]\r\n\r\nThe closing years of the veteran statesman's tenure of office were\r\nyears of some literary activity. It was in them that he was\r\ncollecting, and to some extent probably revising, the letters which\r\nappear in the following collection. His motives for publishing this\r\nmonument of his official life are sufficiently set forth in the two\r\nprefaces, one prefixed to the First Book and the other to the\r\nEleventh. Much emphasis is laid on the entreaties of his friends, the\r\nregular excuse, in the sixth century as in the nineteenth, for an\r\nauthor or a politician doing the very thing which most pleases his own\r\nvanity. A worthier reason probably existed in the author's natural\r\ndesire to vindicate his own consistency, by showing that the influence\r\nwhich for more than thirty years he had wielded in the councils of the\r\nGothic Sovereigns had been uniformly exerted on the side of law and\r\norder and just government, directed equally to the repression of\r\nTeutonic barbarism and the punishment of Roman venality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What alterations were made in the letters.]\r\n\r\nThe question how far the letters which now appear in the 'Variae'\r\nreally reproduce the actual documents originally issued by Cassiodorus\r\nis one which has been a good deal discussed by scholars, but with no\r\nvery definite result. It is, after all, a matter of conjecture; and\r\nevery student who peruses the following letters is entitled to form\r\nhis own conjecture--especially as to those marvellous digressions on\r\nmatters of Natural History, Moral Philosophy, and the like--whether\r\nthey were veritably included in the original letters that issued from\r\nthe Royal Secretum, and were carried over Italy by the Cursus\r\nPublicus. My own conjecture is, that though they may have been a\r\nlittle amplified and elaborated, substantially they were to be found\r\nin those original documents. The age was pedantic and half-educated,\r\nand had lost both its poetic inspiration and its faculty of humour;\r\nand I fear that these marvellous letters were read by the officials to\r\nwhom they were addressed with a kind of stolid admiration, provoking\r\nneither the smile of amusement nor the shrug of impatience which are\r\ntheir rightful meed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 'Illum atque Illum.']\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that in many, in fact most of the letters,\r\nwhich were meant to serve as credentials to ambassadors or commissions\r\nto civil servants, no names are inserted, but we have instead only the\r\ntantalising formula, 'Illum atque Illum,' which I have generally\r\ntranslated, 'A and B.' This circumstance has also been much commented\r\nupon, but without our arriving at any very definite result. All that\r\ncan be said is, that Cassiodorus must have formed his collection of\r\nState-papers either from rough drafts in his own possession, or from\r\ncopies preserved in the public archives, and that, from whichsoever\r\nsource he drew, the names in that source had not been preserved: a\r\nstriking comment on the rhetorical unbusinesslike character of the\r\nRoyal and Imperial Chanceries of that day, in which words were deemed\r\nof more importance than things, and the flowers of speech which were\r\nshowered upon the performer of some piece of public business were\r\npreserved, while the name of the performer was forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatise 'De Animâ.']\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had finished the collection of the 'Variae,' the\r\nPraefect--again in obedience to the entreaties of his\r\nfriends--composed a short philosophic treatise on the Nature of the\r\nSoul ('De Animâ'). As he said, it seems an absurd thing to treat as a\r\nstranger and an unknown quantity the very centre of our being; to seek\r\nto understand the height of the air, the extent of the earth, the\r\ncauses of storms and earthquakes, and the nature of the wandering\r\nwinds, and yet to leave the faculty, by which we grasp all this\r\nknowledge, itself uncomprehended[72]. He therefore sets himself to\r\nenquire, in twelve chapters:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: 'Cum jam suscepti operis optato fine gauderem, meque\r\nduodecim voluminibus jactatum quietis portus exciperet, ubi etsi non\r\nlaudatus, certe liberatus adveneram, amicorum me suave collegium in\r\nsalum rursus cogitationis expressit, postulans ut aliqua quae tam in\r\nlibris sacris, quam in saecularibus abstrusa compereram de animae\r\nsubstantiâ, vel de ejus virtutibus aperirem, cui datum est tam\r\ningentium rerum secreta reserare: addens nimis ineptum esse si eam per\r\nquam plura cognoscimus, quasi a nobis alienam ignorare patiamur, dum\r\nad anima sit utile nosse qua sapimus' (De Animâ, Praefatio).]\r\n\r\n1. Why the Soul is called Anima?\r\n\r\n2. What is the definition of the Soul?\r\n\r\n3. What is its substantial quality?\r\n\r\n4. If it is to be believed to have any shape?\r\n\r\n5. What moral virtues it has which contribute to its glory and its\r\nadornment?\r\n\r\n6. What are its natural virtues [or powers], given to enable it to\r\nhold together the framework of the body?\r\n\r\n7. Concerning the origin of the Soul.\r\n\r\n8. What is its especial seat, since it appears to be in a certain\r\nsense diffused over the whole body?\r\n\r\n9. Concerning the form and composition of the body itself.\r\n\r\n10. Sufficient signs by which we may discern what properties the souls\r\nof sinners possess.\r\n\r\n11. Similar signs by which we may distinguish the souls of righteous\r\nmen, since we cannot see them with our bodily eyes.\r\n\r\n12. Concerning the Soul's state after death, and how it will be\r\naffected by the general resurrection.\r\n\r\nThe treatise ends with a prayer to Christ to preserve the body in good\r\nhealth, that it may be in tune with the harmony of the soul; to give\r\nreason the ascendancy over the flesh; and to keep the mind in happy\r\nequipoise, neither so strong as to be puffed up with pride, nor so\r\nlanguid as to fail of its proper powers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus retires to the cloister.]\r\n\r\nThe line of thought indicated by the 'De Animâ' led, in such a country\r\nas Italy, at such a time as the Gothic War, to one inevitable end--the\r\ncloister. It can have surprised none of the friends of Cassiodorus\r\nwhen the veteran statesman announced his intention of spending the\r\nremainder of his days in monastic retirement. He was now sixty years\r\nof age[73]; his wife, if he had ever married, was probably by this\r\ntime dead; and we hear nothing of any children for whose sake he need\r\nhave remained longer in the world. The Emperor would probably have\r\nreceived him gladly into his service, but Cassiodorus had now done\r\nwith politics. The dream of his life had been to build up an\r\nindependent Italian State, strong with the strength of the Goths, and\r\nwise with the wisdom of the Romans. That dream was now scattered to\r\nthe winds. Providence had made it plain that not by this bridge was\r\ncivilisation to pass over from the Old World to the New. Cassiodorus\r\naccepted the decision, and consecrated his old age to religious\r\nmeditation and to a work even more important than any of his political\r\nlabours (though one which must be lightly touched on here), the\r\npreservation by the pens of monastic copyists of the Christian\r\nScriptures, and of the great works of classical antiquity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Fifty-eight, if the retirement was in 538.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He founds two monasteries at Scyllacium.]\r\n\r\nIt was to his ancestral Scyllacium that Cassiodorus retired; and here,\r\nbetween the mountains of Aspromonte and the sea, he founded his\r\nmonastery, or, more accurately, his two monasteries, one for the\r\naustere hermit, and the other for the less aspiring coenobite. The\r\nformer was situated among the 'sweet recesses of Mons Castellius[74],'\r\nthe latter among the well-watered gardens which took their name from\r\nthe Vivaria (fish-ponds) that Cassiodorus had constructed among them\r\nin connection with the river Pellena[75]. Baths, too, especially\r\nintended for the use of the sick, had been prepared on the banks of\r\nthe stream[76]. Here in monastic simplicity, but not without comfort,\r\nCassiodorus ordained that his monks should dwell. The Rule of the\r\norder--in so far as it had a written Rule--was drawn from the writings\r\nof Cassian, the great founder of Western Monachism, who had died about\r\na century before the Vivarian monastery was founded. In commending the\r\nwritings of Cassian to the study of his monks, Cassiodorus warns them\r\nagainst the bias shown in them towards the Semi-Pelagian heresy, and\r\ndesires them to choose the good in those treatises and to refuse the\r\nevil. Whatever the reason may have been, it seems clear that\r\nCassiodorus did not make the Rule of Benedict the law of his new\r\nmonastery; and indeed, strange as the omission may appear, there is, I\r\nbelieve, no allusion to that great contemporary Saint, the 'Father of\r\nMonks,' in the whole of his writings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: 'Nam si vos in monasterio Vivariensi divinâ gratia\r\nsuffragante coenobiorum consuetudo competenter erudiat, et aliquid\r\nsublimius defaecatis animis optare contingat, habetis mentis Castelli\r\nsecreta suavia, ubi velut anachoritae (praestante Domino) feliciter\r\nesse possitis' (De Inst. Div. Litt. xxix.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: 'Invitat vos locus Vivariensis monasterii ... quando\r\nhabetis hortos irriguos, et piscosi amnis Pellenae fluenta vicina, qui\r\nnec magnitudine undarum suspectus habetur, nec exiguitate temnibilis.\r\nInfluit vobis arte moderatus, ubicunque necessarius judicatur et\r\nhortis vestris sufficiens et molendinis.... Maria quoque vobis ita\r\nsubjacent, ut piscationibus variis pateant; et captus piscis, cum\r\nlibuerit, vivariis possit includi. Fecimus enim illic (juvante Deo)\r\ngrata receptacula ubi sub claustro fideli vagetur piscium multitudo;\r\nita consentanea montium speluncis, ut nullatenus se sentiat captum,\r\ncui libertas eat escas sumere, et per solitas se cavernas\r\nabscondere.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: 'Balnea quoque congruenter aegris praeparata corporibus\r\njussimus aedificari, ubi fontium perspicuitas decenter illabitur, quae\r\net potui gratissima cognoscitur et lavacris.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Probably never Abbot.]\r\n\r\nThough the founder and patron of these two monasteries, it seems\r\nprobable that Cassiodorus never formally assumed the office of Abbot\r\nin either of them[77]. He had probably still some duties to perform as\r\na large landholder in Bruttii; but besides these he had also work to\r\ndo for 'his monks' (as he affectionately called them)--work of a\r\nliterary and educational kind--which perhaps made it undesirable that\r\nhe should be burdened with the petty daily routine of an Abbot's\r\nduties. Some years before, he had endeavoured to induce Pope\r\nAgapetus[78] to found a School of Theology and Christian Literature at\r\nRome, in imitation of the schools of Alexandria and Nisibis[79]. The\r\nclash of arms consequent on the invasion of Italy by Belisarius had\r\nprevented the fulfilment of this scheme; but the aged statesman now\r\ndetermined to devote the remainder of his days to the accomplishment\r\nof the same purpose in connection with the Vivarian convent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: But the words of Trithemius (quoted by Migne, Patrologia\r\nlxix. 498), 'Hic post aliquot conversionis suae annos abbas electus\r\nest, et monasterio multo tempore utiliter praefuit,' _may_ preserve a\r\ngenuine and accurate tradition. Cassiodorus' mention of the two\r\nAbbots, Chalcedonius and Geruntius (De Inst. Div. Litt. cap. xxxii.)\r\nshows that at any rate in the infancy of his monasteries he was not\r\nAbbot of either of them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Agapetus was Pope in 535 and 536.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: 'Nisus sum ergo cum beatissimo Agapeto papa urbis Romae,\r\nut sicut apud Alexandriam multo tempore fuisse traditur institutum,\r\nnunc etiam in Nisibi civitate Syrorum ab Hebraeis sedulo fertur\r\nexponi, collatis expensis in urbe Romana professos doctores scholae\r\npotius acciperent Christianae, unde et anima susciperet aeternam\r\nsalutem, et casto atque purissimo eloquio fidelium lingua comeretur'\r\n(De Inst. Praefatio).]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of Monasticism men like the hermits of the\r\nThebaid had thought of little else but mortifying the flesh by vigils\r\nand fastings, and withdrawing from all human voices to enjoy an\r\necstatic communion with their Maker. The life in common of monks like\r\nthose of Nitria and Lerinum had chastened some of the extravagances of\r\nthese lonely enthusiasts while still keeping their main ends in view.\r\nSt. Jerome, in his cell at Bethlehem, had shown what great results\r\nmight be obtained for the Church of all ages from the patient literary\r\ntoil of one religious recluse. And finally St. Benedict, in that Rule\r\nof his which was to be the code of monastic Christendom for centuries,\r\nhad sanctified Work as one of the most effectual preservatives of the\r\nbodily and spiritual health of the ascetic, bringing together\r\n_Laborare_ and _Orare_ in friendly union, and proclaiming anew for the\r\nmonk as for the untonsured citizen the primal ordinance, 'In the sweat\r\nof thy brow thou shalt eat bread.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The father of literary Monasticism.]\r\n\r\nThe great merit of Cassiodorus, that which shows his deep insight into\r\nthe needs of his age and entitles him to the eternal gratitude of\r\nEurope, was his determination to utilise the vast leisure of the\r\nconvent for the preservation of Divine and human learning and for its\r\ntransmission to after ages. In the miserable circumstances of the\r\ntimes Theology was in danger of becoming brutified and ignorant; the\r\ngreat treasures of Pagan literature were no longer being perpetuated\r\nby the slaves who had once acted as _librarii_ to the Greek or Roman\r\nnoble; and with every movement of the Ostrogothic armies, or of the\r\nyet more savage hordes who served under the Imperial standard, with\r\nevery sacked city and with every ravaged villa, some Codex, it may be\r\nsuch as we should now deem priceless and irreplaceable, was perishing.\r\nThis being the state of Italy, Cassiodorus resolved to make of his\r\nmonastery not merely a place for pious meditation, but a theological\r\nschool and a manufactory for the multiplication of copies, not only of\r\nthe Scriptures, not only of the Fathers and the commentators on\r\nScripture, but also of the great writers of pagan antiquity. In the\r\nchapter[80] which he devotes to the description of the _scriptorium_\r\nof his monastery he describes, with an enthusiasm which must have been\r\ncontagious, the noble work done there by the _antiquarius_: 'He may\r\nfill his mind with the Scriptures while copying the sayings of the\r\nLord. With his fingers he gives life to men and arms them against the\r\nwiles of the devil. So many wounds does Satan receive as the\r\n_antiquarius_ copies words of Christ. What he writes in his cell will\r\nbe scattered far and wide over distant Provinces. Man multiplies the\r\nheavenly words, and by a striking figure--if I may dare so to\r\nspeak--the three fingers of his hand express the utterances of the\r\nHoly Trinity. The fast-travelling reed writes down the holy words, and\r\nthus avenges the malice of the Wicked One, who caused a reed to be\r\nused to smite the head of the Saviour.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: The 30th of the De Institutione Div. Litt.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that the passage here quoted refers only to the work of the\r\ncopyist of the Christian Scriptures, but it could easily be shown from\r\nother passages[81] that the literary activity of the monastery was not\r\nconfined to these, but was also employed on secular literature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: For instance, in cap. xv., after cautioning his copyists\r\nagainst rash corrections of apparent faults in the sacred MSS., he\r\nsays: 'Ubicunque paragrammata in disertis hominibus [i.e. in classical\r\nauthors] reperta fuerint, intrepidus vitiosa recorrigat.' And the\r\ngreater part of cap. xxviii. is an argument against 'respuere\r\nsaecularium litterarum studia.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bookbinding.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mechanical appliances for the convent.]\r\n\r\nCassiodorus then goes on to describe the care which he has taken for\r\nthe binding of the sacred Codices in covers worthy of the beauty of\r\ntheir contents, following the example of the householder in the\r\nparable, who provided wedding garments for all who came to the supper\r\nof his son. One pattern volume had been prepared, containing samples\r\nof various sorts of binding, that the amanuensis might choose that\r\nwhich pleased him best. He had moreover provided, to help the nightly\r\ntoil of the _scriptorium_, mechanical lamps of some wonderful\r\nconstruction, which appears to have made them self-trimming, and to\r\nhave ensured their having always a sufficient supply of oil[82].\r\nSun-dials also for bright days, and water-clocks for cloudy days and\r\nthe night-season, regulated their labour, and admonished them when it\r\nwas time to unclose the three fingers, to lay down the reed, and to\r\nassemble with their brethren in the chapel of the convent for psalmody\r\nand prayer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Paravimus etiam nocturnis vigiliis mechanicas lucernas,\r\nconservatrices illuminantium flammarum, ipsas sibi nutrientes\r\nincendium, quae humano ministerio cessante, prolixe custodiant\r\nuberrimi luminis abundantissimam claritatem; ubi olei pinguedo non\r\ndeficit, quamvis flammis ardentibus jugitor torreatur.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation to the Benedictine Rule.]\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, though the idea of using the convent as a place of\r\nliterary toil and theological training was not absolutely new,\r\nCassiodorus seems certainly entitled to the praise of having first\r\nrealised it systematically and on an extensive scale. It was entirely\r\nin harmony with the spirit of the Rule of St. Benedict, if it was not\r\nformally ordained in that document. At a very early date in the\r\nhistory of their order, the Benedictines, influenced probably by the\r\nexample of the monastery of Vivaria, commenced that long series of\r\nservices to the cause of literature which they have never wholly\r\nintermitted. Thus, instead of accepting the obsolete formula for which\r\nsome scholars in the last age contended, 'Cassiodorus was a\r\nBenedictine,' we should perhaps be rather justified in maintaining\r\nthat Benedict, or at least his immediate followers, were\r\nCassiodorians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus as a transcriber of the Scriptures.]\r\n\r\nIn order to set an example of literary diligence to his monks, and to\r\nbe able to sympathise with the difficulties of an amanuensis,\r\nCassiodorus himself transcribed the Psalter, the Prophets, and the\r\nEpistles[83], no doubt from the translation of Jerome. This is not the\r\nplace for enlarging on the merits of Cassiodorus as a custodian and\r\ntransmitter of the sacred text. They were no doubt considerable; and\r\nthe rules which he gives to his monks, to guide them in the work of\r\ntranscription, show that he belonged to the Conservative school of\r\ncritics, and was anxious to guard against hasty emendations of the\r\ntext, however plausible. Practically, however, his MSS. of the Latin\r\nScriptures, showing the Itala and the Vulgate in parallel columns,\r\nseem to have been answerable for some of that confusion between the\r\ntwo versions which to some extent spoiled the text of Jerome, without\r\npreserving to us in its purity the interesting translation of the\r\nearlier Church.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: 'In Psalterio et Prophetis et Epistolis apostolorum\r\nstudium maximum laboris impendi.... Quos ego cunctos novem codices\r\nauctoritatis divinae (ut senex potui) sub collatione priscorum codicum\r\namicis ante me legentibus, sedula lectione transivi' (De Inst.\r\nPraefatio). We should have expected 'tres' rather than 'novem,' as the\r\nPsalter, the Prophets, and the Epistles each formed one codex.]\r\n\r\nBesides his labours as a transcriber, Cassiodorus, both as an original\r\nauthor and a compiler, used his pen for the instruction of his\r\nfellow-inmates at Vivarium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commentary on the Psalms.]\r\n\r\n(1) He began and slowly completed a Commentary on the Psalms. This\r\nvery diffuse performance (which occupies more than five hundred\r\nclosely printed pages in Migne's edition) displays, in the opinion of\r\nthose who have carefully studied it[84], a large amount of\r\nacquaintance with the writings of the Fathers, and was probably looked\r\nupon as a marvel of the human intellect by the Vivarian monks, for\r\nwhose benefit it was composed, and to whom it revealed, in the Psalms\r\nwhich they were daily and nightly intoning, refutations of all the\r\nheresies that had ever racked the Church, and the rudiments of all the\r\nsciences that flourished in the world. It is impossible now for this\r\nor any future age to do aught but lament over so much wasted\r\ningenuity, when we find the author maintaining that the whole of the\r\none hundred and fifty Psalms were written by King David, and that\r\nAsaph, Heman, and Jeduthun have only a mystical meaning; that the\r\nfirst seventy represent the Old Testament, and the last eighty the\r\nNew, because we celebrate the Resurrection of Christ on the eighth\r\nday of the week, and so forth. A closer study of the book might\r\nperhaps discover in it some genuine additions to the sum of human\r\nknowledge; but it is difficult to repress a murmur at the misdirected\r\nindustry which has preserved to us the whole of this ponderous\r\nfutility, while it has allowed the History of the Goths to perish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: I take my account of this treatise chiefly from Franz\r\n(pp. 93-100).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commentary on the Epistles.]\r\n\r\n(2) The 'Complexiones in Epistolas Apostolorum' (first published by\r\nMaffei in 1721, from a MS. discovered by him at Verona) have at least\r\nthe merit of being far shorter than the Commentary on the Psalms.\r\nPerhaps the only points of interest in them, even for theological\r\nscholars, are that Cassiodorus evidently attributes the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews without hesitation to the Apostle Paul, and that he notices\r\nthe celebrated passage concerning the Three Heavenly Witnesses (1 John\r\nv. 7) in a way which seems to imply that he found that passage in the\r\ntext of the Vulgate, though on examination his language is seen to be\r\nconsistent with the theory that these words are a gloss added by the\r\ncommentator himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historia Tripartita.]\r\n\r\n(3) In order to supply the want of any full Church History in the\r\nLatin tongue, a want which was probably felt not only by his own monks\r\nbut throughout the Churches of the West, Cassiodorus induced his\r\nfriend Epiphanius to translate from the Greek the ecclesiastical\r\nhistories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, and then himself fused\r\nthese three narratives into one, the well-known 'Historia Tripartita,'\r\nwhich contains the story of the Church's fortunes from the accession\r\nof Constantine to the thirty-second year of the reign of Theodosius II\r\n(306-439). The fact that the numerous mistranslations of Epiphanius\r\nhave passed uncorrected, probably indicates that Cassiodorus' own\r\nknowledge of Greek was but slight, and that he depended on his\r\ncoadjutor entirely for this part of the work. The 'Historia\r\nTripartita' has probably had a larger circulation than any other of\r\nits author's works; but Cassiodorus himself thought so little of his\r\nshare in it, that he does not include it in the list of his writings\r\nprefixed to the treatise 'De Orthographiâ.' And, in fact, the\r\ninartistic way in which the three narratives are soldered together,\r\nrather than recast into one symmetrical and harmonious whole, obliges\r\nus to admit that Cassiodorus' work at this book was little more than\r\nmechanical, and entitles him to scarcely any other praise than that of\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Institutiones Divinarum et Humanarum Lectionum.]\r\n\r\n(4) Of a different quality, though still partaking somewhat of the\r\nnature of a compilation, was his chief educational treatise, the\r\n'Institutiones Divinarum et Humanarum Lectionum[85].' About the year\r\n543, some three or four years after his retirement from public life,\r\nwhile he was slowly ploughing his way through the Commentary on the\r\nPsalms, twenty of which he had already interpreted, he seems to have\r\nlaid it aside for a time in order to devote himself to this work,\r\nwhich aimed more at instruction than at religious edification. In the\r\noutset of this book he describes that unsuccessful attempt of his, to\r\nwhich allusion has already been made, for the establishment of a\r\ntheological school in Rome, and continues that, 'as the rage of war\r\nand the turbulence of strife in the Italian realm[86] had prevented\r\nthe fulfilment of this desire, he felt himself constrained by Divine\r\ncharity to write for his monks' behoof these _libri introductorii_, in\r\nwhich, after the manner of a teacher, he would open to them the\r\nseries of the books of Holy Scripture, and would give them a\r\ncompendious acquaintance with secular literature.' As the book is not\r\nwritten for the learned, he undertakes to abstain from 'affectata\r\neloquentia,' and he does in the main keep his promise. The simple,\r\nstraightforward style of the book, which occasionally rises into real\r\nand 'unaffected eloquence' where the subject inspires him to make an\r\nappeal to the hearts of his readers, presents a striking and\r\nfavourable contrast to the obscure and turgid phraseology in which the\r\nperverted taste of the times caused him generally to shroud his\r\nmeaning[87].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Printed hitherto as two works, De Institutione Divinarum\r\nLitterarum, and De Artibus ac Disciplinis Liberalium Litterarum. But,\r\nas Ebert has shown (i. 477), the Preface to the Orthographia makes it\r\nprobable that these two really formed one book, with a title like that\r\ngiven above.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: 'In Italico regno.' These words seem to favour the\r\nconjecture that Theodoric may have called himself King of Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: As a specimen of this better style of Cassiodorus, I may\r\nrefer to his praises of the life of the literary monk, and his\r\nexhortation to him who is of duller brain to practise gardening:\r\n'Quapropter toto nisu, toto labore, totis desideriis exquiramus ut ad\r\ntale tantumque munus, Domino largiente, pervenire mereamur. Hoc enim\r\nnobis est salutare, proficuum, gloriosum, perpetuum, quod nulla mors,\r\nnulla mobilitas, nulla possit separare oblivio; sed in illa suavitate\r\npatriae, cum Domino faciet aeterna exsultatione gaudere. Quod si\r\nalicui fratrum, ut meminit Virgilius,\r\n\r\n    \"Frigidus obstiterit circum praecordia sanguis,\"\r\n\r\nut nec humanis nec divinis litteris perfecte possit erudiri, aliqua\r\ntamen scientiae mediocritate suffultus, eligat certe quod sequitur,\r\n\r\n    \"Rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes.\"\r\n\r\nQuia nec ipsum est a monachis alienum hortos colere, agros exercere,\r\net pomorum fecunditate gratulari; legitur enim in Psalmo centesimo\r\nvigesimo septimo, \"Labores manuum tuarum manducabis; beatus es et bene\r\ntibi erit.\"']\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this treatise (commonly called the 'De\r\nInstitutione Divinarum Litterarum') Cassiodorus briefly describes the\r\ncontents of the nine Codices[88] which made up the Scripture of the\r\nOld and New Testaments, and mentions the names of the chief\r\ncommentators upon each. After some important cautions as to the\r\npreservation of the purity of the sacred text and abstinence from\r\nplausible emendations, the author proceeds to enumerate the Christian\r\nhistorians--Eusebius, Orosius, Marcellinus, Prosper, and others[89];\r\nand he then slightly sketches the characters of some of the principal\r\nFathers--Hilary, Cyprian, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine. This part of\r\nthe work contains an interesting allusion to 'Dionysius Monachus,\r\nScytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus,' of whom Cassiodorus\r\nspeaks as a colleague in his literary enterprises. This is the\r\nso-called Dionysius Exiguus, who fixed (erroneously, as it now\r\nappears) the era of the birth of Christ, and whose system of\r\nchronology founded on this event has been accepted by all the nations\r\nof Christendom. At the conclusion of this the first part of the\r\ntreatise we find some general remarks on the nature of the monastic\r\nlife, and some pictures of Vivarium and its neighbourhood, to which we\r\nare indebted for some of the information contained in the preceding\r\npages. The book ends with a prayer, and contains thirty-three\r\nchapters, the same number, remarks Cassiodorus (who is addicted to\r\nthis kind of moralising on numbers) that was reached by the years of\r\nthe life of Christ on earth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: 1. Octateuchus (Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth).\r\n\r\n2. Kings (Samuel and Kings, Chronicles).\r\n\r\n3. Prophets (Four Major, including Daniel, and Twelve Minor).\r\n\r\n4. Psalms.\r\n\r\n5.

[The\r\nallusion to 'finem imperii Justiniani' was probably added in a later\r\nrevision of the Institutiones.] 'Sanctus quoque Prosper Chronica ab\r\nAdam ad Genserici tempora et urbis Romae depraedationem usque\r\nperduxit.']\r\n\r\nThe second part of the treatise, commonly called 'De Artibus ac\r\nDisciplinis Liberalium Litterarum,' contains so much as the author\r\nthought that every monk should be acquainted with concerning the four\r\nliberal arts--Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Mathematics--the last of\r\nwhich is divided into the four 'disciplines' of Arithmetic, Geometry,\r\nMusic, and Astronomy. As illustrating the relative importance of these\r\nsciences (as we call them) as apprehended by Cassiodorus, it is\r\ncurious to observe that while Geometry and Astronomy occupy only about\r\none page, and Arithmetic and Music two pages each, Logic takes up\r\neighteen pages, Grammar two, and Rhetoric six.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: De Orthographiâ.]\r\n\r\n(5) Some other works, chiefly of a grammatical kind[90], which have\r\nnow perished, together with the exegetical treatises already named,\r\noccupied the leisure hours of the old age of Cassiodorus. At length,\r\nin the ninety-third year of his age, the veteran statesman, nobleman,\r\nand judge crowned his life of useful service by writing for his\r\nbeloved monks his still extant treatise 'De Orthographia[91].' He\r\ntells us that the monks suddenly exclaimed, 'What doth it profit us to\r\nstudy either those works which the ancients have composed or those\r\nwhich your Wisdom has caused to be added to the list, if we are\r\naltogether ignorant how we ought to write these things, and on the\r\nother hand cannot understand and accurately represent in speech the\r\nwords which we find written?' In other words, 'Give us a treatise on\r\nspelling.' The venerable teacher gladly complied with the request, and\r\ncompiled from twelve grammarians[92] various rules, the observance of\r\nwhich would prevent the student from committing the usual faults in\r\nspelling. It is no doubt true[93] that this work is a mere collection\r\nof excerpts from other authors, not arranged on any systematic\r\nprinciple. Still, even as such a collection, it does great credit to\r\nthe industry of a nonagenarian; and it seems to me that there is much\r\nin it which a person who was studying the transition of Latin into the\r\nLingua Volgare might peruse with profit. To an epigraphist especially\r\nit must be interesting to see what were the mistakes which an\r\nimperfectly educated Italian in that age was most likely to commit.\r\nThe confusion between _b_ and _v_ was evidently a great source of\r\nerror, and their nice discrimination, to which Cassiodorus devotes\r\nfour chapters, a very _crux_ of accurate scholarship. We see also from\r\na passage in the 'De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum[94]' that the\r\npractice of assimilating the last letter of the prefix in compound\r\nwords, like i_l_luminatio, i_r_risio, i_m_probus, though it had been\r\nintroduced, was as yet hardly universal; and similarly that the monks\r\nrequired to be instructed to write qui_c_quam for euphony, instead of\r\nqui_d_quam.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: They were a compilation from the 'Artes' of Donatus,\r\nfrom a book on Etymologies (perhaps also by Donatus), and from a\r\ntreatise by Sacerdos on Schemata; and a short Table of Contents of the\r\nBooks of Scripture, prepared in such a form as to be easily committed\r\nto memory.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Ad amantissimos orthographos discutiendos anno aetatis\r\nmeae nonagesimo tertio (Domino adjuvante) perveni.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: They were Donatus, Cn.

Two names seem to be omitted by\r\nCassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: As stated by Ebert (p. 481).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Cap. xv.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Cassiodorus, 575 (?).]\r\n\r\nThe treatise 'De Orthographiâ' was the last product, as far as we\r\nknow, of the industrious brain of Cassiodorus. Two years after its\r\ncomposition the aged statesman and scholar, in the ninety-sixth year\r\nof his age, entered into his well-earned rest[95]. The death of\r\nCassiodorus occurred (as I believe) in the year 575, three years\r\nbefore the death of the Emperor Justin II, nephew and successor of\r\nJustinian. The period covered by his life had been one of vast\r\nchanges. Born when the Kingdom of Odovacar was only four years old,\r\nhe had as a young man seen that Kingdom overthrown by the arms of\r\nTheodoric; he had sat by the cradle of the Ostrogothic monarchy, and\r\nmourned over its grave; had seen the eunuch Narses supreme vicegerent\r\nof the Emperor; had heard the avalanche of the Lombard invasion\r\nthunder over Italy, and had outlived even the Lombard invader Alboin.\r\nPope Leo, the tamer of Attila and the hero of Chalcedon, had not been\r\ndead twenty years when Cassiodorus was born. Pope Gregory the Great,\r\nthe converter of England, was within fifteen years of his accession to\r\nthe Pontificate when Cassiodorus died. The first great schism between\r\nthe Eastern and Western Churches was begun in his boyhood and ended\r\nbefore he had reached old age. He saw the irretrievable ruin of Rome,\r\nsuch as Augustus and Trajan had known her; the extinction of the Roman\r\nSenate; the practical abolition of the Consulate; the close of the\r\nschools of philosophy at Athens.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: In assigning the death of Cassiodorus to the\r\nninety-sixth year of his age I rest upon the authority of Trittheim\r\n(as quoted in the earlier part of this chapter), who appears to me to\r\nhave preserved the chronology which was generally accepted, before the\r\nquestion became entangled by the confusion between Cassiodorus and his\r\nfather.]\r\n\r\nReverting to the line of thought with which this chapter opened, if\r\none were asked to specify any single life which more than another was\r\nin contact both with the Ancient World and the Modern, none could be\r\nmore suitably named than the life of Cassiodorus.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE TOPOGRAPHY OF SQUILLACE.\r\n\r\nThe chief conclusions which Mr. Evans came to after his two days'\r\nstudy of the country about Squillace are these:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of Scylacium.]\r\n\r\nI. The Scylacium or Scolacium of Roman times, the city of Cassiodorus,\r\nis not to be looked for at the modern Squillace, but at the place\r\ncalled Roccella in the Italian military map, which Lenormant and Evans\r\nknow as _La Roccelletta del Vescovo di Squillace_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [map] _Oxford University Press_]\r\n\r\nThis place, which is about ten kilometres north-east of modern\r\nSquillace, is on a little hill immediately overhanging the sea, while\r\nSquillace is on a spur of the Apennines three or four miles distant\r\nfrom the sea. Mr. Evans' chief reasons for identifying Roccella with\r\nScylacium are (1) its position, 'hanging like a cluster of grapes on\r\nhills not so high as to make the ascent of them a weariness, but high\r\nenough to command a delightful prospect over land and sea.' This\r\ndescription by Cassiodorus exactly suits Roccella, but does not suit\r\nSquillace, which is at the top of a conical hill, and is reached only\r\nby a very toilsome ascent. 'With its gradual southern and eastern\r\nslope and its freedom from overlooking heights (different in this\r\nrespect from Squillace),' says Mr. Evans, 'Roccella was emphatically,\r\nas Cassiodorus describes it, \"a city of the sun.\"'\r\n\r\n(2) Its ruins. While no remains of a pre-mediaeval time have been\r\ndiscovered at Squillace, there is still standing at Roccella the shell\r\nof a splendid basilica, of which Mr. Evans has taken some plans and\r\nsketches, but which seems to have strangely escaped the notice of most\r\npreceding travellers. The total length of this building is 94 paces,\r\nthe width of the nave 30, the extreme width of the transept 54. It has\r\nthree fine apses at the eastern end, and is built in the form of a\r\nLatin cross. On either side of the nave was an exterior arcade, which\r\napparently consisted originally of eleven window arches, six of them\r\nnot being for the transmission of light. 'Altogether,' says Mr. Evans,\r\n'this church, even in its dilapidated state, is one of the finest\r\nmonuments of the kind anywhere existing. We should have to go to\r\nRome, to Ravenna, or to Thessalonica, to find its parallel; but I\r\ndoubt whether, even at any of those places, there is to be seen a\r\nbasilica with such fine exterior arcading. It is a great tribute to\r\nthe strength of the original fabric that so much should have survived\r\nthe repeated shocks of earthquake that have desolated Calabria, and\r\nscarcely left one stone upon another of her ancient cities.'\r\n\r\nAfter a careful examination of the architectural peculiarities of this\r\nbasilica, Mr. Evans is disposed to fix its erection somewhere about\r\nthe time of the Emperor Justinian.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this fine building there are at Roccella the ruins of\r\ntwo smaller late Roman churches, mausolea, and endless foundations of\r\nbuildings which must have formed very extensive suburbs.\r\n\r\nMore important than all, the massive walls of a considerable city can\r\nstill be traced for nearly a mile in two parallel lines, with the\r\ntransverse wall which unites them. Certainly all these indications\r\nseem to point to the existence at this spot of a great provincial city\r\nof the Empire, and to make Mr. Evans' conjecture more probable than\r\nthat of M. Lenormant, who identified the ruins at Roccella with those\r\nof Castra Hannibalis, the seaport of Scylacium. It would seem\r\nprobable, if Mr. Evans' theory be correct, that the city may have been\r\nremoved to its present site in the early middle ages, in order to\r\nguard it against the incursions of the Saracens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Vivarian Monastery.]\r\n\r\nII. As to the situation of the _Vivarian Monastery_ Mr. Evans comes to\r\nnearly the same conclusion as M. Lenormant. Both place it on the\r\npromontory of Squillace (eastward of Staletti), and, as Mr. Evans\r\nobserves, 'only such a position can be reconciled, on the one hand,\r\nwith the presence of an abundant stream and rich Campagna, on the\r\nother with the neighbourhood of caves and grottoes on the sea-shore.'\r\nBut while M. Lenormant places it at a place called Coscia, almost\r\nimmediately to the north of and under Staletti, Mr. Evans pleads for\r\nthe site now occupied by the Church of S. Maria del Mare, on the cliff\r\ntop, very near the sea, and about three kilometres south of Staletti.\r\nThis church is itself of later date than Cassiodorus, and probably\r\nformed part of the work of restoration undertaken by Nicephorus Phocas\r\nin the Tenth Century; but there are signs of its having formerly\r\njoined on to a monastery, and some of the work about it looks as if\r\nmaterials taken from the Cassiodorian edifice had been used in the\r\nwork of reconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fons Arethusae.]\r\n\r\nIII. The _Fountain of Arethusa_ may possibly, according to Mr. Evans,\r\nbe identified with the Fontana della Panaghia, a small fountain by the\r\nsea-shore at the south end of a little bay under the promontory of S.\r\nGregorio. The so-called Fontana di Cassiodoro, near Coscia, has\r\nreceived its name and its present appearance in modern times, and is\r\nmuch too far from the sea to be the Fountain of Arethusa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ANECDOTON HOLDERI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few pages must be devoted to the MS. bearing the somewhat uncouth\r\ntitle of 'Anecdoton Holderi,' because it is the most recently opened\r\nsource of information as to the life and works of Cassiodorus, and one\r\nwhich, if genuine, settles some questions which have been long and\r\nvigorously debated among scholars.\r\n\r\nMy information on the subject is derived from a pamphlet of 79 pages\r\nby Hermann Usener, printed at Bonn in 1877, and bearing the title\r\n'Anecdoton Holderi: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte Roms in Ostgothischer\r\nZeit.' I am indebted to Mr. Bywater, of Exeter College, Oxford, for my\r\nintroduction to this pamphlet, which, while strikingly confirming some\r\nconclusions which I had come to from my own independent study of the\r\n'Variae,' has been of the greatest possible service to me in studying\r\nthe lives of Cassiodorus and Boethius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Description of the MS.]\r\n\r\nThe 'Anecdoton' (which loses its right to that name by Usener's\r\npublication of it) was discovered by Alfred Holder in a MS. known as\r\nCodex Augiensis, No. CVL, which came from the Monastery of Reichenau\r\nand is now in the Grand-Ducal Library at Carlsruhe. The monks of the\r\nfertile island of Reichenau (Augia Dives), in the Lake of Constance,\r\nwere celebrated in the ninth and tenth centuries for their zeal in the\r\ncollection and transcription of manuscripts. The well-known Codex\r\nAugiensis (an uncial MS. of the Greek text of the New Testament, with\r\nthe Vulgate version in parallel columns) is referred by\r\npalaeographers to the ninth century[96]. The Codex Augiensis with\r\nwhich we are now concerned, and which is a copy of the 'Institutiones\r\nHumanarum Rerum' of Cassiodorus, is believed to have been written in\r\nthe next succeeding century. On the last page of this MS. Holder\r\ndiscovered the fragment--not properly belonging to the\r\n'Institutiones'--to which he has given his name, and which is as\r\nfollows[97]:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: See Scrivener, Plain Introduction to the Criticism of\r\nthe New Testament, pp. 133-4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: I have adopted the emendations--most of them the\r\ncorrections of obvious mistakes--which are suggested by Usener.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of the Anecdoton Holderi.]\r\n\r\n     'Excerpta ex libello Cassiodori Senatoris monachi servi Dei,\r\n     ex-Patricio, ex-Consule Ordinario Quaestore et Magistro\r\n     Officiorum, quem scripsit ad Rufum Petronium Nicomachum\r\n     ex-Consule Ordinario Patricium et Magistrum Officiorum.

The 'Excerpta' have been made by\r\nsome later hand--perhaps that of a monk in the Vivarian convent. To\r\nhim undoubtedly we owe the words 'monachi servi Dei' as a description\r\nof Cassiodorus; probably also the 'ex-Patricio,' which is perhaps an\r\nincorrect designation. 'Vir eruditissimus,' in the last paragraph, is\r\nprobably due to the same hand, as, with all his willingness to do\r\njustice to his own good qualities, Cassiodorus would hardly have\r\nspoken thus of himself in a work avowedly proceeding from his own pen.\r\nThe clause which is placed in brackets [et ... superposuit] is\r\nprobably also due to the copyist, anxious to supply what he deemed the\r\nimperfections of his memorandum. In short, it must be admitted that\r\nthe fragment cannot consist of the very words of Cassiodorus in\r\nhowever abbreviated a form. Still it contains so much that is\r\nvaluable, and that could hardly have been invented by any writer of a\r\npost-Cassiodorian age, that it is well worthy of the careful and, so\r\nto speak, microscopical examination to which it has been subjected by\r\nUsener.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Date of the fragment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persons to whom addressed.]\r\n\r\nThe work from which these 'Excerpta' are taken was composed, according\r\nto Usener, in the year 522. This is proved by the facts that the\r\nreceiver of the letter is spoken of as Magister Officiorum, a post\r\nwhich he apparently held from Sept. 1, 521, to Sept. 1, 522; and that\r\nthe Consulship of the two sons of Boethius, which began on Jan. 1,\r\n522, is also referred to. The name of the person to whom the letter is\r\naddressed is given as Rufius Petronius Nicomachus. Usener, however,\r\nshows good reason for thinking that his final name, the name by which\r\nhe was known in the consular lists, is omitted, and that his full\r\ndesignation was Rufius Petronius Nicomachus Cethegus, Consul in 504,\r\nMagister Officiorum (as above stated) in 521-522, and Patrician. He\r\nwas probably the same Cethegus whom Procopius mentions[100] as\r\nPrinceps Senatus, and as withdrawing from Rome to Centumcellae in the\r\nyear 545 because he was accused of treachery to the Imperial\r\ncause[101].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: De Bello Gotthico iii. 13 (p. 328, ed. Bonn).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: If Usener be right (and he has worked up this point\r\nwith great care), we can trace the following links in the pedigree of\r\nCethegus (see pp. 6 and 11):\r\n\r\n              Rufius Petronius _Placidus_, Consul 481.\r\n                          |\r\n         Rufius Petronius Anicius _Probinus_, Consul 489.\r\n                          |\r\nRufius Petronius Nicomachus _Cethegus_, Consul 504, correspondent of\r\n                           Cassiodorus.\r\n\r\nProbinus and Cethegus are referred to by Ennodius in his letter to\r\nAmbrosius and Beatus, otherwise called his Paraenesis (p. 409, ed.\r\nHartel).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its object.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the little treatise referred to evidently was to give an\r\naccount of those members of the family to which Cassiodorus belonged\r\nwho had distinguished themselves in literature. The words 'Ex genere\r\nCassiodororum' are perhaps a gloss of the transcribers. At least it\r\ndoes not appear that they would correctly describe the descent of\r\nSymmachus and Boethius, though they were relations of Cassiodorus,\r\nbeing descended from or allied to the great house of the Aurelii from\r\nwhich he also sprang. Probably several other names may have been\r\nnoticed in the original treatise, but the only three as to which the\r\n'Anecdoton' informs us are the three as to whom information is most\r\nacceptable--Symmachus, Boethius, and Cassiodorus himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Information as to life of Symmachus.]\r\n\r\nI. The name of Q. Aurelius Memmius _Symmachus_ was already known to us\r\nas that of the friend, guardian, and father-in-law of Boethius, and\r\nhis fellow-sufferer from the outburst of suspicious rage which\r\ndisgraced the last years of Theodoric. That he was Consul in 485\r\n(under the dominion of Odovacar), and that he had at the time of his\r\nfall attained the honoured position of Father of the Senate[102], we\r\nalso know from the 'Consular Fasti' and the 'Anonymus Valesii.' This\r\nextract tells us that he had attained the rank of Patricius, which may\r\nperhaps have been bestowed upon him when he laid down the Consulship.\r\nHe was 'a philosopher, and a modern imitator of the ancient Cato; but\r\nsurpassed the virtues of the men of old by [his devotion to] our most\r\nholy religion.' This sentence quite accords with all that we hear of\r\nthe character of Symmachus from our other authorities--the 'Anonymus\r\nValesii,' Procopius, and Boethius. The blending of old Roman gravity\r\nand Christian piety in such a man's disposition is happily indicated\r\nin the words before us. It would be an interesting commentary upon\r\nthem if we were to contrast the career of the Christian Symmachus, who\r\nsuffered in some sense as a martyr for the Nicene Creed under\r\nTheodoric, with that of his ancestor the Pagan Symmachus, who, 143\r\nyears before, incurred the anger of Gratian by his protests against\r\nthe removal of the Altar of Victory from the Senate House, and the\r\ncurtailment of the grant to the Vestal Virgins.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Caput Senati. This, not Caput Senatus, is the form\r\nwhich we find in Anon. Valesii. Usener suggests (p. 32) that Symmachus\r\nprobably became Caput Senati on the death of Festus, who had held that\r\nposition from 501 to 506.]\r\n\r\nThe Symmachus with whom we are now concerned was also an orator; and\r\nwe learn from this extract that he delivered a speech, evidently of\r\nsome importance, in the Senate, 'pro allecticiis.' There seems much\r\nprobability in Usener's contention that these 'allecticii' were men\r\nwho had been 'allecti,' or admitted by co-optation into the Senate\r\nduring the reign of Odovacar, and whom, on the downfall of that ruler,\r\nit had been proposed to strip of their recently acquired dignity--a\r\nproposal which seems to have been successfully resisted by Symmachus\r\nand his friends.\r\n\r\nLastly, we learn that Symmachus, 'in imitation of his ancestors,' put\r\nforth a Roman History in seven books. The expression for ancestors\r\n(parentes) here used is thought by Usener to refer chiefly to Virius\r\nNicomachus Flavianus (Consul in 394[103]), whose granddaughter married\r\nQ. Fabius Memmius Symmachus, and was the grandmother of our Symmachus.\r\nThis Flavianus, who was in his time one of the chief leaders of the\r\nheathen party in the Senate, is spoken of in one inscription as\r\n'historicus disertissimus;' and in another, mention is made of the\r\nfact that he dedicated his annals to Theodosius.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: See Usener, p. 29. The Consules Ordinarii for that year\r\nwere Arcadius and Honorius.]\r\n\r\nWhether the elder Symmachus, the Pagan champion, was a historian as\r\nwell as an orator is a matter about which there is a good deal of\r\ndoubt. Jordanes twice quotes 'The History of Symmachus,' once as to\r\nthe elevation of the Emperor Maximin, and once as to his death[104].\r\nUsener thinks that the 'Anecdoton Holderi' authorises us henceforward\r\nto assign these quotations without doubt to the younger, Christian\r\nSymmachus, not to his Pagan ancestor. To me the allusion to\r\n_parentes_ (in the plural), whose industry as historians the Symmachus\r\nthere spoken of imitated, seems to make it at least as probable that\r\nthe earlier, not the later member of the family composed the history\r\nwhich is here quoted by Jordanes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Jordanes, Getica xv.: 'Nam, ut dicit Symmachus in\r\nquinto suae historiae libro, Maximinus ... ab exercitus effectus est\r\nimperator.' 'Occisus Aquileia a Puppione regnum reliquit Philippo;\r\nquod nos huic nostro opusculo de Symmachi hystoria [sic] mutuavimus.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Information as to life of Boethius.]\r\n\r\nII. We now pass on to consider the information furnished by this\r\nfragment as to the illustrious son-in-law of Symmachus, Anicius\r\nManlius Severinus _Boethius_. Of the facts of his life we had already\r\npretty full information, from the autobiographical sections of the\r\n'Consolation of Philosophy' and other sources. He does not indeed\r\nmention the exact year of his birth, but the allusion to 'untimely\r\ngray hairs' which he makes in that work, written in 523 or 524,\r\ntogether with other indications[105] as to his age, entitle us to fix\r\nit at about 480, certainly not earlier than that year. The death of\r\nhis father (who was Consul in 487) occurred while he was still a\r\nchild. Symmachus, as has been already said, was the guardian of his\r\nyouth and the friend of his manhood, and gave him his daughter\r\nRusticiana to wife. That he received the honour of the Consulship in\r\n510 we know from the 'Fasti Consulares;' but it is perplexing to find\r\nhim even before that year spoken of[106] as Patricius, since this\r\nhonour was generally bestowed only on those who had already sat in the\r\ncurule chair of the Consul[107]. The high consideration in which he\r\nwas held at the Court of Theodoric, and the value placed upon his\r\nscientific attainments, are sufficiently proved by the letters in the\r\nfollowing collection, especially by those in which he is consulted\r\nabout the frauds committed by the officers of the Mint, about the\r\nwater-clock which is to be sent to Gundobad King of the Burgundians,\r\nand the harper who is to be provided for the King of the Franks[108].\r\nIn the year 522 his two sons, Symmachus and Boethius, though they had\r\nbut just attained to man's estate, received the honour of the\r\nConsulship, upon which occasion the proud and happy father pronounced\r\na panegyric upon Theodoric before the assembled Senate. Some of these\r\nfacts in the life of Boethius are referred to in the extract before\r\nus, which, as was before said, appears to be taken from a treatise\r\ncomposed in this same year 522, the year of the Consulship of the\r\nyoung Boethii. Of their father's investiture with the office of\r\n_Magister Officiorum_ on September 1, 522, of his sudden fall from the\r\nroyal favour, of the charge of treason which was preferred against him\r\nbefore the end of that year, of his imprisonment during 523 and\r\nexecution (probably in the early part of 524), we have of course no\r\ntrace in this extract; and the fact that we have none is a strong\r\nargument for the genuineness and contemporary character of the\r\ntreatise from which it is taken.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Chiefly derived from the Paraenesis of Ennodius (Opusc.\r\nvi.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: In the Paraenesis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Usener's suggestion (pp. 38, 39) that he obtained this\r\nhonour in consequence of having filled the place of _Comes Sacrarum\r\nLargitionum_ seems to me only to land us in the further difficulty\r\ncaused by the entire omission of all allusion to this fact both in the\r\nParaenesis and in the Anecdoton Holderi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: See Var. i. 10 and 45; ii. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His theological treatises.]\r\n\r\nSo far, then, we have in the 'Anecdoton Holderi' only a somewhat\r\nmeagre reiteration of facts already known to us. But when we come to\r\nthe statement of the literary labours of Boethius the case is entirely\r\naltered. It is well known that in the Middle Ages certain treatises on\r\ndisputed points of Christian theology were attributed to him as their\r\nauthor. They are:--\r\n\r\n1. A treatise 'De Sancta Trinitate.'\r\n\r\n2. 'Ad Johannem Diaconum: Utrum Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus de\r\nDivinitate substantialiter praedicentur.'\r\n\r\n3. 'Ad eundem: Quomodo substantiae in eo quod sint bonae sint cum non\r\nsint substantialia bona.'\r\n\r\n4. 'De Fide Catholica.'\r\n\r\n5. 'Contra Eutychen et Nestorium.'\r\n\r\nIt may be said at once that in the earlier MSS. the fourth treatise is\r\nnot attributed to Boethius. It seems to have been included with the\r\nothers by some mistake, and I shall therefore in the following remarks\r\nassume that it is not his, and shall confine my attention to the first\r\nthree and the fifth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty as to religious position of Boethius.]\r\n\r\nEven as to these, notwithstanding the nearly unanimous voice of the\r\nearly Middle Ages (as represented by MSS. of the Ninth, Tenth, and\r\nEleventh Centuries) assigning them to Boethius as their author,\r\nscholars, especially recent scholars, have felt the gravest possible\r\ndoubts of their being really his, doubts which have of late ripened\r\ninto an almost complete certainty that he was not their author. The\r\ndifficulty does not arise from anything in the diction or in the\r\ntheology which points to a later age as the time of their composition,\r\nbut from the startling contrast which they present to the religious\r\natmosphere of the 'Consolation of Philosophy.' Here, in these\r\ntheological treatises, we have the author entering cheerfully into the\r\nmost abstruse points of the controversy concerning the Nature of\r\nChrist, without apparently one wavering thought as to the Deity of the\r\nSon of Mary. There, in the 'Consolation,' a book written in prison and\r\nin disgrace, with death at the executioner's hands impending over\r\nhim--a book in which above all others we should have expected a man\r\npossessing the Christian faith to dwell upon the promises of\r\nChristianity--the name of Christ is never once mentioned, the tone,\r\nthough religious and reverential, is that of a Theist only; and from\r\nbeginning to end, except one or two sentences in which an obscure\r\nallusion may possibly be detected to the Christian revelation, there\r\nis nothing which might not have been written by a Greek philosopher\r\nignorant of the very name of Christianity. Of the various attempts\r\nwhich have been made to solve this riddle perhaps the most ingenious\r\nis that of M. Charles Jourdain, who, in a monograph devoted to the\r\nsubject[109], seeks to prove that the author of the theological\r\ntreatises referred to was a certain Boethus, an African Bishop of the\r\nByzacene Province, who was banished to Sardinia about the year 504 by\r\nthe Vandal King Thrasamond.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: De l'Origine des Traditions sur le Christianisme de\r\nBoèce (Paris, 1861.)]\r\n\r\nNot thus, however, as it now appears, is the knot to be cut. And after\r\nall, M. Jourdain, in arguing, as he seems disposed to argue, against\r\nany external profession of Christianity on the part of Boethius,\r\nintroduces contradictions greater than any that his theory would\r\nremove. To any person acquainted with the thoughts and words of the\r\nlittle coterie of Roman nobles to which Boethius belonged, it will\r\nseem absolutely impossible that the son-in-law of Symmachus, the\r\nreceiver of the praises of Ennodius and Cassiodorus, should have been\r\na professed votary of the old Paganism. It is not the theological\r\ntreatises coming from a man in his position which are hard to account\r\nfor; it is the apparently non-Christian tone of the 'Consolation.'\r\n\r\nThe fragment now before us shows that the old-fashioned belief in\r\nBoethius as a theologian was well founded. 'He wrote a book concerning\r\nthe Holy Trinity, and certain dogmatic chapters, and a book against\r\nNestorius.' That is a sufficiently accurate _resumé_ of the four\r\ntheological treatises enumerated above. Here Usener also observes--and\r\nI am inclined to agree with him--that there is a certain resemblance\r\nbetween the style of thought of these treatises and that of the\r\n'Consolation' itself. They are, after all, philosophical rather than\r\nreligious; one of the earliest samples of that kind of logical\r\ndiscussion of theological dogmas which the Schoolmen of the Middle\r\nAges so delighted to indulge in. The young philosopher, hearing at his\r\nfather-in-law's table the discussions between Chalcedonian and\r\nMonophysite with which all Rome resounded, on account of the prolonged\r\nstrife with the Church of Constantinople, set himself down to discuss\r\nthe same topics which they were wrangling over by the light--to him so\r\nclear and precious--of the Greek philosophy. There was perhaps in this\r\nemployment neither reverence nor irreverence. He had not St.\r\nAugustine's intense and almost passionate conviction of the truth of\r\nChristianity; but he was quite willing to accept it and to discourse\r\nupon it, as he discoursed on Arithmetic, Music, and Geometry.\r\n\r\nBut when premature old age, solitude, and the loss of liberty befell\r\nhim, it was not to the highly elaborated Christian theology of the\r\nSixth Century that he turned for support and consolation. Probably\r\nenough the very fact that he knew some of the pitfalls in the way\r\ndeterred him from that dangerous journey, where the slightest\r\ndeviation on either side landed him in some detested heresy, the\r\nheresy of Nestorius or of Eutyches. 'On revient toujours à ses\r\npremiers amours;' and even so Boethius, though undoubtedly professing\r\nhimself a Christian, and about to die in full communion with the\r\nCatholic Church, turned for comfort in his dungeon to the\r\nphilosophical studies of his youth, especially to the ethical writings\r\nof Plato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the title of the treatise is '_Philosophiae_ Consolatio;'\r\nand however vigorous a literature of philosophy may in the course of\r\ncenturies have grown up in the Christian domain, in the sixth century\r\nthe remembrance of the old opposition between Christianity and\r\nPhilosophy was perhaps still too strong for a writer to do anything\r\nmore than stand neutral as to the distinctive claims of Christianity,\r\nwhen he had for the time donned the cloak of the philosopher.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bucolic Poem of Boethius.]\r\n\r\nWe learn from the fragment before us that Boethius also wrote a\r\n'Bucolic Poem.' This is an interesting fact, and helps to explain the\r\nfacility with which he breaks into song in the midst of the\r\n'Consolation.' It may have been to this effort of the imagination that\r\nhe alluded when he said at the beginning of that work--\r\n\r\n    'Carmina qui quondam studio florente peregi\r\n    Flebilis, heu, moestos cogor inire modos.'\r\n\r\nWe would gladly know something more of this 'Bucolic Poem' indited by\r\nthe universal genius, Boethius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\nIII. As for _Cassiodorus_ himself, the additional information\r\nfurnished by this fragment has been already discussed in the foregoing\r\nchapter. That he was _Consilarius_ to his father during his\r\nPraefecture, and that in that capacity he recited an eloquent\r\npanegyric on Theodoric, which was rewarded by his promotion to the\r\nhigh office of the Quaestorship, are facts which we learn from this\r\nfragment only; and they are of high importance, not only for the life\r\nof Cassiodorus but for the history of Europe at the beginning of the\r\nSixth Century, because they make it impossible to assign to any letter\r\nin the 'Variae' an earlier date than 500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GRADATIONS OF OFFICIAL RANK IN THE LATER EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Official Hierarchy introduced by Diocletian.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Diocletian introduced and Constantine perfected\r\nan elaborate system of administration under which the titles,\r\nfunctions, order of precedence, and number of attendants of the\r\nvarious officers of the Civil Service as well as of the Imperial army\r\nwere minutely and punctiliously regulated. This system, which, as\r\nforming the pattern upon which the nobility of mediaeval Europe was to\r\na great extent modelled, perhaps deserves even more careful study than\r\nit has yet received, is admirably illustrated by the letters of\r\nCassiodorus. The _Notitia Utriusque Imperii_, our copies of which must\r\nhave been compiled in the early years of the Fifth Century, furnishes\r\nus with a picture of official life which, after we have made allowance\r\nfor the fact that the Empire of the West has shrunk into the\r\nOstrogothic Kingdom of Italy (with the addition of Dalmatia and some\r\nother portions of Illyricum), is almost precisely reproduced in the\r\npages of the 'Various Letters.' In order that the student may\r\nunderstand the full significance of many passages in those letters,\r\nand especially of the superscriptions by which each letter is\r\nprefaced, it will be well to give a brief outline of the system which\r\nexisted alike under Theodosius and Theodoric.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nobilissimi.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, we come to what is rather a family than a\r\nclass, the persons bearing the title _Nobilissimus_[110]. These were\r\nthe nearest relatives of the reigning Emperor; his brothers, sisters,\r\nsons, and daughters. The title therefore is not unlike that of Royal\r\nor Imperial Highness in modern monarchies. I am not sure whether any\r\ntrace can be found of the survival of this title in the Ostrogothic\r\nCourt. Theodahad, nephew of Theodoric, is addressed simply as 'Vir\r\nSenator[111],' and he is spoken of as 'praecelsus et amplissimus\r\nvir[112].' It is not so, however, in respect of the three great\r\nofficial classes which follow--the Illustres, Spectabiles, and\r\nClarissimi--whose titles were rendered as punctiliously in the Italy\r\nof Theodoric as ever they were in the Italy of Diocletian and\r\nConstantine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: The existence of this title is proved not only by the\r\nlanguage of Arcadius in the Theodosian Code x. 25. 1, concerning\r\n'Nobilissimae puellae, filiae meae,' but also by Zosimus (ii. 39), who\r\nsays that Constantine bestowed the dignity of Nobilissimus on his\r\nbrother Constantius and his nephew Hannibalianus ([Greek: tês tou\r\nlegomenou nôbelissimou par' autou Kônstantinou tuchontes axias aidoi\r\ntês syngeneias]); and by Marcellinus Comes, s. a. 527, who says:\r\n'Justinus Imperator Justinianum ex sorore suâ nepotem, jamdudum a se\r\nNobilissimum designatum, participem quoque regni ani, successoremque\r\ncreavit.' It is evident that the title did not come by right of birth,\r\nbut that some sort of declaration of it was necessary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Var. iii. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Var. viii. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illustres.]\r\n\r\nI. The _Illustres_ were a small and select circle of men, the chief\r\ndepositaries of power after the Sovereign, and they may with some\r\ntruth be compared to the Cabinet Ministers of our own political\r\nsystem. The 'Notitia' mentions thirteen of them as bearing rule in the\r\nWestern Empire. They are:\r\n\r\n1. The Praetorian Praefect of Italy.\r\n\r\n2. The Praetorian Praefect of the Gauls.\r\n\r\n3. The Praefect of the City of Rome.\r\n\r\n4. The Master of the Foot Guards (Magister Peditum in Praesenti).\r\n\r\n5. The Master of the Horse Guards (Magister Equitum in Praesenti).\r\n\r\n6. The Master of the Horse for the Gauls (per Gallias).\r\n\r\n7. The Grand Chamberlain (Praepositus Sacri Cubiculi).\r\n\r\n8. The Master of the Offices.\r\n\r\n9. The Quaestor.\r\n\r\n10. The Count of Sacred Largesses.\r\n\r\n11. The Count of the Private Domains (Comes Rerum Privatarum).\r\n\r\n12. The Count of the Household Cavalry (Comes Domesticorum Equitum).\r\n\r\n13. The Count of the Household Infantry (Comes Domesticorum Peditum).\r\n\r\nSubstantially these same titles were borne by the Illustres to whom\r\nCassiodorus (himself one of them) addressed his 'Various Letters.' The\r\nsecond and the sixth (the Praetorian Praefect of the Gauls, and the\r\nMaster of the Horse for the Gauls) may possibly have disappeared; and\r\nyet, in view of the fact that Theodoric was during the greater part of\r\nhis reign ruler of a portion of Gaul, it is not necessary to assume\r\neven this change. Into the question of the military officers I will\r\nnot enter, as I confess that I do not understand the relations\r\n(whether co-ordinate or subordinated one to another) of the two pairs\r\nof officers, Nos. 4 and 5 and Nos. 12 and 13.\r\n\r\nThe rank and duties of the Praetorian Praefect of Italy, the Master of\r\nthe Offices, and the Quaestor have already been described in the first\r\nchapter. It will be well to say a few words as to the four remaining\r\ncivil dignitaries, the Praefect of the City, the Grand Chamberlain,\r\nthe Count of Sacred Largesses, and the Count of the Private Domains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praefect of the City.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _Praefectus Urbis Romae_ was by virtue of his office head of\r\nthe Senate. He had the care of the Annona or corn-largesses to the\r\npeople, the command of the City-watch, and the duty of keeping the\r\naqueducts in proper repair. The shores and channel of the Tiber, the\r\nvast _cloacae_ which carried off the refuse of the City, the quays and\r\nwarehouses of Portus at the river's mouth were also under his\r\nauthority. The officer who was charged with taking the census, the\r\nofficers charged with levying the duties on wine, the masters of the\r\nmarkets, the superintendents of the granaries, the curators of the\r\nstatues, baths, theatres, and the other public buildings with which\r\nthe City was adorned, all owned the supreme control of the Urban\r\nPraefect. At the beginning of the Fifth Century the _Vicarius Urbis_\r\n(whom it is difficult not to think of as in some sort subject to the\r\n_Praefectus Urbis_), had jurisdiction over all central and southern\r\nItaly and Sicily. But if this was the arrangement then, it must have\r\nbeen altered before the time of Cassiodorus, who certainly appears as\r\nPraetorian Praefect to have wielded authority over the greater part of\r\nItaly. He states, however[113], that the Urban Praefect had, by an\r\nancient law, jurisdiction, not only over Rome itself, but over all the\r\ndistrict within 100 miles of the capital.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Var. vi. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grand Chamberlain.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _Praepositus Sacri Cubiculi_ had under his orders the large\r\nstaff of Grooms of the Bedchamber, at whose head stood the\r\n_Primicerius Cubiculariorum_, an officer of 'respectable' rank. The\r\n_Castrensis_, Butler or Seneschal, with his army of lacqueys and pages\r\nwho attended to the spreading and serving of the royal table; the\r\n_Comes Sacrae Vestis_, who with similar assistance took charge of the\r\nroyal wardrobe; the _Comes Domorum_, who perhaps superintended the\r\nneedful repairs of the royal palace, all took their orders in the last\r\nresort from the Grand Chamberlain. So, too, did the three Decurions,\r\nofficers with a splendid career of advancement before them, who\r\nmarshalled the thirty brilliantly armed Silentiarii, that paced\r\nbackwards and forwards before the purple veil guarding the slumbers of\r\nthe Sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Count of Sacred Largesses.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _Comes Sacrarum Largitionum_, theoretically only the Grand\r\nAlmoner of the Sovereign, discharged in practice many of the duties of\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. The mines, the mint, the Imperial linen\r\nfactories, the receipt of the tribute of the Provinces, and many other\r\ndepartments of the public revenue were originally under the care of\r\nthis functionary, whose office however, as we are expressly told by\r\nCassiodorus, had lost part of its lustre, probably by a transfer of\r\nsome of these duties to the Count of the Private Domains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Count of Private Domains.]\r\n\r\n(_d_) This Minister, the _Comes Rerum Privatarum_, had the\r\nsuperintendence of the Imperial estates in Italy and the Provinces.\r\nConfiscations and the absorption by the State of the properties of\r\ndefaulting tax-payers were probably always tending to increase the\r\nextent of these estates, and to make the office of Count of the Domain\r\nmore important. The collection of the land-tax, far the most important\r\nitem of the Imperial revenue, was also made subject to his authority.\r\nFinally, in order, as Cassiodorus quaintly observes[114], that his\r\njurisdiction should not be exercised only over slaves (the cultivators\r\nof the State domains), some authority was given to him within the\r\nCity, and by a curious division of labour all charges of incestuous\r\ncrime, or of the spoliation of graves, were brought before the\r\ntribunal of the Comes Privatarum.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Var. vi. 8.]\r\n\r\nBesides the thirteen persons who, as acting Ministers of the highest\r\nclass, were entitled to the designation of Illustris, there were also\r\nthose whom we may call honorary members of the class: the persons who\r\nhad received the dignity of the Patriciate--a dignity which was\r\nfrequently bestowed on those who had filled the office of Consul, and\r\nwhich, unlike the others of which we have been speaking, was held for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt is a question on which I think we need further information, whether\r\na person who had once filled an Illustrious office lost the right to\r\nbe so addressed on vacating it. I am not sure that we have any clear\r\ncase in the following collection of an ex-official holding this\r\ncourtesy-rank; but it seems probable that such would be the case.\r\n\r\nConsidering also the great show of honour with which the Consulate,\r\nthough now destitute of all real power, was still greeted, it seems\r\nprobable that the Consuls for the year would rank as Illustres; but\r\nhere, too, we seem to require fuller details.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spectabiles.]\r\n\r\nII. We now come to the Second Class, the _Spectabiles_, which consists\r\nchiefly of the lieutenants and deputies of the Illustres.\r\n\r\nFor instance, every Praetorian Praefect had immediately under him a\r\ncertain number of _Vicarii_, each of whom was a Spectabilis. The\r\nPraefecture included an extent of territory equivalent to two or three\r\ncountries of Modern Europe (for instance, the Praefecture of the Gauls\r\nembraced Britain, Gaul, a considerable slice of Germany, Spain, and\r\nMorocco). This was divided into Dioceses (in the instance above\r\nreferred to Britain formed one Diocese, Gaul another, and Spain with\r\nits attendant portion of Africa a third), and the Diocese was again\r\ndivided into Provinces. The title of the ruler of the Diocese, who in\r\nhis restricted but still ample domain wielded a similar authority to\r\nthat of the Illustrious Praefect, was _Spectabilis Vicarius_.\r\n\r\nBut the Praefect and the Vicar controlled only the civil government of\r\nthe territories over which they respectively bore sway. The military\r\ncommand of the Diocese was vested in a _Spectabilis Comes_, who was\r\nunder the orders of the Illustrious Magister Militum. Subordinate in\r\nsome way to the Comes was the _Dux_, who was also a Spectabilis, but\r\nwhose precise relation to his superior the Comes is, to me at least,\r\nnot yet clear[115].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: I think the usual account of the matter is that which I\r\nhave given elsewhere (Italy and her Invaders, i. 227), that the Comes\r\nhad military command in the Diocese and the Dux in the Province. But\r\non closer examination I cannot find that the Notitia altogether bears\r\nout this view. It gives us for the Western Empire eight Comites and\r\ntwelve Duces. The former pretty nearly correspond to the Dioceses, but\r\nthe latter are far too few for the Provinces, which number forty-two,\r\nexcluding all the Provinces of Italy. Besides, in some cases the\r\njurisdiction appears to be the same. Thus we have both a Dux and a\r\nComes Britanniarum, and the Dux Mauritaniae Caesariensis must, one\r\nwould think, have held command in a region as large or larger than the\r\nComes Tingitaniae. Again, we have a Comes Argentoratensis and a Dux\r\nMoguntiacensis, two officers whose power, one would think, was pretty\r\nnearly equal. The same may perhaps be said of the Comes Litoris\r\nSaxonici in Britain and the Dux Tractus Armoricani et Nervicani in\r\nGaul. While recognising a _general_ inferiority of the Dux to the\r\nComes, I do not think we can, with the Notitia before us, assert that\r\nthe Provincial Duces were regularly subordinated to the Diocesan\r\nComes, as the Provincial Consulares were to the Diocesan Vicarius. And\r\nthe fact that both Comes and Dux were addressed as Spectabilis rather\r\nconfirms this view.]\r\n\r\nBesides these three classes of dignitaries, the _Castrensis_, who was\r\na kind of head steward in the Imperial household, and most of the\r\nHeads of Departments in the great administrative offices, such as the\r\n_Primicerius Notariorum_ and the _Magistri Scriniorum_[116], bore the\r\ntitle of Spectabilis. We have perhaps hardly sufficient data for an\r\nexact calculation, but I conjecture that there would be as many as\r\nfifty or sixty Spectabiles in the Kingdom of Theodoric.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Probably, from the order in which they are mentioned by\r\nthe Notitia.]\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the epithet _Sublimis_ (which is almost unknown\r\nto the Theodosian Code), when it occurs in the 'Variae' is used as\r\nsynonymous with Spectabilis[117].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Sublimis occurs in the superscription of the following\r\nletters: i. 2; iv. 17; v. 25, 30, and 36; ix. 11 and 14; xii. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clarissimi.]\r\n\r\nIII. The _Clarissimi_ were the third rank in the official hierarchy.\r\nTo our minds it may appear strange that the 'most renowned' should\r\ncome below 'the respectable,' but such was the Imperial pleasure. The\r\ntitle 'Clarissimus' had moreover its own value, for from the time of\r\nConstantine onwards it was conferred on all the members of the Senate,\r\nand was in fact identical with Senator[118]; and this was doubtless,\r\nas Usener points out[119], the reason why the letters Cl. were still\r\nappended to a Roman nobleman's name after he had risen higher in the\r\nofficial scale and was entitled to be called Spectabilis or\r\nIllustris. The _Consulares_ or _Correctores_, who administered the\r\nProvinces under the Vicarii, were called Clarissimi; and we shall\r\nobserve in the collection before us many other cases in which the\r\ntitle is given to men in high, but not the highest, positions in the\r\nCivil Service of the State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: See Emil Kühn's Verfassung des Römischen Reichs i. 182,\r\nand the passages quoted there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: p. 31.]\r\n\r\nBesides the three classes above enumerated there were also:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perfectissimi.]\r\n\r\nIV. The _Perfectissimi_, to which some of the smaller provincial\r\ngovernors belonged, as well as some of the clerks in the Revenue\r\nOffices (Numerarii) who had seen long service, and even some veteran\r\nDecurions.\r\n\r\nBelow these again were:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Egregii.]\r\n\r\nV. The _Egregii_, who were also Decurions who had earned a right to\r\npromotion, or even what we should call veteran non-commissioned\r\nofficers in the army (Primipilares).\r\n\r\nBut of these two classes slight mention is made in the Theodosian\r\nCode, and none at all (I believe) in the 'Notitia' or the 'Letters of\r\nCassiodorus.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON THE OFFICIUM OF THE PRAEFECTUS PRAETORIO[120].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: To illustrate the Eleventh Book of the Variae, Letters\r\n18 to 35.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military character of the Roman Civil Service.]\r\n\r\nThe official staff that served under the Roman governors of high rank\r\nwas an elaborately organised body, with a carefully arranged system of\r\npromotion, and liberal superannuation allowances for those of its\r\nmembers who had attained a certain position in the office.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in consequence of the changes introduced by Diocletian and\r\nConstantine, the civil and military functions had been for the most\r\npart divided from one another, and it was now unusual to see the same\r\nmagistrate riding at the head of armies and hearing causes in the\r\nPraetorium, in theory the officers of the Courts of Justice were still\r\nmilitary officers. Their service was spoken of as a _militia_; the\r\ntype of their office was the _cingulum_, or military belt; and one of\r\nthe leading officers of the court, as we shall see, was styled\r\n_Cornicularius_, or trumpeter.\r\n\r\nThe Praetorian Praefect, whose office had been at first a purely\r\nmilitary one, had now for centuries been chiefly concerned in civil\r\nadministration, and as Judge over the highest court of appeal in the\r\nEmpire. His _Officium_ (or staff of subordinates) was, at any rate in\r\nthe Fifth Century, still the most complete and highly developed that\r\nserved under any great functionary; and probably the career which it\r\noffered to its members was more brilliant than any that they could\r\nlook for elsewhere. Accordingly, in studying the composition of this\r\nbody we shall familiarise ourselves with the type to which all the\r\nother _officia_ throughout the Empire more or less closely\r\napproximated.\r\n\r\nNOTITIA.

In the case\r\nof the officium of the Praetorian Praefect, however, this officer\r\nseems, after the compilation of the 'Notitia,' to have disappeared,\r\nand his rights and privileges became vested in the Cornicularius. It\r\nwill be observed that in the letters of Cassiodorus to the members of\r\nhis staff there is none addressed to the Princeps; and similarly there\r\nis no mention of a Princeps as serving under the Praetorian Praefect\r\nin the treatise of Lydus. This elimination of the Princeps, however,\r\nwas not universally applicable to all the officia. Cassiodorus (xi.\r\n35) mentions a _Princeps Augustorum_, who was, perhaps, Princeps of\r\nthe _Agentes in Rebus_; and Lydus more distinctly ('De Mag.' iii. 24)\r\nspeaks of a bargain made between the Cornicularius of the Praetorian\r\nPraefect and the [Greek: Prinkips tôn magistrianôn], who must be\r\nsupposed to be Princeps in the officium of the _Magister Officiorum_,\r\nthough no such officer appears in the 'Notitia[123].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: See also Var. vii. 24 and 28.]\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, however, we may perhaps say that the greater part\r\nof what we are about to hear concerning the rights and endowments of\r\nthe Cornicularius in the Praefect's office might be truly asserted of\r\nthe Princeps at the time when the 'Notitia' was compiled, before the\r\ntwo offices had been amalgamated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cornicularius.]\r\n\r\n(2) The _Cornicularius_. As to this officer we have a good many\r\ndetails in the pages of Joannes Lydus. The antiquarian and\r\netymological part of his information must generally be received with\r\ncaution; but as to the actual privileges of the office in the days of\r\nJustinian we may very safely speak after him, since it was an office\r\nwhich he himself held, and whose curtailed gains and privileges caused\r\nhim bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\n'The foremost in rank,' says he[124], 'of the Emperor's assistants\r\n(Adjutores) is even to this day called _Cornicularius_, that is to say\r\n_horned_ ([Greek: keraïtês]), or _fighting in the front rank_. For the\r\nplace of the monarch or the Caesar was in the middle of the army,\r\nwhere he alone might direct the stress of battle. This being the\r\nEmperor's place, according to Frontinus, on the left wing was posted\r\nthe Praefect or Master of the Horse, and on the right the Praetors or\r\nLegati, the latter being the officers left in charge of the army when\r\ntheir year of office was drawing to a close, to hold the command till\r\nthe new Consul should come out to take it from them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: De Mag. iii. 3, 4.]\r\n\r\n'Of the whole Legion then, amounting to 6,000 men, exclusive of\r\ncavalry and auxiliaries, as I before said, the _Cornicularius_ took\r\nthe foremost place; and for that reason he still presides over the\r\nwhole [civil] service, now that the Praefect, for reasons before\r\nstated, no longer goes forth to battle.\r\n\r\n'Since, then, all the rest of the staff are called assistants\r\n(_Adjutores_), the Praefect gives an intimation under his own hand to\r\nhim who is entering the service in what department ([Greek:\r\nkatalogos]) he is ordered to take up his station[125]. And the\r\nfollowing are the names of all the departments of the service. First\r\nthe _Cornicularius_, resplendent in all the dignity of a so-called\r\nCount ([Greek: komês]; comes; companion), but having not yet laid\r\naside his belt of office, nor received the honour of admission to the\r\npalace, or what they call brevet-rank (_codicilli vacantes_), which\r\nhonour at the end of his term of service is given to him, and to none\r\nof the other chiefs of departments[126].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Lydus here gives the Formula for the admission of\r\nassistants, 'et colloca eum in legione primâ adjutrice nostrâ,' which\r\nhe proceeds to translate into Greek for the benefit of his readers\r\n([Greek: kai taxeias auton en tô prôtô tagmati tô boêthounti hêmin]).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: I have slightly expanded a sentence here, but this is\r\nevidently the author's meaning.]\r\n\r\n'And after the Cornicularius follow:--\r\n\r\n      '2 Primiscrinii,\r\n      '2 Commentarisii,\r\n      '2 Regendarii,\r\n      '2 Curae Epistolarum,\r\n     '15 Scholae of Exceptores,\r\n\r\nand then the \"unlearned service\" of the Singularii[127].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Condensed from Lydus, De Mag. iii. 4-7.]\r\n\r\nAgain, further on[128], Lydus, who delights to 'magnify his office,'\r\ngives us this further information as to the rank and functions of the\r\nCornicularius:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Ib. iii. 22-24.]\r\n\r\n'Now that, if I am not mistaken, we have described all the various\r\nofficial grades, it is meet to set forth the history of the\r\nCornicularius, the venerable head of the Civil Service, the man who,\r\nas beginning and ending, sums up in himself the complete history of\r\nthe whole official order. The mere antiquity of his office is\r\nsufficient to establish his credit, seeing that he was the leader of\r\nhis troop for 1,300 years, and made his appearance in the world at the\r\nsame time with the sacred City of Rome itself: for the Cornicularius\r\nwas, from the first, attendant on the Master of the Horse, and the\r\nMaster of the Horse on the King, and thus the Cornicularius, if he\r\nretained nothing of his office but the name, would still be connected\r\nwith the very beginnings of the Roman State.\r\n\r\n'But from the time when Domitian appointed Fuscus to the office of\r\nPraefect of the Praetorians (an office which had been instituted by\r\nAugustus), and abolished the rank of Master of the Horse, taking upon\r\nhimself the command of the army[129], everything was changed.\r\nHenceforward, therefore, all affairs that were transacted in the\r\noffice of the Praefect were arranged by the Cornicularius alone, and\r\nhe received the revenues arising from them for his own refreshment.\r\nThis usage, which prevailed from the days of Domitian to our own\r\nTheodosius, was then changed, on account of the usurpation of Rufinus.\r\nFor the Emperor Arcadius, fearing the overgrown power of the\r\nPraefectoral office, passed a law that the Princeps of the Magister\r\n[Officiorum]'s staff[130] ... should appear in the highest courts, and\r\nshould busy himself with part of the Praefect's duties, and especially\r\nshould enquire into the principle upon which orders for the Imperial\r\npost-horses ([Greek: synthêmata]; _evectiones_) were granted[131]....\r\nThis order of Arcadius was inscribed in the earlier editions of the\r\nTheodosian Code, but has been omitted in the later as superfluous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: This seems to be the meaning of Lydus, but it is not\r\nclearly expressed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: There is something wanting in the text here.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: See Cod. Theod. vi. 29. 8, which looks rather like the\r\nlaw alluded to by Lydus, notwithstanding his remark about its\r\nomission.]\r\n\r\n'Thus, then, the Princeps of the Magistriani, being introduced into\r\nthe highest courts, but possessing nothing there beyond his mere empty\r\ndignity, made a bargain with the Cornicularius of the day, the object\r\nof which was to open up to him some portion of the business; and,\r\nhaving come to terms, the Princeps agreed to hand over to the\r\nCornicularius one pound's weight of gold [£40] monthly, and to give\r\ninstant gratuities to all his subordinates according to their rank in\r\nthe service. In consequence of this compact the Cornicularius then in\r\noffice, after receiving his 12 lbs. weight of gold without any\r\nabatement, with every show of honour conceded to his superior[132] (?)\r\nthe preferential right of introducing \"one-membered\" cases ([Greek:\r\ntên tôn monomerôn entuchiôn eisagôgên]), having reserved to himself,\r\nbeside the fees paid for promotion in the office[133], and other\r\nsources of gain, especially the sole right of subscribing the _Acta_\r\nof the court, and thus provided for himself a yearly revenue of not\r\nless than 1,000 aurei [£600].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: [Greek: tô kreittoni].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: [Greek: ek tou bathmou].]\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to translate as clearly as possible the obscure\r\nwords of Lydus as to this bargain between the two court-officers. The\r\ncomplaint of Lydus appears to be that the Cornicularius of the day, by\r\ntaking the money of the Princeps Magistrianorum, and conceding to him\r\nin return the preferential claim to manage 'one-membered' cases (or\r\nunopposed business), made a purse for himself, but prepared the way\r\nfor the ruin of his successors. The monthly payment was, I think, to\r\nbe made for twelve months only, and thus the whole amount which the\r\nCornicularius received from this source was only £480, but from other\r\nsources--chiefly the sums paid for promotion by the subordinate\r\nmembers of the _officium_, and the fees charged by him for affixing\r\nhis subscription to the _acta_ of the court--he still remained in\r\nreceipt of a yearly revenue of £600.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jealousy between the Officia of the Praefect and the\r\nMagister.]\r\n\r\nThe jealousy between the Officia of the Praetorian Praefect and the\r\nMagister Officiorum was intense. Almost every line in the treatise of\r\nLydus testifies to it, and shows that the former office, in which he\r\nhad the misfortune to serve, was being roughly shouldered out of the\r\nway by its younger and more unscrupulous competitor.\r\n\r\nLydus continues[134]: 'Now, what followed, like the Peleus of\r\nEuripides, I can never describe without tears. For on account of all\r\nthese sources of revenue having been dried up, I myself have had to\r\nbear my part in the general misery of our time, since, though I have\r\nreached the highest grade of promotion in the service, I have derived\r\nnothing from it but the bare name. I do not blush to call Justice\r\nherself as a witness to the truth of what I say, when I affirm that I\r\nam not conscious of having received one obol from the Princeps, nor\r\nfrom the Letters Patent for promotions in the office[135]. For indeed\r\nwhence should I have derived it, since it was the ancient custom that\r\nthose who in any way appeared in the highest courts should pay to the\r\n_officium_ seven and thirty _aurei_ [£22] for a \"one-membered\" suit;\r\nbut ever after this bargain was made there has been given only a very\r\nmoderate sum of copper--not gold--in a beggarly way, as if one were\r\nbuying a flask of oil, and that not regularly? Or how compel the\r\nPrinceps to pay the ancient covenanted sum to the Cornicularius of the\r\nday, when he now scarcely remembered the bare name of that officer, as\r\nhe never condescended to be present in the court when promotions were\r\nmade from a lower grade to a higher? Bitterly do I regret that I was\r\nso late in coming to perceive for what a paltry price I was rendering\r\nmy long services as assistant in the courts, receiving in fact nothing\r\ntherefrom as my own _solatium_. It serves me right, however, for\r\nhaving chosen that line of employment, as I will explain, if the\r\nreader will allow me to recount to him my career from its commencement\r\nto the present time.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: De Mag. iii. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: [Greek: apo tôn legomenôn kompleusimôn], apparently the\r\nsame source of revenue as the promotion-money ([Greek: tên ek tou\r\nbathmou pronomian]).]\r\n\r\nLydus then goes on to describe his arrival at Constantinople (A.D.\r\n511), his intention to enter the _Scrinium Memoriae_ (in which he\r\nwould have served under the Magister Officiorum), and his abandonment\r\nof this intention upon the pressing entreaties of his countryman\r\nZoticus, who was at the time Praefectus Praetorio. This step Lydus\r\nlooks upon as the fatal mistake of his life, though the consequences\r\nof it to him were in some degree mitigated by the marriage which\r\nZoticus enabled him to make with a lady possessed of a fortune of 100\r\npounds' weight of gold (£4,000). Her property, her virtues (for 'she\r\nwas superior to all women who have ever been admired for their moral\r\nexcellence'), and the consolations of Philosophy and Literature, did\r\nmuch to soothe the disappointment of Lydus, who nevertheless felt,\r\nwhen he retired to his books after forty years of service, in which he\r\nhad reached the unrewarded post of Cornicularius, that his official\r\nlife had been a failure.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed worth while to give this sketch of the actual career of\r\na Byzantine official, as it may illustrate in some points the lives of\r\nthe functionaries to whom so many of the letters of Cassiodorus are\r\naddressed; though I know not whether we have any indications of such a\r\nrivalry at Ravenna as that which prevailed at Constantinople between\r\nthe _officium_ of the Praefect and that of the Magister. We now pass\r\non to\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adjutor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Primiscrinius.]\r\n\r\n(3) The _Adjutor_. Some of the uses of this term are very perplexing.\r\nIt seems clear (from Lydus, 'De Mag.' iii. 3) that all the members of\r\nthe officium were known by the generic name _Adjutores_. Here however\r\nwe may perhaps safely assume that Adjutor means simply an assistant to\r\nthe officer next above him, as we find, lower down in the list of the\r\n'Notitia,' the Exceptores followed by their Adjutores. We may find a\r\nparallel to Adjutor in the word Lieutenant, which, for the same reason\r\nis applied to officers of such different rank as the Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland, a Lieutenant-General, a Lieutenant-Colonel, and a simple\r\nLieutenant in the Army or Navy. In the lists of Cassiodorus and Lydus\r\nwe find no mention of an officer bearing the special name of Adjutor,\r\nbut we meet instead with a _Primiscrinius_, of whom, according to\r\nLydus, there were two. He says[136], 'After the Cornicularius are two\r\nPrimiscrinii, whom the Greeks call first of the service[137].' And\r\nlater on[138], when he is describing the course of business in the\r\n_secretum_ of the Praefect, as it used to be in the good old days, he\r\ninforms us that after judgment had been given, and the Secretarii had\r\nread to the litigant the decree prepared by the Assessors and\r\ncarefully copied by one of the Cancellarii, and after an accurate\r\ndigest of the case had been prepared in the Latin language by a\r\nSecretarius, in order to guard against future error or\r\nmisrepresentation, the successful litigant passed on with the decree\r\nin his hand _to the Primiscrinii, who appointed an officer to execute\r\nthe judgment of the Court_[139]. These men then put the decree into\r\nits final shape by means of the persons appointed to assist them[140]\r\n(men who could puzzle even the professors themselves in logical\r\ndiscussions), and endorsed it on the litigant's petition in characters\r\nwhich at once struck awe into the reader, and which seemed actually\r\nswollen with official importance[141]. The name and titles of the\r\n'completing' officer were then subscribed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: De Mag. iii. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: [Greek: meta de ton kornikoularion primiskrinioi duo,\r\nous Hellênes prôtous tês taxeôs kalousi].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: De Mag. iii. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: [Greek: parêei pros tous primiskrinious taxantas\r\nekbibastên tois apopephasmenois]. Probably we should read [Greek:\r\ntaxontas] for [Greek: taxantas].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: [Greek: eplêroun dia tôn boêthein autois tetagmenôn] (?\r\nAdjutores).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: [Greek: epi tou nôtou tês entuchias grammasin aidous\r\nautothen apasês kai exousias onkô sesobêmenois].]\r\n\r\nIf the suggestion that the Primiscrinii were considered as in some\r\nsense substitutes (Adjutores) for the Cornicularius be correct, we may\r\nperhaps account for there being two of them in the days of Lydus by\r\nthe disappearance of the Princeps. The office of Cornicularius had\r\nswallowed up that of Princeps, and accordingly the single Adjutor, who\r\nwas sufficient at the compilation of the 'Notitia,' had to be\r\nmultiplied by two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commentariensis, or Commentarisius.]\r\n\r\n(4) The _Commentariensis_. Here we come again to an officer who is\r\nmentioned by all our three authorities, though in Cassiodorus he seems\r\nto be degraded some steps below his proper rank (but this may only be\r\nfrom an accidental transposition of the order of the letters), and\r\nthough Lydus again gives us two of the name instead of one. The\r\nlast-named authority inserts next after the Primiscrinii 'two\r\nCommentarisii--so the law calls those who are appointed to attend to\r\nthe drawing up of indictments[142].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: [Greek: kommentarisioi duo (houtô de tous epi tôn\r\nhypomnêmatôn graphê tattomenous ho nomos kalei)] (iii. 4). I accept\r\nthe necessary emendation of the text proposed in the Bonn edition.]\r\n\r\nThe Commentariensis (or Commentarisius, as Lydus calls him[143]) was\r\nevidently the chief assistant of the Judge in all matters of criminal\r\njurisdiction[144]. We have a remarkably full, and in the main clear\r\naccount of his functions in the pages of Lydus (iii. 16-18), from\r\nwhich it appears that he was promoted from the ranks of the\r\n_Exceptores_ (shorthand writers), and had six of his former colleagues\r\nserving under him as Adjutores[145]. Great was the power, and high the\r\nposition in the Civil Service, of the Commentariensis. The whole tribe\r\nof process-servers, gaolers, lictors[146]--all that we now understand\r\nby the police force--waited subserviently on his nod. It rested with\r\nhim, says Lydus, to establish the authority of the Court of Justice\r\nby means of the wholesome fear inspired by iron chains and scourges\r\nand the whole apparatus of torture[147]. Nay, not only did the\r\nsubordinate magistrates execute their sentences by his agency, he had\r\neven the honour of being chosen by the Emperor himself to be the\r\nminister of vengeance against the persons who had incurred his anger\r\nor his suspicion. 'I myself remember,' says Lydus, 'when I was serving\r\nas Chartularius in the office of the Commentariensis, under the\r\npraefecture of Leontius (a man of the highest legal eminence), and\r\nwhen the wrath of Anastasius was kindled against Apion, a person of\r\nthe most exalted rank, and one who had assisted in his elevation to\r\nthe throne[148], at the same time when Kobad, King of Persia, blazed\r\nout into fury[149], that then all the confiscations and banishments\r\nwhich were ordered by the enraged Emperor were entrusted to no one\r\nelse but to the Commentarienses serving under the Praefect. In this\r\nservice they acquitted themselves so well, with such vigour, such\r\nharmonious energy, such entire clean-handedness and absence of all\r\ndishonest gain, as to move the admiration of the Emperor, who made use\r\nof them on all similar occasions that presented themselves in the\r\nremainder of his reign. They had even the honour of being employed\r\nagainst Macedonius, Patriarch of Constantinople, when that prelate had\r\nprovoked the Emperor by suspending all intercourse with him as a\r\nheretic; and that, although Celer, one of the most intimate friends of\r\nAnastasius, was at that very time holding the rank of Magister\r\nOfficiorum.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: To avoid confusion I will use the term\r\n'Commentariensis' throughout.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: So Bethmann Hollweg (p. 179), 'Diess ist der Gehülfe\r\ndes Magistrats bei Verwaltung der Criminaljustiz.' I compare him in\r\nthe following translation of Cassiodorus to a 'magistrate's clerk.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: See iii. 9 (p. 203, ed. Bonn), and combine with iii.\r\n16. The _Augustales_ referred to in the latter passage were a higher\r\nclass of Exceptores.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Applicitarii, Clavicularii, Lictores.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: [Greek: sidêreois desmois kai poinaiôn organôn kai\r\nplêktrôn poikilia saleuontôn tô phobô to dikastêrion] (iii. 16).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: [Greek: kai koinônêsantos autô tês basileias].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: [Greek: hote Kôadês ho Persês ephlegmaine]. The whole\r\npassage is mysterious, but we seem to have here an allusion to the\r\noutbreak of the Persian War (A.D. 502).]\r\n\r\nAn officer who was thus privileged to lay hands on Patriarch and\r\nPatrician in the name of Augustus was looked up to with awful\r\nreverence by all the lower members of the official hierarchy; and\r\nLydus, with one graphic touch, brings before us the glow of gratified\r\nself-love with which, when he was a subordinate _Scriniarius_, he\r\nfound himself honoured by the familiar conversation of so great a\r\nperson as the Commentariensis[150]: 'I too am struck with somewhat of\r\nmy old awe, recurring in memory to those who were then holders of the\r\noffice. I remember what fear of the Commentarisii fell upon all who at\r\nall took the lead in the _Officium_, but especially on the Scriniarii;\r\nand how greatly he who was favoured with a chat with a Commentarisius\r\npassing by valued himself on the honour.' Lydus also describes to us\r\nhow the Commentariensis, instructed by the Praefect, or perhaps even\r\nby the Emperor himself, would take with him one of his faithful\r\nservants, the Chartularii, would visit the abode of the suspected\r\nperson (who might, as we have seen, be one of the very highest\r\nofficers of the State), and would then in his presence dictate in\r\nsolemn Latin words the indictment which was to be laid against him,\r\nthe mere hearing of which sometimes brought the criminal to confess\r\nhis guilt and throw himself on the mercy of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: iii. 17 (p. 210).]\r\n\r\nIt was from this _commentum_, the equivalent of a French _acte\r\nd'accusation_, that the Commentariensis derived his title.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ab Actis (Scriniarius Actorum?).]\r\n\r\n(5) The _Ab Actis_. The officer who bore this title (which is perhaps\r\nthe same as the Scriniarius Actorum of Cassiodorus[151]) seems to have\r\nbeen exclusively concerned with civil cases, and perhaps held the same\r\nplace in reference to them that the Commentarienses held in criminal\r\nmatters[152]. Practically, his office appears to have been very much\r\nwhat we understand by that of _Chief Registrar_ of the Court. He (or\r\nthey, for in Lydus' time there were two _Ab Actis_ as well as two\r\nCommentarienses[153]) was chosen from the select body of shorthand\r\nwriters who were known as Augustales, and was assisted by six men of\r\nthe same class, 'men of high character and intelligence and still in\r\nthe vigour of their years[154].' His chief business--and in this he\r\nwas served by the _Nomenclatores_, who shouted out in a loud voice the\r\nnames of the litigants--was to introduce the plaintiff and defendant\r\ninto the Court, or to make a brief statement of the nature of the case\r\nto the presiding magistrate. He then had to watch the course of the\r\npleadings and listen to the Judge's decision, so as to be able to\r\nprepare a full statement of the case for the Registers or\r\nJournals[155] of the Court. These Registers--at least in the\r\nflourishing days of Roman jurisprudence--were most fully and\r\naccurately kept. Even the _Dies Nefasti_ were marked upon them, and\r\nthe reason for their being observed as legal holidays duly noted.\r\nElaborate indices, prepared by the Chartularii, made search an easy\r\nmatter to those who wished to ascertain what was the decision of the\r\nlaw upon every point; and the marginal notes, or _personalia_,\r\nprepared in Latin[156] by the Ab Actis or his assistants, were so\r\nexcellent and so full that sometimes when the original entry in the\r\nRegisters had been lost the whole case could be sufficiently\r\nreconstructed from them alone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Var. xi. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: This seems to be Bethmann Hollweg's view (p. 181).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: This we learn from iii. 20. They are not mentioned in\r\niii. 4, where we should have expected to find them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: [Greek: hex andres erastoi kai nounechestatoi kai\r\nsphrigôntes eti] (Lydus iii. 20).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: [Greek: rhegestôn ê kottidianôn (anti tou ephêmerôn)].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: [Greek: Italisti]. Of course the emphasis laid on this\r\npoint proceeds from the Greek nationality of our present authority.]\r\n\r\nThe question was already mooted at Constantinople in the sixth century\r\nwhence the Ab Actis derived his somewhat elliptical name; and our\r\narchaeology-loving scribe was able to inform his readers that as the\r\nofficer of the household who was called _A Pigmentis_ had the care of\r\nthe aromatic ointments of the Court; as the _A Sabanis_[157] had\r\ncharge of the bathing towels of the baths; as the _A Secretis_ (who\r\nwas called Ad Secretis by vulgar Byzantines, ignorant of the niceties\r\nof Latin grammar) was concerned in keeping the secret counsels of his\r\nSovereign: so the _Ab Actis_ derived his title from the Acts of the\r\nCourt which it was his duty to keep duly posted up and properly\r\nindexed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: [Greek: sabanon] = a towel.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Numerarii.]\r\n\r\n(6) The _Numerarii_ (whose exact number is not stated in the\r\n'Notitia'[158]) were the cashiers of the Praefect's office. Though\r\nfrequently mentioned in the Theodosian Code, and though persons\r\nexercising this function must always have existed in a great Court of\r\nJustice like the Praefect's, we hear but little of them from\r\nCassiodorus[159]; and Lydus' notices of the [Greek: diapsêphistai],\r\nwho seem to correspond to the Numerarii[160], are scanty and\r\nimperfect. Our German commentator has collected the passages of the\r\nTheodosian Code which relate to this class of officers, and has shown\r\nthat on account of their rapacity and extortion their office was\r\nsubjected to a continual process of degradation. All the Numerarii,\r\nexcept those of the two highest classes of judges[161], were degraded\r\ninto _Tabularii_, a name which had previously indicated the cashiers\r\nof a municipality as distinguished from those in the Imperial service;\r\nand the Numerarii, even of the Praetorian Praefect himself, were made\r\nsubject to examination by torture. This was not only to be dreaded on\r\naccount of the bodily suffering which it inflicted, but was also a\r\nmark of the humble condition of those to whom it was applied.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Except, as before stated, those in the office of the\r\nPraetorian Praefect for Illyricum. These were four in number, and one\r\nof them had charge of 'gold,' another of '[public] works.' Further\r\ninformation is requisite to enable us to explain these entries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: They are alluded to in Var. xii. 13. The Canonicarii\r\n(Tax-collectors) had plundered the Churches of Bruttii and Lucania in\r\nthe name of 'sedis nostrae Numerarii;' but the Numerarii with holy\r\nhorror declared that they had received no part of the spoils.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: See Bethmann Hollweg, 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Illustres and Spectabiles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scriniarius Curae Militaris.]\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps see in the _Scriniarius Curae Militaris_ of\r\nCassiodorus[162] one of these Numerarii detailed for service as\r\npaymaster to the soldiers who waited upon the orders of the Praefect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: xi. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subadjuvae.]\r\n\r\n(7) The _Subadjuvae_. This is probably a somewhat vague term, like\r\nAdjutores, and indicates a second and lower class of cashiers who\r\nacted as deputies for the regular Numerarii.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cura Epistolarum.]\r\n\r\n(8) _Cura Epistolarum._ The officer who bore this title appears to\r\nhave had the duty of copying out all letters relating to fiscal\r\nmatters[163]. This theory as to his office is confirmed by the words\r\nof Cassiodorus (Var. xi. 23): 'Let Constantinian on his promotion\r\nreceive the care of the letters relating to the land-tax' (Hic itaque\r\nepistolarum _canonicarum_ curam provectus accipiat).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: This is Bethmann Hollweg's interpretation of the words\r\nof Lydus, [Greek: hoi tas men epi tois dêmosiois phoitôsas psêphous\r\ngraphousi monon, to loipon kataphronoumenoi] (iii. 21). In another\r\npassage (iii. 4, 5) Lydus appears to assign a reason for the fact that\r\nthe Praefectus Urbis Constantinopolitanae, the Magister Militum, and\r\nthe Magister Officiorum had no _Cura Epistolarum_ on their staff; but\r\nthe paragraph is to me hopelessly obscure. Curiously enough, too,\r\nwhile he avers that every department of the State (perhaps every\r\ndiocese) had, as a rule, its own Curae Epistolarum, he limits the two\r\nin the Praetorian Praefect's office to the diocese of Pontica ([Greek:\r\nkoura epistolaroum Pontikês duo]).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regerendarius, or Regendarius.]\r\n\r\n(9) _Regerendarius_, or _Regendarius_[164]. This officer had the\r\ncharge of all contracts relating to the very important department of\r\nthe _Cursus Publicus_, or Imperial Mail Service. At the time of the\r\ncompilation of the 'Notitia' only one person appears to have acted in\r\nthis capacity under each Praefect. When Lydus wrote, there were two\r\nRegendarii in each Praefecture, but, owing to the increasing influence\r\nof the Magister Officiorum over the Cursus Publicus[165], their office\r\nhad become apparently little more than an ill-paid sinecure. As we\r\nhear nothing of similar changes in the West, the Cursus Publicus was\r\nprobably a part of the public service which was directly under the\r\ncontrol of Cassiodorus when Praetorian Praefect, and was administered\r\nat his bidding by one or more Regendarii.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: The first form of the name is found in the Notitia, the\r\nsecond in Lydus and Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: It is not easy to make out exactly what Lydus wishes us\r\nto understand about the Cursus Publicus; but I think his statements\r\namount to this, that it was taken by Arcadius from the Praetorian\r\nPraefect and given to the Magister Officiorum, was afterwards restored\r\nto the Praefect, and finally was in effect destroyed by the corrupt\r\nadministration of John of Cappadocia. (See ii. 10; iii. 21, 61.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exceptores.]\r\n\r\n(10) We now come to the _Exceptores_, or shorthand writers[166], a\r\nlarge and fluctuating body who stood on the lowest step of the\r\nofficial ladder[167] and formed the raw material out of which all its\r\nhigher functionaries were fashioned in the regular order of promotion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: The [Greek: tachygraphoi] of Lydus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: In making this statement I consider the Adjutores to be\r\nvirtually another class of Exceptores, and I purposely omit the\r\nSingularii as not belonging to the _Militia Litterata_, which alone I\r\nam now considering.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustales.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deputati.]\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Lydus[168], that in his time the Exceptores in the\r\nEastern Empire were divided into two corps, the higher one called\r\n_Augustales_, who were limited in number to thirty, and the lower, of\r\nindefinite number and composing the rank and file of the profession.\r\nThe Augustales only could aspire to the rank of Cornicularius; but in\r\norder that some prizes might still be left of possible attainment by\r\nthe larger class, the rank of Primiscrinius was tenable by those who\r\nremained 'on the rolls of the Exceptores.' The reason for this change\r\nwas that the unchecked application of the principle of seniority to so\r\nlarge a body of public servants was throwing all the more important\r\noffices in the Courts of Justice into the hands of old men. The\r\nprinciple of 'seniority tempered by selection' was therefore\r\nintroduced, and the ablest and most learned members of the class of\r\nExceptores were drafted off into this favoured section of Augustales,\r\nfifteen of the most experienced of whom were appropriated to the\r\nspecial service of the Emperor, while the other fifteen filled the\r\nhigher offices (with the exception of the Primiscriniate) in the\r\nPraefectoral Courts[169]. The first fifteen were called\r\n_Deputati_[170], the others were apparently known simply as\r\nAugustales.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: iii. 6, 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: I think this is a fair summary of Lydus iii. 9 and 10,\r\nbut these paragraphs are very difficult and obscure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: We should certainly have expected that the Augustales\r\nwould be those writers who were specially appropriated to the\r\nEmperor's service, but the other conclusion necessarily follows from\r\nthe language of Lydus (iii. 10): [Greek: hôste kai pentekaideka ex\r\nautôn tôn pepanôterôn peira te kai tô chronô kreittonôn pros\r\nhypographên tois basileusin aphoristhênai, ous eti kai nun dêpoutatous\r\nkalousin, hoi tou tagmatos tôn Augoustaliôn prôteuousin].]\r\n\r\nThe change thus described by Lydus appears to have been made in the\r\nWest as well as in the East, since we hear in the 'Variae' of\r\nCassiodorus (xi. 30) of the appointment of a certain Ursus to be\r\nPrimicerius of the Deputati, and of Beatus to take the same place\r\namong the Augustales[171].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: The form of the word must I think prevent us from\r\napplying the Princeps _Augustorum_ of xi. 35 to the same class of\r\nofficers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adjutores.]\r\n\r\n(11) The _Adjutores_ of the 'Notitia' were probably a lower class of\r\nExceptores, who may very likely have disappeared when the Augustales\r\nwere formed out of them by the process of differentiation which has\r\nbeen described above.\r\n\r\nWe have now gone through the whole of what was termed the 'Learned\r\nService[172]' mentioned in the 'Notitia,' with one exception--the\r\ntitle of an officer, in himself humble and obscure, who has given his\r\nname to the highest functionaries of mediaeval and modern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: [Greek: tous epi tais logikais tetagmenous\r\nleitourgiais] (Lydus iii. 7). [Greek: Peras men hode tôn logikôn tês\r\ntaxeôs systêmatôn] (iii. 21). The 'Learned Service' may be taken as\r\ncorresponding to 'a post fit for a gentleman,' in modern phraseology.\r\nIn our present Official Directories the members of the [Greek: logikê\r\ntaxis] appear to be all dignified with the title 'Esq.;' the others\r\nhave only 'Mr.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cancellarius.]\r\n\r\n(12) The _Cancellarius_ appears in the 'Notitia' only once[173], and\r\nthen in connection not with the Praetorian Praefect, but with the\r\nMaster of the Offices. At the very end of the Officium of this\r\ndignitary, after the six _Scholae_ and four _Scrinia_ of his\r\nsubordinates, and after the _Admissionales_, whom we must look upon as\r\nthe Ushers of the Court, comes the entry,\r\n\r\n     Cancellarii:\r\n\r\ntheir very number not stated, the office being too obscure to make a\r\nfew less or more a matter of importance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Occidentis ix. 15.]\r\n\r\nAfter the compilation of the 'Notitia' the office of Cancellarius\r\napparently rose somewhat in importance, and was introduced into other\r\ndepartments besides that of the Master of the Offices.\r\n\r\nOne Cancellarius appears attached to the Court of Cassiodorus as\r\nPraetorian Praefect, and from the admonitions addressed to him by his\r\nmaster[174], we see that he had it in his power considerably to aid\r\nthe administration of justice by his integrity, or to hinder it by\r\nshowing himself accessible to bribes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: In Var. xi. 6, which see.]\r\n\r\nIn describing the Cancellarius, as in almost every other part of his\r\ntreatise, Lydus has to tell a dismal story of ruin and decay[175]:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: iii. 36, 37.]\r\n\r\n'Now the Scriniarii [subordinates of the Magister Officiorum] are made\r\nCancellarii and Logothetes and purveyors of the Imperial table,\r\nwhereas in old time the Cancellarius was chosen only from the ranks of\r\nAugustales and Exceptores who had served with credit. In those days\r\nthe Judgment Hall [of the Praefect] recognised only two Cancellarii,\r\nwho received an _aureus_ apiece[176] per day from the Treasury. There\r\nwas aforetime in the Court of Justice a fence separating the\r\nMagistrate from his subordinates, and this fence, being made of long\r\nsplinters of wood placed diagonally, was called _cancellus_, from its\r\nlikeness to network, the regular Latin word for a net being casses,\r\nand the diminutive cancellus[177]. At this latticed barrier then stood\r\ntwo _Cancellarii_, by whom, since no one was allowed to approach the\r\njudgment-seat, paper was brought to the members of the staff and\r\nneedful messages were delivered. But now that the office owing to the\r\nnumber of its holders[178] has fallen into disrepute, and that the\r\nTreasury no longer makes a special provision for their maintenance,\r\nalmost all the hangers-on of the Courts of Law call themselves\r\nCancellarii; and, not only in the capital but in the Provinces, they\r\ngive themselves this title in order that they may be able more\r\neffectually to plunder the wealthy.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: About twelve shillings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: This derivation from casses is, of course, absurd.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: Can this be the meaning of [Greek: eis plêthos]?]\r\n\r\nThis description by Lydus, while it aptly illustrates Cassiodorus'\r\nexhortations to his Cancellarii to keep their hands clean from bribes,\r\nshows how lowly their office was still considered; and indeed, but for\r\nhis statement that it used to be filled by veteran Augustales, we\r\nmight almost have doubted whether it is rightly classed among the\r\n'Learned Services' at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of the Militia Literata.]\r\n\r\nNow at any rate we leave the ranks of the gentlemen of the Civil\r\nService behind us, and come to the 'Militia Illiterata,' of whom the\r\n'Notitia' enumerates only\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Militia Illiterata: Singularii.]\r\n\r\n(13) The _Singularii_, a class of men of whose useful services Lydus\r\nspeaks in terms of high praise, contrasting their modest efficiency\r\nwith the pompous verbosity[179] of the Magistriani (servants of the\r\nMaster of the Offices) by whom they were being generally superseded in\r\nhis day. They travelled through the Provinces, carrying the Praefect's\r\norders, and riding in a post-chaise drawn by a single horse (veredus),\r\nfrom which circumstance, according to Lydus, they derived their name\r\nSingularii[180].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: [Greek: Kompophakellorrêmosynê] =\r\nPomp-bundle-wordiness, an Aristophanic word.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: De Dignitatibus iii. 7.]\r\n\r\nWe observe that the letter of Cassiodorus[181] addressed to the\r\nretiring chief (Primicerius) of the Singularii informs him that he is\r\npromoted to a place among the King's Body-guard (Domestici et\r\nProtectores), a suitable reward for one who had not been a member of\r\nthe 'Learned Services.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: Var. xi. 31.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Singularii Lydus mentions the _Mancipes_, the men who were\r\neither actually slaves or were at any rate engaged in servile\r\noccupations; as, for instance, the bakers at the public bakeries, the\r\n_Rationalii_, who distributed the rations to the receivers of the\r\nannona[182], the _Applicitarii_ (officers of arrest), and\r\n_Clavicularii_ (gaolers), who, as we before heard, obeyed the mandate\r\nof the Commentariensis. The Lictors, I think, are not mentioned by\r\nhim. A corresponding class of men would probably be the _Apparitores_,\r\nwho in the 'Notitia' appear almost exclusively attached to the service\r\nof the great Ministers of War[183].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: This seems a probable explanation of a rather obscure\r\npassage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: See the following sections of the Notitia: Magister\r\nMilitum Praesentatis (Oriens v. 74, vi. 77; Occidens v. 281, vi. 93);\r\nM.M. per Orientem (Or. vii. 67); M.M. per Thracias (Or. viii. 61);\r\nM.M. per Illyricum (Or. ix. 56); Magister Equitum per Gallias (Occ.\r\nvii. 117). The only civil officer who has Apparitores is the Proconsul\r\nAchaiae (Oriens xxi. 14).]\r\n\r\nThus, it will be seen, from the well-paid and often highly-connected\r\nPrinceps, who, no doubt, discussed the business of the court with the\r\nPraetorian Praefect on terms of friendly though respectful\r\nfamiliarity, down to the gaoler and the lictor and the lowest of the\r\nhalf-servile _mancipes_, there was a regular gradation of rank, which\r\nstill preserved, in the staff of the highest court of justice in the\r\nland, all the traditions of subordination and discipline which had\r\nonce characterised the military organisation out of which it\r\noriginally sprang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Editiones Principes.]\r\n\r\nThe Ecclesiastical History ('Historia Tripartita') seems to have been\r\nthe first of the works of Cassiodorus to attract the notice of\r\nprinters at the revival of learning. The Editio Princeps of this book\r\n(folio) was printed by Johann Schuszler, at Augsburg, in 1472[184].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: This edition is described by Dibdin (Bibliotheca\r\nSpenceriana iii. 244-5).]\r\n\r\nThe Editio Princeps of the 'Chronicon' is contained in a collection of\r\nChronicles published at Basel in 1529 by Joannes Sichardus (printer,\r\nHenricus Petrus). The contribution of Cassiodorus is prefaced by an\r\nappropriate Epistle Dedicatory to Sir Thos. More, in which a parallel\r\nis suggested between the lives of these two literary statesmen.\r\n\r\nNext followed the Editio Princeps of the 'Variae,' published at\r\nAugsburg in 1533, by Mariangelus Accurtius.\r\n\r\nIn 1553, Joannes Cuspinianus, a counsellor of the Emperor Maximilian,\r\npublished at Basel a series of Chronicles with which he interwove the\r\nChronicle of Cassiodorus, and to which he prefixed a short life of our\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edition of Nivellius.]\r\n\r\nThe Editio Princeps of the collected works of Cassiodorus was\r\npublished at Paris in 1579 by Sebastianus Nivellius; and other\r\neditions by the same publisher followed in 1584 and 1589. This edition\r\ndoes not contain the Tripartite History, the Exposition of the\r\nPsalter, or the 'Complexiones' on the Epistles. Some notes, not\r\nwithout merit, are added, which were compiled in 1578 by 'Gulielmus\r\nFornerius, Parisiensis, Regius apud Aurelianenses Consiliarius et\r\nAntecessor.' The annotator says[185] that these notes had gradually\r\naccumulated on the margin of his copy of Cassiodorus, an author who\r\nhad been a favourite of his from youth, and whom he had often quoted\r\nin his forensic speeches.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: p. 492.]\r\n\r\nThe edition of Nivellius, which is evidently prepared with a view to\r\naid the historical rather than the theological study of the writings\r\nof Cassiodorus, contains also the Gothic history of Jordanus (sic),\r\nthe 'Edictum Theoderici,' the letter of Sidonius describing the Court\r\nof Theodoric II _the Visigoth_ (453-466), and the Panegyric of\r\nEnnodius on Theodoric the Great. The letter of Sidonius is evidently\r\ninserted owing to a confusion between the two Theodorics; and this\r\nerror has led many later commentators astray. But the reprint of the\r\n'Edictum Theoderici' is of great interest and value, because the MS.\r\nfrom which it was taken has since disappeared, and none other is known\r\nto be in existence. A letter is prefixed to the 'Edictum,' written by\r\nPierre Pithou to Edouard Molé, Dec. 31, 1578, and describing his\r\nreasons for sending this document to the publisher who was printing\r\nthe works of Cassiodorus. At the same time, 'that the West might not\r\nhave cause to envy the East,' he sent a MS. of the 'Leges\r\nWisigothorum,' with illustrative extracts from Isidore and Procopius,\r\nwhich is printed at the end of Nivellius' edition.\r\n\r\nI express no opinion about the text of this edition; but it possesses\r\nthe advantage of an Index to the 'Variae' only, which will be found at\r\nthe end of the Panegyric of Ennodius. Garet's Index, which is in\r\nitself not so full, has the additional disadvantage of being muddled\r\nup with the utterly alien matter of the Tripartite History.\r\n\r\nIn 1588 appeared an edition in 4to. of the works of Cassiodorus (still\r\nexcluding the Tripartite History and the Biblical Commentaries),\r\npublished at Paris by Marc Orry. This was republished in 1600 in two\r\nvolumes 12mo.\r\n\r\nThe 'Variae' and 'Chronicon' only, in 12mo. were published at Lyons by\r\nJacques Chouet in 1595, and again by Pierre and Jacques Chouet at\r\nGeneva in 1609, and by their successors in 1650. These editions\r\ncontain the notes of Pierre Brosse, Jurisconsult, as well as those of\r\nFornerius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edition of Garet.]\r\n\r\nIn 1679 appeared, in two volumes folio, the great Rouen edition by\r\nFrançois Jean Garet (of the Congregation of S. Maur), which has ever\r\nsince been the standard edition of the works of Cassiodorus. Garet\r\nspeaks of collating several MSS. of various ages for the text of this\r\nedition, especially mentioning 'Codex S. Audoeni' (deficient for Books\r\n5, 6, and 7 of the 'Variae'), 'et antiquissimae membranae S. Remigii\r\nRemensis' (containing only the first four books of the same\r\ncollection). A codex which once belonged to the jurist Cujacius, and\r\nwhich had been collated with Accurtius' text in 1575 by a certain\r\nClaude Grulart, seems to have given Garet some valuable readings by\r\nmeans of Grulart's notes, though the codex itself had disappeared.\r\nGaret's edition was re-issued at Venice in 1729, and more recently in\r\nMigne's 'Patrologia' (Paris, 1865), of which it forms vols. 69 and 70.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forthcoming Edition by Meyer.]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that all these editions will be\r\nrendered obsolete by the new edition which is expected to appear as a\r\nvolume of the 'Auctores Antiquissimi' in the _Monumenta Germaniae\r\nHistorica_. The editor is Professor Wilhelm Meyer, of Munich. The work\r\nhas been for some years announced as near completion, but I have not\r\nbeen able to ascertain how soon it may be expected to appear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supposed fragment of orations.]\r\n\r\nFinally, I must not omit to notice the fragments of an oration\r\npublished by Baudi de Vesme in the Transactions of the Royal Academy\r\nof Sciences at Turin (1846). Those fragments, which were found in a\r\npalimpsest MS. of the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, were first\r\npublished in 1822 by Angelo Mai, who was then disposed to attribute\r\nthem to Symmachus (the elder), and to assign them to the early part of\r\nthe fifth century. On reflection, however, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat they were probably the work of Cassiodorus, and formed part of a\r\npanegyric addressed to Theodoric. This theory appears now to meet with\r\ngeneral approval. The style is certainly very similar to that of\r\nCassiodorus; but, as will be inferred from the doubt as to their\r\norigin, there is little or nothing in these scanty fragments which\r\nadds anything to our knowledge of the history of Theodoric.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Life by Garet.]\r\n\r\nTo the literature relating to Cassiodorus the most important\r\ncontribution till recent times was the life by Garet prefixed to his\r\nedition of 1679. I cannot speak of this from a very minute\r\ninvestigation, but it seems to be a creditable performance, the work\r\nof one who had carefully studied the 'Variae,' but unfortunately quite\r\nmisleading as to the whole framework of the life of Cassiodorus, from\r\nthe confusion which it makes between him and his father, an error\r\nwhich Garet has probably done more than any other author to\r\nperpetuate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Life by St. Marthe.]\r\n\r\nThe life by Garet was paraphrased in French by Denys de _Ste. Marthe_\r\n('Vie de Cassiodore,' Paris, 1695), whose work has enjoyed a\r\nreputation to which it was not entitled on the ground either of\r\noriginality or accuracy, but which was probably due to the fact that\r\nthe handy octavo volume written in French was accessible to a wider\r\ncircle of readers than Garet's unwieldy folio in Latin. A more\r\noriginal performance was that of _Count Buat_ (in the 'Abhandlungen\r\nder Kurfürstlichen Bairischen Akademie der Wissenschaften,' Munich,\r\n1763); but this author, though he pointed out the cardinal error of\r\nGaret, his confusion between Senator and his father, introduced some\r\nfurther gratuitous entanglements of his own into the family history of\r\nthe Cassiodori.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern monographs.]\r\n\r\nAll these works, however, are rendered entirely obsolete by three\r\nexcellent monographs which have recently been published in Germany on\r\nthe life and writings of Cassiodorus. These are--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thorbecke.]\r\n\r\nAugust _Thorbecke's_ 'Cassiodorus Senator' (Heidelberg, 1867);\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Franz.]\r\n\r\nAdolph _Franz's_ 'M. Aurelius Cassiodorius Senator' (Breslau, 1872);\r\nand\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Usener.]\r\n\r\nHermann _Usener's_ 'Anecdoton Holderi' (Bonn, 1877), described in the\r\nsecond chapter of this introduction.\r\n\r\nThorbecke discusses the political, and Franz the religious and\r\nliterary aspects of the life of their common hero, and between them\r\nthey leave no point of importance in obscurity. Usener, as we have\r\nalready seen, brings an important contribution to our knowledge of the\r\nsubject in presenting us with Holder's fragment; and his Commentary\r\n(of eighty pages) on this fragment is a model of patient and\r\nexhaustive research. It seems probable that these three authors have\r\nreally said pretty nearly the last word about the life and writings of\r\nCassiodorus. In addition to these authors many writers of historical\r\nworks in Germany have of late years incidentally contributed to a more\r\naccurate understanding of the life and times of Cassiodorus.\r\n\r\n_Dahn_, in the third section of his 'Könige der Germanen' (Würzburg,\r\n1866), has written a treatise on the political system of the\r\nOstrogoths which is almost a continuous commentary on the 'Variae,'\r\nand from which I have derived the greatest possible assistance.\r\n\r\n_Köpke_, in his 'Anfänge des Königthums bei den Gothen' (Berlin,\r\n1859), has condensed into a small compass a large amount of useful\r\ndisquisition on Cassiodorus and his copyist Jordanes. The relation\r\nbetween these two writers was also elaborately discussed by _von\r\nSybel_ in his thesis 'De Fontibus Libri Jordanis' (Berlin, 1838), and\r\nby _Schirren_, in his monograph 'De Ratione quae inter Jordanem et\r\nCassiodorum intercedat' (Dorpat, 1885). The latter, though upon the\r\nwhole a creditable performance, is disfigured by one or two strange\r\nblunders, and not improved by some displays of irrelevant learning.\r\n\r\n_Von Schubert_, in his 'Unterwerfung der Alamannen unter die Franken'\r\n(Strassburg, 1884), throws some useful light on the question of the\r\ndate of the early letters in the 'Variae;' and _Binding_, in his\r\n'Geschichte des Burgundisch-Romanischen Königreichs' (Leipzig, 1868),\r\ndiscusses the relations between Theodoric and the Sovereigns of Gaul,\r\nas disclosed by the same collection of letters, in a manner which I\r\nmust admit to be forcible, though I do not accept all his conclusions.\r\n\r\n_Mommsen_, in his paper 'Die Chronik des Cassiodorus Senator' (Vol.\r\nviii. of the 'Abhandlungen der Königlich Sächsischen Gesellschaft der\r\nWissenschaften;' Leipzig, 1861), has said all that is to be said\r\nconcerning the unfortunate 'Chronicon' of Cassiodorus, which he\r\nhandles with merciless severity.\r\n\r\nTo say that _Ebert_, in his 'Allgemeine Geschichte der Litteratur des\r\nMittelalters im Abendlande' (Leipzig, 1874), and _Wattenbach_, in his\r\n'Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter,' tell us with fullness\r\nand accuracy just what the student ought to wish to know concerning\r\nCassiodorus as an author, is only to say that they are Ebert and\r\nWattenbach. Every one who has had occasion to refer to these two books\r\nknows their merits.\r\n\r\nPassing from German literature, I regret that I am prevented by\r\nignorance of the Dutch language from forming an opinion as to the work\r\nof _Thijm_ ('Iets over M.A. Cassiodorus en zijne eeuw;' Amsterdam,\r\n1857), which is frequently quoted by my German authorities.\r\n\r\n_Gibbon_ of course quotes from the 'Variae,' and though he did not\r\nknow them intimately, he has with his usual sagacity apprehended the\r\ntrue character of the book and of its author. But the best account of\r\nthe 'Various Letters' in English, as far as I know, is unfortunately\r\nentombed in the pages of a periodical, being an article by Dean\r\n_Church_, contributed in July, 1880, to the 'Church Quarterly Review.'\r\nThere is also a very good though necessarily brief notice of\r\nCassiodorus in _Ugo Balzani's_ little volume on the 'Early Chroniclers\r\nof Italy,' published by the Christian Knowledge Society in 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following chronological table of the life of Cassiodorus I\r\nhave, for convenience sake, assumed 480 as the year of his birth, and\r\n575 as that of his death. It is now, I think, sufficiently proved that\r\nif these dates are not absolutely correct, they cannot be more than a\r\nyear or two wrong in one direction or the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consular Fasti.]\r\n\r\nAs dates were still reckoned by Consulships, at any rate through the\r\ngreater part of the life of Cassiodorus, I have inserted the Consular\r\nFasti for the period in question. It will be seen that several names\r\nof correspondents of Cassiodorus figure in this list. As a general\r\nthough not universal practice, one of the two Consuls at this time was\r\nchosen from out of the Senate of Rome and the other from that of\r\nConstantinople. We can almost always tell whether a chronicler belongs\r\nto the Eastern or Western Empire by observing whether he puts the\r\nEastern or Western Consul first. Thus, for A.D. 501, Marcellinus\r\nComes, who was an official of the Eastern Empire, gives us 'Pompeius\r\net Avienus, Coss.;' while Cassiodorus, in his 'Chronicon,' assigns the\r\nyear to 'Avienus et Pompeius.' Pompeius was a nobleman of\r\nConstantinople, nephew of the Emperor Anastasius; while Avienus was a\r\nRoman Senator[186]. Again, in A.D. 490, Marcellinus gives the names of\r\nLonginus and Faustus, which Cassiodorus quotes as Faustus and\r\nLonginus. Longinus was a brother of the Emperor Zeno, and Faustus was\r\nfor many years Praetorian Praefect under Theodoric, and was the\r\nreceiver of many letters in the following collection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: See Usener, p. 32.]\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to give the priority always to the _Western_ Consul\r\nin the list before us, except in those cases where an Emperor (who was\r\nof course an Eastern) condescended to assume the Consular _trabea_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indictions.]\r\n\r\nAnother mode of reckoning the dates which the reader will continually\r\nmeet with in the following pages is by _Indictions_. The Indiction, as\r\nis well known, was a cycle of fifteen years, during which, as we have\r\nreason to believe, the assessment for the taxes remained undisturbed,\r\na fresh valuation being made all round when the cycle was ended.\r\nTraces of this quindecennial period may be found in the third century,\r\nbut the formal adoption of the Indiction is generally assigned to the\r\nEmperor Constantine, and to the year 312[187]. The Indiction itself,\r\nand every one of the years composing it, began on the 1st of September\r\nof the calendar year. The reason for this period being chosen probably\r\nwas that the harvests of the year being then gathered in, the\r\ncollection of the tithes of the produce, which formed an important\r\npart of the Imperial revenue, could be at once proceeded with. What\r\ngives an especial importance to this method of dating by Indictions,\r\nfor the reader of the following letters is, that most of the great\r\noffices of State changed hands at the beginning of the year of the\r\nIndiction (Sept. 1), not at the beginning of the Calendar year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Compare Marquardt (Römische Staatsverwaltung ii. 237).\r\nHe remarks that the Indiction seems to have been first adopted in\r\nEgypt, and did not come into universal use all over the Empire till\r\nthe end of the Fourth Century.]\r\n\r\nTo make such a mode of dating the year at all satisfactory, it would\r\nseem to us necessary that the number of the cycle itself, as well as\r\nof the year in the cycle, should be given; for instance, that A.D. 313\r\nshould be called the first year of the first Indiction, and A.D. 351\r\nthe ninth year of the third Indiction. This practice, however, was not\r\nadopted till far on into the Middle Ages[188]. At the time we are\r\nspeaking of, the word Indiction seems generally to have been given\r\nnot to the cycle itself, but to the year in the cycle. Thus, 313 was\r\nthe first Indiction, 314 the second Indiction, 315 the third\r\nIndiction, and so on. And thus we find a year, which from other\r\nsources we know to be 313, called the first Indiction, 351 the ninth\r\nIndiction, 537 the fifteenth Indiction, without any clue being given\r\nto guide us to the important point in what cycles these years held\r\nrespectively the first, the ninth, and the fifteenth places.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: The Twelfth Century, according to Marquardt.]\r\n\r\nAs the Indiction began on the 1st of September a question arises\r\nwhether the calendar year is to be named after the number of the\r\nIndiction which belongs to its beginning or its end; whether, to go\r\nback to the beginning, A.D. 312 or A.D. 313 is to be accounted the\r\nfirst Indiction. The practice of the chroniclers and of most writers\r\non chronology appears to be in favour of the latter method, which is\r\nnatural, inasmuch as nine months of the Indiction belong to the later\r\ndate and only three to the earlier. Thus, for instance, Marcellinus\r\nComes calls the year of the Consulship of Belisarius, which was\r\nundoubtedly 535, 'Indictio XIII:' the thirteenth Indiction of that\r\ncycle having begun Sept. 1, 534, and ended August 31, 535. But it is\r\nwell that the student should be warned that our greatest English\r\nauthority, Mr. Fynes Clinton, adopts the other method. In the very\r\nuseful table of comparative chronology which he gives in his Fasti\r\nRomani[189] he assigns the Indiction to that year of the Christian era\r\nin which it had its beginning, and accordingly 534, not 535, is\r\nidentified with the thirteenth Indiction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Vol. ii. pp. 214-216. See his remarks, p. 210: 'The\r\nIndictions in Marcellinus and in the Tables of Du Fresnoy are compared\r\nwith the Consulship and the Julian year in which they end. In the\r\nfollowing Table they are compared with the year in which they begin,\r\nbecause the years of the Christian era are here made the measure of\r\nthe rest, and contain the beginnings of all the other epochs.']\r\n\r\nIn order to translate years of Indiction into years of the Christian\r\nera it is necessary first to add some multiple of 15 (_what_ multiple\r\nour knowledge of history must inform us) to 312. On the 1st of\r\nSeptember of the year so obtained the Indiction cycle began; and for\r\nany other year of the same cycle we must of course add its own number\r\nminus one. Thus, when we find Cassiodorus as Praetorian Praefect\r\nwriting a letter[190] informing Joannes of his appointment to the\r\noffice of Cancellarius 'for the _twelfth_ Indiction,' as we know\r\nwithin a little what date is wanted, we first of all add 14 x 15 (=\r\n210) to 312, and so obtain 522. The first Indiction in that cycle ran\r\nfrom September 1, 522, to August 31, 523. The twelfth Indiction was\r\ntherefore from September 1, 533, to August 31, 534, and that is the\r\ndate we require.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Var. xi. 6.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we find a letter written by Cassiodorus as\r\nPraetorian Praefect to the Provincials of Istria[191] as to the\r\npayment of tribute for the _first_ Indiction, we know that we must now\r\nhave entered upon a new cycle. We therefore add 15 x 15 (= 225) to\r\n312, and get 537. As it happens to be the _first_ Indiction that we\r\nrequire, our calculation ends here: September 1, 537, to August 31,\r\n538, is the answer required.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: Var. xii. 22.]\r\n\r\nIf anyone objects that such a system of chronology is cumbrous,\r\nuncertain, and utterly unscientific, I can only say that I entirely\r\nagree with him, and that the system is worthy of the perverted\r\ningenuity which produced the Nones and Ides of the Roman Calendar.\r\n\r\nIn the following tables I have not attempted to mark the years of the\r\nIndiction, on account of the confusion caused by the fact that two\r\ncalendar years require the same number. But I have denoted by the\r\nabbreviation 'Ind.' the years in which each cycle of the Indictions\r\n_began_. These years are 492, 507, 522, 537, 552, and 567.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chronological Tables._\r\n\r\n                   Private     Public        Rulers of\r\nA.D.   Consuls.    Events.     Events.

They desired me to do this, in order\r\nthat future generations might recognise the painful labours which I\r\nhad undergone for the public good, and the workings of my own unbribed\r\nconscience. I then replied that their very kindness for me might turn\r\nout to my disadvantage, since the letters which their good-will found\r\nacceptable might to future readers seem insipid. I reminded them also\r\nof the words of Horace, warning us of the dangers of hasty\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of writing.]\r\n\r\n'You see,' said I, 'that all require from me a speedy reply to their\r\npetitions; and do you think that I couch those replies in words which\r\nleave me nothing to regret hereafter? Our diction must be somewhat\r\nrude when there is no sufficient delay to enable the speaker to choose\r\nwords which shall rightly express the precise shade of his meaning.\r\nSpeech is the common gift of all mankind: it is embellishment\r\n(ornatus) alone which distinguishes between the learned and unlearned.\r\nThe author is told to keep his writings by him for nine years for\r\nreflection; but I have not as many hours, hardly as many moments. As\r\nsoon as I begin the petitioner worries me with his clamours, and\r\nhurries me too much to prevent my finishing cautiously, even if I have\r\nso begun my task. One vexes me past endurance by his interruptions and\r\ninnuendoes; another torments me with the doleful tale of his miseries;\r\nothers surround me with the mad shouts of their seditious\r\ncontentions[193]. In such circumstances how can you expect elegance of\r\nlanguage, when we have scarcely opportunity to put words together in\r\nany fashion? Even at night indescribable cares are flitting round our\r\ncouch[194], while we are harassed with fear lest the cities should\r\nlack their supplies of food--food which the common people insist upon\r\nmore than anything else, caring more for their bellies than for the\r\ngratification of their ears by eloquence. This thought obliges us to\r\nwander in imagination through all the Provinces, and ever to enquire\r\nafter the execution of our orders, since it is not enough to tell our\r\nstaff what has to be done, but the diligent administrator must see\r\nthat it is done[195]. Therefore, I pray you, spare us your harmful\r\nlove. I must decline this persuasion of yours, which will bring me\r\nmore of danger than of glory.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: 'Alii furiosa contentionum seditione circumdant.' This\r\nis probably meant to describe turbulent Goths.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: [Greek: ou chrê pannuchion eudein boulêphoron andra]\r\n(Il. ii. 24).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: Quia non sufficit agenda militibus imperare, nisi haec\r\nJudicis assiduitas videatur exigere.]\r\n\r\nSo I pleaded; but they plied me all the more with such arguments as\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Praefecture.]\r\n\r\n'All men have known you as Praefect of the Praetorian throne, a\r\ndignity which all other public employments wait upon like lacqueys.\r\nFor from this high office, ways and means for the army are demanded;\r\nfrom this, without any regard for the difficulty of the times, the\r\nfood of the people is required; on this, a weight of judicial\r\nresponsibility is thrown, which would be by itself a heavy burden. Now\r\nthe law, which has thrown this immense load on the Praefect's office,\r\nhas, on the other hand, honoured him by putting almost all things\r\nunder his control. In truth, what interval of leisure could you snatch\r\nfrom your public labours, when into your single breast flowed every\r\nclaim which could be made on behalf of the common good of all?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Quaestorship.]\r\n\r\n'We must add, moreover, that when you were on frequent occasions\r\ncharged with the office of the Quaestorship, the leisure which you\r\nmight have enjoyed was taken from you by your own constant\r\nthoughtfulness for the public good; and when you were thus bearing the\r\nweight of an honour which was not the highest, your Sovereigns used to\r\nlay upon you those duties, properly belonging to other offices, which\r\ntheir own holders were unable to discharge[196]. All these duties you\r\ndischarged with absolute freedom from corruption, following your\r\nfather's example in receiving, from those who hoped for your favour,\r\nnothing but the obligation to serve them, and bestowing on petitioners\r\nall that they had a right to ask for without traffic or reward.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: 'Addimus etiam quod frequenter Quaesturae vicibus\r\ningravato otii tempus adimit crebra cogitatio, et velut mediocribus\r\nfascibus insudanti, illa tibi de aliis honoribus principes videntur\r\nimponere, quae proprii Judices nequeunt explicare.' This is probably\r\nthe clearest account that is anywhere given of the peculiar and\r\nsomewhat undefined position held by Cassiodorus during the greater\r\npart of the reign of Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intimacy with Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n'Moreover, men know that the conversations which you were honoured by\r\nholding with the King occupied a large portion of your days, greatly\r\nto the public welfare[197], so that men of leisure have no right to\r\nexpect that their requirements shall be met by you, whose day was thus\r\noccupied with continuous toil[198]. But in truth this will redound yet\r\nmore to your glory, if amid so many and such severe labours you\r\nsucceed in writing that which is worthy to be read. Besides, your work\r\ncan without wounding their self-love instruct unlettered persons who\r\nare not prepared by any consciousness of eloquence for the service of\r\nthe Republic[199]; and the experience which you have gained by being\r\ntossed to and fro on the waves of stormy altercation, they in their\r\nmore tranquil lot may more fortunately make their own. Again (and here\r\nwe make an appeal which your loyalty cannot resist), if you allow\r\nposterity to be ignorant of the numerous benefits conferred by your\r\nKing, it is in vain that with benevolent eagerness he so often granted\r\nyour requests. Do not, we pray, draw back once more into silence and\r\nobscurity those who, while you were sounding their eulogies, seemed\r\nworthy to receive illustrious dignities. For you then professed to\r\ndescribe them with true praises, and to paint their characters with\r\nthe colours of history[200]. Now if you leave it to posterity to write\r\nthe panegyric on these men, you take away as it were from those who\r\ndie an honourable death the funeral oration to which, by the customs\r\nof our ancestors, they are entitled. Besides, in these letters you\r\ncorrect immorality with a ruler's authority; you break the insolence\r\nof the transgressor; you restore to the laws their reverence. Do you\r\nstill hesitate about publishing that which, as you know, satisfies so\r\nmany needs? Will you conceal, if we may say so, the mirror of your own\r\nmind, in which all ages to come may behold your likeness? Often does\r\nit happen that a man begets a son unlike himself, but his writings are\r\nhardly ever found unequal to his character[201]. The progeny of his\r\nown will is his truest child; what is born in the secret recesses of\r\nhis own heart is that by which posterity will know him best.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: 'Regum quinetiam gloriosa colloquia pro magnâ diei\r\nparte in bonum publicum te occupare noverunt.' It is difficult to\r\ntranslate the expressive term, 'gloriosa colloquia.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: 'Ut fastidium sit otiosis exspectare quae tu continuo\r\nlabore cognosceris sustinere.' I cannot translate this literally.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: 'Rudes viros et ad Rempublicam consciâ facundiâ\r\npraeparatos.' Surely some negative has dropped out of the latter\r\nclause.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: 'Tu enim illos assumpsisti verâ laude describere, et\r\nquodammodo historico colore depingere.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: 'Contingit enim dissimilem filium plerumque generari,\r\noratio dispar moribus vix potest inveniri.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gothic History.]\r\n\r\n'You have often, amid universal acclamation, pronounced the praises of\r\nkings and queens. In twelve books you have compiled the History of the\r\nGoths, culling the story of their triumphs[202]. Since these works\r\nhave had such favourable fortunes, and since you have thus served your\r\nfirst campaign in literature, why hesitate to give these productions\r\nof yours also to the public?'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: 'Duodecim libris Gothorum historiam _defloratis\r\nprosperitatibus_ condidisti.' By an extraordinary error this sentence\r\nhas been interpreted to mean that Cassiodorus wrote his history of the\r\nGoths after their prosperity had faded; and some writers have\r\naccordingly laboured, quite hopelessly, to bring down the composition\r\nof the Gothic History to a late period in the reign of Athalaric. It\r\nis perfectly clear from many passages that Cassiodorus uses\r\n'deflorare' in the sense of 'picking flowers,' 'culling a nosegay.'\r\nSee Historia Tripartita, Preface (twice); De Instit. Divin.\r\nLitterarum, cap. xxx; and De Orthographiâ, cap. ii (title). I doubt\r\nnot that careful search would discover many more instances. It is only\r\nstrange to me that Cassiodorus should, by the words 'defloratis\r\n_prosperitatibus_,' so naïvely confess the one-sided character of his\r\nhistory.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus consents to publish.]\r\n\r\nSo pleaded my friends, and to my shame I must own that I was\r\nconquered, and could no longer resist so many prayers; especially when\r\nI saw myself accused of want of affection. I have now only to crave my\r\nreaders' pardon; and if they find rashness and presumption in my\r\nattempt, to blame my advisers rather than me, since my own judgment\r\nagrees with that of my severest critic.\r\n\r\nAll the letters, therefore, which I have been able to find in various\r\npublic archives that had been dictated by me as Quaestor, as Magister\r\n[Officiorum], or as Praefect, are here collected and arranged in\r\ntwelve books. By the variety of subjects touched upon, the attention\r\nof the reader will be aroused, and it will be maintained by the\r\nfeeling that he is rapidly approaching the conclusion of the letter.\r\n\r\nI have also wished to preserve others from those unpolished and hasty\r\nforms of speech into which I am conscious that I have often fallen in\r\nannouncing the bestowal of dignities, a kind of document which is\r\noften asked for in such haste that there seems scarce time for the\r\nmere manual labour of writing it. I have therefore included in my\r\nSixth and Seventh Books _Formulae_ for the granting of all the\r\ndignities of the State, hoping thus to be of some service to myself,\r\nthough at a late period of my career, and to help my successors who\r\nmay be hard pressed for time. What I have thus written concerning the\r\npast will serve equally well for the future, since I have said nothing\r\nabout the qualities of the individual office-holder, but have made\r\nsuch explanations as seemed suitable concerning the office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reason of the title Variarum.]\r\n\r\nAs for the title of all twelve books, the index of the work, the\r\nherald of its meaning, the expression in briefest compass of the whole\r\nperformance, I have for this chosen the name VARIAE. And this, because\r\nit was necessary for me not always to use the same style, since I had\r\nundertaken to address various kinds of persons. One must speak in one\r\nway to men jaded with much reading; in another to those who skim\r\nlightly over the surface, tasting here and there; in another (if one\r\nwould persuade them), to persons who are devoid of a taste for\r\nletters, since it is sometimes a proof of skill to avoid the very\r\nthings which please the learned. In short, the definition given by our\r\nancestors is a good one: 'To speak fitly is to persuade the hearers to\r\naccept your wishes for their own.' Nor was it at random that the\r\nprudence of Antiquity thus defined the three modes of speaking:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The three styles of composition.]\r\n\r\n(1) The _humble_ style, which seems to creep along the ground in the\r\nvery expression of its thought.\r\n\r\n(2) The _middle_ style, which is neither swollen with self-importance\r\nnor shrunk into littleness; but being placed between the two, and\r\nenriched by a peculiar elegance, is contained within its own true\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\n(3) The _supreme_ style, which by exquisite phraseology is raised to\r\nthe very highest pitch of oratory.\r\n\r\nThe object of this distinction is that the various sorts and\r\nconditions of men may each receive their appropriate address, and that\r\nthe thoughts which proceed from the same breast may nevertheless flow\r\nin divers channels. No man is entitled to the name of eloquent who is\r\nnot prepared to do his duty manfully with the triple strength of these\r\nthree styles, as one cause after another may arise. It must be added\r\nhereto that we have sometimes to speak to Kings, sometimes to the\r\nOfficers of the Court, sometimes to the very humblest of the people.\r\nTo the last we may allowably pour out our words with some degree of\r\nhaste, but the other addresses should be deeply pondered before they\r\nare delivered. Deservedly therefore is a work entitled VARIAE, which\r\nis subject to so much diversity in its composition.\r\n\r\nWould that, as we have received these maxims from those who have gone\r\nbefore us, so our own compositions could claim the praise of having\r\nreduced them into practice. In sooth we do with shamefacedness\r\npromise that the Humble style shall be found in us; we think we may\r\nwithout dishonesty covenant for the Middle style; but the Supreme\r\nstyle, which on account of its nobility is the fitting language of a\r\nroyal Edict[203], we cannot hope that we have attained unto.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: The editors waver between 'quod est in edicto' and\r\n'quod est in edito (constitutum).']\r\n\r\nBut since we are to be read, let us abstain from further unlawful\r\ncanvassing for the votes of our readers. It is an incongruous thing\r\nfor us to be thus piling up our own discourses about ourselves: we\r\nought rather to wait for your judgment on our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING FORTY-SIX LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS IN THE NAME OF\r\nTHEODORIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KING THEODORIC TO EMPEROR ANASTASIUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persuasives to peace between Italy and Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n'It behoves us, most clement Emperor, to seek for peace, since there\r\nare no causes for anger between us.\r\n\r\n'Peace by which the nations profit; Peace the fair mother of all\r\nliberal arts, the softener of manners, the replenisher of the\r\ngenerations of mankind. Peace ought certainly to be an object of\r\ndesire to every kingdom.\r\n\r\n'Therefore, most pious of princes, it accords with your power and your\r\nglory that we who have already profited by your affection [personally]\r\nshould seek concord with your Empire. You are the fairest ornament of\r\nall realms; you are the healthful defence of the whole world, to which\r\nall other rulers rightfully look up with reverence[204], because they\r\nknow that there is in you something which is unlike all others[205]:\r\nwe above all, who by Divine help learned in your Republic the art of\r\ngoverning Romans with equity. Our royalty is an imitation of yours,\r\nmodelled on your good purpose, a copy of the only Empire; and in so\r\nfar as we follow you do we excel all other nations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: 'Vos totius orbis salutare praesidium, quod caeteri\r\ndominantes jure suspiciunt quia in vobis singulare aliquid inesse\r\ncognoscunt.' 'Suspiciunt' seems to give a better sense than the other\r\nreading, 'suscipiunt.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: 'Quia in vobis singulare aliquid inesse cognoscunt.']\r\n\r\n'Often have you exhorted me to love the Senate, to accept cordially\r\nthe laws of past Emperors, to join together in one all the members of\r\nItaly. How can you separate from your august alliance one whose\r\ncharacter you thus try to make conformable to your own? There is\r\nmoreover that noble sentiment, love for the City of Rome, from which\r\ntwo princes, both of whom govern in her name, should never be\r\ndisjoined.\r\n\r\n'We have thought fit therefore to send A and B[206] as ambassadors to\r\nyour most serene Piety, that Peace, which has been broken, through a\r\nvariety of causes, may, by the removal of all matters of dispute, be\r\nfirmly restored between us. For we think you will not suffer that any\r\ndiscord should remain between two Republics, which are declared to\r\nhave ever formed one body under their ancient princes[207], and which\r\nought not to be joined by a mere sentiment of love, but actively to\r\naid one another with all their powers. Let there be always one will,\r\none purpose in the Roman Kingdom. Therefore, while greeting you with\r\nour respectful salutations, we humbly beg that you will not remove\r\nfrom us the high honour of your Mildness's affection[208], which we\r\nhave a right to hope for if it were never granted to any others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: 'Illum atque illum.' I shall always render this phrase\r\n(which shows that Cassiodorus had not preserved the names of the\r\nambassadors) as above.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: 'Quia pati vos non credimus, inter utrasque\r\nRespublicas, quarum semper unum corpus sub antiquis principibus fuisse\r\ndeclaratur, aliquid discordiae permanere.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: 'Pomâ meute deposcimus ne suspendatis a nobis\r\nmansuetudinis vestrae gloriosissimam caritatem.']\r\n\r\n'The rest of their commission will be verbally conveyed to your Piety\r\nby the bearers of these letters[209].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: For some remarks on the date of this letter, see\r\nIntroduction, p. 23. The mention of interrupted peace, which evidently\r\nrequires not mere estrangement but an actual state of war, points to\r\nthe year 505, when Sabinian, the general of Anastasius, was defeated\r\nby the Ostrogoths and their allies at Horrea Margi; or to 508, when\r\nthe Imperial fleet made a raid on the coast of Apulia, as probable\r\ndates for the composition of the letter. Its place at the beginning of\r\nthe Variae does not at all imply priority in date to the letters which\r\nfollow it. It was evidently Cassiodorus' method to put in the\r\nforefront of every book in his collection a letter to an Emperor or\r\nKing, or other great personage.\r\n\r\nAs for the tone of the letter, and the exact character of the relation\r\nbetween the Courts of Ravenna and Constantinople which is indicated by\r\nit, there is room for a wide divergence of opinion. To me it does not\r\nseem to bear out Justinian's contention (recorded by Procopius, De\r\nBello Gotthico ii. 6) that Theodoric ruled Italy as the Emperor's\r\nlieutenant. Under all the apparent deference and affectation of\r\nhumility the language seems to me to be substantially that of one\r\nequal addressing another, older and with a somewhat more assured\r\nposition, but still an equal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. KING THEODORIC TO THEON, VIR SUBLIMIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manufacture of purple dye.]\r\n\r\n'We are informed by Count Stephen that the work of preparing the\r\npurple for the sacred (_i.e._ royal) robes, which was put under your\r\ncharge, has been interrupted through reprehensible negligence on your\r\npart. There must be neglect somewhere, or else the wool with its\r\nmilk-white hairs would long before now have imbibed the precious\r\nquality of the adorable _murex_. If the diver in the waters of\r\nHydruntum[210] had sought for these murex-shells at the proper season,\r\nthat Neptunian harvest, mixed with an abundant supply of water, would\r\nalready have generated the flame-bright liquid which dyes the robes\r\nthat adorn the throne. The colour of that dye is gay[211] with too\r\ngreat beauty; 'tis a blushing obscurity, an ensanguined blackness,\r\nwhich distinguishes the wearer from all others, and makes it\r\nimpossible for the human race not to know who is the king. It is\r\nmarvellous that that substance after death should for so long a time\r\nexude an amount of gore which one would hardly find flowing from the\r\nwounds of a living creature. For even six months after they have been\r\nseparated from the delights of the sea, these shell-fish are not\r\noffensive to the keenest nostrils, as if on purpose that that noble\r\nblood might inspire no disgust. Once this dye is imparted to the\r\ncloth, it remains there for ever; the tissue may be destroyed sooner\r\nthan part with it. If the murex has not changed its quality, if the\r\npress (torcular) is still there to receive its one vintage, it must be\r\nthe fault of the labourers that the dye is not forthcoming. What are\r\nthey doing, all those crowds of sailors, those families of rustics?\r\nAnd you who bear the name of Count, and were exalted high over your\r\nfellow-citizens on purpose that you might attend to this very thing,\r\nwhat sacrilegious negligence is this which you are manifesting in\r\nreference to the sacred vesture? If you have any care for your own\r\nsafety come at once with the purple[212], which you have hitherto been\r\naccustomed to render up every year. If not, if you think to mock us by\r\ndelay, we shall send you not a constrainer but an avenger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Otranto.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: Vernans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: Blatta.]\r\n\r\n'How easy was the discovery of this great branch of manufacture! A\r\ndog, keen with hunger, bounding along the Tyrian shore, crunched the\r\nshells which were cast up there. The purple gore dyed his jaws with a\r\nmarvellous colour; and the men who saw it, after the sudden fashion of\r\ninventors, conceived the idea of making therewith a noble adornment\r\nfor their kings. What Tyre is for the East, Hydron[213] is for\r\nItaly--the great cloth-factory of Courts, not keeping its old art\r\n(merely), but ever transmitting new improvements.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: I presume the same as Hydruntum (Otranto).]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. KING THEODORIC TO CASSIODORUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN[214].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Father of the Author.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of the father of Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\nExtols in high-flown language the merits of the minister who in the\r\nearly and troublous days of Theodoric's reign conciliated the wavering\r\naffections of the suspicious Sicilians[215], governed them so justly\r\nthat not even they (addicted as they are, according to Cicero, to\r\ngrumbling) could complain; then displayed equal rectitude in the\r\ngovernment of his own native Province of Bruttii and Lucania (hard as\r\nit is to be perfectly just in the government of one's own native\r\nplace); then administered the Praefecture in such a way as to earn the\r\nthanks of all Italy, even the taxes not being felt to be burdensome\r\nunder his rule, because so justly levied; and now, finally, as a\r\nreward for all these services, is raised to the distinguished honour\r\nof the Patriciate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: 'In ipso quippe imperii nostri devotus exordio, cum\r\nadhuc fluctuantibus rebus provinciarum corda vagarentur, et negligi\r\nrudem dominum novitas ipsa pateretur.']\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Introducing Cassiodorus (Senior) on his accession to the honours of\r\nthe Patriciate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great deeds of the ancestors of Cassiodorus for three\r\ngenerations.]\r\n\r\nCompliments to the Senate, of which Theodoric wishes to increase the\r\ndignity by bestowing honours on its most eminent members.\r\n\r\nRecital of the services and good qualities of Cassiodorus[216]:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Father of Cassiodorus Senator.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) as 'Comes Privatarum;'\r\n\r\n(_b_) as 'Comes Sacrarum Largitionum;'\r\n\r\n(_c_) as Governor of Provinces.\r\n\r\n(General reflections on the importance of a governor being himself a\r\nvirtuous man).\r\n\r\n'Having been trained thus to official life under the preceding King\r\n[Odovacar] he came with well-earned praises to our palace.'\r\n\r\n(_d_) His eminent career as Praetorian Praefect and modest demeanour\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nServices of previous members of his family. Fame seems to be always at\r\nhome among the Cassiodori. They are of noble birth, equally celebrated\r\namong orators and warriors, healthy of body, and very tall.\r\n\r\nHis father, _Cassiodorus_[217], was 'Tribunus et Notarius' under\r\nValentinian III. This last was a great honour, for only men of\r\nspotless life were associated with the Imperial 'Secretum.' A\r\nfriendship, founded on likeness, drew him to the side of Aetius, whose\r\nlabours for the State he shared.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: Grandfather of Cassiodorus Senator.]\r\n\r\n_Embassy to Attila._ 'With the son of this Aetius, named Carpilio, he\r\nwas sent on no vain embassy to Attila, the mighty in arms. He looked\r\nundaunted on the man before whom the Empire quailed. Calm in conscious\r\nstrength, he despised all those terrible wrathful faces that scowled\r\naround him. He did not hesitate to meet the full force of the\r\ninvectives of the madman who fancied himself about to grasp the Empire\r\nof the world. He found the King insolent; he left him pacified; and so\r\nably did he argue down all his slanderous pretexts for dispute that\r\nthough the Hun's interest was to quarrel with the richest Empire in\r\nthe world, he nevertheless condescended to seek its favour. The\r\nfirmness of the orator roused the fainting courage of his countrymen,\r\nand men felt that Rome could not be pronounced defenceless while she\r\nwas armed with such ambassadors. Thus did he bring back the peace\r\nwhich men had despaired of; and as earnestly as they had prayed for\r\nhis success, so thankfully did they welcome his return.'\r\n\r\nHe was offered honours and revenues, but preferred to seek the\r\npleasant retirement of Bruttii in the land which his exertions had\r\nfreed from the terror of the stranger.\r\n\r\nHis father, Cassiodorus[218], an 'Illustris,' defended the coasts of\r\nSicily and Bruttii from the Vandals, thus averting from those regions\r\nthe ruin which afterwards fell upon Rome from the same quarter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: Great-grandfather of Cassiodorus Senator.]\r\n\r\nIn the East, Heliodorus, a cousin of the Cassiodori, has brilliantly\r\ndischarged the office of Praefect for eighteen years, as Theodoric\r\nhimself can testify. Thus the family, conspicuous both in the Eastern\r\nand Western World, has two eyes with which it shines with equal\r\nbrilliancy in each Senate.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus is so wealthy that his herds of horses surpass those of\r\nthe King, to whom he makes presents of some of them in order to avoid\r\nenvy. 'Hence it arises that our present candidate [for patrician\r\nhonours] mounts the armies of the Goths; and having even improved upon\r\nhis education, generously administers the wealth which he received\r\nfrom his parents.\r\n\r\n'Now, Conscript Fathers, welcome and honour the new Patrician, who is\r\nso well worthy of a high place among you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING THEODORIC TO FLORIANUS, VIR SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium.]\r\n\r\n'Lawsuits must not be dragged on for ever. There must be some\r\npossibility of reaching a quiet haven. Wherefore, if the petitioners\r\nhave rightly informed us that the controversy as to the farm at\r\nMazenes has been decided in due course of law by Count Annas, and\r\nthere is no reasonable ground for appeal[219], let that sentence be\r\nheld final and irreversible. We must sometimes save a litigious man\r\nfrom himself, as a good doctor will not allow a patient to take that\r\nwhich is injurious to him.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: 'Nec aliqua probatur appellatione suspensa.']\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING THEODORIC TO AGAPITUS, PRAEFECTUS URBIS.\r\n\r\n[One of the MSS. reads _Pontifici_, but this is clearly wrong. The\r\nlanguage is not at all suitable to be addressed to a Pope, and there\r\nwas no Pope Agapetus till 535, nine years after the death of\r\nTheodoric.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mosaics ordered for Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n'I am going to build a great Basilica of Hercules at Ravenna, for I\r\nwish my age to match preceding ones in the beauty of its buildings,\r\nas it does in the happiness of the lives of my subjects.\r\n\r\n'Send me therefore skilful workers in Mosaic' [of which kind of work\r\nwe have a very good description as follows].\r\n\r\n_(Cassiodorus on Mosaic)._\r\n\r\n'Send us from your city some of your most skilful marble-workers, who\r\nmay join together those pieces which have been exquisitely divided,\r\nand, connecting together their different veins of colour, may\r\nadmirably represent the natural appearance[220]. From Art proceeds\r\nthis gift, which conquers Nature. And thus the discoloured surface of\r\nthe marble is woven into the loveliest variety of pictures; the value\r\nof the work, now as always, being increased by the minute labour which\r\nhas to be expended on the production of the Beautiful.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: 'Et venis colludentibus illigata naturalem faciem\r\nlaudabiliter mentiantur.']\r\n\r\n\r\n7. KING THEODORIC TO FELIX, VIR CLARISSIMUS.\r\n\r\nThis letter will be best understood by a reference to the following\r\npedigree:\r\n\r\n                                N.\r\n                                |\r\n            __________________________________________\r\n            |                   |                    |\r\nFELIX = A daughter.         NEOTHERIUS           PLUTIANUS\r\n                            [a spendthrift].     [a minor, whose\r\n                                                 guardian is\r\n                                                 Venantius].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inheritance of Plutianus.]\r\n\r\nApparently Felix is accused by Venantius, the guardian of his young\r\nbrother-in-law Plutianus, of having, on behalf of his wife, made an\r\nunfair division of the family property (which had been originally\r\ngiven to the father of these lads by Theodoric, as a reward for his\r\nservices). In doing this he has availed himself of the spendthrift\r\ncharacter of Neotherius, the elder brother, who was probably already\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nFelix is severely blamed, and ordered to hand over what he has\r\nfraudulently appropriated to the official, who is charged with the\r\nexecution of this mandate.\r\n\r\nBoth are summoned to the 'Comitatus' of the King, that a fair division\r\nmay there be made between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KING THEODORIC TO AMABILIS, THE COLLECTOR (EXSECUTOR).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The prodigality of Neotherius.]\r\n\r\nIn reference to this same matter of the wasted property of Plutianus.\r\nIt appears from this letter that Neotherius has been not merely a\r\nspendthrift, but has been actuated by motives of passionate hatred to\r\nhis younger brother[221]. The King enlarges on his obligation to\r\nprotect the weak, and orders the officer to see that justice is done\r\naccording to the representations of Venantius, unless the other side\r\nhave any counter plea to allege, in which case 'ad nostrum venire\r\ndeproperet comitatum.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: 'Neotherium fratrem suum, affectum germanitatis\r\noblitum, _bona parvuli hostili furore lacerasse_.']\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING THEODORIC TO EUSTORGIUS, BISHOP OF MILAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Offences charged against Ecclesiastics.]\r\n\r\n'You will be glad to hear that we are satisfied that the Bishop of\r\nAugusta [Turin or Aosta] has been falsely accused of betrayal of his\r\ncountry. He is therefore to be restored to his previous rank. His\r\naccusers, as they are themselves of the clerical order, are not\r\npunished by us, but sent to your Holiness to be dealt with according\r\nto the ecclesiastical tradition.'\r\n\r\n[The reflections in this letter about the impropriety of believing\r\nreadily accusations against a Bishop[222], and the course adopted of\r\nhanding over the clerical false accusers to be dealt with by their\r\nBishop, have an obvious bearing on the great Hildebrandic\r\ncontroversy. But as Dahn ('Könige der Germanen' iii. 191) points out,\r\nthere is no abandonment by the King of the ultimate right to punish an\r\necclesiastic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: 'Nihil enim in tali honore temeraria cogitatione\r\npraesumendum est, ubi si proposito creditur, etiam tacitus ab\r\nexcessibus excusatur. Manifesta proinde crimina in talibus vix capiunt\r\nfidem. Quidquid autem ex invidia dicitur, veritas non putatur.']\r\n\r\n\r\n10. KING THEODORIC TO BOETIUS[223], VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: If the MSS. are correctly represented in the printed\r\neditions, the name of the author of the Consolation of Philosophy was\r\nspelt Boetius in the Variae. There can be little doubt however that\r\nBoethius is the more correct form, and this is the form given us in\r\nthe Anecdoton Holderi.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frauds of the moneyers.]\r\n\r\nThe Horse and Foot Guards[224] seem to have complained that after\r\ntheir severe labours they were not paid in solidi of full weight by\r\nthe 'Arcarius Praefectorum.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Why are these called 'Domestici patres equitum et\r\npeditum?']\r\n\r\nCassiodorus gives--\r\n\r\n(1) Some sublime reflections in the true Cassiodorian vein on the\r\nnature of Arithmetic, by which earth and the heavens are ruled.\r\n\r\n(2) Some excellent practical remarks on the wickedness of clipping and\r\ndepreciating the currency.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting but most puzzling sentence in this letter is that\r\nin which he says that 'the ancients wished that the _solidus_ should\r\nconsist of 6,000 _denarii_, in order that the golden coin like a\r\ngolden sun might represent the 6,000 years which are the appointed age\r\nof the world.' But how can we reconcile this with any known solidus or\r\nany known denarius? The solidus of Constantine (72 to the lb.) was\r\nworth about twelve shillings. The reduced denarius of Diocletian was\r\nprobably worth one penny. At the very lowest (and most improbable)\r\ncomputation it was worth at least a farthing, and even thus one would\r\nonly get 576 to a solidus. The earlier denarius, worth about\r\neightpence, clearly will not do; and the matter is made more difficult\r\nby the fact that Cassiodorus is talking about the ancients (veteres),\r\nwhereas the solidus was a comparatively modern coin. It seems that\r\neither Cassiodorus has some entirely wrong information as to the early\r\ncurrency of Rome, or else that we have not yet got the clue to his\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nThis passage is quoted by Finlay ('Greece under the Romans,' p. 536,\r\ned. 1857), but the difficulty is not removed by his remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. KING THEODORIC TO SERVATUS, DUKE OF THE RAETIAS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violence of the Breones.]\r\n\r\n'It is your duty to repress all violence and injustice in the\r\nProvinces over which you preside. Maniarius complains that his slaves\r\n(mancipia) have been without any cause taken away from him by the\r\n_Breones_ [a Raetian tribe dwelling near the pass of the Brenner], who\r\nare continuing in peace the habits and maxims of war.\r\n\r\n'If this proves to be a true complaint, see that justice is done, and\r\nspeedily.'\r\n\r\n\r\n12. KING THEODORIC TO EUGENIUS (OR EUGENITES)[225], VIR ILLUSTRIS,\r\nMAGISTER OFFICIORUM.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: Perhaps the name really was Eugenes, -etis. See Var.\r\nviii. 19, and Ennodii, Epist. iv. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bestowal of dignity of Magister Officiorum.]\r\n\r\n'It is the glory of our reign to confer office on those who deserve\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'You are a learned man, and arrived long ago at the dignity of the\r\nQuaestorship as a reward for your creditable exertions as an Advocate.\r\n\r\n'One office leads to another: the tree of the fasces puts forth fresh\r\nfasces; and we therefore have great pleasure in calling you now to the\r\ndignity of Magister, bestowing upon you all the privileges which have\r\nbelonged to your predecessors in that office. Justify our choice by\r\nyour actions. You know, as one of our counsellors, what our standard\r\nof righteousness is. A sort of religious holiness is required from\r\nthose who hold office under a righteous king[226].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: 'Pio principi sub quodam sacerdotio serviatur.' Cf.\r\nClaudian, 'Nunquam libertas gratior exstat quam _sub rege pio_.']\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nAnnounces the elevation of Eugenius (or Eugenites) to the post of\r\nMaster of the Offices, and recapitulates his past services and\r\ncharacter in nearly the same terms as the preceding letter. He is to\r\ngo from one office to another, 'even as the sun having shone one day,\r\nrises in order to shine again on another. Even horses are stimulated\r\nto greater speed by the shouts of men. But man is an animal peculiarly\r\nfond of approbation. Do you therefore stimulate the new Master to all\r\nnoble deeds.'\r\n\r\n[Notice this sentence about the Senate: 'Whatever is the flower of the\r\nhuman race, the Senate ought to possess it: and as the citadel is the\r\ncrown of the city, so should your order be the ornament of all other\r\nranks.']\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAEPOSITUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Collection of 'Tertiae.']\r\n\r\n'We have no objection to grant the petition of the inhabitants of\r\nCathalia (?), that their \"Tertiae\" shall be collected at the same time\r\nas the ordinary tribute. What does it matter under what name the\r\n\"possessor\" pays his contribution, so long as he pays it without\r\ndeduction? Thus they will get rid of the suspected name of \"Tertiae,\"\r\nand our mildness will not be worried by their importunity.'\r\n\r\n[See Dahn ('Könige der Germanen' iii. 143), who decides that the\r\n'Tertiae' was the pecuniary equivalent paid by the Roman possessor for\r\nthat portion of the _Sors Barbarica_ (the Gothic third of the lands\r\nof Italy) which, for convenience sake, was left in the actual\r\noccupation of Romans.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING THEODORIC TO FESTUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Looking after the interests of the absent.]\r\n\r\n'We are glad to see that our good opinion of you is shared by your\r\nneighbours, and that the Patrician Agnellus, going to Africa on our\r\nbusiness, has chosen you to defend his interests in his absence. No\r\none can give a higher proof of confidence than this. Look well after\r\nthe trust committed to you. There seems to be a peculiar temptation to\r\nneglect the interests of the absent.'\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING THEODORIC TO JULIANUS, COMES PATRIMONII [probably 508].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remission of taxes. Hostile incursions.]\r\n\r\n'It is an excellent investment to do a generous thing to our subjects.\r\nThe Apulian \"Conductores\" [farmers of the Royal domain] have\r\nrepresented to us with tears that their crops have been burned by\r\nhostile invaders [Byzantines?]. We therefore authorise you to deduct\r\nat the next Indiction what shall seem the right proportion for these\r\nlosses from the amount due to us[227]. See, however, that our revenue\r\nsustains no unnecessary loss. We are touched by the losses of the\r\nsuppliants, but we ought on the other hand to share their profits.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: 'Ut quantum eos minus vendidisse constiterit, de\r\nreliquis primae indictionis habita moderatione detrahatis.']\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE GOTHIC AND ROMAN INHABITANTS OF DERTONA\r\n(TORTONA).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fortification of camp near Dertona.]\r\n\r\n'We have decided that the camp near you shall at once be fortified. It\r\nis expedient to execute works of this kind in peace rather than in\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n'The true meaning of _expeditio_ shows that the leader of a military\r\nexpedition should have an unencumbered mind.\r\n\r\n'Do you therefore second our efforts by building good private houses,\r\nin which you will be sheltered, while the enemy (whenever he comes)\r\nwill be in the worst possible quarters[228], and exposed to all the\r\nseverity of the weather.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: 'Durissimae mansiones.']\r\n\r\n\r\n18. KING THEODORIC TO DOMITIANUS AND WILIAS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Statute of Limitations.]\r\n\r\n'It is right that you, who are administering justice to the nations,\r\nshould learn and practise it yourselves. We therefore hasten to reply\r\nto the question which you have asked [concerning the length of time\r\nthat is required to bestow a title by prescription]. If any Barbarian\r\nusurper have taken possession of a Roman farm since the time when we,\r\nthrough God's grace, crossed the streams of the Isonzo, when first the\r\nEmpire of Italy received us[229], and if he have no documents of title\r\n[sine delegatoris cujusquam pyctacio] to show that he is the rightful\r\nholder, then let him without delay restore the property to its former\r\nowner. But if he shall be found to have entered upon the property\r\nbefore the aforesaid time, since the principle of the thirty years'\r\nprescription comes in, we order that the petition of the plaintiff\r\nshall be dropped.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: 'Ex quo, Deo propitio, Sonti fluenta transmisimus ubi\r\nprimum Italiae nos suscepit imperium.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crimes of violence.]\r\n\r\n'The assailant, as well as the murderer, of his brother, is to be\r\ndriven forth from the kingdom, that the serenity of our Commonwealth\r\nmay not be troubled with any such dark spots.'\r\n\r\n[Theodoric crossed the Isonzo, August, 489, and as I understand this\r\nletter, it was written somewhere about 518, and he therefore lays down\r\na convenient practical rule: 'No dispossession which occurred before\r\nI crossed the Isonzo shall be enquired into; any which have happened\r\nsince, may.' But the letter is a very difficult one, and I am bound to\r\nsay that Dahn's interpretation ('Könige der Germanen' iii. 11, 12)\r\ndoes not agree with mine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. KING THEODORIC TO SATURNINUS AND VERBUSIUS, VIRI SUBLIMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rights of the Fiscus.]\r\n\r\n'The _Fiscus_ is to have its rights, but we do not wish to oppress our\r\npeople. Let moderation be observed in all things.\r\n\r\n'When you receive the petition of the Curiales of Adriana, if anyone\r\nwho is able to pay, stubbornly and impudently refuses to contribute to\r\nthe _Fiscus Gothorum_, you are to compel him to do so. But let off the\r\nreally poor man who is unable to contribute.'\r\n\r\n\r\n20. KING THEODORIC TO ALBINUS AND ALBIENUS, VIRI ILLUSTRES AND\r\nPATRICIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circus quarrels. Patronage of the Greens. Rivalry between\r\nHelladius and Theodorus.]\r\n\r\n'Notwithstanding our greater cares for the Republic, we are willing to\r\nprovide also for the amusement of our subjects. For it is the\r\nstrongest possible proof of the success of our labours that the\r\nmultitude knows itself to be again at leisure[230].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: 'Illud enim, propitiante Deo, labores nostros asserit\r\nquod se _otiosam_ generalitas esse cognoscit.']\r\n\r\n'The petition of the Green party in the circus informs us that they\r\nare oppressed, and that the factions of the circus are fatal to public\r\ntranquillity. We therefore order you to assume the patronage of the\r\nGreen party, which our father of glorious memory paid for[231]. So\r\nlet the spectators be assembled, and let them choose between Helladius\r\nand Theodorus which is fittest to be Pantomimist of the Greens, whose\r\nsalary we will pay.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: 'Quapropter illustris magnitudo vestra praesenti\r\njussione commonita, patrocinium partis Prasini, quod gloriosae\r\nrecordationis pater noster impendit, dignanter assumat.' This passage\r\nprobably alludes to Theodoric's adoption by Zeno. But one reading is\r\n'pater _vester_.']\r\n\r\nThen follows a digression on pantomimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. KING THEODORIC TO MAXIMIAN, VIR ILLUSTRIS; AND ANDREAS, VIR\r\nSPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embellishment of Rome.]\r\n\r\n'If the people of Rome will beautify their City we will help them.\r\n\r\n'Institute a strict audit (of which no one need be ashamed) of the\r\nmoney given by us to the different workmen for the beautification of\r\nthe City. See that we are receiving money's worth for the money spent.\r\nIf there is embezzlement anywhere, cause the funds so embezzled to be\r\ndisgorged. We expect the Romans to help from their own resources in\r\nthis patriotic work, and certainly not to intercept our contributions\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n'The wandering birds love their own nests; the beasts haste to their\r\nown lodgings in the brake; the voluptuous fish, roaming the fields of\r\nocean, returns to its own well-known cavern. How much more should Rome\r\nbe loved by her children!'\r\n\r\n\r\n22. KING THEODORIC TO MARCELLUS, VIR SPECTABILIS, ADVOCATUS FISCI.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotion of Marcellus.]\r\n\r\nAfter some rather vapid praise of the eloquence and good qualities of\r\nMarcellus, Theodoric promotes him from the rank of a Private Advocate\r\nto that of an _Advocatus Fisci_, and gives him some excellent counsels\r\nabout not pressing the claims of the Crown too far. 'We shall not\r\nenquire how many causes you have gained, but how you have gained them.\r\nLet there sometimes be a bad cause for the Fiscus, that the Sovereign\r\nmay be seen to be good.'\r\n\r\n\r\n23. KING THEODORIC TO COELIANUS AND AGAPITUS, VIRI ILLUSTRES AND\r\nPATRICIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Litigation between Senators.]\r\n\r\n'The concord and harmony of subjects redound to the praise of their\r\nprince.\r\n\r\n'We desire that Festus and Symmachus (Patricians and Magnifici) should\r\nprosecute the causes for action which they say they have against\r\nPaulinus (Illustris and Patrician) in your Court. Let Paulinus bring\r\nbefore you any counter-claim which he may assert himself to possess.\r\nLet justice be rendered speedily. Show yourselves worthy of this high\r\ntrust. It is a matter of great moment to end lawsuits between men of\r\nsuch eminence in the State as these.'\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE GOTHS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A call to arms for the invasion of Gaul.]\r\n\r\n'To the Goths a hint of war rather than persuasion to the strife is\r\nneeded, since a warlike race such as ours delights to prove its\r\ncourage. In truth, he shuns no labour who hungers for the renown of\r\nvalour. Therefore with the help of God, whose blessing alone brings\r\nprosperity, we design to send our army to the Gauls for the common\r\nbenefit of all, that you may have an opportunity of promotion, and we\r\nthe power of testing your merits; for in time of peace the courage\r\nwhich we admire lies hidden, and when men have no chance of showing\r\nwhat is in them, their relative merits are concealed. We have\r\ntherefore given our Sajo[232], Nandius, instructions to warn you that,\r\non the eighth day before the kalends of next July, you move forward to\r\nthe campaign in the name of God, sufficiently equipped, according to\r\nyour old custom, with horses, arms, and every requisite for war. Thus\r\nwill ye at the same time show that the old valour of your sires yet\r\ndwells in your hearts, and also successfully perform your King's\r\ncommand. Bring forth your young men for the discipline of Mars. Let\r\nthem see you do deeds which they may love to tell of to their\r\nchildren. For an art not learned in youth is an art missing in our\r\nriper years. The very hawk, whose food is plunder, thrusts her still\r\nweak and tender young ones out of the nest, that they may not become\r\naccustomed to soft repose. She strikes the lingerers with her wings;\r\nshe forces her callow young to fly, that they may prove to be such in\r\nthe future as her maternal fondness can be proud of. Do you therefore,\r\nlofty by nature, and stimulated yet more by the love of fame, study to\r\nleave such sons behind you as your fathers have left in leaving you.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: See for the office of the Sajo, note on ii. 13.]\r\n\r\n[We can hardly be wrong in referring this stirring proclamation to the\r\nyear 508, when Theodoric sent troops into Gaul to save the remnants of\r\nthe Visigothic Monarchy from the grasp of Clovis. The first sentence\r\nrecalls the expression 'certaminis gaudia,' which Jordanes no doubt\r\nborrowed from Cassiodorus. For the simile at the end of the letter,\r\ncf. Deuteronomy xxxii. 11, 'As an eagle stirreth up her nest'.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. KING THEODORIC TO SABINIANUS, VIR SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repair of the walls of Rome.]\r\n\r\n'It is important to preserve as well as to create. We are earnestly\r\nanxious to keep the walls of Rome in good repair, and have therefore\r\nordered the Lucrine port[233] to furnish 25,000 tiles annually for\r\nthis purpose. See that this is done, that the cavities which have been\r\nformed by the fall of stones may be roofed over with tiles, and so\r\npreserved, and that thus we may deserve the thanks of ancient kings,\r\nto whose works we have given immortal youth.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: I presume that 'portum Lucini' is an error for the\r\nLucrine harbour; but there is an allusion which I do not understand in\r\nthe following passage: 'Simul etiam portubus junctis, qui ad illa loca\r\nantiquitus pertinebant, et nunc diversorum usurpatione suggeruntur\r\ninvasi?']\r\n\r\n\r\n26. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAEPOSITUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity of Church property from taxation.]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Cassiodorus the Patrician (a man of tried integrity and\r\npure fidelity[234]), a grant of freedom from taxation[235] was made to\r\nthe Church of Vercelli. Since that time other property has been\r\nconveyed to the same Church, apparently by a soldier. An attempt is\r\nmade to represent this after-acquired property as also tax-free. 'No,'\r\nsays the King. 'It would be very wrong in us to recall our gift; but\r\nit is equally wrong in you to try to stretch it to something which it\r\nnever included. Private persons must not make grants to the injury of\r\nour treasury. Tribute belongs to the purple, not to the military\r\ncloak[236]. Your newly acquired possessions must pay taxes along with\r\nthose of other owners.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: This is evidently the writer's father.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: 'Onera indictorum titulorum.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: 'Tributa sunt purpurae, non lacernae.']\r\n\r\n\r\n27. KING THEODORIC TO SPECIOSUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circus quarrels.]\r\n\r\n'If we are moderating under our laws the character of foreign nations,\r\nif the Roman law is supreme over all that is in alliance with Italy,\r\nhow much more doth it become the Senate of the seat of civilisation\r\nitself to have a surpassing reverence for law, that by the example of\r\ntheir moderation the beauty of their dignities may shine forth more\r\neminently. For where shall we look for moderation, if violence stains\r\nPatricians? The Green party complain that they have been truculently\r\nassaulted by the Patrician Theodoric and the \"Illustris and Consul\r\nImportunus,\" and that one life has been lost in the fray. We wish the\r\nmatter to be at once brought before the Illustres Coelianus and\r\nAgapitus and examined into by them[237].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: See i. 23, from which it appears that these two men had\r\nspecial jurisdiction in cases affecting Patricians.]\r\n\r\n'As to their counter-complaints of rudeness against the mob, you must\r\ndistinguish between deliberate insolence and the licence of the\r\ntheatre. Who expects seriousness of character at the spectacles? It is\r\nnot exactly a congregation of Catos that comes together at the circus.\r\nThe place excuses some excesses. And besides, it is the _beaten_ party\r\nwhich vents its rage in insulting cries. Do not let the Patricians\r\ncomplain of clamour that is really the result of a victory for their\r\nown side, which they greatly desired.'\r\n\r\n[The mention of 'the Patrician Theodoric' is a difficulty, as we know\r\nof no namesake of the King among the Roman nobility. Perhaps we ought\r\nto read (with the Remensian MS.) 'Theodoro,' as we know from 'Anon.\r\nValesii' 68 that there was a Theodorus, son of Basilius, who perhaps\r\nsucceeded Liberius, Praef. Praetorio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE GOTHS AND ROMANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The walls of Rome.]\r\n\r\n'Most worthy of Royal attention is the rebuilding of ancient cities,\r\nan adornment in time of peace, a precaution for time of war.\r\n\r\n'Therefore, if anyone have in his fields stones suitable for the\r\nbuilding of the walls, let him cheerfully and promptly produce them.\r\nEven though he should be paid at a low rate, he will have his reward\r\nas a member of the community, which will benefit thereby.'\r\n\r\n\r\n29. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE LUCRISTANI (LUSTRIANI?) ON THE RIVER\r\nSONTIUS (ISONZO).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Postal Service.]\r\n\r\n'The post (_Cursus Publicus_) is evidently an institution of great\r\npublic utility, tending to the rapid promulgation of our decrees.\r\n\r\n'Care must therefore be taken that the horses are not allowed to get\r\nout of condition, lest they break down under their work, and lest the\r\njourney, which should be rapid, become tediously slow.\r\n\r\n'Also any lands formerly appropriated to the _mutationes_ [places for\r\nchanging horses] which have fallen into private hands must be\r\nreclaimed for the public service, the owners being sufficiently\r\nindemnified for their loss.'\r\n\r\n\r\n30. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the injury to public peace arising from the Circus\r\nrivalries.]\r\n\r\nThe Senators are exhorted not to allow their menials to embroil\r\nthemselves with the populace, and thus bring their good name into\r\ndisgrace. Any slave accused of the murder of a free-born citizen is to\r\nbe at once given up, under penalty of a fine of 10 lbs. of gold\r\n(£400), and the King's severe displeasure for the master who disobeys\r\nthis command.\r\n\r\n'And do not you, oh Senators, be too severe in marking every idle word\r\nwhich the mob may utter amidst the general rejoicing. If there is any\r\ninsult which requires notice, bring it before the \"Praefectus\r\nUrbis\"--a far better and safer course than taking the law into your\r\nown hands.'\r\n\r\n[This letter, a very interesting and sensible one, is somewhat spoilt\r\nby a characteristic Cassiodorian sentence at the end:--\r\n\r\n'Men in old time used always to fight with their fists, whence the\r\nword _pugna_, \"a pugnis.\" Afterwards iron was introduced by King\r\nBelus, and hence came _bellum_, \"a Belo.\"']\r\n\r\n\r\n31. KING THEODORIC TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nGives similar good advice to that contained in the previous letter to\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n'The Circus, in which the King spends so much money, is meant to be\r\nfor public delight, not for stirring up wrath. Instead of uttering\r\nhowls and insults like other nations [the populace of Byzantium?],\r\nwhom they have despised for doing so, let them tune their voices, so\r\nthat their applause shall sound like the notes of some vast organ,\r\nand even the brute creation delight to hear it.\r\n\r\n'Anyone uttering outrageous reproaches against any Senator will be\r\ndealt with by the Praefectus Urbis.'\r\n\r\n\r\n32. KING THEODORIC TO AGAPITUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, PRAEFECTUS URBIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\n'The ruler of the city ought to keep the peace, and justify my choice\r\nof him. Your highest praise is a quiet people.\r\n\r\n'We have issued our \"oracles\" to the \"amplissimus ordo\" (Senate) and\r\nto the people, that the custom of insulting persons in the Circus is\r\nto be put under some restraint; on the other hand, any Senator who\r\nshall be provoked to kill a free-born person shall pay a fine. The\r\ngames are meant to make people happy, not to stir them up to deadly\r\nrage. Helladius[238] is to come forth into the midst and afford the\r\npeople pleasure [as a pantomimist], and he is to receive his monthly\r\nallowance (menstruum) with the other actors of the Green Faction. His\r\npartisans are to be allowed to sit where they please.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: See Letter i. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Was there not some division in the Green Faction itself concerning\r\nthe merits of Helladius and his rival Theodorus?]\r\n\r\n\r\n33. KING THEODORIC TO AGAPITUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, PRAEFECTUS URBIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrangements for the Pantomime.]\r\n\r\n'Our Serenity is not going to change the arrangements which we have\r\nonce made for the public good. We told Albinus and Albienus[239] to\r\nchoose the most fitting person they could find as Pantomimist of the\r\nGreens. They have done so [choosing probably Helladius]. He shall have\r\nhis monthly allowance, and let there be peace.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n\r\n34. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAEPOSITUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Only the surplus of corn to be exported.]\r\n\r\n'It should be only the surplus of the crops of any Province, beyond\r\nwhat is needed for the supply of its own wants, that should be\r\nexported. Station persons in the harbours to see that foreign ships do\r\nnot take away produce to foreign shores until the Public\r\nProviders[240] have got all that they require.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: 'Expensae publicae' perhaps = curatores annonae.]\r\n\r\n\r\n35. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAEPOSITUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unreasonable delays. The sucking-fish and torpedo.]\r\n\r\n'This extraordinarily dry season having ruined the hopes of our\r\nharvest, it is more than ever necessary that the produce should be\r\nbrought forward promptly. We are therefore exceedingly annoyed at\r\nfinding that the crops which are generally sent forward by your\r\nChancellor from the coasts of Calabria and Apulia in summer have not\r\nyet arrived, though it is near autumn and the time is at hand when the\r\nsun, entering the southern signs (which are all named from showers),\r\nwill send us storm and tempest.\r\n\r\n'What are you waiting for? Why are your ships not spreading their\r\nsails to the breeze? With a favourable wind and with bending oarsmen,\r\nare you perhaps delayed by the _echeneis_ (Remora, or sucking-fish)?\r\nor by the shell-fish of the Indian Ocean? or by the torpedo, whose\r\ntouch paralyses the hand? No; the echeneis in this case is entangling\r\nvenality; the bites of the shell-fish, insatiable avarice; the\r\ntorpedo, fraudulent pretence.\r\n\r\n'The merchants are making delays in order that they may seem to have\r\nfallen on adverse weather.\r\n\r\n'Let your Magnitude put all this to rights promptly, otherwise our\r\nfamine will be imputed, not to bad seasons, but to negligence[241].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: For a fuller translation of this marvellous letter, see\r\nIntrod. p. 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\n36. KING THEODORIC TO THERIOLUS, VIR SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guardianship of children of Benedictus.]\r\n\r\n'We wish you to take the place of the late Benedictus in the city of\r\nPedon.\r\n\r\n'As we never forget the services of the dead, we wish you to undertake\r\nofficially the guardianship of the sons of the said Benedictus.\r\n\r\n'We always pay back to our faithful servants more than we have\r\nreceived from them, and thus we do not go on the principle \"equality\r\nis equity,\" because we think it just to make them _more_ than an equal\r\nrecompence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n37. KING THEODORIC TO CRISPIANUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justifiable homicide.]\r\n\r\n'Murder is abominable, but it is right to take into account the\r\ncircumstances which may have provoked to homicide. If the slain man\r\nwas trying to violate the rights of wedlock, his blood be on his own\r\nhead. For even brute beasts vindicate their conjugal rights by force:\r\nhow much more man, who is so deeply dishonoured by the adulterer!\r\n\r\n'Therefore, if it be true that the man whom you slew had wronged you\r\nas a husband, we do not agree to the punishment of exile which has\r\nbeen inflicted upon you. Nor will we uphold the action of the\r\n_Vicarius_ or of his _Officium_, who, as you say, have impounded the\r\nmoney paid by your _fidei-jussor_ (guarantor) Agnellus. Also, we will\r\nprotect you against the hostile assaults of Candax [next of kin to the\r\nmurdered man?] in future. But your allegation as to the provocation\r\nmust be fully established by legal process.'\r\n\r\n[It may be remarked that Candac, King of the Alani in Moesia, is\r\nmentioned in the pedigree of Jordanes ('Getica,' cap. 4).]\r\n\r\n\r\n38. KING THEODORIC TO BAION, A SENATOR[242].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: See remarks on this letter in Dahn, Könige der Germanen\r\niv. 147-8. Some MSS. read Coion or Goinon, as the name of the Senator\r\nto whom it is addressed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The young Hilarius to be allowed to enter on possession of\r\nhis property.]\r\n\r\n'We are told that you are keeping in your own hands the administration\r\nof the property of your young nephew [or grandson] Hilarius against\r\nhis will, and not for his good, but yours. Restore it at once. Let him\r\ndispose of it as he likes. He seems to be quite able to enter upon the\r\nlordship of his own. The eagle feeds her callow young with food which\r\nshe has procured for them, till their wings grow. Then, when their\r\nflight is strong and their nails sharp, she trains them to strike\r\ntheir own prey. So with our young Goths: when they are fit for\r\nsoldiership we cannot bear that they should be deemed incapable of\r\nmanaging their own concerns. \"To the Goths valour makes full age. And\r\nhe who is strong enough to stab his enemy to the heart should be\r\nallowed to vindicate himself from every accusation of incapacity.\"'\r\n\r\n[Notwithstanding his Roman name, Hilarius is evidently a Goth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. KING THEODORIC TO FESTUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nephews of Filagrius to be detained in Rome.]\r\n\r\n'We are always delighted to grant just requests.\r\n\r\n'Filagrius (Vir Spectabilis), who has been long absent from his home\r\non our business, seeks to return to Syracuse, but at the same time\r\nasks that his brother's sons may be kept for their education's sake at\r\nRome. Do you attend to this petition, and do not let the lads go till\r\nwe send you a second order to that effect. No one ought to murmur at\r\nbeing detained in Rome, which is everyone's country, the fruitful\r\nmother of eloquence, the wide temple of all virtues. Ulysses would\r\nvery likely never have become famous if he had lingered on at home;\r\nbut Homer's noble poem most chiefly proclaims his wisdom in this fact,\r\nthat he roamed among many cities and nations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n40. KING THEODORIC TO ASSUIN (OR ASSIUS), VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inhabitants of Salona to be drilled.]\r\n\r\n'War needs rehearsal and preparation. Therefore let your Illustrious\r\nSublimity provide the inhabitants of Salona with arms, and let them\r\npractise themselves in the use of them; for the surest safeguard of\r\nthe Republic is an armed defender.'\r\n\r\nThe necessity of drill and practice is shown by the early combats of\r\nbullocks, the play-huntings of puppies, the necessity of first\r\nkindling a fire with very little sticks, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n41. KING THEODORIC TO AGAPITUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, PRAEFECTUS URBIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enquiries into character of the younger Faustus.]\r\n\r\n'The dignity of the Senate makes it necessary to be unusually careful\r\nwho is admitted into that body. Let other orders receive middling men:\r\nthe Senate must receive none but those who are of proved excellence.\r\n\r\n'Therefore let your Illustrious Magnificence cause those enquiries to\r\nbe made concerning Faustus, the grown-up son of the Illustrious\r\nFaustus, which the Senate hath ordered to be made concerning all\r\npersons who are to be enrolled in its council[243]. In thus confirming\r\nand ratifying the proceedings of the Senate we are in no degree\r\ntrenching on the accustomed authority of that sacred order.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: 'Quae circa referendos curiae priscus ordo\r\ndesignavit.']\r\n\r\n\r\n42. KING THEODORIC TO ARTEMIDORUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN [509 OR\r\n524].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artemidorus to be Praefect of the City.]\r\n\r\n'We are especially bound to reward merit. Everyone who does us a\r\nservice makes a very good investment. You have long had what was\r\nformerly considered more precious than great dignity--near access to\r\nour person. Much as we loved you, we somewhat retarded your advance in\r\norder that you might be the more richly adorned with all virtues when\r\nyou came to honour. Your birthplace, your lineage, your merit, all\r\ndeclare you worthy of the promotion which we now bestow upon you,\r\ndeclaring you for this third Indiction[244] _Praefectus Urbis_. You\r\nwill thus have the function of presiding over the Senate, a far higher\r\noffice than that of ruling the Palace or arranging private houses. The\r\nvalue of the object committed to a person's care increases the dignity\r\nof the post. It is much more honourable to be caretaker of a diadem\r\nthan of a wine-cellar. Judge of our esteem for you by the preciousness\r\nof the body over which we are thus calling you to preside.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: Either 509-510 or 524-525; more probably the former.]\r\n\r\n\r\n43. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotion of Artemidorus.]\r\n\r\n[Announcing the elevation of Artemidorus to the post of Praefectus\r\nUrbis.]\r\n\r\n'Artemidorus, though entitled from his relationship to the Emperor\r\nZeno to expect great promotion at the Court of Constantinople, has\r\npreferred to share the fortunes and attach himself to the person of\r\nTheodoric, who has often been refreshed after the cares of State by an\r\nhour of his charming converse. Though he might have aspired to the\r\nhighest dignities of the Court, he has hitherto been satisfied with\r\nthe comparatively humble post of Superintendent of the Public\r\nSpectacles [as Tribunus Voluptatum?]. Now, as Praefectus Urbis, he is\r\nto preside over and become a member of your body. Welcome him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n44. KING THEODORIC TO THE PEOPLE OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\n[On the same subject as 42 and 43, the elevation of Artemidorus to the\r\nUrban Praefecture.]\r\n\r\nRebukes the commonalty sharply for their recent disturbances, which\r\ndefile with illicit seditions the blessings of peace, earned under\r\nGod's blessing by their Prince. The newly-appointed Praefectus\r\nUrbanus, Artemidorus, long devoted to the service of Theodoric, will\r\nattest the innocence of the good, and sharply punish the errors of the\r\nbad, both by his own inherent prerogative and by a special commission\r\nentrusted to him for that purpose by the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n45. KING THEODORIC TO BOETIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The water-clock and sundial destined for the Burgundian\r\nKing.]\r\n\r\n'It is important to oblige our royal neighbours even in trifles, for\r\nnone can tell what great matters may be aided thereby. Often what arms\r\ncannot obtain the offices of kindness bring to pass. Thus let even our\r\nunbending be for the benefit of the Republic. For our object in\r\nseeking pleasure is that we may thereby discharge the serious duties\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n'The Lord of the Burgundians has earnestly requested that we would\r\nsend him a clock which is regulated by water flowing under a modulus,\r\nand one which is marked by embracing the illumination of the immense\r\nsun[245].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: An unintelligible translation doubtless, but is the\r\noriginal clearer? 'Burgundionum dominus a nobis magnopere postulavit\r\nut horologium quod aquis sub modulo fluentibus temperatur et quod\r\nsolis immensi comprehensa illuminatione distinguitur ... ei\r\ntransmittere deberemus.' It is pretty clear that the first request of\r\nthe Burgundian King was for a clepsydra of some kind. The second must\r\nbe for some kind of sundial, but the description is very obscure.]\r\n\r\n[I transcribe, and do not attempt to translate, the further\r\ndescription of the two machines, the order of which is now changed.]\r\n\r\n'_Primum_ sit, ubi stylus diei index, per umbram exiguam horas\r\nconsuevit ostendere. Radius itaque immobilis, et parvus, peragens quod\r\ntam miranda magnitudo solis discurrit, et fugam solis aequiparat quod\r\nmodum semper ignorat. [This must be the sundial.] Inviderent talibus,\r\nsi astra sentirent: et meatum suum fortasse deflecterent, ne tali\r\nludibrio subjacerent. Ubi est illud horarum de lumine venientium\r\nsingulare miraculum, si has et umbra demonstrat? Ubi praedicabilis\r\nindefecta roratio, si hoc et metalla peragunt, quae situ perpetuo\r\ncontinentur? O artis inaestimabilis virtus quae dum se dicit ludere,\r\nnaturae praevalet secreta vulgare.\r\n\r\n'_Secundum_ sit [the clepsydra] ubi praeter solis radios hora\r\ndignoscitur, noctes in partes dividens: quod ut nihil deberet astris,\r\nrationem coeli ad aquarum potius fluenta convertit, quorum motibus\r\nostendit, quod coelum volvitur; et audaci praesumptione concepta, ars\r\nelementis confert quod originis conditio denegavit.'\r\n\r\n'It will be a great gain to us that the Burgundians should daily look\r\nupon something sent by us which will appear to them little short of\r\nmiraculous. Exert yourself therefore, oh Boetius, to get this thing\r\nput in hand. You have thoroughly imbued yourself with Greek\r\nphilosophy[246]. You have translated Pythagoras the musician, Ptolemy\r\nthe astronomer, Nicomachus the arithmetician, Euclid the geometer,\r\nPlato the theologian, Aristotle the logician, and have given back the\r\nmechanician Archimedes to his own Sicilian countrymen (who now speak\r\nLatin). You know the whole science of Mathematics, and the marvels\r\nwrought thereby. A machine [perhaps something like a modern orrery]\r\nhas been made to exhibit the courses of the planets and the causes of\r\neclipses. What a wonderful art is Mechanics! The mechanician, if we\r\nmay say so, is almost Nature's comrade, opening her secrets, changing\r\nher manifestations, sporting with miracles, feigning so beautifully,\r\nthat what we know to be an illusion is accepted by us as truth.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: Evidently 'sic enim Atheniensium scholas longe positus\r\nintroisti' does not mean that Boethius actually visited Athens, but\r\nthat he became thoroughly at home in the works of Athenian\r\nphilosophers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n46. KING THEODORIC TO GUNDIBAD [SIC], KING OF THE BURGUNDIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nSends the two clocks, or rather perhaps the celestial globe and the\r\nwater-clock.\r\n\r\n'Have therefore in your country what you have often seen in Rome. It\r\nis right that we should send you presents, because you are connected\r\nwith us by affinity. It is said that under you \"Burgundia\" looks into\r\nthe most subtle things, and praises the discoveries of the ancients.\r\nThrough you she lays aside her \"Gentile\" (barbarous) nature, and\r\nimitating the prudence of her King, rightly desires to possess the\r\ninventions of sages. Let her arrange her daily actions by the\r\nmovements of God's great lights; let her nicely adjust the moments of\r\neach hour. In mere confusion passes the order of life when this\r\naccurate division of time is unknown. Men are like the beasts, if they\r\nonly know the passage of the hours by the pangs of hunger, and have no\r\ngreater certainty as to the flight of time than such as is afforded\r\nthem by their bellies. For certainty is undoubtedly meant to be\r\nentwined in human actions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING FORTY-ONE LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS IN THE NAME OF\r\nTHEODORIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. KING THEODORIC TO ANASTASIUS, MOST PIOUS EMPEROR. A.D. 511.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consulship of Felix.]\r\n\r\n'By excellent ordinance of the ancients the year is named from the\r\nConsul. Let the happy year take its title from our new Consul, _Felix_\r\n[Consul with Secundinus, A.D. 511[247]].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: 'Portamque dierum tali nomine dicatus annus, tempos\r\nintroeat.' The figure here used seems borrowed from Claudian, In\r\nPrimum Cons. Stilichonis ii. 425-476.]\r\n\r\n'It is most suitable that Rome should gather back her children to her\r\nbosom, and in her venerable Senate should enrol a son of Gaul.\r\n\r\n'Felix showed his excellent disposition first in this, that while\r\nstill a young man he hastened to \"the native land of all the virtues\"\r\n[Rome]. Success followed his choice; we promoted him as he deserved.\r\nWhile still a young man, deprived of his father's care, he showed the\r\nrare gift of continence; he subdued avarice, the enemy of wisdom; he\r\ndespised the blandishments of vice; he trampled under foot the\r\nvanities of pride.\r\n\r\n'We have now determined to reward him with the Consulship. Do you who\r\ncan with indiscriminate pleasure rejoice in both the blessings of the\r\nRepublic [in the Consuls of the East and West] join your favouring\r\nvote. He who is worthy of so high an office as the Consulship may\r\nwell be chosen by the judgment of both' [Emperor and King].\r\n\r\n[An important letter, as showing the extent to which concurrent choice\r\nof Consuls was vested in Rome, or rather Ravenna, and Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. KING THEODORIC TO FELIX, VIR ILLUSTRIS, CONSUL ORDINARIUS, A.D. 511\r\n(4TH OF THE INDICTION).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nAn address on his elevation to the Consulship, touching on nearly the\r\nsame topics as the preceding.\r\n\r\nTheodoric delights in bestowing larger favours on those whom he has\r\nonce honoured [a favourite topic with Cassiodorus].\r\n\r\nFelix has come back from Gaul to the old fatherland[248]. Thus the\r\nConsulship has returned to a Transalpine family, and green laurels are\r\nseen on a brown stock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: 'Cum soli genitalis fortunâ relictâ, velut quodam\r\npostliminio in antiquam patriam commeasses.']\r\n\r\nFelix has shown an early maturity of character. He has made a wise use\r\nof his father's wealth. The honour which other men often acquire by\r\nprodigality he has acquired by saving. Cassiodorus evidently has a\r\nlittle fear that the new Consul may carry his parsimony too far, and\r\ntells him that this office of the Consulship is one in which\r\nliberality, almost extravagance, earns praise[249]; in which it is a\r\nkind of virtue not to love one's own possessions; and in which one\r\ngains in good opinion all that one loses in wealth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: 'Ubi praeconium meretur effusio.']\r\n\r\n'See the sacred City all white with your _vota_ (?). See yourself\r\nborne upon the shoulders of all, and your name flitting through their\r\nmouths, and manifest yourself such that you may be deemed worthy of\r\nyour race, worthy of the City, worthy of our choice, worthy of the\r\nConsular _trabea_.'\r\n\r\n[The letter makes one suspect a certain narrowness and coldness of\r\nheart in the subject of its praise.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE. A.D. 511.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nRecommends Felix for the Consulship, going over again the topics\r\nmentioned in the two last letters. It appears that it was the father\r\nof Felix who emerged, after a temporary eclipse of the family\r\nfortunes, and then showed himself 'the Cato of our times, abstaining\r\nfrom vice himself, and forming the characters of others; imbued also\r\nwith all Greek philosophy, he glutted himself with the honey of the\r\nCecropian doctrine.'\r\n\r\nMention is made of the Consulship of an earlier Felix, A.D. 428, the\r\nhappy renown of which still lingered in the memories of men.\r\n\r\nThe young Felix is praised for the qualities described in the two\r\nprevious letters, and also for his power of conciliating the\r\nfriendship of older men, especially the excellent Patrician Paulinus.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KING THEODORIC TO ECDICIUS (OR BENEDICTUS), VIR HONESTUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Collection of Siliquaticum.]\r\n\r\n'We wish always to observe long-established rules in fiscal matters,\r\nthe best guarantee against extortion. Therefore, whatever dues in the\r\nway of _Siliquaticum_ appertained to Antiochus are now transferred to\r\nyou by the present authority, and the Sajo is charged to support your\r\nclaims herein; only the contention must not be mixed up with any\r\nprivate matters of your own.'\r\n\r\n[The _Siliquaticum_ was a tax of one twenty-fourth--the _siliqua_\r\nbeing the twenty-fourth of a _solidus_--payable on all sales in market\r\novert by buyer and seller together.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAEPOSITUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soldiers' arrears.]\r\n\r\n'We are always generous, and sometimes out of clemency we bestow our\r\ngifts on persons who have no claim upon us. How much more fitting is\r\nit then that the servants of the State should receive our gifts\r\npromptly! Wherefore, pray let your Magnificence see to it that the\r\nsixty soldiers who are keeping guard in the fastnesses of Aosta\r\nreceive their _annonae_ without delay. Think what a life of hardship\r\nthe soldier leads in those frontier forts for the general peace, thus,\r\nas at the gate of the Province, shutting out the entry of the\r\nbarbarous nations. He must be ever on the alert who seeks to keep out\r\nthe Barbarians. For fear alone checks these men, whom honour will not\r\nkeep back.'\r\n\r\n[A singular letter to write in the name of one who was himself a\r\nBarbarian invader.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING THEODORIC TO AGAPITUS, ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embassy to Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n'We have decided to send you on an embassy to the East\r\n(Constantinople). Every embassy requires a prudent man, but here there\r\nis need of especial prudence, because you will have to dispute against\r\nthe most subtle persons--artificers of words, who think they can\r\nforesee every possible answer to their arguments. Do your best\r\ntherefore to justify the opinion which I formed of you before full\r\ntrial of your powers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n7. KING THEODORIC TO SURA (OR SUNA), ILLUSTRIS AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embellishment of the City.]\r\n\r\n'Let nothing lie useless which may redound to the beauty of the City.\r\nLet your Illustrious Magnificence therefore cause the blocks of marble\r\nwhich are everywhere lying about in ruins to be wrought up into the\r\nwalls by the hands of the workmen whom I send herewith. Only take care\r\nto use only those stones which have really fallen from public\r\nbuildings, as we do not wish to appropriate private property, even for\r\nthe glorification of the City.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KING THEODORIC TO BISHOP SEVERUS, VIR VENERABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compensation for damage done by troops on march.]\r\n\r\n'None is more suitable than a member of the Priesthood to perform acts\r\nof justice towards his flock.\r\n\r\n'We therefore send your Holiness, by Montanarius, 1,500 solidi (£900),\r\nfor distribution among the Provincials, according to the amount of\r\ndamage which each one has sustained this year by the passage of our\r\narmy. See that the distribution is made systematically--not at\r\nrandom--so that it may reach the right persons.'\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAEPOSITUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Allowance to a retired charioteer.]\r\n\r\n'We always enjoy being generous. Compassion is the one virtue to which\r\nall other virtues may honourably give way. Long ago we made the\r\ncharioteer Sabinus a monthly allowance of a solidus [twelve\r\nshillings]. Now, as we learn from Histrius [or Historius] that this\r\nformer servant of the public pleasures is afflicted with the most\r\nmelancholy poverty, we have pleasure in adding _another_ solidus to\r\nhis monthly allowance. We are never so well pleased as when the\r\naccounts of our expenditure show these items of charitable\r\ndisbursement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n10. KING THEODORIC TO SPECIOSUS, VIR DEVOTUS, COMITIACUS [OFFICER OF\r\nTHE COURT].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The abduction of Agapita.]\r\n\r\n'The laws guarding the sanctity of the marriage bed[250] must be\r\ncarefully upheld.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: 'Illud Humani generis procreabile Sacramentum.']\r\n\r\n'Agapita[251] has explained to us that she was tempted away from her\r\nhusband by seducers, who promised to procure his death. From the time\r\nof her leaving his company let all revenues which came to her under\r\nthe marriage contract (invalidated by her unfaithfulness) be given up\r\nby her wrongful detainers[252] without any delay. It is too absurd\r\nthat men who ought to be severely punished for their wrong-doing\r\nshould even seek to make a profit out of it.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: 'Foemina spectabilis.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: 'Retentatores.' So the Gepid Prince is called the\r\nRetentator of Sirmium (Ennodius, Panegyric. Theod. 178. Ed. Migne).]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. KING THEODORIC TO PROVINUS (PROBINUS?), ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gift obtained from Agapita under undue influence.]\r\n\r\n[Refers to the same business of Agapita, who seems to have been a\r\nwoman of feeble intellect as well as an unfaithful wife.] The petition\r\nof her husband Basilius (vir Spectabilis) sets forth that, influenced\r\nby seducers, and from the levity so natural to woman, she for no good\r\nreason quitted her own home. Her own petition confirms this; and she\r\nstates that, while taking refuge within the precincts of the Church,\r\nshe by deed of gift bestowed on Provinus the 'Casa Areciretina,' a\r\nmost preposterous gift from a poor woman to a rich man; from one whose\r\nreputation was gone to a chaste man; from a half-crazy creature to one\r\nwho knew fully what he was about. This gift Agapita [and Basilius] now\r\nseek to annul. Provinus is exhorted at once to throw up a possession\r\nwhich cannot possibly bring him any credit, and the loss of which has\r\nbrought the poor woman to destitution. Alienation of property should\r\nbe the act of a person having 'solidum judicium,' which this poor\r\ncreature evidently had not, or she would not have left her husband\r\ncauselessly.\r\n\r\n'This is the second time of writing. Let there be no further delay in\r\ncomplying.'\r\n\r\n[Probably, therefore, Probinus really is one of the 'Retentatores'\r\nreferred to in Letter 10, though this letter does not distinctly\r\nidentify him with them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. KING THEODORIC TO THE COUNT OF THE SILIQUATARII (CUSTOMS\r\nOFFICERS), AND TO HIM WHO HAS THE CARE OF THE HARBOUR (OF PORTUS?).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prohibition of export of lard.]\r\n\r\n'Italy ought to enjoy her own products, and it is monstrous that\r\nanything which she produces should be wanting to her own children.\r\n\r\n'Therefore let no lard be exported to foreign parts, but let it by\r\nGod's grace be all kept for consumption at home.\r\n\r\n'Now take care not to incur the slightest blame in this matter. It is\r\na very serious fault even in trifles to disobey orders. Sin consists\r\nin quality, not in quantity; and injustice cannot be measured. A\r\ncommand, if it be despised in one part, is violated in the whole.'\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING THEODORIC TO THE SAJO[253] FRUINARITH.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: The Sajo was an officer, not of very high rank,\r\napparently always of Gothic nationality, who was charged with\r\nexecuting the King's mandates. Perhaps our word 'henchman' would be\r\nthe best translation of his title. His conventional attribute was\r\n'devotio.' See Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 181-186, and my 'Italy\r\nand her Invaders' iii. 282-284.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dishonest conduct of Venantius.]\r\n\r\n'We are always especially touched by the prayers of petitioners who\r\ncomplain that they are forced to pay unjustly. Ulpianus in his\r\nlamentable petition informs us that on the request of Venantius he\r\nbound himself as a guarantor (fidei jussionis vinculo) to pay over to\r\nthe public Treasury at the time of his administration 400 solidi\r\n(£240). With the presumption of a truculent rustic Venantius despised\r\nhis own promise, and Ulpianus has therefore been burdened with payment\r\nof the money. We therefore order that Venantius, who has been accused\r\nof many other crimes besides this, shall be summoned before you, and\r\nif found to be legally liable, shall be at once, and sharply,\r\ncompelled to fulfil his promise.'\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING THEODORIC TO SYMMACHUS, PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Romulus the parricide.]\r\n\r\n'Parricide is the most terrible and unnatural of crimes. Even the cubs\r\nof wild beasts follow their sires; the offshoot of the vine serves the\r\nparent stem: shall man war against him who gave him being? It is for\r\nour little ones that we lay up wealth. Shall we not earn the love of\r\nthose for whom we would willingly incur death itself? The young stork,\r\nthat harbinger of spring, gives a signal example of filial piety,\r\nwarming and feeding its aged parents in the moulting season till they\r\nhave recovered their strength, and thus repaying the good offices\r\nreceived in its earlier years. So too, when the partridge, which is\r\nwont to hatch the young of other birds, takes her adopted brood forth\r\ninto the fields, if these hear the cry of their genuine mother they\r\nrun to her, leaving the partridge forsaken.\r\n\r\n'Wherefore, if Romulus[254] have fouled the Roman name by laying\r\nviolent hands on his father Martinus, we look to your justice (we\r\nchose you because we knew you would not spare the cruel) to inflict on\r\nhim legitimate revenge.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: Quaere if named from the last Emperor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING THEODORIC TO VENANTIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotion of Venantius to Comitiva Domesticorum Vacans.]\r\n\r\n'We always like to promote to office the sons of distinguished\r\nfathers. We therefore bestow on you the honour of Comes Domesticorum\r\n(Comitiva Vacans), in memory of your glorious father. He held at the\r\nsame time the Praefecture [of Italy] and the command of the army, so\r\nthat neither the Provinces lacked his ordering, nor did his wise care\r\nfor the army fail. All was mastered by his skilled and indefatigable\r\nprudence; he inclined the manners of the Barbarians to peace, and\r\ngoverned so that all were satisfied with our rule.\r\n\r\n'You are a zealous student of literature, illustrious by birth and\r\neloquent by education. Go on as you have begun, and show yourself\r\nworthy of our choice.'\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nThis letter adds a little to the information contained in the\r\npreceding one, as to the career of Liberius, father of Venantius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of Liberius.]\r\n\r\nLiberius was a faithful servant of Odovacar, who adhered to his master\r\nto the last. 'He awaited incorruptly the Divine judgments, nor did he\r\nallow himself to seek a new King till he had first lost his old one.\r\nOn the overthrow of his lord he was bowed by no terror; he bore\r\nunmoved the ruin of his Prince; nor did the revolution, at which even\r\nthe proud hearts of the Barbarians trembled[255], avail to move him\r\nfrom his calm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: 'Quam etiam ferocitas gentilis expavit.']\r\n\r\n'Prudently did he follow the common fortunes, in order that while\r\nfixedly bearing the Divine judgments he might with the more\r\napprobation find the Divine favour. We approved the faith of the man;\r\nhe came over in sadness to our allegiance as one who being overcome\r\nchanges his mind, not like one who has contrived [treacherously] that\r\nhe should be conquered. We made him Praefectus Praetorio. He\r\nadministered the finances admirably. By his economical management we\r\nfelt the increased returns, while you knew nothing of added tributes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apportionment of Tertiae.]\r\n\r\n'We especially like to remember how in the assignment of the [Gothic]\r\nThirds (in Tertiarum deputatione) he joined both the possessions and\r\nthe hearts of Goths and Romans alike. For whereas men are wont to come\r\ninto collision on account of their being neighbours, with these men\r\nthe common holding of their farms proved in practice a reason for\r\nconcord. Thus it has happened that while the two nations have been\r\nliving in common they have concurred in the same desires. Lo! a new\r\nfact, and one wholly laudable. The friendship of the lords has been\r\njoined with the division of the soil; amity has grown out of the loss\r\nof the Provincials, and by the land a defender has been gained whose\r\noccupation of part guarantees the quiet enjoyment of the whole. One\r\nlaw includes them: one equal administration rules them: for it is\r\nnecessary that sweet affection should grow between those who always\r\nkeep the boundaries which have been allotted them.\r\n\r\n'All this the Roman Republic owes to Liberius, who to two such\r\nillustrious nations has imparted sentiments of mutual affection. See\r\nto it, Conscript Fathers, that his offspring does not go unrewarded.'\r\n\r\n\r\n17. TO THE POSSESSORS, DEFENSORS, AND CURIALS[256] OF THE CITY OF\r\nTRIDENTUM (TRIENT).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: Cf. iii. 9 for a similar heading.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity from Tertiae enjoyed by lands granted by the\r\nKing.]\r\n\r\n'We do not wish to be generous at the expense of others, and we\r\ntherefore declare that the _Sors_ which in our generosity we have\r\nbestowed on Butilianus the Presbyter, is not to be reckoned in to the\r\ntax calculations; but as many solidi as are comprehended in that gift,\r\nso many are you to be relieved from, in the contribution of\r\n\"Tertiae.\"'\r\n\r\n[That is to say, the land given by the Gothic King to Butilian was to\r\nbe itself, as a matter of course, free from Tertiae; but, in order\r\nthat this might not throw a heavier burden on the other owners in the\r\ndistrict, they were to be allowed to deduct the solidi of that portion\r\nfrom the gross amount payable by them on behalf of the whole district.\r\nButilian's own immunity from Tertiae seems to be taken for granted as\r\na result of the King's gift to him. (See Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen'\r\niii. 145.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. KING THEODORIC TO BISHOP GUDILA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ecclesiastics as Curiales.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting but rather obscure letter on the condition of\r\n_Curiales_.\r\n\r\nApparently some ecclesiastics were claiming as slaves some men whom\r\nthe Curia of Sarsena (?) asserted to be fellow-curials of their own,\r\nwhom they therefore wanted to assist them in performing curial\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus argues that as the 'Sors nascendi' prevented the Curialis\r\nfrom rising to the higher honours of the State, it certainly ought\r\nalso to prevent him from sinking into slavery[257]. 'Therefore we\r\nadvise you to look well to your facts, and see whether these men are\r\nnot justly claimed as Curials, in which case the Church should give\r\nthem up before the matter comes to trial. It does not look well for\r\nthe Bishop, who should be known as a lover of justice, to be publicly\r\nvanquished in a suit of this kind.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: 'Quod si eos vel ad honores transire jura vetuerunt,\r\nquam videtur esse contrarium, Curialem Reipublicae, amissâ turpiter\r\nlibertate, servire? et usque ad conditionem pervenisse postremam quem\r\nvocavit antiquitas _Minorem Senatum_.']\r\n\r\n[Did the alleged Curials, in such a case, wish to have their curiality\r\nor their quasi-ecclesiastical character established? Who can say?]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE GOTHS AND ROMANS, AND THOSE WHO KEEP THE\r\nHARBOURS AND MOUNTAIN-FORTRESSES (CLUSURAS).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Domestic treachery and murder.]\r\n\r\n'We hate all crime, but domestic bloodshed and treachery most of all.\r\nTherefore we command you to act with the utmost severity of the law\r\nagainst the servants of Stephanus, who have killed their master and\r\nleft him unburied. They might have learned pity even from birds. Even\r\nthe vulture, who lives on the corpses of other creatures, protects\r\nlittle birds from the attacks of the hawk. Yet men are found cruel\r\nenough to slay him who has fed them. To the gallows with them! Let\r\n_him_ become the food of the pious vulture, who has cruelly contrived\r\nthe death of his provider. That is the fitting sepulchre for the man\r\nwho has left his lord unburied.'\r\n\r\n\r\n20. KING THEODORIC TO THE SAJO UNIGILIS (OR WILIGIS).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provision-ships to follow movements of Theodoric's Court.]\r\n\r\n'Let any provision-ships [_sulcatoriæ?_] which may be now lying at\r\nRavenna be ordered round to Liguria (which in ordinary times supplies\r\nthe needs of Ravenna herself).\r\n\r\n'Our presence and that of our Court (Comitatus) attracts many\r\nspectators and petitioners to those parts, for whose maintenance an\r\nextra effort must be made.' [See Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii.\r\n282.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. KING THEODORIC TO JOANNES THE APPARITOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A concession too timidly acted upon.]\r\n\r\n'The King has conceded to the Spectabiles Spes and Domitius a certain\r\ntract of land which was laid waste by wide and muddy streams, and\r\nwhich neither showed a pure expanse of water nor had preserved the\r\ncomeliness of solid earth, for them to reclaim and cultivate.\r\n\r\n'The petition of the _Actores_ of Spes sets forth that the operation\r\nis put in jeopardy by the ill-timed parsimony of Domitius, which\r\nthrows back the labourers to the point from which they set out at\r\nfirst[258]. Therefore let Domitius be stirred up to finish his part of\r\nthe work, or if he thinks that too expensive, let him throw up his\r\nshare of the concession and allow his partner to work it out.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: 'Cum jam in soli faciem paulatim mollities siccata\r\nduresceret, celatamque longâ voracitate tellurem sol insuetus\r\nafflaret.' I cannot understand these words. I suppose there was a hard\r\ncake of clay left when the water was drained off, which was baked by\r\nthe sun, and that there should have been further digging to work\r\nthrough this stratum and get at the good soil beneath; but the wording\r\nis not very clear.]\r\n\r\n[We find in this letter a good motto for Theodoric's reign: 'Nos\r\nquibus cordi est in melius cuncta mutare.']\r\n\r\n\r\n22. KING THEODORIC TO FESTUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ecdicius to be buried by his sons.]\r\n\r\n'The sons of Ecdicius, whom at first we had ordered to reside in the\r\ncity, are to be allowed to return to their own country in order to\r\nbury their father. That grief is insatiable which feels that it has\r\nbeen debarred from rendering the last offices to the dead. Think at\r\nwhat risk of his life Priam implored the raging Achilles to give him\r\nback the body of his son.'\r\n\r\n[Apparently the sons of Ecdicius, not Ecdicius himself, had fallen\r\ninto disgrace with Theodoric, or incurred some suspicion of\r\ndisloyalty, which led to the rigorous order for their detention in\r\nRome. See Dahn iii. 279-280.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. KING THEODORIC TO AMPELIUS, DESPOTIUS, AND THEODULUS, SENATORS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protection for owners of potteries.]\r\n\r\n'It befits the discipline of our time that those who are serving the\r\npublic interests shall not be loaded with superfluous burdens. Labour\r\ntherefore diligently at the potteries (figulinae) which our Royal\r\nauthority has conceded to you. Protection is hereby promised against\r\nthe wiles of wicked men.' [What was the nature of the artifices to\r\nwhich they were exposed is not very clear.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrears of taxation due from Senators.]\r\n\r\n'We hear with sorrow, by the report of the Provincial Judges, that you\r\nthe Fathers of the State, who ought to set an example to your sons\r\n(the ordinary citizens), have been so remiss in the payment of taxes\r\nthat on this first collection[259] nothing, or next to nothing, has\r\nbeen brought in from any Senatorial house. Thus a crushing weight has\r\nfallen on the lower orders (_tenues_, _curiales_), who have had to\r\nmake good your deficiencies and have been distraught by the violence\r\nof the tax-gatherers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: 'Primae transmissionis tempus.']\r\n\r\n'Now then, oh Conscript Fathers, who owe as much duty to the Republic\r\nas we do, pay the taxes for which each one of you is liable, to the\r\nProcurators appointed in each Province, by three instalments (trinâ\r\nillatione). Or, if you prefer to do so--and it used to be accounted a\r\nprivilege--pay all at once into the chest of the Vicarius. And let\r\nthis following edict be published, that all the Provincials may know\r\nthat they are not to be imposed upon and that they are invited to\r\nstate their grievances[260].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: See Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 153 and 112, n.\r\n5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. AN EDICT OF KING THEODORIC.\r\n\r\n[Referred to in the preceding letter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evasion of taxes by the rich.]\r\n\r\nThe King detests the oppression of the unfortunate, and encourages\r\nthem to make their complaints to him. He has heard that the powerful\r\nhouses are failing to pay their share of the taxes, and that a larger\r\nsum in consequence is being exacted from the _tenues_[261].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: Here follows a sentence which I am unable to translate:\r\n'Superbia deinde conductorum canonicos solidos non ordine traditos,\r\nsed sub iniquo pondere imminentibus fuisse projectos nec universam\r\nsiliquam quam reddere consueverant solemniter intulisse.' I think the\r\nmeaning is, that the stewards of the Senators (conductores) arrogantly\r\nrefused to allow the money paid to the tax-collectors (canonici\r\nsolidi) to be tested, as in ordinary course it should have been, to\r\nsee if it was of full weight. The 'imminentes' are, I think, the\r\ntax-collectors. I cannot at all understand the clause about 'universam\r\nsiliquam.']\r\n\r\nTo 'amputate' such wickedness for the future, the letter last\r\npreceding has been addressed to the Senate; and the 'Possessores sive\r\ncuriales' are now invited to state their grievances fully and\r\nfrankly, or else ever after hold their peace and cultivate a habit of\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regulations for corn-traffic of Southern Italy.]\r\n\r\nA difficult letter about the corn-merchants of Apulia and Calabria.\r\n\r\n1. The corn which they have collected by public sale is not to be\r\ndemanded over again from them under the title of 'interpretium'\r\n[difference of price].\r\n\r\n2. Similarly as to the Sextarius which the merchant of each Province\r\nimports. No one is to dare insolently to exact the prices which have\r\nbeen always condemned.\r\n\r\n3. Fines of £1,200 on the Praefect himself, and £400 on his _officium_\r\n(subordinates), are to be levied if this order is disobeyed.\r\n\r\n4. If the 'Siliquatarius' thinks right to withhold the monopoly (of\r\ncorn) from any merchant, he must not also exact the monopoly payment\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n5. As to the Aurarii [persons liable to payment of the _lustralis auri\r\ncollatio_[262]], let the old order be observed, and those only be\r\nclassed under this function whom the authority of antiquity chose to\r\nserve thereunder.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: This appears to have been a tax levied on all traders,\r\notherwise known as the Chrysargyron. See Cod. Theod. xiii. 1. Aurarii\r\nis therefore equivalent to Licensed Traders.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE JEWS LIVING IN GENOA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rebuilding of Jewish Synagogue.]\r\n\r\nThe Jews are permitted to roof in the old walls of their synagogue,\r\nbut they are not to enlarge it beyond its old borders, nor to add any\r\nkind of ornament, under pain of the King's sharp displeasure; and this\r\nleave is granted on the understanding that it does not conflict with\r\nthe thirty years' 'Statute of Limitations.'\r\n\r\n'Why do ye desire what ye ought to shun? In truth we give the\r\npermission which you craved, but we suitably blame the desire of your\r\nwandering minds. _We cannot order a religion, because no one is forced\r\nto believe against his will._'\r\n\r\n\r\n28. KING THEODORIC TO STEPHANUS, 'SENATOR, COMES PRIMI ORDINIS, AND\r\nEX-PRINCEPS OF OUR OFFICIUM[263].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: Are we to understand by this expression the Officium of\r\nthe Praetorian Praefect?]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honours conferred on Stephanus on his retirement from the\r\nCivil Service.]\r\n\r\nPraises him for all the good qualities which have been recognised by\r\nsuccessive Judges under whom he has served--his secrecy, efficiency,\r\nand incorruptibility.\r\n\r\nHe is therefore, on his retirement from active service, raised to the\r\nhonour of a 'Spectabilis,' and rewarded with the rank of 'Comitiva\r\nPrimi Ordinis.' As a substantial recompence he is to have all the\r\nprivileges which by 'divalia constituta' belong to the 'ex-principes'\r\nof his Schola, and is guaranteed against all damage and 'sordid\r\nburdens[264],' with a hope of further employment in other\r\ncapacities[265].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: Curial obligations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: 'Fixum tenuisti _militiae probatae_ vestigium.\r\nSpectabilitatis honorem, quem _militiae sudore_ detersis justa\r\ndeputavit antiquitas praesenti tibi auctoritate conferimus ut laboris\r\ntui tandem finitas _excubias_ ... intelligas ... Tibique utpote\r\n_militiae_ munere persoluto.' The term 'militia' is employed here, as\r\nin the Codes, of 'service in a bureau.']\r\n\r\n\r\n29. KING THEODORIC TO ADILA, SENATOR AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protection to dependents of the Church.]\r\n\r\n[Notice the Senatorial rank borne by a man with a Gothic name.]\r\n\r\n'We wish to protect all our subjects[266], but especially the Church,\r\nbecause by so doing we earn the favour of Heaven. Therefore, in\r\naccordance with the petition of the blessed Eustorgius[267], Bishop of\r\nMilan, we desire you to accord all necessary protection to the men\r\nand farms belonging to the Milanese Church in Sicily: always\r\nunderstanding, however, that they are not to refuse to plead in answer\r\nto any public or private suit that may be brought against them. They\r\nare to be protected from wrong, but are not themselves to deviate from\r\nthe path of justice.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: 'Quia Regnantes est gloria, subjectorum otiosa\r\ntranquillitas.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: For Eustorgius, cf. Letter i. 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n30. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sequel to last letter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freedom from taxation granted to Church of Milan.]\r\n\r\n'Our generosity to an individual does not harm the public, and there\r\nis no reason for putting any bounds to its exercise.\r\n\r\n'The Defensores of the Holy Church of Milan want to be enabled to buy\r\nas cheap as possible the things which they need for the relief of the\r\npoor; and they say that we have bestowed this favour on the Church of\r\nRavenna.\r\n\r\n'Your Magnificence will therefore allow them to single out some one\r\nmerchant who shall buy for them in the market, without being subject\r\nto monopoly, siliquaticum, or the payment of gold-fee[268].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: Auraria pensio. See note on ii. 26.]\r\n\r\n[It is easy to see how liable to abuse such an exception was. Who was\r\nto decide when this merchant was buying for the Church and when for\r\nhimself; when the Church was buying for the poor and when for her own\r\nenrichment?]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. KING THEODORIC TO THE DROMONARII [ROWERS IN EXPRESS-BOATS].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State Galleys on the Po.]\r\n\r\n'Those who claim the title of \"militia\" ought to serve the public\r\nadvantage. We have therefore told the Count of Sacred Largesses that\r\nyou are to assemble at Hostilia [on the Padus, about fifteen miles\r\neast of Mantua], there to receive pay from our Treasury, and then to\r\nrelieve the land postal-service (veredarii) by excursions up and down\r\nthe channel of the Padus. There is no fear of _your_ limping; you walk\r\nwith your hands. No fear of _your_ carriages wearing out; they travel\r\nover liquid roads, and suffer no wear and tear because they are borne\r\nalong upon the wave which itself runs with them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n32. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drainage of marshes of Decennonium.]\r\n\r\n'We always enjoy rewarding public spirit. Decius, Magnificus and\r\nPatrician, has most nobly volunteered to drain the marsh of\r\nDecennonium, where the sea-like swamp, accustomed to impunity through\r\nlong licence, rushes in and spoils all the surrounding lands.\r\n\r\n'We, in consideration of so great an undertaking, determine to secure\r\nto him the fruits of his labour, and we therefore wish that you,\r\nConscript Fathers, should appoint a commission of two to visit the\r\nspot and mark out the ground, which is at present wasted by the\r\ninundations, that this land may be secured to Decius as a permanent\r\npossession when he has drained it.'\r\n\r\n[The Palus Decennonii is undoubtedly connected with the Decennovial\r\nCanal mentioned by Procopius ('De Bello Gotth.' i. 11), and so called\r\nbecause it flowed for nineteen miles alongside the Appian Way. In the\r\nPiazza at Terracina there is a very interesting inscription, recording\r\nthe fact that Theodoric had ordered that nineteen miles of the Appian\r\nWay should be cleared of the waters which had accumulated round it,\r\nand had committed the work to Caecina Maurus Basilius Decius, 'Vir\r\nClarissimus et Illustris, Ex-Praefectus Urbi, Ex-Praefectus Praetori,\r\nEx-Consul Ordinarius et Patricius.' See 'Italy and her Invaders' iii.\r\n348.]\r\n\r\n\r\n33. KING THEODORIC TO DECIUS, ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\nThe complement of the foregoing letter, about the drainage of the\r\nmarshes of Decennonium, which are hereby granted to him, apparently\r\n'sine fisco,' tax-free.\r\n\r\n[But the meaning may be, 'the marshes which you drain _sine\r\nfisco_'--without help from the Treasury.]\r\n\r\nThe chief point of difference between this and the previous letter is\r\nthat here Decius is allowed and encouraged to associate partners with\r\nhim in the drainage-scheme, whom he is to reward according to their\r\nshare of the work. Thus will he be less likely to sink under the\r\nenterprise, and he will also lessen men's envy of his success.\r\n\r\n\r\n34. KING THEODORIC TO ARTEMIDORUS, PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embezzlement of City building funds.]\r\n\r\n'The persons to whom money was entrusted for the rebuilding of the\r\nwalls of Rome have been embezzling it, as was proved by your\r\nexamination of their accounts (discussio). We are very glad that you\r\nhave not hidden their misconduct from us (inclined as a generous mind\r\nis to cover up offences), since you would thereby have made yourself\r\npartaker of their evil deeds. They must restore that which they have\r\ndishonestly appropriated, but we shall not (as we might fairly do)\r\ninflict upon them any further fine. We are naturally inclined to\r\nclemency, and they will groan at having to give up plunder which they\r\nhad already calculated upon as their own.'\r\n\r\n\r\n35. KING THEODORIC TO TANCILA, SENATOR.\r\n\r\n[We have here another Senator with a Gothic name].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theft of brazen statue at Como.]\r\n\r\n'We are much displeased at hearing that a brazen statue has been\r\nstolen from the City of Como. It is vexatious that while we are\r\nlabouring to increase the ornaments of our cities, those which\r\nAntiquity has bequeathed to us should by such deeds be diminished.\r\nOffer a reward of 100 aurei (£60) to anyone who will reveal the author\r\nof this crime; promise pardon [to an accomplice], and if this does not\r\nsuffice, call all the workmen together \"post diem venerabilem\" [Does\r\nthis mean on the day after Sunday?], and enquire of them \"sub terrore\"\r\n[by torture?] by whose help this has been done. For such a piece of\r\nwork as moving this statue could only have been undertaken by some\r\nhandicraftsman.'\r\n\r\n\r\n36. EDICT ABOUT THE STATUE AT COMO.\r\n\r\n[Refers to previous letter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'Though impunity for the crime should be sufficient reward, we promise\r\n100 aurei, as well as forgiveness for his share in the offence, to\r\nanyone who will reveal the author of the theft of the statue at Como.\r\nA golden reward for a brazen theft. Anyone not accepting this offer\r\nand afterwards convicted will suffer the extreme penalty of the law.'\r\n\r\n\r\n37. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Largesse to citizens of Spoleto.]\r\n\r\n'As our Kingdom and revenues prosper, we wish to increase our\r\nliberality. Let your Magnificence therefore give to the citizens of\r\nSpoletium another \"millena\" for extraordinary gratuitous admissions to\r\nthe baths[269]. We wish to pay freely for anything that tends to the\r\nhealth of our citizens, because the praise of our times is the\r\ncelebration of the joys of the people.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: 'Ad exhibitionem thermarum supra consuetudinem.']\r\n\r\n[The 'millena' probably means 1,000 solidi, or £600.]\r\n\r\n\r\n38. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity from taxation. Hostile ravages.]\r\n\r\n'We have no pleasure in gains which are acquired by the misery of our\r\nsubjects. We are informed that the merchants of the city of Sipontum\r\n[in Apulia] have been grievously despoiled by hostile incursions\r\n[probably by the Byzantine fleet in 508]. Let your Magnificence\r\ntherefore see to it that they are for two years not vexed by any\r\nclaims for purveyance (coemptio) on the part of our Treasury. But\r\ntheir other creditors must give them the same indulgence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n39. KING THEODORIC TO ALOISIUS THE ARCHITECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hot springs of Aponum.]\r\n\r\n'The fountain of Aponus--so called originally in the Greek language as\r\nbeing the remover of pain[270]--has many marvellous and beneficial\r\nproperties, for the sake of which the buildings round it ought to be\r\nkept in good repair. One may see it welling up from the bowels of the\r\nearth in spherical form, under a canopy of steam. From this parent\r\nspring the waters, glassy-clear and having lost their first\r\nimpetuosity, flow by various channels into chambers prepared for them\r\nby nature but made longer by art. In the first, when the boiling\r\nelement dashes against the rock, it is hot enough to make a natural\r\nsudatorium; then it cools sufficiently for the tepidarium; and at\r\nlast, quite cold, flows out into a fish-pond like that of Nero.\r\nMarvellous provision of Nature, whereby the opposing elements, fire\r\nand water, are joined in harmonious union and made to soothe the pain\r\nand remove the sickness of man! Yet more wonderful is the moral purity\r\nof this fountain. Should a woman descend into the bath when men are\r\nusing it, it suddenly grows hotter, as if with indignation that out of\r\nits abundant supply of waters separate bathing-places should not be\r\nconstructed for the two sexes, if they wish to enjoy its bounty[271].\r\nMoreover, those secret caves, the bowels of the mountains from whence\r\nit springs, have power even to judge contentious business. For if any\r\nsheep-stealer presumes to bring to it the fleece of his prey, however\r\noften he may dip it in the seething wave, he will have to boil it\r\nbefore he succeeds in cleansing it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: [Greek: aponos].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: I think this is Cassiodorus' meaning, but his language\r\nis obscure.]\r\n\r\n'This fountain then, as we before said, deserves a worthy habitation.\r\nIf there be anything to repair in the _thermae_ themselves or in the\r\npassages (cuniculi), let this be done out of the money which we now\r\nsend you. Let the thorns and briers which have grown up around it be\r\nrooted up. Let the palace, shaken with extreme old age, be\r\nstrengthened by careful restoration. Let the space which intervenes\r\nbetween the public building and the source of the hot-spring be\r\ncleared of its woodland roughness, and the turf around rejoice in the\r\ngreen beauty which it derives from the heated waters.'\r\n\r\n[The hot-springs of Abano, the ancient Aponum, are situated near the\r\nEuganean Hills, and are about six miles from Padua. The heat of the\r\nwater varies from 77° to 185° (Fahr.). The chief chemical ingredients\r\nare, as stated by Cassiodorus, salt and sulphur. Some of the minute\r\ndescription of Cassiodorus (greatly condensed in the above abstract)\r\nseems to be still applicable; but he does not mention the mud-baths\r\nwhich now take a prominent place in the cure. On the other hand, the\r\nwonderful moral qualities of the spring are not mentioned by modern\r\ntravellers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n40. KING THEODORIC TO BOETIUS THE PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boetius to choose a harper for the King of the Franks.]\r\n\r\n'The King of the Franks [Clovis] has asked us to send him a harper. We\r\nfelt that in you lay our best chance of complying with his request,\r\nbecause you, being such a lover of music yourself, will be able to\r\nintroduce us to the right man.'\r\n\r\nReflections on the nature of music. She is the Queen of the senses;\r\nwhen she comes forth from her secret abiding place all other thoughts\r\nare cast out. Her curative influence on the soul.\r\n\r\nThe five tones: the Dorian[272], influencing to modesty and purity;\r\nthe Phrygian to fierce combat; the Aeolian to tranquillity and\r\nslumber; the Ionian (Jastius), which sharpens the intellect of the\r\ndull and kindles the desire of heavenly things; the Lydian, which\r\nsoothes the soul oppressed with too many cares.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: Cf. Milton:\r\n\r\n                       'To the Dorian mood\r\n    Of flutes and soft recorders; such as rais'd\r\n    To highth of noblest temper heroes old\r\n    Arming to battle, and instead of rage\r\n    Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd\r\n    With dread of death to flight or foul retreat.']\r\n\r\nWe distinguish the highest, middle, and lowest in each tone, obtaining\r\nthus in all fifteen tones of artificial music.\r\n\r\nThe diapason is collected from all, and unites all their virtues.\r\n\r\nClassical instances of music:\r\n\r\n     Orpheus.\r\n     Amphion.\r\n     Musaeus.\r\n\r\nThe human voice as an instrument of music. Oratory and Poesy as\r\nbranches of the art.\r\n\r\nThe power of song: Ulysses and the Sirens.\r\n\r\nDavid the author of the Psalter, who by his melody three (?) times\r\ndrove away the evil spirit from Saul.\r\n\r\nThe lyre is called 'chorda,' because it so easily moves the hearts\r\n(corda) of men.\r\n\r\nAs the diadem dazzles by the variegated lustre of its gems, so the\r\nlyre with its divers sounds.\r\n\r\nThe lyre, the loom of the Muses.\r\n\r\nMercury, the inventor of the lyre, is said to have derived the idea of\r\nit from the harmony of the spheres. This astral music, apprehended by\r\nreason alone, is said to form one of the delights of heaven. 'If\r\nphilosophers had placed that enjoyment not in sweet sounds but in the\r\ncontemplation of the Creator, they would have spoken fitly; for there\r\nis truly joy without end, eternity abiding for ever without weariness,\r\nand the mere contemplation of the Divinity produces such happiness\r\nthat nothing can surpass it. This Being furnishes the true\r\nimmortality; this heaps delight upon delight; and as outside of Him no\r\ncreature can exist, so without Him changeless happiness cannot\r\nbe[273].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: 'Bene quidem arbitrati, si causam celestis beatitudinis\r\nnon in sonis sed in Creatore possuissent; ubi veraciter sine fine\r\ngaudium est, sine aliquo taedio manens semper aeternitas: et inspectio\r\nsola Divinitatis efficit, ut beatius esse nil possit. Haec veraciter\r\nperennitatem praestat: haec jucunditates accumulat; et sicut praeter\r\nipsam creatura non extat, ita sine ipsâ incommutabilem laetitiam\r\nhabere non praevalet.']\r\n\r\n'We have indulged ourselves in a pleasant digression, because it is\r\nalways agreeable to talk of learning with the learned; but be sure to\r\nget us that _Citharoedus_, who will go forth like another Orpheus to\r\ncharm the beast-like hearts of the Barbarians. You will thus both obey\r\nus and render yourself famous.'\r\n\r\n\r\n41. KING THEODORIC TO LUDUIN [CLOVIS], KING OF THE FRANKS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victories of Clovis over the Alamanni.]\r\n\r\nCongratulates him on his recent victories over the Alamanni. Refers to\r\nthe ties of affinity between them (Theodoric having married the sister\r\nof Clovis). Clovis has stirred up the nation of the Franks, 'prisca\r\naetate residem,' to new and successful encounters. 'It is a memorable\r\ntriumph that the impetuous Alaman should be struck with such terror as\r\neven to beg for his life. Let it suffice that that King with all the\r\npride of his race should have fallen: let it suffice that an\r\ninnumerable people should have been doomed either to the sword or to\r\nslavery.'\r\n\r\nHe recommends (almost orders) Clovis not to touch the panic-stricken\r\nrefugees who have fled to the territory of Theodoric. Theodoric\r\nhimself has always found that those wars were prosperously waged which\r\nwere ended moderately.\r\n\r\nTheodoric sends 'illum et illum' as ambassadors, to take certain\r\nverbal counsels from himself, to bring this letter and carry back the\r\nreply, and also to introduce the Citharoedus of whom we heard in the\r\npreceding letter[274].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: There are two allusions to the relationship between the\r\nKings: 'vestrae virtutis affinitate' (line 1), and 'ad parentum\r\nvestrorum defensionem confugisse' (line 10).]\r\n\r\n[The campaign of Clovis against the Alamanni, referred to in this\r\nletter, is not mentioned by Gregory of Tours. Ennodius, however, in\r\nhis Panegyric on Theodoric, and Agathias in his History, make distinct\r\nallusions to this event, and to Theodoric's reception of the\r\nvanquished Alamanni in his own dominions, probably in the valleys of\r\nRaetia.\r\n\r\nThis letter is very fully discussed by Von Schubert, at pp. 32-43 of\r\nhis 'Unterwerfung der Alamannen' (Strassburg, 1884). I may also refer\r\nto 'Italy and her Invaders' iii. 390-91.\r\n\r\nThe date of the letter is probably about 504.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING FIFTY-THREE LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS IN THE NAME OF\r\nTHEODORIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KING THEODORIC TO ALARIC, KING OF THE VISIGOTHS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissuades Alaric the Visigoth from war with the Franks.]\r\n\r\n'Surrounded as you are by an innumerable multitude of subjects, and\r\nstrong in the remembrance of their having turned back Attila[275],\r\nstill do not fight with Clovis. War is a terrible thing, and a\r\nterrible risk. The long peace may have softened the hearts of your\r\npeople, and your soldiers from want of practice may have lost the\r\nhabit of working together on the battlefield. Ere yet blood is shed,\r\ndraw back if possible. We are sending ambassadors to the King of the\r\nFranks to try to prevent this war between our relatives; and the\r\nambassadors whom we are sending to you will go on to Gundibad, King of\r\nthe Burgundians, to get him to interpose on behalf of peace. Your\r\nenemy will be mine also.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: 'Quamvis Attilam potentem reminiscamini Visigothorum\r\nviribus inclinatum.']\r\n\r\n[The battle of Vouglé in which Alaric was overthrown by Clovis, was\r\nfought in 507; but the date of this letter is probably 506 (Dahn's\r\ndate) rather than 507, as there were no doubt some premonitory\r\nsymptoms before the war broke out.\r\n\r\nBinding i. 181 (_n._ 608), and Pallmann ii. 55 _n._ 1, and 135 _n._ 2,\r\nincline to a date somewhat earlier even than 506, thinking that there\r\nmay have been earlier threatenings of war, which Theodoric succeeded\r\nfor the time in averting.\r\n\r\nThe earlier the date the better will it suit the allusion to Clovis\r\n(and Alaric) as 'Regii _Juvenes_' in the following letter. Clovis was\r\nborn in 466, and was therefore 41 years of age at the battle of\r\nVouglé.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. KING THEODORIC TO GUNDIBAD, KING OF THE BURGUNDIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissuades Gundibad from war.]\r\n\r\nRepeats the arguments in iii. 1 about the ill effects of war on the\r\nfortunes of all, and says that it is Theodoric's part to moderate the\r\nangry impulses of 'regii juvenes.' It becomes them to reverence\r\n'senes,' such as Theodoric and Gundibad, although they are themselves\r\nin the balmy vigour of the flower of their age.\r\n\r\nSends two ambassadors ('illum atque illum') with letters and a verbal\r\nmessage, hoping that the wisdom of Gundibad may reflect upon what they\r\nsay to him [perhaps too delicate a matter to be committed to writing],\r\nand find some way of preserving peace.\r\n\r\n[It is remarkable that in this letter Theodoric, who was probably only\r\n52, if the date of it be 506, and who may have been a year or two\r\nyounger, speaks of himself along with Gundibad as a _senex_, and of\r\nClovis, who could hardly be more than twelve years his junior, as\r\n_regius juvenis_. Perhaps this is partly due to the fact that\r\nCassiodorus speaks from his own point of view. To him, now about 26\r\nyears of age, Theodoric might seem to be fitly described as 'senex.'\r\n\r\nSee Binding i. 181-183 on this letter and the reasons why it produced\r\nno effect on Gundibad. See also Dahn ii. 144.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. KING THEODORIC TO THE KINGS OF THE HERULI, WARNI (GUARNI), AND\r\nTHURINGIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempt to form a Teutonic coalition on behalf of Alaric.]\r\n\r\n[On the same subject.] If Clovis succeeds in his unprovoked aggression\r\non Alaric, none of his neighbours will be safe. 'I will tell you just\r\nwhat I think: he who inclines to act without law is prepared to shake\r\nthe kingdoms of all of us[276].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Compare the state of Europe during the wars of the\r\nFrench Revolution, as expressed by Tennyson:\r\n\r\n    'Again their ravening eagle rose,\r\n    In anger, wheel'd on Europe-shadowing wings,\r\n    And barking for the thrones of kings.']\r\n\r\n'Remember how often Alaric's father Euric gave you presents and staved\r\noff war from your borders. Repay to the son the kindness of the\r\nfather. I send you two ambassadors, and I want you to join your\r\nrepresentations to mine and Gundibad's, calling on Clovis to desist\r\nfrom his attacks on Alaric and seek redress from the law of\r\nnations[277], or else expect the combined attack of all of us, for\r\nthis quarrel is really the quarrel of us all.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: 'Et leges gentium quaerat.' But how was the law of\r\nnations to be enforced?]\r\n\r\n[The turn of the Thuringians to be swallowed up by the Frankish\r\nMonarchy came in 531.\r\n\r\nSee on this letter Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' ii. 144 and 8 _n._ 2;\r\nPallmann ii. 55.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KING THEODORIC TO LUDUIN (LUDWIG, OR CLOVIS), KING OF THE FRANKS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desires Clovis to desist from war on Alaric.]\r\n\r\n[On the same subject.] 'The affinities of kings ought to keep their\r\nsubjects from the plague of war. We are grieved to hear of the paltry\r\ncauses which are giving rise to rumours of war between you and our son\r\nAlaric, rumours which gladden the hearts of the enemies of both of\r\nyou. Let me say with all frankness, but with all affection, just what\r\nI think: \"It is the act of a passionate man to get his troops ready\r\nfor action at the first embassy which he sends.\" Instead of that refer\r\nthe matter to our arbitration. It would be a delight to me to choose\r\nmen capable of mediating between you. What would you yourselves think\r\nof me if I could hear unmoved of your murderous intentions towards one\r\nanother? Away with this conflict, in which one of you will probably be\r\nutterly destroyed. Throw away the sword which you wield for _my_\r\nhumiliation. By what right do I thus threaten you? By the right of a\r\nfather and a friend. He who shall despise this advice of ours will\r\nhave to reckon us and our friends as his adversaries.\r\n\r\n'I send two ambassadors to you, as I have to my son Alaric, and hope\r\nthat they may be able so to arrange matters that no alien malignity\r\nmay sow the seeds of dissension between you, and that your nations,\r\nwhich under your fathers have long enjoyed the blessings of peace, may\r\nnot now be laid waste by sudden collision. You ought to believe him\r\nwho, as you know, has rejoiced in your prosperity. No true friend is\r\nhe who launches his associates, unwarned, into the headlong dangers of\r\nwar.'\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING THEODORIC TO IMPORTUNUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importunus promoted to the Patriciate.]\r\n\r\n[Importunus was Consul in 509. This letter therefore probably belongs\r\nto the early part of 510.]\r\n\r\n'Noble birth and noble deeds meet in you, and we are therefore\r\nbestowing on you an honour to which by age you are scarcely yet\r\nentitled. Your father and uncle were especially noteworthy, the glory\r\nof the Senate, men who adorned modern ages[278] with the antique\r\nvirtues, men who were prosperous without being hated. The Senate felt\r\ntheir courage, the multitude their wisdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: Notice the use of the word _modernus_ here, a\r\npost-classical word, which apparently occurs first in Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n'Therefore, being descended from such ancestors, and yourself\r\npossessing such virtues, on laying down the Consular fasces, assume\r\nthe insignia of the Patriciate. Bind those fillets, which are\r\ngenerally reserved for the hoary head, round your young locks, and by\r\nyour future actions justify my choice of you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE ON IMPORTUNUS' ACCESSION TO THE\r\nPATRICIATE.\r\n\r\n[See preceding letter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We delight to introduce new men to the Senate, but we delight still\r\nmore when we can bring back to that venerable body, crowned with fresh\r\nhonours, her own offspring[279]. And such is now my fortune in\r\npresenting to you Importunus, crowned with the honours of the\r\nPatriciate; Importunus, who is descended from the great stock of the\r\nDecii, a stock illustrated by noble names in every generation, by the\r\nfavour of the Senate and the choice of the people. Even as a boy he\r\nhad a countenance of serene beauty, and to the gifts of Nature he\r\nadded the endowments of the mind. From his parents in household lays\r\nhe learned the great deeds of the old Decii. Once, at a great\r\nspectacle, the whole school at the recitation of the Lay of the Decii\r\nturned their eyes on Importunus, discerning that he would one day\r\nrival his ancestors. Thus his widowed mother brought him up, him and\r\nall his troop of brothers, and gave to the Curia as many Consulars as\r\nshe had sons[280]. All these private virtues I have discerned in him,\r\nand now seal them with promotion to the Patriciate. At this act I call\r\non you specially to rejoice.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: 'Origo ipsa jam gloria est: laus nobilitati\r\nconnascitur. Idem vobis est dignitatis, quod vitae principium. Senatus\r\nenim honor amplissimus vobiscum gignitur, ad quem vix maturis\r\naetatibus pervenitur.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: 'Et quot edidit familiae juvenes, tot reddidit curiae\r\nconsulares.']\r\n\r\n\r\n7. KING THEODORIC TO THE VENERABLE JANUARIUS, BISHOP OF SALONA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extortion by the Bishop of Salona.]\r\n\r\n'The lamentable petition of John says that you have taken sixty tuns\r\nof oil from him, and never paid him for them. It is especially\r\nimportant that preachers of righteousness should be righteous\r\nthemselves. We cannot suppose that God is ignorant whence come the\r\nofferings which we make before Him [and He must therefore hate robbery\r\nfor a burnt offering]. Pray enquire into this matter, and if the\r\ncomplaint be well founded remedy it promptly. You who preach to us our\r\nduty in great things should not be caught tripping in little ones.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KING THEODORIC TO VENANTIUS, SENATOR, CORRECTOR OF LUCANIA AND\r\nBRUTTII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remissness of Venantius in collection of public revenue.]\r\n\r\n[Venantius, son of Liberius, was, with many high commendations, made\r\nComes Domesticorum in Letters ii. 15 and 16. See further as to his\r\nfall in iii. 36, also iii. 46.]\r\n\r\n'Remissness in the collection of the public taxes is a great fault,\r\nand no kindness in the end to the taxpayer. For want of a timely\r\ncaution you probably have to end by selling him up.\r\n\r\n'The Count of Sacred Largesses tells us that you were long ago\r\ncommissioned to get in the _Bina_ and _Terna_ [and have not done so].\r\nBe quick about it, that the collection may be completed according to\r\nthe registers of the Treasury. If you are not quick, and the Treasury\r\nsuffers loss, you will have to make it good out of your private\r\nproperty. You have not shown proper respect to our orders, nor a due\r\nsense of the obligation of your own promise.'\r\n\r\n[These 'Bina' and 'Terna' are a mystery; but Dahn[281] thinks they are\r\nnot a specially Gothic tax, but an inheritance from the fiscal\r\nadministration of Rome, having probably nothing to do with the\r\nTertiae.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: iii. 145, _n._ 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING THEODORIC TO THE POSSESSORES, DEFENSORES, AND CURIALES[282]\r\nDWELLING AT AESTUNAE[283].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: Note these three classes; as also in ii. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: I have not been able to identify this place.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marbles for Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n'We wish to build new edifices without despoiling the old[284]. But we\r\nare informed that in your municipality there are blocks of masonry and\r\ncolumns formerly belonging to some building now lying absolutely\r\nuseless and unhonoured. If it be so, send these slabs of marble[285]\r\nand columns[286] by all means to Ravenna, that they may be again made\r\nbeautiful and take their place in a building there.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: 'Moderna sine priorum imminutione desideramus\r\nerigere.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: 'Platonias.' This, which is the spelling found in\r\nNivellius' edition, seems to be a more correct form than the\r\n'platomas' of Garet. Ducange, who has a long article on the subject,\r\nrefers the word to the Greek [Greek: platunion].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: Possibly the columns in S. Apollinare Deutro may have\r\nbeen some of those here mentioned.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. KING THEODORIC TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS FESTUS, PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\nA similar order, for the transport of marbles from the Pincian Hill to\r\nRavenna, by Catabulenses[287]. 'We have ordered a \"subvectus\"\r\n[assistance from the public postal-service?], that the labourers may\r\nset to work at once.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: 'Catabulenses,' or 'Catabolenses'--freighters,\r\ncontractors, who effected the transport of heavy goods by means of\r\ndraught-horses and mules.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS [A.D. 510].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Argolicus appointed Praefect of the City.]\r\n\r\nAnnounces to this young man his nomination to the Praefecture of the\r\nCity (for the 4th Indiction). Enlarges on the dignity of the office,\r\nespecially as involving the Presidency of the Senate, and calls upon\r\nhim by a righteous and sober life to show himself worthy of the\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nArgolicus is a great student [perhaps a literary friend of\r\nCassiodorus], and he is exhorted to keep himself in the right path by\r\nmusing on the great examples of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[There is a sort of tone of apology for the appointment of Argolicus,\r\nwhich is perhaps accounted for by the fact, which comes out in the\r\nnext letter, that his father was a comparatively poor man.\r\n\r\nSee a sharp rebuke of Argolicus for venal procrastination, iv. 29.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\nRehearses the usual sentiments about the dignity of the Senate and\r\nTheodoric's care in the choice of officials.\r\n\r\n'It is easier, if one may say so, for Nature herself to err, than that\r\na Sovereign should make a State unlike to himself.'\r\n\r\nRecounts the ancestry of Argolicus. The older Senators will remember\r\nhis eloquent and purely-living grandfather, a man of perfectly\r\northodox reputation, who filled the offices of Comes Sacrarum\r\nLargitionum and Magister Officiorum. His father never stained the\r\ndignity of 'Comes Privatarum' by cruelty, and was free from ill-gotten\r\ngains in an age when avarice was not accounted a crime[288].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: Tillemont understands this of the times of Odovacar,\r\nvi. 438.]\r\n\r\n'We may hope that the son will follow the example of such\r\ndistinguished ancestors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING THEODORIC TO SUNHIVAD, SENATOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sunhivad, Governor of Samnium.]\r\n\r\n[Notice again the Roman title and Gothic name.]\r\n\r\n'You who have ruled your own life in a long career so well should make\r\na good governor of others. I therefore send you to Samnium as\r\nGovernor, in reply to the complaints which reach me from that\r\nProvince. Settle according to the law of justice the disputes which\r\nhave arisen there between the Romans and the Goths.'\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING THEODORIC TO THE VENERABLE BISHOP AURIGENES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accusations against the servants of a Bishop.]\r\n\r\n'You as a Bishop will be especially grieved to hear of any offences\r\nagainst the sanctity of the married state. Julianus complains that his\r\nwife has been outraged and his goods wasted by some of your servants\r\n[probably slaves].\r\n\r\n'Do you enquire into the matter, and if the complaint appears to be\r\njust, deal promptly and severely with the offenders.'\r\n\r\n[Cf. Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 193, on this letter. He shows\r\nthat it has been improperly appealed to as proving the immunity of all\r\necclesiastical persons from a secular tribunal. What Theodoric really\r\nintended was to give the Bishop a chance of settling the affair\r\nhimself, and so to prevent the scandal of its appearing in the secular\r\nCourts, which it assuredly would do if the Bishop were apathetic. But\r\none sees how easily this would glide into something like immunity from\r\nsecular tribunals.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING THEODORIC TO THEODAHAD, SENATOR[289].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: This is no doubt the nephew of Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A contumacious person handed over to Theodahad.]\r\n\r\n'It is the extreme of insolence in anyone not to execute our \"sacred\r\norders.\" A certain person whom we commanded to attend before the\r\njudgment-seat of the Illustrious Sona, has with inveterate cunning\r\nwithdrawn himself therefrom. We therefore hand him over to you, that\r\nyour fame may grow by your skilful management of a difficult case like\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING THEODORIC TO GEMELLUS, SENATOR (509-510).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appointment of Gemellus as Governor of Gaul.]\r\n\r\n'Having proved your worth by experience we are now going to send you\r\nto govern the Provinces of Gaul newly wrested [from Clovis], as Vicar\r\nof the Praefects[290].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: 'Vicarius Praefectorum.' Vicar of what Praefects? Why\r\nthe plural number? Had Theodoric a titular Praefect _of the Gauls_, to\r\nwhom this Vicarius was theoretically subject while practically obeying\r\nthe Praefect of Italy? Or, to prevent bickerings, did he give the\r\n'Praefectus Italiae' and the 'Praefectus Urbis' conjoint authority\r\nover the new conquests? There is some mystery here which would be\r\nworth explaining.]\r\n\r\n'Think what a high opinion we must have formed of you to delegate to\r\nyou the government of these Provinces, the conquest of which has added\r\nso much to our glory, and the good opinion of whose inhabitants we so\r\nparticularly wish to acquire. Abhor turbulence; do not think of\r\navarice; show yourself in all things such a Governor as \"Romanus\r\nPrinceps\" ought to send, and let the Province feel such an improvement\r\nin her lot that she may \"rejoice to have been conquered.\"'\r\n\r\n[This is so like the words put by Sidonius into the mouth of Lyons,\r\nafter Majorian's conquest of her, that I believe it to be\r\nintentionally imitated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE GAULISH PROVINCES (510).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proclamation to the new Gaulish subjects.]\r\n\r\n'Obey the Roman customs. You are now by God's blessing restored to\r\nyour ancient freedom; put off the barbarian; clothe yourselves with\r\nthe morals of the toga; unlearn cruelty, that you may not be unworthy\r\nto be our subjects. We are sending you Spectabilis Gemellus as\r\nVicarius Praefectorum, a man of tried worth, who we trust will be\r\nguilty of no crime, because he knows he would thereby seriously\r\ndisplease us. Obey his commands therefore. Do not dislike the reign of\r\nLaw because it is new to you, after the aimless seethings of Barbarism\r\n(Gentilitas).\r\n\r\n'You may now bring out your long-hidden treasures; the rich and the\r\nnoble will again have a chance of suitable promotion. You may now\r\nenjoy what till now you have only heard of--the triumph of Public\r\nRight, the most certain solace of human life, the help of the weak,\r\nthe curb of the strong. You may now understand that men are exalted\r\nnot by their bodily strength, but by reason.'\r\n\r\n[Some of these reflections on the past misgovernment of _Gentilitas_\r\nhit the Visigoths, Theodoric's friends, harder than the Franks. If the\r\nGaulish nobles of the south-eastern Provinces (and these were all that\r\nTheodoric had conquered) had _long_ been obliged to hide the treasures\r\nof their fathers, that surely was the fault rather of Euric and Alaric\r\nII than of Clovis.\r\n\r\nCf. Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 261-2, on all this\r\ncorrespondence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. KING THEODORIC TO GEMELLUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magnus to be restored to his possessions.]\r\n\r\n[Probably during his government of Gaul].\r\n\r\n'We wish that all who have elected to live under our Clemency should\r\nbe the better for it.\r\n\r\n'The Spectabilis Magnus, spurning the conversation of our enemies\r\n[Franks?], and remembering his own origin, has sought re-patriation in\r\nthe Roman Empire; but during his absence his property has suffered\r\nloss. Let him therefore be restored to, and henceforward have\r\nunquestioned possession of, all that he can prove to be his own in the\r\nway of lands, urban or rural slaves.'\r\n\r\n\r\n19. KING THEODORIC TO DANIEL [A 'COMMONITORIUM'].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monopoly of supply of marble sarcophagi.]\r\n\r\n'We wish the servants of our palace to have proper reward for their\r\nlabours, though we might call on them to render them gratuitously.\r\nTherefore, being much pleased with your skill in preparing and\r\nornamenting marbles, we concede to you the [sole] right of furnishing\r\nthe marble chests in which the citizens of Ravenna bury their dead.\r\n\r\n'They thus keep them above ground--no small consolation to the\r\nsurvivors, since the souls alone depart from this world's\r\nconversation; but they do not altogether lose the bodies which once\r\nwere dear to them.\r\n\r\n'Do not, however, impose upon their sadness; do not let a relative be\r\nforced to the alternative of wasting his substance in funeral\r\nexpenses, or else throwing the body of his dear one into some well. Be\r\nmoderate in your charges.'\r\n\r\n[Odovacar was buried [Greek: en lithinê larnaki] (Joann. Ant. fr.\r\n214).

KING THEODORIC TO THE SAJO GRIMODA AND TO THE APPARITOR\r\nFERROCINCTUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppression of Castorius by Faustus.]\r\n\r\n[Cf. Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 86 and 113.]\r\n\r\n'We are determined to assist the humble, and to repress the violence\r\nof the proud.\r\n\r\n'The lamentable petition of Castorius sets forth that he has been\r\nunjustly deprived of his property by the magnificent Praetorian\r\nPraefect Faustus. [The same, no doubt, to whom are addressed iii. 55,\r\ni. 35, and the immediately succeeding letter (iii. 21).]\r\n\r\n'If it be so, let the invader (pervasor) restore to Castorius his\r\nproperty, and hand over, besides, another property of equal value.\r\n\r\n'If Faustus have employed any intermediate person in the act of\r\nviolence, let him be brought to us in chains; and if that well-known\r\nauthor of ill [Faustus] tries any further to injure Castorius, he\r\nshall pay £2,000, besides having the misery of seeing his would-be\r\nvictim unharmed.\r\n\r\n'No Powers of any kind, be they Praetorian Praefects or what they may,\r\nshall be permitted to trample on the lowly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n21. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disgrace and temporary exile of Faustus.]\r\n\r\n'As all men require change, Faustus is allowed to absent himself from\r\nthe sacred walls of Rome for four months, which he may spend at his\r\nown Penates. The King expects, however, that he will then return to\r\nthe most famous (opinatissima) City, from which no Roman Senator can\r\nlong be absent without grief.'\r\n\r\n[Coupling this letter with its immediate predecessor it is difficult\r\nnot to believe that Faustus is sent away in disgrace--notwithstanding\r\nthe smooth words here used--for the act of injustice therein\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nBut why is he only addressed as Vir Illustris, and not also as\r\nPraefectus? Perhaps his term of office was expired; perhaps he was\r\neven dismissed from it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22. KING THEODORIC TO ARTEMIDORUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An earnest invitation to the King's friend, Artemidorus.]\r\n\r\n'We hereby [by these oracles] invite your Greatness to behold us,\r\nwhich we know will be most agreeable to you, in order that you who\r\nhave now spent a large portion of your life with us may be satisfied\r\nby the sweetness of our presence. He who is permitted to share our\r\nconverse deems it a Divine boon. We believe that you will come gladly,\r\nas we shall entertain you with alacrity.'\r\n\r\n[Cf. Dahn iii. 283-4. The ending of the letter (Venire te gaudentem\r\ncredimus, quem alacriter sustinemus) is the common form, and\r\n'sustineo' is a technical word for the King's reception of his\r\nsubjects: see iii. 28, ad finem.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. KING THEODORIC TO COLOSSAEUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES (CIR. A.D.\r\n505).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appointment of Colossaeus as Governor of Pannonia.]\r\n\r\n'We delight to entrust our mandates to persons of approved character.\r\n\r\n'We are sending you \"with the dignity of the illustrious belt\" to\r\nPannonia Sirmiensis, an old habitation of the Goths. Let that Province\r\nbe induced to welcome her old defenders, even as she used gladly to\r\nobey our ancestors. Show forth the justice of the Goths, a nation\r\nhappily situated for praise, since it is theirs to unite the\r\nforethought of the Romans and the virtue of the Barbarians. Remove all\r\nill-planted customs[291], and impress upon all your subordinates that\r\nwe would rather that our Treasury lost a suit than that it gained one\r\nwrongfully, rather that we lost money than the taxpayer was driven to\r\nsuicide.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: 'Consuetudines abominanter inolitas.' Fornerius thinks\r\nthis means 'all extortionate taxes.' Compare the English use of the\r\nword 'customs.']\r\n\r\n[Cf. Muchar, 'Geschichte der Steiermark' iv. 131.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE BARBARIANS AND ROMANS SETTLED IN\r\nPANNONIA.\r\n\r\n[Cf. Muchar, iv. 132.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the Pannonians, on the appointment of Colossaeus.]\r\n\r\n'Intent on the welfare of our subjects we are sending you Colossaeus\r\nfor Governor. His name means a mighty man; and a mighty man he is, who\r\nhas given many proofs of his virtue. Now we exhort you with patience\r\nand constancy to submit yourselves to his authority. Do not excite\r\nthat wrath before which our enemies tremble. Acquiesce in the rule of\r\njustice in which the whole world rejoices. Why should you, who have\r\nnow an upright Judge[292], settle your grievances by single combat?\r\nWhat has man got a tongue for, if the armed hand is to settle all\r\ndifferences? or where can peace be looked for, if there is fighting in\r\na civilised State like ours[293]? Imitate then our Goths, who have\r\nlearned to practise war abroad, to show peaceable dispositions at\r\nhome. We want you so to live as you see that our subjects (parentes)\r\nhave lived and flourished under the Divine blessing.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: 'Cur ad monomachiam recurritis, qui venalem judicem non\r\nhabetis?']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: 'Aut unde pax quaeritur si sub civilitate pugnetur.']\r\n\r\n\r\n25. KING THEODORIC TO SIMEON, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tax-collecting and iron-mining in Dalmatia.]\r\n\r\n'We entrust to you the duty of collecting throughout the Province of\r\nDalmatia the arrears of Siliquaticum for the first, second, and third\r\nIndictions [Sept. 1, 506, to Aug. 31, 509]. We do this not only for\r\nthe sake of gain to our Treasury, but to prevent the demoralisation of\r\nour subjects.\r\n\r\n'Also by careful mining (cuniculo veritatis) seek out the iron veins\r\nin Dalmatia, where the softness of earth is pregnant with the rigour\r\nof iron, which is cooked by fire that it may become hard.\r\n\r\n'Iron enables us to defend our country, is serviceable for agriculture\r\nand for countless arts of human life: yea, iron is master of gold,\r\ncompelling the rich man, weaponless, to obey the poor man who wields a\r\nblade of steel.'\r\n\r\n\r\n26. KING THEODORIC TO OSUN, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COUNT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Simeon's journey to Dalmatia.]\r\n\r\nCommands him to provide all the necessaries for the journey of\r\n'Clarissimus' Simeon, setting off for Dalmatia on the aforesaid\r\nmission to collect Siliquaticum and develop the iron mines.\r\n\r\n[Why is Simeon not called Illustris, as in the previous letter? This\r\nseems to show that the titles 'Clarissimus' and 'Illustris' were not\r\nalways used with technical exactness, as they would have been under\r\nDiocletian.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. KING THEODORIC TO JOANNES, SENATOR, CONSULAR OF CAMPANIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promises protection against the Praetorian Praefect.]\r\n\r\n'You have not complained to us in vain that the Praetorian Praefect\r\n[perhaps again Faustus] is venting a private grudge against you under\r\ncolour of the discharge of his public duty. We will wall you round\r\nwith our protection. Go now and discharge the duties of Consular of\r\nCampania with the like devotion as your predecessors, and with this\r\nreflection: \"If the King prevents my superior the Praetorian Praefect\r\nfrom doing me harm, with what unfailing rigour will he visit me if I\r\ndo wrong.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n28. KING THEODORIC TO CASSIODORUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN[294].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: Father of the writer.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An invitation to Cassiodorus Senior to come to Court.]\r\n\r\n'For your glorious services, and your incorruptible administration,\r\nwhich has given deep peace to the nation, we reward you by summoning\r\nyou to Court.\r\n\r\n'Having endeavoured to check _another_ [probably alluding to the\r\ndisgrace of Faustus], we have bestowed our praises on you, as all the\r\nPalace knows. Come then, come eagerly, as he should do whom his\r\nSovereign is going to entertain[295].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: There is an obscure sentence in this letter: 'Hinc\r\nomnibus factus notior, quia multi te positum in potestate nesciunt.'\r\nPossibly the meaning is that the elder Cassiodorus used his power so\r\nlittle for his own private aggrandisement, that many people did not\r\neven know that he possessed it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n29. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, ILLUSTRIS AND PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permission to Paulinus to repair certain granaries at\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\n'The King should sow his gifts broadcast, as the sower his seeds--not\r\nput them all into one hole.\r\n\r\n'The Patrician Paulinus represents to us that such and such granaries\r\nare falling into ruin and are of no use to anyone, and asks to be\r\nallowed to repair them and transmit them to his heirs. We consent to\r\nthis, if you are of opinion that they are not wanted for the public,\r\nand if there is no corn in them belonging to our Treasury.\r\n\r\n'It is especially fitting that all ruined buildings should be repaired\r\nin Rome. In Rome, praised beyond all other cities by the world's\r\nmouth, there should be nothing sordid or mediocre[296].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: This letter is well illustrated by an inscription of\r\nthe time of Severus Alexander, found at Great Chesters in\r\nNorthumberland, and recording the repair of 'horreum vetustate\r\nconlabsum.' The words of Cassiodorus are 'horrea longi temporis\r\nvetustate destructa.']\r\n\r\n\r\n30. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, ILLUSTRIS AND PRAEFECTUS URBIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repair of the Cloacae of Rome.]\r\n\r\n'We are ever vigilant for the repair and beautification of Rome.\r\n\r\n'Let your Sublimity know that we have directed John to repair the\r\nCloacae of the City, those splendid works which strike astonishment\r\ninto the hearts of all beholders. There you see rivers as it were shut\r\nin by concave mountains, flowing down through mighty rafters[297] (?).\r\nThere you see men steering their ships with the utmost possible care,\r\nlest they should suffer shipwreck. Hence may the greatness of Rome be\r\ninferred. What other city can compare with her in her heights when\r\neven her depths are so incomparable?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: 'Per ingentia ligna decurrere.' Fornerius proposes to\r\nread 'stagna.']\r\n\r\n'See therefore, O Praefect, that John as a public officer receives his\r\nproper salary.'\r\n\r\n\r\n31. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commission issued to John to check ruin of aqueducts and\r\ntemples in Rome.]\r\n\r\n'Our care is for the whole Republic, \"in which, by the favour of God,\r\nwe are striving to bring back all things to their former state;\" but\r\nespecially for the City of Rome. We hear that great depredations are\r\nbeing committed on public property there.\r\n\r\n'(1) It is said that the water of the aqueducts (formae) is being\r\ndiverted to turn mills and water gardens--a thing which would not be\r\nsuffered even in the country districts. Even in redressing this wrong\r\nwe must be observant of law; and therefore if it should be found that\r\nthose who are doing this can plead thirty years' prescription, they\r\nmust be bought off, but the misuser must cease. If the diversion is of\r\nless ancient date[298], it must of course be at once stopped without\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: 'Si vero aliquid modernâ praesumptione tentatum est.'\r\n(Again 'modernus.')]\r\n\r\n'(2) Slaves assigned by the forethought of previous rulers to the\r\nservice of the formae have passed under the sway of private masters.\r\n\r\n'(3) Great weights of brass and lead (the latter very easy to steal,\r\nfrom its softness) have been stripped off from the public buildings.\r\nNow Ionos, King of Thessaly, is said to have first discovered lead,\r\nand Midas, King of Phrygia, brass. How grievous that we should be\r\nhanded down to posterity as neglecting two metals which they were\r\nimmortalised by discovering!\r\n\r\n'(4) Temples and other public buildings, which at the request of many\r\nwe have repaired, are handed over without a thought to spoliation and\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n'We have appointed the Spectabilis John to enquire into and set\r\nstraight all these matters. _You_ ought to have brought the matter\r\nbefore us yourselves: at least, now, support him with the necessary\r\n\"solatia.\"'\r\n\r\n[See preceding letter as to the commission entrusted to John,\r\nTheodoric's Clerk of the Works in Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\n32. KING THEODORIC TO GEMELLUS, SENATOR. A.D. 511.\r\n\r\n[Appointed Governor of the Gaulish Province in Letter iii. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remission of taxes to citizens of Arles.]\r\n\r\n'The men of Arles, who were reduced to penury in the glorious siege\r\nwhich they endured on our behalf, are freed from the obligation of\r\ntaxes for the fourth Indiction [Sept. 1, 510, to Aug. 31, 511]. We ask\r\nfor these payments from men at peace, not from men besieged. How can\r\none claim taxes from the lord of a field when one knows he has not\r\nbeen able to cultivate it? They have already rendered a most precious\r\ntribute in their fidelity to us. After this year, however, the taxes\r\nwill be collected as usual.'\r\n\r\n\r\n33. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, ILLUSTRIS, PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotion of Armentarius and Superbus to post of Referendi\r\nCuriae.]\r\n\r\nArmentarius (Clarissimus) and his son Superbus are to receive the\r\nprivilege of _Referendi Curiae_[299]. Thus will the profession of the\r\nlaw be, as is most fitting, adorned with the honours of the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: Possibly Referendi is the same as Referendarii. See\r\nVar. vi. 17.]\r\n\r\nPraises of Rhetoric. The man who has swayed the judges by his\r\neloquence is sure to have a favouring audience in the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n34. KING THEODORIC TO THE INHABITANTS OF MASSILIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Count Marabad Governor of Marseilles.]\r\n\r\n'In accordance with our usual policy of sending persons of tried\r\nability and moderation to govern the Provinces, we are sending Count\r\nMarabad [a Gothic name?] to act as your Governor, to bring solace to\r\nthe lowly and repress the insolent, and to force all into the path of\r\njustice, which is the secret of the prosperity of our Empire. As\r\nbefits your long-tried loyalty, welcome and obey him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n35. KING THEODORIC TO ROMULUS.\r\n\r\n[It is surely possible that this is the dethroned Emperor. The name\r\nRomulus, which, as we know, he derived from his maternal grandfather,\r\nwas not a very common one in Rome (it must be admitted there is\r\nanother Romulus, ii. 14). And is there not something rather peculiar\r\nin the entire absence of all titles of honour, the superscription\r\nbeing simply 'Romulo Theodoricus Rex,' as if neither King nor scribe\r\nquite knew how to address an ex-Emperor?]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gifts to Romulus shall not be revoked.]\r\n\r\n'The liberality of the Prince must be kept firm and unshaken by the\r\narts of malignant men. Therefore any gift which shall be proved to\r\nhave been given according to our orders by the Patrician Liberius, to\r\nyou _or to your mother_, by written instrument (pictacium or\r\npittacium), shall remain in full force, and you need not fear its\r\nbeing questioned.'\r\n\r\n[For Liberius, see ii. 16. A man of that eminence, who was employed to\r\narrange disputes between the Goths and Romans at the first settlement\r\nof the former in Italy, was the very man to be also employed to\r\narrange terms with Augustulus. There is some reason to think that the\r\nmother of the deposed Emperor was named Barbaria, and that she is\r\nmentioned in the history of the translation of the relics of St.\r\nSeverinus. See 'Italy and her Invaders' iii. 190.]\r\n\r\n\r\n36. KING THEODORIC TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS COUNT ARIGERN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints against Venantius.]\r\n\r\n'Firminus alleges that he has some cause of complaint against the\r\nMagnificent Venantius [son of Liberius, mentioned in the previous\r\nletter, and strongly commended in ii. 15], and that Venantius treats\r\nhis claims with contempt. There is always a danger of justice being\r\nwrested in the interests of the great. We therefore desire you with\r\nall due reverence to address the aforesaid Magnificent person and\r\ndesire him to appoint a representative, with proper credentials, to\r\nplead in our Court in answer to the claims of Firminus, who will be\r\npunished for his audacity if he have brought a false charge against so\r\nillustrious a person.'\r\n\r\n[This and the preceding letter look as if the fortunes of the house of\r\nLiberius (so greatly extolled in ii. 15 and 16) were passing under a\r\ncloud. See also iii. 8, as to the disgrace of Venantius. This may have\r\nmade the ex-Emperor anxious as to the validity of the settlement made\r\nthrough him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n37. KING THEODORIC TO BISHOP PETER.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alleged injustice of a Bishop.]\r\n\r\n[See the full explanation of this letter in Dahn, 'Könige der\r\nGermanen' iii. 193-4. Cf. also Var. iii. 14.

As it is proper\r\nthat causes which concern you should first be remitted to you (so\r\noften employed as judges to settle the disputes of others), we call\r\nupon you to enquire into this claim, and if it be a just one to\r\nsatisfy it. Know that if you fail to do justice yourself to the\r\npetitioner, his cause will be carried through to our own\r\naudience-chamber.'\r\n\r\n\r\n38.

Let our army live\r\n\"civiliter\" with the Romans, and let the latter feel that our troops\r\nare come for their defence, not for their annoyance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n39.

Therefore let\r\nyour Sublimity enquire into the petition for largesse presented by the\r\ncharioteers of Milan; and if their statements are correct, let them\r\nhave whatever it has been customary for them to receive. In matters\r\nof this kind custom creates a kind of debt.'\r\n\r\n\r\n40. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE PROVINCIALS SETTLED IN GAUL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity from taxes for districts ravaged by war.]\r\n\r\n'We wish promptly to relieve all the distresses of our subjects, and\r\nwe therefore at once announce to you that the districts ravaged by the\r\nincursions of the enemy will not be called upon to pay tribute at the\r\nfourth Indiction [Sept. 510, to Aug. 511]. For we have no pleasure in\r\nreceiving what is paid by a heavy-hearted contributor. The part of the\r\ncountry, however, which has been untouched by the enemy will have to\r\ncontribute to the expense of our army. But a hungry defender is a weak\r\ndefender.'\r\n\r\n\r\n41. KING THEODORIC TO GEMELLUS, SENATOR [Governor of Gothic\r\nGaul[302]].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: See Letters iii. 16 and 32.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corn for the garrisons on the Durance.]\r\n\r\n'A burden borne in common is lightened, since only the edge as it were\r\nof the whole rests on the shoulders of each individual.

KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE PROVINCIALS IN GAUL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No part of Gaul to be called on for military\r\ncontributions.]\r\n\r\n'Because the generosity of the Prince should even outrun the petitions\r\nof his subjects we repeal that part of a previous letter [iii. 40]\r\nwhich says that the unravaged portion of the Province of Gaul must pay\r\nthe expenses of our soldiers. We will transmit to the Duces and\r\nPraepositi sufficient money to provide \"alimonia nostris Gothis.\"'\r\n\r\n['Praebendae,' near the end of this letter, seems to be used in a\r\ntechnical sense, almost equivalent to stipendia or annonae.]\r\n\r\n\r\n43. KING THEODORIC TO UNIGIS, THE SWORD-BEARER [SPATARIUS].\r\n\r\n[No doubt a high officer in the Royal household.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Runaway slaves to be restored to their owners.]\r\n\r\n'We delight to live after the law of the Romans, whom we seek to\r\ndefend with our arms; and we are as much interested in the maintenance\r\nof morality as we can possibly be in war. For what profit is there in\r\nhaving removed the turmoil of the Barbarians, unless we live according\r\nto law? Certain slaves, on our army's entry into Gaul, have run away\r\nfrom their old masters and betaken themselves to new ones. Let them be\r\nrestored to their rightful owners. Rights must not be confounded under\r\nthe rule of justice, nor ought the defender of liberty to favour\r\nrecreant slaves. [Probably an allusion to the office of the _Assertor\r\nLibertatis_ in the _Liberalis Causa_, as set forth in the Theodosian\r\nCode iv. 8.] Let other kings desire the glory of battles won, of\r\ncities taken, of ruins made; our purpose is, God helping us, so to\r\nrule that our subjects shall grieve that they did not earlier acquire\r\nthe blessing of our dominion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n44. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE LANDOWNERS [POSSESSORES] OF ARLES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repair of walls of Arles, and supply of corn.]\r\n\r\n'We wish to refresh men, but to repair cities also, that the renewed\r\nfortune of the citizens may be displayed by the splendour of their\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n'We have therefore directed that a certain sum of money be sent for\r\nthe repair of the walls and old towers of Arles. But we are also going\r\nto send you, as soon as the time is favourable for navigation,\r\nprovisions to supply the waste caused by the war. Be of good cheer,\r\ntherefore! Grain for which our word is pledged is as good as grain\r\nalready in your granaries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n45. KING THEODORIC TO ARIGERN, ILLUSTRIS AND COUNT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Site disputed between Roman Church and Samaritans.]\r\n\r\n'It is represented to us by the Defensors of the \"sacrosanct\" Roman\r\nChurch that Pope Simplicius, of blessed memory, bought a house at\r\nRome[303] of Eufrasius the Acolyte, with all proper formalities, and\r\nthat now the people of the Samaritan superstition, hardened in\r\neffrontery, allege that a synagogue of theirs was built on that site,\r\nand claim it accordingly; whereas the very style of building, say\r\ntheir opponents, shows that this was meant as a private house and not\r\nas a synagogue. Enquire into this matter, and do justice accordingly.\r\nIf we will not tolerate chicanery [calumniae] against men, much less\r\nwill we against the Divinity Himself.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: 'In sacratissimâ urbe.']\r\n\r\n\r\n46. KING THEODORIC TO ADEODATUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further charges of misgovernment against Venantius.]\r\n\r\n'The crimes of subjects are an occasion for manifesting the virtues of\r\nprinces. You have addressed to us your petition, alleging that you\r\nwere compelled by the Spectabilis Venantius, Governor of Lucania and\r\nBruttii, to confess yourself guilty of the rape of the maiden\r\nValeriana.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illogical decision in the case of Adeodatus.]\r\n\r\n'Overcome, you say, by the severity of your imprisonment and the\r\ntortures inflicted upon you, and longing for death as a release from\r\nagony; being moreover refused the assistance of Advocates, while the\r\nutmost resources of rhetoric were at the disposal of your opponents,\r\nyou confessed a crime which you had never committed.\r\n\r\n'Such is your statement. The Governor of Bruttii sends his _relatio_\r\nin opposition, saying that we must not give credence to a petitioner\r\nwho is deceitfully seeking to upset a sentence which was given in the\r\ninterests of public morality.\r\n\r\n'Our decision is that we will by our clemency mitigate the severity of\r\nyour punishment. From the date of this decree you shall be banished\r\nfor six months; and on your return no note of infamy of any kind shall\r\nbe attached to you; since it is competent for the Prince to wipe off\r\nall the blots on a damaged reputation. Anyone who offends against this\r\ndecree [by casting your old offence in your teeth] shall be fined £120\r\n(3 lbs. of gold). And all who are accused of the same offence in any\r\nplace or time, but who offended through ignorance, are to be freed\r\nfrom all fear of punishment.'\r\n\r\n[A most illogical and unjust conclusion, by which the judgment of\r\nVenantius is in fact neither upheld nor reversed. And what the meaning\r\nof the concluding sentence may be it is impossible to conjecture. See\r\nDahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 107, on this absurd decision.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the misgovernment and disgrace of Venantius, cf.\r\nLetters ii. 15, 16; iii. 8, 36. Cf. also Procopius, 'De Bello\r\nGotthico' iii. 18 and 22, as to his son Tullianus. In connection with\r\nthe alleged misgovernment of Bruttii and Lucania by Venantius,\r\nremember the close connection of Cassiodorus himself with those\r\nProvinces.]\r\n\r\n\r\n47. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jovinus, for killing a fellow Curial, is banished to the\r\nislands of Lipari, the volcanoes of which are described.]\r\n\r\n'Jovinus the Curialis, according to the report of the Corrector of\r\nLucania and Bruttii, had an angry altercation with a fellow Curial\r\n(collega), and in his rage slew him.\r\n\r\n'He then took refuge within the precincts of a church, and refused to\r\nsurrender himself to justice. We decide that the capital punishment\r\nshall be remitted out of reverence for his place of refuge, but he\r\nshall be banished to the Vulcanian [Lipari] Islands, there to live\r\naway from the paternal hearth, but ever in the midst of burning, like\r\na salamander, which is a small and subtile beast, of kin to the\r\nslippery worm, clothed with a yellow colour.\r\n\r\n'The substance of volcanoes, which is perpetually destroyed, is by the\r\ninextricable power of Nature perpetually renewed.\r\n\r\n'The Vulcanian Islands are named from Vulcan, the god of fire, and\r\nburst into eruption on the day when Hannibal took poison at the Court\r\nof Prusias. It is especially wonderful that a mountain kindling into\r\nsuch a multitude of flames, should yet be half hidden by the waves of\r\nthe sea.'\r\n\r\n\r\n48. KING THEODORIC TO ALL GOTHS AND ROMANS LIVING NEAR THE FORT OF\r\nVERRUCA[304].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: The double 'r' seems to be the correct spelling, though\r\nthe MSS. of the Variarum apparently have the single 'r.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fortification of Verruca in the Tyrol.]\r\n\r\n'It is the duty and the glory of a ruler to provide with wise\r\nforethought for the safety of his subjects. We have therefore ordered\r\nthe Sajo Leodifrid that under his superintendence you should build\r\nyourselves houses in the fort Verruca, which from its position\r\nreceives its most suitable name[305].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: 'Milites ad Verrucam illum--_sic enim M. Cato locum\r\neditum asperumque appellat_--ire jubeas' (Gell. 3. 7. 6). Verruca\r\ntherefore means primarily a steep cliff, and only secondarily a wart.\r\nSee White and Biddell, s.v.]\r\n\r\n'For it is in the midst of the plains a hill of stone roundly arising,\r\nwhich with its tall sides, being bare of woods, is all one great\r\nmountain fortress. Its lower parts are slenderer (graciliora) than its\r\nsummit, and like some softest fungus the top broadens out, while it is\r\nthin at bottom. It is a mound not made by soldiers[306], a stronghold\r\nmade safe by Nature[307], where the besieged can try no _coup-de-main_\r\nand the besieged need feel no panic. Past this fort swirls the Adige,\r\nthat prince of rivers, with the pleasant gurgle of his clear waters,\r\naffording a defence and an adornment in one. It is a fort almost\r\nunequalled in the whole world, \"a key that unlocks a kingdom[308];\"\r\nand all the more important because it bars the invasion of wild and\r\nsavage nations. This admirable defence what inhabitant would not wish\r\nto share, since even foreigners delight to visit it? and though by\r\nGod's blessing we trust that the Province [of Raetia] is in our times\r\nsecure, yet it is the part of prudence to guard against evils, though\r\nwe may think they will not arise.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: 'Agger sine pugna.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: 'Obsessio secura.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: 'Tenens claustra provinciae.']\r\n\r\nExamples of gulls, who fly inland when they foresee a storm; of\r\ndolphins, which seek the shallower waters; of the edible sea-urchin,\r\n'that honey of flesh, that dainty of the deep,' who anchors himself to\r\na little pebble to prevent being dashed about by the waves; of birds,\r\nwho change their dwellings when winter draws nigh; of beasts, who\r\nadapt their lair to the time of year. And shall man alone be\r\nimprovident? Shall he not imitate that higher Providence by which the\r\nworld is governed?\r\n\r\n[The fortress of Verruca does not seem to be mentioned in the\r\n'Notitia,' in the Antonine 'Itinerary,' or by the geographer of\r\nRavenna.\r\n\r\nMaffei ('Verona Illustrata,' Book ix. Vol. 2, pp. 391-2 in ed. 1825)\r\ncomments on this passage, and argues that _Verruca = Dos Trento_, a\r\ncliff about a mile from Trient, and this identification seems to have\r\nbeen accepted, for Ball ('Alpine Guide, Eastern Alps,' p. 404) says:\r\n'In the centre of the valley, close to the city, rises a remarkable\r\nrock known as _Dos Trento, and also called La Verruca_, formerly\r\nfrequented for the sake of the beautiful view which it commands. Since\r\n1857 it has been strongly fortified, and permission to ascend to the\r\nsummit is not easily obtained.'\r\n\r\nMaffei says that the French bombarded Trient from this rock in 1703.\r\nHe speaks of another 'Verruca, or Rocca,' on the other side of\r\nAquileia, and thinks that the modern word 'rocca' (rock) may perhaps\r\nhave been derived herefrom (?).\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that there is a place called _Verrua_ near the Po in\r\nPiedmont (about 20 miles east of Turin). 'Situated upon an abrupt and\r\ninsulated hill, in a most defensible position, it opposed an obstinate\r\nresistance to the Emperor Frederick II. In more recent times (1704),\r\nthe Duc de Vendôme attacked it without success' (Murray's 'Guide to\r\nNorthern Italy,' p. 51). No doubt this was also originally called\r\n_Verruca_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n49. KING THEODORIC TO THE HONOURED POSSESSORES, DEFENSORES, AND\r\nCURIALES OF THE CITY OF CATANA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repair of amphitheatre of Catana.]\r\n\r\n'It is a great delight to the Ruler when his subjects of their own\r\naccord suggest that which is for the good of the State. You have\r\ncalled our attention to the ruinous state of your walls, and ask leave\r\nto use for its repair the stones of the amphitheatre, which have\r\nfallen down from age and are now of no ornament to your town, in fact\r\nonly show disgraceful ruins. You have not only our permission to do\r\nthis, but our hearty approval. Let the stones, which can be of no use\r\nwhile they lie there, rise again into the fabric of the walls; and\r\nyour improved defence will be our boast and confidence.'\r\n\r\n[Some remains of the amphitheatre are still visible at Catania; not,\r\nhowever, so important as those of the theatre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n50. KING THEODORIC TO THE PROVINCIALS OF NORICUM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Alamanni and Noricans to exchange their cattle.]\r\n\r\n'It is an admirable arrangement when a favour can be conferred by\r\nwhich giver and receiver are alike benefited.\r\n\r\n'We therefore decree that you should exchange your oxen for those of\r\nthe Alamanni.\r\n\r\n'Theirs is the finer and larger breed of cattle, but they are worn out\r\nby the long journey. Thus will they get fresh beasts capable of doing\r\nthe work which is required of them, and you will permanently improve\r\nyour breed of cattle, and so be able to till your fields better. Thus,\r\nwhat does not often happen, the same transaction will equally benefit\r\nboth parties to it.'\r\n\r\n[Cf. ii. 41 as to these Alamannic exiles. Possibly this letter as well\r\nas that refers to their expulsion by Clovis (cir. 504); but it seems\r\nmore probable, as von Schubert suggests (pp. 52-54), that we have here\r\nto do with a removal of some of the Alamannic subjects of Theodoric\r\nfrom Raetia to Noricum, in order to guard the north-east frontier of\r\nthe kingdom.]\r\n\r\n\r\n51. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stipend of Thomas the Charioteer. Description of the\r\nCircus.]\r\n\r\n'Constancy in actors is not a very common virtue, therefore with all\r\nthe more pleasure do we record the faithful allegiance of Thomas the\r\nCharioteer, who came long ago from the East hither, and who, having\r\nbecome champion charioteer, has chosen to attach himself to \"the seat\r\nof our Empire[309];\" and we therefore decide that he shall be rewarded\r\nby a monthly allowance. He embraced what was then the losing side in\r\nthe chariot races and carried it to victory--victory which he won so\r\noften that envious rivals declared that he conquered by means of\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: 'Nostri sedes delegit fovere _Imperii_.']\r\n\r\n'The sight of a chariot-race (spectaculum) drives out morality and\r\ninvites the most trifling contentions; it is the emptier of honourable\r\nconduct, the ever-flowing spring of squabbles: a thing which Antiquity\r\ncommenced as a matter of religion, but which a quarrelsome posterity\r\nhas turned into a sport.\r\n\r\n'For Aenomaus is said first to have exhibited this sport at Elis, a\r\ncity of Asia (?), and afterwards Romulus, at the time of the rape of\r\nthe Sabines, displayed it in rural fashion to Italy, no buildings for\r\nthe purpose being yet founded. Long after, Augustus, the lord of the\r\nworld, raising his works to the same high level as his power, built a\r\nfabric marvellous even to Romans, which stretched far into the Vallis\r\nMurcia. This immense mass, firmly girt round with hills, enclosed a\r\nspace which was fitted to be the theatre of great events.\r\n\r\n'Twelve _Ostia_ at the entrance represent the twelve signs of the\r\nZodiac. These are suddenly and equally opened by ropes let down by the\r\n_Hermulae_ (little pilasters)[310]. The four colours worn by the four\r\nparties of charioteers denote the seasons: green for verdant spring,\r\nblue for cloudy winter, red for flaming summer, white for frosty\r\nautumn. Thus, throughout the spectacle we see a determination to\r\nrepresent the works of Nature. The _Biga_ is made in imitation of the\r\nmoon, the _Quadriga_ of the sun. The circus horses (_Equi\r\ndesultorii_), by means of which the servants of the Circus announce\r\nthe heats (_Missos_) that are to be run, imitate the herald-swiftness\r\nof the morning star. Thus it came to pass that while they deemed they\r\nwere worshipping the stars, they profaned their religion by parodying\r\nit in their games.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: The Ostia are denoted by A and the Hermulae by H in\r\nthe accompanying plan. (See page 230.)]\r\n\r\n'A white line is drawn not far from the ostia to each _Podium_\r\n(balcony), that the contest may begin when the quadrigae pass it, lest\r\nthey should interrupt the view of the spectators by their attempts to\r\nget each before the other[311]. There are always seven circuits round\r\nthe goals (_Metae_) to one heat, in analogy with the days of the week.\r\nThe goals themselves have, like the decani[312] of the Zodiac, each\r\nthree pinnacles, round which the swift quadrigae circle like the sun.\r\nThe wheels indicate the boundaries of East and West. The channel\r\n(_Euripus_) which surrounds the Circus presents us with an image of\r\nthe glassy sea, whence come the dolphins which swim hither through the\r\nwaters[313] (?). The lofty obelisks lift their height towards heaven;\r\nbut the upper one is dedicated to the sun, the lower one to the moon:\r\nand upon them the sacred rites of the ancients are indicated with\r\nChaldee signs for letters[314].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: 'Ut quadrigis progredientibus, inde certamen oriretur:\r\nne dum semper propere conantur elidere, spectandi voluptatem\r\nviderentur populis abrogare.' In fact, to compel the charioteers to\r\nstart fair.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: Each sign of the Zodiac was considered to have three\r\ndecani, occurring at intervals of ten days.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: 'Unde illuc delphini aequorei aquas interfluunt.' The\r\nsentence is very obscure, but the allusion must be to the dolphins,\r\nthe figures of which were placed upon the spina.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: 'Obeliscorum quoque prolixitates ad coeli altitudinem\r\nsublevantur: sed potior soli, inferior lunae dicatus est: ubi sacra\r\npriscorum Chaldaicis signis, quasi litteris indicantur.']\r\n\r\n'The _Spina_ (central wall, or backbone) represents the lot of the\r\nunhappy captives, inasmuch as the generals of the Romans, marching\r\nover the backs of their enemies, reaped that joy which was the reward\r\nof their labours. The _Mappa_ (napkin), which is still seen to give\r\nthe signal at the games, came into fashion on this wise. Once when\r\nNero was loitering over his dinner, and the populace, as usual, was\r\nimpatient for the spectacle to begin, he ordered the napkin which he\r\nhad used for wiping his fingers to be thrown out of window, as a\r\nsignal that he gave the required permission. Hence it became a custom\r\nthat the display of a napkin gave a certain promise of future\r\n_circenses_.\r\n\r\n'The _Circus_ is so called from \"circuitus:\" _circenses_ is, as it\r\nwere, _circu-enses_, because in the rude ages of antiquity, before an\r\nelaborate building had been prepared for the purpose, the races were\r\nexhibited on the green grass, and the multitude were protected by the\r\nriver on one side and the swords (_enses_) of the soldiers on the\r\nother[315].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: I can extract no other meaning than the above from this\r\nextraordinary sentence: 'Circenses, quasi circu-enses: propterea quod\r\napud antiquitatem rudem, quae necdum spectacula in ornatum deduxerat\r\nfabricarum, inter _enses_ et flumina locis virentibus agerentur.']\r\n\r\n'We observe, too, that the rule of this contest is that it be decided\r\nin twenty-four heats[316], an equal number to that of the hours of day\r\nand night. Nor let it be accounted meaningless that the number of\r\ncircuits round the goals is expressed by the putting up of\r\n_eggs_[317], since that emblem, pregnant as it is with many\r\nsuperstitions[318], indicates that something is about to be born from\r\nthence. And in truth we may well understand that the most fickle and\r\ninconstant characters, well typified by the birds who have laid those\r\neggs, will spring from attendance on these spectacles[319]. It were\r\nlong to describe in detail all the other points of the Roman Circus,\r\nsince each appears to arise from some special cause. This only will we\r\nremark upon as pre-eminently strange, that in these beyond all other\r\nspectacles men's minds are hurried into excitement without any regard\r\nto a fitting sobriety of character. The Green charioteer flashes by:\r\npart of the people is in despair. The Blue gets a lead: a larger part\r\nof the City is in misery. They cheer frantically when they have gained\r\nnothing; they are cut to the heart when they have received no loss;\r\nand they plunge with as much eagerness into these empty contests as if\r\nthe whole welfare of the imperilled fatherland were at stake.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: _Missibus._ In a previous sentence Cassiodorus makes\r\nthe acc. plural _missos_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: The number of times that the charioteers had rounded\r\nthe goal was indicated by large wooden _eggs_, which were posted up in\r\na conspicuous place on the spina. It seems that in a corresponding\r\nplace near the other end of the spina figures of _dolphins_ were used\r\nfor the same purpose. Upon the Cilurnum gem (figured on page 231) we\r\ncan perceive four eggs near one end of the spina, and four creatures\r\nwhich may be dolphins near the other, indicating that four circuits\r\nout of the seven which constitute a missus have been accomplished by\r\nthe quadrigae.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: Alluding probably to the story of Castor and Pollux.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: 'Et ideo datur intelligi, volitantes atque\r\ninconstantissimos inde mores nasci, quos avium matribus aptaverunt.'\r\n_Ovium_ would seem to give a better sense than _avium_.]\r\n\r\n'No wonder that such a departure from all sensible dispositions should\r\nbe attributed to a superstitious origin. We are compelled to support\r\nthis institution by the necessity of humouring the majority of the\r\npeople, who are passionately fond of it; for it is always the few who\r\nare led by reason, while the many crave excitement and oblivion of\r\ntheir cares. Therefore, as we too must sometimes share the folly of\r\nour people, we will freely provide for the expenses of the Circus,\r\nhowever little our judgment approves of this institution.'\r\n\r\n[Notwithstanding some absurdities, the above description of the Circus\r\nMaximus (which I have attempted to translate in full) is of great\r\nvalue, being, after that given by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, our\r\nchief authority on the subject. The accompanying plan (taken, with\r\nsome slight variations, from Smith's 'Dictionary of Antiquities'),\r\nwill, I trust, render it intelligible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Ancient Circus.]\r\n\r\nIt is well illustrated by the recently excavated 'Stadium of\r\nAugustus,' on the Palatine; but perhaps even better by a beautifully\r\nexecuted gem lately found at Chesters in Northumberland, on the site\r\nof the Roman station at Cilurnum. By the kindness of the owner, Mr.\r\nClayton, I am able to give an enlarged copy of this gem, which is\r\ndescribed in the 'Archaeologia Aeliana,' vol. x. pp. 133-137.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Circus Maximus, a magnified engraving of an\r\nintaglio on a carnelian signet-ring found at Cilurnum (Chesters in\r\nNorthumberland) in 1882.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily discern the _Spina_ with one obelisk (not two,\r\nas described by Cassiodorus) in the centre, the high tables supported\r\nby pillars on which the Ova and Delphini are placed, the three\r\nspindle-shaped columns which formed the _Meta_ at each end, and the\r\nfour quadrigae (four was the regular number for each missus) careering\r\nin front.]\r\n\r\n\r\n52. KING THEODORIC TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS CONSULARIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On Roman land surveying.]\r\n\r\n'We are sorry to hear that a dispute (which is on the point of being\r\nsettled by arms instead of by the law) has arisen between the\r\nSpectabiles Leontius and Paschasius as to the boundaries of their\r\nproperties[320]. If they are so fierce against one another here in\r\nItaly, where there are mountains and rivers and the \"arcaturae\"\r\n[square turrets of the land surveyor] to mark the boundaries, what\r\nwould they have done in Egypt, where the yearly returning waters of\r\nthe Nile wash out all landmarks, and leave a deposit of mud over all?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: 'Casarum.' Casa is evidently no longer a cottage;\r\nperhaps the estate attached to a villa. There is probably still a\r\nflavour of rusticity about it.]\r\n\r\n'Geometry was discovered by the Chaldaeans, who perceived that its\r\nprinciples lay at the root of Astronomy, Music, Mechanics,\r\nArchitecture, Medicine, Logic, and every science which deals with\r\ngenerals. This science was eagerly welcomed by the Egyptians, who\r\nperceived the advantage it would be to them in recovering the\r\nboundaries of estates obliterated by the wished-for deluge[321] of the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: 'Votiva inundatione.']\r\n\r\n'Therefore let your Greatness send an experienced land surveyor\r\n(agrimensor) to settle this dispute by assigning fixed boundaries to\r\nthe two estates.\r\n\r\n'Augustus made a complete survey of the whole \"Orbis Romanus,\" in\r\norder that each taxpayer should know exactly his resources and\r\nobligations. The results of this survey were tabulated by the author\r\nHyrummetricus. The Professors of this Science [of land surveying] are\r\nhonoured with a more earnest attention than falls to the lot of any\r\nother philosophers. Arithmetic, Theoretical Geometry, Astronomy, and\r\nMusic are discoursed upon to listless audiences, sometimes to empty\r\nbenches. But the land surveyor is like a judge; the deserted fields\r\nbecome his forum, crowded with eager spectators. You would fancy him a\r\nmadman when you see him walking along the most devious paths. But in\r\ntruth he is seeking for the traces of lost facts in rough woods and\r\nthickets[322]. He walks not as other men walk. His path is the book\r\nfrom which he reads; he _shows_ what he is saying; he proves what he\r\nhath learned; by his steps he divides the rights of hostile claimants;\r\nand like a mighty river he takes away the fields of one side to bestow\r\nthem on the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: An excellent description of an antiquary walking along\r\na Roman 'Limes Imperii.']\r\n\r\n'Wherefore, acting on our instructions, choose such a land surveyor,\r\nwhose authority may be sufficient to settle this dispute, that the\r\nlitigants may henceforth cultivate their lands in peace.'\r\n\r\n\r\n53. KING THEODORIC TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS APRONIANUS, COUNT OF THE PRIVATE\r\nDOMAINS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On Water-finders.]\r\n\r\n'Your Greatness tells us that a water-finder has come to Rome from\r\nAfrica, where, on account of the dryness of the soil, his art is\r\ngreatly in request.\r\n\r\n'We are glad to hear it. It is a very useful art.\r\n\r\n'Signs of the existence of water are the greenness of the grass, the\r\nsize of the trees, the nature of the plants, reeds, rushes, brambles,\r\nwillows, poplars, &c. Some discover water by putting out dry wool\r\nunder a bowl at night. So too, if you see at sunrise a cloud [or\r\ngossamer, 'spissitudinem'] of very small flies. A mist rising like a\r\ncolumn shows water as deep below as the column rises high above.\r\n\r\n'The water-finder will also predict the quality of the water, and so\r\nprevent you from wasting labour on a brackish spring. This science was\r\nably treated of by ----[323], and by Marcellus among the Latins. They\r\ntell us that waters which gush forth towards the east and south are\r\nlight and wholesome; that those which emerge towards the north and\r\nwest are too cold and heavy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: 'Apud Graecos _ille_.' Cassiodorus has left the name\r\nblank, and has either forgotten or been unable to fill it up; like the\r\n'ille et ille' in his State documents.]\r\n\r\n'So then, if the testimonials of the aforesaid water-finder and the\r\nresults of his indications shall approve themselves to your wisdom,\r\nyou may pay his travelling expenses and relieve his wants: he having\r\nto repay you by his future services. For though Rome itself is so\r\nabundantly supplied with aqueducts, there are many suburban places in\r\nwhich his help would be very useful. Associate with him also a\r\nmechanician who can sink for and raise the water when he has pointed\r\nit out. Rome ought not to lack anything which is an object of\r\ndesire.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING FIFTY-ONE LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS IN THE NAME OF\r\nTHEODORIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KING THEODORIC TO HERMINAFRID, KING OF THE THURINGIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage of Theodoric's niece to the King of the\r\nThuringians.]\r\n\r\n'Desiring to unite you to ourselves by the bonds of kindred, we bestow\r\nupon you our niece [Amalabirga, daughter of Theodoric's sister; see\r\n'Anon. Valesii' § 70], so that you, who descend from a Royal stock,\r\nmay now far more conspicuously shine by the splendour of Imperial\r\nblood[324]'. [A remarkable passage, as showing that Theodoric did in a\r\nsense consider himself to be filling the place of the Emperors of the\r\nWest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: 'Nunc etiam longius claritate Imperialis sanguinis\r\nfulgeatis.']\r\n\r\nThe virtues and intellectual accomplishments of the new Queen of the\r\nThuringians are described.\r\n\r\n'We gladly acknowledge the price of a favour, in itself beyond price,\r\nwhich, according to the custom of the nations, we have received from\r\nyour ambassadors: namely, a team of horses, silvery in colour, as\r\nwedding-horses should be. Their chests and thighs are suitably adorned\r\nwith round surfaces of flesh. Their ribs are expanded to a certain\r\nwidth. They are short in the belly. Their heads have a certain\r\nresemblance to the stag, the swiftness of which animal they imitate.\r\nThese horses are gentle from their extreme plumpness; very swift\r\nnotwithstanding their great bulk; pleasant to look at, still better\r\nto use. For they have gentle paces, not fatiguing their riders by\r\ninsane curvetings. To ride them is repose rather than toil; and being\r\nbroken-in to a delightful and steady pace, they can keep up their\r\nspeed, over long distances.\r\n\r\n'We too are sending you some presents, but our niece is the fairest\r\npresent of all. May God bless you with children, so that our lines may\r\nbe allied in future.'\r\n\r\n\r\n2. KING THEODORIC TO THE KING OF THE HERULI. [Adopting him as his son\r\nby right of arms.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Herminafrid adopted as 'filius per arma' by Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n'It has been always held amongst the nations a great honour to be\r\nadopted as \"filius per arma.\" Our children by nature often disappoint\r\nour expectations, but to say that we esteem a man _worthy to be our\r\nson_ is indeed praise. As such, after the manner of the nations and in\r\nmanly fashion, do we now beget you[325].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: Notice the strong expression, 'Et ideo more gentium et\r\nconditione virili filium te praesenti munere _procreamus_.']\r\n\r\n'We send you horses, spears, and shields, and the rest of the\r\ntrappings of the warrior; but above all we send you our judgment that\r\nyou are worthy to be our son[326]. Highest among the nations will you\r\nbe considered who are thus approved by the mind of Theodoric.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: 'Damus quidem tibi equos, enses clypeos, et reliqua\r\ninstrumenta bellorum, sed quae sunt omnimodis fortiora, largimur tibi\r\nnostra judicia.']\r\n\r\n'And though the son should die rather than see his father suffer aught\r\nof harm, we in adopting you are also throwing round you the shield of\r\nour protection. The Heruli have known the value of Gothic help in old\r\ntimes, and that help will now be yours. A and B, the bearers of these\r\nletters, will explain to you in Gothic (patrio sermone) the rest of\r\nour message to you[327].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: In 512, says Marcellinus Comes, 'Gens Erulorum in\r\nterras atque civitates Romanorum jussu Anastasii Caesaris introducta.'\r\nBut what relation that entry of the Heruli into Roman territory may\r\nbear to this letter is a very difficult question. See Dahn, Könige der\r\nGermanen ii. 8, _n._ 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. KING THEODORIC TO SENARIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, COMES.\r\n\r\n[Conferring upon him the dignity of 'Comitiva Patrimonii.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Senarius made Comes Patrimonii.]\r\n\r\n'The master's fame is enhanced by choosing the right persons for his\r\nservants. The Sovereign ought to promote such persons that whenever he\r\ncondescends to behold them he may feel that his _judicia_[328] have\r\nbeen justified. We therefore hereby bestow upon you, for the fourth\r\nIndiction [Sept. 1, 510], the Illustrious dignity of Comes of our\r\nPatrimony.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: Same expression as in preceding letter.]\r\n\r\nServices of Senarius as a diplomatist, in standing up against\r\nBarbarian Kings and subduing their intellects to the moderate counsels\r\nof Theodoric[329].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: 'Subiisti saepe arduae legationis officium. Restitisti\r\nregibus non impar assertor, coactus justitiam nostram et illis\r\nostendere, qui rationem vix poterant cruda obstinatione sentire. Non\r\nte terruit contentionibus inflammata regalis auctoritas,' etc.]\r\n\r\nHis success as an advocate[330]. The charm of his pronunciation. His\r\npurity of morals; his popularity with high and low. He is exhorted\r\nstill to cultivate these dispositions, and to win favour for his\r\noffice by his affable demeanour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: 'Usus es sub exceptionis officio eloquentis ingenio.'\r\n'Exceptio' is a law term, the defendant's answer to the plaintiff's\r\nbill; but is it so used here?]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Announcing the promotion of Senarius, conferred in the preceding\r\nletter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nDescribes the merits of the new Comes, who when young in years but\r\nmature in merit had entered the service of the Palace; his diplomatic\r\ncareer[331] and his moderation and reserve in the midst of success,\r\nalthough naturally 'joy is a garrulous thing,' and it is difficult for\r\nmen who are carrying all before them to restrain the expression of\r\ntheir exaltation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: Again we have 'exceptiones' mentioned (see preceding\r\nletter). 'Nunc ad colloquia dignus, _nunc ad exceptiones aptissimus_,\r\nfrequenter etiam in legationis honorem electus.']\r\n\r\nCompliments to the Senate, who are invited to give a hearty welcome to\r\nthe new comer.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING THEODORIC TO AMABILIS, VIR DEVOTUS[332] AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: Probably this epithet means that Amabilis was a Sajo.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supply of provisions to famine-stricken Provinces of Gaul.]\r\n\r\n'Having heard that there is dearth in our Gaulish Provinces we direct\r\nyour Devotion to take bonds from the shipmasters along the whole\r\nwestern coast of Italy (Lucania, Campania, and Thuscia) that they will\r\ngo with supplies of food only to the Gauls, having liberty to dispose\r\nof their cargoes as may be agreed between buyer and seller. They will\r\nfind their own profit in this, for there is no better customer for a\r\ncorn-merchant than a hungry man. He looks on all his other possessions\r\nas dross if he can only supply the cravings of necessity. He who is\r\nwilling to sell to a man in this condition almost seems to be _giving_\r\nhim what he needs, and can very nearly ask his own price.'\r\n\r\n[It will be seen that in this letter there is no attempt to fix a\r\nmaximum price, only to prescribe the kind of cargo, 'victuales\r\nspecies,' which is to be carried to Gaul.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING THEODORIC TO SYMMACHUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sons of Valerian to be detained in Rome.]\r\n\r\n'The Spectabilis Valerian, who lives at Syracuse, wishes to return\r\nthither himself, but that his sons, whom he has brought to Rome for\r\ntheir education, may be detained in that City.\r\n\r\n'Let your Magnificence therefore not allow them to leave the aforesaid\r\nCity till an order has been obtained from us to that effect. Thus will\r\ntheir progress in their studies be assured, and proper reverence be\r\npaid to our command. And let none of them think this a burden, which\r\nshould have been an object of desire[333]. To no one should Rome be\r\ndisagreeable, for she is the common country of all, the fruitful\r\nmother of eloquence, the broad temple of the virtues: it is a striking\r\nmark of our favour to assign such a City as a residence to any of our\r\nsubjects[334].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: 'Non ergo sibi putet impositum quod debuit esse\r\nvotivum. Nulli sit ingrata Roma, quae dici non potest aliena. Illa\r\neloquentiae foecunda mater, illa virtutum omnium latissimum templum.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: Cf. the very similar letter, i. 39.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. KING THEODORIC TO SENARIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, COMES PRIVATARUM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Losses by shipwreck to be refunded to those who were\r\nsending provisions to Gaul.]\r\n\r\n'Any calamity which comes upon a man from causes beyond his control\r\nought not to be imputed to him as a fault. The pathetic petition of\r\nthe Superintendents of Grain[335] informs us that the cargoes which\r\nthey destined for Gaul have perished at sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: 'Prosecutores frumentorum.' It would seem that these\r\nare not merchants supplying the famine-stricken Provinces of Gaul as a\r\nprivate speculation (according to iv. 5), but public officers who have\r\nhad certain cargoes of corn entrusted to them from the State\r\nmagazines, and who, but for this letter, would be bound to make good\r\nthe loss suffered under their management.]\r\n\r\n'The framework of the timbers of the ships gaped under the violence of\r\nthe winds and waves, and from all that overabundance of water nothing\r\nremains to them but their tears.\r\n\r\n'Let your Sublimity therefore promptly refund to them the proportion\r\n(modiatio) which each of them can prove that he has thus lost. It\r\nwould be cruel to punish them for having merely suffered shipwreck.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KING THEODORIC TO THE HONOURED POSSESSORES AND CURIALES OF FORUM\r\nLIVII (FORLI).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transport of timber ordered for Alsuanum.]\r\n\r\n'You must not think anything which we order hard; for our commands are\r\nreasonable, and we know what you ought to do. Your Devotion is\r\ntherefore to cut timber and transport it to Alsuanum[336], where you\r\nwill be paid the proper price for it.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: Where is this?]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING THEODORIC TO OSUIN, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tuitio regii nominis.]\r\n\r\n[This letter is quoted by Dahn ('Könige der Germanen' iii. 117) as an\r\nillustration of '_tuitio regii nominis_.']\r\n\r\n'Maurentius and Paula, who are left orphans, inform us that their\r\nyouth and helplessness expose them to the attacks of many unscrupulous\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n'Let your Sublimity therefore cause it to be known that any suits\r\nagainst them must be prosecuted in our Comitatus, the place of succour\r\nfor the distressed and of sharp punishment for tricksters.'\r\n\r\n\r\n10. KING THEODORIC TO JOANNES, SENATOR AND CONSULARIS OF CAMPANIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lawless custom of Pignoratio is to be repressed.]\r\n\r\n[A custom had apparently grown up during the lawless years of the\r\nFifth Century, of litigants helping themselves, during the slow\r\nprogress of the suit, to a 'material guarantee' from the fields of\r\ntheir opponents. This custom, unknown apparently at the time of the\r\nTheodosian Code, was called 'Pignoratio,' and was especially rife in\r\nthe Provinces of Campania and Samnium.]\r\n\r\n'How does peace differ from the confusion of war, if law-suits are to\r\nbe settled by violence? We hear with displeasure from our Provincials\r\nin Campania and Samnium that certain persons there are giving\r\nthemselves up to the practice of _pignoratio_. And so far has this\r\ngone that neighbours club together and transfer their claims to some\r\none person who \"pignorates\" for the whole of them, thus in fact\r\ncompelling a man to pay a debt to an entire stranger--a monstrous\r\nperversion of all the rules of law, which separates so delicately\r\nbetween the rights even of near relations, and will not allow the son\r\nto be sued for the father's debts unless he is the heir, nor the wife\r\nfor the husband's unless she has succeeded to the estate. Hitherto our\r\nignorance has allowed this lawless practice to exist. Now that we know\r\nof it we are determined to suppress it. Therefore, firstly, if any man\r\nlays violent hands on any property to secure an alleged claim, he\r\nshall at once forfeit that claim [and restore the _pignus_]. Secondly,\r\nwhere one has \"pignorated\" for another, he shall be compelled to\r\nrestore twofold the value of that which he has taken. Thirdly, if any\r\noffender is so poor and squalid that restitution cannot be compelled\r\nfrom him, he shall be beaten with clubs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n11. KING THEODORIC TO SENARIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dispute between Possessores and Curiales.]\r\n\r\n'Let your Magnitude enquire into and decide promptly the dispute\r\nbetween the Possessores and Curiales of Velia.' [A conjectural\r\nemendation for _Volienses_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. KING THEODORIC TO MARABAD, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES; AND GEMELLUS,\r\nSENATOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Archotamia's complaint against the extravagant widow of her\r\ngrandson.]\r\n\r\n'It is our purpose not only to defend by arms but to govern by just\r\nlaws the Provinces which God has subjected to us.\r\n\r\n'Archotamia, an illustrious lady who has lost her grandson by death,\r\ncomplains that his widow Aetheria, having married again with a certain\r\nLiberius, is wasting the property of her children in order to make\r\nher new home appear more splendid.\r\n\r\n'Let your Sublimities enquire into this matter. After suppressing all\r\nviolent action[337], placing the holy Gospels in the midst of the\r\nCourt, and calling in three honourable persons agreed upon by the\r\nparties, as assessors, decide with their help upon the matter\r\naccording to ancient law, due reference being had to the arrangements\r\nof modern times.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: 'Omni incivilitate submotâ.']\r\n\r\n[Theodoric says that in not hearing the case himself, but referring it\r\nto Marabad and Gemellus, he is following his usual practice,\r\n'remittere ad statuta Divalium sanctionum;' that is, apparently,\r\naccording to the Theodosian Code. See Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iv.\r\n140, _n._ 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING THEODORIC TO SENARIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, COMES PRIVATARUM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supplies for Colossaeus and his suite.]\r\n\r\n'Let Colossaeus, who is sent as Governor to Pannonia Sirmiensis, have\r\nrations for himself and suite, according to ancient usage. [For his\r\nappointment, see Letters iii. 23 and 24.]\r\n\r\n'A hungry army cannot be expected to preserve discipline, since the\r\narmed man will always help himself to that which he requires. Let him\r\nhave the chance of buying, that he may not be forced to think what he\r\ncan plunder. Necessity loves not a law[338], nor is it right to\r\ncommand the many to observe a moderation which even the few can barely\r\npractise.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: 'Necessitas moderamen non diligit.']\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING THEODORIC TO THE SAJO GESILA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evasion of land-tax by Goths in Picenum and Thuscia.]\r\n\r\n'It is a great offence to put off the burden of one's own debts upon\r\nother people. That man ought to pay the \"tributum\" for a property who\r\nreceives the income of it. But some of the Goths in Picenum and the\r\ntwo Tuscanies[339] are evading the payment of their proper taxes[340].\r\nThis vicious practice must be suppressed at once, lest it spread by\r\nimitation. If anyone in a spirit of clownish stubbornness shall still\r\nrefuse to obey our commands as expressed through you, affix the proper\r\nnotice to his houses and confiscate them, that he who would not pay a\r\nsmall debt may suffer a great loss[341]. None ought to be more prompt\r\nin their payments to the exchequer than those [the Goths] who are the\r\nreceivers of our donative. The sum thus given by our liberality is\r\nmuch more than they could claim as soldiers' pay. In fact _we_ pay\r\nthem a voluntary tribute by the care which we have of their fortunes.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: 'Gothi per Picenum sive Thuscias utrasque residentes.'\r\nWhat are the two Thusciae?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: 'Debitas functiones.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: 'Si quis ergo jussa nostra agresti spiritu resupinatus\r\nabjecerit, casas ejus appositis titulis fisci nostri juribus\r\nvindicabis; ut qui juste noluit parva solvere, rationabiliter videatur\r\nmaxima perdidisse.']\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING THEODORIC TO BENENATUS, SENATOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New rowers to be selected. Their qualifications.]\r\n\r\n'Being informed by the Illustrious and Magnificent Count of the\r\nPatrimony that twenty-one of the _Dromonarii_ [rowers in the\r\nexpress-boats] have been removed by the inconvenient incident of\r\ndeath, we hereby charge you to select others to fill their places. But\r\nthey must be strong men, for the toil of rowing requires powerful arms\r\nand stout hearts to battle with the stormy waves. For what is in fact\r\nmore daring than with one's little bark to enter upon that wide and\r\ntreacherous sea, which only despair enables a man successfully to\r\ncombat?'\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arigern entrusted with the charge of the City of Rome.]\r\n\r\n'Some time ago we committed the government of our new Gaulish\r\nProvinces to Arigern, a member of your body, that he might by his\r\nfirmness and prudence bring about a settlement in that agitated\r\ncountry. This he has accomplished to our entire satisfaction, and,\r\npractising the lessons which he learned in your midst, he has also\r\nbrought back warlike trophies from thence. We now decide to bestow\r\nupon him the charge of the Roman order.\r\n\r\n'He is to see that the laws are vigorously administered, and that\r\nprivate revenge has no place.\r\n\r\n'Receive, O Conscript Fathers, your honoured and venerable member back\r\ninto your bosom.'\r\n\r\n[It seems probable that Arigern was not appointed 'Praefectus Urbis,'\r\nbecause in Letter iv. 22 he is associated as Comes with Argolicus,\r\n'Praefectus Urbis.' Was he 'Comes Urbis Romae?']\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KING THEODORIC TO IDA, VIR SUBLIMIS AND DUX.\r\n\r\n[Cf. the name of our own Northumbrian King.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Possessions of the Church of Narbonne to be restored to\r\nit.]\r\n\r\n'We do not wish to disturb anything that has been well settled by a\r\npreceding King. Certain possessions of the Church of Narbonne, which\r\nwere secured to it by grant of the late King Alaric of exalted memory,\r\nhave been wrongfully wrested from it. Do you now restore these. As you\r\nare illustrious in war, so be also excellent in \"civilitas.\" The\r\nwrong-doers will not dare to resist a man of your well-known bravery.'\r\n\r\n\r\n18. KING THEODORIC TO ANNAS, SENATOR AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A priestly Ghoul.]\r\n\r\n'Enquire if the story which is told us be true, namely that the\r\nPresbyter Laurentius has been groping for fatal riches among human\r\ncorpses. An odious inversion of his functions, that he who should\r\npreach peace to the living has been robbing the dead, and that hands\r\nwhich have been touched with the oil of consecration should have been\r\ngrasping at unholy gains, instead of distributing his own honestly\r\nacquired substance to the poor. If after diligent examination you\r\nfind that the charge is true, you must make him disgorge the gold. As\r\nfor punishment, for the sake of the honour of the priesthood we leave\r\nthat to a higher Power[342].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: 'Scelus enim, quod nos pro sacerdotali honore\r\nrelinquimus impunitum, majori pondere credimus vindicandum.' The words\r\nseem to be purposely vague, but I think they allude to the judgment of\r\nHeaven on the offender.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. KING THEODORIC TO GEMELLUS, SENATOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Siliquaticum not to be levied on corn, wine, and oil.]\r\n\r\n'The Prince should try to remedy the afflictions of his subjects.\r\nTherefore, for the present time [probably on account of the scarcity\r\nin Gaul], we decree that the tax of Siliquaticum, which Antiquity\r\nordained should be levied on all buyings and sellings, shall not be\r\nlevied on corn, wine, and oil. We hope thus to stimulate trade, and to\r\nbenefit not only the Provincials, who are our chief care, but also the\r\nmerchants. Let the ship that traverses the seas not fear our harbours.\r\nOften the sailor dreads the rapacity of the collector of customs more\r\nthan the danger of shipwreck. It shall not be so now.'\r\n\r\n\r\n20. KING THEODORIC TO GEBERICH, SENATOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land taken from the Church to be restored to it.]\r\n\r\n'If we are willing to enrich the Church by our own liberality, _à\r\nfortiori_ will we not allow it to be despoiled of the gifts received\r\nfrom pious princes in the past.\r\n\r\n'The supplication of the Venerable Bishop Constantius informs us that\r\na _jugum_ [= jugerum, about two-thirds of an English acre] of land so\r\nbestowed on the \"sacrosanct\" Church has been taken away from her, and\r\nis unlawfully held by the despoiler.\r\n\r\n'See that right is done, and that the Church has her own restored to\r\nher without any diminution.'\r\n\r\n\r\n21. KING THEODORIC TO GEMELLUS, SENATOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promptness and integrity required.]\r\n\r\n'Be prompt in the execution of our orders. No one should think our\r\ncommands harsh, since they are excused by the necessity of the times.\r\n[Reject the thought of all unjustly acquired gains, for] you are sure\r\nto receive from our favour all that you seem to lose by not yielding\r\nto temptation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n22. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PRAEFECT OF THE\r\nCITY; AND\r\n\r\n23. KING THEODORIC TO ARIGERN, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman Senators accused of magic.]\r\n\r\nThese two letters relate to the affair of Basilius[343] and\r\nPraetextatus, men of high rank in Rome. They are accused of practising\r\nmagical arts, and in the interval between the first and second letters\r\nthey escape from prison by taking advantage of the insanity of the\r\ngaoler.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: Basilius, the patron of Sidonius, was Consul in 463,\r\nand another Basilius, perhaps the father of the accused, was Consul in\r\n480. The person here spoken of _may_ be the same as the Basilius,\r\n'olim regio ministerio depulsus,' whom Boethius (Phil. Cons. i. 4)\r\nmentions as one of his accusers; but it seems more likely that in that\r\ncase this imputation of magical practices would also have been\r\nreferred to by him. The name Basilius was a somewhat common one at\r\nthis time.]\r\n\r\nTheodoric, who says that he will not suffer any such acts of treason\r\nagainst the Divine Majesty, and that it is not lawful for Christian\r\ntimes to deal in magical arts, orders the recapture of the offenders,\r\nwho are to be handed over to a Quinque-viral Board, consisting of the\r\nPatricians Symmachus, Decius, Volusianus, and Caelianus, with the\r\nIllustrious Maximian, and by them examined; if guilty to be punished\r\n(probably with confiscation and exile); if innocent, of course to be\r\ndischarged[344].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: At the beginning of the first letter occurs the\r\nremarkable expression 'Abscedat ritus de medio jam profanus;\r\nconticescat _poenale murmur animarum_,' which the commentator\r\ninterprets of the ventriloquistic sounds produced by soothsayers. Cf.\r\nMilton's Christmas Hymn:\r\n\r\n    'No voice or hideous hum\r\n    Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.']\r\n\r\n[The association of the Quinque-viri with the Praefectus Urbis is a\r\nmark of the high rank of the accused. The Praefectus Urbis could not\r\nadjudicate on the crimes of Senators without five Assessors chosen by\r\nlot from that body. Arigern, who was entrusted (it is not quite clear\r\nin what capacity) with the 'Disciplina Romanae Civitatis,' is\r\ncommissioned to bring the accused to trial. Baronius says that we do\r\nnot hear whether they were ever re-captured.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KING THEODORIC TO ELPIDIUS, DEACON [of Spoleto].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Architectural restoration at Spoleto.]\r\n\r\nGives leave to pull down a _porticus_ behind the Baths of Turasius at\r\nSpoleto, and to build some new edifice [perhaps a church] on its site\r\nand on the site of a yard (areola) adjoining it, on condition only\r\nthat the building thus pulled down is of no public utility.\r\n\r\nReflections on the duty of architectural restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, PRAEFECTUS URBIS.\r\n\r\n[It is to be borne in mind that the Praefectus Urbis was the Official\r\nPresident of the Senate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petrus to be inscribed as Senator.]\r\n\r\n'Ambition ennobles man, and he who has aimed when young at high\r\nhonours is often stimulated to lead a worthy life by the fact of\r\nhaving obtained them. We therefore look favourably on the petition of\r\nPetrus, illustrious by descent, and in gravity of character already a\r\nSenator, to enter the Sacred Order (the Senate); and we authorise your\r\nIllustrious Magnificence to inscribe his name, according to ancient\r\ncustom, in the album of that body.'\r\n\r\n[A Petrus, probably the same as the subject of this letter, was Consul\r\nin 516.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF MARSEILLES[345].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: 'Universis Massiliae constitutis.' A curious\r\nexpression.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taxes remitted for a year.]\r\n\r\nConfirms all privileges and immunities granted by previous Princes,\r\nand remits the taxes (censum) for one year, a boon which they had not\r\ndared to ask for. 'For that is perfect _pietas_, which before it is\r\nbent by prayer, knows how to consider the weary ones.'\r\n\r\n[Here, as in many other passages of Cassiodorus, _pietas_ shows signs\r\nof passing into the Italian _pietà_ (= pity).]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. KING THEODORIC TO THE SAJO TEZUTZAT,\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\n28. KING THEODORIC TO DUDA, SENATOR AND COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petrus assaulted by the Sajo who was assigned for his\r\nprotection.]\r\n\r\n[Duda was also a Sajo, as we see from Letter 32. Dahn ('Könige der\r\nGermanen' iv. 142, _n._ 3) thinks he was Comes Gothorum.]\r\n\r\nBoth letters relate to the affair of Petrus (a Vir Spectabilis, and\r\nprobably the same whose admission to the Senate is ordered by iv. 25).\r\n\r\nThis Roman nobleman, according to a usage common under Theodoric's\r\ngovernment, has had the Gothic Sajo Amara assigned to him as his\r\nDefensor. Amara, by an inversion of his functions, which the letter\r\nbitterly laments and upbraids, has turned upon his _protegé_ and even\r\nused personal violence towards him. He has drawn a sword and wounded\r\nhim in the hand; and nothing but the fact that Petrus was sheltered by\r\na door saved him from losing his hand altogether.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding this assault, Amara has had the audacity to claim\r\nfrom his victim 'commodi nomine,' the usual payment made by the\r\ndefended to the defender.\r\n\r\nThe first letter decrees that this shall be refunded twofold, and\r\nassigns Tezutzat instead of Amara to the office of Defender, warning\r\nhim not to follow the evil example of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe second assigns to Duda the task of enquiring into the alleged\r\nassault and punishing it with the sword[346].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: The story of this assault is a typical specimen of the\r\nstyle of Cassiodorus, high-flown yet not really pictorial: 'Ita ut\r\nictum gladii in se demersum, aliquatenus postium retardaret objectio:\r\nsubjecta est vulneri manus, quae ut in totum truncata non caderet,\r\njanuarum percussa robora praestiterunt: ubi lassato impetu corusca\r\nferri acies corporis extrema perstrinxit.']\r\n\r\n\r\n29. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Official tardiness rebuked.]\r\n\r\nA sharp rebuke to him for having (if the _suggestio_ of the\r\nClarissimus Armentarius be correct) so long delayed, it is to be\r\nfeared with a corrupt motive, complying with the instructions of the\r\nKing to do justice in some case (not described) in which the honour of\r\nthe Senate is concerned. As head of the Senate he ought to have been\r\neager to examine into it, without any prompting from his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. KING THEODORIC TO ALBINUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Workshops may be erected above the Porticus Curba, by the\r\nRoman Forum.]\r\n\r\n'Those whom the Republic has honoured should in their turn bring\r\nhonour to the City. We are therefore gratified by receiving your\r\nsupplication for leave to erect workshops[347] above the Porticus\r\nCurba, which being situated near the Domus Palmata, shuts in the Forum\r\nin comely fashion \"in modum areae.\" We like the plan. The range of\r\nprivate dwellings will thereby be extended. A look of cheerful newness\r\nwill be given to the old walls; and the presence of residents in the\r\nbuilding will tend to preserve it from further decay. You have our\r\npermission and encouragement to proceed, if the proposed erections do\r\nnot in any way interfere with public convenience or the beauty of the\r\nCity.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: Fabricae.]\r\n\r\n[The MSS. of Cassiodorus waver between Curbae and Curiae in the above\r\nletter. Jordan ('Topographie der Stadt Rom.' i. 2. 258) inclines to\r\nthe opinion that Porticus Curba denotes the Portico of the Secretarium\r\nof the Senate, on the site of the present Church of Sta. Martina. As\r\nthe Curia immediately adjoined this building, there is practically but\r\nlittle difference between the two readings. In either case the\r\nfabricae were to be erected so as to overlook the north-west end of\r\nthe Forum. It is admitted that the Domus Palmata was near the Arch of\r\nSeptimius Severus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. KING THEODORIC TO AEMILIANUS, VIR VENERABILIS, BISHOP.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An aqueduct to be promptly finished.]\r\n\r\n'Wise men should finish what they have begun, and not incur the\r\nreproach which attends half-done work.\r\n\r\n'Let your Holiness therefore promptly complete what by our authority\r\nyou so well began in the matter of the aqueduct, and thus most fitly\r\nprovide water for your thirsting flock, imitating by labour the\r\nmiracle of Moses, who made water gush forth from the flinty rock.'\r\n\r\n\r\n32. KING THEODORIC TO DUDA THE SAJO.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rights of the Crown to the property of the proscribed\r\nman, Tupha, to be asserted with moderation.]\r\n\r\n'We are anxious strictly to obey the laws, and to take no advantage\r\nover our subjects in courts of justice. If a man knows that he can get\r\nhis own by legal process, even from the Sovereign, he is the less\r\nlikely to seek it by the armed hand. The memorandum of Marinus informs\r\nus that the property of Tupha was long ago mortgaged to a certain\r\nJoannes[348]. But since it is quite clear that the property of a\r\nproscribed man belongs to our fiscus, we desire you to summon the\r\nwidow of this Joannes and his secretary Januarius, \"moderata\r\nexecutione.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: 'Marini relatione comperimus res Tuphae apud Joannem\r\nquondam sub emissione chirographi fuisse depositas.']\r\n\r\n'If they acknowledge that they have no right to the property let them\r\nat once restore it; but if not, let them come before the _Consularis_\r\nof Campania and establish their right according to course of law.\r\n\r\n'But let all be done without loss or prejudice to the rights of\r\ninnocent persons. If any such charge be established against you, _you_\r\nwill become the offender in our eyes.'\r\n\r\n[The description of Tupha as 'proscriptus' makes it probable that we\r\nare dealing with that officer of Odovacar whose double treachery\r\n(489-490) so nearly caused the failure of Theodoric's invasion of\r\nItaly, and who finally fell in battle against his fellow-rebel,\r\nFrederic the Rugian. The only difficulty is the lapse of time since\r\nthose events, as this letter was probably written not earlier than\r\nabout 511; but that is in some degree met by the word _quondam_ in the\r\nsentence quoted (_n._ 1, p. 250).]\r\n\r\n\r\n33. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE JEWS OF GENOA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privileges of the Jews confirmed.]\r\n\r\n'The true mark of _civilitas_ is the observance of law. It is this\r\nwhich makes life in communities possible, and which separates man from\r\nthe brutes. We therefore gladly accede to your request that all the\r\nprivileges which the foresight of antiquity conferred upon the Jewish\r\ncustoms shall be renewed to you[349], for in truth it is our great\r\ndesire that the laws of the ancients shall be kept in force to secure\r\nthe reverence due to us[350]. Everything which has been found to\r\nconduce to _civilitas_ should be held fast with enduring devotion.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: 'Privilegia debere servari quae Judaicis institutis\r\nlegum provida decrevit antiquitas.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: 'Quod nos libenter annuimus qui jura veterum ad nostram\r\ncupimus reverentiam custodiri.']\r\n\r\n\r\n34. KING THEODORIC TO DUDA THE SAJO.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buried treasure to be reclaimed for the State.]\r\n\r\n'It is the part of true prudence to recall to the uses of commerce\r\n\"the talent hidden in the earth.\" We therefore direct you, by this\r\n\"moderata jussio,\" where you hear of buried treasures to proceed to\r\nthe spot with suitable witnesses and reclaim for the public Treasury\r\neither gold or silver, abstaining, however, from actually laying hands\r\non the ashes of the dead[351]. The dead can do nothing with treasure,\r\nand it is not greedy to take away what the holder of it can never\r\nmourn the loss of.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: How this was to be done is not quite clear, since it is\r\nplain that this letter is really and chiefly an order for rifling\r\n_sepulchres_ in search of buried treasure.]\r\n\r\n'Eacus is said to have discovered the use of gold, and Indus, King of\r\nthe Scythians, that of silver. They are extremely useful metals.'\r\n\r\n\r\n35. KING THEODORIC TO THE REPRESENTATIVES (ACTORES) OF ALBINUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An extravagant minor. Restitutio in integrum.]\r\n\r\n'It has been wisely decided by Antiquity that minors cannot make a\r\nbinding contract, for they are naturally the prey of every sharper.\r\nYou allege that your _patronus_ [Albinus] is under age, that he is\r\nheaping up expenses instead of property, and that his raw boyhood does\r\nnot know what is really for his benefit. If this be correct, and be\r\nlegally proved, he is entitled to a _restitutio in integrum_' [a suit\r\ncommenced through these Actores for the quashing of the contracts\r\nwhich have been fraudulently made with the minor].\r\n\r\n[For the _restitutio in integrum_, see Cod. Theod. ii. 16. 1, and vi.\r\n4. 16. Nothing seems to be expressly said in this letter about the\r\nappointment of a _Curator_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n36. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT. A.D. 509-510.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remission of taxes for Provincials of Cottian Alps.]\r\n\r\n'A wise ruler will always lessen the weight of taxation when his\r\nsubjects are weighed down by temporary poverty. Therefore let your\r\nMagnificence remit to the Provincials of the Cottian Alps the _as\r\npublicum_ for this year [the third Indiction], in consideration of\r\ntheir losses by the passage of our army. [The army of Ibbas, on its\r\nmarch in 408 to fight Clovis, after the fall of the Visigothic\r\nMonarchy.] True, that army went forth with shouts of concord to\r\n_liberate_ Gaul. But so a river bursting forth may irrigate and\r\nfertilise a whole country, and yet destroy the increase of that\r\nparticular channel in which its waters run.\r\n\r\n'We have earned new subjects by that campaign: we do not wish them to\r\nsuffer loss by it. Our own heart whispers to us the request which the\r\nsubjects dare not utter to their Prince.'\r\n\r\n\r\n37. KING THEODORIC TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS WOMAN THEODAGUNDA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theodagunda is admonished to do justice to Renatus.]\r\n\r\nWarns Theodagunda [apparently a member of the royal family and\r\ngoverning some Province; but what place could she hold in the Roman\r\nofficial hierarchy?], that she must emulate the virtue of her\r\nancestors and show prompt obedience to the royal commands. 'The\r\nlamentable petition of Renatus states that, after judgment given in\r\nhis favour by the King's Court, he is still harassed by the litigation\r\n(not in the way of regular appeal) of Inquilina, who appears to be not\r\nso much desirous of victory as anxious to ruin his adversary.'\r\n[Notwithstanding the form of the name I think Inquilina is male, not\r\nfemale.]\r\n\r\n'You must see that this is put right at once.'\r\n\r\n\r\n38. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taxes must be reduced to the figure at which they stood in\r\nthe days of Odoacer.]\r\n\r\n'The inhabitants of Gravasi (?) and Ponto (?) complain that they have\r\nbeen overloaded with taxes by the Assessors (discussores) Probus and\r\nJanuarius. They have bad land, and say that they really cannot cope\r\nwith the taxes imposed upon them [at the last Indiction?]. The former\r\npractice is to be reverted to, and they are not to be called upon to\r\npay more than they did in the days of Odoacer.' [An evidence that in\r\none case at least the fiscal yoke of Odoacer was lighter than that of\r\nhis successor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. KING THEODORIC TO THEODAHAD, VIR ILLUSTRIS [AND NEPHEW OF THE\r\nKING].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The encroachments of Theodahad repressed.]\r\n\r\n'Avarice, which Holy Writ declares to be \"the root of all evil,\" is a\r\nvulgar vice which you, our kinsman, a man of Amal blood, whose family\r\nis known to be royal, are especially bound to avoid[352].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: 'Amali sanguinis virum nos decet vulgare desiderium:\r\nquia genus suum conspicit esse purpuratum.']\r\n\r\n'The Spectabilis Domitius complains to us that such and such portions\r\nof his property have been seized by you with the strong hand, without\r\nany pretence of establishing a legal claim to them.\r\n\r\n'We send the Sajo Duda to you, and order you on his arrival[353],\r\nwithout any delay, to restore the property which you have taken\r\npossession of, with all the moveables of which you have despoiled it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: 'Si momenti tempora suffragantur.' What is the meaning\r\nof this limitation?]\r\n\r\n'If you have any claim to make to the lands in question, send a person\r\nfully informed of the facts to our Comitatus, and there let the case\r\nbe fairly heard.\r\n\r\n'A high-born man should ever act according to well-ordered\r\n_civilitas_. Any neglect of this principle brings upon him odium,\r\nproportioned to the oppression which the man of humbler rank conceives\r\nhimself to have suffered at his hands.'\r\n\r\n\r\n40. KING THEODORIC TO THE REPRESENTATIVES (ACTORES) OF PROBINUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The affair of Agapeta. Basilius, her husband, ordered to\r\nplead.]\r\n\r\nRecurs to the case of the Possessio Areciretina, which Agapeta, the\r\nwife of Basilius, had given (or sold) to Probinus, and which Probinus\r\nwas commanded to restore. (See Letters ii. 10 and 11.)\r\n\r\nThe petition, now presented by the representatives of Probinus, puts a\r\nsomewhat different face upon the matter, and seems to show that the\r\nsale by Agapeta (notwithstanding her melancholy condition of fatuity\r\nand vice) was a _bonâ fide_ one, for sufficient consideration.\r\n\r\nHer husband Basilius is now ordered to reply to the pleadings of the\r\nopposite party, either at the King's Comitatus, or in some local court\r\nof competent jurisdiction. The King's Comitatus is meant to be a\r\nblessing to his subjects, and recourse to it is not made compulsory\r\nwhere, on account of distance, the suitor would rather be excused from\r\nresorting to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n41. KING THEODORIC TO JOANNES, ARCH-PHYSICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An unjust judgment against Joannes reversed.]\r\n\r\n'A King should delight to succour the oppressed.\r\n\r\n'You inform us that, by the devices of the Spectabilis Vivianus and\r\nhis superior knowledge of the laws, an unjust judgment was obtained\r\nagainst you, in default, in the Court of the Vicarius of the City of\r\nRome: that Vivianus himself has now renounced the world, repents of\r\nhis injustice to you, and interposes no obstacle to the restitution of\r\nyour rights. We therefore (if your statements shall prove to be\r\ncorrect) quash the sentence against you, restore you to your country\r\nand your property, and that you may be preserved from future\r\nmolestation, founded on the old sentence against you, we assign you to\r\nthe guardianship (tuitio) of the Patrician Albinus, without prejudice\r\nto the laws (salvis legibus).\r\n\r\n'We wish that nothing contrary to _civilitas_ should be done, since\r\nour daily labour is for the repose of all.' [I presume that this\r\nletter is in fact an edict for 'Restitutio in integrum.']\r\n\r\n\r\n42. KING THEODORIC TO ARGOLICUS, PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sons of Velusian to have their property restored to\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\n'Under a good King the loss even of a father should be less felt than\r\nwith a different ruler, for the King is the father of his people.\r\n\r\n'The petition of Marcian and Maximius, sons of Velusian (Patrician and\r\nMagnificus), sets forth that they lost their father at Easter; that\r\nthus the time of joy to all Christians became to them a season of\r\nsorrow; that while they were immersed in their grief and incapable of\r\nattending to their affairs, \"the tower of the circus and the place of\r\nthe amphitheatre[354],\" which had belonged to their illustrious\r\nfather, were by some heartless intriguer wrested from them, under the\r\nauthority of the Praefect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: Can this be the Amphitheatrum Castrense?]\r\n\r\n'Be pleased to enquire into this matter, and if those places truly\r\nbelonged to Velusian, restore them to his sons. We wish to cherish\r\nrather than oppress the sons of illustrious men, who are the germ of\r\nour future Senate.'\r\n\r\n\r\n43. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Punishment of incendiaries who have burned a Jewish\r\nSynagogue.]\r\n\r\n[On the burning of the Jewish synagogue. This synagogue of the Jews\r\nwas in the Trastevere. See Gregorovius i. 296-298 for a description of\r\nit. I do not know on what authority he assigns 521 for the date of\r\nthe tumult in which it was burned.]\r\n\r\n'The propriety of manners which is characteristic of the City of Rome\r\nmust be upheld. To fall into the follies of popular tumult, and to set\r\nabout burning their own City, is not like the Roman disposition[355].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: 'Levitates quippe seditionum et ambire propriae\r\ncivitatis incendium, non est velle Romanum.']\r\n\r\n'But we are informed by Count Arigern[356] that the populace of Rome,\r\nenraged at the punishment inflicted on some Christian servants who had\r\nmurdered their Jewish masters, has risen in fury and burned their\r\nsynagogue to the ground[357], idly venting on innocent buildings their\r\nanger against the men who used them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: It happens that one of the letters addressed to Count\r\nArigern also refers to a Jewish synagogue. See iii. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: 'Quod in dominorum caede proruperit servilis audacia:\r\nin quibus cum fuisset pro districtione publicâ resecatum, statim\r\nplebis inflammata contentio synagogam temerario duxerunt incendio\r\nconcremandam.' The above is Gregorovius' explanation of the somewhat\r\nenigmatical language of Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n'Be pleased to enquire into this matter, and severely punish the\r\nauthors of the tumult, who are probably few in number.\r\n\r\n'At the same time enquire into the complaints which are brought\r\nagainst the Jews, and if you find that there is any foundation for\r\nthem, punish accordingly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n44. KING THEODORIC TO THE VENERABLE ANTONIUS, BISHOP OF POLA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bishop Antonius called upon to do justice to Stephanus.]\r\n\r\n'It is an invidious task to have to listen to complaints against the\r\nrevered ministers of the Church.\r\n\r\n'But the petition of Stephanus sets forth that a property, which\r\nbelonged to him before the time of your predecessor, has, within the\r\nlast nine months, wrongfully, and in defiance of _civilitas_, been\r\nseized by the officers of your church. If this be so, we desire you,\r\nas a matter of justice, to correct what your familiars have done\r\namiss, and restore it to him without delay. But if you dispute his\r\ntitle, send a properly instructed person to plead the cause in our\r\nComitatus.\r\n\r\n'You will be better off by having the matter enquired into and\r\nsettled, than if the complaints of Stephanus had never come to a\r\nhearing[358].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: There are some technical terms in this letter the\r\nmeaning of which is not clear to me: 'Eam justitiae consideratione\r\n_momenti_ jure restituite supplicanti....

KING THEODORIC TO THE COMITES, DEFENSORES, AND CURIALES OF TICINUM\r\n(PAVIA).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Heruli to be forwarded on their way to Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n[It is not easy to see why this order should be addressed to the\r\ninhabitants of Ticinum.

The words\r\n'jussu Anastasii Caesaris' represent this chronicler's tendency to\r\nrefer everything that is done in Italy to the initiation of\r\nByzantium.]\r\n\r\n\r\n46. KING THEODORIC TO MARABAD, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of the wife of Liberius to be reheard.]\r\n\r\n'The Spectabilis Liberius[360] complains that his wife has had an\r\nunjust judgment given against her in your Court.

Anyone transgressing is to pay a\r\nfine of 100 solidi (£60) per horse; not that the injury to the animal\r\nis represented by so high a figure, but in order to punish his\r\nimpertinence. Our Sajones, when sent with a commission, are to go\r\nstraight to the mark and return, not to make pleasure-tours at the\r\npublic expense; and if they disobey this order, they are to pay the\r\nsame fine as that just mentioned.\r\n\r\n'Moreover, the extra horses (parhippi) are not to be weighted with a\r\nload of more than 100 lbs. For we wish our messengers[361] to travel\r\nin light marching order, not to make of their journey a regular\r\ndomestic migration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: 'Mittendarii.' A 'Scrinium Mittendariorum' formed part\r\nof the staff of the Count of Sacred Largesses. See Theodosian Code vi.\r\n30. 7.]\r\n\r\n'Cranes, when they are going to cross the sea, clasp little pebbles\r\nwith their claws, in order to steady without overweighting themselves.\r\nWhy cannot those who are sent on public errands follow so good an\r\nexample?

See iii. 10.]\r\n\r\n'All fines levied under this edict are to go to the benefit of the\r\npostal-servants[363], and thus the evil will, as we so often see in\r\nhuman affairs, furnish its own remedy.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: 'Mancipes mutationum.' The 'mutationes' were the places\r\nfor changing horses; there are generally two of them between each\r\n'mansio' (hostelry). Probably the horses were found by the 'Mancipes\r\nmutationum.' It was therefore a sort of _corvée_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n48. KING THEODORIC TO EUSEBIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honourable retirement of Eusebius.]\r\n\r\n'After the worries of the noisy City, and the heavy burden of your\r\nofficial duties, your Greatness is longing to taste the sweetness of\r\ncountry life. When therefore you have finished your present duties, we\r\ngrant you by our authority a holiday of eight months in the charming\r\nrecesses of Lucania [near Cassiodorus' own country], to be reckoned\r\nfrom the time when by Divine [royal?] favour you depart from the City.\r\nWhen those months are at an end, return with speed, much missed as you\r\nwill be, to your Roman habitation, to the assembly of the nobles, and\r\nto social intercourse of a kind that is worthy of your character.'\r\n\r\n\r\n49. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE PROVINCIALS AND THE LONG-HAIRED\r\nMEN[364], THE DEFENSORES AND THE CURIALES RESIDING IN SUAVIA[365].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: _Capillatis._ The only passage which throws a light on\r\nthis name--and that is a doubtful one--is Jordanes, De Rebus Geticis\r\nxi. After describing the _pileati_, the tiara-wearing priests of the\r\nGetae, he says: 'Reliquam vero gentem capillatos dicere jussit\r\n[Diceneus] quod nomen Gothi pro magno suscipientes adhuc hodie suis\r\ncantionibus reminiscuntur.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: _Suavia_ is nearly equivalent to the modern Sclavonia,\r\nbetween the rivers Drave and Save.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fridibad to be Governor of Suavia, and to punish\r\nfreebooters.]\r\n\r\n'The King's orders must be vigorously executed, that terror may be\r\nstruck into the hearts of the lawless, and that those who have\r\nsuffered violence may begin to hope for better days. Often the threat\r\nof punishment does more to quiet a country than punishment itself.\r\nTherefore, under Divine guidance, we have appointed Fridibad to be\r\nyour Governor.\r\n\r\n'He will punish cattle-lifters with due severity, will cut off\r\nmurderers, condemn thieves, and render you, who are now torn by\r\npresumptuous iniquity, safe from the daring attempts of villains. Live\r\nlike a settled people; live like men who have learned the lessons of\r\nmorality; let neither nationality nor rank be alleged as an excuse\r\nfrom these duties. If any man gives himself up to wicked courses, he\r\nmust needs undergo chastisement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n50. KING THEODORIC TO FAUSTUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remission of taxes for Campanians who have suffered from an\r\neruption of Vesuvius.]\r\n\r\n'The Campanians complain that their fields have been devastated by an\r\neruption of Vesuvius, and ask in consequence for a remission of\r\ntribute. [This eruption is assigned--I do not know on what\r\nauthority--to the year 512[366].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: The passage in Marcellinus Comes, s.a. 512, which at\r\nfirst sight seems to describe an eruption taking place in that year,\r\nreally describes the _commemoration_ of the eruption of 472. See\r\nfollowing note.]\r\n\r\n'Let your Greatness send men of proved integrity to the territories of\r\nNeapolis and Nola, who may examine the ravaged lands for themselves,\r\nand proportion the relief granted, to the amount of damage done in\r\neach case.\r\n\r\n'That Province is visited at intervals by this terrible calamity, as\r\nif to mar its otherwise perfect happiness. There is one favourable\r\nfeature in the visitation. It does not come wholly unawares. For some\r\ntime before, the mountain groans with the strife of Nature going on\r\ninside it, and it seems as if an angry spirit within would terrify all\r\nthe neighbourhood by his mighty roar. Then the air is darkened by its\r\nfoul exhalations; hot ashes scudding along the sea, a shower of drops\r\nof dust upon the land, tell to all Italy, to the transmarine\r\nProvinces, to the world, from what calamity Campania is\r\nsuffering[367].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: In the eruption of 472 (apparently the last great\r\neruption previous to 512), the ashes were carried as far as Byzantium,\r\nthe inhabitants of which city instituted a yearly religious service in\r\nmemory of the event: 'Vesuvius mons Campaniae torridus intestinis\r\nignibus aestuans exusta evomuit viscera, nocturnisque in die tenebris\r\nincumbentibus, _omnem Europae faciem minuto contexit pulvere_. Hujus\r\nmetuendi memoriam cineris Byzantii annue celebrant VIII Idus\r\nNovembris.' The eruption was accompanied by widespread earthquake: 'In\r\nAsia aliquantae civitates vel oppida terrae motu collapsa sunt'\r\n(Marcellinus Comes, sub anno).]\r\n\r\n'Go nearer: you will see as it were rivers of dust flowing, and\r\nglowing streams of barren sand moving over the country. You see and\r\nwonder: the furrows of the fields are suddenly lifted to a level with\r\nthe tops of the trees; the country, which but now was dressed in a\r\nrobe of gladsome greenness, is laid waste by sudden and mournful heat.\r\nAnd yet, even those sandy tracts of pumice-stone which the mountain\r\nvomits forth, dry and burnt up as they appear, have their promise of\r\nfertility. There are germs within them which will one day spring to\r\nlife, and re-clothe the mountain side which they have wasted.\r\n\r\n'How strange that one mountain alone should thus terrify the whole\r\nworld! Other mountains may be seen with silently glowing summits; this\r\nalone announces itself to distant lands by darkened skies and changed\r\nair. So it still goes on, shedding its dusty dews over the land; ever\r\nparting with its substance, yet a mountain still undiminished in\r\nheight and amplitude. Who that sees those mighty blocks in the plain\r\nwould believe that they had boiled over from the depths of that\r\ndistant hill, that they had been tossed like straws upon the wind by\r\nthe angry spirit of the mountain?\r\n\r\n'Therefore let your Prudence so manage the enquiry that those who have\r\nreally suffered damage shall be relieved, while no room is left for\r\nfraud.'\r\n\r\n\r\n51. KING THEODORIC TO SYMMACHUS, PATRICIAN[368].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: The father-in-law of Boethius.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commends the public spirit of Symmachus, as shown in the\r\nrestoration of Pompey's theatre.]\r\n\r\nCommends him for the diligence and skill with which he has decorated\r\nRome with new buildings--especially in the suburbs, which no one would\r\ndistinguish from the City except for the occasional glimpses of\r\npleasant fields; and still more for his restoration of the massive\r\nruins of past days[369], chiefly the theatre of Pompeius.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: We have here a striking description of the massive\r\nstrength of the public buildings of Rome: '[Videmus] caveas illas\r\nsaxis pendentibus apsidatas ita juncturis absconditis in formas\r\npulcherrimas convenisse, ut cryptas magis excelsi montis crederes quam\r\naliquid fabricatum esse judicares.']\r\n\r\nAs the letter is addressed to a learned man, it seems a suitable\r\nopportunity to explain why Antiquity reared this mighty pile.\r\nAccordingly a very long digression follows on the origin, progress,\r\nand decline of Tragedy, Comedy, and Pantomime.\r\n\r\nIt is remarked incidentally that Pompeius seems to have derived his\r\nappellation _Magnus_ chiefly from the building of this wonderful\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nThe expense which Symmachus has been put to in these vast works is to\r\nbe refunded to him by the _Praepositus Sacri Cubiculi_, that he may\r\nstill have the glory of the work, but that the King may have done his\r\ndue part in preserving the memorials of Antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING FORTY-FOUR LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS IN THE NAME OF\r\nTHEODORIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KING THEODORIC TO THE KING OF THE VANDALS[370].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: No doubt Thrasamund, who married Theodoric's sister. He\r\nreigned from 496 to 523.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King of the Vandals is thanked for his presents.]\r\n\r\n'The swords which you have sent us are most beautiful: so sharp that\r\nthey will cut other weapons; so bright that they reflect with a sort\r\nof iron light[371] the face of the beholder; with the two blades\r\ndescending to their edges with such absolute equality of slope, that\r\nyou would fancy them the result of the furnace rather than of the\r\nwhetstone[372]; in the middle, between the blades, channels carved\r\nwhich are filled in with beautiful enamel of various colours[373].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: 'Ut speculum quoddam virorum faciat ferream lucem.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: 'Quarum margines in acutum tali aequalitate descendunt,\r\nut non limis compositae, sed igneis fornacibus credantur effusae.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: 'Harum media pulchris alveis excavata, quibusdam\r\nvidentur crispari posse vermiculis, ubi tanta varietatis umbra\r\nconcludit, ut intextum magis credas variis coloribus lucidum\r\nmetallum.']\r\n\r\n'Along with these arms you have also sent us musical instruments of\r\nebony, and slave boys of beautiful whiteness.\r\n\r\n'We thank you heartily, send by A and B, our ambassadors, presents of\r\nequal value; and hope that mutual concord will always unite our\r\nStates.'\r\n\r\n\r\n2. KING THEODORIC TO THE HAESTI.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Haesti, dwellers by the Baltic. Their present of\r\namber.]\r\n\r\n[These are the Aestii of Tacitus, dwelling in or on the south border\r\nof the country which is still called Esthonia. Tacitus also mentions\r\ntheir quest of amber[374].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: Germ. 45: 'Ergo jam dextro Suevici maris litore\r\nAestiorum gentes alluuntur, quibus ritus habitusque Suevorum, lingua\r\nBritannicae propior.... Sed et mare scrutantur ac soli omnium sucinum\r\nquod ipsi glesum vocant, inter vada atque in ipso littore legunt.'\r\nThen follows an account of the nature of amber, and a history of its\r\nsupposed origin, from which Cassiodorus has borrowed in this letter.]\r\n\r\n'It is gratifying to us to know that you have heard of our fame, and\r\nhave sent ambassadors who have pressed through so many strange nations\r\nto seek our friendship.\r\n\r\n'We have received the amber which you have sent us. You say that you\r\ngather this lightest of all substances from the shores of the ocean,\r\nbut how it comes thither you know not. But, as an author named\r\nCornelius [Tacitus] informs us, it is gathered in the innermost\r\nislands of the ocean, being formed originally of the juice of a tree\r\n(whence its name _succinum_[375]), and gradually hardened by the heat\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: Cassiodorus apparently spells this word with two c's.\r\nThe more usual spelling is with one.]\r\n\r\n'Thus it becomes an exuded metal, a transparent softness, sometimes\r\nblushing with the colour of saffron, sometimes glowing with flame-like\r\nclearness[376]. Then, gliding down to the margin of the sea, and\r\nfurther purified by the rolling of the tides, it is at length\r\ntransported to your shores to be cast up upon them. We have thought it\r\nbetter to point this out to you, lest you should imagine that your\r\nsupposed secrets have escaped our knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: 'Modo croceo colore rubens, modo flammea claritate\r\npinguescens.']\r\n\r\n'We send you some presents by our ambassadors, and shall be glad to\r\nreceive further visits from you by the road which you have thus opened\r\nup, and to show you future favours.'\r\n\r\n[The collection of amber is also noticed by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.' 37.\r\n2). It is interesting to observe that he there, on the authority of\r\nPytheas, attributes to the Guttones dwelling on the Baltic shore the\r\ncollection of amber, and its sale to the Teutones. These Guttones\r\nwere, if we are right in accepting Jordanes' account of the Gothic\r\nmigrations, themselves ancestors of the Ostrogoths.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. KING THEODORIC TO HONORATUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, QUAESTOR.\r\n\r\n4. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honoratus, brother of Decoratus, is made Quaestor.]\r\n\r\nThe usual pair of letters on the promotion of Honoratus to the\r\nQuaestorship. He succeeds his brother Decoratus, whose early death\r\nTheodoric regrets. The date of the letters is the Third Indiction,\r\nSeptember 1, 509.\r\n\r\nThe writer remarks on the prophetic instinct[377] of the parents, who\r\nnamed these two sons, destined to future eminence, Decoratus and\r\nHonoratus. Decoratus was originally an advocate at Rome. His services\r\nwere often sought by men of Consular rank, and before his admission to\r\nthe Senate he had had a Patrician for his client in a very celebrated\r\ncase[378].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: We have here a remark on unconscious prophecies: 'Loqui\r\ndatur quod nos sensisse nescimus: sed post casum reminiscimur, quod\r\nignorantes veraciter dixeramus.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: 'Inferior gradu praestabat viris consularibus se\r\npatronum et cum honoribus vestris impar haberetur, Patricius ei dictus\r\nest in celeberrima cognitione susceptus.' The last part of this\r\nsentence is very obscure.]\r\n\r\nWhen he became Quaestor he distinguished himself by his excellent\r\nqualities. 'He stood beside us, under the light of our Genius, bold\r\nbut reverent; silent at the right time, fluent when there was need of\r\nfluency. He kept our secrets as if he had forgotten them; he\r\nremembered every detail of our orders as if he had written them down.\r\nThus was he ever an eminent lightener of our labours[379].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: Decoratus is called by Boethius, who was his colleague\r\nin some office, 'a wretched buffoon and informer' (nequissimus scurra\r\net delator. Cons. Phil. iii. 4). But Ennodius addresses him in\r\nfriendly and cordial language (Epist. iv. 17). His epitaph, which\r\nmentions his Spoletan origin, is of course laudatory:\r\n\r\n    'Nam fessis tribuit requiem, miseros que levavit,\r\n    Justitiae cultor, largus et hospes erat.'\r\n\r\n(Quoted in the notes to Ennodius in Migne's Patrologia.)]\r\n\r\nThe past career of the younger brother, Honoratus, who has been\r\nadvocate at Spoleto, and has had to contend with the corrupt\r\ntendencies of Provincial judges, full of their little importance, and\r\nremoved from the wholesome control which the opinion of the Senate\r\nexercised upon them at Rome, is then sketched; and the hope is\r\nexpressed that, in the words of the Virgilian quotation[380], this\r\nbough upon the family tree will be found as goodly as that which it\r\nhas untimely lost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: 'Primo avulso non deficit alter' (Aen. vi. 143).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duties of the Quaestorship.]\r\n\r\nThe letter to the Senate has an interesting passage on the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the Quaestor.\r\n\r\n'It is only men whom we consider to be of the highest learning that we\r\nraise to the dignity of the Quaestorship, such men as are fitted to be\r\ninterpreters of the laws and sharers of our counsels. This is an\r\nhonour which neither riches nor high birth by itself can procure, only\r\nlearning joined with prudence. In granting all other dignities we\r\nconfer favours, but from the holder of this we ever receive them. He\r\nis favoured to have a share in our anxieties; he enters in by the\r\ndoor of our thoughts; he is intimately acquainted with the breast in\r\nwhich the cares of the whole State are weighed. Think what judgment\r\nyou ought to form of a man who is partaker of such a confidence. From\r\nhim we require skill in the laws; to him flow together all the prayers\r\nof all suitors, and (a thing more precious than any treasure) to him\r\nis committed our own reputation for _civilitas_. Under a just Quaestor\r\nthe mind of an innocent man is at rest: only the wicked become anxious\r\nas to the success of their evil designs; and thus the bad lose their\r\nhope of plunder, while more earnestness is shown in the practice of\r\nvirtue. It is his to safeguard the just rights of all men: temperate\r\nin expenditure, lavish in his zeal for justice, incapable of\r\ndeception, prompt in succour. He serves that Sovereign mind before\r\nwhich all bow: through his lips must he speak who has not an equal in\r\nthe land.'\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING THEODORIC TO THE SAJO MANNILA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuses of the Cursus Publicus.]\r\n\r\nRepeats the injunctions given in Letter iv. 47 against improper use of\r\nthe public post-horses, and overloading of the extra horses. The fines\r\nimposed are the same as in that letter [with the addition of a fine of\r\ntwo ounces of gold (about £6 10s.) for overloading]; the examples from\r\nNatural History are similar. 'The very bird when weighted with a load\r\nflies slowly. Ships though they cannot feel their toils, yet move\r\ntardily when they are filled with cargo. What can the poor quadruped\r\ndo when pressed by too great burden? It succumbs.'\r\n\r\nBut apparently this rule against overloading is not to apply to\r\nPraepositi (Provincial Governors?), since 'reverenda antiquitas' has\r\ngiven them special rights over the _Cursus Publicus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING THEODORIC TO STABULARIUS, COMITIACUS[381].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: Officer of the Court. See vi. 13.]\r\n\r\n7. KING THEODORIC TO JOANNES, VIR CLARISSIMUS, ARCARIUS [TREASURER].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Default in payments to Treasury made by Thomas. His\r\nproperty assigned to his son-in-law Joannes.]\r\n\r\n'The _Vir Honestus_, Thomas, has long been a defaulter (reliquator) in\r\nrespect of the Indictions payable for certain farms which he has held\r\nunder the King's house in Apulia[382], and this default has now\r\nreached the sum of 10,000 solidi (£6,000). Repeatedly summoned to pay,\r\nhe always procrastinates, and we can get no satisfaction out of him.\r\nThe petition of Joannes, who is son-in-law to Thomas, informs us that\r\nhe is willing to pay the 10,000 solidi due, if we will make over to\r\nhim the said farms, and all the property of his father-in-law. This we\r\ntherefore now do, reserving to Thomas the right to pay the debt at any\r\ntime before the next Kalends of September, and thus to redeem his\r\nproperty. Failing such payment, the property is to pass finally into\r\nthe hands of Joannes, on his paying the 10,000 solidi to the\r\nIllustrious Count of the Patrimony [possibly Stabularius].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: 'Thomatem domus nostrae certa praedia suscepisse sed\r\neum male administrando suscepta usque ad decem millia solidorum de\r\nIndictionibus illa atque illa reliquatorem publicis rationibus\r\nextitisse.' It is not quite clear whether the debt is due as what we\r\nshould call rent or as land-tax. Perhaps the debt had accumulated\r\nunder both heads.]\r\n\r\n'It may be some little consolation to Thomas to reflect that after all\r\nit is his son-in-law who enters into possession of his goods.'\r\n\r\n[Dahn ('Könige der Germanen' iii. 277) remarks on this letter: 'But\r\neven the well-meaning Theodoric takes steps in the interests of\r\nsubstantial justice which from a juristic point of view it would be\r\nhard to justify.... Evidently here the King, in his consideration of\r\nwhat was practically just, has decided according to caprice, not\r\naccording to right; for the Fiscus could strictly only be repaid its\r\ndebt out of the property of the defaulter, and hold the Arcarius\r\n(Joannes) responsible for the balance' (for which Dahn thinks he had\r\nalready made himself liable). I do not quite agree with this view. It\r\nseems to me that Thomas was hopelessly bankrupt (the debt was 10,000\r\nsolidi, not 1,000, as stated by Dahn), and the Fiscus virtually sells\r\nthe bankrupt's estate to his son-in-law, for him to make of it what he\r\ncan.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KING THEODORIC TO ANASTASIUS THE CONSULAR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transport of marble from Faenza to Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n'We rely upon your Sublimity's zeal and prudence to see that the\r\nrequired blocks of marble are forwarded from Faventia (Faenza) to\r\nRavenna, without any extortion from private individuals; so that, on\r\nthe one hand, our desire for the adornment of that city may be\r\ngratified, and on the other, there may be no cause for complaint on\r\nthe part of our subjects.'\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING THEODORIC TO THE POSSESSORES OF FELTRIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New city to be built in district of Trient.]\r\n\r\n'We have ordered the erection of a new city in the territory of\r\nTridentum (Trient). As the work is great and the inhabitants few, we\r\norder you all to assist and build each your appointed length\r\n(pedatura) of wall, for which you will receive suitable pay.'\r\n\r\n[This use of the word _pedatura_ is found in Vegetius, 'Epitoma Rei\r\nMilitaris' iii. 8, and is illustrated by the centurial stones on the\r\ntwo great Roman walls in Britain, recording the number of feet\r\naccomplished by each century of soldiers (See 'Archaeologia Aeliana,'\r\nvol. ix. p. 28; paper by Mr. Clayton).]\r\n\r\n'None, not even the servants of the royal house (divina domus), are\r\nexcepted from this order.'\r\n\r\n\r\n10. KING THEODORIC TO THE SAJO VERANUS.\r\n\r\n11. KING THEODORIC TO THE GEPIDAE, ON THEIR MARCH TO GAUL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Payment to Gepidae on their march to Gaul.]\r\n\r\n'We desire that our soldiers should always be well paid, and that they\r\nshould never become the terror of the country which they are ordered\r\nto defend. Do you therefore, Sajo Veranus, cause the Gepid troops whom\r\nwe have ordered to come to the defence of Gaul, to march in all peace\r\nand quietness through Venetia and Liguria.\r\n\r\n'You Gepidae shall receive three solidi (£1 16s.) per week; and we\r\ntrust that thus supplied you will everywhere buy your provisions, and\r\nnot take them by force.\r\n\r\n'We generally give the soldiers their pay in kind, but in this case,\r\nfor obvious reasons, we think it better to pay them in money, and let\r\nthem buy for themselves.\r\n\r\n'If their waggons are becoming shaky with the long journey, or their\r\nbeasts of burden weary, let them exchange for sound waggons and fresh\r\nbeasts with the inhabitants of the country, but on such terms that the\r\nlatter shall not regret the transaction.'\r\n\r\n[Does this payment of three solidi mean per head? That would be an\r\nenormously high rate of pay. Sartorius (p. 289) feels the difficulty\r\nso strongly that he suggests that this was the pay given to the whole\r\ntroop, whose number was not large; but 'multitudo' seems hostile to\r\nthis hypothesis[383]. Possibly the high cost of provisions in the\r\nAlpine mountain-country may help to explain this unheard-of rate of\r\npay to common soldiers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: 'Ut multitudinem Gepidarum quam fecimus ad Gallias\r\ncustodiae causâ properare, per Venetiam atque Liguriam sub omni facias\r\nmoderatione transire.']\r\n\r\n\r\n12. KING THEODORIC TO THEODAHAD, VIR ILLUSTRIS [NEPHEW OF THE KING].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Avarice and injustice of Theodahad.]\r\n\r\n'If all are bound to seek justice and to avoid ignoble gains, most\r\nespecially are they thus bound who pride themselves on their close\r\nrelationship to us.\r\n\r\n'The heirs of the Illustrious Argolicus [probably the Praefect of\r\nRome] and the Clarissimus Amandianus complain that the estate[384] of\r\nPalentia, which we generously gave them to console them for the loss\r\nof the Casa Arbitana, has been by your servants, for no cause,\r\nunbecomingly invaded; and thus you, who should have shown an example\r\nof glorious moderation, have caused the scandal of high-handed\r\nspoliation. Wherefore, if this be true, let your Greatness at once\r\nrestore what has been taken away; and if you consider that you have\r\nany claims on the land, come and assert them in our Comitatus. Even\r\nsuccess yonder is injurious to your fame; but here, after full trial\r\nof the case and hearing of witnesses, no one will believe that any\r\ninjustice has been done if your cause should triumph.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: 'Massa;' cf. the American 'block.']\r\n\r\n[The republication of this letter at the close of his official life\r\nshows what was Cassiodorus' opinion of Theodahad, though he had served\r\nunder him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING THEODORIC TO EUTROPIUS AND ACRETIUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commissariat.]\r\n\r\n'We rely upon you to collect the prescribed rations and deliver them\r\nto the soldiers. It is most important that they should be regularly\r\nsupplied, and that there should be no excuse for pillage, so hard to\r\ncheck when once an army has begun to practise it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING THEODORIC TO SEVERI(A)NUS[385], VIR ILLUSTRIS (514-515).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: In the next letter the same official is called\r\nSeverinus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial abuses in Suavia.]\r\n\r\n'We send you to redress the long-standing grievances of the\r\nPossessores of the Province of Suavia, to which we have not yet been\r\nable to apply a remedy.\r\n\r\n'(1) It appears that some of the chief Possessores are actually making\r\na profit out of the taxes, imposing heavy burdens on their poorer\r\nneighbours and not honestly accounting for the receipts to us. See\r\nthat this is put right, that the land-tax (assis[386] publicus) is\r\nfairly and equitably reimposed according to the ability of each\r\nPossessor, and that those who have been oppressing their neighbours\r\nheal the wounds which they have made.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: Cassiodorus uses the rare nominative form 'assis.']\r\n\r\n'(2) See also that a strict account is rendered by all Defensores,\r\nCuriales, and Possessores of any receipts on behalf of the public\r\nTreasury. If a Possessor can show that he paid his tax (tributarius\r\nsolidus) for the now expired eighth Indiction (A.D. 514-515), and the\r\nmoney has not reached our Treasury, find out the defaulter and punish\r\nhis crime.\r\n\r\n'(3) Similarly with sums disbursed by one of the clerks of our\r\nTreasury[387], for the relief of the Province, which have not reached\r\ntheir destination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: 'Tabularius a cubiculo nostro.']\r\n\r\n'(4) Men who were formerly Barbarians[388], who have married Roman\r\nwives and acquired property in land, are to be compelled to pay their\r\nIndictions and other taxes to the public Treasury just like any other\r\nProvincials.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: 'Antiqui Barbari qui Romanis mulieribus elegerint\r\nnuptiali foedere sociari, quolibet titulo praedia quaesiverint, fiscum\r\npossessi cespitis persolvere, ac super indictitiis oneribus parere\r\ncogantur.']\r\n\r\n'(5) Judges are to visit each town (municipium) once in the year, and\r\nare not entitled to claim from such towns more than three days'\r\nmaintenance. Our ancestors wished that the circuits of the Judges\r\nshould be a benefit, not a burden, to the Provincials.\r\n\r\n'(6) It is alleged that some of the servants of the Count of the Goths\r\nand of the Vice-dominus (?) have levied black-mail on some of the\r\nProvincials. Property so taken must be at once restored and the\r\noffenders punished.\r\n\r\n'(7) Enter all your proceedings under this commission in official\r\nregisters (polyptycha), both for your own protection and for the sake\r\nof future reference, to prevent the recurrence of similar abuses.'\r\n\r\n[A long and interesting letter, but with some obscure passages.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE POSSESSORES IN SUAVIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\n'Although our Comitatus is always ready to redress the grievances of\r\nour subjects, yet, on account of the length of the journey from your\r\nProvince hither, we have thought good to send the Illustrious and\r\nMagnificent Severinus to you to enquire into your complaints on the\r\nspot. He is a man fully imbued with our own principles of government,\r\nand he has seen how greatly we have at heart the administration of\r\njustice. We therefore doubt not that he will soon put right whatever\r\nhas been done wrong in your Province; and we have published our\r\n\"oracles\" [the previous letter, containing Severinus' patent of\r\nappointment], that all may know upon what principles he is to act, and\r\nthat those who have grievances against the present functionaries may\r\nlearn their rights.'\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING THEODORIC TO ABUNDANTIUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formation of a navy.]\r\n\r\n'By Divine inspiration we have determined to raise a navy which may\r\nboth ensure the arrival of the cargoes of public corn and may, if\r\nneed be, combat the ships of an enemy. For, that Italy, a country\r\nabounding in timber, should not have a navy of her own hath often\r\nstricken us with regret.\r\n\r\n'Let your Greatness therefore give directions for the construction of\r\n1,000 _dromones_ (swift cutters). Wherever cypresses and pines are\r\nfound near to the sea-shore, let them be bought at a suitable price.\r\n\r\n'Then as to the levy of sailors: any fitting man, if a slave, must be\r\nhired of his master, or bought at a reasonable price. If free, he is\r\nto receive 5 solidi (£3) as donative, and will have his rations during\r\nthe term of service.\r\n\r\n'Even those who were slaves are to be treated in the same way, \"since\r\nit is a kind of freedom to serve the Ruler of the State[389];\" and are\r\nto receive, according to their condition, two or three solidi (£1 4s.\r\nor £1 16s.) of bounty money[390].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: 'Quando libertatis genus est servire Rectori.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: 'Arrharum nomine.']\r\n\r\n'Fishermen, however, are not to be enlisted in this force, since we\r\nlose with regret one whose vocation it is to provide us with luxuries;\r\nand moreover one kind of training is required for him who has to face\r\nthe stormy wind, and another for him who need only fish close to\r\nshore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KING THEODORIC TO ABUNDANTIUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We praise you for your prompt fulfilment of the orders contained in\r\nthe previous letter. You have built a fleet almost as quickly as\r\nordinary men would sail one. The model of the triremes, revealing the\r\nnumber of the rowers but concealing their faces, was first furnished\r\nby the Argonauts. So too the sail, that flying sheet[391] which wafts\r\nidle men to their destination quicker than swiftest birds can fly,\r\nwas first invented by the lorn Isis, when she set off on her\r\nwanderings through the world to find her lost son Apochran.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: 'Linum volatile.']\r\n\r\n'Now that we have our fleet, there is no need for the Greek to fasten\r\na quarrel upon us, or for the African [the Vandal] to insult us[392].\r\nWith envy they see that we have now stolen from them the secret of\r\ntheir strength.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: 'Non habet quod nobis Graecus imputet aut Afer\r\ninsultet.']\r\n\r\n'Let all the fleet be assembled at Ravenna on the next Ides of June.\r\nLet our own Padus send his home-born navy to the sea, his\r\nriver-nurtured firs to battle with the winds of Ocean.\r\n\r\n'But there is one suggestion of yours of great importance, and which\r\nmust be diligently acted upon, namely the removal of the nets whereby\r\nthe fishermen at present impede the channels of the following rivers:\r\nMincius, Ollius (Oglio), Anser (Serchio), Arno, Tiber. Let the river\r\nlie open for the transit of ships; let it suffice for the appetite of\r\nman to seek for delicacies in the ordinary way, not by rustic artifice\r\nto hinder the freedom of the stream.'\r\n\r\n\r\n18. KING THEODORIC TO UVILIAS [WILLIAS?], VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COUNT OF\r\nTHE PATRIMONY.\r\n\r\n19. KING THEODORIC TO GUDINAND, A SAJO.\r\n\r\n20. KING THEODORIC TO AVILF, A SAJO.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the same subject.]\r\n\r\nThese three letters all relate to the same subject as the two\r\npreceding ones--the formation of a navy, and the _rendezvous_ of ships\r\nand sailors at Ravenna on the Ides of June.\r\n\r\nThe Count of the Patrimony is courteously requested to see if there is\r\nany timber suitable for the purposes of the navy, growing in the royal\r\nestates along the banks of the Po.\r\n\r\nThe Sajones are ordered in more brusque and peremptory fashion:\r\nGudinand to collect the sailors at Ravenna on the appointed day; and\r\nAvilf to collect timber along the banks of the Po, with as little\r\ninjury to the Possessors as possible (not, however, apparently paying\r\nthem anything for it), to keep his hands clean from extortion and\r\nfraud, and to pull up the stake-nets in the channels of the five\r\nrivers mentioned in Letter 17; 'for we all know that men ought to fish\r\nwith nets, not with hedges, and the opposite practice shows detestable\r\ngreediness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n21. KING THEODORIC TO CAPUANUS, SENATOR.\r\n\r\n22. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capuanus appointed Rector Decuriarum.]\r\n\r\n[On the appointment of Capuanus to the office of Rector of the Guilds\r\n(Rector Decuriarum). The Guilds (Decuriae) of the City of Rome--not to\r\nbe confounded with the Provincial _Curiae_, membership in which was at\r\nthis time a burden rather than an advantage--enjoyed several special\r\nprivileges. We find from the Theodosian Code, Lib. xiv. Tit. 1, that\r\nthere were Decuriae of the _Librarii_, _Fiscales_, _Censuales_. The\r\n_Decuria Scribarum_ is perhaps the same as the _Decuria Librariorum_.\r\nI use the word Guilds, which seems best to describe a body of this\r\nkind; but it will be seen from their names that these Guilds are not\r\nof a commercial character, but are rather concerned with the\r\nadministration of justice. Some of them must have discharged the\r\nduties of attorneys, others of Inland Revenue officers, others acted\r\nas clerks to register the proceedings of the Senate, others performed\r\nthe mere mechanical work of copying, which is now undertaken by a law\r\nstationer.\r\n\r\nIt was ordained by a law of Constantius and Julian (357) that no one\r\nshould enter the first class in these Decuriae[393] unless he were a\r\ntrained and practised literary man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: 'Locum primi ordinis.']\r\n\r\nThe office which in the Theodosian Code is called _Judex Decuriarum_\r\nseems here to be called _Rector_.]\r\n\r\nThe young Capuanus has distinguished himself as a advocate both before\r\nthe Senate and other tribunals. There has been a certain diffidence\r\nand hesitation in his manner, especially when he was dealing with\r\ncommon subjects; but he always warmed with his peroration, and the\r\nsame man who even stammered in discussing some trifling detail became\r\nfluent, nay eloquent, when the graver interests of his client were at\r\nstake. When he saw that the Judge was against him he did not lose\r\nheart, but, by praising his justice and impartiality, gradually coaxed\r\nhim into a more favourable mood. On one memorable occasion, when a\r\ncertain document was produced which appeared hostile, he boldly\r\nchallenged the accuracy of the copy [made probably by one of the\r\n_Decuria Librariorum_] and insisted on seeing the original. This young\r\nadvocate is now appointed _Rector Decuriarum_, and thus accorded the\r\nprivilege of seniority over many men who are much older than himself.\r\nHe is exhorted to treat them with all courtesy, to remember the\r\nimportance of accuracy and fidelity in the execution of his duties and\r\nthose of the _Decuriales_ under him, on whose correct transcription of\r\ndocuments the property, the liberty, nay even the life of their\r\nfellow-subjects may depend. Especially he is exhorted to remember his\r\nown challenge of the accuracy of a copied document, that he may not\r\never find that memorable oration of his brought up against himself.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is exhorted to give the young official a kindly welcome. It\r\nwill now devolve upon him to report with praiseworthy accuracy the\r\nproceedings of that body, the most celebrated in the whole world. He\r\nwho has often pleaded before them the cause of the humble and weak,\r\nwill now have to introduce Consulars to their assembly. It is expected\r\nthat his eloquence will grow and his stammer will disappear, now that\r\nhe is clothed with a more dignified office. 'Freedom nourishes words,\r\nbut fear frequently interrupts their plenteous flow.'\r\n\r\n\r\n23. KING THEODORIC TO ABUNDANTIUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Archery drill.]\r\n\r\n'Tata the Sajo is ordered to proceed to the Illustrious Count Julian,\r\nwith the young archers whom he has drilled, that they may practise on\r\nthe field the lessons which they have learned in the gymnasium. Let\r\nyour Greatness provide them with rations and ships according to\r\ncustom.' [The place to which this expedition was directed does not\r\nseem to be stated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATOR EPIPHANIUS, CONSULARIS OF DALMATIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Property of a widow dying intestate and without heirs to be\r\nclaimed for the State.]\r\n\r\n'We are informed that Joanna, the wife of Andreas, having succeeded to\r\nher husband's estate, has died intestate without heirs. Her property\r\nought therefore to lapse to our Treasury[394], but it is being\r\nappropriated, so we are informed, by divers persons who have no claim\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: 'Quia caduca bona fisco nostro competere legum cauta\r\ndecreverunt.']\r\n\r\n'Enquire into this matter; and if it be as we are informed, reclaim\r\nfor our Treasury so legitimate a possession. We should consider\r\nourselves guilty of negligence if we omitted to take possession of\r\nthat which, without harming anyone, so obviously comes in to lighten\r\nthe public burdens.\r\n\r\n'But if you find the facts different to these, by all means leave the\r\npresent owners in quiet possession. The secure enjoyment by our\r\nsubjects of that which is lawfully theirs we hold to be our truest\r\npatrimony.'\r\n\r\n\r\n25. KING THEODORIC TO BACAUDA[395], VIR SUBLIMIS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: The name is a peculiar one, reminding us of the\r\nBacaudae, who for more than a century waged a sort of servile war in\r\nGaul against the officers of the Empire. It is not probable, however,\r\nthat there is any real connection between them and the receiver of\r\nthis letter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacauda receives the office of Tribunus Voluptatum for\r\nlife.]\r\n\r\n'By way of support for your declining years we appoint you, for life,\r\n_Tribunus Voluptatum_ [Minister of Public Amusement] at Milan.\r\n\r\n'It is a new principle in the public service[396] to give any man a\r\nlife-tenure of his office; but you will now not have to fear the\r\ninterference of any successor, and your mind being at ease about your\r\nown future, you will be able to minister to the pleasures of the\r\npeople with a smiling face.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: 'Quod est in Reipublicae _militiâ_ novum.' Observe the\r\nuse of militia for civil service.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26. KING THEODORIC TO ALL THE GOTHS SETTLED IN PICENUM AND SAMNIUM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Goths summoned to the royal presence.]\r\n\r\n'The presence of the Sovereign doubles the sweetness of his gifts, and\r\nthat man is like one dead whose face is not known to his lord[397].\r\nCome therefore by God's assistance, come all into our presence on the\r\neighth day before the Ides of June (June 6th), there solemnly to\r\nreceive our royal largesse. But let there be no excesses by the way,\r\nno plundering the harvest of the cultivators nor trampling down their\r\nmeadows, since for this cause do we gladly defray the expense of our\r\narmies that _civilitas_ may be kept intact by armed men.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: 'Nam pene similis est mortuo qui a suo Dominante\r\nnescitur.' A motto more suited to the presence-chamber of Byzantium\r\nthan the camp-fires of a Gothic King.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. KING THEODORIC TO GUDUIM, SAJO.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same.]\r\n\r\n'Order all the captains of thousands[398] of Picenum and Samnium to\r\ncome to our Court, that we may bestow the wonted largesse on our\r\nGoths. We enquire diligently into the deeds of each of our soldiers,\r\nthat none may lose the credit of any exploit which he has performed in\r\nthe field. On the other hand, let the coward tremble at the thought of\r\ncoming into our presence. Even this fear may hereafter make him brave\r\nagainst the enemy.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: 'Millenarii.' Cf. the [Greek: chiliarchoi], who, as\r\nProcopius tells us, were appointed by Gaiseric over the Vandals; also\r\nthe _thusundifaths_ of Ulfilas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. KING THEODORIC TO CARINUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invitation to Court.]\r\n\r\n'Granting your request, and also satisfying our own desire for your\r\ncompanionship, we invite you to our Court.'\r\n\r\n\r\n29. KING THEODORIC TO NEUDES, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A blind Gothic warrior enslaved.]\r\n\r\n'Our pity is greatly moved by the petition of Ocer, a blind Goth, who\r\nhas come by the help of borrowed sight to _feel_ the sweetness of our\r\nclemency, though he cannot see our presence.\r\n\r\n'He asserts that he, a free Goth, who once followed our armies, has,\r\nowing to his misfortune, been reduced to slavery by Gudila and Oppas.\r\nStrange excess of impudence to make that man their servant, before\r\nwhose sword they had assuredly trembled had he possessed his eyesight!\r\nHe pleads that Count Pythias has already pronounced against the claims\r\nof his pretended masters. If you find that this is so, restore him at\r\nonce to freedom, and warn those men not to dare to repeat their\r\noppression of the unfortunate.'\r\n\r\n\r\n30. KING THEODORIC TO GUDUI[M], VIR SUBLIMIS [AND DUX].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Servile tasks imposed on free Goths by a Duke.]\r\n\r\n'We expect those whom we choose as Dukes to work righteousness.\r\nCostula and Daila, men who by the blessing of God rejoice in the\r\nfreedom of our Goths, complain that servile tasks are imposed upon\r\nthem by you. We do not do this ourselves, nor will we allow anyone\r\nelse to do it. If you find that the grievance is correctly stated\r\nrectify it at once, or our anger will turn against the Duke who thus\r\nabuses his power.'\r\n\r\n\r\n31. KING THEODORIC TO DECORATUS, VIR DEVOTUS (?).\r\n\r\n[For the career of Decoratus see v. 3 and 4.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrears of Siliquaticum to be enforced.]\r\n\r\n'Thomas, Vir Clarissimus, complains that he cannot collect the arrears\r\nof Siliquaticum from certain persons in Apulia and Calabria.\r\n\r\n'Do you therefore summon Mark the Presbyter, Andreas, Simeonius, and\r\nthe others whose names are set forth in the accompanying schedule, to\r\ncome into your presence, using no unnecessary force[399] in your\r\nsummons. If they cannot clear themselves of this debt to the public\r\nTreasury, they must be forced to pay.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: 'Servata in omnibus civilitate.']\r\n\r\n[The arrears are said to be for the 8th, 9th, 11th, 1st, 2nd, and 15th\r\nIndictiones; i.e. probably for the years 500, 501, 503, 508, 509, 507.\r\nI cannot account for this curious order in which the years are\r\narranged, which seems to suggest some corruption of the text. Probably\r\nthis letter was written about 509.]\r\n\r\n\r\n32. KING THEODORIC TO BRANDILA (CIR. 508-9).\r\n\r\n[See remarks on this letter in Dahn ('Könige der Germanen' iv.\r\n149-152); he claims it as a proof that Gothic law still existed for\r\nthe Goths in Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault of the wife of Brandila on the wife of Patzenes.]\r\n\r\n'Times without number has Patzenes laid his complaint upon us, to wit\r\nthat while he was absent on the recent successful expedition[400] your\r\nwife Procula fell upon his wife [Regina], inflicted upon her three\r\nmurderous blows, and finally left her for dead, the victim having only\r\nescaped by the supposed impossibility of her living. Now therefore, if\r\nyou acknowledge the fact to be so, you are to consult your own honour\r\nby inflicting summary punishment as a husband on your wife, that we\r\nmay not hear of this complaint again[401]. But if you deny the fact,\r\nyou are to bring your said wife to our Comitatus and there prove her\r\ninnocence.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: Into Gaul; see next letter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: 'Atque ideo decretis te praesentibus admonemus, ut si\r\nfactum evidenter agnoscis, delatam querimoniam, pudori tuo consulens,\r\n_maritali districtione redarguas_; quatenus ex eâdem causâ ad nos\r\nquerela justa non redeat.']\r\n\r\n\r\n33. KING THEODORIC TO DUKE WILITANCH.\r\n\r\n[Containing the explanation of Procula's violence to Regina].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adulterous connection between Brandila and the wife of\r\nPatzenes.]\r\n\r\n'Patzenes brings before us a most serious complaint: that during his\r\nabsence in the Gaulish campaign, Brandila dared to form an adulterous\r\nconnection with his wife Regina, and to go through the form of\r\nmarriage with her.\r\n\r\n'Whose honour will be safe if advantage is thus to be taken with\r\nimpunity of the absense of a brave defender of his country? Alas for\r\nthe immodesty of women! They might learn virtue even from the chaste\r\nexample of the cooing turtle-dove, who when once deprived by\r\nmisfortune of her mate, never pairs again with another.\r\n\r\n'Let your Sublimity compel the parties accused to come before you for\r\nexamination, and if the charge be true, if these shameless ones were\r\nspeculating on the soldier of the Republic not returning from the\r\nwars, if they were hoping, as they must have hoped, for general\r\ncollapse and ruin in order to hide their shame, then proceed against\r\nthem as our laws against adulterers dictate[402], and thus vindicate\r\nthe rights of all husbands.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: 'Et rerum veritate discussâ _sicut jura nostra\r\npraecipiunt_, in adulteros maritorum favore resecetur.']\r\n\r\n[If these laws were, as is probable, those contained in the _Edictum\r\nTheodorici_, the punishment for both the guilty parties was death, §\r\n38, 39.]\r\n\r\n\r\n34. KING THEODORIC TO ABUNDANTIUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Endless evasions of Frontosus. The nature of the\r\nchameleon.]\r\n\r\n'Frontosus, acting worthily of his name [the shameless-browed one],\r\nconfessed to having embezzled a large sum of public money, but\r\npromised that, if a sufficient interval were allowed him, he would\r\nrepay it. Times without number has this interval expired and been\r\nrenewed, and still he does not pay. When he is arrested he trembles\r\nwith fear, and will promise anything; as soon as he is liberated he\r\nseems to forget every promise that he has made. He changes his words,\r\nlike the chameleon, that little creature which in the shape of a\r\nserpent is distinguished by a gold-coloured head, and has all the rest\r\nof its body of a pale green. This little beast when it meets the gaze\r\nof men, not being gifted with speed of flight, confused with its\r\nexcess of timidity, changes its colours in marvellous variety, now\r\nazure, now purple, now green, now dark blue. The chameleon, again, may\r\nbe compared to the Pandian gem [sapphire?], which flashes with all\r\nsorts of lights and colours while you hold it still in your hand.\r\n\r\n'Such then is the mind of Frontosus. He may be rightly compared to\r\nProteus, who when he was laid hold of, appeared in every shape but his\r\nown, roared as a lion, hissed as a serpent, or foamed away in watery\r\nwaves, all in order to conceal his true shape of man.\r\n\r\n'Since this is his character, when you arrest him, first stop his\r\nmouth from promising, for his facile nature is ready with all sorts of\r\npromises which he has no chance of performing. Then ascertain what he\r\ncan really pay at once, and keep him bound till he does it. He must\r\nnot be allowed to think that he can get the better of us with his\r\ntricks.'\r\n\r\n\r\n35. KING THEODORIC TO COUNT LUVIRIT, AND AMPELIUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fraudulent ship-owners to be punished.]\r\n\r\n'When we were in doubt about the food supply of Rome, we judged it\r\nproper that Spain should send her cargoes of wheat hither, and the Vir\r\nSpectabilis Marcian collected supplies there for this purpose. His\r\nindustry, however, was frustrated by the greed of the shipowners, who,\r\ndisliking the necessary delay, slipped off and disposed of the grain\r\nfor their own profit. Little as we like harshness, this offence must\r\nbe punished. We have therefore directed Catellus and Servandus (Viri\r\nStrenui) to collect from these shipmasters the sum of 1,038 solidi\r\n(£622 16s.), inasmuch as they appear to have received:\r\n\r\n'From the sale of the corn           280 solidi.\r\n'And from the fares of passengers    758   \"\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                  '1,038   \"\r\n\r\n'Let your Sublimity assist in the execution of this order.'\r\n\r\n\r\n36. KING THEODORIC TO STARCEDIUS, VIR SUBLIMIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honourable discharge.]\r\n\r\n'You tell us that your body, wearied out with continual labour, is no\r\nlonger equal to the fatigues of our glorious campaigns, and you\r\ntherefore ask to be released from the necessity of further military\r\nservice. We grant your request, but stop your donative; because it is\r\nnot right that you should consume the labourer's bread in idleness. We\r\nshall extend to you our protection from the snares of your\r\nadversaries, and allow no one to call you a deserter, since you are\r\nnot one[403].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: This is perhaps a specimen of the 'honesta missio' of\r\nwhich we read in the Theodosian Code xii. 1. 43, 45.]\r\n\r\n\r\n37. KING THEODORIC TO THE JEWS OF MILAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rights of the Jewish Synagogue not to be invaded by\r\nChristians.]\r\n\r\n'For the preservation of _civilitas_ the benefits of justice are not\r\nto be denied even to those who are recognised as wandering from the\r\nright way in matters of faith.\r\n\r\n'You complain that you are often wantonly attacked, and that the\r\nrights pertaining to your synagogue are disregarded[404]. We therefore\r\ngive you the needed protection of our Mildness, and ordain that no\r\necclesiastic shall trench on the privileges of your synagogue, nor mix\r\nhimself up in your affairs. But let the two communities keep apart, as\r\ntheir faiths are different: you on your part not attempting to do\r\nanything _incivile_ against the rights of the said Church.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: 'Nonnullorum vos frequenter causamini praesumptione\r\nlaceratos et quae ad synagogam vestram pertinent perhibetis jura\r\nrescindi.']\r\n\r\n'The law of thirty years' prescription, which is a world-wide\r\ncustom[405], shall enure for your benefit also.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: 'Tricennalis humano generi patrona praescriptio vobis\r\njure servabitur; nec conventionalia vos irrationabiliter praecipimus\r\nsustinere dispendia.' I do not know what is meant by 'conventionalia\r\ndispendia.']\r\n\r\n'But why, oh Jew, dost thou petition for peace and quietness on earth\r\nwhen thou canst not find that rest which is eternal[406]?'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: 'Sed quid, Judaeo, supplicans temporalem quietem\r\nquaeris si aeternam requiem invenire non possis.']\r\n\r\n\r\n38. KING THEODORIC TO ALL CULTIVATORS[407].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: 'Universis Possessoribus.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shrubs obstructing the aqueduct of Ravenna to be rooted\r\nup.]\r\n\r\n'The aqueducts are an object of our special care. We desire you at\r\nonce to root up the shrubs growing in the Signine Channel[408], which\r\nwill before long become big trees scarcely to be hewn down with the\r\naxe, and which interfere with the purity of the water in the aqueduct\r\nof Ravenna. Vegetation is the peaceable overturner of buildings, the\r\nbattering-ram which brings them to the ground, though the trumpets\r\nnever sound for siege.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: Where was this? Signia in Latium is, of course, not to\r\nbe thought of.]\r\n\r\n'We shall now again have baths that we may look upon with pleasure;\r\nwater which will cleanse, not stain; water after using which we shall\r\nnot require to wash ourselves again; drinking-water such that the mere\r\nsight of it will not take away all our appetite for food[409].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: The scarcity of water at Ravenna was proverbial.]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. KING THEODORIC TO AMPELIUS AND LIVERIA[410].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: Cf. the somewhat similar letter to Severinus, Special\r\nCommissioner for Suavia (v. 14).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sundry abuses in the administration of the Spanish\r\ngovernment to be rectified.]\r\n\r\n'That alone is the true life of men which is controlled by the reign\r\nof law.\r\n\r\n'We regret to hear that through the capricious extortions of our\r\nrevenue-officers anarchy is practically prevailing in Spain. The\r\npublic registers (polyptycha), not the whim of the collector, ought to\r\nmeasure the liability of the Provincial.\r\n\r\n'We therefore send your Sublimity to Spain in order to remedy these\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\n'(1) Murder must be put down with a strong hand; but the sharper the\r\npunishment is made the more rigid we ought to be in requiring proof of\r\nthe crime[411].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: 'Homicidii scelus legum jubemus auctoritate resecari:\r\nsed quantum vehementior poena est tanto ejus rei debet inquisitio plus\r\nhaberi: ne amore vindictae innocentes videantur vitae pericula\r\nsustinere.']\r\n\r\n'(2) The collectors of the land-tax (assis publicus) are accused of\r\nusing false weights [in collecting the quotas of produce from the\r\nProvincials]. This must cease, and they must use none but the standard\r\nweights kept by our Chamberlain[412].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: 'Libra cubiculi nostri.']\r\n\r\n'(3) The farmers[413] of our Royal domain must pay the rent imposed on\r\nthem, otherwise they will get to look on the farms as their own\r\nproperty; but certain salaries may be paid them for their trouble, as\r\nyou shall think fit[414]. [Dahn suggests that the salary was to\r\nreimburse them for their labours as a kind of local police, but is\r\nnot himself satisfied with this explanation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: 'Conductores domus Regiae.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: 'Et ne cuiquam labor suus videatur ingratus, salaria\r\neis pro qualitate locatae rei, vestrâ volumus aequitate constitui.']\r\n\r\n'(4) Import duties[415] are to be regularly collected and honestly\r\npaid over.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: 'Transmarinorum canon.']\r\n\r\n'(5) The officers of the mint are not to make their private gains out\r\nof the coinage.'\r\n\r\n(6) An obscure sentence as to the 'Canon telonei' [from the Greek\r\n[Greek: telônês], a tax-gatherer. Garet reads 'Tolonei,' which is\r\nprobably an error].\r\n\r\n(7) The same as to the _Actus Laeti_, whose conscience is assailed by\r\nthe grossest imputations. [Laetus is perhaps the name of an official.]\r\n\r\n'(8) Those concerned in _furtivae actiones_, and their accomplices,\r\nare to disgorge the property thus acquired.\r\n\r\n'(9) Those who have received _praebendae_ [apparently official\r\nallowances charged on the Province] are, with detestable injustice,\r\nclaiming them _both_ in money and in kind. This must be put a stop to:\r\nof course the one mode of payment is meant to be alternative to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n'(10) The Exactores (Collectors) are said to be extorting from the\r\nProvincials more than they pay into our chamber (_cubiculum_). Let\r\nthis be carefully examined into, and let the payment exacted be the\r\nsame that was fixed in the times of Alaric and Euric.\r\n\r\n'(11) The abuse of claiming extortions (_paraveredi_) by those who\r\nhave a right to use the public posts must be repressed.\r\n\r\n'(12) The defence of the Provincials by the _Villici_ is so costly,\r\nand seems to be so unpopular, that we remove it altogether.' [For this\r\n_tuitio villici_, see Dahn iii. 131; but he is not able to throw much\r\nlight on the nature of the office of the _Villicus_.]\r\n\r\n'(13) Degrading services (servitia famulatus) are not to be claimed of\r\nour free-born Goths, although they may be residents in cities[416].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: Cf. the 30th letter of this book.]\r\n\r\n[This very long letter is one of great importance, but also of great\r\ndifficulty.]\r\n\r\n\r\n40. KING THEODORIC TO CYPRIAN, COUNT OF THE SACRED LARGESSES.\r\n\r\n[This Cyprian is the accuser of Albinus and Boethius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n41. KING THEODORIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[On Cyprian's appointment to the above office, 524.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotion of Cyprian to the Comitiva Sacrarum Largitionum.]\r\n\r\nThe usual pair of letters setting forth the merits of the new\r\nofficial. The Senate is congratulated on the fact that the King never\r\npresents to a place in that body a mere tyro in official life, but\r\nalways himself first tests the servants of the State, and rewards with\r\na place in the Senate only those who have shown themselves worthy of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCyprian is the son of a man of merit, Opilio, who in the times of the\r\nState's ill-fortune was chosen to a place in the royal household[417].\r\nHe was not able, owing to the wretchedness of the times, to do much\r\nfor his son. The difference between the fortunes of father and son is\r\nthe measure of the happy change introduced by the rule of Theodoric.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: 'Vir quidem abjectis temporibus ad excubias tamen\r\nPalatinas electus.' The time of Odovacar's government is here alluded\r\nto (see viii. 17). An Opilio, probably father of the one here\r\nmentioned, was Consul under Valentinian III in 453.]\r\n\r\nIn some subordinate capacity in the King's final Court of Appeal\r\n(probably as _Referendarius_[418]) Cyprian has hitherto had the duty\r\nof stating the cases of the hostile litigants. He has shown wonderful\r\ndexterity in suddenly stating the same case from the two opposite\r\npoints of view[419], and this so as to satisfy even the requirements\r\nof the litigants themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: Anonymus Valesii says: 'Cyprianus, qui tunc\r\nReferendarius erat postea Comes Sacrarum et Magister,' § 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: 'Nam cum oratoribus sit propositum diu tractata unius\r\npartis vota dicere, tibi semper necesse fuit repentinum negotium\r\nutroque latere declarare.']\r\n\r\nOften the King has transacted business in his rides which used of old\r\nto be brought before a formal Consistory. He has mounted his horse,\r\nwhen weary with the cares of the Republic, to renew his vigour by\r\nexercise and change of scene. In these rides he has been accompanied\r\nby Cyprian, who has in such a lively manner stated the cases which had\r\ncome up on appeal, that an otherwise tedious business was turned into\r\na pleasure. Even when the King was most moved to wrath by what seemed\r\nto him a thoroughly bad cause, he still appreciated the charm of the\r\nAdvocate's style in setting it before him. Thus has Cyprian had that\r\nmost useful of all trainings, action, not books.\r\n\r\nThus prepared he was sent on an embassy to the East, a commission\r\nwhich he discharged with conspicuous ability. Versed in three\r\nlanguages (Greek, Roman, Gothic?), he found that Greece had nothing to\r\nshow him that was new; and as for subtlety, he was a match for the\r\nkeenest of the Greeks. The Emperor's presence had nothing in it to\r\nmake him hesitating or confused. Why should it, since he had seen and\r\npleaded before Theodoric[420]?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: 'Talibus igitur institutis edoctus, Eoae sumpsisti\r\nlegationis officium, missus ad summae quidem peritiae viros: sed nulla\r\ninter eos confusus es trepidatione _quia nihil tibi post nos potuit\r\nesse mirabile_. Instructus enim trifariis linguis, non tibi Graecia\r\nquod novum ostentaret invenit; nec ipsâ quâ nimium praevalet, te\r\ntranscendit argutiâ.']\r\n\r\nIn addition to all these other gifts he possesses _faith_, that anchor\r\nof the soul amidst the waves of a stormy world.\r\n\r\nHe is therefore called upon to assume at the third Indiction [524-525]\r\nthe office of Count of the Sacred Largesses, and exhorted to bear\r\nhimself therein worthily of his parentage and his past career, that\r\nthe King may afterwards promote him to yet higher honour.\r\n\r\n[For further remarks on this letter--a very important one, as bearing\r\non the trial of Boethius--see viii. 16. The third Indiction might mean\r\neither 509-510 or 524-525; but the statement of 'Anomymus Valesii,'\r\nthat Cyprian was still only Referendarius at the time of his\r\naccusation of Albinus, warrants us in fixing on the later date. This\r\nmakes the encomiums conferred in this letter more significant, since\r\nthey must have been bestowed _after_ the delation against Albinus and\r\nBoethius. Probably it was during Cyprian's embassy to Constantinople\r\n(described in this letter) that he discovered these intrigues of the\r\nSenators with the Byzantine Court, which he denounced on his return.]\r\n\r\n\r\n42. KING THEODORIC TO MAXIMUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, CONSUL.\r\n\r\n[Flavius Anicius Maximus was Consul A.D. 523.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rewards to performers in the Amphitheatre.]\r\n\r\n'If singers and dancers are to be rewarded by the generosity of the\r\nConsul, _à fortiori_ should the _Venator_, the fighter with wild\r\nbeasts in the amphitheatre, be rewarded for _his_ endeavours to please\r\nthe people, who after all are secretly hoping to see him killed. And\r\nwhat a horrible death he dies--denied even the rites of burial,\r\ndisappearing before he has yet become a corpse into the maw of the\r\nhungry animal which he has failed to kill. These spectacles were first\r\nintroduced as part of the worship of the Scythian Diana, who was\r\nfeigned to gloat on human gore. The ancients called her the triple\r\ndeity, Proserpina-Luna-Diana. They were right in one point; the\r\ngoddess who invented these games certainly reigned _in hell_.'\r\n\r\nThe Colosseum (the Amphitheatre of Titus) is described.\r\n\r\nThe combats with wild beasts are pourtrayed in a style of pompous\r\nobscurity. We may dimly discern the form of the _bestiarius_, who is\r\narmed with a wooden spear; of another who leaps into the air to escape\r\nthe beast's onset; of one who protects himself with a portable wall of\r\nreeds, 'like a sea-urchin;' of others who are fastened to a revolving\r\nwheel, and alternately brought within the range of the animal's claws\r\nand borne aloft beyond his grasp. 'There are as many perilous forms of\r\nencounter as Virgil described varieties of crime and punishment in\r\nTartarus. Alas for the pitiable error of mankind! If they had any true\r\nintuition of Justice, they would sacrifice as much wealth for the\r\npreservation of human life as they now lavish on its destruction.' ['A\r\nnoble regret,' says Gregorovius ('Geschichte der Stadt Rom.' i. 286),\r\n'in which in our own day every well-disposed Minister of a military\r\nstate will feel bound to concur with Cassiodorus.']\r\n\r\n\r\n43. KING THEODORIC TO TRANSMUND [THRASAMUND], KING OF THE VANDALS\r\n(CIR. 511).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complains of the protection given by Thrasamund to\r\nGesalic.]\r\n\r\n'Having given you our sister, that singular ornament of the Amal race,\r\nin marriage, in order to knit the bonds of friendship between us, we\r\nare amazed that you should have given protection and support to our\r\nenemy Gesalic [natural son of Alaric II]. If it was out of mere pity\r\nand as an outcast that you received him into your realm, you ought to\r\nhave kept him there; whereas you have sent him forth furnished with\r\nlarge supplies of money to disturb the peace of our Gaulish Provinces.\r\nThis is not the conduct of a friend, much less of a relative. We are\r\nsure that you cannot have taken counsel in this matter with your wife,\r\nwho would neither have liked to see her brother injured, nor the fair\r\nfame of her husband tarnished by such doubtful intrigues. We send you\r\nA and B as our ambassadors, who will speak to you further on this\r\nmatter.'\r\n\r\n\r\n44. KING THEODORIC TO TRANSMUND [THRASAMUND], KING OF THE VANDALS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconciliation between Theodoric and Thrasamund.]\r\n\r\n'You have shown, most prudent of Kings, that wise men know how to\r\namend their faults, instead of persisting in them with that obstinacy\r\nwhich is the characteristic of brutes. In the noblest and most truly\r\nkinglike manner you have humbled yourself to confess your fault in\r\nreference to the reception of Gesalic, and to lay bare to us the very\r\nsecrets of your heart in this matter. We thank you and praise you, and\r\naccept your purgation of yourself from this offence with all our\r\nheart. As for the presents sent us by your ambassadors, we accept them\r\nwith our minds, but not with our hands. Let them return to your\r\nTreasury (cubiculum), that it may be seen that it was simply love of\r\njustice, not desire of gain, which prompted our complaints. We have\r\nboth acted in a truly royal manner[421]. Let your frankness and our\r\ncontempt of gold be celebrated through the nations. It is sweeter to\r\nus to return these presents to you, than to receive much larger ones\r\nfrom anyone else. Your ambassadors carry back with them the fullest\r\nsalutation of love from your friend and ally.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: 'Fecimus utrique regalia.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING TWENTY-FIVE FORMULAE[422].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: For the reasons which induced Cassiodorus to compile\r\nthe two books of Formulae, see his Preface (translated, p. 133).]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FORMULA OF THE CONSULSHIP.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consulship.]\r\n\r\n'In old days the supreme reward of the Consulship was given to him\r\nwho, by his strong right hand, had delivered the Republic. The mantle\r\nembroidered with palms of victory[423], the privilege of giving his\r\nname to the year and of enfranchising the slave, even power over the\r\nlives of his fellow-citizens, were rightly given to a man to whom the\r\nRepublic owed so much. He received the axe--the power of life and\r\ndeath--but bound up in the bundle of rods, in order that the necessary\r\ndelay in undoing these might prevent him from striking the irrevocable\r\nstroke without due consideration. Whence also he received the name of\r\nConsul, because it was his duty to _consult_ for the good of his\r\ncountry. He was bound to spend money freely; and thus he who had shed\r\nthe blood of the enemies of Rome made the lives of her children happy\r\nby his generosity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: 'Palmata vestis.']\r\n\r\n'But now take this office under happier circumstances, since we have\r\nthe labours of the Consul, you the joys of his dignity. Your\r\npalm-embroidered robes therefore are justified by our victories, and\r\nyou, in the prosperous hour of peace, confer freedom on the slave,\r\nbecause we by our wars are giving security to the Romans. Therefore,\r\nfor this Indiction, we decorate you with the ensigns of the\r\nConsulship.\r\n\r\n'Adorn your broad shoulders[424] with the variegated colours of the\r\npalm-robe; ennoble your strong hand with the sceptre of victory[425].\r\nEnter your private dwelling having even your sandals gilded; ascend\r\nthe curule chair by the many steps which its dignity requires: that\r\nthus you, a subject and at your ease, may enjoy the dignity which we,\r\nthe Ruler, assumed only after mightiest labours. You enjoy the fruit\r\nof victory who are ignorant of war; we, God helping us, will reign; we\r\nwill consult for the safety of the State, while your name marks the\r\nyear. You overtop Sovereigns in your good fortune, since you wear the\r\nhighest honours, and yet have not the annoyances of ruling. Wherefore\r\npluck up spirit and confidence. It becometh Consuls to be generous. Do\r\nnot be anxious about your private fortune, you who have elected to win\r\nthe public favour by your gifts. It is for this cause [because the\r\nConsul has to spend lavishly during his year of office] that we make a\r\ndifference between your dignity and all others. Other magistrates we\r\nappoint, even though they do not ask for the office. To the Consulship\r\nwe promote only those who are candidates for the dignity, those who\r\nknow that their fortunes are equal to its demands; otherwise we might\r\nbe imposing a burden rather than a favour. Enjoy therefore, in a\r\nbecoming manner, the honour which you wished for. This mode of\r\nspending money is a legitimate form of canvassing[426]. Be illustrious\r\nin the world, be prosperous in your own life, leave an example for the\r\nhappy imitation of your posterity.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: 'Pinge vastos humeros vario colore palmatae.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: 'Validam manum victoriali scipione nobilita.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: 'Hic est ambitus qui probatur;' or, 'allowable\r\nbribery.']\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FORMULA OF THE PATRICIATE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patriciate.]\r\n\r\n'In olden times the Patricians were said to derive their origin from\r\nJupiter, whose priests they were. Mythology apart, they derived their\r\nname from _Patres_, the dignity of priest having blended itself with\r\nthat of Senator.\r\n\r\n'The great distinction of the Patriciate is that it is a rank held\r\n_for life_, like that of the priesthood, from which it sprang. The\r\nPatrician takes precedence of Praefects and all other dignities save\r\none (the Consulship), and that is one which we ourselves sometimes\r\nassume.\r\n\r\n'Ascend then the pinnacle of the Patriciate. You may have yet further\r\nhonours to receive from us, if you bear yourself worthily in this\r\nstation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n3. FORMULA OF THE PRAETORIAN PRAEFECTURE.\r\n\r\n[On account of the importance of the office a translation of the whole\r\nformula is here attempted, though with some hesitation on account of\r\nits obscure allusions.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praetorian Praefecture.]\r\n\r\n'If the origin of any dignity can confer upon it special renown and\r\npromise of future usefulness, the Praetorian Praefecture may claim\r\nthis distinction, illustrated as its establishment was by the wisdom\r\nof this world, and also stamped by the Divine approval. For when\r\nPharaoh, King of Egypt, was oppressed by strange visions of future\r\nfamine, there was found a blessed man, even Joseph, able to foretell\r\nthe future with truth, and to suggest the wisest precautions for the\r\npeople's danger. He first consecrated the insignia of this dignity; he\r\nin majesty entered the official chariot[427], raised to this height of\r\nhonour, in order that his wisdom might confer blessings on the people\r\nwhich they could not receive from the mere power of the Ruler.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: 'Ipse carpentum reverendus ascendit.' The _carpentum_\r\nwas one great mark of the dignity of the Praetorian Praefect, as of\r\nhis inferior, the Praefectus Urbis.]\r\n\r\n'From that Patriarch is this officer now called _Father of the\r\nEmpire_; his name is even to-day celebrated by the voice of the crier,\r\nwho calls upon the Judge to show himself not unworthy of his example.\r\nRightly was it felt that he to whom such power was committed should\r\nalways be thus delicately reminded of his duty.\r\n\r\n'For some prerogatives are shared in common between ourselves and the\r\nholder of this dignity. [The next sentence[428] I leave untranslated,\r\nas I am not sure of the meaning. Manso (p. 343) translates it, 'He\r\nforces fugitives from justice, without regard to the lapse of time, to\r\ncome before his tribunal.'] He inflicts heavy fines on offenders, he\r\ndistributes the public revenue as he thinks fit, he has a like power\r\nin bestowing rights of free conveyance[429], he appropriates unclaimed\r\nproperty, he punishes the offences of Provincial Judges, he pronounces\r\nsentence by word of mouth [whereas all other Judges had to read their\r\ndecisions from their tablets].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: 'Exhibet enim sine prescriptione longinquos.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: 'Evectiones,' free passes by the _Cursus Publicus_.]\r\n\r\n'What is there that he has not entrusted to him whose very speech is\r\nJudgment? He may almost be said to have the power of making laws,\r\nsince the reverence due to him enables him to finish law-suits without\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n'On his entrance into the palace he, like ourselves, is adored by the\r\nassembled throng[430], and an office of such high rank appears to\r\nexcuse a practice which in other cases would be considered matter for\r\naccusation[431].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: 'Ingressus palatium nostra consuetudine frequenter\r\nadoratur.' We know from Lydus (De Mag. ii. 9) that the highest\r\nofficers of the army _knelt_ at the entrance of the Praetorian\r\nPraefect. Perhaps we need not infer from this passage that Oriental\r\n_prostration_ was used either towards Theodoric or his Praefect.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: 'Et tale officium morem videtur solvere, quod alios\r\npotuit accusare.']\r\n\r\n'In power, no dignity is his equal. He judges everywhere as the\r\nrepresentative of the Sovereign[432]. No soldier marks out to him the\r\nlimits of his jurisdiction, except the official of the Master of the\r\nSoldiery. I suppose that the ancients wished [even the Praefect] to\r\nyield something to those who were to engage in war on behalf of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: 'Vice sacrâ ubique judicat.']\r\n\r\n'He punishes with stripes even the Curials, who are called in the laws\r\na Lesser Senate.\r\n\r\n'In his own official staff (officium) he is invested with peculiar\r\nprivileges; since all men can see that he lays his commands on men of\r\nsuch high quality that not even the Judges of Provinces may presume to\r\nlook down upon them. The staff is therefore composed of men of the\r\nhighest education, energetic, strong-minded[433], intent on prompt\r\nobedience to the orders of their head, and not tolerating obstruction\r\nfrom others. To those who have served their time in his office, he\r\ngrants the rank of Tribunes and Notaries, thus making his attendants\r\nequal to those who, mingled with the chiefs of the State, wait upon\r\nour own presence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: 'Officium plane geniatum, efficax, instructum et totâ\r\nanimi firmitate praevalidum.']\r\n\r\n'We joyfully accomplish that which he arranges, since our reverence\r\nfor his office constrains us to give immediate effect to his decrees.\r\nHe deserves this at our hands, since his forethought nourishes the\r\nPalace, procures the daily rations of our servants, provides the\r\nsalaries even of the Judges themselves[434]. By his arrangements he\r\nsatiates the hungry appetites of the ambassadors of the [barbarous]\r\nnations[435]. And though other dignities have their specially defined\r\nprerogatives, by him everything that comes within the scope of our\r\nwisely-tempered sway is governed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: 'Humanitates quoque judicibus ipsis facit.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: 'Legatos gentium voraces explet ordinationibus suis.'\r\n_Voraces_ seems to give a better sense than the other reading,\r\n_veraces_.]\r\n\r\n'Take therefore, from this Indiction, on your shoulders the noble\r\nburden of all these cares. Administer it with vigour and with utmost\r\nloyalty, that your rule may be prosperous to us and useful to the\r\nRepublic. The more various the anxieties, the greater your glory. Let\r\nthat glory beam forth, not in our Palace only, but be reflected in far\r\ndistant Provinces. Let your prudence be equal to your power; yea, let\r\nthe fourfold virtue [of the Platonic philosophy] be seated in your\r\nconscience. Remember that your tribunal is placed so high that, when\r\nseated there, you should think of nothing sordid, nothing mean. Weigh\r\nwell what you ought to say, seeing that it is listened to by so many.\r\nLet the public records contain nothing [of your saying] which any need\r\nblush to read. The good governor not only has no part nor lot in\r\ninjustice; unless he is ever diligently doing some noble work he\r\nincurs blame even for his inactivity. For if that most holy author\r\n[Moses?] be consulted, it will be seen that it is a kind of priesthood\r\nto fill the office of the Praetorian Praefecture in a becoming\r\nmanner.'\r\n\r\n\r\n4. FORMULA OF THE PRAEFECTURE OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praefecture of the City.]\r\n\r\n'You, to whose care Rome is committed, are exalted by that charge to a\r\nposition of the highest dignity. The Senate also is presided over by\r\nyou; and the Senators, who wield full power in that assembly, tremble\r\nwhen they have to plead their own cause at your tribunal. But this is\r\nbecause they, who are the makers of laws, are subject to the laws; and\r\nso are we too, though not to a Judge.\r\n\r\n'Behave in a manner worthy of your high office. Treat the Consulars\r\nwith deference. Put away every base thought when you cross the\r\nthreshold of every virtue. If you wish to avoid unpopularity, avoid\r\nreceiving bribes. It is a grand thing when it can be said that Judges\r\nwill not accept that which thousands are eager to offer them.\r\n\r\n'To your care is committed not only Rome herself (though Rome\r\nincludes the world[436]), but, by ancient law, all within the\r\nhundredth milestone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: 'Quamvis in illa contineantur universa.']\r\n\r\n'You judge, on appeal, causes brought from certain Provinces defined\r\nby law. Your staff is composed of learned men; eloquent they can\r\nhardly help being, since they are always hearing the masters of\r\neloquence. You ride in your _Carpentum_ through a populace of\r\nnobles[437]; oh, act so as to deserve their shouts of welcome! How\r\nwill you deserve their favour? By seeing that merchandise is sold\r\nwithout venality[438]; that the fires kindled to heat the wholesome\r\nbaths are not chilled by corruption; that the games, which are meant\r\nfor the pleasure of the people, are not by partisanship made a cause\r\nof strife. For so great is the power of glorious truth, that even in\r\nthe affairs of the stage justice is desired[439]. Take then the robe\r\nof Romulus, and administer the laws of Rome. Other honours await you\r\nif you behave worthily in this office, and above all, if you win the\r\napplause of the Senate.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: 'Carpento veheris per nobilem plebem.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: i.e. probably, 'that you are not bribed by\r\nmonopolists.'

FORMULA OF THE QUAESTORSHIP.\r\n\r\n[This letter is particularly interesting, from the fact that it\r\ndescribes Cassiodorus' own office, that which he filled during many\r\nyears of the reign of Theodoric, and in virtue of which he wrote the\r\ngreater part of his 'Various Letters.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quaestorship.]\r\n\r\n'No Minister has more reason to glory in his office than the Quaestor,\r\nsince it brings him into constant and intimate communication with\r\nOurselves. The Quaestor has to learn our inmost thoughts, that he may\r\nutter them to our subjects. Whenever we are in doubt as to any matter\r\nwe ask our Quaestor, who is the treasure-house of public fame, the\r\ncupboard of laws; who has to be always ready for a sudden call, and\r\nmust exercise the wonderful powers which, as Cicero has pointed out,\r\nare inherent in the art of an orator. He should so paint the delights\r\nof virtue and the terrors of vice, that his eloquence should almost\r\nmake the sword of the magistrate needless.\r\n\r\n'What manner of man ought the Quaestor to be, who reflects the very\r\nimage of his Sovereign? If, as is often our custom, we chance to\r\nlisten to a suit, what authority must there be in his tongue who has\r\nto speak the King's words in the King's own presence? He must have\r\nknowledge of the law, wariness in speech, firmness of purpose, that\r\nneither gifts nor threats may cause him to swerve from justice. For in\r\nthe interests of Equity we suffer even ourselves to be contradicted,\r\nsince we too are bound to obey her. Let your learning be such that you\r\nmay set forth every subject on which you have to treat, with suitable\r\nembellishments.\r\n\r\n'Moved therefore by the fame of your wisdom and eloquence, we bestow\r\nupon you, by God's grace, the dignity of the Quaestorship, which is\r\nthe glory of letters, the temple of _civilitas_, the mother of all the\r\ndignities, the home of continence, the seat of all the virtues.\r\n\r\n'To you the Provinces transmit their prayers. From you the Senate\r\nseeks the aid of law. You are expected to suffice for the needs of all\r\nwho seek from us the remedies of the law. But when you have done all\r\nthis, be not elated with your success, be not gnawed with envy,\r\nrejoice not at the calamities of others; for what is hateful in the\r\nSovereign cannot be becoming in the Quaestor.\r\n\r\n'Exercise the power of the Prince in the condition of a subject; and\r\nmay you render a good account to the Judges at the end of your term of\r\noffice.'\r\n\r\n\r\n6. FORMULA OF THE MAGISTERIAL DIGNITY, AND ITS EXCELLENCY (MAGISTER\r\nOFFICIORUM).\r\n\r\n[The dignity and powers of the Master of the Offices were continually\r\nrising throughout the Fourth and Fifth Centuries at the cost of the\r\nPraetorian Praefect, many of whose functions were transferred to the\r\nMaster.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mastership of the Offices.]\r\n\r\n'The Master's is a name of dignity. To him belongs the discipline of\r\nthe Palace; he calms the stormy ranks of the insolent Scholares [the\r\nhousehold troops, 10,000 in number, in the palace of the Eastern\r\nEmperor, according to Lydus (ii. 24)]. He introduces the Senators to\r\nour presence, cheers them when they tremble, calms them when they are\r\nspeaking, sometimes inserts a word or two of his own, that all may be\r\nlaid in an orderly manner before us. It rests with him to fix a day\r\nfor the admission of a suitor to our _Aulicum Consistorium_, and to\r\nfulfil his promise. The opportune velocity of the post-horses [the\r\ncare of the _Cursus Publicus_] is diligently watched over by him[440].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: According to Lydus (ii. 10), the Cursus Publicus was\r\ntransferred from the Praefect to the Master, and afterwards, in part,\r\nretransferred to the Praefect.]\r\n\r\n'The ambassadors of foreign powers are introduced by him, and their\r\n_evectiones_ [free passes by the postal-service] are received from his\r\nhands[441].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: 'Per eum nominis nostri destinatur evectio.' The above\r\nis a conjectural translation.]\r\n\r\n'To an officer with these great functions Antiquity gave great\r\nprerogatives: that no Provincial Governor should assume office without\r\nhis consent, and that appeals should come to him from their decisions.\r\nHe has no charge of collecting money, only of spending it. It is his\r\nto appoint _peraequatores_[442] of provisions in the capital, and a\r\nJudge to attend to this matter. He also superintends the pleasures of\r\nthe people, and is bound to keep them from sedition by a generous\r\nexhibition of shows. The members of his staff, when they have served\r\ntheir full time, are adorned with the title of _Princeps_, and take\r\ntheir places at the head of the Praetorian cohorts and those of the\r\nUrban Praefecture [the officials serving in the bureaux of those two\r\nPraefects]--a mark of favour which almost amounts to injustice, since\r\nhe who serves in one office (the Master's) is thereby put at the head\r\nof all those who have been serving in another (the Praefect's)[443].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: Are these Superintendents of the Markets, charged with\r\nthe regulation of prices?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: 'Miroque modo inter Praetorianas cohortes et Urbanae\r\nPraefecturae milites videantur invenisse primatum, a quibus tibi\r\nhumile solvebatur obsequium. Sic in favore magni honoris injustitia\r\nquaedam a legibus venit, dum alienis excubiis praeponitur, qui alibi\r\nmilitasse declaratur.']\r\n\r\n[We learn from Lydus how intense was the jealousy of the grasping and\r\naspiring _Magistriani_ felt by the Praefect's subordinates; and we may\r\ninfer from this passage that Cassiodorus thought that there was some\r\njustification for this feeling.]\r\n\r\n'The assistant (Adjutor) of the Magister is also present at our\r\naudiences, a distinguished honour for his chief.\r\n\r\n'Take therefore this illustrious office and discharge it worthily,\r\nthat, in all which you do, you may show yourself a true Magister. If\r\n_you_ should in anywise go astray (which God forbid), where should\r\nmorality be found upon earth?'\r\n\r\n\r\n7. FORMULA OF THE OFFICE OF COMES SACRARUM LARGITIONUM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Office of Count of Sacred Largesses.]\r\n\r\n'Yours is the high and pleasing office of administering the bounty of\r\nyour Sovereign[444]. Through you we dispense our favours and relieve\r\nneedy suppliants on New Year's Day. It is your business to see that\r\nour face is imprinted on our coins, a reminder to our subjects of our\r\nceaseless care on their behalf, and a memorial of our reign to future\r\nages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: 'Regalibus magna profecti felicitas _militare_\r\ndonis.... Laetitia publica _militia_ tua est.' Observe the continued\r\nuse of military terms for what we call the Civil Service.]\r\n\r\n'To this your regular office we also add the place of _Primicerius_\r\n[_Primicerius Notariorum_?], so that you are the channel through which\r\nhonours as well as largesses flow. Not only the Judges of the\r\nProvinces are subject to you, even the _Proceres Chartarum_ (?) have\r\nnot their offices assured to them till you have confirmed the\r\ninstrument. You have also the care of the royal robes. The sea-coasts\r\nand their products, and therefore merchants, are under your sway. The\r\ncommerce of salt, that precious mineral, rightly classed with silken\r\nrobes and pearls, is placed under your superintendence.\r\n\r\n'Take therefore these two dignities, the Comitiva Sacrarum Largitionum\r\nand the Primiceriatus. If some of the ancient privileges of your\r\noffice have been retrenched [some functions, probably, taken from the\r\nComes Sacrarum Largitionum and assigned to the Comes Patrimonii],\r\ncomfort yourself with the thought that you have two dignities instead\r\nof one.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8. FORMULA OF THE OFFICE OF COMES PRIVATARUM, AND ITS EXCELLENCY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Office of Count of Private Domains.]\r\n\r\n'Your chief business, as the name of your office implies, is to govern\r\nthe royal estates by the instrumentality of the _Rationales_ under\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n'This work alone, however, would have given you a jurisdiction only\r\nover slaves [those employed on the royal domains]; and as a slave is\r\nnot a person in the eye of the law, it seemed unworthy of the dignity\r\nof Latium to confine your jurisdiction to these men. Some urban\r\nauthority has therefore been given you in addition to that which you\r\nexercise over these boors: cases of incest, and of pollution or\r\nspoliation of graves, come before you. Thus the chastity of the\r\nliving and the security of the dead are equally your care. In the\r\nProvinces you superintend the tribute-collectors (Canonicarios), you\r\nadmonish the cultivators of the soil (Possessores), and you claim for\r\nthe Royal Exchequer property to which no heirs are forthcoming[445].\r\nDeposited monies also, the owners of which are lost by lapse of time,\r\nare searched out by you and brought into our Exchequer, since those\r\nwho by our permission enjoy all their own property ought willingly and\r\nwithout sense of loss to offer us that which belongs to other men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: 'Caduca bona non sinis esse vacantia.']\r\n\r\n'Take then the honour of _Comes Privatarum_: it also is a courtly\r\ndignity, and you will augment it by your worthy fulfilment of its\r\nfunctions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n9. FORMULA OF THE OFFICE OF COUNT OF THE PATRIMONY, AND ITS\r\nEXCELLENCY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Office of Count of the Patrimony.]\r\n\r\n'To our distant servants we send long papers with instructions as to\r\ntheir conduct; but you, admitted to our daily converse, do not need\r\nthese. You are to undertake the care of our royal patrimony.\r\n\r\n'Do not give in to all the suggestions of our servants on these\r\ndomains, who are apt to think that everything is permitted them\r\nbecause they represent the King; but rather incline the scale against\r\nthem. You will have to act much in our sight; and as the rising sun\r\ndiscloses the true colours of objects, so the King's constant presence\r\nreveals the Minister's character in its true light. Avoid loud and\r\nharsh tones in pronouncing your decisions: when we hear you using\r\nthese, we shall know that you are in the wrong. External acts and\r\nbodily qualities show the habit of the mind. We know a proud man by\r\nhis swaggering gait, an angry one by his flashing eyes, a crafty one\r\nby his downcast look, a fickle one by his wandering gaze, at\r\navaricious one by his hooked nails.\r\n\r\n'Take then the office of Count of the Patrimony, and discharge it\r\nuprightly. Be expeditious in your decisions on the complaints of the\r\ntillers of the soil. Justice speedily granted is thereby greatly\r\nenhanced in value, and though it is really the suitor's right it\r\ncharms him as if it were a favour.\r\n\r\n'Attend also to the provision of suitable delicacies for our royal\r\ntable. It is a great thing that ambassadors coming from all parts of\r\nthe world should see rare dainties at our board, and such an\r\ninexhaustible supply of provisions brought in by the crowds of our\r\nservants that they are almost ready to think the food grows again in\r\nthe kitchen, whither they see the dishes carried with the broken\r\nvictuals. These banqueting times are, and quite deservedly, your times\r\nfor approaching us with business, when no one else is allowed to do\r\nso.'\r\n\r\n\r\n10. FORMULA BY WHICH MEN ARE MADE PROCERES PER CODICILLOS VACANTES.\r\n\r\n[Bestowal of Brevet-rank on persons outside the Civil Service.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Codicilli Vacantes.]\r\n\r\n'There are cases in which men whom it is desirable for the Sovereign\r\nto honour are unable, from delicate health or slender fortunes, to\r\nenter upon an official career. For instance, a poor nobleman may dread\r\nthe expenses of the Consulship; a man illustrious by his wisdom may be\r\nunable to bear the worries of a Praefecture; an eloquent tongue may\r\nshun the weight of a Quaestorship. In these cases the laws have wisely\r\nordained that we may give such persons the rank which they merit by\r\n_Codicilli Vacantes_. It must always be understood, however, that in\r\neach dignity those who thus obtain it rank behind those who have\r\nearned it by actual service. Otherwise we should have all men\r\nflocking into these quiet posts, if the workers were not preferred to\r\nmen of leisure[446].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: 'Alioqui omnes ad quietas possunt currere dignitates,\r\nsi laborantes minime praeferantur ociosis.']\r\n\r\n'Take therefore, by these present codicils, the rank which you\r\ndeserve, though you have not earned it by your official career.'\r\n\r\n\r\n11. FORMULA BY WHICH THE RANK OF AN ILLUSTRIS AND THE TITLE OF A COMES\r\nDOMESTICORUM ARE CONFERRED, WITHOUT OFFICE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illustratus Vacans.]\r\n\r\n'The bestowal of honour, though it does not change the nature of a\r\nman, induces him to consider his own reputation more closely, and to\r\nabstain from that which may stain it[447].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: 'Noblesse oblige.']\r\n\r\n'Take therefore the rank (without office) of an Illustrious Count of\r\nthe Domestics[448], and enjoy that greatest luxury of worthy\r\nminds--power to attend to your own pursuits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: 'Cape igitur ... Comitivae Domesticorum Illustratum\r\nVacantem.']\r\n\r\n'For what can be sweeter than to find yourself honoured when you enter\r\nthe City, and yet to be able to cultivate your own fields; to abstain\r\nfrom fraudful gains, and yet see your barns overflowing with the fruit\r\nof your own sweet toil?\r\n\r\n'But even as the seed and the soil must co-operate to produce the\r\nharvest, so do we sow in you the seed of this dignity, trusting that\r\nyour own goodness of heart will give the increase.'\r\n\r\n\r\n12. FORMULA FOR THE BESTOWAL OF A COUNTSHIP OF THE FIRST ORDER,\r\nWITHOUT OFFICE.\r\n\r\n[A similar honour to that which is conferred on an English statesman\r\nwho, without receiving any place in the Ministry, is 'sworn of the\r\nPrivy Council.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Primi Ordinis.]\r\n\r\n'It is a delightful thing to enjoy the pleasures of high rank without\r\nhaving to undergo the toils and annoyances of office, which often make\r\na man loathe the very dignity which he eagerly desired.\r\n\r\n'The rank of _Comes_ is one which is reached by Governors (Rectores)\r\nof Provinces after a year's tenure of office, and by the Counsellors\r\nof the Praefect, whose functions are so important that we look upon\r\nthem as almost Quaestors.\r\n\r\n'Their rank[449] gives the holder of it, though only a _Spectabilis_,\r\nadmission to our Consistory, where he sits side by side with all the\r\nIllustres.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: Betokened by the expression 'Ociosum cingulum.']\r\n\r\n'We bestow it upon you, and name you a _Comes Primi Ordinis_, thereby\r\nindicating that you are to take your place at the head of all the\r\nother Spectabiles and next after the Illustres. See that you imitate\r\nthe latter, and that you are not surpassed in excellence of character\r\nby any of those below you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n13. FORMULA FOR BESTOWING THE [HONORARY] RANK OF MASTER OF THE BUREAU\r\n[MAGISTER SCRINII] AND COUNT OF THE FIRST ORDER, ON AN OFFICER OF THE\r\nCOURTS (COMITIACUS) IN ACTIVE SERVICE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honorary promotion for a Comitiacus.]\r\n\r\n'Great toils and great perils are the portion of an officer of the\r\nCourts in giving effect to their sentences. It is easy for the Judge\r\nto say, \"Let so and so be done;\" but on the unhappy officer falls all\r\nthe difficulty and all the odium of doing it. He has to track out\r\noffenders and hunt them to their very beds, to compel the contumacious\r\nto obey the law, to make the proud learn their equality before it. If\r\nhe lingers over the business assigned to him, the plaintiff complains;\r\nif he is energetic, the defendant calls out. The very honesty with\r\nwhich he addresses himself to the work is sure to make him enemies,\r\nenemies perhaps among powerful persons, who next year may be his\r\nsuperiors in office, and thus subjects him to all sorts of accusations\r\nwhich he may find it very hard to disprove. In short, if we may say it\r\nwithout offence to the higher dignitaries, it is far easier to\r\ndischarge without censure the functions of a Judge than those of the\r\nhumble officer who gives effect to his decrees.\r\n\r\n'Wherefore, in reward for your long and faithful service, and in\r\naccordance with ancient usage, we bestow on you the rank of a Count of\r\nthe First Order, and ordain that if anyone shall molest you on account\r\nof your acts done in the discharge of your duties, he shall pay a fine\r\nof so many [perhaps ten = £400] pounds of gold.'\r\n\r\n[This letter will be found well worth studying in the original, as\r\ngiving a picture of the kind of opposition met with by the men who\r\nwere charged with the execution of the orders of the Rectores\r\nProvinciarum, and whose functions were themselves partly judicial,\r\nvarying between those of a Master in Chancery and those of a Sheriff's\r\nofficer. Throughout, the Civil Service is spoken of in military\r\nlanguage. The officer is called _miles_, and his duty is _excubiae_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. FORMULA BESTOWING RANK AS A SENATOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Senatorial rank.]\r\n\r\n'We desire that our Senate should grow and flourish abundantly. As a\r\nparent sees the increase of his family, as a husbandman the growth of\r\nhis trees with joy, so we the growth of the Senate. We therefore\r\ndesire that Graius should be included in that virtuous and\r\npraiseworthy assembly[450]. This is a new kind of grafting, in which\r\nthe less noble shoot is grafted on to the nobler stock. As a candle\r\nshines at night, but pales in the full sunlight, so does everyone,\r\nhowever illustrious by birth or character, who is introduced into your\r\nmajestic body. Open your Curia, receive our candidate. He is already\r\npredestined to the Senate upon whom we have conferred the dignity of\r\nthe Laticlave.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: A conjectural translation of 'Sic nos virtutum\r\njucundissimas laudes incinctum Graium desideramus includere.' Perhaps\r\n'incinctum' means, 'though _not_ girded with the belt of office.'\r\nGraium must surely be a proper name, and this document is therefore,\r\nstrictly speaking, not a 'Formula.']\r\n\r\n\r\n15. FORMULA OF THE VICARIUS OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vicariate of the City of Rome.]\r\n\r\n'Though nominally only the agent of another [the Praefectus Urbi] you\r\nhave powers and privileges of your own which almost entitle you to\r\nrank with the Praefects. Suitors plead before you in causes otherwise\r\nheard only before Praefects[451]; you pronounce sentence in the name\r\nof the King[452] [not of the Praefect]; and you have jurisdiction even\r\nin capital cases. You wear the chlamys, and are not to be saluted by\r\npassers-by except when thus arrayed, as if the law wished you to be\r\nalways seen in military garb. [The chlamys was therefore at this time\r\na strictly military dress.] In all these things the glory of the\r\nPraefecture seems to be exalted in you, as if one should say, \"How\r\ngreat must the Praefect be, if his Vicar is thus honoured!\" Like the\r\nhighest dignitaries you ride in a state carriage[453]. You have\r\njurisdiction everywhere within the fortieth milestone from the City.\r\nYou preside over the games at Praeneste, sitting in the Consul's seat.\r\nYou enter the Senate-house itself, that palace of liberty[454].

FORMULA OF THE NOTARIES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Notaries.]\r\n\r\n'It is most important that the secrets of the Sovereign, which many\r\nmen so eagerly desire to discover, should be committed to persons of\r\ntried fidelity. A good secretary should be like a well-arranged\r\n_escritoire_, full of information when you want it, but absolutely\r\nsilent at other times. Nay, he must even be able to dissimulate his\r\nknowledge, for keen questioners can often read in the face what the\r\nlips utter not. [Cf. the description of the Quaestor Decoratus in v.\r\n3.]\r\n\r\n'Our enquiries, keen-scented as they are for all men of good life and\r\nconversation, have brought your excellent character before us. We\r\ntherefore ordain that you shall henceforth be a Notary.

FORMULA OF THE REFERENDARII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Referendarii.]\r\n\r\n[We have no word corresponding to this title. Registrar, Referee,\r\nSolicitor, each expresses only part of the duties of the\r\nReferendarius, whose business it was, _on behalf of the Court_, to\r\ndraw up a statement of the conflicting claims of the litigants before\r\nit. See the interesting letters (v. 40 and 41) describing the useful\r\nservices rendered in this capacity by Cyprian in the King's Court of\r\nAppeal. His duties seem to have been very similar to those which in\r\nthe Court of the Praetorian Praefect were discharged by the officer\r\ncalled _Ab Actis_ (See p. 107).]\r\n\r\n'Great is the privilege of being admitted to such close converse with\r\nthe King as you will possess, but great also are the responsibilities\r\nand the anxieties of the Referendarius. In the midst of the hubbub of\r\nthe Court he has to make out the case of the litigant, and to clothe\r\nit in language suitable for our ears. If he softens it down ever so\r\nlittle in his repetition of it, the claimant declares that he has been\r\nbribed, that he is hostile to his suit. A man who is pleading his own\r\ncause may soften down a word or two here and there, if he see that the\r\nCourt is against him; but the Referendarius dares not alter anything.\r\nThen upon him rests the responsibility of drawing up our decree,\r\nadding nothing, omitting nothing. Hard task to speak _our_ words in\r\nour own presence.\r\n\r\n'Take then the office of Referendarius, and show by your exercise of\r\nit to what learning men may attain by sharing our conversation.

You have to\r\nprepare the Annona of the sacred City, and to feed the whole people as\r\nat one board. You run up and down through the shops of the bakers,\r\nlooking after the weight and fineness of the bread, and not thinking\r\nany office mean by which you may win the affections of the citizens.\r\n\r\n'You mount the chariot of the Praefect of the City, and are displayed\r\nin closest companionship with him at the games. Should a sudden tumult\r\narise by reason of a scarcity of loaves, you have to still it by\r\npromising a liberal distribution. It was from his conduct in this\r\noffice that Pompey attained the highest dignities and earned the\r\nsurname of the Great.\r\n\r\n'The pork-butchers also (Suarii) are subject to your control.\r\n\r\n'It is true that the corn is actually provided by the Praetorian\r\nPraefect, but you see that it is worked up into elegant bread[457].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: 'Quando in quavis abundantia querela non tollitur, si\r\npanis elegantia nulla servetur.']\r\n\r\n'Even so Ceres discovered corn, but Pan taught men how to bake it into\r\nbread; whence its name (_Panis_, from Pan).\r\n\r\n'Take then this office: discharge it faithfully, and weigh, more\r\naccurately than gold, the bread by which the Quirites live.'\r\n\r\n\r\n19. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF THE CHIEF PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comes Archiatrorum.]\r\n\r\n'The doctor helps us when all other helpers seem to fail. By his art\r\nhe finds out things about a man of which he himself is ignorant; and\r\nhis prognosis of a case, though founded on reason, seems to the\r\nignorant like prophecy.\r\n\r\n'It is disgraceful that there should be a president of the lascivious\r\npleasures of the people (Tribunus Voluptatum) and none of this healing\r\nart. Excellent too may your office be in enabling you to control the\r\nsquabbles of the doctors. They ought not to quarrel. At the beginning\r\nof their exercise of their art they take a sort of priestly oath to\r\nhate wickedness and to love purity. Take then this rank of Comes\r\nArchiatrorum, and have the distinguished honour of presiding over so\r\nmany skilled practitioners and of moderating their disputes.\r\n\r\n'Leave it to clumsy men to ask their patients \"if they have had good\r\nsleep; if the pain has left them.\" Do you rather incline the patient\r\nto ask you about his own malady, showing him that you know more about\r\nit than he does. The patient's pulse, the patient's water, tell to a\r\nskilled physician the whole story of his disease.\r\n\r\n'Enter our palace unbidden; command us, whom all other men obey; weary\r\nus if you will with fasting, and make us do the very opposite of that\r\nwhich we desire, since all this is your prerogative.'\r\n\r\n\r\n20. FORMULA OF THE OFFICE OF A CONSULAR, AND ITS EXCELLENCY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consularis.]\r\n\r\n'You bear among your trappings the axes and the rods of the Consul, as\r\na symbol of the nature of the jurisdiction which you exercise in the\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\n'In some Provinces you even wear the _paenula_ (military cloak) and\r\nride in the _carpentum_ (official chariot), as a proof of your\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n'You must not think that because your office is allied to that of\r\nConsul any lavish expenditure by way of largesse is necessary. By no\r\nmeans; but it is necessary that you should abstain from all unjust\r\ngains. Nothing is worse than a mixture of rapacity and prodigality.\r\n\r\n'Respect the property of the Provincials, and your tenure of office\r\nwill be without blame.\r\n\r\n'Receive therefore, for this Indiction, the office of Consular in such\r\nand such a Province, and let your moderation appear to all the\r\ninhabitants.'\r\n\r\n\r\n21. FORMULA OF THE GOVERNOR (RECTOR) OF A PROVINCE.\r\n\r\n[The distinction between the powers of a Rector and those of a\r\nConsularis seems to have been very slight, if it existed at all; but\r\nthe dignity of the latter office was probably somewhat the greater.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rector Provinciae.]\r\n\r\n'It is important to repress crime on the spot. If all criminal causes\r\nhad to wait till they could be tried in the capital, robbers would\r\ngrow so bold as to be intolerable. Hence the advantage of Provincial\r\nGovernors. Receive then for this Indiction the office of Rector of\r\nsuch and such a Province. Look at the broad stripe (laticlave) on your\r\npurple robe, and remember the dignity which is betokened by that\r\nbright garment, which poets say was first woven by Venus for her son\r\nPriapus, that the son's beautiful robe might attest the mother's\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\n'You have to collect the public revenues, and to report to the\r\nSovereign all important events in your Province. You may judge even\r\nSenators and the officers of Praefects. Your name comes before that of\r\neven dignified Provincials, and you are called Brother by the\r\nSovereign. See that your character corresponds to this high vocation.\r\nYour subjects will not fear you if they see that your own actions are\r\nimmoral. There can be no worse slavery than to sit on the\r\njudgment-seat, knowing that the men who appear before you are\r\npossessors of some disgraceful secret by which they can blast your\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n'Refrain from unholy gains, and we will reward you all the more\r\nliberally.'\r\n\r\n\r\n22. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF THE CITY OF SYRACUSE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Syracusana.]\r\n\r\n'We must provide such Governors for our distant possessions that\r\nappeals from them shall not be frequent. Many men would rather lose a\r\njust cause than have the expense of coming all the way from Sicily to\r\ndefend it; and as for complaints against a Governor, we should be\r\nstrongly inclined to think that a complaint presented by such distant\r\npetitioners must be true.\r\n\r\n'Act therefore with all the more caution in the office which we bestow\r\nupon you for this Indiction. You have all the pleasant pomp of an\r\nofficial retinue provided for you at our expense. Do not let your\r\nsoldiers be insolent to the cultivators of the soil (possessores). Let\r\nthem receive their rations and be satisfied with them, nor mix in\r\nmatters outside their proper functions. Be satisfied with the dignity\r\nwhich your predecessors held. It ought not to be lowered; but do not\r\nseek to exalt it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n23. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF NAPLES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Neapolitana.]\r\n\r\n'As the sun sends forth his rays so we send out our servants to the\r\nvarious cities of our dominions, to adorn them with the splendour of\r\ntheir retinue, and to facilitate the untying of the knots of the law\r\nby the multitude of jurisconsults who follow in their train. Thus we\r\nsow a liberal crop of official salaries, and reap our harvest in the\r\ntranquillity of our subjects. For this Indiction we send you as Count\r\nto weigh the causes of the people of Naples. It is a populous city,\r\nand one abounding in delights by sea and land. You may lead there a\r\nmost delicious life, if your cup be not mixed with bitterness by the\r\ncriticisms of the citizens on your judgments. You will sit on a\r\njewelled tribunal, and the Praetorium will be filled with your\r\nofficers; but you will also be surrounded by a multitude of fastidious\r\nspectators, who assuredly, in their conversation, will judge the\r\nJudge. See then that you walk warily. Your power extends for a certain\r\ndistance along the coast, and both the buyer and seller have to pay\r\nyou tribute. We give you the chance of earning the applause of a vast\r\naudience: do you so act that your Sovereign may take pleasure in\r\nmultiplying his gifts.'\r\n\r\n\r\n24. FORMULA ADDRESSED TO THE GENTLEMEN-FARMERS (OR THE TITLED\r\nCULTIVATORS) AND COMMON COUNCILMEN[458] OF THE CITY OF NAPLES [AND\r\nSURROUNDING DISTRICT].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: An attempt to translate 'Honoratis possessoribus et\r\ncurialibus civitatis Neapolitanae.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honorati Possessores et Curiales Civitatis Neapolitanae.]\r\n\r\n'You pay us tribute, but we have conferred honours upon you. We are\r\nnow sending you a Comes [the one appointed in the previous formula],\r\nbut he will be a terror only to the evil-disposed.

Your quietness is our highest joy[459].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: 'Erit nostrum gaudium vestra quies.... Degite moribus\r\ncompositis, ut vivatis legibus feriatis.']\r\n\r\n\r\n25 is entitled, 'FORMULA DE COMITIVA PRINCIPIS MILITUM;' but this is\r\nevidently an inaccurate, or at least an insufficient title.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Doubtful.]\r\n\r\nThe letter, though very short, is obscure.\r\n\r\nIt starts with the maxim that every staff of officials ought to have\r\nits own Judge[460], and then, apparently, proceeds to make an\r\nexception to this rule by making the persons addressed--the civil or\r\nmilitary functionaries of Naples--subject to the Comes Neapolitanus\r\nwho was appointed by the Twenty-third Formula. No reason is given for\r\nthis exception, except an unintelligible one about preserving the\r\nyearly succession of Judges[461]; but the persons are assured that\r\ntheir salaries shall be safe[462].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: 'Omnes apparitiones decet habere judices suos.

FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF A PROVINCE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Provinciae.]\r\n\r\n'Your dignity, unlike that of most civil officers, is guarded by the\r\nsword of war. See however that this terrible weapon is only drawn on\r\noccasions of absolute necessity, and only wielded for the punishment\r\nof evil-doers. Anyone who is determining a case of life and death\r\nshould decide slowly, since any other sentence is capable of\r\ncorrection, but the dead man cannot be recalled to life. Let the\r\nensigns of your power be terrible to drivers-away of cattle, to\r\nthieves and robbers; but let innocence rejoice when she sees the\r\ntokens of approaching succour. Let no one pervert your will by bribes:\r\nthe sword of justice is sheathed when gold is taken. Receive then for\r\nthis Indiction the dignity of Count in such and such a Province. So\r\nuse your power that you may be able to defend your actions when\r\nreduced to a private station, though indeed, if you serve us well in\r\nthis office, we are minded to promote you to yet higher dignities.'\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FORMULA OF A PRAESES.\r\n\r\n[The Praeses had practically the same powers as the Consularis (v. 20)\r\nand the Rector (v. 21), but occupied a less dignified position, being\r\nonly a 'Perfectissimus,' not a 'Clarissimus[463].']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: See p. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praesidatus.]\r\n\r\n'It has been wisely ordered by the Ancients that a Provincial\r\nGovernor's term of office should be only annual. Thus men are\r\nprevented from growing arrogant by long tenure of power, and we are\r\nenabled to reward a larger number of aspirants. Get through one year\r\nof office if you can without blame: even that is not an easy matter.\r\nIt rests then with us to prolong the term of a deserving ruler[464],\r\nsince we are not keen to remove those whom we feel to be governing\r\njustly. Receive then for this Indiction the Praesidatus of such and\r\nsuch a Province, and so act that the tiller of the soil (possessor)\r\nmay bring us thanks along with his tribute. Follow the good example of\r\nyour predecessors: carefully avoid the bad. Remember how full your\r\nProvince is of nobles, whose good report you may earn but cannot\r\ncompel. You will find it a delightful reward, when you travel through\r\nthe neighbouring Provinces, to hear your praises sounded there where\r\nyour power extends not. You know our will: it is all contained in the\r\nlaws of the State. Govern in accordance with these, and you shall not\r\ngo unrewarded.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: 'Nostrum est merentibus tempus augere.' The limit of\r\none year might therefore be exceeded by favour of the Sovereign.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF THE GOTHS IN THE SEVERAL PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Gothorum per singulas Provincias.]\r\n\r\n[Dahn remarks ('Könige der Germanen' iv. 157): 'We must go thoroughly\r\ninto the question of this office. The _Comes Gothorum_ is the most\r\nimportant, in fact almost the only new dignity in the Gothic State,\r\nand the formula of his installation is the chief proof of the\r\ncoexistence of Roman and Gothic law in this kingdom.' I have therefore\r\ntranslated this formula at full length.]\r\n\r\n'As we know that, by God's help, Goths are dwelling intermingled among\r\nyou, in order to prevent the trouble (indisciplinatio) which is wont\r\nto arise among partners (consortes) we have thought it right to send\r\nto you as Count, A B, a sublime person, a man already proved to be of\r\nhigh character, in order that he may terminate (amputare) any contests\r\narising between two Goths according to our edicts; but that, if any\r\nmatter should arise between a Goth and a born Roman, he may, after\r\nassociating with himself a Roman jurisconsult[465], decide the strife\r\nby fair reason[466]. As between two Romans, let the decision rest with\r\nthe Roman examiners (cognitores), whom we appoint in the various\r\nProvinces; that thus each may keep his own laws, and with various\r\nJudges one Justice may embrace the whole realm. Thus, sharing one\r\ncommon peace, may both nations, if God favour us, enjoy the sweets of\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: 'Adhibito sibi prudente Romano.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: 'Aequabili ratione.']\r\n\r\n'Know, however, that we view all [our subjects] with one impartial\r\nlove; but he may commend himself more abundantly to our favour who\r\nsubdues his own will into loving submission to the law[467]. We like\r\nnothing that is disorderly[468]; we detest wicked arrogance and all\r\nwho have anything to do with it. Our principles lead us to execrate\r\nviolent men[469]. In a dispute let laws decide, not the strong arm.\r\nWhy should men seek by choice violent remedies, when they know that\r\nthe Courts of Justice are open to them? It is for this cause that we\r\npay the Judges their salaries, for this that we maintain such large\r\nofficial staffs with all their privileges, that we may not allow\r\nanything to grow up among you which may tend towards hatred. Since you\r\nsee that one lordship (imperium) is over you, let there be also one\r\ndesire in your hearts, to live in harmony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: 'Qui leges moderatâ voluntate dilexerit.' To translate\r\nthis literally might give a wrong idea, because with us 'to love the\r\nlaw' means to be litigious.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: 'Non amamus aliquid incivile.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: 'Violentos nostra pietas execratur.']\r\n\r\n'Let both nations hear what we have at heart. You [oh Goths!] have the\r\nRomans as neighbours to your lands: even so let them be joined to you\r\nin affection. You too, oh Romans! ought dearly to love the Goths, who\r\nin peace swell the numbers of your people and in war defend the whole\r\nRepublic[470]. It is fitting therefore that you obey the Judge whom we\r\nhave appointed for you, that you may by all means accomplish all that\r\nhe may ordain for the preservation of the laws; and thus you will be\r\nfound to have promoted your own interests while obeying our command.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: 'Vos autem, Romani, magno studio Gothos diligere\r\ndebetis, qui et in pace numerosos vobis populos faciunt, et universam\r\nRempublicam per bella defendunt.']\r\n\r\n\r\n4. FORMULA OF THE DUKE OF RAETIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ducatus Raetiarum.]\r\n\r\n'Although promotion among the _Spectabiles_ goes solely by seniority,\r\nit is impossible to deny that those who are employed in the border\r\nProvinces have a more arduous, and therefore in a sense more\r\nhonourable, office than those who command in the peaceful districts of\r\nItaly. The former have to deal with war, the latter only with the\r\nrepression of crime. The former hear the trumpet's clang, the latter\r\nthe voice of the crier.\r\n\r\n'The Provinces of Raetia are the bars and bolts of Italy. Wild and\r\ncruel nations ramp outside of them, and they, like nets, whence their\r\nname[471], catch the Barbarian in their toils and hold him there till\r\nthe hurled arrow can chastise his mad presumption.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: Raetia, from _rete_, a net.]\r\n\r\n'Receive then for this Indiction the _Ducatus Raetiarum_. Let your\r\nsoldiers live on friendly terms with the Provincials, avoiding all\r\nlawless presumption; and at the same time let them be constantly on\r\ntheir guard against the Barbarians outside. Even bloodshed is often\r\nprevented by seasonable vigilance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n5. FORMULA OF THE PALACE ARCHITECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cura Palatii.]\r\n\r\n'Much do we delight in seeing the greatness of our Kingdom imaged\r\nforth in the splendour of our palace.\r\n\r\n'Thus do the ambassadors of foreign nations admire our power, for at\r\nfirst sight one naturally believes that as is the house so is the\r\ninhabitant.\r\n\r\n'The Cyclopes invented the art of working in metal, which then passed\r\nover from Sicily to Italy.\r\n\r\n'Take then for this Indiction the care of our palace, thus receiving\r\nthe power of transmitting your fame to a remote posterity which shall\r\nadmire your workmanship. See that your new work harmonises well with\r\nthe old. Study Euclid--get his diagrams well into your mind; study\r\nArchimedes and Metrobius.\r\n\r\n'When we are thinking of rebuilding a city, or of founding a fort or a\r\ngeneral's quarters, we shall rely upon you to express our thoughts on\r\npaper [in an architect's design]. The builder of walls, the carver of\r\nmarbles, the caster of brass, the vaulter of arches[472], the\r\nplasterer, the worker in mosaic, all come to you for orders, and you\r\nare expected to have a wise answer for each. But, then, if you direct\r\nthem rightly, while theirs is the work yours is all the glory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: 'Camerarum rotator.']\r\n\r\n'Above all things, dispense honestly what we give you for the\r\nworkmen's wages; for the labourer who is at ease about his victuals\r\nworks all the better.\r\n\r\n'As a mark of your high dignity you bear a golden wand, and amidst the\r\nnumerous throng of servants walk first before the royal footsteps\r\n[i.e. last in the procession and immediately before the King], that\r\neven by your nearness to our person it may be seen that you are the\r\nman to whom we have entrusted the care of our palaces.'\r\n\r\n\r\n6. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF THE AQUEDUCTS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Formarum Urbis.]\r\n\r\n'Though all the buildings of Rome are wonderful, and one can scarce\r\nfor this reason say which are the chief among them, we think a\r\ndistinction may be drawn between those which are reared only for the\r\nsake of ornament and those which also serve a useful purpose. Thus,\r\nhowever often one sees the Forum of Trajan, it always seems a\r\nwonder[473]. To stand on the lofty Capitol is to see all other works\r\nof the human intellect surpassed. And yet neither of these great works\r\ntouches human life, nor ministers to health or enjoyment. But in the\r\nAqueducts of Rome we note both the marvel of their construction and\r\nthe rare wholesomeness of their waters. When you look at those rivers,\r\nled as it were over piled up mountains, you would think that their\r\nsolid stony beds were natural channels, through so many ages have they\r\nborne the rush of such mighty waters. And yet even mountains are\r\nfrequently undermined, and let out the torrents which have excavated\r\nthem; while these artificial channels, the work of the ancients, never\r\nperish, if reasonable care be taken of their preservation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: 'Trajani Forum vel sub assiduitate videre miraculum\r\nest.']\r\n\r\n'Let us consider how much that wealth of waters adds to the adornment\r\nof the City of Rome. Where would be the beauty of our _Thermae_, if\r\nthose softest waters were not supplied to them?\r\n\r\n'Purest and most delightful of all streams glides along the _Aqua\r\nVirgo_, so named because no defilement ever stains it. For while all\r\nthe others, after heavy rain show some contaminating mixture of\r\nearth, this alone by its ever pure stream would cheat us into\r\nbelieving that the sky was always blue above us. Ah! how express these\r\nthings in words worthy of them? The _Aqua Claudia_ is led along on the\r\ntop of such a lofty pile that, when it reaches Mount Aventine, it\r\nfalls from above upon that lofty summit as if it were watering some\r\nlowly valley. It is true that the Egyptian Nile, rising at certain\r\nseasons, brings its flood of waters over the land under a cloudless\r\nsky; but how much fairer a sight is it to see the Roman Claudia\r\nflowing with a never-failing stream over all those thirsty mountain\r\ntops, and bringing purest water through a multitude of pipes to so\r\nmany baths and houses. When Nile retreats he leaves mud behind him;\r\nwhen he comes unexpectedly he brings a deluge. Shall we not then\r\nboldly say that our Aqueducts surpass the famous Nile, which is so\r\noften a terror to the dwellers on his banks either by what he brings\r\nor by what he leaves behind him? It is in no spirit of pride that we\r\nenumerate these particulars, but in order that you may consider how\r\ngreat diligence should be shown by you to whom such splendid works are\r\nentrusted.\r\n\r\n'Wherefore, after careful consideration, we entrust you for this\r\nIndiction with the _Comitiva Formarum_, that you may zealously strive\r\nto accomplish what the maintenance of such noble structures requires.\r\nEspecially as to the hurtful trees which are the ruin of buildings,\r\n[inserting their roots between the stones and] demolishing them with\r\nthe destructiveness of a battering-ram: we wish them to be pulled up\r\nby the roots, since it is no use dealing with an evil of this kind\r\nexcept in its origin. If any part is falling into decay through age,\r\nlet it be repaired at once: the first expense is the least. The\r\nstrengthening of the Aqueducts will constitute your best claim on our\r\nfavour, and will be the surest means of establishing your own\r\nfortune. Act with skill and honesty, and let there be no corrupt\r\npractices in reference to the distribution of the water.'\r\n\r\n\r\n7. FORMULA OF THE PRAEFECT OF THE WATCH OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praefectus Vigilum Urbis Romae.]\r\n\r\n'Your office, exercised as it is in the City itself, and under the\r\neyes of Patricians and Consuls, is sure to bring you renown if you\r\ndischarge its duties with diligence. You have full power to catch\r\nthieves, though the law reserves the right of punishing them for\r\nanother official, apparently because it would remember that even these\r\ndetestable plunderers are yet Roman citizens. Take then for this\r\nIndiction the _Praefectura Vigilum_. You will be the safety of\r\nsleepers, the bulwark of houses, the defence of bolts and bars, an\r\nunseen scrutineer, a silent judge, one whose right it is to entrap the\r\nplotters and whose glory to deceive them. Your occupation is a nightly\r\nhunting, most feared when it is not seen. You rob the robbers, and\r\nstrive to circumvent the men who make a mock at all other citizens. It\r\nis only by a sort of sleight of hand that you can throw your nets\r\naround robbers; for it is easier to guess the riddles of the Sphinx\r\nthan to detect the whereabouts of a flying thief. He looks round him\r\non all sides, ready to start off at the sound of an advancing\r\nfootstep, trembling at the thought of a possible ambush. How can one\r\ncatch him who, like the wind, tarries never in one place? Go forth,\r\nthen, under the starry skies; watch diligently with all the birds of\r\nnight, and as they seek their food in the darkness so do you therein\r\nhunt for fame.\r\n\r\n'Let there be no corruption, no deeds of darkness which the day need\r\nblush for. Do this, and you will have our support in upholding the\r\nrightful privileges of yourself and your staff.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8. FORMULA OF THE PRAEFECT OF THE WATCH OF THE CITY OF RAVENNA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praefectus Vigilum Urbis Ravennatis.]\r\n\r\nContains the same topics as the preceding formula, rather less\r\nforcibly urged, and with no special reference to the City of Ravenna.\r\n\r\nAn exhortation at the end not to be too hasty, nor to shed blood\r\nneedlessly, even when dealing with thieves.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF PORTUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Portus Urbis Romae.]\r\n\r\n'It is a service of pleasure rather than of toil to hold the dignity\r\nof Comes in the harbour of the City of Rome, to look forth upon the\r\nwide sail-traversed main, to see the commerce of all the Provinces\r\ntending towards Rome, and to welcome travellers arriving with the joy\r\nof ended peril. Excellent thought of the men of old to provide two\r\nchannels by which strangers might enter the Tiber, and to adorn them\r\nwith those two stately cities [Portus and Ostia], which shine like\r\nlights upon the watery way!\r\n\r\n'Do you therefore, by your fair administration, make it easy for\r\nstrangers to enter. Do not grasp at more than the lawful dues; for the\r\ngreedy hand closes a harbour, and extortion is as much dreaded by\r\nmariners as adverse winds. Receive then for this Indiction the\r\n_Comitiva Portus_; enjoy the pleasures of the office, and lay it down\r\nwith increased reputation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n10.

Thus respectability\r\ngoverns those who are not respectable, and people who are themselves\r\nignorant of the path of virtue are nevertheless obliged to live under\r\nsome sort of rule. Your place, in fact, is like that of a guardian; as\r\nhe looks after the tender years of his ward, so you bridle the\r\npassionate pleasures of your theatrical subjects.\r\n\r\n'Therefore, for this Indiction, we appoint you Tribune of [the\r\npeople's] Pleasures. See that order is observed at the public\r\nspectacles: they are not really popular without this. Keep your own\r\nhigh character for purity in dealing with these men and women of\r\ndamaged reputation, that men may say, \"Even in promoting the pleasures\r\nof the people he showed his virtuous disposition.\"\r\n\r\n'It is our hope that through this frivolous employment you may pass to\r\nmore serious dignities.'\r\n\r\n\r\n11. FORMULA OF THE DEFENSOR OF ANY CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defensor cujuslibet Civitatis.]\r\n\r\n[Observe that the Defensor has power to fix prices, in addition to his\r\noriginal function of protecting the commonalty from oppression.]\r\n\r\n'The number of his clients makes it necessary for the representative\r\nof a whole city to be especially wary in his conduct.\r\n\r\n'At the request of your fellow-citizens we appoint you, for this\r\nIndiction, Defensor of such and such a city. Take care that there be\r\nnothing venal in your conduct. Fix the prices for the citizens\r\naccording to the goodness or badness of the seasons, and remember to\r\npay yourself what you have prescribed to others. A good Defensor\r\nallows his citizens neither to be oppressed by the laws nor harassed\r\nby the dearness of provisions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n12. FORMULA OF THE CURATOR OF A CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Curator Civitatis.]\r\n\r\n[The Defensor and Curator had evidently almost equivalent powers, but\r\nwith some slight difference of dignity. They cannot both have existed\r\nin the same city. It would be interesting to know what decided the\r\nquestion whether a city should have a Defensor or a Curator.]\r\n\r\nThis formula differs very little from the preceding, except that the\r\nnew officer is told 'wisely to govern the ranks of the Curia.' Stress\r\nis again laid on the regulation of prices: 'Cause moderate prices to\r\nbe adhered to by those whom it concerns. Let not merchandise be in the\r\nsole power of the sellers, but let an agreeable equability be observed\r\nin all things. This is the most enriching kind of popularity, which is\r\nderived from maintaining moderation in prices[474]. You shall have the\r\nsame salary (consuetudines) which your predecessors had in the same\r\nplace.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: 'Opulentissima siquidem et hinc gratia civium\r\ncolligitur, si pretia sub moderatione serventur.']\r\n\r\n\r\n13. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Romana.]\r\n\r\n'If even bolts and bars cannot secure a house from robbery, much more\r\ndo the precious things left in the streets and open spaces of Rome\r\nrequire protection. I refer to that most abundant population of\r\nstatues, to that mighty herd of horses [in stone and metal] which\r\nadorn our City. It is true that if there were any reverence in human\r\nnature, it, and not the watchman, ought to be the sufficient guardian\r\nof the beauty of Rome[475]. But what shall we say of the marbles,\r\nprecious both by material and workmanship, which many a hand longs, if\r\nit has opportunity, to pick out of their settings? Who when entrusted\r\nwith such a charge can be negligent? who venal? We entrust to you\r\ntherefore for this Indiction the dignity of the Comitiva Romana, with\r\nall its rights and just emoluments. Watch for all such evil-doers as\r\nwe have described. Rightly does the public grief[476] punish those who\r\nmar the beauty of the ancients with amputation of limbs, inflicting on\r\nthem that which they have made our monuments to suffer. Do you and\r\nyour staff and the soldiers at your disposal watch especially by\r\nnight; in the day the City guards itself. At night the theft looks\r\ntempting; but the rascal who tries it is easily caught if the guardian\r\napproaches him unperceived. Nor are the statues absolutely dumb; the\r\nringing sound which they give forth under the blows of the thief seems\r\nto admonish their drowsy guardian. Let us see you then diligent in\r\nthis business, that whereas we now bestow upon you a toilsome dignity,\r\nwe may hereafter confer an honour without care.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: 'Si esset humanis rebus ulla consideratio Romanam\r\npulchritudinem non vigiliae sed sola deberet reverentia custodire.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: 'Quia juste tales persequitur publicus dolor.']\r\n\r\n\r\n14. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF RAVENNA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Ravennatis.]\r\n\r\n'High is your honour, to be the means of taking away all slowness from\r\nthe execution of our orders. Who knows not what a quantity of ships\r\nyou can muster at the least hint from us! Scarcely is the ink dry on\r\nthe _evectio_ [permission to use the public post] prepared by some\r\npalace dignitary, when already with the utmost speed it is by you\r\nbeing carried into effect. Do not exact too much service from\r\nmerchants[477], nor yet from corrupt motives let them off too easily.\r\nBe very careful in your judicial capacity, and especially when trying\r\nthe causes of the poor, to whom a small error in your judgment may be\r\nfar more disastrous than to the rich.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: 'Negociatorum operas consuetas nec nimias exigas, nec\r\nvenalitate derelinquas.' Apparently then a certain amount of forced\r\nlabour could be claimed from the owners of merchant-vessels by the\r\nCount of Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. FORMULA ADDRESSED TO THE PRAEFECT OF THE CITY ON THE APPOINTMENT\r\nOF AN ARCHITECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Architectus Publicorum.]\r\n\r\n'It is desirable that the necessary repairs to this forest of walls\r\nand population of statues which make up Rome should be in the hands of\r\na learned man who will make the new work harmonise with the old.\r\nTherefore for this Indiction we desire your Greatness to appoint A B\r\nArchitect of the City of Rome. Let him read the books of the ancients;\r\nbut he will find more in this City than in his books. Statues of men,\r\nshowing the muscles swelling with effort, the nerves in tension, the\r\nwhole man looking as if he had grown rather than been cast in metal.\r\nStatues of horses, full of fire, with the curved nostril, with rounded\r\ntightly-knit limbs, with ears laid back--you would think the creature\r\nlonged for the race, though you know that the metal moves not. This\r\nart of statuary the Etruscans are said to have practised first in\r\nItaly; posterity has embraced it, and given to the City an artificial\r\npopulation almost equal to its natural one. The ancients speak of the\r\nwonders of the world [here enumerated and described], but this one of\r\nthe City of Rome surpasses them all. It had need to be a learned man\r\nwho is charged with the care of upholding all these works; else, in\r\nhis despair, he will deem himself the man of stone, and the statues\r\nabout him the truly living men.'\r\n\r\n\r\n16. FORMULA OF THE COUNT OF THE ISLANDS OF CURRITANA AND CELSINA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva Insulae Curritanae et Celsinae.]\r\n\r\n[Celsina, from the place in which it is mentioned in the 'Itinerary'\r\nof Antonine (516), was probably one of the Lipari Islands. Curritana\r\nmust have been near it but is not further identified.]\r\n\r\n'The presence of a ruler is necessary; and it is not desirable that\r\nmen should live without discipline, according to their own wills. We\r\ntherefore appoint you Judge of these two islands. For it is right that\r\nsomeone should go to the habitations of these men, who are shut out\r\nfrom converse with the rest of their kind, and settle their\r\ndifferences by fair reason.\r\n\r\n'Oh ye inhabitants of these islands, ye now know whom our Piety has\r\nset over you, and we shall expect you to obey him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n17. FORMULA CONCERNING THE PRESIDENT OF THE LIME-KILNS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praepositus Calcis.]\r\n\r\n'It is a glorious labour to serve the City of Rome. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that lime (coctilis calx), which is snow-white and lighter\r\nthan sponge, is useful for the mightiest buildings. In proportion as\r\nit is itself disintegrated by the application of fire does it lend\r\nstrength to walls; a dissolvable rock, a stony softness, a sandy\r\npebble, which burns the best when it is most abundantly watered,\r\nwithout which neither stones are fixed nor the minute particles of\r\nsand hardened.\r\n\r\n'Therefore we set you, well known for your industry, over the burning\r\nand distribution of lime, that there may be plenty of it both for\r\npublic and private works, and that thereby people may be put in good\r\nheart for building. Do this well, and you shall be promoted to greater\r\nthings.'\r\n\r\n\r\n18. FORMULA CONCERNING ARMOURERS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Armorum Factores.]\r\n\r\n'Good arms are of the utmost importance to a community. By means of\r\nthem man, the frailest of creatures, is made stronger than monstrous\r\nbeasts. Phoroneus is said to have first invented them, and brought\r\nthem to Juno to consecrate them by her divinity.\r\n\r\n'For this Indiction we set you over the soldiers and workmen in our\r\narmouries. Do not presume in our absence to pass bad workmanship. We\r\nshall find out by diligent search all that you do, and in such a\r\nmatter as this consider no mistake venial.'\r\n\r\n\r\n19. FORMULA ADDRESSED TO THE PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT CONCERNING THE\r\nARMOURERS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ad Praefectum Praetorio de Armorum Factoribus.]\r\n\r\nAnnounces to the Praefects the appointment conferred in the preceding\r\nletter, and repeats that to supply inferior arms to soldiers is an act\r\nof treason. The workmen are to receive their just _consuetudines_\r\n[wages].\r\n\r\n\r\n20 and 21. FORMULA AS TO THE COLLECTION OF BINA AND TERNA:\r\n\r\n     (1) _If collected by the Judge himself;_\r\n     (2) _If collected by his Officium._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Binorum et Ternorum: (xx.) si per Judicem aguntur; (xxi.)\r\nsi per Officium aguntur.]\r\n\r\nThese _Bina_ and _Terna_, as stated in the note to iii. 8, are a\r\nmystery. All that can be positively stated about them is that they\r\nwere a kind of land-tax, collected from the cultivators (possessores),\r\nand that they had to be brought into the Treasury by the first of\r\nMarch in each year. Under the first formula the Judex himself, under\r\nthe second two _Scriniarii_ superintend the collection, reporting to\r\nthe Count of Sacred Largesses. As in the previous letter (iii. 8), the\r\nJudex is reminded that if there is any deficiency he will have to make\r\nit good himself. Cf. Manso, 'Geschichte des Ostgothischen Reiches'\r\n388; and Sartorius, 'Regierung der Ostgothen' 207 and 347.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. FORMULA OF EXHORTATION ADDRESSED TO THE TWO SCRINIARII REFERRED TO\r\nIN FORMULA 21.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commonitorium illi et illi Scriniariis.]\r\n\r\n'Your day of promotion is come. Proceed to such and such a Province,\r\nin order that you may assist the Judex and his staff in collecting the\r\n_Bina_ and _Terna_, before the first of March, and may forward them\r\nwithout delay to the Count of Sacred Largesses. Let there be no\r\nextortion from the cultivator, no dishonest surrender of our rights.'\r\n\r\n\r\n23. FORMULA OF THE VICARIUS OF PORTUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vicarius Portus.]\r\n\r\n'Great prudence is necessary in your office, since discords easily\r\narise between two nationalities. Therefore you must use skill to\r\nsoothe those [the Greek merchants and sailors from the Levant] whose\r\ncharacters are unstable as the winds, and who, unless you bring their\r\nminds into a state of calm, will, with their natural quickness of\r\ntemper, fly out into the extremity of insolence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n24. FORMULA OF THE PRINCEPS OF DALMATIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Princeps Dalmatiarum.]\r\n\r\n[The Princeps, as observed on p. 96, seems to have practically\r\ndisappeared from the Officium of the Praefectus Praetorio. Here,\r\nhowever, we find a Provincial Princeps whose rank and functions are\r\nnot a little perplexing. It seems probable that, while still nominally\r\nonly the chief of a staff of subordinates, he may, owing to the\r\ncharacter of the superior under whom he served, have practically\r\nassumed more important functions. That superior in this case was a\r\nComes, whose military character is indicated by the first letter of\r\nthis book. The Princeps was therefore virtually the Civil Assessor of\r\nthis officer.\r\n\r\nThe Comes under Theodoric would generally be a Goth; the Princeps must\r\nbe a Roman and a Jurisconsult. The business of the former was war and\r\nadministration; that of the latter, judgment, though his decisions\r\nwere apparently pronounced by the mouth of the Comes, his superior in\r\nrank.]\r\n\r\n'Whosoever serves while bearing the title of Princeps has high\r\npre-eminence among his colleagues. To the Consul of the Provinces\r\npower is given, but to you the Judge himself is entrusted. Without you\r\nthere is no access to the Secretarium, nor is the ceremony of\r\nsalutation[478] [by subordinate officers] performed. You hold the\r\nvine-rod[479] which menaces the wicked; you have the right, withheld\r\nfrom the Governor himself, of punishing the insolence of an orator\r\npleading in his Court. The records of the whole suit have to be signed\r\nby you, and for this your consent is sought after the will of the\r\nJudge has been explained.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: 'Pompa osculationis.' Another reading is 'Pompa\r\npostulationis.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: 'Tu vitem tenes improbis minantem.' The allusion is to\r\nthe vine-bough, which was used in scourging. The alternative reading,\r\n_vitam_, does not seem to give so good a sense.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. FORMULA RECOMMENDING THE PRINCIPES[480] TO THE COMES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: Plural. Apparently, therefore, each Count had more than\r\none Princeps, perhaps one for each large city in his Province.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ad Commendandos Comiti Principes.]\r\n\r\n'It is our glory to see you [a Goth, one of our own nation]\r\naccompanied by a Roman official staff. Acting through such Ministers,\r\nyour power seems to be hallowed by the sanction of Antiquity.\r\n\r\n'For to this point, by God's help, have we brought our Goths, that\r\nthey should be both well-trained in arms and attuned to justice. It is\r\nthis which the other races cannot accomplish; this that makes you\r\nunique among the nations, namely, that you, who are accustomed to war,\r\nare seen to live obedient to the laws side by side with the Romans.\r\nTherefore from out of our _Officium_, we have decided to send A and B\r\nto you, that according to ancient custom, while forwarding the\r\nexecution of your commands they may bring those commands into\r\nconformity with the mind of past ages[481].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: 'Rationabili debeant antiquitate moderari.' Perhaps we\r\nmight translate, 'with the Common Law.']\r\n\r\n\r\n26. FORMULA OF THE COUNTSHIP OF THE SECOND RANK IN DIVERS CITIES[482].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: The title runs thus (in Nivellius' Edition): 'Formula\r\nComitivae Honorum Scientiae Ordinis diversarum Civitatum.' I do not\r\nknow what is meant by 'Honorum Scientiae.' Can 'Scientiae' be a\r\ntranscriber's blunder for 'secundi?']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comitiva diversarum civitatum.]\r\n\r\nFor the sentences, more than usually devoid of meaning, in which\r\nCassiodorus dilates on Free-will, Justice, and the mind of man, it may\r\nbe well to substitute Manso's description of this dignity (p. 379):\r\n\r\n'By the title of a Count of the Second Order the Judges in little\r\ntowns appear chiefly to have been rewarded and encouraged. Those named\r\nfor it, however, can hardly have received any great distinction or\r\nespecial privileges, for Cassiodorus not only enumerates no civic\r\nadvantages thus secured to them, but expressly says, \"We intend to\r\nbestow better things than this upon you, if you earn our approbation\r\nin your present office.\" He does not use this language to those\r\nadorned with the _Comitiva Primi Ordinis_.'\r\n\r\n\r\n27. FORMULA ADDRESSED TO THE DIGNIFIED CULTIVATORS AND CURIALES[483].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: Cf. vi. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honorati Possessores et Curiales.]\r\n\r\n'As one must rule and the rest obey, we have for this Indiction\r\nconferred the Countship of your City on A B, that he may hear your\r\ncauses and give effect to our orders.'\r\n\r\n[Apparently this letter and the preceding relate to the same\r\nappointment. The words 'secundi ordinis' are not added to the title of\r\nthe new Count when his fellow-citizens are informed of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. FORMULA ANNOUNCING THE APPOINTMENT OF A COMES TO THE CHIEF OF HIS\r\nSTAFF[484].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: This must, I think, be the meaning; but it is hard to\r\nextract it from the words 'Formula Principis Militum Comitivae.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Princeps Militum Comitivae.]\r\n\r\n'Judge and Court Officer (Praesul and Miles) are terms which involve\r\none another. The officers of the Court have no right to exist,\r\nwithout the Judge; he is powerless without them to execute his\r\ncommands. We therefore think it well to inform you of our appointment\r\nof A B as Count over your body[485]. It is no light benefit that so\r\nlong as you attend to your duty[486] you are allowed to elect the\r\nexaminers.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: 'Comitem Militiae Vestrae.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: 'Nec istud leve credatis beneficium, ut cum vos scitis\r\nobsequium, vobis occurrat electio cognitorum.' For Cognitores, see\r\nvii. 3. These Cognitores had virtually the decision of all 'issues of\r\nfact,' and consequently their nomination was a very important matter.\r\nI think the meaning of this passage is: 'I, the King, appoint the\r\n_Comes_ (= Judex), and graciously inform you of my decision. But you\r\n(the Officium) have the privilege--and it is no small one--of electing\r\nthe _Cognitores_.']\r\n\r\n\r\n29. FORMULA CONCERNING THE GUARD AT THE GATES OF A CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: De Custodiendis Portis Civitatis.]\r\n\r\n'We entrust to you an important office, the care of the gate of such\r\nand such a city. Do not keep it always shut--that were to turn the\r\ncity into a prison; nor let it always lie open--then the walls are\r\nuseless. Use your own judgment, but remember that the gate of a city\r\nis like the jaws of the human body, through which provisions enter to\r\nnourish it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n30. FORMULA OF THE TRIBUNATE IN THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tribunatus Provinciarum.]\r\n\r\n'It is right that one who has served his time in civil employment\r\nshould receive his reward, and we therefore appoint as your Tribune\r\nthe man who has a right to the office by seniority. You are to obey\r\nhim, since officers of this kind partake of the nature of Judges\r\n[governors], as they are called to account for any excesses committed\r\nby you.'\r\n\r\n[Who this Tribune was--since the _Tribunus Voluptatum_ is apparently\r\nout of the question--and how his jurisdiction fitted in to that of\r\nother officers, Manso (p. 362) deems it impossible to decide, nor can\r\nI offer any suggestion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. FORMULA OF THE PRINCEPS OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formula Principatus Urbis Romae.]\r\n\r\n'As there must be the _Officium_, of a Count in Rome, and as we want\r\nto have our chief Princeps[487] near us [in Ravenna], we wish you to\r\ntake his place and wield power as his _Vicarius_ in Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: 'Principem nostrum _cardinalem_' (observe this use of\r\nthe word).]\r\n\r\n'If you think that any of the _Comitiaci_ ought to be sent to attend\r\nour Comitatus [at Ravenna], do so at your own discretion, retaining\r\nthose whom you think proper to retain at Rome. Let there be an\r\nalternation, however, that one set of men be not worn out with\r\ncontinuous labour, while the others are rusting in idleness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n32. FORMULA OF THE MASTER OF THE MINT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formula qua Moneta Committitur.]\r\n\r\n'Great is the crime of tampering with the coinage; a crime against the\r\nmany--whose buying and selling is disturbed by it; and a crime and a\r\nsacrilege against us, whose image is impressed on the coins.\r\n\r\n'Let everything be pure and unalloyed which bears the impress of our\r\nSerenity. Let the flame of gold be pale and unmixed, let the colour of\r\nsilver smile with its gracious whiteness, let the ruddy copper retain\r\nits native glow.\r\n\r\n'Coins are to keep their full weight. They used to pass current by\r\nweight, not by tale, whence the words for profit and expenditure[488].\r\n_Pecunia_ was named from cattle (pecus). You must see that our money\r\ndoes not return to this low condition. King Servius first used\r\nstamped money. Take then the care of the mint; hold it for five years,\r\nand be very careful how you administer it.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: 'Compendium et dispendium' (from _pendere_, to weigh).]\r\n\r\n\r\n33. FORMULA RESPECTING THE AMBASSADORS OF VARIOUS NATIONS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formula Legatorum Gentium Diversarum.]\r\n\r\n'Since it is important that when ambassadors return to their country\r\nthey should feel that they have been well treated in ours, hand the\r\nenclosed _douceur_ (humanitas), and a certain quantity of fodder for\r\ntheir horses, to the ambassadors of such and such a nation. Nothing\r\npleases those who have commenced their return journey better than\r\nspeeding them on their way.'\r\n\r\n\r\n34. FORMULA OF SUMMONS TO THE KING'S COURT (UNSOLICITED).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formula Evocatoria quam Princeps dirigit.]\r\n\r\n'We summon you by these presents to our Comitatus, that you may have\r\nan extraordinary pleasure. Be brisk therefore, and come on such a day\r\nto such a city. Our Palace longs for the presence of good men, and God\r\nputs it into our hearts to give them a cordial reception.'\r\n\r\n\r\n35. FORMULA OF SUMMONS TO THE COURT (SOLICITED).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formula Evocatoria quae petenti conceditur.]\r\n\r\n'It is a sign of a good conscience to seek the presence of a just\r\nruler; it is only good deeds that crave the light of the sun.

But we gladly give you this holiday, not\r\nthat Rome should be deserted, but that absence from her may commend\r\nher to you all the more.'\r\n\r\n\r\n37. FORMULA CONFERRING THE RANK OF A SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spectabilitas.]\r\n\r\n'Wishing to bestow the right honours on the right man among our\r\nsubjects, we decorate you with the splendour of a _Spectabilis_, that\r\nyou may know that your opinion is duly respected[489] at all public\r\nmeeting-places, when you take your honoured seat among the nobles.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: 'Spectandam,' an allusion to the derivation of\r\n_spectabilis_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n38. FORMULA CONFERRING THE RANK OF A CLARISSIMUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clarissimatus.]\r\n\r\n'The desire of praise is a good thing, and leads to the increase of\r\nvirtue. Receive the honour of the _Clarissimatus_, as a testimony to\r\nthe excellence of your past life and a pledge of your future\r\nprosperity.

FORMULA BESTOWING 'POLICE PROTECTION.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tuitio Regii nominis.]\r\n\r\n'Though it seems superfluous to grant special protection to any of our\r\nsubjects, since all are shielded by the laws, yet moved by your cry\r\nfor help we are willing to relieve you and to give you as a strong\r\ntower of defence the shelter of our name[490], into which you may\r\nretire when wounded by the assaults of your enemies. This defence will\r\navail you alike against the hot-headed onslaughts [of the Goths] and\r\nthe ruinous chicanery [of the Romans][491]; but you must beware that\r\nyou, who have thus had to solicit the help of the law, do not yourself\r\nset law at defiance by refusing to appear in answer to a summons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: 'Tuitio nostri nominis.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: 'Validissimam turrem contra inciviles impetus et\r\nconventionalia detrimenta.']\r\n\r\n'That our royal protection be not a mere name, we appoint A and B to\r\nprotect you by their fidelity and diligence, the former against the\r\nGoths, and the latter against the Romans[492].

I am not sure that he is right\r\nin stating that _Tuitio_ against a Goth would _necessarily_ be given\r\nby means of a Sajo, though evidently this was often the rank of the\r\nofficer employed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n40.

You must exhibit that steadfastness of character\r\nwhich you claim. You say that you will not be caught by the snares of\r\ndesigning men; and you must remember that now to deny the fulfilment\r\nof your promise will become a much more serious matter than\r\nheretofore.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 493: 'Ut in foro competenti ea quae in his causis reverenda\r\nlegum dictat Antiquitas solenniter actitentur.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 494: 'Ita ut in alienandis rusticis vel urbanis praediis\r\nconstitutionum servitus auctoritas.']\r\n\r\n\r\n42.

We are told that the valour of the Sajo is employed not\r\nmerely for the protection of him to whom he is assigned, but for\r\nillegal violence and rapine against that person's enemies. Thus our\r\nremedy becomes itself a disease. To guard against this perversion of\r\nour beneficent designs we ordain that anyone asking for the\r\nguardianship of a brave Sajo against violence with which he feels\r\nhimself unable to cope, shall give a penal bond to our Officium, with\r\nthis condition, that if the Sajo[495] who is assigned to him shall\r\nexceed our orders by any improper violence, he himself shall pay by\r\nway of fine so many pounds of gold, and shall make satisfaction for\r\nthe damage sustained by his adversary as well as for the expenses of\r\nhis journey [to obtain redress]. For our wish is to repress uncivil\r\ndispositions, not to injure the innocent. As for the Sajo who shall\r\nhave wilfully transgressed the limit of our commands, he shall lose\r\nhis donative, and--which is the heaviest of all punishments--our\r\nfavour also.

FORMULA ADDRESSED TO THE PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT DIRECTING THE SALE OF\r\nTHE PROPERTY OF A CURIALIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formula ad Praefectum, ut sub decreto Curialis praedia\r\nvendat.]\r\n\r\n'It is the hard lot of human nature often to be injured by the very\r\nthings which were intended as remedies. The prohibition against the\r\nsale of the property of a Curialis was intended for his protection,\r\nand to enable him fearlessly to discharge his share of the public\r\nburdens. In some cases, however, where he has contracted large debts,\r\nthis prohibition simply prevents him from saving anything out of the\r\ngulf of indebtedness. You have the power, after making due enquiry\r\ninto the circumstances, to authorise the sale of such a property. You\r\nhave the power; but as the proceeding is an unusual one, to guard you\r\nagainst any odium to which it may expose you, we fortify your Eminence\r\nby this our present command. Let the Curialis who petitions for this\r\nrelief satisfy you as to the cause of his losses, that it may be shown\r\nthat they are really the result of circumstances beyond his own\r\ncontrol, not due to his own bad character.\r\n\r\n'Wisely has Antiquity laid upon _you_ the responsibility of deciding\r\ncases of this kind, you whose advantage lies in the maintenance of the\r\nCuria.

KING ATHALARIC TO THE EMPEROR JUSTIN (A.D. 526).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The accession of Athalaric announced to the Emperor\r\nJustin.]\r\n\r\n[Some MSS. read Justiniano, but there can be no doubt that Justino is\r\nthe right reading. Athalaric's accession took place August 30, 526;\r\nthe death of Justin, August 1, 527. Justinian was associated with his\r\nuncle in the Empire, April 1, 527.]\r\n\r\n'Most earnestly do I seek your friendship, oh most clement of Princes,\r\nwho are made even more illustrious by the wide extension of your\r\nfavours than by the purple robe and the kingly throne. On this\r\nfriendship I have an hereditary claim. My father was adorned by you\r\nwith the palm-enwoven robe of the Consul [Eutharic, Consul 519] and\r\nadopted as a son in arms, a name which I, as one of a younger\r\ngeneration, could more fittingly receive[501]. My grandfather also\r\nreceived curule honours from you[502] in your city. Love and\r\nfriendship should pass from parents to their offspring, while hatred\r\nshould be buried in the tomb; and therefore with confidence, as one\r\nwho by reason of my tender years cannot be an object of suspicion to\r\nyou, and as one whose ancestors you have already known and cherished,\r\nI claim from you your friendship on the same compacts and conditions\r\non which your renowned predecessors granted it to my lord and\r\ngrandfather of Divine memory[503]. It will be to me something better\r\nthan dominion to have the friendship of so excellent and so mighty a\r\nruler. My ambassadors (A and B) will open the purport of their\r\ncommission more fully to your Serenity.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 501: The text is evidently corrupt here: 'Genitor meus\r\ndesiderio quoque concordiae factus est per arma filius, quia unis\r\nnobis pene videbatur aequaevus.'

KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME ON HIS ACCESSION\r\n(A.D. 526).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the Senate.]\r\n\r\n'Great must be the joy of all orders of the State at hearing of the\r\naccession of a new ruler, above all of a peaceful succession, without\r\nwar, without sedition, without loss of any kind to the Republic.\r\n\r\n'Such has been our succession to our grandfather. On account of the\r\nglory of the Amal race, which yields to none[504], the hope of our\r\nyouth has been preferred to the merits of all others. The chiefs,\r\nglorious in council and in war, have flocked to recognise us as King\r\nso gladly, so unmurmuringly, that it seems like a Divine inspiration,\r\nand the kingdom has been changed as one changes a garment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: 'Quoniam quaevis claritas generis Amalis cedit.']\r\n\r\n'The institution of royalty is consolidated when power thus passes\r\nfrom one generation to another, and when a good prince lives again,\r\nnot in statues of brass but in the lineaments and the character of his\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\n'The general consent of Goths and Romans [at Ravenna] has crowned us\r\nKing, and they have confirmed their allegiance by an oath. You, though\r\nseparated from us by space, are, we know, as near to us in heart as\r\nthey; and we call upon you therefore to follow their example. We all\r\nknow that the most excellent fathers of the Senate love their King\r\nmore fervently than other ranks of the State, in proportion to the\r\ngreater benefits which they have received at his hand.\r\n\r\n'And since one should never enter your Curia empty-handed, we have\r\nsent our Count, the Illustrious Sigismer, with certain persons to\r\nadminister the oath to you. If you have any requests to make to us\r\nwhich shall be for the common benefit of the Republic, make them\r\nthrough him, and they are granted beforehand.'\r\n\r\n\r\n3. KING ATHALARIC TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE (A.D. 526).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the citizens of Rome.]\r\n\r\n'If a stranger to the royal line were succeeding to the throne, you\r\nmight doubt whether the friendship between him and you would endure,\r\nand might look for a reversal of the policy of his predecessors. But\r\nnow the person of the King only, not his policy, is changed. We are\r\ndetermined to follow the revered maxims of our predecessor, and to\r\nload with even more abundant benefits those whom he most kindly\r\ndefended.\r\n\r\n'Everything was so ordered by our glorious grandfather that on his\r\ndeath the glad consent of Goths called us to our kingdom; and that no\r\ndoubt might remain upon the matter they pledged themselves by an oath\r\nmost cordially taken, to accept us as their ruler. We invite you to\r\nfollow their example, and like Trajan, we, the Sovereign, in whose\r\nname all oaths are made, will also swear to you. The bearers of this\r\nletter will receive your sworn promise, and will give you ours, \"by\r\nthe Lord's help to observe justice and fair clemency, the nourisher of\r\nthe nations; that Goths and Romans shall meet with impartial\r\ntreatment at our hands; and that there shall be no other division\r\nbetween the two nations, except that _they_ undergo the labours of war\r\nfor the common benefit, while _you_ are increased in numbers by your\r\npeaceable inhabitancy of the City of Rome[505].\" Raise then your\r\nspirits, and hope for even better things and more tranquillity, under\r\nGod's blessing, from our reign than from that of our predecessor.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: 'Justitiam nos et aequabilem clementiam, quae populos\r\nnutrit, juvante domino, custodire et _Gothis Romanisque apud nos jus\r\nesse commune_, nec aliud inter vos esse divisum, nisi quod illi\r\nlabores bellicos pro communi utilitate subeunt, vos autem civitatis\r\nRomanae habitatio quieta multiplicat.' I do not consider that the\r\nwords in Italics, taken with the context, are irreconcilable with\r\nDahn's view that the Goths were still, to a certain extent, under\r\nGothic law.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KING ATHALARIC TO ALL THE ROMANS SETTLED IN ITALY AND THE DALMATIAS\r\n(A.D. 526).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the Romans in Italy and Dalmatia.]\r\n\r\n'He who hears of a change in the ruler is apt to fear that it may be a\r\nchange for the worse; and a new King who makes no kind promises at his\r\naccession is supposed to be harbouring designs of severity. We\r\ntherefore inform you that we have received the oaths of Goths and\r\nRomans and are ready to receive yours, which we doubt not you will\r\nwillingly offer.' [The rest as in the preceding letters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING ATHALARIC TO ALL THE GOTHS SETTLED IN ITALY (A.D. 526).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the Goths.]\r\n\r\n'Gladly would we have announced to you the prolonged life of our lord\r\nand grandfather; but inasmuch as he has been withdrawn by hard fate\r\nfrom us who loved him, he has substituted us, by Divine command, as\r\nheirs of his kingdom, that through us his successors in blood, he\r\nmight make the benefits which he has conferred on you perpetual. And\r\nin truth we hope not only to defend but to increase the blessings\r\nwrought by him. All the Goths in the Royal City [Ravenna] have taken\r\nthe oaths to us. Do you do the same by this Count whom we send to you.\r\n\r\n'Receive then a name which ever brought prosperity to your race, the\r\nroyal offshoot of the Amals, the sprout of the Balthae[506], a\r\nchildhood clad in purple. Ye are they by whom, with God's help, our\r\nancestors were borne to such a height of honour, and obtained an ever\r\nhigher place amid the serried ranks of kings[507].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: 'Amalorum regalem prosapiem, Baltheum germen.' I know\r\nnot how Athalaric had any blood of the Balths in his veins. The other\r\nreading, 'blatteum,' gives the same idea as the following clause,\r\n'infantiam purpuratam.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: 'Inter tam prolixum ordinem Regum susceperunt semper\r\naugmenta.' Perhaps we should translate 'by such a long line of (Amal)\r\nkings obtained advancement for their nation;' but the meaning is not\r\nvery clear.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING ATHALARIC TO LIBERIUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT OF THE GAULS (A.D.\r\n526).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the Governor of Gaul.]\r\n\r\n'You will be grieved to hear of the death of our lord and grandfather\r\nof glorious memory, but will be comforted in learning that he is\r\nsucceeded by his descendant. Thus, by God's command, did he arrange\r\nmatters, associating us as lords in the throne of his royalty, in\r\norder that he might leave his kingdom at peace, and that no revolution\r\nmight trouble it after his death.'\r\n\r\n[Invitation to take the oath, as in previous letters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. KING ATHALARIC TO ALL THE PROVINCIALS SETTLED IN GAUL (A.D. 526).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the Gaulish subjects of Athalaric.]\r\n\r\n'Our grandfather of glorious memory is dead, but we have succeeded\r\nhim, and will faithfully repay, both on his account and our own, the\r\nloyalty of our subjects.\r\n\r\n'So unanimous was the acclamation of our [Italian] subjects when we\r\nsucceeded to the throne, that the thing seemed to be of God rather\r\nthan of man.\r\n\r\n'We now invite you to follow their example, that the Goths may give\r\ntheir oath to the Romans, and the Romans may confirm it by a\r\n_Sacramentum_ to the Goths, that they are unanimously devoted to our\r\nKing.'\r\n\r\n'Thus will your loyalty be made manifest, and concord and justice\r\nflourish among you.'\r\n\r\n[There is an appearance of mutuality about this oath of allegiance as\r\nbetween Goths and Romans, not merely by both to Athalaric, which we\r\nhave not had in the previous letters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KING ATHALARIC TO VICTORINUS, VIR VENERABILIS AND BISHOP[508] (A.D.\r\n526).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: Baronius says (vii. 121): 'Cujusnam Ecclesiae Antistes\r\nfuerit Victorinus ignoratur.' From the tone of the letter one may\r\nconjecture that Victorinus was a Bishop in Gaul.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Bishop Victorinus.]\r\n\r\n'Saluting you with all the veneration due to your character and\r\noffice, we inform you with grief of the death of our lord and\r\ngrandfather. But your sadness will be moderated when you hear that his\r\nkingdom is continued in us. Favour us with your prayers, that the King\r\nof Heaven may confirm to us the kingdom, subdue foreign nations before\r\nus, forgive us our sins, and propitiously preserve all that He was\r\npleased to bestow on our ancestors. Let your Holiness exhort all the\r\nProvincials to concord.'\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING ATHALARIC TO TULUM, PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of Tulum, who is raised to the Patriciate.]\r\n\r\n'As our grandfather used to refresh his mind and strengthen his\r\njudgment by intercourse with you, so, _à fortiori_, may we in our\r\ntender years do the same. We therefore make you, by this present\r\nletter, Patrician, that the counsels which you give us may not seem to\r\nproceed from any unknown and obscure source.\r\n\r\n'Greece adorned our hero [Tulum] with the chlamys and the painted\r\nsilken buskin; and the Eastern peoples yearned to see him, because\r\nfor some reason civic virtues are most prized in him who is believed\r\nto be of warlike disposition[509]. Contented with this repayment of\r\nhonour he laboured with unwearied devotion for foreign countries (?),\r\nand with his relations (or parents) he deigned to offer his obedience\r\nto the Sovereign, who was begotten of the stock of so many Kings[510].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: Probably Tulum had gone on some embassy to\r\nConstantinople.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: 'Hac igitur honoris remuneratione contentus, pro\r\nexteris partibus indefessa devotione laboravit: et praestare com suis\r\nparentibus principi dignabatur obsequium, qui tantorum regum fuerat\r\nstirpe procreatus.' This sentence is full of difficulties. What can he\r\nmean by the labour 'pro exteris partibus?' Who is the 'Princeps' whom\r\nTulum deigns to serve: the Eastern Emperor or Theodoric? Above all,\r\nwho is 'tantorum regum stirpe procreatus?' I think the turn of the\r\nsentence requires that it should be Tulum; but Dahn has evidently not\r\nso understood it, for in his Könige der Germanen (iii. 29, 30) he\r\nmakes Tulum a conspicuous example of a man not of noble birth raised\r\nto high dignity, and says that the two long letters about him in the\r\nVariae contain no allusion to illustrious descent.]\r\n\r\n[After some very obscure sentences, in which the writer appears to be\r\ncelebrating the praises of Theodoric, he turns to Tulum, of whom he\r\nhas hitherto spoken in the third person, and addresses him as _you_.]\r\n\r\n'His toil so formed your character that we have the less need to\r\nlabour. With you he discussed the sure blessings of peace, the\r\ndoubtful gains of war; and--rare boon from a wise King--to you, in his\r\nanxiety, he confidently opened all the secrets of his breast. You,\r\nhowever, responded fully to his trust. You never put him off with\r\ndoubtful answers. Ever patient and truthful, you won the entire\r\nconfidence of your King, and dared even, hardest of all tasks, to\r\nargue against him for his own good.\r\n\r\n'Thus did your noble deeds justify your alliance with the Amal race\r\n[apparently he has received an Amal princess in marriage], and thus\r\ndid you become worthy to be joined in common fame with Gensemund, a\r\nman whose praises the whole world should sing, a man only made son by\r\nadoption in arms to the King, yet who exhibited such fidelity to the\r\nAmals that he transferred it even to their heirs, although he was\r\nhimself sought for to be crowned[511]. Therefore will his fame live\r\nfor ever, so long as the Gothic name endures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: 'Exstat gentis Gothicae hujus probitatis exemplum:\r\nGensemundus ille toto orbe cantabilis, solum armis filius factus,\r\ntanta se Amalis devotione conjunxit ut haeredibus eorum curiosum\r\nexhibuerit famulatum, quamvis ipse peteretur ad regnum.' Dahn (ii. 61\r\nand iii. 309) and Köpke (p. 142) refer this mysterious affair of\r\nGensemund's renunciation to the interval after the death of Thorismund\r\n(A.D. 416). But this is mere conjecture. See Italy and her Invaders\r\niii. 8-10.]\r\n\r\n'We look for even nobler things from you, because you are allied to us\r\nby race.'\r\n\r\n[A singularly obscure, vapid, and ill-written letter. The allusion to\r\nGensemund seems introduced on purpose to bewilder the reader.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[On the elevation of Tulum to the Patriciate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We are conferring new lustre on your body by the promotion of Tulum.\r\nA man sprung from the noblest stock[512] he early undertook the duties\r\nof attendance in the King's bedchamber[513], a difficult post, where\r\nthe knowledge that you share the secret counsels of royalty itself\r\nexposes you to enmity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: 'Primum, quod inter nationes eximium est, Gothorum\r\nnobilissima stirpe gloriatur.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: 'Statim rudes annos ad sacri cubiculi secreta\r\nportavit.']\r\n\r\n'In the dawn of manhood he went forth with our army to the war of\r\nSirmium [A.D. 504], showed what one of our young nobles bred in peace\r\ncould do in war, triumphed over the Huns[514], and gave to slaughter\r\nthe Bulgarians, terrible to the whole world. Such warriors do even our\r\nnurseries send forth: thus does the preparation of a courageous heart\r\nsupersede the necessity for martial training[515].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: We do not hear from the other authorities of Huns being\r\nengaged in this war. In 505 Mundo the Hun was in alliance with\r\nTheodoric against the Empire.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 515: 'Tales mittunt nostra cunabula bellatores: sic paratae\r\nsunt manus, ubi exercetur animus.']\r\n\r\n'Returned to the Court he became the most intimate counsellor of the\r\nKing, who arranged with him all his plans for campaign, and so\r\nadmitted him to his most secret thoughts that Tulum could always\r\nanticipate how Theodoric would act in every fresh conjuncture of\r\nevents; and it may be said \"by offering him counsel he ruled the\r\nKing[516].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 516: 'Et ministrando consilium regebat ipse Rectorem.']\r\n\r\n'He then distinguished himself in the Gaulish campaign [A.D. 508],\r\nwhere he was already enrolled among the generals, directing the\r\ncampaign by his prudence, and bravely sharing its dangers. In the\r\nfierce fight which was waged at Arles for the possession of the\r\ncovered bridge across the Rhone[517], the bravery of our _candidatus_\r\nwas everywhere conspicuous, and he received many honourable wounds,\r\nthose best and most eloquent champions of a soldier's courage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: 'Arelate est civitas supra undas Rhodani constituta,\r\nquae in Orientis prospectum tabulatum pontem per nuncupati fluminis\r\ndorsa transmittit.']\r\n\r\n'But a general ought not to be always fighting. I have pleasure in\r\nrelating his next success, which was brilliant yet achieved without\r\nbloodshed. When the Frank and Burgundian again fell out, he was sent\r\nto Gaul [A.D. 523] to defend our frontier from hostile incursion. He\r\nthen obtained for the Roman Republic, without any trouble, a whole\r\nProvince while others were fighting. It was a triumph without a\r\nbattle, a palm-branch without toil, a victory without slaughter.\r\n\r\n'So great were his services in this campaign that Theodoric considered\r\nthat he ought to be rewarded by the possession of large lands in the\r\ndistrict which he had added to our dominions.\r\n\r\n'A storm overtook him on his return to Italy: the remembrance of the\r\nvanished danger of that storm is sweet to us now[518]. In the wide,\r\nfoaming sea his ship was swallowed up. He had to save himself by\r\nrowing; the sailors perished; he alone with the dear pledge of his\r\nlove [one child?] escaped. Theodoric rushed to the shore, and would\r\nhave dashed into the waves to save his friend, but had the delight of\r\nreceiving him unharmed, saved manifestly by Divine protection for his\r\npresent honours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: 'Discrimina dum feliciter cedunt, suavissimae memoriae\r\nsensum relinquunt.' Compare Claudian (De Bella Getico 207-8):\r\n\r\n    'An potius meminisse juvat semperque vicissim\r\n    Gaudia praemissi cumulant inopina dolores.']\r\n\r\n'Favour then, Conscript Fathers, the ambition of our _candidatus_, and\r\nopen for the man of our choice the Hall of Liberty[519]. The race of\r\nRomulus deserves to have such martial colleagues as Tulum.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: 'Favete nunc auspiciis candidati, et viris nostris\r\nlibertatis atria reserate.']\r\n\r\n\r\n11. TULUM, ILLUSTRIS AND PATRICIAN, TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Note that Cassiodorus has to provide an elegant oration not only for\r\nhis master, but for this Gothic fellow-minister of State. See Dahn's\r\nremarks on the writer of this letter, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 273.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tulum's address to the Senate.]\r\n\r\n'I pray you to receive favourably the order of the King which makes me\r\na member of your body.\r\n\r\n'I have ever favoured the dignity of the Senate, as if with a\r\nprescience that I should one day hold it. When I shared the counsels\r\nof Theodoric, that chief of Kings, of glorious memory, I often by my\r\nintercessions obtained for members of your body Consulships,\r\nPatriciates, Praefectures; and now, behold, I am similarly honoured\r\nmyself. Reflect, I pray, that by my accepting it, the genius of the\r\nPatriciate is exalted, since none of my fellow-countrymen will hold\r\ncheaply that rank in you which he sees honoured in me. Live in\r\nsecurity, by the blessing of God; enjoy your prosperity with your\r\nchildren; and strive, now as always, to show forth the true Roman type\r\nof character. I shall defend those with whom I am now associated.'\r\n\r\n\r\n12. KING ATHALARIC TO ARATOR, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Bestowing on him the rank of Comes Domesticorum.]\r\n\r\n[I have altered the order of subjects in this letter, to make it\r\ncorrespond with that of time. There cannot be much doubt that Arator's\r\n_pomposa legatio_ from Dalmatia was his first introduction to the\r\nCourt of Theodoric, and preceded his employment as Advocatus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arator made Count of the Domestics.]\r\n\r\n'By raising Tulum to the Patriciate we have provided for the military\r\nstrength of the State. Now must we see to it that she is equally\r\nadorned by the glory of letters, and for this purpose we raise you,\r\nstill in the prime of life, to the rank of _Comes Domesticorum_. By\r\nyour example it was seen that eloquence could be acquired elsewhere\r\nthan at Rome, since in your own Province [probably Dalmatia] your\r\nfather, who was an extremely learned man, taught you to excel in this\r\nart: a happy lot for you, who obtained from your father's love that\r\naccomplishment which most youths have to acquire with terror from a\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n'That I may say something here of a very _recherché_ character[520], I\r\nmay mention that, according to some, letters were first invented by\r\nMercury, who watched the flight of cranes by the Strymon, and turned\r\nthe shapes assumed by their flying squadron into forms expressive of\r\nthe various sounds of the human voice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: 'Ut aliquid studiose exquisitum dicere videamur.']\r\n\r\n'You were sent upon a stately embassy[521] by the Provincials of\r\nDalmatia to our grandfather; and there, not in commonplace words but\r\nwith a torrent of eloquence, you so set forth their needs and the\r\nmeasures which would be for the advantage of the public, that\r\nTheodoric, a man of cautious temperament, listened to your flow of\r\nwords without weariness, and all men desired still to listen, when you\r\nceased speaking.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: 'Juvat repetere pomposam legationem.']\r\n\r\n'[Since then] you have filled the office of Advocate in our Court. You\r\nmight have been a trier of causes (Cognitor): you have preferred to be\r\na pleader, though to all your advocacy you have brought so fair and\r\njudicial a mind that your eloquence and your zeal for your client have\r\nnever exceeded the bounds of truth.'\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING ATHALARIC TO AMBROSIUS.\r\n\r\n[Conferring on him the Quaestorship.]\r\n\r\n[This Ambrosius, son of Faustinus, is apparently the same to whom\r\nEnnodius addressed his 'Paraenesis Didascalica,' containing some\r\nimportant notices of Festus, Symmachus, Boethius, Cethegus, and their\r\ncontemporaries. (In Migne's 'Patrologia' lxiii. 250.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambrosius appointed Quaestor.]\r\n\r\n'A steady gradation of honours secures good servants for the State.\r\nYou have already served with credit the office of Count of the Private\r\nLargesses. And you have also filled satisfactorily the place of a high\r\nofficial who was dismissed in disgrace[522]. We now therefore promote\r\nyou to the office of Quaestor, and expect you to be the Pliny to the\r\nnew Trajan. Let your eloquent tongue adorn all that we have to say,\r\nand be fearless in suggesting to us all that is for the welfare of the\r\nState. A good Sovereign always allows his ministers to speak to him on\r\nbehalf of justice, while it is the sure mark of a tyrant to refuse to\r\nlisten to the voice of the ancient maxims of law. Remember that\r\ncelebrated saying of Trajan to an orator: \"Plead, if I am a good\r\nruler, for the Republic and me; if I am a bad one, for the Republic\r\nagainst me[523].\" But remember, that if we are thus severe upon\r\nourselves we are equally strict with regard to you, and expect you to\r\nfollow the example of your noble ancestors, and to abstain from\r\neverything like an infraction of the laws. We confer upon you the\r\ninsignia of the Quaestorship for this fifth Indiction' [Sept. 1,\r\n526--Sept. 1, 527].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: 'Gratiam quoque loci alterius invenisti. Dictationibus\r\nenim probaris adhibitus, cum sit offensionibus alter expulsus: et ita\r\nsuspensum honorem tuum sustinebat ingenium, ut Palatio non sineres\r\ndecesse Judicem, cujus ad tempus abrogatam cognovimus dignitatem.' I\r\ndo not think we can say from this what the office temporarily filled\r\nby Arator was.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: 'Sume dicationem, si bonus fuero, pro Republica et me:\r\nsi malus, pro Republica in me.']\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[On the elevation of Ambrosius to the Quaestorship].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'As a kind of door to our royal favour do we appoint Ambrosius to be\r\nour Quaestor. You know his merits of old: but, to speak only of recent\r\nmatters[524], we may remind you that when your hearts were wrung with\r\ngrief for the death of our glorious grandfather, it was by his mouth\r\nthat we assured you of our determination to continue to you the\r\nblessings of good government.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: 'Quando et moderna quae loquimur.' (Notice again\r\n_moderna_.)]\r\n\r\n'The presence of Ambrosius is full of dignity, and has a soothing\r\ninfluence which the words of his speech do but confirm[525]. It is\r\nunfortunate for an orator to have eloquence for his only gift, and to\r\nhave to obliterate by his oration the unfavourable effect produced on\r\nthe multitude by his appearance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: So the contemporary poet Maximian, speaking of his own\r\npast successes as an orator, and a good-looking one, says:\r\n\r\n    'Nec minor his aderat sublimis gratia formae\r\n      Quae vel si decent cetera, muta placet.'\r\n\r\n    Elegiae i. 17-18.]\r\n\r\n'We consider it not necessary to praise his eloquence. Of course a\r\nQuaestor is eloquent. While some have the government of a Province\r\ncommitted to them, others the care of the Treasury, he receives the\r\nensigns of his dignity in order that by him his Sovereign's fame may\r\nbe spread abroad through the whole world.'\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[On the election of Pope Felix III, 526.]\r\n\r\n[As this letter has an important bearing on the royal rights in\r\nconnection with Papal elections, it is translated in full.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Pope Felix III (or IV).]\r\n\r\n'We profess that we hear with great satisfaction that you have\r\nresponded to the judgment of our glorious lord and grandfather in your\r\nelection of a Bishop. It was right in sooth to obey the will of a good\r\nSovereign, who, handling the matter with wise deliberation, although\r\nit had reference to a form of faith alien from his own[526], thought\r\nfit to select such a Pontiff as could rightfully be displeasing to\r\nnone. You may thus recognise that his one chief desire was that\r\nReligion might flourish by good priests being supplied to all the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: 'Qui sapienti deliberatione pertractans quamvis in\r\naliena religione.']\r\n\r\n'You have received then a man both admirably endowed with Divine grace\r\nand approved by royal scrutiny. Let no one any longer be involved in\r\nthe old contention. There is no disgrace in being conquered when the\r\nKing's power has helped the winning side. That man makes him [the\r\nsuccessful candidate] his own, who manifests to him pure affection.\r\nFor what cause for regret can there be, when you find in this man,\r\nthose very qualities which you looked for in the other when you\r\nembraced his party?\r\n\r\n'These are family quarrels[527], a battle without cold steel, a\r\ncontest without hatred: by shouts, not wounds, a matter like this is\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: The words of Cassiodorus are, 'crinea sunt ista\r\ncertamina.' No one seems able to suggest a meaning for _crinea_. The\r\neditors propose to read _civica_, which however is very flat, and not\r\nexactly in Cassiodorus' manner. I suspect some recondite classical\r\nallusion, which has been missed by the transcribers, has led to the\r\ncorruption of the text.]\r\n\r\n'For even though the person who is desired be taken from you, yet\r\nnaught is lost by the faithful, since the longed-for priesthood is\r\npossessed by them. [They have a Pope, if not just the Pope whom they\r\nwished for.] Wherefore on the return of your Legate, the Illustrious\r\nPublianus, we have thought it right to send to your assembly these\r\nletters of salutation. For we taste one of our highest pleasures when\r\nwe exchange words with our nobles; and we doubt not that this is very\r\nsweet to you also, when you reflect that what you did by our\r\ngrandsire's order is personally agreeable to ourselves.'\r\n\r\n[For remarks on this important letter see Dahn's 'Könige der Germanen'\r\niii. 239. He makes it a simple appointment of the Pope by the bare\r\nwill of Theodoric, afterwards confirmed by Athalaric. To me it seems\r\nmore probable that there had been a contest, threatening the election\r\nof an antipope (as in 498 in the case of Symmachus and Laurentius),\r\nand that the matter had been, as on that occasion, referred to the\r\narbitration of Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING ATHALARIC TO OPILIO, COUNT OF THE SACRED LARGESSES (527).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opilio appointed Comes Sacrarum Largitionum.]\r\n\r\n'It is generally necessary to weigh carefully the merits of a new\r\naspirant to the honours of the Court (aulicas dignitates); but in your\r\ncase the merits of your family render this examination needless. Both\r\nyour father and brother held the same office[528] which we are now\r\nentrusting to you, and one may say that this dignity has taken up its\r\nabode in your house.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: 'Pater his fascibus praefuit sed et frater eadem\r\nresplenduit claritate.']\r\n\r\n'You learned the duties of a subordinate in the office under your\r\nbrother; and often did he, leaning upon you as on a staff, take a\r\nlittle needful repose, knowing that all things would be attended to by\r\nyou. The crowds of suppliants who resorted to him with their\r\ngrievances, shared the confidence which the people had in you, and saw\r\nthat you were already assuming the character of a good judge.\r\n\r\n'Most useful also were your services to the throne at the commencement\r\nof the new reign, when men's minds were in trouble as to what should\r\nhappen next. You bore the news of our accession to the Ligurians, and\r\nso strengthened them by your wise address that the error into which\r\nthey had been betrayed by the sun-setting was turned into joy at the\r\nrising of our empire[529].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: 'Nam cum ... auspicia nostra Liguribus felix portitor\r\nnuntiasti, et sapientiae tuae allocutione firmasti, in errorem _quem\r\nde occasu conceperant_, ortum nostri imperii in gaudia commutabant.'\r\nDoes this obscure passage indicate some revolutionary movements in\r\nLiguria after the death of Theodoric, perhaps fomented by the Frankish\r\nneighbours of Italy?]\r\n\r\n'We therefore confer upon you the dignity of Count of the Sacred\r\nLargesses from this sixth Indiction (Sept. 1, 527). Enjoy all the\r\nprivileges and emoluments which belonged to your predecessors. God\r\nforbid that those whose own actions are right should be shaken by any\r\nmachinations of calumny. There was a time when even Judges were\r\nharassed by informers (delatores); but that time is over. Lay aside\r\nthen all fear, you who have no errors to reproach yourself with, and\r\nfreely enjoy the advantages of your dignity. Imitate your brother:\r\neven though a little way behind him you will still be before most\r\nholders of the office. He was a man of the highest authority and of\r\nproved constancy, and the highest testimony to his merits was afforded\r\nby the fact that even under a successor who was hostile to him the\r\nwhole official staff of the palace was loud in his praises[530].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: 'Quando sub ingrato successore palatinum officium\r\npraeconia ejus tacere non potuit.']\r\n\r\n[This letter is of great importance, as containing indirectly the\r\nexpression of Cassiodorus' opinion on the trial of Boethius, and the\r\ntendency of that opinion seems to be against him and in favour of his\r\naccusers. Comparing this letter with v. 40, addressed to Cyprian,\r\nCornes Sacrarum Largitionum and _son of Opilio_, we may with something\r\nlike certainty construct this genealogical table:\r\n\r\n                  OPILIO,\r\n     C.S.L. (? son of the Consul of 453).\r\n    _________________|_________________\r\n    |                                 |\r\n CYPRIAN,                          OPILIO,\r\nC.S.L. 524.                      C.S.L. 527.\r\n\r\nNow Cyprian, whose ready wit and ingenious eloquence had rendered him\r\na favourite with Theodoric, is represented to us in the 'Philosophiae\r\nConsolatio' of Boethius (I. iv.) and in the 'Anonymus Valesii' (85) as\r\nthe informer by whom Albinus and Boethius were accused of high\r\ntreason. Opilio too (no doubt the same as the receiver of this letter)\r\nis described by Boethius (loc. cit.) as a man who on account of his\r\nnumberless frauds had been ordered by the King to go into banishment,\r\nhad taken refuge at the altar, and had been sternly bidden to leave\r\nRavenna before a given day, and then had purchased pardon by coming\r\nforward as a _delator_ against Boethius.\r\n\r\nAgainst all this passionate invective it is fair to set this\r\nremarkable letter of Cassiodorus, written it is true in the young\r\nKing's name and presenting the Court view of these transactions, but\r\nstill written after the death of Theodoric, and perhaps republished by\r\nCassiodorus in the 'Variarum' after the downfall of the Gothic\r\nMonarchy. In any case the allusions to _delatores_ in this letter,\r\nconsidering the history of Opilio and his brother, are extraordinary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\nThis letter, though it does not mention the name of Opilio, is\r\nevidently written on his promotion to the office of Comes Sacrarum\r\nLargitionum. It enumerates his good qualities, and declares that it is\r\nmarvellous and almost fortunate for Athalaric that so suitable a\r\ncandidate should not have been promoted in the reign of his\r\ngrandfather. The father of Opilio was a man of noble character and\r\nrobust body, who distinguished himself by his abstinence from the\r\nvices of the times and his preference for dignified repose in the\r\nstormy period of Odovacar[531].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: 'Adjectis saeculi vitiis, ditatus claris honoribus.'\r\nThe text is evidently corrupt. 'Abjectis' seems to be required; but\r\nsome MSS. instead of 'vitiis' read 'Odovacris.' In any case Odovacar's\r\ngovernment is evidently alluded to. Cf. the words used of the same man\r\nin the letter announcing the elevation of his other son, Cyprian (v.\r\n41): 'Nam pater huic, sicut meministis, Opilio fuit, vir quidem\r\n_abjectis temporibus_ ad excubias tamen Palatinas electus.']\r\n\r\n'He was reputed an excellent man in those times, when the Sovereign\r\nwas not a man of honour[532]. But why go back to his parentage, when\r\nhis brother has set so noble an example. The friendship, the rivalry\r\nin virtue of these two brothers, is worthy of the good old times. Both\r\nare true to their friends; both are devoid of avarice. Both have kept\r\ntheir loyalty to their King unspotted, and no marvel, since they have\r\nfirst shown themselves true to their friends and colleagues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: 'His temporibus habitus est eximius, cum princeps non\r\nesset erectus.']\r\n\r\n'Distinguished by these virtues, our candidate has been fittingly\r\nallied by marriage with the noble family of Basilius[533].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 533: This is probably the Basilius who was concerned in the\r\naccusation of Boethius (Phil. Cons. I. iv.); possibly the Consul of\r\n541, who fled to Constantinople when Totila took Rome in 546 (Procop.\r\nDe Bello Gotthico iii. 20, and Anastasius Lib. Pontif. apud Murator.\r\niii. 132); and perhaps the Basilius whom we find in trouble in\r\nVariarum iv. 22, 23: scarcely the Basilius of Variarum ii. 10, 11.]\r\n\r\n'He has managed his private affairs so as to avoid the two extremes of\r\nparsimony and extravagance. He has become popular with the Goths by\r\nhis manner of life, and with the Romans by his righteous\r\njudgments[534]; and has been over and over again chosen as a referee\r\n(Judex privatus), thus showing the high opinion in which his integrity\r\nis held.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 534: 'Gentiles victu (?), Romanos sibi judiciis obligabat.']\r\n\r\n'The Conscript Fathers are exhorted to endorse the favourable judgment\r\nof the King, by welcoming the new Count of Sacred Largesses into their\r\nbody.'\r\n\r\n[In view of these letters I do not understand what Gibbon means by\r\nsaying (cap. xxxix. _n._ 95), 'The characters of the two delators,\r\nBasilius ('Var.' ii. 10, 11; iv. 22) and Opilio (v. 41; viii. 16), are\r\nillustrated, not much to their honour, in the Epistles of\r\nCassiodorus.' This is quite true of Basilius, if the person alluded to\r\nin the references given by Gibbon be the same as the informer against\r\nBoethius, of which there may be a doubt; but Opilio is mentioned, as\r\nwe see, with the highest honour by Cassiodorus. So, too, is Decoratus,\r\nwhom in the same note Gibbon too hastily stigmatises as 'the worthless\r\ncolleague of Boethius.']\r\n\r\n\r\n18. KING ATHALARIC TO FELIX, QUAESTOR (527).\r\n\r\n[This cannot be the same as the Consul of 511, nor even his son; for\r\nthat Felix was of Gaulish extraction, and came from beyond the Alps.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotion of Felix to the Quaestorship.]\r\n\r\n'It is desirable that those who are appointed as Judges should know\r\nsomething of law, and most unfitting that he whom so many officials\r\n(_milites_) obey should be seen to be dependent for his law on some\r\none of his subordinates.\r\n\r\n'You long ago, when engaged in civil causes as an Advocate, were\r\nmarked out by your Sovereign's eye[535]. He noted your eloquence, your\r\nfidelity, your youthful beauty, and your maturity of mind. No client\r\ncould ask for more devotion than you showed in his cause; no Judge\r\nfound in you anything to blame.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: 'Dudum te forensibus negociis insudantem, _oculus\r\nimperialis_ aspexit'--an expression which goes very near to styling\r\nTheodoric Imperator.]\r\n\r\n'Receive then now the dignity of Quaestor for this sixth Indiction\r\n(Sept. 1, 527), and judge in the Courts where hitherto you have\r\npleaded.\r\n\r\n'You are called Felix; act so as always to merit that name; for it is\r\nabsurd to have a name which denotes one thing and to display the\r\nopposite in one's character. We think we have now said enough for a\r\nman of your good conscience. Many admonitions seem to imply a doubt of\r\nthe character of him who receives them.' [A maxim often forgotten by\r\nCassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[On the promotion of Felix.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'As the sky with stars, or the meadow with flowers, so do we wish the\r\nSenate to be resplendent with the men of eminence whom we introduce\r\ninto it. It is itself a seminary of Senators; but our favour and the\r\ndignities of our Court also rear them.\r\n\r\n'The Quaestorship is the true mother of the senatorial dignity, since\r\nwho can be fitter to take his seat in the Curia than he who has shared\r\nthe counsels of his Sovereign?\r\n\r\n'You know the eloquence of our candidate [Felix], his early triumphs,\r\nhis modesty, his fidelity. To leave such a man unpromoted were a\r\npublic loss; and he will always love the laws by the practice of which\r\nhe has risen to eminence.\r\n\r\n'Nor is he the first of his race to earn rhetorical distinction. His\r\nfather shone so brilliantly in the Forum of Milan, that he bloomed\r\nforth with undying fruits from the soil of Cicero[536]. He stood\r\nagainst Magnus Olybrius, he was found equal in fluency to\r\nEugenius[537] and many others whom Rome knew as foremost in their\r\nart. If the transmission of material wealth by long descent makes men\r\nnoble, how much more should the inheritance of the treasures of the\r\nintellect give nobility.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: 'Pater ita in Mediolanensi foro resplenduit, ut aeterno\r\nfructu e Tulliano cespite pullularet.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: 'Is palmarum Eugenetis linguae ubertate suffecit.'\r\nPossibly this is the Magister Officiorum of Var. i. 12, and the person\r\nto whom is addressed a letter of Ennodius (iv. 26). The form\r\nEugenetis, instead of Eugenii, belongs to the debased Latinity of the\r\nage.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. KING ATHALARIC TO ALBIENUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND PRAEFECTUS\r\nPRAETORIO[538] (527).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 538: In Nivellius' edition the title of this office is given\r\nas _Praepositus_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albienus made Praetorian Praefect.]\r\n\r\n'Your predecessor has been the model of a bad governor.

He was\r\nrapacious: be you moderate. Soothe and relieve the harassed people\r\nentrusted to your charge. Receive for this sixth Indiction [Sept. 1,\r\n527-528] the fasces of the Praefecture, and let the office of\r\nPraetorian Praefect return to its ancient fame, an object of praise to\r\nthe whole world[539]. This office dates from Joseph, and rightly is he\r\nwho holds it called by our laws Father of the Provinces, Father of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 539: 'Redeat ad nomen antiquum Praefectura illa Praetorii,\r\ntoto orbe laudabilis.' Is it possible that there had been some attempt\r\nto change the _title_ of the Praefect, which accounts for the\r\n_Praepositus_ which in some MSS. we find in the heading of this\r\nletter?]\r\n\r\n'See that you avoid all unjust exactions. We cannot bear that our\r\nTreasury should be filled by unrighteous means.\r\n\r\n'Your descent from a father who has held the same high office, and\r\nyour intimate knowledge of the _Dicta prudentum_, warrant us in\r\nbelieving that you will make a good judge.'\r\n\r\n[I have not been able to find any hint of the name of the Praefectus\r\nPraetorio for 526-527, so bitterly condemned in this letter. As he may\r\nhave held office for some years, his misgovernment may have been\r\nconnected with the death of Boethius (524). Can we connect him with\r\nthe Trigguilla 'Regiae Praepositus Domus' whose injustice is denounced\r\nby Boethius ('Phil. Cons.' i. 4)?]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. KING ATHALARIC TO CYPRIAN, PATRICIAN.\r\n\r\n22. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cyprian's elevation to the Patriciate.]\r\n\r\nIn these two letters the high character and distinguished services of\r\nCyprian are commemorated. 'Under Theodoric he distinguished himself\r\nboth in war and peace. At the time of the war of Sirmium he was\r\nconspicuous both in his resistance to the fiery onslaught of the\r\nBulgarians and in his active pursuit of them when their ranks were\r\nbroken[540]. He then filled, with great credit to himself, the office\r\nof Referendarius[541]. Great was the responsibility of exercising\r\npeaceful as well as warlike offices under such a master as Theodoric.\r\nIn fact the training for one was helpful for the other, since it\r\nrequired a soldier's courage and promptness to be always ready with a\r\ntruthful and accurate reply to that keen, firm-minded ruler of\r\nmen[542].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 540: 'Vidit te adhuc gentilis' (still under the dominion of\r\nthe Gepidae) 'Danubius bellatorem: non te terruit Bulgarorum globus,\r\nqui etiam nostris erat praesumptione certaminis obstaturus. Peculiare\r\ntibi fuit et renitentes Barbaros aggredi, et conversos terrore\r\nsectari. Sic victoriam Gothorum non tam numero quam labore juvisti.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: For a description of his services in this function, see\r\nVar. v. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 542: This is evidently the meaning; but something seems to\r\nhave dropped out of the text.]\r\n\r\n'Thence he was promoted to the dignity of Count of the Sacred\r\nLargesses, a post well suited to his pure, self-restrained\r\ncharacter[543]. He is now growing old in body, but ever young in fame,\r\nand the King heartily wishes him increase of years to enjoy his\r\nrenown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 543: 'Hoc est laborum tuorum aptissimum munus: quam sic\r\ncastâ sic moderatâ mente peregisti ut majora tibi deberi faceres,\r\nquamvis eam in magna praemia suscepisses.']\r\n\r\n'Rightly, too, is there now conferred upon him the dignity of\r\n_Patricius_, since he is the father of such noble sons, men whose\r\nchildhood was passed in the palace under the very eye of Theodoric\r\n(thus like young eagles already learning to gaze upon the sun), and\r\nwho now cultivate the friendship of the Goths, learn from them all\r\nmartial exercises, speak their language, and thus give evident tokens\r\nof their future fidelity to the Gothic nation[544].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 544: 'Relucent etiam gratia gentili, nec cessant armorum\r\nimbui fortibus institutis. _Pueri stirpis Romanae nostra linguâ\r\nloquuntur; eximie indicantes exhibere se nobis futuram fidem, quorum\r\njam videntur affectasse sermonem.... Variis linguis loquuntur\r\negregie_, maturis viris communione miscentur.']\r\n\r\n'The Senate is therefore exhorted to welcome its thus promoted\r\ncolleague, who at each accession of rank has shown himself yet\r\nworthier of his high place, and whom grandfather and grandson have\r\nboth delighted to honour. Thus will it renew the glories of the Decii\r\nand the Corvini, who were its sons in the days of old.'\r\n\r\n[The subject of these letters is indisputably the same Cyprian whom\r\nthe 'Anonymus Valesii' speaks of as suborning false witnesses against\r\nAlbinus and Boethius, and of whom the latter says ('Phil. Cons.' i.\r\n4): 'Ne Albinum, Consularem virum praejudicatae accusationis poena\r\ncorriperet, odiis me Cypriani delatoris opposui.' Compare the remarks\r\nmade on Letters 16 and 17; and remember that this letter was composed\r\nthree years after the death of Boethius, when Theodoric also was dead,\r\nand his daughter was only too willing to retrace his steps, in all\r\nthat concerned the severities of the latter years of his reign. For\r\nthe pedigree of Cyprian see p. 363.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. KING ATHALARIC TO BERGANTINUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND COMES PATRIMONII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gifts to Theodahad.]\r\n\r\n'Kings should always be generous, but especially to those of their own\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n'Therefore we desire your Greatness to transfer the farms herein\r\ndescribed, to the exalted and most honourable Theodahad, weighing out\r\nto him so many solidi, out of that which was formerly the patrimony of\r\nhis magnificent Mother; and we guarantee to him the absolute ownership\r\nof such farms, free from any claims to the inheritance on our\r\npart[545].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 545: 'Atque ideo illustrem magnitudinem tuam praecelso atque\r\namplissimo viro Theodahado massas subter annexas, tot solidos\r\npensitantes, ex patrimonio quondam magnificae foeminae matris ipsius,\r\npraecipimus reformari, ejus feliciter dominio plenissime vendicandas,\r\ncujus successionis integrum jus in ea qua praecipimus parte largimur.'\r\nAccording to Dahn (Könige der Germanen iv. 60-61), these lands had\r\nbeen given in her lifetime by Theodahad's mother to the King, and are\r\nnow begged for by Theodahad. But why 'tot solidos pensitantes?' Why\r\nshould Theodahad receive both land and money? There seems no authority\r\nfor translating 'pensitantes' receiving. Probably the solidi thus paid\r\nto him are mesne rents received by the King and accounted for to\r\nTheodahad. On the whole affair cf. Procopius, De Bello Gotthico i. 4.]\r\n\r\n'We trust to his sincerity and good faith, that in the future he will\r\ndeserve the remainder of the above-mentioned patrimony, with the\r\naddition of the whole quantity[546].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 546: 'De cujus fide ac synceritate praesumimus, ut sequenti\r\ntempore reliqua supra memorati patrimonii cum omni adjecta quantitate\r\nmereatur.' This sentence is to me quite unintelligible.]\r\n\r\n'What can we deny to such a man, whose obedience might claim a higher\r\nreward even were he not our cousin--a man who is not puffed up by any\r\npride of his noble birth, humble in his modesty, always uniform in his\r\nprudence? Therefore instruct the Cartarii of your office to make over\r\nthe aforesaid farms to his Actores without delay[547].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 547: Cf. the formalities connected with Odovacar's deed of\r\ngift to Pierius (Marini, Pap. Diplom. 82, 83), quoted in Italy and her\r\nInvaders iii. 165.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KING ATHALARIC TO THE CLERGY OF THE ROMAN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ecclesiastical immunities.]\r\n\r\n'For the gift of kingly power we owe an infinite debt to God, whose\r\nministers ye are.\r\n\r\n'Ye state in your tearful memorial to us that it has been an ordinance\r\nof long custom that anyone who has a suit of any kind against a\r\nservant of the sacrosanct Roman Church should first address himself to\r\nthe chief Priest of that City, lest haply your clergy, being profaned\r\nby the litigation of the Forum, should be occupied in secular rather\r\nthan religious matters. And you add that one of your Deacons has, to\r\nthe disgrace of religion, been so sharply handled by legal process\r\nthat the Sajo[548] has dared actually to take him into his own\r\ncustody.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 548: In the text, 'Sajus.']\r\n\r\n'This dishonour to the Ministers of holy things is highly displeasing\r\nto our inborn reverence, yet we are glad that it gives us the\r\nopportunity of paying part of our debt to Heaven.\r\n\r\n'Therefore, considering the honour of the Apostolic See, and wishing\r\nto meet the desires of the petitioners, we by the authority of this\r\nletter decree in regular course[549]:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: 'Praesenti auctoritate moderato ordine definimus.' Dahn\r\ninterprets 'moderato ordine,' 'not so absolutely as the Roman clergy\r\ndesires.' Is not this to attribute rather too much force to the\r\nconventional language of Cassiodorus?]\r\n\r\n'That if anyone shall think he has a good cause for going to law with\r\na person belonging to the Roman clergy, he shall first present himself\r\nfor hearing at the judgment-seat of the most blessed Pope, in order\r\nthat the latter may either decide between the two in his own holy\r\nmanner, or may delegate the cause to a Jurisconsult to be ended by\r\nhim. And if, perchance, which it is impiety to believe, the\r\nreasonable desire of the petitioner shall have been evaded, then may\r\nhe come to the secular courts with his grievance, when he can prove\r\nthat his petitions have been spurned by the Bishop of the aforesaid\r\nSee[550].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: 'Definimus, ut si quispiam ad Romanum Clerum aliquem\r\npertinentem, in quâlibet causâ probabili crediderit actione pulsandum,\r\nad beatissimi Papae judicium prius conveniat audiendus. Ut aut ipse\r\ninter utrosque more suae sanctitatis agnoscat, aut causam deleget\r\naequitatis studio terminandam: et si forte, quod credi nefas est,\r\ncompetens desiderium fuerit petitoris elusum, tuno ad saecularia fora\r\njurgaturus occurrat, quando suas petitiones probaverit a supradictae\r\nsedis praesule fuisse contemptas.']\r\n\r\n'Should any litigant be so dishonest and so irreverent, both towards\r\nthe Holy See and our authority, as to disregard this order [and\r\nproceed first in our tribunals against one of the Roman clergy], he\r\nshall forfeit 10 lbs. of gold [£400], to be exacted by the officers of\r\nthe Count of Sacred Largesses and distributed by the Pope to the poor;\r\nand he shall lose his suit in addition, notwithstanding any decree\r\nwhich he may have gained in the secular court.\r\n\r\n'Meanwhile do you, whom our judgments thus venerate, live according to\r\nthe ordinances of the Church. It is a great wickedness in you to admit\r\nsuch crimes as do not become the conversation even of secular men.\r\nYour profession is the heavenly life. Do not condescend to the\r\ngrovelling wishes and vulgar errors of ordinary mortals. Let the men\r\nof this world be coerced by human laws; do you obey the precepts of\r\nrighteousness.'\r\n\r\n[See Dahn, 'Könige der Germanen' iii. 191-2, Sartorius 145, and\r\nBauer's 'History of the Popes' ii. 323-4, for remarks on this\r\nimportant _privilegium_.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that it relates to civil, not criminal procedure, and that\r\nit does leave a right of final appeal from the Papal Courts to the\r\ndissatisfied secular litigant. At the same time, that such an appeal\r\nwould be prosecuted with immense difficulty is clear even from the\r\nwords of the decree. The appellant will have to satisfy the King's\r\nJudges of a thing which it is almost impiety to believe, that the\r\noccupant of the Roman See has spurned his petitions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. KING ATHALARIC TO JOANNES, VIR SPECTABILIS, REFERENDARIUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confirmation of Tulum's gift of property in the\r\nLucullanum.]\r\n\r\n'It is a very fitting thing to confirm the generosity of others\r\ntowards persons who might well have received gifts from oneself. We\r\ntherefore declare that in your case the gift is another's but the will\r\nto give is our own, and the King has only been anticipated by the\r\nrapid bounty of the subject[551].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: 'Profitemur itaque alterius quidem donum, sed nostrum\r\nesse judicium, et modernam principis mentem praevenisse tantum\r\nvelocissimam largitatem.' Observe again the use of Cassiodorus'\r\nfavourite word _modernam_.]\r\n\r\n'Everyone knows that our grandfather wished to give you the house of\r\nAgnellus in the Castrum Lucullanum, but could not do so having already\r\ngiven it to the Patrician Tulum[552]. Tulum, however, with his usual\r\ngenerosity, seconding the wishes of his master, formally conveyed the\r\nproperty to you; and that conveyance we now confirm, guaranteeing the\r\nquiet possession of it to you and your heirs for all time to come. If\r\nany doubt exist as to your title, by any mischance, or by reason of\r\nany enquiry, such doubt is exploded by the authority of this letter of\r\nours[553].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 552: Tholuit, or Tholum, in some MSS., but no doubt the same\r\nas the Tulum of Letters 9 and 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: 'Ubi et si quid esset quolibet casu, qualibet\r\ninquisitione fortassis ambiguum, hujus auctoritatis nostrae judicio\r\nconstat explosum.']\r\n\r\n'And should any envious person, in contempt of our royal will, dare to\r\nraise any question in this matter hereafter, either on behalf of the\r\nFiscus or of any private individual, we declare that he shall pay to\r\nyou, or to the person to whom you may have assigned the said house,\r\n100 lbs. of gold (£4,000) by way of penalty.'\r\n\r\n[Why should there be the necessity of this royal confirmation of a\r\ntransaction between two private individuals, Tulum and Joannes, and\r\nthis tremendous penalty on all future impugners of it?\r\n\r\nEvidently because the property had been impressed with the character\r\nof State domain, and it was doubtful how far Tulum's alienation of it\r\nmight stand good against the claims of future Sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThis becomes quite clear when we reflect what is the property to which\r\nthis letter refers. It is either the whole or a part of the\r\nLucullanum, to which the deposed Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was\r\nbanished in 476. On his death, as we may conjecture, this property,\r\none of the most delightful places of residence in Italy, has been\r\ngiven by Theodoric to Tulum, perhaps just after he had distinguished\r\nhimself in the Gaulish campaign of 508. For some reason or other,\r\nTulum has alienated it (ostensibly, given it) to the Reporter Joannes,\r\nno doubt a Roman, who is apparently nervous lest his title to it\r\nshould hereafter be impugned on the ground that the palace of the last\r\nRoman Emperor was national property. Hence this letter. There is some\r\ndifficulty and variation between the MSS. in the words describing the\r\nproperty: 'Saepe dicta domus paternae recordationis Agnelli, in\r\nLucullano castro posita.' For _paternae_, Migne's editor reads\r\n_patriciae_. The forthcoming critical edition of the 'Variae' will\r\nshow whether there is any support in the MSS. for a conjecture which I\r\ncannot help entertaining that _Agnelli_ is an error for _Augustuli_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26. KING ATHALARIC TO ALL THE INHABITANTS OF REATE AND NURSIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gothic settlers in the Sabine territory exhorted to\r\nobedience to their Prior, Quidila.]\r\n\r\n'Our glorious grandfather had arranged that, in accordance with your\r\ndesire, Quidila, son of Sibia, should be your Captain (Prior). We\r\nconfirm this appointment, and desire you to obey him in all things.\r\nYou are so far moulded by the character of our grandfather that you\r\nwillingly obey both the laws and the Judges. Our enemies are best\r\nvanquished, and the favour both of Heaven and of other nations is best\r\nconciliated for us, by our obeying the principles of justice. If\r\nanyone is in need of anything, let him seek to obtain it from the\r\ngenerosity of his Sovereign rather than by the strength of his own\r\nright hand, since it is for your advantage that the Romans be at\r\npeace, who, in filling our Treasury, at the same time multiply your\r\ndonatives.'\r\n\r\n[This letter is evidently addressed to Goths, and Quidila the _Prior_,\r\nwho is set over them, is also a Goth. We can only conjecture what the\r\noffice of Prior was: probably to some extent it involved civil as well\r\nas military authority. The conjecture of Dahn ('Könige der Germanen'\r\niv. 173) that it corresponds to the Gothic _Hundafath_ (Centenarius),\r\nseems to me extremely probable. The title of the letter is curious. It\r\nis addressed 'Universis Reatinis et Nursinis.' Are we then to suppose\r\nthat strong military colonies of Goths had been settled in these\r\nplaces, the Roman inhabitants having been extruded? The fact that St.\r\nBenedict was born in Nursia, some fifty-seven years before the writing\r\nof this letter, gives an additional interest to this question.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. KING ATHALARIC TO DUMERIT THE SAJO, AND TO FLORENTINUS, A ZEALOUS\r\nOFFICER OF THE COURT[554].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 554: 'Florentino viro devoto Comitiaco.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robbery in the district of Faenza to be suppressed.]\r\n\r\n'Justice must be shown upon the wicked. Different diseases require\r\ndifferent remedies.\r\n\r\n'Let your Devotion speed instantly through the territory of Faventia,\r\nand if you find any persons, either Goths or Romans, concerned in the\r\nplunder of the possessors, punish them severely. How much better it\r\nwould be for those misguided persons to live according to our will,\r\nand earn the reward of pleasing us.' [The last sentence is obscure,\r\nand perhaps the text is corrupt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. KING ATHALARIC TO CUNIGAST, VIR ILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[No doubt the same as the Conigast attacked by Boethius in the\r\n'Philosophiae Consolatio' i. 4[555].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 555: 'Quoticus ego Conigastum in inbecillis cujusque\r\nfortunas impetum facientem obvius excepi!']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Possessores (or Coloni?) forced to become slaves.]\r\n\r\n'Our Serenity has been moved by the grievous petition of Constantius\r\nand Venerius, who complain that Tanca [probably a Goth] has wrested\r\nfrom them the farm which is called Fabricula, which belonged to them\r\nin their own right, together with the stock upon it[556], and has\r\ncompelled them, in order to prevent similar forcible demands upon\r\ntheir property in future, to allow the worst lot of all--the condition\r\nof slavery--to be imposed upon them, who are really free[557].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 556: 'Cum suo peculio.' If they were not slaves they could\r\nnot have _peculium_ in the technical sense. I therefore understand\r\n'peculio' to be simply equivalent to _cattle_, a sense which is\r\nconfirmed by 'Calabri peculiosi' in Letter 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 557: 'Adjicientes ne rerum suarum repetitionibus imminerent\r\n[? imminuerent] liberis sibi conditionem ultimae servitutis imponi.'\r\nCf. Salvian, De Gubernatione Dei v. 8, 9, for a description of similar\r\noccurrences in Gaul.]\r\n\r\n'Let your Greatness therefore summon Tanca to your judgment-seat, and,\r\nafter hearing all parties, pronounce a just judgment and one accordant\r\nto your character. For though it is a serious matter to oust a lord\r\nfrom his right, it is contrary to the feelings of our age to press\r\ndown free necks under the yoke of slavery.\r\n\r\n'Let Tanca therefore either establish his right to the slaves and\r\ntheir property, or, if they are proved free, let him give them up,\r\nwhole and unharmed: in which case we will inflict upon him no further\r\npenalty.'\r\n\r\n\r\n29. KING ATHALARIC TO THE DIGNIFIED CULTIVATORS[558] AND CURIALS OF\r\nTHE CITY OF PARMA.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 558: 'Honoratis Possessoribus.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sanitary measures needed in Parma.]\r\n\r\n'You ought willingly to co-operate in that which is being done for the\r\nadvantage of your town. When it was suffering from a long drought, our\r\ngrandfather, with God's help, watered it with the life-giving wave.\r\nCleanse out then the mouths of your sewers, lest otherwise, being\r\nchecked in its flow by the accumulated filth, it should surge back\r\ninto your houses, and bring into them the pollution which it was meant\r\nto wash away.\r\n\r\n'The Spectabilis Genesius is appointed to superintend this work, and\r\nto quicken your zeal regarding it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n30. KING ATHALARIC TO GENESIUS, VIR SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Relating to the same subject as the preceding.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'Through love of your city our grandfather, with royal generosity,\r\nconstructed an aqueduct of the ancient type[559] for you. But it is of\r\nno use to provide a good water-supply unless your sewers are in good\r\norder. Therefore let your Sublimity set the citizens of Parma\r\ndiligently to work at this business, that all ancient channels,\r\nwhether underground or those which run by the sides of the streets, be\r\ndiligently repaired[560], in order that when the longed-for stream\r\nflows into your town it be not hindered by any obstacle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 559: 'Antiqui operis formam.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 560: 'Quatenus antiquos cuniculos, sive subterraneos, sive\r\nqui junguntur marginibus platearum diligenter emendent.']\r\n\r\n'How fair is water in a running stream, but how ugly in puddles and\r\nswamps; it is good then neither for man nor beast. Without water city\r\nand country alike languish; and rightly did the ancients punish one\r\nwho was unfit for human society by forbidding all men to give him\r\nwater. Therefore you ought all heartily to combine for this most\r\nuseful work, since the man who is not touched by the comeliness of his\r\ncity has not yet the mind of a citizen.'\r\n\r\n\r\n31. KING ATHALARIC TO SEVERUS, VIR SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Is Severus _Vicarius Urbis_? His title Spectabilis seems to require\r\nsome such rank as this, otherwise he seems more like a _Corrector_\r\n(Clarissimus) _Bruttiorum et Lucaniae_. Perhaps already the strict\r\ngradation established by Diocletian and Constantine was somewhat\r\nbroken down, and governors received higher titles than strictly\r\nbelonged to them.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissuasions from a country life, and praises of\r\nCassiodorus' native land of Bruttii.]\r\n\r\n'Since you, when on the staff of the Praefect, have learned the\r\nprinciples of statesmanship, we are sure that you will agree with us\r\nthat cities are the chief ornament of human society. Let the wild\r\nbeasts live in fields and woods: men ought to draw together into\r\ncities. Even among birds we see that those of gentle disposition--like\r\nthrushes, storks, and doves--love to flock together, while the greedy\r\nhawk, intent on its bloody pastime, seeks solitude.\r\n\r\n'Now we say that the man who shuns human society becomes at once an\r\nobject of suspicion. Let therefore the Possessores and Curiales of\r\nBruttii return to their cities. The Coloni may cultivate the\r\nsoil--that is what their name denotes[561]; but the men whom we\r\ndecorate with civic honours ought to live in cities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: 'Coloni sunt qui agros jugiter colunt.']\r\n\r\n'In truth it is a lovely land. Ceres and Pallas have crowned it with\r\ntheir respective gifts (corn and oil); the plains are green with\r\npastures, the slopes are purple with vineyards. Above all is it rich\r\nin its vast herds of horses[562], and no wonder, since the dense shade\r\nof its forests protects them from the bites of flies, and provides\r\nthem with ever verdant pasture even in the height of summer. Cool\r\nwaters flow from its lofty heights; fair harbours on both its shores\r\nwoo the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 562: Cf. what is said (i. 4) as to the large present of\r\nhorses made by the father of Cassiodorus to Theodoric for the use of\r\nthe Gothic army.]\r\n\r\n'There the countryman enjoys the good food of the citizen, the poor\r\nman the abundance of the wealthy[563]. If such then be the charms even\r\nof the country in your Province, why should you shirk living in its\r\ncities[564]?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 563: 'Vivunt illic rustici epulis urbanorum, mediocres autem\r\nabundantia praepotentium.' 'Mediocres' and 'tenues' are technical\r\nwords with Cassiodorus for the poor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 564: Cassiodorus must have felt the weakness of his logic\r\nhere. He patriotically praises the rural beauty of Bruttii, yet the\r\nconclusion which by main force he arrives at is, 'Leave the country\r\nand live in towns.']\r\n\r\n'Why should so many men refined by literature skulk in obscurity? The\r\nboy goes to a good school, becomes imbued with the love of letters,\r\nand then, when he is come to man's estate and should be seeking the\r\nForum in order to display his talents, he suddenly changes into a\r\nboor, unlearns all that he has learned, and in his love for the fields\r\nforgets what is due to a reasonable love for himself. And yet even\r\nbirds love human fellowship, and the nightingale boldly rears her\r\nbrood close to the haunts of men.\r\n\r\n'Let the cities then return to their old splendour; let none prefer\r\nthe charms of the country to the walls reared by the men of old. Why\r\nshould not everyone be attracted by the concourse of noble persons, by\r\nthe pleasures of converse with his equals? To stroll through the\r\nForum, to look in at some skilful craftsman at his work, to push one's\r\nown cause through the law courts, then between whiles to play with the\r\ncounters of Palamedes (draughts), to go to the baths with one's\r\nacquaintances, to indulge in the friendly emulation of the\r\nbanquet--these are the proper employments of a Roman noble; yet not\r\none of them is tasted by the man who chooses to live always in the\r\ncountry with his farm-servants[565].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 565: 'Cui enim minus grata nobilium videatur occursio. Cui\r\nnon affectuosum sit cum paribus miscere sermonem, forum petere,\r\nhonestas artes invisere, causas proprias legibus expedire, interdum\r\nPalamediacis calculis occupari, ad balneas ire cum sociis, prandia\r\nmutuis apparatibus exhibere? Caret profecto omnibus his, qui vitam\r\nsuam vult semper habere cum famulis.']\r\n\r\n'We order therefore that all Possessores and Curiales shall, according\r\nto their relative means, find bail and give bonds, promising that they\r\nwill for the larger part of the year reside in some city, such as they\r\nmay choose[566]. And thus, while not wholly debarred from the\r\npleasures of the country, they will furnish to the cities their proper\r\nadornment of citizens.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: 'Datis fidejussoribus jam Possessores quam Curiales,\r\nsub aestimatione virium, poenâ interpositâ, promittant anni parte\r\nmajore se in civitatibus manere, quas habitare delegerint.']\r\n\r\n\r\n32. KING ATHALARIC TO SEVERUS, VIR SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fountain of Arethusa.]\r\n\r\n'Nimfadius (Vir Sublimis) was journeying to the King's Comitatus on\r\nsome affair of his own, when, wearied with his journey, he lay down to\r\nrest, and let his beasts of burden graze round the fountain of\r\nArethusa.\r\n\r\n'This fountain, situated in the territory of Squillace[567], at the\r\nfoot of the hills and above the sand of the sea, makes a green and\r\npleasant place all round it, fringed with rustling reeds as with a\r\ncrown. It has certain marvellous properties: for let a man go to it in\r\nsilence and he sees it calmly flowing, more like a pond than a\r\nfountain. But let him cough or speak with a loud voice, and it becomes\r\nviolently agitated, heaving to and fro like a pot boiling. Strange\r\npower this of a fountain to answer a man. I have read that some\r\nfountains can change the colours of the animals that drink at them;\r\nthat others can turn wood dropped into them to stone. The human reason\r\nis altogether unable to understand such things as these.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 567: 'In Scyllatino territoris.' Transcribers, thinking of\r\nthe Arethusa at Syracuse, have tried to alter this into _Siciliano_;\r\nbut there can be little doubt that the above reading is right. As to\r\nthe situation of the Fountain of Arethusa, see Introduction, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n'But let us return to the complaint of our suppliant. Nimfadius\r\nasserts that, while he was resting, the country people artfully drove\r\noff his beasts of burden.\r\n\r\n'This kind of crime brings our times into disgrace, and turns the\r\ncharm of that quiet resting-place into disgust. Diligently enquire\r\ninto it, for the credit of our Comitatus is involved in our subjects\r\nbeing able to journey to it in safety. At first, no doubt, the\r\noffenders will lie close, and seem as silent as the unmoved Arethusa.\r\nBut begin your investigations, and they will soon break forth, like\r\nthat fountain, with angry exclamations, in the midst of which you will\r\ndiscover the truth. Punish the offenders severely; for we should\r\nregret that owing to the excesses of robbers that wonderful and\r\njoy-bringing fountain should be deserted.'\r\n\r\n\r\n33. KING ATHALARIC TO SEVERUS, VIR SPECTABILIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Feast of St. Cyprian.]\r\n\r\n'We hear that the rustics are indulging in disorderly practices, and\r\nrobbing the market-people who come from all quarters to the chief fair\r\nof Lucania on the day of St. Cyprian. This must by all means be\r\nsuppressed, and your Respectability should quietly collect a\r\nsufficient number of the owners and tenants of the adjoining\r\nfarms[568] to overpower these freebooters and bring them to justice.\r\nAny rustic or other person found guilty of disturbing the fair should\r\nbe at once punished with the stick[569], and then exhibited with some\r\nmark of infamy upon him[570].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: 'Spectabilitas vestra praedicto tempore, unâ cum\r\nPossessoribus atque Conductoribus diversarum massarum ad quietem\r\nconvenientium ... reos inveniat,' &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: 'Inter ipsa initia comprehensus fustuariae subdatur\r\nultioni.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: 'Pompatus mala nota.']\r\n\r\n'This fair, which according to the old superstition was named\r\nLeucothea [after the nymph], from the extreme purity of the fountain\r\nat which it is held, is the greatest fair in all the surrounding\r\ncountry. Everything that industrious Campania, or opulent Bruttii, or\r\ncattle-breeding Calabria[571], or strong Apulia produces, is there to\r\nbe found exposed for sale, on such reasonable terms that no buyer goes\r\naway dissatisfied. It is a charming sight to see the broad plains\r\nfilled with suddenly-reared houses formed of leafy branches\r\nintertwined: all the beauty of the most leisurely-built city, and yet\r\nnot a wall to be seen. There stand ready boys and girls, with the\r\nattractions which belong to their respective sexes and ages, whom not\r\ncaptivity but freedom sets a price upon. These are with good reason\r\nsold by their parents, since they themselves gain by their very\r\nservitude. For one cannot doubt that they are benefited even as slaves\r\n[or servants?], by being transferred from the toil of the fields to\r\nthe service of cities[572].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: 'Calabri peculiosi.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: 'Praesto sunt pueri ac puellae, diverso sexu atque\r\naetate conspicuo, quos non facit captivitas esse sub pretio sed\r\nlibertas: hos merito parentes vendunt, quoniam de ipsa famulatione\r\nproficiunt. Dubium quippe non est servos posse meliorari qui de labore\r\nagrorum ad urbana servitia transferuntur.' With almost any writer but\r\nCassiodorus this would prove that in the Sixth Century free Italians\r\nwere selling their children into actual slavery. But I doubt whether\r\nhe really means more than that the children of the country people were\r\nfor hire as domestic servants in the cities. If so, the scene is not\r\nunlike our own 'statute fairs' or 'hirings' in the north of England.\r\nIt appears from § 94 of the Edictum Theodorici that parents could sell\r\ntheir children, but that the latter did not lose their _status\r\ningenuus_. Must they then claim it on coming of age? 'Parentes qui\r\ncogente necessitate filios suos alimentorum gratia vendiderint\r\ningenuitati eorum non praejudicant. _Homo enim liber pretio nullo\r\naestimatur._' Cf. also § 95: 'Operas enim tantum parentes filiorum\r\nquos in potestate habuerint, locare possunt.']\r\n\r\n'What can I say of the bright and many-coloured garments? what of the\r\nsleek and well-fed cattle offered at such a price as to tempt any\r\npurchaser?\r\n\r\n'The place itself is situated in a wide and pleasant plain, a suburb\r\nof the ancient city of Cosilinum, and has received the name of\r\nMarcilianum from the founder of these sacred springs[573].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: Marcilianum is now Sala, in the valley of the Calore\r\n(Tanager). Padula is thought by some to mark the site of Cosilinum.\r\nThe Island of Leucosia, now Licosa, a few miles from Paestum,\r\nevidently does not represent the Leucothea of this letter.]\r\n\r\n'And this is in truth a marvellous fountain, full and fresh, and of\r\nsuch transparent clearness that when you look through it you think you\r\nare looking through air alone. Choice fishes swim about in the pool,\r\nperfectly tame, because if anyone presumes to capture them he soon\r\nfeels the Divine vengeance. On the morning which precedes the holy\r\nnight [of St. Cyprian], as soon as the Priest begins to utter the\r\nbaptismal prayer, the water begins to rise above its accustomed\r\nheight. Generally it covers but five steps of the well, but the brute\r\nelement, as if preparing itself for miracles, begins to swell, and at\r\nlast covers two steps more, never reached at any other time of the\r\nyear. Truly a stupendous miracle, that streams of water should thus\r\nstand still or increase at the sound of the human voice, as if the\r\nfountain itself desired to listen to the sermon.\r\n\r\n'Thus hath Lucania a river Jordan of her own. Wherefore, both for\r\nreligion's sake and for the profit of the people, it behoves that good\r\norder should be kept among the frequenters of the fair, since in the\r\njudgment of all, that man must be deemed a villain who would sully the\r\njoys of such happy days.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING TWENTY-FIVE LETTERS, ALL WRITTEN IN THE NAME OF ATHALARIC\r\nTHE KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KING ATHALARIC TO HILDERIC, KING OF THE VANDALS (A.D. 527).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murder of Amalafrida, widow of King Thrasamund and sister\r\nof Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n'Friendship and relationship are turned to bitterness by the tidings\r\nthat Amalafrida, of divine memory, the distinguished ornament of our\r\nrace, has been put to death by you[574]. If you had any cause of\r\noffence against her, you ought to have sent her to us for judgment.\r\nWhat you have done is a species of parricide. If the succession, on\r\nthe death of her husband, passed to another [yourself], that was no\r\nreason why a woman should be embroiled in the contest. It was really\r\nan addition to your nobility to have the purple dignity of the Amal\r\nblood allied to the lineage of the Hasdingi.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: With reference to this event Victor Tunnunensis writes:\r\n'Cujus (Trasamundi) uxor Amalafrida fugiens ad barbaros congressione\r\nfacta Capsae juxta Heremum capitur, et in custodia privata moritur.'\r\nProcopius (De B. Vandalico i. 9) says: [Greek: Kai sphisi (tois\r\nBandilois) xynênechthê Theuderichô te kai Gotthois en Italia ek te\r\nsymmachôn kai philôn polemioi genesthai tên te gar Amalaphridan en\r\nphylakê eschon kai tous Gotthous diephtheiran hapantas epenenkontes\r\nautois neôterizein es te Bandilous kai Hilderichon]. Both Victor and\r\nProcopius seem to place the conflict before the death of Theodoric;\r\nVictor says A.D. 523. Probably therefore the fighting, the capture of\r\nAmalafrida, and the death of her countrymen, took place in that year,\r\nthe year of her husband's death and Hilderic's accession. Three or\r\nfour years later (526 or 527), when her brother Theodoric was dead,\r\nthe imprisoned princess was murdered--a grievous insult to the young\r\nSovereign of the Goths, her great-nephew.]\r\n\r\n'Our Goths keenly feel the insults conveyed in this deed, since to\r\nslay the royal lady of another race is to despise the valour of that\r\nrace and doubt its willingness to avenge her.\r\n\r\n'We send you two ambassadors to hear what your excuses are. We hear\r\nthat you pretend that her death was natural. And you also must send\r\nambassadors in return to us to explain the matter, without war or\r\nbloodshed, and either pacify us or acknowledge your guilt. If you do\r\nnot do this, all ties of alliance between us are broken, and we must\r\nleave you to the judgment of the Divine Majesty, which heard the blood\r\nof Abel crying from the ground.'\r\n\r\n\r\n2. EDICT OF KING ATHALARIC.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppression of the Curiales.]\r\n\r\n'The body of the Republic is so tempered together that if one member\r\nsuffers all the members suffer with it. The Curiales, whose name is\r\nderived from their care (cura) and forethought, are, we are told,\r\nmolested by hostile proceedings, so that what was bestowed upon them\r\nas an honour turns out rather to their injury. What scandalous\r\ninjustice! What an insupportable evil! that he who ought to have\r\nbenefited the Republic by his services, should often lose both fortune\r\nand liberty.\r\n\r\n'Wherefore by this edict we decree that if any Curialis suffer\r\noppression, if anyone, without the express warrant of ourselves or the\r\nhigh officers of State whose business it is, inflict upon a Curialis\r\nany injury or loss of property, he shall pay a fine of 10 lbs. of gold\r\n(£400), to go to the benefit of the person thus oppressed; or, if his\r\nproperty be insufficient to pay this fine, he shall be beaten with\r\nclubs. The Curialis must then give additional diligence to the\r\ndischarge of his public duties, since his debt to the State is, as it\r\nwere, increased by the protection which we are thus affording him. As\r\nfor the farms of Curiales, in connection with which the greatest\r\nfrauds are practised on poor men, let no one seek to obtain them by an\r\nunlawful purchase; for a contract cannot be called a contract when it\r\nis in violation of the law[575]. The Judges must help the Curiales\r\nagainst the molestations of Sajones and other officials. It is a\r\ngrievous offence, when the very person to whom is entrusted the duty\r\nof defending the weak, himself turns oppressor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: 'Praedia Curialium, unde maximae mediocribus parantur\r\ninsidiae, nullus illicita emptione pervadat. Quia contractus dici non\r\npotest nisi qui de legibus venit.']\r\n\r\n'Raise your heads in hope, oh ye oppressed ones! lift up your hearts,\r\nye who are weighed down with a load of evils! To each citizen his own\r\ncity is his Republic. Administer justice in your cities in conformity\r\nwith the general will. Let your various ranks live on a footing of\r\njustice. Do not oppress the weak, lest you in your turn be deservedly\r\noppressed by the strong. This is the penalty of wrong-doing, that each\r\none suffers in his own person what he has wantonly inflicted on\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n'Live then in justice and moderation. Follow the example of the\r\ncranes, who change the order of their flight, making foremost\r\nhindmost, and hindmost foremost, without difficulty, each willingly\r\nobeying its fellow--a commonwealth of birds.\r\n\r\n'You have, according to the laws, power over your citizens. Not in\r\nvain has Antiquity conceded to you the title of Curia: not vainly did\r\nit call you the Lesser Senate, the nerves and vital organs of the\r\nState[576]. What is not contained of honour and power in that title!\r\nFor that which is compared to the Senate is excluded from no kind of\r\nglory.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: 'Non enim incassum vobis Curiam concessit Antiquitas,\r\nnon inaniter appellavit Minorem Senatum, nervos quoque vocitans ac\r\nviscera civitatum.']\r\n\r\n\r\n3. KING ATHALARIC TO BERGANTINUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, COMES [PATRIMONII],\r\nAND PATRICIAN[577].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 577: Cf. viii. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gold-mining in Italy.]\r\n\r\n'Gold, as well as many other fair fruits of Nature which gold can buy,\r\nis said to be produced by our generous Italy. Theodorus, who is an\r\nexpert in such matters, asserts that gold will be found on the farm\r\nRusticiana in Bruttii[578]. Let your Greatness therefore send a\r\n_Cartarius_ to commence mining operations on that spot. The work of a\r\nminer resembles that of a mole. He burrows underground, far from the\r\nlight of day. Sometimes the sides of his passages fall in and his way\r\nis closed up behind him; but if he emerge safely with his treasure,\r\nhow happy is he! Then the gold-miner proceeds to immerse his ore in\r\nwater, that the heavy metal may be separated from the lighter earth;\r\nthen to submit it to a fervent heat, that it may thence derive its\r\nbeautiful colour[579].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 578: Have we any clue to the geographical position of this\r\nfarm? The only Rusticiana known to the Itineraries is in Spain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 579: 'Origo quidem nobilis, sed de flamma suscipit vim\r\ncoloris, ut magis credas inde nasci, cujus similitudine videtur\r\nornari. Sed cum auro tribuat splendidum ruborem, argento confert\r\nalbissimam lucem. Ut mirum sit, unam substantiam tradere, quod rebus\r\ndissimilibus possit aptari.' Have we here a hint of 'the transmutation\r\nof metals?' Cassiodorus seems to think that it is only the furnace\r\nthat makes the difference between the colours of gold and of silver.]\r\n\r\n'Let then the land of Bruttii pay her tribute in gold, the most\r\ndesired of all treasure. To seek gold by war is wicked, by voyages\r\ndangerous, by swindling shameful; but to seek it from Nature in its\r\nown home is righteous. No one is hurt by this honest gain. Griffins\r\nare said to dig for gold and to delight in the contemplation of this\r\nmetal; but no one blames them, because their proceedings are not\r\ndictated by criminal covetousness. For it is not the act itself, but\r\nthe motive for the act, that gives it its moral quality.'\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KING ATHALARIC TO ABUNDANTIUS, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A family of Curiales permitted to step down into the ranks\r\nof the Possessores.]\r\n\r\n'The _pietas_ of the King is happily shown in moderating the sentence\r\nof the law, where for certain reasons it bears with especial hardness\r\non anyone. The Curiales have peculiar advantages in their opportunity\r\nof being thus liberated by the Sovereign from the performance of their\r\nduties[580]. It is reasonable to release a Curialis whose health\r\nprevents him from fulfilling his appointed task; and a numerous Curia\r\nwill never miss a few names out of so large a number.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: 'Neque enim ob aliud Curiales leges sacratissimae\r\nligaverunt, nisi ut cum illos soli principes absolverent, indulgentiae\r\npraeconia reperirent.']\r\n\r\n'Therefore let your Illustrious Magnificence remove Agenantia, wife\r\n[or widow?] of the most eloquent man Campanianus, dwelling in Lucania,\r\nfrom the album of her Curia, and her sons also, so that posterity may\r\nnever know that they were formerly liable to Curial duties.\r\n\r\n'Remitted to the ranks of [mere] Possessores they will now be liable\r\nto the same demands which formerly [as members of the Curia] they made\r\nupon others. They will now dread the face of the tax-collector\r\n(compulsor), and will begin to fear the mandates by which formerly\r\nthey made themselves feared[581]. Still this is a sign of their past\r\ngood life, that they are willing to live without office _among_ a\r\npopulation whose dislike they are not conscious of having incurred,\r\nand _under_ old colleagues whom they know that they have not incited\r\nto an abuse of their powers.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 581: 'Formidare delegata incipient, per quae antea\r\ntimebantur.' To translate by an analogy, 'And will tremble at the\r\nrate-summonses, their signatures to which used to make other men\r\ntremble.']\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING ATHALARIC TO THE BISHOPS AND FUNCTIONARIES OF ----[582].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: 'Episcopis et Honoratis.' Perhaps it is from motives of\r\ndelicacy that Cassiodorus has not added the name of the Province.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forestalling and regrating of corn prohibited.]\r\n\r\n'We learn with regret by the complaint of the Possessores of your\r\ndistrict that the severity of famine is being increased by the conduct\r\nof certain persons who have bought up corn and are holding it for\r\nhigher prices. In a time of absolute famine there can be no \"higgling\r\nof the market;\" the hungry man will submit to be cheated rather than\r\nlet another get the food before him[583].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 583: 'In necessitate siquidem penuriae pretii nulla\r\ncontentio est: dum patitur quis induci ne possit aliquâ tarditate\r\npercelli.']\r\n\r\n'To stop this practice we send to you the present messengers, whose\r\nbusiness it is to examine all the stores of corn collected for public\r\ndistribution[584] or otherwise, to leave to each family sufficient for\r\nits needs, and to purchase the remainder from the owners at a fair\r\nmarket price. Co-operate with these orders of ours cheerfully, and do\r\nnot grumble at them. Complain not that your freedom is interfered\r\nwith. There is no free-trade in crime[585]. If you work with us you\r\nwill earn good renown for yourselves; if against us, the King's\r\nreputation will gain by your loss. It is the sign of a good ruler to\r\nmake men act righteously, even against their wills.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: 'Sive in gradu [panis gradilis?] sive in aliis locis.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: A paraphrase, confessedly anachronistic, of 'Ne quis\r\nergo venditionem sibi impositam conqueratur, sciat libertatem in\r\ncrimine non requiri.']\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING ATHALARIC TO ----, PRIMISCRINIUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A furlough granted for a visit to Baiae.]\r\n\r\n'You complain that your health is failing under the long pressure of\r\nyour work, and that you fear, if you absent yourself, you may lose the\r\nemoluments of your office. At the same time you ask leave to visit\r\nthe Baths of Baiae. Go then with a mind perfectly at rest as to your\r\nemoluments, which we will keep safe for you. Seek the Sun, seek the\r\npure air and smiling shore of that lovely bay, thickly set with\r\nharbours and dotted with noble islands--that bay in which Nature\r\ndisplays all her marvels and invites man to explore her secrets. There\r\nis the Lake of Avernus, with its splendid supply of oysters. There are\r\nlong piers jutting out into the sea; and the most delightful fishing\r\nin the world is to be had in the fish-ponds--open to the sky--on\r\neither side of them. There are warm baths, heated not by brick-work\r\nflues and smoky balls of fire, but by Nature herself. The pure air\r\nsupplies the steam and softly stimulates perspiration, and the\r\nhealth-giving work is so much the better done as Nature is above Art.\r\nLet the Coralli [in Moesia, on the shore of the Euxine] boast their\r\nwonderful sea, let the pearl fisheries of India vaunt themselves. In\r\nour judgment Baiae, for its powers of bestowing pleasure and health,\r\nsurpasses them all. Go then to Baiae to bathe, and have no fear about\r\nthe emoluments.'\r\n\r\n\r\n7. KING ATHALARIC TO REPARATUS, PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[We learn from Procopius ('De Bello Gotthico' i. 26) that Reparatus\r\nwas brother of Pope Vigilius; that in 537 he escaped from the\r\ncaptivity in which the other Senators were kept at Ravenna by Witigis,\r\nand fled to Milan. In 539 Reparatus, who was then Praefectus\r\nPraetorio, was captured at Milan by the Goths, hewn in pieces, and his\r\nflesh given to the dogs (Ibid. ii. 21).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reparatus appointed Praefectus Urbis.]\r\n\r\n'The son of a high official naturally aspires to emulate his father's\r\ndignities. Your father had a distinguished career, first as Comes\r\nLargitionum, then as Praefectus Praetorio. While holding the latter\r\noffice, he repaired the Senate-house, restored to the poor the gifts\r\n(?) of which they had been deprived[586], and though not himself a man\r\nof liberal education, pleased all by the natural charm of his manner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: 'Curiam reparans, pauperibus ablata restituens.']\r\n\r\n'You have those advantages of mental training which were denied to\r\nyour father. Education lifts an obscure man on to a level with nobles,\r\nbut also adorns him who is of noble birth. You have moreover been\r\nchosen as son-in-law by a man of elevated character, whose choice is\r\nin itself a mark of your high merit. You are coming young to\r\noffice[587]; but, with such a man's approbation, you cannot be said to\r\nbe untried.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: 'Licet primaevus venias ad honorem.']\r\n\r\n'We therefore confer upon you for this Indiction the dignity of\r\nPraefect of the City. The eyes of the world are upon you. The Senate,\r\nthat illustrious and critical body, the youngest members of which are\r\ncalled _Patres_, will listen to your words. See that you say nothing\r\nwhich can displease those wise men, whose praise, though hard to win,\r\nwill be most sweet to your ears. Diligently help the oppressed. Hand\r\non to your posterity the renown which you have received from your\r\nancestors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KING ATHALARIC TO COUNT OSUIN (OR OSUM), VIR ILLUSTRIS[588].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: Cf. iii. 26 and iv. 9. In the former letter he is\r\ncalled Osun.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Osuin made Governor of Dalmatia and Savia.]\r\n\r\n'We reward our faithful servants with high honours, hoping thereby to\r\nquicken the slothful into emulation, when they ask themselves why,\r\nunder such an impartial rule, they too do not receive promotion.\r\n\r\n'We therefore again entrust to your Illustrious Greatness the\r\nProvinces of Dalmatia and S(u)avia. We need not hold up to you the\r\nexamples of others. You have only to imitate yourself, and to confer\r\nnow again in your old age the same blessings on those Provinces which,\r\nas a younger man, you bestowed on them under our grandfather.'\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING ATHALARIC TO ALL THE GOTHS AND ROMANS (IN DALMATIA AND SAVIA).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We send back to you the Illustrious Count Osuin, whose valour and\r\njustice you already know, to ward off from you the fear of foreign\r\nnations, and to keep you from unjust demands. With him comes the\r\nIllustrious Severinus[589], that with one heart and one mind, like the\r\nvarious reeds of an organ, they may utter their praiseworthy precepts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: We are not told in what capacity Severinus came.\r\nProbably it was on account of Osuin's age that Severinus was\r\nassociated with him.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remission of Augmentum.]\r\n\r\n'As an act of grace on the commencement of our reign, we direct the\r\nCount of the Patrimony to remit to you all the super-assessment\r\n(augmentum) which was fixed for your Province at the fourth\r\nIndiction[590].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 590: 'Per quartam Indictionem quod a nobis augmenti nomine\r\nquaerebatur illustrem virum Comitem Patrimonii nostri nunc jussimus\r\nremovere.' As the fourth Indiction began Sept. 525, in the lifetime of\r\nTheodoric, it is clear that that date belongs to the imposition, not\r\nto the removal of the 'augmentum.']\r\n\r\n'We also grant that when the aforesaid person [Severinus] returns to\r\nour presence, you may send suitable men with him to inform us of your\r\nfinancial position, that we may, by readjustment of the taxes, lighten\r\nyour load if it be still too heavy. Nothing consolidates the Republic\r\nso much as the uninjured powers of the taxpayer.'\r\n\r\n\r\n10. KING ATHALARIC TO ALL THE PROVINCIALS OF THE CITY OF SYRACUSE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remission of Augmentum to Syracusans.]\r\n\r\n'Lately we announced to you our accession: now we wish to confer upon\r\nyou a benefit in the matter of taxes. For we look on that only as our\r\nrevenue which the cultivator pays cheerfully. Our grandfather,\r\nconsidering the great increase in wealth and population which his long\r\nand peaceful reign had brought with it, thought it prudent to increase\r\nthe taxes to be paid by the Province of Sicily[591]. He was quite\r\nright in doing this, but he thereby prepared for us, his young\r\nsuccessor, an opportunity of conferring an unexpected favour, for we\r\nhereby remit to you all the augmentum which was assessed upon you at\r\nthe fourth Indiction. And not only so, but all that you have already\r\npaid under this head for the fifth Indiction (526-7) we direct the\r\ntax-collectors to carry to your credit on account[592].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: 'Avus noster de suis beneficiis magna praesumens (quia\r\nlonga quies et culturam agris praestitit et populos ampliavit) intra\r\nSiciliam provinciam sub consueta prudentiae suae moderatione censum\r\nstatuit subflagitari ut vobis cresceret devotio, quibus se facultas\r\nextenderat.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 592: This most be the meaning of 'quicquid a discursoribus\r\nnovi census per quintam Indictionem probatur affixum, ad vestram eos\r\nfecimus deferre notitiam.']\r\n\r\n'Besides this, if anyone have to complain of oppression on the part of\r\nthe Governors of the Province, let him seek at once a remedy from our\r\nPiety. Often did our grandfather of glorious memory grieve over the\r\nslowness of the Governors to obey their letters of recall, feeling\r\nsure that they were lingering in the Provinces neither for his good\r\nnor yours.\r\n\r\n'We however, with God's help, shall go on in the good work which we\r\nhave begun. You have a Prince who, the older he grows, the more will\r\nlove you. We send to you our Sajo Quidila, who will convey to you our\r\norders on this matter.'\r\n\r\n\r\n11. KING ATHALARIC TO GILDIAS, VIR SPECTABILIS, COUNT OF SYRACUSE.\r\n\r\n12. KING ATHALARIC TO VICTOR AND WITIGISCLUS (OR WIGISICLA), VIRI\r\nSPECTABILES, CENSITORES[593] OF SICILY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 593: Tax-collectors. The word is unknown to the Notitia, but\r\nCensuales occurs once in it (Not. Occ. iv.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppressions exercised by the King's officers in Sicily\r\nrebuked.]\r\n\r\nVictor and Witigisclus are sharply rebuked for their delay in\r\ndesisting from the oppression of the Provincials and coming to the\r\nCourt of Theodoric when called for[594], a delay which is made more\r\nsuspicious by their not having presented themselves to welcome\r\nAthalaric on his accession. Both they and Count Gildias are informed\r\nof the King's decision to remit the increased tax imposed at the\r\nfourth Indiction (Sept. 525); and the two Censitores are recommended,\r\nif they are conscious of having oppressed or injured any of the\r\nProvincials, to remedy the matter themselves, as the King has given\r\nall the Sicilians leave to appeal to himself against their\r\noppressions: and the complaints of the Sicilians, though distant, will\r\ncertainly reach his ears.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 594: 'Quos etiam seris praeceptionibus credidit esse\r\nadmonendos, ut _relicto tandem provincialium gravamine_ ad ejus\r\ndeberetis justitiam festinare.']\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING ATHALARIC TO WILLIAS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, COMES PATRIMONII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase of emoluments of Domestici.]\r\n\r\n'Your Greatness informs us of cases that have come to your knowledge,\r\nin which the Guards (Domestici) attending the Counts who are appointed\r\n[to the government of various Provinces] have oppressed the\r\nProvincials by their exactions. As we believe that there is some\r\nexcuse for this in the smallness of their _emolumenta_, which at\r\npresent consist of only 200 solidi (£120) and ten rations (Annonae),\r\nwe direct that you henceforth pay them, as from the fifth Indiction\r\n(Sept. 526), 50 solidi (£30) annually, in addition to the above,\r\ncharging this further payment to our account. By taking away\r\nNecessity, the mother of crimes, we hope that the practice of sinning\r\nwill also be removed. If, after this, anyone is found oppressing the\r\nProvincials, let him lose his _emolumenta_ altogether. Our gifts\r\nennoble the receiver, and are given in order to take away from him any\r\npretext for begging from others.'\r\n\r\n[The Domestici were a very select corps of Life-guardsmen; probably\r\nonly a very small number of them would accompany a Provincial Governor\r\nto his charge. This may explain what seems an extraordinarily high\r\nrate of pay. Perhaps it is the Comes himself, not his Domestici, who\r\nis to receive the emolumenta here specified; but, if so, the letter is\r\nvery obscurely expressed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING ATHALARIC TO GILDIAS, VIE SPECTABILIS, COUNT OF SYRACUSE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppressive acts charged against Gildias, Comes of\r\nSyracuse.]\r\n\r\n'We hear great complaints of you from the Sicilians; but, as they are\r\nwilling to let bye-gones be bye-gones, we accede to their request, but\r\ngive you the following warning:\r\n\r\n'(1) You are said to have extorted large sums from them on pretence of\r\nrebuilding the walls, which you have not done. Either repay them the\r\nmoney or build up their walls. It is too absurd, to promise\r\nfortifications and give instead to the citizens hideous\r\ndesolation[595].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 595: 'Nimis enim absurdum est, spondere munitiones et dare\r\ncivibus excecrabiles vastitates.']\r\n\r\n'(2) You are said to be claiming for the Exchequer (under the name of\r\n\"Fiscus Caducus\") the estates of deceased persons, without any sort of\r\nregard for justice, whereas that title was only intended to apply to\r\nthe case of strangers dying without heirs, natural or testamentary.\r\n\r\n'(3) You are said to be oppressing the suitors in the Courts with\r\ngrievous charges[596], so that you make litigation utterly ruinous to\r\nthose who undertake it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 596: 'Conventiones.' I think the complaint here is of the\r\nexpenses of 'executing process.' It is not as Judge but as the\r\nfunctionary who carries the Judge's orders into effect that Gildias is\r\nhere blamed.]\r\n\r\n'We order therefore that when _our_[597] decrees are being enforced\r\nagainst a beaten litigant, the gratuity claimed by the officer shall\r\nbe the same which our glorious grandfather declared to be\r\npayable--according to the respective ranks of the litigants--to the\r\nSajo who was charged with the enforcement of the decree; for\r\ngratuities ought not to be excessive[598].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 597: 'Nostra' (the reading of Nivellius) seems evidently a\r\nbetter reading than 'vestra' (which Migne has adopted).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: 'Commodum debet esse _cum modo_.' A derivation or a\r\npun.]\r\n\r\n'But if _your_ decrees are being enforced--and that must be only in\r\ncases against persons with whom the edicts allow you to\r\ninterfere[599]--then your officer must receive half the gratuity\r\nallowed to him who carries our decrees into execution. It is obviously\r\nimproper that the man who only performs _your_ orders should receive\r\nas much as is paid out of reverence for _our_ command. Anyone\r\ninfringing this constitution is to restore fourfold.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: 'Duntaxat in illis causis atque personis, ubi te\r\nmisceri edicta voluerunt.']\r\n\r\n'(4) The edicts of our glorious grandfather, and all the precepts\r\nwhich he made for the government of Sicily, are to be so obediently\r\nobserved that he shall be held guilty of sacrilege who, spurred on by\r\nhis own beastly disposition, shall try to break down the bulwark of\r\nour commands[600].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 600: 'Quisquis belluinis moribus excitatus munimen\r\ntentaverit irrumpere jussionum.']\r\n\r\n'(5) It is said that you cite causes between two Romans, even against\r\ntheir will, before your tribunal. If you are conscious that this has\r\nbeen done by you, do not so presume in future, lest while seeking the\r\noffice of Judge, for which you are incompetent, you wake up to find\r\nyourself a culprit. You, of all men, ought to be mindful of the\r\nEdictum, since you insist on its being followed by others. If not, if\r\nthis rule is not observed by you, your whole power of decreeing shall\r\nbe taken from you. Let the administration of the laws be preserved\r\nintact to the _Judices Ordinarii_. Let the litigants throng, as they\r\nought to do, to the Courts of their _Cognitores_. Do not be gnawed by\r\nenvy of their pomp. The true praise of the Goths is\r\n_law-abidingness_[601]. The more seldom the litigant is seen in your\r\npresence the greater is your renown. Do you defend the State with your\r\narms; let the Romans plead before their own law courts in peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 601: 'Gothorum laus est civilitas custodita.']\r\n\r\n'(6) You are also accused of insisting on buying the cargoes of\r\nvessels that come to the port at your own price [and selling again at\r\na higher]--a practice the very suspicion of which is injurious to an\r\nofficial, even if it cannot be proved against him in fact[602].\r\nWherefore, if you wish to avoid the rumour of this deed, let the\r\nBishop and people of the city come forward as witnesses on behalf of\r\nyour conscience[603]. Prices ought to be fixed by the common\r\ndeliberation [of buyer and seller]; since no one likes a commercial\r\ntransaction which is forced upon the unwilling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 602: This seems a possible interpretation of a dark\r\nsentence: 'Navigiis vecta commercia te suggerunt occupare, et ambitu\r\ncupiditatis exosae solum antiqua pretia definire, quod non creditur a\r\nsuspicione longinquum etiam si non sit actione vicinum.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 603: Is this a kind of compurgation which is here proposed?]\r\n\r\n'Wherefore we have thought it proper to warn your Sublimity by these\r\npresents, since we do not like those whom we love to be guilty of\r\nexcess, nor to hear evil reports of those who are charged with\r\nreforming the morals of others.'\r\n\r\n[This is an important letter, especially when taken in connection with\r\nthe words of Totila (Procopius, 'De Bello Gotthico' iii. 16), as to\r\nthe exceptional indulgence with which the Gothic Kings had treated\r\nSicily, 'leaving, at the request of the inhabitants, very few soldiers\r\nin the island, that there might be no distaste to their freedom or to\r\ntheir general prosperity.'\r\n\r\nGildias is evidently a Goth, and though a _Vir Spectabilis_ and\r\nholding a Roman office--the Comitiva Syracusanae Civitatis--still it\r\nis essentially a military office, and he has no business to divert\r\ncauses from the Judices Ordinarii to his tribunal, though probably a\r\nRoman Comes might often do this without serious blame. But by his\r\ndoing so, the general principle, that in purely Roman causes a Goth is\r\nnot to interfere, seems to be infringed, and therefore he receives\r\nthis sharp reprimand to prevent his doing it again.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING ATHALARIC TO POPE JOHN II (532).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Against Simony at Papal elections.]\r\n\r\n'The Defensor of the Roman Church hath informed us in his tearful\r\npetition that lately, when a President was sought for the Papal chair,\r\nso much were the usual largesses to the poor augmented by the promises\r\nwhich had been extorted from the candidate, that, shameful to say,\r\neven the sacred vessels were exposed to sale in order to provide the\r\nnecessary money[604].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 604: 'Quosdam nefariâ machinatione necessitatem temporis\r\naucupatos, ita facultates pauperum extortis promissionibus ingravasse,\r\nut quod dictu nefas est, etiam sacra vasa emptioni publicae viderentur\r\nexposita.']\r\n\r\n'Therefore let your Holiness know that by this present decree, which\r\nrelates also to all the Patriarchs and Metropolitan Churches [the five\r\nMetropolitan Churches in Rome, and such Sees as Milan, Aquileia,\r\nRavenna], we confirm the wise law passed by the Senate in the time of\r\nthe most holy Pope Boniface [predecessor of John II]. By it any\r\ncontract or promise made by any person in order to obtain a Bishopric\r\nis declared void.\r\n\r\n'Anyone refusing to refund money so received is to be declared guilty\r\nof sacrilege, and restitution is to be enforced by the Judge.'\r\n\r\n'Should a contention arise as to an election to the Apostolic See, and\r\nthe matter be brought to our Palace for decision, we direct that the\r\nmaximum fee to be paid, on the completion of the necessary documents\r\n(?), shall be 3,000 solidi [£1,800][605]; but this is only to be\r\nexacted from persons of sufficient ability to pay it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605: 'Et quia omnia decet sub ratione moderari, nec possunt\r\ndici justa quae nimia sunt, cum de Apostolici consecratione Pontificis\r\nintentio fortasse pervenerit, et ad Palatium nostrum producta fuerit\r\naltercatio populorum, suggerentes (?) nobis intra tria millia\r\nsolidorum, cum collectione cartarum censemus accipere.']\r\n\r\n'Patriarchs [Archbishops of the other great Italian Sees] under\r\nsimilar circumstances are to pay not more than 2,000 solidi [£1,200].\r\n\r\n'No one is to give [on his consecration] more than 500 solidi [£300]\r\nto the poor.\r\n\r\n'Anyone professing to obtain for money the suffrage of any one of our\r\nservants on behalf of a candidate for Papacy or Patriarchate, shall be\r\nforced to refund the money. If it cannot be recovered from him, it may\r\nbe from his heirs. He himself shall be branded with infamy.\r\n\r\n'Should the giver of the money have been bound by such oaths, that,\r\nwithout imperilling his soul, he cannot disclose the transaction,\r\nanyone else may inform, and on establishing the truth of his\r\naccusation, receive a third part of the money so corruptly paid, the\r\nrest to go to the churches themselves, for the repair of the fabric or\r\nfor the daily ministry. Remember the fate of Simon Magus. We have\r\nordered that this decree be made known to the Senate and people by the\r\nPraefect of the City.'\r\n\r\n[I think the early part of this letter gives us the clue to the\r\npretext under which these simoniacal practices were introduced. It was\r\nusual for the Pope on his election to give a certain sum of money to\r\nthe poor. Then at a vehemently contested election certain of the\r\nvoters--perhaps especially the priests of the different _tituli_ of\r\nRome--claimed to be distributors of the Papal bounty, a large part of\r\nwhich they no doubt kept for themselves.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING ATHALARIC TO SALVANTIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS, PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\nRehearses the motives of the previous edict, and directs that both it\r\nand the Senatus Consulta having reference to the same subject [and\r\nframed two years previously], be engraved on marble tablets, and fixed\r\nup in a conspicuous place, before the Atrium of St. Peter the Apostle.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SAME (BETWEEN 532 AND 534).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Release of two Roman citizens accused of sedition.]\r\n\r\n'We cannot bear that there should be sadness in Rome, the head of the\r\nworld. We hear with regret from the Apostolic Pope John, and other\r\nnobles, that A and B, who are Romans, on a mere suspicion of sedition\r\nare being macerated by so long imprisonment that the whole city mourns\r\nfor them; no gladness of a holyday and no respect for the Papal\r\nname[606] (which is most dear to us) availing to mitigate their\r\nconfinement. This treatment of persons against whom no crime has been\r\nproved distresses us much, and we admonish your Greatness, wherever\r\nyou may succeed in finding them, to set them free. If, confident in\r\ntheir innocence, they think that they have been unjustly tormented, we\r\ngive them liberty to make their appeal to the laws. Judges were\r\nraised to their high estate, not to oppress but to defend the\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 606: 'Nec ulla--quae apud nos est gratissima--nominis sui\r\ndignitas subveniret.' I think _sui_ must refer to the\r\nrecently-mentioned _Papa Johannes_.]\r\n\r\n'Now let the Romans return to their ancient gladness; nor let them\r\nthink that any [rulers] please us but those who seek to act with\r\nfairness and moderation. Let them understand that our forefathers\r\nunderwent labours and dangers that _they_ might have rest; and that we\r\nare expending large sums in order that they may rejoice with garrulous\r\nexultation. For even if they have before now suffered some rough and\r\nunjust treatment, let them not believe that that is a thing to be\r\nneglected by our Mildness. No; for we give ourselves no rest, that\r\nthey may enjoy secure peace and calm gladness. Let them understand at\r\nonce that _we_ cannot love the men whose excesses have made them\r\nterrible to our subjects. Whose favour do those men expect to win who\r\nhave earned the dislike of their fellow-citizens? They might have\r\nreaped a harvest of the public love, and instead thereof they have so\r\nacted that their names are justly held in execration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n18. THE EDICT OF ATHALARIC.\r\n\r\n[This edict is minutely examined by Dahn ('Könige der Germanen' iv.\r\n123-135). I have adopted his division of paragraphs, though rather\r\ndisposed to think that the 'De Donationibus' should be broken up into\r\ntwo, to prevent counting the Epilogue as a section. See also Manso\r\n('Geschichte der Ostrogothen' 405-415).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Athalaric.]\r\n\r\n'_Prologue._ This edict is a general one. No names are mentioned in\r\nit, and those who are conscious of innocence need take no offence at\r\nanything contained therein.\r\n\r\n'For long an ominous whisper has reached our ears that certain\r\npersons, despising _civilitas_, affect a life of beastly\r\nbarbarism[607], returning to the wild beginnings of society, and\r\nlooking with a fierce hatred on all human laws. The present seems to\r\nus a fitting time for repressing these men, in order that we may be\r\nhunting down vice and immorality within the Republic at the same time\r\nthat, with God's help, we are resisting her external foes. Both are\r\nhurtful, both have to be repelled; but the internal enemy is even more\r\ndangerous than the external. One, however, rests upon the other; and\r\nwe shall more easily sweep down the armies of our enemies if we subdue\r\nunder us the vices of the age. [This allusion to foreign enemies is\r\nperhaps explained by the hint in Jordanes ('De Reb. Get.' 59) of\r\nthreatened war with the Franks. But he gives us no sufficient\r\nindication of time to enable us to fix the date of the Edictum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 607: 'Affectare vivere belluinâ saevitiâ.']\r\n\r\n'I. _Forcible Appropriation of Landed Property_[608] (Pervasio). This\r\nis a crime which is quite inconsistent with _civilitas_, and we remit\r\nthose who are guilty of it to the punishment[609] provided by a law of\r\nDivus Valentinianus [Valentinian III. Novell. xix. 'De Invasoribus'],\r\nadding that if anyone is unable to pay the penalty therein provided he\r\nshall suffer banishment (deportatio). He ought to have been more chary\r\nof disobeying the laws if he had no means to pay the penalty. Judges\r\nwho shrink from obeying this law, and allow the _Pervasor_ to remain\r\nin possession of what he has forcibly annexed, shall lose their\r\noffices and be held liable to pay to our Treasury the same fine which\r\nmight have been exacted from him. If the _Pervasor_ sets the Judge's\r\nofficial staff (officium) at defiance, on the report of the Judge our\r\nSajones will make _him_ feel the weight of the royal vengeance who\r\nrefused to obey the [humbler] _Cognitor_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: 'Praedia urbana vel rustica.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 609: The punishment consisted in loss of all claim to the\r\nproperty--which was generally seized by someone who had some kind of\r\nostensible claim to it--and a penalty of equal value with that of the\r\nproperty wrongfully seized.]\r\n\r\n'II. _Affixing Titles to Property._ [When land had from any cause\r\nbecome public property, the Emperor's officers used to affix _tituli_,\r\nto denote the fact and to warn off all other claimants. Powerful men\r\nwho had dispossessed weaker claimants used to imitate this practice,\r\nand are here forbidden to do so.]\r\n\r\n'This offence shall subject the perpetrator to the same penalties as\r\n_pervasio_. It is really a kind of sacrilege to try to add the majesty\r\nof the royal name to the weight of his own oppression. Costs are to be\r\nborne by the defeated claimant.\r\n\r\n'III. _Suppression of Words in a Decree._ Anyone obtaining a decree\r\nagainst an adversary is to be careful to suppress nothing in the copy\r\nwhich he serves upon him. If he does so, he shall lose all the\r\nbenefits that he obtained. We wish to help honest men, not rogues.\r\n\r\n'IV. _Seduction of a Married Woman._ He who tries to interfere with\r\nthe married rights of another, shall be punished by inability to\r\ncontract a valid marriage himself. [This punishment of compulsory\r\ncelibacy is, according to Dahn, derived neither from Roman nor German\r\nlaw, but is possibly due to Church influence.] The offender who has no\r\nhope of present or future matrimony[610] shall be punished by\r\nconfiscation of half his property; or, if a poor man, by banishment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 610: 'Illis quos spes non habet praesentis conjugii vel\r\nfuturi.' It is not easy to see how the Judge could ascertain whether a\r\nman belonged to this claim or not.]\r\n\r\n'V. _Adultery_. All the statutes of the late King (divalis commonitio)\r\nin this matter are to be strictly observed. [Edict. Theodorici, § 38,\r\ninflicted the penalty of death on both offenders and on the abettors\r\nof the crime.]\r\n\r\n'VI. _Bigamy_ is to be punished with loss of all the offender's\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n'VII. _Concubinage._ If a married man forms a connection of this kind\r\nwith a free woman, she and all her children shall become the slaves\r\nof the injured wife. If with a woman who is a slave already, she shall\r\nbe subjected to any revenge that the lawful wife likes to inflict upon\r\nher, short of blood-shedding[611].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 611: 'Quod si ad tale flagitium ancilla pervenerit, excepta\r\npoena sanguinis, matronali subjaceat ultioni: ut illam patiatur\r\njudicem, quam formidare debuisset absentem.' These provisions are\r\nprobably of Germanic origin.]\r\n\r\n'VIII. _Donations_ are not to be extorted by terror, nor acquired by\r\nfraud, or as the price of immorality. Where a gift is _bonâ fide_, the\r\ndocument conveying it is to be drawn up with the strictness prescribed\r\nby Antiquity, in order to remove occasions of fraud.\r\n\r\n'IX. Magicians and other persons practising nefarious arts are to be\r\npunished by the severity of the laws. What madness to leave the Giver\r\nof life and seek to the Author of death! Let the Judges be especially\r\ncareful to avoid the contagion of these foul practices.\r\n\r\n'X. _Violence Exercised towards the Weak._ Let the condition of\r\nmediocrity be safe from the arrogance of the rich. Let the madness of\r\nbloodshed be avoided. To take the law into your own hands is to wage\r\nprivate war, especially in the case of those who are fortified by the\r\nauthority of our _tuitio_. If anyone attempts with foul presumption to\r\nact contrary to these principles, let him be considered a violator of\r\nour orders.\r\n\r\n'XI. _Appeals_ are not to be made twice in the same cause.\r\n\r\n'XII. _Epilogue._ But lest, while touching on a few points, we should\r\nbe thought not to wish the laws to be observed in other matters, we\r\ndeclare that all the edicts of ourself and of our lord and\r\ngrandfather, which were confirmed by venerable deliberation[612], and\r\nthe whole body of decided law[613], be adhered to with the utmost\r\nrigour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 612: 'Quae sunt venerabili deliberatione firmata.' Is it\r\npossible that we have here a reference to a theoretical right of the\r\n_Senate_ to concur in legislation?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 613: 'Et usualia jura publica.' Dahn expands: 'All other\r\njuristic material, all sources of law--Roman _leges_ and _jus_, and\r\nGothic customary law--the whole inheritance of the State in public and\r\nprivate law.']\r\n\r\n'And these laws are so scrupulously guarded that our own oath is\r\ninterposed for their defence. Why enlarge further? Let the usual rule\r\nof law and the honest intent of our precepts be everywhere observed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n19. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promulgation of the Edict.]\r\n\r\n'Good laws are called forth by evil manners. If no complaints were\r\never heard, the Prince might take holiday. Stirred up by many and\r\nfrequent complaints of our people, we have drawn up certain\r\nregulations necessary for the Roman peace, in our edict which is\r\ndivided into twelve chapters, after the manner of the civil law[614].\r\nWe do not thereby abrogate, but rather confirm, the previously\r\nexisting body of law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 614: 'Necessaria quaedam Romanae quieti edictali programmate\r\nduodecim capitibus sicut jus civile legitur institutum in aevum\r\nservanda conscripsimus, quae custodita residuum jus non debilitare,\r\nsed potius corroborare videantur.']\r\n\r\n'Let this edict be read in your splendid assembly, and exhibited for\r\nthirty days by the Praefect of the City in the most conspicuous\r\nplaces. Thus shall our _civilitas_ be recognised, and truculent men\r\nlose their confidence. What insolent subjects[615] can indulge in\r\nviolence when the Sovereign condemns it? Our armies fight that there\r\nmay be peace at home. Let the Judges do their duty fearlessly, and\r\navoid foul corruption.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 615: Evidently aimed at the Goths.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. KING ATHALARIC TO ALL THE JUDGES OF THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'It is vexatious that, though we appoint you year by year to your\r\nduties, and leave no district without its Judge, there is yet such\r\ntardiness in administering justice that suitors come by preference to\r\nour distant Court.\r\n\r\n'To take away all excuse from you, and relieve the necessity of our\r\nsubjects, we have drawn up an edict which we desire you to exhibit for\r\nthirty days in the wonted manner at all places of public meeting.'\r\n\r\n\r\n21. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase of salaries of grammarians.]\r\n\r\n'You who are called Fathers should be interested in all that concerns\r\nthe education of your sons. We hear by certain whisperings that the\r\nteachers of eloquence at Rome are not receiving their proper reward,\r\nand that the sums appointed to be paid to the masters of schools are\r\nlessened by the haggling of some persons.\r\n\r\n'Grammar is the noble foundation of all literature, the glorious\r\nmother of eloquence. As a virtuous man is offended by any act of vice,\r\nas a musician is pained by a discordant note, so does the grammarian\r\nin a moment perceive a false concord.\r\n\r\n'The grammatical art is not used by barbarous kings: it abides\r\npeculiarly with legitimate sovereigns[616]. Other nations have arms:\r\nthe lords of the Romans alone have eloquence. Hence sounds the trumpet\r\nfor the legal fray in the Forum. Hence comes the eloquence of so many\r\nchiefs of the State. Hence, to say nothing more, even this discourse\r\nwhich is now addressed to you[617].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 616: 'Hac non utuntur barbari reges: apud legales dominos\r\nmanere cognoscitur singularis.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 617: 'Et, ut reliqua taceamus, hoc quod loquimur inde est.']\r\n\r\n'Wherefore let the teacher of grammar and of rhetoric, if he be found\r\nsuitable for his work and obey the decrees of the Praefect of the\r\nCity, be supported by your authority, and suffer no diminution of his\r\nsalary[618].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 618: 'Et semel Primi Ordinis vestri ac reliqui Senatus\r\namplissimi auctoritate firmatus.' What is the meaning of 'Primi\r\nOrdinis vestri?']\r\n\r\n'To prevent his being dependent in any way on the caprice of his\r\nemployer, let him receive half his salary at the end of half a year,\r\nand his _annonae_ at the customary times. If the person whose\r\nbusiness it is to pay him neglects this order, he shall be charged\r\ninterest on the arrears.\r\n\r\n'The Grammarian is a man to whom every hour unemployed is misery, and\r\nit is a shame that such a man should have to wait the caprice of a\r\npublic functionary before he gets his pay. We provide for the salaries\r\nof the play-actors, who minister only to the amusement of the public;\r\nand how much more for these men, the moulders of the style and\r\ncharacter of our youth! Therefore let them henceforward not have to\r\ntry the philosophical problem of thinking about two things at once,\r\nbut, with their minds at ease about their subsistence, devote\r\nthemselves with all their vigour to the teaching of liberal arts.'\r\n\r\n\r\n22. KING ATHALARIC TO PAULINUS, VIR CLARISSIMUS AND CONSUL (533).\r\n\r\n[Flavius Theodoras Paulinus Junior was Consul with the Emperor\r\nJustinian in 534. This letter was written in Sept. 533, about thirteen\r\nmonths before the death of Athalaric. Paulinus was son of Venantius\r\nand grandson of Liberius.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paulinus chosen as Consul.]\r\n\r\n'The absent from our Court need not fear that they will be disregarded\r\nin the distribution of honours, especially when they are sprung from\r\nan illustrious stock, the offspring of the Senate.\r\n\r\n'In your family Rome recognises the descendants of her ancient heroes\r\nthe Decii, who, in a great crisis, alone saved their country.\r\n\r\n'Take then for the twelfth Indiction the ensigns of the\r\nConsulship[619]. It is an arduous honour, but one which your family is\r\nwell used to. The Fasti are studded with its names, and nearly all\r\nthe Senate is of kin to you. Still, presume not too much on the merits\r\nof your ancestors, but rather seek to emulate their noble deeds.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 619: The twelfth Indiction began Sept. 1, 533. The Consul\r\nwould enter office Jan. 1, 534. Was he _designated_ when the great\r\nImperial officers were _appointed_ at the beginning of the Indiction?]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the Consulship of Paulinus.]\r\n\r\n'Judge of our esteem for your honourable body, Conscript Fathers,\r\nwhen, without any hesitation, we appoint your sons whom we have never\r\nseen to high office, because they are your sons.\r\n\r\n'We admire the Patrician Venantius, blessed as he has been with such\r\nan abundant progeny, and found equal to the weight of so many\r\nConsulships. His sons have been all temperate and lively; worthy\r\nmembers of the same distinguished family. They have been trained in\r\narms, their minds have been formed by letters, their bodies by the\r\nexercises of the gymnasium. They have learned to show constancy to\r\ntheir friends, loyalty to their lords; and they have succeeded to the\r\nvirtues of their ancestors, as they will to their patrimony. Wisely\r\nhusbanding his own fortune, Venantius has been able to support the\r\nhonour--gratifying, but burdensome--of seeing so many of his sons made\r\nConsuls. But this is an honour not strange to his family, sprung from\r\nthe ancient Decii. His hall is full of laurelled Fasces, and in his\r\nline one might almost say that each one is born a Consular.\r\n\r\n'Favour our candidate then, Conscript Fathers, and cherish him with\r\nthat care which the name of your body[620] signifies.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 620: _Curia_, from _cura_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KING ATHALARIC TO SENATOR [CASSIODORUS HIMSELF], PRAETORIAN\r\nPRAEFECT (SEPT. 1, 533).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus appointed Praetorian Praefect.]\r\n\r\n'If you had been hitherto an obscure person we might feel some doubt\r\nhow you would bear yourself in your new office, but your long and\r\nglorious career under our grandfather relieves us from any such\r\nanxieties. _His_ choice of you is a thing to be not discussed but\r\nreverently accepted. It was by him that we ourselves were chosen; and\r\nthe Divine favour so conspicuously followed him that no General whom\r\nhe selected was other than victorious, no Judge whom he appointed was\r\nother than just. In short, one might almost deem him to have been\r\nendowed with the gift of prophecy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Quaestorship.]\r\n\r\n'In your early manhood he received you into the office of Quaestor,\r\nand soon found you to be a conscientious man, learned in the law\r\nbeyond your years[621]. You were the chief ornament of your times,\r\ninasmuch as you, by your blameless service sustaining the weight of\r\nthat royal intellect by all the force of your eloquence, enabled him,\r\nwith his keen interest in all public affairs, to await the result with\r\nconfidence. In you he possessed a counsellor pleasant in the\r\ntransaction of business, rigid in his sense of justice, free from all\r\ntaint of avarice. You never fixed a scandalous tariff for the sale of\r\nhis benefits; and thus you reaped your reward in a wealth of public\r\nopinion, not in gold. It was because that just Prince proved you to be\r\naverse from all these vices that he selected you for his glorious\r\nfriendship. A wise judge, he threw upon you the weight of listening to\r\nthe arguments of contending parties; and so high was his opinion of\r\nyour tried sagacity that he at once uttered your decision as the\r\ngreatest benefit that he could confer on the litigants. How often did\r\nhe rank you among the oldest chiefs of his Council! How often was it\r\nseen that your young beginnings were more than a match for them, who\r\nhad the experience of long years behind them! What he found to praise\r\nin you was your excellent disposition, wide open for useful work,\r\ntight closed against the vices of avarice. Whereas, for some reason,\r\nit is rare to find amongst men, the hand closed and justice open.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 621: 'Primaevum recipiens ad Quaestoris Officium, mox\r\nreperit conscientia praeditum, et legum eruditione maturum.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His career as Master of the Offices.]\r\n\r\n'Let us pass on to the dignity of _Magister Officiorum_, which all men\r\nknew that you obtained, not from the reputation of wealth, but as a\r\ntestimony to your character. In this place you were always ready to\r\nhelp the [successive] Quaestors; for, when pure eloquence was\r\nrequired, the case was always put in your hands. The benignant\r\nSovereign claimed from you the fulfilment of duties which he knew that\r\nhe had not formally laid upon you; and such was the favour that he had\r\nfor you, while others laboured you received the reward of his abundant\r\npraises[622]. For under your administration no dignity kept its exact\r\nlimits; anything that was to be honestly done by all the chiefs of the\r\nState together, you considered to be entrusted to _your_ conscience\r\nfor its performance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 622: 'Et quadam gratia praejudiciali vacabat alios laborare,\r\nut te sententiae suae copiosa laude compleret.' One would have\r\nexpected Cassiodorus to say, 'You had the special privilege of doing\r\nother people's work and being praised for it, while they enjoyed their\r\nleisure;' but I hardly see how we can get this meaning out of 'vacabat\r\nalios laborare.']\r\n\r\n'No one found occasion to murmur anything to your disadvantage, though\r\nyou had to bear all the weight of unpopularity which comes from the\r\nSovereign's favour. The integrity of your life conquered those who\r\nlonged to detract from your reputation, and your enemies were obliged\r\nto utter the praises which their hearts abhorred; for even malice\r\nleaves manifest goodness unattacked, lest it be itself exposed to\r\ngeneral hatred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His friendship for Theodoric.]\r\n\r\n'To the Monarch you showed yourself a friendly Minister and an\r\nintimate Noble[623]. For when he had laid aside the cares of State, he\r\nwould seek in your conversation the opinions of wise men of old, that\r\nby his own deeds he might make himself equal to the ancients[624].\r\nInto the courses of the stars, into the gulfs of the sea, into the\r\nmarvels of springing fountains, this most acute questioner enquired,\r\nso that by his diligent investigations into the nature of things he\r\nseemed to be a Philosopher wearing the purple.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 623: 'Egisti rerum domino judicem familiarem et internum\r\nprocerem.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 624: 'Nam cum esset publica cura vacuatus, sententias\r\nprudentum a tuis fabulis exigebat; ut factis propriis se aequaret\r\nantiquis.']\r\n\r\n'It were long to narrate all your merits in the past. Let us rather\r\nturn to the future, and show how the heir of Theodoric's Empire\r\nproposes to pay the debts of Theodoric.\r\n\r\n'Therefore, with the Divine help, we bestow on you from the twelfth\r\nIndiction [Sept. 1, 533] the authority and insignia of Praetorian\r\nPraefect. Let the Provinces, which we know to have been hitherto\r\nwearied by the administration of dishonest men, fearlessly receive a\r\nJudge of tried integrity.\r\n\r\n'Though you have before you the example of your father's\r\nPraefecture[625], renowned throughout the Italian world, we do not so\r\nmuch set before you either that or any other example, as your own past\r\ncharacter, exhorting you to rule consistently with that. You have\r\nalways been averse from bribery; now earnestly help the victims of\r\ninjustice. We have purposely delayed your accession to this high\r\noffice that you might be the more heartily welcomed by the people, who\r\nexpected to see you clothed with it long ago. Diligently seek out\r\nanything belonging to the titles of the Praetorian Praefecture, of\r\nwhich it has been defrauded by the cupidity of others. We send you as\r\na light into a dark chamber, and expect that your sagacity and loyalty\r\nwill discover many hidden things.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 625: 'Quamvis habeas paternam Praefecturam, Italico orbe\r\npraedicatam.' This is one of the many proofs that Senator (now first\r\nadvanced to the office of Praefectus Praetorio) is the _son_ of the\r\nCassiodorus to whom the letter (i. 3) is addressed on his retirement\r\nfrom that office.]\r\n\r\n'We know that you will work not so much for the sake of honour as in\r\norder to satisfy your conscience; and work so done knows no limit to\r\nits excellence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n25. KING ATHALARIC TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME (ON THE PROMOTION\r\nOF CASSIODORUS SENATOR TO THE PRAETORIAN PRAEFECTURE).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eulogy of Cassiodorus on his appointment as Praetorian\r\nPraefect.]\r\n\r\n'We have loaded Senator with our benefits, Conscript Fathers, because\r\nhe abounds in virtue, is rich in excellence of character, and is\r\nalready full of the highest honours. But, in fact, we are his debtors.\r\nHow shall we repay that eloquent tongue of his, with which he set\r\nforth the deeds of the Prince, till he himself who had wrought them\r\nwondered at his story? In praising the reign of the wearer of the\r\npurple, he made it acceptable to your nation. For taxes may be paid to\r\na tyrant; praise, such as this, is given only to a good Prince.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Gothic History.]\r\n\r\n'Not satisfied with extolling living Kings, from whom he might hope\r\nfor a reward, he drew forth the Kings of the Goths from the dust of\r\nages, showing that the Amal family had been royal for seventeen\r\ngenerations, and proved that the origin of the Gothic people belonged\r\nto Roman history[626], adorning the whole subject with the flowers of\r\nhis learning gathered from wide fields of literature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 626: 'Tetendit se etiam in antiquam prosapiem nostram,\r\nlectione discens, quod vix majorum notitia cana retinebat. Iste Reges\r\nGothorum longa oblivione celatos, latibulo vetustatis eduxit. Iste\r\nAmalos cum generis sui claritate restituit, evidenter ostendens in\r\ndecimam septimam progeniem stirpem nos habere regalem. Originem\r\nGothicam historiam fecit esse Romanam, colligens quasi in unam coronam\r\ngermen floridum quod per librorum campos passim fuerat ante\r\ndispersum.']\r\n\r\n'In the early days of our reign what labour he gave to the settling of\r\nour affairs! He was alone sufficient for all. The duty of making\r\npublic harangues, our own private counsels, required him. He laboured\r\nthat the Empire might rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His official career.]\r\n\r\n'We found him Magister; but he discharged the duties of Quaestor, and\r\nwillingly bestowed on us, the heir, the experience which he had gained\r\nin the counsels of our grandfather.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His military services.]\r\n\r\n'And not only so, he helped the beginning of our reign both with his\r\narms and his pen. For when the care of our shores[627] occupied our\r\nroyal meditation, he suddenly emerged from the seclusion of his\r\ncabinet, boldly, like his ancestors, assumed the office of\r\nGeneral[628], and triumphed by his character when there was no enemy\r\nto overcome. For he maintained the Gothic warriors[629] at his own\r\ncharges, so that there should be no robbery of the Provincials on the\r\none hand, no too heavy burden on the exchequer on the other. Thus was\r\nthe soldier what he ought to be, the true defender, not the ravager of\r\nhis country. Then when the time for victualling the ships was over,\r\nand the war was laid aside, he shone as an administrator rather than a\r\nwarrior, healing, without injury to the litigants, the various suits\r\nwhich arose out of the sudden cessation of the contracts[630].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 627: Probably from some expected descent of the Vandals, in\r\nconnection with the affair of Amalafrida.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 628: 'Par suis majoribus ducatum sumpsit intrepidus.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 629: 'Deputatos.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 630: A conjectural translation of a difficult sentence: 'Mox\r\nautem ut tempus clausit navium commeatum, bellique cura resoluta est,\r\ningenium suum legum potius ductor exercuit: sanans sine damno\r\nlitigantium quod ante sub pretio comstabat esse laceratum.' I\r\nconjecture that by the sudden stoppage of the warlike preparations\r\nseveral of the contractors were in danger of being ruined, and there\r\nwas a general disposition to repudiate all purchases.]\r\n\r\n'Such was the glory of the military command of a Metellus in Asia, of\r\na Cato in Spain--a glory far more durable than any that can be derived\r\nfrom the varying shock of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His religious character.]\r\n\r\n'Yet with all these merits, how humble he has been, how modest, how\r\nbenevolent, how slow to wrath, how generous in the distribution of\r\nthat which is his own, how slow to covet the property of others! All\r\nthese virtues have been consolidated by his reading of the Divine\r\nBook, the fear of God helping him to triumph over baser, human\r\nmotives. Thus has he been rendered humble towards all, as one imbued\r\nwith heavenly teaching.\r\n\r\n'Him therefore, Conscript Fathers, we make, under God's blessing,\r\nPraetorian Praefect from the twelfth Indiction [Sept. 1, 533], that he\r\nmay repress by his own loyalty the trafficking of knaves, and may use\r\nhis power for the good of the Republic, bequeathing eternal renown to\r\nhis posterity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THIRTY-FIVE LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS:\r\n\r\nFOUR IN THE NAME OF QUEEN AMALASUENTHA.\r\nTWENTY-TWO IN THAT OF KING THEODAHAD.\r\nFOUR IN THAT OF HIS WIFE GUDELINA.\r\nFIVE IN THAT OF KING WITIGIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. QUEEN AMALASUENTHA TO JUSTINIAN THE EMPEROR (A.D. 534).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Association of Theodahad in the Sovereignty.]\r\n\r\n'I have hitherto forborne to distress you with the sad tidings of the\r\ndeath of my son of glorious memory, but now am able to mingle a joyful\r\nannouncement with this mournful message. We have promoted to the\r\nsceptre a man allied to us by a fraternal tie, that he may wear the\r\npurple robes of his ancestors, and may cheer our own soul by his\r\nprudent counsels. We are persuaded that you will give us your good\r\nwishes on this event, as we hope that every kind of prosperity may\r\nbefall the kingdom of your Piety. The friendship of princes is always\r\ncomely, but your friendship absolutely ennobles me, since that person\r\nis exalted in dignity who is united by friendship to your glory[631].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 631: 'Nam licet concordia Principum semper deceat, vestra\r\ntamen absolute me nobilitat; quoniam ille redditur amplius excelsus,\r\nqui vestrae gloriae fuerit unanimiter conjunctus.']\r\n\r\n'As we cannot in the short space of a letter express all that we\r\ndesire to say on such an occasion, we have entrusted certain verbal\r\nmessages to the ambassadors who bear this epistle.'\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THEODAHAD THE KING TO JUSTINIAN THE EMPEROR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'It is usual for newly-crowned Kings to signify their accession to the\r\ndifferent nations round them. I, in making this communication to you,\r\nam greatly favoured by Providence, feeling secure of your favour,\r\nbecause I know that my most excellent Lady and Sister has already\r\nattained it. I feel confident that I shall justify the choice of one\r\nwho shines in such a light of wisdom that she both governs her own\r\nkingdom with admirable forethought and keeps firmly the vows of\r\nfriendship which she has plighted to her neighbours. Partner of her\r\ncares, I desire also to be a partner of her wisely-formed friendships,\r\nthose especially which she has contracted with you, who have nothing\r\nlike unto you in the whole world. This alliance is no new thing: if\r\nyou will look back upon the deeds of our ancestors you will find that\r\nthere is a custom which has obtained the force of a law, that the\r\nAmals should be friendly with the Empire. So old a friendship is\r\nlikely to endure; and if, in obedience to it and to my Sister's\r\nchoice, I have your love, I shall feel that I am indeed a King.\r\n\r\n'The ambassadors who have charge of this letter will further express\r\nmy sentiments.'\r\n\r\n\r\n3. QUEEN AMALASUENTHA TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'After the death of our son of blessed memory[632] our love for the\r\ncommon weal overcame the yearnings of a mother's heart and caused us\r\nto seek your prosperity rather than an opportunity to indulge in our\r\nown sorrow. We have considered by what solace we should strengthen\r\nourselves for the cares of royalty. The same Providence which has\r\ndeprived us of a son in the dawn of manhood, has reserved for us the\r\naffection of a brother in mature age. Under the Divine auspices we\r\nhave chosen Theodahad[633] as the fortunate partner of our throne. We\r\ntwo, with conjoined counsels, shall now labour for the common welfare,\r\n_two_ in our meditations, _one_ in the action which results from them.\r\nThe stars give one another mutual help in ruling the heavens, and God\r\nhas bestowed on man two hands, two ears, two eyes, that each one of\r\nthese members should assist the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 632: 'Divae recordationis.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: Is there any authority for the reading of Nivellius,\r\n'Theo_baldum_?']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of Theodahad.]\r\n\r\n'Therefore exult, Conscript Fathers, and commend our deed to the\r\nblessing of the Almighty. Our sharing our power with another is a\r\npledge of its being wisely and gently exercised. By God's help we have\r\nopened our palace to a man of our own race, conspicuous by his\r\nillustrious position, who, born of the Amal stock, has a kingly\r\ndignity in all his actions, being patient in adversity, moderate in\r\nprosperity, and, most difficult of all kinds of government, long used\r\nto the government of himself. Moreover, he possesses that desirable\r\nquality, literary erudition, lending a grace to a nature originally\r\npraiseworthy. It is in books that the sage counsellor finds deeper\r\nwisdom, in books that the warrior learns how he may be strengthened by\r\nthe courage of the soul, in books that the Sovereign discovers how he\r\nmay weld nations together under his equal rule. In short, there is no\r\ncondition in life the credit whereof is not augmented by the glorious\r\nknowledge of literature.\r\n\r\n'Your new Sovereign is moreover learned in ecclesiastical lore, by\r\nwhich we are ever reminded of the things which make for our own true\r\nhonour, right judgment, wise discretion, reverence for God, thought\r\nof the future judgment. For the remembrance that we shall one day\r\nstand at the bar to answer for ourselves compels us to follow the\r\nfootprints of Justice. Thus does religious reading not only sharpen\r\nthe intellect but ever tend to make men scrupulous in the performance\r\nof their duties.\r\n\r\n'Let me pass on to that most generous frugality of his private\r\nhousehold[634] which procured the means of such abundance in his\r\ngifts, of such plenty at his banquets, that even the kingdom will not\r\ncall for any new expenditure in this respect greater than the old.\r\nGenerous in his hospitality, most pitiful in his compassions, while he\r\nwas thus spending much, his fortune, by a heavenly reward, was ever on\r\nthe increase.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: 'Veniamus ad illam privatae Ecclesiae (?) largissimam\r\nfrugalitatem.' 'Ecclesiae,' if it means here 'the Church,' seems to\r\nspoil the sense. Can Cassiodorus mean to compare the household of\r\nTheodahad to a 'private Ecclesia?']\r\n\r\n'The wish of the people should coincide with our choice of such a man,\r\nwho, reasonably spending his own goods, does not desire the goods of\r\nothers[635]. For moderation in his own expenditure takes away from the\r\nSovereign the temptation to transgress the precepts of justice and to\r\nabandon the golden mean.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: 'Talem universitas debuit optare, qualem nos probamur\r\nelegisse, qui rationabiliter disponens propria, non appetat aliena.'\r\nAnd this of Theodahad!]\r\n\r\n'Rejoice then, Conscript Fathers, and give thanks to the Most High,\r\nthat I have chosen such a ruler, who will supplement my justice by the\r\ngood deeds which spring from his own piety. For this man is both\r\nadmonished by the virtue of his ancestors and powerfully stimulated by\r\nthe example of his uncle Theodoric.'\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KING THEODAHAD TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We announce to you, Conscript Fathers, the Divine favour which has\r\nbeen manifested unto us, in that our sovereign Lady[636], who is\r\nrenowned throughout the whole world, has with generous affection made\r\nme partaker of her throne, so that she may not lack loyal support and\r\nI may be fittingly clothed with the purple of my ancestors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 636: 'Dominam rerum.']\r\n\r\n'I know that this elevation of mine was the object of the wishes of\r\nthe community. Your whispers in my favour might have been a source of\r\ndanger, but now your openly expressed acclamations are my proudest\r\nboast. You wished that God should bestow upon me this honour, to which\r\nI for my part should not have ventured to aspire. But if I have, as I\r\ntrust I have, any influence with you, let me prevail upon you to join\r\nwith me in perpetually hymning the glorious praises of our Lady and\r\nSister. She has wished to strengthen the greatness of our Empire by\r\nassociating me therein, even as the two eyes of a man harmoniously\r\nco-operate towards a single act of vision. Divine grace joins us\r\ntogether: our near relationship cements our friendship. Persons of\r\ndiverse character may find it an arduous matter thus to work in\r\ncommon; but, to those who resemble one another in the goodness of\r\ntheir intentions, the difficulty would rather be _not_ to work in\r\nharmony. The man devoid of forethought may fear the changing of his\r\npurposes; but he who is really great in wisdom eagerly seeks wisdom in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n'But of all the gifts which with this regal dignity the Divine favour\r\nhas bestowed upon me, none pleases me more than the fact that I should\r\nhave been thus chosen by that wisest Lady who is herself a moral\r\nbalance of the utmost delicacy, and who made me first feel her justice\r\nbefore advancing me to this high dignity. For, as you know, she\r\nordained that I should plead my cause against private persons in the\r\ncommon judgment-hall[637]. Oh wonderful nobility of her mind! Oh\r\nadmirable justice, which the world may well tell of! She hesitated\r\nnot first to subject her own relation to the course of public justice,\r\neven him whom, a little after, she would raise above the laws\r\nthemselves. She thoroughly searched the conscience of him to whom she\r\nwas about to hand over the dignity of kingship, that she might be\r\nrecognised as sovereign Lady of all, and that I, when tested, might be\r\nadvanced by her to the throne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 637: 'Cujus prius ideo justitiam pertuli ut prius\r\n[posterius?] ad ejus provectionis gratiam pervenirem. Causas enim, ut\r\nscitis, jure communi nos fecit dicere cum privatis.' We have here, no\r\ndoubt, an allusion to the punishment which, as we learn from\r\nProcopius, Amalasuentha inflicted on her cousin for his various acts\r\nof injustice towards his Tuscan neighbours.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\n'When shall I be able to repay her for all these favours: her who,\r\nhaving reigned alone during the minority of her son, now chooses me as\r\nthe partner of her realm? In her is the glory of all kingdoms, the\r\nflower of all our family. All our splendour is derived from her, and\r\nshe reflects a lustre not only on our ancestors, but on the whole\r\nhuman race. Her dutiful affection, her weight of character, who can\r\nset forth? The philosophers would learn new lessons if they knew her,\r\nand would acknowledge that their books fail to describe all her\r\nattributes. Acute she is in her powers of reasoning; but with royal\r\ntaciturnity she knows how to veil her conclusions in secrecy. She is\r\nmistress of many languages; and her intellect, if suddenly tested, is\r\nfound so ready for the trial that it scarcely seems like that of a\r\nmortal. In the Books of Kings the Queen of the South is said to have\r\ncome to learn the wisdom of Solomon: but here a woman speaks, and\r\nSovereigns listen to her with admiration. Infinite depths of meaning\r\nare fathomed by her in few words, and she, with utmost ease, expresses\r\nwhat others can only after long deliberation embody in language[638].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 638: 'Et summâ felicitate componitur quod ab aliis sub longâ\r\ndeliberatione componitur.' 'Ab aliis' probably refers to Cassiodorus\r\nhimself. The contrast between his elaborate and diffuse rhetoric, and\r\nthe few, terse, soon-moulded sentences of his mistress is very fairly\r\ndrawn.]\r\n\r\n'Happy the commonwealth which boasts the guidance of such a mistress.\r\nIt was not enough that already liberty and convenience were combined\r\nfor the multitude[639]: her merits have secured the fitting reverence\r\nfor the person of the Sovereign. In obeying _her_ we obey all the\r\nvirtues. I, too, with such a counsellor, fear not the weight of the\r\ncrown; and I know that whatever is strange to me in my new duties I\r\nshall learn from her as the safest of teachers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 639: 'Minus fuit ut generalitas sub libertate serviret.']\r\n\r\n'Acknowledge, noble Sirs, that all my power of increased usefulness to\r\nthe State comes from this our most wise Lady, from whom I may either\r\ngain wisdom by asking questions, or virtue by following her example.\r\n\r\n'Live happily: live in harmony by God's help, and emulate that grace\r\nof concord which you see prevailing between your Sovereigns.'\r\n\r\n\r\n5. KING THEODAHAD TO HIS MAN THEODOSIUS[640].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 640: 'Theodosio homini suo Theodahadus rex.' Does 'homo\r\nsuus' mean a member of his Comitatus? We seem to have here an\r\nanticipation of the 'homagium' of later times.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The followers of the new King must live justly.]\r\n\r\n'By my accession to the throne I have become lord of the whole nation\r\nand guardian of the general welfare. I therefore command that all who\r\nbelong to my private household shall vindicate their rights only in\r\nthe courts of law, and shall abstain from all high-handed modes of\r\nobtaining redress. Only that man must henceforward be called mine who\r\ncan live quietly subject to the laws. My new dignity has changed my\r\npurpose; and if before I have defended my rights with pertinacity, I\r\nshall now temper all my acts with clemency[641]; since there is\r\nnothing exceptional about a Sovereign's household, but wheresoever,\r\nby the grace of God, our rule extends, there, as we fully confess, is\r\nsomething which it is our duty to defend. Augment therefore my renown\r\nby your patience, and let me hear praises rather than complaints of\r\nthe actions of my servants.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 641: 'Mutavimus cum dignitate propositum, et si ante justa\r\ndistricte defendimus, nunc clementer omnia mitigamus.' A pretty plain\r\nconfession of Theodahad's past wrong-doing, and one which was probably\r\ninsisted upon by Amalasuentha in admitting him to a share in the\r\nkingship.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. KING THEODAHAD TO PATRICIUS, VIR ILLUSTRIS AND QUAESTOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patricius appointed Quaestor.]\r\n\r\n'In conferring upon you the office of Quaestor we look first to\r\ncharacter, and we find in you that love of justice which is all\r\nimportant in a representative of the Prince. Then we look at the\r\nqualities of your intellect, and we find in you that flow of eloquence\r\nwhich among all mental accomplishments we value most highly. What does\r\nit profit to be a philosopher, if one cannot worthily set forth the\r\nresults of one's investigations? To discover is natural to man; but to\r\nset forth one's discoveries in noble language, that is indeed a\r\ndesirable gift. Therefore we bestow on you for this thirteenth\r\nIndiction[642] the fasces of the Quaestorship, desiring you to\r\nconsecrate your time to the study of the laws and the _responsa\r\nprudentum_, and to spread abroad our fame by the eloquent manner in\r\nwhich you shall communicate our decrees to the Cities and Provinces\r\nunder our sway, and speak in our name to the representatives of\r\nforeign nations.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 642: 534-535. As Athalaric died Oct. 2, 534, the appointment\r\nof Patricius cannot have taken place on the usual day, Sept. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. KING THEODAHAD TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'After announcing to you our own accession, one of our first cares was\r\nto choose a Judge whose style of speaking might dignify the State.\r\nSuch a Judge have we found in Patricius (Patrician by his name\r\nalready), whom we hereby appoint to the office of Quaestor. He\r\nstudied eloquence at Rome. Where could he have studied better? For\r\nwhile other parts of the world have their wine, their balm, their\r\nfrankincense, which they can export, the peculiar product of Rome is\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\n'Having thus learned his art, he practised it at the bar with singular\r\nmoderation. No heat of strife hurried him into abuse of his\r\ncompetitors. Seeking only to win his client's cause, he calmly and\r\ncourteously set forth that client's rights without sacrificing his own\r\ndignity of demeanour.\r\n\r\n'Thinking that this man has pleaded long enough, we now appoint that\r\nhe shall sit as Judge, having made diligent enquiry as to his\r\ncharacter. In this, and in all other matters, we wish to follow the\r\nexample of the Emperors who have gone before us, in so far as they\r\nfollowed the paths of justice[643].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 643: 'Velle nostrum antiquorum principum est voluntas, quos\r\nin tantum desideramus imitari quantum illi justitiam sunt secuti.']\r\n\r\n\r\n8. QUEEN AMALASUENTHA TO JUSTINIAN, AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Present of marbles from Justinian to Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\n'Delighting to receive from your Piety some of those treasures of\r\nwhich the heavenly bounty has made you partaker, we send the bearer of\r\nthe present letter to receive those marbles and other necessaries\r\nwhich we formerly ordered Calogenitus to collect on our behalf. All\r\nour adornments, furnished by you, redound to your glory. For it is\r\nfitting that by your assistance should shine resplendent that Roman\r\nworld which the love of your Serenity renders illustrious.'\r\n\r\n\r\n9. KING THEODAHAD TO JUSTINIAN, AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n[On the same subject as the previous letter, and in nearly the same\r\nwords. Calogenitus apparently is dead.]\r\n\r\n'We have directed the bearer of this letter to exhibit (?) those\r\nthings for which Calogenitus was previously destined; so that,\r\nalthough that person is withdrawn from this life, your benefits, by\r\nGod's help, may still be brought unto us.'\r\n\r\n\r\n10. QUEEN AMALASUENTHA TO THEODORA, AUGUSTA[644].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 644: There is something in the tone of this letter which\r\nsuggests that Theodora was known to be pregnant when it was written.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Salutation to Theodora.]\r\n\r\n'We approach you with the language of veneration, because it is agreed\r\non all hands that your virtues increase more and more. Friendship\r\nexists not for those only who are in one another's presence, but also\r\nfor the absent. Rendering you therefore the salutation of august\r\nreverence, I hope that our ambassadors, whom we have directed to the\r\nmost clement and most glorious Emperor, will bring me news of your\r\nwelfare. Your prosperity is as dear to me as my own; and as I\r\nconstantly pray for your safety, I cannot hear without pleasure that\r\nmy prayers have been answered.'\r\n\r\n\r\n11. KING THEODAHAD TO MAXIMUS[645], VIR ILLUSTRIS AND DOMESTICUS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 645: This Maximus does not appear to be mentioned by\r\nProcopius. He may be the same Maximus who took refuge in one of the\r\nchurches after Totila's capture of Rome in 546 (De Bello Gotthico iii.\r\n20), and who was slain by order of Teias in 552 (Ibid. iv. 34); but\r\nthat person was grandson of an Emperor, and it seems hardly probable\r\nthat Cassiodorus would have spared us such a detail in the pedigree of\r\nTheodahad's kinsman. We seem also to be entirely without information\r\nas to the Amal princess who was the bride of Maximus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maximus appointed to office of Primicerius (Domesticorum?)]\r\n\r\n'It is the glory of a good Sovereign to confer office on the deserving\r\ndescendants of illustrious families. Such are the Anicii, an ancient\r\nfamily, almost on an equality with princes[646], from whom you are\r\ndescended. Gladly would we decorate the descendants of the Marii and\r\nCorvini if time had permitted their progeny to survive to our own day.\r\nBut it were inconsistent to regret the impossibility of enjoying this\r\nprivilege if we neglected the opportunity which we do possess in your\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 646: 'Anicios quidem pene principibus pares aetas prisca\r\ngenuit.']\r\n\r\n'Therefore we bestow upon you from this fourteenth Indiction[647] the\r\noffice of Primicerius, which is also called Domesticatus. This office\r\nmay appear somewhat less than you are entitled to by your pedigree,\r\nbut you have received an honour which is greater than all the _fasces_\r\nin being permitted to marry a wife of our royal race, a distinction\r\nwhich you could not have hoped for even when you sat in the curule\r\nchair. Comport yourself now with mildness, patience, and moderation,\r\nthat you may show yourself worthy of your affinity with us. Your\r\nancestors have hitherto been praised, but they were never dignified\r\nwith such an alliance. Your nobility has now reached a point beyond\r\nwhich it can climb no further. All that you do henceforward of a\r\npraiseworthy kind will but have the effect of rendering you more\r\nworthy of the matrimonial alliance which you have already\r\nachieved[648].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 647: 535 to 536.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 648: 'Laudati sunt hactenus parentes tui, sed tantâ non sunt\r\nconjunctione decorati. Nobilitas tua non est ultra quod crescat.\r\nQuicquid praeconialiter egeris, proprio matrimonio dignissimus\r\naestimaris.']\r\n\r\n\r\n12. KING THEODAHAD TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We do not think that the fact of a man's having received the\r\nConsulship early in life should shut him out from holding office of\r\nlower rank in his maturer years[649]. As the Tiber receives the water\r\nof smaller rivers which merge their names in his, so a man of Consular\r\nrank can serve the State in less conspicuous ways, yet still be\r\nConsular. Therefore we have thought fit to bestow on the Illustrious\r\nand Magnificent Patrician Maximus, the Primiceriatus which is also\r\ncalled Domesticatus, from this fourteenth Indiction, that the\r\nlowliness of the honour may be raised by the merit of the wearer. He\r\nis an Anicius, sprung from a family renowned throughout the whole\r\nworld. He is also honoured with the affinity of our own illustrious\r\nrace. Receive him, welcome him, rejoice at these nuptials, which bind\r\nme closer to you, now that you have in your ranks one whom I can truly\r\ncall a relation.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 649: Flavius Anicius Maximus was Consul in 523.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. KING THEODAHAD TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[This letter may probably be referred to the Spring or Summer of 535.\r\nTheodahad, soon after the deposition or death of Amalasuentha, has\r\napparently invited the Senate to Ravenna, an invitation which they\r\nhave respectfully declined. He chides their suspicions of him.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summons to Ravenna. Suspicions of the Senators.]\r\n\r\n'After we had dismissed the venerable Bishops who brought your\r\nmessage, without taking exception to your requests, though there were\r\nsome things blameworthy among them, we received tidings that the City\r\nof Rome was agitated by certain foolish anxieties, from which real\r\nevil would grow unless the suspicion which caused them could be laid\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\n'I fear that I cannot complain of \"popular levity\" if your illustrious\r\nbody, which should set an example to all others, should give way to\r\nsuch fond imaginings. If Rome, which should govern the Provinces, be\r\nso foolish, what can we expect of _them_?\r\n\r\n'Divine grace, however, prompts us both to pardon your faults and to\r\ngrant your requests. We owe you nothing, and yet we pay you[650]; but\r\nwe trust to be rewarded by hearing not our own praises but yours. Put\r\naway these unworthy, these childish suspicions, and behave as becomes\r\nthe fathers of the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 650: 'Nihil debemus et solvimus.' Have we here an echo of\r\nSt. Augustine's thought, 'Reddis debita nulli debens?']\r\n\r\n'In desiring your presence at our Court, we sought not your vexation\r\nbut your advantage. It is certainly a great privilege to see the face\r\nof the Sovereign, and we thought to bestow on you, for the advantage\r\nof the State, that which used to be counted as a reward. However, not\r\nto deal harshly with you, we shall be satisfied with the attendance of\r\ncertain individuals from your body, as occasion may require, so that\r\non the one hand Rome may not be denuded of her citizens, and on the\r\nother that we may not lack prudent counsellors in our chamber. Now\r\nreturn to your old devotion, and serve us, not as a matter of fear,\r\nbut of love. The rest shall the bearer of this letter explain unto\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n\r\n14. KING THEODAHAD TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n[The occasion of writing this letter, which we may perhaps refer to\r\nthe early part of 535, is apparently that some Gothic troops have been\r\nsent to Rome, and the people have broken out into clamours against\r\nthem, or petitioned for their removal.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissensions between citizens of Rome and Gothic troops.]\r\n\r\n'Your predecessors have always been distinguished by the loyal love\r\nwhich they bore to the Chief of the State; and it is only right that\r\nhe [the Sovereign] who is defended with so much toil, he, for whom, as\r\nthe representative of public order, daily precautions are taken[651],\r\nshould in return love that people above all others whose loyalty gives\r\nhim a right to rule the world[652].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 651: 'Qui maximo labore defenditur, cujus per dies singulos\r\ncivilitas custoditur.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 652: 'Ut illos diligat super omnia, per quos habere probatur\r\nuniversa.']\r\n\r\n'Oh! let there be nothing in you in our days which may justly move our\r\nindignation. Still show forth your older loyalty. It is not fitting\r\nthat the Roman people should be fickle, or crafty, or full of\r\nseditions.\r\n\r\n'Let no fond suspicions, no shadow of fear sway you. You have a\r\nSovereign who only longs to find opportunities to love you. Meet with\r\nhostile arms your enemies, not your own defenders.\r\n\r\n'You ought to have invited, not to have shut out the succour which we\r\nsent you. Evidently you have been misled by counsellors who care not\r\nfor the public weal. Return to your own better minds.\r\n\r\n'Was it some new and strange nation whose faces forsooth thus\r\nterrified you? No: the very men whom hitherto you have called your\r\nkinsmen, the men who in their anxiety for your safety have left their\r\nhomes and families in order to defend you. Strange return on your part\r\nfor their devotion!\r\n\r\n'As for you, you should know this, that night and day our one\r\nceaseless desire is to perfect, with God's help, the security which\r\nwas fostered in the times of our relations [Theodoric and\r\nAmalasuentha]. Where, indeed, would our credit as a Sovereign be if\r\nanything happened to your hurt? Dismiss all such thoughts from your\r\nminds. If any have been unjustly cast down, we will raise him up\r\nagain. We have sent you some verbal messages by the bearer of this\r\nletter, and hope that from henceforth we may rely on your constant\r\nobedience.'\r\n\r\n\r\n15. KING THEODAHAD TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter of introduction for an ecclesiastic.]\r\n\r\n'It is always a delight to us to have an opportunity of directing our\r\nletters of salutation[653] to your Piety, since he is filled with\r\nhappy joy who converses with you with sincere heart. I therefore\r\nrecommend to your Clemency the bearer of this letter, who comes on the\r\naffairs of the Church of Ravenna. There can be no doubt that if you\r\ngrant his request you will earn a just reward.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: 'Salutiferos apices.']\r\n\r\n\r\n16. KING THEODAHAD TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assurances of good-will. Oath of concord.]\r\n\r\n'It is worthy of a ruler to do good of his own freewill, not under\r\ncompulsion. By God's favour we _can_ do anything, but we choose to do\r\nonly things that are praiseworthy. Recognise now, oh prudent\r\ncounsellors, that clemency of mine which ye might always have reckoned\r\nupon. Ye feared that I was your enemy; far from that, I cannot even\r\nbear that ye should be racked by the fear of evil[654]. And therefore,\r\nthough I change no purpose of mine, since I never had thoughts of evil\r\ntowards you, I have ordained that A and B, the bearers of this letter,\r\nshould take unto you the oaths which you solicited[655]. I do this\r\nthing for God's sake, not for man's; for how could I, who have run\r\nthrough the story of ancient realms in Holy Writ, wish to do anything\r\nelse but that which is well-pleasing to God, who will assuredly\r\nrecompense me according to my works. Henceforward, then, serve me\r\nloyally, and in the full security which you have thus acquired: yea,\r\nyour love will be now the repayment of a debt rather than a freewill\r\noffering.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: 'Ecce nec sollicitos patimur, quibus infensi esse\r\nputabamur.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: 'Postulata siquidem sacramenta vobis, ab Illo atque\r\nIllo praestari nostra decrevit auctoritas.']\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KING THEODAHAD TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'Since your security is our highest ornament, and since our love\r\nwishes to remove every shade of anxiety from your minds, we have\r\nordered A and B to take oaths to you in our name, whereby you may know\r\nthe mind of your King towards you. Though this act might seem not to\r\nconsort with our dignity, we willingly perform it for your sakes, and\r\nadd the sanction of an oath, though we have learned from the Sacred\r\nScriptures that a mere promise ought to be kept. Now it is for you to\r\nshow your devotion, and with assiduous prayers to implore of the\r\nMajesty on high that the tranquil times which we long that you may\r\nenjoy may be granted by the gift of Heaven.'\r\n\r\n\r\n18. KING THEODAHAD TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Gothic garrison for Rome.]\r\n\r\n'Anxious that what we are devising for your safety should not be\r\nmisinterpreted by bitter suspicion, we do you to wit that the army\r\nwhich is marching to Rome is intended for your defence, in order that\r\nthey who covet your possessions may by Divine help be resisted by the\r\narms of the Goths. If the shepherd is bound to watch over his flock,\r\nthe father of the family to see that no crafty deceiver enters\r\ntherein, with what anxious care ought not we to defend the City of\r\nRome, which by universal consent is unequalled in the world[656]. So\r\nprecious a possession must not be staked upon any throw. But that the\r\ndefence of the City may be in no wise burdensome to you, we have\r\nordered that the soldiers shall pay at the ordinary market rate for\r\nthe provisions which they require; and we have desired Vacco, the\r\nsteward of our house, to superintend these purchases. He is a man of\r\nvalour and integrity, whose character will secure him the obedience of\r\nthe troops, and enable him to prevent any excesses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: 'Quâ nos convenit cautelâ Romam defendere, quam constat\r\nin mundo simile nihil habere?']\r\n\r\n'As for the soldiers, we have told them to take up their quarters in\r\nfitting places [outside the City?], that without there may be armed\r\ndefence, within for you, tranquil order[657].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: 'Quos tamen locis aptis praecipimus immorari, ut foris\r\nsit armata defensio, intus vobis tranquilla civilitas.']\r\n\r\n'God forbid that in our days that City should seem to be protected by\r\nwalls, the very name of which hath been of old a terror to the\r\nnations[658]. We hope for this from the aid of Heaven, that she who\r\nhath always been free may never be stained by the insult of any\r\nblockade[659].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: 'Absit enim ut nostris temporibus Urbs illa muris\r\nvideatur protegi, quam constat gentibus vel sola opinione fuisse\r\nterrori.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 659: 'Ut quae semper fuit libera, nullius inclusionis\r\ndecoloretur injuria.']\r\n\r\n\r\n19. KING THEODAHAD TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embassy of Peter.]\r\n\r\n'We thank the Divine Being, who loves to see Kings at peace with one\r\nanother, that you expressed such joy at our elevation to the throne.\r\nContinue to set to the world this example of benignity; continue to\r\nshow your interest in one who recommends himself by his pure affection\r\nfor you. For you do not seek to pick shabby quarrels with other\r\nSovereigns; you do not delight in unjust contests, which are contrary\r\nto sound morality[660], since you seek for nothing but what may\r\nincrease the good opinion which men have of you. How could you throw\r\naway that peace which it is the glory of your Piety to have imposed\r\neven on angry nations[661]?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 660: 'Non enim rixas viles per regna requiritis: non vos\r\ninjusta certamina quae sunt bonis moribus inimica, delectant.' No\r\ndoubt this was meant to be taken as a hint of the censure which it\r\nprofesses to deny.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 661: 'Pacem quam et iracundis gentibus consuevistis\r\nimponere.' An allusion, perhaps, to the peace concluded with Persia.]\r\n\r\n'Even you, glorious Sovereigns! [Justinian and Theodora] gain somewhat\r\nwhen all other realms revere you. It is a common thing for the ruler\r\nto be praised in his own land, but to receive the unforced praise of\r\nforeign lands, that is indeed desirable. You are loved, most pious\r\nEmperor, in your own dominions; but how much grander a thing to be yet\r\nmore loved in the regions of Italy, from whence the glory of the Roman\r\nname was diffused over the whole world! It behoves you therefore to\r\ncontinue that peaceful disposition which you showed towards us at the\r\ncommencement of our reign.\r\n\r\n'We have desired the most blessed Pope and the most honourable Senate\r\nof the City of Rome to give their answers to the eloquent and worthy\r\nPeter, your ambassador, with as little delay as possible; and we have\r\njoined with him that venerable person our ambassador[662], that you\r\nmay know our mind from our own messenger.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 662: The name of 'virum illum venerabilem' is not given, but\r\nwe learn from Procopius (De Bello Gotthico i. 6) that it was Rusticus,\r\na priest, a Roman, and an intimate friend of Theodahad.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. QUEEN GUDELINA[663] TO THEODORA AUGUSTA.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: Wife of Theodahad.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embassy of Rusticus.]\r\n\r\n'I have received with thanks the earnestly-desired letters of your\r\nPiety, and reverently prize the report of your spoken words as better\r\nthan all gifts. You exhort us first of all to impart to your hearing\r\nwhatever requests we wish to make to your triumphant lord and\r\nconsort[664]. Backed by such patronage as yours, how can there be any\r\ndoubt as to the success of our petitions? It is an addition to our joy\r\nthat your Serenity has chosen such a man for your ambassador, one whom\r\nit is equally fitting for your glory to send and for our obedience to\r\nreceive[665]. There can be no doubt that it is by constant observation\r\nof your character that his own has become so excellent, since it is by\r\ngood maxims that the mind of man is cleansed from impurity[666].\r\nAccording to the warning of your Reverence we have given orders that\r\nboth Pope and Senate shall give their answers to your messengers\r\nquickly, so that there may be no delay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 664: 'Hortamini enim ut quidquid expetendum a triumphali\r\nprincipe domino jugali nostro (?) credimus vestris ante sensibus\r\ningeramus.' It seems to me that the sense requires _vestro_ instead of\r\n_nostro_, and I have translated accordingly. (Dahn also makes this\r\ncorrection.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: 'Et vestra decet obsequia retinere.' Here 'nostra'\r\nseems to give a better sense than 'vestra.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: 'Dubium enim non est illam mores dare cui observatur\r\nassidue, dum constat defaecari animum bonis praeceptionibus\r\ninstitutum.' Rather hazardous praise to address to a Theodora.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Possible reference to death of Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\n'For moreover, concerning that person about whom something came to our\r\nears with tickling speech, know that that has been ordained which we\r\nbelieved would suit your intentions[667]; for it is our desire that by\r\nthe interposition of our good offices your will should be law as much\r\nin our kingdom as in your empire[668].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: 'Nam et de illâ personâ, de quâ ad nos aliquid verbo\r\ntitillante pervenit, hoc ordinatum esse cognoscite, quod vestris\r\ncredidimus animis convenire.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 668: These mysterious sentences, according to Gibbon, cap.\r\nxli. _n._ 56 (following Buat), refer to Amalasuentha, and thus lend\r\nprobability to the story in the Anecdote of Procopius that Theodora,\r\nout of jealousy, intrigued with Theodahad to have Amalasuentha put to\r\ndeath. But whatever may be the truth of that story, this sentence can\r\nhardly by any possibility refer to it. For (1) it is clear that this\r\nletter was written at the same time as Theodahad's, which precedes it,\r\ntherefore after the arrival of Peter in Italy. But Procopius is clear\r\nthat Amalasuentha was put to death before Peter had crossed the\r\nHadriatic, whereas this event, whatever it be, is evidently a piece of\r\nnews which Gudelina has to communicate to Theodora. (2) This letter,\r\nthough purporting to be from Gudelina, is confessedly written by\r\nCassiodorus, and published by him at the end of his official career.\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that he would deliberately publish to the\r\nworld his connection with the murder of Theodoric's daughter and his\r\nown friend and benefactress. It is remarkable, on the contrary, how\r\ncomplete (but for this passage) is the silence of the Variae as to\r\nAmalasuentha's deposition and death: as if Cassiodorus had said, 'If\r\nyou do anything to harm _her_, you may get other apologists for your\r\ndeeds; I will be no champion of such wickedness.' It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to remark that there is nothing in the wording of the\r\nsentence 'de illa persona,' &c. which makes it more applicable to a\r\nwoman than to a man. As Peter's embassy was ostensibly connected with\r\necclesiastical affairs, there is perhaps an allusion in this sentence\r\nto some scheme of Theodora's with reference to the Papacy. It is\r\npossible that she may have been already working for the election of\r\nVigilius to the chair of St. Peter, and therefore that _he_ is meant\r\nby 'illa persona.']\r\n\r\n'We therefore inform you that we had caused our messenger [Rusticus\r\nthe priest] to be despatched by the Pope before your ambassador could\r\npossibly have left Rome. So saluting you with all the veneration which\r\nis your due, we assign the office of ambassador to a man eminent both\r\nby his character and learning, and venerable by reason of his office;\r\nsince we believe that those persons are acceptable to you whom we have\r\nthought suitable to be entrusted with the Divine ministry.'\r\n\r\n\r\n21. QUEEN GUDELINA TO THEODORA, AUGUSTA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soliciting Theodora's friendship.]\r\n\r\n'Oh, wisest of Augustas, both I and my wedded lord earnestly desire\r\nyour friendship. The love of so great a lady seems to raise me higher\r\nthan royalty. Shed on us the lustre of your glory, for one light loses\r\nnothing by imparting some of its brilliancy to another. With\r\naffectionate presumption I commend myself to the favour of the Emperor\r\nand yourself, desiring that, as is fitting, there should be no discord\r\nbetween the two Roman realms[669].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 669: 'Nullam inter Romana regna decet esse discordiam.']\r\n\r\n\r\n22. KING THEODAHAD TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN[670].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 670: This letter seems as if it was written on precisely the\r\nsame occasion as x. 19. Again Peter is sent back, and with him a\r\n'venerable man' to represent Theodahad. We learn from Procopius (i. 6)\r\nthat Theodahad, in his fear of war, recalled Peter when he had already\r\ngot as far as Albano, and gave him another set of propositions for\r\nJustinian. It seems possible that these fresh letters (22 and 23) from\r\nTheodahad and his Queen were given him when he set out the _second_\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Entreaties for peace.]\r\n\r\n'Our own ambassadors, and that most excellent person Peter, whom your\r\nPiety despatched to us, will both have informed you how earnestly we\r\ndesire concord with your august Serenity. We now send two more\r\nambassadors charged with the same commission. We certainly with all\r\nsincerity plead for peace who have no cause of quarrel with you.\r\nConsider also, oh learned Sovereigns, and consult the archives of your\r\ngreat grandfather[671], that you may see how large a part of their own\r\nrights your predecessors were willing to relinquish for the sake of an\r\nalliance with our ancestors[672]. Think how fortunate you are in\r\nhaving that friendship willingly offered to you for which they had\r\nhumbly to sue. Yet, we may say it without arrogance, we know ourselves\r\nto be better than those ancestors of ours with whom the treaty was\r\nmade[673]. We send you on this embassy a venerable man, made\r\nillustrious by his priestly office, and conspicuous by the renown of\r\nhis learning. We pray the Divine goodness to bring our wishes to pass;\r\nand as not even a series of letters can contain all that we have to\r\nsay, we have given some verbal messages to be conveyed to your sacred\r\nears, that you may not be wearied by the reading of too diffuse a\r\nletter.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 671: Zeno (not of course an ancestor in natural\r\nrelationship, but predecessor in the third degree).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 672: 'Considerate etiam, principes docti, et abavi vestri\r\nhistorica monumenta recolite, quantum decessores vestri studuerint de\r\nsuo jure relinquere ut eis parentum nostrorum foedera provenirent.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 673: 'Nunc illi vestram gratiam ultro quaerunt, qui suis\r\nparentibus meliores se esse cognoscunt.' Dahn remarks that Theodahad's\r\nasserted superiority to Theodoric probably consisted in his\r\nphilosophical culture.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. QUEEN GUDELINA TO THEODORA, AUGUSTA[674].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 674: See note on the preceding letter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We learn with satisfaction from that most eloquent man Peter, that\r\nwhat has happened in this State is acceptable to you[675]. You show\r\nyour love of justice when, all suspicion by God's providence having\r\nbeen wiped away, you desire that there should be lasting agreement\r\nbetween us. Let there then be definite promises on both sides, and\r\nlasting concord as the result. We therefore send that venerable man to\r\nsecure the peace of our most serene husband with yours in the sight of\r\nall men. If there be anything in the Emperor's terms so hard that it\r\nought not to be imposed on us, we trust to your wise moderation to\r\nmitigate the same, that the love which we have begun to feel towards\r\nyour kingdom be not chilled by harsh terms of peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 675: 'Ut per eum disceremus acceptum vobis esse quod in hac\r\nrepublicâ constat evenisse.' At first sight this seems to refer to the\r\ndeath of Amalasuentha or to the accession of Theodahad. Dahn thinks\r\nthat those events have been disposed of in previous letters. Perhaps\r\nit is a general expression for 'the whole course of recent events in\r\nItaly.' Though upon the whole rejecting the story of Theodora's\r\ncomplicity in the death of Amalasuentha, I am bound to admit that this\r\npassage lends a certain amount of probability to the charge. At the\r\nsame time, the words in the next sentence, 'per divinam providentiam\r\nomni suspicione detersâ,' are susceptible of an honourable meaning,\r\neven if the death of Amalasuentha be alluded to. 'You and your husband\r\naccused us of that crime. Now by God's providence we have been able to\r\nshow that we were guiltless of it [that it was done without our\r\nprivity by the relations of the three Gothic nobles whom she had put\r\nto death]. Nothing therefore remains to hinder peace between us.']\r\n\r\n'Claim this palm of concord between the two States as your own\r\nespecial crown, that as the Emperor is renowned for his successful\r\nwars, so you may receive the praises of all men for this accomplished\r\npeace. Let the bearer of these letters see you often and\r\nconfidentially. We hope for just, not onerous, conditions of peace,\r\nalthough in truth nothing seems impossible to us if we know that it is\r\nasked for by such a glorious person as yourself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n24. QUEEN GUDELINA TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN[676].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 676: Apparently sent at the same time as the two preceding\r\nletters.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\nA short letter of compliments to the Emperor, and earnest desire for\r\nthe preservation of peace. Peter and 'ille vir venerabilis' are still\r\nthe messengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. KING THEODAHAD TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'The august page written by your Serenity, and brought to us by the\r\nvenerable presbyter Heracleanus, has gleamed upon us, bringing us the\r\ngrace of your salutation. Oh, what a great benefit for us is this\r\nsweet converse with so mighty a prince!\r\n\r\n'May we ever hear of your safety, and of the increase of the happiness\r\nof your kingdom. We have no other wish but this. According to your\r\ndesire we have addressed letters to the Pope of the City of Rome[677],\r\ntelling him to reply to the letter brought by the present messenger\r\nwith the least possible delay, since anyone who comes from you should\r\nbe attended to with utmost celerity. We hope for many future\r\nopportunities of thus obeying your desires and earning your love in\r\nreturn.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 677: Negotiations were evidently still going on between the\r\nEmperor and the Pope, probably with reference to the election of\r\nAnthimus, who, though accused of Monophysitism, had been made\r\nPatriarch of Constantinople in 535 by Theodora's influence, and whom\r\nthe Pope apparently refused to recognise. He was afterwards deposed by\r\nPope Agapetus when he visited Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26. KING THEODAHAD TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A monastery too heavily taxed.]\r\n\r\n'Richer than all other gifts bestowed by your Serenity is this, when\r\nyou exhort us to do that which will profit for our own salvation and\r\nrecommend us to the Divine Power. We hear that it has been brought to\r\nthe knowledge of your Glory that a monastery of God's servants is too\r\nheavily oppressed with tribute, and we point out that this is owing to\r\nan inundation which has smitten their land with the curse of\r\nbarrenness. However, we have given orders to the most eminent\r\nSenator[678] to appoint a careful inspector to visit the farm in\r\nquestion, weigh the matter carefully, and make such reasonable\r\nreduction as may leave a sufficient profit to the owners of the soil.\r\nWe consider that anything which we thus concede to the desire of your\r\nMildness will be to us the most precious of all gains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678: Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alleged losses of a convert from Arianism.]\r\n\r\n'In the matter of Veranilda, too, about which your Serenity has\r\ndeigned to admonish me, though it happened long ago under the reign of\r\nmy relations, I thought it right to make good her loss by my own\r\ngenerosity, that she might not repent her change of religion[679]. For\r\nseeing that the Deity suffers many religions, we should not seek to\r\nimpose one on all our subjects. He who tries to do otherwise flies in\r\nthe face of the Divine commands. Your Piety, therefore, fittingly\r\ninvites me to these acts of obedience to God.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 679: Apparently Veranilda had in the reign of Theodoric\r\nbecome a convert from Arianism to Orthodoxy, and had suffered some\r\npecuniary losses in consequence, which Theodahad now proposes to make\r\nup to her. See Dahn, Könige der Germanen iii. 199, _n._ 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. KING THEODAHAD TO SENATOR[680], PRAEFECTUS PRAETORIO.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 680: Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corn distributions in Liguria and Venetia.]\r\n\r\n'In succouring his subjects, the payers of tribute, the King does not\r\nseem to give, so much as to restore what he has received. The\r\ncultivator of the soil is abandoned to future famine, unless he is\r\nhelped in the day of his necessity. Therefore let the corn which has\r\nbeen received by the government from industrious Liguria and loyal\r\nVenetia, though it has been taken from their fields, be born again to\r\nthem in our granaries, since it is too outrageous that the cultivator\r\nshould starve while our barns are full. Therefore let your Illustrious\r\nGreatness (whose office is said to have been instituted for the\r\nexpress purpose of feeding the people from the accumulated stores of\r\nthe State[681]) sell to the impoverished Ligurians the third part of\r\nthe grain warehoused at Ticinum and Dertona, at the rate of 25 modii\r\nto the solidus[682]. Similarly distribute the third part of the stores\r\nin the warehouses of Tarvisium and Tridentum to the Venetians, at the\r\nsame rate, that pitying Heaven, seeing men's bounty to one another,\r\nmay give us fruitful harvests. Take care that this distribution is so\r\nmanaged that our indulgence shall reach those persons chiefly, who are\r\nleast able to depend on their own resources.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 681: 'Quorum dignitas ad hoc legitur instituta, ut de\r\nrepositis copiis populum saturare possetis.' Probably an allusion to\r\nJoseph, whom Cassiodorus celebrates as the first Praefectus\r\nPraetorio.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: Six bushels for twelve shillings, or sixteen shillings\r\na quarter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. KING THEODAHAD TO SENATOR[683], PRAEFECTUS PRAETORIO.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grant of monopolies.]\r\n\r\n'The King ought to confirm whatever has been wisely ordered by the\r\nJudges, especially those who are known to be above suspicion of\r\nbribery.\r\n\r\n'Therefore we confirm in their offices[684] the stewards[685],\r\npurveyors[686] of wheat, wine, and cheese, the meat sellers, vintners,\r\nfarmers of the revenue derived from granaries and taverns[687], hay\r\nmerchants, and general provision dealers[688], who belong to the City\r\nof Rome or the royal residence of Ravenna[689]; also those who hold\r\npublic charges of this description along the river banks of Ticinum or\r\nPlacentia[690], or in any other places, whom we know to have been\r\nappointed by you, whose judgments we willingly embrace and desire to\r\nhold fast exactly as if they were our own; nor will we allow the\r\nmalice of any to prevail against those persons who by your choice have\r\nassumed these public functions. If therefore they acquit themselves to\r\nyour satisfaction, they shall hold their office for five years without\r\nfear of disturbance during that period. On account of the present\r\nbarrenness of the land you should cause them to fix such prices for\r\nthe different kinds of grain as shall seem reasonable to your\r\nEminence[691].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 684: The sentence is so long that Cassiodorus seems to have\r\nforgotten its construction, and these important words are in fact\r\nomitted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 685: 'Arcarios.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 686: 'Prorogatores.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 687: 'Capitularios horreariorum et tabernariorum.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 688: 'Cellaritas.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 689: 'Mansionem Ravennatem.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 690: 'Ripam Ticinensem vel Placentinam.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 691: Here follows, 'Ut hi quibus commissum est exercere\r\nsingulos apparatus de injusto gravamine non querantur,' which I do not\r\nventure to translate, as I am not sure whether it relates to buyers or\r\nsellers.]\r\n\r\n'As human ambition requires to be checked by fear of punishment,\r\nanyone who by petitioning or canvassing seeks to obtain the place of\r\none of these lawfully appointed purveyors shall be visited with a fine\r\nof 30 lbs. of gold[692], to be exacted from him by you. If unable to\r\npay this fine he shall suffer corporal punishment and be noted as\r\ninfamous. Nothing can be considered safe or stable if men are to be\r\nperpetually exposed to the snares of envious competitors like these.\r\nYour Greatness is to bring this law to the knowledge of all men.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 692: £1,200.]\r\n\r\n[It is clear that this letter refers to an office greatly coveted, and\r\none in which there was a possibility of making great gains, but also\r\none in which, owing to the regulation of prices by the government,\r\nthere might be temporary losses; to guard against which it was\r\nconsidered reasonable that the holder should be guaranteed in his\r\noffice for five years.\r\n\r\nThe office is the supply of the staple articles of food to the King's\r\nhousehold at Rome and Ravenna, and to the garrisons probably of Pavia\r\nand Piacenza and the neighbouring country. Did this right carry with\r\nit an absolute monopoly as far as the other inhabitants of those\r\nplaces are concerned? This seems probable; but I do not know that we\r\ncan positively state it.\r\n\r\nThe term used, 'Arcarii,' is applied in the Theodosian Code (xii. 6,\r\n14) to the bailiffs by whom the rents on the Imperial domain were\r\ncollected. Here it has manifestly altered its meaning.]\r\n\r\n\r\n29. KING THEODAHAD TO COUNT WINUSIAD.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An old soldier receives furlough for a visit to the baths\r\nof Bormio.]\r\n\r\n'Your noble birth and tried fidelity induced us to commit to you the\r\ngovernment of the City of Ticinum, which you had defended in war: but\r\nnow, being deluged with a sudden inundation of muddy gout[693], you\r\nask leave to resort to the waters of Bormio, which by their drying\r\ninfluences are of healing power for this malady.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: 'Limosae podagrae subitâ inundatione complutus.']\r\n\r\n'We permit, nay earnestly encourage, you to undertake this journey;\r\nfor we cannot bear that one of our warriors should fall a victim to\r\nthe tyranny of this cruel disease, which, like the Barbarians, when it\r\nhas once claimed by force hospitality in the owner's body, ever after\r\ndefends its right thereto by cruelty. It seeks out all the hollow\r\nplaces of the system, makes stones out of its moisture, and deposits\r\nthem there, destroying all the beautiful arrangements of Nature for\r\nfree and easy movement. It loosens what ought to be tight, it\r\ncontracts the nerves, and so shortens the limbs that a tall man finds\r\nall the comeliness of his stature taken from him while he is still\r\nunmutilated. It is in truth a living death; and when the excruciating\r\ntorment is gone, it leaves an almost worse legacy behind it--inability\r\nto move. Even debtors in the torture chamber have the weights\r\nsometimes removed from their feet; but this cruel malady, when it has\r\nonce taken hold of a man, seems never to relinquish possession. A\r\ndisease of this kind, bringing with it weakness and helplessness, is\r\nespecially terrible to a warrior, who after overcoming the foes that\r\ncame against him in battle, finds himself thus struck down by an enemy\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n'Go then, in Heaven's name, to the healing springs. We cannot bear the\r\nthought that you the warrior should be carried on men's shoulders,\r\ninstead of bestriding your war-horse. We have painted all these evils\r\nin somewhat exaggerated style in order to stir you up to seek an early\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n'Use then these waters, soothing to the taste, and in the hot bath\r\nable to dry up the gouty humours. God has given us this ally wherewith\r\nto overcome that enemy of the human race; and under its double\r\ninfluence, within and without, the malady, which ten years of regimen\r\nand endless medicines cannot lessen, is put to flight by remedies\r\nwhich are in themselves delightful.\r\n\r\n'May God grant that this far-famed place may restore your body to\r\nhealth[694].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 694: The nature-heated springs of Bormio are still resorted\r\nto; and some pedestrian travellers, who have crossed the Stelvio from\r\nTrafoi, have a grateful remembrance of their soothing waters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n30. KING THEODAHAD TO HONORIUS, PRAEFECT OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The elephants in the Via Sacra.]\r\n\r\n'We regret to learn from your report that the brazen elephants placed\r\nin the Via Sacra[695] (so called from the many superstitions to which\r\nit was consecrated of old) are falling into ruins.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 695: I have not found any other mention of these brazen\r\nelephants. Nardini (Roma Antica i. 295) cites this passage, and\r\nillustrates it by quotations from Suetonius, Pliny, and the Historia\r\nAugusta, showing that it was the custom to erect to Emperors and\r\nEmpresses statues of elephants drawing triumphal chariots.]\r\n\r\n'This is to be much regretted, that whereas these animals live in the\r\nflesh more than a thousand years, their brazen effigies should be so\r\nsoon crumbling away. See therefore that their gaping limbs be\r\nstrengthened by iron hooks, and that their drooping bellies be\r\nfortified by masonry placed underneath them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural history of the elephant.]\r\n\r\n'The living elephant, when it is prostrate on the ground, as it often\r\nis when helping men to fell trees, cannot get up again unaided. This\r\nis because it has no joints in its feet; and accordingly you see\r\nnumbers of them lying as if dead till men come to help them up again.\r\nThus this creature, so terrible by its size, is really not equally\r\nendowed by Nature with the tiny ant.\r\n\r\n'That the elephant surpasses all other animals in intelligence is\r\nproved by the adoration which it renders to Him whom it understands to\r\nbe the Almighty Ruler of all. Moreover it pays to good princes a\r\nhomage which it refuses to tyrants.\r\n\r\n'It uses its proboscis[696], that nosëd hand which Nature has given it\r\nto compensate for its very short neck, for the benefit of its master,\r\naccepting the presents which will be profitable to him. It always\r\nwalks cautiously, mindful of that fatal fall [into the hunter's pit]\r\nwhich was the beginning of its captivity. At its master's bidding it\r\nexhales its breath, which is said to be a remedy for the human\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 696: Cassiodorus calls it 'promuscis.']\r\n\r\n'When it comes to water it sucks up in its trunk a vast quantity,\r\nwhich at the word of command it squirts forth like a shower. If anyone\r\nhave treated it with contempt, it pours forth such a stream of dirty\r\nwater over him that one would think a river had entered his house. For\r\nthis beast has a wonderfully long memory, both of injury and of\r\nkindness. Its eyes are small, but move solemnly. There is a sort of\r\nkingly dignity in its appearance, and while it recognises with\r\npleasure all that is honourable, it seems to despise scurrilous jests.\r\nIts skin is furrowed by deep channels, like that of the victims of the\r\nforeign disease named after it[697], _elephantiasis_. It is on account\r\nof the impenetrability of this hide that the Persian Kings used the\r\nelephant in war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 697: 'A quâ transportaneorum (?) nefanda passio nomen\r\naccepit.']\r\n\r\n'It is most desirable that we should preserve the images of these\r\ncreatures, and that our citizens should thus be familiarised with the\r\nsight of the denizens of foreign lands. Do not therefore permit them\r\nto perish, since it is for the glory of Rome to collect all specimens\r\nof the process by which the art of workmen hath imitated the\r\nproductions of wealthy Nature in all parts of the world.'\r\n\r\n[This letter traverses the same ground as Pliny's 'Historia Naturalis'\r\nviii. 1-11, but supplies some new facts. Pliny makes the elephant live\r\nto the age of 200 or even 300 years. Cassiodorus boldly says 'more\r\nthan a thousand.' The curious story of the elephant's religion is\r\ngiven with more detail by Pliny; but he knows nothing of the political\r\nsagacity which enables it to discern between a good king and a tyrant.\r\nPliny mentions the fact that the elephant's breath is a cure for\r\nheadache, but adds, 'especially if he sneeze[698].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: Hist. Nat. xxviii. 8.]\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, though Cassiodorus had probably read Pliny's\r\ndescription, his own must be pronounced original.\r\n\r\nThis marvellous letter is the last that we have, written in the name\r\nof Theodahad.]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. KING WITIGIS[699] TO ALL THE GOTHS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 699: Spelt 'Vitigis' by Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elevation of Witigis.]\r\n\r\n'Though every advance in station is to be accounted among the good\r\ngifts of the Divinity, especially is the kingly dignity to be looked\r\nupon as coming by His ordinance through Whom kings reign and subjects\r\nobey. Wherefore, with liveliest satisfaction returning thanks to our\r\nMaker Christ, we inform you that our kinsmen[700] the Goths, amid a\r\nfence of circling swords, raising us in ancestral fashion upon a\r\nshield, have by Divine guidance bestowed on us the kingly dignity,\r\nthus making arms the emblem of honour to one who has earned all his\r\nrenown in war. For know that not in the corner of a presence-chamber,\r\nbut in wide-spreading plains I have been chosen King; and that not the\r\ndainty discourse of flatterers, but the blare of trumpets announced my\r\nelevation, that the Gothic people, roused by the sound to a kindling\r\nof their inborn valour, might once more gaze upon a Soldier King.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 700: 'Parentes nostros Gothos.']\r\n\r\n'Too long indeed have these brave men, bred up amid the shock of\r\nbattle, borne with a Sovereign who was untried in war; too long have\r\nthey laboured to uphold his dubious fame, though they might presume\r\nupon their own well-known valour[701]. For it is inevitable that the\r\ncharacter of the ruler should in some degree influence the reputation\r\nof the whole people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 701: 'Ut de ejus fama laboraret quamvis de propria virtute\r\npraesumeret.' I have translated as if 'laboraret' and 'praesumeret'\r\nwere in the plural, and even so, find it difficult to get a\r\nsatisfactory meaning out of these words.]\r\n\r\n'But, as ye have heard, called forth by the dangers of my kindred, I\r\nwas ready to undergo with them one common fate; but they would not\r\nsuffer me to continue a mere General, feeling that they needed a\r\nveteran King. Wherefore now accept first the Divine decree, and then\r\nthe judgment of the Goths, since it is your unanimous wish which makes\r\nme King. Lay aside then the fear of disaster: cast off the suspicion\r\nof further losses: fear no rude strokes of fate under our dominion. We\r\nwho have ridden so oft to war have learned to love valiant men.\r\nAssociated in all things with your labours, I have been myself a\r\nwitness to the brave deeds of each of you, and need no other evidence\r\nof your worth. By no fraudulent variations between my public and\r\nprivate negotiations shall the might of the Gothic arms be\r\nbroken[702]. Everything that we do shall have respect to the welfare\r\nof our whole people: in private we will not even love. We promise to\r\nfollow those courses which shall adorn the royal name. Finally, we\r\nundertake that our rule shall in all things be such as becomes a\r\nGothic King, the successor of the renowned Theodoric--that man who was\r\nso rarely and so nobly qualified by Nature for the cares of royalty;\r\nthat man of whom it may be truly said that every other Sovereign is\r\nillustrious in so far as he loves _his_ counsels. Therefore he who\r\nsucceeds in imitating the deeds of Theodoric ought to be considered as\r\nbelonging to his line. Thus then, manifest your anxious care for the\r\nwelfare of our kingdom, while your hearts are at ease, through God's\r\ngoodness, as to our internal security.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 702: 'Arma Gothorum nullâ promissionum mearum varietate\r\nfrangenda sunt.' An evident allusion to the treacherous and\r\nunpatriotic diplomacy of Theodahad, as described by Procopius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n32. KING WITIGIS TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Overtures for peace with the Empire.]\r\n\r\n'How much, oh most clement Emperor, we long for the sweetness of your\r\nfavour, may be understood from this fact alone, that after such\r\nserious injuries and such grievous bloodshed as you have inflicted on\r\nus, we still come forward to ask for peace with you, as if none of\r\nyour servants had ever wronged us. We have suffered such things as\r\nmight move the indignation even of our enemies, who must know that\r\nthey have attacked us without our guilt, have hated us without our\r\nfault, have despoiled us without our owing them anything. Nor can it\r\nbe said that the blow has been so slight that no account need be taken\r\nof it, since it has been struck not in the Provinces alone but in Rome\r\n[or Italy] herself, the Capital of the World[703]. Think how great\r\nmust be our pain at this, which nevertheless we banish from memory in\r\norder that we may obtain justice at your hands. Such disturbance has\r\nbeen made as the whole world speaks of[704] [and condemns], and it\r\ndeserves to be so composed by you that all men may admire your spirit\r\nof equity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 703: 'Non in provinciis tantum sed in ipso rerum capite\r\nprobatur inflictum.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 704: 'Talis res effecta est quam mundus loquatur.' The\r\ncommentator Fornerius absurdly understands this of Mundus, the general\r\nof Justinian in Dalmatia, who had already fallen in battle before the\r\naccession of Witigis.]\r\n\r\n'If vengeance on King Theodahad be the thing required, I [who have put\r\nhim to death] merit your love. If you desire to honour the blessed\r\nmemory of Queen Amalasuentha, think of her daughter[705], who has\r\nreached [by our means] that royal station to which your soldiers might\r\nwell have striven to exalt her, in order that all the nations might\r\nsee how faithful you remained to the old friendship.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: Matasuentha, now wife of Witigis.]\r\n\r\n'This fact too ought to influence you, that by the ordering of\r\nProvidence we were permitted to make your acquaintance before our\r\naccession to the throne, that the remembrance of our favourable\r\nreception at your Court, and the sight of your person in that splendid\r\nposition, might move us to love and reverence.\r\n\r\n'Even now you can undo all that has been misdone, since the continual\r\nexpectation of favours to come, makes perseverance in affection\r\neasy[706]. Therefore, soliciting your Clemency with all due respect,\r\nwe inform you that we have appointed A and B our ambassadors to the\r\nWisdom of your Serenity, that you may, according to your custom, duly\r\nweigh all these considerations, that the two Republics may persevere\r\nin restored harmony, and that all which hath been settled in past\r\ntimes by Sovereigns of blessed memory may, by God's help, be increased\r\nand made more prosperous under your dominion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 706: 'Quando non est difficile illum in affectu retinere,\r\nqui gratiam constat desideranter expetere.' Very nearly, but not\r\nquite, the modern proverb which says that gratitude is 'a lively sense\r\nof favours to come.']\r\n\r\n'The rest of their commission will be more fully explained to your\r\nSerenity by the aforesaid ambassadors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n33. KING WITIGIS TO THE MASTER OF THE OFFICES [AT CONSTANTINOPLE].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embassy to Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n'In sending our two ambassadors to the most serene Emperor, it is\r\nfitting also to send letters of salutation[707] to your Greatness. May\r\nyour prudence support our reasonable requests with the Emperor. You\r\ncan easily correct those things [the war against the Gothic people]\r\nwhich you ought never to have allowed to take place; and all things\r\ncan now be arranged in the most friendly manner, since a\r\nreconciliation between men who have fought out their quarrel is often\r\nthe surest ground of friendship. An unknown man might possibly have\r\nbeen shunned by you; but I, who have seen the magnificence of your\r\nRepublic, who have known the hearts of so many of your noble\r\nstatesmen, have no desire to quarrel with your most pious Emperor, if\r\nhe will only cherish thoughts of justice towards me. If another\r\n[Theodahad] deserved the anger of the Emperor, I ought to be looked\r\nupon with the highest favour, who have executed vengeance on that\r\nhateful predecessor. I have carried your intentions into effect, and\r\ntherefore I deserve reward, not punishment. Let all hatred be buried\r\nin the grave of the sinner; and even if you think nothing of our\r\ndeservings, think of the liberty of the Romans, which is everywhere\r\nsuffering amid the clash of arms. A few words to a man of your wisdom\r\nare sufficient.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 707: 'Salutiferos apices.' See x. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n34. KING WITIGIS TO HIS BISHOPS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'If we owe honour to Priests even when unknown to us, how much more so\r\nto you whom we have seen and spoken to, and with whom we have had\r\nfrequent and familiar intercourse.\r\n\r\n'By the ambassadors who are bearing our letters to the most serene\r\nEmperor we send a message of reverence to your Holiness, hoping that\r\nyou will pray for us and set them forward on their journey with all\r\nnecessary assistance, since you are bound to wish well to those whom\r\nyou know to be united to you by the ties of religion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n35. KING WITIGIS TO THE PRAEFECT OF THESSALONICA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'We are sending two ambassadors to the most serene Emperor, who will\r\nsalute your Greatness. We earnestly hope that your Excellency will\r\nspeed them on their journey.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n'The necessity for a Preface often arises from some contrariety in an\r\nAuthor's position which prevents him from writing as he would wish to\r\nwrite. It is admitted that it is not fair to expect the same degree of\r\nexcellence from a busy man which we may reasonably look for in a man\r\nof leisure. But a man in high official position cannot be a man of\r\nleisure. It would be the highest disgrace to him if he were, since\r\neven his so-called privy-chamber[708] resounds with the noise of\r\nclamorous litigants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: 'Secretum.']\r\n\r\n'I can well understand that a man of few occupations will object\r\nagainst me, here that a word has been thrown out with ill-considered\r\nhaste, there that a commonplace sentiment has not been dressed up in\r\nsufficiently ornamental language, or there that I have not complied\r\nwith the rules of the Ancients by making my persons speak \"in\r\ncharacter.\" But the busy man, hurried from one cause to another, and\r\nconstantly under the necessity of dictating to one man and replying to\r\nanother, will not make these objections, because the consciousness of\r\nhis own literary perils will make him tender in his judgments. And yet\r\nthere is something even in the pressure of business which sometimes\r\npromotes briskness of mind, since the art of speaking is one which is\r\nplaced very much in our own power[709].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: Here follows a sentence which I do not understand:\r\n'Remanet itaque ad excusandum brevitas insperata librorum, quam nemo\r\npurgat diutius, nisi qui bene creditur esse dicturus.']\r\n\r\n'If anyone objects that I, placed in the height of the Praetorian\r\ndignity, should have dictated so few decisions of a legal kind, let\r\nhim know that this was the result of my associating with myself that\r\nmost prudent man Felix[710], whose advice I have followed in every\r\ncase. He is a man of absolute purity of character, of surpassing\r\nknowledge of the law, of distinguished accuracy of speech; a young man\r\nwith the gravity of age, a sweet pleader, a measured orator; one who\r\nby his graceful discharge of his official duties has earned the\r\nfavourable opinion of the public.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 710: This can hardly be the Consul of A.D. 511, since he is\r\ncalled in the next sentence 'senilis juvenis.']\r\n\r\n'Had it not been for his help, overwhelmed by so great a multitude of\r\ncauses, I must either have been found unequal to the burden, or else\r\nperchance have seemed arrogant [in my disregard of previously settled\r\ndecisions]. But, what was more important still, relieved by his\r\nlabours from this duty, I was able to give such attention to the\r\nhigher affairs of the State, that I could not fail to win approbation\r\neven in those arduous duties.\r\n\r\n'I have therefore subjoined two books, in which I myself speak in my\r\ncapacity as Praefect, to the ten in which I have spoken by the mouth\r\nof the King; for it seemed absurd to me to be silent in my\r\nnewly-acquired dignity, who had so often spoken on behalf of others.\r\n\r\n'Then, after these twelve books had been brought to their long-desired\r\nend, my friends compelled me to discuss the substance and the powers\r\nof the Soul, that I might say something _about_ that faculty\r\n_through_ which I had already said so much[711].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: 'De Animae substantiâ vel de virtutibus ejus amici me\r\ndisserere coëgerunt: ut per quam multa diximus, de ipsa quoque dicere\r\nvideremur.']\r\n\r\n'Now then, learned men! view these letters with indulgence. If there\r\nbe no eloquence in them, attribute it to my many occupations, which\r\nhave prevented my reading as much as I would gladly have done. Cicero,\r\nthat fountain of eloquence, when he was one day asked to speak,\r\nexcused himself on the ground that he had read nothing the day before.\r\nThe barn must be constantly refilled if it is not to become empty. All\r\nthat is good in our minds is the fruit of study, and soon withers if\r\nit be separated from reading, which is the parent stem. Great\r\nindulgence therefore should be shown to us if we have often had to\r\nwrite when we were busy, to be read by others when we had no leisure\r\nto read, ourselves. And now enough of excuses, lest too elaborate a\r\ndefence should rather injure our cause.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THIRTY-NINE LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS IN HIS OWN NAME\r\nAS PRAEFECTUS PRAETORIO, AND ONE ON BEHALF OF THE ROMAN SENATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME\r\n(A.D. 534)[712].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 712: This letter, which was not composed immediately after\r\nCassiodorus' accession to office, most have been written after the\r\ndeath of the Frankish King Theodoric, which occurred, according to\r\nClinton, early in 534, and before October 2 of the same year, the date\r\nof the death of Athalaric. Notwithstanding the obscurity of many of\r\nthe allusions in it, this document is one of our best authorities for\r\nthe history of Amalasuentha's regency, and is therefore translated\r\nalmost verbatim.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassiodorus on his promotion to the Praefecture.]\r\n\r\n'If I can only be sure that my advancement is acceptable to you,\r\nConscript Fathers, I shall not doubt of its being approved by God and\r\npopular with all good men.\r\n\r\n'It is in the nature of things to love a colleague, and you are in\r\nfact exalting your own honour when you approve of a dignity given to a\r\n_Senator_[713].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: Partly a pun on his name, partly an allusion to his\r\nrank.]\r\n\r\n'After our Sovereigns there is none to whom I so much desire to\r\ncommend myself as you. To me honour will ever be the sole test of\r\nadvantage. Justice, like a handmaid, will wait upon my actions; and\r\nthe power, which I have not myself bought from our virtuous Sovereign,\r\nI in my turn shall sell to no man. You have heard, noble Sirs, the\r\npanegyrics[714] passed upon me at my entrance into office. These\r\npraises I will not dare to call false, but I will say that they lay\r\nupon me a heavy responsibility to show that they are not unmerited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: The letter written by Cassiodorus himself, in the name\r\nof Athalaric, to announce his elevation to the Praefecture (Var. ix.\r\n25).]\r\n\r\n'Happy fortune of our time in which, while the Sovereign himself takes\r\nholiday, the love of his mother rules and covers us all with the robe\r\nof her universal charity! Happy for the young Ruler, who in this\r\ndifficult position learns first to triumph over his impetuous\r\nimpulses, and attains in the springtime of his life that self-control\r\nwhich hoary age with difficulty acquires!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\n'As for the Mother whom he so dutifully obeys, her most fittingly do\r\nall kingdoms venerate, whom to behold is to adore, to listen to is to\r\nwitness a miracle. Of what language is she not a perfect mistress? She\r\nis skilled in the niceties of Attic eloquence; she shines in the\r\nmajesty of Roman speech; she glories in the wealth of the language of\r\nher fathers. She is equally marvellous in all these, and in each the\r\norator in his own especial tongue feels himself surpassed by her. A\r\ngreat safeguard and a great excellence is this in the ruler of so many\r\nnationalities. None needs an interpreter with his accomplished\r\nmistress. No ambassador need wait, or hear his words slowly filtered\r\nthrough the mind of a go-between. Everyone feels that his own words\r\nare listened to, and receives his answer from her lips in the language\r\nof his forefathers.\r\n\r\n'To these accomplishments, as a splendid diadem, is added that\r\npriceless knowledge of Literature, by which the treasures of ancient\r\nlearning are appropriated, and the dignity of the throne is ever\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\n'Yet, while she rejoices in such perfect mastery of language, on\r\npublic occasions she is so taciturn that she might be supposed to be\r\nindolent. With a few words she unties the knots of entangled\r\nlitigations, she calmly arranges hot disputes, she silently promotes\r\nthe public welfare. You do not hear her announce beforehand what will\r\nbe her course of action in public; but with marvellous skill she\r\nattains, by feigning, those points which she knows require to be\r\nrapidly gained[715].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: 'Et temperamento mirabili dissimulando peragit quod\r\naccelerandum esse cognoscit.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comparison to Placidia.]\r\n\r\n'What case like this can be produced from the annals of revered\r\nAntiquity? Placidia's care for her purple-clad son has often been\r\ncelebrated; but by Placidia's lax administration of the Empire its\r\nboundaries were unbecomingly retrenched. She gained for him a wife and\r\nfor herself a daughter-in-law[716] by the loss of Illyricum; and thus\r\nthe union of Sovereigns was bought by a lamentable division of the\r\nProvinces[717]. The discipline of the soldiers was relaxed by too long\r\npeace; and, in short, Valentinian, under the guardianship of his\r\nmother, lost more than he could have done if he had been a helpless\r\norphan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: 'Eudoxia.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: 'Nurum denique sibi amissione Illyrici comparavit:\r\nfactaque est conjunctio Regnantis, divisio dolenda provinciis.' On\r\nthis alleged loss of Illyricum by the Western Empire, see Gibbon, cap.\r\nxxxiii. note 6. One may doubt, however, whether Cassiodorus has been\r\ncorrectly informed concerning it. Noricum and Pannonia at the time of\r\nValentinian's marriage must have been entirely in the possession of\r\nthe Huns; and on the dissolution of their monarchy Noricum at any rate\r\nseems to be connected with the Western rather than the Eastern Empire.\r\nAs for Dalmatia, or the _Province_ (as distinct from the\r\n_Praefecture_) of Illyricum, the retirement thither of the Emperor\r\nNepos in 475, and the previous history of his uncle Marcellinus, point\r\ntowards the conclusion that this Province was then considered as\r\nbelonging _de jure_ to the Caesar of Rome rather than to him of\r\nConstantinople.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations with the East.]\r\n\r\n'But under this Lady, who can count as many Kings as ancestors in her\r\npedigree, our army by Divine help is a terror to foreign nations.\r\nBeing kept in a prudent equipoise it is neither worn away by continual\r\nfighting nor enervated by unbroken peace. In the very beginnings of\r\nthe reign, when a new ruler's precarious power is apt to be most\r\nassailed, contrary to the wish of the Eastern Emperor she made the\r\nDanube a Roman stream. Well known is all that the invaders suffered,\r\nof which I therefore omit further mention, that the shame of defeat\r\nmay not be too closely associated with the thought of the Emperor, our\r\nally. Still, what he thought of your part of the Empire is clear from\r\nthis, that he conceded to our attack that peace which he has refused\r\nto the abject entreaties of others. Add this fact, that though we have\r\nrarely sought him he has honoured us with so many embassies, and that\r\nthus his unique majesty has bowed down the stately head of the Orient\r\nto exalt the lords of Italy[718].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: 'Et singularis illa potentia, ut _Italicos Dominos_,\r\nerigeret, reverentiam Eoi culminis ordinavit.' This somewhat favours\r\nthe notion that Theodoric and his successors called themselves Kings\r\nof Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expedition against the Franks.]\r\n\r\n'The Franks also, overmighty by their victories over so many barbarous\r\ntribes--by what a great expedition were they harassed! Attacked, they\r\ndreaded a contest with our soldiers; they who had leaped unawares upon\r\nso many nations and forced them into battle. But though that haughty\r\nrace declined the offered conflict, they could not prevent the death\r\nof their own King. For Theodoric[719], he who had so often availed\r\nhimself of the name of our glorious King as an occasion for triumph,\r\nnow fell vanquished in the struggle with disease--a stroke of Divine\r\nProvidence surely, to prevent us from staining ourselves with the\r\nblood of our kindred, and yet to grant some revenge to the army which\r\nhad been justly called out to war. Hail! thou Gothic array, happy\r\nabove all other happiness, who strikest at the life of a Royal foe,\r\nyet leavest us not the poorer by the life of one of the least of our\r\nsoldiers[720].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 719: Theodoric I, son of Clovis, King of the Franks,\r\nreigning at Metz, died, as before stated, in 534.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 720: 'Et nobis nec unius ultimi facta subducis (?).']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: League with the Burgundians.]\r\n\r\n'The Burgundian too, in order to receive his own again, crouched in\r\ndevotion, giving up his whole self that he might receive a trifle. For\r\nhe chose to obey with unimpaired territories, rather than to resist\r\nwith these cut short; and thus, by laying aside his arms, he most\r\neffectually defended his kingdom, recovering by his prayers what he\r\nhad lost by the sword[721].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 721: 'Burgundio quinetiam, ut sua reciperet, devotus\r\neffectus est: reddens se totum dum accepisset exiguum. Elegit quippe\r\ninteger obedire, quam imminutus obsistere: tutius tunc defendit regnum\r\nquando arma deposuit. Recuperavit enim prece, quod amisit in acie.'\r\nThe meaning of these mysterious words, as interpreted by Binding\r\n(268-270) and Jahn (ii. 252), is that Godomar, King of the\r\nBurgundians, received back from Amalasuentha (probably about 530, or a\r\nlittle later) the territory between the Durance and the Isere, which\r\nTheodoric had wrested from his brother in 523. The occasion of this\r\ncession was probably some league of mutual defence against the Franks,\r\nwhich Cassiodorus could without dishonesty represent as a kind of\r\nvassalage of Burgundy to Ostrogothia. If so, it availed Godomar\r\nlittle, as his territories were overrun by the Frankish Kings in 532,\r\nand the conquest of them was apparently completed by 534 (Jahn ii.\r\n68-78).]\r\n\r\n'Happy Princess, whose enemies either fall by the hand of God, or else\r\nby your bounty are united with your Empire! Rejoice, Goths and Romans\r\nalike, and hail this marvel, a being who unites the excellences of\r\nboth the sexes! As woman she has given birth to your illustrious King,\r\nwhile with manly fortitude of mind she has maintained the bounds of\r\nyour Empire.\r\n\r\n'And now, if leaving the realm of war we enter the inner courts of her\r\nmoral goodness, a hundred tongues will not suffice to sound forth all\r\nher praises. Her justice is as great as her goodwill, but even greater\r\nis her kindness than her power. You, Senators, know the heavenly\r\ngoodness which she has shown to your order, restoring those who had\r\nmet with affliction to a higher state than that from which they had\r\nfallen[722], and exalting to honour those who were still uninjured.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 722: 'Afflictos statu meliore restituit.' An allusion,\r\nprobably, to her kindness to the families of Boethius and Symmachus.]\r\n\r\n'Look at the case of the Patrician Liberius[723], Praefect of the\r\nGauls--a man of charming manners, of distinguished merit, a soldier\r\nwith honourable scars--who even while absent in his Praefecture has\r\nreceived the _fasces_ and a patrimony from her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 723: No doubt the same Liberius who nobly defended the\r\ncharacter of Amalasuentha at the Court of Justinian (Procopius, De\r\nBello Gotthico i. 4). Apparently he was made Consul, but his name does\r\nnot appear in the Fasti at this time.]\r\n\r\n'What can I say of her strength of mind and tenacity of purpose, in\r\nwhich she excels even philosophers? I speak of this from my own\r\nexperience. You know, oh Conscript Fathers, what influences were\r\narrayed against me[724]. Neither gold nor the prayers of great men\r\navailed: all things were tried, and tried in vain, to prove the\r\nglorious constancy of that wisest Lady.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 724: Probably to prevent his obtaining the Praefecture.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of the Amal Kings.]\r\n\r\n'And here the rules of rhetoric would require me to compare her with a\r\nlong line of Empresses in the past. But if men cannot vie with her\r\nglory, what is the use of adducing female examples? If we look at the\r\nRoyal Cohort of her ancestors, we shall see that she, like a pure\r\nmirror, reflects all their excellences. For Amal[725] was conspicuous\r\nfor his good fortune, Ostrogotha for his patience, Athal for mildness,\r\nMunitarius [Winithar] for justice, Unimund for beauty, Thorismuth for\r\nchastity, Unalamer [Walamir] for faith, Theudimer for warmth of\r\nheart[726], and Theodoric, the renowned father of Amalasuentha, as ye\r\nhave all seen, for patience. Each of these would recognise in her his\r\nown special attribute, but all would acknowledge that in these very\r\nattributes they are excelled by her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 725: This and the following names belong to the ancestors of\r\nAmalasuentha, and are found with slight variations in the treatise of\r\nJordanes on the History of the Goths, which was founded on a similar\r\ntreatise by Cassiodorus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 726: 'Pietate Theudimer.']\r\n\r\n'You will now perhaps expect me to praise our young King, but in\r\nextolling the author of his being, I have abundantly extolled him, her\r\noffspring. You will remember that excellent saying of the eloquent\r\nSymmachus, \"I hesitate to praise the beginning of his career because I\r\nam confidently hoping for his advance in virtue[727].\" Come to my\r\nhelp, Conscript Fathers, and render to your Lords and mine your united\r\nthanks for my promotion.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 727: 'Specto feliciter virtutis ejus augmenta, qui differo\r\nlaudare principia.' The annotator says that these words are not to be\r\nfound in the extant writings of Symmachus [the orator]. It was\r\nprobably the younger Symmachus, the father-in-law of Boethius, who\r\nuttered them. At this time Athalaric was killing himself by his\r\ndebaucheries.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO POPE JOHN[728].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 728: Pope John II (a Roman, son of Projectus, and originally\r\nnamed Mercurius) succeeded Boniface II Jan. 1, 533. His pontificate\r\nlasted till May 26, 535. His successor was Agapetus. This letter\r\nappears to have been written at a time of scarcity in Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Salutations to the Pope.]\r\n\r\n'Your prayers are assuredly the cause of our promotion. Your fastings\r\nhave procured plenty for the citizens. Saluting you therefore with all\r\ndue reverence, we pray you to continue your prayers for long life to\r\nour rulers, for peace and plenty to the State, and for an increase of\r\nheavenly wisdom to me. Let the Judge in public life be such as the\r\nCatholic Church has trained her son to be. I am indeed a Judge of the\r\nPalace, but I shall not cease to be your disciple[729]. Cast not off\r\nupon me the whole care of this City, which you watch over with a\r\nfather's love, but take thought both for its bodily and spiritual\r\nwants, and admonish me whenever you think I am erring. Your See is an\r\nobject of admiration through all lands, and your charity is\r\nworld-wide; but yet you have also an especial, local love for the\r\nsheep of your own flock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 729: 'Sum quidem Judex Palatinus, sed vester non desinam\r\nesse discipulus.']\r\n\r\n'Rome has in her own borders those shrines of martyrdom[730] of the\r\nApostles [Peter and Paul] which the whole world longs to behold. With\r\nsuch patrons, if only your prayers ascend, we need fear no evil.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 730: 'Confessiones.']\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO DIVERS BISHOPS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Salutations to the Bishops.]\r\n\r\n'Fathers after the flesh delight in the advancement of their sons.\r\nEven so do ye, my spiritual fathers, diligently pray to the Holy\r\nTrinity that He may make my candle to give light to all that are in\r\nthe house; yea, and that He may so purge and enlighten mine own\r\nconscience that I may not, while an accurate Judge over other men, be\r\na deceiver of mine own self.\r\n\r\n'I beg of you to declare a fast, and supplicate the Lord that He will\r\nprolong the life of our Sovereigns[731], for the happiness of the\r\nrealm; that He will defend our State from the assaults of its enemies,\r\nwill give us all tranquillity in our time, and will deign to make me\r\nworthy of your love.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 731: This was written, no doubt, when Athalaric was on his\r\ndeathbed.]\r\n\r\n'Watch narrowly the acts of the subordinates whom I send among you,\r\nand inform me of anything which they do amiss. I cannot be held\r\nresponsible for deeds of which I know nothing. And if they take bribes\r\nthey at least cannot justify themselves by saying that they have first\r\nhad to pay money for their offices.\r\n\r\n'Continue to afford your wonted solace to the widow and orphan; yet\r\nbeware that your pity does not lead you to seek to set aside the laws\r\neven for these. Oh, most holy men, banish to the home of all other\r\nunclean spirits violence, avarice, hatred, rapine; and root out from\r\namong your people luxury, which is the depopulator of the human race.\r\nLet the Bishop teach, that the Judge may have a maiden assize[732]. If\r\nonly your preaching he continued, the penal course of law must\r\nnecessarily come to an end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 732: 'Episcopus doceat, ne judex possit invenire quod\r\npuniat.']\r\n\r\n'I therefore commend my dignity to your prayers, and end my letter\r\nwith a salutation of love and honour to your Holinesses.'\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO HIS DEPUTY[733] AMBROSIUS, AN\r\nILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 733: 'Agenti vices.' Bethmann Hollweg (Gerichtsverfassung\r\ndes sinkenden römischen Reichs, pp. 49-50) remarks: 'The relation of\r\nthe _Vices Magistratuum agentes_ does not belong to the _Jurisdictio\r\nmandata_. They are lieutenants (Stellvertreter) who are substituted\r\nprovisionally in the room of an ordinary official of the Empire or of\r\na Province, on account of his being temporarily disqualified or\r\nsuspended from office by the Emperor or Praetorian Praefect. The\r\nmunicipal magistrates were also represented by _vices agentes_. But\r\nthe extant authorities give us no very clear information as to their\r\nposition.' Unfortunately this letter, relating to a _vices agens_ of\r\nthe Praetorian Praefect himself, does not add much to our\r\ninformation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Functions of the Praefect's Deputy.]\r\n\r\n'We have formed a high opinion of you from long observation of your\r\ncareer as an Advocate, and feel sure that you will justify that\r\nopinion by your conduct in the office to which we are now calling you.\r\nThe Forum has long resounded to your eloquence: now your turn is come\r\nto sit upon the magistrate's bench. Hitherto you have assisted the\r\nofficers of the court: now you are yourself called upon to play the\r\npart of a Judge. Even when you are absent from me, you will be deemed\r\nto be sitting by my side; but whatever credit you may earn when\r\nhearing a case by yourself will be reckoned to you alone.\r\n\r\n'We therefore ordain that the official staff which waits upon our\r\norders shall be at your disposal, to carry your decisions into effect,\r\nand to see that none treat them with contempt.\r\n\r\n'If you shall think it necessary to hand over any [insolvent] persons\r\nto those who have become security for them, assume that right with\r\nconfidence, because that will most effectually relieve my mind when I\r\nshall learn that this matter has been finally disposed of by you[734].\r\nFor if I were present you might give me words only; but now in my\r\nabsence you owe me, rather, deeds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 734: I suggest this with hesitation as the translation of a\r\ndifficult sentence: 'Si quos etiam fidejussoribus committere\r\nnecessarium aestimaveris, confidenter assume: quia illud magis\r\nrelevare potest animum nostrum, si aliquid per vos cognoscimus\r\nimpletum.' Cassiodorus seems to be urging his deputy not to shrink\r\nfrom the exercise of even the most stringent rights inherent in his\r\noffice, in order that causes may be terminated without reference to\r\nhim. But is there authority for such a translation of the words\r\n'fidejussoribus committere?']\r\n\r\n'Think, then, of all that is involved in your high office. Let your\r\ntoil procure me rest from all men. Avoid the rocks on either side of\r\nyou. These warnings come rather from my over-particularity[735] than\r\nfrom any distrust of you, for I believe that with God's help you will\r\norder all things as shall be best for our fame and for the Republic.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 735: 'Curiositas.']\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n[On the occasion of a scarcity in Rome, either existing or dreaded.\r\nSee the letter to Pope John II (xi. 2).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grain distributions for Rome.]\r\n\r\n'I am sure that you will rejoice with me if the needs of the Roman\r\npeople can be satisfied by our means, and thus we can testify our\r\ngratitude for the hospitality which we have both received from that\r\nCity. To this end have we endured the discomforts of travel, for this\r\npurpose have we racked our brains with anxious thought, that that\r\npeople, which tasted such delights of old in the happy days of its\r\nformer rulers, may now see its necessities relieved and again enjoy\r\nits former prosperity.\r\n\r\n'Their poverty and hunger we make our own. Therefore, with all speed,\r\nlet stores of grain in good condition be at once collected, so that\r\nthe bread cooked therefrom may be a delight and not a horror. Let just\r\nweight be given. Flee all thought of unholy profit from this source.\r\nMy own soul is wounded if anyone dares to transgress in this matter of\r\nthe food-supply of the people. Not favour nor popular applause is my\r\naim; but to be permitted, by God's help, to accomplish my own heart's\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n'I love all my fellow-countrymen, but the Roman citizens deserve more\r\nthan ordinary love from me. Theirs is a City adorned with so many\r\nillustrious Senators, blest with such a noble commonalty, a City so\r\nwell fitted to celebrate the victories of our glorious rulers. When\r\nthe question of my promotion hung in suspense, it was the good wishes\r\nof these citizens which turned the scale in my favour with the lords\r\nof the world[736], who complied with the universal desire of the Roman\r\npeople. Come, then; so act that this goodwill of theirs to me may\r\ncontinue. Let us all beseech the mercy of the Most High to bless us\r\nwith an abundant harvest; and let us resolve that, if we are thus\r\nfavoured, no negligence of ours shall diminish, no venality divert\r\nfrom its proper recipients, the bounty of Heaven[737].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 736: Athalaric and Amalasuentha.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 737: In the last sentence but one, 'Fidem meam promitto: sed\r\ncum ipsis Divinitatis dona sustineo, cautelam offero,' I would suggest\r\n_ipsius_ for 'ipsis,' making _cum_ = 'when,' not 'with.' There does\r\nnot seem to be any antecedent plural to which 'ipsis' can refer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO JOANNES, CANCELLARIUS.\r\n\r\n[An interesting letter, as showing the lowly original of the office\r\nfrom whence have sprung the mediaeval and modern Chancellors.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Functions of the Cancellarius.]\r\n\r\n'Your rare merit causes you to enjoy a position beyond that which of\r\nright belongs to you in the official hierarchy[738]. Those who are\r\nabove you cheerfully manifest to you a deference which you might be\r\nrequired to show to them; and thus you, while keeping your inferiors\r\nin their proper place, take without presumption precedence of many of\r\nyour superiors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 738: 'Transgressio matriculae actio tua est.']\r\n\r\n'This laudable prejudice has assigned to you, from the twelfth\r\nIndiction[739], the dignity of Cancellarius[740].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 739: September 1, 533.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 740: 'Hoc igitur laudabili praejudicium a duodecima\r\nIndictione cancellorum tibi decus attribuit.']\r\n\r\n'Guard then the secrets of our Consistory with incorruptible fidelity.\r\nThrough your intervention the petitioner for justice has to approach\r\nme. On your acts depends in great measure the opinion which men shall\r\nform of me; for as a house is judged by its front towards the street,\r\nand men by the trimness or shabbiness of their raiment, so are we high\r\nofficials judged by the demeanour of our subordinates who represent us\r\nto the crowd. Therefore, if such officials do anything which redounds\r\nto their master's dishonour, they put themselves altogether outside\r\nthe pale of his clemency.\r\n\r\n'Remember your title, _Cancellarius_. Ensconced behind the\r\nlattice-work (cancelli) of your compartment, keeping guard behind\r\nthose windowed doors, however studiously you may conceal yourself, it\r\nis inevitable that you be the observed of all observers[741]. If you\r\nstep forth, _my_ glances range all over you: if you return to your\r\nshelter, the eyes of the litigants are upon you. This is where\r\nAntiquity ruled that you should be placed, in order that your actions\r\nshould be visible to all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 741: 'Respice quo nomine nuncuperis. Latere non potest quod\r\ninter cancellos egeris. Tenes quippe lucidas fores, claustra patentia,\r\nfenestratas januas; et quamvis studiose claudas, necesse est ut te\r\ncunctis aperias.']\r\n\r\n'Attend now to this advice which I have given you, and let it not\r\nmerely filter through your mind, like water through a pipe, but let it\r\nsink down into your heart, and, safely stored up there, let it\r\ninfluence the actions of your life.'\r\n\r\n\r\n7. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO ALL THE JUDGES OF THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duties of the Collectors of Taxes.]\r\n\r\n'It is an excellent thing that the yearly taxes should be regularly\r\npaid. What confidence does the consciousness of this give to the\r\ntaxpayer, who can march boldly through the Forum, feeling that he owes\r\nnothing to anybody and need not fear the face of any official! One can\r\nonly enjoy an estate if one has no fear of the process-server making\r\nhis appearance upon it.\r\n\r\n'Therefore, in the Diocese of your Excellency[742], we desire you and\r\nyour staff at the beginning of this twelfth Indiction[743], with all\r\nproper gentleness, to impress upon the cultivator of the soil that he\r\nmust pay his land-tax[744] and end those long arrears, which were\r\nintroduced not for the assistance of the taxpayer, but for the corrupt\r\nprofit of the tax-collector. For the officials who in this way\r\nprofessed to relieve the burdens of the people, really imposed upon\r\nthem a heavier and more hateful weight in the shape of douceurs[745]\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 742: 'Dicationis tuae.' A peculiar and untranslatable form\r\nof respect.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 743: September 1, 533.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 744: 'Trina illatio' (See Var. ii. 24). So called because it\r\nwas collected three times in the year. See Dahn, Könige der Germanen\r\niii. 140; and Sartorius, Regierung der Ostg. 200. The latter seems\r\nhowever to confuse it with the 'tertiae,' from which Dahn very\r\nproperly distinguishes it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 745: 'Nundinationes.']\r\n\r\n'Let then this hateful swindling be henceforth banished. Let the\r\ncultivator pay nothing more than his lawful debt to the Treasury, and\r\nlet him pay it at the appointed time, thus removing the confusion in\r\nwhich the slowness of collection has involved our accounts.\r\n\r\n'Make up, therefore, the abstracts of accounts[746] at the stated\r\ntimes, and forward them to the proper bureaux[747], according to old\r\nlaw and the authority of this present edict; and if you neglect any of\r\nthese injunctions, know that you do so at your peril. To quicken your\r\ndiligence we have appointed A and B, persons of tried merit in the\r\npast, to supervise the proceedings of yourself and your staff, that\r\nthis double check may prevent the possibility of negligence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 746: 'Breves.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 747: 'Scrinia.']\r\n\r\n'Act then with justice if you wish to receive further promotion. Only\r\nthose gains are to be sought for which the cultivator gladly offers\r\nand which the public servant can securely accept. If you take bribes\r\nyou will be miserable ever after, through fear of discovery; but if\r\nyou act uprightly, you will have in me a willing spectator and\r\nrewarder of your merits. I am most anxious to be your friend; do not\r\nforce me against my will to become your enemy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8. EDICT PUBLISHED THROUGH THE PROVINCES BY SENATOR, PRAETORIAN\r\nPRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict announcing Cassiodorus' principles of\r\nadministration.]\r\n\r\n'The custom of the ancients was for a new ruler to promulgate a new\r\nset of laws to his subjects, but now it is sufficient praise to a\r\nconscientious ruler that he adheres to the legislation of Antiquity.\r\n\r\n'Do you all study to perform good actions, and shrink from deeds of\r\nlawlessness and sedition, and you will have nothing to fear from your\r\nGovernors. I know that some fear, however irrational, is felt in the\r\npresence of the Judge; but as far as my purpose can avail, with the\r\nhelp of God and the rulers of the State[748], I can promise you that\r\nall things shall be done with justice and moderation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748: 'Juvante Deo, rerumque Dominis regnantibus.']\r\n\r\n'Venality, that greatest stain upon a Judge's character, will be\r\nunknown in me; for I should think scorn to sell the words that go out\r\nof my lips, like clothes in the market-place.\r\n\r\n'In exercising the right of pre-emption we shall be solely guided by\r\nthe wants of the State, buying nothing at a forced price in order to\r\nsell it again[749].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 749: 'Sperari a vobis aliquid sola specierum indigentia\r\nfaciet, non malitiosa venalitas ... nec ad taxationem trahimus quae\r\nnecessaria non habentur.']\r\n\r\n'Be cheerful and of good courage, therefore, with reference to the new\r\nadministration. No soldier or civil servant shall harass you for his\r\nown pleasure. No tax-collector shall load you with burdens of his own\r\nimposition. We are determined to keep not only our own hands clean,\r\nbut also those of our officials. Otherwise, vainly does a good Judge\r\nguard himself from receiving money, if he leaves to the many under him\r\nlicence to receive it on their own account. But we, both by precept\r\nand example, show that we aim at the public good, not at private and\r\nfraudulent gains.\r\n\r\n'We know what prayers you put up for us, how anxiously you watched for\r\nour elevation, and we are determined that you shall not be\r\ndisappointed. Our Praetorium, which no base action has ever denied,\r\nshall be open to all. No servile throng shall lord it over you. You\r\nshall come straight to us, making your requests known to us through no\r\nhired interpreter, and none shall leave our presence poorer than he\r\nentered it. With God's help we trust we shall so act as to conform to\r\nthe instructions which we have received from our Sovereign[750]; and\r\nwe trust that you, by your loyalty, will enable us to be rather the\r\nFather of our Provinces than their Judge. You have patiently obeyed\r\ngovernors who fleeced you; how much more ought you to obey one who, as\r\nyou know, loves you mightily! Pay the regular fees to the officials\r\nwho are labouring in your midst; for there is no such excuse for\r\nhigh-handed oppression as the fact that a man is not receiving his\r\ncovenanted salary. Obey the rule of reason, and you will not have to\r\nfear the armed man's wrath.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 750: 'Quemadmodum a rerum Dominis mandata suscepimus.']\r\n\r\n'We wish that you should enjoy the privileges conceded to you by\r\nformer rulers without any encroachment by violent men.\r\n\r\n'And now be of good heart; I pledge myself for your righteous\r\ngovernment. Had I been present with you face to face, ye could not\r\nhave seen my mind; but ye can read it in this letter, which is the\r\nmirror of my heart, the true image of my will, and ye can see that it\r\ndesires only your prosperity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n9. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE JUDGES OF THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exhortation to the Judges to govern in conformity with the\r\nEdict.]\r\n\r\n'Knowing that past suffering makes men anxious and timid as to the\r\nfuture, we have put forth an edict [the preceding document] in order\r\nto reassure the minds of the Provincials, and to deliver them from the\r\ntorment of ever-present fear.\r\n\r\n'Therefore we call upon your Excellency[751] to cause this edict to be\r\nexposed in all the places which are most resorted to. Thus let the\r\nlove and devotion of all classes be excited towards our happy\r\nSovereigns[752], that as our thoughts towards the people are entirely\r\nthoughts of goodwill, so their dispositions towards the rulers who\r\ngovern them in righteousness may be only loyal[753].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 751: 'Dicatio tua.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 752: 'Circa Dominos felices.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 753: 'Ita se et illi devotos debent _pie regnantibus_\r\nexhibere.' Compare again Claudian's words:\r\n\r\n    'Nunquam libertas gratior exstat,\r\n    Quam sum _rege pio_.']\r\n\r\n'It now rests with you, by your just government of the Provincials, to\r\ncarry our promises into effect.\r\n\r\n'Remember that the official staff standing by, is a witness of the\r\nacts of every one of you; and so comport yourselves, that both they\r\nand all others may see that you in your own conduct obey the laws\r\nwhich you administer.\r\n\r\n'Be more anxious to remedy the poverty of the Provincials than to\r\ninflict punishment upon them. So act that when you are giving an\r\naccount of your stewardship your year of office may be felt to have\r\nbeen all too short[754]. If you have acted justly, and earned the\r\ngoodwill of your Provincials, you will have no need of gifts to stave\r\noff accusations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 754: 'Sic agite ut cum justitia probata quaeritur, annus\r\nvester brevis esse videatur.']\r\n\r\n'We do not appoint any spies upon your actions, and we pray you so to\r\nact that this most humiliating expedient may not be necessary.\r\n\r\n'If you meet with any who pertinaciously set themselves up against the\r\nauthority of your _fasces_, send us at once a messenger with your\r\nreport; or, if you cannot spare such an one, send the report alone, as\r\nyou have authority to use the public postal-service[755]. Thus all\r\nexcuse for remissness on your part is taken away, since you can either\r\nwield your power or explain to us the hindrances which beset you.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 755: 'Quando et evectiones publicas accepistis et nobis\r\ngratum sit audire de talibus.']\r\n\r\n\r\n10. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO BEATUS, VIR CLARISSIMUS AND\r\nCANCELLARIUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Davus is invalided to the Mons Lactarius.]\r\n\r\n'Our lord the King[756] (whose prayer it is that he may ever rejoice\r\nin the welfare of all his subjects), when he reflected upon the\r\nimpaired health of his servant Davus[757], ordered him to seek to the\r\nhealing properties of the Mons Lactarius[758], for the cure which\r\nmedical aid seemed powerless to bestow. A frequent cough resounded\r\nfrom his panting chest, his limbs were becoming emaciated, and the\r\nfood which he took seemed to have lost all power to nourish his frame.\r\nPersons in this state can neither feed nor endure to fast, and their\r\nbodies seem like leaky casks, from which all strength must soon\r\ndribble away.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 756: 'Rerum Domini clementia.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 757: Or David, according to some MSS.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 758: This is no doubt the mountain on whose skirts was\r\nfought the decisive battle between Narses and Teias in 553, now known\r\nas Monte Lettere. It is a spur of the range reaching from Sorrento to\r\nSalerno, which attains its highest elevation in Monte San Angelo\r\n(4,690 feet high).

The\r\ncows which are fed on this herbage give a milk which seems to be the\r\nonly remedy for consumptive patients who have been quite given over by\r\ntheir physicians. As sleep refreshes the weary limbs of toil, so does\r\nthis milk fill up the wasted limbs and restore the vanished strength.\r\nStrange is it to see the herds feeding on this abundant pasture. They\r\nlook as if it did not profit them at all. Thin and scraggy, as they\r\nwander through the thickets they look like the patients who seek their\r\naid; yet their milk is so thick that it sticks to the milker's\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n'Do you therefore supply the invalid when he arrives, with the\r\nappointed rations and pecuniary allowance, that he may be suitably\r\nmaintained in that place while he is recreating his exhausted energies\r\nwith the food of infancy.\r\n\r\n'And, oh! all ye who are suffering under the like grievous malady,\r\nlift up your hearts. There is hope for you. By no bitter antidote, but\r\nby a delicious draught, you shall imbibe life--life, in itself the\r\nsweetest of all things.'\r\n\r\n\r\n11. EDICT CONCERNING PRICES TO BE MAINTAINED AT RAVENNA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prices at Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n'The price at which provisions are sold ought to follow, in a\r\nreasonable way, the circumstances of the times, that there may be\r\nneither cheapness in a dear season, nor dearness in a cheap one, and\r\nthat the grumblings of both buyers and sellers may be avoided, by\r\nfairness being observed towards both.\r\n\r\n'Therefore, after careful consideration, we have fixed in the\r\nsubjoined schedule the prices of the various articles of produce,\r\nwhich prices are to remain free from all ambiguity.\r\n\r\n'If any vendor does not observe the prices named in the present edict,\r\nhe will be liable to a fine of six solidi (£3 12s.) for each violation\r\nof the law, and may be visited by corporal punishment[759].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 759: 'Per singulos excessus sex solidorum mulctam a se\r\nnoverit exigendam et fustuario posse subjacere supplicio.']\r\n\r\n[The schedule mentioned in this letter is unfortunately not preserved.\r\nFew documents that Cassiodorus could have handed down to posterity\r\nwould have been more valuable. If we could have compared it with the\r\ncelebrated Edict of Stratonicea (cir. A.D. 301), we should have seen\r\nwhat changes had been wrought in the value of the precious metals and\r\nthe distribution of wealth during the two centuries of disturbance and\r\nbarbaric invasion which had elapsed since the reign of Diocletian.\r\nBut, unfortunately, Cassiodorus believed that his rhetoric and his\r\nnatural history would be more interesting to us than these vulgar\r\nfacts.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. EDICT CONCERNING PRICES ALONG THE FLAMINIAN WAY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prices per Viam Flaminiam.]\r\n\r\n'If prices need to be fixed for the leisurely inhabitant of a town,\r\nmuch more for the traveller, whose journey may otherwise become a\r\nburden instead of a pleasure. Let strangers therefore find that they\r\nare entertained by you at fixed prices. To fawn upon them with feigned\r\npoliteness and then terrify them with enormous charges is the act of\r\na highway robber. Do you not know how much better moderate prices\r\nwould suit your own purpose? Travellers would gladly flock to your\r\naccommodation-houses[760] if they found that you treated them fairly.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 760: This is, I believe, the expression used in some of the\r\nAustralian colonies for what Cassiodorus calls _commoda vestra_.]\r\n\r\n'Let no one think that because he is a long way off, his extortion\r\nwill escape notice, for people are arriving here every day with tales\r\nof your rapacity.\r\n\r\n'An official despatched for the purpose will, after deliberation with\r\nthe citizens and Bishops of each place, decide what prices are to be\r\ncharged there; and then whosoever dares to ask higher prices will have\r\nto pay a fine of six solidi (£3 12s.) and will be afflicted by the\r\nlaceration of his body.\r\n\r\n'Honest gains at the expense of your fellow-citizens ought to suffice\r\nfor all of you.

THE SENATE OF THE CITY OF ROME TO THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supplications of the Senate to Justinian.]\r\n\r\n'It seems a right and proper thing that we should address our prayers\r\nfor the safety of the Roman Republic to a dutiful Sovereign[761], who\r\ncan only desire what will benefit our freedom. We therefore beseech\r\nyou, most clement Emperor, and from the bosom of the Curia we stretch\r\nforth our two hands to you in prayer, that you will grant a most\r\nenduring peace to our King. Spurn not us, who ever seemed certain of\r\nyour love. It is in truth the Roman name that you are commending, if\r\nyou grant gracious terms to our lords. May your league with them\r\nassure the peace of Italy; and if our prayers be not sufficient to\r\naccomplish this thing, imagine that you hear our country break forth\r\nwith these words of supplication: \"If ever I was acceptable to thee,\r\nlove, oh most dutiful Sovereign, love my defenders! They who rule me\r\nought to be in harmony with thee, lest otherwise they begin to do such\r\ndeeds towards me as thou least of all men wouldest desire. Be not to\r\nme a cause of death, thou who hast ever ministered unto me the joys of\r\nlife. Lo, while at peace with thee I have doubled the number of my\r\nchildren, I have been decked with the glory of my citizens. If thou\r\nsufferest me to be wounded, where is thy dutiful name of Son? What\r\ncouldest even thou do more for me [than these rulers], seeing that my\r\nreligion and thine thus flourish under their rule?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 761: 'Pio Principi.']\r\n\r\n'\"My Senate grows in honour and is incessantly increasing in wealth.\r\nDo not dissipate in quarrels what thou oughtest rather to defend with\r\nthe sword. I have had many Kings; but none so trained in letters as\r\nthis one. I have had foreseeing statesmen, but none so powerful in\r\nlearning and religion. I love the Amal, bred up as he has been at my\r\nknees, a strong man, one who has been formed by my conversation, dear\r\nto the Romans by his prudence, venerable to the nations by his valour.\r\nJoin rather thy prayers to his; share with him thy counsels: so that\r\nany prosperity which I may earn may redound to thy glory. Do not woo\r\nme in the only fashion in which I may not be won. Thine am I already\r\nin love, if thou sendest none of thy soldiers to lacerate my limbs.\r\nFor if Africa has deserved through thee to recover freedom, it were\r\nhard that I should from the same hand lose that freedom which I have\r\never possessed. Control the emotions of anger, oh illustrious\r\nconqueror! The claims urged upon thee by the general voice of the\r\npeople ought to outweigh the offence which the ingratitude of any\r\nprivate individual may have occasioned to thy heart.\"\r\n\r\n'Thus Rome speaks while, through her Senators, she makes supplications\r\nto you. And if that be not enough, let the sacred petition of the\r\nblessed Apostles Peter and Paul be also taken into your account. For\r\nsurely they, who are proved to have so often defended the peace of\r\nRome from her enemies, deserve that your Sovereignty should yield\r\neverything to their merits. The venerable man, our most pious King's\r\nambassador to your Clemency, will further set forth our prayers.'\r\n\r\n[It is not easy to fix the exact occasion on which this petition was\r\nlikely to be sent from the Senate to the Emperor. The allusion to the\r\nconquest of Africa shows that it was after the Vandal War, which ended\r\nin March, 534. On the other hand, the language put into the mouth of\r\nthe Senate implies that the Imperial troops had not yet landed in\r\nItaly or Sicily, and the petition is therefore of an earlier date than\r\nthe summer of 535. During the whole of these fourteen months the\r\nrelations between Empire and Kingdom were more or less strained, the\r\ncauses of complaint on the part of Constantinople beginning with the\r\noccupation of Lilybaeum and ending with the murder of Amalasuentha. I\r\nfear that the nattering portrait drawn of 'the Amal' can apply to no\r\none but Theodahad, the terms used being hopelessly inapplicable to a\r\nboy like Athalaric. Who then are 'our lords' ('nostri Domini'), in\r\nwhose name peace is besought. The best that we can hope, for the sake\r\nof the reputation of Cassiodorus, is that they are Amalasuentha and\r\nTheodahad, the letter being written between October 2, 534 (when\r\nAthalaric died), and April 30, 535 (when Amalasuentha was imprisoned).\r\nUpon the whole this seems the most probable conclusion. If written\r\nafter Amalasuentha's death, in the few months or weeks which\r\nintervened between that event and the landing of Belisarius in Sicily,\r\nthe language employed reflects deep discredit on the writer. In that\r\ncase, 'nostri Domini' must mean Theodahad and Gudelina.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO GAUDIOSUS, CANCELLARIUS OF THE\r\nPROVINCE OF LIGURIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of Como. Relief of its inhabitants.]\r\n\r\n'The City of Como[762] is visited by so many travellers that the\r\ncultivators of the soil declare that they are quite worn out with\r\nrequisitions for post-horses[763]. Wherefore we direct that by Royal\r\nindulgence they be favoured in this matter[764], that this city, so\r\nbeautifully situated, do not become a solitude for want of\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 762: Thus called by Cassiodorus; not Comum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 763: 'Se possessores paraveredorum assiduitate suggerunt\r\nesse fatigatos.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 764: 'Quibus indultu Regali beneficium praecipimus jugiter\r\ncustodiri.' These words do not make it clear how the inhabitants were\r\nrelieved by the Royal decree; but it was probably by some gift of\r\nmoney like that which is announced in the next letter.]\r\n\r\n'Como, with its precipitous mountains and its vast expanse of lake,\r\nseems placed there for the defence of the Province of Liguria; and\r\nyet, again, it is so beautiful that one would think it was created for\r\npleasure only. To the south lies a fertile plain with easy roads for\r\nthe transport of provisions; on the north a lake sixty miles long,\r\nabounding in fish, soothing the mind with delicious recreation.\r\n\r\n'Rightly is it called _Como_, because it is adorned (compta) with such\r\ngifts. The lake lies in a shell-like valley, with white margins. Above\r\nrises a diadem of lofty mountains, their slopes studded with bright\r\nvillas[765], a girdle of olives below, vineyards above, while a crest\r\nof thick chestnut-woods adorns the very summit of the hills. Streams\r\nof snowy clearness dash from the hill-sides into the lake. On the\r\neastern side these unite to form the river Addua, so called because it\r\ncontains the _added_ volume of two streams. It plunges into the lake\r\nwith such force that it keeps its own colour[766] (dark among the\r\nwhiter waters) and its own name far along the northern shore[767], a\r\nphenomenon often seen with rivers flowing into the ocean, but surely\r\nmarvellous with one flowing into an inland lake. And so swift is its\r\ncourse as it moves through the alien waves, that you might fancy it a\r\nriver flowing over the solid plains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 765: 'Praetoriorum luminibus decenter ornata.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 766: So Claudian (De VI Consolata Honorii 196), 'et Addua\r\nvisu caerulus.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 767: 'Ut nomen retinens et colorem in Septentrionem obesiore\r\nalvei ventre generetur.']\r\n\r\n'So delightful a region makes men delicate and averse to labour.\r\nTherefore the inhabitants deserve especial consideration, and for this\r\nreason we wish them to enjoy perpetually the royal bounty.'\r\n\r\n\r\n15. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE LIGURIANS.\r\n\r\n[Announcing the despatch of money to relieve the necessities of the\r\nProvince, possibly after some incursions of the Franks. This would fit\r\nin pretty well with the mention of _Astensis Civitas_ as having\r\nsuffered the most.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relief of the necessities of Liguria.]\r\n\r\n'It is the privilege of a King to increase the happiness of his\r\nsubjects. Not to postpone your joy by too long a preface, I will come\r\nto the point at once, and inform you that our most glorious Lords,\r\ntaking the necessities of their loyal Liguria into account, have sent\r\n100 lbs. of gold [£4,000] by the hands of A and B, officers of the\r\nRoyal Bedchamber. _You_ are to say how the money is to be spent,\r\nindicating the persons who are in the greatest necessity; but as we\r\nare informed that the city of Asti has been more heavily weighted than\r\nothers, it is our wish that it should be chiefly helped by this\r\ndisbursement. Now, do you who are tributaries, reflect upon the\r\nclemency of your lords, who are inverting the usual order of things,\r\nand paying out to you from the Treasury what they are accustomed to\r\nreceive. Let us know at once how much you think each taxpayer ought\r\nto receive, that we may deduct it from his first instalment of\r\nland-tax [768].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 768: 'Sed ut beneficia Dominorum _subtractis exactionum,\r\nincommodis_ augeantur, celerius relatio vestra nos instruat, quid\r\nunicuique de hac summâ relaxandum esse judicetis, ut tantum de _primâ\r\nillatione_ faciamus _suspendi_ quantum ad nos notitia directa\r\nvulgaverit.' The meaning of Cassiodorus seems quite clear, though it\r\nis not easy to understand how far the actual gift of money was\r\nsupplemented by, or independent of, remission of land-tax.]\r\n\r\n'And put up your prayers for your most affectionate Sovereigns, that\r\nthey may receive back again from Heaven the favour which they are\r\nconferring on you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n16. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE LIGURIANS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppressions practised on the Ligurians to be remedied.]\r\n\r\n'In thanking me so earnestly for a recent benefit [probably the\r\npresent mentioned in the preceding letter] you invited me to further\r\nfavours, and the implied promise which I then gave you I now fulfil.\r\n\r\n'You complain that you are burdened with unjust weights and measures,\r\nand I therefore declare that this iniquity shall cease, and that no\r\ntax-collector or tithe-collector[769], shall dare to use too long a\r\nmeasure or too heavy a weight [in the collection of the King's\r\nrevenue].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 769: 'Exactores atque susceptores.' For the latter office,\r\nsee Cod. Theod. xii. 6.]\r\n\r\n'Also that their accounts shall be promptly balanced, and that any\r\novercharge that may be detected shall be at once repaid.\r\n\r\n'Now then, your minds being freed from anxiety on this score, turn\r\nyour attention to the supply of the wants of our most flourishing\r\narmy, and show your zeal for the public good, since we have satisfied\r\nyou that it is not for private and fraudulent gains that you are to\r\npay your contributions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n17. ON THE PROMOTIONS IN THE OFFICIAL STAFF OF THE PRAETORIAN\r\nPRAEFECT, MADE ON CHRISTMAS DAY[770].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 770: This letter was probably addressed to the Princeps, the\r\nhighest person in the whole Officium, as it contains the words '_unus_\r\nquisque ... _tuâ designatione vulgetur_.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotions in Officium of Praefectus Praetorio.]\r\n\r\n'On this day of general rejoicing, when by the kindness of Heaven the\r\nway of salvation was opened to all mankind, we wish that the members\r\nof our staff should also be glad. For to rejoice, ourselves, when\r\nthose around us are mourning, is a kind of sacrilege. Hence some\r\nphilosophers have held that the whole human race is one being, the\r\nvarious members of which are constrained to share one another's\r\nfeelings of joy or sadness. Therefore let every official in our staff\r\naccording to his grade[771] get promotion on this day, not only rising\r\nhimself, but creating a vacancy which enables those below him to rise\r\nalso.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 771: 'Juxta matriculae seriem.']\r\n\r\n[All the Letters from 18 to 35 are documents, for the most part very\r\nshort ones, relating to these promotions.\r\n\r\nFor an explanation of the terms used in these letters, and of the\r\nwhole subject of the staff of the Praetorian Praefect, see chapter iv.\r\nof the Introduction.]\r\n\r\nIn Letter 18, Antianus, who is vacating the office of CORNICULARIUS,\r\nreceives the rank of _Spectabilis_, and has a place assigned him among\r\nthe Tribuni and Notarii, where he may 'adore the presence of his\r\nSovereign[772]'.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 772: 'Inter Tribunos et Notarios ad adorandos aspectus\r\nproperet Principales.']\r\n\r\nIn Letter 19 the successor of Antianus in the office of CORNICULARIUS\r\nreceives his appointment.\r\n\r\nIn Letter 20 the retiring PRIMISCRINIUS also receives the rank of\r\n_Spectabilis_, and takes his place among the Tribuni and Notarii, 'to\r\nadore the Purple of Royalty.'\r\n\r\nIn Letter 21 Andreas is rewarded for his faithful service on the\r\nPraetorian staff[773], by being promoted to the office of\r\nPRIMISCRINIUS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 773: 'Qui Praetorianis fascibus inculpabiliter noscitur\r\nobsecutus.']\r\n\r\nIn Letter 22 Catellus, who stands next in grade for this\r\npromotion[774], obtains the post of SCRINIARIUS ACTORUM.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 774: 'Quem matriculae series fecit accedere.']\r\n\r\nIn Letter 23 Constantinian, to whose virtues Cassiodorus himself bears\r\nwitness, receives the charge of letters relating to the collection of\r\nLand-Tax (CURA EPISTOLARUM CANONICARUM).\r\n\r\nIn Letter 24 Lucillus is appointed a clerk in the War-Office\r\n(SCRINIARIUS CURAE MILITARIS).\r\n\r\nIn Letter 25 Patricius is appointed chief of the shorthand writers\r\n(PRIMICERIUS EXCEPTORUM).\r\n\r\nIn Letter 26 Justus obtains a place as member of the Sixth Schola\r\n(SEXTUS SCHOLARIS[775]).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 775: I am unable to suggest any explanation of this title.]\r\n\r\nIn Letter 27 Joannes, whom we saw in the Sixth Letter of this Book\r\nentrusted with the duties of Cancellarius, is rewarded for his\r\nfaithful discharge of those duties by receiving the place of\r\nPRAEROGATIVARIUS[776].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 776: I have not found any explanation of this title, which\r\nis apparently unknown to the Notitia, to Lydus, and to the Theodosian\r\nCode.]\r\n\r\nIn Letter 28 Cheliodorus[777] is appointed to the place of\r\nCOMMENTARIENSIS (Magistrates' clerk).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 777: Note the corrupt form of the name Heliodorus.]\r\n\r\nIn Letter 29 Cart(h)erius is promoted to the office of REGERENDARIUS\r\n(Secretary of the Post-Office), in the hope that this promotion will\r\nrender him yet more earnest in the discharge of his Praetorian\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nIn Letter 30 Ursus is appointed PRIMICERIUS DEPUTATORUM, and Beatus\r\n(probably the Cancellarius addressed in Letter 10) is made PRIMICERIUS\r\nAUGUSTALIUM.\r\n\r\nIn Letter 31 Urbicus, on vacating the post of PRIMICERIUS\r\nSINGULARIORUM (Chief of the King's Messengers), is placed among the\r\nBody-guards (Domestici et Protectores), where he may adore the Royal\r\nPurple, that, being made illustrious by gazing on the Sovereign, he\r\nmay rejoice in his liberation from official harassment.\r\n\r\n[As the Singularii did not form part of the learned staff (Militia\r\nLitterata), their chief on retiring receives a guardsman's place, but\r\nstill one which gives him access to royalty.]\r\n\r\nIn Letter 32 Pierius receives the post of PRIMICERIUS SINGULARIORUM\r\nwhich is thus vacated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delegatoria.]\r\n\r\nIn Letter 33 Cassiodorus, expanding the proverb 'Bis dat qui cito\r\ndat,' agrees that the _Delegatoria_[778] (or Delegatiorius), the\r\nletter conferring on the receiver the right to receive the increase of\r\nrations due to his promotion, should not be long delayed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 778: We get this sense of Delegatio in Cod. Theod. vii. 4.\r\n35: '_Annonas omnes_, quae universis officiis atque Sacri Palatii\r\nMinisteriis et Sacris Scriniis ceterisque cunctarum adminiculis\r\ndignitatum adsolent _delegari_.']\r\n\r\nIn Letter 34 Antianus, the retired Cornicularius of Letter 18,\r\nreceives a somewhat evasive answer to a petition which apparently\r\naffected the rights of those below him in the official hierarchy[779].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 779: In this letter occurs a sentence of tantalising\r\nobscurity: 'Sola nos Alpha complectitur ubi ea littera non timetur.']\r\n\r\nIn Letter 35 we have an example of the _Delegatoria_ alluded to in\r\nLetter 33. It is concerned with a PRINCEPS, apparently the Princeps of\r\nthe AGENTES IN REBUS; and, after extolling the zeal and alacrity of\r\nthose officers, who are constantly intent on enforcing obedience to\r\nthe Imperial decrees and reverence for the authority of the Praetorian\r\nPraefect, he observes that it would be impiety to delay the reward of\r\nsuch labour.\r\n\r\n'Therefore let your Experience[780] pay, out of the third instalment\r\nof land-tax[781] from such and such a Province, those monies which the\r\nwisdom of Antiquity directed should be paid to the Princeps\r\nAugustorum[782]. Let this be done at once to those who are chargeable\r\non the accounts of the thirteenth Indiction (Sept. 1, 534--Sept. 1,\r\n535). Let there be no venal delays. Behave to the out-going public\r\nservant as you would wish that others should behave to you on your\r\nretirement from office.

Therefore, since the\r\nCornicularius in my Court has completed his term of office, you are to\r\npay him without any deduction this 1st September 700 solidi (£420)\r\nfrom the revenues of the Province of Samnium, taking them out of the\r\nthird instalment of land-tax[784].

While the scribe was\r\nlaboriously cutting his letters on the sordid material, his very\r\nthought grew cold: a rude contrivance assuredly, and only fit for the\r\nbeginnings of the world.\r\n\r\n'Then was paper discovered, and therewith was eloquence made possible.\r\nPaper, so smooth and so continuous, the snowy entrails of a green\r\nherb; paper which can be spread out to such a vast extent, and yet be\r\nfolded up into such a little space; paper, on whose white expanse the\r\nblack characters look beautiful; paper which keeps the sweet harvest\r\nof the mind, and restores it to the reader whenever he chooses to\r\nconsult it; paper which is the faithful witness of all human actions,\r\neloquent of the past, a sworn foe to oblivion.\r\n\r\n'Therefore for this thirteenth Indiction[793] pay so many solidi from\r\nthe land-tax of the Tuscan Province to our Bureau, that it may be able\r\nto keep in perpetuity a faithful record of all its transactions.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 793: Sept. 1, 534. The reading 'de tertiae decimae\r\nIndictionis rationibus' seems required by the sense, instead of\r\n'tertiam de decimae Indictionis rationibus.' It is quite clear that\r\nCassiodorus was not Praetorian Praefect at the tenth Indiction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE CLARISSIMUS VITALIAN,\r\nCANCELLARIUS OF LUCANIA AND BRUTTII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Payment by Province of Bruttii of commuted cattle-tax.]\r\n\r\n'The vast numbers of the Roman people in old time are evidenced by the\r\nextensive Provinces from which their food supply was drawn, as well as\r\nby the wide circuit of their walls, the massive structure of their\r\namphitheatre, the marvellous bigness of their public baths, and the\r\nenormous multitude of mills, which could only have been made for use,\r\nnot for ornament.\r\n\r\n'It was to feed this population, that mountainous Lucania paid her\r\ntribute of swine, that fertile Bruttii furnished her droves of oxen.\r\nIt was a glorious privilege for them thus to feed the Roman people:\r\nyet the length of roads over which the animals had to be driven made\r\nthe tribute unnecessarily burdensome, since every mile reduced their\r\nweight, and the herdsman could not possibly obtain credit at the\r\njourney's end for the same number of pounds of flesh which he\r\npossessed at its beginning. For this reason the tribute was commuted\r\ninto a money payment, one which no journeyings can diminish and no\r\ntoil can wound. The Provinces should understand and respond to this\r\nfavourable change, and not show themselves more slack than their\r\nancestors were, under far more burdensome conditions. Your Diligence\r\nhas now collected both these taxes[794] at the appointed periods; and\r\nI am glad of it, that my countrymen, who have served alien\r\nmagistrates with praiseworthy diligence, might not seem negligent\r\nunder my rule. These Provinces, which I, my grandfather, and my\r\ngreat-grandfather have benefited as private persons, I have\r\nendeavoured to help yet more earnestly while I bore the majesty of the\r\n_fasces_, that they who have rejoiced in my exaltation might see that\r\nI still retained my love for our common country. Let them pay the tax\r\nthen, not from fear but from love. I have prevailed on the royal\r\ngenerosity to limit its amount; for whereas it used to be 1,200 solidi\r\n[£720] annually, it is henceforward to be 1,000 [£600][795].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 794: 'Ambos titulos.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 795: This sum seems ridiculously small for the Province of\r\nBruttii. Can it be the sum assessed on each district?]\r\n\r\n\r\n40. AN INDULGENCE [OR AMNESTY TO PRISONERS ON SOME GREAT FESTIVAL OF\r\nTHE CHURCH, PROBABLY EASTER].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Amnesty.]\r\n\r\n'All the year we are bound to tread in the path of Justice, but on\r\nthis day we secure our approach to the Redeemer by the path of\r\nForgiveness. Therefore we forswear punishments of all kinds, we\r\ncondemn the torture, and thus feel ourselves, in forgiving, to be more\r\ntruly than ever a Judge.\r\n\r\n'Hail to thee, O Clemency[796], patroness of the human race! thou\r\nreignest in the heavens and on the earth: and most fitting is it that,\r\nat sacred seasons like this, thou shouldest be supreme.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 796: 'Indulgentia.']\r\n\r\n'Therefore, O Lictor, thou who art allowed to do with impunity the\r\nvery thing for which other men are punished, put up thy axe; let it be\r\nhenceforth bright, not bloody. Let the chains which have been so often\r\nwet with tears now grow rusty. The prison--that house of Pluto, in\r\nwhich men suffer a living death, from its foul odours, from the sound\r\nof groaning which assails their ears, from the long fastings which\r\ndestroy their taste, from the heavy weights which weary their hands,\r\nfrom the endless darkness which makes their eyes grow dim--let the\r\nprison now be filled with emptiness. Never is it so popular as when it\r\nis seen to be deserted.\r\n\r\n'And you, its denizens, who are thus in a manner transplanted to\r\nHeaven from Hell, avoid the evil courses which made you acquainted\r\nwith its horrors. Even animals shun the things which they have once\r\nfound harmful. Cattle which have once fallen into a pit seek not again\r\nthe same road. The bird once snared shuns bird-lime. The pike buries\r\nhimself in deep sand, that he may escape the drag-net, and when it has\r\nscraped his back leaps nimbly into the waves and expresses by his\r\ngambols his joy for his deliverance. When the wrasse[797] finds that\r\nhe is caught in an osier trap, he moves himself slowly backwards till\r\nhe can leave his tail protruding, that one of his fellows, perceiving\r\nhis capture, may pull him out from his prison.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 797: 'Scarus.']\r\n\r\n'So too the Sauri (?), a clever race of fish, named from their speed,\r\nwhen they have swum into a net, tie themselves together into a sort of\r\nrope; and then, tugging backwards with all their might, seek to\r\nliberate their fellow-prisoners.\r\n\r\n'Many facts of the same kind would be discovered on enquiry. But my\r\ndiscourse must return to thee, O Gaoler. Thou wilt be miserable in the\r\ngeneral joy, because thou art wont to derive thy gladness from the\r\naffliction of many. But as some consolation for thy groans, we leave\r\nto thee those prisoners whom the Law, for very pity's sake, cannot set\r\nfree--the men found guilty of outrageous crimes, whose liberation\r\nwould make barbarous deeds frequent. Over these thou mayest still\r\nexert thy power.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING TWENTY-EIGHT LETTERS WRITTEN BY CASSIODORUS IN HIS OWN NAME\r\nAS PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE VARIOUS CANCELLARII OF THE\r\nSEVERAL PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General instructions to the Cancellarii.]\r\n\r\n'It is generally supposed that long attendance at the Courts of Law\r\nincreases the love of justice. The character of the Judge also is in\r\nsome degree estimated by that of his officers[798], as that of a\r\nphilosophical teacher by his disciples. Thus your bad actions might\r\nendanger our reputation, while, on the other hand, with no effort on\r\nour part, we earn glory from all that you do well. Beware, therefore,\r\nlest by any misconduct of yours, which is sure to be exaggerated by\r\npopular rumour, you rouse anger in us, who as your Judge will be sure\r\nto exact stern recompence for all the wrong you have done to our\r\nreputation. Study this rather, that you may receive praise and\r\npromotion at our hands, and go forth, with Divine help, on this\r\nIndiction, to such and such a Province, adorned with the pomp of the\r\nCancelli, and girt about with a certain proud gravity. Remember the\r\nhonour of the _fasces_ which are borne before you, of the Praetorian\r\nseat whose commands you execute.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 798: 'Per milites suos judex intelligitur.']\r\n\r\n'Fly Avarice, the Queen of all the vices, who never enters the human\r\nheart alone, but always brings a flattering and deceiving train along\r\nwith her. Show yourself zealous for the public good; do more by reason\r\nthan by terror. Let your person be a refuge for the oppressed, a\r\ndefence of the weak, a stronghold for him who is stricken down by any\r\ncalamity. Never do you more truly discharge the functions of the\r\nCancelli than when you open the prison doors to those who have been\r\nunjustly confined.'\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO ALL THE JUDGES OF THE PROVINCES\r\n(A.D. 534-535).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General instructions to the Provincial Governors.]\r\n\r\n'God be thanked, the Provincials have attended to all my admonitions,\r\nand I have kept all my promises to them. You, as Judges, have\r\nadmirably copied my own freedom from corruption, and I can only desire\r\nthat you will go on as you have begun.\r\n\r\n'Let the peasant pay cheerfully his share of the public taxes, and I\r\non my part will guarantee him the administration of justice in the\r\ncourts[799].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 799: 'Possessor mihi publicas pecunias libens inferat: ego\r\nilli in conventus justitiae tributa persolvam.']\r\n\r\n'It was evidently the intention of the legislators that you should be\r\nimitators of our dignity, since they have given you almost the same\r\njurisdiction in the Provinces as ourselves.\r\n\r\n'What avails the reputation of being a rich man? It confers no glory.\r\nBut to be known as a just man wins the praise of all. Nothing mean or\r\navaricious is becoming in a Judge. All his faults are made more\r\nconspicuous by his elevation. Better were it to be absolutely unknown,\r\nthan to be marked out for the scorn of all men. Let us keep our own\r\nbrews clear from shame; then can we rebuke the sins of others. A\r\nterrible leveller is iniquity: it makes the Judge himself feel like\r\nthe culprit who is tried before him. All these considerations,\r\naccording to my custom, I bring before you in this my yearly address,\r\nsince it is impossible ever to have too much of a good thing[800].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 800:'Haec nos annuo sermone convenit loqui: quia bonarum\r\nrerum nulla satietas est.']\r\n\r\n'Now, to proceed to business. Do you and your official staff impress\r\nupon all the cultivators of the soil the absolute necessity of their\r\npaying their land-tax[801] for this thirteenth Indiction[802] at the\r\nappointed time. Let there be no pressing them to pay before the time,\r\nand no venal connivance at their postponement of payment after the\r\ntime. What kindness is there in delay? The money must be paid, sooner\r\nor later.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 801: 'Trina Illatio.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 802: Sept. 1, 534, to Sept. 1, 535.]\r\n\r\n'Prepare also a full and faithful statement of the expenditure for\r\nevery four months[803], and address it to our bureaux[804], that there\r\nmay be perfect clearness in the public accounts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 803: 'Expensarum fidelem notitiam quaternis mensibus\r\ncomprehensam.' As the receipts of the _Trina Illatio_ had to be\r\ngathered in every four months, the account of Provincial expenditure\r\ncovered the same period.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 804: 'Ad scrinia nostra dirigere maturabis.']\r\n\r\n'In order to help you, we send A and B, members of our official staff,\r\nto examine your accounts. See that you come up to the standard of duty\r\nhere prescribed for you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO ALL THE SAJONES WHO HAVE BEEN\r\nASSIGNED TO THE CANCELLARII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General instructions to the Sajones.]\r\n\r\n'There must be fear of the magistrate in the heart of the citizen,\r\nelse the laws would never be obeyed. But as in medicine various\r\nremedies are required by various constitutions, so in the\r\nadministration of the laws sometimes force and sometimes gentleness\r\nhas to be used. Wisdom is required to decide which is the best mode\r\nof dealing with each particular case.\r\n\r\n'Therefore we despatch your Devotion[805] to attend upon A B,\r\nClarissimus Cancellarius. Be terrible to the lawless, but to them\r\nalone. Above all things see to the punctual collection of the taxes.\r\nDo not study popularity. Attend only to those cases which are\r\nentrusted to your care, and work them thoroughly. No greater disgrace\r\ncan attach to an officer of Court than that a Judge's sentence should\r\nbe left unexecuted[806]. Do not swagger through the streets exulting\r\nin the fact that nobody dares meet you. Brave men are ever gentle in\r\ntime of peace, and there is no greater lover of justice than he who\r\nhas seen many battles. When you return to your parents and friends let\r\nit not be brawls that you have to boast of, but good conduct. We also\r\nshall in that case welcome you back with pleasure, and not leave you\r\nlong without another commission. And the King too, the lord of\r\nall[807], will entrust higher duties to him who returns from the lower\r\nwith credit and the reward of a good conscience.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 805: 'Devotio tua' was the technical way of addressing the\r\n_fortis Sajo_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 806: 'In executore illud est pessimum, si judicis relinquat\r\narbitrium.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 807: 'Rerum Dominus.']\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE CANONICARIUS[808] OF THE\r\nVENETIAE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 808: Revenue-officer.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praise of Acinaticium, a red wine of Verona.]\r\n\r\n'A well furnished royal table is a credit to the State. A private\r\nperson may eat only the produce of his own district; but it is the\r\nglory of a King to collect at his table the delicacies of all lands.\r\nLet the Danube send us her carp, let the _anchorago_ (?) come from the\r\nRhine, let the labour of Sicily furnish the _exormiston_[809], let the\r\nsea of Bruttii send its sweet _acerniae_ (?); in short, let\r\nwell-flavoured dishes be gathered from all coasts. It becomes a King\r\nso to regale himself that he may seem to foreign ambassadors to\r\npossess almost everything.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 809: 'Perhaps a kind of lamprey' (White and Riddle's\r\nLatin-English Dictionary).]\r\n\r\n'And therefore, not to neglect home-produce also, as our fertile Italy\r\nis especially rich in wines, we must have these also provided for the\r\nKing's table. Now the report of the Count of the Patrimony informs us\r\nthat the stock of _Acinaticium_[810] has fallen very low in the royal\r\ncellars. We therefore order you to visit the cultivators of Verona,\r\nand offer them a sufficient price for this product of theirs, which\r\nthey ought to offer without price to their Sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 810: Apparently a kind of raisin wine; from _acina_, a grape\r\nor berry.]\r\n\r\n'It is in truth a noble wine and one that Italy may be proud of.\r\nInglorious Greece may doctor her wines with foreign admixtures, or\r\ndisguise them with perfumes. There is no need of any such process with\r\nthis liquor. It is purple, as becomes the wine of kings. Sweet and\r\nstrong[811], it grows more dense in tasting it, so that you might\r\ndoubt whether it was a liquid food or an edible drink[812].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 811: What are we to make of 'Stipsis nescio quâ firmitate\r\nroboratur?']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 812: 'Tactus ejus densitate pinguescit: ut dicas esse aut\r\ncarneum liquorem aut edibilem potionem.' Questionable praise,\r\naccording to the ideas of a modern wine-grower.]\r\n\r\n'I have a mind to describe the singular mode of manufacturing this\r\nwine. The grape cluster, gathered in autumn, is hung up under the roof\r\nof the house to dry till December. Thus exuding its insipid humours it\r\nbecomes much sweeter. Then in December, when everything else is bound\r\nby the frost of winter, the chilly blood of these grapes is allowed to\r\nflow forth. It is not insultingly trodden down by the feet, nor is any\r\nfoul admixture suffered to pollute it; its stream of gem-like\r\nclearness is drawn forth from it by a noble provocation. It seems to\r\nshed tears of joy, and delights the eye by its beauty as much as the\r\npalate by its flavour. Collect this wine as speedily as possible, pay\r\na sufficient price for it, and hand it over to the _Cartarii_ who are\r\ncharged with this business.\r\n\r\n'And this point is not to be forgotten, that it is to be served up in\r\ngoblets of a milky whiteness. Lilies and roses thus unite their\r\ncharms, and a pleasure is ministered to the eye, far beyond the mere\r\ncommonplace facts that the wine has a pleasant taste, and that it\r\nrestores the strength of the drinker.\r\n\r\n'We rely on you to provide both the wine and the drinking vessels[813]\r\nwith all despatch.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 813: We might have expected to find wine-bottles rather than\r\nwine-glasses thus requisitioned; but I think the words of Cassiodorus,\r\n'quod lacteo poculo relucescit,' oblige us to adopt the latter\r\ntranslation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO VALERIAN, VIR SUBLIMIS.\r\n\r\n[Written probably in the autumn or winter of 535, when Belisarius was\r\nin Sicily threatening the Southern Provinces of Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Measures for relief of Lucania and Bruttii.]\r\n\r\n'The ruler's anxiety for the common good of all over whom he is\r\nplaced, may allowably show itself in an especial manner towards the\r\ndwellers in his own home, and that pre-eminently at a time when they\r\nneed his succour from peril.\r\n\r\n'The numerous army which was destined for the defence of the Republic\r\nis said to have laid waste the cultivated parts of Lucania and\r\nBruttii, and to have diminished the abundance of those regions by its\r\nlove of rapine.\r\n\r\n'Now since they must take and you must give, and since the cultivator\r\nmust not be robbed nor the army starved, know that the prices of\r\nprovisions are fixed by the order of the Lord of the State at a much\r\nlower figure than you have been wont to sell at[814].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 814: 'Pretia quae antiquus ordo constituit ex jussione rerum\r\nDomini cognoscite temperata, ut multo arctius quam vendere solebatis\r\nin assem publicum praebita debeant imputari.']\r\n\r\n'Be not therefore anxious. You have escaped the hands of the\r\ntax-collector. The present instrument takes away from you the\r\nliability to tribute. In order that your knowledge may be made more\r\ncomplete, we have thought it better that the amounts of the provisions\r\nfor which you are held responsible should be expressed in the\r\nbelow-written letters[815], that no one may sell you a benefit which\r\nyou know to be conferred by the public generosity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 815: 'Sed quo facilius instrueretur vestra notitia,\r\n_imputationum summas infra scriptis brevibus credidimus exprimendas._'\r\nApparently the ordinary taxes for the two Provinces are remitted, but\r\na certain quantity of provisions has to be furnished to the army,\r\nperhaps by each township; and besides this, the commissariat officers\r\nhave a right of pre-emption at prices considerably below the market\r\nrate.]\r\n\r\n'Repress, therefore, the unruly movements of the cultivators[816].\r\nWhile the Gothic army is fighting, let the Roman peasant enjoy in\r\nquiet the peace for which he sighs. According to the King's command,\r\nadmonish the several tenants on the farms, and the better sort of\r\npeasants, not to mingle in the barbarism of the strife, lest the\r\ndanger to public tranquillity be greater than any service they can\r\nrender in the wars[817]. Let them lay hands to the iron, but only to\r\ncultivate their fields; let them grasp the pointed steel, but only to\r\ngoad their oxen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 816: 'Continete ergo possessorum intemperantes motus.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 817: 'Ex Regiâ jussione singulos conductores massarum et\r\npossessores validos admonete, ut nullam contrahant in concertatione\r\nbarbariem: ne non tantum festinent bellis prodesse quantum quiete\r\nconfundere.' Evidently the rustics are dissuaded from taking up arms\r\nlest they should use them on the side of Belisarius.]\r\n\r\n'Let the Judges be active: let the tribunals echo with their\r\ndenunciations of crime. Let the robber, the adulterer, the forger, the\r\nthief, find that the arm of the State is still strong to punish their\r\ncrimes. True freedom rejoices when these men are made sad. Here, in\r\nthis civil battle, is full scope for your energies: attend to this,\r\nand enjoy the thought that others are fighting the battle with the\r\nforeign foe for you.\r\n\r\n'Exercise great care in calculating the rations of the soldiers, that\r\nno trickery may succeed in defrauding the soldier of his due.\r\n\r\n'The officers of the army are by the rulers of the State placed under\r\nmy authority, and you are therefore to admonish them if they go wrong,\r\nwhile redressing all their real grievances. They, in their turn, must\r\nuphold discipline, which is the most powerful weapon of an army. Rise\r\nto the dignity of the occasion, and show that you are able to govern a\r\nProvince in a disturbed condition of public affairs, since anyone can\r\ngovern it while all things are quiet.\r\n\r\n'The royal household is specially ordered to pay the same obedience to\r\nthis rescript as all the rest of the Province; and as for my own\r\ndependants, I say expressly that, though I wish them well, I ask for\r\nno favour for them which I would not grant to all the other\r\ninhabitants of the Province.'\r\n\r\n\r\n6. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO ALL THE SUBORDINATE GOVERNORS OF\r\nTHE PRAEFECTURE[818].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 818: 'Universis Praefecturae titulos administrantibus.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General instructions to subordinate Governors.]\r\n\r\n'The exhortations addressed to you by the inborn piety of our Lords\r\nought to suffice; but nevertheless, that we may be doubly assured, we\r\nwill address to you our threats against all who shall wield their\r\npower unrighteously. Cease from avarice, from arrogance, from\r\nvenality. What will your money avail you when the day of inquisition\r\ncomes? _We_ shall not be tempted by it. Let it be clearly understood\r\nthat we shall not sell pardons to unjust Judges, but shall hunt them\r\nto their ruin.\r\n\r\n'But all you, good and honest rulers, continue to serve the State\r\nwithout fear. No rival will buy your offices over your heads; you are\r\nsecure in your seats so long as you do well, until the time fixed by\r\nour Lords expires.

On\r\nthis ground, and on account of the incursions of the Suevi, the King\r\ngrants for this year, the fifteenth Indiction[820], a discharge of all\r\nclaims by the Fiscus preferred against A and B. And in all similar\r\ncases where you shall be satisfied that the property has really been\r\nlaid waste by those Barbarians, you are at liberty to remit the taxes\r\nfor this Indiction. Afterwards you will use all the ordinary methods,\r\nin order that you may be able to pay over the stipulated sum to the\r\nRoyal Treasurer. But meanwhile the poor cultivator has the best of all\r\narguments against paying you, namely, that he has nothing left him\r\nwherewith to pay. Thus is his calamity his best voucher for\r\npayment[821]; and we do not wish that he who has been already alarmed\r\nby the arms of the robber should further tremble at the official robe\r\nof the civil servant[822].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 820: Sept. 1, 536, to Sept. 1, 537.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 821: 'Validas contra te apochas invenerunt.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 822: 'Chlamydes non pavescant, qui arma timuerunt.']\r\n\r\n\r\n8.

We are willing to grant this request, on condition\r\nthat the Fiscus does not suffer thereby; and therefore desire your\r\nRespectability to warn all _Curiales_, _Compulsores_, and all other\r\npersons concerned, to remove for this Indiction every kind of legal\r\nprocess from the before-mentioned properties; the condition of this\r\nimmunity being that he shall, before the kalends of such and such a\r\nmonth produce the receipts[824] of the _Arcarius_, showing that he has\r\ndischarged his debt to the State. Otherwise the debt must be exacted\r\nby ordinary process. But it is delightful to us whenever the tax is\r\npaid without calling in the aid of the _Compulsor_. Would that the\r\npeasant would always thus freely anticipate the needs of the\r\nTreasury!'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 823: 'Arcarii.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 824: 'Apochae.']\r\n\r\n\r\n9.

By 'African,' no doubt, we must understand one of the\r\nindigenous inhabitants of Africa, perhaps a man of Negro race. The\r\ncustom certainly cannot have applied to African Provincials of Roman\r\ndescent. It was perhaps based on some old tribal notions of joint\r\npossession and mutual inheritance.]\r\n\r\n'It is a work of wondrous kindness to oblige a foreign race with\r\npublic benefits, and not only to invite blood relations to enjoy the\r\nadvantages of property, but to permit even strangers to share them.\r\nThis kind of heirship is independent of the ties of kindred,\r\nindependent of succession from parents, and requires nothing else\r\nsave only power to utter the speech of the fatherland.\r\n\r\n'This is the privilege which, as the African asserts, was of old\r\nbestowed on his race. By virtue thereof they lawfully demand the\r\ninheritance of others, and thus obtain a right which the Roman in a\r\nsimilar case could never claim. Nor have they this benefit in their\r\nown land; but here they are for this purpose looked upon as all\r\nrelated to one another.\r\n\r\n'The whole nation, in what relates to the advantages of succession, is\r\nregarded as one family.\r\n\r\n'Your Experience is therefore to submit the subject of this man's\r\npetition to a diligent examination, and if it shall turn out, as he\r\nalleges, that the deceased has left no sons nor other persons who\r\nmight reasonably claim to succeed him, your official staff is to\r\ninduct him into the aforesaid property according to the established\r\nusage.\r\n\r\n'He will thus cease to be a foreigner, and will acquire the status of\r\na native possessor, and therewith the usual liability to pay tribute.\r\nHe is inferior to other owners only in this one point, that he lacks\r\nthe power of alienating his property. Let him who has derived so much\r\nbenefit from our commiseration now relieve others. Fortunate and\r\nenviable has turned out his captivity[826], which enables him at one\r\nand the same time to enjoy the citizenship of Rome and the privileges\r\nof the African.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 826: 'Felix illi contigit et praedicanda captivitas.' A\r\nlittle before, we read, 'Resumat facultatem quam se suspiraverat\r\namississe.' These sentences suggest the idea that the petitioner had\r\nbeen brought over in the train of the lately deceased person as a\r\nslave. This a little lessens the difficulty of his being admitted to\r\nthe inheritance. Compare Gen. xv. 3, where Abraham, before the birth\r\nof a son, says, 'And one born in my house' (i.e. a slave) 'is mine\r\nheir.']\r\n\r\n\r\n10. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO DIVERS CANCELLARII IN THE\r\nPROVINCES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taxes to be punctually enforced.]\r\n\r\n'Arrears of tribute are like bodily diseases, serious and enfeebling\r\nwhen they become chronic. A man who is under a load of debt cannot be\r\ncalled free: he has abandoned the power of controlling his actions to\r\nanother. Your supposed indulgence to the taxpayer is no real kindness.\r\nThere comes a time when the whole arrear of debt has to be claimed,\r\nand then these venal delays of yours make the demand seem twice as\r\nheavy in the eyes of the unfortunate taxpayer. Cease then to trade\r\nupon the peasants' losses. Exact the whole amount of taxes for the\r\ncoming Indiction, and pay them in on the appointed day to the\r\nTreasurer[827] of the Province; or else it will be the worse for you,\r\nand you will have to return, stripped of all official rank[828], into\r\nthe Province which you are conscious of having badly administered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 827: 'Arcarius.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 828: 'Degeniatus.']\r\n\r\n'I shall not _speak_ again on this subject, but shall, if necessary,\r\nextract the sums from you by an irrevocable act of distraint.'\r\n\r\n\r\n11.

Even\r\nmolten gold contracts a stain if not poured into an absolutely clean\r\nvessel. How sweet is it to see a stream flowing clear and unpolluted\r\nover a snow-white channel! Even so must you see that the gifts of the\r\nSovereign of the State reach the Roman people as pure and as copious\r\nas they issue forth from him.\r\n\r\n'All fraud is hateful; but fraud exercised upon the people of Romulus\r\nis absolutely unbearable. That quiet and easily satisfied people,\r\nwhose existence you might forget except when they testify their\r\nhappiness by their shouts; noisy without a thought of sedition; whose\r\nonly care is to shun poverty without amassing wealth; lowly in fortune\r\nbut rich in temper--it is a kind of profanation to rob such people as\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n'We therefore entrust to you the task of distributing the\r\nrelishes[830] to the Roman people from this Indiction. Be true to the\r\ncitizens, else you will become as an alien unto us. Do not be bribed\r\ninto allowing anyone to pass as a Latin who was not born in Latium.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 830: 'Obsonia.']\r\n\r\n'These privileges belong to the Quirites alone: no slave must be\r\nadmitted to share them.

Mount Sila is a range of hills in Calabria\r\nimmediately to the north of Squillace, forty miles from north to\r\nsouth, and twenty miles from east to west, and occupying the whole of\r\nthe projecting portion of the south-east side of Italy between the\r\nGulf of Squillace and the Bay of Taranto. The highest peaks, which are\r\nabout 5,700 feet high, are covered with snow during half the year. It\r\nis said that from the beginning of June till far on into October,\r\n15,000 head of cattle and 150,000 sheep, besides horses and mules,\r\ngraze in these uplands. (See Gael-Fells: Unter Italien, p. 721.)]\r\n\r\n'The _cheese_, which retains in its pores the milk which has been\r\ncollected there, recalls by its taste the fragrant herbs upon which\r\nthe cattle have fed; by its texture it reminds us of the softness of\r\noil, from which it differs in colour by its snowy whiteness. Having\r\nbeen carefully pressed into a wide cask and hardened therein, it\r\nretains permanently the beautiful round shape which has thus been\r\ngiven to it[833].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 833: From the description of Cassiodorus, it seems to have\r\nbeen a kind of cream cheese.]\r\n\r\n'The _wine_, to which Antiquity gave the name of praise, Palmatiana,\r\nmust be selected not of a rough but sweet kind[834]. Though last [in\r\ngeographical position] among the wines of Bruttii, it is by general\r\nopinion accounted the best, equal to that of Gaza, similar to the\r\nSabine, moderately thick, strong, brisk, of conspicuous whiteness,\r\ndistinguished by the fine aroma, of which a pleasant after-taste is\r\nperceived by the drinker[835]. It constrains loosened bowels, dries up\r\nmoist wounds, and refreshes the weary breast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 834: 'Non stipsi asperum sed gratum suavitate perquire.' The\r\nsame peculiar word, _stipsis_, which we had in Letter xii. 4. What\r\nmeaning are we to assign to the word?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 835: 'Magnis odoribus singulare:--quod ita redolet ore\r\nructatum ut merito illi a palma nomen videatur impositum.']\r\n\r\n'Let it be your care to provide as speedily as possible a stock of\r\nboth these products of our country, and send them in ships to the\r\nRoyal residence. For a temporary supply we have drawn on our own\r\ncellars, but we look to you to choose specimens of the genuine quality\r\nfor the King. We cannot be deceived, who retain the true taste in our\r\npatriotic memory; and at your peril will you provide any inferior\r\narticle to that which our cellars will have supplied[836].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 836: Baronius (Ad Ann. 591) quotes this letter of\r\nCassiodorus to explain an allusion in the life of Pope Gregory the\r\nGreat, who refused to receive a present of 'Palmatiana' from the\r\nBishop of Messina, and insisted on paying for it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. AN EDICT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frauds committed by the revenue officers on the Churches of\r\nBruttii and Lucania.]\r\n\r\n'The generous gifts of Kings ought to be respected by their subjects.\r\n\r\n'Long ago the constitutions of the Emperors enriched the holy\r\nChurches of Bruttii and Lucania with certain gifts. But since the\r\nsacrilegious mind is not afraid of sinning against the Divine\r\nreverence, the Canonicarii (officers of the Exchequer) have robbed\r\nthese ecclesiastical positions of a certain portion of their revenue\r\nin the name of the Numerarii of the Praetorian Praefect's staff; but\r\nthese latter, with righteous indignation, declare that they have\r\nreceived no part of the spoils thus impiously collected in their name.\r\n\r\n'Thus have the Canonicarii turned the property of the clergy into a\r\n_douceur_ for the laity[837]. Oh, audacity of man! what barriers can\r\nbe erected against thee? Thou mightest have hoped to escape human\r\nobservation, but why commit crimes which the Divinity cannot but\r\nnotice?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 837: 'Facientes laicum commodum substantiam clericorum.']\r\n\r\n'Therefore we ordain by this edict that anyone who shall hereafter\r\ncommit this kind of fraud shall lose his own private gains, and shall\r\nforfeit his place in the public service[838].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 838: 'Edictali programmate definimus, ut qui in hac fuerit\r\nulterius fraude versatus et militiâ careat et compendium propriae\r\nfacultatis amittat.' The last clause is perhaps purposely vague. We\r\nshould have expected to hear something about restitution, but the\r\nwords will not bear that meaning.]\r\n\r\n'Let the poor keep the gifts which God has put it into the heart of\r\nKings to bestow upon them. It is cruel above all other cruelty to wish\r\nto become rich by means of the scanty possessions of the mendicant.'\r\n\r\n\r\n14. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO ANASTASIUS, CANCELLARIUS OF\r\nLUCANIA AND BRUTTII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plea for gentle treatment for citizens of Rhegium.]\r\n\r\n'The citizens of Rhegium (so called from the Greek word [Greek:\r\nrhêgnumi], to break, because their island has been broken off from\r\nSicily by the violence of the waves) complain that they are being\r\nunfairly harassed by the tax-gatherers. I, as an eyewitness, can\r\nconfirm the truth of their statement that their territory does not\r\nbring forth the produce which is claimed at their hands. It is a rocky\r\nand mountainous country, too dry for pasture, though sufficiently\r\nundulating for vineyards; bad for grain-crops, though well suited for\r\nolives. The shade has to be all provided by the industry of man, who\r\nhas planted there the tree of Pallas [the olive], which prospers in\r\neven the driest soil, because it sends its roots down into the very\r\ndepths of the earth.\r\n\r\n'The corn has to be watered by hand, like pot-herbs in a garden. You\r\nseldom see the husbandman bending beneath his load as he returns from\r\nthe threshing-floor. A few bushels full are all that he can boast of,\r\neven in an abundant harvest[839].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 839: I do not understand the following sentences: 'In hortis\r\nautem rusticorum agmen habetur operosum: quia olus illic omne saporum\r\nest marinâ irroratione respersum. Quod humanâ industriâ fieri\r\nconsuevit, hoc cum nutriretur accepit.' Can they have watered any\r\nherbs with salt water?]\r\n\r\n'Contrary to the opinion of Virgil [who speaks of the bitter roots of\r\nthe endive[840]], the fibres of endive are here extremely sweet, and\r\nencircled by their twisting leaves are caked together with a certain\r\ncallous tenderness[841].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 840:\r\n\r\n    'Nec tamen, haec quum sint hominumque boumque labores\r\n    Versando terram experti, nihil improbus anser,\r\n    Strymoniaeque grues, et _amaris intuba fibris_\r\n    Officiunt.'--Georgic i. 118-121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 841: I must renounce the attempt to translate the rest of\r\nthe sentence: 'Unde in morem nitri aliquid decerptum frangitur, dum a\r\nfecundo cespite segregatur.' There is an alternative reading, _vitri_\r\nfor _nitri_; but I am still unable to understand the author's\r\nmeaning.]\r\n\r\n'In the treasures of the deep that region is certainly rich; for the\r\nUpper and Lower Sea meet there. The _exormiston_[842], a sort of king\r\namong fishes, with bristly nostrils and a milky delicacy of flavour,\r\nis found in these waters. In stormy weather it is tossed about on the\r\ntop of the waves, and seems to be too tired or too indolent to seek a\r\nrefuge in the deeper water[843]. No other fish can be compared to it\r\nin sweetness[844].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 842: Apparently a kind of lamprey. See the fourth letter of\r\nthis book.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 843: Perhaps Cassiodorus means to say this makes it more\r\neasy of capture, but he does not say so.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 844: The praises of the exormiston are not only foreign to\r\nthe main subject of the letter, but to a certain extent weaken the\r\nwriter's argument on behalf of his countrymen; but, as a good\r\nBruttian, he cannot help vaunting the products of his country.]\r\n\r\n'These are the products--I speak from my own knowledge--of the Rhegian\r\nshore. Therefore you must not seek to levy a tribute of wheat or lard\r\nfrom the inhabitants under the name of \"coemptio.\"\r\n\r\n'I may add that they are so troubled by the constant passage of\r\ntravellers entering Italy or leaving it, that it would have been right\r\nto excuse them even if those products had been found there in\r\nabundance[845].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 845: The passage to and fro of travellers no doubt brought\r\nwith it burdensome duties for the inhabitants in connection with the\r\n_Cursus Publicus_. It was therefore a reason for mitigating other\r\ntaxes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO MAXIMUS, VIR CLARISSIMUS,\r\nCANCELLARIUS OF LUCANIA AND BRUTTII[846].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 846: This letter, being the description by Cassiodorus of\r\nhis native place, is translated entire.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Praises of the author's birthplace, Scyllacium.]\r\n\r\n'Scyllacium, the first city of Bruttii, which Ulysses the destroyer of\r\nTroy is believed to have founded, is said to be unreasonably vexed by\r\nthe exorbitant demands of purveyors[847]. These injuries grieve us all\r\nthe more on account of our patriotic love for the place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 847: 'Irrationabiliter dicitur praesumentium nimietate\r\nvexari.']\r\n\r\n'The city of Scyllacium, which is so placed as to look down upon the\r\nHadriatic Gulf, hangs upon the hills like a cluster of grapes: not\r\nthat it may pride itself upon their difficult ascent, but that it may\r\nvoluptuously gaze on verdant plains and the blue back of the sea. The\r\ncity beholds the rising sun from its very cradle, when the day that is\r\nabout to be born sends forward no heralding Aurora; but as soon as it\r\nbegins to rise, the quivering brightness displays its torch. It\r\nbeholds Phoebus in his joy; it is bathed in the brightness of that\r\nluminary, so that it might be thought to be itself the native land of\r\nthe sun, the claims of Rhodes to that honour being outdone.\r\n\r\n'It enjoys a translucent air, but withal so temperate that its winters\r\nare sunny, and its summers cool; and life passes there without sorrow,\r\nsince hostile seasons are feared by none. Hence, too, man himself is\r\nhere freer of soul than elsewhere, for this temperateness of the\r\nclimate prevails in all things.\r\n\r\n'In sooth, a hot fatherland makes its children sharp and fickle, a\r\ncold one slow and sly; it is only a temperate climate which composes\r\nthe characters of men by its own moderation. Hence was it that the\r\nancients pronounced Athens to be the seat of sages, because, enriched\r\nwith an air of the greatest purity, it prepared with glad liberality\r\nthe lucid intellects of its sons for the contemplative part of life.\r\nAssuredly for the body to imbibe muddy waters is a different thing\r\nfrom sucking in the transparency of a sweet fountain. Even so the\r\nvigour of the mind is repressed when it is clogged by a heavy\r\natmosphere. Nature herself hath made us subject to these influences.\r\nClouds make us feel sad; and again a bright sky fills us with joy,\r\nbecause the heavenly substance of the soul delights in everything that\r\nis unstained and pure.\r\n\r\n'Scyllacium has also an abundant share of the delicacies of the sea,\r\npossessing near it those gates of Neptune which we ourselves\r\nconstructed. At the foot of the Moscian Mount we hollowed out the\r\nbowels of the rock, and tastefully[848] introduced therein the eddying\r\nwaves of Nereus. Here a troop of fishes, sporting in free captivity,\r\nrefreshes all minds with delight, and charms all eyes with admiration.\r\nThey run greedily to the hand of man, and before they become his food\r\nseek dainties from him. Man feeds his own dainty morsels, and while he\r\nhas that which can bring them into his power, it often happens that\r\nbeing already replete he lets them all go again.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 848: 'Decenter.']\r\n\r\n'The spectacle moreover of men engaged in honourable labour is not\r\ndenied to those who are sitting tranquilly in the city. Plenteous\r\nvineyards are beheld in abundance. The fruitful toil of the\r\nthreshing-floor is seen. The face of the green olive is disclosed. No\r\none need sigh for the pleasures of the country, when it is given him\r\nto see them all from the town.\r\n\r\n'And inasmuch as it has now no walls, you believe Scyllacium to be a\r\nrural city, though you might judge it to be an urban villa; and thus\r\nplaced between the two worlds of town and country, it is lavishly\r\npraised by both.\r\n\r\n'This place wayfarers desire frequently to visit, and as they object\r\nto the toil of walking, the citizens, called upon to provide them with\r\npost-horses, and rations for their servants, have to pay heavily in\r\npurse for the pleasantness of their city. Therefore to prevent this,\r\nfor the future we decide that all charges for providing post-horses\r\nand rations shall be debited to the public account. We cut up, root\r\nand branch, the system of paying _Pulveratica_[849] to the Judge; and\r\nwe decide, according to ancient custom, that rations for three days\r\nonly shall be given on their arrival to the great Dignitaries of the\r\nState, and that any more prolonged delay in their locomotion be\r\nprovided for by themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 849: Dust-money.]\r\n\r\n'To relieve your city of its heaviest burdens will be, according to\r\nour injunctions, an act of judicial impartiality, not of laxity. Live,\r\nby God's help, a mirror of the justice of the age, delighting in the\r\nsecurity of all. Some people call the Isles of the Atlantic\r\n'Fortunate:' I would rather give that name to the place where you do\r\nnow dwell.'\r\n\r\n\r\n16.

Let none exceed the fair weight, but let him use a\r\njust pound: if once the true weight is allowed to be exceeded, there\r\nis no limit to extortion[853].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 851: 'Dum res nobis etiam asperas captatâ semper opinione\r\nconciliat.'

The joining of its\r\nplanks gives the desired appearance of solidity; all the terror of the\r\nwaves is removed by its likeness to the land, and the traveller\r\npassing over it unharmed only wishes that the bridge were longer.\r\n\r\n'Let a safe bulwark of lattice-work shield the bridge on the right\r\nside and on the left. See that you give no cause for misadventure of\r\nany kind. You have a noble opportunity of distinguishing yourself in\r\nthe presence of so many Senators and of the King himself, the rewarder\r\nof every well-done work. On the other hand, if you do it badly and put\r\nhim out of humour, woe be unto you!\r\n\r\n'We send A B, a servant of our Praefecture[861], to assist you and\r\nyour staff and bring us report of the accomplishment of the work; for\r\nso heavy is our responsibility in this matter that we dare not leave\r\nanything to chance.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 861: 'Illum sedis nostrae militem.']\r\n\r\n[The King whose advent to Rome is here announced may be Witigis, after\r\nhis election in the plains of Regeta (August, 536). But the fact that\r\nhe is apparently approaching Rome by the northern bank of the Tiber,\r\ncoupled with the directions in the preceding letter for the repair of\r\nthe Flaminian Way, makes it more probable that some visit of Theodahad\r\n(probably in the year 535), when he would come from Ravenna to Rome,\r\nis here in prospect.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THOMAS AND PETER, VIRI CLARISSIMI\r\nAND ARCARII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sacred vessels mortgaged by Pope Agapetus to be restored to\r\nthe stewards of the Papal See.]\r\n\r\n'You will remember, most faithful Sirs, that when the holy Agapetus,\r\nPope of the City of Rome, was sent as ambassador to the Sovereign of\r\nthe East[862], he received so many pounds of gold from you for the\r\nexpenses of the journey, for which he gave his bond[863] and deposited\r\nsome of the Church plate as security[864]. The provident ruler thus\r\nlent him money in his necessity, and now, far more gloriously, returns\r\nas a free gift those pledges which the Pope might well have thanked\r\nhim for taking.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 862: He was sent by Theodahad; entered Constantinople\r\nFebruary 20, 536, and died there 21st April of the same year.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 863: 'Facto pictacio.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 864: 'Vasa sanctorum.' One would think this must refer to\r\nthe vessels used in celebrating mass; but I do not quite see how the\r\nmeaning is to be got out of the words.]\r\n\r\n'Therefore, in obedience to these instructions of ours, and fortified\r\nby the Royal order, do you return without any delay to the\r\nstewards[865] of the holy Apostle Peter the vessels of the saints\r\ntogether with the written obligation, that these things may be felt to\r\nbe profitably restored and speedily granted, that the longed-for means\r\nof performing their world-famous ministrations may be replaced in the\r\nhands of the Levites. Let that be given back which was their own,\r\nsince that is justly received back by way of largesse which the Priest\r\nhad legally mortgaged.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 865: 'Actoribus.']\r\n\r\n'Herein is the great example of King Alaric surpassed. He, when\r\nglutted with the spoil of Rome, having received the vessels of the\r\nApostle Peter from his men, when he heard the story of their seizure,\r\nordered them to be carried back across the sacred threshold, that so\r\nthe remembrance of the cupidity of their capture might be effaced by\r\nthe generosity of their restoration.\r\n\r\n'But our King, with religious purpose, has restored the vessels which\r\nhad become his own by the law of mortgage. In recompense for such\r\ndeeds frequent prayer ought to ascend, and Heaven will surely gladly\r\ngrant the required return for such good actions[866].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 866: Baronius not unfairly argues that if the Roman See was\r\nso poor that the Church plate had to be pawned to provide for the\r\nPope's journey to Constantinople, the _wealth_ of the Pope cannot have\r\nlargely contributed to that great increase of his influence which\r\nmarked the early years of the Sixth Century.]\r\n\r\n[There are in this letter several extremely obscure sentences as to\r\nthe generosity of Theodahad. As the Papal journey was undertaken by\r\nTheodahad's orders, it was a piece of meanness, quite in keeping with\r\nthat King's character, to treat the advance of money for the journey\r\nas a loan, and to insist on a bond and the deposit of the Church plate\r\nas a security for repayment. Cassiodorus evidently feels this; and\r\nvery probably the restoration of the vessels and the quittance of the\r\ndebt had been insisted on by him. But the more he despises his\r\nmaster's shabbiness, the more he struggles through a maze of almost\r\nnonsensical sentences, to prove that he has committed some very\r\nglorious action in lending the money and then forgiving the debt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO DEUSDEDIT, A SCRIBE OF RAVENNA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duties of a Scribe.]\r\n\r\n'The Scribe's office is the great safeguard of the rights of all men.\r\nThe evidence of ownership may be destroyed by fire or purloined by\r\ndishonest men, but the State by making use of the Scribe's labours is\r\nable to make good the loss so sustained. The Scribe is more diligent\r\nin other men's business than they are in their own. His\r\nmuniment-chest is the refuge of all the oppressed, and the repository\r\nof the fortunes of all men[867].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 867: 'Armarium ipsius fortuna cunctorum est.']\r\n\r\n'In testimony of your past integrity, and in the hope that no change\r\nwill mar this fair picture, we appoint you to this honourable office.\r\nRemember that ancient Truth is committed to your keeping, and that it\r\noften really rests with you, rather than with the Judge, to decide the\r\ndisputes of litigants. When your indisputable testimony is given, and\r\nwhen the ancient voice of charters proceeds from your _sanctum_,\r\nAdvocates receive it with reverence, and suitors, even\r\nevil-intentioned men, are constrained into obedience.\r\n\r\n'Banish, therefore, all thoughts of venality from your mind. The worst\r\nmoth that gets into papers and destroys them is the gold of the\r\ndishonest litigant, who bribes the Scribes to make away with evidence\r\nwhich he knows to be hostile. Thus, then, be ready always to produce\r\nto suitors genuine old documents; and, on the other hand, transcribe\r\nonly, do not compose ancient proceedings[868]. Let the copy correspond\r\nto the original as the wax to the signet-ring, that as the face is the\r\nindex of the emotions[869] so your handwriting may not err from the\r\nauthentic original in anything.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 868: 'Translator esto, non conditor antiquorum gestorum.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 869: Compare Cassiodorus' treatise De Animâ, chapters x. and\r\nxi., in which he enumerates the various points in which the faces of\r\ngood men and bad men differ from one another.]\r\n\r\n'If a claimant succeed in enticing you even once from the paths of\r\nhonesty, vainly will you in any subsequent case seek to obtain his\r\ncredence for any document that you may produce; for he will always\r\nbelieve that the trick which has been played once may be played again.\r\nKeep to the line of justice, and even his angry exclamations at the\r\nimpossibility of inducing you to deviate therefrom, will be your\r\nhighest testimonial. Your whole career is public, and the favour or\r\ndisgrace which awaits you must be public also.'\r\n\r\n\r\n22. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE PROVINCIALS OF ISTRIA.\r\n\r\n[This letter was written Sept. 1, 537, probably in consequence of the\r\nscarcity which the operations of Belisarius were already causing at\r\nRavenna. Apparently the whole taxes levied from a Province at an\r\nIndiction were divided into two heads: so much for the central\r\nauthority, and so much for the Province. Cassiodorus in this and the\r\nfollowing letter says in effect: 'All the State's share of the taxes\r\nwe will take not in money, but in your staple products, corn, wine,\r\nand oil. The rest goes as usual to the Province; but owing to the\r\nscarcity at Ravenna we shall be glad to buy all that can be spared\r\neither by the authorities of the Province or by individuals, whether\r\nfarmers or merchants.']\r\n\r\n'The true way to prevent the requirements of the public revenue from\r\nbecoming oppressive, is to order each Province to supply those\r\nproducts in which it is naturally most fertile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Requisition from Province of Istria.]\r\n\r\n'Now I have learned by conversation with travellers that the Province\r\nof Istria is this year especially blessed in three of its crops--wine,\r\noil, and corn. Therefore let her give of these products the equivalent\r\nof ... solidi, which are due from you in payment of tribute for this\r\nfirst Indiction[870]: while the remainder we leave to that loyal\r\nProvince for her own regular expenses. But since we require a larger\r\nquantity of the above-mentioned products, we send ... solidi from our\r\nstate chest for the purchase of them, that these necessaries may be\r\ncollected for us with as little delay as possible. Often when you are\r\ndesirous to sell you cannot find a purchaser, and suffer loss\r\naccordingly. How much better is it to obey the requirements of your\r\nLords than to supply foreigners; and to pay your debts in the fruits\r\nof the soil, rather than to wait on the caprices of a buyer!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 870: The first Indiction was from September 1, 537, to\r\nSeptember 1, 538.]\r\n\r\n'We will ourselves out of our love of justice state a fact of which\r\nyou might otherwise remind us, that we can afford to be liberal in\r\nprice because we are not burdened by the payment of freights [on\r\naccount of your nearness to the seat of government]. For what Campania\r\nis to Rome, Istria is to Ravenna--a fruitful Province abounding in\r\ncorn, wine, and oil; so to speak, the cupboard of the capital. I might\r\ncarry the comparison further, and say that Istria can show her own\r\nBaiae in the lagunes with which her shores are indented[871], her own\r\nAverni in the pools abounding in oysters and fish. The palaces, strung\r\nlike pearls along the shores of Istria, show how highly our ancestors\r\nappreciated its delights[872]. The beautiful chain of islands with\r\nwhich it is begirt, shelter the sailor from danger and enrich the\r\ncultivator. The residence of the Court in this district delights the\r\nnobles and enriches the lower orders; and it may be said that all its\r\nproducts find their way to the Royal city. Now let the loyal Province,\r\nwhich has often tendered her services when they were less required,\r\nsend forward her stores freely.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 871: Here follows this sentence: 'Haec loca garismatia plura\r\nnutriunt.' Garum seems to have been a sauce something like our\r\nanchovy-sauce. Garismatium is evidently a garum-supplying place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 872: We have a special allusion in Martial (iv. 25) to the\r\nvillas of Altinum, and he too compares them to those of Baiae.]\r\n\r\n'To guard against any misunderstanding of our orders, we send\r\nLaurentius, a man of great experience, whose instructions are\r\ncontained in the annexed letter.\r\n\r\n'We will publish a tariff of moderate prices when we next address you,\r\nand when we have ascertained what is the yield of the present crops;\r\nfor we should be deciding quite at random before we have received that\r\ninformation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n23. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO LAURENTIUS, VIR\r\nEXPERIENTISSIMUS[873].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 873: Evidently 'the annexed letter' referred to in No. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same subject.]\r\n\r\n'Anyone can discharge the duties of the Commissariat in a time of\r\nabundance. It is a mark of our high appreciation of your experience\r\nand efficiency, that we select you for this service in a time of\r\nscarcity. We therefore direct you to repair to the Province of Istria,\r\nthere to collect stores of wine, oil, and corn, equivalent to ...\r\nsolidi, due from the Province for land-tax[874], and with ... solidi\r\nwhich you have received from our Treasurer to buy these products\r\neither from the merchants or from the peasants directly, according to\r\nthe information prepared for you by the Cashiers[875]. Raise your\r\nspirits for this duty, and discharge it in a manner worthy of your\r\npast reputation. Make to us a faithful report of the yield of the\r\ncoming harvest, under these three heads[876], that we may fix a tariff\r\nof prices which shall be neither burdensome to the Provincials nor\r\ninjurious to the public service.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 874: 'Ut in tot solidos vini, olei, vel tritici species de\r\ntributario solido debeas procurare.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 875: 'Sicut te a Numerariis instruxit porrecta Notitia.'\r\nNote this use of the word 'Notitia,' as illustrating the title of the\r\ncelebrated document bearing that name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 876: Corn, wine, and oil.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO THE TRIBUNES OF THE MARITIME\r\nPOPULATION[877].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 877: Written shortly after Sept. 1, 537. This is the\r\ncelebrated letter to which Venetian historians point as evidence of\r\nthe existence of their city (or at least of the group of settlements\r\nout of which their city sprang) in the Sixth Century. We may set side\r\nby side with it the words of the Anonymous Geographer of Ravenna (in\r\nthe Seventh Century), 'In patria vero Venetiae sunt aliquantae\r\ninsulae, quae hominibus habitantur.'\r\n\r\nThe address, _Tribunis Maritimorum_, looks as if there were something\r\nlike a municipal government established in these islands. Tribunus was\r\nat this time generally, but not exclusively, a military title. Compare\r\nthe Tribunus Fori Suarii and Tribunus Rerum Nitentium of the Notitia\r\n(Occidens iv. 10 and iv. 17). But there can be no doubt, from the tone\r\nof this letter, that the islanders were subjects of the Ostrogothic\r\nKing.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First historical notice of Venice.]\r\n\r\n'We have previously given orders that Istria should send wine and oil,\r\nof which there are abundant crops this year, to the Royal residence\r\nat Ravenna. Do you, who possess numerous ships on the borders of the\r\nProvince, show the same devotion in forwarding the stores which they\r\ndo in supplying them.\r\n\r\n'Be therefore active in fulfilling this commission in your own\r\nneighbourhood, you who often cross boundless distances. It may be said\r\nthat [in visiting Ravenna] you are going through your own\r\nguest-chambers, you who in your voyages traverse your own home[878].\r\nThis is also added to your other advantages, that to you another route\r\nis open, marked by perpetual safety and tranquillity. For when by\r\nraging winds the sea is closed, a way is opened to you through the\r\nmost charming river scenery[879]. Your keels fear no rough blasts;\r\nthey touch the earth with the greatest pleasure, and cannot perish\r\nhowever frequently they may come in contact with it. Beholders from a\r\ndistance, not seeing the channel of the stream, might fancy them\r\nmoving through the meadows. Cables have been used to keep them at\r\nrest: now drawn by ropes they move, and by a changed order of things\r\nmen help their ships with their feet. They draw their drawers without\r\nlabour, and instead of the capricious favour of sails they use the\r\nmore satisfactory steps of the sailor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 878: An obscure sentence: 'Per hospitia quodammodo vestra\r\ndiscurritis qui per patriam navigatis.' The idea seems to be: 'You\r\nhave to sail about from one room to another of your own house, and\r\ntherefore Ravenna will seem like a neighbouring inn.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 879: The next four sentences describe the movement of the\r\nships when towed along the channels of the streams (Brenta, Piave,\r\nTagliamento, &c.) the deposits from which have made the lagunes.]\r\n\r\n'It is a pleasure to recall the situation of your dwellings as I\r\nmyself have seen them. Venetia the praiseworthy[880], formerly full of\r\nthe dwellings of the nobility, touches on the south Ravenna and the\r\nPo, while on the east it enjoys the delightsomeness of the Ionian\r\nshore, where the alternating tide now discovers and now conceals the\r\nface of the fields by the ebb and flow of its inundation. Here after\r\nthe manner of water-fowl have you fixed your home. He who was just now\r\non the mainland finds himself on an island, so that you might fancy\r\nyourself in the Cyclades[881], from the sudden alterations in the\r\nappearance of the shore.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 880: 'Venetiae praedicabiles.' An allusion, no doubt, as\r\nother commentators have suggested, to the reputed derivation of\r\nVenetia from [Greek: Ainetoi], 'the laudable.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 881: Alluding probably to the story of the floating island\r\nof Delos.]\r\n\r\n'Like them[882] there are seen amid the wide expanse of the waters\r\nyour scattered homes, not the product of Nature, but cemented by the\r\ncare of man into a firm foundation[883]. For by a twisted and knotted\r\nosier-work the earth there collected is turned into a solid mass, and\r\nyou oppose without fear to the waves of the sea so fragile a bulwark,\r\nsince forsooth the mass of waters is unable to sweep away the shallow\r\nshore, the deficiency in depth depriving the waves of the necessary\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 882: 'Earum similitudine.' Does Cassiodorus mean 'like the\r\nwater-fowl,' or 'like the Cyclades?']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 883: The reading of Nivellius (followed by Migne),\r\n'Domicilia videntur sparsa, quae Natura non protulit sed hominum cura\r\nfundavit,' seems to give a better sense than that of Garet, who omits\r\nthe 'non.']\r\n\r\n'The inhabitants have one notion of plenty, that of gorging themselves\r\nwith fish. Poverty therefore may associate itself with wealth on equal\r\nterms. One kind of food refreshes all; the same sort of dwelling\r\nshelters all; no one can envy his neighbour's home; and living in this\r\nmoderate style they escape that vice [of envy] to which all the rest\r\nof the world is liable.\r\n\r\n'Your whole attention is concentrated on your salt-works. Instead of\r\ndriving the plough or wielding the sickle, you roll your cylinders.\r\nThence arises your whole crop, when you find in them that product\r\nwhich you have not manufactured[884]. There it may be said is your\r\nsubsistence-money coined[885]. Of this art of yours every wave is a\r\nbondservant. In the quest for gold a man may be lukewarm: but salt\r\nevery one desires to find; and deservedly so, since to it every kind\r\nof meat owes its savour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 884: 'Inde vobis fructus omnis enascitur, quando in ipsis,\r\net quae non facitis possidetis.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 885: 'Moneta illic quodammodo percutitur victualis.' Some\r\nhave supposed that these words point to a currency in salt; but I\r\nthink they are only a Cassiodorian way of saying 'By this craft ye\r\nhave your wealth.']\r\n\r\n'Therefore let your ships, which you have tethered, like so many\r\nbeasts of burden, to your walls, be repaired with diligent care: so\r\nthat when the most experienced Laurentius attempts to bring you his\r\ninstructions, you may hasten forth to greet him. Do not by any\r\nhindrance on your part delay the necessary purchases which he has to\r\nmake; since you, on account of the character of your winds, are able\r\nto choose the shortest sea-track[886].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 886: This is the only translation I can suggest of 'quatenus\r\nexpensas necessarias nulla difficultate tardetis, qui pro qualitate\r\naeris compendium vobis eligere potestis itineris.']\r\n\r\n\r\n25. SENATOR, PRAETORIAN PRAEFECT, TO HIS DEPUTY[887] AMBROSIUS, AN\r\nILLUSTRIS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 887: 'Agenti vices.' See note on xi. 4.]\r\n\r\n[This letter appears to have been written in the early autumn of 538,\r\nabout a year after the three last letters, and also after Letters 27\r\nand 28, which precede it in order of date, though they follow it in\r\nthis collection. For an account of the terrible famine in Italy, the\r\nbeginning of which is here described, see Procopius, De Bello Gotthico\r\nii. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Famine in Italy.]\r\n\r\n'Since the world is not governed by chance, but by a Divine Ruler who\r\ndoes not change His purposes at random, men are alarmed, and naturally\r\nalarmed, at the extraordinary signs in the heavens, and ask with\r\nanxious hearts what events these may portend. The Sun, first of stars,\r\nseems to have lost his wonted light, and appears of a bluish colour.\r\nWe marvel to see no shadows of our bodies at noon, to feel the mighty\r\nvigour of his heat wasted into feebleness, and the phenomena which\r\naccompany a transitory eclipse prolonged through a whole year.\r\n\r\n'The Moon too, even when her orb is full, is empty of her natural\r\nsplendour. Strange has been the course of the year thus far. We have\r\nhad a winter without storms, a spring without mildness, and a summer\r\nwithout heat. Whence can we look for harvest, since the months which\r\nshould have been maturing the corn have been chilled by Boreas? How\r\ncan the blade open if rain, the mother of all fertility, is denied to\r\nit? These two influences, prolonged frost and unseasonable drought,\r\nmust be adverse to all things that grow. The seasons seem to be all\r\njumbled up together, and the fruits, which were wont to be formed by\r\ngentle showers, cannot be looked for from the parched earth. But as\r\nlast year was one that boasted of an exceptionally abundant harvest,\r\nyou are to collect all of its fruits that you can, and store them up\r\nfor the coming months of scarcity, for which it is well able to\r\nprovide. And that you may not be too much distressed by the signs in\r\nthe heavens of which I have spoken, return to the consideration of\r\nNature, and apprehend the reason of that which makes the vulgar gape\r\nwith wonder.\r\n\r\n'The middle air is thickened by the rigour of snow and rarefied by the\r\nbeams of the Sun. This is the great Inane, roaming between the heavens\r\nand the earth. When it happens to be pure and lighted up by the rays\r\nof the sun it opens out its true aspect[888]; but when alien elements\r\nare blended with it, it is stretched like a hide across the sky, and\r\nsuffers neither the true colours of the heavenly bodies to appear nor\r\ntheir proper warmth to penetrate. This often happens in cloudy weather\r\nfor a time; it is only its extraordinary prolongation which has\r\nproduced these disastrous effects, causing the reaper to fear a new\r\nfrost in harvest, making the apples to harden when they should grow\r\nripe, souring the old age of the grape-cluster.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 888: 'Vestros (?) veraciter pandit aspectus.']\r\n\r\n'All this, however, though it would be wrong to construe it as an omen\r\nof Divine wrath, cannot but have an injurious effect on the fruits of\r\nthe earth. Let it be your care to see that the scarcity of this one\r\nyear does not bring ruin on us all. Even thus was it ordained by the\r\nfirst occupant of our present dignity[889], that the preceding plenty\r\nshould avail to mitigate the present penury.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 889: Joseph, Praetorian Praefect of Egypt under Pharaoh.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26.

The Venerable Augustin, a man\r\nillustrious by his life and name, has brought under our notice the\r\nlamentable petition of the Venetians, to the effect that there have\r\nbeen in their Province no crops of wine, wheat, or millet, and that\r\nthey must be ruined unless the Royal pity succours them.\r\n\r\n'In these circumstances it would be cruel to exact the customary\r\nsupplies from them, and we therefore remit the contributions of wine\r\nand wheat for the use of the army which we had ordered from the cities\r\nof Concordia, Aquileia, and Forojulii[891], exacting only the meat, as\r\nshown by the accompanying letter[892].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 891: Now Cividale in Friuli. Notice the terminations of\r\nthese names: 'ex Concordiense, Aquileiense, et Forojuliense\r\ncivitatibus' ('e,' not 'i').]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 892: The letter here alluded to does not appear to be\r\npreserved.]\r\n\r\n'We shall send from hence a sufficient supply of wheat when the time\r\ncomes; and as we are told that there is a plentiful crop of wine in\r\nIstria, you can buy there the wine that would have been furnished by\r\nthe three cities.

Some of the ecclesiastical writers spell it with a 'c.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relief of famine-stricken citizens of Ticinum and Dertona.]\r\n\r\n'It is most fitting that good and holy men should be made the stewards\r\nof the Royal bounty. We therefore request your Holiness, in accordance\r\nwith the King's commands, to open the granaries at Ticinum[894], and\r\nDertona[895], and sell millet thereat to the starving people at the\r\nrate of 20 modii per solidum[896]. We are anxious that you should do\r\nthis, lest the work should fall into venal hands which would sell the\r\nKing's bounty to those who are able to provide for themselves. It is\r\nthe poor, not the rich, that we wish to help: we would pour our bounty\r\ninto empty vessels. Let not then your Holiness think this work of\r\ncompassion, unworthy of your sacred office. In order to assist you we\r\nhave sent A and B, who will simply obey the orders of your Holiness,\r\ndoing nothing of their own motion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 894: Pavia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 895: Tortona.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 896: Twelve shillings for twenty pecks, or about nineteen\r\nshillings and twopence a quarter; not a very low price, one would\r\nthink, for such a grain as millet.\r\n\r\nDatius is ordered to sell _tertiam portionem_ of this millet. Probably\r\nthis expression has the same meaning as the 'tertia illatio' of xi.\r\n37.\r\n\r\nIn the similar letter, x. 27, 'tertia portio' (whether of wheat or\r\nmillet is not stated) is to be sold at 25 modii per solidum.]\r\n\r\n'Send us an account of the solidi received in payment for the said\r\nmillet, that they may be stored up with our Treasurer[897], in order\r\nto replace the before-mentioned grain, and thus provide a reserve for\r\nfuture times of scarcity; like a garment taken to pieces that it may\r\nbe made up again as good as new.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 897: 'Arcarius.']\r\n\r\n[It is not very easy to assign a date to this letter. The mention of\r\nthe famine would incline us to assign it to 538, as that seems to have\r\nbeen the year when the full force of the famine was felt in Italy (see\r\nProcopius, De Bello Gotthico ii. 20, where 538 and 539 seem to be\r\nmarked as the two great famine years). But very early in 538 the\r\nBishop of Milan, the same Datius to whom this letter is addressed,\r\nvisited Rome to entreat Belisarius to send a small garrison to occupy\r\nMilan, which had already revolted, or was on the verge of revolting,\r\nfrom the Gothic King. As soon as the siege of Rome was raised\r\nBelisarius complied with this request, and sent 1,000 men, under\r\nMundilas, to escort Datius back to Milan. This expedition set forth\r\nprobably in April 538, and as soon as it arrived at Milan that city\r\nopenly proclaimed its defection from Witigis and its allegiance to the\r\nEmperor. It was soon besieged by Uraias, nephew of Witigis, by whom in\r\nthe following year (539) it was taken. The city, we are informed, was\r\nrased to the ground, and Bishop Datius escaped to Constantinople.\r\nEvidently we have here a continuous chain of events, which makes it\r\nimpossible for us to date this letter in 538 or any subsequent year.\r\n\r\nWe ought probably therefore to assign it to the autumn of 537, and to\r\nlook upon it as an attempt (unsuccessful, as it proved) to retain\r\nDatius and the citizens of Milan on the side of the Goths. We know\r\nfrom the Twenty-second Letter of this book that signs of scarcity had\r\nalready shown themselves in Italy by the 1st September, 537; and in an\r\ninteresting passage of the 'Historia Miscella' (Book xvi.), famine in\r\nLiguria, the year 537, and the name of Datius are all combined.\r\n'Praeter belli instantiam angebatur insuper Roma famis penuriâ: tanta\r\nsiquidem per universum mundum eo anno [the year of the siege of Rome],\r\n_maxime apud Liguriam_ fames excreverat, ut _sicut vir sanctissimus\r\nDatius Mediolanensis antistes retulit_, pleraeque matres infelicium\r\nnatorum membra comederent.' I owe this reference to Baronius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. AN EDICT [ADDRESSED TO THE LIGURIANS].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relief of inhabitants of Liguria.]\r\n\r\n'Divine Providence uses adversity as a means of testing our\r\ncharacters. Famine has afflicted the Provinces, but the result of it\r\nhas been that they have proved more fully than before the bounty of\r\ntheir King. Rejoice herein, oh ye Ligurians! For when, as you will\r\nremember, on a previous occasion the savage temper of your neighbours\r\nwas aroused, and Aemilia and your Liguria were shaken by an incursion\r\nof the Burgundians, who waged a sneaking campaign by reason of their\r\nnearness to your territory, suddenly the renown of the insulted\r\nEmpire[898] arose like the sun in his strength. The enemy mourned the\r\nruin which was caused by his own presumption, when he learned that\r\nthat man was Ruler of the Gothic race whose rare valour he had\r\nexperienced when he was still a private soldier[899]. How often did\r\nthe Burgundian wish that he had never left his own frontiers to be\r\ncompelled to fight with such an adversary as our Sovereign; for though\r\nhe found with relief that he escaped his actual presence in the field,\r\nnone the less did his rashness bring him in contact with the good\r\nfortune of his arms. For when with redoubled fortitude[900] the Goths\r\nturned to the prosecution of the war, with such successfully combined\r\noperations did they strike the bands of the rebels, that you would\r\nhave thought those were all armed men, these were all\r\ndefenceless[901]. Such was the just judgment of God, that the robber\r\nshould perish in those very plains which he had presumed to desolate.\r\nExult now, oh Province, adorned with the carcases of thine\r\nadversaries! rejoice, oh Liguria, at the heap of dead bodies! If the\r\nharvest of corn is denied thee, the harvest of dead enemies shall not\r\nbe wanting. Tribute thou mayest not be able to offer to thy King, but\r\nthe triumphs which are won in thy land thou canst offer with pride.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 898: Literally, 'of the present Empire:' 'subito praesentis\r\nImperii tanquam solis ortus fama radiavit.' I avoid the word\r\n'present,' because of its ambiguity. Observe the use of 'Imperii'\r\napplied to the Gothic Kingdom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 899: 'Quando illum cognovit nominatae (?) gentis esse\r\nRectorem, quem sub militis nomine probaverat esse singularem.' This\r\nevident allusion to Witigis obliges us to place the date of this\r\nBurgundian invasion not much earlier than the summer of 536, when\r\nWitigis was raised to the throne. Apparently the Burgundians were\r\nalready in Italy when they heard the news of that event.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 900: 'Ut Gothi ad belli studium geminâ se fortitudine\r\ncontulerunt.' These words perhaps allude to the necessity of fighting\r\ntwo enemies at once, Belisarius and the Burgundians; or perhaps to the\r\nexistence of two Gothic armies, whose combined operations are\r\nindicated by the following words, 'prospera concertatione.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 901: 'Quasi inde nudos hinc stare contigisset armatos.'\r\n'Hinc' and 'inde' refer to geographical position, not to the order of\r\nthe words in the sentence.]\r\n\r\n'[902]To these triumphs must be added the lately foiled plunder-raid\r\nof the Alamanni, so checked in its very first attempts that their\r\nentrance and exit were almost one event, like a wound well and\r\nopportunely cauterised. Thus were the excesses of the presumptuous\r\ninvader punished, and the subjects of our King were saved from\r\nabsolute ruin. I might indeed enumerate to you what crowds of the\r\nenemy fell in other places, but I turn rather--such is human\r\nnature--to more joyful themes, and revert to the point with which I at\r\nfirst commenced, namely that the Sovereign who has saved you from the\r\nhostile sword is determined now to avert from your Province the perils\r\nof famine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 902: See von Schubert's 'Unterwerfung der Alamannen,' pp.\r\n57-59, for a careful analysis of the following paragraph.]\r\n\r\n'In this new war the citadels are well-stored granaries; Starvation is\r\nthe dreaded foe: if they are closed she enters; by opening them wide\r\nshe is put to flight. I know not what the world in general may think\r\nof the relative merit of these two campaigns of our King. For my part,\r\nthough I recognise it as the mark of a brave man to have fought a\r\nwinning battle, I think it is something above mere human valour to\r\nhave conquered penury.\r\n\r\n'In addition to these benefits the King has remitted one-half of the\r\ntaxes of the Province, that he might not sadden with the one hand\r\nthose whom he was gladdening with the other. Herein he compares\r\nfavourably with Joseph, who sold corn to the Egyptians, but on such\r\nterms that they lost their personal freedom. Doubtless that holy man\r\nwas placed in a dilemma between the necessity of satisfying a covetous\r\nKing on the one hand, and that of rescuing a starving people on the\r\nother. Still I must think that the Egyptian, whose life was preserved,\r\ngroaned over the loss of his liberty; and if I may say so, with all\r\nrespect to so great a patriarch[903], far nobler is it to sell corn to\r\nfreemen who remain freemen, and to lighten their taxes on account of\r\npoverty. This is really a gratuitous distribution, when both the money\r\nwith which to buy is handed over to you [by the abatement of tribute],\r\nand a price is fixed on purpose to please you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 903: 'Pace tanti patris dixerim.']\r\n\r\n'The generosity of the State therefore will sell 25 modii, when the\r\npeasant has lost his crops, at the price at which 10 are usually\r\nsold[904]. Humanity has altered the usual course of affairs, and by a\r\nstrange kind of chaffering, but one which truly becomes a King, just\r\nwhen the famished peasant is willing to offer us an enhanced price\r\nfor food, we are directed to offer it to him for a smaller one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 904: Probably one solidus: making the largesse price 15s.\r\n4d. a quarter (about four shillings less than the price named in the\r\npreceding letter for millet); while the market price was 38s. 4d. a\r\nquarter. I read these sentences thus: 'Vendit itaque largitas publica\r\nvicenos quinque modios, dum possessor invenire non possit, ad denos.\r\nOrdinem rerum saeculi mutavit humanitas.' The construction is harsh\r\nand elliptical, but this makes sense, which the ordinary punctuation,\r\nthrowing 'ad denos' into the following sentence, does not.]\r\n\r\n'The King himself had seen your calamity, and thereupon bestowed on\r\nyou previously one favour. Now, on hearing of its continuance, he adds\r\nto it a second. Happy calamity, which forced itself on the notice of\r\nsuch an eye-witness!\r\n\r\n'Now, oh Ligurian, rejoice in the good fortune which has come to thee.\r\nCompare thy lot with the Egyptian's and be happy. He was fed, but lost\r\nhis freedom; thou art fed, and at the same time defended from thy\r\nenemies. Joseph gave back the purchase-money to his brethren in their\r\nsacks, showing a greater kindness to his kindred than to his subjects.\r\nOur King shows no such partiality, but bestows on all the taxpayers\r\nlarger benefits than he did on his brethren. Happy age! in which Kings\r\nmay be likened, not to Kings, but to Prophets, and yet bear away the\r\npalm.\r\n\r\n'But that we may not longer detain you from the desired enjoyment of\r\nthe Royal benefits, know that our commands have been given to those\r\nwhose business it is to attend to this affair, that, according to the\r\ntenour of this edict, the generosity of the Sovereign may penetrate\r\ninto your homes.'\r\n\r\n[The same considerations which were applied to the date of the\r\npreceding letter seem to require that this also be dated in 537. After\r\nthe raising of the siege of Rome (March, 538), by the despatch of\r\nImperial troops into Liguria, and the enthusiastic adherence of that\r\nProvince to the Imperial cause, a new state of things was established,\r\nand one to which the language of this letter would have been utterly\r\ninapplicable.\r\n\r\nThere are two events of which we have no other knowledge than that\r\nfurnished by this letter: the invasion of the Burgundians, and the\r\nravages of the Alamanni in the Province of Liguria.\r\n\r\n(1) The invasion of the Burgundians seems, as stated in a previous\r\nnote, to have occurred in the spring or early summer of 536; so that\r\nCassiodorus could represent the invaders as surprised and disheartened\r\nby learning of the elevation of Witigis. It no doubt formed part of\r\nthose hostile operations of the Frankish Kings described by Procopius\r\n(De Bello Gotthico i. 13), the termination of which was purchased by\r\nWitigis by the cession of Provence and the payment of a subsidy. It is\r\ninteresting to observe, however, that the Burgundians, notwithstanding\r\ntheir subjugation in 534, and their incorporation in the Frankish\r\nmonarchy, are still spoken of as conducting an invasion on their own\r\naccount. This is just like the invasion of Italy in 553 by the\r\nAlamannic brethren, and is quite in keeping with the loosely compacted\r\ncharacter of the Merovingian monarchy, in which it was copied by the\r\nAnglian and Saxon Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n(2) For the ravages of the Alamanni consult, as before stated, von\r\nSchubert's monograph. This passage quite confirms his view of the\r\nevents connected with the overthrow of the Alamannic Kingdom by\r\nClovis. A remnant of the people, settled as refugees in Raetia under\r\nTheodoric's protection, now, in the decline of the Ostrogothic\r\nmonarchy throw off their allegiance to his successors, and press\r\nforward over the Alps to share the spoil of Italy. Witigis, however,\r\nnotwithstanding his struggle with Belisarius, is still able promptly\r\nto repel this incursion; but it co-operates with the Burgundian\r\ninvasion and the inclement spring and summer of 537 to bring about the\r\nfamine in Liguria in the autumn of that year.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF PERSONS\r\n\r\nTO WHOM THE LETTERS ARE ADDRESSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAbundantius, Praetorian Praefect, v. 16, 17, 23, 34; ix. 4.\r\n\r\nAcretius, _see_ Eutropius.\r\n\r\nAdeodatus, iii. 46.\r\n\r\nAdila, Vir Spectabilis, Comes, ii. 29.\r\n\r\nAemilianus, Vir Venerabilis, Bishop, iv. 31.\r\n\r\nAestunae, Possessores, Defensores, and Curiales dwelling at, iii. 9.\r\n\r\nAgapitus, Praefectus Urbis,\r\n  Vir Illustris atque Patricius, i. 6, 23, 32, 33, 41; ii. 6.\r\n\r\nAlaric (II), King of the Visigoths (484-507), iii. 1.\r\n\r\nAlbienus, Vir Illustris atque Patricius, i. 20;\r\n  Praefectus Praetorio, viii. 20.\r\n\r\nAlbinus and Albienus, Viri Illustres atque Patricii, i. 20.\r\n\r\nAlbinus, Vir Illustris, Patricius, iv. 30.\r\n\r\nAlbinus, Actores of, iv. 35.\r\n\r\nAloisius, Architect, ii. 39.\r\n\r\nAmabilis, Exsecutor, i. 8;\r\n  Vir Devotus (?
