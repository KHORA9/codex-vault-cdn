Emerson, who was seated by me at the right,\r\nsuggested the \"Confessions\" of Rousseau.  I objected that it was full of\r\nuntruths, and that for plain candour it was surpassed by the \"Life of\r\nCasanova.\"  Of this work (regarding which Carlyle has said, \"Whosoever\r\nhas looked therein, let him wash his hands and be unclean until even\")\r\nneither Emerson nor Lowell, nor Palfrey nor Agassiz, nor any of the\r\nothers present seemed to have any knowledge, until Dr. Holmes, who was\r\nmore adventurous, admitted he knew somewhat thereof.  Now, as I had read\r\nit thrice through, I knew it pretty well.  I reflected on this, but came\r\nto the conclusion that perhaps the great reason why the world has so few\r\nand frank autobiographies is really because the world exacts too much.  It\r\nis no more necessary to describe everything cynically than it is to set\r\nforth all our petty diseases in detail.  There are many influences which,\r\nindependent of passion or shame, do far more to form character.\r\n\r\nActing from this reflection, I wrote this book with no intention that it\r\nshould be published; I had, indeed, some idea that a certain friend might\r\nuse it after my death as a source whence to form a Life.  Therefore I\r\nwrote, as fully and honestly as I could, _everything_ which I could\r\nremember which had made me what I am.  It occurred to me as a leading\r\nmotive that a century or two hence the true inner life of _any_ man who\r\nhad actually lived from the time when railroads, steamboats, telegraphs,\r\ngas, percussion-caps, fulminating matches, the opera and omnibuses,\r\nevolution and socialism were quite unknown to his world, into the modern\r\nage, would be of some value.  So I described my childhood or youth\r\nexactly as I recalled, or as I felt it.  Such a book requires very\r\nmerciful allowance from humane reviewers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me, also, that though I have not lived familiarly among the\r\nprinces, potentates, and powers of the earth, yet as I have met or _seen_\r\nor corresponded with about five hundred of the three thousand set down in\r\n\"Men of the Time,\" and been kindly classed among them, it was worth while\r\nto mention my meetings with many of them.  Had the humblest scribbler of\r\nthe age of Elizabeth so much as mentioned that he had ever exchanged a\r\nword with, or even looked at, any of the great writers of his time, his\r\nrecord would now be read with avidity.  I have really never in my life\r\nrun after such men, or sought to make their acquaintance with a view of\r\nextending my list; all that I can tell of them, as my book will show, has\r\nbeen the result of chance.  But what I have written will be of some\r\ninterest, I think--at least \"in the dim and remote future.\"\r\n\r\nI had laid the manuscript by, till I had time to quite forget what I had\r\nwritten, when I unexpectedly received a proposal to write my memoirs.  I\r\nthen read over my work, and determined \"to let it go,\" as it was.  It\r\nseemed to me that, with all its faults, it fulfilled the requisition of\r\nMontaigne in being _ung livre de bonne foye_.  So it has gone forth into\r\nprint.  _Jacta est alea_.\r\n\r\nThe story of what is to me by far the most interesting period of my life\r\nremains to be written.  This embraces an account of my labour for many\r\nyears in introducing Industrial Art as a branch of education in schools,\r\nmy life in England and on the Continent for more than twenty years, my\r\ntravels in Russia and Egypt, my researches among Gypsies and Algonkin\r\nIndians, my part in Oriental and Folklore and other Congresses, my\r\ndiscovery of the Shelta or Ogham tongue in Great Britain, and the long\r\nand very strangely adventurous discoveries, continued for five years,\r\namong _witches_ in Italy, which resulted in the discovery that all the\r\nnames of the old Etruscan gods are still remembered by the peasantry of\r\nthe Toscana Romagna, and that ceremonies and invocations are still\r\naddressed to them.  All this, however, is still too near to be written\r\nabout.  But it may perhaps some day form a second series of reminiscences\r\nif the present volumes meet with public favour.\r\n\r\nAs some of my readers (and assuredly a great many of the American) will\r\nfind these volumes wanting in personal adventure and lively variety of\r\nexperiences, and perhaps dull as regards \"incidents,\" I would remind them\r\nthat it is, after all, only the life of a mere literary man and quiet,\r\nhumble scholar, and that such existences are seldom very dramatic.\r\nEnglish readers, who are more familiar with such men or literature, will\r\nbe less exacting.  What I have narrated is nowhere heightened in colour,\r\nretouched in drawing, or made the utmost of for effect, and I might have\r\ngone much further as regards my experiences in politics with the\r\n_Continental Magazine_, and during my connection with Colonel Forney, or\r\nlife in the West, and have taken the whole, not more from my memory than\r\nfrom the testimony of others.  But if this work be, as Germans say, at\r\nfirst too subjective, and devoted too much to mere mental development by\r\naid of books, the \"balance\" to come of my life will be found to differ\r\nmaterially from it, though it is indeed nowhere in any passage exciting.\r\nThis present work treats of my infancy in Philadelphia, with some note of\r\nthe quaint and beautiful old Quaker city as it then was, and many of its\r\ninhabitants who still remembered Colonial times and Washington's\r\nRepublican Court; reminiscences of boyhood in New England; my\r\nrevolutionary grandfathers and other relatives, and such men as the last\r\nsurvivor of the Boston Tea-party (I also saw the last signer of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence); an account of my early reading; my college\r\nlife at Princeton; three years in Europe passed at the Universities of\r\nHeidelberg, Munich, and Paris, in what was emphatically the prime of\r\ntheir quaint student-days; an account of my barricade experiences of the\r\nFrench Revolution of Forty-Eight, of which I missed no chief scene; my\r\nsubsequent life in America as lawyer, man of letters, and journalist; my\r\nexperiences in connection with the Civil War, and my work in the\r\nadvancement of the signing the Emancipation by Abraham Lincoln;\r\nrecollections of the Oil Region when the oil mania was at its height; a\r\nwinter on the frontier in the debatable land (which was indeed not devoid\r\nof strange life, though I say it); my subsequent connection for three\r\nyears with Colonel John Forney, during which Grant's election was\r\ncertainly carried by him, and in which, as he declared, I \"had been his\r\nright-hand man;\" my writing of sundry books, such as the \"Breitmann\r\nBallads,\" and my subsequent life in Europe to the year 1870.\r\n\r\nI can enumerate in my memory distinctly half-a-dozen little-known men\r\nwhom I have known, and could with time recall far many more, compared to\r\nwhose lives my uneventful and calm career has been as that of the mole\r\nbefore the eagle's.  Yet not one of their lives will ever be written,\r\nwhich is certainly a pity.  The practice of writing real autobiographies\r\nis rapidly ceasing in this our age, when it is bad form to be egoistic or\r\nto talk about one's self, and we are almost shocked in revising those\r\nchronicled in the _Causeries de Lundi_ of Sainte-Beuve.  Nowadays we have\r\ngood gossipy reminiscences of _other_ people, in which the writer remains\r\nas unseen as the operator of a Punch exhibition in his _schwassel_ box,\r\nwhile he displays his puppets.  I find no fault with this--_a chacun sa\r\nmaniere_.  But it is very natural under such influences that men whose\r\nown lives are full of and inspired with their _own_ deeds will not write\r\nthem on the model of Benvenuto Cellini.  One of the greatest generals of\r\nmodern times, Lord Napier of Magdala, told me that he believed I was the\r\nonly person to whom he had ever fully narrated his experiences of the\r\nsiege of Lucknow.  He seemed to be surprised at having so forgotten\r\nhimself.  In ancient Viking days the hero made his debut in every society\r\nwith a \"_Me voici_, _mes enfants_!  Listen if you want to be astonished!\"\r\nand proceeded to tell how he had smashed the heads of kings, and mashed\r\nthe hearts of maidens, and done great deeds all round.  It was bad\r\nform--and yet we should never have known much about Regner Lodbrog but\r\nfor such a canticle.  If I, in this work, have not quite effaced myself,\r\nas good taste demands, let it be remembered that if I had, at the time of\r\nwriting, distinctly felt that it would be printed as put down, there\r\nwould, most certainly, have been much less of \"me\" visible, and the dead-\r\nlevelled work would have escaped much possible shot of censure.  It was a\r\nlittle in a spirit of defiant reaction that I resolved to let it be\r\npublished as it is, and risk the chances.  As Uncle Toby declared that,\r\nafter all, a mother must in some kind of a way be a relation to her own\r\nchild, so it still appears to me that to write an autobiography the\r\nauthor must say _something_ about himself; but it is a great and very\r\npopular _tour de force_ to quite avoid doing this, and all art of late\r\nyears has run to merely skilfully overcoming difficulties and avoiding\r\ninteresting _motives_ or subjects.  It may be, therefore, that in days to\r\ncome, my book will be regarded with some interest, as a curious relic of\r\na barbarous age, and written in a style long passed away--\r\n\r\n   \"When they sat with ghosts on a stormy shore,\r\n   And spoke in a tongue which men speak no more;\r\n   Living in wild and wondrous ways,\r\n   In the ancient giant and goblin days.\"\r\n\r\nOnce in my younger time, one of the most beautiful and intellectual women\r\nwhom I ever knew, Madame Anita de Barrera--(Daniel Webster said she was\r\nbeautiful enough to redeem a whole generation of blue-stockings from the\r\ncharge of ugliness)--once made a great and pathetic fuss to me about a\r\n_grey hair_ which had appeared among her black tresses.  \"And what\r\ndifference,\" I said, \"can one white hair make to any friend?\"  \"Well,\"\r\nshe replied, \"I thought if I could not awaken any other feeling, I might\r\nat least inspire in you veneration for old age.\"  So with this work of\r\nmine, if it please in naught else, it may still gratify some who love to\r\ntrace the footsteps of the past, and listen to what is told by one who\r\nlived long \"before the war.\"\r\n\r\nNow for a last word--which involves the only point of any importance to\r\nme personally in this preface--I would say that there will be certain\r\nreaders who will perhaps think that I have exaggerated my life-work, or\r\nblown my own trumpet too loudly.  To these I declare in plain honesty,\r\nthat I believe there have been or are in the United States _thousands_ of\r\nmen who have _far_ surpassed me, especially as regards services to the\r\ncountry during the Civil War.  There were leaders in war and diplomacy,\r\neditors and soldiers who sacrificed their lives, to whose names I can\r\nonly bow in reverence and humility.  But as it was said of the great\r\nunknown who passed away--the _fortes ante Agamemnon_--\"they had no poet,\r\nand they died.\"  These most deserving ones have not written their lives\r\nor set themselves forth, \"and so they pass into oblivion\"--and I regret\r\nit with all my soul.  But this is no reason why those who did something,\r\nalbeit in lesser degree, should not chronicle their experiences exactly\r\nas they appear to them, and it is not in human nature to require a man to\r\ndepreciate that to which he honestly devoted all his energies.  Perhaps\r\nit never yet entered into the heart of man to conceive how much has\r\nreally been done by everybody.\r\n\r\nAnd I do most earnestly and solemnly protest, as if it were my last word\r\nin life, that I have said nothing whatever as regards my political work\r\nand its results which was not seriously said at the time by many far\r\ngreater men than I, so that I believe I have not the least exaggerated in\r\nany trifle, even unconsciously.  Thus I can never forget the deep and\r\ntouching sympathy which Henry W. Longfellow expressed to me regarding my\r\nefforts to advance Emancipation, and how, when some one present observed\r\nthat perhaps I would irritate the Non-Abolition Union men, the poet\r\ndeclared emphatically, \"But it is a great idea\" or \"a noble work.\"  And\r\nLowell, Emerson, and George W. Curtis, Bayard Taylor, and many more,\r\nspoke to the same effect.  And what they said of me I may repeat for the\r\nsake of History and of Truth.\r\n\r\nThe present work describes more than forty years of life in America, and\r\nit is therefore the American reader who will be chiefly interested in it.\r\nI should perhaps have mentioned what I reserved for special comment in\r\nthe future: that during more than ten years' residence in Europe I had\r\n_one thing steadily in view all the time_, at which I worked hard, which\r\nwas to qualify myself to return to America and there introduce to the\r\npublic schools of Philadelphia the Industrial or Minor Arts as a branch\r\nof education, in which I eventually succeeded, devoting to the work there\r\nfour years, applying myself so assiduously as to neglect both society and\r\namusements, and not obtaining, nor seeking for, pay or profit thereby in\r\nany way, directly or indirectly.  And if I have, as I have read, since\r\nthen \"expatriated\" myself, my whole absence has not been much longer than\r\nwas that of Washington Irving, and I trust to be able to prove that I\r\nhave \"left my country for my country's good\"--albeit in a somewhat better\r\nsense than that which was implied by the poet.\r\n\r\nAnd I may here incidentally mention, with all due modesty, that since the\r\nforegoing paragraph came to me \"in revise,\" I received from Count Angelo\r\ndi Grubernatis a letter, beginning with the remark that, in consequence\r\nof my _gentile ed insistence premura_, or \"amiable persistence, begun\r\nfour-years ago,\" he has at length carried out my idea and suggestion of\r\nestablishing a great Italian Folklore Society, of which I am to rank as\r\namong the first twelve members.  This is the fourth institution of the\r\nkind which I have been first, or among the first, to found in Europe, and\r\nit has in every case been noted, not without surprise, that I was an\r\nAmerican.  Such associations, being wide-reaching and cosmopolitan, may\r\nbe indeed considered by every man of culture as patriotic, and I hope at\r\nsome future day that I shall still further prove that, as regards my\r\nnative country, I have only changed my sky but not my heart, and laboured\r\nfor American interests as earnestly as ever.\r\n\r\nCHARLES GODFREY LELAND.\r\n\r\nBAGNI DI LUCCA, ITALY, _August 20_, _1893_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Furness--Miss Eliza Leslie--The\r\nboarding-school near Boston--Books--A terrible winter--My first poem--I\r\nreturn to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI was born on the 15th of August, 1824, in a house which was in\r\nPhiladelphia, and in Chestnut Street, the second door below Third Street,\r\non the north side.  It had been built in the old Colonial time, and in\r\nthe room in which I first saw life there was an old chimney-piece, which\r\nwas so remarkable that strangers visiting the city often came to see it.\r\nIt was, I believe, of old carved oak, possibly mediaeval, which had been\r\nbrought from some English manor as a relic.  I am indebted for this\r\ninformation to a Mr. Landreth, who lived in the house at the time. {1}\r\n\r\nIt was then a boarding-house, kept by a Mrs. Rodgers.  She had taken it\r\nfrom a lady who had also kept it for boarders.  The daughter of this\r\nlatter married President Madison.  She was the well-known \"Dolly\r\nMadison,\" famous for her grace, accomplishments, and _belle humeur_, of\r\nwhom there are stories still current in Washington.\r\n\r\nMy authority informed me that there were among the boarders in the house\r\ntwo remarkable men, one of whom often petted me as a babe, and took a\r\nfancy to me.  He was a Swedish Count, who had passed, it was said, a very\r\nwild life as pirate for several years on the Spanish Main.  He was\r\nidentified as the Count Bruno of Frederica Bremer's novel, \"The\r\nNeighbours.\"  The other was the famous philologist, Dufief, author of\r\n\"Nature Displayed,\" a work of such remarkable ability that I wonder that\r\nit should have passed into oblivion.\r\n\r\nMy mother had been from her earliest years devoted to literature to a\r\ndegree which was unusual at that time in the United States.  She had\r\nbeen, as a girl, a special _protegee_ of Hannah Adams, the author of many\r\nlearned works, who was the first person buried in the Mount Auburn\r\nCemetery of Boston.  She directed my mother's reading, and had great\r\ninfluence over her.  My mother had also been very intimate with the\r\ndaughters of Jonathan Russell, the well-known diplomatist.  My maternal\r\ngrandfather was Colonel Godfrey, who had fought in the war of the\r\nRevolution, and who was at one time an aide-de-camp of the Governor of\r\nMassachusetts.  He was noted for the remarkable gentleness of his\r\ncharacter.  I have heard that when he went forth of a morning, all the\r\nanimals on his farm would run to meet and accompany him.  He had to a\r\nmiraculous degree a certain sympathetic power, so that all beings, men\r\nincluded, loved him.  I have heard my mother say that as a girl she had a\r\ntame crow who was named Tom, and that he could distinctly cry the word\r\n\"What?\"  When Tom was walking about in the garden, if called, he would\r\nreply \"What?\" in a perfectly human manner.\r\n\r\nWhen I was one month old, General Lafayette visited our city and passed\r\nin a grand procession before the house.  It is one of the legends of my\r\ninfancy that my nurse said, \"Charley shall see the General too!\" and held\r\nme up to the window.  General Lafayette, seeing this, laughed and bowed\r\nto me.  He was the first gentleman who ever saluted me formally.  When I\r\nreflect how in later life adventure, the study of languages, and a French\r\nRevolution came into my experiences, it seems to me as if Count Bruno,\r\nDufief, and Lafayette had all been premonitors of the future.\r\n\r\nI was a great sufferer from many forms of ill-health in my infancy.\r\nBefore my second birthday, I had a terrible illness with inflammation of\r\nthe brain.  Dr. Dewees (author of a well-known work on diseases of women\r\nand children), who attended me, said that I was insane for a week, and\r\nthat it was a case without parallel.  I mention this because I believe\r\nthat I owe to it in a degree whatever nervousness and tendency to\r\n\"idealism\" or romance and poetry has subsequently been developed in me.\r\nThrough all my childhood and youth its influence was terribly felt, nor\r\nhave I to this day recovered from it.\r\n\r\nI should mention that my first nurse in life was an old Dutch woman named\r\nVan der Poel.  I had not been born many days before I and my cradle were\r\nmissing.  There was a prompt outcry and search, and both were soon found\r\nin the garret or loft of the house.  There I lay sleeping, on my breast\r\nan open Bible, with, I believe, a key and knife, at my head lighted\r\ncandles, money, and a plate of salt.  Nurse Van der Poel explained that\r\nit was done to secure my rising in life--by taking me up to the garret.  I\r\nhave since learned from a witch that the same is still done in exactly\r\nthe same manner in Italy, and in Asia.  She who does it must be, however,\r\na _strega_ or sorceress (my nurse was reputed to be one), and the child\r\nthus initiated will become deep in darksome lore, an adept in _occulta_,\r\nand a scholar.  If I have not turned out to be all of this _in\r\nmajoribus_, it was not the fault of my nurse.\r\n\r\nNext door to us lived a family in which were four daughters who grew up\r\nto be famous belles.  It is said that when the poet N. P. Willis visited\r\nthem, one of these young ladies, who was familiar with his works, was so\r\novercome that she fainted.  Forty years after Willis distinctly recalled\r\nthe circumstance.  Fainting was then fashionable.\r\n\r\nAmong the household friends of our family I can remember Mr. John\r\nVaughan, who had legends of Priestley, Berkeley, and Thomas Moore, and\r\nwho often dined with us on Sunday.  I can also recall his personal\r\nreminiscences of General Washington, Jefferson, and all the great men of\r\nthe previous generation.  He was a gentle and beautiful old man, with\r\nvery courtly manners and snow-white hair, which he wore in a queue.  He\r\ngave away the whole of a large fortune to the poor.  Also an old Mr.\r\nCrozier, who had been in France through all the French Revolution, and\r\nhad known Robespierre, Marat, Fouquier Tinville, &c.  I wish that I had\r\nbetimes noted down all the anecdotes I ever heard from them.  There were\r\nalso two old ladies, own nieces of Benjamin Franklin, who for many years\r\ncontinually took tea with us.  One of them, Mrs. Kinsman, presented me\r\nwith the cotton quilt under which her uncle had died.  Another lady, Miss\r\nLouisa Nancrede, who had been educated in France, had seen Napoleon, and\r\noften described him to me.  She told me many old French fairy-tales, and\r\noften sang a ballad (which I found in after years in the works of\r\nCazotte), which made a great impression on me--something like that of\r\n\"Childe Roland to the dark tower came.\"  It was called _Le Sieur\r\nEnguerrand_, and the refrain was \"_Oh ma bonne j'ai tant peur_.\"\r\n\r\nThat these and many other influences of culture stirred me strangely even\r\nas a child, is evident from the fact that they have remained so vividly\r\nimpressed on my memory.  This reminds me that I can distinctly remember\r\nthat when I was eight years of age, in 1832, my grandmother, Mrs. Oliver\r\nLeland, told my mother that the great German poet Goethe had recently\r\ndied, and that they bade me remember it.  On the same day I read in the\r\n_Athenaeum_ (an American reprint of leading articles, poems, &c., from\r\nEnglish magazines, which grandmother took all her life long) a\r\ntranslation of Schiller's \"Diver.\"  I read it only once, and to this day\r\nI can repeat nearly the whole of it.  I have now by me, as I write, a\r\nsilver messenger-ring of King Robert, and I never see it without thinking\r\nof the corner of the room by the side-door where I stood when grandmother\r\nspoke of the death of Goethe.  But I anticipate.\r\n\r\nMy father was a commission merchant, and had his place of business in\r\nMarket Street below Third Street.  His partner was Charles S. Boker, who\r\nhad a son, George, who will often be mentioned in these Memoirs.  George\r\nbecame in after life distinguished as a poet, and was Minister for many\r\nyears at Constantinople and at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Rodgers' my parents went to Mrs. Shinn's, in Second Street.  It\r\nalso was a very old-fashioned house, with a garden full of flowers, and a\r\nfront doorstep almost on a level with the ground.  The parlour had a\r\nlarge old fireplace, set with blue tiles of the time of Queen Anne, and\r\nit was my delight to study and have explained to me from them the story\r\nof Joseph and his brethren and AEsop's fables.  Everything connected with\r\nthis house recurs to me as eminently pleasant, old-fashioned, and very\r\nrespectable.  I can remember something very English-like among the\r\ngentlemen-boarders who sat after dinner over their Madeira, and a\r\nbeautiful lady, Mrs. Stanley, who gave me a sea-shell.  Thinking of it\r\nall, I seem to have lived in a legend by Hawthorne.\r\n\r\nThere was another change to a Mrs. Eaton's boarding-house in Fifth\r\nStreet, opposite to the side of the Franklin Library.  I can remember\r\nthat there was a very good marine picture by Birch in the drawing-room.\r\nThis was after living in the Washington Square house, of which I shall\r\nspeak anon.  I am not clear as to these removals.  There were some men of\r\nculture at Mrs. Eaton's--among them Sears C. Walker, a great astronomer,\r\nand a Dr. Brewer, who had travelled in Italy and brought back with him\r\npieces of sculpture.  We were almost directly opposite the State House,\r\nwhere liberty had been declared, while to the side, across the street,\r\nwas the Library founded by Dr. Franklin, with his statue over the door.\r\nOne of his nieces often told me that this was an absolutely perfect\r\nlikeness.  The old iron railing, now removed--more's the pity!--surrounded\r\nthe Square, which was full of grand trees.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that the spirit of Dr. Franklin haunted the Library,\r\nreading the books.  Once a coloured woman, who, in darkey fashion, was\r\nscrubbing the floor after midnight, beheld the form.  She was so\r\nfrightened that she fainted.  But stranger still, when the books were\r\nremoved to the New Library in Locust Street, the ghost went with them,\r\nand there it still \"spooks\" about as of yore to this day, as every negro\r\nin the quarter knows.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Franklin and his apparition, there was a schoolboy joke to\r\nthis effect: that _whenever_ the statue of Franklin over the Library door\r\nheard the clock strike twelve at night, it descended, went to the old\r\nJefferson Wigwam, and drank a glass of beer.  But the sell lay in this,\r\nthat a statue cannot hear.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a dim old legend of a colony of Finns, who, in the Swedish\r\ntime, had a village all to themselves in Wiccacoe.  They were men of\r\ndarksome lore and magic skill, and their women were witches, who at tide\r\nand time sailed forth merrily on brooms to the far-away highlands of the\r\nHudson, where they held high revel with their Yankee, Dutch, and Indian\r\ncolleagues of the mystic spell.  David MacRitchie, in a recent work, has\r\nmade a note of this curious offshoot of the old Philadelphia Swedes.\r\n\r\nAnd I can also remember that before a marble yard in Race Street there\r\nwere two large statues of very grim forbidding-looking dogs, of whom it\r\nwas said that when there was any one about to die in the quarter, these\r\nuncanny hounds came down during a nightly storm and howled a death duet.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was very young there still lingered in the minds of those\r\ninvaluable living chronicles (whether bound in sheepskin or in calf), the\r\noldest inhabitants, memories from before the Revolution of the Indian\r\nmarket, when on every Saturday the natives came from their rural\r\nretreats, bringing pelts or skins, baskets, moccasins, _mocos_ or birch\r\nboxes of maple-sugar, feathers, and game for sale.  Then they ranged\r\nthemselves all along the west side of Independence Square, in tents or at\r\ntables, and sold--or were sold themselves--in bargains.  Even now the\r\nSunday-child, or he who is gifted to behold the departed, may see the\r\nghostly forms of Red-men carrying on that weekly goblin market.  Miss\r\nEliza Leslie's memory was full of these old stories, which she had\r\ncollected from old people.\r\n\r\nAs for the black witches, as there were still four negro sorcerers in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1883 (I have their addresses), it may be imagined to what\r\nan extent _Voodoo_ still prevailed among our Ebo-ny men and brothers.  Of\r\none of these my mother had a sad experience.  We had a black cook named\r\nAnn Lloyd, of whom, to express it mildly, one must say that she was \"no\r\ngood.\"  My mother dismissed her, but several who succeeded her left\r\nabruptly.  Then it was found that Ann, who professed to be a witch, had\r\nput a spell of death on all who should take her place.  My mother learned\r\nthis, and when the last black cook gave warning she received a good\r\nadmonition as to a Christian being a slave to the evil one.  I believe\r\nthat this ended the enchantment.  There is or was in South Fifth Street\r\nan African church, over the door of which was the charming inscription,\r\n\"Those who have walked in Darkness have seen a great light.\"  But this\r\nlight has not even yet penetrated to the darksome depths of Lombard or\r\nSouth Streets, if I may believe the strange tales which I have heard,\r\neven of late, of superstition there.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was a very beautiful old-fashioned city in those days, with\r\na marked character.  Every house had its garden, in which vines twined\r\nover arbours, and the magnolia, honeysuckle, and rose spread rich perfume\r\nof summer nights, and where the humming-bird rested, and scarlet tanager\r\nor oriole with the yellow and blue bird flitted in sunshine or in shade.\r\nThen swallows darted at noon over the broad streets, and the mighty\r\nsturgeon was so abundant in the Delaware that one could hardly remain a\r\nminute on the wharf in early morn or ruddy evening without seeing some\r\nsix-foot monster dart high in air, falling on his side with a plash.  In\r\nthe winter-time the river was allowed to freeze over, and then every\r\nschoolboy walked across to Camden and back, as if it had been a\r\npilgrimage or religious duty, while meantime there was always a kind of\r\nRussian carnival on the ice, oxen being sometimes roasted whole, and all\r\nkinds of \"fakirs,\" as they are now termed, selling doughnuts,\r\nspruce-beer, and gingerbread, or tempting the adventurous with\r\nthimblerig; many pedestrians stopping at the old-fashioned inn on Smith's\r\nIsland for hot punch.  Juleps and cobblers, and the \"one thousand and one\r\nAmerican fancy drinks,\" were not as yet invented, and men drank\r\nthemselves unto the devil quite as easily on rum or brandy straight,\r\npeach and honey, madeira and punch, as they now do on more varied\r\ntemptations.  Lager beer was not as yet in the land.  I remember drinking\r\nit in after years in New Street, where a German known as _der dicke\r\nGeorg_ first dealt it in 1848 to our American public.  Maize-whisky could\r\nthen be bought for fifteen cents a gallon; even good \"old rye\" was not\r\nmuch dearer; and the best Havanna cigars until 1840 cost only three cents\r\na-piece.  As they rose in price they depreciated in quality, and it is\r\nnow many years since I have met with a really aromatic old-fashioned\r\nHavanna.\r\n\r\nIt was a very well-shaded, peaceful city, not \"a great village,\" as it\r\nwas called by New Yorkers, but like a pleasant English town of earlier\r\ntimes, in which a certain picturesque rural beauty still lingered.  The\r\ngrand old double houses, with high flights of steps, built by the\r\nColonial aristocracy--such as the Bird mansion in Chestnut Street by\r\nNinth Street--had a marked and pleasing character, as had many of the\r\nquaint black and red-brick houses, whose fronts reminded one of the\r\nchequer-board map of our city.  All of this quiet charm departed from\r\nthem after they were surrounded by a newer and noisier life.  I well\r\nremember one of these fine old Colonial houses.  It had been the old\r\nPenington mansion, but belonged in my early boyhood to Mr. Jones, who was\r\none of my father's partners in business.  It stood at the corner of\r\nFourth and Race Streets, and was surrounded on all sides by a garden.\r\nThere was a legend to the effect that a beautiful lady, who had long\r\nbefore inhabited the house, had been so fond of this garden, that after\r\ndeath her spirit was often seen of summer nights tending or watering the\r\nflowers.  She was a gentle ghost, and the story made a great impression\r\non me.  I still possess a pictured tile from a chimney-piece of this old\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nThe house is gone, but it is endeared to me by a very strange memory.\r\nWhen I was six or seven years of age, I had read Shakespeare's \"Tempest,\"\r\nand duly reflected on it.  The works of Shakespeare were very rare indeed\r\nin Quaker Philadelphia in those days, and much tabooed, but Mr. Jones,\r\nwho had a good library in the great hall upstairs, possessed a set in\r\nlarge folio.  This I was allowed to read, but not to remove from the\r\nplace.  How well I can remember passing my Saturday afternoons reading\r\nthose mighty tomes, standing first on one leg, then on the other for very\r\nweariness, yet absorbed and fascinated!\r\n\r\nAbout this time I was taken to the theatre to see Fannie Kemble in \"Much\r\nAdo About Nothing\"--or it may have been to a play before that time--when\r\nmy father said to me that he supposed I had never heard of Shakespeare.\r\nTo which I replied by repeating all the songs in the \"Tempest.\"  One of\r\nthese, referring to the loves of certain sailors, is not very decent, but\r\nI had not the remotest conception of its impropriety, and so proceeded to\r\nrepeat it.  A saint of virtue must have laughed at such a declamation.\r\n\r\nAs it recurs to me, the spirit which was over Philadelphia in my boyhood,\r\nhouses, gardens, people, and their life, was strangely quiet, sunny, and\r\nquaint, a dream of olden time drawn into modern days.  The Quaker\r\npredominated, and his memories were mostly in the past; ours, as I have\r\noften said, was a city of great trees, which seemed to me to be ever\r\nrepeating their old poetic legends to the wind of Swedes, witches, and\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nAmong the street-cries and sounds, the first which I can remember was the\r\npostman's horn, when I was hardly three years old.  Then there were the\r\nwatchmen, \"who cried the hour and weather all night long.\"  Also a\r\ncoloured man who shouted, in a strange, musical strain which could be\r\nheard a mile:\r\n\r\n   \"_Tra-la-la-la-la-la-loo_.\r\n   Le-mon-ice-cream!\r\n   An'-wanilla-too!\"\r\n\r\nAlso the quaint old Hominy-man:\r\n\r\n   \"De Hominy man is on his way,\r\n      Frum de Navy-Yard!\r\n      Wid his harmony!\"\r\n\r\n   (Spoken) \"Law bess de putty eyes ob de young lady!  Hominy's good fur\r\n   de young ladies!\r\n\r\n   \"De Harmony man is on his way,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAlso, \"Hot-corn!\"  \"Pepper-pot!\"  \"Be-au-ti-ful Clams!\" with the \"Sweep-\r\noh\" cry, and charcoal and muffin bells.\r\n\r\nOne of the family legends was, that being asked by some lady, for whom I\r\nhad very little liking, to come and visit her, I replied with great\r\npoliteness, but also with marked firmness, \"I am very much obliged to\r\nyou, ma'am, and thank you--but I _won't_.\"\r\n\r\nIn Washington Square, three doors from us, at the corner of Walnut\r\nStreet, lived Dr. George McClellan.  He had two sons, one, John, of my\r\nown age, the other, George, who was three years younger.  Both went to\r\nschool with me in later years.  George became a soldier, and finally rose\r\nto the head of the army in the first year of the War of Rebellion, or\r\nEmancipation, as I prefer to term it.\r\n\r\nWashington Square, opposite our house, had been in the olden time a\r\nPotter's Field, where all the victims of the yellow fever pestilence had\r\nbeen interred.  Now it had become a beautiful little park, but there were\r\nlegends of a myriad of white confused forms seen flitting over it in the\r\nnight, for it was a mysterious haunted place to many still, and I can\r\nremember my mother gently reproving one of our pretty neighbours for\r\nrepeating such tales.\r\n\r\nI have dreamy yet very oft-recurring memories of my life in childhood,\r\nas, for instance, that just before I was quite three years old I had\r\ngiven to me a copy of the old New England Primer, which I could not then\r\nread, yet learned from others the rhymes with the quaint little cuts.\r\n\r\n   \"In Adam's fall\r\n   We sin-ned all.\"\r\n\r\n   \"My book and heart\r\n   Shall never part,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAlso of a gingerbread toy, with much sugar, colour, and gilding, and of\r\nlying in a crib and having the measles.  I can remember that I understood\r\nthe meaning of the word _dead_ before that of _alive_, because I told my\r\nnurse that I had heard that Dr. Dewees was dead.  But she replying that\r\nhe was not, but alive, I repeated \"live\" as one not knowing what it\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nI recollect, also, that one day, when poring over the pictures in a toy-\r\nbook, my Uncle Amos calling me a good little boy for so industriously\r\nreading, I felt guilty and ashamed because I could not read, and did not\r\nlike to admit it.  Whatever my faults or follies may be, I certainly had\r\nan innate rectitude, a strong sense of honesty, just as many children\r\nhave the contrary; and this, I believe, is due to inherited qualities,\r\nthough these in turn are greatly modified by early association and\r\ninfluences.  That I also had precocious talent and taste for the\r\nromantic, poetic, marvellous, quaint, supernatural, and humorous, was\r\nsoon manifested.  Even as an infant objects of _bric-a-brac_ and of\r\nantiquity awoke in me an interest allied to passion or awe, for which\r\nthere was no parallel among others of my age.  This was, I believe, the\r\nold spirit which had come down through the ages into my blood--the spirit\r\nwhich inspired Leland the _Flos Grammaticorum_, and after him John\r\nLeland, the antiquary of King Henry VIII., and Chrs. (Charles) Leland,\r\nwho was secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in the time of Charles I.\r\nLet me hereby inform those who think that \"Chrs.\" means Christopher, that\r\nthere has been a Charles in the family since time immemorial, alternated\r\nwith an Oliver since the days of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nJohn Leyland, an Englishman, now living, who is a deep and sagacious\r\nscholar, and the author of the \"Antiquities of the Town of Halifax\" (a\r\nvery clever work), declares that for _four hundred years_ there has not\r\nbeen a generation in which some Leland (or Leyland) of the old Bussli de\r\nLeland stock has not written a work on antiquity or allied to\r\nantiquarianism, though in one case it is a translation of Demosthenes,\r\nand in another a work on Deistical Writers.  He traces the connection\r\nwith his own family of the Henry Leland, my ancestor, a rather prominent\r\npolitical Puritan character in his time, who first went to America in\r\n1636, and acquired land which my grandfather still owned.  It was very\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\nThere is a De la Laund in the roll of Battle Abbey, {13} but John says\r\nour progenitor was _De Bussli_, who came over with the Conqueror, ravaged\r\nall Yorkshire, killing 100,000 men, and who also burned up, perhaps\r\nalive, the 1,000 Jews in the Tower of York.  For these eminent services\r\nto the state he was rewarded with the manor of Leyland, from which he\r\ntook his name.  The very first _complete_ genealogical register of any\r\nAmerican family ever published was that of the Leland family, by Judge\r\nLeland, of Roxbury, Mass. (but for which he was really chiefly indebted\r\nto another of the name), in which it is shown that Henry Leland had had\r\nin 1847 fifteen thousand descendants in America.  In regard to which I am\r\nhonoured with a membership in the Massachusetts Genealogical Society.  The\r\ncrest of Bussli and the rest of us is a raven or crow transfixed by an\r\narrow, with a motto which I dearly love.  It is _Cui debeo_, _fidus_.\r\nVery apropos of this crow or raven is the following: Heinrich Heine, in\r\nhis \"Germany\" (vol. ii. p. 211, Heinemann's edition), compares the same\r\nto priests \"whose pious croaking is so well known to our ears.\"  This is\r\nin reference to such birds which fly about the mountain of Kyffhauser, in\r\nwhich the Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa is sleeping, and where he will\r\nsleep till they disappear.  And then, praising himself, Heine adds: \"But\r\nold age has weakened them, and there are good marksmen who know right\r\nwell how to bring them down.  I know one of these archers, who now lives\r\nin Paris, and who knows how, even from that distance, to hit the crows\r\nwhich fly about the Kyffhauser.  When the Emperor returns to earth, he\r\nwill surely find on his way more than one raven slain by this archer's\r\narrows.  And the old hero will say, smiling, 'That man carried a good\r\nbow.'\"  In my note to this I remarked that \"the raven or crow transfixed\r\nby an arrow is the crest of the coat-of-arms of the name of Leland, or of\r\nmy own.  I sincerely trust that Bussli, the first who bore it, did not\r\nacquire the right to do so by shooting a clergyman.\"  As a single crow is\r\nan omen of ill-luck, so the same transfixed signifies misfortune\r\novercome, or the forcible ending of evil influences by a strong will.  It\r\nis a common belief or saying among all the Lelands, however widely\r\nrelated, that there has never been a convicted criminal of the name.  _Dii\r\nfaxint_!\r\n\r\nAt four years of age, while still living in Washington Square, I was sent\r\nto an infant school in Walnut Street, above Eighth Street, south side,\r\nnear by.  It was kept by the Misses Donaldson.  We all sat in a row, on\r\nsteps, as in an amphitheatre, but in straight lines.  Miss Donaldson,\r\nsenior, sat at a desk, prim and perpendicular, holding a rod which was\r\nfifteen or twenty feet in length, with which she could hit on the head or\r\npoke any noisy or drowsy child, without stirring from her post.  It was\r\nan ingenious invention, and one which might be employed to advantage in\r\nsmall churches.  I can remember that at this time I could not hear a tune\r\nplayed without stringing my thoughts to it; not that I have any special\r\near for music, but because I am moved by melody.  There was a rhyme that\r\nwas often sung to me to the tune of \"Over the Water\"--\r\n\r\n      \"Charley Buff\r\n      Had money enough,\r\n   And locked it in his store;\r\n      Charley die\r\n      And shut his eye,\r\n   And never saw money no more.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of this and other tunes on my thought was so great, that I\r\nhave often wondered whether anybody ever realised how much we may owe to\r\nmetre acting on thought; for I do not believe that I ever penned any\r\npoetry in my life unless it was to a _tune_; and even in this prose which\r\nI now write there is ever and anon a _cadence_ as of a brook running\r\nalong, then rising, anon falling, perceptible to me though not to you,\r\nyet which has many a time been noted down by critics speaking gently of\r\nmy work.  This induced me to learn betimes an incredible number of songs;\r\nin fact, at the age of ten or eleven I had most of Percy's \"Relics\" by\r\nheart.  This naturally enough led me to read, and reading understand, an\r\namount of poetry of such varied character that I speak with strictest\r\ntruth in saying that I have never met with, and never even read of, any\r\nboy who, as a mere little boy, had mastered such a number and variety of\r\nballads and minor poems as I had done--as will appear in the course of\r\nthis narrative.\r\n\r\nWhile living at Mrs. Eaton's I was sent to a school kept by two very nice\r\nrather young Quaker ladies in Walnut Street.  It was just opposite a very\r\nquaint old-fashioned collection of many little dwellings in one (modelled\r\nafter the Fuggerei of Augsburg?) known as the Quaker Almshouse.  One\r\nmorning I played truant, and became so fearfully weary and bored lounging\r\nabout, that I longed for the society of school, and never stayed from\r\nstudy any more.  Here I was learning to read, and I can remember \"The\r\nHistory of Little Jack,\" and discussing with a comrade the question as to\r\nwhether the word _history_ really meant _his_ story, or was ingeniously\r\ndouble and inclusive.  I also about this time became familiar with many\r\nminor works, such as are all now sold at high prices as chap-books, such\r\nas \"Marmaduke Multiply,\" \"The World Turned Upside Down,\"\r\n\"Chrononhotonthologos,\" \"The Noble History of the Giants,\" and others of\r\nMr. Newberry's gilt-cover toy-books.  All of our juvenile literature in\r\nthose days was without exception London made, and very few persons can\r\nnow realise how deeply Anglicised I was, and how all this reading\r\nproduced associations and feelings which made dwelling in England in\r\nlater years seem like a return to a half-forgotten home, of which we\r\nhave, however, pleasant fairy-tale reminiscences.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the school was named Sarah Lewis, and while there,\r\nsomething of a very extraordinary nature--to me, at least--took place.\r\nOne day, while at my little desk, there came into my head with a strange\r\nand unaccountable intensity this thought: \"I am I--I am _Myself_--I\r\nmyself _I_,\" and so on.  By forcing this thought on myself very rapidly,\r\nI produced a something like suspension of thought or syncope; not a\r\nvertigo, but that mental condition which is allied to it.  I have several\r\ntimes read of men who recorded nearly the same thing among their youthful\r\nexperiences, but I do not recall that any of them induced this _coma_ by\r\nreflecting on the ego-ism of the I, or the me-ness of the Me. {16}  It\r\noften recurred to me in after years when studying Schelling and Fichte,\r\nor reading works by Mystics, Quietists, and the like.  At a very early\r\nage I was indeed very much given to indulging in states of mind\r\nresembling metaphysical abstraction--a kind of vague marvelling what I\r\n_was_ and what others were; whether they and everything were not spirits\r\nplaying me tricks, or a delusion--a kind of psychology without material\r\nor thought, like a workman without tools.\r\n\r\nFor a short time, while five or six years old, and living at Mrs.\r\nEaton's, I was sent to a school of boys of all ages, kept by a man named\r\nEastburn, in Library Street, whom I can only recall as a coarse, brutal\r\nfiend.  From morning to night there was not a minute in which some boy\r\nwas not screaming under the heavy rattan which he or his brother always\r\nheld.  I myself--infant as I was--for not learning a spelling-lesson\r\nproperly, was subjected to a caning which would have been cruel if\r\ninflicted on a convict or sailor.  In the lower story this man's sister\r\nkept a girls' school, and the ruffian was continually being called\r\ndownstairs to beat the larger girls.  My mother knew nothing of all this,\r\nand I was ashamed to tell that I had been whipped.  I have all my life\r\nbeen opposed to corporal punishment, be it in schools or for criminals.\r\nIt brings out of boys all that is evil in their nature and nothing that\r\nis good, developing bullying and cruelty, while it is eminently\r\nproductive of cowardice, lying, and meanness--as I have frequently found\r\nwhen I came to hear the private life of those who defend it as creating\r\n\"manliness.\"  It was found during the American war that the soldiers who\r\nhad been most accustomed to beating and to being beaten were by far the\r\ngreatest cowards, and that \"Billy Wilson's\" regiment of pugilists was so\r\nabsolutely worthless as to be unqualified for the field at any time.  One\r\nthing is very certain, that I have found that boys who attend schools\r\nwhere there is no whipping, and little or no fighting, are freest from\r\nthat _coarseness_ which is so invariably allied to meanness, lying, and\r\ndishonesty.  I had about 2000 children in the _public schools_ of\r\nPhiladelphia pass under my teaching, and never met with but one instance\r\nof direct rudeness.  There was also only one of dishonesty or theft, and\r\nthat was by a fighting boy, who looked like a miniature pugilist.\r\nPhiladelphia manners were formed by Quakers.  When I visited, in 1884,\r\ncertain minor art-work classes established in the East End of London, Mr.\r\nWalter Besant said to me that I would find a less gentle set of pupils.\r\nIn fact, in the first school which I examined, the girls had, the week\r\nbefore, knocked down, kicked, and trampled on an elderly lady who had\r\ncome to teach them art-work out of pure benevolence.  I am often told\r\nthat whipping put an end to garroting.  If this be true, which it is\r\n_not_ (for garroting was a merely temporary fancy, which died out in\r\nAmerica without whipping), it only proves that the garotters, who were\r\nall fighting and boxing roughs, were mere cowards.  Red Indians never\r\nwhip children, but they will die under torture without a groan.\r\n\r\nMy parents were from Massachusetts, and every summer they returned to\r\npass several months in or near Boston, generally with their relatives in\r\nWorcester county, in Dedham, in the \"Hub\" itself, or in Milford, Mendon,\r\nor Holliston, the home of my paternal grandfather, Oliver Leland.  Thus I\r\ngrew to be familiar with New England, its beautiful scenery and\r\nold-fashioned Yankee rural ways.  Travelling was then by stage-coach, and\r\nit took two days to go from Philadelphia to Boston, stopping on the way\r\novernight at Princeton, Perth Amboy, or Providence.  This is to me a very\r\ninteresting source of reminiscences.  In Dedham, for three summers, I\r\nattended school.  I remember that we stayed with Dr. Jeremy Stimson, who\r\nhad married a sister of my mother.  I studied French; and can recall that\r\nmy cousins Caroline and Emily, who were very beautiful young ladies,\r\ngenerally corrected my exercises.  I was then seven or eight years of\r\nage.  Also that I was very much alone; that I had a favourite bow, made\r\nby some old Indian; that I read with great relish \"Gil Blas\" and \"Don\r\nQuixote,\" and especially books of curiosities and oddities which had a\r\ngreat influence on me.  I wandered for days by myself fishing, strolling\r\nin beautiful wild places among rocks and fields, or in forests by the\r\nRiver Charles.  I can remember how one Sunday during service I sat in\r\nchurch unseen behind the organ, and read Benvenuto Cellini's account of\r\nthe sorcerer in the Colosseum in Rome: I shall see his Perseus ten\r\nminutes hence in the Signoria of Florence, where I now write.\r\n\r\nThen there were the quiet summer evenings in the drawing-room, where my\r\ncousins played the piano and sang \"The Sunset Tree,\" \"Alknoomuk,\" \"I see\r\nthem on the winding way,\" and Moore's melodies.  _Tempi passati_--\"'Tis\r\nsixty year's since.\"  Caroline meantime married a Mr. Wight, who had\r\npassed most of his life in England, and was thoroughly Anglicised.  There\r\nwas also an English lady visiting America who stayed a while in Dedham to\r\nbe with my cousin.  She was _jeune encore_, but had with her a young\r\nEnglish gentleman relative who _would_ call her \"Mamma!\" which we thought\r\nrather _niais_.  From my reading and my few experiences I, however,\r\nacquired a far greater insight into life than most boys would have done,\r\nfor I remembered and thought long over everything I heard or learned.\r\nBetween my mother and cousins and our visitors there was much reading and\r\ndiscussion of literary topics, and I listened to more than any one noted,\r\nand profited by it.\r\n\r\nI was always reading and mentally reviewing.  If my mother made a call, I\r\nwas at once absorbed in the first book which came to hand.  Thus I can\r\nremember that one summer, when we came to Dr. Stimson's, during the brief\r\ninterval of our being shown into the \"parlour,\" I seized on a Unitarian\r\nliterary magazine and read the story of Osapho, the Egyptian who trained\r\nparrots to cry, \"Osapho is a god!\"  Also an article on Chinese\r\nacupuncture with needles to cure rheumatism; which chance readings and\r\nreminiscences I could multiply _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nMy cousin Caroline, whom I remember as very beautiful and refined, with a\r\n_distinguee_ manner, had a small work-box, on the cover of which was a\r\npicture of the Pavilion in Brighton.  She spoke of the building as a\r\nrubbishy piece of architecture; but I, who felt it through the \"Arabian\r\nNights,\" admired it, and pitied her want of taste.  _Now_ I have lived\r\naltogether three years in Brighton, but I never saw the Pavilion without\r\nrecalling the little yellow work-box.  In some mysterious way the picture\r\nseems to me to be grander than the original.  Dickens has expressed this\r\nidea.  I was too grave and earnest as a child to be called a cheerful or\r\nhappy one, which was partly due to much ill-health; yet, by a strange\r\ncontradiction not uncommon in America, I was gifted with a precociously\r\nkeen sense of humour, and not only read, but collected and preserved\r\nevery comic almanac and scrap of droll anecdote which I could get.  Thus\r\nthere came into my possession half-a-dozen books of the broadest London\r\nhumour of the time, all of which entered into my soul; such things as:--\r\n\r\n   '\"Ladies in furs and gemmen in spurs,\r\n      Who lollop and lounge all day;\r\n   The Bazaar in Soho is completely the go,\r\n      Walk into the shop of Grimaldi.\"\r\n\r\nReader mine, you can have no conception how deeply I, as a mere little\r\nboy, entered into and knew London life and society from such songs,\r\nsketches, anecdotes, books, and caricatures as I met with.  Others read\r\nand forget them, but I took such trifles deep into my soul and _dwelt_ on\r\nthem.  It is only of late years, since I have lived in England, that I\r\nhave learned how extensively--I may say incredibly well--I was informed\r\nfor my age as to many phases of English life.  Few of us know what may be\r\ngot out of reading the current light literature of the day, if we only\r\nread it _earnestly_ and get it by heart.  This I did to a great extent,\r\nas my reminiscences continually awakened in England prove.\r\n\r\nThere was in Dedham a very old house of somewhat superior style, which\r\nhad been built, if not in 1630, at least within a very few years after.\r\nIt was inhabited by three sisters named Fairbanks, who were very peculiar\r\nindeed, and their peculiarity consisted in a strange devotion to the\r\npast, and above all to old _English_ memories of colonial times before\r\nthe Revolution.  Even in England this resistance can hardly be understood\r\nat the present day, and yet it may still be found alive in New England.\r\nIn the house itself was a well, dug to supply water when besieged by\r\nIndians, and the old ladies used to exhibit an immense old gun once used\r\nby Puritans, and an ox-saddle and other relics.  They had also a very\r\nancient book of prayer of the Church of England, and an old Bible, and\r\nthereby hangs a tale.  They were all still living in 1849 or 1850, when I\r\nvisited them with my very pretty cousin Mary Elizabeth Fisher, and as I\r\nprofessed the Episcopal faith, and had been in England, the precious\r\nrelics were shown to me as to one of the initiated.  But they showed a\r\nmarked aversion to letting Miss Fisher see them, as she was a Unitarian.\r\nSo they went on, as many others did in my youth, still staunch adherents\r\nto England, nice old Tories, believers in the King or Queen, for whom\r\nthey prayed, and not in the President.  I remember that Miss Eliza Leslie\r\ntold me in later years of just such another trio.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather in Holliston was, as his father and brothers and uncles\r\nhad all been, an old Revolutionary soldier, who had been four years in\r\nthe war and taken part in many battles.  He had been at Princeton (where\r\nI afterwards graduated) and Saratoga, and witnessed the surrender of\r\nBurgoyne to Gates.  I was principally concerned to know whether the\r\nconqueror had _kept the sword_ handed to him on this occasion, and was\r\nrather disappointed to learn that it was given back.  Once I found in the\r\ngarret a bayonet which my grandma said had been carried by grandfather in\r\nthe war.  I turned it with a broom-handle into a lance and made ferocious\r\ncharges on the cat and hens.\r\n\r\nThis grandfather, Oliver Leland, exerted an extraordinary influence on\r\nme, and one hard to describe.  He was great, grim, and taciturn to\r\nbehold, yet with a good heart, and not devoid of humour.  He was gouty,\r\nand yet not irritable.  He continually recurs to me while reading\r\nIcelandic sagas, and as a kind of man who would now be quite out of the\r\nage anywhere.  All his early associations had been of war and a half-wild\r\nlife.  He was born about 1758, and therefore in a rude age in rural New\r\nEngland.  He, I may say, deeply interested me.\r\n\r\nAll boys are naturally full of the romance of war; the Revolution was to\r\nus more than the Crusades and all chivalry combined, and my grandfather\r\nwas a living example and chronicle of all that I most admired.  Often I\r\nsat on a little cricket at his feet, and listened to tales of battles,\r\nscoutings, and starving; how he had been obliged to live on raw wheat,\r\nwhich produced evil results, and beheld General Washington and other\r\ngreat men, and had narrow escapes from Indians, and been at the capturing\r\nof a fort by moonlight, and seen thousands of pounds' worth of stores\r\ndestroyed.  I frequently thought of old grandfather Oliver when \"out\"\r\nmyself during the Civil War, and was half-starved and chilled when\r\nscouting, or when doing rough and tough in West Virginia.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather often told me such stories of the war, and others of his\r\nfather and grandfather, who had fought before him in the old French war\r\nin Canada, and how the latter, having gone up to trade among the Indians\r\none winter, endeared himself so much to them that they would not let him\r\ngo, and kept him a captive until the next summer.  I came across traces\r\nof this ancestor in an old Canadian record, wherein it appears that he\r\nonce officiated as interpreter in the French and Indian tongues.  Whereby\r\ncritics may remark that learning French and Algonkin runs in our blood,\r\nand that my proclivity for Indians is legitimately inherited.  I would\r\nthat I knew all the folklore that my great-grandsire heard in the Indian\r\nwigwams in those old days!\r\n\r\nI can remember seeing my grandfather once sitting and talking with five\r\nother veterans of the war.  But I saw them daily in those times, and once\r\nseveral hundreds, or it may be thousands, of them in a great procession\r\nin Philadelphia in 1832.  And here I may mention that in 1834 I often saw\r\none named Rice, whose age, as authenticated by his pension papers, was\r\n106, and that in 1835 I shook hands with Thomas Hughes, aged 95, who was\r\nthe last survivor of the Boston Tea party.  He had come to visit our\r\nschool, and how we boys cheered the old gentleman, who was in our eyes\r\none of the greatest men alive!  But all the old folk in my boyhood could\r\ntell tales of the Revolution, which was indeed not very much older then\r\nthan the Rebellion is to us now.\r\n\r\nI can also recollect seeing Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the last of\r\nthe signers of the Declaration of Independence, though my memory of the\r\nman is now confused with that of a very perfect portrait which belonged\r\nto his granddaughter, Mrs. Jackson, who was a next-door but one neighbour\r\nin after years in Walnut Street, Philadelphia.  He was a very venerable-\r\nlooking man.\r\n\r\nMy father served for a short time in the war of 1812, and I have heard\r\nhim relate that when the startling news of peace arrived in Boston, where\r\nhe was, he at once took a sleigh and fast horses and drove full speed,\r\nbeing the first to disseminate the news in the country.  That was as good\r\nas Browning's \"Ride to Ghent\" in its way--_apropos_ of which Mr. Browning\r\nonce startled me by telling me, \"I suppose you know that it is an\r\ninvention of mine, and not founded on any real incident.\"  But my\r\nfather's headlong sleigh-ride--he was young and wild in those days--was\r\nreal and romantic enough in all conscience.  It set bells to ringing,\r\nmultitudes to cheering, bonfires a-blazing on hills and in towns, and\r\nalso some few to groaning, as happened to a certain old deacon, who had\r\ninvested his all in English goods, and said, when he heard the cheers\r\ncaused by the news, \"Wife, if that's war news, I'm saved; but if it's\r\npeace, I'm ruined!\"  Even so it befell me, in after years, to be the\r\nfirst person to announce in the United States, far in advance of any\r\nothers, the news of the French Revolution of 1848, as I shall fully prove\r\nin the sequence.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked, that, though not \"professionals,\" all of our\r\nfamily, without a break in the record, have successively taken turns at\r\nfighting, and earned our pay as soldiers, since time lost in oblivion;\r\nfor I and my brother tried it on during the Rebellion, wherein he indeed,\r\nstanding by my side, got the wound from a shell of which he eventually\r\ndied; while there were none who were not in the old Indian wars or the\r\nEnglish troubles of Charles the Second and First, and so on back, I dare\r\nsay, to the days of Bussli de Leland, who laid all Yorkshire waste.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, though not wealthy, owned a great deal of land, and I can\r\nremember that he one afternoon showed me a road, saying that he owned the\r\nland on each side for a mile.  I myself, in after years, however, came to\r\nown in fee-simple a square mile of extremely rich land in Kansas, which I\r\nsold for sixteen hundred dollars, while my grandfather's was rather of\r\nthat kind by which men's poverty was measured in Virginia--that is to\r\nsay, the more land a man had the poorer he was considered to be.  It is\r\nrelated of one of these that he once held great rejoicing at having got\r\nrid of a vast property by the ingenious process of giving some person one\r\nhalf of it to induce him to take the other.  However, as there is now a\r\nlarge town or small city on my grandfather's whilom estate, I wish that\r\nit could have been kept.  _Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan_, or the\r\nducats of Panurge?\r\n\r\nThere was a \"home-pasture,\" a great field behind my grandfather's house,\r\nwhere I loved to sit alone, and which has left a deep impression on my\r\nmemory, as though it were a fairy-haunted or imagined place.  It was very\r\nrocky, the stones being covered with clean, crisp, dry lichens, and in\r\none spot there was the gurgling deep down in some crevice of a mysterious\r\nunseen spring or rivulet.  Young as I was, I had met with a line which\r\nbore on it--\r\n\r\n   \"Deep from their vaults the Loxian murmurs flow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was something very voice-like or human in this murmur or\r\nchattering of the unseen brook.  This I distinctly remember, that the\r\nplace gave me not only a feeling, but a faith that it was haunted by\r\nsomething gentle and merry.  I went there many a time for company, being\r\nmuch alone.  An Indian would have told me that it was the _Un a games-\r\nsuk_--the spirit-fairies of the rock and stream.  These beings enter far\r\nmore largely, deeply, and socially into their life or faith than elves or\r\nfairies ever did into those of the Aryan races, and I might well have\r\nbeen their _protege_, for there could have been few little boys living,\r\nso fond as I was of sitting all alone by rock and river, hill and\r\ngreenwood tree.  There are yet in existence on some of this land which\r\nwas once ours certain mysterious walls or relics of heavy stone-work,\r\nwhich my friend Eben C. Horsford thinks were made by the Norsemen.  I\r\nhope that they were, for I have read many a saga in Icelandic, old\r\nSwedish, and Latin, and the romance thereof is deep in my soul; and as my\r\nown name is Godfrey, it is no wonder that the god Frey and his Freya are\r\ndear to me.  In my boyhood--and it may be still the case--the \"Injuns\"\r\ngot the credit of having built these mysterious works.\r\n\r\nNot far from Holliston is Mendon, where I had an uncle, Seth Davenport,\r\nwho had a large, pleasant, old-fashioned New England farm, which was more\r\nproductive than my grandfather's, since there were employed on it sixteen\r\nmen, three of whom were Natick Indians of the old local stock.  There\r\nwere many of them when my mother was young, but I suppose that the last\r\nof the tribe has long since died.  One of these Indians, Rufus Pease, I\r\ncan recall as looking like a dark-ruddy gypsy, with a pleasant smile.  He\r\nvery was fond of me.  He belonged to a well-known family, and had a\r\nbrother--and thereby hangs a tale, or, in this case, a scalp-lock.\r\n\r\n\"Marm\" Pease, the mother of Rufus, had on one occasion been confined, and\r\nold Doctor--I forget his name--who officiated at the birth, had been\r\nasked to give the infant a name.  Now he was a dry wag, of the kind so\r\ndear to Dr. Holmes, and expressed much gratification and gratitude at\r\nsuch a compliment being paid to him.  \"He had long been desirous,\" he\r\nsaid, \"of naming a child after his dear old friend, Dr. Green.\"  So the\r\nname was bestowed, the simple Indians not realising for some time after\r\nthe christening that their youngest bore the name of Green Pease.  Whether\r\nhe was ever called a duck, I know not.\r\n\r\nEverything about Uncle Seth and Aunt Betsy was, as I remember,\r\ndelightfully comfortable, old-fashioned, and in a way beautiful.  There\r\nwas their daughter Rebecca, who was pretty and gentle, so that several\r\nwild birds came every morning to feed from her hand and perch on her\r\nfingers.  Uncle Seth himself wore a scarlet waistcoat, and, as I recall\r\nhim, seemed altogether in figure to belong to the time of Cromwell, or to\r\nearlier days.  There was a hall, hung round with many old family\r\nportraits in antique dresses, and an immense dairy--the pride of Aunt\r\nBetsy's heart--and a garden, in which I was once shown a humming-bird's\r\nnest; and cousin Rebecca's mantelpiece, over a vast old fireplace, heaped\r\nwith mosses, birds' nests, shells, and such curiosities as a young girl\r\nwould gather in the woods and fields; and the cider-press, in which Uncle\r\nSeth ground up the sixteen hundred bushels of apples which he had at one\r\ncrop, and the new cider gushing in a stream, whereof I had a taste.  It\r\nwas a charming, quiet old homestead, in which books and culture were not\r\nwanting, and it has all to me now something of the chiaroscuro and\r\nRembrandt colour and charm of the _Mahrchen_ or fairy-tale.  The reality\r\nof this charm is apt to go out of life as that of literature or culture\r\ncomes in.  To this day I draw the deepest impression or sentiment of the\r\n_pantheism_ or subtle spiritual charm of Nature far more from these early\r\nexperiences of rural life than from all the books, poetry included, which\r\nI have ever perused.  Note this well, ye whose best feelings are only a\r\n_rechauffe_ of Ruskin and Browning--_secundem ordinem_--for I observe\r\nthat those who do not think at second hand are growing rare.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Milford lived my uncle, William Godfrey, with my aunt\r\nNancy, and of them and their home I have many pleasant memories.  The\r\nvery first of them all was not so pleasant to me at the time.  My parents\r\nhad just arrived, and had not been ten minutes in the house ere a\r\ntremendous squall was heard, and my mother, looking from the window,\r\nbeheld me standing in the open barn-door holding a tiny chicken in my\r\nright hand, while an old hen sat on my head flapping her wings and\r\npecking me in wrath.  I, seeing the brood, had forthwith captured one,\r\nand for that was undergoing penance.  It was a beautiful tableau, which\r\nwas never forgotten!  We went there on visits for many summers.  Uncle\r\nWilliam was a kind-hearted, \"sportive\" man, who took _Bell's Life_, and I\r\ncan remember that there was a good supply of English reading in the\r\nhouse.  My uncle had three sons, all much older than I.  The eldest,\r\nStearns, was said to have first popularised the phrase \"posted up,\" to\r\nsignify well-informed.  The second, Benjamin, became in after years a\r\ngreat manufacturer and somewhat noted politician, and owner of a famous\r\nracehorse.  The third, Samuel, went into business in Philadelphia, and\r\ncrossed the Atlantic with me.  He died quite young.  All of them, like\r\ntheir father and grandfather, were very good-natured or gentle, and men\r\nof perfect integrity.  The Lelands, however, were rather _dour_ and grim\r\nin their honesty, or more Northern than the Godfreys.  This was accounted\r\nfor by the fact, that while my father's family was Puritan of the purest,\r\nand only intermarried with Puritan stock, the Godfreys had in Rhode\r\nIsland received an infusion of French Huguenot blood, which was indeed\r\nvery perceptible in their faces and lively pleasant manner.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange tradition, to which my mother sometimes jestingly\r\nreferred, that there had been among her Rhode Island ancestors a High\r\nGerman (_i.e._, not a Hollander) doctor, who had a reputation as a\r\nsorcerer or wizard.  He was a man of learning, but that is all I ever\r\nheard about him.  My mother's opinion was that this was a very strong\r\ncase of atavism, and that the mysterious ancestor had through the ages\r\ncropped out again in me.  Something tells me that this was the High\r\nGerman doctor who, according to Washington Irving, laid the mystic spell\r\non Sleepy Hollow, which made of it such a pleasant, ancient, dreamy fairy-\r\nland.  Whether his friendly spirit still watches over me, or whether I am\r\nthe man himself, is a problem which I leave to my friend Francis Galton,\r\nwho indeed personally often reminds me of Irving.  High German sorcerers\r\nwere not common in those days north of Pennsylvania, so that I trow mine\r\nwas the very man referred to by Geoffrey Crayon.  And it is true beyond\r\nall doubt that even in infancy, as I have often heard, there was a quaint\r\nuncanniness, as of something unknown, in my nature, and that I differed\r\nin the main totally from every relative, and indeed from any other little\r\nboy, known to anybody; though I was a perfect Godfrey in face when very\r\nyoung, as I am now a typical Leland.  I was always given to loneliness in\r\ngardens and woods when I could get into them, and to hearing words in\r\nbirds' songs and running or falling water; and I once appalled a visitor\r\nby professing seriously that I could determine for him some question as\r\nto what would happen to him by divination with a bullet in an Indian\r\nmoccasin.  We had two servants who spoke old Irish; one was an\r\ninexhaustible mine of legends, which she related to me--she surpassed\r\nCroker; the other, less versed, still knew a great deal, and told me how\r\nher own father, Jackey Mooney, had seen the fairies with his own eyes.\r\nBoth of these sincerely and seriously regarded me as \"gifted\" or elfin-\r\nfavoured, and the latter said in proof thereof, \"Only listen to his\r\nvoice; sure whin he spakes he'd while a burred aff a tree.\"  For my\r\nuncanny ways made a deep impression on them, as also on the darkies.\r\n\r\nOnce I had a wonderful dream.  I thought that I was in Dr. Furness's\r\nchapel, but that, instead of the gentle reverend clergyman, the devil\r\nhimself was in the pulpit preaching.  Feeling myself inspired, I went up\r\ninto the pulpit, threw the Evil One out, and preached myself in his\r\nplace.  Now our nurse had a dream-book, and made some pretence to mystic\r\nfairy knowledge learned in Kilkenny, and she interpreted this dream as\r\nsignifying that I would greatly rise in this world, and do strange\r\nthings.  But she was greatly struck with such a vision in such an infant.\r\n\r\nNow, I was a great reader of Scripture; in fact, I learned a great deal\r\ntoo much of it, believing now that for babes and sucklings about\r\none-third of it had better be expurgated.  The Apocrypha was a favourite\r\nwork, but above all I loved the Revelations, a work which, I may say by\r\nthe way, is still a treasure to be investigated as regards the marvellous\r\nmixture of Neo-Platonic, later Egyptian (or Gnostic), and even Indian\r\nBuddhistic ideas therein.  Well, I had learned from it a word which St.\r\nJohn applies (to my mind very vulgarly and much too frequently) to the\r\nScarlet Lady of Babylon or Rome.  What this word meant I did not know,\r\nbut this I understood, that it was \"sass\" of some kind, as negroes term\r\nit, and so one day I applied it experimentally to my nurse.  Though the\r\nword was not correctly pronounced, for I had never heard it from anybody,\r\nits success was immediate, but not agreeable.  The passionate Irish woman\r\nflew into a great rage and declared that she would \"lave the house.\"  My\r\nmother, called in, investigated the circumstances, and found that I\r\nreally had no idea whatever of the meaning of what I had said.  Peace was\r\nrestored, but Annie declared that only the divil or the fairies could\r\nhave inspired such an infant to use such language.\r\n\r\nI was very fond of asking my nurse to sing in old Irish or to teach me\r\nIrish words.  This she did, but agreed with her sister Biddy that it was\r\nall very uncanny, and that there must have been a time when I was\r\nperfectly familiar with the owld language, as I had such unearthly\r\nfondness for it.\r\n\r\nI must have been about seven years old when my parents took a house in\r\nArch Street, above Ninth Street, Philadelphia.  Here my life begins to be\r\nmore marked and distinct.  I was at first sent, _i.e._, walked daily to\r\nthe school of Jacob Pierce, a worthy Quaker, who made us call him Jacob,\r\nand who carefully taught us all the ordinary branches, and gave us\r\nexcellent lectures on natural philosophy and chemistry with experiments,\r\nand encouraged us to form mineralogical collections, but who objected to\r\nour reading history, \"because there were so many battles in it.\"  In\r\nwhich system of education all that is good and bad, or rather _weak_, in\r\nQuakerism is fully summed up.  Like the Roman Catholic, it is utterly\r\nunfit for _all_ the world, and incapable of grappling with or adapting\r\nitself to the natural expansion of science and the human mind.  Thus the\r\nQuaker garb, which was originally intended by its simplicity to avoid the\r\nappearance of eccentricity or peculiarity (most dress in the time of the\r\nStuarts being extravagant), has now become, by merely sticking to old\r\ncustom, the most eccentric dress known.  The school was in a very large\r\ngarden, in which was a gymnasium, and in the basement of the main\r\nbuilding there was a carpenter's shop with a turning-lathe, where boys\r\nwere allowed to work as a reward for good conduct.\r\n\r\nI could never learn the multiplication table.  There are things which the\r\nmind, like the stomach, spasmodically rejects without the least\r\nperceptible cause or reason.  So I have found it to be with certain words\r\nwhich _will_ not be remembered.  There was one Arab word which I verily\r\nbelieve I looked out one hundred times in the dictionary, and repeated a\r\nthousand, yet never could keep it.  Every teacher should be keen to\r\ndetect these antipathies, and cure them by gentle and persuasive means.\r\nUnfortunately no one in my youth knew any better way to overcome them\r\nthan by \"keeping me in\" after school to study, when I was utterly weary\r\nand worn--a very foolish punishment, as is depriving a boy of his meals,\r\nor anything else levelled at Nature.  I think there must have been many\r\nmonths of time, and of as much vain and desperate effort on my part to\r\nremember, wasted on my early arithmetic.  Now I can see that by _rewards_\r\nor inducements, and by the very simple process of only learning \"one time\r\none is one\" for the first lesson, and that and one line more for the\r\nsecond, I could have mastered the whole book in time.  But oh! the weary,\r\ndreary days, and the sad waste of time, and the anxious nervous\r\nsuffering, which arithmetic cost me in my youth, and mathematics in after\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nBut there was one class at Jacob's in which I was _facile-princeps_ and\r\nhabitual past-grand-master.  This was the class which was, like the\r\nprofessorship of Diogenes Teufelsdrockh, for Matters and Things in\r\nGeneral.  That is to say, we read aloud from some book--it may have been\r\nselections from English writers--and then Jacob, picking out the hard\r\nwords or facts or phrases, required of them definition or explanation.\r\nOne day there arose in these questions a sum in arithmetic, when I shot\r\ndown to the tail of the class as a plummet drops to the bottom of the\r\nwell.  I shall never forget the proud fierce impatience which I felt,\r\nlike an imprisoned chieftain who knows that he will speedily be delivered\r\nand take dire vengeance on his foes.  I had not long to wait.\r\n\"'Refectory,' what is a 'refectory'?  Hillburn Jones, does thee know?\r\nJoseph Widdifield, does thee?\"  But none of them knew till it came to me\r\n\"down tail,\" when I cried \"An oyster-cellar.\"  \"That is quite right,\r\nCharley; thee can go up head,\" said Jacob, and as I passed Hillburn Jones\r\nhe whispered, half in fun, half enviously, the \"Kemble Refectory.\"  This\r\nwas an oyster-cellar which had been recently opened under the Arch Street\r\nTheatre, and whence Hillburn and I had derived our knowledge of the word,\r\nthe difference being that I remembered more promptly and risked more\r\nboldly.  But I missed it one day when I defined a _peasant_ as \"a nest\r\nfull of young birds;\" the fact being that I recalled a picture in AEsop's\r\nfables, and confused _peasant_ with _pheasant_.  One day Jacob rebuked\r\nthe class for letting me always be at their head, when Hillburn Jones,\r\nwho was a very honest little boy, said, \"Indeed, Jacob, thee must know\r\nthat all that we do know, Charley tells us.\"  For I was already an\r\ninsatiable reader, and always recalling what I read, and always\r\ncommunicating my knowledge to others in the form of small lectures.  I\r\nhad a book of Scripture stories, with a picture of Pharaoh in his\r\nchariot, with the title, \"Pharaoh's host sunk in the Red Sea.\"  Hence I\r\nconcluded that a _host_ was a vehicle of a very superior description.  A\r\ncarriage-builder in our neighbourhood had executed a chaise of very\r\nunusual magnificence, and as I stood admiring it I informed Hillburn that\r\nthis was what was called by the learned a _host_, and that it was in such\r\na host that Pharaoh perished.  I remember elevating my voice somewhat for\r\nthe benefit of a bystander, being somewhat proud of this bit of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not only my father, but also my teacher, and with them the\r\nentire population of North America, in those days regarded a good\r\nknowledge of arithmetic as forming nine-tenths of all that was most\r\nneedful in education, while indulgence in a taste for general\r\ninformation, and \"literature\" especially, was glared at with a very evil\r\neye indeed, as tending to injure a \"practical business man.\"  That there\r\ncould be any kind of profitable or respectable calling not based upon\r\narithmetic did not enter into the heart of man to conceive, while among\r\nthe bankers and merchants of Boston, New York, or Philadelphia there was\r\na deeply-seated conviction that even a wealthy and successful editor,\r\nliterary man, or artist, was really an inferior as compared to\r\nthemselves.  As this sublime truth was severely rubbed into me several\r\ntimes daily during the greater portion of my youthful life, and as in its\r\nearlier stage I rarely met with a man grown who did not look down on me\r\nas an unfortunate non-arithmetical, unbusinesslike creature, and let me\r\nknow it too, I very naturally grew up with a low estimate of my own\r\ncapacities; and as I was proud and sensitive, this was to me a source of\r\nmuch suffering, which often became terrible as I advanced in years.  But\r\nat that time the position of the literary man or scholar, with the\r\nexception of a very few brilliant magnates who had \"made money,\" was in\r\nthe United States not an enviable one.  Serious interest in art and\r\nletters was not understood, or so generally sympathised with, as it now\r\nis in \"Quakerdelphia.\"  There was a gentleman in Philadelphia who was a\r\nscholar, and who having lived long abroad, had accumulated a very curious\r\nblack-letter and _rariora_ library.  For a long time I observed that this\r\nlibrary was never mentioned in polite circles without significant smiles.\r\nOne day I heard a lady say very meaningly, \"I suppose that you know what\r\nkind of books he has _and how he obtained them_?\"  So I inquired very\r\nnaturally if he had come by them dishonestly.  To which the reply, half-\r\nwhispered in my ear lest it should be overheard, was, \"They say his books\r\nare all _old_ things, which he did not buy at any first-class stores, but\r\npicked up at old stalls and in second-hand shops at less than their\r\nvalue; in fact, _they did not cost him much_.\"\r\n\r\nYet these remarks must not be regarded as too sweeping or general.\r\nFirstly, I am speaking of sixty years since.  Secondly, there were many\r\npeople of literary tastes in Philadelphia--a little isolated, it is true;\r\nand finally, there was a great culture of science, founded by Franklin,\r\nand fostered by the medical schools.  I could cite a brilliant array of\r\nnames of men distinguished in these matters.  What I am writing is simply\r\na sincere record of my own--somewhat peculiar--or personal experiences.\r\nThere are doubtless many who would write very differently.  And now times\r\nare _very_ greatly changed.\r\n\r\nI have again a quaint early reminiscence.  It would happen that now and\r\nthen a new carriage, always of the same sober description, with two very\r\ngood, but seldom showy, horses would appear in the streets.  Then its\r\nowner would be greeted on Market Street with the remark, \"Well, Sammy, I\r\nsee thee's got thee fifty thousand dollars.\"  This sum--ten thousand\r\npounds--constituted the millionaireism or moneyed aristocracy of those\r\ndays.  On it, with a thriving business, Samuel could maintain a family in\r\ngood fashion, and above all, in great comfort, which was sensibly\r\nregarded as better than fashion or style.  Fifty thousand dollars\r\nentitled a man to keep a carriage and be classed as \"quality\" by the\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth noting that although the Quakers did not allow the piano\r\nin their families, as being too worldly, they compromised by having\r\nmusical boxes.  And I have heard that in the country, where still older\r\nfashioned ideas prevailed, the one bit of finery allowed to a Quaker\r\ndamsel was a red ribbon; but it must be red, not of any other colour.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that at this time Philadelphia, and even the world,\r\nwere as yet to a great degree in the Middle Ages as compared to the\r\npresent day.  We had few steamboats, and no railroads, or telephones, or\r\npercussion-caps, or a tremendous press, or Darwinism, or friction\r\nmatches.  Even the introduction of ice-cream, and stone coal as fuel, and\r\ngrates was within the memory of our elders.  Apropos of matches, the use\r\nof tinderbox and brimstone matches was universal; bold young men had\r\ntinder pistols; but the wood fire was generally kept under ashes all\r\nnight, and I can well remember how our negro servants, when it had gone\r\nout, were used early on winter mornings to borrow a shovelful of coals\r\nfrom the cook of our next-door neighbour, and how it was handed over the\r\ngarden fence, the recipient standing on our pump handle and the donor on\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nI forget in what year the railroad (with locomotives) was first built\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Columbia, a distance of sixty miles.  I believe it\r\nwas the first real road of the kind in America.  On the day when the\r\nfirst train ran, the City Council and certain honoured guests made the\r\njourney, and among them was my father, who took me with him.  There were\r\nonly a few miles of the road then completed.  It was a stupendous marvel\r\nto me, and all this being drawn by steam, and by a great terrible iron\r\nmonster of a machine.  And there was still in all souls a certain\r\nunearthly awe of the recently invented and as yet rather rare steamboats.\r\nI can (strangely enough) still recall this feeling by a mental\r\neffort--this meeting the Horror for the first time!  My father\r\nremembered, and had been in the first steamboat which was a success on\r\nthe Delaware.  I saw its wreck in after years at Hoboken.  The earlier\r\nboat made by John Fitch is still preserved in Bordentown.\r\n\r\nI can remember that when gas was introduced to light the city, it was\r\ndone under a fearful opposition.  All the principal people signed a\r\npetition against it.  I saw the paper.  It would burst and kill myriads;\r\nit was poisonous; and, finally, it would ruin the oil trade.  However, we\r\ngot it at last.  Somebody had invented hand gas-lamps; they were sold in\r\nthe Arcade; and as one of these had burst, it was naturally supposed that\r\nthe gasworks would do the same.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of old Philadelphia were in those days so marked, and\r\nare, withal, so sweet to the memory, that I cannot help lingering on\r\nthem.  As Washington Irving says of the Golden Age of Wouter van Twiller,\r\n\"Happy days when the harvest moon was twice as large as now, when the\r\nshad were all salmon, and peace was in the land.\"  Trees grew abundantly\r\nin rows in almost every street--one before every house.  I had two before\r\nmine till 1892, when the Street Commissioners heartlessly ordained that\r\none must be cut down and removed, and charged me ten dollars for doing\r\nit.  It is needless to say that since Street Commissioners have found\r\nthis so profitable, trees have disappeared with sad rapidity.  Then at\r\ntwilight the _pea-ak_ of the night-hawk could be heard all over Arasapha,\r\nwhich is the Indian name for the place where our city stands; there were\r\nin Coaquannoc, or the Schuylkill, abundant gold fish and perch, of which\r\nI angled divers.  Yes, there was, and still is, a Fisher Club, which\r\nclaims to be the oldest gentleman's club in Anglo-Saxony, and which has\r\nfor two centuries brewed for itself a \"fish-house punch\" as delicious as\r\nthat of London civic banquets.  There be no fish in the fair river now;\r\nthey have all vanished before the combined forces of petroleum and the\r\noffal of factories and mines, but the Fish-House Club still has its merry\r\nbanquets in its ancient home; for, as the French say, \"_Chacun peche a sa\r\nmaniere_.\"  In graveyards lone or over gardens green glittered of summer\r\nnights millions of fireflies; there was the scent of magnolias, roses,\r\npinks, and honeysuckles by every house; for Philadelphians have always\r\nhad a passion for flowers, and there never was a Quaker, much less a\r\nQuakeress, who has not studied botany, and wandered in Bartram's Garden\r\nand culled blue gentians in the early fall, or lilies wild in\r\nWissahickon's shade.  There still remains a very beautiful relic of this\r\nolden time in the old Swedes Church, which every stranger should visit.\r\nIt is a quaint structure of more than two hundred years, and in its large\r\nchurchyard (which is not, like Karamsin's graves, \"deserted and drear,\"\r\nbut charming and garden-like) one can imagine himself in rural England.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year there was joyous activity on the Delaware, even\r\nin town; for, as the song hath it--\r\n\r\n   \"De fishin' time hab come at last,\r\n   De winter all am gone and past;\"\r\n\r\nand there was the casting of immense seines and the catching of myriads\r\nof shad, the typical fish or emblem of the Quaker Philadelphian, because\r\nin the profile outline of the shad people professed to discern the form\r\naccording to which the Quaker coat was cut.  With the shad were many\r\nherring, and now and then a desperate giant of a sturgeon, who in his\r\nstruggles would give those concerned enough to do.  Then the yells of the\r\nblack fishermen, the flapping of the horny knife-backed prey--often by\r\nthe flashing of a night-fire--formed a picture worthy of Rembrandt.\r\nApropos of these sturgeon, the fresh caviare or roe (which has been\r\npronounced at St. Petersburg to surpass the Russian) was always thrown\r\naway, as was often the case with sweetbreads, which were rarely eaten.\r\nBut if the caviare or roe was really in those days \"caviare to the\r\ngeneral\" multitude, the _nose_ of the fish was not, it being greatly\r\ncoveted by us small boys wherewith to make a ball for \"shinny,\" which for\r\nsome occult reason was preferred to any other.  Old people of my\r\nacquaintance could remember when seals had been killed at Cape May below\r\nthe city, and how on one or two occasions a bewildered whale of no small\r\ndimensions had found its way to Burlington, some miles above.\r\n\r\nNow and then there would be found in the bay below the city a tremendous,\r\nsquare-shaped, hideous, unnatural piscatorial monster, known as a devil-\r\nfish, or briefly devil.  It was a legend of my youth that two preachers\r\nor ministers of the Presbyterian faith once went fishing in those waters,\r\nand having cast out a stout line, fastened to the mast, for shark, were\r\namazed at finding themselves all at once careering through the waves at\r\nterrible speed, being dragged by one of the diabolical \"monsters of the\r\nroaring deep\" above mentioned.  Whereupon a friend, who was in the boat,\r\nburst out laughing.  And being asked, \"Wherefore this unrestrained\r\nhilarity?\" replied, \"Is it not enough to make a man laugh to see the\r\nDevil running away with two clergymen?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a very excellent and extensive museum of Matters and Things in\r\nGeneral, founded by an ancient artist named Peale, who was the\r\nhead-central charm and delight of all young Philadelphia in those days,\r\nand where, when we had been good all the week, we were allowed to repair\r\non Saturday afternoons.  And here I may say by the way, that\r\nmiscellaneous collections of \"curiosities,\" oddities, and relics are far\r\nmore attractive to children, and stimulate in them far more interest and\r\ninquisitiveness and desire for general information, than do the best\r\nscientific collections, where everything is ranked and numbered, and\r\nwherein even an Etruscan tiara or a Viking's sword loses much of its\r\ncharm when placed simply as a \"specimen\" in a row of others of the kind.\r\nI am not arguing here in the least against scientific or properly\r\narranged archaeologic collections, but to declare the truth that for\r\n_children_ museums of the despised curiosities are far more attractive\r\nand infinitely more useful.\r\n\r\nI owe so very much myself to the old Peale's Museum; it served to\r\nstimulate to such a remarkable degree my interest in antiquities and my\r\nsingular passion for miscellaneous information, and it aided me so much\r\nin my reading, that I cannot pass it by without a tribute to its memory.\r\nHow often have I paused in its dark galleries in awe before the\r\ntremendous skeleton of the Mammoth--how small did that of a great\r\nelephant seem beside it--and recalled the Indian legend of it recorded by\r\nFranklin.  And the stuffed monkeys--one shaving another--what exquisite\r\nhumour, which never palled upon us!  No; _that_ was the museum for us,\r\nand the time will come when there will be such collections made expressly\r\nfor the young.\r\n\r\n\"Stuffed monkey\" was a common by-word, by the way, for a conceited\r\nfellow.  Therefore the _Louisville Journal_, speaking of a rival sheet,\r\nsaid: \"Reader, if you will go into the Louisville Museum, you will see\r\ntwo stuffed monkeys reading the _Courier_.  And if you will then go into\r\nthe office of the _Louisville Courier_, you may see two living stuffed\r\nmonkeys editing the same.\"  The beautiful sallies of this kind which\r\nappeared in these two newspapers for years would make a lively volume.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget one evening alone in that Museum.  I had come with\r\nJacob Pierce's school, and strayed off alone into some far-away and\r\nfascinating nook, forgetful of friends and time.  All the rest had\r\ndeparted homewards, and I sought to find them.  The dark evening shades\r\nwere casting sombre tones in the galleries--I was a very little boy of\r\nseven or eight--and the stuffed lions and bears and wolves seemed looming\r\nor glooming into mysterious life; the varnished sharks and hideous shiny\r\ncrocodiles had a light of awful intelligence in their eyes; the gigantic\r\nanaconda had long awaited me; the grim hyaena marked me for his own; even\r\ndeer and doves seemed uncanny and goblined.  At this long interval of\r\nsixty years, I can recall the details of that walk, and every object\r\nwhich impressively half-appalled me, and how what had been a museum had\r\nbecome a chamber of horrors, yet not without a wild and awful charm.  Of\r\ncourse I lost my way in the shades, and was beginning to speculate on\r\nhaving to pass a night among the monsters, and how much there would be\r\nleft for my friends to mourn over in the morning, when--Eureka!\r\nThalatta!--I beheld the gate of entrance and exit, and made my latter as\r\njoyously as ever did the souls who were played out of Inferno by the old\r\nreprobate of the Roman tale.\r\n\r\nSince that adventure I never mentioned it to a living soul till now, and\r\nyet there is not an event of my life so vividly impressed on my memory.\r\n\r\nMy father took me very rarely to the theatre; but my Quaker school-mates\r\nhad never seen the inside of such places at all, and therefore listened\r\ngreedily to what I could tell them of the sights.  One of the wonders of\r\nmy youth was the seeing the great elephant Columbus perform in a play\r\ncalled \"The Englishman in Siam.\"  It was indeed very curious, and it is\r\ndescribed as such in works on natural history.  And I saw Edwin Forrest\r\n(whom I learned to know in later years) in \"Metamora,\" and Fanny Kemble\r\nin \"Beatrice,\" and so on.  As for George Boker, he went, I believe, to\r\nevery place of amusement whenever he pleased, and talked familiarly of\r\nactors, some of whom he actually knew, and their lives, in a manner which\r\nawoke in me awe and a feeling as being humble and ignorant indeed.  As we\r\ngrew older, Boker and I, from reading \"Don Quixote\" and Scott, used to\r\nsit together for hours improvising legends of chivalry and marvellous\r\nromances.  It was in the year when it first appeared that I read (in the\r\n_New Monthly_) and got quite by heart the rhyming tale of \"Sir Rupert the\r\nFearless,\" a tale of the Rhine, one of the Ingoldsby legends, by Barham.\r\nI can still repeat a great part of it.  I bore it in mind till in after\r\nyears it inspired (allied to Goethe's _Wassermadchen_) my ballad of _De\r\nMaiden mit Nodings on_, which has, as I now write, been very recently\r\nparodied and pictured by _Punch_, March 18, 1893.  My mother had taught\r\nme to get poetry by heart, and by the time I was ten years of age, I had\r\nimbibed, so to speak, an immense quantity; for, as in opium-eating, those\r\nwho begin by effort end by taking in with ease.\r\n\r\nThere was something else so very characteristic of old Philadelphia that\r\nI will not pass it by.  In the fall of the year the reed-bird, which is\r\nquite as good as the ortolan of Italy, and very much like it (I prefer\r\nthe reed-bird), came in large flocks to the marshes and shores of the\r\nDelaware and Schuylkill.  Then might be seen a quaint and marvellous\r\nsight of men and boys of all ages and conditions, with firearms of every\r\nfaculty and form, followed by dogs of every degree of badness, in all\r\nkinds of boats, among which the _bateau_ of boards predominated,\r\nintermingled with an occasional Maryland dug-out or poplar canoe.  Many,\r\nhowever, crept on foot along the shore, and this could be seen below the\r\nNavy Yard even within the city limits.  Then, as flock after flock of\r\nonce bobolinks and now reed-birds rose or fell in flurried flight, there\r\nwould be such a banging, cracking, and barking as to suggest a South\r\nAmerican revolution aided by blood-hounds.  That somebody in the _melee_\r\nnow and then got a charge of shot in his face, or that angry parties in\r\ndispute over a bird sometimes blazed away at one another and fought _a\r\nl'outrance_ in every way, \"goes without saying.\"  Truly they were\r\ninspiriting sights, and kept up the martial valour, aided by frequent\r\nfiremen's fights, which made Philadelphians so indomitable in the\r\nRebellion, when, to the amazement of everybody, our Quaker city\r\nmanifested a genius or love for hard fighting never surpassed by mortals.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, some odd episodes among the infantry or gunners on\r\nfoot, and one of these was so well described by my brother Henry in a\r\npoem, that I venture to give it place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREED-BIRDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Two men and a bull-dog ugly,\r\n     Two guns and a terrier lame;\r\n   They'd better stick out in the marsh there,\r\n     And set themselves up for game.\r\n\r\n   But no; I mark by the cocking\r\n     Of that red-haired Paddy's eye,\r\n   He's been \"reeding\" too much for you, sir,\r\n     Any such game to try.\r\n\r\n   \"Now, Jamie, ye divil, kape dark there,\r\n     And hould the big bull-dog in;\r\n   There's a bloody big crowd of rade-birds,\r\n     That nade a pepperin'!\"\r\n\r\n   _Ker-rack_! goes the single barrel,\r\n     _Flip-boong_! roars the old Queen Anne;\r\n   There's a Paddy stretched out in the mud-hole,\r\n     A kicked-over, knocked-down man.\r\n\r\n   \"Och, Jamie, ye shtupid crature,\r\n      Sure ye're the divil's son;\r\n   How many fingers' load, thin,\r\n      Did ye putt in this d---d ould gun?\"\r\n\r\n   \"How many fingers, be jabers?\r\n      I nivir putt in a wan;\r\n   Did ye think I'd be afther jammin'\r\n      Me fingers into a gun?\"\r\n\r\n   \"Well, give me the powder, Jamie.\"\r\n      \"The powder! as sure as I'm born,\r\n   I put it all into yer musket,\r\n      For I'd nivir a powder-horn!\"\r\n\r\nThen we all had reed-bird suppers or lunches, eked out perhaps with\r\nterrapins and soft-shell crabs, gumbo, \"snapper,\" or pepper-pot soup,\r\npeaches, venison, bear-meat, _salon la saison_--for both bear and deer\r\nroamed wild within fifty or sixty miles--so that, all things considered,\r\nif Philadelphians, and Baltimoreans did run somewhat over-much to eating\r\nup their intellects--as Dr. Holmes declares they do--they had at least\r\nthe excuse of terrible temptation, which the men of my \"grandfather-land\"\r\n(New England), as he once termed it in a letter to me, very seldom had at\r\nany time.\r\n\r\nOnce it befell, though a few years later, that one winter there was a\r\nbroad fair field of ice just above Fairmount dam, which is about ten feet\r\nhigh, that about a hundred and fifty men and maidens were merrily skating\r\nby moonlight.  I know not whether Colonel James Page, our great champion\r\nskater, was there cutting High Dutch; but this I know, that all at once,\r\nby some strange rising of the stream, the whole flake of ice and its\r\noccupants went over the dam.  Strangely enough, no one was killed, but\r\nvery few escaped without injury, and for some time the surgeons were\r\nbusy.  It would make a strange wild picture that of the people struggling\r\nin the broken floes of ice among the roaring waters.\r\n\r\nAnd again, during a week on the same spot, some practical joker amused\r\nhimself with a magic-lantern by making a spirit form flit over the fall,\r\nagainst its face, or in the misty air.  The whole city turned out to see\r\nit, and great was their marvelling, and greater the fear among the\r\nnegroes at the apparition.\r\n\r\nSears C. Walker, who was an intimate friend, kept a school in Sansom\r\nStreet, to which I was transferred.  I was only seven years old at the\r\ntime, and being the youngest, he made, when I was introduced, a speech of\r\napology to his pupils.  He was a good kind man, who also, like Jacob,\r\ngave us lectures on natural philosophy and chemistry.  There I studied\r\nFrench, and began to learn to draw, but made little progress, though I\r\nworked hard.  I have literally never met in all my life any person with\r\nso little natural gift or aptitude for learning languages or drawing as I\r\nhave; and if I have since made an advance in both, it has been at the\r\ncost of such extreme labour as would seem almost incredible.  I was\r\ngreatly interested in chemistry, as a child would be, and, having heard\r\nMr. Walker say something about the colouring matter in quartz, resolved\r\non a great invention which should immortalise my name.  My teacher used\r\nto make his own ink by pounding nut-galls in an iron mortar.  I got a\r\npiece of coarse rock-crystal, pounded it up in the same mortar, pouring\r\nwater on it.  Sure enough the result was a pale ink, which the two elder\r\npupils, who had maliciously aided and encouraged me, declared was of a\r\nvery superior quality.  I never shall forget the pride I felt.  I had,\r\nfirst of all scientists, extracted the colouring matter from quartz!  The\r\nrecipe was at once written out, with a certificate at the end, signed by\r\nmy two witnesses, that they had witnessed the process, and that this was\r\nwritten with the ink itself!  This I gave to Mr. Walker, and could not\r\nunderstand why he laughed so heartily at it.  It was not till several\r\ndays after that he explained to me that the ink was the result of the\r\ndregs of the nut-galls which remained in the mortar.\r\n\r\nWe had not many books, but what we had I read and reread with great\r\nassiduity.  Among them were Cooper's novels, Campbell's poems, those of\r\nByron, and above all, Washington Irving's \"Sketch Book,\" which had great\r\ninfluence on me, inspiring that intense love for old English literature\r\nand its associations which has ever since been a part of my very soul.\r\nIrving was indeed a wonderful, though not a _startling_ genius; but he\r\nhad sympathised himself into such appreciation of the golden memories and\r\nsweet melodies of the olden time, be it American or English, as no writer\r\nnow possesses.  In my eighth year I loved deeply his mottoes, such as\r\nthat from Syr Grey Steel:--\r\n\r\n   \"He that supper for is dight,\r\n   He lies full cold I trow this night;\r\n   Yestreen to chamber I him led,\r\n   This nighte Grey Steel has made his bed.\"\r\n\r\nLang--not Andrew--has informed us that no copy of the first black-letter\r\nedition of Sir Grey Steel is known to exist.  In after years I found in\r\nthe back binding of an old folio two pieces of it, each about four inches\r\nsquare.  It has been an odd fatality of mine that whenever a poet existed\r\nin black-letter, I was always sure to peruse him first in that type,\r\nwhich I always from childhood preferred to any other.  To this day I\r\noften dream of being in a book-shop, turning over endless piles of\r\nmarvellously quaint parchment bound books in _letres blake_, and what is\r\nsingular, they are generally works quite unknown to the world--first\r\ndiscoveries--unique!  And then--oh! then--how bitter is the waking!\r\n\r\nThere was in Mr. Walker's school library a book, one well known as Mrs.\r\nTrimmer's \"Natural History.\"  This I read, as usual, thoroughly and\r\noften, and wrote my name at the end, ending with a long snaky flourish.\r\nYears passed by, and I was at the University, when one evening, dropping\r\nin at an auction, I bought for six cents, or threepence, \"a blind bundle\"\r\nof six books tied up with a cord.  It was a bargain, for I found in it in\r\ngood condition the first American editions of De Quincey's \"Opium-Eater,\"\r\n\"The Rejected Addresses,\" and the Poems of Coleridge.  But what startled\r\nme was a familiar-looking copy of Mrs. Trimmer's \"Natural History,\" in\r\nwhich at the end was my boyish signature.\r\n\r\n\"And still wider.\"  In 1887 I passed some weeks at a hotel in Venice.  A\r\nnumber of Italian naval officers dined at our _table-d'hote_ every\r\nevening.  One of them showed us an intaglio which he had bought.  It\r\nrepresented a hunter on an elephant firing at a tiger.  The owner wished\r\nto know something about it.  Baron von Rosenfeld, a chamberlain of the\r\nEmperor of Austria, remarked at once that it was as old as the days of\r\nflint-locks, because smoke was rising from the lock of the gun.  I felt\r\nthat I knew more about it, but could not at once recall what I knew, and\r\nsaid that I would explain it the next day.  And going into the past, I\r\nremembered that this very scene was the frontispiece to Mrs. Trimmer's\r\n\"Natural History.\"  I think that some gem engraver, possibly in India,\r\nhad copied it to order.  I can even now recall many other things in the\r\nbook, but attribute my retention of so much which I have read _not_ to a\r\ngood memory, such as the mathematician has, which grasps _directly_, but\r\nsimply to frequent reading and mental reviewing or revising.  Where there\r\nhas been none of this, I forgot everything in a short time.\r\n\r\nMy father took in those years _Blackwood's_ and the _New Monthly\r\nMagazine_, and as I read every line of them, they were to me a vast\r\nsource of knowledge.  I remember an epigram by \"Martial in London\" in the\r\nlatter:--\r\n\r\n   \"In Craven Street, Strand, four attorneys find place,\r\n   And four dark coal-barges are moored at the base;\r\n   Fly, Honesty, fly--seek some safer retreat,\r\n   For there's craft on the river, and craft in the street.\"\r\n\r\nI never pass by Craven Street without recalling this, and so it has come\r\nto pass that by such memories and associations London in a thousand ways\r\nis always reviving my early life in America.\r\n\r\nThe _Noctes Ambrosianae_ puzzled me, as did the Bible, but I read, read,\r\nread, _toujours_.  My uncle Amos lent me the \"Arabian Nights,\" though my\r\nfather strictly prohibited it.  But the zest of the forbidden made me\r\nstudy it with wondrous love.  The reader may laugh, but it is a fact that\r\nhaving obtained \"Mother Goose's Melodies,\" I devoured them with a strange\r\ninterest reflected from Washington Irving.  The truth is, that my taste\r\nhad been so precociously developed, that I unconsciously found a\r\n_literary_ merit or charm in them as I did in all fairy-tales, and I\r\nremember being most righteously indignant once when a young bookseller\r\ntold me that I was getting to be too old to read such stuff!  The truth\r\nwas, that I was just getting to be old enough to appreciate it as folk-\r\nlore and literature, which he never did.\r\n\r\nThe great intellectual influence which acted on me most powerfully after\r\nIrving was an incomplete volume of about 1790, called \"The Poetical\r\nEpitome.\"  It consisted of many of Percy's \"Relics\" with selections of\r\nballads, poems, and epigrams of many eminent writers.  I found it a few\r\nyears after at a boarding-school, where I continually read it as before.\r\n\r\nAs I was backward in my studies, my parents, very injudiciously so far as\r\nlearning was concerned, removed me from Mr. Walker's school, and put me\r\nunder the care of T. Bronson Alcott, who had just come to Philadelphia.\r\nThis was indeed going from the frying-pan into the very fire, so far as\r\ncuring idleness and desultory habits and a tendency to romance and wild\r\nspeculation was concerned.  For Mr. Alcott was the most eccentric man who\r\never took it on himself to train and form the youthful mind.  He did not\r\nreally teach any practical study; there was indeed some pretence at\r\ngeography and arithmetic, but these we were allowed to neglect at our own\r\nsweet will.  His forte was \"moral influence\" and \"sympathetic\r\nintellectual communion\" by talking; and oh, heaven! what a talker he was!\r\nHe was then an incipient Transcendentalist, and he did not fail to\r\ndiscover in me the seeds of the same plant.  He declared that I had a\r\nmarvellous imagination, and encouraged my passion for reading anything\r\nand everything to the very utmost.  It is a fact that at nine years of\r\nage his disquisitions on and readings from Spenser's \"Faerie Queen\"\r\nactually induced me to read the entire work, of which he was very proud,\r\nreminding me of it in 1881, when I went to Harvard to deliver the Phi\r\nBeta Kappa poem.  He also read thoroughly into us the \"Pilgrim's\r\nProgress,\" Quarles's \"Emblems,\" Northcote's \"Fables,\" much Shakespeare,\r\nWordsworth, Coleridge, and Milton, all of which sunk into my very soul,\r\neducating me indeed \"ideally\" as no boy perhaps in Philadelphia had ever\r\nbeen educated, at the utter cost of all real \"education.\"  It was a great\r\npity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.  The word _ideal_ was ever in his mouth.\r\nAll of the new theories, speculations, or fads which were beginning to be\r\nventilated among the Unitarian liberal clergy found ready welcome in his\r\ndreamy brain, and he retailed them all to his pupils, among whom I was\r\ncertainly the only one who took them in and seriously thought them over.\r\nYet I cannot say that I _really_ liked the man himself.  He was not to me\r\nexactly sympathetic-human.  Such training as his would develop in any boy\r\ncertain weaknesses--and I had mine--which were very repulsive to my\r\nfather, who carried plain common-sense to extremes, and sometimes into\r\nits opposite of unconscious eccentricity, though there was no word which\r\nhe so much hated.\r\n\r\nBulwer's \"Last Days of Pompeii,\" \"The Disowned,\" and \"Pilgrims of the\r\nRhine\" made a deep and lasting impression on me.  I little thought then\r\nthat I should in after years be the guest of the author in his home, and\r\nsee the skull of Arbaces.  Oh, that by some magic power every author\r\ncould be made to feel _all_ the influence, all the charm, which his art\r\nexerts on his readers, and especially the young.  Sometimes, now and\r\nthen, by golden chance, a writer of books does realise this, and then\r\nfeels that he has lived to some purpose.  Once it happened to me to find\r\na man, an owner of palaces and millions, who had every facility for\r\nbecoming familiar with far greater minds and books than mine, who had for\r\nyears collected with care and read everything which I had ever written.\r\nHe actually knew more about my books than I did.  I was startled at the\r\ndiscovery as at a miracle.  And if the reader knew _what_ a _melange_ I\r\nhave written, he would not wonder at it.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that no man living appreciates the vast degree to\r\nwhich any book whatever which aims at a little more than merely\r\nentertaining, and appeals at all to thought, influences the world, and\r\nhow many readers it gets.  There are books, of which a thousand copies\r\nwere never sold, which have permeated society and been the argument of\r\nnational revolutions.  Such a book was the \"Political Economy\" of H. C.\r\nCarey, of which I possess the very last copy of the first, and I believe\r\nthe only, edition.  And there are novels which have gone to the three\r\nhundred thousand, of whose authors it may be said that\r\n\r\n   \"Over the barren desert of their brains\r\n   There never strayed the starved camel of an idea,\"\r\n\r\nand whose works vanish like wind.\r\n\r\nWhat is very remarkable is the manner in which even the great majority of\r\nreaders confuse these two classes, and believe that mere popular success\r\nis correlative with genius and desert.  A great cause of this really\r\nvulgar error is the growing conviction that artistic skill alone\r\ndetermines merit in literature, and that intellect, as the French,\r\nbeginning mildly with Voltaire and ending violently with Sainte-Beuve,\r\nassert is of far less importance than style.  \"_Le style_, _c'est\r\nl'esprit du siecle_.\"  Apropos of which I remarked that in the warlike\r\nMiddle Age in France the motto might have been \"_L'homme c'est le_\r\nSTEEL.\"  Then came the age of wigs, when the cry was, \"_L'homme c'est le_\r\nSTYLE.\"  And now we are in the swindling and bogus-company-promoting age,\r\nwhen it might be proclaimed that \"_L'homme c'est le_ STEAL.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another book which I read through and through in early\r\nchildhood to great profit.  This was Cottle's \"Alfred,\" an epic of some\r\nmerit, but chiefly in this, that it sets forth tolerably clearly the old\r\nNorse life and religion.  George Boker owned and gave me some time after\r\na book entitled \"Five Norse Poems,\" in the original, and translated.  This\r\nwith Grey's poems, which latter I possessed, laid the basis for a deep\r\ninterest in after years in Northern antiquities; they were soon followed\r\nby Mallett; and if I have since read many sagas in Icelandic and studied\r\nwith keenest interest the museums of the North, the first incentive\r\nthereto came from my boyish reading.  When I was sixteen I executed a\r\npoetic version of the \"Death Song of Regner Lodbrog,\" which, though it\r\nwas never published, I think was at least as good as any translation\r\nwhich I have since executed, \"however that may be.\"  I very seriously\r\nconnected this Norse spirit with my grandfather and his stern uncles and\r\nprogenitors, who had fought in Canada and in the icy winters of New\r\nEngland; grim men they were all; and I daresay that I was quite right.  It\r\nalways seems to me that among these alternately fighting and farming\r\nIcelanders I am among my Leland relatives; and I even once found Uncle\r\nSeth in his red waistcoat in the Burnt Njals saga to the life.  There was\r\na paragraph, as I write, recently circulating in the newspapers, in which\r\nI was compared in appearance to an old grey Viking, and it gave me a\r\nstrange uncanny thrill, as if the writer of it were a wizard who had\r\nrevealed a buried secret.\r\n\r\nMy parents, on coming to Philadelphia, had at first attended the\r\nEpiscopal church, but finding that most of their New England friends held\r\nto the Rev. W. H. (now Dr.) Furness, an Unitarian, they took a pew in his\r\nchapel.  After fifteen years they returned to the Episcopal faith, but\r\nallowed me to keep the pew to myself for one or two years, till I went to\r\ncollege.  In Dr. Furness's chapel I often heard Channing and all the\r\nfamous Unitarian divines of the time preach, and very often saw Miss\r\nHarriet Martineau, Dr. Combe, the phrenologist, and many other\r\ndistinguished persons.  In other places at different times I met Andrew\r\nJackson, Henry Clay, to whom I was introduced, Daniel Webster, to whom I\r\nreverently bowed, receiving in return a gracious acknowledgment, Peter\r\nDuponceau, Morton, Stephen Girard, Joseph Buonaparte, the two authors of\r\nthe \"Jack Downing Letters\"; and I once heard David Crockett make a\r\nspeech.  Apropos of Joseph Buonaparte, I can remember to have heard my\r\nwife's mother, the late Mrs. Rodney Fisher, tell how when a little girl,\r\nand while at his residence at Bordentown, she had run a race with the old\r\nex-king of Spain.  A very intimate friend in our family was Professor\r\nJohn Frost, the manufacturer of literally innumerable works of every\r\ndescription.  He had many thousands of woodcut blocks, and when he\r\nreceived an order--as, for example, a history of any country, or of the\r\nworld, or of a religion, or a school geography, or book of travel or\r\nadventure, or a biography, or anything else that the heart of man could\r\nconceive--he set his scribes to write, scissors and paste, and lo! the\r\nbook was made forthwith, he aiding and revising it.  What was most\r\nremarkable was that many of these _pieces de manufacture_ were rather\r\nclever, and very well answered the demand, for their sale was enormous.\r\nHe had when young been in the West Indies, and written a clever novelette\r\nentitled \"Ramon, the Rover of Cuba.\"  Personally he was very handsome,\r\nrefined, and intelligent; a man meant by Nature for higher literary work\r\nthan mere book-making.\r\n\r\nMiss Eliza Leslie, the writer of the best series of sketches of American\r\ndomestic life of her day, was a very intimate friend of my mother, and a\r\nconstant visitor at our house.  She was a sister of Leslie, the great\r\nartist, and had been in her early life much in England.  I was a great\r\nfavourite with her, and owed much to her always entertaining and very\r\ninstructive conversation, which was full of reminiscences of\r\ndistinguished people and remarkable events.  I may say with great truth\r\nthat I really profited as much by mere hearing as many boys would have\r\ndone by knowing the originals, so deep was the interest which I felt in\r\nall that I heard, and so eager my desire to learn to know the world.\r\n\r\nThen I was removed, and with good cause, from Mr. Alcott's school, for he\r\nhad become so very \"ideal\" or eccentric in his teaching and odd methods\r\nof punishment by tormenting without ever whipping, that people could not\r\nendure his purely intellectual system.  So for one winter, as my health\r\nwas bad and I was frequently ill, for a long time I was allowed to do\r\nnothing but attend a writing-school kept by a Mr. Rand.  At the end of\r\nthe season, he sadly admitted that I still wrote badly; I think he\r\npronounced me the worst and most incurable case of bad writing which he\r\nhad ever attended.  In 1849 Judge (then Mr.) Cadwallader, with whom I was\r\nstudying law, said that he admired my engrossing hand more than any he\r\nhad ever seen except one.  As hands go round the clock, our hands do\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nI was to go the next summer to New England with my younger brother, Henry\r\nPerry Leland, to be placed in the celebrated boarding-school of Mr.\r\nCharles W. Greene, at Jamaica Plains, five miles from Boston; which was\r\ndone, and with this I enter on a new phase of life, of which I have very\r\nvivid reminiscences.  Let me state that we first went to Dedham and\r\nstayed some weeks.  There I found living with his father, an interesting\r\nboy of my own age, named William Joshua Barney, a grandson of the\r\ncelebrated Commodore Barney, anent whom was written the song, \"Barney,\r\nleave the girls alone,\" apropos of his having been allowed to kiss Marie\r\nAntoinette and all her maids of honour.  William had already been at Mr.\r\nGreene's school, and we soon became intimate.\r\n\r\nDuring this time my father hired a chaise; I borrowed William's shot-gun,\r\nand we went together on a delightful tour to visit all our relations in\r\nHolliston, Milford, and elsewhere.  At one time we stopped to slay an\r\nimmense black snake; at another to shoot wild pigeons, and \"so on about\"\r\nto Providence and many places.  From cousins who lived in old farmhouses\r\nin wild and remote places I received Indian arrow-heads and a stone\r\ntomahawk, and other rustic curiosities dear to my heart.  At the Fremont\r\nHouse in Boston my father showed me one day at dinner several foreign\r\ngentlemen of different nations belonging to different Legations.  In\r\nRhode Island I found by a stream several large pot-holes in rocks of\r\nwhich I had read, and explained to my father (gravely as usual) how they\r\nwere made by eddies of water and gravel-stones.  One day my father in\r\nBoston took me to see a marvellous white shell from China, valued at one\r\nhundred pounds.  What was the amazement of all present to hear me give\r\nits correct Latin name, and relate a touching tale of a sailor who,\r\nfinding such a shell when shipwrecked on a desert island, took it home\r\nwith him, \"and was thereby raised (as I told them) from poverty to\r\naffluence.\"  Which tale I had read the week before in a children's\r\nmagazine, and, as usual, reflected deeply on it, resolving to keep my eye\r\non all shells in future, in the hope of something turning up.\r\n\r\nI was _not_, however, a little prig who bored people with my reading, for\r\nI have heard old folk say that there was a quaint _naivete_ and droll\r\nseriousness, and total unconsciousness of superior information in my\r\nmanner, which made these outpourings of mine very amusing.  I think I was\r\na kind of little Paul Dombey, unconsciously odd, and perhaps innocently\r\nQuaker-like.  I could never understand why Aunt Nancy, and many more,\r\nseemed to be so much amused at serious and learned examples and questions\r\nwhich I laid down to them.  For though they did not \"smile outright,\" I\r\nhad learned to penetrate the New England ironical glance and satirical\r\nintonation.  My mother said that, when younger, I, having had a\r\ndifficulty of some kind with certain street-boys, came into the house\r\nwith my eyes filled with tears, and said, \"I told them that they were\r\nevil-minded, but they laughed me to scorn.\"  On another occasion, when\r\nsome vagabond street-boys asked me to play with them, I gravely declined,\r\non the ground that I must \"Shun bad company\"--this phrase being the title\r\nof a tract which I had read, and the boys corresponding in appearance to\r\na picture of sundry young ragamuffins on its title-page.\r\n\r\nMy portrait had been admirably painted in Philadelphia by Mrs. Darley,\r\nthe daughter of Sully, who, I believe, put the finishing touches to it.\r\nWhen Mr. Walker saw it, he remarked that it looked exactly as if Charley\r\nwere just about to tell one of his stories.  At the time I was reading\r\nfor the first time \"The Child's Own Book,\" an admirable large collection\r\nof fairy-tales and strange adventures, which kept me in fairy-land many a\r\ntime while I lay confined to bed for weeks with pleurisies and a great\r\nvariety of afflictions, for in this respect I suffered far more than most\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SCHOOL IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Charles W. Greene was a portly, ruddy, elderly Boston gentleman of\r\ngood family, who had been in early life attached in some diplomatic\r\ncapacity to a Legation, and had visited Constantinople.  I think that he\r\nhad met with reverses, but having some capital, had been established by\r\nhis many friends as a schoolmaster.  He was really a fine old gentleman,\r\nwith a library full of old books, and had Madeira in quaint little old\r\nbottles, on which, stamped in the glass, one could read GREENE 1735.  He\r\nhad a dear little wife, and both were as kind to the boys as possible.\r\nOnce, and once only, when I had really been very naughty, did he punish\r\nme.  He took me solemnly into the library (oh, what blessed beautiful\r\nreading I often had there!), and, after a solemn speech, and almost with\r\ntears in his eyes, gave me three blows with a folded newspaper!  That was\r\nenough.  If I had been flayed with a rope's end, it would not have had a\r\ngreater moral effect than it did.\r\n\r\nEverything was very English and old-fashioned about the place.  The house\r\nwas said in 1835 to be a hundred and fifty years old, having been one of\r\nthe aristocratic Colonial manors.  One building after another had been\r\nadded to it, and the immense elms which grew about testified to its age.\r\nThe discipline or training was eminently adapted to make young gentlemen\r\nof us all.  There was almost no immorality among the boys, and no\r\nfighting whatever.  The punishments were bad marks, and for every mark a\r\nboy was obliged to go to bed an hour earlier than the others.  Extreme\r\ncases of wickedness were punished by sending boys to bed in the daytime.\r\nWhen two were in a room, and thus confined, they used to relieve the\r\nmonotony of their imprisonment by fighting with pillows.  Those who had\r\nbad marks were also confined within certain bounds.  Good boys, or those\r\nespecially favoured, were allowed to chop kindling wood, or do other\r\nlight work, for which they were paid three cents per hour.\r\n\r\nThe boy who was first down in the morning had an apple given to him.  This\r\napple was greatly despised by the bolder spirits, who taunted those who\r\narose promptly with a desire to obtain it.\r\n\r\nCandour compels me to admit that, as a teacher of learning, Mr. Greene\r\nwas not pre-eminent.  He had two schoolrooms, and employed for each as\r\ngood a teacher as he could hire.  But we were not at all thoroughly well\r\ntaught, although we were kept longer in the schoolroom than was really\r\ngood for us; for in summer we had an hour's study before breakfast, then\r\nfrom nine till twelve, and again from two to five.  In winter we had,\r\ninstead of the early lesson, an hour in the evening.  Something was\r\nwanting in the system, and I believe that after a year and a half I knew\r\nno more, as regards studies, than I did when I first entered.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy's birthday came, he was allowed to have some special dainty\r\nfor us all.  I was very much disgusted with the Boston boys when they\r\nselected pork and beans, which I loathed.  Some would choose\r\nplum-pudding, others apple-pies.  There were always two or three dishes\r\nfor breakfast, as, for instance, fried potatoes and butter, or cold meat,\r\nor pan-dowdy--a kind of coarse and broken up apple-pie--with the tea and\r\nbread and coffee, but we could only eat of one.  There was rather too\r\nmuch petty infant-schoolery in all this, but we got on very well.  Pepper\r\nand mustard were forbidden, but I always had a great natural craving for\r\nthese, and when I asked for them, Mr. Greene would shake his head, but\r\nalways ended by handing them to me.  He was a _bon vivant_ himself, and\r\nsympathised with me.  There were one or two books also of a rather\r\npeppery or spicy nature in his library, such as a collection of\r\nrollicking London songs, at which he likewise shook his head when I asked\r\nfor them--but I got them.  There I read for the first time all of Walter\r\nScott's novels, and the Percy Ballads, and some of Marryatt's romances,\r\nand Hood's Annual, and Dr. Holmes's first poems.\r\n\r\nThere was in Mr. Greene's library a very curious and now rare work in\r\nthree volumes, published in Boston at some time in the twenties, called\r\n\"The Marvellous Depository.\"  It consisted of old legends of Boston, such\r\nas the story of \"Peter Rugg,\" \"Tom Walker and the Devil,\" \"The Golden\r\nTooth,\" \"Captain Kidd,\" \"The Witch Flymaker,\" and an admirable collection\r\nof unearthly German tales, such as \"The Devil's Elixir,\" by Hoffmann\r\n(abridged), \"Jacob the Bowl,\" \"Rubezahl,\" \"Der Freyschutz,\" and many\r\nmore, but all of the unearthly blood-curdling kind.  Singly, they were\r\nappalling enough to any one in those days when the supernatural still\r\nthrilled the strongest minds, but taken altogether for steady reading,\r\nthe book was a perfect Sabbat of deviltry and dramatic horrors.  The\r\ntales were well told, or translated in very simple but vigorous English,\r\nand I pored over the collection and got it by heart, and borrowed it, and\r\ntook it to Dedham in the holidays, and into the woods, where I read it in\r\nsunshine or twilight shade by the rippling river, under wild rocks, and\r\nso steeped my soul in the supernatural, that I seemed to live a double\r\nlife.  As was natural, my schoolmates read and liked such tales, but they\r\nsunk into my very soul, and took root, and grew up into a great\r\novershadowing forest, while with others they were only as dwarf bushes,\r\nif they grew at all.  All of this--though I did not know it--was\r\nunconsciously educating my bewitched mind to a deep and very precocious\r\npassion for mediaeval and black-letter literature and occult philosophy,\r\nwhich was destined to manifest itself within a few years.\r\n\r\nThere was another book which greatly influenced my mind and life.  I have\r\nforgotten the title, but it was a very remarkable collection of\r\ncuriosities, such as accounts of a family of seven children who had every\r\none some strange peculiarity, dwarfs and giants, and mysteriously-gifted\r\nmortals, and all kinds of odd beings and inventions.  I obtained in a\r\nvery mysterious way; for one day I found it in my desk, a blessed gift\r\nindeed from some unknown friend who had rightly judged of my tastes.  This\r\nwork I literally lived upon for a long time.  Once a lady friend of my\r\nmother's came in winter and took me a-sleighing, but I had my dear book\r\nunder my jacket, and contrived now and then to re-read some anecdote in\r\nit.  In after years I found a copy of it in the Mercantile Library,\r\nPhiladelphia, but I have never seen it elsewhere. {56}  I had at Mr.\r\nAlcott's carefully studied all the Percy Anecdotes, and could repeat most\r\nof them when recalled by some association; also Goldsmith's \"Animated\r\nNature,\" the perusal of which latter work was to me as the waving of a\r\nforest and the sighing of deep waters.  Then, too, I had read--in fact I\r\nowned--the famous Peter Parley books, which gave me, as they have to\r\nthousands of boys, a desire to travel and see the world.  I marvelled\r\ngreatly at finding that Peter Parley himself, or Mr. S. G. Goodrich, had\r\na beautiful country-house very near our school, and his son Frank, who\r\nwas a very pleasant and wonderfully polite and sunshiny boy, sat by me in\r\nschool.  Frank Goodrich in after life wrote a novel entitled \"Flirtation\r\nand its Consequences,\" of which my brother said, \"What are its\r\nconsequences, Frank; good rich husbands?  By no means.\"  I can remember\r\nbeing invited to a perfectly heavenly garden-party at the Goodrichs', and\r\nevening visits there with my mother.  And I may note by the way, that\r\nFrank himself lived abroad in after years; that his father became the\r\nAmerican Consul in Paris, and that in 1848 he introduced to the\r\n_Gouvernement Provisoire_ the American delegation, of which I was one,\r\nand how we were caricatured in the _Charivari_, in which caricature I was\r\nspecially depicted, the likeness being at once recognised by everybody,\r\nand how I knew nothing of it all till I was told about it by the\r\nbeautiful Miss Goodrich, Frank's younger sister, on a Staten Island\r\nsteamboat, many, many years after.  And as a postscript I may add, that\r\nit is literally true that before I was quite twenty-three years of age I\r\nhad been twice caricatured or pictorially jested on in the Munich\r\n_Fliegende Blatter_ and twice in the Paris _Charivari_, which may show\r\nthat I was to a certain degree about town in those days, as I indeed was.\r\nWhile I am about it, I may as well tell the Munich tale.  There was a\r\npretty governess, a great friend of mine, who had charge of two children.\r\nMeeting her one day in the park, at a sign from me she pressed the\r\nchildren's hats down over their eyes with \"Kinder, setzt eure Hute fester\r\nauf!\" and in that blessed instant cast up her beautiful lips and was\r\nkissed.  I don't know whether we were overseen; certain it is that in the\r\nnext number of the _Fliegende Blatter_ the scene was well depicted, with\r\nthe words.  The other instance was this.  One evening I met in a\r\n_Bierhalle_ a sergeant of police with whom I fraternised.  I remember\r\nthat he could talk modern Greek, having learned it in Greece.  This was\r\nvery _infra dig._ indeed for a student, and one of my comrades said to me\r\nthat, as I was a foreigner, I was probably not aware of what a fault I\r\nhad committed, but that in future I must not be seen talking to a\r\nsoldier.  To which I, with a terrible wink, replied, \"Mum's the word;\r\nthat soldier is _lieutenant of police in my ward_, and I have squared it\r\nwith him all right, so that if there should be a _Bierkrawall_ (a drunken\r\nrow) in our quarter he will let me go.\"  This, which appeared as a grand\r\nflight of genial genius to a German, speedily went through all the\r\nstudents' _kneipe_, and soon appeared, very well illustrated, in the \"_F.\r\nB_.\"\r\n\r\nWe were allowed sixpence a week spending-money at Mr. Greene's, two\r\ncents, or a penny, being deducted for a bad mark.  Sometimes I actually\r\ngot a full week's income; once I let it run on up to 25 cents, but this\r\nwas forbidden, it not being considered advisable that the boys should\r\naccumulate fortunes.  A great deal of my money went for cheap comic\r\nliterature, which I carefully preserved.  In those days there were\r\nCrockett's almanacs (now a great fund of folk-lore), and negro songs and\r\nstories were beginning to be popular.  It is very commonly asserted that\r\nthe first regular negro minstrel troupe appeared in 1842.  This is quite\r\nan error.  While I was at Mr. Greene's, in 1835, there came to Dedham a\r\ncircus with as regularly-appointed a negro minstrel troupe of a dozen as\r\nI ever saw.  I often beheld the pictures of them on the bill.  Nor do I\r\nthink that this was any novelty even then.  The Crockett almanacs greatly\r\nstimulated my sense of American humour (they do indeed form collectively\r\na very characteristic work), and this, with some similar reading, awoke\r\nin me a passion for wild Western life and frontier experiences, which was\r\nfully and strangely gratified in after years, but which would certainly\r\nhave never happened had it not been for this boyish reading.\r\n\r\nFor I beg the reader to observe that it is a very deeply-seated\r\ncharacteristic that whatever once takes root in my mind invariably grows.\r\nThis comes from the great degree to which I have always gone over,\r\nreviewed, and _reflected on_, or nursed everything which ever once really\r\ninterested me.  And as I have thus far written, and shall probably\r\nconclude this work without referring to a note, the reader will have\r\nample opportunity of observing how very strangely in all cases the phases\r\nof my life were predetermined long before by the literary education which\r\nI gave myself, aided very much by hereditary or other causes quite beyond\r\nmy control.  Now, as the object of a _Life_ is to understand every cause\r\nwhich created it, and as mine was to a very unusual degree created by\r\nreading and _reflecting_, even in infancy, I beg the reader not to be\r\nimpatient with me for describing so much in detail the books which made\r\nmy mind at different times.  That is, I pray this much allowance and\r\nsympathy from possible readers and critics, that they will kindly not\r\nregard me as vain or thinking over-much of, or too much over, myself.  For\r\nto get oneself forth as one really is requires deep investigation into\r\n_every_ cause, and the depicting all early characteristics, and the man\r\nnever lived who ever did this truly and accurately without much egoism,\r\nor what the ill-disposed may treat as such.  And I promise the possible\r\nreader that when this subjective analysis shall be fairly disposed of,\r\nthere will be no lack of mere incident or event of objective nature and\r\nmore general interest.\r\n\r\nMy first winter at Jamaica Plains was the terrible one of 1835, during\r\nwhich I myself saw the thermometer at 50 degrees Fahrenheit below zero,\r\nand there was a snow-bank in the play-ground from October till May.  The\r\ngreatest care possible was taken of us boys to keep us warm and well, but\r\nwe still suffered very much from chilblains.  Water thrown into the air\r\nfroze while falling.  Still there were some happy lights and few shadows\r\nin it all.  The boys skated or slid on beautiful Jamaica Pond, which was\r\nnear the school.  There was a general giving of sleds to us all; mine\r\nbroke to pieces at once.  I never had luck with any plaything, never\r\nplayed ball or marbles, and hardly ever had even a top.  Nor did I ever\r\nhave much to do with any games, or even learn in later years to play\r\ncards, which was all a great pity.  Sports should be as carefully looked\r\nto in early education as book-learning.  I had also a pair of dear\r\ngazelle-skates given to me with the rest, but they also broke up on first\r\ntrial, and I have never owned any since.  Destiny was always against me\r\nin such matters.\r\n\r\nThe boys built two large snow-houses, roofed in or arched over with hard\r\nsnow.  One was ingeniously and appropriately like an Eskimo hut, with a\r\nrather long winding passage leading into it.  Of these I wrote in the\r\nspring, when the sun had begun to act, \"one is almost annihilated, and of\r\nthe other not a _vestage_ remains.\"  I found the letter by chance many\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nThere lived in Boston some friends of my mother's named Gay.  In the\r\nfamily was an old lady over eighty, who was a wonderfully lively spirited\r\nperson.  She still sang, as I thought, very beautifully, to the lute, old\r\nsongs such as \"The merry days of good Queen Bess,\" and remembered the old\r\nColonial time as if it were of yesterday.  One day Mr. Gay came out and\r\ntook me to his house, where I remained from Saturday until Monday; during\r\nwhich time I found among the books, and very nearly read through, all the\r\npoems of Peter Pindar or Doctor Wolcott.  Precious reading it was for a\r\nboy of eleven, yet I enjoyed it immensely.  While there, I found in the\r\nearth in the garden an oval, dark-green porphyry pebble, which I, moved\r\nby a strange feeling, preserved for many years as an amulet.  It is very\r\ncurious that exactly such pebbles are found as fetishes all over the\r\nworld, and the famous conjuring stone of the Voodoos, which I possess, is\r\nonly an ordinary black flint pebble of the same shape.  Negroes have\r\ntravelled a thousand miles to hold it in their hands and make a wish,\r\nwhich, if uttered with _faith_, is always granted.  Its possession alone\r\nentitles any one to the first rank as master in the mysteries of Voodoo\r\nsorcery.  Truly I began early in the business!  I may here say that since\r\nI owned the Voodoo stone it has been held in several very famous and a\r\nfew very beautiful hands.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Mr. Greene's I wrote my first poem.  I certainly exhibited\r\nno great precocity of lyrical genius in it, but the reader must remember\r\nthat I was only a foolish little boy of ten or eleven at the time, and\r\nthat I showed it to no one.  It was as follows:\r\n\r\n   \"As a long-bearded Sultan, an infidel Turk,\r\n   Who ne'er in his life had done any work,\r\n   Rode along to the bath, he saw Hassan the black,\r\n   With two monstrous water-skins high on his back.\r\n\r\n   \"'Ho, Hassan, thou afreet! thou infidel dog!\r\n   Thou son of a Jewess and eater of hog!\r\n   This instant, this second, put down thy skin jugs,\r\n   And for my sovereign pleasure remove both the plugs!'\r\n\r\n   \"The negro obeyed him, put both on the ground,\r\n   And opened the skins and the water flew round;\r\n   The Sultan looked on till he laughed his fill;\r\n   Then went on to the bath, feeling heated and ill.\r\n\r\n   \"When arrived at the bath, 'Is all ready?' he cries.\r\n   'Indeed it is not, sire,' the bath-man replies;\r\n   'For to fetch the bath-water black Hassan has gone,\r\n   And your highness can't have it till he shall return.'\"\r\n\r\nIn after years my friend, Professor E. H. Palmer, translated this into\r\nArabic, and promised me that it should be sung in the East.  It is not\r\nmuch of a poem, even for a boy, but there is one touch true to life in\r\nit--which is the _cursing_.  This must have come to me by revelation; and\r\nin after years in Cairo I never heard a native address another as\r\n\"_Afrit_!  _Ya-hinzeer_--_wa Yahud_--_yin uldeen ak_?\"--\"curse your\r\nreligion!\"--but I thought how marvellous it was that I, even in my\r\ninfancy, had divined so well how they did it!  However, now I come to\r\nthink of it, I had the year before read Morier's \"Haji-Baba\" with great\r\nadmiration, and I doubt not that it was the influence of that remarkable\r\nbook which produced this beautiful result.  In after years I met with a\r\nlady who was a daughter of Morier.  Apropos of the _book_, it reminds me\r\nthat I specially recall my _reviewing_ it mentally many times.\r\n\r\nI have reviewed my early life in quiet, old-fashioned, shaded\r\nPhiladelphia and in rural New England so continually and carefully all\r\nthe time ever since it passed that I am sure its minutest detail on any\r\nday would now be accurately recalled at the least suggestion.  As I shall\r\nalmost certainly write this whole work without referring to a note or\r\njournal or other document, it will be seen that I remember the past\r\npretty well.  What is most remarkable in it all, if I _can_ make myself\r\nintelligible, is that what between the deep and indelible impression made\r\non my mind by _books_, and that of scenery and characters now passed\r\naway--the two being connected--it all seems to me now to be as it were\r\nvividly depicted, coloured, or _written_ in my mind, like pages in an\r\nilluminated or illustrated romance.  As some one has said that dreams are\r\nnovels which we read when asleep, so bygone memories, when continually\r\nrevived and associated with the subtle and delicate influences of\r\n_reading_, really become fixed literature to us, glide into it, and are\r\nvirtually turned to copy, which only awaits type.  Thus a _scene_ to one\r\nhighly cultivated in art is really a picture, to a degree which few\r\nactually realise, though they may fancy they do, because to actually\r\nmaster this harmony requires so many years of study and thought that I\r\nvery rarely meet with perfect instances of it.  De Quincey and Coleridge\r\nare two of the best illustrations whom I can recall, while certain\r\nanalytical character-sifters in modern novels seem the farthest remote\r\nfrom such genial naturalness.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first year my brother returned to Philadelphia.  I\r\npassed the summer at Dr. Stimson's, in Dedham, wandering about in the\r\nwoods with my bow, fishing in the river, reading always whatever fate or\r\na small circulating library provided--I remember that \"The Devil on Two\r\nSticks\" and the \"Narrative of Captain Boyle\" were in it--and carving\r\nspoons and serpents from wood, which was a premonition of my later work\r\nin this line, and of my \"Manual of Wood-Carving.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time something took place which deeply impressed me.  This was\r\nthe two hundredth anniversary of the building of the town of Dedham,\r\nwhich was celebrated with very great splendour: speeches, tents with pine-\r\nboughs, music-booths, ginger-beer, side-shows--in short, all the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of a country fair allied to historic glory.  I had made one\r\nor two rather fast and, I fear me, not over-reputable acquaintances of my\r\nown age, with whom I enjoyed the festival to the utmost.  Then I returned\r\nto school, and autumn came, and then winter.  At this time I felt\r\nfearfully lonely.  I yearned for my mother with a longing beyond words,\r\nand was altogether home-sick.\r\n\r\nI was seated one Saturday afternoon, busily working in the drawing-class\r\nunder a little old Englishman named Dr. Hunt, when there came the\r\nstartling news that a gentleman had come to take me home!  I could hardly\r\nbelieve my senses.  I went down, and was presented to a man of about\r\nthirty, of extremely pleasant and attractive appearance, who told me that\r\nhis name was Carlisle, that he was a friend of my father's, and that I\r\nwas at once to return with him to Philadelphia.  I wonder that I did not\r\nfaint with joy.  Mr. Carlisle was a man of very remarkable intelligence,\r\nkindness, and refinement.  Nearly sixty years have passed since then, and\r\nyet the memory of the delightful impression which he made on me is as\r\nfresh as ever.  My trunk was soon packed; we were whirled away to Boston,\r\nand went to a hotel, he treating me altogether like a young gentleman and\r\nan equal.\r\n\r\nIt had been the dream and hope and wild desire of my life to go to the\r\nLion Theatre in Boston, where circus was combined with roaring maritime\r\nmelodramas, of which I had heard heavenly accounts from a few of my\r\nschoolmates.  And Mr. Carlisle took me there that evening, and I saw\r\n\"Hyder Ali.\"  Never, never in my life before did I dream that dramatic\r\nart, poetry, and _mimesis_ could attain to such ideal splendour.  And\r\nthen a sailor came on the stage and sang \"Harry Bluff,\" and when he came\r\nto the last line--\r\n\r\n   \"And he died like a true Yankee sailor at last,\"\r\n\r\namid thundering hurrahs, it seemed to me that romance could go no\r\nfarther.  I do not think that Mr. Carlisle had any knowledge of boys,\r\ncertainly not of such a boy as I was, but I am sure that he must have\r\nbeen amply repaid for his kindness to me in my delight.  And there were\r\nacrobatic performances, such as I had never seen in my life, and we\r\nreturned to the hotel and a grand supper, and I was in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mr. Carlisle put into my hand, with great delicacy, such\r\na sum as I had never before possessed, telling me that I \"would need it\r\nfor travelling expenses.\"  All the while he drew me out on literature.  On\r\nthe Long Island Sound steamer he bade me notice a young gentleman (whom I\r\nwas destined to know in after years), a man with curly hair and very\r\nfoppish air, accompanied by a page \"in an eruption of buttons,\" and told\r\nme that it was N. P. Willis.  And so revelling in romance and travel,\r\nwith mince-pie and turkey for my daily food, my pocket stuffed with\r\nmoney, in the most refined and elegant literary society (at least it was\r\nthere on deck), I came to Philadelphia.  I may here say that the memory\r\nof Mr. Carlisle has made me through all my life kinder to boys than I\r\nmight otherwise have been; and if, as a teacher, I have been popular\r\namong them, it was to a great degree due to his influence.  For, as will\r\nappear in many passages in this book, I have to a strange degree the\r\nhabit of thinking over marked past experiences, and drawing from them\r\nprecedents by which to guide my conduct; hence it has often happened that\r\na single incident has shown itself in hundreds of others, as a star is\r\nreflected in countless pools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  BOYHOOD AND YOUTH.  1837-1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn to Philadelphia at twelve years of age--Early discipline--School\r\nat Mr. C. Walker's--B. P. Hunt--My first reading of Rabelais--Mr. Robert\r\nStewart--Hurlbut's school--Boyish persecution--Much strange\r\nreading--Francois Villon--Early studies in philosophy--Transcendentalism\r\nand its influence--Spanish--School of E.

Boker--Jacob Behmen or Bohme--Stonington--Captain Nat Palmer and\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt--My graduation.\r\n\r\nHow happy I was again to see my mother and father and Henry!  And then\r\ncame other joys.  My father had taken a very nice house in Walnut Street,\r\nin the best quarter of the city, below Thirteenth Street, and this was a\r\nsource of pleasure, as was also a barrel of apples in the cellar, to\r\nwhich I had free access.  They had been doled out to us very sparingly at\r\nschool, and I never shall forget the delight with which I one day in\r\nDecember at Jamaica Plain discovered a frozen apple on a tree!  Then\r\nthere was the charm of being in a great city, and familiar old scenes,\r\nand the freedom from bad marks, and being ruled into bounds, and sent to\r\nbed at early hours.  There is, in certain cases, a degree of moral\r\nrestraint and discipline which is often carried much too far, especially\r\nwhere boys are brought up with a view to pushing themselves in the world.\r\nI was sixteen years of age and six feet high before I was allowed to\r\nleave off short jackets, go to a theatre, or travel alone, all of which\r\nwas more injurious to me, I believe, than ordinary youthful dissipation\r\nwould have been, especially in America.  Yet, while thus repressed, I was\r\nbeing continually referred by all grown-up friends to enterprising youth\r\nof my own age, who were making a living in bankers' or conveyancers'\r\noffices, &c., and acting \"like men.\"  The result really being that I was\r\ncompletely convinced that I was a person of feeble and inferior capacity\r\nas regarded all that was worth doing or knowing in life, though Heaven\r\nknows my very delicate health and long illnesses might of themselves have\r\nexcused all my failings.  The vast majority of Americans, however kind\r\nand generous they may be in other respects, are absolutely without mercy\r\nor common-sense as regards the not succeeding in life or making money.\r\nSuch, at least, was my experience, and bitter it was.  Elders often\r\nforget that even obedience, civility, and morality in youth are luxuries\r\nwhich must be paid for like all other extravagances at a high price,\r\nespecially in children of feeble constitution.  The dear boy grows up \"as\r\ngood as pie,\" and, being pious, \"does not know one card from another,\"\r\nnor one human being from another.  You make of him a fool, and then call\r\nhim one--I mean, what you regard as a fool.  I am not at all sure that\r\none or two cruises in a slaver (there were plenty of them sailing out of\r\nNew York in those days) would not have done me far more good of a certain\r\nkind than all the education I had till I left college in America.  I am\r\nnot here complaining, as most weak men do, as if they were specially\r\nvictims to a wretched fate and a might-have-been-better.  The vast\r\nmajority of boys have not better homes or education, kinder parents, or\r\nadvantages greater than mine were.  But as I do not recall my boyhood's\r\ndays or my youth till I left college with that _joyousness_ which I find\r\nin other men without exception, and as, in fact, there always seems as if\r\na cloud were over it all, while from below there was a low continual\r\nmurmur as of a patient soul in pain, I feel that there was something\r\nwrong in it all, as there indeed was--the wrong of taking all the starch\r\nout of a shirt, and then wondering that it was not stiff.  But I must\r\nsay, at the same time, that this free expansion is not required by the\r\nvast majority of boys, who are only far too ready and able to spread\r\nthemselves into \"life\" without any aid whatever.  What is for one meat\r\nmay be for another poison, and mine was a very exceptional case, which\r\nrequired very peculiar treatment.\r\n\r\nMy father had sold out his business in 1832 to Mr. Charles S. Boker, and\r\nsince then been principally engaged in real estate and stock speculation.\r\nWhen I returned, he had bought a large property between Chestnut Market\r\nand Third Streets, on which was a hotel called Congress Hall, with which\r\nthere were connected many historical associations, for most of the noted\r\nmen who for many years visited Philadelphia had lived in it.  With it\r\nwere stables and other buildings, covering a great deal of ground in the\r\nbusiest portion of the city, but still not in its condition very\r\nprofitable.  Then, again, he purchased the old Arch Street prison, a vast\r\ngloomy pile, like four dead walls, a building nearly 400 feet square.  It\r\nwas empty, and I went over it and into the cells many times.  I remember\r\nthinking of the misery and degradation of those who had been confined\r\nthere.  The discipline had been bad enough, for the prisoners had been\r\nallowed to herd freely together.  My father tore it down, and built a\r\nblock of handsome dwelling-houses on its site.  As the _trottoir_ or side-\r\nwalk was narrow, he, at a considerable loss to himself, made a present to\r\nthe city of a strip of land which left a wide pavement.  I say \"at a\r\nloss,\" for had the houses been deeper they would have sold for much more.\r\nThe City Council graciously accepted the gift, with the special condition\r\nthat my father should pay all the expenses of the transfer!  From which I\r\nlearned the lesson that in this life a man is quite as liable to suffer\r\nfrom doing good as doing evil, unless he employs just as much foresight\r\nor caution in the doing thereof.  Some of the most deeply regretted acts\r\nof my life, which have caused me most sincere and oft-renewed repentance,\r\nwere altogether and perfectly acts of generosity and goodness.  The\r\nsimple truth of which is that a _gush_, no matter how sweet and pure the\r\nwater may be, generally displaces something.  Many more buildings did my\r\nfather buy and sell, but committed withal the very serious error of never\r\nbuying a house as a permanent home or a country place, which he might\r\nhave easily done, and even to great profit, which error in the long-run\r\ncaused us all great inconvenience, and much of that shifting from place\r\nto place which is very bad for a growing family.  The humblest man in\r\nsuch case in a house of his own has certain great advantages over even a\r\nmillionaire in lodgings.\r\n\r\nMr. S. C. Walker had given over his school to a younger brother named\r\nJoseph, but it was still kept in the old house in Eighth Street, where\r\nalso I had taken my lessons in the rudiments of Transcendentalism from\r\nthe Orphic Alcott.  It was now a fairly good school as things went in\r\nthose days, with the same lectures in Natural Philosophy and\r\nChemistry--the same mild doses of French and Latin.  The chief assistant\r\nwas E. Otis Kimball, subsequently a professor of astronomy, a very\r\ngentlemanly and capable instructor, of a much higher type than any\r\nassistant-teacher whom I had ever before met.  Under him I read\r\nVoltaire's \"Charles the Twelfth.\"  George H. Boker, who was one year\r\nolder than I, and the son of my father's old partner, went to this\r\nschool.  I do not remember that for the first year or eighteen mouths\r\nafter my return to Philadelphia there was any incident of note in my\r\nlife, or that I read anything unless it was Shakespeare, and reviews\r\nwhich much influenced me.  However, I was very wisely allowed to attend a\r\ngymnasium, kept by a man named Hudson.  Here there was a sporting tone,\r\nmuch pistol-shooting at a mark, boxing and fencing, prints of\r\nprize-fighters on the wall, and cuts from _Life in London_, with copious\r\ncigar-smoke.  It was a wholesome, healthy place for me.  Unfortunately, I\r\ncould not afford the shooting, boxing, &c., but I profited somewhat by\r\nit, both morally and physically.  At this critical period, or a little\r\nlater, a few pounds a year judiciously invested in sport and\r\n\"dissipation\" would have changed the whole current of my life, probably\r\nmuch for the better, and it would certainly have spared my poor father\r\nthe conviction, which he had almost to his death, that I was a sad and\r\nmortifying failure or exception which had not paid its investment; for\r\nwhich opinion he was in no wise to blame, it being also that of all his\r\nbusiness acquaintances, many of whose sons, it was true, went utterly to\r\nthe devil, but then it was in the ancient intelligible, common-sensible,\r\nusual paths of gambling, horsing, stock-brokering, selling short, or\r\nruining all their relatives by speculating with their money.  However,\r\nthere was also the--rather forlorn--hope ahead that I would do something\r\nin a profession.\r\n\r\nThe school went on, Mr. Walker studying law meantime till he had passed\r\nhis examination, when it was transferred to Mr. B. P. Hunt.  With this\r\nman, who became and remained my intimate friend till his death, thirty\r\nyears after, came the first faint intimation of what was destined to be\r\nthe most critical, the most singular, and by far the most important\r\nperiod of my life.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt was, as he himself declared to me in after years, not at all\r\nfitted to be a schoolmaster.  He lacked the minor or petty earnestness of\r\ncharacter, and even the training or preparation, necessary for such work.\r\nOn the other hand, he had read a great deal in a desultory way; he was\r\nvery fond of all kinds of easy literature; and when he found that any boy\r\nunderstood the subject, he would talk with that boy about whatever he had\r\nbeen reading.  Yet there was something real and stimulative in him, for\r\nthere never was a man in Philadelphia who kept school for so short a time\r\nand with so few pupils who had among them so many who in after life\r\nbecame more or less celebrated.  For he certainly made all of us who were\r\nabove idiocy think and live in thought above the ordinary range of school-\r\nboy life.  Thus I can recall these two out of many incidents:--\r\n\r\nFinding me one day at an old book-stand, he explained to me Alduses, and\r\nElzevirs, and bibliography, showing me several specimens, all of which I\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nI had read Watson's \"Annals of Philadelphia.\"  [By the way, I knew the\r\ndaughter of the author.]  There was an allusion in it to Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, and Mr. Hunt explained and dilated on this great sorcerer to me\r\ntill I became half crazy to read the \"Occult Philosophy,\" which I did at\r\na roaring rate two years later.\r\n\r\nOne day I saw Mr. Hunt and Mr. Kendall chuckling together over a book.  I\r\ndivined a secret.  Now, I was a very honourable boy, and never pried into\r\nsecrets, but where a quaint old book was concerned I had no more\r\nconscience than a pirate.  And seeing Mr. Hunt put the book into his\r\ndesk, I abode my time till he had gone forth, when I raised the lid, and\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nMerciful angels and benevolent fairies! it was Urquhart's translation of\r\nRabelais!  One short spell I read, no more; but it raised a devil which\r\nhas never since been laid.  Ear hath not heard, it hath not entered into\r\nthe heart of man to conceive, what I felt as I realised, like a young\r\ngiant just awakened, that there was in me a stupendous mental strength to\r\ngrasp and understand that magnificent mixture of ribaldry and learning,\r\nfun and wisdom, deviltry and divinity.  In a few pages' time I knew what\r\nit all meant, and that I was gifted to understand it.  I replaced the\r\nbook; nor did I read it again for years, but from that hour I was never\r\nquite the same person.  The next day I saw Callot's \"Temptation of St.\r\nAnthony\" for the first time in a shop-window, and felt with joy and pride\r\nthat I understood it out of Rabelais.  Two young gentlemen--lawyers\r\napparently--by my side thought it was crazy and silly.  To me it was more\r\nlike an apocalypse.\r\n\r\nI am speaking plain truth when I say that that one quarter of an hour's\r\nreading of Rabelais--standing up--was to me as the light which flashed\r\nupon Saul journeying to Damascus.  It seems to me now as if it were the\r\ngreat event of my life.  It came to such a pass in after years that I\r\ncould have identified any line in the Chronicle of Gargantua, and I also\r\nwas the suggester, father, and founder in London of the Rabelais Club, in\r\nwhich were many of the best minds of the time, but beyond it all and\r\nbrighter than all was that first revelation.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that I had already perused Sterne, much of Swift,\r\nand far more comic and satiric literature than is known to boys, and,\r\nwhat is far more remarkable, had thoroughly taken it all into my _cor\r\ncordium_ by much repetition and reflection.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt in time put me up to a great deal of very valuable or curious\r\n_belletristic_ fair-lettered or black-lettered reading, far beyond my\r\nyears, though not beyond my intelligence and love.  We had been\r\naccustomed to pass to our back-gate of the school through Blackberry\r\nAlley--\r\n\r\n   \"Blackberry Alley, now Duponceau Street,\r\n   A rose by any name will smell as sweet\"--\r\n\r\nwhich was tenanted principally by social evils.  He removed to the corner\r\nof Seventh and Chestnut Streets.  Under our schoolroom there was a\r\ngambling den.  I am not aware that these surroundings had any effect\r\nwhatever upon the pupils.  Among the pupils in Seventh Street was one\r\nnamed Emile Tourtelot.  We called him Oatmeal Turtledove.  I had another\r\nfriend who was newly come from Connecticut.  His uncle kept a hotel and\r\noften gave him Havanna cigars.  We often took long walks together out of\r\ntown and smoked them.  He taught me the song--\r\n\r\n   \"On Springfield mountains there did dwell,\"\r\n\r\nwith much more quaint rural New England lore.\r\n\r\nAbout this time my grandfather Leland died.  I wept sadly on hearing it.\r\nMy father, who went to Holliston to attend the funeral, brought me back a\r\nfine collection of Indian stone relics and old American silver coins, for\r\nhe had been in his way an antiquarian.  _Bon sang ne peut mentir_.  I had\r\nalso the certificate of some Society or Order of Revolutionary soldiers\r\nto which he had belonged.  One of his brothers had, as an officer, a\r\nmembership of the hereditary Order of the Cincinnati.  This passed to\r\nanother branch of the family.\r\n\r\nFor many years the principal regular visitor at our house was Mr. Robert\r\nStewart, a gentleman of good family and excellent education, who had\r\nduring the wars with Napoleon made an adventurous voyage to France, and\r\nsubsequently passed most of his life as Consul or diplomatic agent in\r\nCuba.  He had brought with him from Cuba a black Ebo-African slave named\r\nJuan.  As the latter seemed to be discontented in Philadelphia, Mr.\r\nStewart, who was kindness itself, offered to send him back freed to Cuba\r\nor Africa, and told him he might buy a modest outfit of clothing, such as\r\nsuited his condition.  The negro went to a first-class tailor and ordered\r\nsplendid clothes, which were sent back, of course.  The vindictive Ebo\r\nwas so angry at this, that one summer afternoon, while Mr. Stewart slept,\r\nthe former fell on him with an axe and knife, mangled his head horribly,\r\ncut the cords of his hand, &c., and thought he had killed him.  But\r\nhearing his victim groan, he was returning, when he met another servant,\r\nwho said, \"Juan, where are you going?\"  He replied, \"Me begin to kill\r\nMars' Stewart--now me go back finish him!\"  He was, of course, promptly\r\narrested.  Mr. Stewart recovered, but was always blind of one eye, and\r\nhis right hand was almost useless.  Mr. Stewart had in his diplomatic\r\ncapacity seen many of the pirates who abounded on the Spanish Main in\r\nthose days.  He was an admirable _raconteur_, abounding in reminiscences.\r\nHis son William inherited from an uncle a Cuban estate worth millions of\r\ndollars, and lived many years in Paris.  He was a great patron of\r\n(especially Spanish) art.\r\n\r\nSo I passed on to my fourteenth year, which was destined to be the\r\nbeginning of the most critical period of my life.  My illnesses had\r\nincreased in number and severity, and I had shot up into a very tall weak\r\nyouth.  Mr. Hunt gave up teaching, and became editor of _Littell's\r\nMagazine_.  I was sent to the school of Mr. Hurlbut--as I believe it was\r\nthen spelled, but I may be wrong.  He had been a Unitarian clergyman, but\r\nwas an ungenial, formal, rather harsh man--the very opposite of Mr. Hunt.\r\nMy schoolmates soon found that though so tall, I was physically very\r\nweak, and many of them continually bullied and annoyed me.  Once I was\r\ndriven into a formal stand-up fight with one younger by a year, but much\r\nstronger.  I did my best, but was beaten.  I offered to fight him then in\r\nIndian fashion with a hug, but this he scornfully declined.  After this\r\nhe never met me without insulting me, for he had a base nature, as his\r\nafter-life proved.  These humiliations had a bad effect upon me, for I\r\nwas proud and nervous, and, like many such boys, often very foolish.\r\n\r\nBut I had a few very good friends.  Among these was Charles Macalester.\r\nOne day when I had been bullied shamefully by the knot of boys who always\r\ntreated me badly, he ran after me up Walnut Street, and, almost with\r\ntears in his eyes, assured me of his sympathy.  There were two other\r\nintimates.  George Patrullo, of Spanish parentage, and Richard Seldener,\r\nson of the Swedish Consul.  They read a great deal.  One day it chanced\r\nthat Seldener had in his bosom a very large old-fashioned flint-lock\r\nhorse-pistol loaded with shot.  By him and me stood Patrullo and William\r\nHenry Hurlbut, who has since become a very well-known character.  Thinking\r\nthat Seldener's pistol was unloaded, Patrullo, to frighten young Hurlbut,\r\npulled the weapon suddenly from Seldener's breast, put it between\r\nHurlbut's eyes and fired.  The latter naturally started to one side, so\r\nit happened that he only received one shot in his ear.  The charge went\r\ninto the wall, where it made a mark like a bullet's, which was long\r\nvisible.  George Patrullo was drowned not long after while swimming in\r\nthe Schuylkill river, and Richard Seldener perished on an Atlantic\r\nsteamer, which was never heard of.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, something took place which cast a marvellous light\r\ninto this darkened life of mine.  For one day my father bought and\r\npresented to me a share in the Philadelphia Library.  This was a\r\ncollection which even then consisted of more than 60,000 well-chosen\r\nvolumes.  And then began such a life of reading as was, I sincerely\r\nbelieve, unusual in such youth.  My first book was \"Arthur of Little\r\nBritaine,\" which I finished in a week; then \"Newes from New Englande,\r\n1636,\" and the \"Historie of Clodoaldus.\"  Before long I discovered that\r\nthere were in the Loganian section of the library several hundred volumes\r\nof occult philosophy, a collection once formed by an artist named Cox,\r\nand of these I really read nearly every one.  Cornelius Agrippa and\r\nBarret's \"Magus,\" Paracelsus, the black-letter edition of Reginald Scot,\r\nGlanville, and Gaffarel, Trithemius, Baptista Porta, and God knows how\r\nmany Rosicrucian writers became familiar to me.  Once when I had only\r\ntwenty-five cents I gave it for a copy of \"Waters of the East\" by\r\nEugenius Philalethes, or Thomas Vaughan.\r\n\r\nAll of this led me to the Mystics and Quietists.  I read Dr. Boardman's\r\n\"History of Quakerism,\" which taught me that Fox grew out of Behmen; and\r\nI picked up one day Poiret's French work on the Mystics, which was quite\r\na handbook or guide to the whole literature.  But these books were but a\r\nsmall part of what I read; for at one time, taking another turn towards\r\nold English, I went completely through Chaucer and Gower, both in black\r\nletter, the collections of Ritson, Weber, Ellis, and I know not how many\r\nmore of mediaeval ballads and romances, and very thoroughly and earnestly\r\nindeed Warton's \"History of English Poetry.\"  Then I read Sismondi's\r\n\"Literature of Southern Europe\" and Longfellow's \"Poets and Poetry of\r\nEurope,\" which set me to work on Raynouard and other collections of\r\nProvencal poetry, in the knowledge of which I made some progress, and\r\nalso St. Pelaye's, Le Grand's, Costello's, and other books on the\r\nTrouveurs.  I translated into rhyme and sent to a magazine, of which I in\r\nafter years became editor, one or two _lais_, which were rejected, I\r\nthink unwisely, for they were by no means bad.  Then I had a fancy for\r\nMiscellanea, and read the works of D'Israeli the elder and Burton's\r\n\"Anatomy.\"\r\n\r\nOne day I made a startling discovery, for I took at a venture from the\r\nlibrary the black-letter first edition of the poems of Francois Villon.  I\r\nwas then fifteen years old.  Never shall I forget the feeling, which\r\nHeine compares to the unexpected finding of a shaft of gold in a gloomy\r\nmine, which shot through me as I read for the first time these\r\n_ballades_.  Now-a-days people are trained to them through second-hand\r\nsentiment.  Villon has become--Heaven bless the mark!--_fashionable_! and\r\naesthetic.  I got at him \"straight\" out of black-letter reading in\r\nboyhood as a find of my own, and it was many, many years ere I ever met\r\nwith a single soul who had heard of him.  I at once translated the \"Song\r\nof the Ladies of the Olden Time\"; and I knew what _bon bec_ meant, which\r\nis more than one of Villon's great modern translators has done!  Also\r\n_heaulmiere_, which is _not_ helmet-maker, as another supposes.\r\n\r\nI went further in this field than I have room to describe.  I even read\r\nthe rococo-sweet poems of Joachim du Bellay.  In this year my father gave\r\nme \"The Doctor,\" by Robert Southey, a work which I read and re-read\r\nassiduously for many years, and was guided by it to a vast amount of odd\r\nreading, Philemon Holland's translation of Pliny being one of the books.\r\nThis induced me to read all of Southey's poems, which I did, not from the\r\nlibrary, but from a bookstore, where I had free run and borrowing\r\nprivileges, as I well might, since my father lost 4,000 pounds by its\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nWhile at Mr. Greene's school I had given me Alsopp's \"Life and Letters of\r\nColeridge,\" which I read through many times; then in my thirteenth year,\r\nin Philadelphia, I read with great love Charles Lamb's works and most of\r\nthe works of Coleridge.  Mr. Alcott had read Wordsworth into us in\r\nillimitable quantities, so that I soon had a fair all-round knowledge of\r\nthe Lakers, whom I dearly loved.  Now there was a certain _soupcon_ of\r\nMysticism or Transcendentalism and Pantheism in Coleridge, and even in\r\nWordsworth, which my love of rocks and rivers and fairy lore easily\r\nenabled me to detect by sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut all of this was but a mere preparation for and foreshadowing of a\r\ngreat mental development and very precocious culture which was rapidly\r\napproaching.  I now speak of what happened to me from 1838 to 1840,\r\nprincipally in the latter year.  If I use extravagant, vain words, I beg\r\nthe reader to pardon me.  Perhaps this will never be published, therefore\r\n_sit verbo venia_!\r\n\r\nI had become deeply interested in the new and bold development which was\r\nthen manifesting itself in the Unitarian Church.  Channing, whom I often\r\nheard preach, had something in common with the Quietists; Mr. Furness was\r\nreally a thinker \"out of bounds,\" while in reality as gentle and purely\r\nChristian as could be.  There was something new in the air, and this\r\nSomething I, in an antiquated form, had actually preceded.  It was really\r\nonly a _rechauffe_ of the Neo-Platonism which lay at the bottom of\r\nPorphyry, Proclus, Psellus, Jamblichus, with all of whom I was fairly\r\nwell acquainted.  Should any one doubt this, I can assure him that I\r\nstill possess a full copy of the \"Poemander\" or \"Pimander\" of Hermes\r\nTrismegistus, made by me in my sixteenth year, which most assuredly no\r\nmortal could ever have understood or made, or cared to make, if he had\r\nnot read the Neo-Platonists; for Marsilius Ficinus himself regarded this\r\nwork as a pendant to them, and published it as such.  Which work I\r\ndeclared was not a Christian Platonic forgery, but based on old Egyptian\r\nworks, as has since been well-nigh proved from recent discoveries.  (I\r\nthink it was Dr. Garnett who, hearing me once declare in the British\r\nMuseum that I believed Hermes was based on an ancient Egyptian text, sent\r\nfor a French work in which the same view was advanced.)\r\n\r\nThe ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and _odium theologicum_ which prevailed\r\nin America until 1840 was worse than that in Europe under the Church in\r\nthe Middle Ages, for even in the latter there had been an Agobard and an\r\nAbelard, Knight-Templar agnostics, and _illuminati_ of different kinds.\r\nThe Unitarians, who believed firmly in every point of Christianity, and\r\nthat man was saved by Jesus, and would be damned if he did not put faith\r\nin him as the Son of God, were regarded literally and truly by everybody\r\nas no better than infidels because they believed that Christ was _sent_\r\nby God, and that Three could not be One.  Every sect, with rare\r\nexceptions, preached, especially the Presbyterians, that the vast\r\nmajority even of Christians would be damned, thereby giving to the devil\r\nthat far greater power than God against which Bishop Agobard had\r\nprotested.  As for a freethinker or infidel, he was pointed at in the\r\nstreets; and if a man had even seen a \"Deist,\" he spoke of it as if he\r\nhad beheld a murderer.  Against all this some few were beginning to\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\nThere came a rumour that there was something springing up in Boston\r\ncalled Transcendentalism.  Nobody knew what it was, but it was dreamy,\r\nmystical, crazy, and infideleterious to religion.  Firstly, it was\r\nconnected with Thomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and finally with\r\neverything German.  The new school of liberal Unitarians favoured it.  I\r\nhad a quick intuition that here was something for me to work at.  I\r\nbought Carlyle's _Sartor Resartus_, first edition, and read it through\r\nforty times ere I left college, of which I \"kept count.\"\r\n\r\nMy record here as regards some books may run a little ahead; but either\r\nbefore I went to college or during my first year there (almost all before\r\nor by 1840-'41), I had read Carlyle's \"Miscellanies\" thoroughly,\r\nEmerson's \"Essays,\" a translation of Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason,\"\r\nthe first half of it many times; Dugald Stewart's works, something of\r\nReid, Locke, and Hobbes's \"Leviathan\"; had bought and read French\r\nversions of Schelling's \"Transcendental Idealism\" and Fichte's\r\nfascinating \"Destiny of Man\"; studied a small handbook of German\r\nphilosophy; the works of Campanella and Vanini (Bruno much later, for his\r\nworks were then exceeding rare.  I now have Weber's edition), and also,\r\nwith intense relish and great profit, an old English version of Spinoza's\r\n_Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_.  In which last work I had the real key\r\nand clue to all German philosophy and Rationalism, as I in time found\r\nout.  I must here modestly mention that I had, to a degree which I\r\nhonestly believe seldom occurs, the art of _rapid_ yet of\r\ncarefully-observant reading.  George Boker once, quite unknown to me,\r\ngave me something to read, watched my eyes as I went from line to line,\r\ntimed me by watch, and finally examined me on what I had read.  He\r\npublished the incident long after, said he had repeated it more than once\r\n_a mon insu_, and that it was remarkable.\r\n\r\nSuch a dual life as I at this time led it has seldom entered into the\r\nhead of man to imagine.  I was, on the one hand, a school-boy in a\r\njacket, leading a humiliated life among my kind, all because I was sickly\r\nand weak; while, on the other hand, utterly alone and without a living\r\nsoul to whom I could exchange an idea, I was mastering rapidly and boldly\r\nthat which was _then_ in reality the tremendous problem of the age.  I\r\ncan now see that, as regards its _real_ antique bases, I was far more\r\ndeeply read and better grounded than were even its most advanced leaders\r\nin Anglo-Saxony.  For I soon detected in Carlyle, and much more in\r\nEmerson, a very slender knowledge of that stupendous and marvellous\r\nancient Mysticism which sent its soul in burning faith and power to the\r\ndepth of \"the downward-borne elements of God,\" as Hermes called them.  I\r\nmissed even the rapt faith of such a weak writer as Sir Kenelm Digby,\r\nmuch more Zoroaster!  Vigourous and clever and bold writers they\r\nwere--Carlyle was far beyond me in literary _art_--but true Pantheists\r\nthey were _not_.  And they were men of great genius, issuing essays to\r\nthe age on popular, or political, or \"literary\" topics; but\r\n_philosophers_ they most assuredly were _not_, nor men tremendous in\r\nspiritual truth.  And yet it was precisely as _philosophers_ and\r\nthaumaturgists and revealers of _occulta_ that they posed--especially\r\nEmerson.  And they dabbled or trifled with free thought and \"immorality,\"\r\ncrying Goethe up as the Light of Lights, while all their inner souls were\r\nbound in the most Puritanical and petty goody-goodyism.  Though there\r\nwere traces of grim Scotch humour in Carlyle, my patron saint and master,\r\nRabelais, or aught like him, had no credit with them.\r\n\r\nThey _paddled_ in Pantheism, but as regards it, both lacked the\r\nstupendous faith and inspiration of the old adepti, who flung their whole\r\nsouls into God; and yet they sneered at Materialism and Science.\r\n\r\nI did not then see _all_ of this so clearly as I now do, but I very soon\r\nfound that, as in after years it was said that Comteism was Catholicism\r\nwithout Christianity, so the Carlyle-Emersonian Transcendentalism was\r\nMysticism without mystery.  Nor did I reflect that it was a calling\r\npeople from the nightmared slumber of frozen orthodoxy or bigotry to come\r\nand see a marvellous new thing.  And when they came, they found out that\r\nthis marvellous thing was that they had been _awakened_, \"only that and\r\nnothing more\"; and _that_ was the great need of the time, and worth more\r\nthan any magic or theosophy.  But I had expected, in simple ignorant\r\nfaith, that the sacred mysteries of some marvellous cabala would be\r\nrevealed, and not finding what I wanted (though indeed I discovered much\r\nthat was worldly new to me), I returned to the good old ghost-haunted\r\npaths trodden by my ancestors, to dryads and elves and voices from the\r\nstars, and the _archaeus_ formed by the astral spirit (not the modern\r\nBlavatsky affair, by-the-bye), which entyped all things . . . and so went\r\nelving and dreaming on 'mid ruins old.\r\n\r\nBe it observed that all this time I really did not know what I knew.  Boys\r\nare greatly influenced by their surroundings, and in those days every one\r\nabout me never spoke of Transcendentalism or \"Germanism,\" or even\r\n\"bookishness,\" without a sneer.  I was borne by a mysterious inner\r\nimpulse which I could not resist into this terrible whirlpool of _belles-\r\nlettres_, occulta, facetiae, and philosophy; but I had, God knows, little\r\ncause for pride that I read so much, for it was on every hand in some way\r\nturned against me.  If it had only been reading like that of other human\r\nbeings, it might have been endured; but I was always seen coming and\r\ngoing with parchment-bound tomes.  Once I implored my father, when I was\r\nthirteen or fourteen, to let me buy a certain book, which he did.  This\r\nwork, which was as dear to me as a new doll to a girl for a long time,\r\nwas the _Reductorium_ or moralisation of the whole Bible by Petrus\r\nBerchorius, black-letter, folio, Basle, 1511.  It was from the library of\r\na great and honest scholar, and, as the catalogue stated, \"contained MS.\r\nnotes on the margin by Melanchthon.\"\r\n\r\nPromising, this, for an American youth who was expected to go into\r\nbusiness or study a profession!\r\n\r\nWhile at Hurlbut's school I took lessons in Spanish.  There was a Spanish\r\nboy from Malaga, a kind of half-servant, _half-protege_ in a family near\r\nus, with whom I practised speaking the language, and also had some\r\nopportunity with a few Cubans who visited our family.  One of them had\r\nbeen a governor-general.  He was a Gallician by birth, but I did not know\r\nthis, and innocently asked him one day if _los Gallegos no son los\r\nIrlandeses d'Espana_?--if the Gallicians were not the Irish of\r\nSpain--which drew a grave caution from my brother, who knew better than I\r\nhow the land lay.  I really attained some skill in Spanish, albeit to\r\nthis day \"Don Quixote\" demands from me a great deal of dictionary.  But,\r\nas I said before, I learn languages with _incredible_ difficulty, a fact\r\nwhich I cannot reconcile with the extreme interest which I take in\r\nphilology and linguistics, and the discoveries which I have made; as, for\r\ninstance, that of _Shelta_ in England, or my labours in jargons, such as\r\nPidgin-English, Slang, and Romany.  But, as the reader has probably\r\nperceived, I was a boy with an inherited good constitution only from the\r\npaternal side, and a not very robust one from my mother, while my mind,\r\nweakened by long illness, had been strangely stimulated by many\r\ndisorders, nervous fevers being frequent among them.  In those days I\r\nwas, as my mother said, almost brought up on calomel--and she might have\r\nadded quinine.  The result of so much nervousness, excessive stimulating\r\nby medicine, and rapid growth was a too great susceptibility to poetry,\r\nhumour, art, and all that was romantic, quaint, and mysterious, while I\r\nfound it very hard to master any really dry subject.  What would have set\r\nme all right would have been careful physical culture, boxing, so as to\r\nprotect me from my school persecutors, and _amusement_ in a healthy\r\nsense, of which I had almost none whatever.\r\n\r\nHurlbut's became at last simply intolerable, and my parents, finding out\r\nin some way that I was worse for being there, removed me to a far better\r\nschool kept by E. C. Wines, who had written books on education, and\r\nattained some fame thereby.  This was in 1839-'40, and I was there to be\r\nprepared for college.  We were soon introduced to an old French\r\ngentleman, who was to teach us, and who asked the other boys what French\r\nworks they had read.  Some had gone through _Telemaque_, or _Paul et\r\nVirginie_, _Florian_, _etcetera_.  The good-goody nature of such reading\r\nawoke in me my sense of humour.  When it came to my turn, and I was\r\nasked, I replied, \"_La Pucelle d'Orleans_ and _Dictionnaire\r\nPhilosophique_ of Voltaire, the Confessions of Rousseau, the Poems of\r\nVillon, _Charles d'Orleans_, _Clotilde de Surville_, and more or less of\r\nHelvetius, D'Holbach, and Condillac.\"  Here the professor, feeling\r\nhimself quizzed, cast forth his hands as in disgust and horror, and\r\ncried, \"_Assez_! _assez_!  Unhappy boy, you have raked through the\r\nlibrary of the devil down to the dregs!\"  Nor was I \"selling\" him, for I\r\ncertainly had read the works, as the records of the Philadelphia Library\r\ncan in a great measure prove, and did not speak by hearsay.\r\n\r\nI had at this time several severe long attacks of illness with much pain,\r\nwhich I always bore well, as a matter of course or habit.  But rather\r\noddly, while in the midst of my Transcendentalism, and reading every\r\nscrap of everything about Germany which I could get, and metaphysics, and\r\nstudy--I was very far gone then, and used to go home from school and\r\nlight a pipe with a long wooden stem, and study the beloved \"Critic of\r\nPure Reason\" or Carlyle's Miscellanies, having discovered that smoking\r\nwas absolutely necessary in such reading--[De Quincey required a quart of\r\nlaudanum to enable him to enjoy German metaphysics]--there came a strange\r\ngleam of worldly dissipation, of which I never think without pleasure.  I\r\nhad passed one summer vacation on a farm near Philadelphia, where I\r\nlearned something in wood-ranging about wild herbs and catching\r\nland-tortoises and \"coon-hunting,\" and had been allowed to hire and ride\r\na horse.\r\n\r\nI did not know it, but this horse had thrown over his head everybody who\r\nhad ever mounted him.  He was a perfect devil, but also a perfect\r\ngentleman.  He soon took my measure, and resolved to treat me kindly as a\r\n_protege_.  When we both wanted a gallop, he made such time as nobody\r\nbefore had dreamed was in him; when he was lazy, he only had to turn his\r\nhead and look at me, and I knew what that meant and conformed unto him.\r\nHe had a queer fancy at times to quietly steal up and put his hoof on my\r\nfoot so as to hurt me, and then there was an impish laugh in his eye.  For\r\nhe laughed at me, and I knew it.  There is really such a thing as a horse-\r\nlaugh.  One day we passed through a drove of sheep, and he did not like\r\nit--no horse does.  After a while I wanted to go by a certain road, but\r\nhe refused sternly to take it.  I found soon after that if I had done so\r\nwe must have met the sheep again.  He had, in fact, understood the route\r\nfar better than I.  I once got a mile out of him in three minutes--more\r\nor less; but he had seen me look at my watch, and knew that I wanted to\r\nsee what he could do.  He never did it again.  I _may_ have been mistaken\r\nhere, but it was my impression at the time.  Perhaps if I had gone on\r\nmuch longer in intimacy with him I might have profited mentally by it,\r\nand acquired what Americans call \"horse-sense,\" of which I had some need.\r\nIt is the sixth--or the first--sense of all Yankees and Scotchmen.  When\r\nI returned to the city I was allowed to hire a horse for a few times from\r\na livery stable, and went out riding with a friend.  This friend was a\r\nrather precociously dissipated youth, and with him I had actually now and\r\nthen--very rarely--a glass at a bar and oysters.  He soon left me for\r\nwilder associates, and I relapsed into my old sober habits.  Strange as\r\nit may seem, I believe that I was really on the brink of becoming like\r\nother boys.  But it all faded away.  Now it became imperative that I\r\nshould study in earnest.  I used to rise at three or four in the morning.\r\nWhat with hard work and great fear of not passing my matriculation, I\r\ncontrived to get up so much Latin, Greek, and mathematics, that Mr. Wines\r\nthought I might attempt it, and so one fine summer day my father went\r\nwith me to Princeton.  I was in a fearful state of nervous anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCETON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went to Princeton, where I presented my letters of introduction,\r\npassed a by no means severe examination for the Freshman's class, was\r\nvery courteously received by the professors to whom I was commended, and,\r\nto my inexpressible delight, found myself a college student.  Rooms were\r\nsecured for me at a Mrs. Burroughs', opposite Nassau Hall; the adjoining\r\napartment was occupied by Mr. Craig Biddle, now a judge.  George H. Boker\r\nwas then at the end of his Sophomore year, the term having but a few days\r\nto run.  He had rooms in college and lived in unexampled style, having\r\nactually a carpet on his floor and superior furniture, also a good\r\ncollection of books, chiefly standard English poets.  He at once took me\r\nin hand and gave me a character.\r\n\r\nPrinceton College was entirely in the hands of the strictest of \"Old\r\nSchool\" Presbyterian theologians.  Piety and mathematics rated\r\nextravagantly high in the course.  The latter study was literally\r\nreckoned in the grades as being of more account than all the rest\r\ncollectively.  Thus, as eventually happened to me, a student might excel\r\nin Latin, English, and Natural Philosophy--in fact, in almost everything,\r\ngood conduct included--and yet be the last in the class if he neglected\r\nmathematics.  There was no teaching of French, because, as was naively\r\nsaid, students might read the irreligious works extant in that language,\r\nand of course no other modern language; as for German, one would as soon\r\nhave proposed to raise the devil there as a class in it.  If there had\r\nbeen an optional course, as at Cambridge, Massachusetts, by which German\r\nwas accepted in lieu of mathematics, I should probably have taken the\r\nfirst honour, instead of the last.  And yet, with a little more Latin, I\r\nwas really qualified, on the day when I matriculated at Princeton, to\r\nhave passed for a Doctor of Philosophy in Heidelberg, as I subsequently\r\naccurately ascertained.\r\n\r\nThere were three or four men of great ability in the Faculty of the\r\nUniversity.  One of these was Professor Joseph Henry, in those days the\r\nfirst natural philosopher and lecturer on science in America.  I had the\r\nfortune in time to become quite a special _protege_ of his.  Another was\r\nProfessor James Alexander, who taught Latin, rhetoric, and mental\r\nphilosophy.  He was so clear-headed and liberally learned, that I always\r\nfelt sure that he must at heart have been far beyond the bounds of Old\r\nSchool theology, but he had an iron Roman-like sternness of glance which\r\nquite suited a Covenanter.  The most remarkable of all was Albert Dodd,\r\nProfessor of Mathematics and Lecturer on Architecture.  This man was a\r\ngenius of such a high order, that had it not been for the false position\r\nin which he was placed, he would have given to the world great works.  The\r\nfalse position was this: he was the chief pulpit orator of the old\r\nschool, and had made war on the Transcendentalist movement in an able\r\narticle in the _Princeton Review_ (which, by the way, was useful in\r\nguiding me to certain prohibited works, before unknown to me).  But as he\r\nwas a man of poetic genial feeling, he found himself irresistibly\r\nfascinated by what he had hunted down, and so read Plato, and when he\r\ndied actually left behind him a manuscript translation of Spinoza's\r\nworks!\r\n\r\nThe reader may imagine what a marvellous _find_ I was to him.  George\r\nBoker, who was ages beyond me in knowledge of the world--man and\r\nwoman--said one day that he could imagine how Dodd sat and chuckled to\r\nhear me talk, which remark I did not at all understand and thought rather\r\nstupid.  I remember that during my first call on him we discussed _Sartor\r\nResartus_, and I expressed it as my firm conviction that the idea of the\r\nClothes Philosophy had been taken from the Treatise on Fire and Salt by\r\nthe Rosicrucian Lord Blaise.  Then, in all _naivete_ and innocence of\r\neffect, I discussed some point in Kant's \"Critic,\" and a few other\r\ntrifles not usually familiar to sub-Freshmen, and took my departure, very\r\nmuch pleased at having entered on a life where my favourite reading did\r\nnot really seem to be quite silly or disreputable.  I remember, however,\r\nbeing very much surprised indeed at finding that the other students, in\r\nwhom I expected to encounter miracles of learning, or youth far superior\r\nto myself in erudition and critical knowledge, did not quite come up to\r\nmy anticipations.  However, as they were all far beyond me in\r\nmathematics, I supposed their genius had all gone in that direction, for\r\nwell I knew that the toughest page in Fichte was a mere trifle compared\r\nto the awful terrors of the Rule of Three, and so treated them as young\r\nmen who were my superiors in other and greater things.\r\n\r\nThere were wearisome morning prayers in the chapel, and roll-call every\r\nmorning, and then an hour of recitation before breakfast, study till ten\r\nor eleven, study and recitation in the afternoon, and evening prayers\r\nagain and study in the evening.  The Sabbath was anything but a day of\r\nrest, for we had the same prayers; morning attendance at church;\r\nafternoon, the learning and reciting of _four chapters_ in the Bible;\r\nwhile we were expected in the evening to master one or two chapters in\r\nthe Greek Testament.  I am not sorry that I used to read books during\r\nsermon-time.  It kept me from, or from me, a great deal of wickedness.\r\n_Videlicet_:\r\n\r\nThe sermons consisted principally of assertion that man himself consisted\r\nchiefly of original sin.  As evil communications corrupt good manners, I\r\nmyself, being young and impressionable, began to believe that I too was\r\nan awful sinner.  Not knowing where else to look for it, I concluded that\r\nit consisted in my inability to learn mathematics.  I do not distinctly\r\nremember whether I prayed to Heaven that I might be able to cross the\r\nPons Asinorum, but \"anyway\" my prayer was granted when I graduated.\r\n\r\nAnother stock-piece in the _repertoire_ consisted of attacks on Voltaire,\r\nTom Paine, and other antiquated Deists or infidels.  I had read with\r\ngreat contempt a copy of \"The Rights of Man\" belonging to my genial uncle\r\nAmos.  I say with great contempt, for I always despised that kind of free\r\nthought which consisted chiefly of enmity to Christianity.  Now I can see\r\nthat Voltaire and his followers were quite in the right in warring on\r\nterrible and immediate abuses which oppressed mankind; but I had learned\r\nfrom Spinoza to believe that every form of faith was good in its way or\r\naccording to its mission or time, and that it was silly to ridicule\r\nChristianity because the tale of Balaam's ass was incredible.  Paine was\r\nto me just what a Positivist now is to a Darwinian or Agnostic, and such\r\npreaching against \"infidels\" seemed to me like pouring water on a drowned\r\nmouse.  There had always been in Mr. Furness's teaching a very decided\r\ndegree of Rationalism, and I had advanced far more boldly on the track.  I\r\nremember reading translations from Schleiermacher and buying Strauss's\r\n\"Life of Jesus\" before I went to Princeton--I saw Strauss himself in\r\nafter years at Weinsberg, in Germany--but at Princeton the slightest\r\napproach to explaining the most absurd story in the Old Testament was\r\nregarded as out-and-out atheism.  It had all happened, we were told, just\r\nas it is described.\r\n\r\nI may as well note here the fact that for many years in my early life\r\nsuch a thing as only reading a book through once rarely happened, when I\r\ncould obtain it long enough.  Even the translations of the\r\nNeo-Platonists, with Campanella, Vanini, or the Italian naturalists, were\r\nread and reread, while the principal English poets, and such books as I\r\nowned, were perused daily.\r\n\r\nAnd here in this great infant arithmetic school I was in due time set\r\ndown to study Paley's \"Evidences of Christianity\" and Locke on the\r\nUnderstanding--like Carlyle's young lion invited to a feast of chickweed.\r\nApropos of the first, I have a droll reminiscence.  There had been in\r\nPhiladelphia two years before a sale of a fine library, and I had been\r\nheart-broken because my means had not permitted me to buy the works of\r\nSir Kenelm Digby.  However, I found them in the Princeton College\r\nLibrary.  The first thing I came to in Paley was his famous simile of the\r\nwatch--taken bodily and without acknowledgment from Digby.  The theft\r\ndisgusted me.  \"These be your Christian champions!\" I thought--\r\n\r\n   \"Would any of the stock of infidels\r\n   Had been my evidence ere such a Christian!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, Paley forgets to inform us what conclusion the finder\r\nmight draw if he had picked up a badly made watch which did not keep good\r\ntime--like this our turnip of a world at times!\r\n\r\nAs we were obliged to attend divine service strictly on Sunday, I was\r\nallowed to go to the Episcopal church in the village, which agreed very\r\nwell with my parents' views.  I quite fell into the sentiment of the\r\nsect, and so went to Professor Dodd to ask for permission from the\r\nFaculty to change my religion.  When he asked me how it was that I had\r\nrenegaded into Trinitarianism, I replied that it was due to reflection on\r\nthe perfectly obvious and usual road of the Platonic hypostases eked out\r\nwith Gnosticism.  I had found in the College Library, and read with great\r\npleasure almost as soon as I got there, Cudworth's \"Intellectual System\"\r\n(I raided a copy as _loot_ from a house in Tennessee in after years,\r\nduring the war), and learned from it that \"it was a religious instinct of\r\nman to begin with a Trinity, in which I was much aided by Schelling, and\r\nthat there was no trace of a Trinity in the Bible, or rather the\r\ncontrary, yet that it _ought_ consistently to have been there\"--a\r\nsentiment which provoked from Professor Dodd a long whistle like that of\r\nUncle Toby with Lilliburlero.  \"For,\" as I ingeniously represented, \"man\r\nor God consists of the Monad from which developed spirit or intellect and\r\nsoul; for _toto enim in mundo lucet Trias cujus Monas est princeps_, as\r\nthe creed of the Rosicrucians begins (which is taken from the Zoroastrian\r\noracles)\"--here there was another long subdued whistle--\"and it is set\r\nforth on the face of every Egyptian temple as the ball, the wings of the\r\nspirit which rusheth into all worlds, and the serpent, which is the\r\n_Logos_.\"  Here the whistle became more sympathetic, for Egypt was the\r\nprofessor's great point in his lectures on architecture.  And having thus\r\nexplained the true grounds of the Trinity to the most learned theologian\r\nof the Presbyterian sect, I took my leave, quite unconscious that I had\r\nsaid anything out of the common, for all I meant was to give my reasons\r\nfor going back to the Episcopal Church.  As for Professor Dodd, he had\r\ngiven me up from the very first interview to follow my idols as I\r\npleased, only just throwing in argument enough to keep me well going.  He\r\nwould have been the last man on earth to throw down such a marvellous\r\nfairy castle, goblin-built and elfin-tenanted, from whose windows rang\r\nAEolian harps, and which was lit by night with undying Rosicrucian lamps,\r\nto erect on its ruin a plain brick, Old School Presbyterian slated\r\nchapel.  I was far more amusing as I was, and so I was let alone.\r\n\r\nI had passed my examination about the end of June, and I was to remain in\r\nPrinceton until the autumn, reading under a tutor, in the hope of being\r\nable to join the Sophomore class when the college course should begin.\r\nThere I was utterly alone, and rambled by myself in the woods.  I\r\nbelieved myself to be a very good Christian in those days; but I was\r\nreally as unaffected and sincere a Poly-Pantheist or Old Nature heathen\r\nas ever lived in Etrusco-Roman or early German days.  A book very dear to\r\nmy heart at that time was the _Curiositez Inouyes_ of Gaffarel (Trollope\r\nwas under the impression that he was the only man in Europe who ever read\r\nit), in which there is an exquisite theory that the stars of heaven in\r\ntheir courses and the lines of winding rivers and bending corn, the\r\ncurves of shells and minerals, rocks and trees, yes, of all the shapes of\r\nall created things, form the trace and letters of a stupendous _writing_\r\nor characters spread all over the universe, which writing becomes little\r\nby little legible to the one who by communion with Nature and earnest\r\nfaith seeks to penetrate the secret.  I had found in the lonely woods a\r\nsmall pond by a high rock, where I often sat in order to attain this\r\nblessed illumination, and if I did not get quite so far as I hoped, I did\r\nin reality attain to a deep unconscious familiarity with birds and leafy\r\nshades, still waters, and high rising trees; in short, with all the sweet\r\nsolemnity of sylvan nature, which has ever since influenced all my life.\r\nI mean this not in the second-hand way in which it is so generally\r\nunderstood, but as a _real_ existence in itself, so earnestly felt that I\r\nwas but little short of talking with elfin beings or seeing fairies\r\nflitting over flowers.  Those who explain everything by \"imagination\" do\r\nnot in the least understand how _actual_ the life in Nature may become to\r\nus.  Reflect for a minute, thou whose whole soul is in gossip and petty\r\nchronicles of fashion, and \"sassiety,\" that in that life thou _wert_ a\r\nmillion years ago, and in it thou wilt be a million years hence, ever\r\ngoing on in all forms, often enough in rivers, rock, and trees, and yet\r\ncanst not realise with a sense of awe that there are in these forms,\r\npassing to others--ever, ever on--myriads of men and women, or at least\r\ntheir _life_--_how_ we know not, as _what_ we know not--only this, that\r\nthe Will or creative force of the Creator or Creating is in it all.  This\r\nwas the serious yet unconscious inspiration of my young life in those\r\ndays, in even more elaborate or artistic form, which all went very well\r\nhand in hand with the Euclid and Homer or Demosthenes and Livy with which\r\nmy tutor Mr. Schenk (pronounce _Skank_) was coaching me.\r\n\r\nMy reading may seem to the reader to have been more limited than it was,\r\nbecause I have not mentioned the historians, essayists, or belletrists\r\nwhose works are read more or less by \"almost everybody.\"  It is hardly\r\nworth while to say, what must be of course surmised, that Sterne,\r\nAddison, Goldsmith, Johnson, Swift, and Macaulay--in fine, the leading\r\nEnglish classics--were really well read by me, my ambition being not to\r\nbe ignorant of anything which a literary man should know.  Macaulay was\r\nthen new, and I devoured not only his works, but a vast amount by him\r\nsuggested.  I realised at an early age that there was a certain cycle of\r\nknowledge common to all really cultivated minds, and this I was\r\ndetermined to master.  I had, however, little indeed of the vanity of\r\nerudition, having been deeply convinced and constantly depressed or\r\nshamed by the reflection that it was all worse than useless, and\r\ninjurious to making my way in life.  When I heard that Professor Dodd had\r\nsaid that at seventeen there were not ten men in America who had read so\r\nmuch, while Professor Joseph Henry often used words to this effect, and\r\nstern James Alexander in his lectures would make deeply learned allusions\r\nintended for me alone--as, for instance, to Kant's \"AEsthetik\"--I was\r\nanything but elated or vain in consequence.  I had read in _Sartor\r\nResartus_, \"If a man reads, shall he not be learned?\" and I knew too well\r\nthat reading was with me an unprofitable, perhaps pitiable, incurable\r\nmania-amusement, which might ruin me for life, and which, as it was, was\r\na daily source of apprehension between me and my good true friends, who\r\nfeared wisely for my future.\r\n\r\nI absolutely made James Alexander smile for once in his life--'twas\r\nsunshine on the grim Tarpeian rock.  I had bought me a nice English large\r\ntype Juvenal, and written on the outside in quaint Elizabethan character\r\nform--I forget now the name of the author--the following:--\r\n\r\n   \"Ay, Juvenall, thy jerking hande is good,\r\n   Not gently laying on, but bringing bloude.\r\n   Oh, suffer me amonge so manye men\r\n   To treade aright the traces of thy penne,\r\n   And light my lamp at thy eternal flame!\"\r\n\r\nWe students in the Latin class had left our books on a table, when I saw\r\ngrim and dour James Alexander pick up my copy, read the inscription, when\r\nlooking up at me he smiled; it was a kind of poetry which pleased him.\r\n\r\nI remember, too, how one day, when in Professor Dodd's class of\r\nmathematics, I, instead of attending to the lecture, read surreptitiously\r\nCardanus _de Subtilitate_ in an old vellum binding, and carelessly laid\r\nit on the table afterwards, where Professor Dodd found it, and directed\r\nat me one of his half-laughing Mephistophelian glances.  Reading of\r\nnovels in lectures was not unknown; but for Dodd to find anything so\r\ncaviare-like as Cardanus among our books was unusual.  George Boker\r\nremarked once, that while Professor Dodd was a Greek, Professor James\r\nAlexander was an old Roman, which was indeed a good summary of the two.\r\n\r\nI have and always had a bad memory, but I continued to retain what I read\r\nby repetition or reviewing and by _collocation_, which is a marvellous\r\naid in retaining images.  For, in the first place, I read entirely by\r\nGROUPS; and if I, for instance, attacked Blair's \"Rhetoric,\" Longinus and\r\nBurke Promptly followed; and if I perused \"Rambles in the Footsteps of\r\nDon Quixote,\" I at once, on principle, followed it up with \"Spain in\r\n1830,\" and a careful study of Ford's Guide-Book for Spain, and perhaps a\r\nscore of similar books, till I had got Spain well into me.  And as I have\r\nfound by years of observation and much research, having written a book on\r\nEducation partly based on this principle, ten books on any subject read\r\ntogether, profit more than a hundred at intervals.  And I may here add,\r\nthat if this record of what I read be dull, it is still that of my real\r\nyouthful life, giving the clue to my mind as it was formed.  Books in\r\nthose days were the only events of my life.\r\n\r\nLong before I went to college I had an attack of Irish antiquities, which\r\nI relieved by reading O'Brien, Vallancey, the more sensible Petrie, and\r\nO'Somebody's Irish grammar, aided by old Annie Mooney, who always\r\nremained by us.  In after years I discovered an Ogham inscription and the\r\nfamed Ogham tongue, or _Shelta_, \"the lost language of the bards,\"\r\naccording to Kuno Meyer and John Sampson.\r\n\r\nDuring my first half-year a college magazine was published, and I, a\r\nFreshman, was requested to contribute to the first number.  I sent in an\r\narticle on the history of English poetry.  Before I wrote it, the great\r\nman among the senior students asked leave to be allowed to write it with\r\nme.  I did not quite like the idea, but reflecting that the association\r\nwould give me a certain prestige, I accepted his aid.  So it appeared;\r\nbut it was regarded as mine.  Professor Dodd said something to me about\r\nthe inexpediency of so young a person appearing in print.  I could have\r\ntold him that I had already published several poems, &c., in\r\nPhiladelphian newspapers, but reflecting that it was not kind to have the\r\nbetter of him, I said nothing.  From that time I published something in\r\nevery number.  My second article was an essay on Spinoza, and I still\r\nthink it was rather good for a boy of sixteen.\r\n\r\nThere was the College and also a Society library, out of which I picked a\r\ngreat deal of good reading.  One day I asked Professor John MacLean, the\r\ncollege librarian, for the works of Condorcet.  His reply was, \"Vile\r\nbook! vile book! can't have it.\"  However, I found in the Society library\r\nUrquhart's translation of \"Rabelais,\" which I read, I daresay, as often\r\nas any mortal ever did.  And here I have a word to say to the wretched\r\nidiots who regard \"the book called Rabelais\" as \"immoral\" and unfit for\r\nyouth.  Many times did I try to induce my young friends to read\r\n\"Rabelais,\" and some actually mastered the story of the goose as a\r\n_torche-cul_, and perhaps two or three chapters more; but as for reading\r\nthrough or enjoying it, \"that was not in their minds.\"  All complained,\r\nor at least showed, that they \"did not understand it.\"  It was to them an\r\naggravating farrago of filth and oddity, under which they suspected some\r\nformal allegory or meaning which had perished, or was impenetrable.  Learn\r\nthis, ye prigs of morality, that no work of genius ever yet demoralised a\r\ndolt or ignoramus.  Even the Old Testament, with all its stores of the\r\n\"shocking,\" really does very little harm.  It requires _mind for mind_ in\r\nreading, and vice becomes unattractive even to the vicious when they\r\ncannot understand it.  I did understand Rabelais, and the _Moyen de\r\nParvenir_, and the _Cymbalum Mundi_, and Boccaccio (I owned these books),\r\nand laughed over them, yet was withal as pure-minded a youth as could\r\nwell be imagined without being a simpleton.  For, with all such reading,\r\nI best loved such a book as Bromley's \"Sabbath of Rest,\" or sweet,\r\nstrange works of ancient Mysticism, which bore the soul away to the stars\r\nor into Nature.  Such a combination is perfectly possible when there is\r\nno stain of dishonesty or vulgarity in the character, and I had escaped\r\nsuch influences easily enough.\r\n\r\nA droll event took place in the spring.  It had been usual once a year--I\r\nforgot on what occasion--to give to all the classes a holiday.  This year\r\nit was abolished, and the Sophomore, junior, and senior classes quietly\r\nacquiesced.  But we, the Freshmen, albeit we had never been there before,\r\nrebelled at such infringement of \"our rights,\" and absented ourselves\r\nfrom recitation.  I confess that I was a leader in the movement, because\r\nI sincerely believed it to be a sin to \"remove old landmarks,\" and that\r\nthe students required more rest and holidays than were allowed them; in\r\nwhich I was absolutely in the right, for our whole life, except Saturday\r\nafternoons, was \"one demnition grind.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling which was excited by this \"Freshman's rebellion\" was one of\r\nutter amazement, or awful astonishment tempered with laughter, not\r\nunmingled with respect.  It was the terrier flying at the lion, when the\r\ngreat mastiff, and bloodhound, and Danish dog had quietly slunk aside.\r\nThere were in the class beside myself several youths of marked character,\r\nand collectively we had already made an impression, to which my intimacy\r\nwith George Boker, and Professor Dodd, and the very _elite_ of the\r\nseniors, added not a little force.  We were _mysterious_.  Hitherto a\r\nFreshman had been the greenest of the green, a creature created for\r\nridicule, a sort of \"leathery fox\" or mere tyro (_ty_--not a\r\nty-pographical error--_pace_ my kind and courteous reviewer in the\r\n_Saturday_)--and here were Freshmen of a new kind rising in dignity above\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me of a merry tale.  It was usual for Freshmen to learn to\r\nsmoke for the first time after coming to college, and for more advanced\r\nstudents to go to their rooms, or find them in others, and smoke them\r\nsick or into retreating.  I, however, found a source of joy in this, that\r\nI could now sit almost from morning till night, and very often on to\r\nthree in the morning, smoking all the time, being deeply learned in\r\nVarinas, Kanaster, and the like; for I smoked nothing but real Holland\r\ntobacco, while I could buy it.  A party of Sophomores informed George\r\nBoker that they intended to smoke me out.  \"Smoke _him_ out!\" quoth\r\nGeorge; \"why, he'd smoke the whole of you dumb and blind.\"  However, it\r\ncame to pass that one evening several of them tried it on; and verily\r\nthey might as well have tried it on to Niklas Henkerwyssel, who, as the\r\nlegend goes, sold his soul to the devil for the ability to smoke all the\r\ntime, to whom my father had once compared me.  So the cigars and tobacco\r\nwere burned, and I liked it extremely.  Denser grew the smoke, and the\r\nwindows were closed, to which I cheerfully assented, for I liked to have\r\nit thick; and still more smoke and more, and the young gentlemen who had\r\ncome to smother me grew pale, even as the Porcupines grew pale when they\r\ntried to burn out the great Indian sorcerer, who burned _them_!  But I,\r\nwho was beginning to enjoy myself amazingly in such congenial society,\r\nonly filled Boker's great meerschaum with Latakia, and puffed away.  One\r\nby one the visitors also \"puffed away,\" _i.e._, vanished through the door\r\ninto the night.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I open the window?\" asked George.\r\n\r\n\"Not on my account,\" I replied.  \"I rather enjoy it as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I begin to believe,\" replied my friend, \"that you would like it in\r\nDante's hell of clouds.  Do you know what those men came here for?  It\r\nwas _to smoke you out_.  And you smoked them out, and never knew it.\"\r\nWhich was perfectly true.  As for smoking, my only trouble was to be able\r\nto buy cigars and tobacco.  These were incredibly cheap in those days,\r\nand I always dressed very respectably, but my smoking always cost me more\r\nthan my clothing.\r\n\r\nWhen we Freshmen had rebelled, we were punished by being rusticated or\r\nsent into the country to board.  I went to Professor Dodd to receive my\r\nsentence, and in a grave voice, in which was a faint ring as of irony,\r\nand with the lurking devil which always played in his great marvellous\r\nmysterious black eyes, he said, \"If you were any other student, I would\r\nnot send you to the city, and so reward your rebellion with a holiday.\r\nBut as I know perfectly well that you will go into the Philadelphia\r\nLibrary, and never stop reading till it is time to return, I will send\r\nyou there.\"\r\n\r\nMy parents were then absent with my younger sisters in New England, but I\r\nhad unlimited credit at Congress Hall Hotel, which was kept by a Mr. John\r\nSturdevant, and where I was greatly respected as the son of the owner of\r\nthe property.  So I went there, and fared well, and, as Professor Dodd\r\nprophesied, read all the time.  One night I went into an auction of\r\ndelightful old books.  My money had run low; there only remained to me\r\none dollar and a half.\r\n\r\nNow, of all books on earth, what I most yearned for in those days were\r\nthe works of Jacob Behmen.  And the auctioneer put up a copy containing\r\n\"The Aurora or Morning Rednesse,\" English version (_circa_ 1636), and I\r\nbid.  One dollar--one dollar ten cents--twenty--twenty-five; my heart\r\npalpitated, and I half fainted for fear lest I should be outbid, when at\r\nthe very last I got it with my last penny.\r\n\r\nThe black eyes of Professor Dodd twinkled more elfishly than ever when I\r\nexhibited to him my glorious treasure.  He evidently thought that my\r\nexile had been to me anything but a punishment, and he was right.  For a\r\ncopy of _Anthroposophos Theomagicus_ or the works of Robert Fludd I would\r\nhave got up another rebellion.\r\n\r\nIt was quite against the college regulations for students to live in the\r\ntown, but as I never touched a card, was totally abstemious and \"moral,\"\r\nand moreover in rather delicate health, I was passed over as an odd\r\nexception.  Once or twice it was proposed to bring me in, but Professor\r\nDodd interfered and saved me.  While in Princeton for more than four\r\nyears, I never once touched a drop of anything stronger than coffee,\r\nwhich was a great pity!  Exercise was not in those days encouraged in any\r\nway whatever--in fact, playing billiards and ten-pins was liable to be\r\npunished by expulsion; there was no gymnasium, no boating, and all\r\nphysical games and manly exercises were sternly discouraged as leading to\r\nsin.  Now, if I had drunk a pint of bitter ale every day, and played\r\ncricket or \"gymnased,\" or rowed for two hours, it would have saved me\r\nmuch suffering, and to a great degree have relieved me from reading,\r\nromancing, reflecting, and smoking, all of which I carried to great\r\nexcess, having an inborn impulse to be always doing something.  That I\r\ndid not grapple with life as a real thing, or with prosaic college\r\nstudies or society, was, I can now see, a _disease_, for which, as my\r\npeculiar tastes had come upon me from nervous and Unitarian and Alcottian\r\nevil influences, I was not altogether responsible.  I was a precocious\r\nboy, and I had fully developed extraordinary influences, which, like the\r\nseed of Scripture, had in my case fallen on more than fertile ground; it\r\nwas like the soil of the Margariten Island, by Budapest, which is so\r\npermeated by hot springs in a rich soil that everything comes to maturity\r\nthere in one-third of the time which it does elsewhere.  I was the last\r\nchild on earth who should ever have fallen into Alcott's hands, or\r\nlistened to Dr. Channing or Furness, or have been interested in anything\r\n\"ideal\"; but fate willed that I should drink the elfin goblet to the\r\ndregs.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Boker had a great influence on me.  We were in a way connected,\r\nfor my uncle Amos had married his aunt, and my cousin, Benjamin Godfrey,\r\nhis cousin.  He was exactly six feet high, with the form of an Apollo,\r\nand a head which was the very counterpart of the bust of Byron.  A few\r\nyears later N. P. Willis described him in the _Home Journal_ as the\r\nhandsomest man in America.  He had been from boyhood as precociously a\r\nman of the world as I was the opposite.  He was _par eminence_ the poet\r\nof our college, and in a quiet, gentlemanly way its \"swell.\"  I passed a\r\ngreat deal of my time in his rooms reading Wordsworth, Shelley, and\r\nByron, the last named being his ideal.  He ridiculed the Lakers, whom I\r\nloved; and when Southey's last poem, \"On Gooseberry Pie,\" appeared, he\r\ndeclared that the poor old man was in his dotage, to which I assented\r\nwith sorrow in my heart.  Though only one year older than I, yet, as a\r\n_Junior_, and from his superior knowledge of life, I regarded him as\r\nbeing about thirty.  He was quite familiar, in a refined and gentlemanly\r\nway, with all the dissipation of Philadelphia and New York; nor was the\r\nsmall circle of his friends, with whom I habitually associated, much\r\nbehind him in this respect.  Even during this Junior year he was offered\r\nthe post of secretary to our Ambassador at Vienna.  From him and the\r\nothers I acquired a second-hand knowledge of life, which was sufficient\r\nto keep me from being regarded as a duffer or utterly \"green,\" though in\r\nall such \"life\" I was practically as innocent as a young nun.  Now,\r\nwhatever I heard, as well as read, I always turned over and over in my\r\nmind, thoroughly digesting it to a most exceptional degree.  So that I\r\nwas somewhat like the young lady of whom I heard in Vienna in after\r\nyears.  She was brought up in the utmost moral and strict seclusion, but\r\nshe found in her room an aperture through which she could witness all\r\nthat took place in the neighbouring room of a _maison de passe_; but\r\nbeing a great philosopher, she in time regarded it all as the \"butterfly\r\npassing show\" of a theatre, the mere idle play of foolish mortal\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nEven before I began my Freshman year there came into my life a slight but\r\nnew and valuable influence.  Professor Dodd, when I arrived, had just\r\nbegun his course of lectures on architecture.  To my great astonishment,\r\nbut not at all to that of George Boker, I was invited to attend the\r\ncourse, Boker remarking dryly that he had no doubt that Dodd thanked God\r\nfor having at last got an auditor who would appreciate him.  Which I\r\ncertainly did.  I in after years listened to the great Thiersch, who\r\ntrained Heine to art, and of whom I was a special _protege_, and many\r\ngreat teachers, but I never listened to any one like Albert Dodd.  It was\r\nnot with him the mere description of styles and dates; it was a deep and\r\ntruly aesthetic feeling that every phase of architecture mirrors and\r\nreciprocally forms its age, and breathes its life and poetry and\r\nreligion, which characterised all that he said.  It was in nothing like\r\nthe subjective rhapsodies of Ruskin, which bloomed out eight years later,\r\nbut rather in the spirit of Vischer and Taine, which J. A. Symonds has so\r\nbeautifully and clearly set forth in his Essays {98}--that is, the spirit\r\nof historical development.  Here my German philosophy enabled me to grasp\r\na subtle and delicate spirit of beauty, which passed, I fear, over the\r\nheads of the rest of the youthful audience.  His ideas of the\r\ncorrespondence of Egyptian architecture to the stupendous massiveness of\r\nPantheism and the appalling grandeur of its ideas, were clear enough to\r\nme, who had copied Hermes Trismegistus and read with deepest feeling the\r\nOrphic and Chaldean oracles.  The ideas had not only been long familiar\r\nto me, but formed my very life and the subject of the most passionate\r\nstudy.  To hear them clearly expressed with rare beauty, in the deep,\r\nstrange voice of the professor, was joy beyond belief.  And as it would\r\nnot be in human nature for a lecturer not to note an admiring auditor, it\r\nhappened often enough that something was often introduced for my special\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\nFor I may here note--and it was a very natural thing--that just as Gypsy\r\nmusicians always select in the audience some one who seems to be most\r\nappreciative, at whom they play (they call it _de o kan_), so Professors\r\nDodd and James Alexander afterwards, in their aesthetic, or more erudite\r\ndisquisitions, rarely failed to fiddle at me--Dodd looking right in my\r\neyes, and Alexander at the ceiling, ending, however, with a very brief\r\nglance, as if for conscience' sake.  I feel proud of this, and it affects\r\nme more now than it did then, when it produced no effect of vanity, and\r\nseemed to me to be perfectly natural.\r\n\r\nI heard certain mutterings and hoots among the students as I went out of\r\nthe lecture-room, but did not know what it meant.  George Boker informed\r\nme afterwards that there had been great indignation expressed that \"a\r\ngreen ignorant Freshman\" had dared to intrude, as I had done, among his\r\nintellectual superiors and betters, but that he had at once explained\r\nthat I was a great friend of Professor Dodd, and a kind of marvellous\r\n_rara avis_, not to be classed with common little Freshmen; so that in\r\nfuture I was allowed to go my way in peace.\r\n\r\nA man of culture who had known Coleridge well, declared that as a\r\nconversationalist on varied topics Professor Albert Dodd was his\r\nsuperior.  When in the pulpit, or in the lengthened \"addresses\" of\r\nlecturing, there was a marvellous fascination in his voice--an Italian\r\nwitch, or red Indian, or a gypsy would have at once recognised in him a\r\nsorcerer.  Yet his manner was subdued, his voice monotonous, never loud,\r\na running stream without babbling stones or rapids; but when it came to a\r\nclimax cataract he cleared it with grandeur, leaving a stupendous\r\nimpression.  In the ordinary monotony of that deep voice there was soon\r\nfelt an indescribable charm.  In saying this I only repeat what I have\r\nheard in more or less different phrase from others.  There was always in\r\nhis eyes (and in this as in other points he resembled Emerson) a strange\r\nindefinable suspicion of a smile, though he, like the Sage of Concord,\r\nrarely laughed.  Owing to these black eyes, and his sallow complexion,\r\nhis sobriquet among the students was \"the royal Bengal tiger.\"  He was\r\nnot unlike Emerson as a lecturer.  I heard the latter deliver his great\r\ncourse of lectures in London in 1848--including the famous one on\r\nNapoleon--but he had not to the same perfection the music of the voice,\r\nnor the indefinable mysterious charm which characterised the style of\r\nProfessor Dodd, who played with emotion as if while feeling he was ever\r\nsuperior to it.  He was a great actor, who had gone far beyond acting or\r\nart.\r\n\r\nOwing, I suppose, to business losses, my father and family lived for two\r\nyears either at Congress Hall Hotel or _en pension_.  I spent my first\r\nvacation at the former place.  There lived in the house a Colonel John Du\r\nSolle, the editor of a newspaper.  He was a good-natured, rather\r\ndissipated man, who kept horses and had a fancy for me, and took me out\r\n\"on drives,\" and once introduced me in the street to a great actress,\r\nSusan Cushman, {101} and very often to theatres and coffee-houses and\r\nreporters, and printed several of my lucubrations.  Du Solle was in after\r\nyears secretary to P. T. Barnum, whom I also knew well.  He was kind to\r\nme, and I owe him this friendly mention.  Some people thought him a\r\nrather dangerous companion for youth, but I was never taken by him into\r\nbad company or places, nor did I ever hear from him a word of which my\r\nparents would have disapproved.  But I really believe that I could at\r\nthat time, or any other, have kept company with the devil and not been\r\nmuch harmed: it was not in me.  Edgar A. Poe was often in Du Solle's\r\noffice and at Congress Hall.\r\n\r\nIn the summer we all went to Stonington, Connecticut, where we lived at a\r\nhotel called the Wadawanuc House.  There I went out sailing--once on a\r\nclam-bake excursion in a yacht owned by Captain Nat. Palmer, who had\r\ndiscovered Palmer's Land--and sailed far and wide.  That summer I also\r\nsaw on his own deck the original old Vanderbilt himself, who was then the\r\ncaptain of a Sound steamboat; and I bathed every day in salt-water, and\r\nfished from the wharf, and smoked a great deal, and read French books;\r\nand after a while we went into Massachusetts and visited the dear old\r\nvillages and Boston, and so on, till I had to return to Princeton.  Soon\r\nafter my father took another house in Walnut Street, the next door above\r\nthe one where we had lived.  This one was rather better, for though it\r\nhad less garden, it had larger back-buildings.\r\n\r\n_Bon an_, _mal an_, the time passed away at Princeton for four years.  I\r\nwas often very ill.  In the last year the physician who tested my lungs\r\ndeclared they were unsound in two places; and about this time I was\r\nbelieved to have contracted an incurable stoop in the shoulders.  One day\r\nI resolved that from _that minute_ I would always hold myself straight\r\nupright; and I did so, and in the course of time became as straight as an\r\narrow, and have continued so, I believe, ever since.\r\n\r\nI discovered vast treasures of strange reading in the library of the\r\nPrinceton Theological College.  There was in one corner in a waste-room\r\nat least two cart-loads of old books in a cobwebbed dusty pile.  Out of\r\nthat pile I raked the _thirteenth_ known copy of Blind Harry's famed\r\npoem, a black-letter Euphues Lely, an _Erra Pater_ (a very weak-minded\r\nfriend _actually shamed_ me out of making a copy of this great curiosity,\r\ntelling me it was silly and childish of me to be so pleased with old\r\ntrash), and many more marvels, which were so little esteemed in\r\nPrinceton, that one of the professors, seeing me daft with delight over\r\nmy finds, told me I was quite welcome to keep them all; but I, who better\r\nknew their _great_ value, would not avail myself of the offer, reflecting\r\nthat a time would come when these treasures would be properly valued.  God\r\nknows it was a _terrible_ temptation to me, and such as I hope I may\r\nnever have again--_ne inducas nos in temptationem_!\r\n\r\nThe time for my graduation was at hand.  I had profited very much in the\r\nlast year by the teaching and friendly counsel of Professor Joseph Henry,\r\nwhose lectures on philosophy I diligently attended; also those on\r\ngeology, chemistry and botany by Professor Torrey, and by the company of\r\nProfessor Topping.  I stood very high in Latin, and perhaps first in\r\nEnglish branches.  Yet, because I had fallen utterly short in\r\nmathematics, I was rated the lowest but one in the class--or, honestly\r\nspeaking, the very last, for the one below me was an utterly reckless\r\nyouth, who could hardly be said to have studied or graduated at all.\r\nThere were two honours usually awarded for proficiency in study.  One was\r\nthe First Honour, and he who received it delivered the Valedictory\r\nOration; the second was the Poem; and by an excess of kindness and\r\njustice for which I can never feel too grateful, and which was really an\r\nextraordinary stretch of their power under the circumstances, the Poem\r\nwas awarded to me!\r\n\r\nI was overwhelmed at the honour, but bitterly mortified and cut to my\r\nheart to think how little I had deserved it; for I had never done a thing\r\nsave read and study that which pleased me and was _easy_.  I wrote the\r\npoem (and I still think it was a good one, for I put all my soul into\r\nit), and sent it in to the Faculty, with a letter stating that I was\r\ndeeply grateful for their extreme kindness, but that, feeling I had not\r\ndeserved it, I must decline the honour.  But I sent them my MS. as a\r\nproof that I did not do so because I felt myself incapable, and because I\r\nwished to give them some evidence that they had not erred in regarding me\r\nas a poet.\r\n\r\nVery foolish and boyish, the reader may say, and yet I never regretted\r\nit.  The Faculty were not to blame for the system pursued, and they did\r\ntheir utmost in every way for four years to make it easy and happy for\r\none of the laziest and most objectionable students whom they had ever\r\nhad.  I have never been really able to decide whether I was right or\r\nwrong.  At liberal Cambridge, Massachusetts, neither I nor the professors\r\nwould ever have discovered a flaw in my industry.  At the closely\r\ncramped, orthodox, hide-bound, mathematical Princeton, every weakness in\r\nme seemed to be developed.  Thirty years later I read in the _Nassau\r\nMonthly_, which I had once edited, that if Boker and I and a few others\r\nhad become known in literature, we had done so _in spite of_ our\r\neducation there.  I do not know who wrote it; whoever he was, I am much\r\nobliged to him for a very comforting word.  For, discipline apart, it was\r\nliterally \"in spite of our education\" that we learned anything worth\r\nknowing at Princeton--as it then was.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nFrom this point a new phase of life begins.  Prominent in it and as its\r\nmoving power was the great kindness of my father.  That I had graduated\r\nat all under any conditions was gratifying, and so was the fact that it\r\nwas not in reality without the so-called Second Honour, despite my low\r\ngrade.  And the pitiable condition of my health was considered.  During\r\nthe last year I had taken lessons in dancing and fencing, which helped me\r\na little, and I looked as if I might become strong with a change of life.\r\nSo my father took my mother and me on a grand excursion.  We went to\r\nStonington, New York, and Saratoga, where I attended a ball--my first--and\r\nthen on to Niagara.  On the way we stopped at Auburn, where there was a\r\ngreat State-prison, which I visited alone.  There was among its\r\nattractions a noted murderer under sentence of death.  There were two or\r\nthree ladies and gentlemen who were shown by the warder with me over the\r\nbuilding.  He expressed some apprehension as to showing us the murderer,\r\nfor he was a very desperate character.  We entered a large room, and I\r\nsaw a really gentlemanly-looking man heavily ironed, who was reading a\r\nnewspaper.  While the others conversed with him, I endeavoured to make\r\nunobserved a sketch of his face.  The warder noticing this, called me to\r\nthe front to make it boldly, and the prisoner, smiling, told me to go on\r\nwith it; which I did, and that not so badly--at least, the sitter\r\napproved of it.\r\n\r\nSo we went up the beautiful Hudson, which far surpasses the Rhine, and\r\nyields the palm only to the Danube, stopping at Poughkeepsie and Albany,\r\nand so on to Niagara Falls.  On the way we passed through a burning\r\nforest.  My awe at this wonderful sight amused some one present to whom\r\nit was a familiar thing.  Which reminds me that about the time when I\r\nfirst went to college, but while staying at Congress Hall, I there met a\r\nyouth from Alabama or Mississippi, who was on his way to Princeton to\r\njoin our ranks.  To him I of course showed every attention, and by way of\r\npromoting his happiness took him to the top of the belfry of the State\r\nHouse, whence there is a fine view.  While there I casually remarked what\r\na number of ships there were in the river, whereupon he eagerly cried,\r\n\"Oh, show me one!  I never saw a ship in all my life!\"  I gazed at him in\r\nutter astonishment, as if I would say, \"What manner of man art thou?\" and\r\nthen recalling myself, said, \"Well, we are just equal, for you never saw\r\na ship, and I never saw a _cotton-field_.\"  The young man smiled\r\nincredulously, and replied, \"Now I know that you are trying to humbug me,\r\nfor how _could_ you grow up without ever seeing cotton-fields?\"\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Niagara about noon, and I at once went to see the Falls.\r\nThere was a very respectable-looking old gentleman, evidently from the\r\nfar South, with two young ladies, one a great beauty, advancing just\r\nbefore.  I heard him say, \"Now, keep your eyes closed, or look down till\r\nyou can have a full view.\"  I did the same, and when he cried \"Look up!\"\r\ndid so.  It was one of the great instants of my life.\r\n\r\nI know not how it was, but that first glance suggested to me something\r\n_chivalric_.  It may have been from Byron's simile of the tail of the\r\nwhite horse and the cataract, and the snow-white steed of that\r\nincarnation of nobility, Crescentius, and there rang in my memory a\r\nmystical verse--\r\n\r\n   \"My eye bears a glance like the gleam of a lance\r\n      When I hear the waters dash and dance;\r\n   And I smile with glee, for I love to see\r\n      The sight of anything that's free!\"\r\n\r\nBut it was a mingled sense of nobility, and above all of _freedom_, which\r\nimpressed me in that roaring mist of waters, in the wild river leaping as\r\nin reckless sport over the vast broad precipice.  It is usual, especially\r\nfor those who have no gift of description, to say that Niagara is\r\n\"utterly indescribable,\" and the Visitors' Book has this opinion repeated\r\nby the American Philistine on every page.  But that is because those who\r\nsay so have no proper comprehension of facts stated, no poetic faculty,\r\nand no imagination.  Of course no mere description, however perfect,\r\nwould give the same conception of even a pen or a button as would the\r\n_sight_ thereof; but it is absurd and illogical to speak as if this were\r\n_peculiar_ to a great thing alone.  For my part, I believe that the mere\r\ndescription to a _poet_, or to one who has dwelt by wood and wold and\r\nsteeped his soul in Nature, of a tremendous cataract a mile in breadth\r\nand two hundred feet high, cleft by a wooded island, and rushing onward\r\nbelow in awful rocky rapids with a mighty roar, would, could, or should\r\nconvey a very good idea of the great sight.  For I found in after years,\r\nwhen I came to see Venice and the temples on the Nile, that they were\r\npicturesquely or practically precisely what I had expected to see, not\r\none shade or _nuance_ of an expression more or less.  As regards Rome and\r\nall Gothic cathedrals, I had been assured so often, or so generally, by\r\nall \"intelligent tourists,\" that they were all wretched rubbish, that I\r\nwas amazed to find them so beautiful.  And so much as to anticipations of\r\nNiagara, which I have thrice visited, and the constant assertion by cads\r\nunutterable that it is \"indescribable.\"\r\n\r\nWhile at Niagara for three days, I walked about a great deal with a young\r\nlady whose acquaintance we had made at the hotel.  As she was, I verily\r\nbelieve, the very first, not a relative, with whom I had ever taken a\r\nwalk, or, I may almost say, formed an acquaintance, it constituted an\r\nevent in my life equal to Niagara itself in importance.  I was at this\r\ntime just twenty-one, and certain I am that among twenty-one thousand\r\ncollege graduates of my age in America, of the same condition of life,\r\nthere was not another so inexperienced in worldly ways, or so far behind\r\nhis age, or so \"docile unto discipline.\"  I was, in fact, morally where\r\nmost boys in the United States are at twelve or thirteen; which is a very\r\ngreat mistake where there is a fixed determination that the youth shall\r\nmake his own way in life.  We cannot have boys good little angels at home\r\nand devils in business abroad.--_Horum utrum magis velim_, _mihi incertum\r\nest_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  UNIVERSITY LIFE AND TRAVEL IN EUROPE.  1845-1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassage in a sailing ship--Gibraltar--Marseilles--Smugglers and a\r\nslaver--Italy--Life in Rome--Torlonia's balls and the last great Carnival\r\nof 1846--Navone, the chief of police--Florence--Venice--How I passed the\r\nBridge of Sighs--The Black Bait--Slavery--Crossing the\r\nSimplon--Switzerland--Pleasing introduction to Germany--Student life at\r\nHeidelberg--Captain Medwin--Justinus Kerner--How I saw Jenny\r\nLind--Munich--Lola Montez--Our house on fire--All over Germany--How I was\r\nturned out of Poland--Paris in 1847--The Revolution of 1848--I become\r\nconspirator and captain of barricades--Taking of the Tuileries--The\r\npolice bow me out of Prance--A season in London--Return to America.\r\n\r\nAfter our return to Philadelphia something of great importance to me\r\nbegan to be discussed.  My cousin Samuel Godfrey, who was a few years\r\nolder than I, finding himself threatened with consumption, of which all\r\nhis family died, resolved to go to Marseilles on a voyage, and persuaded\r\nmy father to let me accompany him.  At this time I had, as indeed for\r\nmany years before, such a desire to visit Europe that I might almost have\r\ndied of it.  So it was at last determined that I should go with \"Sam,\"\r\nand after all due preparations and packing, I bade farewell to mother and\r\nHenry and the dear little twin sisters, and youngest Emily, our pet, and\r\nwent with my father to New York, where I was the guest for a few days of\r\nmy cousin, Mrs. Caroline Wight, whom the reader may recall as the one who\r\nused to correct my French exercises in Dedham.\r\n\r\nWe were to sail in a packet or ship for Marseilles.  My father saw me\r\noff.  He was wont to say in after years, that as I stood on the deck at\r\nthe last moment and looked affectionately at him, there was in my eyes an\r\nexpression of innocence or goodness and gentleness which he never saw\r\nagain.  Which was, I am sure, very true; the great pity being that that\r\nlook had not utterly disappeared years before.  If it only _had_ vanished\r\nwith boyhood, as it ought to have done, my father would have been spared\r\nmuch sorrow.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was a trifle over six feet two in height, and had then and\r\nfor some time after so fair a red and white complexion, that the young\r\nladies in Philadelphia four years later teased me by spreading the report\r\nthat I used rouge and white paint!  I was not as yet \"filled out,\" but\r\nheld myself straightly, and was fairly proportioned.  I wore a cap _a\r\nl'etudiant_, very much over my left ear, and had very long, soft,\r\nstraight, dark-brown hair; my dream and ideal being the German student.  I\r\nwas extremely shy of strangers, but when once acquainted soon became very\r\nfriendly, and in most cases made a favourable impression.  I was \"neat\r\nand very clean-looking,\" as a lady described me, for the daily bath or\r\nsponge was universal in Philadelphia long ere it was even in England, and\r\nmany a time when travelling soon after, I went without a meal in order to\r\nhave my tub, when time did not permit of both.  I was very sensitive, and\r\nmy feelings were far too easily pained; on the other hand, I had no trace\r\nof the common New England youth's vulgar failing of nagging, teasing, or\r\nvexing others under colour of being \"funny\" or \"cute.\"  A very striking,\r\nand, all things considered, a remarkable characteristic was that I\r\n_hated_, as I still do, with all my soul, gossip about other people and\r\ntheir affairs; never read even a card not meant for my eyes, and detested\r\ncuriosity, prying, and inquisitiveness as I did the devil.  I owe a great\r\ndevelopment of this to a curious incident.  It must have been about the\r\ntime when I first went to college, that I met at Cape May a naval\r\nofficer, who roomed with me in a cottage, a farm-house near a hotel, and\r\nwhom I greatly admired as a man of the world and a model of good manners.\r\nTo him one day I communicated some gossip about somebody, when he\r\nabruptly cut me short, and when I would go on informed me that he never\r\nlistened to such talk.  This made a very deep impression on me, which\r\nnever disappeared; nay, it grew with my growth and strengthened with my\r\nstrength.  Now the New England people, especially Bostonians, are\r\ninordinately given to knowing everything about everybody, and to \"tittle-\r\ntattle,\" while the Southerners are comparatively free from it and very\r\nincurious.  Two-thirds of the students at Princeton were of the first\r\nfamilies in the South, and there my indifference to what did not\r\npersonally concern one was regarded as a virtue.  But there is a spot in\r\nthis sun--that he who never cares a straw to know about the affairs of\r\nother people, will, not only if he live in Boston, but almost anywhere\r\nelse--Old England not at all excepted--be forced, in spite of himself,\r\nand though he were as meek and lowly as man may be, into looking down on\r\nand feeling himself superior unto those people who _will_ read a letter\r\nnot meant for their eyes, or eavesdrop, or talk in any way about anybody\r\nin a strain to which they would not have that person listen.  Which\r\nreminds me that in after years I got some praise in the newspapers for\r\nthe saying that a Yankee's idea of hell was a place where he must mind\r\nhis own business.  It came about in this way.  In a letter to Charles\r\nAstor Bristed I made this remark, and illustrated it with a picture of\r\nVirgil taking a Yankee attired in a chimney-pot hat and long night-gown\r\ninto the Inferno, over whose gate was written--\r\n\r\n   \"Badate a vostri affari voi che intrate!\"\r\n   (Mind your own business ye who enter here!)\r\n\r\nOne day soon after my arrival at Princeton, George Boker laid on the\r\ntable by me a paper or picture with its face down.  I took no notice of\r\nit.  After a time he said, \"Why don't you look at that picture?\"  I\r\nreplied simply, \"If you wanted me to see it you would have turned it face\r\nup.\"  To which he remarked, \"I put it there to see whether you would look\r\nat it.  I thought you would not.\"  George was a \"deep, sagacious file,\"\r\nwho studied men like books.\r\n\r\nMy cousin who accompanied me had as a boy \"run away and gone to sea\" cod-\r\nfishing on the Grand Banks.  If I had gone with him it would have done me\r\ngood.  Another cousin, Benjamin Stimson, did the same; he is the S. often\r\nmentioned in Dana's \"Two Years Before the Mast.\"  Dana and Stimson were\r\nfriends, and ran away together.  It was quite the rule for all my Yankee\r\ncousins to do this, and they all benefited by it.  In consequence of his\r\nnautical experience Sam was soon at home among all sailors, and not\r\nhaving my scruples as to knowing who was who or their affairs, soon knew\r\neverything that was going on.  Our captain was a handsome, dissipated,\r\nand \"loud\" young man, with rather more sail than ballast, but\r\ngood-natured and obliging.\r\n\r\n\"Come day, go day,\" we passed the Gulf Stream and the Azores, and had\r\nlong sunny calms, when we could not sail, and lay about on deck, warm and\r\nlazy, and saw the Azores, and so on, till we were near the Spanish coast.\r\nOne evening there clipped right under our lee a fisherman's smack.  \"I\r\nsay, Leland, hail that fellow!\" said the captain.  So I called in\r\nSpanish, \"Adonde venga usted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Da Algesiras,\" was the reply, which thrilled out of my heart the thought\r\nthat, like the squire in Chaucer--\r\n\r\n   \"He had been at the siege of Algecir.\"\r\n\r\nSo I called, in parting, \"Dios vaya con usted!\"\r\n\r\nSam informed me that the manner in which I hailed the fisherman had made\r\na great impression on the captain, who lauded me highly.  It also made\r\none on me, because it was the first time I ever spoke to a European _in\r\nEurope_!\r\n\r\nAnon we were boarded by an old weather-beaten seadog of a Spanish pilot,\r\nunto whom I felt a great attraction; and greeting him in Malagan Spanish,\r\nsuch as I had learned from Manuel Gori, as _Hermano_! and offering him\r\nwith ceremonious politeness a good cigar, I also drew his regards; all\r\nSpaniards, as I well knew, being extremely fond, beyond all men on earth,\r\nof intimacy with gentlemen.  We were delayed for two days at Gibraltar.  I\r\nmay here remark, by the way, that this voyage of our ship is described in\r\na book by Mrs. Fanny Kemble Butler, entitled \"A Year of Consolation\r\nAbroad.\"  She was on board, but never spoke to a soul among the\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nI was never acquainted with Mrs. Butler, as I easily might have been, for\r\nwe had some very intimate friends in common; but as a boy I had been\r\n\"frightened of her\" by certain anecdotes as to her temper, and perhaps\r\nthe influence lasted into later years.  I have, however, heard her\r\nlecture.  She was a very clever woman, and Mr. Henry James, in _Temple\r\nBar_ for March, 1893, thus does justice to her conversational power:\r\n\r\n   \"Her talk reflected a thousand vanished and present things; but there\r\n   were those of her friends for whom its value was, almost before any\r\n   other, documentary.  The generations move so fast and change so much,\r\n   that Mrs. Kemble testified even more than she affected to do, which\r\n   was much, to ancient manners and a close chapter of history.  Her\r\n   conversation swarmed with people and with criticism of people, with\r\n   the ghosts of a dead society.  She had, in two hemispheres, seen every\r\n   one and known every one, had assisted at the social comedy of her age.\r\n   Her own habits and traditions were in themselves a survival of an era\r\n   less democratic and more mannered.  I have no room for enumerations,\r\n   which, moreover, would be invidious; but the old London of her\r\n   talk--the direction I liked is best to take--was, in particular, a\r\n   gallery of portraits.  She made Count d'Orsay familiar, she made\r\n   Charles Greville present; I thought it wonderful that she could be\r\n   anecdotic about Miss Edgeworth.  She reanimated the old drawing-rooms,\r\n   relighted the old lamps, retuned the old pianos.  The finest comedy of\r\n   all, perhaps, was that of her own generous whimsicalities.  She was\r\n   superbly willing to amuse, and on any terms; and her temper could do\r\n   it as well as her wit.  If either of these had failed, her\r\n   eccentricities were always there.  She had more 'habits' than most\r\n   people have room in life for, and a theory that to a person of her\r\n   disposition they were as necessary as the close meshes of a strait-\r\n   waistcoat.  If she had not lived by rule (on her showing) she would\r\n   have lived infallibly by riot.  Her rules and her riots, her\r\n   reservations and her concessions, all her luxuriant theory and all her\r\n   extravagant practice; her drollery, that mocked at her melancholy; her\r\n   imagination, that mocked at her drollery; and her wonderful manners,\r\n   all her own, that mocked a little at everything: these were part of\r\n   the constant freshness which made those who loved her love her so\r\n   much.  'If my servants can live with me a week, they can live with me\r\n   for ever,' she often said; 'but the first week sometimes kills them.'\r\n   A domestic who had been long in her service quitted his foreign home\r\n   the instant he heard of her death, and, travelling for thirty hours,\r\n   arrived travel-stained and breathless, like a messenger in a romantic\r\n   tale, just in time to drop a handful of flowers into her grave.\"\r\n\r\nThere came on board of our boat a fruit-dealer, and the old pilot, seeing\r\nthat I was about to invest a _real_ in grapes, said, \"Let me buy them for\r\nyou\"; which he did, obtaining half-a-peck of exquisite large grapes of a\r\nbeautiful purple colour.\r\n\r\nThere was a middle-aged lady among the passengers, of whom the least I\r\ncan say was, that she had a great many little winning ways of making\r\nherself disagreeable.  She imposed frightfully on me while on board,\r\ngetting me to mark her trunks for her, and carry them into the hold, &c.\r\n(the sailors disliked her so much that they refused to touch them), and\r\nthen cut me dead when on shore.  This ancient horror, seeing me with so\r\nmany grapes, and learning the price, concluded that if a mere boy like me\r\ncould get so many, she, a lady, could for four reals lay in a stock which\r\nwould last for life, more or less.  So she obtained a bushel-basket,\r\nexpecting to get it heaped full; but what was her wrath at only getting\r\nfor her silver half-dollar just enough to hide the bottom thereof!  Great\r\nwas her rage, but rage availed her nought.  She did not call old pilots\r\n\"Brother,\" or give them cigars, or talk Malagano politely.  She was not\r\neven \"half-Spanish,\" and therefore, as we used to say at college of\r\ncertain unpopular people, was \"a bad smoke.\"\r\n\r\nWe went on shore on Sunday, which in those days always made Gibraltar\r\nliterally like a fancy ball.  The first person whom I met was a pretty\r\nyoung lady in full, antique, rich Castilian costume, followed by a\r\nservant bearing her book of devotion.  Seeing my gaze of admiration, she\r\nsmiled, at which I bowed, and she returned the salute and went her way.\r\nSuch an event had never happened to me before in all my life.  I accepted\r\nit philosophically as one of a new order of things into which I was\r\ndestined to enter.  Then I saw men from every part of Spain in quaint\r\ndresses, Castilians in cloaks, Andalusians in the jaunty _majo_ rig,\r\nGallegos, Moors from the Barbary coast, many Greeks, old Jews in\r\ngabardines, Scotch Highland soldiers, and endless more--_concursus\r\nsplendidus_--_non possum non mirari_.\r\n\r\nI felt myself very happy and very much at home in all this.  I strolled\r\nabout the streets talking Spanish to everybody.  Then I met with a\r\nsmuggler, who asked me if I wanted to buy cigars.  I did.  In New York my\r\nuncle George had given me a box of five hundred excellent Havanas, and\r\nthese had lasted me exactly twenty days.  I had smoked the last twenty-\r\nfive on the last day.  So I went and bought at a low enough figure a box\r\nof the worst cigars I had ever met with.  But youth can smoke\r\nanything--except deceit.\r\n\r\nEntrance to the galleries was strictly forbidden in those days, but an\r\nincorruptible British sergeant, for an incorruptible dollar or two,\r\nshowed us over them.  There was, too, a remarkable man, a ship-chandler\r\nnamed Felipe, to whom I was introduced.  Felipe spoke twenty-four\r\nlanguages.  He boarded every ship and knew everybody.  Gibraltar was then\r\na vast head-quarters of social evils, or blessings, and Felipe, who was a\r\nperfect Hercules, mentioned incidentally that he had had a new _maja_, or\r\n_moza_, or _muger_, or _puta_, every night for twenty years! which was\r\nconfirmed by common report.  It was a firm principle with him to always\r\n_change_.  This extraordinary fact made me reflect deeply on it as a\r\n_psychological_ phenomenon.  This far surpassed anything I had ever heard\r\nat Princeton.  Then this and that great English dignitary was pointed out\r\nto me--black eyes ogled me--everybody was polite, for I had a touch of\r\nthe Spanish manner which I had observed in the ex-Capitan-General and\r\nothers whom I had known in Philadelphia; and, in short, I saw more that\r\nwas picturesque and congenial in that one day than I had ever beheld in\r\nall my life before.  I had got into \"my plate.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Gibraltar our ship sailed on to Marseilles.  The coasts were full of\r\nold ruins, which I sketched.  We lay off Malaga for a day, but I could\r\nnot go ashore, much as I longed to.  At Marseilles, Sam and the captain\r\nand I went to a very good hotel.\r\n\r\nNow it had happened that on the voyage before a certain French lady--the\r\ncaptain said she was a Baroness--having fallen in love with the said\r\ncaptain, had secreted herself on board the vessel, greatly to his horror,\r\nand reappeared when out at sea.  Therefore, as soon as we arrived at\r\nMarseilles, the injured husband came raging on board and tried to shoot\r\nthe captain, which made a great _scandal_.  And, moved by this example,\r\nthe coloured cook of our vessel, who had a wife, shot the head-waiter on\r\nthe same day, being also instigated by jealousy.  Sam Godfrey chaffed the\r\ncaptain for setting a bad moral example to the niggers--which was all\r\nquite a change from Princeton.  Life was beginning to be lively.\r\n\r\nThere had come over on the vessel with us, in the cabin, a droll\r\ncharacter, an actor in a Philadelphia theatre, who had promptly found a\r\nlodging in a kind of maritime boarding-house.  Getting into some\r\ndifficulty, as he could not speak French he came in a great hurry to beg\r\nme to go with him to his _pension_ to act as interpreter, which I did.  I\r\nfound at once that it was a Spanish house, and the resort of smugglers.\r\nThe landlady was a very pretty black-eyed woman, who played the guitar,\r\nand sang Spanish songs, and brought out Spanish wine, and was\r\nmarvellously polite to me, to my astonishment, not unmingled with\r\ninnocent gratitude.\r\n\r\nThere I was at home.  At Princeton I had learned to play the guitar, and\r\nfrom Manuel Gori, who had during all his boyhood been familiar with low\r\nlife and smugglers, I had learned many songs and some slang.  And so,\r\nwith a crowd of dark, fierce, astonished faces round me of men eagerly\r\nlistening, I sang a smuggler's song--\r\n\r\n   \"Yo que soy contrabandista,\r\n   Y campo a me rispeto,\r\n   A todos mi desafio,\r\n   Quien me compra hilo negro?\r\n      Ay jaleo!\r\n      Muchachas jaleo!\r\n   Quien me compra hilo negro!\"\r\n\r\nGreat was the amazement and thundering the applause from my auditors.  Let\r\nthe reader imagine a nun of fourteen years asked to sing, and bursting\r\nout with \"Go it while you're young!\"  Then I sang the _Tragala_, which\r\ncoincided with the political views of my friends.  But my grand _coup_\r\nwas in reserve.  I had learned from Borrow's \"Gypsies in Spain\" a long\r\nstring of Gitano or Gypsy verses, such as--\r\n\r\n   \"El eray guillabela,\r\n      El eray obusno;\r\n   Que avella romanella,\r\n      No avella obusno!\"\r\n\r\n   \"Loud sang the _gorgio_ to his fair,\r\n      And thus his ditty ran:--\r\n   'Oh, may the Gypsy maiden come,\r\n      And not the Gypsy man!'\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet again--\r\n\r\n   \"Coruncho Lopez, gallant lad,\r\n      A smuggling he would ride;\r\n   So stole his father's ambling prad,\r\n   And therefore to the galleys sad\r\n      Coruncho now I guide.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a final _coup_.  How the _diabolo_ I, such an innocent stranger\r\nyouth, had ever learned Spanish _Gypsy_--the least knowledge of which in\r\nSpain implies unfathomable iniquity and fastness--was beyond all\r\ncomprehension.  So I departed full of honour amid thunders of applause.\r\n\r\nFrom the first day our room was the resort of all the American\r\nship-captains in Marseilles.  We kept a kind of social hall or exchange,\r\nwith wine and cigars on the side-table, all of which dropping in and out\r\nrather reminded me of Princeton.  My friend the actor had pitched upon a\r\nyoung English Jew, who seemed to me to be a doubtful character.  He sang\r\nvery well, and was full of local news and gossip.  He, too, was at home\r\namong us.  One evening our captain told us how he every day smuggled\r\nashore fifty cigars in his hat.  At hearing this, I saw a gleam in the\r\neyes of the young man, which was a revelation to me.  When he had gone, I\r\nsaid to the captain, \"You had better not smuggle any cigars to-morrow.\r\nThat fellow is a spy of the police.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day Captain Jack on leaving his ship was accosted by the\r\n_douaniers_, who politely requested him to take off his hat.  He refused,\r\nand was then told that he must go before the _prefet_.  There the request\r\nwas renewed.  He complied; but \"forewarned, forearmed\"--there was nothing\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jack complimented me on my sagacity, and scolded the actor for\r\nmaking such friends.  But he had unconsciously made me familiar with one\r\ncompared to whom the spy was a trifle.  I have already fully and very\r\ntruthfully described this remarkable man in an article in _Temple Bar_,\r\nbut his proper place is here.  He was a little modest-looking Englishman,\r\nwho seemed to me rather to look up to the fast young American captains as\r\ntypes or models of more daring beings.  Sometimes he would tell a mildly-\r\nnaughty tale as if it were a wild thing.  He consulted with me as to\r\ngoing to Paris and hearing lectures at the University, his education\r\nhaving been neglected.  He had, I was told, experienced a sad loss,\r\nhaving just lost his ship on the Guinea coast.  One day I condoled with\r\nhim, saying that I heard he had been ruined.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the captain, \"I have.  Something like this: My mother once\r\nhad a very pretty housemaid who disappeared.  Some time after I met her\r\nmagnificently dressed, and I said, 'Sally, where do you live now?'  She\r\nreplied, 'Please, sir, I don't live anywhere now; I've been _ruined_.'\"\r\n\r\nSam explained to me that the captain had a keg of gold-dust and many\r\ndiamonds, and having wrecked his vessel intentionally, was going to\r\nLondon to get a heavy insurance.  He had been \"ruined\" to his very great\r\nadvantage.  Then Sam remarked--\r\n\r\n\"You don't know the captain.  I tell you, Charley, that man is an old\r\nslaver or pirate.  See how I'll draw him out.\"\r\n\r\n'The next day Sam began to talk.  He remarked that he had been to sea and\r\nhad some money which he wished to invest.  His health required a warm\r\nclimate, such as the African coast.  We would both, in fact, like to go\r\ninto the Guinea business.  [_Bozales_--\"sacks of charcoal,\" I remarked in\r\nSpanish slaver-slang.]  The captain smiled.  He had apparently heard the\r\nexpression before.  He considered it.  He had a great liking for me, and\r\nthought that a trip or two under the black flag would do me a great deal\r\nof good.  So he noted down our address, and promised that as soon as he\r\nshould get a ship we should hear from him.\r\n\r\nAfter that the captain, regarding me as enlisted in the fraternity, and\r\nonly waiting till 'twas \"time for us to go,\" had no secrets from me.  He\r\nwas very glad that I knew Spanish and French, and explained that if I\r\nwould learn Coromantee or Ebo, it would aid us immensely in getting\r\ncargoes.  By the way, I became very well acquainted in after years with\r\nKing George of Bonney, and can remember entertaining him with a story how\r\na friend of mine once (in Cuba) bought thirty Ebos, and on entering the\r\nbarracoon the next morning, found them all hanging by the necks dead,\r\nlike a row of possums in the Philadelphia market--they having, with\r\nmagnificent pluck, and in glorious defiance of Buckra civilisation,\r\nresolved to go back to Africa.  I have found other blacks who believed\r\nthat all good darkies when they die go to Guinea, and one of these was\r\nvery touching and strange.  He had been brought as a slave-child to South\r\nCarolina, but was always haunted by the memory of a group of cocoa-palms\r\nby a place where the wild white surf of the ocean bounded up to the\r\nshore--a rock, sunshine, and sand.  There he declared his soul would go.\r\nHe was a Voodoo, and a man of marvellous strange mind.\r\n\r\nDay by day my commander gave me, as I honestly believe, without a shadow\r\nof exaggeration, all the terrific details of a slaver's life, and his\r\nstrange experiences in buying slaves in the interior.  Compared to the\r\nawful massacres and cruelties inflicted by the blacks on one another, the\r\nwhite slave trade seemed to be philanthropic and humane.  He had seen at\r\nthe grand custom in Dahomey 2,500 men killed, and a pool made of their\r\nblood into which the king's wives threw themselves naked and wallowed.\r\n\"One day fifteen were to be tortured to death for witchcraft.  I bought\r\nthem all for an old dress-coat,\" said the captain.  \"I didn't want them,\r\nfor my cargo was made up; it was only to save the poor devils' lives.\"\r\n\r\nIf a slaver could not get a full cargo, and met with a weaker vessel\r\nwhich was full, it was at once attacked and plundered.  Sometimes there\r\nwould be desperate resistance, with the aid of the slaves.  \"I have seen\r\nthe scuppers run with blood,\" said the captain.  And so on, with much\r\nmore of the same sort, all of which has since been recorded in the\r\n\"Journal of Captain Canot,\" from which latter book I really learned\r\nnothing new.  I might add the \"Life of Hobart Pacha,\" whom I met many\r\ntimes in London.  A real old-fashioned slaver was fully a hundred times\r\nworse than an average pirate, because he _was_ the latter whenever he\r\nwished to rob, and in his business was the cause of far more suffering\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nThe captain was very fond of reading poetry, his favourite being\r\nWordsworth.  This formed quite a tie between us.  He was always rather\r\nmild, quiet, and old-fashioned--in fact, muffish.  Once only did I see a\r\nspark from him which showed what was latent.  Captain Jack was describing\r\na most extraordinary run which we had made before a gale from Gibraltar\r\nto Cape de Creux, which was, indeed, true enough, he having a very fast\r\nvessel.  But the _Guinea_ captain denied that such time had ever been\r\nmade by any craft ever built.  \"And I have had to sail sometimes pretty\r\nfast in my time,\" he added with one sharp glance--no more--but, as Byron\r\nsays of the look of Gulleyaz, 'twas like a short glimpse of hell.  Pretty\r\nfast!  I should think so--now and then from an English cruiser, all sails\r\nwetted down, with the gallows in the background.  But as I had been on\r\nboard with Sam, the question was settled.  We _had_ made a run which was\r\nbeyond all precedent.\r\n\r\nI fancy that the captain, if he escaped the halter or the wave, in after\r\nyears settled down in some English coast-village, where he read\r\nWordsworth, and attended church regularly, and was probably regarded as a\r\ngentle old duffer by the younger members of society.  But take him for\r\nall in all, he was the mildest-mannered man that ever scuttled ship or\r\ncut a throat, and he always behaved to me like a perfect gentleman, and\r\nnever uttered an improper word.\r\n\r\nWe had to wait one month till my cousin could get certain news from\r\nAmerica.  We employed the time in travelling in the south, visiting\r\nArles, Nismes, Montpellier, and other places.  An English gentleman named\r\nGordon, whom I had met in Marseilles, had given me a letter of\r\nintroduction to M. Saint Rene Taillandier in the latter place.  I knew\r\nnothing at all then about this great man, or that he was the first French\r\ncritic of German literature, but I presented my letter, and he kindly\r\nwent with me about the town to show me its antiquities.  I can remember\r\ndiscussing Gothic tracery with him; also, that I told him I was deeply\r\ninterested in the Troubadours.  He recommended Raynouard and several\r\nother books, when finding that I was familiar with them all, he smiled,\r\nand said that he believed he could teach me nothing more.  I did not know\r\nit then, but that word from him would have been as good as a diploma for\r\nme in Paris.\r\n\r\nAs for old Roman ruins and Gothic churches, and cloisters grey, and the\r\narrowy Rhone, and castellated bridges--everything was in a more original\r\nmoss-grown, picturesque condition then than it now is--I enjoyed them all\r\nwith an intensity, a freshness or love, which passeth all belief.  I had\r\nattended Professor Dodd's lectures more than once, and illuminated\r\nmanuscripts, and had bought me in Marseilles Berty's \"Dictionary of\r\nGothic Architecture,\" and got it by heart, and began to think of making a\r\nprofession of it, which, if I had known it, was the very wisest thing I\r\ncould have done.  And that this is no idle boast is clear from this, that\r\nI in after years made a design according to which a \"store,\" which cost\r\n30,000 pounds, was built, my plan being believed by another skilled\r\narchitect to have been executed by a \"professional.\"  This was really the\r\nsad slip and escape of my lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn those days, really _good_ red wine was given to every one at every\r\ntable; savoury old-fashioned dishes, vegetables, and fruits were served\r\nfar more freely and cheaply than they now are, when every dainty is sent\r\nby rail to Paris or London, and the drinking of Bordeaux and Burgundy did\r\nme much good.  Blessed days of cheapness and good quality, before\r\nchicory, the accursed poison, had found its way into coffee, or\r\noleomargarine was invented, or all things canned--the world will never\r\nsee ye more!  I have now lived for many months in a first-class Florence\r\nhotel, and in all the time have not tasted one fresh Italian mushroom, or\r\ntruffle, or olive--nothing but tasteless abominations bottled in France!\r\n\r\nIt was settled that my cousin should return from Marseilles to the United\r\nStates, while I was to go on alone to Italy.  It was misgivingly\r\npredicted at home by divers friends that I would be as a lamb set loose\r\namong wolves, and lose all my money at the outstart.  Could they have\r\nlearned that within a week after my arrival I had been regarded by\r\nSpanish smugglers as a brother, and tripped up a spy of the police, and\r\nbeen promised a situation as a slaver's and pirate's assistant, they\r\nmight have thought that I had begun to learn how to take care of myself\r\nin a hurry.  As for losing my money, I, by a terrible accident, _doubled\r\nit_, as I will here describe.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving home, a lady cousin had made for Samuel and me each a\r\npurse, and they were exactly alike.  Now by a purse I mean a real\r\n_purse_, and not a pocket-book, or a porte-monnaie, or a wallet--that is,\r\nI mean a long bag with a slit and two rings, and nothing else.  And my\r\ncousin having often scolded me for leaving mine lying about in our room,\r\nI seeing it, as I thought, just a few minutes before my departure, lying\r\non the table, pocketed it, thanking God that Sam had not found it, or\r\nscolded me.\r\n\r\nI went on board the steamboat and set sail towards Italy.  I was sea-sick\r\nall night, but felt better the next day.  Then I had to pay out some\r\nmoney, and thought I would look over my gold.  To my utter amazement, it\r\nwas _doubled_!  This I attributed to great generosity on Sam's part, and\r\nI blessed him.\r\n\r\nBut, merciful heavens! what were my sensations at finding in the lower\r\ndepth of my pocket _another purse_ also filled with Napoleons in\r\nrouleaux!  Then it all flashed upon me.  Samuel, the careful, had left\r\n_his_ purse lying on the table, and I had supposed it was mine!  I felt\r\nas wretched as if I had lost instead of won.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to Naples I found a letter from my cousin bewailing his loss.\r\nHe implored me, if I knew nothing about it, not to tell it to a human\r\nsoul.  There was a M. Duclaux in Marseilles, with whom we had had our\r\nbusiness dealings, and from him Sam had borrowed what he needed.  I at\r\nonce requested Captain Olive, of the steamer, to convey the purse and its\r\ncontents to M. Duclaux, which I suppose was done _secundem ordinem_.\r\n\r\nPoor Sam!  I never met him again.  He died of consumption soon after\r\nreturning home.  He was one of whom I can say with truth that I never saw\r\nin him a fault, however trifling.  He was honour itself in everything, as\r\nhumane as was his grandfather before him, ever cheerful and kind, merry\r\nand quaint.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the steamboat declared that meals were included in the\r\nfare, \"except while stopping at a port.\"  But we stopped every day at\r\nGenoa or Leghorn, or somewhere, and stayed about fifteen hours, and as\r\nalmost every passenger fell sea-sick after going ashore, the meals were\r\nnot many.  On board the first day, I made the acquaintance of Mr. James\r\nTemple Bowdoin, of Boston, and Mr. Mosely, of whom I had often heard as\r\neditor of the _Richmond Whig_.  Mr. Bowdoin was a nephew of Lady Temple,\r\nand otherwise widely connected with English families.  He is now living\r\n(1892), and I have seen a great deal of him of late years.  With these\r\ntwo I joined company, and travelled with them over Italy.  Both were much\r\nolder than I, and experienced men of the world; therefore I was in good\r\nhands, and better guides, philosophers, mentors, pilots, and friends I\r\ncould hardly have found.  Left to myself, I should probably ere the\r\nwinter was over have been the beloved chief of a gang of gypsies, or\r\nbrigands, or witches, or careering the wild sea-wave as a daring\r\nsmuggler, all in innocence and goodness of heart; for truly in Marseilles\r\nI had begun to put forth buds of such strange kind and promise as no\r\nfriend of mine ever dreamed of.  As it was, I got into better, if less\r\npicturesque, society.\r\n\r\nWe came to Naples, and went to a hotel, and visited everything.  In those\r\ndays the beggars and pimps and pickpockets were beyond all modern\r\nconception.  The picturesqueness of the place and people were only\r\nequalled by the stinks.  It was like a modern realistic novel.  We went a\r\ngreat deal to the opera, also to the Blue Grotto of Capri, and ascended\r\nMount Vesuvius, and sought Baiae, and made, in fact, all the excursions.\r\nAs there were three, and sometimes half-a-dozen of our friends on these\r\ntrips, we had, naturally, with us quite a _cortege_.  Among these was an\r\nill-favoured rascal called \"John,\" who always received a dollar a day.\r\nOne evening some one raised the question as to what the devil it was that\r\nJohn did.  He did not carry anything, or work to any account, or guide,\r\nor inform, yet he was always there, and always in the way.  So John,\r\nbeing called up, was asked what he did.  Great was his indignation, for\r\nby this time he had got to consider himself indispensable.  He declared\r\nthat he \"directed, and made himself generally useful.\"  We informed him\r\nthat we would do our own directing, and regarded him as generally\r\nuseless.  So John was discarded.  Since then I have found that \"John\" is\r\na very frequent ingredient in all societies and Government offices.  There\r\nare Johns in Parliament, in the army, and in the Church.  His children\r\nare pensioned into the third and fourth and fortieth generation.  In\r\nfact, I am not sure that John is not the great social question of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThere was in Philadelphia an Academy of Fine Arts, or Gallery, of which\r\nmy father had generously presented me with two shares, which gave me free\r\nentrance.  There were in it many really excellent pictures, even a first-\r\nclass Murillo, besides Wests and Allstons.  Unto this I had, as was my\r\nwont, read up closely, and reflected much on what I read, so that I was\r\nto a certain degree prepared for the marvels of art which burst on me in\r\nNaples.  And if I was, and always have been, _rather_ insensible to the\r\nmerits of Renaissance sculpture and architecture, I was not so to its\r\npainting, and not at all blind to the unsurpassed glories of its classic\r\nprototypes.  Professor Dodd had indeed impressed it deeply and specially\r\non my mind that the revival of a really pure Greek taste in England, or\r\nfrom the work of Stewart and Revett, was contemporary with that for\r\nGothic architecture, and that the appreciation of one, if _true_, implies\r\nthat of the other.  As I was now fully inspired with my new resolution to\r\nbecome an architect, I read all that I could get on the subject, and\r\nnaturally examined all remains of the past far more closely and\r\ncritically than I should otherwise have done.  And this again inspired in\r\nme (who always had a mania for bric-a-brac and antiquity, which is\r\ncertainly hereditary) a great interest in the characteristic _decoration_\r\nof different ages, which thing is the soul and life of all aesthetic\r\narchaeology and the minor arts; which latter again I truly claim to have\r\nbrought, I may say, into scientific form and made a branch of education\r\nin after years.\r\n\r\nI think that we were a month in Naples.  I kept a journal then, and\r\nindeed everywhere for three years after.  The reader may be thankful that\r\nI have it not, for I foresee that I shall easily recall enough to fill\r\nten folios of a thousand pages solid brevier each, at this rate of\r\nreminiscences.  As my predilection for everything German and Gothic came\r\nout more strongly every day, Mr. Mosely called me familiarly Germanicus,\r\na name which was indeed not ill-bestowed at that period.\r\n\r\nFrom Naples we went to Rome by _vettura_, or in carriages.  We were two\r\ndays and two nights on the route.  I remember that when we entered Rome,\r\nI saw the _douanier_ who examined my trunk remove from it, as he thought\r\nunperceived, a hair-brush, book, &c., and slyly hide them behind another\r\ntrunk.  I calmly walked round, retook and replaced them in my trunk, to\r\nthe discomfiture, but not in the least to the shame, of the thief, who\r\nonly grinned.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may say, once for all, that one can hardly fail to have a mean\r\nopinion of human common-sense in government, when we see this system of\r\nexamining luggage still maintained.  For all that any country could\r\n_possibly_ lose by smuggling in trunks, &c., would be a hundred-fold\r\nrecompensed by the increased amount of travel and money imported, should\r\nit be done away with, as has been perfectly and fully proved in France;\r\nthe announcement a year ago that examination would be null or formal\r\nhaving had at once the effect of greatly increasing travel.  And as there\r\nis not a custom-house in all Europe where a man who knows the trick\r\ncannot pull through his luggage by bribery--the exceptions being\r\nmiraculously rare--the absurdity and folly of the system is apparent.\r\n\r\nWe went to the Hotel d'Allemagne, where I fell ill, either because I had\r\na touch of Neapolitan malaria in me (in those days the stench of the city\r\nwas perceptible three miles out at sea, and might have risen unto heaven\r\nabove and been smelt by the angels, had they and their home been as near\r\nto earth as was believed by the schoolmen), or because the journey had\r\nbeen too much for me.  However, an English physician set me up all right\r\nin two or three days (he wanted to sell us pictures which would have\r\ncured any one--of a love of art), and then there began indeed a glorious\r\nscampering and investigating, rooting and rummaging--\r\n\r\n   \"'Mid deathless lairs in solemn Rome.\"\r\n\r\nGalleries and gardens, ruins and palaces, Colosseum and temples, churches\r\nand museums--ye have had many a better informed and many a more inspired\r\nor gifted visitor than I, but whether from your first Sabine days you\r\never had a happier one, or one who enjoyed you more with the simple\r\nenjoyment of youth and hope gratified, I doubt.  Sometimes among moss-\r\ngrown arches on a sunny day, as the verd-antique lizards darted over the\r\nstones from dark to light, while far in the distance tinkled bells,\r\neither from cows or convents, and all was calm and sweet, I have often\r\nwondered if it could indeed be real and not a dream.  Life often seemed\r\nto me then to be too good to be true.  And there was this at least good\r\nin my Transcendentalism and Poly-Pantheism, that it quite unconsciously\r\nor silently gave me many such hours; for it had sunk so deeply into my\r\nsoul, and was so much a real part thereof, that it inspired me when I\r\nnever thought of it, in which I differed by a heaven's width from the\r\nprofessional Yankee Transcendentalists, Presbyterians, Methodists,\r\nAEsthetes, and other spiritualists or sorcerers, who always kept their\r\nblessed belief, as a holy fugleman, full in sight, to give them sacred\r\nstraight tips, or as a Star-spangled Bannerman who waved exceedingly,\r\nwhile my spirit was a shy fairy, who dwelt far down in the depths of the\r\nall too green sea of my soul, where it seemed to me she had ever been, or\r\never a storm had raised a wave on the surface.  Antiquely verdant green I\r\nwas, no doubt.  And even to this day the best hours of my life are when I\r\nhear her sweet voice 'mid ivy greens or ruins grey, in wise books, hoar\r\ntraditions.  Be it where it will, it is _that_, and not the world of men\r\nor books, which gives the charm.\r\n\r\nIt was usual for all who drew from Torlonia's bank not less than 20\r\npounds to be invited to his soirees.  To ensure the expenses, the footman\r\nwho brought the invitation called the day after for not less than _five\r\nfrancs_.  But the entertainment was well worth the money, and more.  There\r\nwas a good supper--Thackeray has represented a character in \"Vanity Fair\"\r\nas devouring it--and much amusement.\r\n\r\nNow I had written my name _Chas._, which being mistaken for _Chev._, I in\r\ndue time, received an invitation addressed to M. le Chevalier Godfrey de\r\nLeland.  And it befell that I once found a lost decoration of the Order\r\nof the Golden Spur, which in those days _was_ actually sold to anybody\r\nwho asked for it for ten pounds, and was worth \"nothing to nobody.\"  This\r\ncaused much fun among my friends, and from that day I was known as the\r\nChevalier Germanicus, or the Knight of the Golden Spur, to which I\r\nassented with very good grace as a joke.  There were even a few who\r\nreally believed that I had been decorated, though I never wore it, and\r\none day I received quite a severe remonstrance from a very patriotic\r\nfellow-countryman against the impropriety of my thus risking my loss of\r\ncitizenship.  Which caused me to reflect how many there are in life who\r\nrise to such \"honours,\" Heaven only knows how, in a back-stairs way.  I\r\nknow in London a very great man of science, _nemini secundus_, who has\r\nnever been knighted, although the tradesman who makes for him his\r\nimplements and instruments has received the title and the _accolade_.\r\n_Fie_ at justitia!\r\n\r\nI saw at one of the Torlonia entertainments a marvellously beautiful and\r\nstrange thing, of which I had read an account in Mme. de Stael's\r\n_Corinne_.  There was a stage, on which appeared a young girl, plainly\r\ndressed, and bearing a simple small scarf.  She did not speak or dance,\r\nor even assume \"artistic positions\"; what she did was far more striking\r\nand wonderful.  She merely sat or stood or reclined in many ways, every\r\none of which seemed to be _perfectly_ natural or habitual, and all of\r\nwhich were incredibly graceful.  I have forgotten how such women were\r\ncalled in Italy.  I am sure that this one had never been trained to it,\r\nfor the absolute ease and naturalness with which she sat or stood could\r\nnever have been taught.  If it could, every woman in the world would\r\nlearn it.  Ristori was one of these instinctive _Graces_, and it\r\nconstituted nearly all the art there was in her.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1846.  The Carnival of that year in Rome was the last real\r\none which Italy ever beheld.  It was the very last, for which every soul\r\nsaved up all his money for months, in order to make a wild display, and\r\ndance and revel and indulge in\r\n\r\n         \"Eating, drinking, masking,\r\n   And other things which could be had for asking.\"\r\n\r\nThen all Rome ran mad, and rode in carriages full of flowers, or carts,\r\nor wheelbarrows, or triumphal chariots, or on camels, horses, asses, or\r\nrails--_n'importe quoi_--and merrily cast _confetti_ of flour or lime at\r\none another laughing, while grave English tourists on balconies\r\nlaboriously poured the same by the peck from tin scoops on the heads of\r\nthe multitude, under the delusion that they too were enjoying themselves\r\nand \"doing\" the Carnival properly.  It was the one great rule among\r\nItalians that no man should in the Carnival, under any provocation\r\nwhatever, lose his temper.  And here John Bull often tripped up.  On the\r\nlast night of the last Carnival--that great night--there was the _Senza\r\nMoccolo_ or extinguishment of lights, in which everybody bore a burning\r\ntaper, and tried to blow or knock out the light of his neighbour.  Now,\r\nbeing tall, I held my taper high with one hand, well out of danger, while\r\nwith a broad felt hat in the other I extinguished the children of light\r\nlike a priest.  I threw myself into all the roaring fun like a wild boy,\r\nas I was, and was never so jolly.  Observing a pretty young English lady\r\nin an open carriage, I thrice extinguished her light, at which she\r\nlaughed, but at which her brother or beau did not, for he got into a\r\ngreat rage, even the first time, and bade me begone.  Whereupon I\r\npromptly renewed the attack, and then repeated it, \"according to the\r\nrules of the game,\" whereat he began to curse and swear, when I, in the\r\nItalian fashion of rebuke (to the delight of sundry Italians), pointed my\r\nfinger at him and hissed; which constituted the winning _point d'honneur_\r\nin the game.\r\n\r\nThere, too, was the race of wild horses, right down through the Corso or\r\nCondotti, well worth seeing, and very exciting, and game suppers o'nights\r\nafter the opera, and the meeting with many swells and noted folk, and now\r\nit all seems like some memory of a wild phantasmagoria or hurried magic-\r\nlantern show--galleries and ruins by day, and gaiety by night.  Even so\r\ndo all the scenes of life roll up together at its end, often getting\r\nmixed.\r\n\r\nYet another Roman memory or two.  We had taken lodgings in the Via\r\nCondotti, where we had a nice sitting-room in common and a good\r\ncoal-fire.  Our landlady was lady-like and spoke French, and had long\r\nbeen a governess in the great Borghese family.  As for her husband, there\r\nwere thousands of Liberals far and wide who spoke of him as the greatest\r\nscoundrel unhung, for he was at the head of the Roman police, and I\r\nverily believe knew more iniquity than the Pope himself.  It would have\r\nbeen against all nature and precedent if I had not become his dear friend\r\nand _protege_, which I did accordingly, for I liked him very much indeed,\r\nand Heaven knows that such a rum couple of friends as Giuseppe Navone and\r\nmyself, when out walking together, could not at that time have been found\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nIt may here be observed that I was decidedly getting on in the quality of\r\nmy Mentors, for, as regarded morals and humanity, my old pirate and\r\nslaver friend was truly as a lamb and an angel of light compared to\r\nNavone.  And I will further indicate, as this book will prove, that if I\r\nwas not at the age of twenty-three the most accomplished young scoundrel\r\nin all Europe, it was not for want of such magnificent opportunities and\r\nfriends as few men ever enjoyed.  But it was always my fate to neglect or\r\nto be unable to profit by advantages, as, for instance, in mathematics;\r\nnor in dishonesty did I succeed one whit better, which may be the reason\r\nwhy the two are somehow dimly connected in my mind.  Here I think I see\r\nthe unfathomable smile in the eye of Professor Dodd (it never got down to\r\nhis lips), who was the incarnate soul of purity and honour.  But then the\r\nbanker, E. Fenzi, who swindled me out of nearly 500 francs, was an\r\narithmetician, and I write under a sense of recent wrong.  How this loss,\r\nand Fenzi's failure, flight, and the fuss which it all caused in\r\nFlorence, were accurately foretold me by a witch, may be read in detail\r\nin my \"Etrusco-Roman Remains in Tuscan Tradition.\"  London: T. Fisher\r\nUnwin.\r\n\r\nMy landlady was a very zealous Catholic, and tried to convert me.  This\r\nwas a new experience, and I enjoyed it.  I proved malleable.  So she\r\ncalled in a Jesuit priest to perfect the work.  I listened with deep\r\ninterest to his worn-out _fade_ arguments, made a few points of feeble\r\nobjection for form's sake, yielded, and met him more than half way.  But\r\nsomehow he never called again.  _Latet anguis in herba_--my grass was\r\nrather too green, I suppose.  I was rather sorry, for I expected some\r\namusement.  But I had been _too_ deep for the Jesuit--and for myself.\r\n\r\nThe time came for my departure.  I was to go alone on to Florence, in\r\nadvance of my friends.  Navone arranged everything nicely for me: I was\r\nto go by diligence on to Civita Vecchia, where I was to call on a\r\nrelative of his, who kept a bric-a-brac shop.  I did not know how or why\r\nit was that I was treated with such great respect, as if with fear, by\r\nthe conductor, and by all on the road.  I was _en route_ all night, and\r\nin the morning, very weary, I went to a hotel, called a commissionaire,\r\nand bade him get my passport from the police, and have it _visee_, and\r\nsecure me a passage on the boat to Leghorn.  He returned very soon, and\r\nsaid with an air of bewilderment, \"Signore, you sent me on a useless\r\nerrand.  Here is your passport put all _en regle_, and your passage is\r\nall secured!\"\r\n\r\nI saw it at once.  The kind fatherly care of the great and good Navone\r\nhad done it all!  He had watched over me invisibly and mysteriously all\r\nthe time during the night; on the road I was a pet child of the Roman\r\npolice!  The Vehmgericht had endorsed me with three crosses!  Therefore\r\nthe passport and the passage were all right, and the captain was very\r\ndeferential, and I got to Florence safely.\r\n\r\nIn Florence I went to the first hotel, which was then in what is now\r\nknown as the Palazzo Feroni, or Viesseux's, the great circulating library\r\nof Italy.  It is a fine machicolated building, which was in the Middle\r\nAges the prison of the Republic.  From my window I had a fine view of the\r\nVia Tornabuoni--in which I had coffee since I concluded the last line.\r\nThere were but three or four persons the first evening at the\r\n_table-d'hote_.  One was a very beautiful Polish countess, who spoke\r\nFrench perfectly.  She was very fascinating, and, when she ate a salad,\r\nsmeared her lovely mouth and cheeks all round with oil to her ears.  Some\r\none said something to her about the manner in which the serfs were\r\ntreated in Poland, whereupon she replied with great vivacity that the\r\nPolish serfs were even more degraded and barbarous than those of Russia.\r\nWhich remark inspired in me certain reflections, which were amply\r\ndeveloped in after years by the perusal of Von Moltke's work on Poland,\r\nand more recently of that very interesting novel called \"The Deluge.\"  If\r\nfreedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell, it was probably, from a\r\nhumanitarian point of view, with joy.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, at the same hotel a singular man, a Lithuanian Pole\r\nnamed Andrekovitch, with whom I became very intimate, and whom I met in\r\nafter years in Paris and in America.  He had been at a German university,\r\nwhere he had imbibed most liberal and revolutionary ideas.  He\r\nsubsequently took part in one or two revolutions, and was exiled.  He had\r\nread about Emerson in a French magazine, and was enthusiastic over him.\r\nIn strange contrast to him was a handsome young man from the Italian\r\nTyrol, who was, like the Pole and myself, full of literary longings, but\r\nwho was still quite a Roman Catholic.  He knew about as much, or as\r\nlittle, of the world as I did, and was \"gentle and bland.\"  When we bade\r\nfarewell, he wept, and kissed me.  Andrekovitch was eccentric, wild, and\r\nSlavonian-odd to look at at any time.  One evening he came into my room\r\nclad in scarlet dressing-gown, and having altogether the appearance of a\r\nsorcerer just out of a Sabbat.  The conversation took a theological turn.\r\nAndrekovitch was the ragged remnant of a Catholic, but a very small one.\r\nHe sailed close to the wind, and neared Rationalism.\r\n\r\n\"But the Pope! . . .\" exclaimed the Tyrolese.\r\n\r\nAndrekovitch rose, looking more sorcerer or Zamiel-like than ever, and\r\nexclaiming, \"The Pope be--!\" left the room.  The last word was lost in\r\nthe slam of the door.  It was a melodramatic departure, and as such has\r\never been impressed on my memory.\r\n\r\nMy father, while a merchant, and also my uncle, had done a very large\r\nbusiness in Florentine straw goods, and I had received letters to several\r\nEnglish houses who had corresponded with them.  I heard, long after, that\r\nmy arrival had caused a small panic in Florence in business circles, it\r\nbeing apprehended that I had come out to establish a rival branch, or to\r\nbuy at head-quarters for the American \"straw-market.\"  I believe that\r\ntheir fears were appeased when I interviewed them.  One of these worthy\r\nmen had been so long in Italy that he had caught a little of its\r\nsuperstition.  He wished to invest in lottery tickets, and asked me for\r\nlucky numbers, which I gave him.\r\n\r\nAs I write these lines in Florence, I have within half-an-hour called for\r\nthe first time on an old witch or _strega_, whom I found surrounded by\r\nherbs and bottles, and a magnificent cat, who fixed his eyes on me all\r\nthe time, as if he recognised a friend.  I found, however, that she only\r\nknew the common vulgar sorceries, and was unable to give me any of the\r\nhigher _scongiurazioni_ or conjurations; and as I left, the old sorceress\r\nsaid respectfully and admiringly, \"You come to _me_ to learn, O Maestro,\r\nbut it is fitter that I take lessons from you!\"  Then she asked me for\r\n\"the wizard blessing,\" which I gave her in Romany.  So my first and last\r\nexperiences in the deep and dark art come together!\r\n\r\nI became acquainted in Florence with Hiram Powers, which reminds me that\r\nI once in Rome dined _vis-a-vis_ to Gibson and several other artists,\r\nwith whom I became intimate as young men readily do.  I contrived to\r\nstudy architecture, and made myself very much at home in a few studios.\r\nThe magnificent _Fiorara_, or flower-girl, whom so many will remember for\r\nmany years, was then in the full bloom of her beauty.  She and others\r\ngave flowers to any strangers whom they met, not expecting money down,\r\nbut when a man departed the flower-girls were always on hand to solicit a\r\ngratuity.  Twenty years later this same Fiorara, still a very handsome\r\nwoman, remembered me, and gave my wife a handsome bouquet on leaving.\r\n\r\nI studied Provencal and Italian poetry in illuminated MSS. in the\r\nAmbrosian or Laurentian Library, and took my coffee at Doney's, and saw\r\nmore of Florence in a few weeks' time than I have ever done since in any\r\none of my residences here, though some of them have been for six and nine\r\nmonths.  As is quite natural.  Who that lives in London ever goes to see\r\nthe Tower?  All things in Europe were so new and fresh and beautiful and\r\nwonderful to me then, and I had been yearning for them so earnestly for\r\nso many years, and this golden freedom followed so closely on the deadly\r\n_ennui_ of Princeton, that I could never see enough.\r\n\r\nIf any of my readers want to know something of sorcery, I can tell them\r\nthat among its humblest professors it is perfectly understood that\r\npleasure or enjoyment is one of its deepest mysteries or principles, as\r\nan integral part of fascination.  So I can feel an _enchantment_,\r\nsometimes almost incredible, in gazing on a Gothic ruin in sunshine, or a\r\nbeautiful face, a picture by Carpaccio, Norse interlaces, lovable old\r\nbooks, my amethyst amulet, or a garden.  For if you could sway life and\r\ndeath, and own millions, or walk invisible, you could do no more than\r\n_enjoy_; therefore you had better learn to enjoy much without such power.\r\nThus endeth the first lesson!\r\n\r\nI arrived in Venice.  There had been a time in America when, if I could\r\nhave truthfully declared that I had ever been in a gondola, I should have\r\nfelt as if I held a diploma of nobility in the Grand Order of\r\nCosmopolites.  Having been conveyed in one to my hotel on the Grand\r\nCanal, I felt that I at last held it!  Now I had really mastered the\r\nthree great cities of Italy, which was the first and greatest part of all\r\ntravel in all the world of culture and of art.  Fate might hurl me back\r\nto America, or even into New Jersey, but I had \"swum in a gondola.\"\r\n\r\nI very soon made the acquaintance of two brothers from New York named\r\nSeymour, somewhat older than myself, and men of reading and culture.  With\r\nthem I \"sight-saw\" the city.  I had read Venice up rather closely at\r\nPrinceton, and had formed a great desire to go on the Bridge of Sighs.\r\nFor some reason this was then very strictly forbidden.  Our Consul, who\r\nwas an enterprising young man, told me that he had been for months trying\r\nto effect it in vain.  It at once became apparent to me as a piece of\r\nmanifest destiny that I must do it.\r\n\r\nOne day I had with me a clever fellow, a commissionaire or guide, and\r\nconsulted him.  He said, \"I think it may be done.  You look like an\r\nAustrian, and may be taken for an officer.  Walk boldly into the chief's\r\noffice, and ask for the keys of the bridge; only show a little cheek.  You\r\nmay get them.  Give the chief's man two francs when you come out.  At the\r\nworst, he can only refuse to give them.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a very cheeky undertaking, but I ventured on it with the\r\ncalmness of innocence.  I went into the office, and said, \"The keys to\r\nthe bridge, if you please!\" as if I were in an official hurry on State\r\nbusiness.  The official stared, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand that you formally demand the keys?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ja wohl_, certainly; at once, if you please!\"\r\n\r\nThey were handed over to me, and I saw the bridge and gave the two\r\nfrancs, and all was well.  But it gave me no renown in Venice, for the\r\nConsul and all my friends regarded it as a fabulous joke of mine,\r\ninspired by poetic genius.  But I sometimes think that the official who\r\nyielded up the keys, and the man whom he sent with me, and perhaps the\r\ncommissionaire, all had a put-up job of it among them on those keys, and\r\nseveral glasses all round out of those two francs.  _Quien sabe_?  _Vive\r\nla bagatelle_!\r\n\r\nWe went on an excursion to Padua.  What I remember is, that what\r\nimpressed me most was a placard here and there announcing that a work on\r\nOken had just appeared!  This rather startled me.  Whether it was for or\r\nagainst the great German offshoot from Schelling, it proved that somebody\r\nin Italy had actually studied him!  _Eppure si muove_, I thought.  It\r\ncannot be true that--\r\n\r\n   \"Padua! the lamp of learning\r\n   In thy halls no more is burning.\"\r\n\r\nI have been there several times since.  All that I now recall is that the\r\nhotel was not very good the last time.\r\n\r\nI met in Venice a young New Yorker named Clark, who had crossed with me\r\non the ship.  He was a merry companion.  Sailing with him one morning in\r\na gondola along the Grand Canal, we saw sitting before a hotel its\r\nporter, who was an unmistakable American man of full colour.  Great was\r\nClark's delight, and he called out, \"I say, Buck! what the devil are you\r\ndoing here?\"\r\n\r\nWith a delighted grin, the man and brother replied in deep Southern\r\naccent--\r\n\r\n\"Dey sets me hyar fo' a bait to 'tice de Americans with.\"\r\n\r\nI heard subsequently that he had come from America with his mistress, and\r\nserved her faithfully till there came into the service a pretty French\r\ngirl.  Great was the anger of the owner of the man to find that he had\r\nunmistakably \"enticed\" the maid.  To which he replied that it was a free\r\ncountry; that he had married the damsel--she was his wife; and so the\r\npair at once packed up and departed.\r\n\r\nWe used to hear a great deal before the war from Southerns about the\r\ndevotion of their slaves, but there were a great many instances in which\r\nthe fidelity did not exactly hold water.  There was an old Virginia\r\ngentleman who owned one of these faithful creatures.  He took him several\r\ntimes to the North, and as the faithful one always turned a deaf ear to\r\nthe Abolitionists, and resisted every temptation to depart, and refused\r\nevery free-ticket offered for a journey on \"the underground railway,\" and\r\nwent back to Richmond, he was of course trusted to an unlimited extent.\r\nWhen the war ended he was freed.  Some one asked him one day how he could\r\nhave been such a fool as to remain a slave.  He replied--\r\n\r\n\"Kase it paid.  Dere's nuffin pays like being a dewoted darkey.  De las'\r\ntime I went Norf wid massa I made 'nuff out of him to buy myself free\r\ntwice't over.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless there were many instances of \"pampered and petted\" household\r\nservants who had grown up in families who had sense to know that they\r\ncould never live free in the freezing North without hard work.  These\r\nwere the only devoted ones of whom I ever heard.  The field-hands,\r\ndisciplined by the lash, and liable to have their wives or children or\r\nrelatives sold from them--_as happened on an average once at least in a\r\nlife_--were all to a man quite ready to forsake \"ole massa\" and \"dear ole\r\nmissus,\" and flee unto freedom.  And what a vile mean wretch any man must\r\nbe who would sacrifice his _freedom_ to any other living being, be it for\r\nlove or feudal fidelity--and what a villain must the man be who would\r\naccept such a gift!\r\n\r\nI had never thought much of this subject before I left home.  I did not\r\n_like_ slavery, nor to think about it.  But in Europe I did like such\r\nthought, and I returned fully impressed with the belief that slavery was,\r\nas Charles Sumner said, \"the sum of all crimes.\"  In which summation he\r\nshowed himself indeed a \"sumner,\" as it was called of yore.  Which cost\r\nme many a bitter hour and much sorrow, for there was hardly a soul whom I\r\nknew, except my mother, to whom an Abolitionist was not simply the same\r\nthing as a disgraceful, discreditable malefactor.  Even my father, when\r\nangry with me one day, could think of nothing bitterer than to tell me\r\nthat I knew I was _an Abolitionist_.  I kept it to myself, but the reader\r\ncan have no idea of what I was made to suffer for years in Philadelphia,\r\nwhere everything Southern was exalted and worshipped with a baseness\r\nbelow that of the blacks themselves.\r\n\r\nFor all of which in after years I had full and complete recompense.  I\r\nlived to see the young ladies who were ready to kneel before any man who\r\nowned \"sla-aves,\" detest the name of \"South,\" and to learn that their\r\nfathers and friends were battling to the death to set those slaves free.\r\nI lived to see the roof of the \"gentlemanly planter,\" who could not of\r\nyore converse a minute with me without letting me know that he considered\r\nhimself as an immeasurably higher being than myself, blaze over his head\r\namid yell and groan and sabre-stroke--\r\n\r\n   \"And death-shots flying thick and fast,\"\r\n\r\nwhile he fled for life, and the freed slaves sang hymns of joy to God.  I\r\nsaw the roads, five miles wide, level, barren, and crossed with ruts,\r\nwhere Northern and Southern armies had marched, and where villages and\r\nplantations had once been.  I saw countless friends or acquaintances, who\r\nhad once smiled with pitying scorn at me, or delicately turned the\r\nconversation when Abolition was mentioned in my presence, become all at\r\nonce blatant \"nigger-worshippers,\" abundant in proof that they had always\r\nhad \"an indescribable horror of slavery\"--it was, in fact, so\r\nindescribable that (until it was evident that the North would conquer)\r\nnone of them ever succeeded in giving anybody the faintest conception of\r\nit, or any idea that it existed.  I can still recall how gingerly and\r\ncautiously--\"paw by paw into the water\"--these dough faces became hard-\r\nbaked Abolitionists, far surpassing us of the Old Guard in zeal.  I lived\r\nto see men who had voted against Grant and _reviled_ him become his most\r\nintimate friends.  But enough of such memories.  It is characteristic of\r\nthe American people that, while personally very vindictive, they forgive\r\nand forget political offences far more amicably--very far--than do even\r\nthe English.  However, in the case of the Rebellion, this was a very easy\r\nthing for those to do who had not, like us old Abolitionists, borne the\r\nburden and heat of the day, and who, coming in at the eleventh hour, got\r\nall the contracts and offices!  It never came into the head of any man to\r\nwrite a _Dictionnaire des Girouettes_ in America.  These late converts\r\nhad never known what it was to be Abolitionists while it was\r\n\"unfashionable,\" and have, as it were, live coals laid on the quivering\r\nheart--as I had a thousand times during many years--all for believing the\r\ntremendous and plain truth that _slavery_ was a thousand times wickeder\r\nthan the breach of all the commandments put together.  It was so peculiar\r\nfor any man, not a Unitarian or Quaker, to be an _Abolitionist_ in\r\nPhiladelphia from 1848 until 1861, that such exceptions were pointed out\r\nas if they had been Chinese--\"and d---d bad Chinese at that,\" as a friend\r\nadded to whom I made the remark.  So much for man's relations with poor\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nMy old friend, B. P. Hunt, was one of these few exceptions.  His was a\r\nvery strange experience.  After ceasing to edit a \"selected\" magazine, he\r\nwent to and fro for many voyages to Haiti, where, singular as it may\r\nseem, his experiences of the blacks made of him a stern Abolitionist.  He\r\nmarried a connection of mine, and lived comfortably in Philadelphia, I\r\nthink, until the eighties.\r\n\r\nI travelled with Mr. Clark from Venice to Milan, where we made a short\r\nvisit.  I remember an old soldier who spoke six languages, who was\r\ncicerone of the roof of the Cathedral, and whom I found still on the roof\r\ntwenty years later, and still speaking the same six tongues.  I admired\r\nthe building as a beautiful fancy, exquisitely decorated, but did not\r\nthink much of it as a specimen of Gothic architecture.  It is the best\r\ntest of aesthetic culture and knowledge in the world.  When you hear\r\nanybody praise it as the most exquisite or perfect Gothic cathedral in\r\nexistence, you may expect to hear the critic admire the designs of\r\nChippendale furniture or the decoration of St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nSo we passed through beautiful Lombardy and came to Domo d'Ossola, where\r\na strange German-Italian patois was spoken.  It was in the middle of\r\nApril, and we were warned that it would be very dangerous to cross the\r\nSimplon, but we went on all night in a carriage on sleigh-runners,\r\nthrough intervals of snowstorm.  Now and then we came to rushing mountain-\r\ntorrents bursting over the road; far away, ever and anon, we heard the\r\nroar of a _lauwine_ or avalanche; sometimes I looked out, and could see\r\nstraight down below me a thousand feet into an abyss or on a headlong\r\nstream.  We entered the great tunnel directly from another, for the snow\r\nlay twenty feet deep on the road, and a passage had been dug under it for\r\nseveral hundred feet, and so two tunnels were connected.  Just in the\r\nworst of the road beyond, and in the bitterest cold, we met a sleigh, in\r\nwhich were an English gentleman and a very beautiful young lady,\r\napparently his daughter, going to Italy.  \"I saw her but an instant, yet\r\nmethinks I see her now\"--a sweet picture in a strange scene.  Poets used\r\nto \"me-think\" and \"me-seem\" more in those days, but we endured it.  Then\r\nin the morning we saw Brieg, far down below us in the valley in green\r\nleaves and sunshine, and when we got there then I realised that we were\r\nin a new land.\r\n\r\nWe had a great giant of a German conductor, who seemed to regard Clark\r\nand me as under his special care.  Once when we had wandered afar to look\r\nat something, and it was time for the stage or _Eilwagen_ to depart, he\r\nhunted us up, scolded us \"like a Dutch uncle\" in German, and drove us\r\nalong before him like two bad boys to the diligence, \"pawing up\" first\r\none and then the other, after which, shoving us in, he banged and locked\r\nthe door with a grunt of satisfaction, even as the Giant Blunderbore\r\nlocked the children in the coffer after slamming down the lid.  Across\r\nthe scenes and shades of forty years, that picture of the old conductor\r\ndriving us like two unruly urchins back to school rises, never to be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nWe went by mountains and lakes and Gothic towns, rocks, forests, old\r\nchateaux, and rivers--the road was wild in those days--till we came to\r\nGeneva.  Thence Clark went his way to Paris, and I remained alone for a\r\nweek.  I had, it is true, a letter of introduction to a very eminent\r\nPresbyterian Swiss clergyman, so I sent it in with my card.  His wife\r\ncame out on the balcony, looked coolly down at me, and concluding, I\r\nsuppose from my appearance, that I was one of the ungodly, went in and\r\nsent out word that her husband was out, and would be gone for an\r\nindefinite period, and that she was engaged.  The commissionaire who was\r\nwith me--poor devil!--was dreadfully mortified; but I was not very much\r\nastonished, and, indeed, I was treated in much the same manner, or worse,\r\nby a colleague of this pious man in Paris, or rather by his wife.\r\n\r\nI believe that what kept me a week in Geneva was the white wine and\r\ntrout.  At the end of the time I set out to the north, and on the way met\r\nwith some literary or professional German, who commended to me the\r\n\"Pfisterer-Zunft\" or Bakers' Guild as a cheap and excellent hostelry.  And\r\nit was curious enough, in all conscience.  During the Middle Ages, and\r\ndown to a very recent period, the _Zunfte_ or trade-guilds in the Swiss\r\ncities carried it with a high hand.  Even the gentlemen could only obtain\r\nrights as citizens by enrolling themselves as the trade of aristocrats.  I\r\nhad heard of the boy who thought he would like to be bound apprentice to\r\nthe king; in Berne he might have been entered for a lower branch of the\r\nbusiness.  These guilds had their own local taverns, inns, or _Herbergs_,\r\nwhere travelling colleagues of the calling might lodge at moderate rates,\r\nbut nobody else.  However, as time rolled by, these _Zunfte_ or guild-\r\nlodgings were opened to strangers.  One of the last which did so was that\r\nof the _Pfister_ or bakers (Latin, _pistor_), and this had only been done\r\na few weeks ere I went there.  As a literary man whom I met on the\r\nramparts said to me, \"That place is still strong in the Middle Age.\"  It\r\nwas a quaint old building, and to get to my room I had to cross the great\r\nguild-hall of the Ancient and Honourable Society of Bakers.  There were\r\nthe portraits of all the Grand Masters of the Order from the fourteenth\r\nor fifteenth century on the walls, and the concentrated antique tobacco-\r\nsmoke of as many ages in the air, which, to a Princeton graduate, was no\r\nmore than the scent of a rose to a bee.\r\n\r\nI could speak a little German--not much--but the degree to which I felt,\r\nsympathised with, and understood everything Deutsch, passeth all words\r\nand all mortal belief.  _Sit verbo venia_!  But I do not believe that any\r\nhuman being ever crossed the frontier who had thought himself down, or\r\nrather raised himself up, into Teutonism as I had on so slight a\r\nknowledge of the language, even as a spider throweth up an invisible\r\nthread on high, and then travels on it.  Which thing was perceived\r\nmarvellously soon, and not without some amazement, by the Germans, who\r\nhave all at least this one point in common with Savages, New Jerseymen,\r\nRed Indians, Negroes, Gypsies, and witches, that they by mystic sympathy\r\n_know those who like them_, and take to them accordingly, guided by some\r\naltogether inexplicable clue or _Hexengarn_, even as deep calleth unto\r\ndeep and star answereth star without a voice.  Whence it was soon\r\nobserved at Heidelberg by an American student that \"Leland would abuse\r\nthe Dutch all day long if he saw fit, but never allowed anybody else to\r\ndo so.\"  The which thing, as I think, argues the very _ne plus ultra_ of\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nI found my way to Strasburg, where I went to the tip-top outside of the\r\ncathedral, and took the railway train for Heidelberg.  And here I had an\r\nadventure, which, though trifling to the last degree, was to me such a\r\ngreat and new experience that I will describe it, let the reader think\r\nwhat he will.  I went naturally enough first-class, so uncommon a thing\r\nthen in Germany that people were wont to say that only princes,\r\nEnglishmen, and asses did so.  There entered the same carriage a very\r\nlady-like and pretty woman.  The guard, seeing this, concluded\r\nthat--whatever he concluded, he carefully drew down all the curtains,\r\nlooking at me with a cheerful, genial air of intense mystery, as if to\r\nsay, \"I twig; it's all right; I'll keep your secret.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a positive fact that all this puzzled me amazingly.  There were\r\nmany things in which I, the friend and pupil of Navone, was as yet as\r\ninnocent as a babe unborn.  The lady seemed to be amused--as well she\r\nmight.  _Sancta simplicitas_!  I asked her why the conductor had drawn\r\nthe curtains.  She laughed, and explained that he possibly thought we\r\nwere a bridal pair or lovers.  Common sense and ordinary politeness\r\nnaturally inspired the reply that I wished we were, which declaration was\r\nso amiably received that I suggested the immediate institution of such an\r\narrangement.  Which was so far favourably received that it was sealed\r\nwith a kiss.  However, the seal was not broken.  I think the lady must\r\nhave been very much amused.  It is not without due reflection that I\r\nrecord this.  Kissing went for very little in Germany in those days.  It\r\nwas about as common in Vienna as shaking hands.  But this was my first\r\nexperience in it.  So I record it, because it seems as if some benevolent\r\nfairy had welcomed me to Germany; it took place just as we crossed the\r\nfrontier.  However, I found out some time after, by a strange accident,\r\nthat my fairy was the wife of a banker who lived beyond Heidelberg; and\r\nat Heidelberg I left her and went to the first hotel in the town.\r\n\r\nI had formed no plans, and had no letters to anybody.  I had read\r\nHowitt's \"Student Life in Germany\" through and through, so I thought I\r\nwould study in Heidelberg.  But how to begin?  That was the question.  I\r\nwent into a shop and bought some cigars.  There I consulted with the\r\nshopkeeper as to what I should do.  Could he refer me to some leading\r\nauthority in the University, known to him, who would give me advice?  He\r\ncould, and advised me to consult with the Pedell Capelmann.\r\n\r\nNow I didn't know it, but Pedell--meaning beadle, commonly called Poodle\r\nby the students--was the head-constable of the University.  In honest\r\ntruth I supposed he must be the President or Pro-Rector.  So I went to\r\nPedell Capelmann.  His appearance did not quite correspond to my idea of\r\na learned professor.  He was an immensely burly, good-natured fellow, who\r\ncame in in his shirt-sleeves, and who, when he learned what I wanted,\r\nburst out into a _Her'r'r' Gottsdonerrwetter_! of surprise, as he well\r\nmight.  But I knew that the Germans were a very _sans facon bourgeois_\r\npeople, and still treated him with deep respect.  He suggested that, as\r\nthere were a great many American students there, I had better call on\r\nthem.  He himself would take me to see the Herr O--, with whom, as I\r\nsubsequently learned, he had more than once had discussions relative to\r\nquestions of University-municipal discipline.  As for the startling\r\npeculiarity which attended my introduction to University life, it is best\r\nsummed up in the remark which the Herr O. (of Baltimore) subsequently\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\"Great God, fellows! _he made his first call on old Capelmann_!!\"\r\n\r\nHe took me to the Herr O. and introduced me.  I was overwhelmed with my\r\ncordial reception.  There was at once news sent forth that a new man and\r\na brother fellow-countryman had come to join the ranks.  \"And messengers\r\nthrough all the land sought Sir Tannhauser out.\"  I was pumped dry as to\r\nmy precedents, and as I came fresh from Princeton and had been through\r\nItaly, I was approved of.  The first thing was a discussion as to where I\r\nwas to live.  The Frau Directorinn Louis in the University Place had two\r\nfine rooms which had just been occupied by a prince.  So we went and\r\nsecured the rooms, which were indeed very pleasant, and by no means dear\r\nas it seemed to me.  I was to breakfast in my rooms, dine with the family\r\nat one o'clock, and sup about town.\r\n\r\nThen there was a grand council as to what I had better study, and over my\r\nprospects in life; and it was decided that, as the law-students were the\r\nmost distinguished or swell of all, I had better be a lawyer.  So it was\r\narranged that I should attend Mittermayer's and others' lectures; to all\r\nof which I cheerfully assented.  The next step was to give a grand supper\r\nin honour of my arrival.  After the dinner and the wine, I drank twelve\r\n_schoppens_ of beer, and then excused myself on the plea of having\r\nletters to write.  I believe, however, that I forgot to write the\r\nletters.  And here I may say, once for all, that having discovered that,\r\nif I had no gift for mathematics, I had a great natural talent for\r\nRheinwein and lager, I did not bury that talent in a napkin, but, like\r\nthe rest of my friends, made the most of it, firstly, during two\r\nsemesters in Heidelberg:\r\n\r\n   \"Then I bolted off to Munich,\r\n      And within the year,\r\n   Underneath my German tunic\r\n      Stowed whole butts of beer;\r\n   For I drank like fifty fishes,\r\n      Drank till all was blue,\r\n   For whenever I was vicious\r\n      I was thirsty too.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of which \"dire deboshing\" was that, having come to Europe with\r\na soul literally attenuated and starved for want of the ordinary gaiety\r\nand amusement which all youth requires, my life in Princeton having been\r\none continued strain of a sobriety which continually sank into subdued\r\nmelancholy, and a body just ready to yield to consumption, I grew\r\nvigorous and healthy, or, as the saying is, \"hearty as a buck.\"  I\r\nbelieve that if my Cousin Sam had gone on with me even-pace, that he\r\nwould have lived till to-day.  When we came abroad I seemed to be the\r\nweakest; he returned, and died in a few months from our hereditary\r\ndisease.  How many hecatombs of young men have been murdered by\r\n\"seriousness\" and \"total abstinence,\" miscalled _temperance_, in our\r\nAmerican colleges, can never be known; perhaps it is as well that it\r\nnever will be; for if it were, there would be a rush to the other\r\nextreme, which would \"upset society.\"  And here be it noted that, with\r\nall our inordinate national or international Anglo-Saxon sense of\r\nsuperiority to everybody and everything foreign, we are in the _main_\r\nthing--that is, the truly rational enjoyment of life and the art of\r\nliving--utterly inferior to the German and Latin races.  We are for the\r\nmost part either too good or too bad--totally abstemious or raving\r\ndrunk--always in a hurry after excitement or in a worry over our sins, or\r\nthose of our neighbours.  \"Rest, rest, perturbed Yankee, _rest_!\"\r\n\r\nMy rooms were on the ground-floor, the bedroom looking into the\r\nUniversity Square and my study into a garden.  Next door to me dwelt\r\nPaulus, the king of the Rationalists.  He was then, I believe, ninety-\r\nfour years of age.  He remained daily till about twelve or one in a\r\ncomatose condition, when he awoke and became lively till about three,\r\nwhen he sank into sleep again.  His days were like those of a far\r\nNorthern winter, lit by the sun at the same hours.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a very gentlemanly young man knocked at my door, and\r\nentered and asked in perfect English for a Mr. Bell, who lived in the\r\nsame house.  I informed him that Mr. Bell was out, but asked him to enter\r\nmy room and take a chair, which he did, conversing with me for half an\r\nhour, when he departed, leaving a card on a side-table.  In a few minutes\r\nlater, O., who was of the kind who notice everything, entered, took up\r\nthe card, and read on it the name and address of the young Grand Duke of\r\nBaden, who was naturally by far the greatest man in the country, he being\r\nits hereditary ruler.\r\n\r\n\"Where the devil did you get this?\" asked O., and all, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" I replied, \"it's only the Duke.  He has just been in here making a\r\ncall.  If you fellows had come five minutes sooner you'd have seen him.\r\nHave some beer!\"\r\n\r\nThe impression that I was a queer lot, due to my making my first call on\r\nCapelmann _et cetera_, was somewhat strengthened by this card, until I\r\nexplained how I came by it.  But as Dr. Johnson in other words remarked,\r\nthere are people to whom such queer things happen daily, and others to\r\nwhom they occur once a year.  And there was never yet a living soul who\r\nentered into my daily life who did not observe that I belong to the\r\nformer class.  If I have a guardian angel, it must be Edgar A. Poe's\r\nAngel of the Odd.  But he generally comes to those who belong to him!\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before I profited much by my lectures, because it was\r\nfearful work for me to learn German.  I engaged a tutor, and worked hard,\r\nand read a great deal, and talked it _con amore_; but few persons would\r\nbelieve how slowly I learned it, and with what incredible labour.  How\r\noften have I cursed up hill and down dale, the Tower of Babel, which\r\nfirst brought the curse of languages upon the world!  And what did I ever\r\nhave to do with that Tower?  Had I lived in those days, I would never\r\nhave laid hand to the work in merry, sunny, lazy Babylon, nor contributed\r\na brick to it.  By the way, it was a juvenile conjecture of mine that the\r\nTower of Babel was destroyed for being a shot-tower, in which ammunition\r\nwas prepared to be used by the heathen.  Which theory might very well\r\nhave been inspired by a verse from the old Puritanical rendering of the\r\nPsalms:--\r\n\r\n   \"Ye race itt is not alwayes gott\r\n      By him who swiftest runns,\r\n   Nor ye Battell by ye Peo-pel\r\n      Who shoot with longest gunnes.\"\r\n\r\nEven before I had gone to Princeton I had read and learned a great deal\r\nrelative to Justinus Kerner, the great German supernaturalist, mystic,\r\nand poet, firstly from a series of articles in the _Dublin University\r\nMagazine_, and later from a translation of \"The Seeress of Prevorst,\" and\r\nseveral of the good man's own romances and lyrics.  I suppose that, of\r\nall men on the face of the earth, I should have at that time preferred to\r\nmeet him.  Wherefore, as a matter of course, it occurred that one fine\r\nmorning a pleasant gentlemanly German friend of mine, who spoke English\r\nperfectly, and whose name was Rucker, walked into my room, and proposed\r\nthat we should take a two or three days' walk up the Neckar with our\r\nknapsacks, and visit the famous old ruined castle of the Weibertreue.  My\r\nmother had read me the ballad-legend of it in my boyhood, and I had\r\nlearned it by heart.  Indeed, I can still recall it after sixty years:--\r\n\r\n   \"Who can tell me where Weinsberg lies?\r\n      As brave a town as any;\r\n   It must have sheltered in its time\r\n      Brave wives and maidens many:\r\n   If e'er I wooing have to do,\r\n   Good faith, in Weinsberg I will woo!\"\r\n\r\n\"And then, when we are there,\" said Rucker, \"we will call on an old\r\nfriend of my father's, named Justinus Kerner.  Did you ever hear of him?\"\r\n\r\nDid a Jew ever hear of Moses, or an American of General Washington?  In\r\nfive minutes I convinced my friend that I knew more about Kerner than he\r\nhimself did.  Whereupon it was decided that we should set forth on the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nBlessed, beautiful, happy summer mornings in Suabia--green mounts and\r\ngrey rocks with old castles--peasants harvesting hay--a _Kirchweih_, or\r\npeasant's merry-making, with dancing and festivity--till we came to\r\nWeinsberg, and forthwith called on the ancient sage, whom we found with\r\nthe two or three ladies and gentlemen of his family.  I saw at a glance\r\nthat they had the air of aristocracy.  He received us very kindly, and\r\ninvited us to come to dinner and sup with him.\r\n\r\nThe Weibertreue is an old castle which was in or at the end of Dr.\r\nKerner's garden.  Once, when all the town had taken refuge in it from the\r\nEmperor Conrad, the latter gave the women leave to quit the fort, and\r\nalso permission to every one to carry with her whatever was unto her most\r\nvaluable, precious, or esteemed.  And so the dames went forth, every one\r\nbearing on her back her husband.\r\n\r\nIn the tower of the castle, or in its wall, which was six feet thick,\r\nwere eight or ten windows, gradually opening like trumpets, through which\r\nthe wind blew all the time, and pleasantly enough on a hot summer day.  In\r\neach of these the Doctor had placed an AEolian harp, and he who did not\r\nbelieve in fairies or the gentle spirit of a viewless sound should have\r\nsat in that tower and listened to the music as it rose and fell, as in\r\nendless solemn glees or part-singing; one harp stepping in, and pealing\r\nout richly and strangely as another died away, while anon, even as the\r\nnew voice came, there thrilled in unison one or two more Ariels who\r\nseemed to be hurrying up to join the song.  It was a marvellous strange\r\nthing of beauty, which resounded, indeed, all over Germany, for men spoke\r\nof it far and wide.\r\n\r\nQuite as marvellous, in the evening, was the Doctor's own performance on\r\nthe single and double Jew's harp.  From this most unpromising instrument\r\nhe drew airs of such exquisite beauty that one could not have been more\r\nastonished had he heard the sweet tones of Grisi drawn from a cat by\r\ntwisting its tail.  But we were in a land of marvels and wonders, or, as\r\nan English writer described it, \"Weinsberg, a place on the Neckar,\r\ninhabited partly by men and women--some in and some out of the body--and\r\npartly by ghosts.\"  There were visions in the air, and dreams sitting on\r\nthe staircases; in fact, when I saw the peasants working in the fields, I\r\nshould not have been astonished to see them vanish into mist or sink into\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nAnd yet from the ruined castle of the Weibertreue Kerner pointed out to\r\nus a man walking along the road, and that man was the very incarnation of\r\nall that was sober, rational, and undream-like; for it was David Strauss,\r\nauthor of the \"Life of Jesus.\"  And at him too I gazed with the awe due\r\nto a great man whose name is known to all the cultured world; and to me\r\nmuch more than the name; for I had read, as before mentioned, his \"Life\r\nof Jesus\" when I first went to Princeton.\r\n\r\nDr. Kerner took to me greatly, and said that I very much reminded him, in\r\nappearance and conversation, of what his most intimate friend, Ludwig\r\nUhland, had been at my age; and as he repeated this several times, and\r\nspoke of it long after to friends, I think it must have been true,\r\nalthough I am compelled to admit that people who pride themselves on\r\nlooking like this or that celebrity never resemble him in the least,\r\nmentally or spiritually, and are generally only mere caricatures at best.\r\n\r\nOn our return we climbed into an old Gothic church-tower, in which I\r\nfound a fifteenth-century bell, bearing the words, _Vivas voco_, _mortuos\r\nplango_, _fulgura_ _frango_, and much more--\r\n\r\n   \"The dead I knell, the living wake,\r\n   And the power of lightning break!\"\r\n\r\nwhich caused me to reflect on the vast degree to which all the minor uses\r\nand observances of the Church--which are nine-tenths of all their\r\nreligion to the multitude--were only old heathen superstitious in new\r\ndresses.  The bell was a spell against the demons of lightning in old\r\nEtrurian days; to this time the Tuscan peasant bears one in the darkening\r\ntwilight-tide to drive away the witches flitting round: in him and them\r\n\"those evening bells\" inspired a deeper sentiment than poetry.\r\n\r\nIn a village, Rucker, finding the beer very good, bought a cask of it,\r\nwhich was put on board the little Neckar steamboat on which we returned\r\nto Heidelberg.  And thus provided, the next evening he gave a \"barty\" up\r\nin the old castle, among the ruins by moonlight, where I \"assisted,\" and\r\nthe _lager_ was devoured, even to the last drop.\r\n\r\nI soon grew tired of the family dinners with the Frau Inspectorinn and\r\nthe Herr Inspector with the _one_ tumbler of Neckar wine, which I was\r\nexpected not to exceed; so I removed my dining to the \"Court of Holland,\"\r\na first-class hotel, where O. and the other Americans met, and where the\r\nexpectation was not that a man should by any means limit himself to one\r\nglass, but that, taking at least one to begin with, he should\r\nconsiderably exceed it.  This hotel was kept by a man named Spitz, who\r\nlooked his name to perfection.\r\n\r\n   \"Er spitzt betrubt die Nase,\"\r\n\r\nas Scheffel wrote of him in his poem, _Numero Acht_, the scene of which\r\nis laid in the \"Court of Holland.\"  Here a word about Scheffel.  During\r\nthe following semester he was for months a daily table-companion of mine\r\nat the Bremer-Eck, where a small circle of students--_quorum pars\r\nfui_--met every evening to sup and _kneip_, or to drink beer and smoke\r\nand sing until eleven.  Little did I dream in those days that he would\r\nbecome the great popular poet of his time, or that I should ever\r\ntranslate his _Gaudeamus_.  I owe the \"Court of Holland\" to this day for\r\na dinner and a bottle of wine.  It is the only debt I owe, to my\r\nknowledge, to anybody on earth.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved among the Americans that we should all make a\r\nfoot-excursion with knapsacks down the Rhine to Cologne.  It was done.  So\r\nwe went gaily from town to town, visiting everything, making excursions\r\ninland now and then.  We had a bottle or two of the best Johannisberg in\r\nthe very Schloss itself--_omne cum praetio_--and meeting with such\r\nadventures as befell all wandering students in those old-fashioned, merry\r\ntimes.  The Rhine was wild as yet, and not paved, swept, garnished and\r\nfull of modern villas and adornment, as now.  I had made, while in\r\nAmerica, a manuscript book of the places and legends of and on the Rhine,\r\nwith many drawings.  This, and a small volume of Snow's and Planche's\r\n\"Legends of the Rhine,\" I carried with me.  I was already well informed\r\nas to every village and old ruin or tower on the banks.\r\n\r\nSo we arrived at Cologne, and saw all the sights.  The cathedral was not\r\nthen finished, and the town still boasted its two-and-seventy stinks, as\r\ncounted by Coleridge.  Then we returned by steamer to Mainz, and thence\r\nfooted it home.\r\n\r\nLittle by little I rather fell away from my American friends, and began\r\nto take to German or English associates, and especially to the company of\r\ntwo Englishmen.  One was named Leonard Field, who is now a lawyer in\r\nLincoln's Inn Fields; the other was Ewan P. Colquhoun, a younger brother\r\nof Sir Patrick Colquhoun, whom I knew well, and as friend, in after\r\nyears, until his recent death.  I always, however, maintained a great\r\nintimacy with George Ward, of Boston, who became long after a banker and\r\nBaring's agent in America.  In one way and another these two twined into\r\nmy life in after years, and led to my making many acquaintances or\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nI walked a great deal all about Heidelberg to many very picturesque\r\nplaces, maintaining deep interest in all I saw by much loving reading of\r\n_Des Knaben Wunderhorn_ and Uhland's collection of old German songs--his\r\nown poems I knew long before--the _Nibelungen_ and _Hero-Book_, and a\r\ngreat variety of other works.  I had dropped the Occulta, and for a year\r\nor two read nothing of the kind except casually the works of\r\nEckhartshausen and Justinus Kerner.  I can now see that, as I became\r\nhealthy and strong, owing to the easy, pleasant existence which I led, it\r\nwas best for me after all.  \"Grappling with life\" and earnestly studying\r\na profession then might have extinguished me.  My mental spring, though\r\nnot broken, was badly bent, and it required a long time to straighten it.\r\n\r\nColquhoun was only eighteen, but far beyond his years in dissipation, and\r\nwell-nigh advanced to cool cynicism.  With him I made many an excursion\r\nall about the country.  Wherever a _Kirclweih_ or peasants' ball was to\r\nbe held, he always knew of it, and there we went.  One morning early he\r\ncame to my rooms.  There was to be a really stunning duel fought early\r\nbetween a Senior and some very illustrious _Schlager_, and he had two\r\nEnglish friends named Burnett who would go with us.  So we went, and\r\nmeeting with Rucker at the _Pawkboden_, it was proposed that we should go\r\non together to Baden-Baden.  To which I objected that I had only twenty\r\nflorins in my pocket, and had no time to return home for more.  \"Never\r\nmind,\" said Colquhoun; \"Rucker has plenty of money; we can borrow from\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nWe went to Baden and to the first hotel, and had a fine dinner, and saw\r\nthe Burnetts off.  Then, of course, to the gaming-table, where Colquhoun\r\nspeedily lost all his money, and I so much that I had but ten florins\r\nleft.  \"Never mind; we'll pump on Rucker,\" said Colquhoun.\r\n\r\nWe went up to visit the old castle.  While there, Rucker took off his\r\novercoat, in which he had his pocket-book, and laid it over a chair.  When\r\nwe returned to the hotel the pocket-book was gone!  There we were, with a\r\nhotel-bill to pay and never a cent wherewith to pay it.  I had, however,\r\nstill ten florins.  Colquhoun suddenly remembered that he had seen\r\nsomething in the town, price ten florins, which he _must_ buy.  It was\r\nsomething which he had promised to buy for a relative in England.  It was\r\na very serious case of necessity.\r\n\r\nI doubted my dear friend, but having sworn him by all his gods that he\r\nwould _not_ gamble with the money, I gave it to him.  So he, of course,\r\nwent straight to the gaming-table, and, having luck, won enough to pay\r\nour debt and take us home.\r\n\r\nI should mention that Rucker went up to the castle and found his pocket-\r\nbook with all the money.  \"For not only doth Fortune favour the bold,\" as\r\nis written in my great unpublished romance of \"Flaxius the Immortal,\"\r\n\"but, while her hand is in, also helps their friends with no unsparing\r\nmeasure, as is marvellously confirmed by Machiavelli.\"\r\n\r\nVacation came.  My friends scattered far and wide.  I joined with three\r\nGerman friends and one Frenchman, and we strapped on our knapsacks for a\r\nfoot-journey into Switzerland.  First we went to Freiburg in Baden, and\r\nsaw the old Cathedral, and so on, singing, and stopping to drink, and\r\nmeeting with other students from other universities, and resting in\r\nforests, amid mountains, by roaring streams, and entering cottages and\r\nchatting with girls.  _Hurra_! _frei ist der bursch_!\r\n\r\nOne afternoon we walked sixteen miles through a rain which was like a\r\nwaterfall.  I was so drenched that it was with difficulty I kept my\r\npassport and letter of exchange from being ruined.  When we came out of\r\nthe storm there were _six_ of us!  Another student had, unseen, joined\r\nour party in the rain, and I had never noticed it!\r\n\r\nWe came to a tavern at the foot of the Rigiberg.  My pack was soaked.  One\r\nfriend lent me a shirt, another a pair of drawers, and we wrapped\r\nourselves in sheets from the beds and called for brandy and water hot--a\r\npleasing novelty to the Germans--and so went to bed.  The next day we\r\nascended the Rigi; found many students there; did not see the sun rise in\r\nthe morning, but still a mighty panorama, wondrous fair, and so walked\r\ndown again.  And receiving my carpet-bag at Lucerne, whither I had had\r\nthe precaution to send one, I dressed myself again in clean linen and\r\nwent back to Germany.  I meant to travel more in Switzerland, but it was\r\nvery rainy that year, and, as it proved, I did wisely.\r\n\r\nI returned to Spitz, but his house was full of English, and he informed\r\nme, rather exultantly and foolishly, that he had no room for me, and\r\ncould not tell me where to go, \"every place was full.\"  As I had spent\r\nmoney freely with him I did not like it.  The head-waiter followed me out\r\nand recommended the Black Eagle, kept by Herr Lehr.  There I went, got a\r\ngood room, and for months after dined daily at its _table-d'hote_.  I\r\nsent friends there, and returned to the house with my wife twenty years\r\nlater.  My brother also went there long after, and endeared himself to\r\nall, helping Herr Lehr to plant his vines.  In after years Herr Lehr had\r\nforgotten me, but not my brother.  Lehr's son was a gentlemanly young\r\nfellow, well educated.  He became a captain, and was the first officer\r\nkilled in the Franco-German war.\r\n\r\nVacation passed, and the students returned and lectures were resumed.\r\nThere was a grand _Commers_ or students' supper meeting at which I was\r\npresent; and again the duelling-ground rang with the sound of blades, and\r\nall was merry as before.  Herr Zimmer, the University dancing-master,\r\ngave lessons and cotillion or waltzing-parties thrice a week, and these I\r\nregularly attended.  Those who came to them were the daughters of the\r\nhumbler professors and respectable shopkeepers.  During the previous\r\nsession I had taken lessons from a little old Frenchman, who brought his\r\nfiddle and a pretty daughter twice a week to my room, where, with Ward,\r\nwe formed a class of three.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was a perfect type--fit to be staged without a touch of\r\nchange--of the old _emigre_, who has now vanished, even from among the\r\nFrench.  His bows, his wit--_la grace extra'ordinaire_--the intonations\r\nof his voice, and his vivacity, were beyond the art of any actor now\r\nliving.  There were many more peculiar and marked types of character in\r\nthe last generation than now exist, when Everybody is becoming Everybody\r\nelse with such fearful rapidity.\r\n\r\nThere were four great masked balls held in Heidelberg during the winter,\r\neach corresponding to a special state of society.  That at the Museum or\r\ngreat University Club was patronised by the _elite_ of nobility and the\r\nprofessors and their families.  Then came the _Harmonie_--respectable,\r\nbut not aristocratic.  Then another in a hotel, which was rather more\r\nrowdy than reputable; not really outrageous, yet where the gentlemen\r\nstudents \"whooped it up\" in grand style with congenial grisettes; and,\r\nfinally, there was a fancy ball at the Waldhorn, or some such place, or\r\nseveral of them, over the river, where peasants and students with maids\r\nto match could waltz once round the vast hall for a penny till stopped by\r\na cordon of robust rustics.  We thought it great fun with our partners to\r\nwaltz impetuously and bump with such force against the barrier as to\r\nbreak through, in which case we were not only greatly admired, but got\r\nanother waltz gratis.  We had wild peasant-dancing in abundance, and the\r\nconsumption of wine and beer was something awful.\r\n\r\nOne morning a German student named Gruner, who had been at Jena, came to\r\nmy room with a brilliant proposition.  We should go to Frankfort and hear\r\nJenny Lind sing in her great _role_ of Norma.  I had already heard her\r\nsing in concert in Heidelberg--where, by the way, the students rushed\r\ninto her room as soon as she had left, and tore to strips the bed in\r\nwhich she had slept, and carried them away for souvenirs, to the great\r\namazement of an old Englishman who had just been put into the room.\r\n(_N.B._--I was not in the party.)  I objected that it was getting to the\r\nend of the month, and that I had not money enough for such an outing.  To\r\nwhich he replied, that we could go on to Homburg, and make money enough\r\nat _rouge-et-noir_ to cover all expenses.  This obvious and admirable\r\nmethod of raising funds had not occurred to me, so I agreed to go.\r\n\r\nWe went to Frankfort, and heard the greatly overrated Jenny Lind, and the\r\nnext day proceeded to Hamburg, and at once to the green table.  Here I\r\nlost a little, but Gruner made so much, that on returning to the table I\r\ntook from it a sufficient sum to cover all our expenses, and told him\r\nthat, come what might, it must remain untouched, and gave him the\r\nremainder.  That afternoon I played for five-franc pieces, and at one\r\ntime had both my side-pockets so full that they weighed very heavily.  And\r\nthese again I lost.  Then Gruner lost all his, and came imploring me for\r\nmore, but I would not give him a _kreutzer_.  Matters were beginning to\r\nlook serious.  I had a reserved fund of perhaps fifty napoleons, which I\r\nkept for dire need or accidents.  That evening I observed a man who had\r\ngreat luck, winning twice out of three times.  I watched his play, and as\r\nsoon as he lost I set a napoleon--by which I won enough to clear my\r\nexpenses, and buy me, moreover, a silver-headed cane, a gold watch-chain,\r\nand two Swiss watches.  I may mention by the way, that since that day I\r\nhave never played at anything, save losing a ten-franc piece in after\r\nyears at Wiesbaden.\r\n\r\nThere dined very often at our _table-d'hote_ in the Adler an old German\r\nlady named Helmine von Chezy, who had a reputation as a poetess.  With\r\nher I sometimes conversed.  One day she narrated in full what she\r\ndeclared was the true story of Caspar Hauser.  Unto her Heine had\r\naddressed the epigram--\r\n\r\n   \"Helmine von Chezy,\r\n   Geborene Klencke,\r\n   Ich bitte Sie, geh' Sie\r\n   Mit ihrer Poesie,\r\n   Sonst kriegt Sie die Kranke!\"\r\n\r\n   \"Helmine von Chezy,\r\n   Born Klencke, I pray\r\n   With your pestilent poems\r\n   You'll hasten away.\"\r\n\r\nThere was also an elderly and very pleasant Englishman, with whom I\r\nbecame rather intimate, and who was very kind to me.  This was the well-\r\nknown Captain Medwin, who had known so well Byron, Shelley, Trelawny, and\r\ntheir compeers.  He was full of anecdotes, which I now wish that I had\r\nrecorded.  He introduced me to Lady Caroline de Crespigny, who was then\r\nliving permanently in Heidelberg.  This lady, who was said to be then\r\nfifty years of age, was still so young-looking and beautiful, that I\r\ncannot remember in all my life to have ever seen such an instance of time\r\narrested.  I also made the acquaintance of Professor Creutzer, author of\r\nthe _Symbolik_, a work of vast learning. {156}  And I went to balls, one\r\nat Professor Gervinus's.\r\n\r\nI entered myself with the great Leopold Gmelin for a course of lectures\r\non chemistry, and worked away every morning with the test-tubes at\r\nanalytical chemistry under Professor Posselt, at which I one day nearly\r\npoisoned myself by tasting oxalic acid, which I did not recognise under\r\nits German name of _Kleesaure_.  I read broad and wide in German\r\nliterature, as I think may be found by examining my notes to my\r\ntranslation of Heine's works, and went with Field several times to\r\nFrankfort, to attend the theatre, and otherwise amuse ourselves.  There I\r\nonce made the acquaintance of the very famous comic actor Hasselt.  He\r\nwas a grave, almost melancholy man when off the stage, very fond of\r\narchaeology and antiquities.\r\n\r\nThe winter drew to an end.  I had long felt a deep desire to visit\r\nMunich, to study art, and to investigate fundamentally the wonderful and\r\nmysterious science of AEsthetics, of which I had heard so much.  So I\r\npacked up and paid my bills, and passing through one town where there was\r\nin the hotel where I stopped, the last wolf ever killed in Germany, and\r\nfreshly killed (I believe he has been slain two or three times since),\r\nand at another where I was invited to see a criminal beheaded by the\r\nsword--which sight I missed by over-sleeping myself--I came through\r\nStuttgart, Ulm, and Augsburg to the German Athens.\r\n\r\nI went to the Hotel Maulick, where I stayed a week.  Opposite to me at\r\ntable every day sat the famous Saphir, the great Vienna wit and licensed\r\njoker.  Of course I soon became acquainted with some students, and was\r\nentered at the University, and got the card which exempted me from being\r\narrested by any save the University beadles.  I believe that we even had\r\nour own hangman, but as none of my friends ever had occasion for his\r\nservices I did not inquire.  The same ticket also entitled me to attend\r\nthe opera at half-price, and if it had only included tobacco and beer\r\ngratis, it would have been the means of vast economies.\r\n\r\nI entered myself for a course of lectures by Professor Friedrich Thiersch\r\non AEsthetics.  He it was who had trained Heine to art, and I venture to\r\nsay that in my case the seed fell on good ground.  I took in every\r\nthought.  His system agreed, on the whole, perfectly with that advanced\r\nin after years by Taine, and marvellously well with that set forth in the\r\n\"Essays, Speculative and Suggestive,\" of J. A. Symonds--that is, it was\r\neclectic and deductive from historical periods, and not at all\r\n\"rhapsodical\" or merely subjective.  I bought the best works, such as\r\nKugler's, for guides, and studied hard, and frequented the Pinacothek and\r\nGlyptothek, and I may say really educated myself well in the history of\r\nart and different schools of aesthetics.  My previous reading, travel,\r\nand tastes fitted me in every way to easily master such knowledge.  I\r\nalso followed Becker's course on Schelling, but my heart was not in it,\r\nas it would have been two years before.  The lectures of Professor Henry\r\nand Gmelin and true Science had caused in me a distrust of metaphysics\r\nand psychological systems and theories.  I began to see that they were\r\nall only very ingenious shufflings and combinations and phases of the\r\nsame old cards of Pantheism, which could be made into Theism, Pietism,\r\nAtheism, or Materialism to suit any taste.  I was advancing rapidly to\r\npure science, though Evolution was as yet unknown by the name, albeit the\r\nOkenites and others with their _Natur-philosophie_ were coming closely to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I think it may be truly said that, as regarded deducing man and\r\nall things from a _prima materia_ or protoplasm by means of natural\r\nselection and vast study of differentiation, they were exactly where\r\nDarwin, and Wallace, and Huxley were when we began to know the latter.  I\r\ndo not agree with Max Muller in his very German and very artfully\r\ndisguised and defended theory that the religious idea originated in a\r\nvague sense of the Infinite in the minds of savages; for I believe it\r\nbegan with the bogeys and nightmares of obscure terror, hunger, disease,\r\nand death; but the Professor is quite right in declaring that Evolution\r\nwas first created or developed in the German _Natur-philosophie_, the\r\ntrue beginning of which was with the Italian naturalists, such as Bruno\r\nand De Cusa.  What is to be observed is this, yet few understand it, nor\r\nhas even Symonds cleared the last barrier--that when a Pantheist has got\r\nso far as to conceive an identity between matter and spirit, while on the\r\nother hand a scientific materialist rises to the unity of spirit and\r\nmatter, there is nothing to choose between them.  Only this is true, that\r\nthe English Evolutionists, by abandoning reasoning based on Pantheistic\r\npoetic bases, as in Schelling's case, or purely logical, as in Hegel's,\r\nand by proceeding on plainly prosaic, merely material, simply scientific\r\ngrounds after the example of Bacon, swept away so much rubbish that\r\npeople no longer recognised the old temple of Truth, and really thought\r\nit was a brand new workshop or laboratory.  But I can remember very\r\ndistinctly that to me Evolution did _not_ come as if I had received a new\r\nsoul, or even a new body, but had merely had a bath, and put on new\r\ngarments.  And as I became an English Evolutionist in due time, I had\r\nthis great advantage, that by beginning so young I succeeded in doing\r\nvery thoroughly what Symonds and Maudsley and many more clearly\r\nunderstand is _most_ difficult--that is, not merely to accept the truth,\r\nbut to get rid of the old _associations_ of the puzzle of a difference\r\nbetween spirit and matter, which thing caused even the former to muddle\r\nabout \"God,\" and express disgust at \"Materialism,\" and declare that there\r\nis \"an insoluble problem,\" which is all in flat contradiction to pure\r\nEvolution, which does not meddle with \"the Unknowable.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a Jewish professor named Karl Friedrich Neumann, who was about\r\nas many-sided a man as could be found even in a German university.  He\r\nwas a great Chinese scholar--had been in China, and also read on\r\nmathematics and modern history.  I attended these lectures (not the\r\nmathematics) and liked them: so we became acquainted.  I found that he\r\nhad written a very interesting little work on the visit recorded in the\r\nChinese annals of certain Buddhist monks to Fusang--probably Mexico--in\r\nthe fifth century.  I proposed to translate it, and did so, he making\r\nemendations and adding fresh matter to the English version.\r\n\r\nProfessor Neumann was a vigorous reader, but he soon found that I was of\r\nthe same kind.  One day he lent me a large work on some Indian subject,\r\nand the next I brought it back.  He said that I could not have read it in\r\nthe time.  I begged him to examine me on it, which he did, and expressed\r\nhis amazement, for he declared that he had never met with anything like\r\nit in all his life.  This from him was praise indeed.  Long after, in\r\nAmerica, George Boker in closer fashion tested me on this without my\r\nknowing it, and published the result in an article.\r\n\r\nI became acquainted with a learned writer on art named Foerster, who had\r\nmarried a daughter of Jean Paul Richter, and dined once or twice at his\r\nhouse.  I also saw him twenty years later in Munich.  George Ward came in\r\nfrom Berlin to stay some weeks in Munich.  I saw Taglioni several times\r\nat the opera, but did not make her acquaintance till 1870.  The great,\r\ntremendous celebrity at that time in Munich was also an opera-dancer,\r\nthough not on the stage.  This was Lola Montez, the King's last\r\nfavourite.  He had had all his mistresses painted, one by one, and the\r\ngallery was open to the public.  Lola's was the last, and there was a\r\nblank space still left _for a few more_.  I thought that about twenty-\r\nfive would complete the collection.\r\n\r\nLola Montez had a small palace, and was raised to be the Countess of\r\nLandsfeldt, but this was not enough.  She wished to run the whole kingdom\r\nand government, and kick out the Jesuits, and kick up the devil,\r\ngenerally speaking.  But the Jesuits and the mob were too much for her.  I\r\nknew her very well in later years in America, when she deeply regretted\r\nthat I had not called on her in Munich.  I must have had a great moral\r\ninfluence on her, for, so far as I am aware, I am the only friend whom\r\nshe ever had at whom she never threw a plate or book, or attacked with a\r\ndagger, poker, broom, chair, or other deadly weapon.  We were both born\r\nat the same time in the same year, and I find by the rules of sorcery\r\nthat she is the first person who will meet me when I go to heaven.  I\r\nalways had a great and strange respect for her singular talents; there\r\nwere very few indeed, if any there were, who really knew the depths of\r\nthat wild Irish soul.  Men generally were madly fascinated with her, then\r\nas suddenly disenchanted, and then detracted from her in every way.\r\n\r\nThere were many adventuresses in later years who passed themselves about\r\nthe world for Lola Montez.  I have met with two friends, whom I am sure\r\nwere honest gentlemen, who told me they had known her intimately.  Both\r\ndescribed her as a large, powerful, or robust woman.  Lola was in reality\r\nvery small, pale, and thin, or _frele_, with beautiful blue eyes and\r\ncurly black hair.  She was a typical beauty, with a face full of\r\ncharacter, and a person of remarkably great and varied reading.  One of\r\nher most intimate friends was wont to tell her that she and I had many\r\nvery strange characteristics in common, which we shared with no one else,\r\nwhile we differed utterly in other respects.  It was very like both of\r\nus, for Lola, when defending the existence of the soul against an\r\natheist, to tumble over a great trunk of books of the most varied kind,\r\ntill she came to an old vellum-bound copy of Apuleius, and proceed to\r\nestablish her views according to his subtle Neo-Platonism.  But she\r\nromanced and embroidered so much in conversation that she did not get\r\ncredit for what she really knew.\r\n\r\nI once met with a literary man in New York who told me he had long\r\ndesired to make my acquaintance, because he had heard her praise me so\r\nimmeasurably beyond anybody else she had ever known, that he wanted to\r\nsee what manner of man I could be.  I heard the same from another, in\r\nanother place long after.  Once she proposed to me to make a bolt with\r\nher to Europe, which I declined.  The secret of my influence was that I\r\nalways treated her with respect, and never made love or flirted.\r\n\r\nAn intimate of both of us who was present when this friendly proposal was\r\nmade remarked with some astonishment, \"But, Madame, by what means can you\r\ntwo _live_?\"  \"Oh,\" replied Lola innocently and confidingly, \"people like\r\nus\" (or \"who know as much as we\") \"can get a living anywhere.\"  And she\r\nrolled us each a cigarette, with one for herself.  I could tell a number\r\nof amusing tales of this Queen of Bohemia, but Space, the Kantean god,\r\nforbids me more.  But I may say that I never had more really congenial\r\nand wide-embracing conversations with any human being in my life than\r\nwith Her Majesty.  There was certainly no topic, within my range, at\r\nleast, on which she could not converse with some substance of personal\r\nexperience and reading.  She had a mania for meeting and knowing all\r\nkinds of peculiar people.\r\n\r\nI lived in the main street near the Karlsthor, opposite a tavern called\r\nthe Ober-Pollinger, which was a mediaeval tavern in those days.  My\r\nlandlady was a nice old soul, and she had two daughters, one of whom was\r\na beauty, and as gentle and Germanly good as a girl could be.  Her face\r\nstill lives in a great picture by a great artist.  We lived on the third\r\nfloor; on the ground was a shop, in which cutlery and some fireworks were\r\nsold.  It befell that George Ward and I were very early in the morning\r\nsitting on a bench before the Ober-Pollinger, waiting for a stage-coach,\r\nwhich would take us to some place out of town; when bang! bang! crack! I\r\nheard a noise in the firework shop, and saw explosions puffing smoke out\r\nof the bursting windows.  Great God! the front shop was on fire; it was\r\nfull of fireworks, such as rockets and crackers, and I knew there was a\r\nbarrel of gunpowder in the back-shop!  I had found it out a few days\r\nbefore, when I went there to buy some for my pistols.  And the family\r\nwere asleep.  In an instant I tore across the street, rushed screaming\r\nupstairs, roused them all out of bed, howling, \"It burns!--there's\r\ngunpowder!\"  Yet, hurried as I was, I caught up a small hand-bag, which\r\ncontained my money, as I got the girls and their mother downstairs.  I\r\nwas just in time to see a gigantic butcher burst open the two-inch door\r\nwith an axe, and roll out the barrel containing two hundred pounds of\r\ngunpowder, as the flames were licking it.  I saw them distinctly.\r\n\r\nIt was the awful row which I made which had brought the people out\r\nbetimes, including the butcher and his axe.  But for that, there would\r\nhave been a fearful blow-up.  But the butcher showed himself a man of\r\ngold on this occasion, for he it was who really saved us all.  A day or\r\ntwo after, when I was jesting about myself as a knightly rescuer of\r\nforlorn damsels, in reply to some remark on the event, George Ward called\r\nme to order.  There was, as he kindly said, too much that he respected in\r\nthat event to make fun of it.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ward is deeply impressed on my memory.  He was a sedate young\r\nfellow, with a gift of dry humour, now and then expressed in quaint\r\nremarks, a gentleman in every instinct, much given to reading and\r\nreflecting.  When he said anything, he meant it, and this remark of his\r\nstruck me more than the event itself had done.\r\n\r\nAnd to think that I quite forgot, in narrating my Princeton experiences,\r\nto tell of something very much like this incident.  It was in my last\r\nyear, and my landlady had just moved into a new house, when, owing to\r\nsome defect in the building, it caught fire, but was luckily saved after\r\nit had received some damage.  I awoke in the night, flames bursting into\r\nmy room, and much smoke.  It happened that the day before a friend in\r\nAlabama had sent me eleven hundred dollars wherewith to pay for him\r\ncertain debts.  My first thought was for this money, so I hurried to get\r\nthe key of the secretary in which it was--keys never can be found in a\r\nhurry--and when found, I could not find the right one in the bunch.  And\r\nthen it stuck in the lock and would not open it, till finally I succeeded\r\nand got the money out.  And then, not finding myself quite dead, I in a\r\nhurry turned the contents of three drawers in my bureau and my linen on\r\nto the bed, threw on it my coats and trousers, tied the four corners of a\r\nsheet together in one bundle, caught up my boots, fencing-foils, &c., to\r\nmake another, and so rescued all I had.  I verily believe I did it all in\r\none minute.  That day the President, old Dr. Carnahan, when I plead \"not\r\nprepared\" for failing at recitation, excused me with a grim smile.  I had\r\nreally that time some excuse for it.  During the Munich incident I\r\nthought of the sheets.  But I had gunpowder and two girls to look after\r\nin the latter place, and time and tide--or gunpowder and girls--wait for\r\nno man.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with study and art and friends, and much terrible drinking of\r\nbeer and smoking of Varinas-Kanaster, and roaming at times in gay\r\ngreenwoods with pretty maids alway, and music and dancing, the Munich\r\nsemester came to an end.  I proposed to travel with an English friend\r\nnamed Pottinger to Vienna, and thence by some adventurous route or other\r\nthrough Germany to Paris; which was a great deal more to undertake in\r\nthose days than it now is, entailing several hundred per cent. more pain\r\nand sorrow, fasting, want of sleep and washing, than any man would\r\nencounter in these days in going round the world and achieving _la grande\r\nroute_; or the common European tour, to boot.  For it befell me ere I\r\nreached my journey's end to pass eighteen nights in one month in Eilwagen\r\nor waggons, the latter being sometimes without springs.  And once or\r\ntwice or thrice I was so utterly worn and wearied that I slept all night,\r\nthough I was so tossed about that I awoke in the morning literally\r\nbruised from head to foot, with my chimney-pot hat under my feet; which\r\nwas worse than even a forced march on short commons--as I found in after\r\nyears--or driving in a Russian _telega_, or jackassing in Egypt, or any\r\nother of the trifles over which pampered tourists make such heart-rending\r\nhowls now-a-days.\r\n\r\nSo we went to Prague, and thence to Vienna, which, in the year 1847, was\r\na very different place indeed to what it is at present; for an unbounded\r\ngaiety and an air of reckless festivity was apparent then all the time to\r\neverybody everywhere.  Under it all lurked and rankled abuses, municipal,\r\nsocial, and political, such as would in 1893 be deemed incredible if not\r\nunnatural (as may be read in a clever novel called _Die schone\r\nWienerinn_), but on the surface all was brilliant foam and sunshine and\r\nlaughing sirens.  What new thing Strauss would play in the evening was\r\nthe great event of the day.  I saw and heard the great Johann\r\nStrauss--this was the grandfather--and in after years his son, and the\r\n_schone Edie_ his grandson.  Everywhere one heard music, and the Prater\r\nwas a gay and festive paradise indeed.  There was no business; the town\r\nlived on the Austrian, Hungarian, Bohemian, Russian, and other nobility,\r\nwho in those days were extravagant and ostentatious to a degree now\r\nundreamed of, and on strangers.  As for free and easy licentiousness,\r\nParis was a trifle to it, and the police had strict orders to encourage\r\neverything of the kind; the result being that the seventh commandment in\r\nall its phases was treated like pie-crust, as a thing made to be broken,\r\nthe oftener the better.  Even on our first arriving at our hotel, our\r\ngood-natured landlord, moved by the principle that it was not good for a\r\nyoung man to be alone, informed us that if we wished to have damsels in\r\nour rooms no objection would be interposed.  \"Why not?\" he said; \"this is\r\nnot a church\"; the obvious inference being that to a Viennese every place\r\nnot a church must necessarily be a temple to Venus.  And every Wiener,\r\nwhen spoken to, roared with laughter; and there were minstrels in the\r\nstreets, and musicians in every dining-place and cafe, and great ringing\r\nof bells in chimes, and 'twas merry in hall when beards wagged all, and\r\n\"the world went very well in those days.\"  Vienna is a far finer town\r\nnow, but it is a Quaker meeting-house compared to what it was for gaiety\r\nforty years ago.\r\n\r\nThis change of life and manners has spread, and will continue to spread,\r\nall over the world.  In feudal times the people were kept quiet by means\r\nof holidays, carnivals, processions, fairs, fairy-tales, treats, and\r\nindulgences; even the common childish instinct for gay dress and\r\npicturesqueness of appearance was encouraged, and at high tides everybody\r\nwas fed and given to drink: so that if the poor toiled and fasted and\r\nprayed, it might be for months, they had their joyous revellings to\r\nanticipate, when there were free tables even for strangers.  In those\r\ndays--\r\n\r\n   \"A Christmas banquet oft would cheer\r\n   A poor man's heart for half the year.\"\r\n\r\nThis Middle Age lasted effectively until the epoch of the Revolution and\r\nrailroads, or, to fix a date, till about 1848.  And then all at once, as\r\nat a breath, it all disappeared, and now lives, so to speak, only in\r\nholes and corners.  For as soon as railroads came, factories sprang up\r\nand Capital began to employ Labour, and Labour to plot and combine\r\nagainst Capital; and what with scientific inventions and a sudden\r\nstimulus to labour, and newspapers, the multitude got beyond fancy\r\ndresses and the being amused to keep them quiet like children, and so the\r\n_juventus mundi_ passed away.  \"It is a perfect _shame_!\" say the dear\r\nyoung lady tourists, \"that the peasantry no longer wear their beautiful\r\ndresses; they ought to be _obliged_ to keep them up.\"  \"But how would\r\n_you_ like, my dear, if you were of the lower orders, to wear a dress\r\nwhich proclaimed it?\"  Here the conversation ceaseth, for it becomes too\r\ndeep for the lady tourist to follow.\r\n\r\nHow it was we wandered I do not distinctly remember, but having visited\r\nNuremberg, Prague, and Dresden, we went to Breslau, where a fancy seized\r\nus to go to Cracow.  True, we had not a special _vise_ from a Russian\r\nminister to enter the Muscovite dominions, but the police at Breslau, who\r\n(as I was afterwards told) loved to make trouble for those on the\r\nfrontier, bade us be of good cheer and cheek it out, neither to be afraid\r\nof any man, and to go ahead bravely.  Which we did.\r\n\r\nThere was a sweet scene at the frontier station on the Polish-Russian\r\nline at about three o'clock in the morning, when the grim and insolent\r\nofficials discovered that our passports had only the police _vise_ from\r\nBreslau!  I was asked why I had not in my native country secured the\r\n_vise_ of a Russian minister; to which I replied that in America the very\r\nexistence of such a country as Russia was utterly unknown, and that I\r\nmyself was astonished to find that Russians knew what passports were.\r\nAlso that I always supposed that foreigners conferred a great benefit on\r\na country by spending their money in it; but that if I could not be\r\nadmitted, that was an end of it; it was a matter of very trifling\r\nconsequence, indeed, for we really did not care twopence whether we saw\r\nRussia or not; a country more or less made very little difference to such\r\ntravellers as we were.\r\n\r\nCheek is a fine thing in its way, and on this occasion I developed enough\r\nbrass to make a pan, and enough \"sass\" to fill it; but all in vain.  When\r\nI visited the Muscovite realm in after years I was more kindly received.\r\nOn this occasion we were closely searched and re-searched, although we\r\nwere not allowed to go on into Russia!  Every square inch of everything\r\nwas examined as with a microscope--even the small scraps of newspaper in\r\nwhich soap or such trifles were wrapped were examined, a note made as to\r\neach, and all put under paper-weights; and whatever was suspected--as,\r\nfor instance, books or pamphlets--was confiscated, although, as I said,\r\nwe were turned back!  And this robbery accomplished, we were informed\r\nthat the stage-coach, or rather rough post-waggon, in which we came,\r\nwould return at five o'clock P.M., and that we could in it go back to\r\nDresden, and might pass the time till then on a bench outside the\r\nbuilding--reflecting on our sins!  I had truly some papers about me which\r\nI did not care to have examined, but these were in my cravat, and even\r\nRussian ingenuity had not at that time got beyond picking pockets and\r\nfeeling the linings of coats.  It has since been suggested to me by\r\nsomething which I read that I was under suspicion.  I had in Munich aided\r\na Swiss student who was under police surveillance for political\r\nintriguing to escape, by lending him money to get away.  It is probable\r\nthat for this my passport was marked in a peculiar manner.  My companion,\r\nPottinger, was not much searched; all suspicion seemed to fall on me.\r\n\r\nThe stage went on, and Pottinger and I sat on the bench in a mild drizzle\r\nat half-past three in the morning, with as miserable a country round\r\nabout as mortal man ever beheld.  By-and-bye one of the subs., a poor\r\nPole, moved by compassion and the hope of reward, cautiously invited us\r\nto come into his den.  He spoke a very little German and a little Latin\r\n(Pottinger was an Oxford man, and knew several heavy classics, Greek and\r\nLatin, perfectly by heart).  The Pole had a fire, and we began to\r\nconverse.  He had heard of America, and that Polish exiles had been well\r\ntreated there.  I assured him that Poles were admired and cherished among\r\nus like pet lambs among children, and the adored of the adored.  Then I\r\nspoke of Russian oppression, and the Pole, in utmost secrecy, produced a\r\nsabre which had been borne under Kosciusko, and showed us a silver\r\ncoin--utterly prohibited--which had been struck during the brief period\r\nof the Polish revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Pole began to prepare _his_ coffee--for one.  I saw that something\r\nmust be done to increase the number of cups.  He took up his book of\r\nprayers and asked of what religion we were.  Of Pottinger I said\r\ncontemptuously, \"He is nothing but a heretic,\" but that as for myself, I\r\nhad for some time felt a great inclination towards the _Panna_--Holy\r\nVirgin--and that it would afford me great pleasure to conform to the\r\nPolish Catholic Church, but that unfortunately I did not understand the\r\nlanguage.  To which he replied, that if _he_ were to read the morning\r\nservice in Polish and I would repeat it word by word, that the _Panna_\r\nwould count it to my credit just as if I had.  And as I was praying in\r\ngood earnest for a breakfast, I trust that it was accepted.  Down on our\r\nknees we went and began our orisons.\r\n\r\n\"Leland! you --- humbug!\" exclaimed Pottinger.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, you infernal heretic, and don't disturb Christians at their\r\ndevotions!\" was my devout reply.  So, prayers concluded, there _was_\r\ncoffee and rolls for three.  And so in due time the coach returned.  I\r\nrewarded our host with a thaler, and we returned to Breslau, of which\r\nplace I noted that the natives never ate anything but sweet cakes for\r\ntheir first morning meal.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at Gorlitz, where I asked a woman standing in the half-doorway\r\nof the house of Jacob Bohme if that was his house.  But she had never\r\nheard of such a man!\r\n\r\nDresden we thoroughly explored, and were at Leipzig during the great\r\nannual fair.  These fairs, in those days, were sights to behold.  Now\r\nthey are succeeded by stupendous Expositions, which are far finer and\r\ninconceivably greater, yet which to me lack that kind of gypsy,\r\nside-show, droll, old-fashioned attraction of the ancient gatherings,\r\neven as Barnum's Colossal Moral Show of half-a-dozen circuses at once and\r\ntwenty-five elephants does not _amuse_ anybody as the old clown in the\r\nring and one elephant did of yore.\r\n\r\nThence to Berlin, where we were received with joy by the American\r\nstudents, who knew all about one another all over Germany.  I very much\r\nenjoyed the great art gallery, and the conversation of those who, like\r\nmyself, followed lectures on AEsthetics and the history of art.  Thence\r\nto Magdeburg and Hanover, Dusseldorf--to cut it short, Holland and the\r\nchief cities in Belgium.\r\n\r\nI noted one little change of custom in Berlin.  In South Germany it was a\r\ncommon custom for students, when calling on a friend, to bring and leave\r\ngenerally a small bouquet.  When I did this in Berlin my friends were\r\nastonished at it.  This was an old Italian custom, as we may read in the\r\nbeautiful One Hundred and Fifty _Brindisi_ or Toasts of Minto.\r\n\r\n   \"Porto a voi un fior novello,\r\n   Ed, oh come vago e bello!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1847 even a very respectable hotel in Holland was in any city quite\r\nlike one of two centuries before.  You entered a long antiquely-brown\r\nroom, traversed full length by a table.  Before every chair was placed a\r\nlittle metallic dish with hot coals, and a churchwarden pipe was brought\r\nto every visitor at once without awaiting orders.  The stolid, literal,\r\nmechanical action of all the people's minds was then _wonderful_.  An\r\naverage German peasant was a genius compared to these fresh, rosy-fair,\r\nwell-clad Hollanders.  It was to me a new phase of human happiness in\r\nimbecility, or rather in undisturbed routine; for it is written that no\r\nbird can fly like a bullet and doze or sleep sweetly at the same time.\r\nYet, as from the Huns, the most hideous wretches in the world, there\r\narose by intermixture the Hungarians, who are perhaps the handsomest, so\r\nfrom the Knickerbocker Dutch sprang the wide-awake New Yorkers!  The\r\ngalleries in Holland and Belgium were to me joys unutterable and as the\r\nglory of life itself.  Munich and Thiersch still inspired me; I seemed to\r\nhave found a destiny in aesthetics or art, or what had been wanting in\r\nPrinceton; that is, how the beautiful entered into life and was developed\r\nin history and made itself felt in all that was worth anything at all.\r\nModern English writers on this subject--with exceptions like that of J.\r\nA. Symonds, whose Essays I cannot commend too highly--are in the same\r\nrelation to its grand truth and higher inspiration as Emerson and Carlyle\r\nto Pantheism in its mightiest early forms.  For several years the actual\r\nmastery of aesthetics gave me great comfort, and advanced me marvellously\r\nin thought to wider and far higher regions.\r\n\r\nI forget where I parted with Pottinger; all that I can remember was, that\r\nearly in November I arrived alone in Paris, going to some small hotel or\r\nother, and that as all the fatigues of the past many weeks of weary\r\ntravel seemed to come upon me all at once, I went to bed, and never left\r\nthe house till four o'clock P.M. the next day.  On the next I found my\r\nway into the Latin Quarter, and secured a _not_ very superior room in the\r\nPlace Saint-Michel, near the Ecole de Medecine, to which I moved my\r\nluggage.\r\n\r\nI was very much astonished, while sitting alone and rather blue and\r\novercast in my room, at the sudden entrance of a second cousin of mine\r\nnamed Frank Fisher, who was studying medicine in Paris.  He had by some\r\nodd chance seen my name registered in the newspapers as having arrived at\r\nthe hotel, and lost no time in looking me up.  He lived on the other side\r\nof the Seine in the Boule Rouge, near the Rue Helder, a famous happy\r\nhunting-ground for _les biches_--I mean kids or the very dear.  I must go\r\nforthwith to his quarters and dine, which I did, and so my introduction\r\nto Paris was fairly begun.\r\n\r\nI attended at the College Louis le Grand, and at the Sorbonne, all or any\r\nlectures by everybody, including a very dull series on German literature\r\nby Philarete Chasles.  I read books.  _Inter alia_, I went through\r\nDante's \"Inferno\" in Italian aided by Rivarol's translation, of which I\r\npossessed the _very copy_ stamped with the royal arms, and containing the\r\nauthor's autograph, which had been presented to the King.  I picked it up\r\non the Quai for a franc, for which sum I also obtained a first edition of\r\n_Melusine_, which Mr. Andrew Lang has described as such a delightful\r\nrarity.  And I also ran a great deal about town.  I saw Rachel, and\r\nFrederic Lemaitre, and Mlle. Dejazet, and many more at the great\r\ntheatres, and attended assiduously at Bobinot's, which was a very small\r\ntheatre in the Quartier Latin, frequented entirely by students and\r\ngrisettes.  I went to many a ball, both great and small, including the\r\nmasked ones of the Grand Opera, and other theatres, at which there was\r\ndissipation and diablerie enough to satisfy the most ardent imagination,\r\nending with the _grande ronde infernale_.  I made many acquaintances, and\r\nif they were not by any means all highly respectable, they were at least\r\ngenerally very singular or notorious.  One day I would dine at a place\r\noutside the Barrier, where we had a plain but fairly good dinner for a\r\nfranc, _vin compris_, and where the honoured guest at the head of the\r\ntable was the _chef des claqueurs_ or head of the paid applauders at all\r\nthe theatres.  Then it would be at a private _table-d'hote_ of\r\n_lorettes_, where there was after dinner a little private card-playing.  I\r\nheard afterwards that two or three unprincipled gamblers found their way\r\ninto this nest of poor little innocents and swindled them out of all\r\ntheir money.  When I was well in funds I would dine at Magny's, where, in\r\nthose days, one could get such a dinner for ten francs as fifty would not\r\nnow purchase.  When _au sec_, I fed at Flictoteau's--we called him\r\n_l'empoisonneur_--where hundreds of students got a meal of three courses\r\nwith half a bottle of ordinaire, and not so bad either, for thirty sous.\r\n\r\nIt happened one night at Bobinot's that I sat in the front row of the\r\nstage-box, and by me a very pretty, modest, and respectable young girl,\r\nwith her elder relations or friends.  How it happened I do not know, but\r\nthey all went out, leaving the young lady by me, and I did not speak to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhich \"point\" was at once seized by the house.  The pit, as if moved by\r\none diabolical inspiration, began to roar, \"_Il l'embrassera_!\" (He will\r\nkiss her), to which the gallery replied, \"_Il ne l'embrassera pas_.\"\r\n\r\nSo they kept it up and down alternately like see-sawing, to an\r\nintonation; and be it remarked, by the way, that in French such a\r\nmonotonous bore is known as a _scie_ or saw, as may be read in my romance\r\nin the French tongue entitled _Le Lutin du Chateau_, which was, I regret\r\nto say, refused by Hachette the publisher on account of its freedom from\r\nstrait-laced, blue-nosed, Puritanical conventionalism, albeit he praised\r\nits literary merit and style, as did sundry other French scholars, if I\r\nmay say it--who should not!\r\n\r\nI saw that something must be done; so, rising, I waved my glove, and\r\nthere was dead silence.  Then I began at the top of my voice, in\r\nimpassioned style in German, an address about matters and things in\r\ngeneral, intermingled with insane quotations from Latin, Slavonian,\r\nanything.  A change came o'er the spirit of the dream of my auditors,\r\ntill at last they \"took,\" and gave me three cheers.  I had _sold_ the\r\nhouse!\r\n\r\nThere was in the Rue de la Harpe a house called the Hotel de Luxembourg.\r\nIt was the fragment of a very old palace which had borne that name.  It\r\nhad still a magnificent Renaissance staircase, which bore witness to its\r\nformer glory.  Washington Irving, in one of his earlier tales, describes\r\nthis very house and the rooms which I occupied in it so accurately, that\r\nI think he must have dwelt there.  He tells that a student once, during\r\nthe Revolution, finding a young lady in the street, took her home with\r\nhim to that house.  She had a black ribbon round her neck.  He twitched\r\nit away, when--off fell her head.  She had been guillotined, and revived\r\nby sorcery.\r\n\r\nI soon removed to this house, where I had two very good-sized rooms.  In\r\nthe same establishment dwelt a small actress or two, and divers students,\r\nor men who were extremely busy all the winter in plotting a revolution.\r\nIt was considered as a nest of rather doubtful and desperate characters,\r\nand an American _carabin_ or student of medicine told me of another who\r\nhad fled from the establishment after a few days' experience, \"for fear\r\nlest he should have his throat cut.\"  But this was very silly, for none\r\nof us would have cut anybody's throat for any consideration.  Some time\r\nago I read the \"Memoirs of Claude,\" who was the head of police in Paris\r\nduring my time, and I was quite startled to find how many of the\r\nnotorieties chronicled in his experiences had been known to me\r\npersonally.  As, for instance, Madame Marie Farcey, who he declares had a\r\nheart of gold, and with whom I had many a curious conversation.  She was\r\na handsome, very ladylike, suave sort of a person, who was never known to\r\nhave an intrigue with any man, but who was \"far and away\" at the very\r\nhead of all the immorality in Paris, as is well known to everybody who\r\nwas deeply about town in the Forties.  Claude himself I never knew, and\r\nit was to his possible great loss; for there came a time when I could,\r\nhad I chosen, have given him information which would have kept him in\r\noffice and Louis Philippe on the throne, and turned the whole course of\r\nthe events of 1848, as I will now clearly and undeniably prove.\r\n\r\nI did not live in the Hotel de Luxembourg for nothing, and I knew what\r\nwas going on, and what was coming, and that there was to be the devil to\r\npay.  Claude tells us in his \"Memoirs\" that the revolution of February 24\r\ntook him so much by surprise that he had only three hours' previous\r\nnotice of it, and really not time to remove his office furniture.  Now,\r\n_one month_ before it burst out I wrote home to my brother that we were\r\nto have a revolution on the 24th of February, and that it would certainly\r\nsucceed.  Those who would learn all the true causes and reasons of this\r\nmay find them in my forthcoming translation of \"Heine's Letters from\r\nParis,\" with my notes.  The police of Paris were very clever, but the\r\nwhole organisation was in so few hands, and we managed so well, that they\r\nnever found us out.  It was beyond all question the neatest, completest,\r\nand cheapest revolution ever executed.  Lamartine himself was not allowed\r\nto know anything about it till he was wanted for President.  And all over\r\nthe Latin Quarter, on our side of the river, in cafes and balls and in\r\nshops, and talking to everybody, went the mysterious dwellers of the\r\nHotel de Luxembourg, sounding public opinion and gathering signs and\r\nomens, and making recruits and laying trains, which, when fired, caused\r\nexplosions all over Europe, and sounds which still live in history.  And\r\nall the work was duly reported at head-quarters.  The great secret of the\r\nsuccess of the revolution was that it was in the hands of so few persons,\r\nwho were all absolutely secret and trustworthy.  If there had been a few\r\nmore, the police would have found us out to a certainty.  One who was\r\nsuspected was \"squared.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the ball opened.  There was the great banquet, and the muttering\r\nstorm, and angry mobs, and small _emeutes_.  There is a mere alley--I\r\nforget its name--on the right bank, which runs down to the Seine, in\r\nwhich it is said that every Paris revolution has broken out.  Standing at\r\nits entrance, I saw three or four shots fired and dark forms with guns\r\nmoving in the alley, and then came General Changarnier with his cavalry\r\nand made a charge, before which I fled.  I had to dodge more than one of\r\nthese charges during the day.  Before dark the rioting was general, and\r\nbarricades were going up.  The great storm-bell of Notre Dame rung all\r\nnight long.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I rose, and telling Leonard Field, who lived in the same\r\nhotel with me, that I was going to work in earnest, loaded a pair of\r\nduelling-pistols, tied a sash round my waist _en revolutionnaire_, and\r\nwith him went forth to business.  First I went to the Cafe Rotonde, hard\r\nby, and got my breakfast.  Then I sallied forth, and found in the Rue de\r\nla Harpe a gang of fifty insurgents, who had arms and a crowbar, but who\r\nwanted a leader.  Seeing that I was one of them, one said to me, \"Sir,\r\nwhere shall we make a barricade?\"  I replied that there was one already\r\nto the right and another farther down, but that a third close at hand was\r\nopen.  Without a word they handed me the crowbar, and I prized up the\r\nstones out of the pavement, while they undertook the harder work of\r\npiling them up.  In a few minutes we had a solid wall eight feet high.\r\nField had on light kid gloves, which formed an amusing contrast to his\r\noccupation.  Then remembering that there was a defenceless spot somewhere\r\nelse, I marched my troop thither, and built another barricade--all in\r\ngrim earnest without talking.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that on the previous day I had witnessed a marvellously\r\ndramatic scene in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, by the market-house.  There\r\nwas across it an immense barricade, made of literally everything--old\r\nbeds, waggons, stones, and rubbish--and it was guarded by a dense crowd\r\nof insurgents, armed or unarmed, of whom I was one.  All around were at\r\nleast three thousand people singing the _Marseillaise_ and the _Chant des\r\nGirondins_.  There was a charge of infantry, a discharge of muskets, and\r\nfifteen fell dead, some almost touching me, while the mob around never\r\nceased their singing, and the sounds of that tremendous and terrible\r\nchorus mingled with the dying groans and cries of the victims and the\r\ngreat roar of the bell of Notre Dame.  It was like a scene in the opera.\r\nThis very barricade has been described by Victor Hugo in detail, but not\r\nall which took place there, the whole scene being, in fact, far more\r\ndramatic or picturesque than he supposed it to have been.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be predestined that I should see every great event in that\r\ndrama, from the charge of Changarnier down to the very end, and I hereby\r\ndeclare that on my honour I set forth exactly what I saw with my own\r\neyes, without a shade of colour off the truth.\r\n\r\nThere was a garcon named Edouard, who always waited on me in the Cafe\r\nRotonde.  While I was working for life at my second barricade, he came\r\nout holding a napkin, and examining my labour critically, waved it,\r\nexclaimed approvingly, \"_Tres bien_, _Citoyen Charles_--_tres bien_!\"  It\r\nwas his little joke for some days after to call me Citoyen Charles.\r\n\r\nReturning down the Rue de la Harpe before our house my landlady exclaimed\r\nto me in alarm, \"Hide your pistols! there is a _mouchard_ (spy of the\r\npolice) following you.\"  I believe that I, my blood being up, said\r\nsomething to the effect that if she would point him out I would shoot him\r\nforthwith, but the _mouchard_ had vanished.  We had all got into cool\r\nearnestness by that time as regards shooting, having been in it\r\nconstantly for three days.\r\n\r\nOver the barricade came sprawling a tall ungainly red-haired Yankee, a\r\nstudent of medicine, whom I had met before, and who began to question me\r\nas to what I was doing.  To which I replied, \"What the devil do you want\r\nhere, anyhow?\" not being in a mood to be trifled with.  To which he\r\nreplied, \"Nawthin', only a kinder lookin' reound.  But what on airth--\"\r\n\"But are you for us, or against?\" I cried.  \"Wall, I ain't on no side.\"\r\n\"See here!\" I cried in a rage; \"those who are not for us are against us.\r\nAny one of those fellows you see round here would shoot you at once if I\r\ntold him to, and if you don't clear out in double quick time, by God I\r\nwill!\"  And at this he made himself scarce forthwith, \"nor does he come\r\nagain into this story.\"\r\n\r\nThen I went down the street, and as a large supply of ammunition came to\r\nus from our friends, with the aid of a student of the Ecole\r\nPolytechnique, I distributed it to the mob.  I had principally boxes of\r\npercussion-caps to give.  I mention this because that young man has gone\r\ninto history for it, and I have as good a right to a share in this\r\nextremely small exploit as he.  Besides, though not wounded by the foe, I\r\ngot a bad cut on my hand from a sharp paving-stone, and its scar lasted\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nI had that day many a chance to knock over a _piou-piou_ or shoot a\r\nsoldier, as Field said, but I must confess that I felt an invincible\r\nrepugnance to do so.  The poor devils were, after all, only fighting\r\nunwillingly against us, and I well knew that unless they came over to our\r\nside all would be up with us.  Therefore it was our policy to spare them\r\nas much as possible.  I owe it to Field to state that through all the\r\nstirring scenes of the Revolution he displayed great calmness and\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nAll at once we heard a terrible outcry down the street.  There was a\r\ntremendous massing of soldiers there, and to defend that barricade meant\r\ndeath to all defenders.  I confess that I hesitated _one instant_, and\r\nthan rushed headlong to join the fight.  Merciful God! the troops had\r\nfraternised with us, and they were handing over their muskets to the mob,\r\nwho were firing them in the air.\r\n\r\nThe scene was terribly moving.  My men, who a minute before had expected\r\nto be shot, rushed up, embraced and kissed the soldiers, wept like\r\nchildren--in short, everybody kissed and embraced everybody else, and all\r\nmy warriors got guns, and therewith I dismissed them, for I knew that the\r\nwar was now about at an end.\r\n\r\nThere was a German-French student named Lenoir, and he, with Field and I,\r\nhearing that there was sharp work at the Tuileries, started thither in\r\nhaste.  And truly enough, when we got there, the very devil was loose,\r\nwith guns firing and the guard-house all in a blaze.  The door was burst\r\nopen, and Field and I were among the very first who entered.  We behaved\r\nvery well, and did not steal anything.  I remember that there was a great\r\npile of plate and jewellery soon laid by the door.\r\n\r\nI went into the throne-room.  There was a great silver inkstand on the\r\ntable, paper and pens, and we wrote, \"Respect Property!\"  \"Liberty for\r\nItaly and Hungary!\" and hung the papers up around the room.  I wrote one\r\nor two myself, and _touched_ the inkstand for luck, in case I should ever\r\nwrite about the event.\r\n\r\nIt was a great and indeed a very touching and beautiful sight, for all\r\npresent were inspired with a feeling like that of men who have passed a\r\nterrible, racking crisis.  _Nous avons vaincu_!  Yes, we had conquered.\r\nAnd the Revolution had marched sternly on through years of discontent\r\nunto the year of aggravation, Forty-Eight, when there was thunder all\r\nround in Europe--and after all, France at one desperate bound had again\r\nplaced herself in the van!  And it was first decided by the taking of the\r\nTuileries!\r\n\r\nLet me dwell an instant on some minor incidents.  Many of the insurgents\r\nhad been all night without food.  The royal dinner was cooking in the\r\nkitchen, and it was droll to see the men helping themselves and walking\r\noff with the chickens and joints on their bayonets.  I had never seen a\r\nroyal kitchen before.  Soon all along the street loafers were seen with\r\njars of preserved cherries, &c., emptying them into their caps.  I went\r\ninto the burning guard-house.  A savage fellow offered me a great tin\r\npail, containing about two gallons of wine, which he offered me to drink.\r\nI was very thirsty, but I had a scruple against plunder.  Grasping his\r\nsword, he cried, \"_Buvez_, _citoyen_; _c'est du vin royal_.\"  Not wishing\r\nto have a duel _a l'outrance_ with a fellow-patriot, and, as I said,\r\nbeing thirsty, I took a good long pull.  We mutually winked and smiled.\r\nHe took a pull also to my health and Liberty.  We both \"pulled.\"\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention how my cohort had partially armed themselves that\r\nmorning.  They burst into every house and carried off all the arms they\r\ncould find, and then wrote in chalk over the doors--\"_Armes donnees_.\"\r\nThe Musee Cluny was very near my hotel and I saw it plundered.  Such a\r\nsight!  I saw one vagabond on a fine stolen horse, with a mediaeval\r\nhelmet on his head, a lance in his hand, and a six-feet double-handed\r\nsword or flamberg hanging behind his back.  He appeared to be quite\r\ndrunk, and reared about in eccentric _gambades_.  This genius of Freedom\r\nreappeared at the Tuileries.  Mortal man was never under such temptation\r\nto steal as I was--just one fifteenth-century poignard as a souvenir--from\r\nthat Museum--in fact, it was my _duty_ at that instant to do so,\r\nwhispered the tempter in my ear.  But I resisted; and lo! it came to pass\r\nin later years that I became possessed, for a mere trifle, in Dresden, of\r\nthe court dagger, in exquisite carved ivory, which was originally made\r\nfor Francis II. of France, and which has been declared by competent\r\nauthority to be authentic.  Owing to his short reign there are very few\r\nrelics of this monarch.\r\n\r\nSome of the blackguards in the mob drew out the royal carriages, set fire\r\nto them, and rolled them gaily along the _quai_.\r\n\r\nA noble-looking very old gentleman in military costume spoke to me before\r\nthe Tuileries, and saying that he had seen all of the old Revolution and\r\nNapoleon's wars, actually with tears in his eyes implored me to use my\r\ninfluence to prevent any plundering.  \"_Respectez la properte_.\"  There\r\nwere very few gentlemen indeed among the insurgents.  I only observed two\r\nor three in our quarter, and they were all from our hotel, or rather\r\nlodgings.  But the next day every swell in Paris came out as an\r\ninsurgent.  _They_ had all worked at barricades--so they said.  I\r\ncertainly had not seen any of them at work.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I strolled about with Field.  We came to a barricade.  A\r\nvery pretty girl guarded it with a sword.  She sternly demanded the\r\nparole or countersign.  I caught hold of her and kissed her, and showed\r\nmy pistols.  She laughed.  As I was armed with dirk and pistols, wore a\r\nsash, and was unmistakably a Latin Quarter _etudiant_, as shown by long\r\nhair, rakish cap on one side, red neck-tie, and single eyeglass, I was\r\neverywhere treated as a man and brother, friend and equal, warrior,\r\nand--by the girls--almost like a first-cousin.  Field shared the glory,\r\nof course.  And we made a great deal out of it, and were thought all the\r\nmore of in consequence.  _Vive la jeunesse_!\r\n\r\nComing to a corner, we heard three or four musket-shots.  We turned the\r\ncorner, and saw a man lying dead or dying in the last quiver, while at\r\nhis head there was at once placed a stick with a paper on it, on which\r\nwas written with lead-pencil, \"_Mort aux voleurs_!\"\r\n\r\nThe day before, one insurgent had offered me a beautiful old\r\nsilver-mounted sword for one of my pistols, fire-arms being so much in\r\ndemand, but I declined the offer.\r\n\r\nThe day after, I went into a cafe.  There were some students there who\r\nhad laid their arms on a table.  There was a very notorious little\r\n_lorette_, known as Pochardinette, who was so called because she was\r\nalways half-tipsy.  She was even noted in a popular song as--\r\n\r\n   \"La Pochardinette,\r\n   Qui ne sait refuser\r\n   Ni la ponche a pleine verre,\r\n   Ni sa bouohe a baiser.\"\r\n\r\nPochardinette picked up a horse-pistol, when its owner cried, \"Let that\r\nbe!  That is not the kind of weapon which _you_ are accustomed to\r\nmanage!\"  I stared at him with respect, for he had actually translated\r\ninto French an epigram by Jacopo Sannazar, word for word!\r\n\r\nI should here mention that on the 24th there was actually a period of two\r\nhours during which France had no Government--that is, none that it knew\r\nof.  Then there appeared on the walls all at once small placards giving\r\nthe list of names of the _Gouvernement Provisoire_.  Now, during this\r\nperiod of suspense there appeared at the Hotel de Ville a mysterious\r\nstranger; a small, bustling, active individual, who came in and announced\r\nthat a new Government had been formed, that he himself had been appointed\r\nMinister, that France expected every man to do his duty, and that no one\r\nshould lose their places who conformed to his orders.  \"I appoint,\" he\r\nsaid, \"So-and-so to take command of Vincennes.  Here, you--_Chose_!\r\nnotify him at once and send orders.  I believe that _Tel-et-tel_ had\r\nbetter take Marseilles.  Do any of you fellows know of a good governor\r\nfor Mauritius?\"  So _he_ governed France for half-an-hour and then\r\ndisappeared, and nobody ever knew to this day who this stupendous joker\r\nwas.  A full account of it all appeared some time after, and the cream of\r\nthe joke was that some of his appointed ones contrived to keep their\r\nplaces.  This brief dynasty has not been recorded in any work save this!\r\n\r\nIt was a droll fact that I had, the year before, at Heidelberg, drawn a\r\npicture of myself as an insurgent at a barricade, and written under it,\r\n\"The Boy of the Barricades.\"  I had long had a strange presentiment as to\r\nthis event.  I gave the picture to Peter A. Porter, then a student, and\r\nowner of a singular piece of property--that is, Niagara Falls, or at\r\nleast Goat Island and more or less of the American side.  Some time after\r\nthe 24th he showed me this picture in Paris.  He himself, I have heard,\r\ndied fighting bravely in our Civil War.  His men were so much attached to\r\nhim that they made, to recover his body, a special sally, in which twelve\r\nof them were killed.  He was _bon compagnon_, very pleasant, and gifted\r\nwith a very original, quaint humour.\r\n\r\nIf our ungrateful temporary stepmother, France, did not know it, at least\r\nthe waiters in the cafes, shopkeepers, and other people in the Latin\r\nQuarter were aware that Field and I were among the extremely small and\r\nselect number of gentlemen who had operated at the barricades for the\r\nhealth of Freedom, and for some time we never entered a restaurant\r\nwithout hearing admiring exclamations from the respectful waiters of\r\n\"_Ces sont les Americains_!\" or \"_Les Anglais_.\"  And indeed, to a small\r\ndegree, I even made a legendary local impression; for a friend of mine\r\nwho went from Philadelphia to Paris two years later, reported that I was\r\nstill in the memory of the Quarter as associated with the Revolution and\r\nlife in general.  One incident was indeed of a character which French\r\nstudents would not forget.  I had among my many friends, reputable and\r\ndemi-reputable, a rather remarkable _lorette_ named Maria, whose face was\r\nthe very replica of that of the Laughing Faun of the Louvre--or, if one\r\ncan conceive it, of a very pretty \"white nigger.\"  This young lady being\r\neither _ennuyee_ or frightened by the roar of musketry--probably the\r\nformer--and knowing that I was a Revolutionist and at work, conceived the\r\neccentric idea of hiring a coach, just when the fighting was at the\r\nworst, and driving over from the Rue Helder to visit me.  Which she\r\nactually did.  When she came to a barricade, she gave five francs to the\r\nchampions of liberty, and told them she was bearing important political\r\norders to one of their leaders.  Then the warriors would unharness the\r\nhorses, lift the carriage and beasts somehow over the barricade,\r\nre-harness, hurrah, and \"_Adieu_, _madame_!  _Vive la liberte_!\"  And so,\r\namid bullets and cheers, and death-stroke, and powder-smoke--_hinc et\r\ninde mors et luctus_--Maria came to my door in a carriage, and found me\r\nout with a vengeance--for I was revelling at the time in the royal halls\r\nof the Bourbons, or at least drinking wine out of a tin pail in the guard-\r\nhouse, whereby I escaped the expense of a truffled champagne dinner at\r\nMagny's--while the young lady was about fifty francs out of pocket by her\r\nlittle drive, probably the only one taken that day in Paris.  But she had\r\na fearfully jolly time of it, and saw the way that guns were fired to\r\nperfection.  This, too, became one of the published wonders of the day,\r\nand a local legend of renown.\r\n\r\nOf course all these proceedings put an end to lectures and study for the\r\ntime.  Then Mr. Goodrich, our Consul, as I have before said, organised a\r\ndeputation of Americans in Paris to go and congratulate the new\r\n_Gouvernement Provisoire_ on the new Republic, of which I was one, and we\r\nsaw all the great men, and Arago made us a speech.  Unfortunately all the\r\nbankers stopped paying money, and I had to live principally on credit, or\r\nsailed rather close to it, until I could write to my father and get a\r\ndraft on London.\r\n\r\nBut when the Revolution of June was coming, I determined to leave Paris.\r\nI had no sympathy for the Socialists, and I knew very well that neither\r\nthe new Government, nor the still newer Louis Napoleon, who was looming\r\nup so dangerously behind it, needed _my_ small aid.  There was a\r\nregulation in those days that every foreign resident on leaving Paris\r\nmust give twenty-four hours' notice to the police before he could obtain\r\nhis passport.  But when I applied for mine, it was handed out at once\r\n\"over the counter,\" with a smile and a wink, as if unto one who was\r\nmerrily well known, with an intimation that they were rather glad that I\r\nwas going, and would do everything to facilitate my departure.  I suspect\r\nthat my _dossier_ must have been interesting reading!  M. Claude, or his\r\nsuccessor, was probably of the same mind regarding me as the old black\r\npreacher in Philadelphia regarding a certain convert, \"De Lawd knows we\r\ndon' want no sitch bredderin in _dis_ congregation!\"\r\n\r\nSo I went to Rouen and saw the cathedral and churches--it was a very\r\nquaint old town then--and thence to Havre, where I took passage on a\r\nsteamboat for London.  The captain had a very curious old\r\nGnostic-Egyptian ring, with a gem on which were four animal heads in one,\r\nor a chimaera.  I explained what it was, and that it meant the year.  But\r\nthe captain could not rest till he had got the opinion of a fussy old\r\nFrenchman, who, as a doctor, was of course supposed to know more than I.\r\nHe looked at it, and, with a great air, remarked, \"_C'est grecque_!\"  Then\r\nthe captain was _quite_ satisfied.  It was Greek!\r\n\r\nI went in London to a very modest hotel, where I was, however, very\r\ncomfortable.  In those days a bottle of the very vilest claret\r\nconceivable, and far worse than \"Gladstone,\" cost four or five shillings;\r\ntherefore I took to pale ale.  Ewan Colquhoun soon found me out, and,\r\nunder his guidance, and that of two or three others whom I had met, I\r\nsoon explored London.  Firstly, he took me daily to his house in St.\r\nJames Street, where I can recall his mother, Mrs. Colquhoun, and father,\r\nand brothers, Patrick and James.  Patrick was a remarkable young man.  He\r\nhad graduated at Cambridge and Heidelberg and filled diplomatic\r\ncapacities in the East, and was familiar with many languages from Arabic\r\nto Gaelic, and was the first amateur light-weight boxer in England, and\r\nfirst sculler on the Thames, and had translated and annotated the\r\nprincipal compendium of Roman law.  He took me to see a grand rowing\r\nmatch, where we were in the _Leander_ barge.  So here and there I was\r\nintroduced to a great many people of the best society.  Meanwhile, with\r\nEwan, I visited the Cider Cellars, Evans', the Judge and Jury Club,\r\nCremorne, and all the gay resorts of those days, not to mention the\r\nmuseums, Tower, and everything down to Madame Tussaud's.  I went down in\r\na diving-bell in the Polytechnic, and over Barclay and Perkins' Brewery.\r\n\r\nOne night Colquhoun and I went to Drury Lane, and, after hearing Grisi,\r\nMario, and Lablache together, saw the great _pas de quatre_ which became\r\na historical marvel.  For it was danced by Taglioni, Cerito, Carlotta\r\nGrisi, and Lucile Grahn.  In after years, when I talked with Taglioni\r\nabout it, she assured me that night I had witnessed what the world had\r\nnever seen since, the greatest and most perfect execution conceivable.\r\nFor the four great artists, moved by rivalry, were inspired to do their\r\nbest before such an audience as was seldom seen.  Colquhoun kept pointing\r\nout one celebrity after another to me; I verily believe that I saw most\r\nof the great men and women of the time.  And afterwards I saw a great\r\nnumber in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThere was a rather distinguished-looking Frenchman very much about town\r\nin London while I was there.  He was always alone, and always dressed in\r\na long, light overcoat.  Wherever I went, to Cremorne or the Park, there\r\nhe was.  When Louis Napoleon came up in the world and I saw his\r\nphotograph, I at once recognised my Frenchman.\r\n\r\nThere roomed next to me in our hotel a German from Vienna named Becker.\r\nHe was an opera-singer, and the newspapers said that he was fully equal\r\nto the first baritone of the day.  I forget who that was: was it Pischek?\r\nI liked him very much; he was always in my room, and always singing\r\nlittle bits, but I was not much impressed by them, and once told him that\r\nI believed that I could sing as loudly as he.  He never said a word, but\r\nat once let out his whole voice in a tremendous _aria_.  I clapped my\r\nhands to my ears; I verily believed that he would shatter the windows!  I\r\nhave heard of a singer who actually broke a goblet by vibration, and I\r\nnow believe that it is possible.  I was once shown in the Hague Museum a\r\ngoblet which rang marvellously in accompaniment when one sang to it, and\r\nhave met with others like it.\r\n\r\nI was invited by a young friend named Hunt (a son of the great Chartist),\r\nwho had been a friend of mine in Heidelberg, where he had taken his\r\ndegree as doctor of Philosophy, to pass a week in the country at a\r\ncharming old Elizabethan place, said to have been the original Bleak\r\nHouse.  Everything there was perfectly delightful.  There were two or\r\nthree charming young ladies.  I remember among them a Miss Oliphaunt.\r\nThere was a glorious picnic, to which I and all walked eight miles and\r\nback.  I admired on this occasion for the first time the pedestrian\r\npowers of English girls.\r\n\r\nI visited Verulamium and St. Alban's Abbey, not then \"restored,\" and\r\nother beautiful places.  It all seemed like a fairy-tale, for the charm\r\nof my early reading came over me like enchantment.  One night Hunt and I\r\nwent into a little wayside inn.  There were assembled a number of\r\npeasants--hedgers and ditchers, or such like.  We treated them to ale,\r\nand they sang many strange old songs.  Then I was called on, and I sang\r\n\"Sir Patrick Spens,\" which was well received.\r\n\r\nI returned to London, and found, to my dismay, that I had not enough\r\nmoney to take me home!  I had received a bill of exchange on a merchant\r\nin London, and, in my innocence, never dreamed that it constituted no\r\nclaim on him whatever for a further supply.  I called at his office, saw\r\nhis son, who naturally informed me that they could advance me no more\r\nmoney, but referred me to his father.  The old gentleman seemed to be\r\namused, and questioned me all about myself.  When he found that his\r\nPhiladelphia correspondent was very well known to my father, and that the\r\nson of the correspondent was a fellow-student of mine at Heidelberg and\r\nParis, he asked me how much I wanted.  When I replied, \"Only enough to\r\npay my passage,\" he replied, \"Is that all?\" and at once gave me the\r\nmoney.  Then he questioned me as to my friends in London, and said, \"You\r\nhave seen something of the aristocracy, I would like you to see some of\r\nthe business people.\"  So he invited me to a dinner at the Reform Club,\r\nto meet a few friends.  Among these was a Mr. Birch, son of the\r\ncelebrated Alderman Birch.  He had directed the dinner, being a famous\r\n_gourmet_, and Soyer had cooked it.  That dinner cost my host far more\r\nthan he had made out of me.  We had six kinds of choicest wines, which\r\nimpressed me _then_.\r\n\r\nMr. Birch was a man of literary culture, and we went deeply into books.\r\nThe next day he sent me a charming work which he had written on the\r\nreligious belief of Shakespeare, in which it was fairly proved that the\r\nimmortal bard had none.  And I was so well pleased with England, that I\r\nliked it better than any country I had ever visited.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, when I came to London, and found my character of \"Hans\r\nBreitmann\" on three stages at once, I received, of course, a great deal\r\nof attention.  Somebody said to me, \"Oh, of course; you come here well\r\nknown, and are made a great deal of.\"  I replied, \"Twenty years ago I\r\ncame to London without a single letter of introduction, and had only two\r\nor three student friends, and received just as much kind hospitality.\"  I\r\nthink that like generally finds its like, so long as it is honest and can\r\npay its bills.\r\n\r\nI left Portsmouth for New York in a sailing-vessel or packet.  I could\r\nhave returned by steamer, but preferred the latter, as I should now, if\r\nthere were any packets crossing the ocean.  In old times travel was a\r\npleasure or an art; now it is the science of getting from place to place\r\nin the shortest time possible.  Hence, with all our patent Pullman cars\r\nand their dentist's chairs, Procrustean sofas, and headlong passages, we\r\ndo _not_ enjoy ourselves as we did when the coach went on the road so\r\nslowly as to allow us to see the country, when we halted often and long,\r\nmany a time in curious old villages.  But \"the idea of dragging along in\r\nthat way!\"  Well, and what, O tourist, dost thou travel _for_?\r\n\r\nThere was on the vessel in which I sailed, among the few passengers, Mrs.\r\nand Mr. John Gilbert, a well-known dramatic couple, who were extremely\r\nagreeable and genial, the husband abounding in droll reminiscences of the\r\nstage; a merry little German musician named Kreutzer, son of the great\r\ncomposer; and a young Englishwoman with a younger brother.  I rather\r\ndoubted the \"solidity\" of this young lady.  By-and-bye it was developed\r\nthat the captain was in love with her.  Out of this, I have heard, came a\r\ndreadful tragedy; for the love drove him mad, the insanity developing\r\nitself on the return voyage.  The captain had to be imprisoned in his own\r\nstate-room, where he committed suicide in a terrible manner by tearing\r\nhis throat open with the point of a candlestick or sconce.  The second\r\nmate, who was as coarse a brute as a common sailor could be, took\r\ncommand, and as he at once got drunk, and kept so, the passengers rose,\r\nconfined him, and gave the command to the third, who was very young.\r\n\r\n   \"Thus woman is the cause of fearful deeds.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, I freely admit that this incident resulted from a long voyage,\r\nfor we were thirty-five days in going from port to port.  In only a week,\r\nwith three or four days' preliminary sea-sickness, there is hardly time\r\nfor \"flirtation and its consequences.\"  Nor was it so much a stormy trip\r\nas one with long sunny calms.  Then we hauled up Gulf-weed with little\r\ncrabs--saw Portuguese men-of-war or sea-anemones sailing along like\r\nCleopatra's barges with purple sails, or counted flying-fish.  Apropos of\r\nthis last I have something to say.  During my last trip I once devoted an\r\nafternoon to closely observing these bird-like creatures, and very\r\ndistinctly saw two cases in which the fish turned and flew against the\r\nwind or tacked--a fact which has been denied.\r\n\r\nOne day I saw a few rudder-fish playing about the stern.  They weigh\r\nperhaps some six or seven pounds; so, standing on velvet cushions in the\r\ncabin, I fished out of the stern-window.  Then came a bite, and in a\r\nsecond I had my fish flapping about on the carpet under the table, to the\r\ngreat amazement of the steward, who had probably never had a live fish\r\njump so promptly before into his hands.  And we had it for dinner.  One\r\nday a ship made to us a signal of distress, and sent a boat, saying that\r\nthey were completely out of fuel; also that their passengers consisted\r\nentirely of the celebrated Ravel troupe of acrobats and actors.  It would\r\nhave been an experience to have crossed in that packet with their chief,\r\nGabriel!\r\n\r\nGabriel Ravel--it is one of my brother's published tales--was a good\r\nboxer as well as a marvellous acrobat, and he could _look_ like what he\r\npleased.  One morning a muscular and vain New York swell saw in a\r\ngymnasium one whom he supposed to be a very verdant New Jersey rustic\r\ngaping about.  The swell exhibited with great pride his skill on the\r\nparallel bars, horizontal pole, _et cetera_, and seeing the countryman\r\nabsolutely dumbfounded with astonishment, proposed to the latter to put\r\non the gloves.  \"Jersey\" hardly seemed to know what gloves were, but with\r\nmuch trouble he was got into form and set to milling.  But though he was\r\nas awkward as a blind cow, the swell pugilist could not for a very long\r\ntime get in a blow.  Jersey dodged every hit \"somehow\" in a manner which\r\nseemed to be miraculous.  At last one told on his chest, and it appeared\r\nto be a stunner, for it knocked him into the air, where he turned a\r\ndouble somersault, and then fell on his feet.  And it seemed as if,\r\nduring this flight, he had been suddenly inspired with a knowledge of the\r\nmanly art, for on descending, he went at the swell and knocked him from\r\ntime.  It was Gabriel Ravel.\r\n\r\nWe saw an iceberg far away, and lay off on the Grand Banks (where our\r\nsteerage passengers caught cod-fish), and beheld a water-spout--I once\r\nsaw two at a time in the Mediterranean--and whales, which were far\r\ncommoner then than now, it being rumoured that the one, and no more,\r\nwhich is regularly seen by passengers now is a tame one belonging to the\r\nWhite Star or some other line, which keeps him moored in a certain place\r\non exhibition; also that what Gulf-weed there is left is grown near New\r\nYork and scattered by night from certain boats.  It may be so--this is an\r\nartificial age.  All that remains is to learn that the flying-fish are\r\nNo. 3 salt mackerel set with springs, and I am not sure that I should\r\ndoubt even _that_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

On the way, I intrusted a\r\nnewsboy with an English shilling to go and get me change.  I still await\r\nthat change.  And in Philadelphia the hackman who drove me to my father's\r\nhouse, as soon as the trunks were removed, departed suddenly, carrying\r\naway with him a small hand-bag containing several valuable objects, which\r\nI never recovered.  I began to think that if the object of travel be to\r\nlearn to keep one's eyes open and avoid being swindled, that I had better\r\nhave remained at home.\r\n\r\nMy father had removed to another house in Walnut Street, below Twelfth\r\nStreet.  After this he only changed dwellings once more before his death.\r\nThis constant change from one rented house to another, like the changes\r\nfrom school to school, is very unfortunate, as I have before said, for\r\nany family.  It destroys all the feeling and unity of character which\r\ngrow up in a settled _home_.\r\n\r\nI pass over the joy of again seeing my parents, the dear sisters, and\r\nbrother Henry.  I was soon settled down, soon visiting friends, going to\r\nevening parties, making morning or afternoon calls, and after a little\r\nwhile was entered as a law-student in the office of John Cadwallader in\r\nFourth Street.\r\n\r\nI cannot pass over the fact, for it greatly influenced my after life,\r\nthat though everybody was very kind to me, and I was even in a small way\r\na kind of lion, the change from my late life was very hard to bear.  I\r\nhave read a wonderful story of a boy who while at a severe school had a\r\nmarvellous dream.  It seemed to last for years, and while it lasted, he\r\nwent to the University, graduated, passed into diplomatic life, was a\r\ngreat man and beloved; when all at once he awoke and found himself at\r\nschool again and birchable.  After the freedom of student life in\r\nHeidelberg and Munich and Paris, and having been among the few who had\r\ncarried out a great revolution, and much familiarity with the most\r\ncosmopolite type of characters in Europe, and existing in literature and\r\nart, I was settled down to live, move, and have all being henceforth and\r\nperhaps for ever in Philadelphia!  Of which city, at that time, there was\r\nnot one in the world of which so little evil could be said, or so much\r\ngood, yet of which so few ever spoke with enthusiasm.  Its inhabitants\r\nwere all well-bathed, well-clad, well-behaved; all with exactly the same\r\nideas and the same ideals.  A decided degree of refinement was everywhere\r\nperceptible, and they were so fond of flowers that I once ascertained by\r\ncareful inquiry that in most respectable families there was annually much\r\nmore money expended for bouquets than for books.  When a Philadelphian\r\ngave a dinner or supper, his great care was to see that everything _on\r\nthe table_ was as good or perfect as possible.  I had been accustomed to\r\nfirst considering what should be placed _around_ it on the chairs as the\r\nmain item.  The lines of demarcation in \"society\" were as strongly drawn\r\nas in Europe, or more so, with the enormous difference, however, that\r\nthere was not the slightest perceptible shade of difference in the\r\nintellects, culture, or character of the people on either side of the\r\nline, any more than there is among the school-boys on either side of the\r\nmark drawn for a game.  Very trifling points of difference, not\r\nperceptible to an outsider, made the whole difference between the\r\nexclusives and the excluded; just as the witch-mark no larger than a\r\nneedle-point indicates to the judge the difference between the saved and\r\nthe damned.\r\n\r\nI had not been long engaged in studying law when I made the acquaintance\r\nof Richard B. Kimball, a lawyer of New York, who had written a few novels\r\nwhich were very popular, and are still reprinted by Tauchnitz.  He knew\r\neverybody, and took a great interest in me, and opened the door for me to\r\nthe _Knickerbocker Magazine_.  To this I had contributed articles while\r\nat Princeton.  I now sent it my translation of Professor Neumann's\r\n\"Chinese in Mexico in the Fifth Century.\"  I forget whether this was in\r\n1849 or 1850.  In after years I expanded it to a book, of which a certain\r\nProfessor said, firstly in a paper read before the American Asiatic\r\nSociety, and secondly in a pamphlet, that there was nothing of any\r\nimportance in it which had not already appeared in Bancroft's work on the\r\nPacific.  I wrote to him, pointing out the fact that Bancroft's work did\r\nnot appear till many years after my article in the _Knickerbocker_.  To\r\nwhich the Sinologist replied very suavely and apologetically indeed that\r\nhe was \"very sorry,\" but had never seen the article in the\r\n_Knickerbocker_, &c.  But he did not _publish_ the correction, as he\r\nshould have done.  For which reason I now vindicate myself from the\r\ninsinuated accusation that I borrowed from Bancroft.  I had, indeed,\r\nalmost forgotten this work, \"Fusang,\" when, in 1890, Prince Roland\r\nBonaparte, at a dinner given by him to the Congres des Traditions\r\nPopulaires, startled me by recurring to it and speaking of it with great\r\npraise.  For it vindicates the claim of the French that Desguignes first\r\ndiscovered the fact that the Chinese were the first to discover America.\r\nIf any one doubts this, let him read the truly great work of Vinton on\r\nthe whole.  Prince Roland had been in China and earnestly studied the\r\nsubject.  Von Eichthal had endorsed my views, and wrote to me on Fusang.\r\nI have been for many years well acquainted with his nephew, Baron von\r\nEichthal, and his remarkably accomplished wife, who is expert in all the\r\nminor arts.\r\n\r\nMy father's resources became about this time limited, and I, in fact,\r\nrealised that he had taxed himself more than I had supposed to maintain\r\nme abroad.  His Congress Hall property did not pay much rent.  For my\r\nposition in the world, friends, studies, and society, I found myself very\r\nmuch and very often in great need of money.  As at that time we were\r\nsupposed to be much richer than we really were, this was an additional\r\nsource of trial.  I began to see clearly that in the law, as in all\r\nbusiness or professions, I should have to wait for years ere I could make\r\na living.  For the instances are very few and far between in which a\r\nyoung man, who has not inherited or grown up to a practice, can make one\r\nhimself at once.\r\n\r\nMore than this, I was not fitted for law at all.  From my birth I had\r\nabsolutely one of those peculiar temperaments which really disqualify men\r\nfor \"business.\"  If I had entered a law-office in which there was much\r\noffice-work or practice, I might have acquired a practical interest in\r\nthe profession, but of this there was in ours literally none whatever.  I\r\nhad a great fondness for copying deeds, &c., but Mr. Cadwallader, though\r\nhe very much admired my quaint round hand, being the very soul of honour,\r\nobserving that I was eager for such work, would not give me much of it\r\nthough it would have been to his profit, because, as he said, \"students\r\nwho paid should not be employed as clerks only, much less as copying\r\nmachines.\"  As it had always been deeply impressed on my mind by every\r\nAmerican friend that I had \"no business capacity,\" and, moreover, as I\r\ngreatly dreaded speaking in court, I had from the beginning a great fear\r\nthat I could never live by the law.  I mention this because there are\r\nmany thousands of young men who suffer terribly from such apprehension,\r\nand often ruin life by it.  A few months' practice in a mercantile\r\ncollege will go far to relieve the first apprehension, while as regards\r\n_stage fright_, it can be easily educated out of anybody, as I have since\r\nthose days educated it out of myself, so that rising to debate or speak\r\ninspires in me a _gaudium certaminis_, which increases with the certainty\r\nof being attacked.  Let the aspirant begin by reading papers before, let\r\nus say, a family or school, and continue to do so frequently and at as\r\nshort intervals as possible before such societies or lyceums as will\r\nlisten to him.  Then let him speak from memory or improvise and debate.\r\nThis should form a part of all education whatever, and it should be\r\n_thorough_.  It is specially needed for lawyers and divines, yet a great\r\nproportion of both are most insufficiently trained in it; and while I was\r\nstudying law it was never mentioned to me.  I was never so much as once\r\ntaken into court or _practically_ employed in any manner whatever.\r\n\r\nI remember an amusing incident in the office.  Mr. Cadwallader asked me\r\none day to call, returning from my lunch, on a certain Mr. Dimpfel, one\r\nof his clients, leave a certain message and his request as follows:--\"I\r\nwant you, Mr. Leland, to be _very careful_.  I have observed that you are\r\nsometimes inaccurate in such matters, therefore be sure that you give me\r\nMr. Dimpfel's _very words_.\"  Mr. Cadwallader knew French and Spanish\r\nperfectly, but not German, and was not aware that I always conversed with\r\nMr. Dimpfel in the latter language.  When I returned my teacher said--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Leland, can you repeat accurately _word for word_ what Mr.\r\nDimpfel said?\" I replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  _Der Herr Dimpfel lasst sich grussen und meldet das er Montag\r\nkommen wird um halb drei_.  _Und er sagt weiter_ . . . \"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" cried Mr. Cadwallader; \"you must give it in English.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" was my grave reply, \"but you asked for his very\r\nwords.\"\r\n\r\nI began to write for publication in 1849.  Mr. John Sartain, a great\r\nengraver, established a magazine, to which I contributed several articles\r\non art subjects, subsequently many more on all subjects, and finally\r\nevery month a certain number of pages of humorous matter.  A man named\r\nManuel Cooke established in Philadelphia a _Drawing-Room Journal_.  For\r\nthis I wrote a great deal for a year or two.  It paid me no money, but\r\ngave me free admission to theatres, operas, etc., and I learned a great\r\ndeal as to the practical management of a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe first summer after my return we went to Stonington, and thence to\r\nvisit our friends in New England, as of yore.  At Dedham I had an attack\r\nof cholera; my uncle, Dr. Stimson, gave me during the night two doses of\r\nlaudanum of fifty drops each, which cured me.  Father Matthew came to\r\nDedham.  I went with a very pretty young cousin of mine named Marie\r\nLizzie Fisher, since deceased, to hear him preach.  After the address,\r\nmeeting the Father, I went boldly up and introduced myself to him, and\r\nthen Miss Fisher.  I think that his address must have deeply affected me,\r\nsince I was obliged to stop on my way home to take a drink to steady my\r\nnerves.  It was against the law at that time to sell such \"poison,\" so\r\nthe hotel-keeper took me and my paternal uncle, George, who treated, down\r\ninto the cellar, where he had concealed some Hollands.  I can remember\r\nthat that pleasant summer in Dedham I, one Sunday morning in the church\r\nduring service, composed a poem, which in after years even found its way\r\ninto \"The Poets and Poetry of America.\"  It began with the words--\r\n\r\n   \"O'er an old ruined doorway\r\n      Philosophus hung,\r\n   And madly his bell-cap\r\n      And bauble he swung.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a wild mixture of cosmopolitanism and Hamletism, and it indicates\r\naccurately the true state of my _cor cordium_ at that time.  Earnest\r\nthought, or a yearning for truth, and worldly folly, were playing a game\r\nof battledore and shuttlecock, and I was the feathered cork.  There is a\r\nsong without words by Mendelssohn, which sets forth as clearly as\r\nShakespeare or Heine could have done in words, deep melancholy or\r\nunavoidable suffering expressing itself merrily and gaily in a manner\r\nwhich is both touching and beautiful, or sweet and sad.  Without any self-\r\nconsciousness or display of sentimentalism, I find deep traces of this in\r\nmany little poems or sketches which I wrote at that time, and which have\r\nnow been forgotten.  I had been in Arcadia; I was now in a very pleasant\r\nsunny Philistia; but I could not forget the past.  And I never forgot it.\r\nOnce in Paris, in the opera, I used in jest emphatically the Russian word\r\n_harrascho_, \"good,\" when a Russian stranger in the next box smiled\r\njoyously, and rising, waved his glove to me.  Once in a brilliant soiree\r\nin Philadelphia there was a Hungarian Count, an exile, and talking with\r\nhim in English, I let fall for a joke \"_Bassama terem-tete_!\"  He grasped\r\nmy hand, and, forgetting all around, entered into a long conversation.  It\r\nwas like the American who, on finding an American cent in the streets in\r\nParis, burst into tears.  So from time to time something recalled Europe\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nI went now and then to New York, which I liked better than Philadelphia.\r\nI was often a guest of Mr. Kimball.  He introduced me to Dr. Rufus\r\nGriswold, a strange character and a noted man of letters.  He was to his\r\ndeath so uniformly a friend to me, and so untiring in his efforts to aid\r\nme, that I cannot find words to express his kindness nor the gratitude\r\nwhich I feel.  He became the editor of a literary magazine which was\r\nreally far in advance of the time.  It did not last long; while it\r\nendured I supplied for it monthly reviews of foreign literature.\r\n\r\nThere were not many linguists on the American press in those days, and my\r\nreviews of works in half-a-dozen languages induced some one to pay a high\r\ncompliment to the editor.  It was Bayard Taylor, I believe, who, hearing\r\nthis, declared honestly, and as a friend, that I alone deserved the\r\ncredit.  This was repeated by some one to Dr. Griswold in such a form\r\nthat he thought _I_ had been talking against him, though I had never\r\nspoken to a soul about it.  The result was that the Doctor promptly\r\ndismissed me, and I felt hurt.  Mr. Kimball met me and laughed, saying,\r\n\"The next time you meet the Doctor just go resolutely at him and _replace\r\nyourself_.  Don't allow him a word.\"  So, meeting Dr. Griswold a few days\r\nafter in Philadelphia, I went boldly up and said, \"You must come at once\r\nwith me and take a drink--immediately!\"  The Doctor went like a lamb--not\r\nto the slaughter, but to its milk--and when he had drunk a comforting\r\ngrog, I attacked him boldly, and declared that I had never spoken a word\r\nto a living soul as to the authorship of the reviews--which was perfectly\r\ntrue, for I never broke the golden rule of \"contributorial anonymity.\"  So\r\nthe Doctor put me on the staff again.  But to the end of his life I was\r\nalways with him a privileged character, and could take, if I chose, the\r\nmost extraordinary liberties, though he was one of the most irritable and\r\nvindictive men I ever met, if he fancied that he was in any way too\r\nfamiliarly treated.\r\n\r\nKossuth came to America, and I was almost squeezed to death--right\r\nagainst a pretty German girl--in the crowd at his reception in\r\nPhiladelphia.  At the dinner in New York I met at Kimball's house Franz\r\nPulszky, and sat by his wife.  I have since seen him many times in Buda-\r\nPest.\r\n\r\nThere lived in Philadelphia a gentleman named Rodney Fisher.  He had been\r\nfor many years a partner in an English house in Canton, and also lived in\r\nEngland.  He had long been an intimate friend of Russel Sturgis,\r\nsubsequently of \"Baring Brothers.\"  He was a grand-nephew of Caesar\r\nRodney, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and a son\r\nof Judge Fisher, of Delaware.  He was a man of refined and agreeable\r\nmanners and an admirable relater of his innumerable experiences in Europe\r\nand the East.  His wife had been celebrated for her beauty.  When I first\r\nmet her in her own house she seemed to me to be hardly thirty years of\r\nage, and I believed at first she was one of her own daughters.  She was\r\nwithout exception the most amiable, I may say lovable person whom I ever\r\nmet, and I never had a _nuance_ or shade of difference of opinion with\r\nher, or know an instant during which I was not devoted to her.  I visited\r\nhis house and fell in love with his daughter Belle, to whom I became,\r\nafter about a year, engaged.  We were not, however, married till five\r\nyears after.  Thackeray, whom I knew well, said to a Mr. Curtis Raymond,\r\nof Boston, not long before leaving for England, that she was the most\r\nbeautiful woman whom he had seen in America.  I cannot help recording\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI need not say that, notwithstanding my terrible anxiety as to my future,\r\nfrom this time I led a very happy life.  There was in Philadelphia a very\r\nwealthy lady called its Queen.  This was Mrs. James Rush.  She had built\r\nthe finest house in our city, and placed in it sixty thousand dollars'\r\nworth of furniture.  \"_E un bel palazzo_!\" said an Italian tenor one\r\nevening to me at a reception there.  This lady, who had read much, had\r\nlived long in Europe and \"knew cities and men.\"  To say that she was kind\r\nto me would feebly express her kindness.  It is true that we were by much\r\nmutual knowledge rendered congenial.  She invited me to attend her weekly\r\nreceptions, &c., with Miss Fisher.  There we met and were introduced to\r\nall the celebrated people who passed through Philadelphia.  One evening I\r\nhad there, for instance, a conversation in German with Mme. Sontag, the\r\ngreat singer, as with Jerome Bonaparte, the nephew.\r\n\r\nWhen the summer came I joined Mr. Fisher and his two daughters--the\r\nsecond was named Mary--in a tour.  We went to New York, thence up the\r\nHudson, and eastward to Boston.  After a day's travel we came to a town\r\non the frontier line, where we had to stop for two hours.  Mr. Fisher and\r\nI, being very thirsty and fatigued, went into a saloon in which were two\r\nbars or counters.  Advancing to the second of these, I asked for brandy.\r\n\"We don't sell no brandy here,\" replied the man.  \"This is in\r\nMassachusetts: go to the other bar--that is in New York.\"  In an instant\r\nwe left New England for the Middle States, and refreshed ourselves.\r\nThence we went to Springfield and saw the armoury, where guns are made.\r\nThence to Boston, where we stopped at a hotel.  I went with Miss Belle\r\nFisher for a day's excursion to Dedham, where my mother and sisters were\r\non a visit.  It was very pleasant.\r\n\r\nFrom Boston we went to Newport, and stayed at the Ocean House.  There I\r\nfound Milton Sanford, a connection of mine and a noted character.  He had\r\nlived in Florence and known Browning and his wife.  He was, I believe,\r\nuncle of Miss Kate Field.  He introduced me to Colonel Colt, the\r\ncelebrated inventor or re-discoverer of the revolver; to Alf. Jaell, a\r\nvery great pianist; and Edward Marshall, a brother of Humphrey Marshall.\r\nSanford, Colt, Marshall, and I patronised the pistol-gallery every day,\r\nnor did we abstain from mint-juleps.  I found that, in shooting, Colonel\r\nColt could beat me _at the word_, but that I always had the best of it at\r\na deliberate \"take-your-time\" shot.  There, too, were the two brothers\r\nBurnett, whom I had met long before in Heidelberg.  What with drives and\r\nballs and other gaiety, the time passed pleasantly enough.\r\n\r\nAs I spoke German, I became intimate with Jaell.  He could not sing at\r\nall.  Once I suggested to him that he should compose variations on an\r\nair, a German popular song.  For a day or two he hummed it as well as he\r\ncould.  On the third morning he took me into a room where there was a\r\npiano, and asked me to sing while he played accompaniments.  All at once\r\nhe said, \"Stop! I have got it!\" and then he played the air with\r\nmarvellously beautiful variations.  He was a great genius, but I never\r\nheard him play in public as he played then.  He was in a \"high hour.\"  It\r\nwas wonderful.  I may here say that in after years, while living at a\r\nhotel, I became well acquainted with Thalberg, and especially with Ole\r\nBull, the violinist, who told me much about Heine.\r\n\r\nSo time rolled on for three years.  I passed my examination and took an\r\noffice in Third Street, with a sign proclaiming that I was attorney-at-\r\nlaw and _Avokat_.  During six months I had two clients and made exactly\r\nthree pounds.  Then, the house being wanted, I left and gave up law.  This\r\nwas a very disheartening time for me.  I had a great many friends who\r\ncould easily have put collecting and other business in my hands, but none\r\nof them did it.  I felt this very keenly.  Quite apart from a young man's\r\npushing himself, despite every obstacle, there is the great truth that\r\nsometimes the obstacles or bad luck become insuperable.  Mine did at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe author of \"Gossip of the Century\" has well remarked that \"it has been\r\nsaid that however quickly a clever lad may have run up the ladder,\r\nwhether of fame or fortune, it will always be found that he was lucky\r\nenough to find some one who put his foot on the first rung.\"  Which is\r\nperfectly true, as I soon found, if not in law, at least in literature.\r\n\r\nI went more than once to New York, hoping to obtain literary employment.\r\nOne day Dr. Rufus Griswold came to me in great excitement.  Mr.\r\nBarnum--the great showman--and the Brothers Beech were about to establish\r\na great illustrated weekly newspaper, and he was to be the editor and I\r\nthe assistant.  It is quite true that he had actually taken the post, for\r\nwhich he did not care twopence, only to provide a place for me, and he\r\nhad tramped all over New York for hours in a fearful storm to find me and\r\nto announce the good news.\r\n\r\nThen work began for me in tremendous earnest.  Let the reader imagine\r\nsuch a paper as the London _Illustrated News_ with one editor and one\r\nassistant!  Three men could not have read our exchanges, and I was\r\nexpected to do that and all the minor casual writing for cuts, or cutting\r\ndown and occasional outside work.  And yet even Mr. Barnum, who should\r\nhave had more sense, one day, on coming in, expressed his amazement on\r\nseeing about a cartload of country exchanges which I had not opened.  But\r\nthere was something in Philadelphia which made all work seem play to me,\r\nand I long laboured from ten in the morning till midnight.  My assiduity\r\nattracted attention.\r\n\r\nDr. Griswold was always a little \"queer,\" and I used to scold and reprove\r\nhim for it.  He had got himself into great trouble by his remarks on\r\nEdgar A. Poe.  Mr. Kimball and others, who knew the Doctor, believed, as\r\nI do, that there was no deliberate evil or envy in those remarks.  Poe's\r\nbest friends told severe stories of him in those days--_me ipso\r\nteste_--and Griswold, naught extenuating and setting down naught in\r\nmalice, wrote incautiously more than he should.  These are the words of\r\nanother than I.  But when Griswold was attacked, then he became savage.\r\nOne day I found in his desk, which he had committed to me, a great number\r\nof further material collected to Poe's discredit.  I burnt it all up at\r\nonce, and told the Doctor what I had done, and scolded him well into the\r\nbargain.  He took it all very amiably.  There was also much more matter\r\nto other men's discredit--_ascensionem expectans_--awaiting publication,\r\nall of which I burned.  It was the result of long research, and evidently\r\nformed the material for a book.  Had it ever been published, it would\r\nhave made Rome howl!  But, as I said, I was angry, and I knew it would\r\ninjure Dr. Griswold more than anybody.  It is a pity that I had not\r\nalways had the Doctor in hand--though I must here again repeat that, as\r\nregards Poe, he is, in my opinion, not so much to blame as a score of\r\nwriters have made out.  The tales, which were certainly most authentic,\r\nor at least apparently so, during the life of the latter, among his best\r\nfriends regarding him, were, to say the least, discreditable, albeit that\r\nis no excuse whatever for publishing them.  I have always much disliked\r\nthe popular principle of judging men's works entirely by their lives, and\r\ndeciding against the literary merit of _Sartor Resartus_ because Carlyle\r\nput his wife's money to his own account _in banco_.\r\n\r\nAnd it is, moreover, cruel that a man, because he has been a poet or\r\ngenius or artist, must needs have every weakness (real or conjectured) in\r\nhis life served up and grinned at and chatted over, as if he forsooth\r\nwere a clergyman or some kind of make-believe saint.  However, the more\r\nvulgar a nature is the more it will gloat on gossip; and herein the most\r\npretentious of the higher classes show themselves no better than the\r\nbasest.\r\n\r\nI lived at Dan Bixby's, at the corner of Park Place and Broadway, where I\r\ncame very near being shot one night by a man who mistook me, or rather my\r\nroom, for that of the one below, in which his wife was, or had been, with\r\nanother person.  Being very tipsy, the injured individual went one storey\r\ntoo high, and tried to burst in to shoot me with a revolver, but I\r\nrepelled him after a severe struggle, in which I had sharp work to avoid\r\nbeing shot.  I would much rather fight a decent duel any time than have\r\nsuch a \"hog-fight.\"  I only had a loaded cane.  The worst of it was that\r\nthe injured husband, having traced his wife, as he erroneously thought,\r\nto my room, went to Bixby and the clerk, and asked who lived in it.  But\r\nas they were my friends, they dismissed him gruffly, yet believed all the\r\nsame that _I_ had \"a petticoat in my wardrobe.\"  Hence for a week all my\r\nfriends kept making cruel allusions in my presence to gay deceivers and\r\nDon Juan _et cetera_, until in a rage I asked what the devil it all\r\nmeant, when there was an explanation by a clergyman, and I swore myself\r\nclear.  But I thought it was hard lines to have to stand the revolver,\r\nendure all the scandal for a week, and be _innocent_ all the time withal!\r\nThat was indeed bitter in the cup!\r\n\r\nApropos of this small affair, I can recall a droll scene, _de eodem\r\ngenere_, which I witnessed within a week of the other.  There was a\r\nrather first-class saloon, bar, and restaurant on Broadway, kept by a\r\ngood-looking pugilistic-associated individual named George Shurragar.  As\r\nhe had black eyes, and was a shoulder-hitter, and as the name in Romany\r\nmeans \"a captain,\" I daresay he was partly gypsy.  And, when weary with\r\neditorial work, I sometimes dropped in there for refreshment.  One night\r\nan elderly, vulgar individual, greatly exalted by many brandies, became\r\ndisorderly, and drawing a knife, made a grand Malay charge on all\r\npresent, _a la mok_.  George Shurragar promptly settled him with a blow,\r\ndisarmed him, and \"fired him out\" into outer darkness.  Then George\r\nexhibited the knife.  It was such a dirty, disreputable-looking\r\n\"pig-sticker,\" that we were all disgusted, and George cast it with\r\ncontempt into the street.  Does the reader remember the scene in \"The\r\nBohemian Girl\" in which the dandy Count examines the nasty knife left\r\nbehind by the gypsy Devilshoof?  It was the very counterpart of this, the\r\ndifference being that in this case it was the gypsy who despised the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nSuch trivial amusing incidents and rencontres as these were matters of\r\nalmost daily occurrence to me in those days, and I fear that I incur the\r\nreproach of padding by narrating these.  Yet, as I write this, I have\r\njust read in the \"Life of Benvenuto Cellini\" that he too omits the\r\ndescription of a lot of exactly such adventures, as being, like the\r\ndarkey's imprisonments for stealing, \"not worf mentionin'\"--and confess I\r\nfelt great regret that he did so; for there is always a great deal of\r\nlocal and temporal colour in anything whose proper _finale_ should be in\r\na police-court.\r\n\r\nHawthorne used to stay at Bixby's.  He was a moody man, who sat by the\r\nstove and spoke to no one.  Bixby had been a publisher, and was proud\r\nthat he had first issued Hayward's \"Faust\" in America.  He was also proud\r\nthat his hotel was much frequented by literary men and naval officers.  He\r\nwas very kind to me.  Once when I complained to the clerk that the price\r\nof my rooms was too high, he replied, \"Mr. Leland, the prices of all the\r\nrooms in the house, excepting yours, were raised long ago, and Mr. Bixby\r\ncharged me strictly _not to let you know it_.\"  Uncle Daniel was a\r\ngentleman, and belonged to my club--the Century.  When he grew older he\r\nlived on an annuity, and was a great and privileged favourite among\r\nactresses and singers.  Thirty years later I called with him in New York\r\non Ada Cavendish.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight or so, Dr. Griswold began to be very erratic.  He had a\r\ndivorce case going on in Philadelphia.  He went off, assuring me that\r\neverything was in order, and never returned.  The foreman came to me\r\nsaying that there was no copy, and nothing ready, and everything needed.\r\nHere was indeed a pretty kettle of fish!  For I at that time absolutely\r\ndistrusted my own ability to do all the work.  I flew to Kimball, who\r\nsaid, \"Just put it through by strong will, and you'll succeed.\"\r\n\r\nThen I went to Mr. Barnum--Uncle Barnum--who was always \"as good as gold\"\r\nto me.  I burst out into a statement of my griefs, mentioning\r\nincidentally that I really could not go on as full editor, and do such\r\nfearful work on the salary of an office-boy.  He listened to it all, I am\r\nsure with amusement, and placing his hand kindly on my shoulder as we\r\nwalked up and down the hall of the Museum, said, \"You _sha'n't_ go.  Don't\r\nget into a funk.  I know that you can do the work, and do it _well_.  And\r\nthe salary shall be doubled--certainly!\"\r\n\r\nSo the paper was brought out after all.  I had great trouble for some\r\ntime to learn to write editorials.  I used to go to the office of a\r\nSunday morn, and sit sometimes from ten till two turning over the\r\nexchanges, and seeking for ideas.  It was a dreadful ordeal.  In fact, in\r\nafter times it was several years before I could seize a pen, rattle up a\r\nsubject and dash off a leader.  _Now_ I can write far more easily than I\r\ncan talk.  And it is a curious fact that soon after I became really\r\nskilled at such extempore work in the opinion of the best judges, such as\r\nRaymond, I no longer had any opportunity to practice it.\r\n\r\nI had worked only a week or two when a rather queer, tall, roughish\r\nYankee was brought into the office.  He worked for a while, and in a day\r\nor two took possession of my desk and rudely informed me that he was my\r\nsuperior editor and master there.  He had, as many men do, mistaken\r\namiable politeness for humility.  I replied, knowing that Mr. Beech, out\r\nof sight, was listening to every word, that there was no master there but\r\nMr. Beech, and that I should keep my desk.  We became affable; but I\r\nabode my time, for I found that he was utterly incompetent to do the\r\nwork.  Very soon he told me that he had an invitation to lecture in\r\nPhiladelphia.  I told him that if he wished to go I would do all his work\r\nfor him.  So he went, and Mr. Beech coming in, asked where Mr. --- was.  I\r\nreplied that he had gone away to lecture, and that I was to do his work\r\nduring his absence.  This was really too much, and the Yankee was\r\ndismissed \"in short order,\" the Beeches being men who made up their minds\r\npromptly and acted vigorously.  As for me, I never, shirked work of any\r\nkind.  A gentleman on a newspaper never does.  The more of a snob a man\r\nis, the more afraid he is of damaging his dignity, and the more desirous\r\nof being \"boss\" and captain.  But though I have terribly scandalised my\r\nchief or proprietor by reporting a fire, I never found that I was less\r\nrespected by the typos, reporters, and subs.\r\n\r\nI had before leaving Philadelphia published two books.  One was \"The\r\nPoetry and Mystery of Dreams,\" which I dedicated to my fiancee, Miss\r\nBelle Fisher.  The other was an odd melange, which had appeared in\r\nchapters in the _Knickerbocker Magazine_.  It was titled _Meister Karl's\r\nSketch-Book_.  It had no great success beyond attaining to a second\r\nedition long after; yet Washington Irving praised it to everybody, and\r\nwrote to me that he liked it so much that he kept it by him to nibble\r\never and anon, like a Stilton cheese or a _pate de foie gras_; and here\r\nand there I have known men, like the late Nicolas Trubner or E. L.\r\nBulwer, who found a strange attraction in it, but it was emphatically\r\ncaviare to the general reader.  It had at least a _style_ of its own,\r\nwhich found a few imitators.  It ranks, I think, about _pari passu_ with\r\nCoryatt's \"Crudities,\" or lower.\r\n\r\nThere were two or three salons in New York where there were weekly\r\nliterary receptions, and where one could meet the principal writers of\r\nthe time.  I often saw at Kimball's and other places the Misses\r\nWetherell, who wrote the \"Wide, Wide World\" and \"Queechy.\"  They were\r\nelderly, and had so very little of the \"world\" in their ways, that they\r\noccurred to me as an example of the fact that people generally write most\r\non what they know least about.  Thus a Lowell factory-girl likes to write\r\na tale of ducal society in England; and when a Scotchman has less\r\nintelligence of \"jocks\" and \"wut\" than any of his countrymen, he\r\ncompiles, and comments on, American humorists.\r\n\r\nOnce there was a grand publishers' dinner to authors where I went with\r\nAlice and Phoebe Carey, who were great friends of mine.  There I met and\r\ntalked with Washington Irving; I remember Bryant and N. P. Willis, _et\r\ntous les autres_.  Just at that time wine, &c., could only be sold in New\r\nYork \"in the original packages as imported.\"  Alice or Phoebe Carey\r\nlamented that we were to have none at the banquet.  There was a large\r\ndish of grapes before her, and I said, \"Why, there you have plenty of it\r\nin the original packages!\"\r\n\r\nAt that time very hospitable or genial hosts used to place a bottle of\r\nbrandy and glass in the gentlemen's dressing-room at an evening's\r\nreception, and I remember it was considered a scandalous thing when a\r\ncertain old retired naval officer once emptied the whole bottle single-\r\nhanded.\r\n\r\nOf course I was very intimate with Clark of the _Knickerbocker_, Fred\r\nCozzens, John Godfrey Saxe, and all the company of gay and festive\r\nhumorists who circled about that merry magazine.  There was never\r\nanything quite like the _Knickerbocker_, and there never will be again.\r\nIt required a sunny, genial social atmosphere, such as we had before the\r\nwar, and never after; an easy writing of gay and cultivated men for one\r\nanother, and not painfully elaborating jocosities or seriosities for the\r\nmillion as in--But never mind.  It sparkled through its summer-time, and\r\noh! how its readers loved it!  I sometimes think that I would like to\r\nhunt up the old title-plate with Diedrich Knickerbocker and his pipe, and\r\nissue it again every month to a few dozen subscribers who loved quaint\r\nodds and ends, till I too should pass away!\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough to foresee that a great illustrated weekly, with\r\nactually one young man, and generally no more, to do all the literary\r\nwork could not last long.  And yet the _New York Times_, or some such\r\njournal, said that the work was very well done, and that the paper did\r\nwell until I left.  Heaven knows that I worked hard enough on it, and,\r\nwhat was a great deal to boast of in those days, never profited one\r\nfarthing beyond free tickets to plays, which I had little time to use.\r\nAnd yet my pay was simply despicably small.  I had great temptations to\r\nwrite up certain speculative enterprises, and never accepted one.  Our\r\ncirculation sometimes reached 150,000.  And if the publishers (excepting\r\nBarnum) had ever shown me anything like thanks or kindness for gratuitous\r\nzeal and interest which I took, I could have greatly aided them.  One\r\nday, for instance, I was asked to write a description of a new ferry.  I\r\nwent there, and the proprietor intimated that he would pay a large sum\r\nfor an article which would point out the advantage or profit which would\r\naccrue from investing in his lots.  I told him that if it were really\r\ntrue that such was the case, I would do it for nothing, but that I never\r\nmade money behind my salary.  I began to weary of the small Yankee greed\r\nand griping and \"thanklessness\" which I experienced.  There were editors\r\nin New York who, for less work, earned ten times the salary which I\r\nreceived.  I was not sorry when I heard that some utterly inexperienced\r\nNew England clergyman had been engaged to take my place.  So I returned\r\nto Philadelphia.  The paper very soon came to grief.  I believe that with\r\nBarnum alone I could have made it a great success.  We had Frank Leslie\r\nfor chief engraver, and he was very clever and ambitious.  I had a\r\nknowledge of art, literature, and foreign life and affairs, which could\r\nhave been turned, with Leslie's co-operation, to great advantage.  I\r\nneeded an office with a few books for reference, at least three or four\r\nliterary aids, and other ordinary absolutely necessary facilities for\r\nwork.  All that I literally had was a space half-portioned off from the\r\nengine-room, where a dozen blackguard boys swore and yelled as it were at\r\nmy elbow, a desk, a chair, and a pair of scissors, ink, and paste.  This\r\nwretched scrimping prevailed through the whole business, and thus it was\r\nexpected to establish a great first-class American illustrated newspaper.\r\nIt is sometimes forgotten in the United States that to make a vast\r\nsuccess, something is requisite beyond enterprise and economy, and that\r\nit is a very poor policy to screw your _employes_ down to the last cent,\r\nand overwork them, and make business needlessly irksome, when they have\r\nit in their power to very greatly advance your interests.  I dwell on\r\nthis because it is a common error everywhere.  I have in my mind a case\r\nin which an employer, who lived \"like a prince,\" boasted to me how little\r\nhe paid his men, and how in the long-run it turned out bitterly to his\r\nloss in many ways.  Those who had no principle robbed him, while the\r\nhonest, who would have made his interests their own, left him.  I have\r\nseen business after business broken up in this way.  While the principal\r\nis in vigour and life, he may succeed with mere servants who are poorly\r\npaid; then, after a time, some younger partner, who has learned his\r\nmorals from the master, pushes him out, or he dies, and the business is\r\nworthless, because there is not a soul in it who cares for it, or who has\r\ngrown up with any common sense of interest with the heirs.\r\n\r\nI remember one day being obliged in New York to listen to a conversation\r\nbetween two men of business.  One owed the other a large sum, honestly\r\nenough--of that there was no question between them; but he thought that\r\nthere was a legal way to escape payment, while the other differed from\r\nhim.  So they argued away for a long time.  There was not a word of\r\nreproach; the creditor would have cheated the debtor in the same way if\r\nhe could; the only point of difference was whether it could be done.  An\r\n_employe_ who can remain in such surroundings and be honest must be\r\nindeed a miracle of integrity, and, if he do not over-reach them in the\r\nlong-run, one of stupidity.  I might have made \"house and land\" out of\r\nthe newspaper had I been so disposed.\r\n\r\nOf all the men whom I met in those days in the way of business, Mr.\r\nBarnum, the great American humbug, was by far the honestest and freest\r\nfrom guile or deceit, or \"ways that were dark, or tricks that were vain.\"\r\nHe was very kind-hearted and benevolent, and gifted with a sense of fun\r\nwhich was even stronger than his desire for dollars.  I have talked very\r\nconfidentially with him many times, for he was very fond of me, and\r\nalways observed that to engineer some grotesque and startling paradox\r\ninto tremendous notoriety, to make something _immensely_ puzzling with a\r\nstupendous _sell_ as postscript, was more of a motive with him than even\r\nthe main chance.  He was a genius like Rabelais, but one who employed\r\nbusiness and humanity for material instead of literature, just as Abraham\r\nLincoln, who was a brother of the same band, employed patriotism and\r\npolitics.  All three of them expressed vast problems, financial,\r\nintellectual, or natural, by the brief arithmetic of a joke.  Mr. Barnum\r\nwas fearfully busy in those days; what with buying elephants, wooing two-\r\nheaded girls for his Grand Combination, laying out towns, chartering\r\nbanks, and inventing unheard-of wonders for the unrivalled collection of\r\none hundred and fifty million unparalleled moral marvels; but he always\r\nfound time to act as unpaid contributor to a column of humorous items\r\nwhich I always published.  I have said that I had no assistant; I forgot\r\nthat I always had Mr. Barnum as assistant humorous editor for that\r\ndepartment.  All at once, when least expected, he would come smiling in\r\nwith some curiosity of literature such as the \"reverse\"--\r\n\r\n   \"Lewd did I live & evil I did dwel,\"\r\n\r\nor a fresh conundrum or joke, with all his heart and soul full of it, and\r\nhe would be as delighted over the proof as if to see himself in print was\r\na startling novelty.  We two had \"beautiful times\" over that column, for\r\nthere was a great deal of \"boy\" still left in Barnum; nor was I by any\r\nmeans deficient in it.  One thing I set my face against firmly: I never\r\nwould in any way whatever write up, aid, or advertise the great show or\r\nmuseum, or cry up the elephant.  I was resolved to leave the paper first.\r\n\r\nOn that humorous column Barnum always deferred to me, even as a small\r\nschool-boy defers to an elder on the question of a game of marbles or hop-\r\nscotch.  There was no affectation or play in it; we were both quite in\r\nearnest.  I think I see him now, coming smiling in like a harvest-moon,\r\nbig with some new joke, and then we sat down at the desk and \"edited.\"\r\nHow we would sit and mutually and admiringly read to one another our\r\nbeautiful \"good things,\" the world forgetting, by the world forgot!  And\r\nyet I declare that never till this instant did the great joke of it all\r\never occur to me--that two men of our experiences could be so simply\r\npleased!  Those humorous columns, collected and republished in a book,\r\nmight truly bear on the title-page, \"By Barnum and Hans Breitmann.\"  And\r\nwe were both of the opinion that it really would make a very nice book\r\nindeed.  We were indeed both \"boys\" over it at play.\r\n\r\nThe entire American press expected, as a matter of course, that the\r\n_Illustrated News_ would be simply an advertisement for the great\r\nshowman, and, as I represented to Mr. Barnum, this would ere long utterly\r\nruin the publication.  I do not now really know whether I was quite right\r\nin this, but it is very much to Mr. Barnum's credit that he never\r\ninsisted on it, and that in his own paper he was conspicuous by his\r\nabsence.  And here I will say that, measured by the highest and most\r\nrefined standard, there was more of the gentleman in Phineas T. Barnum\r\nthan the world imagined, and very much more than there was in a certain\r\nyoung man in good society who once expressed in my hearing disgust at the\r\nidea of even speaking to \"the showman.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher was a great friend of Barnum and the Beaches, of which\r\nsome one wrote--\r\n\r\n   \"No wonder Mr. Alfred Beach\r\n      Prefers, as noblest preacher,\r\n   A man who is not only Beach,\r\n      But even more so--Beecher.\"\r\n\r\nHe came very frequently into our office; but I cannot recall any saying\r\nof his worth recording.\r\n\r\nThere was also a brother of H. W. Longfellow, a clergyman, who often\r\nvisited me, of whom I retain a most agreeable recollection.\r\n\r\nThe newsboys who clustered round the outer door were divided in opinion\r\nas to me.  One party thought I was Mr. Barnum, and treated me with\r\nprofound respect.  The other faction cried aloud after me, \"Hy! you ---\r\n---!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum wanted me to write his Life.  This would have been amusing\r\nwork and profitable, but I shrunk from the idea of being identified with\r\nit.  I might as well have done it, for I believe that Dr. Griswold\r\nperformed the task, and the public never knew or cared anything about it.\r\nBut my jolly companions at Dan Bixby's used to inquire of me at what hour\r\nwe fed the monkeys, and whether the Great Gyascutus ever gave me any\r\ntrouble; and I was sensitive to such insinuations.\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Barnum's great moral curiosity was a bearded lady, a\r\njolly and not bad-looking Frenchwoman, whose beard was genuine enough, as\r\nI know, having pulled it.  My own beard has been described by a French\r\nnewspaper as _une barbe de Charlemagne_, a very polite pun, but hers was\r\nmuch fuller.  It was soft as floss silk.  After a while the capillary\r\nattraction ceased to draw, and Mr. Barnum thought of an admirable plan to\r\nrevive it.  He got somebody to prosecute him for false pretences and\r\nimposture, on the ground that Madame was a man.  Then Mr. Barnum had,\r\nwith the greatest unwillingness and many moral apologies, a medical\r\nexamination; they might as sensibly have examined Vashishta's cow to find\r\nout if it was an Irish bull.  Then came the attack on the impropriety of\r\nthe whole thing, and finally Mr. Barnum's triumphant surrebutter, showing\r\nhe had most unwillingly been _goaded_ by the attacks of malevolent\r\nwretches into an unavoidable course of defence.  Of course, spotless\r\ninnocence came out triumphant.  Mr. Barnum's system of innocence was\r\ntruly admirable.  When he had concocted some monstrous cock-and-bull\r\ncuriosity, he was wont to advertise that \"it was with very great\r\nreluctance that he presented this unprecedented marvel to the world, as\r\ndoubts had been expressed as to its genuineness--doubts inspired by the\r\nactually apparently incredible amount of attraction in it.  All that we\r\nask of an enlightened and honest public is, that it will pass a fair\r\nverdict and decide whether it be a humbug or not.\"  So the enlightened\r\npublic paid its quarters of a dollar, and decided that it _was_ a humbug,\r\nand Barnum abode by their decision, and then sent it to another city to\r\nbe again decided on.\r\n\r\nI returned to Philadelphia, and to my father's house, and occupied myself\r\nwith such odds and ends of magazine and other writing as came in my way,\r\nand always reading and studying.  I was very much depressed at this time,\r\nyet not daunted.  My year in New York had familiarised me with\r\ncharacteristic phases of American life and manners; my father thought I\r\nhad gone through a severe mill with rather doubtful characters, and once\r\nremarked that I should not judge too harshly of business men, for I had\r\nbeen unusually unfortunate in my experience.\r\n\r\nA not unfrequent visitor at our house in Philadelphia was our near\r\nneighbour, Henry C. Carey, the distinguished scholar and writer on\r\npolitical economy, who had been so extensively robbed of ideas by\r\nBastiat, and who retook his own, not without inflicting punishment.  He\r\nwas a handsome, black-eyed, white-haired man, with a very piercing\r\nglance.  During the war, when men were sad and dull, and indeed till his\r\ndeath, Mr. Carey's one glorious and friendly extravagance was to assemble\r\nevery Sunday afternoon all his intimates, including any distinguished\r\nstrangers, at his house, round a table, in rooms magnificently hung with\r\npictures, and give everybody, _ad libitum_, hock which cost him sixteen\r\nshillings a bottle.  I occasionally obliged him by translating for him\r\nGerman letters, &c., and he in return revised my pamphlet on\r\nCentralization _versus_ State Rights in 1863.  H. C. Baird, a very able\r\nwriter of his school, was his nephew.  The latter had two or three\r\nsisters, whom I recall as charming girls while I was a law-student.  There\r\nwere many beauties in Philadelphia in those days, and prominent at the\r\ntime, though as yet a schoolgirl, was the since far-famed Emily\r\nSchaumberg, albeit I preferred Miss Belle Fisher, a descendant maternally\r\nof the famous Callender beauties, and by her father's side allied to Miss\r\nVining, the American Queen of Beauty during the Revolution at\r\nWashington's republican court.  There was also a Miss Lewis, whose great\r\nfuture beauty I predicted while as yet a child, to the astonishment of a\r\nfew, \"which prophecy was marvellously fulfilled.\"  Also a Miss Wharton,\r\nsince deceased, on whom George Boker after her death wrote an exquisite\r\npoem.  The two were, each of their kind, of a beauty which I have rarely,\r\nif ever, seen equalled, and certainly never surpassed, in Italy.  How I\r\ncould extend the list of those too good and fair to live, who have passed\r\naway from my knowledge!--Miss Nannie Grigg--Miss Julia Biddle!--_Mais ou\r\nsont les neiges d'antan_?\r\n\r\nThus far my American experiences had not paid well.  I reflected that if\r\nI had remained in Paris I should have done far better.  When I left, I\r\nknew that the success of Louis Napoleon was inevitable.  Three newspapers\r\ndevoted to him had appeared on the Boulevards in one day.  There was\r\nmoney at work, and workmen such as lived in the Hotel de Luxembourg,\r\ngentlemen who could not only plan barricades but fight at them, were in\r\ngreat demand, as _honest_ men always are in revolutions.  Louis Napoleon\r\nwas very anxious indeed to attach to him the men of February, and many\r\nwho had not done one-tenth or one-twentieth of what I had, had the door\r\nof fortune flung wide open to them.  My police-_dossier_ would have been\r\nliterally a diploma of honour under the new Empire, for, after all, the\r\nmen of February, Forty-eight, were the ones who led off, and who all bore\r\nthe highest reputation for honour.  All that I should have required would\r\nhave been some ambitious man of means to aid--and such men abound in\r\nParis--to have risen fast and high.  As it turned out, it was just as\r\nwell in the end that I neither went in as a political adventurer under\r\nLouis Napoleon, nor wrote the Life of Barnum.  But no one knew in those\r\ndays how Louis would turn out.\r\n\r\nI have but one word to add to this.  The secret of the Revolution of\r\nFebruary had been in very few hands, which was the secret of its success.\r\nAny one of us could have secured fortune and \"honours,\" or at least\r\n\"orders,\" by betraying it.  But we would as soon have secured orders for\r\nthe pit of hell as done so.  This was known to Louis Napoleon, and he\r\nmust have realised who these men of iron integrity were for he was very\r\ncurious and inquiring on this subject.  Now, I here claim it as a great,\r\nas a surpassing honour for France, and as something absolutely without\r\nparallel in history, that several hundred men could be found who could\r\nnot only keep this secret, but manage so very wisely as they did.  Louis\r\nBlanc was an example of these honest, unselfish men.  I came to know him\r\npersonally many years after, during his exile in London.\r\n\r\nOne morning George H. Boker came to me and informed me that there was a\r\nwriting editor wanted on the Philadelphia _Evening Bulletin_.  Its\r\nproprietor was Alexander Cummings.  The actual editor was Gibson\r\nBannister Peacock, who was going to Europe for a six months' tour, and\r\nsome one was wanted to take his place.  Mr. Peacock, as I subsequently\r\nfound, was an excellent editor, and a person of will and character.  He\r\nwas skilled in music and a man of culture.  I retain grateful\r\nremembrances of him.  I was introduced and installed.  With all my\r\nexperience I had not yet quite acquired the art of extemporaneous\r\neditorial composition.  My first few weeks were a severe trial, but I\r\nsucceeded.  I was expected to write one column of leader every day,\r\nreview books, and \"paragraph\" or condense articles to a brief item of\r\nnews.  In which I succeeded so well, that some time after, when a work\r\nappeared on writing for the press, the author, who did not know me at\r\nall, cited one of my leaders and one of my paragraphs as models.  It\r\nactually made little impression on me at the time--I was so busy.\r\n\r\nI had been at work but a short time, when one day Mr. Cummings received a\r\nletter from Mr. Peacock in Europe, which he certainly had hardly glanced\r\nat, which he threw to me to read.  I did so, and found in it a passage to\r\nthis effect: \"I am sorry that you are disappointed as to Mr. Leland, but\r\nI am confident that you will find him perfectly capable in time.\"  This\r\ngave me a bitter pang, but I returned it to Mr. Cummings, who soon after\r\ncame into the office and expressed frankly his great regret, saying that\r\nsince he had written to Mr. Peacock he had quite changed his opinion.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this new life to the utmost.  Mr. Cummings, to tell the truth,\r\npursued a somewhat tortuous course in politics and religion.  He was a\r\nMethodist.  One day our clerk expressed himself as to the latter in these\r\nwords:--\"They say he is a Jumper, but others think he has gone over to\r\nthe Holy Rollers.\"  The Jumpers were a sect whose members, when the Holy\r\nSpirit seized them, jumped up and down, while the Holy Rollers under such\r\ncircumstances rolled over and over on the floor.  We also advocated\r\nNative Americanism and Temperance, which did not prevent Mr. Peacock and\r\nmyself and a few _habitues_ of the office from going daily at eleven\r\no'clock to a neighbouring lager-beer _Wirthschaft_ for a refreshing glass\r\nand lunch.  One day the bar-tender, Hermann, a very nice fellow, said to\r\nme, \"I remember when you always had a bottle of Rudesheimer every day for\r\ndinner.  That was at Herr Lehr's, in Heidelberg.  I always waited on\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever shall write a history of Philadelphia from the Thirties to the\r\nend of the Fifties will record a popular period of turbulence and\r\noutrages so extensive as to now appear almost incredible.  These were so\r\ngreat as to cause grave doubts in my mind whether the severest despotism,\r\nguided by justice, would not have been preferable to such republican\r\nlicense as then prevailed in the city of Penn.  I refer to the absolute\r\nand uncontrolled rule of the Volunteer Fire Department, which was divided\r\ninto companies (each having clumsy old fire apparatus and hose), all of\r\nthem at deadly feud among themselves, and fighting freely with pistols,\r\nknives, iron spanners, and slung shot, whenever they met, whether at\r\nfires or in the streets.  Of these regular firemen, _fifty thousand_ were\r\nenrolled, and to these might have been added almost as many more, who\r\nwere known as runners, bummers, and hangers-on.  Among the latter were a\r\ngreat number of incendiaries, all of whom were well known to and\r\nencouraged by the firemen.  Whenever the latter wished to meet some rival\r\ncompany, either to test their mutual skill or engage in a fight, a fire\r\nwas sure to occur; the same always happened when a fire company from some\r\nother city visited Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis gave occasion to an incredible amount of blackmailing, since all\r\nhouse-owners were frequently called on to contribute money to the\r\ndifferent companies, sometimes as a subscription for ball-tickets or\r\nrepairs.  It was well understood, and generally pretty plainly expressed,\r\nthat those who refused to pay might expect to be burned out or neglected.\r\nThe result of it all was a general fear of the firemen, a most degrading\r\nand contemptible subservience to them by politicians of all kinds, a\r\nterrible and general growth and spread of turbulence and coarse vulgarity\r\namong youth, and finally, such a prevalence of conflagration that no one\r\nwho owned a house could hear the awful tones of the bell of Independence\r\nHall without terror.  Fires were literally of nightly occurrence, and\r\nthat they were invariably by night was due to the incendiary \"runner.\"  A\r\nslight examination of the newspapers and cheap broadside literature of\r\nthat time will amply confirm all that I here state.  \"Jakey\" was the\r\ntypical fireman; he was the brutal hero of a vulgar play, and the ideal\r\nof nineteen youths out of twenty.  For a generation or more all society\r\nfelt the degrading influences of this rowdyism in almost every circle--for\r\nthere were among the vast majority of men not very many who respected,\r\nlooked up to, or cared for anything really cultured or refined.  I have a\r\nlarge collection of the popular songs of Philadelphia of that time, in\r\nall of which there is a striving downwards into blackguardism and\r\nbrutality, vileness and ignorance, which has no parallel in the\r\nliterature of any other nation.  The French of the _Pere Duchene_ school\r\nmay be nastier, and, as regards aristocrats, as bloody, but for general\r\nall-round _vulgarity_, the state of morals developed among the people at\r\nthe time of which I speak was literally without its like.  It is very\r\nstrange that Pliny also speaks of the turbulence or rowdyism of the\r\nfiremen of Rome.\r\n\r\nI remember that even in Walnut Street, below Thirteenth Street, before my\r\nfather's house (this being then by far the most respectable portion of\r\nPhiladelphia), it happened several nights in succession that rival fire-\r\ncompanies, running side by side, fought as they ran, with torches and\r\nknives, while firing pistols.  There was a young lady named Mary Bicking,\r\nwho lived near us.  I asked her one day if she had ever seen a man shot;\r\nand when she answered \"No,\" I replied, \"Why don't you look out of your\r\nwindow some night and see one?\"\r\n\r\nThe southern part of the city was a favourite battleground, and I can\r\nremember hearing ladies who lived in Pine Street describe how, on Sunday\r\nsummer afternoons, they could always hear, singly or in volleys, the\r\nshots of the revolvers and shouts of the firemen as they fought in\r\nMoyamensing.\r\n\r\nEvery effort to diminish these evils, or to improve the fire department\r\nin any way whatever, was vigorously opposed by the rowdies, who\r\ncompletely governed the city.  The first fire-alarm electric telegraphs\r\nwere a great offence to firemen, and were quietly destroyed; the steam-\r\nengines were regarded by them as deadly enemies.  But the first great\r\nefficient reform in the Philadelphia fire department, and the most\r\nradical of all, was the establishment of a fire-detective department\r\nunder a fire-marshal, whose business it was to investigate and punish all\r\ncases of incendiarism.  For it was simply incendiarism, encouraged and\r\nsupported by the firemen themselves, which caused nineteen-twentieths of\r\nall these disasters; it was the _fires_ which were the sole support of\r\nthe whole system.\r\n\r\nI was much indebted for understanding all this, and acting on it boldly,\r\nas I did, to the city editor and chief reporter on the _Evening\r\nBulletin_, Caspar Souder.  The Mayor of the city was Richard Vaux, a man\r\nof good family and education, and one who had seen in his time cities and\r\nmen, he having once in his youth, on some great occasion, waltzed with\r\nthe Princess--now Queen--Victoria.  Being popular, he was called _Vaux\r\npopuli_.  I wrote very often leaders urging Mayor Vaux by name to\r\nestablish a fire-detective department.  So great was the indignation\r\ncaused among the firemen, that I incurred no small risk in writing them.\r\nBut at last, when I published for one week an article every day\r\nclamouring for a reform, Mayor Vaux--as he said directly to Mr. Souder,\r\n\"in consequence of my appeals\"--vigorously established a fire-marshal\r\nwith two aids.  By my request, the office was bestowed on a very\r\nintelligent and well-educated person, Dr. Blackburne, who had been a\r\nsurgeon in the Mexican war, then a reporter on our journal, and finally a\r\nvery clever superior detective.  He was really not only a born detective,\r\nbut to a marked degree a man of scientific attainments and a skilled\r\nstatistician.  His anecdotes and comments as to pyromaniacs of different\r\nkinds were as entertaining and curious as anything recorded by Gaboriau.\r\nSome of the most interesting experiences of my life were when I went with\r\nDr. Blackburne from place to place where efforts had been made to burn\r\nhouses, and noted the unerring and Red-Indian skill with which he\r\ndistinguished the style of work, and identified the persons and names of\r\nthe incendiaries.  One of these \"fire-bugs\" was noted for invariably\r\nsetting fire to houses in such a manner as to destroy as many inmates as\r\npossible.  If there were an exit, he would block it up.  Dr. Blackburne\r\ntook me to a wooden house in which the two staircases led to a very small\r\nvestibule about three feet square before the front door.  This space had\r\nbeen filled with diabolical ingenuity with a barrel full of combustibles,\r\nso that every one who tried to escape by the only opening below would be\r\nsure to perish.  Fortunately, the combustibles in the barrel went out\r\nafter being ignited.  \"I know that fellow by his style,\" remarked the\r\nDoctor, \"and I shall arrest him at four o'clock this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThis fire-detective department and the appointment of Blackburne was the\r\nreal basis and beginning of all the reforms which soon followed, leading\r\nto the abolition of the volunteer system and the establishment of paid\r\n_employes_.  And as I received great credit for it then, my work being\r\nwarmly recognised and known to all the newspaper reporters and editors in\r\nthe city, who were the best judges of it, as they indeed are of all\r\nmunicipal matters, I venture to record it here as something worth\r\nmentioning.  And though I may truly say that at the time I was so busy\r\nthat I made no account of many such things, they now rise up from time to\r\ntime as comforting assurances that my life has not been quite wasted.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me that I had not been very long on the newspaper, and had\r\njust begun to throw out editorials with ease, when Mr. Cummings said to\r\nme one day that I did not realise what a power I held in my hand, but\r\nthat I would soon find it out.  Almost immediately after, in noticing\r\nsome article or book which was for sale at No. 24 Chestnut Street, I\r\ninadvertently made reference to 24 Walnut Street.  Very soon came the\r\nproprietor of the latter place, complaining that I had made life a burden\r\nto him, because fifty people had come in one day to buy something which\r\nhe had not.  I reflected long and deeply on this, with the result of\r\nobserving that to influence people it is not at all necessary to argue\r\nwith them, but simply be able to place before their eyes such facts as\r\nyou choose.  It is very common indeed to hear people in England, who\r\nshould have more sense, declare that \"nobody minds what the newspapers\r\nsay.\"  But the truth is, that if any man has an eye to read and memory to\r\nretain, he _must_, willy-nilly, be influenced by reading, and selection\r\nfrom others by an able editor is often only a most ingenious and artful\r\nmethod of arguing.  It has very often happened to me, when I wanted to\r\nenforce some important point, to clothe it as an anecdote or innocent\r\n\"item,\" and bid the foreman set it in the smallest type in the most\r\nobscure corner.  And the reader is influenced by it, utterly\r\nunconsciously, just as we all are, and just as surely as all reflection\r\nfollows sensation--as it ever will--into the Ages!\r\n\r\nThere was much mutual robbing by newspapers of telegraphic news in those\r\ndays.  Once it befell that just before the _Bulletin_ went to press a\r\npart of the powder-mills of Dupont Brothers in Delaware blew up, and we\r\nreceived a few lines of telegram, stating that Mr. Dupont himself had\r\nsaved the great magazine by actually walking on a burning building with\r\nbuckets of water, and preventing the fire from extending, at a most\r\nincredible risk of his life.  Having half-an-hour's time, I expanded this\r\ntelegram into something dramatic and thrilling.  A great New York\r\nnewspaper, thinking, from the shortness of time which elapsed in\r\npublishing, that it was all telegraphed to us, printed it as one of its\r\nown from Delaware, just as I had written it out--which I freely forgive,\r\nfor verily its review of my last work but one was such as to make me\r\ninquire of myself in utter amazement, \"Can this be I?\"--\"so gloriously\r\nwas I exalted to the higher life.\"  The result of this review was a sworn\r\nand firm determination on my part to write another book of the same kind,\r\nin which I should show myself more worthy of such cordial encouragement;\r\nwhich latter book was the \"Etruscan Legends.\"  I ought indeed to have\r\ndedicated it to the _New York Tribune_, a journal which has done more for\r\nhuman freedom than any other publication in history.\r\n\r\nI do not know certainly whether the brave Dupont whom I mentioned was the\r\nCharley Dupont who went to school with me at Jacob Pierce's, nor can I\r\ndeclare that a very gentlemanly old Frenchman who came to see him in 1832\r\nwas his father or grandfather, the famous old Dupont de l'Eure of the\r\nFrench Revolution.  But I suppose it was the latter who carried and\r\ntransformed the art of manufacturing moral gunpowder in France to the\r\nmaking material explosives in America.  Yes, moral or physical, we are\r\nall but gunpowder and smoke--_pulvis et umbra sumus_!\r\n\r\nThere was a morning paper in Philadelphia which grieved me sore by\r\npilfering my news items as I wrote them.  So I one day gave a marvellous\r\naccount of the great Volatile Chelidonian or Flying Turtle of Surinam, of\r\nwhich a specimen had just arrived in New York.  It had a shell as of\r\ndiamonds blent with emeralds and rubies, and bat-like wings of iridescent\r\nhue surpassing the opal, and a tail like a serpent.  Our contemporary,\r\nnothing doubting, at once published this as original matter in a letter\r\nfrom New York, and had to bear the responsibility.  But I did not invest\r\nmy inventiveness wisely; I should have shared the idea with Barnum.\r\n\r\nThere was in Philadelphia at this time a German bookseller named\r\nChristern.  It was the thought of honourable and devoted men which\r\nrecalled him to my mind.  I had made his acquaintance long before in\r\nMunich, where he had been employed in the principal bookseller's shop of\r\nthe city.  His \"store\" in Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, became a kind of\r\nclub, where I brought such of my friends as were interested in German\r\nliterature.  We met there and talked German, and examined and discussed\r\nall the latest European works.  He had a burly, honest, rather droll\r\nassistant named Ruhl, who had been a student in Munich, then a\r\nRevolutionist and exile, and finally a refugee to America.  To this shop,\r\ntoo, came Andrekovitch, whom I had last known in Paris as a speculator on\r\nthe Bourse, wearing a cloak lined with sables.  In America he became a\r\nchemical manufacturer.  When at last an amnesty was proclaimed, his\r\nbrother asked him to return to Poland, promising a support, which he\r\ndeclined.  He too was an honourable, independent man.  About this time\r\nthe great--I forget his name; or was it Schoffel?--who had been President\r\nof the Frankfort Revolutionary Parliament, opened a lager-beer\r\nestablishment in Race Street.  I went there several times with Ruhl.\r\n\r\nGeorge Boker and Frank Wells, who subsequently succeeded me on the\r\n_Bulletin_, would drop in every day after the first edition had gone to\r\npress, and then there would be a lively time.  Frank Wells was, _par\r\neminence_, the greatest punster Philadelphia ever produced.  He was in\r\nthis respect appalling.  We had a sub-editor or writer named Ernest\r\nWallace, who was also a clever humorist.  One day John Godfrey Saxe came\r\nin.  He was accustomed among country auditors and in common sanctums to\r\ncarry everything before him with his jokes.  In half-an-hour we\r\nextinguished him.  Having declared that no one could make a pun on his\r\nname, which he had not heard before, Wallace promptly replied, \"It's\r\n_axing_ too much, I presume; but did you ever hear _that_?\"  Saxe owned\r\nthat he had not.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Boker, whose name deserves a very high place in American\r\nliterature as a poet, and in history as one who was of incredible\r\nservice, quietly performed, in preserving the Union during the war, was\r\nalso eminently a wit and humorist.  We always read first to one another\r\nall that we wrote.  He had so trained himself from boyhood to\r\nself-restraint, calmness, and the _nil admirari_ air, which, as Dallas\r\nsaid, is \"the Corinthian ornament of a gentleman\" (I may add especially\r\nwhen of Corinthian brass), that his admirable jests, while they gained in\r\nclearness and applicability, lost something of that rattle of the\r\nimpromptu and headlong which renders Irish and Western humour so easy.  I\r\nrecorded the _bon mots_ and merry stories which passed among us all in\r\nthe _sanctum_ in articles for our weekly newspaper, under the name of\r\n\"Social Hall Sketches\" (a social hall in the West is a steamboat smoking-\r\nroom).  Every one of us received a name.  Mr. Peacock was Old Hurricane,\r\nand George Boker, being asked what his pseudonym should be, selected that\r\nof Bullfrog.  These \"Social Hall Sketches\" had an extended circulation in\r\nAmerican newspapers, some for many years.  One entirely by me, entitled\r\n\"Opening Oysters,\" is to be found in English almanacs, &c., to this day.\r\n\r\nIt was, I think, or am sure, in 1855 that some German in Pennsylvania,\r\ninstead of burying his deceased wife, burned the body.  This called forth\r\na storm of indignant attack in the newspapers.  It was called an\r\nirreligious, indecent act.  I wrote an editorial in which I warmly\r\ndefended it.  According to Bulwer in the \"Last Days of Pompeii,\" the\r\nearly Christians practised it.  Even to this day Urns and torches are\r\ncommon symbols in Christian burying-grounds, and we speak of \"ashes\" as\r\nmore decent than mouldering corpses.  And, finally, I pointed out the\r\ngreat advantage which it would be to the coal trade of Pennsylvania.  A\r\nman of culture said to me that it was the boldest editorial which he had\r\never read.  Such as it was, I believe that it was the first article\r\nwritten in modern times advocating cremation.  If I am wrong, I am\r\nwilling to be corrected.\r\n\r\nTo those who are unfamiliar with it, the life in an American newspaper\r\noffice seems singularly eventful and striking.  A friend of mine who\r\nvisited a sanctum (ours) for the first time, said, as he left, that he\r\nhad never experienced such an interesting hour in his life.  _Firstly_,\r\ncame our chief city reporter, exulting in the manner in which he had\r\ncircumvented the police, and, despite all their efforts, got, by ways\r\nthat were dark, at all the secrets of a brand-new horrible murder.\r\n_Secondly_, a messenger with an account of how I, individually, had\r\nkicked up the very devil in the City Councils, and set the Mayor to\r\ncondemning us, by a leader discussing certain municipal abuses.\r\n_Thirdly_, another, to tell how I had swept one-half the city by an\r\narticle exposing its neglect, and how the sweepers and dirt-carts were\r\nbusy where none had been before for weeks, and how the contractor for\r\ncleaning wanted to shoot me.  _Fourthly_, a visit from some great\r\ndignitary, who put his dignity very much _a l'abri_ in his pocket, to\r\nsolicit a puff.  _Fifthly_, a lady who, having written a very feeble\r\nvolume of tales which had merely been gently commended in our columns,\r\ncame round in a rage to shame me by sarcasm, begging me as a parting shot\r\nto at least _read_ a few lines of her work.  _Sixthly_, a communication\r\nfrom a great New York family, who, having been requested to send a short\r\ndescription of a remarkable wedding-cake, sent me _one hundred and fifty\r\npages_ of minute history of all their ancestors and honours, with strict\r\ndirections that not a line should be omitted, and the article printed at\r\nonce most conspicuously. {225}  _Seventhly_, . . . but this is a very\r\nmild specimen of what went on all the time during office-hours.  And on\r\nthis subject alone I could write a small book.\r\n\r\nNow, at this time there came about a very great change in my life, or an\r\nevent which ultimately changed it altogether.  My father had, for about\r\ntwo years past, fallen into a very sad state of mind.  His large property\r\nbetween Chestnut and Bank Streets paid very badly, and his means became\r\nlimited.  I was seriously alarmed as to his health.  My dear mother had\r\nbecome, I may say, paralytic; but, in truth, the physicians could never\r\nexplain the disorder.  To the last she maintained her intellect, and a\r\nmiraculous cheerfulness unimpaired.\r\n\r\nAll at once a strange spirit, as of new life, came suddenly over my\r\nfather.  I cannot think of it without awe.  He went to work like a young\r\nman, shook off his despair, financiered with marvellous ability, borrowed\r\nmoney, collected old and long-despaired of debts, tore down the old hotel\r\nand the other buildings, planned and bargained with architects--it was\r\nthen that I designed the facade before described--and built six stores,\r\ntwo of them very handsome granite buildings, on the old site.  In short,\r\nhe made of it a very valuable estate.  And as he superintended with great\r\nskill and ability the smallest details of the building, which was for\r\nthat time remarkably well executed, I thought I recognised whence it was\r\nthat I derived the strongly developed tendency for architecture which I\r\nhave always possessed.  I have since made 400 copies of old churches in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThis was a happy period, when life was without a cloud, excepting my\r\nmother's trouble.  As my father could now well afford it, he made me an\r\nallowance, which, with my earnings from the _Bulletin_ and other\r\noccasional literary work, justified me in getting married.  I had had a\r\nlong but still very happy engagement.  So we were married by the\r\nEpiscopal ceremony at the house of my father-in-law in Tenth Street, and\r\na very happy wedding it was.  I remember two incidents.  Before the\r\nceremony, the Reverend Mr., subsequently Bishop Wilmer, took me, with\r\nGeorge Boker, into a room and explained to me the symbolism of the\r\nmarriage-ring.  Now, if there was a subject on earth which I, the old\r\nfriend of Creuzer of Heidelberg, and master of Friedrich's _Symbolik_,\r\nand Durandus, and the work \"On Finger-Rings,\" knew all about, it was\r\n_that_; and I never shall forget the droll look which Boker threw at me\r\nas the discourse proceeded.  But I held my peace, though sadly tempted to\r\nset forth my own archaeological views on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe second was this: Philadelphia, as Mr. Philipps has said, abounds in\r\nfolk-lore.  Some one suggested that the wedding would be a lucky one\r\nbecause there was only one clergyman present.  But I remarked that among\r\nour coloured waiters there was one who had a congregation (my wife's\r\ncousin, by the way, had a coloured bishop for coachman).  However, this\r\nsable cloud did not disturb us.\r\n\r\nWe went to New York, and were visited by many friends, and returned to\r\nPhiladelphia.  We lived for the first year at the La Pierre Hotel, where\r\nwe met with many pleasant people, such as Thackeray, Thalberg, Ole Bull,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Choteau, of St. Louis, and others.  Of Thalberg I have\r\nalready remarked, in my notes to my translation of Heine's _Salon_, that\r\nhe impressed me as a very gentlemanly, dignified, and quietly remarkable\r\nman, whom it would be difficult to readily or really understand.  \"He had\r\nunmistakably the manner peculiar to many great Germans, which, as I have\r\nelsewhere observed, is perceptible in the _maintien_ and features of\r\nGoethe, Humboldt, Bismarck,\" and Brugsch, of Berlin (whom I learned to\r\nknow in later years).  Thalberg gave me the impression, which grew on me,\r\nof a man who knew many things besides piano-playing, and that he was born\r\nto a higher specialty.  He was dignified but affable.  I remember that\r\none day, when he, or some one present, remarked that his name was not a\r\ncommon one, I made him laugh by declaring that it occurred in two pieces\r\nin an old German ballad:--\r\n\r\n   \"Ich that am BERGE stehen,\r\n      Und sohaute in das THAL;\r\n   Da hab' ich sie gesehen,\r\n      Zum aller letzten mal.\"\r\n\r\n   \"I stood upon the _mountain_,\r\n      And looked the _valley_ o'er;\r\n   There I indeed beheld her,\r\n      But saw her never more.\"\r\n\r\nThalberg's playing was marvellously like his character or himself: Heine\r\ncalls it gentlemanly.  Thackeray was marked in his manner, and showed\r\nimpulse and energy in small utterances.  I may err, but I do not think he\r\ncould have endured solitude or too much of himself.  He was eminently\r\nsocial, and rather given at times to reckless (not deliberate or\r\nspiteful), sarcastic or \"ironic\" sallies, in which he did not, with\r\nAmericans, generally come off \"first best.\"  There was a very beautiful\r\nlady in Boston with whom the great novelist was much struck, and whom he\r\ngreatly admired, as he sent her two magnificent bronzes.  Having dined\r\none evening at her house, he remarked as they all entered the\r\ndining-room, \"Now I suppose that, according to your American custom, we\r\nshall all put our feet up on the chimney-piece.\"  \"Certainly,\" replied\r\nhis hostess, \"and as your legs are so much longer than the others, you\r\nmay put your feet on top of the looking-glass,\" which was about ten feet\r\nfrom the ground.  Thackeray, I was told, was offended at this, and showed\r\nit; he being of the \"give but not take\" kind.  One day he said to George\r\nBoker, when both were looking at Durer's etching of \"Death, Knight, and\r\nthe Devil,\" of which I possess a fine copy, \"Every man has his devil whom\r\nhe cannot overcome; I have two--laziness, and love of pleasure.\"  I\r\nremarked, \"Then why the devil seek to overcome them?  Is it not more\r\nnoble and sensible to yield where resistance is in vain, than to fight to\r\nthe end?  Is it not a maxim of war, that he who strives to defend a\r\ndefenceless place must be put to death?  Why not give in like a man?\"\r\n\r\nI had just published my translation of Heine's _Reisebilder_, and Bayard\r\nTaylor had a copy of it.  He went in company with Thackeray to New York,\r\nand told me subsequently that they had read the work aloud between them\r\nalternately with roars of laughter till it was finished; that Thackeray\r\npraised my translation to the skies, and that his comments and droll\r\nremarks on the text were delightful.  Thackeray was a perfect German\r\nscholar, and well informed as to all in the book.\r\n\r\nApropos of Heine, Ole Bull had known him very well, and described to me\r\nhis brilliancy in the most distinguished literary society, where in\r\nFrench the German wit bore away the palm from all Frenchmen.  \"He flashed\r\nand sprayed in brilliancy like a fountain.\"  Ole Bull by some chance had\r\nheard much of me, and we became intimate.  He told me that I had\r\nunwittingly been to him the cause of great loss.  I had, while in London,\r\nbecome acquainted with an odd and rather scaly fish, a German who had\r\nbeen a courier, who was the keeper of a small cafe near Leicester Square,\r\nand who enjoyed a certain fame as the inventor of the _poses plastiques_\r\nor living statues, so popular in 1848.  This man soon came over to\r\nAmerica, and called on me, wanting to borrow money, whereupon I gave him\r\nthe cold shoulder.  According to Ole Bull, he went to the great\r\nviolinist, represented himself as my friend and as warmly commended by\r\nme, and the heedless artist, instead of referring to me directly, took\r\nhim as impresario; the result being that he ere long ran away with the\r\nmoney, and, what was quite as bad, Ole Bull's prima-donna, who was, as I\r\nunderstood, specially dear to him.  Ole Bull's playing has been, as I\r\nthink, much underrated by certain writers of reminiscences.  There was in\r\nit a marvellous originality.\r\n\r\nWhile I was there, in the La Pierre Hotel, the first great meeting was\r\nheld at which the Republican party was organised.  Though not an\r\n_appointed_ delegate from our State, I, as an editor, took some part in\r\nit.  Little did we foresee the tremendous results which were to ensue\r\nfrom that meeting!  It was second only to the signing of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, and on it was based the greatest struggle known to\r\nhistory.  I could have, indeed, been inscribed as a constitutional member\r\nof it for the asking or writing my name, but that appeared to me and\r\nothers then to be a matter of no consequence compared to the work in\r\nhand.  So the _Bulletin_ became Republican; Messrs. Cummings and Peacock\r\nseeing that that was their manifest destiny.\r\n\r\nFrom that day terrible events began to manifest themselves in American\r\npolitics.  The South attempted to seize Kansas with the aid of border\r\nruffians; Sumner was caned from behind while seated; the Southern press\r\nbecame outrageous in its abuse of the North, and the North here and there\r\nretaliated.  All my long-suppressed ardent Abolition spirit now found\r\nvent, and for a time I was allowed to write as I pleased.  A Richmond\r\neditor paid me the compliment of saying that the articles in the\r\n_Bulletin_ were the bitterest and cleverest published in the North, but\r\ninquired if it was wise to manifest such feeling.  I, who felt that the\r\ngreat strife was imminent, thought it was.  Mr. Cummings thought\r\ndifferently, and I was checked.  For years there were many who believed\r\nthat the fearfully growing cancer could be cured with rose-water; as, for\r\ninstance, Edward Everett.\r\n\r\nWhile on the _Bulletin_ I translated Heine's _Pictures of Travel_.  For\r\nit, poetry included, I was to receive three shillings a page.  Even this\r\nwas never paid me in full; I was obliged to take part of the money in\r\nengravings and books, and the publisher failed.  It passed into other\r\nhands, and many thousands of copies were sold; from all of which I, of\r\ncourse, got nothing.  I also became editor of _Graham's Magazine_, which\r\nI filled recklessly with all or any kind of literary matter as I best\r\ncould, little or nothing being allowed for contributions.  However, I\r\nraised the circulation from almost nothing to 17,000.  For this I\r\nreceived fifty dollars (10 pounds) per month.  When I finally left it,\r\nthe proprietors were eighteen months in arrears due, and tried to evade\r\npayment, though I had specified a regular settlement every month.  Finally\r\nthey agreed to pay me in monthly instalments of fifty dollars each, and\r\nfulfilled the engagement.\r\n\r\nTalking of the South, I forget now at what time it was that Barnum's\r\nMuseum in Philadelphia was burned, but I shall never forget a droll\r\nincident which it occasioned.  Opposite it was a hotel, and the heat was\r\nso tremendous that the paint on the hotel was scorched, and it had begun\r\nto burn in places.  By the door stood a friend of mine in great distress.\r\nI asked what was the matter.  He replied that in the hotel was a Southern\r\nlady who would not leave her trunks, in which there were all her diamonds\r\nand other valuables, and that he could not find a porter to bring them\r\ndown.  I was strong enough in those days.  \"What is the number of her\r\nroom?\"  \"No. 22.\"  I rushed up--it was scorching hot by this time--burst\r\ninto No. 22, and found a beautiful young lady in dire distress.  I said\r\nabruptly, \"I come from Mr. --- ---; where are your trunks?\"  She began to\r\ncry confusedly, \"Oh, you can do _nothing_; they are very heavy.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing the two large trunks, I at once, without a word, caught one by\r\neach handle, dragged them after me bumping downstairs, the lady\r\nfollowing, to the door, where I found my friend, who had a carriage in\r\nwaiting.  From the lady's subsequent account, it appeared that I had\r\noccasioned her much more alarm than pleasure.  She said that all at once\r\na great tall gentleman burst into her room, seized her trunks without a\r\nword of apology, and dragged them downstairs like a giant; she was never\r\nso startled in all her life!  It was explained to me that, as in the\r\nSouth only negroes handle trunks, the lady could not regard me exactly as\r\na gentleman.  She was within a short ace of being burnt up, trunks and\r\nall, but could not forget that she was from the \"Sa-outh,\" and must needs\r\nshow it.\r\n\r\nApropos of this occurrence, I remember something odd which took place on\r\nthe night of the same day.  There was a stylish drinking-place, kept by a\r\nman named Guy, in Seventh Street.  In the evening, when it was most\r\ncrowded, there entered a stranger, described as having been fully _seven_\r\nfeet high, and powerful in proportion, who kept very quiet, but who, on\r\nbeing chaffed as the giant escaped from Barnum's Museum, grew angry, and\r\nended by clearing out the barroom--driving thirty men before him like\r\nflies.  Aghast at such a tremendous feat, one who remained, asked, \"Who\r\nin God's wrath are you?--haven't you a name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I _have_ a name,\" replied the Berserker; \"_I'm_ CHARLES LELAND!\"\r\nsaying which he vanished.\r\n\r\nThe next day it was all over Philadelphia that I had cleared out John\r\nGuy's the night before, _sans merci_.  True, I am not seven feet high,\r\nbut some men (like stories) expand enormously when inflated or mad; so my\r\ndenial was attributed to sheer modesty.  But I recognised in the Charles\r\nLeland a mysterious cousin of mine, who was really seven feet high, who\r\nhad disappeared for many years, and of whom I have never heard since.\r\n\r\nWhile editing _Graham's Magazine_, I had one day a space to fill.  In a\r\nhurry I knocked off \"Hans Breitmann's Barty\" (1856).  I gave it no\r\nthought whatever.  Soon after, Clark republished it in the\r\n_Knickerbocker_, saying that it was evidently by me.  I little dreamed\r\nthat in days to come I should be asked in Egypt, and on the blue\r\nMediterranean, and in every country in Europe, if I was its author.  I\r\nwrote in those days a vast number of such anonymous drolleries, many of\r\nthem, I daresay, quite as good, in _Graham's Magazine_ and the _Weekly\r\nBulletin_, &c., but I took no heed of them.  They were probably\r\nappropriated in due time by the authors of \"Beautiful Snow.\"\r\n\r\nI began to weary of Philadelphia.  New York was a wider field and more\r\ncongenial to me.  Mr. Cummings had once, during a financial crisis,\r\nappealed to my better feelings very touchingly to let my salary be\r\nreduced.  I let myself be touched--in the pocket.  Better times came, but\r\nmy salary did not rise.  Mr. Cummings, knowing that my father was\r\nwealthy, wanted me to put a large sum into his paper, assuring me that it\r\nwould pay me fifteen per cent.  I asked how that could be possible when\r\nhe could only afford to pay me so very little for such hard work.  He\r\nchuckled, and said, \"That is the way we make our money.\"  Then I\r\ndetermined to leave.\r\n\r\nMr. George Ripley and Charles A. Dana, of the _Tribune_, were then\r\nediting in New York _Appletons' Cyclopaedia_.  Mr. Ripley had several\r\ntimes shown himself my friend; he belonged to the famous old band of\r\nBoston Transcendentalists who were at Brook Farm.  I wrote to him asking\r\nif I could earn as much at the _Cyclopaedia_ as I got from the\r\n_Bulletin_.  He answered affirmatively; so we packed up and departed.  I\r\nhad a sister in New York who had married a Princeton College-mate named\r\nThorp.  We went to their house in Twenty-second Street near Broadway, and\r\narranged it so as to remain there during the winter.\r\n\r\nIn the _Cyclopaedia_ rooms I found abundance of work, though it was less\r\nprofitable than I expected.  For after an article was written, it passed\r\nthrough the hands of six or seven revisers, who revised not always\r\nwisely, and frequently far too well.  They made their objections in\r\nwriting, and we, the writers, made ours.  I often gained a victory, but\r\nthe victory cost a great deal of work, and of time which was not paid\r\nfor.  Altogether, I wrote about two hundred articles, great and small,\r\nfor the _Cyclopaedia_.  On the other hand, there was pleasant and\r\ncongenial society among my fellow-workmen, and the labour itself was\r\nimmensely instructive.  If any man wishes to be well informed, let him\r\nwork on a cyclopaedia.  As I could read several languages, I was\r\nadditionally useful at times.  The greatest conciseness of style is\r\nrequired for such work.  In German cyclopaedias this is carried to a\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I began to find that there was much more money to be made\r\noutside the _Cyclopaedia_ than in it.  William H. Hurlbut, whom I had\r\nonce seen so nearly shot, had been the \"foreign editor\" of the _New York\r\nTimes_.  Mr. Henry Raymond, its proprietor, had engaged a Mr. Hammond to\r\ncome after some six months to take his place, and I was asked to fill it\r\n_ad interim_.  I did so, so much to Mr. Raymond's satisfaction, that he\r\nmuch regretted when I left that he had not previously engaged me.  He was\r\nalways very kind to me.  He said that now and then, whenever he wanted a\r\nreally superior art criticism, I should write it.  He was quite right,\r\nfor there were not many reporters in New York who had received such an\r\neducation in aesthetics as mine.  When Patti made her _debut_ in opera\r\nfor the first time, I was the only writer who boldly predicted that she\r\nwould achieve the highest lyrical honours or become a \"star\" of the first\r\nmagnitude.  Apropos of Hurlbut, I heard many years after, in England,\r\nthat a certain well-known _litterateur_, who was not one of his admirers,\r\nhaving seen him seated in close _tete-a-tete_ with a very notorious and\r\nunpopular character, remarked regretfully, \"Just to think that with one\r\npistol-bullet _both_ might have been settled!\"  Hurlbut was, even as a\r\nboy, very handsome, with a pale face and black eyes, and extremely\r\nclever, being _facile princeps_, the head of every class, and extensively\r\nread.  But there was \"a screw loose\" somewhere in him.  He was subject,\r\nbut not very frequently, to such fits of passion or rage, that he\r\nliterally became blind while they lasted.  I saw him one day in one of\r\nthese throw his arms about and stamp on the ground, as if unable to\r\nbehold any one.  I once heard a young lady in New York profess unbounded\r\nadmiration for him, because \"he looked so charmingly like the devil.\"  For\r\nmany years the _New York Herald_ always described him as the Reverend\r\nMephistopheles Hurlbut.  There was another very beautiful lady who\r\nafterwards died a strange and violent death, as also a friend of mine, an\r\neditor in _New_ York, both of whom narrated to me at very great length \"a\r\ngrotesque Iliad of the wild career\" of this remarkable man.\r\n\r\nIt never rains but it pours.  Frank Leslie, who had been with me on\r\nBarnum's _Illustrated News_, was now publishing half-a-dozen periodicals\r\nand newspapers, and offered me a fair price to give him my mornings.  I\r\ndid so.  Unfortunately, my work was not specified, and he retained his\r\nold editors, who naturally enough did not want me, although they treated\r\nme civilly enough.  One of these was Thomas Powell, who had seen a great\r\ndeal of all the great English writers of the last generation.  But there\r\nwas much rather shady, shaky Bohemianism about the frequenters of our\r\nsanctum, and, all things considered, it was a pity that I ever entered\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Und noch weiter_.  There was published in New York at that time (1860)\r\nan illustrated comic weekly called _Vanity Fair_.  There was also in the\r\ncity a kind of irregular club known as the Bohemians, who had been\r\ninspired by Murger's novel of that name to imitate the life of its\r\nheroes.  They met every evening at a lager-beer restaurant kept by a\r\nGerman named Pfaff.  For a year or two they made a great sensation in New\r\nYork.  Their two principal men were Henry Clapp and Fitz-James O'Brien.\r\nThen there were Frank Wood and George Arnold, W. Winter, C. Gardette, and\r\nothers.  Wood edited _Vanity Fair_, and all the rest contributed to it.\r\nThere was some difficulty or other between Wood and Mr. Stephens, the\r\n_gerant_ of the weekly, and Wood left, followed by all the clan.  I was\r\ncalled in in the emergency, and what with writing myself, and the aid of\r\nR. H. Stoddard, T. B. Aldrich, and a few more, we made a very creditable\r\nappearance indeed.  Little by little the Bohemians all came back, and all\r\nwent well.\r\n\r\nNow I must here specify, for good reasons, that I held myself very\r\nstrictly aloof from the Bohemians, save in business affairs.  This was\r\npartly because I was married, and I never saw the day in my life when to\r\nbe regarded as a real Bohemian vagabond, or shiftless person, would not\r\nhave given me the horrors.  I would have infinitely preferred the poorest\r\nsettled employment to such life.  I mention this because a very brilliant\r\nand singular article entitled \"Charles G. Leland _l'ennemi des\r\nAllemands_\" (this title angered me), which appeared in the _Revue des\r\nDeux Mondes_ in 1871, speaks of me by implication as a frequenter of\r\nPfaff's, declaring that I there introduced Artemus Ward to the Bohemian\r\nbrotherhood, and that it was entirely due to me that Mr. Browne was\r\nbrought out before the American World.  This is quite incorrect.  Mr.\r\nBrowne had made a name by two or three very popular sketches before I had\r\never seen him.  But it is very true that I aided him to write, and\r\nsuggested and encouraged the series of sketches which made him famous, as\r\nhe himself frankly and generously declared, for Charles Browne was at\r\nheart an honest gentleman, if there ever was one; which is the one thing\r\nin life better than success.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens realising that I needed an assistant, and observing that\r\nBrowne's two sketches of the Showman's letter and the Mormons had made\r\nhim well known, invited him to take a place in our office.  He was a\r\nshrewd, naif, but at the same time modest and unassuming young man.  He\r\nwas a native of Maine, but familiar with the West.  Quiet as he seemed,\r\nin three weeks he had found out everything in New York.  I could\r\nillustrate this by a very extraordinary fact, but I have not space for\r\neverything.  I proposed to him to continue his sketches.  \"Write,\" I\r\nsaid, \"a paper on the Shakers.\"  He replied that he knew nothing about\r\nthem.  I had been at Lenox, Massachusetts, where I had often gone to New\r\nLebanon and seen their strange worship and dances, and while on the\r\n_Illustrated News_ had had a conference with their elders on an article\r\non the Shakers.  So I told him what I knew, and he wrote it, making it a\r\ncondition that I would correct it.  He wrote the sketch, and others.  He\r\nwas very slow at composition, which seemed strange to me, who was\r\naccustomed to write everything as I now do, _currente calamo_ (having\r\nwritten all these memoirs, so far, within a month--more or less, and\r\ncertainly very little more).  From this came his book.\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote the article describing his imprisonment, there was in it a\r\nsentence, \"Jailor, I shall die unless you bring me something to eat!\"  In\r\nthe proof we found, \"I shall die unless you bring me something to\r\n_talk_.\"  He was just going to correct this, when I cried, \"For Heaven's\r\nsake, Browne, let that stand!  It's best as it is.\"  He did so, and so\r\nthe reader may find it in his work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the awful storm of war had gathered and was about to burst.  I\r\nmay here say that there was a kind of literary club or association of\r\nladies and gentlemen who met once a week of evenings in the Studio\r\nBuildings, where I had many friends, such as Van Brunt, C. Gambrell,\r\nHazeltine, Bierstadt, Gifford, Church, and Mignot.  At this club I\r\nconstantly met General Birney, the great Abolitionist, whose famous\r\ncharge at Gettysburg did so much to decide the battle.  Constant\r\nintercourse with him and with C. A. Dana greatly inspired me in my anti-\r\nslavery views.  The manager of _Vanity Fair_ was very much averse to\r\nabsolutely committing the journal to Republicanism, and I was determined\r\non it.  I had a delicate and very difficult path to pursue, and I\r\nsucceeded, as the publication bears witness.  I went several times to Mr.\r\nDana, and availed myself of his shrewd advice.  Browne, too, agreed\r\npretty fairly with me.  I voted for Abraham Lincoln at the first election\r\nin New York.  I voted _on principle_, for I confess that every\r\nconceivable thing had been said and done to represent him as an ignorant,\r\nungainly, silly Western Hoosier, and even the Republican press had little\r\nor nothing to say as to his good qualities.  Horace Greeley had \"sprung\r\nhim\" on the Convention at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute as the\r\nonly available man, and he had been chosen as our candidate to defeat\r\nDouglas.\r\n\r\nLet me here relate two anecdotes.  When my brother heard of Lincoln's\r\n\"candidacy\" he said--\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why the people shouldn't be allowed to have a President for\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nA Copperhead friend of mine, who was always aiming at \"gentility,\"\r\nremarked to me with an air of disgust on the same subject--\r\n\r\n\"I do _wisht_ we could have a gentleman for President for _oncet_.\"\r\n\r\nThe said Copperhead became in due time a Republican office-holder, and is\r\none yet.\r\n\r\nLincoln was elected.  Then came the storm.  Our rejoicings were short.\r\nSumter was fired on.  Up to that time everybody, including President\r\nLincoln, had quite resolved that, if the South was resolved to secede, it\r\nmust be allowed to depart in peace.  There had been for many years a\r\nconviction that our country was growing to be too large to hold together.\r\nI always despised the contemptible idea.  I had been in correspondence\r\nwith the Russian Iskander or Alexander Herzen, who was a century in\r\nadvance of his time.  He was the real abolisher of serfdom in Russia, as\r\nhistory will yet prove.  I once wrote a very long article urging the\r\nRussian Government to throw open the Ural gold mines to foreigners, and\r\nmake every effort to annex Chinese territory and open a port on the\r\nPacific.  Herzen translated it into Russian (I have a copy of it), and\r\ncirculated twenty thousand copies of it in Russia.  The Czar read it.\r\nHerzen wrote to me: \"It will be pigeon-holed for forty years, and then\r\nperhaps acted on.  The Pacific will be the Mediterranean of the future.\"\r\nWith such ideas I did not believe in the dismemberment of the United\r\nStates. {237}\r\n\r\nBut Sumter was fired on, and the whole North rose in fury.  It was the\r\nsilliest act ever committed.  The South, with one-third of the votes, had\r\ntwo-thirds of all the civil, military, and naval appointments, and every\r\nother new State, and withal half of the North, ready to lick its boots,\r\nand still was not satisfied.  It could not go without giving us a\r\nthrashing.  And that was the drop too much.  So we fought.  And we\r\nconquered; but _how_?  It was all expressed in a few words, which I heard\r\nuttered by a common man at a _Bulletin_ board, on the dreadful day when\r\nwe first read the news of the retreat at Bull Run: \"It's hard--but we\r\nmust buckle up and go at it again.\"  It is very strange that the South\r\nnever understood that among the mud-sills and toiling slaves and factory\r\nserfs of the North the spirit which had made men enrich barren New\r\nEngland and colonise the Western wilderness would make them buckle up and\r\ngo at it again boldly to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nOne evening I met C. A. Dana on Broadway.  War had fairly begun.  \"It\r\nwill last,\" he said, \"not less than four years, but it may extend to\r\nseven.\"\r\n\r\nTrouble now came thick and fast.  _Vanity Fair_ was brought to an end.\r\nFrank Leslie found that he no longer required my services, and paid my\r\ndue, which was far in arrears, in his usual manner, that is, by orders on\r\nadvertisers for goods which I did not want, and for which I was charged\r\ndouble prices.  Alexander Cummings had a very ingenious method of\r\n\"shaving\" when obliged to pay his debts.  His friend Simon Cameron had a\r\nbank--the Middleton--which, if not a very wild cat, was far from tame, as\r\nits notes were always five or ten per cent. below par, to our loss--for\r\nwe were always paid in Middleton.  I have often known the clerk to take a\r\nhandful of notes at par and send out to buy Middleton wherewith to pay\r\nme.  I am sorry to say that such tricks were universal among the very\r\ngreat majority of proprietors with whom I had dealings.  To \"do\" the\r\n_employes_ to the utmost was considered a matter of course, especially\r\nwhen the one employed was a \"literary fellow\" of any kind or an artist.\r\n\r\nI should mention that while in New York I saw a great deal of Bayard\r\nTaylor and his wife.  I had known him since 1850 and was intimate with\r\nhim till his death.  He occupied the same house with the distinguished\r\npoet R. H. Stoddard.  I experienced from both much kindness.  We had\r\namusing Saturday evenings there, where droll plays were improvised, and\r\nadmirable disguises made out of anything.  In after years, in London,\r\nWalter H. Pollock, Minto (recently deceased), and myself, did the same.\r\nOne night, in the latter circle, we played _Hamlet_, but the chief\r\ncharacter was the Sentinel, who stared at the Ghost with such open-jawed\r\nhorror--\"_bouche beante_, _rechignez_!\"--and so prominently, that poor\r\nHamlet was under a cloud.  Pollock's great capuchon overcoat served for\r\nall kinds of mysterious characters.  We were also kindly entertained many\r\na time and oft in New York by Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Dana.\r\n\r\nMy engagement expired on the _Times_--where, by the way, I was paid in\r\nfull in good money--and I found myself without employment in a fearful\r\nfinancial panic.  During the spring and early summer we had lived at the\r\nGramercy Park Hotel; we now went to a very pleasant boarding-house kept\r\nby Mrs. Dunn, on Staten Island.  My old friend, George Ward, and G. W.\r\nCurtis, well known in literature and politics (who had been at Mr.\r\nGreene's school), lived at no great distance from us.  The steamboats\r\nfrom New York to Staten Island got to racing, and I enjoyed it very much,\r\nbut George Ward and some of the milder sort protested against it, and it\r\nwas stopped; which I thought rather hard, for we had very little\r\namusement in those dismal days.  I was once in a steamboat race when our\r\nboat knocked away the paddle-box from the other and smashed the wheel.\r\nFrom the days of the Romans and Norsemen down to the present time, there\r\nwas never any form of amusement discovered so daring, so dangerous, and\r\nso exciting as a steamboat race, and nobody but Americans could have ever\r\ninvented or indulged in it.\r\n\r\nThe old _Knickerbocker Magazine_ had been for a long time running down to\r\nabsolutely nothing.  A Mr. Gilmore purchased it, and endeavoured to\r\ngalvanise it into life.  Its sober grey-blue cover was changed to orange.\r\nMr. Clark left it, to my sorrow; but there was no help for it, for there\r\nwas not a penny to pay him.  I consented to edit it for half ownership,\r\nfor I had an idea.  This was, to make it promptly a strong Republican\r\nmonthly for the time, which was utterly opposed to all of Mr. Clark's\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nI must here remark that the financial depression in the North at this\r\ntime was terrible.  I knew many instances in which landlords begged it as\r\na favour from tenants that they would remain rent-free in their houses.  A\r\nfriend of mine, Mr. Fales, one day took me over two houses in Fifth\r\nAvenue, of which he had been offered his choice for $15,000 each.  Six\r\nmonths after the house sold for $150,000.  Factories and shops were\r\neverywhere closing, and there was a general feeling that far deeper and\r\nmore terrible disasters were coming--war in its worst forms--national\r\ndisintegration--utter ruin.  This spirit of despair was now debilitating\r\neverybody.  The Copperheads or Democrats, who were within a fraction as\r\nnumerous as the Republicans, continually hissed, \"You see to what your\r\nnigger worship has brought the country.  This is all your doing.  And the\r\nworst is to come.\"  Then there was soon developed a class known as\r\nCroakers, who increased to the end of the war.  These were good enough\r\nUnion people, but without any hope of any happy issue in anything, and\r\nwho were quite sure that everything was for the worst in this our most\r\nunfortunate of all wretched countries.  Now it is a law of humanity that\r\nin all great crises, or whenever energy and manliness is needed,\r\npessimism is a benumbing poison, and the strongest optimism the very\r\n_elixir vitae_ itself.  And by a marvellously strange inspiration (though\r\nit was founded on cool, far-sighted calculation), I, at this most\r\ncritical and depressing time, rose to extremest hope and confidence,\r\nrejoicing that the great crisis had at length come, and feeling to my\r\nvery depths of conviction that, as we were sublimely in the right, we\r\nmust conquer, and that the dread portal once passed we should find\r\nourselves in the fairy palace of prosperity and freedom.  But that I was\r\nabsolutely for a time alone amid all men round me in this intense hope\r\nand confidence, may be read as clearly as can be in what I and others\r\npublished in those days, for all of this was recorded in type.\r\n\r\nBayard Taylor had been down to the front, and remarked carelessly to me\r\none day that when he found that there was already a discount of 40 per\r\ncent. on Confederate notes, he was sure that the South would yield in the\r\nend.  This made me think very deeply.  There was no reason, if we could\r\nkeep the Copperheads subdued, why we should not hold our own on our own\r\nterritory.  _Secondly_, as the war went on we should soon win converts.\r\n_Thirdly_, that the North had immense resources--its hay crop alone was\r\nworth more than all the cotton crop of the South.  And _fourthly_, that\r\nwhen manufacturing and contract-making for the army should once begin,\r\nthere would be such a spreading or wasting of money and making fortunes\r\nas the world never witnessed, and that while we grew rich, the South,\r\nwithout commerce or manufactures, must grow poor.\r\n\r\nI felt as if inspired, and I wrote an article entitled, \"Woe to the\r\nSouth.\"  At this time, \"Woe to the North\" was the fear in every heart.  I\r\nshowed clearly that if we would only keep up our hearts, that the utter\r\nruin of the South was inevitable, while that for us there was close at\r\nhand such a period of prosperity as no one ever dreamt of--that every\r\nfactory would soon double its buildings, and prices rise beyond all\r\nprecedent.  I followed this article by others, all in a wild,\r\nenthusiastic style of triumph.  People thought I was mad, and the _New\r\nYork Times_ compared my utterances to the outpourings of a fanatical\r\nPuritan in the time of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nBut they were fulfilled to the letter.  There is no instance that I know\r\nof in which any man ever prophesied so directly in the face of public\r\nopinion and had his predictions so accurately fulfilled.  I was _all\r\nalone_ in my opinions.  At all times a feeling as of awe at myself comes\r\nover me when I think of what I published.  For, with the exception of\r\nGilmore, who had a kind of vague idea that he kept a prophet--as Moses\r\nthe tailor kept a poet--not a soul of my acquaintance believed in all\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThen I went a step further.  I found that the real block in the way of\r\nNorthern union was the disgust which had gathered round the mere _name_\r\nof Abolitionist.  It became very apparent that freeing the slaves would,\r\nas General Birney once said to me, be knocking out the bottom of the\r\nbasket.  And people wanted to abolitionise without being \"Abolitionists\";\r\nand at this time even the _New York Tribune_ became afraid to advocate\r\nanti-slavery, and the greatest fanatics were dumb with fear.\r\n\r\nThen I made a new departure.  I advocated emancipation of the slaves _as\r\na war measure only_, and my cry was \"Emancipation for the sake of the\r\nWhite Man.\"  I urged prompt and vigorous action without any regard to\r\nphilanthropy.  As publishing such views in the _Knickerbocker_ was like\r\npouring the wildest of new wine into the weakest of old bottles, Gilmore\r\nresolved to establish at once in Boston a political monthly magazine to\r\nbe called the _Continental_, to be devoted to this view of the situation.\r\nIt was the only political magazine devoted to the Republican cause\r\npublished during the war.  That it fully succeeded in rapidly attracting\r\nto the Union party a vast number of those who had held aloof owing to\r\ntheir antipathy to the mere word abolition, is positively true, and still\r\nremembered by many. {242}  Very speedily indeed people at large caught at\r\nthe idea.  I remember the very first time when one evening I heard\r\nGovernor Andrews say of a certain politician that he was not an\r\nAbolitionist but an _Emancipationist_; and it was subsequently declared\r\nby my friends in Boston, and that often, that the very bold course taken\r\nby the _Continental Magazine_, and the creation by it of the\r\nEmancipationist wing, had hastened by several months the emancipation of\r\nthe slaves by Abraham Lincoln.  It was for this alone that the University\r\nof Cambridge, Massachusetts, afterwards, through its president, gave me\r\nthe degree of A. M., \"for literary services rendered to the country\r\nduring the war,\" which is as complete a proof of what I assert as could\r\nbe imagined, for this was in very truth the one sole literary service\r\nwhich I performed at that time, and there were many of my great literary\r\nfriends who declared their belief in, and sympathy with, the services\r\nwhich I rendered to the cause.  But I will now cite some facts which\r\nfully and further confirm what I have said.\r\n\r\nThe _Continental Magazine_ was, as I may say, a something more than semi-\r\nofficial organ.  Mr. Seward contributed to it two anonymous articles, or\r\nrather their substance, which were written out and forwarded to me by\r\nOakey Hall, Esq., of New York.  We received from the Cabinet at\r\nWashington continual suggestions, for it was well understood that the\r\n_Continental_ was read by all influential Republicans.  A contributor had\r\nsent us a very important article indeed, pointing out that there was all\r\nthrough the South, from the Mississippi to the sea, a line of mountainous\r\ncountry in which there were few or no slaves, and very little attachment\r\nto the Confederacy.  This article, which was extensively republished,\r\nattracted great attention.  It gave great strength and encouragement to\r\nthe grand plan of the campaign, afterwards realised by Sherman.  By\r\n_official request_, to me directed, the author contributed a second\r\narticle on the subject.  These articles were extensively circulated in\r\npamphlet form or widely copied by the press, and created a great\r\nsensation, forming, in fact, one of the great points made in influencing\r\npublic opinion.  Another of the same kind, but not ours, was the famous\r\npamphlet by Charles Stille, of Philadelphia, \"How a Free People Conduct a\r\nLong War,\" in which it was demonstrated that the man who can hold out\r\nlongest in a fight has the best chance, which simple truth made, however,\r\nan incredible popular impression.  Gilmore and our friends succeeded, in\r\nfact, in making the _Continental Magazine_ \"respected at court.\"  But I\r\nkept my independence and principles, and thundered away so fiercely for\r\n_immediate_ emancipation that I was confidentially informed that Mr.\r\nSeward once exclaimed in a rage, \"Damn Leland and his magazine!\"  But as\r\nhe damned me only officially and in confidence, I took it in the\r\nPickwickian sense.  And at this time I realised that, though I was not\r\npersonally very much before the public, I was doing great and good work,\r\nand, as I have said, a great many very distinguished persons expressed to\r\nme by letter or in conversation their appreciation of it; and some on the\r\nother side wrote letters giving it to me _per contra_, and one of these\r\nwas Caleb Cushing.  Cushing in Chinese means \"ancient glory,\" but Caleb's\r\nrenown was extinguished in those days.\r\n\r\nI may add that not only did H. W. Longfellow express to me his sympathy\r\nfor and admiration of my efforts to aid the Union cause, but at one time\r\nor another all of my literary friends in Boston, who perfectly understood\r\nand showed deep interest in what I was doing.  Which can be well believed\r\nof a city in which, above all others in the world, everybody sincerely\r\naims at culture and knowledge, the first principle of which--inspired by\r\npraiseworthy local patriotism--is to know and take pride in what is done\r\nin Boston by its natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.

I had already many\r\nfriends, and took letters to others who became our friends.  We were very\r\nkindly received.  Among those whom we knew best were Mrs. and Mr. H.\r\nRitchie, Mrs. and Mr. T. Perkins, Mrs. H. G. Otis, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Samuel Ward--but I must really stop, for there was no end to\r\nthe list.  Among my literary friends or acquaintances, or \"people whom I\r\nhave very often met,\" were Emerson, Longfellow, Dr. O. W. Holmes, J. R.\r\nLowell, E. P. Whipple, Palfrey, G. Ticknor, Agassiz, E. Everett--in a\r\nword, all that brilliant circle which shone when Boston was at its\r\nbrightest in 1862.  I was often invited to the celebrated Saturday\r\ndinners, where I more than once sat by Emerson and Holmes.  As I had been\r\neditor of the free lance _Vanity Fair_, and was now conducting the\r\n_Continental_ with no small degree of audacity, regardless of friend or\r\nfoe, it was expected--and no wonder--that I would be beautifully cheeky\r\nand New Yorky; and truly my education and antecedents in America,\r\nbeginning with my training under Barnum, were not such as to inspire\r\nfaith in my modesty.  But in the society of the Saturday Club, and in the\r\nvery _general_ respect manifested in all circles in Boston for culture or\r\nknowledge in every form--in which respect it is certainly equalled by no\r\ncity on earth--I often forgot newspapers and politics and war, and lived\r\nagain in memory at Heidelberg and Munich, recalling literature and art.  I\r\nheard, a day or two after my first Saturday, that I had passed the grand\r\nordeal successfully, or _summa cum magna laude_, and that Dr. Holmes, in\r\nenumerating divers good qualities, had remarked that I was modest.  Every\r\nstranger coming to Boston has a verdict or judgment passed on him--he is\r\nnumbered and labelled at once--and it is really wonderful how in a few\r\ndays the whole town knows it.\r\n\r\nI had met with Emerson many years before in Philadelphia, where I had\r\nattracted his attention by remarking in Mrs. James Rush's drawing-room\r\nthat a vase in a room was like a bridge in a landscape, which he recalled\r\ntwenty years later.  With Dr. Holmes I had corresponded.  Lowell! \"that\r\nreminds me of a little story.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some \"genius of freedom\"--_i.e._, one who takes liberties--who\r\ncollected autographs, and had not even the politeness to send a written\r\nrequest.  He forwarded to me this printed circular:\r\n\r\n   \"DEAR SIR: As I am collecting the autographs of distinguished\r\n   Americans, I would be much obliged to you for your signature.  Yours\r\n   truly, --- ---\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was editing _Vanity Fair_ I received one of these circulars.  I\r\nat once wrote:--\r\n\r\n   \"DEAR SIR: It gives me great pleasure to comply with your request.\r\n   CHARLES G. LELAND.\"\r\n\r\nI called the foreman, and said, \"Mr. Chapin, please to set this up and\r\npull half-a-dozen proofs.\"  It was done, and I sent one to the autograph-\r\nchaser.  He was angry, and answered impertinently.  Others I sent to\r\nHolmes and Lowell.  The latter thought that the applicant was a great\r\nfool not to understand that such a printed document was far more of a\r\ncuriosity than a mere signature.  I met with Chapin afterwards, when in\r\nthe war.  He had with him a small company of printers, all of whom had\r\nset up my copy many a time.  Printers are always polite men.  They all\r\ncalled on me, and having no cards, left cigars, which were quite as\r\nacceptable at that time of tobacco-famine.\r\n\r\nAmid all the horrors and anxieties of that dreadful year, while my old\r\nschool-mate, General George B. McClellan, was delaying and demanding more\r\nmen--_mas y mas y mas_--I still had as many happy hours as had ever come\r\ninto any year of my life.  If I made no money, and had to wear my old\r\ngloves (I had fortunately a good stock gathered from one of Frank\r\nLeslie's debtors), and had to sail rather close to the wind, I still\r\nfound the sailing very pleasant, and the wind fair and cool, though I was\r\n_pauper in aere_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harrison Gray Otis held a ladies' sewing-circle to make garments for\r\nthe soldiers, at which my wife worked zealously.  There were many social\r\nreceptions, readings, etc., where we met everybody.  It was very properly\r\nconsidered bad form in those early days of the war to dance or give grand\r\ndinners or great \"parties.\"  It was, in fact, hardly decent for a man to\r\ndress up and appear as a swell at all anywhere.  Death was beginning to\r\nstrike fast into families through siege and battle, and crape to blacken\r\nthe door-bells.  There was a dark shadow over every life.  I had been\r\nassured by an officer that my magazine was doing the work of two\r\nregiments, yet I was tormented with the feeling that I ought to be in the\r\nwar, as my grandfather would surely have been at my age.  The officer\r\nalluded to wrote to me that he on one occasion had read one of my\r\narticles by camp-fire to his regiment, who gave at the end three\r\ntremendous cheers, which were replied to by the enemy, who were not far\r\naway, with shouts of defiance.  As for minor incidents of the war-time, I\r\ncould fill a book with them.  One day a young gentleman, a perfect\r\nstranger, came to my office, as many did, and asked for advice.  He said,\r\n\"Where I live in the country we have raised a regiment, and they want me\r\nto be colonel, but I have no knowledge whatever of military matters.  What\r\nshall I do?\"  I looked at him, and saw that he \"had it in him,\" and\r\nreplied, \"New York is full of Hungarian and German military adventurers\r\nseeking employment.  Get one, and let him teach you and the men; but take\r\ngood care that he does not supplant you.  Let that be understood.\"  After\r\nsome months he returned in full uniform to thank me.  He had got his man,\r\nhad fought in the field--all had gone well.\r\n\r\nI remember, as an incident worth noting, that one evening while visiting\r\nJas. R. Lowell at his house in Cambridge, awaiting supper, there came a\r\ngreat bundle of proofs.  They were the second series of the Biglow Papers\r\nadapted to the new struggle, and as I was considered in Boston at that\r\ntime as being in my degree a literary political authority or one of some\r\ngeneral experience, he was anxious to have my opinion of them, and had\r\ninvited me for that purpose.  He read them to me, manifested great\r\ninterest as to my opinion, and seemed to be very much delighted or\r\nrelieved when I praised them and predicted a success.  I do not\r\nexaggerate in this in the least; his expression was plainly and\r\nunmistakably that of a man from whom some doubt had been banished.\r\n\r\nMy brother Henry had at once entered a training-school for officers in\r\nPhiladelphia, distinguished himself as a pupil, and gone out to the war\r\nin 1862.  The terrible ill-luck which attended his every effort in life\r\novertook him speedily, and, owing to his extreme zeal and over-work, he\r\nhad a sunstroke, which obliged him to return home.  He was a\r\nfirst-lieutenant.  The next year he went as sergeant, and was again\r\ninvalided.  What further befell him will appear in the course of my\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nThe _Continental Magazine_ had done its work and was evidently dying.  I\r\nhad never received a cent from it, and it had just met the expenses of\r\npublication.  It had done much good and rendered great service to the\r\nUnion cause.  Gilmore had very foolishly yielded half the ownership to\r\nRobert J. Walker, of whom I confess I have no very agreeable\r\nrecollections.  So it began to die.  But I have the best authority for\r\ndeclaring that, ere it died, it had advanced the time of the Declaration\r\nof Emancipation, which was the turning-point of the whole struggle, and\r\nall my friends in Boston were of that opinion.  This I can fully prove.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1862 I passed in Dedham, going every day to my office in\r\nBoston.  We lived at the Phoenix Hotel, and occupied the same rooms which\r\nmy father and mother had inhabited thirty-five years before.  We had many\r\nvery kind and hospitable friends.  I often found time to roam about the\r\ncountry, to sit by Wigwam Lake, to fish in the river Charles, and explore\r\nthe wild woods.  I have innumerable pleasant recollections of that\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nI returned in the autumn with my wife to Philadelphia, and to my father's\r\nhouse in Locust Street.  The first thing which I did was to write a\r\npamphlet on \"Centralisation _versus_ States Rights.\"  In it I set forth\r\nclearly enough the doctrine that the Constitution of the United States\r\ncould not be interpreted so as to sanction secession, and that as the\r\nextremities or limbs grew in power, so there should be a strengthening of\r\nthe brain or greater power bestowed on the central Government.  I also\r\nadvocated the idea of a far greater protection of general and common\r\nindustries and interests being adopted by the Government.\r\n\r\nThere was in the Senate a truly great man, of German extraction, named\r\nGottlieb Orth, from Indiana.  He was absolutely the founder of the\r\nBureaus of Education, &c., which are now nourishing in Washington.  He\r\nwrote to me saying that he had got the idea of Industrial bureaus from my\r\npamphlet.  In this pamphlet I had opposed the commonly expressed opinion\r\nthat we must do nothing to \"aggravate the South.\"  That is, we should\r\nburn the powder up by degrees, as the old lady did who was blown to\r\npieces by the experiment.  \"Do not drive them to extremes.\"  I declared\r\nthat the South would go to extremes in any case, and that we had better\r\nanticipate it.  This brought forth strange fruit in after years, long\r\nafter the war.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Boston in 1862, I published by Putnam in New York a book\r\nentitled \"Sunshine in Thought,\" which had, however, been written long\r\nbefore.  It was all directed against the namby-pamby pessimism, \"lost\r\nEdens and buried Lenores,\" and similar weak rubbish, which had then begun\r\nto manifest itself in literature, and which I foresaw was in future to\r\nbecome a great curse, as it has indeed done.  Only five hundred copies of\r\nit were printed.\r\n\r\nI was very busy during the first six months of 1863.  I wrote a work\r\nentitled \"The Art of Conversation, or Hints for Self-Education,\" which\r\nwas at once accepted and published by Carleton, of New York.  It had, I\r\nam assured, a very large sale indeed.  I also wrote and illustrated, with\r\nthe aid of my brother, a very eccentric pamphlet, \"The Book of\r\nCopperheads.\"  When Abraham Lincoln died two books were found in his\r\ndesk.  One was the \"Letters of Petroleum V. Nasby,\" by Dr. R. Locke, and\r\nmy \"Book of Copperheads,\" which latter was sent to me to see _and\r\nreturn_.  It was much thumbed, showing that it had been thoroughly read\r\nby Father Abraham.\r\n\r\nI also translated Heine's \"Book of Songs.\"  Most of these had already\r\nbeen published in the \"Pictures of Travel.\"  I restored them to their\r\noriginal metres.  I also translated the \"Memoirs of a Good-for-Nothing\"\r\nfrom the German, and finished up, partially illustrated, and published\r\ntwo juvenile works.  One of these was \"Mother Pitcher,\" a collection of\r\noriginal nursery rhymes for children, which I had written many years\r\nbefore expressly for my youngest sister, Emily, now Mrs. John Harrison of\r\nPhiladelphia.  In this work occurs my original poem of \"Ping-Wing the\r\nPieman's Son.\"  Of this Poem _Punch_ said, many years after, that it was\r\n\"the best thing of the kind which had ever crossed the Atlantic.\"  Ping-\r\nWing appeared in 1891 as a full-page cartoon by Tenniel in _Punch_, and\r\nas burning up the Treaty.  I may venture to say that Ping-Wing--once\r\nimprovised to amuse dear little Emily--has become almost as well known in\r\nAmerican nurseries as \"Little Boy Blue,\" at any rate his is a popular\r\ntype, and when Mrs. Vanderbilt gave her famous masked ball in New York,\r\nthere was in the Children's Quadrille a little Ping-Wing.  Ping travelled\r\nfar and wide, for in after years I put him into Pidgin-English, and gave\r\nhim a place in the \"Pidgin-English Ballads,\" which have always been read\r\nin Canton, I daresay by many a heathen Chinese learning that childlike\r\ntongue.  I also translated the German \"Mother Goose.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now terrible times came on, followed, for me, by a sad event.  The\r\nrebels, led by General Lee, had penetrated into Pennsylvania, and\r\nPhiladelphia was threatened.  This period was called the \"Emergency.\"  I\r\ncould easily have got a command as officer.  I had already obtained for\r\nmy brother an appointment as major with secretary's duty on Fremont's\r\nstaff, which he promptly declined.  But it was no time to stand on\r\ndignity, and I was rather proud, as was my brother, to go as \"full\r\nprivate\" in an artillery company known as \"Chapman Biddle's,\" though he\r\ndid not take command of it on this occasion. {252}  Our captain was a\r\ndealer in cutlery named Landis.\r\n\r\nAfter some days' delay we were marched forth.  Even during those few\r\ndays, while going about town in my private's uniform, I realised in a\r\ndroll new way what it was to be a _common_ man.  Maid-servants greeted me\r\nlike a friend, other soldiers and the humbler class talked familiarly to\r\nme.  I had, however, no excuse to think myself any better than my\r\ncomrades, for among the hundred were nearly twenty lawyers or\r\nlaw-students, and all were gentlemen as regards position in society.\r\nAmong them was R. W. Gilder, now the editor of the _Century_, who was\r\nquite a youth then, and in whose appearance there was something which\r\ndeeply interested me.  I certainly have a strange Gypsy faculty for\r\ndivining character, and I divined a genius in him.  He was very brave and\r\nuncomplaining in suffering, but also very sensitive and emotional.  Once\r\nit happened, at a time when we were all nearly starved to death and worn\r\nout with want of sleep and fatigue, that I by some chance got a loaf of\r\nbread and some molasses.  I cut it into twelve slices and sweetened them,\r\nintending to give one to every man of our gun.  But I could only find\r\neleven, and, remembering Gilder, went about a long mile to find him; and\r\nwhen I gave it to him he was so touched that the tears came into his fine\r\ndark eyes.  Trivial as the incident was, it moved me.  Another was\r\nTheodore Fassitt, a next-door neighbour of mine, whose mother had\r\nspecially commended him to me, and who told me that once or twice he had\r\nstolen ears of maize from the horses to keep himself alive.  Also Edward\r\nPenington, and James Biddle, a gentleman of sixty; but I really cannot\r\ngive the roll-call.  However, they all showed themselves to be gallant\r\ngentlemen and true ere they returned home.  The first night we slept in a\r\nrailroad station, packed like sardines, and I lay directly across a rail.\r\nThen we were in camp near Harrisburg for a week--_dans la pluie et la\r\nmisere_.\r\n\r\nWe knew that the rebels were within six miles of us, at Shooter's Hill--in\r\nfact, two of our guns went there.  Penington was with them, and had a\r\nsmall skirmish, wherein two of the foemen were slain, the corporal being,\r\nhowever, called off before he could secure their scalps.  That afternoon,\r\nas I was on guard, I saw far down below a few men who appeared to be\r\nscouting very cautiously, and hiding as they did so.  They seemed mere\r\nspecks, but I was sure they were rebels.  I called on Lieutenant Perkins,\r\nwho had a glass, but neither he nor others present thought they were of\r\nthe enemy.  Long after, this incident had a droll sequel.\r\n\r\nHearing that the rebels were threatening Carlisle, we were sent thither\r\non a forced march of sixteen miles.  They had been before us, and\r\npartially burned the barracks.  We rested in the town.  There was a large\r\nopen space, for all the world like a stage.  Ladies and others brought us\r\nrefreshments; the scene became theatrical indeed.  The soldiers, wearied\r\nwith a long march, were resting or gossipping, when all at once--_whizz-\r\nbang_--a shell came flying over our heads and burst.  There were\r\ncries--the ladies fled like frightened wild-fowl!  The operatic effect\r\nwas complete!\r\n\r\nAbout ten thousand rebel regulars, hearing that we had occupied Carlisle,\r\nhad returned, and if they had known that there were only two or three\r\nthousand raw recruits, they might have captured us all.  From this fate\r\nwe were saved by a good strong tremendous lie, well and bravely told.\r\nThere was a somewhat ungainly, innocent, rustic-looking youth in our\r\ncompany, from whose eyes simple truth peeped out like two country girls\r\nat two Sunday-school windows.  He, having been sent to the barracks to\r\nget some fodder, with strict injunction to return immediately, of course\r\nlay down at once in the hay and had a good long nap.  The rebels came and\r\nroused him out, but promised to let him go free on condition that he\r\nwould tell the sacred truth as to how many of us Federal troops were in\r\nCarlisle.  And he, moved by sympathy for his kind captors, and swearing\r\nby the Great Copperhead Serpent, begged them to fly for their lives; \"for\r\ntwenty regiments of regulars, and Heaven only knew how many, volunteers,\r\nhad come in that afternoon, and the whole North was rising, and trains\r\nrunning, and fresh levies pouring in.\"\r\n\r\nThe rebels believed him, but they would not depart without giving us a\r\ntouch of their quality, and so fired shell and grape in on us till two in\r\nthe morning.  There were two regiments of \"common fellows,\" or valiant\r\ncity roughs, with us, who all hid themselves in terror wherever they\r\ncould.  But our company, though unable to fire more than a few shots,\r\nwere kept under fire, and, being all gentlemen, not a man flinched.\r\n\r\nI did not, to tell the truth, like our captain; but whatever his faults\r\nwere, and he had some, cowardice was not among them.  Some men are\r\nreckless of danger; he seemed to be absolutely insensible to it, as I\r\nmore than once observed, to my great admiration.  He was but a few feet\r\nfrom me, giving orders to a private, when a shell burst immediately over\r\nor almost between them.  Neither was hurt, but the young man naturally\r\nshied, when Landis gruffly cried, \"Never mind the shells, sir; they'll\r\nnot hurt you till they hit you.\"\r\n\r\nI was leaning against a lamp-post when a charge of grape went through the\r\nlamp.  Remembering the story in \"Peter Simple,\" and that \"lightning never\r\nstrikes twice in the same place,\" I remained quiet, when there came at\r\nonce another, smashing what was left of the glass about two feet above my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nLong after the war, when I was one day walking with Theodore Fassitt, I\r\ntold him the tale of how I had awakened the family at the fire in Munich.\r\nAnd Theodore dolefully exclaimed, \"I don't see why it is that _I_ can\r\nnever do anything heroic or fine like that!\"  Then I said, \"Theodore, I\r\nwill tell you a story.  Once upon a time there was a boy only eighteen\r\nyears of age, and it happened in the war that he was in a town, and the\r\nrebels shelled it.  Now this boy had charge of four horses, and the\r\ngeneral had told him to stay in one place, before a church; and he\r\nobeyed.  The shells came thick and fast--I saw it all myself--and by-and-\r\nbye one came and took off a leg from one of the horses.  Then he was in a\r\nbad way with his horses, but he stayed.  After a while the general came\r\nalong, and asked him 'why the devil he was stopping there.'  And he\r\nreplied, 'I was ordered to, sir!'  Then the general told him to get\r\nbehind the church at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" cried Theodore in amazement, \"_I was that boy_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied; \"and the famous Roman sentinel who remained at his post\r\nin Pompeii was no braver, and I don't think he had so hard a time of it\r\nas you had with that horse.\"\r\n\r\nI was put on guard.  The others departed or lay down to sleep on the\r\nground.  The fire slackened, and only now and then a shell came with its\r\ndiabolical scream like a dragon into the town.  All at last was quiet,\r\nwhen there came shambling to me an odd figure.  There had been some\r\nslight attempt by him to look like a soldier--he had a _feather_ in his\r\nhat--but he carried his rifle as if after deer or raccoons, and as if he\r\nwere used to it.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Cap!\" he exclaimed, \"kin you tell me where a chap could get some\r\nammynition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to your quartermaster,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't got no quartermaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then to your commanding officer--to your regiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't got no commanding officer nowher' this side o' God, nor no\r\nregiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then who the devil are you, and where do you belong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't belong nowher'.  I'll jest tell you, Cap, how it is.  I live in\r\nthe south line of New York State, and when I heard that the rebs had got\r\ninter Pennsylvany, forty of us held a meetin' and 'pinted me Cap'n.  So\r\nwe came down here cross country, and 'rived this a'ternoon, and findin'\r\nfightin' goin' on, went straight for the bush.  And gettin' cover, we\r\nshot the darndest sight of rebels you ever _did_ see.  And now all our\r\nammynition is expended, I've come to town for more, for ther's some of\r\n'em still left--who want killin' badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, my friend,\" I replied.  \"You don't know it, but you're nothing\r\nbut a bushwhacker, and anybody has a right to hang or shoot you out of\r\nhand.  Do you see that great square tent?\"  Here I pointed to the\r\ngeneral's marquee.  \"Go in there and report yourself and get enrolled.\"\r\nAnd the last I saw of him he was stumbling over the sticks in the right\r\ndirection.  This was my first experience of a real _guerillo_--a\r\ncharacter with whom I was destined to make further experience in after\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAn earlier incident was to me extremely curious.  There was in our\r\nbattery a young gentleman named Stewart Patterson, noted for his\r\nagreeable, refined manners.  He was the gunner of our cannon No. Two.  We\r\nhad brass Napoleons.  At the distance of about one mile the rebels were\r\nshelling us.  Patterson brought _his_ gun to bear on theirs, and the two\r\nexchanged shots at the same instant.  Out of the smoke surrounding\r\nPatterson's gun I saw a sword-blade fly perhaps thirty feet, and then\r\nhimself borne by two or three men, blood flowing profusely.  The four\r\nfingers of his right hand had been cut away clean by a piece of shell.\r\n\r\nAt the instant I saw the blade flash in its flight, I recalled seeing\r\nprecisely the same thing long before in Heidelberg.  There was a famous\r\nduellist who had fought sixty or seventy times and never received a\r\nscratch.  One day he was acting as _second_, when the blade of his\r\nprincipal, becoming broken at the hilt by a violent blow, flew across the\r\nroom, rebounded, and cut the second's lip entirely open.  It was\r\nremarkable that I should twice in my life have seen such a thing, in both\r\ninstances accompanied by wounds.  Long after I met Patterson in\r\nPhiladelphia, I think, in 1883.  He did not recognise me, and gave me his\r\nleft hand.  I said, \"Not that hand, Patterson, but the other.  You've no\r\nreason to be ashamed of it.  I saw the fingers shot off.\"\r\n\r\nBut on that night there occurred an event which, in the end, after years\r\nof suffering, caused the deepest sorrow of my life.  As we were not\r\nfiring, I and the rest of the men of the gun were lying on the ground to\r\nescape the shells, but my brother, who was nothing if not soldierly and\r\npunctilious, stood upright in his place just beside me.  There came a\r\nshell which burst immediately, and very closely over our heads, and a\r\npiece of it struck my brother exactly on the brass buckle in his belt on\r\nthe spine.  The blow was so severe that the buckle was bent in two.  It\r\ncut through his coat and shirt, and inflicted a slight wound two inches\r\nin length.  But the blow on the spine had produced a concussion or\r\ndisorganisation of the brain, which proved, after years of suffering, the\r\ncause of his death.  At first he was quite senseless, but as he came to,\r\nand I asked him anxiously if he was hurt, he replied sternly, \"Go back\r\nimmediately to your place by the gun!\"  He was like grandfather Leland.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, while we were on a forced march to intercept a party\r\nof rebels, the effect of the wound on my brother's brain manifested\r\nitself in a terrible hallucination.  He had become very gloomy and\r\nreserved.  Taking me aside, he informed me that as he had a few days\r\nbefore entered a country-house, contrary to an order issued, to buy food,\r\nhe was sure that Captain Landis meant as soon as possible to have him\r\nshot, but that he intended, the instant he saw any sign of this, at once\r\nto attack and kill the captain!  Knowing his absolute determined and\r\ninflexibly truthful character, and seeing a fearful expression in his\r\neyes, I was much alarmed.  Reflecting in the first place that he was half-\r\nstarved, I got him a meal.  I had brought from Philadelphia two pounds of\r\ndried beef, and this, carefully hoarded, had eked out many a piece of\r\nbread for a meal.  I begged some bread, gave my brother some beef with\r\nit, and I think succeeded in getting him some coffee.  Then I went to\r\nLieutenant Perkins--a very good man--and begged leave to take my\r\nbrother's guard and to let him sleep.  He consented, and my brother\r\ngradually came to his mind, or at least to a better one.  But he was\r\nnever the same person afterwards, his brain having been permanently\r\naffected, and he died in consequence five years after.\r\n\r\nI may note as characteristic of my brother, that, twelve years after his\r\ndeath, Walt Whitman, who always gravely spoke the exact truth, told me\r\nthat there was one year of his life during which he had received no\r\nencouragement as a poet, and so much ridicule that he was in utter\r\ndespondency.  At that time he received from Henry, who was unknown to\r\nhim, a cheering letter, full of admiration, which had a great effect on\r\nhim, and inspired him to renewed effort.  He sent my brother a copy of\r\nthe first edition of his \"Leaves of Grass,\" with his autograph, which I\r\nstill possess.  I knew nothing of this till Whitman told me of it.  The\r\npoet declared to me very explicitly that he had been much influenced by\r\nmy brother's letter, which was like a single star in a dark night of\r\ndespair, and I have indeed no doubt that the world owes more to it than\r\nwill ever be made known.\r\n\r\nDuring the same week in which this occurred my wife's only brother,\r\nRodney Fisher, a young man, and captain in the regular cavalry, met with\r\na remarkably heroic death at Aldie, Virginia.  He was leading what was\r\ndescribed as \"the most magnificent and dashing charge of the whole\r\ncampaign,\" when he was struck by a bullet.  He was carried to a house,\r\nwhere he died within a week.  He was of the stock of the Delaware\r\nRodneys, and of the English Admiral's, or of the best blood of the\r\nRevolution, and well worthy of it.  It was all in a great cause, but\r\nthese deaths entered into the soul of the survivors, and we grieve for\r\nthem to this day.\r\n\r\nOur sufferings as soldiers during this Emergency were very great.  I\r\nheard an officer who had been through the whole war, and through the\r\nworst of it in Virginia, declare that he had never suffered as he did\r\nwith us this summer.  And our unfortunate artillery company endured far\r\nmore than the rest, for while pains were taken by commanding officers of\r\nother regiments, especially the regulars, to obtain food, our captain,\r\neither because they had the advance on him, or because he considered\r\nstarving us as a part of the military drama, took little pains to feed\r\nus, and indeed neglected his men very much.  As we had no doctor, and\r\nmany of our company suffered from cholera morbus, I, having some\r\nknowledge of medicine, succeeded in obtaining some red pepper, a bottle\r\nof Jamaica ginger, and whisky, and so relieved a great many patients.  One\r\nmorning our captain forbade my attending to the invalids any more.\r\n\"Proper medical attendance,\" he said, \"would be provided.\"  It was not;\r\nonly now and then on rare occasions was a surgeon borrowed for a day.\r\nWhat earthly difference it could make in discipline (where there was no\r\nshow or trace of it) whether I looked after the invalids or not was not\r\nperceptible.  But our commander, though brave, was unfortunately one of\r\nthose men who are also gifted with a great deal of \"pure cussedness,\" and\r\nthink that the exhibiting it is a sign of bravery.  Although we had no\r\ntents, only a miserably rotten old gun-cover, and not always that, to\r\nsleep under (I generally slept in the open air, frequently in the rain),\r\nand often no issue of food for days, we were strictly prohibited from\r\nforaging or entering the country houses to buy food.  This, which was a\r\ngreat absurdity, was about the only point of military discipline strictly\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nAt one time during the war, when men were not allowed to sleep in the\r\ncountry houses (to protect their owners), the soldiers would very often\r\nburn these houses down, in order that, when the family had fled, they\r\nmight use the fireplace and chimney for cooking; and so our men,\r\nforbidden to enter the country houses to buy or beg food, stole it.\r\n\r\nI can recall one very remarkable incident.  We had six guns, heavy old\r\nbrass Napoleons.  One afternoon we had to go uphill--in many cases it was\r\n_terribly_ steep--by a road like those in Devonshire, resembling a ditch.\r\nIt rained in torrents and the water was knee-deep.  The poor mules had to\r\nbe urged and aided in every way, and half the pulling and pushing was\r\ndone by us.  All of us worked like navvies.  So we went onwards and\r\nupwards for sixteen miles!  When we got to the top of the hill, out of\r\none hundred privates, Henry, I, and four others alone remained.  R. W.\r\nGilder was one of these, besides Landis and Lieutenant Perkins--that is\r\nto say, we alone had not given out from fatigue; but the rest soon\r\nfollowed.  This exploit was long after cited as one of the most\r\nextraordinary of the war--and so it was.  We were greatly complimented on\r\nit.  Old veterans marvelled at it.  But what was worse, I had to lie all\r\nnight on sharp flints--_i.e._, the slag or _debris_ of an iron smeltery\r\nor old forge out of doors--in a terrible rain, and, though tired to\r\ndeath, got very little sleep; nor had we any food whatever even then or\r\nthe next day.  Commissariat there was none, and very little at any time.\r\n\r\nFrom all that I learned from many intimate friends who were in the war, I\r\nbelieve that we in the battery suffered to the utmost all that men can\r\nsuffer in the field, short of wounds and death.  Yet it is a strange\r\nthing, that had I not received at this time most harassing and\r\ndistressing news from home, and been in constant fear as regards my\r\nbrother, I should have enjoyed all this Emergency like a picnic.  We\r\noften marched and camped in the valley of the Cumberland and in Maryland,\r\nin deep valleys, by roaring torrents or \"on the mountains high,\" in\r\nscenery untrodden by any artist or tourist, of marvellous grandeur and\r\nbeauty.  One day we came upon a scene which may be best described by the\r\nfact that my brother and I both stopped, and both cried out at once,\r\n\"Switzerland!\"  The beauty of Nature was to me a constant source of\r\ndelight.  Another was the realisation of the sense of duty and the\r\npleasure of war for a noble cause.  It was once declared by a reviewer\r\nthat in my Breitmann poems the true _gaudium certaminis_, or enjoyment of\r\nbattle, is more sincerely expressed than by any modern poet, because\r\nthere is no deliberate or conscious effort to depict it seriously.  And I\r\nbelieve that I deserved this opinion, because the order to march, the\r\ntramp and rattle and ring of cavalry and artillery, and the roar of\r\ncannon, always exhilarated me; and sometimes the old days of France would\r\nrecur to me.  One day, at some place where we were awaiting an attack and\r\nI was on guard, General Smith, pausing, asked me something of which all I\r\ncould distinguish was \"Fire--before.\"  Thinking he had said, \"Were you\r\never under fire before?\" and much surprised at this interest in my\r\nbiography, I replied, \"Yes, General--in Paris--at the barricades in Forty-\r\neight.\"  He looked utterly amazed, and inquired, \"What the devil did you\r\nthink I said?\"  I explained, when he laughed heartily, and told me that\r\nhis question was, \"Has there been any firing here before?\"\r\n\r\nTwo very picturesque scenes occur to me.  One was a night before the\r\nbattle of Gettysburg.  The country was mountain and valley, and the two\r\nopposing armies were camped pretty generally in sight of one another.\r\nThere was, I suppose, nearly half a cord of wood burning for every twelve\r\nmen, and these camp-fires studded the vast landscape like countless\r\nreflections of the stars above, or rather as if all were stars, high or\r\nlow.  It was one of the most wonderful sights conceivable, and I said at\r\nthe time that it was as well worth seeing as Vesuvius in eruption.\r\n\r\nHenry had studied for eighteen months in the British Art School in Rome,\r\nand passed weeks in sketching the Alhambra, and, till he received his\r\nwound, took great joy in the picturesque scenery and \"points\" of military\r\nlife.  But it is incredible how little we ate or got to eat, and how hard\r\nwe worked.  It is awful to be set to digging ditches in a soil\r\nnine-tenths _stone_, when starving.\r\n\r\nAs we were raw recruits, we were not put under fire at Gettysburg, but\r\nkept in Smith's reserve.  But on the night after the defeat, when Lee\r\nretreated in such mad and needless haste across the Potomac, we were\r\ncamped perhaps the nearest of any troops to the improvised bridge, I\r\nthink within a mile.  That night I was on guard, and all night long I\r\nheard the sound of cavalry, the ring and rattle of arms, and all that\r\nindicates an army in headlong flight.  I say that they went in needless\r\nhaste.  I may be quite in the wrong, but I have always believed that\r\nMeade acted on the prudent policy of making a bridge of gold for a\r\nretreating enemy; and I always believed, too, that at heart he did not at\r\nall desire to inflict extreme suffering on the foe.  Had he been a\r\nGeneral Birney, he would have smote them then and there hip and thigh,\r\nand so ended the war \"for good and all,\" like a Cromwell, with such a\r\nslaughter as was never seen.  I base all this on one fact.  At two\r\no'clock on the afternoon before that night I went to a farmhouse to\r\nborrow an axe wherewith to cut some fuel; and I was told that the rebels\r\nhad carried away every axe in great haste from every house, in order to\r\nmake a bridge.  Now, if I knew that at two o'clock, General Meade, if he\r\nhad any scouts at all, _must_ have known it.  But--_qui vult decipi_,\r\n_decipiatur_.\r\n\r\nThat ended the Emergency.  The next day, I think, we received the welcome\r\nnews that we were no longer needed and would soon be sent home.  On the\r\nway we encamped for a week at some place, I forget where.  There was no\r\ndrill now--we seldom had any--no special care of us, and no \"policing\" or\r\nkeeping clean.  Symptoms of typhoid fever soon appeared; forty of our\r\nhundred were more or less ill.  My brother and I knew very well that the\r\nonly way to avert this was to exercise vigorously.  On waking in the\r\nmorning we all experienced languor and lassitude.  Those who yielded to\r\nit fell ill.  Henry was always so ready to work, that once our sergeant,\r\nMr. Bullard, interposed and gave the duty to another, saying it was not\r\nfair.  I always remembered it with gratitude.  But this feverish languor\r\npassed away at once with a little chopping of wood, bringing water, or\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\nOne more reminiscence.  Our lieutenant, Perkins, was a pious man, and on\r\nSunday mornings held religious service, which we were obliged to attend.\r\nOne day, when we had by good fortune rations of fresh meat, it was cooked\r\nfor dinner and put by in two large kettles.  During the service two\r\nhungry pigs came, and in our full sight overturned the kettles, and,\r\nafter rooting over the food, escaped with large pieces.  I did not care\r\nto dine, like St. Antonio, on pigs' leavings.  My brother finding me,\r\nasked why I looked so glum.  I replied that I was hungry.  \"Is that all?\"\r\nhe replied.  \"Come with me!\"  We went some distance until we came to a\r\nfarmhouse in the forest.  He entered, and, to my amazement, was greeted\r\nas an old friend.  He had been there in the campaign of the previous\r\nyear.  I was at once supplied with a meal.  My brother was asked to send\r\nthem newspapers after his return.  He never sought for mysteries and\r\ndespised dramatic effects, but his life was full of them.  Once, when in\r\nNaples, he was accustomed to meet by chance every day, in some retired\r\nwalk, a young lady.  They spoke, and met and met again, till they became\r\nlike friends.  One day he saw her in a court procession, and learned for\r\nthe first time that she was a younger daughter of the King.  But he never\r\nmet her again.\r\n\r\nThere were two or three boys of good family, none above sixteen, who had\r\nsworn themselves in as of age--recruiting officers were not\r\nparticular--and who soon developed brilliant talents for \"foraging,\"\r\nlooting, guerilla warfare, horse-stealing, pot-hunting rebels, and all\r\nthose little accomplishments which appear so naturally and pleasingly in\r\nyouth when in the field.  For bringing out the art of taking care of\r\nyourself, a camp in time of war is superior even to \"sleeping about in\r\nthe markets,\" as recommended by Mr. Weller.  Other talents may be\r\nlimited, but the amount of \"devil\" which can be developed out of a\r\n\"smart\" boy as a soldier is absolutely infinite.  College is a Sunday-\r\nschool to it.  One of these youths had \"obtained\" a horse somewhere,\r\nwhich he contrived to carry along.  Many of our infantry regiments\r\ngradually converted themselves into cavalry by this process of\r\n\"obtaining\" steeds; and as the officers found that their men could walk\r\nbetter on horses' legs, they permitted it.  This promising youngster was\r\none day seated on a caisson or ammunition waggon full of shells, &c.,\r\nwhen it blew up.  By a miracle he rose in the air, fell on the ground\r\nunhurt, and marching immediately up to the lieutenant and touching his\r\nhat, exclaimed, \"Please, sir, caisson No. Two is blown to hell; please\r\nappoint me to another!\"  That oath was not recorded.  Poor boy! he died\r\nin the war.\r\n\r\nThere was one man in our corps, a good-natured, agreeable person, a\r\nprofessional politician, who astonished me by the fact that however\r\nstarved we might be, he had always a flask of whisky wherewith to treat\r\nhis friends!  Where or how he always got it I never could divine.  But in\r\nAmerica every politician always has whisky or small change wherewith to\r\ntreat.  _Always_.  Money was generally of little use, for there was\r\nrarely anything to buy anywhere.  I soon developed here and there an\r\nIndian-like instinct in many things, and this is indeed deep in my\r\nnature.  I cannot explain it, but it is _there_.  I became expert when we\r\napproached a house at divining, by the look of waggons or pails or\r\nhencoops, whether there was meal or bread or a mill anywhere near.  One\r\nday I informed our lieutenant that a detachment of rebel cavalry had\r\nrecently passed.  He asked me how I knew it.  I replied that rebel\r\nhorses, being from mountainous Virginia, had higher cocks and narrower to\r\ntheir shoes, and one or two more nails than ours, which is perfectly\r\ntrue.  And where did I learn that?  Not from anybody.  I had noticed the\r\ndifference as soon as I saw the tracks, and guessed the cause.  One day,\r\nin after years in England, I noticed that in coursing, or with beagles,\r\nthe track of a gypsy was exactly like mine, or that of all Americans--that\r\nis, Indian-like and _straight-forward_.  I never found a Saxon-Englishman\r\nwho had this step, nor one who noticed such a thing, which I or an Indian\r\nwould observe at once.  Once, in Rome, Mr. Story showed me a cast of a\r\nfoot, and asked me what it was.  I replied promptly, \"Either an Indian\r\ngirl's or an American young lady's, whose ancestors have been two hundred\r\nyears in the country.\"  It was the latter.  Such feet _lift_ or leap, as\r\nif raised every time to go over entangled grass or sticks.  Like an\r\nIndian, I instinctively observe everybody's _ears_, which are unerring\r\nindices of character.  I can sustain, and always could endure, incredible\r\nfasts, but for this I need coffee in the morning.  \"Mark Twain\"--whom I\r\nsaw yesterday at his villa, as I correct this proof--also has this\r\npeculiar Indian-like or American faculty of observing innumerable little\r\nthings which no European would ever think of.  There is, I think, a great\r\ndeal of \"hard old Injun\" in him.  The most beautiful of his works are the\r\nthree which are invariably bound in silk or muslin.  They are called \"The\r\nThree Daughters, or the Misses Clemens.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me, after I had recorded the events of our short but truly\r\nvigorous and eventful campaign, to write to R. W. Gilder and ask\r\nhim--_quid memoriae datum est_--\"what memories he had of that great war,\r\nwherein we starved and swore, and all but died.\"  There are men in whose\r\nletters we are as sure to find genial _life_ as a _spaccio di vino_ or\r\nwine-shop in a Florentine street, and this poet-editor is one of them.\r\nAnd he replied with an epistle not at all intended for type, which I\r\nhereby print without his permission, and in defiance of all the custom or\r\ncourtesy which inspires gentlemen of the press.\r\n\r\n   \"_May_ _8th_, _1893_.\r\n   \"EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT, THE CENTURY MAGAZINE,\r\n   \"UNION SQUARE, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n   \"MY DEAR LELAND: How your letter carries me back!  Do you know that\r\n   one night when I was trudging along in the dark over a road-bed where\r\n   had been scattered some loose stones to form a foundation, I heard you\r\n   and another comrade talking me over in the way to which you refer in\r\n   your letter?  Well, it was either you or the other comrade who said\r\n   you had given me something to eat, and I know that I must have seemed\r\n   very fragile, and at times woe-begone.  I was possibly the youngest in\r\n   the crowd.  I was nineteen, and really enjoyed it immensely\r\n   notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n   \"I remember you in those days as a splendid expressor of our miseries.\r\n   You had a magnificent vocabulary, wherewith you could eloquently and\r\n   precisely describe our general condition of starvation, mud,\r\n   ill-equippedness, and over-work.  As I think of those days, I hear\r\n   reverberating over the mountain-roads the call, 'Cannoneers to the\r\n   wheels!' and in imagination I plunge knee-deep into the mire and grab\r\n   the spokes of the caisson. {266a}\r\n\r\n   \"Do you remember the night we spent at the forge?  I burnt my knees at\r\n   the fire out-doors, while in my ears was pouring a deluge from the\r\n   clouds.  I finally gave it up, and spent the rest of the night\r\n   crouching upon the fire-bed of the forge itself, most uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n   \"You will remember that we helped dig the trenches at the fort on the\r\n   southern side of the river from Harrisburg, {266b} and that one\r\n   section of the battery got into a fight near that fort; nor can you\r\n   have forgotten when Stuart Patterson's hand was shot off at Carlisle.\r\n   As he passed me, I heard him say, 'My God, I'm shot!'  That night,\r\n   after we were told to retire out of range of the cannon, while we were\r\n   lying under tree near one of the guns, an officer called for\r\n   volunteers to take the piece out of range.  I stood up with three\r\n   others, but seeing and hearing a shell approach, I cried out, 'Wait a\r\n   moment!'--which checked them.  Just then the shell exploded within a\r\n   yard of the cannon.  If we had not paused, some of us would surely\r\n   have been hit.  We then rushed out, seized the cannon, and brought it\r\n   out of range.\r\n\r\n   \"By the way, General William F. Smith (Baldy Smith) has since told me\r\n   that he asked permission to throw the militia (including ourselves)\r\n   across one of Lee's lines of retreat.  If he had been permitted to do\r\n   so, I suppose you and I would not have been in correspondence now.\r\n\r\n   \"You remember undoubtedly the flag of truce that came up into the town\r\n   before the bombardment began.  The man was on horseback and had the\r\n   conventional white flag.  The story was that Baldy Smith sent word\r\n   'that if they wanted the town they could come and take it.' {267}  I\r\n   suppose you realise that we were really a part of Meade's right, and\r\n   that we helped somewhat to delay the rebel left wing.  Do you not\r\n   remember hearing from our position at Carlisle the guns of that great\r\n   battle--the turning-point of the war? {268}\r\n\r\n   \"I could run on in this way, but your own memory must be full of the\r\n   subject.  I wish that we could sometime have a reunion of the old\r\n   battery in Philadelphia.  I have a most distinct and pleasant\r\n   remembrance of your brother--a charming personality indeed, a handsome\r\n   refined face and dignified bearing.  I remember being so starved as to\r\n   eat crackers that had fallen on the ground; and I devoured, too, wheat\r\n   from the fields rubbed in the hands to free it from the ear. . . .\r\n\r\n   \"Sincerely,\r\n   R. W. GILDER.\r\n\r\n   \"_P.S._--I could write more, but you will not need it from me.\"\r\n\r\nTruly, I was that other comrade whom Gilder overheard commending him, and\r\nit was I who gave him something to eat, I being the one in camp who\r\nlooked specially after two or three of the youngest to see that they did\r\nnot starve, and who doctored the invalids.\r\n\r\nI here note, with all due diffidence, that Mr. Gilder chiefly remembers\r\nme as \"a splendid expressor of our miseries, with a magnificent\r\nvocabulary\" wherewith to set forth fearful adversities.  I have never\r\nbeen habitually loquacious in life; full many deem me deeply reticent and\r\nowl-like in my taciturnity, but I \"can hoot when the moon shines,\" nor is\r\nthere altogether lacking in me in great emergencies a certain rude kind\r\nof popular eloquence, which has--I avow it with humility--enabled me\r\ninvariably to hold my own in verbal encounters with tinkers, gypsies, and\r\nthe like, among whom \"chaff\" is developed to a degree of which few\r\nrespectable people have any conception, and which attains to a refinement\r\nof sarcasm, _originality_, and humour in the London of the lower orders,\r\nfor which there is no parallel in Paris, or in any other European\r\ncapital; so that even among my earliest experiences I can remember, after\r\nan altercation with an omnibus-driver, he applied to me the popular\r\nremark that he was \"blessed if he didn't believe that the gemman had been\r\ntakin' lessons in language hof a cab-driver, _and set up o' nights to\r\nlearn_.\"  But the ingenious American is not one whit behind the vigorous\r\nLondoner in \"de elegant fluency of sass,\" as darkies term it, and it\r\nmoves my heart to think that, after thirty years, and after the\r\nmarvellous experiences of men who are masters of our English tongue which\r\nthe editor of the _Century_ must have had, he still retains remembrance\r\nof my oratory!\r\n\r\nAt last we were marched and railroaded back to Philadelphia.  I need not\r\nsay that we were welcome, or that I enjoyed baths, clean clothes, and the\r\nblest sensation of feeling decent once more.  Everything in life seemed\r\nto be _luxurious_ as it had never been before.  Luxuries are very\r\nconventional.  A copy of Praetorius, for which I paid only fifteen\r\nshillings, was to me lately a luxury for weeks; so is a visit to a\r\npicture gallery.  For years after, I had but to think of the Emergency to\r\nrealise that I was actually in all the chief conditions of happiness.\r\n\r\nFeeling that, although I was in superb health and strength, the seeds of\r\ntyphoid were in me, I left town as soon as possible, and went with my\r\nwife, her sister, and two half-nieces, or nieces by marriage, and child-\r\nnephew, Edward Robins, to Cape May, a famous bathing-place by the ocean.\r\nOne of the little girls here alluded to, a Lizzie Robins, then six years\r\nof age, is now well known as Elizabeth Robins Pennell, and \"a writer of\r\nbooks,\" while Edward has risen in journalism in Philadelphia.  There as I\r\nwalked often eighteen or twenty miles a day by the sea, when the\r\nthermometer was from 90 to 100 degrees in the shade, I soon worked away\r\nall apprehension of typhoid and developed muscle.  One day I overheard a\r\nman in the next bathing-house asking who I was.  \"I don't know,\" replied\r\nthe other, \"but if I were he, I'd go in for being a prize-fighter.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody was poor in those days, so we went to a very cheap though\r\nrespectable hotel, where we paid less than half of what we had always\r\ngiven at \"The Island,\" and where we were in company quite as happy or\r\ncomfortable as we ever had been anywhere, though the death of her brother\r\nweighed sadly on my poor wife, and her dear good mother, whom I always\r\nloved tenderly, and with whom I never had a shade of difference of\r\nopinion nor a whisper of even argument, and to whom I was always devoted.\r\nI seem to have been destined to differ from other mortals in a few\r\nthings: one was, that I always loved my mother-in-law with whole heart\r\nand soul, and never considered our _menage_ as perfect unless she were\r\nwith us.  She was of very good and rather near English descent, a\r\nCallender, and had been celebrated in her youth for extraordinary beauty.\r\nHer husband was related to the celebrated beauty Miss Vining, whom Maria\r\nAntoinette, from the fame of her loveliness, invited to come and join her\r\ncourt.  At the beginning of this century no great foreigner travelled in\r\nAmerica without calling on Miss Vining in Delaware.  There is a life of\r\nher in Griswold's \"Republican Court.\"  It is without any illustrative\r\nportrait.  I asked Dr. Griswold why he had none.  He replied that none\r\nexisted.  I said to him severely, \"Let _this_ be a lesson to you never to\r\npublish anything without submitting it first to _me_.  I have a\r\nphotograph of her miniature.\"  The Doctor submitted!\r\n\r\nThis summer at Cape May I made the acquaintance of a very remarkable man\r\nnamed Solomon.  He was a Jew, and we became intimate.  One evening he\r\nsaid to me: \"You know so much about the Jews that I have even learned\r\nsomething from you about them.  But I can teach you something.  Can you\r\ntell the difference between the _Aschkenazim_ and the _Sephardim_ by\r\ntheir eyes?  No!  Well, now, look!\"  Just then a Spanish-looking beauty\r\nfrom New Orleans passed by.  \"There is Miss Inez Aguado; observe that the\r\ncorners of her eyes are long with a peculiar turn.  Wait a minute; now,\r\nthere is Miss Lowenthal--Levi, of course--of Frankfort.  Don't you see\r\nthe difference?\"\r\n\r\nI did, and asked him to which of the classes he belonged.  He replied--\r\n\r\n\"To neither.  I am of the sect of the ancient Sadducees, who took no part\r\nin the Crucifixion.\"\r\n\r\nThen I replied, \"You are of the _Karaim_.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; that is still another sect or division, though very ancient indeed.\r\nWe never held to the Halacha, and we laugh at the Mishna and Talmud and\r\nall that.  We do not believe or disbelieve in a God--Yahveh, or the older\r\nElohim.  We hold that every man born knows enough to do what is right;\r\nand that is religion enough.  After death, if he has acted up to this, he\r\nwill be all right should there be a future of immortality; and if he\r\nhasn't, he will be none the worse off for it.  We are a very small sect.\r\nWe call ourselves the _Neu Reformirte_.  We have a place of worship in\r\nNew York.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first agnostic whom I had ever met.  I thought of the woman\r\nin Jerusalem who ran about with the torch to burn up heaven and the water\r\nto extinguish hell-fire.  Yes, the sect was very old.  The Sadducees\r\nnever denied anything; they only inquired as to truth.  Seek or _Sikh_!\r\n\r\nI confess that Mr. Solomon somewhat weakened the effect of his grand free-\r\nthought philosophy by telling me in full faith of a Rabbi in New York who\r\nwas so learned in the Cabala that by virtue of the sacred names he could\r\nrecover stolen goods.  Whether, like Browning's sage, he also received\r\nthem, I did not learn.  But _c'est tout comme chez nous autres_.  The\r\nsame spirit which induces a man to break out of orthodox humdrumness,\r\ninduces him to love the marvellous, the forbidden, the odd, the wild, the\r\ndroll--even as I do.  It is not a fair saying that \"atheists are all\r\nsuperstitious, which proves that a man must _believe_ in something.\"  No;\r\nit is the spirit of nature, of inquiry, of a desire for the new and to\r\npenetrate the unknown; and under such influence a man may truly be an\r\natheist as regards what he cannot prove or reconcile with universal love\r\nand mercy, and yet a full believer that magic and ghosts may possibly\r\nexist among the infinite marvels and mysteries of nature.  It is admitted\r\nthat a man may believe in God without being superstitious; it is much\r\ntruer that he may be \"superstitious\" (whatever that means) without\r\nbelieving that there is an anthropomorphic _bon Dieu_.  However this may\r\nbe, Mr. Solomon made me reflect often and deeply for many a long year,\r\nuntil I arrived to the age of Darwin.\r\n\r\nI also made at Cape May the acquaintance of a very remarkable man, whom I\r\nwas destined to often meet in other lands in after years.  This was\r\nCarrol (not as yet General) Tevis.  We first met thus.  The ladies wanted\r\nseats out on the lawn, and there was not a chair to be had.  He and I\r\nwere seeking in the hotel-office; all the clerks were absent, and all the\r\nchairs removed; but there remained a solid iron sofa or settee, six feet\r\nlong, weighing about 600 pounds.  Tevis was strong, and a great fencer;\r\nthere is a famous _botte_ which he invented, bearing his name; perhaps\r\nWalter H. Pollock knows it.  I gave the free-lance or _condottiero_ a\r\nglance, and proposed to prig the iron sofa and lay waste the enemy.  It\r\nwas a deed after his Dugald Dalgetty heart, and we carried it off and\r\nseated the ladies.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn there was a vast Sanitary Fair for the benefit of the army\r\nhospitals held in Philadelphia.  I edited for it a daily newspaper called\r\n_Our Daily Fare_, which often kept me at work for eighteen hours per\r\ndiem, and in doing which I was subjected to much needless annoyance and\r\nmortification.  At this Fair I saw Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the remarkable oil fever, or mania for\r\nspeculating in oil-lands, broke out in the United States.  Many persons\r\nhad grown rich during the war, and were ready to speculate.  Its extent\r\namong all classes was incredible.  Perhaps the only parallel to it in\r\nhistory was the Mississippi Bubble or the South Sea speculations, and\r\nthese did not collectively employ so much capital or call out so much\r\nmoney as this petroleum mania.  It had many strange social developments,\r\nwhich I was destined to see in minute detail.\r\n\r\nMy first experience was not very pleasant.  A publisher in New York asked\r\nme to write him a humorous poem on the oil mania.  It was to be large\r\nenough to make a small volume.  I did so, and in my opinion wrote a good\r\none.  It cost me much time and trouble.  When it was done, the publisher\r\n_refused to take it_, saying that it was not what he wanted.  So I lost\r\nmy labour or _oleum perdidi_.\r\n\r\nI had two young friends named Colton, who had been in the war from the\r\nbeginning to the end, and experienced its changes to the utmost.  Neither\r\nwas over twenty-one.  William Colton, the elder, was a captain in the\r\nregular cavalry, and the younger, Baldwin, was his orderly.  It was a man\r\nin the Captain's company, named Yost, who furnished the type of Hans\r\nBreitmann as a soldier.  The brothers told me that one day in a march in\r\nTennessee, not far from Murfreesboro', they had found petroleum in the\r\nroad, and thought it indicated the presence of oil-springs.  I mentioned\r\nthis to Mr. Joseph Lea, a merchant of Philadelphia.  He was the father of\r\nMrs. Anna Lea Merritt, who has since become a very distinguished artist,\r\nwell known in England, being the first lady painter from whom the British\r\nGovernment ever bought a picture.  Mr. Lea thought it might be worth some\r\nexpense to investigate this Tennessee oil.  I volunteered to go, if my\r\nexpenses were paid, and it was agreed to.  It is difficult at the present\r\nday to give any reader a clear idea of the dangers and trouble which this\r\nundertaking involved, and I was fully aware beforehand what they would\r\nbe.  The place was on the border, in the most disorganised state of\r\nsociety conceivable, and, in fact, completely swarming with guerillas or\r\nbrigands, _sans merci_, who simply killed and stripped everybody who fell\r\ninto their hands.  All over our border or frontier there are innumerable\r\nfamilies who have kept up feuds to the death, or _vendettas_, in some\r\ncases for more than a century; and now, in the absence of all civil law,\r\nthese were engaged in wreaking their old grudges without restraint, and\r\nassuredly not sparing any stranger who came between them.\r\n\r\nI had a friend in C. A. Dana, the Assistant-Secretary of War, and another\r\nin Colonel Henry Olcott, since known as the theosophist.  The latter had\r\njust come from the country which I proposed to visit.  I asked him to aid\r\nme in getting military passes and introductions to officers in command.\r\nHe promised to do so, saying that he would not go through what I had\r\nbefore me for all the oil in America. {274}  And, indeed, one could not\r\ntake up a newspaper without finding full proof that Tennessee was at that\r\ntime an _inferno_ or No-man's Land of disorder.\r\n\r\nI went to it with my eyes wide open.  After so many years of work, I was\r\nas poor as ever, and the seven years of harvest which I had prophesied\r\nhad come, and I was not gathering a single golden grain.  My father\r\nregarded me as a failure in life, or as a literary ne'er-do-weel,\r\ndestined never to achieve fortune or gain an _etat_, and he was quite\r\nright.  My war experience had made me reckless of life, and speculation\r\nwas firing every heart.  I bought myself a pair of long, strong, overall\r\nboots and blanket, borrowed a revolver, arranged money affairs with Mr.\r\nLea, who always acted with the greatest generosity, intelligence, and\r\nkindness, packed my carpet-bag, and departed.  It was midwinter, and I\r\nwas destined for a wintry region, or Venango County, where, until within\r\nthe past few months, there had been many more bears and deer than human\r\nbeings.  For it was in Venango, Pennsylvania, that the oil-wells were\r\nsituated, and Mr. Lea judged it advisable that I should first visit them\r\nand learn something of the method of working, the geology of the region,\r\nand other practical matters.\r\n\r\nMy brother accompanied me to the station, and I left at about 8 p.m.\r\nAfter a long, long, weary night and day, I arrived at an oil town, whose\r\nname I now forget.  By great good fortune I secured a room, and by still\r\ngreater luck I got acquainted the next morning at breakfast with three or\r\nfour genial and gentlemanly men, all \"speculators\" like myself, who had\r\ncome to spy into the plumpness and oiliness of the land.  We hired a\r\nsleigh and went forth on an excursion among the oil-wells.  It was in\r\nsome respects the most remarkable day I ever spent anywhere.\r\n\r\nFor here was oil, oil, oil everywhere, in fountains flowing at the rate\r\nof a dollar a second (it brought 70 cents a gallon), derricks or\r\nscaffoldings at every turn over wells, men making fortunes in an hour,\r\nand beggars riding on blooded horses.  I myself saw a man in a blue\r\ncarter's blouse, carrying a black snake-whip, and since breakfast, for\r\nselling a friend's farm, he had received 1250,000 as commission (_i.e._,\r\n50,000 pounds).  When we stopped to dine at a tavern, there stood behind\r\nus during all the meal many country-fellows, all trying to sell\r\noil-lands; every one had a great bargain at from thirty or forty thousand\r\ndollars downwards.  The lowest in the lot was a boy of seventeen or\r\neighteen, a loutish-looking youth, who looked as if his vocation had been\r\npeddling apples and lozenges.  He had only a small estate to dispose of\r\nfor $15,000 (3,000 pounds), but he was very small fry indeed.  My\r\ncompanions met with many friends; all had within a few days or hours made\r\nor lost incredible sums by gambling in oil-lands, borrowing recklessly,\r\nand failing as recklessly.  Companies were formed here on the spot as\r\neasily as men get up a game of cards, and of this within a few days I\r\nwitnessed many instances.  Two men would meet.  \"Got any land over?\"\r\n(_i.e._, not \"stocked\").  \"Yes, first-rate; geologer's certificate; can\r\nyou put it on the market?\"  \"That's my business.  I've floated forty oil\r\nstocks already, terms half profits.\"  So it would be floated forthwith.\r\nGambling by _millions_ was in the air everywhere; low common men held\r\nsometimes _thirty companies_, all their own, in one pocket, to be\r\npresently sprung in New York or elsewhere.  And in contrast to it was the\r\nutterly bleak wretchedness and poverty of every house, and the miserable\r\nshanties, and all around and afar the dismal, dark, pine forests covered\r\nwith snow.\r\n\r\nI heard that day of a man who got a living by spiritually intuiting oil.\r\n\"Something told him,\" some Socratic demon or inner impulse, that there\r\nwas \"ile\" here or there, deep under the earth.  To pilot to this \"ile\" of\r\nbeauty he was paid high fees.  One of my new friends avowed his intention\r\nof at once employing this oil-seer as over-seer.\r\n\r\nWe came to some stupendous tanks and to a well which, as one of my\r\nfriends said enviously and longingly, was running three thousand dollars\r\na day in clear greenbacks.  Its history was remarkable.  For a very long\r\ntime an engineer had been here, employed by a company in boring, but bore\r\nhe never so wisely, he could get nothing.  At last the company, tired of\r\nthe expenditure and no returns, wrote to him ordering him to cease all\r\nfurther work on the next Saturday.  But the engineer had become\r\n\"possessed\" with the idea that he _must_ succeed, and so, unheeding\r\norders, he bored away all alone the next day.  About sunset some one\r\ngoing by heard a loud screaming and hurrahing.  Hastening up, he found\r\nthe engineer almost delirious with joy, dancing like a lunatic round a\r\nfountain of oil, which was \"as thick as a flour-barrel, and rising to the\r\nheight of a hundred feet.\"  It was speedily plugged and made available.\r\nAll of this occurred only a very few days before I saw it.\r\n\r\nThat night I stopped at a newly-erected tavern, and, as no bed was to be\r\nhad, made up my mind to sleep in my blanket on the muddy floor,\r\nsurrounded by a crowd of noisy speculators, waggoners, and the like.  I\r\ntell this tale vilely, for I omitted to say that I did the same thing the\r\nfirst night when I entered the oil-country, got a bed on the second, and\r\nthat this was the third.  But even here I made the acquaintance of a nice\r\nScotchman, who found out another very nice man who had a house near by,\r\nand who, albeit not accustomed to receive guests, said he would give us\r\ntwo one bed, which he did.  However, the covering was not abundant, and\r\nI, for all my blanket, was a-cold.  In the morning I found a full supply\r\nof blankets hanging over the foot-board, but we had retired without a\r\nlight, and had not noticed them.  Our breakfast being rather poor, our\r\nhost, with an apology, brought in a great cold mince-pie three inches\r\nthick, which is just the thing which I love best of all earthly food.\r\nThat he apologised for it indicated a very high degree of culture indeed\r\nin rural America, and, in fact, I found that he was a well-read and\r\nmodest man.\r\n\r\nIt was, I think, at a place called Plummer that I made the acquaintance\r\nof two brothers named B---, who seemed to vibrate on the summit of\r\nfortune as two golden balls might on the top of the oil-fountain to which\r\nI referred.  One spoke casually of having at that instant a charter for a\r\nbank in one pocket, and one for a railroad in the other.  They bought and\r\nsold any and all kinds of oil-land in any quantity, without giving it a\r\nthought.  While I was in their office, one man exhibited a very handsome\r\nrevolver.  \"How much did it cost?\" asked B.  \"Fifty dollars\" (10 pounds).\r\n\"I wish,\" replied B., \"that when you go to Philadelphia you'd get me a\r\ndozen of them for presents.\"  A man came to the window and called for\r\nhim.  \"What do you want?\"  \"Here are the two horses I spoke about\r\nyesterday.\"  Hardly heeding him, and talking to others, B. went to the\r\nwindow, cast a casual glance at the steeds, and said, \"What was it you\r\nsaid that you wanted for them?\"  \"Three thousand dollars.\"  \"All right!\r\ngo and put 'em in the stable, and come here and get the money.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Plummer I had to go ten miles to Oil City.  If I had only known it,\r\none of my very new friends, who was very kind indeed to a stranger, would\r\nhave driven me over in his sleigh.  But I did not know it, and so paid a\r\nvery rough countryman ten dollars (2 pounds) to take me over on a\r\n_jumper_.  This is the roughest form of a sledge, consisting of two\r\nsaplings with the ends turned up, fastened by cross-pieces.  The snow on\r\nthe road was two feet deep, and the thermometer at zero.  But the driver\r\nhad two good horses, and made good time.  I found it very difficult\r\nindeed to hold on to the vehicle and also to keep my carpet-bag.\r\nMeanwhile my driver entertained me with an account of a great misfortune\r\nwhich had just befallen him.  It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Before this here oil-fever came along I had a little farm that cost me\r\n$150, and off that, an' workin' at carpentrin', I got a _mighty_ slim\r\nlivin'.  I used to keep all my main savin's to pay taxes, and often had\r\nto save up the cents to get a prospective drink of whisky.  Well, last\r\nweek I sold my farm for forty thousand dollars, and dern my skin ef the\r\nfeller that bought it didn't go and sell it yesterday for a hundred and\r\nfifty thousand!  Just like my derned bad luck!\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, my friend,\" I said; \"I have travelled pretty far in my time,\r\nbut I never saw a country in which a man with forty thousand dollars was\r\nnot considered rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be rich anywhere else with it,\" replied the _nouveau riche_\r\ncontemptuously, \"but it wouldn't do more than buy him a glass of whisky\r\nhere in Plummer.\"\r\n\r\nHaving learned what I could of oil-boring, I went to Cincinnati, and then\r\nto Nashville by rail.  It may give the reader some idea of what kind of a\r\ncountry and life I was coming into when I tell him that the train which\r\npreceded mine had been stopped by the guerillas, who took from it fifty\r\nFederal soldiers and shot them dead, stripping the other passengers; and\r\nthat the one which came after had a hundred and fifty bullets fired into\r\nit, but had not been stopped.  We passed by Mammoth Cave, but at full\r\nspeed, for it was held by the brigands.  All of which things were duly\r\nchronicled in the Northern newspapers, and read by all at home.\r\n\r\nI got to Nashville.  It had very recently been taken by the Federal\r\nforces under General Thomas, who had put it under charge of General\r\nWhipple, who was, in fact, the ruling or administrative man of the\r\nSouthwest just then.  I went to the hotel.  Everything was dismal and\r\ndirty--nothing but soldiers and officers, with all the marks of the field\r\nand of warfare visible on them--citizens invisible--everything\r\nproclaiming a city camp in time of war--sixty thousand men in a city of\r\ntwenty thousand, more or less.  I got a room.  It was so cold that night\r\nthat the ice froze two inches thick in my pitcher in my room.\r\n\r\nI expected to find the brothers Colton in Nashville.  I went to the\r\nproper military authority, and was informed that their regiment was down\r\nat the front in Alabama, as was also the officer who had the authority to\r\ngive them leave of absence.  I was also informed that my only chance was\r\nto go to Alabama, or, in fact, into the field itself, as a civilian!  This\r\nwas a dreary prospect.  However, I made up my mind to it, and was walking\r\nalong the street in a very sombre state of mind, for I was going to a\r\ncountry like that described in \"Sir Grey Stele\"--\r\n\r\n   \"Whiche is called the Land of Doubte.\"\r\n\r\nAnd doubtful indeed, and very dismal and cold and old, did everything\r\nseem on that winter afternoon as I, utterly alone, went my way.  What I\r\nwanted most of all things on earth was a companion.  With my brother I\r\nwould have gone down to the front and to face all chances as if it were\r\nto a picnic.\r\n\r\nWhen ill-fortune intends to make a spring, she draws back.  But good\r\nfortune, God bless her! does just the same.  Therefore _si fortuna\r\ntonat_, _caveto mergi_--if fortune frowns, do not for that despond.  Just\r\nas I was passing a very respectable-looking mansion, I saw a sign over\r\nits office-door bearing the words: \"Captain Joseph R. Paxton, Mustering-\r\nin and Disbursing Officer.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph R. Paxton was a very intimate friend of mine in Philadelphia.  He\r\nwas still a young man, and one of the most remarkable whom I have ever\r\nknown.  He was a great scholar.  He was more familiar with all the\r\n_rariora_, _curiosa_, and singular marvels of literature than any body I\r\never knew except Octave Delepierre, with whose works he first made me\r\nacquainted.  He had translated Ik Marvel's \"Reveries of a Bachelor\" into\r\nFrench, and had been accepted by a Paris publisher.  He had been a\r\nlawyer, an agent for a railroad, and had long edited in Philadelphia a\r\ncurious journal entitled _Bizarre_, and written a work on gems.  His\r\nwhole soul, however, was in the French literature of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and he always had a library which would make a collector's mouth\r\nwater.  Had he lived in London or Paris, he would have made a great\r\nreputation.  And he was kind-hearted, genial, and generous to a fault.  He\r\nhad always some unfortunate friend living on him, some Bohemian of\r\nliterature under a cloud.\r\n\r\nI entered the office and found him, and great was his amazement!  \"_Que\r\ndiable_, _mon ami_, _faistu ici dans cette galere_?\" was his greeting.  I\r\nexplained the circumstances in detail.  He at once exclaimed, \"Come and\r\nlive here with me.  General Whipple is my brother-in-law, and he will be\r\nhere in a few days and live with us.  He'll make it all right.\"  \"Here,\r\nJim!\" he cried to a great six-foot man of colour--\"run round to the hotel\r\nand bring this gentleman's luggage!\"\r\n\r\nThere I remained for a very eventful month.  Paxton had entered with the\r\nconquerors, and had just seized on the house.  I may indeed say that _we_\r\nseized on it, as regards any right--I being accepted as hail-fellow-well-\r\nmet, and as a bird of the same feather.  In it was a piano and a very\r\ngood old-fashioned library.  It was like Paxton to loot a library.  He\r\nhad had his pick of the best houses, and took this one, \"niggers\r\nincluded,\" for the servants, by some odd freak, preferred freedom with\r\nPaxton to slavery with their late owner.  This gentleman was a Methodist\r\nclergyman, and Paxton found among his papers proofs that he had been\r\nconcerned in a plot to burn Cincinnati by means of a gang of secret\r\nincendiaries.\r\n\r\nWhenever the blacks realised the fact that a Northern man was a\r\n_gentleman_--they all have marvellous instincts for this, and a respect\r\nfor one beyond belief--they took to him with a love like that of bees for\r\na barrel of syrup.  I have experienced this so often, and in many cases\r\nso touchingly, that I cannot refrain from recording it.  Among others who\r\nthus took to me was the giant Jim, who was unto Paxton and me as the\r\ncaptive of our bow and spear, albeit an emancipated contraband.  When the\r\nSoutherners defied General Butler to touch their slaves, because they\r\nwere their \"property\" by law, the General replied by \"confiscating\" the\r\nproperty by what Germans call _Faustrecht_ (or fist-right) as \"contraband\r\nof war.\"\r\n\r\nThis Jim, the general waiter and butler, was a character, shrewd, clever,\r\nand full of dry humour.  When I was alone in the drawing-room of an\r\nevening, he would pile up a great wood-fire, and, as I sat in an\r\narm-chair, would sit or recline on the floor by the blaze and tell me\r\nstories of his slave life, such as this:--\r\n\r\n\"My ole missus she always say to me, 'Jim, don' you ever have anything to\r\ndo with dem Yankees.  Dey're all pore miserable wile wretches.  Dey lib\r\nin poverty an' nastiness and don' know nothin'.'  I says to her, 'It's\r\nmighty quare, missus.  I can't understan' it.  Whar do all dem books come\r\nfrom?  Master gits em from de Norf.  Who makes all our boots an' clothes\r\nand sends us tea an' everythin'?  Dey can't all be so pore an' ignoran'\r\nef dey writes our books an' makes everythin' we git.'  'Jim,' she says,\r\n'you're a fool, an' don' understan' nothin'.'  'Wery good, missus,' says\r\nI, but I thinked it over.  All we do is to raise cotton, an' dey make it\r\ninto cloff, which we hav'n't de sense to do.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that I give this word for word.  And Jim, as I found, was a\r\nleading mind among the blacks.\r\n\r\nI had a letter of introduction from Mr. Lea to Horace Harrison, who was\r\nthe State Attorney for Tennessee.  At this time his power was very great,\r\nfor he had in his hands the disposition of all the estates of all the\r\nrebels in Tennessee.  He was the type of a Southwestern gentleman.  He\r\nreminded me very much of my old Princeton friends, and when I was in his\r\noffice smoking a pipe, I felt as if I were in college again.  I liked him\r\nvery much.  One morning I called, and after some deliberation he said,\r\n\"You are a lawyer, are you not?\" I replied that I had studied law under\r\nJudge Cadwallader.\r\n\r\n\"Then I should like to consult with you as a lawyer.  I have a very\r\ndifficult case to deal with.  There is a law declaring that all property\r\nbelonging to rebels shall be seized and held for one year.  Now, here is\r\na man whose estate I have held for six months, who has come in and\r\ndeclared his allegiance, and asks for his lands.  And I believe that\r\nbefore long, unless he comes in now, they will be almost ruined.  What\r\nshall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me,\" I replied, \"that if the disposal of these lands is in\r\nyour hands, you must be supposed to exert some will and discretion.  _Stat\r\npro ratione voluntas_ is a good axiom here.  We are not at all _in statu\r\nquo ante bellum_--in fact, the war is not at an end, nor decided.  Your\r\nduty is to act for the good of the country, and not simply to _skin_ the\r\nenemy like a bushwhacker, but to pacify the people.  _Victor volentes per\r\npopulos dat jura_--laws should always be mildly interpreted.  In your\r\ncase, considering the very critical condition of the country, I should in\r\nequity give the man his property, and take his oath of allegiance.  Severe\r\nmeasures are not advisable--_quod est violentum_, _non est durabile_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is, I believe, pretty accurately what I said.  That evening, as I\r\nwas sitting with General Whipple, he amazed me by addressing me exactly\r\nas Mr. Harrison had done in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Leland, you're a lawyer, and I want your advice.  There are six\r\nwarehouses here, and I want them badly for military stores.  But Horace\r\nHarrison says that I can't have them, because he holds them for the\r\nUnited States.  What am I to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"General Whipple,\" I replied, \"is this town under military occupation in\r\ntime of war, or is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most decidedly it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I should think from the way your patrols bother me.  And if such is\r\nthe case, all things must yield to military wants.  Where we have no\r\nlegal principles or courts to decide, we must fall back on legal axioms.\r\nAnd here the law is clear and explicit, for it says, _Inter arma leges\r\nsilent_--the laws are suspended in warfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"A magnificent saying!\" exclaimed the General admiringly.  \"Ah! you ought\r\nto be in the Supreme Court.\"  And seizing a pen he wrote to the State\r\nAttorney:--\r\n\r\n   \"SIR: This town, being but recently captured from the enemies of the\r\n   United States, is, of course, under military occupation, which renders\r\n   absolutely necessary for military purpose many temporary seizures and\r\n   uses, such as that of the six warehouses referred to in our late\r\n   correspondence.  As regards legal precedent and principle, I need not\r\n   remind one of your learning that--(I say, Leland, how do you spell\r\n   that Latin?--_I-n-t-e-r_--yes, I've got it)--_Inter arma silent\r\n   leges_.\"\r\n\r\nI am afraid that Horace Harrison, when he got that letter, suspected that\r\nI had been acting as counsel for both sides.  However, as I took no fee,\r\nmy conscience was at rest.  I think that I was of great use to General\r\nWhipple at that time, and, as he said one day, an unofficial secretary.\r\nGreat and serious matters passed through our hands (for the General and\r\nHarrison were taking the lead in virtually reforming the whole frontier\r\nor debatable land), and these grand affairs were often hurried through\r\n\"like hot cakes.\"  My slender legal attainments were several times in\r\nrequisition on occasions when the head of the Supreme Court would have\r\nbeen a more appropriate referee.  I discovered, however, that there was\r\nreally a department of law in which I might have done good work.\r\nQuestions of very serious importance were often discussed and disposed of\r\namong us three with very great economy of time and trouble.  And here I\r\nmay say--\"excuse the idle word\"--that I wonder that I never in all my\r\nlife fell into even the most trifling diplomatic or civil position, when,\r\nin the opinion of certain eminent friends, I possess several\r\nqualifications for such a calling--that is, quickness in mastering the\r\nlegal bearings of a question, a knowledge of languages and countries,\r\nreadiness in drawing up papers, and an insatiable love of labour, which\r\nlatter I have not found to be _always_ possessed by the accomplished\r\ngentlemen whom our country employs abroad.\r\n\r\nI may here narrate a curious incident which touched and gratified me.\r\nWhen all the slaves in Nashville were set free by the entrance of our\r\ntroops, the poor souls, to manifest their joy, seized a church (nobody\r\nopposing), and for three weeks held heavy worship for twenty-four hours\r\nper diem.  _But not a white soul was allowed to enter_--the real and\r\ndeeply-concealed reason being that Voodoo rites (which gained great\r\nheadway during the war) formed a part of their devotion.  However, I was\r\ninformed that an exception would be made in my case, and that I was free\r\nto enter.  And why?  Had Jim surmised, by that marvellous intuition of\r\ncharacter which blacks possess, that I had in me \"the mystery\"?  Now, to-\r\nday I hold and possess the black stone of the Voodoo, the possession of\r\nwhich of itself makes me a grand-master and initiate or adept, and such\r\nan invitation would seem as natural as one to a five-o'clock tea\r\nelsewhere; but I was not known to any one in Nashville as a \"cunjerer,\"\r\nand the incident strikes me as very curious.\r\n\r\nApropos of marvels, many of the blacks can produce in their throats by\r\nsome strange process sounds, and even airs, resembling those of the\r\nharmonicon, or musical box, one or the other or both.  One evening in\r\nNashville, in a lonely place, I heard exquisite music, which I thought\r\nmust be that of a superior hand-organ from afar.  But, to my amazement, I\r\ncould discover none; there were only two black boys in the street.  Alexis\r\nPaxton, the son of my host, explained to me that what I heard was\r\nunquestionably music made by those ebony flutes of boys, and that there\r\nwere some wonderful performers in the city.  I have listened to the same\r\nmusic at a public exhibition.  I greatly wonder that I have never heard\r\nof this kind of music in Europe or the East.  It is distinctly\r\n_instrumental_, not vocal in its tones.  It has the obvious\r\nrecommendation of economy, since by means of it a young lady could be\r\nperformer and pianoforte all in one, which was indeed the beginning of\r\nthe invention in Syrinx, who was made into a pan-pipe, which as a piano\r\nbecame the great musical curse (according to Heine) of modern times, and\r\nby which, as I conjecture, the fair Miss Reed or Syrinx revenges herself\r\non male humanity.  By the way, the best singer of \"_Che faro senza\r\nEuridice_\" whom I ever heard was a Miss Reed, a sister of Mrs. Paran\r\nStevens.\r\n\r\nI had a very pleasant time with Paxton, and I know right well that I was\r\nno burden on him, but a welcome friend.  _Au reste_, there was plenty of\r\nroom in the house, and abundant army stores to be had for asking, and one\r\nor two rare acquaintances.  One of these was a Southern officer, now a\r\ngeneral, who had come over to our side and fought, as the saying was,\r\nwith a rope round his neck.  He was terribly hated by the rebels, which\r\nhate he returned with red-hot double compound interest--for a renegade is\r\nworse than ten Turks.  He was the very type of a grim, calm old Border\r\nmoss-trooper.  He lived in his boots, and never had an ounce of luggage.\r\nOne evening General Whipple (always humane and cultivated, though as firm\r\nas an iron bar) said to him before me, \"I really don't know what to do\r\nwith many of my rebel prisoners.  They dress themselves in Federal\r\nuniforms for want of other clothes; they take them from the dead on the\r\nbattlefield, and try to pass themselves off for Federals.  It is very\r\ntroublesome.\"\r\n\r\n\"No trouble to me,\" replied the other.\r\n\r\n\"And how do you do with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot them as _spies_.  Why, only last week I got four dozen of them,\r\nand in less than four minutes I had them all laid out stiff in the road.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader need not imagine that the general here romanced or\r\nexaggerated.  At that very moment the massacres and murders which were\r\ngoing on within three miles of us were beyond belief.  The bands of\r\n_guerillas_ or bushwhackers which swept the country murdered in cold\r\nblood all who fell into their hands, and the Confederate soldiers often\r\ndid the same.  There resulted, of course, a deadly hatred on both sides,\r\nand the most unscrupulous retaliation.\r\n\r\nI could fill a book with the very interesting observations which I made\r\nin Nashville.  And here I call attention to a very strange coincidence\r\nwhich this recalls.  During the previous year I had often expressed a\r\ngreat desire to be in some State during its transition from Confederacy\r\nto Unionism, that I might witness the remarkable social and political\r\nparadoxes and events which would result, and I had often specified\r\nTennessee as the one above all others which I should prefer to visit for\r\nthis purpose.  And I had about as much idea that I should go to the moon\r\nas there.  But prayers are strangely granted at strange hours--_plus\r\nimpetravi quam fuissem ausus_--and I was placed in the very centre of the\r\nwheel.  This very remarkable fulfilment of a wish, and many like it,\r\nthough due to mere chance, naturally made an impression on me, for no\r\nmatter how strong our eyesight may be, or our sense of truth, we are all\r\ndazed when coming out of darkness into light, and all the world is in\r\nthat condition now.  No matter how completely we exchange the gloom of\r\nsupernaturalism for the sunlight of science, phantoms still seem to flit\r\nbefore our eyes, and, what is more bewildering still, we do not as yet\r\nknow but what these phantoms may be physical facts.  Perhaps the Voodoo\r\nstone _may_ have the power to awaken the faith which may move the vital\r\nor nervous force, which may act on hidden subtler forms of electricity\r\nand matter, atoms and molecules.  Ah! we have a great deal to learn!\r\n\r\nThrough General Whipple's kind aid the brothers Colton were at once\r\nbrought up from the front.  With them and Captain Paxton we went to\r\nMurfreesboro, and at once called on the general in command, whose name I\r\nhave forgotten.  He struck me as a grim, brave old commander, every inch\r\na soldier.  While we conversed with him a sergeant entered, a man who\r\nlooked as if he lived in the saddle, and briefly reported that a gang of\r\nguerillas were assembled at a certain place some miles away--I forget how\r\nfar, but the distance was traversed in an incredibly short time.  The\r\ngeneral issued orders for a hundred cavalry to go at once and \"get\" them.\r\nThey \"got\" them, killing many, and the next morning, on looking from my\r\nwindow, I saw the victors ride into the courtyard, many of them with\r\ntheir captives tied neck and heels, like bags of corn, over the cruppers\r\nof the horses.  A nice night's ride they must have had!  But the choice\r\nwas between death and being cruppered, and they preferred the latter to\r\ncoming a cropper.  Strange that the less a man has to live for the more\r\nhe clings to life.\r\n\r\nThe general thought that if he gave us a corporal and four men, and if we\r\nwere well armed, that we _might_ go out on the Bole Jack road and return\r\nunharmed, \"unless we met with any of the great gangs of bushwhackers.\"\r\nBut he evidently thought, as did General Whipple, who did not heed a\r\ntrifle by any means, that we were going into the lion's jaws.  So the\r\nnext morning, _equo iter ingredi_, I rode forth.  I had some time before\r\nbeen appointed aide-de-camp to Governor Pollock, of Pennsylvania, with\r\nthe rank of colonel, and had now two captains and a corporal with his\r\nguard.  It was a rather small regiment.\r\n\r\nWe heard grim stories that morning as to what had taken place all around\r\nus within almost a few hours.  Three Federal pickets had been\r\ntreacherously shot while on guard the night before; the troops had\r\nsurprised a gang of bushwhackers holding a ball, and firing through the\r\nwindows, dropped ten of them dead while dancing; two men had been\r\nmurdered by --- --- and his gang.  This was a noted guerilla, who was\r\nsaid to have gone south with the Confederate army, but who was more\r\ngenerally believed to have remained in hiding, and to have committed most\r\nof the worst outrages and murders of late.\r\n\r\nAt the first house where we stopped in the woods there lay a wounded man,\r\none of the victims of the dance the night before.  The inmates were\r\nsilent, but not rude to us.  I offered a man whisky, but he replied, \"I\r\ndon't use it.\"  We rode on.  Once there was an alarm of \"bushwhackers.\"  I\r\nshould have forgotten it but for the memory of the look of Baldwin\r\nColton's eyes, the delighted earnestness of a man or of a wild creature\r\ngoing to fight.  He and his brother had hunted and fought guerillas a\r\nhundred times, perhaps much oftener, for it was a regular daily service\r\nat the front.  Once during a retreat, Baldwin (eighteen or nineteen years\r\nof age) fell out of rank so often to engage in hand-to-hand sword\r\nconflicts with rebel cavalrymen, that his brother detached four to take\r\nhim prisoner and keep him safe.  Daring spirits among our soldiers often\r\nbecame very fond of this kind of duelling, in which the rebs were not a\r\nwhit behind them, and two of the infantry on either side would, under\r\ncover of the bushes, aim and pop away at one another perhaps for hours,\r\nlike two red Indians.\r\n\r\nI have forgotten whether it was with extra whisky, coffee, or money that\r\nwe specially gratified our corporal and guard; but Baldwin, who was \"one\r\nof 'em,\" informed me that they enjoyed this little outing immensely, just\r\nlike a picnic, and had a good time.  From which it may be inferred that\r\nmen's ideas of enjoyment are extremely relative.  It could not have been\r\nin the dodging of guerillas--to that they were accustomed; perhaps it was\r\nthe little extra ration, or the mystery of the excursion, for they were\r\nmuch puzzled to know what I wanted, why I examined the road and rocks,\r\nand all so strangely, and went into the very worst place in all the land\r\nto do so.  Baldwin Colton himself had been so knocked about during the\r\nwar, and so starved as a prisoner in Southern hands, that he looked back\r\non a sojourn in that _ergastulum_, Libby Prison, as rather an oasis in\r\nhis sad experiences.  \"It wasn't so bad a place as some, and there was\r\ngood company, and always _something to eat_.\"  The optimist of Candide\r\nwas a Mallock in mourning compared to this.\r\n\r\nThat night we came to somebody's plantation.  I forget his name, but he\r\nwas a Union man, probably a _very_ recent acquisition, but genial.  He\r\nhad read the _Knickerbocker_, and knew my name well, and took good care\r\nof us.  In the morning I offered him ten dollars for our night's lodging,\r\nwhich was, in the opinion of my two captains, stupendously liberal, as\r\nsoldiers never paid.  Our host declined it like a Southern planter, on\r\nthe ground that he never sold his hospitality.  So I put the money into\r\nthe hand of one of his pretty children as a present.  But as we rode\r\nforth we were called back, and reminded that we had forgotten to pay for\r\nthe _soldiers_!  I gave another five-dollar greenback and rode away\r\ndisgusted.  And at the gate a negro girl begged us to give her a \"dalla\"\r\n(dollar) to buy a fish-line.  It all came from my foolish offer to pay.\r\nGratitude is a sense of further benefits to be bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe place where the oil had been seen was near a conical rocky hill\r\ncalled Grindstone Knob.  We examined carefully and found no trace of it.\r\nThe geology of the country was unfavourable, much flint and conglomerate,\r\nif I remember, and wanting in the signs of coal, shales, &c., and\r\n\"faults\" or ravines.  I may be quite wrong, but such was my opinion.  No\r\none who lived thereabout had ever heard of \"ile.\"  Once I asked a rustic\r\nif any kind of oil was found in the neighbourhood in springs.  His reply\r\nwas, \"What! _ile_ come up outer the ground like water!  H---!  I never\r\nheard of sitch a thing.\"  _There was no oil_.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Grindstone Knob was a rather neat, small house, white,\r\nwith green blinds.  We were somewhat astonished to learn from a negro\r\nboy, who spoke the most astonishingly bad English, that this was the home\r\nof Mas' --- ---.  Yes, this was the den of the wolf himself, and I had no\r\ndoubt that he was not far off.  There was a small cotton plantation round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWe entered, and were received by a good-looking, not unladylike, but\r\nrather fierce-eyed young woman and her younger sister.  It was Mrs. ---.\r\nThe two had been to a lady's seminary in Nashville, and played the piano\r\nfor us.  I felt that we were in a strange situation, and now and then\r\nwalked to the window and looked out, listening all the time suspiciously\r\nto every sound.  It was easy enough for Mrs. ---, the brigand's wife, to\r\nperceive from my untanned complexion that I had not been in the field,\r\nand was manifestly no soldier.  \"_You_ look like an officer,\" she said to\r\nCaptain Colton, \"and so does _that_ one, but what is _he_?\" meaning me by\r\nthis last.  We had dinner--roast kid--and when we departed I gave the\r\ndame five dollars, having the feeling that I could not be indebted to\r\nthieves for a dinner.\r\n\r\nWe had gone but a little distance when we saw two bushwhackers with guns,\r\nand gave chase, but they disappeared in the bushes, much to the grief of\r\nour men, who would have liked either to shoot them or to bring them in.\r\nThen the corporal told us that while we were at dinner's \"faithful\r\nblacks\" had informed his men that \"Mas' had been at home ever since\r\nCrismas\"; that at eleven o'clock every night they assembled at the house\r\nand thence went out marauding and murdering.\r\n\r\nI paused, astonished and angry.  It was almost certain that the\r\nbushwhacker had been during dinner probably in the cellar under our feet.\r\nThe guerillas had great fear of our regular soldiers; two of the latter\r\nwere a match at any time for half-a-dozen of the former, as was proved\r\ncontinually.  Should I go back and hang --- up over his own door?  I was\r\ndying to do it, but we had before us a very long ride through the Cedar\r\nBarrens, the sun was sinking in the west, and we had heard news which\r\nmade it extremely likely that a large band of guerillas would be in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThat resolve to go actually saved our lives, for I heard the next day\r\nthat a hundred and fifty of these free murderers had gone on our road\r\njust after us.  This fact was at once transferred to the Northern\r\nnewspapers, that \"on --- a hundred and fifty bushwhackers passed over the\r\nBole Jack road.\"  Which was read by my wife and father, who knew that on\r\nthat very day I was on that road, to their great apprehension.\r\n\r\nI never shall forget the dismal appearance of the Cedar Barrens.  The\r\nsoil was nowhere more than two inches deep, and the trees which covered\r\nit by millions had all died as soon as they attained a height of fifteen\r\nor twenty feet.  Swarms of ill-omened turkey-buzzards were the only\r\nliving creatures visible \"like foul _lemures_ flitting in the gloom.\"\r\n\r\nRiding over the battlefield the Coltons and Paxton pointed out many\r\nthings, for they had all been in it severely.  At one place, Major\r\nRosengarten, a brother of my old Paris fellow-student, had had a sabre-\r\nfight with a rebel, and they told me how Rosengarten's sword, being one\r\nof the kind which was issued by contract in the earlier days of the war,\r\nbent and broke like a piece of tin.  Hearing a ringing sound Baldwin\r\njumped from his horse, picked up a steel ramrod and gave it to me for a\r\ncane.\r\n\r\nAs we approached Murfreesboro' I met a genial, daring soldier, one Major\r\nHill, whom I had seen before.  He had with him a hundred and fifty\r\ncavalry.  \"Where are you going so late by night?\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"I am after that infernal scoundrel, --- ---.  My scouts have\r\nfound out pretty closely his range.  I am going to divide my men into\r\ntens and scatter them over the country and then close in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Major,\" I replied, \"I will tell you just where to lay your hand at once,\r\nheavy on him.  Do you know Grindstone Knob and a white house with green\r\nwindows at its foot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be there at exactly eleven to-night, and you'll get him.  I have\r\nbeen there and learned it from the niggers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare that you are a good scout, Mr. Leland!\" cried the Major\r\nin amazement.  \"What can I do to thank you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Major Hill,\" I said, \"I have one thing to request: that is, if you\r\nget ---, don't parole him.  _Shoot him at once_; he is a red-handed\r\nmurderer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _will_ shoot him,\" said the Major, and rode forth into the night with\r\nhis men.  But whether he ever got --- I never knew, though according to\r\nthe calculations of the Coltons, who were extremely experienced in such\r\nmatters, \"Massa ---\" had not more than one chance in a thousand to\r\nescape, and Hill was notoriously a good guerilla-hunter and a man of his\r\nword.\r\n\r\nI believe that at the plantation our men had camped out.  At\r\nMurfreesboro' we returned them to the general, and I took the Coltons to\r\na hotel, which was so very rough that I apologised for it, while Baldwin\r\nsaid it seemed to him to be luxurious beyond belief, and that it was the\r\nfirst night for eighteen months in which he had slept in a bed.  In the\r\nmorning I wanted a spur, having lost one of mine, and there was brought\r\nto me a large boxful of all kinds of spurs to choose from, which had been\r\nleft in the house at one time or another during the war.\r\n\r\nI did not remain long in Nashville after returning thither.  I had\r\ninstructions to go to Louisville, Kentucky, and there consult with a\r\ncertain merchant as to certain lands.  General Whipple accompanied me to\r\nthe \"depot,\" which was for the time and place as much of an honour as if\r\nHer Majesty were to come to see me off at Victoria Station.  There was\r\nmany and many a magnate in those days and there, who would have given\r\nthousands to have had his ear as Paxton and I had it.\r\n\r\nOne night we were in the side private box at the theatre in Nashville.\r\nCouldock, whom I had known well many years before, was on the stage.  The\r\nGeneral was keeping himself deeply in the shade to remain unseen.  He\r\nremarked to Paxton that he wanted a house for his family, who would soon\r\narrive, and could not find one, for they were all occupied.  This one\r\nremark shows the man.  I wonder how long General Butler would have\r\nhesitated to move anybody!\r\n\r\nCaptain Paxton knew everything and everybody.  With a quick glance from\r\nhis keen dark eyes he exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"I've got it!  Do you see that fat man laughing so heartily in the pit?\r\nHe has a splendid house; it would just suit you; and he's a d---d old\r\nrebel.  I know enough about him to hang him three times over.  He has\"\r\n(here followed a series of political iniquities).  \"_Voila votre\r\naffaire_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how is it that he has kept his house?\" asked the General.\r\n\r\n\"He sent the quartermaster a barrel of whisky, or something of that\r\nsort.\"\r\n\r\nThe General looked thoughtfully at the fat man as the latter burst into a\r\nfresh peal of laughter.  I thought that if he had known what was being\r\nsaid in our box that laugh would have died away.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the General took the house.  I think he did.  I\r\nleft for Louisville.  There I saw the great merchant, who invited me to\r\nhis home to supper and consulted with me.  His daughters were rebels and\r\nwould not speak to me.  He had a great deal of property in Indiana, which\r\n_might_ be oil-lands.  If I would visit it and report on it, he would\r\nsend his partner with me to examine it.  I consented to go.\r\n\r\nThis partner, Mr. W., was a young man of agreeable, easy manners.  With\r\nhim I went to Indianapolis, and thence by \"stages,\" waggons, or on\r\nhorseback through a very dismal country in gloomy winter into the\r\ninterior of the State.  I can remember vast marshy fields with millions\r\nof fiddler crabs scuttling over them, and more mud than I had ever seen\r\nin my life.  The village streets were six inches deep in soft mud up to\r\nthe doors and floors of the houses.  At last we reached our journey's end\r\nat a large log-house on a good farm.\r\n\r\nI liked the good man of the house.  He said to us, after a time, that at\r\nfirst he thought we were a couple of stuck-up city fellows, but had found\r\nto his joy that we were old-fashioned, sensible people.  There was no\r\nsugar at his supper-table, but he had three substitutes for\r\nit--\"tree-sweetnin', bee-sweetnin', and sorghum\"--that is, maple sugar,\r\nhoney, and the molasses made from Chinese maize.  Only at a mile's\r\ndistance there was a \"sugar-camp,\" and we could see the fires and hear\r\nthe shouts of the people engaged night and day in making sugar from the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nHe told me that on the hills in sight a mysterious light often wandered.\r\nDuring the Revolutionary war some one had buried a barrelful of silver\r\nplate and money, and over it flitted the quivering silver flame, but no\r\none could ever find the spot.\r\n\r\nThe next day I examined the land.  There was abundance of fossiliferous\r\nlimestone, rich in petrifactions of tertiary shells, also cartloads of\r\nbeautiful _geodes_ or round flint balls, which often rattled, and which,\r\nwhen broken, were encrusted with white or purple amethystine crystals.  I\r\ndecided that there were places where oil might be found, though there was\r\ncertainly no indication of it.  I believe that my conjecture subsequently\r\nproved to be true, and that Indiana has shown herself to be a wise virgin\r\nnot without oil.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the next day, riding with my guide, I found that I\r\nhad left my blanket at a house miles behind.  I offered the man a large\r\nprice to return and bring it, which he did.  While waiting by the wood,\r\nin a dismal drizzle, I saw a log cabin and went to it for shelter.  Its\r\nonly inmate was a young woman, who, seeing me coming, hastily locked the\r\ndoor and rushed into the neighbouring woods.  When the guide returned I\r\nexpressed some astonishment at the flight; _he_ did not.  With a very\r\ngrave expression he asked me, \"Don't the gals in _your_ part of the\r\ncountry allays break for the woods when they see _you_ a-coming?\"\r\n\"Certainly not,\" I replied.  To which he made answer, \"Thank God, our\r\ngals here hev got better morrils than yourn.\"\r\n\r\nWe returned to St. Louis.  There I was shown the immensely long tomb of\r\nPorter the Kentucky giant.  This man was nine feet in height!  I had seen\r\nhim alive long before in Philadelphia.  I made several interesting\r\nacquaintances in St. Louis, the Athens of the West.  But I must hurry on.\r\n\r\nI went to Cincinnati, where I found orders to wait for Mr. Lea.  A\r\nsyndicate had been formed in Providence, Rhode Island, which had\r\npurchased a great property in Cannelton, West Virginia.  This consisted\r\nof a mountain in which there was an immense deposit of cannel coal.\r\nCannelton was very near the town of Charleston, which is at the junction\r\nof the Kanawha (a tributary of the Ohio) and Elk rivers.\r\n\r\nI waited a week at the hotel in Cincinnati for Mr. Lea.  It was a weary\r\nweek, for I had no acquaintances and made none.  Never in my life before\r\ndid I see so many Sardines, or Philistines of the dullest stamp as at\r\nthat hotel.  But at last Mr. Lea came with a party of ladies and\r\ngentlemen.  A small steamboat was secured, and we went up the Ohio.  The\r\nvoyage was agreeable and not without some incidents.  There was a freshet\r\nin the river, and one night, taking a short cut over a cornfield, the\r\nsteamboat stuck fast--like Eve--in an apple-tree.\r\n\r\nOne day one of the party asked me what was the greatest aggregate deposit\r\nof coal known in England.  I could not answer.  A few hours after we\r\nstopped at a town in Kentucky.  There I discovered by chance some old\r\nPatent Office reports, and among them all the statistics describing the\r\ncoal mines in England.  When we returned to the boat I told my informant\r\nthat the largest deposit in England was just half that of Cannelton, and\r\nadded many details.  Mr. Lea was amazed at my knowledge.  I told him that\r\nI deserved no credit, for I had picked it up by chance.  \"Yes,\" he\r\nreplied, \"and how was it that you _chanced_ to read that book?  None of\r\nus did.  Such chances come to inquiring minds.\"\r\n\r\nIt also chanced that this whole country abounded in signs of petroleum.\r\nIt was found floating on springs.  The company possessed rights of\r\nroyalty on thousands of acres on Elk River, which was as yet in the\r\ndebatable land, harassed by rebels.  These claims, however, were \"run\r\nout,\" and needed to be renewed by signatures from the residents.  They\r\nwere in the hands of David Goshorn, who kept the only \"tavern\" or hotel\r\nin Charleston, and he asked $5,000 for his rights.  There was another\r\nparty in the field after them.\r\n\r\nI verily believe that David Goshorn sold the right to me because he\r\nplayed the fiddle and I the guitar, and because he did not like the\r\nrival, who was a Yankee, while I was a congenial companion.  Many a\r\njourney had we together, and as I appreciated him as a marked character\r\nof odd oppositions, we got on admirably.\r\n\r\nIn Cannelton I went down into a coal mine and risked my life strangely in\r\nascending a railway.  The hill is 1,500 feet in height, and on its face\r\nis a railway which ascends at an angle of 15 degrees, perhaps the\r\nsteepest in America.  I ascended in it, and soon observed that of the two\r\nstrands of the iron cable which drew it one was broken.  The very next\r\nweek the other broke, and two men were killed by an awful death, they and\r\nthe car falling a thousand feet to the rocks below.\r\n\r\nThe next week we returned to Cincinnati, and thence to Philadelphia.  On\r\nmy way from New York to Providence I became acquainted in the train with\r\na modest, gentlemanly man, who told me he was a great-grandson or\r\ndescendant of Thomson who wrote the \"Seasons.\"  I thought him both great\r\nand grand in an incident which soon occurred.  A burly, bull-necked\r\nfellow in the car was attacked with an epileptic fit.  He roared, kicked,\r\nscreamed like a wildcat; and among fifty men in the vehicle, I venture to\r\nsay that only Thomson and I, in a lesser degree, showed any plain common\r\nsense.  I darted at the epileptic, grappled with him, held him down by\r\nwhat might be called brutal kindness, for I held his head down, while I\r\nsat on his arm and throttled him _sans merci_--I avow it--and tore off in\r\nhaste his neckcloth (his neck was frightfully swelled), while Thomson\r\nbrought cold water from the \"cooler,\" with which we bathed his face\r\nfreely, and chafed his pulse and forehead.  Little by little he\r\nrecovered.  The other passengers, as usual, did nothing, and a little old\r\nnaval officer, who had been fifty years in service (as Thomson told me),\r\nsimply kicked and screamed convulsively, \"Take him away! take him away!\"\r\nThe epileptic was George Christy, the original founder of the Christy\r\nMinstrels.  I can never think of this scene without exclaiming, \"_Vive_\r\nThomson!\" for he was the only man among us who displayed quiet\r\nself-possession and _savoir faire_.  As for me, my \"old Injun\" was up,\r\nand I had \"sailed in\" for a fight by mere impulse.  _Vive_ Thomson!  _Bon\r\nsang ne peut mentir_.\r\n\r\nI went to Providence, where I was empowered to return to Cannelton to pay\r\nGoshorn $5,000, and renew the leases on Elk River.  I should have to\r\ntravel post to anticipate the Yankee.  It was not concealed from me that\r\neven if I succeeded, I had before me a very dangerous and difficult task.\r\nBut after what I had already gone through with I was ready for anything.\r\nI was really developing rapidly a wild, reckless spirit--the \"Injun\" was\r\ncoming out of me.  My old life and self had vanished like dreams.  Only\r\nnow and then, in the forests or by torrents, did something like poetry\r\nrevisit me; _literature_ was dead in me.  Only once did I, in a railway\r\ntrain, compose the \"Maiden mit nodings on.\"  I bore it in my memory for\r\nyears before I wrote it out.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Philadelphia.  The next morning I was to rise early and fly\r\nwestward.  No time to lose.  Before I rose, my sister knocked at the door\r\nand told us the awful news that President Lincoln had been murdered!\r\n\r\nAs I went to the station I saw men weeping in the streets, and everybody\r\nin great grief, conversing with strangers, as if all had lost a common\r\nrelation.  Everywhere utter misery!  I arrived in Pittsburg.  It was\r\nraining, and the black pall of smoke which always clothes the town was\r\ndenser than ever, and the long black streamers which hung everywhere as\r\nmourning made the whole place unutterably ghastly.  In the trains nothing\r\nbut the murder was spoken of.  There was a young man who had been in the\r\ntheatre and witnessed the murder, which he described graphically and\r\nevidently truthfully.\r\n\r\nI reached Cincinnati, and as soon as possible hurried on board the\r\nsteamboat.  We went along to Charleston, and it will hardly be believed\r\nthat I very nearly missed the whole object of my journey by falling\r\nasleep.  We had but one more very short distance to go, when, overcome by\r\nfatigue, I dropped into a nap.  Fortunately I was awakened by the last\r\nringing of the bell, and, seizing my carpet-bag, ran ashore just as the\r\nplank was to be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI went directly to Goshorn's hotel.  He was a stout, burly man, shrewd in\r\nhis way, good-natured, but not without temper and impulses.  He looked\r\nkeenly after business, played the fiddle, and performed a few tricks of\r\nlegerdemain.  He had a ladylike wife, and both were very kind to me,\r\nespecially after they came to know me pretty well.  The lady had a nice,\r\neasy horse, which ere long was lent me freely whenever I wanted to ride.\r\nOne day it was missing.  The master grieved.  They had named it after me\r\nin compliment.  \"Goshorn,\" I said, \"in future I shall call _you Horse-\r\ngone_.\"  But he was not pleased with the name.  However, it was recovered\r\nby a miracle, for the amount of horse-stealing which went on about us\r\nthen was fabulous.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days Goshorn and I prepared to go up Elk River, to renew the\r\nleases of oil and coal lands.  Now I must premise that at all times the\r\nman who was engaged in \"ile\" bore a charmed life, and was venerated by\r\nboth Union men and rebels.  _He_ could pass the lines and go anywhere.  At\r\none time, when not a spy could be got into or out of Richmond to serve\r\nus, Goshorn seriously proposed to me to go with him into the city!  I had\r\na neighbour named Fassit, an uncle of Theodore.  He had oil-wells in\r\nVirginia, and when the war begun work on them was stopped.  This dismayed\r\nthe natives.  One morning there came to Mr. Fassit a letter imploring him\r\nto return: \"Come back, o come agin and bore us some more wels.  We wil\r\nprotec you like a son.  We dont make war on _Ile_.\"  And I, being thus\r\nrespected, went and came from the Foeman's Land, and joined in the\r\ndreadful rebel-ry and returned unharmed, leading a charmed if _not_\r\nparticularly charming life all winter and the spring, to the great\r\namazement and bewilderment of many, as will appear in the sequence.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of Elk River was in the debatable land, or rather still in\r\nSlave-ownia or rebeldom, where a Union man's life was worth about a\r\nchinquapin.  In fact, one day there was a small battle between me and\r\nhome--with divers wounds and deaths.  This going and coming of mine,\r\namong and with rebels, got me into a droll misunderstanding some time\r\nafter.  But I think that the real cause lay less in oil than in the\r\nsimple truth that these frank, half-wild fellows _liked_ me.  One said to\r\nme one day, \"You're onlike all the Northern men who come here, and we all\r\nlike you.  What's the reason?\"  I explained it that he had only met with\r\nYankees, and that as Pennsylvania lay next to Virginia, of course we must\r\nbe more alike as neighbours.  But the cause lay in the _liking_ which I\r\nhave for Indians, gypsies, and all such folk.\r\n\r\nGoshorn began by buying a dug-out poplar canoe sixty-four feet in length,\r\nand stocking it with provisions.  \"Money won't be of much use,\" he said;\r\n\"what we want chiefly is whisky and blue beads for presents.\"  He hired\r\ntwo men who had been in the Confederate army, but who had absented\r\nthemselves since the proceedings had become uninteresting.  These men\r\ntook to me with a devotion which ended by becoming literally\r\nsuperstitious.  I am quite sure that, while naturally intelligent,\r\nanything like a mind stored with varied knowledge was something _utterly_\r\nunknown to them.  And as I, day by day, let fall unthinkingly this or\r\nthat scrap of experience or of knowledge, they began to regard me as a\r\nmiracle.  One day one of them, Sam Fox, said to me meaningly, that I\r\nliked curious things, and that he knew a nest where he could get me a\r\nyoung _raven_.  The raven is to an Indian conjuror what a black cat is to\r\na witch, and I suppose that Sam thought I must be lonely without a\r\nfamiliar.  Which recalls one of the most extraordinary experiences of all\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nDuring my return down the river, it was in a freshet, and we went\r\nheadlong.  This is to the very last degree dangerous, unless the boatmen\r\nknow every rock and point, for the dugout canoe goes over at a touch, and\r\nthere is no life to be saved in the rapids.  Now we were flying like a\r\nswallow, and could not stop.  There was one narrow shoot, or pass, just\r\nin the middle of the river, where there was exactly room to an inch for a\r\ncanoe to pass, but to do this it was necessary to have moonlight enough\r\nto see the King Rock, which rose in the stream close by the passage, and\r\nat the critical instant to \"fend off\" with the hand and prevent the canoe\r\nfrom driving full on the rock.  A terrible storm was coming up, thunder\r\nwas growling afar, and clouds fast gathering in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe men had heard me talking the day before as to how storms were formed\r\nin circles, and it had deeply impressed them.  When Goshorn asked them\r\nwhat we had better do, they said, \"Leave it all to Mr. Leland; he knows\r\neverything.\"  I looked at the moon and saw that the clouds were not\r\ndriving dead against it, but _around_ while closing in, and I know not by\r\nwhat strange inspiration I added, \"You will have just time to clear King\r\nRock!\"\r\n\r\nIt was still far away.  I laid down my paddle and drew my blanket round\r\nme, and smoked to the storm, and sang incantations to myself.  It was a\r\nfearful trial, actually risking death, but I felt no fear--only a dull\r\nconfidence in fate.  Closer grew the clouds--darker the sky--when during\r\nthe very last second of light King Rock came in sight.  Goshorn was ready\r\nwith his bull-like strength and gave the push; and just as we shot clear\r\ninto the channel it became dark as pitch, and the rain came down in a\r\ntorrent.  Goshorn pitched his hat high into the air--_aux moulins_--and\r\nhurrahed and cried in exulting joy.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Leland, sing us that German song you're always so jolly\r\nwith--_lodle yodle tol de rol de rol_!\"\r\n\r\nFrom that hour I was _Kchee-Bo-o-in_ or Grand Pow-wow to Sam Fox and his\r\nfriends.  He believed in me, even as I believe in myself when such mad\r\n\"spells\" come over me.  One day he proved his confidence.  It was bright\r\nand sunshiny, and we were paddling along when we saw a \"summer duck\"\r\nswimming perhaps fifty yards ahead.  Sam was sitting in the bow exactly\r\nbetween me and the duck.  \"Fire at it with your revolver!\" cried Sam.\r\n\r\n\"It is too far away,\" I replied, \"and you are right in the way.\"\r\n\r\nSam bent over sideways, glaring at me with his one strange eye.  It was\r\njust about as close a shot as was William Tell's at the apple.  But I\r\nknew that reputation for nerve depended on it, so I fired.  As the duck\r\nrose it dropped a feather.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you'd hit!\" cried Sam triumphantly.  And so I had, but I should\r\nnot like to try that shot again.\r\n\r\nReflex action of the brain and secondary automatism!  It must be\r\nso--Haeckel, thou reasonest well.  But when the \"old Injun\" and my High-\r\nDutch ancestor are upon me, I reason not at all, and then I see visions\r\nand dream dreams, and it always comes true, without the _least_\r\nself-deception or delusion.\r\n\r\nIt is a marvellous thing that in these canoes, which tip over so easily,\r\nmen will pass over mill-dams ten or twelve feet high, as I myself have\r\ndone many a time, without upsetting.  The manner of it is this.  The\r\ncanoe is a log hollowed out.  This is allowed to pass over till it dips\r\nlike a seesaw, or falls into the stream below.  It is a dangerous,\r\nreckless act, but generally succeeds.  One day Sam Fox undertook to shoot\r\nour dug-out over a fall.  So he paddled hard, and ran the canoe headlong\r\nto edge, he being in the bow.  But it stuck halfway, and there was my\r\nSamuel, ere he knew it, high in the air, paddling in the atmosphere, into\r\nwhich thirty feet of canoe was raised.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the legal business and renewal of the leases and the payment\r\nof money was performed accurately and punctually.  Talk about _manna_ in\r\nthe wilderness! _money_ in the wilderness came to the poor souls\r\nimpoverished by the war as a thousandfold nicer.  But over and above\r\nthat, half a pound of coffee or a drink of whisky would cause a thrill of\r\ndelight.  One day, stopping at a logger's camp, I gave a decent-looking\r\nman a tin cup full of whisky.  The first thing he did was to put it to\r\nthe mouth of a toddling two-year-old child and it took a good pull.  I\r\nremonstrated with him for it, when he replied, \"Well, you see, sir, we\r\nget it so seldom, that whisky is a kind o' _delicacy_ with us.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes the log huts were twenty miles apart.  In such isolation there\r\nis no rivalry of ostentation, and men care only to _live_.  One day we\r\ncame to a log house.  The occupant had several hundred acres of very good\r\nland, and only a half acre under cultivation.  He was absent at a county\r\ncourt for amusement.  All that I could see in the cabin was a rude seat,\r\nan iron pot and spoon, and a squirrel-gun.  There were two cavities or\r\nholes in the bare earth floor, in which the old man and his wife slept,\r\neach wrapped in a blanket.  Even our boatman said that such carelessness\r\nwas unusual.  But all were ignorant of a thousand refinements of life of\r\nwhich the poorest English peasant _knows_ something, yet every one of\r\nthese people had an independence or pride far above all poverty.\r\n\r\nOne night we stopped at the house of a man who was said to possess\r\n$150,000 (30,000 pounds) worth of land.  The house was well enough.  His\r\ntwo bare-legged daughters, girls of seventeen or eighteen, lounged about\r\nsmoking pipes.  I gave one a cigar.  She replied, \"I don't keer if I do\r\ntry it.  I've allays wanted to know what a cigar smokes like.\"  But she\r\ndidn't like it.  Apropos of girls, I may say that there is a _far_ higher\r\nstandard of morals among these people than among the ignorant elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a wild country.  One day Goshorn showed me a hill, and a\r\nhunter had told him that when standing on it one summer afternoon he had\r\nseen in a marshy place the very unusual spectacle of forty bears, all\r\nwallowing together in the mud and playing at once.  Also the marks of a\r\nbear's claws on a tree.  Game was plenty in this region.  All the time\r\nthat I stayed with Goshorn we had every day at his well-furnished table\r\nbear's meat, venison, or other game, fish, ham, chickens, &c.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of very beautiful scenery on Elk River, and some\r\nof its \"incidents\" were marvellously strange.  The hard sandstone rocks\r\nhad worn into shapes resembling castles and houses, incredibly like\r\nbuildings made by man.  One day I saw and copied a vast square rock\r\nthrough which ran to the light a perfect Gothic archway sixty feet high,\r\nwith a long wall like the side of a castle, and an immense square tower.\r\nThere are the most natural-looking houses and Schlosser imaginable rising\r\nall alone in the forest.  Very often the summits of the hills were\r\ncrowned with round towers.  On the Ohio River there is a group of these\r\nshaped like segments of a truncated cone, and \"corniced\" with another\r\npiece reversed, like this:\r\n\r\n{Round tower: p304.jpg}\r\n\r\nThese are called \"Devil's Tea-tables.\"  I drew them several times, but\r\ncould never give them the appearance of being _natural_ objects.  It is\r\nvery extraordinary how Nature seems to have mocked man in advance in\r\nthese structures.  In Fingal's Cave there is an absolutely original style\r\nof architecture.\r\n\r\nThe last house which we came to was the best.  In it dwelt a gentlemanly\r\nelderly man with two ladylike daughters.  His son, who was dressed in\r\n\"store clothes,\" had been a delegate to the Wheeling Convention.  But the\r\nwar had borne hard on them, and for a long time _everything_ which they\r\nused or wore had been made by their own hands.  They had a home-made loom\r\nand spinning-wheel--I saw several such looms on the river; they raised\r\ntheir own cotton and wool and maple sugar, and were in all important\r\ndetails utterly self-sustaining and independent.  And they did not live\r\nrudely at all, but like ladies and gentlemen, as really intelligent\r\npeople always can when they are _free_.  The father had, not long before,\r\nstanding in his own door, shot a deer as it looked over the garden gate\r\nat him.  Goshorn, observing that I attached some value to the horns (a\r\nnew idea to him), secured them for himself.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, while descending the river, we stopped to see an old\r\nhunter who lived on the bank.  He was a very shrewd, quaint old boy,\r\n\"good for a novel.\"  He examined Goshorn's spectacles with so much\r\ninterest, that I suspect it was really the first time in his life that he\r\never fully ascertained the \"true inwardness and utilitarianism\" of such\r\nobjects.  He expressed great admiration, and said that if he had them he\r\ncould get twice as many deer as he did.  I promised to send him a pair.  I\r\nbegged from him deer-horns, which he gave me very willingly, expressing\r\nwonder that I wanted such rubbish, and at my delight.  And seeing that my\r\ncompanion had a pair, he said scornfully:\r\n\r\n\"Dave Goshorn, what do _you_ know about such things?  What's set _you_ to\r\ngittin' deer's horns?  Give 'em to this here young gentleman, who\r\nunderstands such things that we don't, and who wants 'em fur some good\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\nI will do Goshorn the justice to say that he gave them to me for a\r\nparting present.  My room at his house was quite devoid of all\r\ndecoration, but by arranging on the walls crossed canoe-paddles, great\r\nbunches of the picturesque locust-thorn, often nearly a foot in length,\r\nand the deer's horns, I made it look rather more human.  But this\r\narrangement utterly bewildered the natives, especially the maids, who\r\nnaively asked me why I hung them old bones and thorns up in my room.  As\r\nthis thorn is much used by the blacks in Voodoo, I suppose that it was\r\nall explained by being set down to my \"conjurin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid who attended to my room was a very nice, good girl, but one who\r\ncould not have been understood in England.  I found that she gathered up\r\nand treasured many utterly worthless trifling bits of pen-drawing which I\r\nthrew away.  She explained that where she came from on Coal River,\r\nanything like a picture was a great curiosity; also that her friends\r\nbelieved that all the pictures in books, newspapers, &c., were drawn by\r\nhand.  I explained to her how they were made.  When _I_ left I offered\r\nher two dollars.  She hesitated, and then said, \"Mr. Leland, there have\r\nbeen many, many gentlemen here who have offered me money, but I never\r\ntook a cent from any man till _now_.  And I _will_ take this from you to\r\nbuy something that I can remember you by, for you have always treated me\r\nkindly and like a lady.\"  In rural America such girls are really lady-\r\nhelps, and not \"servants,\" albeit those who know how to get on with them\r\nfind them the very best servants in the world; but they must be treated\r\nas _friends_.\r\n\r\nI went up Elk River several times on horse or in canoe to renew leases or\r\nto lease new land, &c.  The company sent on a very clever and intelligent\r\nrather young man named Sandford, who had been a railroad superintendent,\r\nto help me.  I liked him very much.  We had a third, a young Virginian,\r\nnamed Finnal.  At or near Cannelton I selected a spot where we put up a\r\nsteam-engine, and began to bore for oil.  It was very near the famous gas-\r\nwell which once belonged to General Washington.  This well gave forth\r\nevery week the equivalent of _one hundred and fifty_ tons of coal.  It\r\nwas utilised in a factory.  After I sunk our shaft it gave out; but I do\r\nnot believe that we stopped it, for no gas came into our well.  Finnal\r\nwas the superintendent of the well.  One day he nearly sat down--_nudo\r\npodice_--on an immense rattlesnake.  He had a little cottage and a fine\r\nhorse.  He kept the latter in a stable and painted the door _white_, so\r\nthat when waking in the night he could see if any horse-thief had opened\r\nit.  Many efforts were made to rob him of it.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lee's army was disbanded, and fully one-half came straggling\r\nin squads up the valley to Charleston to be paroled.  David Goshorn's\r\nhotel was simply crammed with Confederate officers, who slept anywhere.\r\nWith these I easily became friends; they seemed like Princeton Southern\r\ncollege mates.  Now I have to narrate a strange story.  One evening when\r\nI was sitting and smoking on the portico with some of these _bons\r\ncompagnons_ I said to one--\r\n\r\n\"People say that your men never once during the war got within sight of\r\nHarrisburg or of a Northern city.  But I believe they did.  One day when\r\nI was on guard I saw five men scout on the bank in full sight of it.  But\r\nnobody agreed with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer laughed silently, and cried aloud to a friend with a broken\r\narm in a sling, who lay within a room on a bed, \"Come out here, L---.\r\nHere is something which will interest you more than anything you ever\r\nheard before.\"\r\n\r\nHe came out, and, having heard my story, said--\r\n\r\n\"Nobody ever believed your story, nor did anybody ever believe mine.  Mine\r\nis this--that when we were at Sporting Hill a corporal of mine came in\r\nand declared that he and his men had scouted into within full sight of\r\nHarrisburg.  I knew that the man told the truth, but nobody else would\r\nbelieve that any human being dared to do such a thing, or could do it.\r\nAnd now you fully prove that it was done.\"\r\n\r\nThere came to Goshorn's three very interesting men with whom I became\r\nintimate.  One was Robert Hunt, of St. Louis.  He was of a very good\r\nVirginia family, had been at Princeton College, ran away in his sixteenth\r\nyear, took to the plains as a hunter, and for twenty-three years had\r\nranged the Wild West from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific.  At the end\r\nof the time an uncle in the Fur Company had helped him on, and he was now\r\nrich.  He was one of the most genial, gay, and festive, reckless yet\r\nalways gentlemanly men I ever knew.  He expressed great astonishment, as\r\nhe learned gradually to know me, at finding we were so congenial, and\r\nthat I had so much \"real Injun\" in me.  His eyes were first opened to\r\nthis great fact by a very singular incident, of which I can never think\r\nwithout pleasure.\r\n\r\nHunt, with two men who had been cavalry captains all through the war, and\r\nhis friend Ross, who had long been an Indian trader, and I, were all\r\nriding up Elk Valley to look at lands.  We paused at a place where the\r\nroad sloped sideways and was wet with rain.  As I was going to remount, I\r\nasked a German who stood by to hold my horse's head, and sprang into the\r\nsaddle.  Just at this critical instant--it all passed in a second--as the\r\nGerman had not heard me, my horse, feeling that he must fall over on his\r\nleft side from my weight, threw himself _completely over backward_.  As\r\nquick as thought I jumped up on his back, put my foot just between the\r\nsaddle and his tail, and took a tremendous flying leap so far that I\r\ncleared the horse.  I only muddied the palms of my gloves, on which I\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nThe elder cavalry captain said, \"When I saw that horse go over backwards,\r\nI closed my eyes and held my breath, for I expected the next second to\r\nsee you killed.\"  But Robert Hunt exclaimed, \"Good as an Injun, by God!\"\r\nAnd when I some time after made fun of it, he shook his head gravely and\r\nreprovingly, as George Ward did over the gunpowder, and said, \"It was a\r\n_magnificent_ thing!\"\r\n\r\nThat very afternoon Hunt distinguished himself in a manner which was\r\nquite as becoming an aborigine.  I was acting as guide, and knowing that\r\nthere was a ford across a tributary of the Elk, sought and thought I had\r\nfound it.  But I was mistaken, and what was horrible, we found ourselves\r\nin a deep quicksand.  On such occasions horses become, as it were,\r\ninsane, trying to throw the riders and then jump on them for support.  By\r\ngood luck we got out of it soon, but there was an _awful_ five minutes of\r\nkicking, plunging, splashing, and \"ground and lofty\" swearing.  I got\r\nacross dry by drawing my legs up before me on the saddle, _a la_ tailor,\r\nbut the others were badly wet.  But no sooner had we emerged from the\r\nstream than Robert Hunt, bursting into a tremendous \"_Ho_! _ho_!\" of deep\r\nlaughter, declared that he had shown more presence of mind during the\r\nemergency than any of us; for, brandishing his whisky flask, he declared\r\nthat while his horse was in the flurry it occurred to him that the best\r\nthing he could do was to lighten the load, and he had therefore, with\r\nincredible presence of mind, drunk up all the whisky!\r\n\r\nHowever, he afterwards confessed to me that the true reason was that,\r\nbelieving death was at hand, and thinking it a pity to die thirsty, he\r\nhad drained the bottle, as did the old Indian woman just as she went over\r\nthe Falls of Niagara.  Anyhow, the incorrigible _vaurien_ had really\r\nemptied his flask while in the \"quick.\"\r\n\r\nThough I say it, I believe that Hunt and I were a pretty well matched\r\ncouple, and many a wild prank and Indian-like joke did we play together.\r\nMore than once he expressed great astonishment that I, a man grown up in\r\ncities and to literary pursuits, should be so much at home where he found\r\nme, or so congenial.  He had been at Princeton, and, _ex pede Herculem_,\r\nhad a point whence to judge me, but it failed. {309}  His friend Ross was\r\na quiet, sensible New Englander, who reminded me of Artemus Ward, or\r\nCharles Browne.  He abounded in quaint anecdotes of Indian experiences.\r\n\r\nAs did also a Mr. Wadsworth, who had passed half his life in the Far West\r\nas a surveyor among the Chippeways.  He had written a large manuscript of\r\ntheir legends, of which Schoolcraft made great use in his _Algic_ book.  I\r\nbelieve that much of Longfellow's _Hiawatha_ owed its origin thus\r\nindirectly to Mr. Wadsworth.  In after years I wrote out many of his\r\ntales, as told to me, in articles in _Temple Bar_.\r\n\r\nThe country all about Charleston was primitively wild and picturesque,\r\nrocky, hilly, and leading to solitary life and dreams of _sylvani_ and\r\nforest fairies.  There were fountained hills, and dreamy darkling woods,\r\nand old Indian graves, and a dancing stream, across which lay a petrified\r\ntree, and everywhere a little travelled land.  I explored it with\r\nGoshorn, riding far and wide into remote mountain recesses, to get the\r\nsignatures in attestation of men who could rarely write, but on the other\r\nhand could \"shoot their mark\" with a rifle to perfection, and who would\r\nassuredly have placed such signature on me had I not been a holy\r\nmessenger of _Ile_, and an angel of coming moneyed times.\r\n\r\nOne day we stopped at a farm-house in a wild, lonely place.  There was\r\nonly an old woman there--one of the stern, resolute, hard-muscled\r\nfrontier women, the daughters of mothers who had fought \"Injuns\"--and a\r\ncalf.  And thereby hung a tale, which the three men with me fully\r\nauthenticated.\r\n\r\nThe whole country thereabouts had been for four years so worried,\r\nharried, raided, raked, plundered, and foraged by Federals and\r\nConfederates--one day the former, the next the latter; blue and grey, or\r\nsky and sea--that the old lady had nothing left to live on.  Hens, cows,\r\nhorses, corn, all had gone save one calf, the Benjamin and idol of her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nOne night she heard a piteous baaing, and, seizing a broom, rushed to the\r\nnow henless hen-house, in which she kept the calf, to find in it a full-\r\ngrown panther attacking her pet.  By this time the old lady had grown\r\ndesperate, and seizing the broom, she proceeded to \"lam\" the wild beast\r\nwith the handle, and with all her heart; and the fiend of ferocity,\r\nappalled at her attack, fled.  I saw the calf with the marks of the\r\npanther's claws, not yet quite healed; I saw the broom; and, lastly, I\r\nsaw the old woman, the mother in Ishmael; whose face was a perfect\r\nguarantee of the truth of the story.  One of us suggested that the old\r\nlady should have the calf's hide tanned and wear it as a trophy, like an\r\nIndian, which would have been a strange reversal of Shakespeare's\r\napplication of it, or to\r\n\r\n   \"Hang a calf-skin on those recreant limbs.\"\r\n\r\nThen there came the great spring freshet in Elk River, which rose\r\nunusually high, fifty feet above its summer level.  It had come to within\r\nan inch or two of my floor, and yet I went to bed and to sleep.  By a\r\nmiracle it rose no more, for I had a distinct conviction it would not,\r\nwhich greatly amazed everybody.  But many were drowned all about us.  The\r\nnext day a man who professed bone-setting and doctoring, albeit not\r\ndiplomaed, asked me to go with him and act as interpreter to a German\r\npatient who had a broken thigh.  While felling a tree far away in the\r\nforest, it thundered down on him, and kept him down for two or three days\r\ntill he was discovered.  To get to him we went in a small canoe, and\r\npaddled ourselves with shingles or wooden tiles, used to cover roofs.  On\r\nthe way I saw a man on a roof fiddling; only a bit of the roof was above\r\nwater.  He was waiting for deliverance.  Many and strange indeed were all\r\nthe scenes and incidents of that inundation, and marvellous the legends\r\nwhich were told of other freshets in the days of yore.\r\n\r\nI never could learn to play cards.  Destiny forbade it, and always\r\nstepped in promptly to stop all such proceedings.  One night Sandford and\r\nfriends sat down to teach me poker, when _bang_, _bang_, went a revolver\r\noutside, and a bullet buried itself in the door close by me.  A riotous,\r\nevil-minded darkey, who attended to my washing, had got into a fight, and\r\nwas forthwith conveyed to the Bull-pen, or military prison.  I was afraid\r\nlest I might lose my shirts, and so \"visited him\" next day and found him\r\nin irons, but reading a newspaper at his ease.  From him I learned the\r\naddress of \"the coloured lady\" who had my underclothing.\r\n\r\nThe Bull-pen was a picturesque place--a large log enclosure, full of\r\nstrange inmates, such as wild guerillas in moccasins, grey-back\r\nConfederates and blue-coat Federals guilty of many a murder, arson, and\r\nmuch horse-stealing, desolate deserters, often deserving pity--the\r\n_debris_ of a four years' war, the crumbs of the great loaf fallen to the\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nWarm weather came on, and I sent to Philadelphia for a summer suit of\r\nclothes.  It came, and it was of a _light grey colour_.  At that time\r\nOxford \"dittos,\" or a suit _pareil partout_, were unknown in West\r\nVirginia.  I was dressed from head to foot in Confederate grey.  Such a\r\ndaring defiance of public opinion, coupled with my mysterious stealing\r\ninto the rebel country, made me an object of awe and suspicion--a kind of\r\nSir Grey Steal!\r\n\r\nThere was at that time in Charleston a German artillery regiment which\r\nreally held the town--that is to say, the height which commanded it.  I\r\nhad become acquainted with its officers.  All at once they gave me the\r\ncold shoulder and cut me.  My friend Sandford was very intimate with\r\nthem.  One evening he asked their Colonel why they scorned me.  The\r\nColonel replied--\r\n\r\n\"Pecause he's a tamned repel.  Aferypody knows it.\"\r\n\r\nSandford at once explained that I was even known at Washington as a good\r\nUnion man, and had, moreover, translated Heine, adding other details.\r\n\r\n\"Gott verdammich--_heiss_!\" cried the Colonel in amazement.  \"Is dot der\r\nKarl Leland vot dranslate de _Reisebilder_?  Herr je!  I hafe got dat\r\nvery pook here on mein table!  Look at it.  Bei Gott! here's his name!\r\n_Dot_ is der crate Leland vot edit de _Continental Magazine_!  Dot moost\r\npe a fery deep man.  Und I dink _he_ vas a repel!\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning early the Colonel sent his ambulance or army waggon to\r\nmy hotel with a request that I would come and take breakfast with him.  It\r\nwas a bit of Heidelberg life over again.  We punished Rheinwein and lager-\r\nbeer in quantities.  There were old German students among the officers,\r\nand I was received like a brother.\r\n\r\nAt last Sandford and I determined to return to the East.  There was in\r\nthe hotel a coloured waiter named Harrison.  He had been a slave, but \"a\r\ngentleman's gentleman,\" was rather dignified, and allowed no ordinary\r\nwhite man to joke with him.  On the evening before my departure I said to\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Harrison, I hope that you haven't quite so bad an opinion of me as\r\nthe other people here seem to have.\"\r\n\r\nHe manifested at once a really violent emotion.  Dashing something to the\r\nground, he cried--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Leland, you _never_ did anything contrary to a gentleman.  I always\r\nmaintained it.  Now please tell me the truth.  Is it true that you're a\r\ngreat friend of Jeff Davis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn Jeff Davis!\"  I replied.\r\n\r\n\"And you ain't a major in the Confederate service?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a clear-down Abolitionist, and was born one.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you ain't had no goings on with the rebels up the river to bring\r\nback the Confederacy here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Devil a dealing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd therewith I explained how it was that I went unharmed up into the\r\nrebels' country, and great was the joy of Harrison, who, as I found, had\r\ntaken my part valiantly against those who suspected me.\r\n\r\nThere was a droll comedy the next day on board the steamboat on which I\r\ndeparted.  A certain Mr. H., who had been a rebel and recanted at the\r\neleventh hour and become a Federal official, requested everybody on board\r\nnot to notice me.  Sandford learned it all, and chuckled over it.  But\r\nthe captain and mate and crew were all still rebels at heart.  Great was\r\nmy amazement at being privately informed by the steward that the captain\r\nrequested as a favour that I would sit by him at dinner and share a\r\nbottle of wine.  I did so, and while I remained on board was treated as\r\nan honoured guest.\r\n\r\nAnd now I would here distinctly declare that, apart from my political\r\nprinciples, from which I never swerved, I always found the rebels--that\r\nis, Southern and Western men with whom I had had intimate\r\ndealings--without one exception _personally_ the most congenial and\r\nagreeable people whom I had ever met.  There was not to be found among\r\nthem what in England is known as a prig.  They were natural and\r\ngentlemanly, even down to the poorest and most uneducated.\r\n\r\nOne day Sam Fox came to me and asked me to use my influence with the\r\nCannelton Company to get him employment at their works.\r\n\r\n\"Sam,\" I replied, \"I can't do it.  It is only three weeks now, when you\r\nwere employed at another place, that you tried to stuff the overseer into\r\nthe furnace, and if the men had not prevented, you would have burned him\r\nup alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Sam, \"but he had called me a -- son --- of ---.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" I answered; \"and if he had called me _that_, I should have\r\ndone the same.  But I don't think, if I _had_ done it, I should ever have\r\nexpected to be employed again on another furnace.  You see, Samuel, my\r\nson, that these Northern men have very queer notions--_very_.\"\r\n\r\nSam was quite convinced.\r\n\r\nAt Cincinnati a trifling but droll incident occurred.  I do not set\r\nmyself up for a judge of wines, but I have naturally a delicate sense of\r\nsmell or _flair_, though not the extraordinary degree in which my brother\r\npossessed it, who never drank wine at all.  He was the first person who\r\never, in printed articles or in lectures, insisted that South New Jersey\r\nwas suitable for wine-growing.  At the hotel Sandford asked me if I could\r\ntell any wine by the taste.  I replied No, but I would try; so they gave\r\nme a glass of some kind, and I said that honestly I could only declare\r\nthat I should say it was Portugal common country wine, but I must be\r\nwrong.  Then Sandford showed the bottle, and the label declared it to be\r\ngrown in Ohio.  The next day he came to me and said, \"I believe that\r\nafter all you know a great deal about wine.  I told the landlord what you\r\nsaid, and he laughed, arid said, 'I had not the American wine which you\r\ncalled for, and so I gave you a cheap but unusual Portuguese wine.'\"  This\r\nwine is neither white nor red, and tastes like sherry and Burgundy mixed.\r\n\r\nAt Cincinnati, Sandford proposed that we should return by way of Detroit\r\nand Niagara.  I objected to the expense, but he, who knew every route and\r\nrate by heart, explained to me that, owing to the competition in railway\r\nrates, it would only cost me six shillings ($1.50) more, _plus_ $2.50\r\n(ten shillings) from New York to Philadelphia.  So we departed.  In\r\nDetroit I called on my cousin, Benjamin Stimson (the S. of \"Two Years\r\nbefore the Mast\"), and found him a prominent citizen.  So, skirting along\r\nsouthern Canada, we got to Niagara, and thence to Albany and down the\r\nHudson to New York, and so on to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me now that at this time all trace of my former life and self\r\nhad vanished.  I seemed to be only prompt to the saddle, canoe-paddle,\r\nrevolver, steamboat, and railroad.  My wife said that after this and\r\nother periods of Western travel I was always for three weeks as wild as\r\nan Indian, and so I most truly and unaffectedly was.  I did not _act_ in\r\na foolish or disorderly manner at all, but Tennessee and Elk River were\r\nin me.  Robert Hunt and Sam Fox and many more had expressed their\r\namazement at the amount of extremely familiar and congenial nature which\r\nthey had found in me, and they were quite right.  Sam and Goshorn\r\ndeclared that I was the only Northern man whom they had ever known who\r\never learned to paddle a dug-out _correctly_; but as I was obliged to do\r\nthis sometimes for fifteen hours a day _nolens volens_, it is not\r\nremarkable that I became an expert.\r\n\r\nAs regards the real unaffected feeling of wildness born to savage nature,\r\nlife, and association, it is absolutely as different from all civilised\r\nfeeling whatever as bird from fish; and it very rarely happens that an\r\neducated man ever knows what it is.  What there is of it in me which\r\nIndians recognise is, I believe, entirely due to hereditary endowment.\r\n\r\n   \"Zum Wald, zum Wald, steht mir mein Sinn.\r\n      So einzig, ach! so einzig hin.\r\n   Dort lebt man freundlich, lebt man froh,\r\n      Und nirgends, nirgends lebt man so.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not come from reading or culture--it comes of itself by nature,\r\nor not at all; nor has it over-much to do with thought.  Only in\r\nsomething like superstition can it find expression, but that must be\r\nchildlike and sweet and sincere, and without the giggling with which such\r\nsubjects are invariably received by ladies in society.\r\n\r\nI went with my wife and her mother and sister to pass some time at\r\nBethlehem, in Pennsylvania, which we did very pleasantly at a country\r\ninn.  It is a very interesting town, where a peculiar German dialect is\r\ngenerally spoken.  There was a very respectable wealthy middle-aged lady,\r\na Pennsylvanian by birth, who avoided meeting us at table because she\r\ncould not speak English.  And when I was introduced to her, I made\r\nmatters worse by speaking to her naturally in broad South German,\r\nwhereupon she informed me that she spoke _Hoch_-Deutsch!  But I made\r\nmyself popular among the natives with my German, and our landlord was\r\nimmensely proud of me.  I wasn't \"one of dem city fellers dat shames\r\ndemselfs of de Dutch,\" not I.  \"Vy, I dells you vot, mein Gott! he's\r\n_proud_ of it!\"\r\n\r\nI ended the summer at beautiful Lenox, in Massachusetts, in the charming\r\ncountry immortalised in \"Elsie Venner\"; of which work, and my letter on\r\nit to Dr. Holmes, and my conversation with him thereanent, I might fill a\r\nchapter.  But \"let us not talk about them but pass on.\"  I returned to\r\nPhiladelphia and to my father's house, where I remained one year.\r\n\r\nI had for a long time, at intervals, been at work on a book to be\r\nentitled the \"Origin of American Popular Phrases.\"  I had scissored from\r\nnewspapers, collected from negro minstrels and Western rustics, and\r\ninnumerable New England friends, as well as books and old songs and comic\r\nalmanacs and the like, a vast amount of valuable material.  This work,\r\nwhich had cost me altogether a full year's labour, had been accepted by a\r\nNew York publisher, and was in the printer's hands.  I never awaited\r\nanything with such painful anxiety as I did this publication, for I had\r\nnever been in such straits nor needed money so much, and it seemed as if\r\nthe more earnestly I sought for employment the more it evaded me.  And\r\nthen almost as soon as my manuscript was in the printer's hands his\r\noffice was burned, and the work perished, for I had not kept a copy.\r\n\r\nIt was a great loss, but from the instant when I heard of it to this day\r\nI never had five minutes' trouble over it, and more probably not one.  I\r\nhad done my _very best_ to make a good book and some money, and could do\r\nno more.  When I was a very small boy I was deeply impressed with the\r\nstory in the \"Arabian Nights\" of the prisoner who knew that he was going\r\nto be set free because a rat had run away with his dinner.  So I, at the\r\nage of seven, announced to my father that I believed that whenever a man\r\nhad bad luck, good was sure to follow, which opinion he did not accept.\r\nAnd to this day I hold it, because, reckoning up the chances of life, it\r\nis true for most people.  At any rate, I derived some comfort from the\r\nfact that the accident was reported in all the newspapers all over the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nAbout the 1st of July, 1866, we left my father's house to go to Cape May,\r\nwhere we remained for two months.  In September we went to a very good\r\nboarding-house in Philadelphia, kept by Mrs. Sandgren.  She possessed and\r\nshowed me Tegner's original manuscript of \"Anna and Axel.\"  I confess\r\nthat I never cared over-much for Tegner, and that I infinitely prefer the\r\noriginal Icelandic Saga of Frithiof to his sago-gruel imitation of strong\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.  LIFE ON THE PRESS.  1866-1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nI become managing editor of John W. Forney's _Press_--Warwick the King-\r\nmaker--The dead duck--A trip to Kansas in the old buffalo days--Miss\r\nSusan Blow, of St. Louis--The Iron Mountain of Missouri--A strange\r\ndream--Rattlesnakes--Kaw Indians--I am adopted into the tribe--Grand war-\r\ndance and ceremonies--Open-air lodgings--Prairie fires--In a dangerous\r\ncountry--Indian victims--H.

Colonel Forney wanted a managing\r\neditor for the _Press_, and, as I found in due time, not so much a man of\r\nenterprise and a leader--that _he_ supplied--nor yet one to practically\r\nrun the journal--that his son John, a young man of eighteen, supplied--so\r\nmuch as a steady, trustworthy, honest _pivot_ on which the compass could\r\nturn during his absences--and that _I_ supplied.  I must, to explain the\r\nsituation, add gently that John, who could not help it considering his\r\nexperiences, was, to put it mildly, a little irregular, rendering a\r\nsteady manager absolutely necessary.  It was a great pity, for John the\r\njunior was extremely clever as a practical managing editor, remembering\r\neverything, and knowing--what I never did or could--all the little\r\ntricks, games, and wiles of all the reporters and others employed.\r\n\r\nColonel Forney was such a remarkable character, and had such a great\r\ninfluence for many years in American politics, that as I had a great deal\r\nto do with him--very much more than was generally known--at a time when\r\nhe struck his greatest political _coup_, in which, as he said, I greatly\r\naided him, I will here dwell on him a space.  Before I knew him I called\r\nhim Warwick the King-maker, for it was generally admitted that it was to\r\nhis intense hatred of Buchanan, added to his speech-making, editing, and\r\ntremendously vigorous and not always over-scrupulous intriguing, that\r\n\"Ten-cent Jimmy\" owed his defeat.  At this time, in all presidential\r\nelections, Pennsylvania turned the scale, and John Forney could and did\r\nturn Pennsylvania like a Titan; and he frankly admitted that he owed the\r\nsuccess of his last turn to me, as I shall in time relate.\r\n\r\nForney's antipathies were always remarkably well placed.  He hated\r\nBuchanan; also, for certain personal reasons, he hated Simon Cameron; and\r\nfinally it came to pass that he hated Andrew Johnson with a hatred of\r\ntwenty-four carats--an _aquafortis_ detestation--and for a most singular\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOne night when this \"President by the pistol, and smallest potato in the\r\nAmerican garden of liberty,\" was making one of his ribald speeches, after\r\nhaving laid out Horace Greeley, some one in the crowd cried--\r\n\r\n\"Now give us _John Forney_!\"\r\n\r\nWith an air of infinite contempt the President exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"I don't waste _my_ powder on dead ducks.\"\r\n\r\nHe had better have left that word unsaid, for it ruined him.  It woke\r\nColonel John Forney up to the very highest pitch of his fighting \"Injun,\"\r\nor, as they say in Pennsylvania, his \"Dutch.\"  He had always been to that\r\nhour a genial man, like most politicians, a little too much given to the\r\nsocial glass.  But from that date of the dead duck he became \"total\r\nabstinence,\" and concentrated all his faculties and found all his\r\nexcitement in vengeance hot and strong, without a grain of sugar.  In\r\nwhich I gladly sympathised and aided, for I detested Johnson as a\r\nrenegade Copperhead, or rather venomous toad to the South, who wished\r\nwith all his soul to undo Lincoln's work and bring in the Confederacy.\r\nAnd I believe, on my life and soul, that if John Forney had not defeated\r\nhim, we should have had such disasters as are now inconceivable, the\r\nleast of them being a renewal of the war.  Johnson had renegaded from the\r\nConfederacy because, being only a tailor, he had ranked as a \"low white,\"\r\nor something despised even by \"quality\" negroes.  The Southern\r\naristocracy humbugged him by promising that if he would betray the Union\r\nhe should be regarded as one of themselves, by which very shallow cheat\r\nhe was--as a snob would be--easily caught, and in due time cast off.\r\n\r\nI had been but a few weeks on the _Press_, and all was going on well,\r\nwhen one morning the Colonel abruptly asked me if I could start in the\r\nmorning for Fort Riley, of which all I knew was that it constituted an\r\nextreme frontier station in Kansas.  There was to be a Kansas Pacific\r\nrailway laid out, and a large party of railroad men intended to go as far\r\nas the last surveyor's camp.  Of course, a few editors had been invited\r\nto write up the road, and these in turn sent some one in their place.  I\r\nknew at once that I should have something like the last year's wild life\r\nover again, and I was delighted.  I borrowed John Forney's revolver,\r\nprovided an agate-point and \"manifold paper\" for duplicate letters to our\r\n\"two papers, both daily,\" and at the appointed hour was at the railway\r\nstation.  There had been provided for us the director's car, a very large\r\nand extremely comfortable vehicle, with abundance of velvet \"settees\" or\r\ndivan sofas, with an immense stock of lobster-salad, cold croquettes,\r\ngame, with \"wines of every fineness,\" and excellent waiters.  The\r\nexcursion, indeed, cost 1,000 pounds; but it was made to pay, and that to\r\ngreat profit.\r\n\r\nWe were all a very genial, congenial party of easy-going geniuses.  There\r\nwas Hassard, the \"day editor\" of the _New York Tribune_, who had been\r\nwith me on the _Cyclopaedia_, and to whom I was much attached, for he was\r\na gentlemanly scholar, and withal had seen enough of life on the\r\n_Tribune_ to hold his own with any man; and Captain William Colton, who\r\nhad been with me in Tennessee; Robert Lamborn, who had studied science in\r\nGermany, and was now a railroad man, and many more who are recorded in my\r\npamphlet, \"Three Thousand Miles in a Railway Car,\" and my old associate,\r\nCaspar Souder, of the _Bulletin_.  This excursion was destined, in\r\nconnection with this pamphlet, to have a marvellous effect on my future\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn every town where we paused--and our pauses were frequent, as we\r\ntravelled very much on the \"go-as-you-please\" plan--we were received by\r\nthe authorities with honour and speeches and invited to dinners or\r\ndrinks.  Our conductors were courtesy itself.  One afternoon one of them\r\non a rough bit of road said, \"Gentlemen, whenever you wish to open a\r\nbottle of champagne, please to pull the cord and stop the train.  You can\r\nthen drink without spilling your wine.\"\r\n\r\nSo we went to Chicago and St. Louis, where we were entertained by Mr.\r\nBlow, and where I became acquainted with his daughter Susan.  She was\r\nthen a beautiful blonde, and, as I soon found, very intelligent and\r\ncultured.  She was long years afterwards busy in founding philanthropic\r\nschools in St. Petersburg, Russia, when I was there--a singularly noble\r\nwoman.  However, at this time neither of us dreamed of the school-keeping\r\nwhich we were to experience in later years.  At this soiree, and indeed\r\nfor the excursion the next day, we had as a guest Mr. Walter, of the\r\nLondon _Times_.\r\n\r\nThe next day we had a special train and an excursion of ladies and\r\ngentlemen to visit the marvellous Knob or Iron Mountain.  This is an\r\nimmense conical hill with a deep surrounding dale, beyond which rise\r\nother hills all of nearly solid iron.  Returning that evening in the\r\ntrain, a very strange event took place.  There was with us a genial,\r\npleasant, larky young fellow, one of the famous family of the MacCooks.\r\nWhen the war came on he was at college--went into the army, fought\r\nhard--rose to be captain, and then after the peace went back to the\r\ncollege and finished his studies.  This was the \"event.\"  We were telling\r\nstories of dreams; when it came to my turn I said:--\r\n\r\n\"In 1860 I had never been in Ohio, nor did I know anything about it.  One\r\nnight--it was at Reading, Pennsylvania--I fell asleep, I dreamed that I\r\n_woke up_, rose from the bed, went to the match-box, struck a light, and\r\nwhile it burned observed the room, which was just the same as when I had\r\nretired.  The match went out.  I lit another, when what was my amazement\r\nto observe that _everything in the room had changed its colour to a rich\r\nbrown_!  Looking about me, I saw on a kind of _etagere_ scores of half-\r\nburned candles in candlesticks, as if there had been a ball.  I lighted\r\nnearly all of them.  Hearing a sound as of sweeping and the knocking of a\r\nbroom-handle without, I went into the next room, which was the hall where\r\nthe dance had been held.  A very stupid fellow was sweeping it out.  I\r\nasked him where I was.  He could not reply intelligently.  There came\r\ninto the hall a bustling, pleasant woman, rather small, who I saw at a\r\nglance was the housekeeper.  She said something to the man as to the\r\nroom's being dark.  I remarked that there was light enough in my room,\r\nfor I had lit all the candles.  She cried, laughing, 'What extravagance!'\r\nI answered, 'My dear little woman, what does a candle or two signify to\r\nyou?  Now please tell me where I am.  Last night I went to sleep in\r\nReading, Pennsylvania.  Where am I now?'  She replied (and of this word I\r\nwas not sure), 'In _Columbus_, Ohio.'  I asked if there was any prominent\r\nman in the place who was acquainted with Philadelphia, and who might aid\r\nme to return.  She reflected, and said that Judge _Duer_ and his two\r\ndaughters (of whom I had never heard) had just returned from the East.\"\r\n\r\nHere MacCook interrupted me eagerly: \"You were not in Columbus, but in\r\n_Dayton_, Ohio.  And it was not Judge Duer, but Judge _Duey_, with his\r\ntwo daughters, who was that summer in the East.\"  I went on:--\r\n\r\n\"I left the room and went into the hall.  I came to the front door.  Far\r\ndown below me I saw a winding river and a steamboat.\"\r\n\r\nHere MacCook spoke again: \"That was _surely_ Dayton.  I know the house\r\nand the view.  But it could not have been Columbus.\"  I went on:--\r\n\r\n\"I went downstairs too far by mistake into the cellar.  There I found a\r\nman sawing wood.  I went up again.  [Pray observe that a year _after_,\r\nwhen I went West, this very incident occurred one morning in Cincinnati,\r\nOhio.]  I found in the bar-room three respectable-looking men.  I told\r\nthem my story.  One said to the others, 'He is always the same old\r\nfellow!'  I stared at him in amazement.  He held out one hand and moved\r\nthe other as if fiddling.  Monotonous creaking sounds followed, and I\r\ngradually awoke.  The same sounds continued, but they were caused by the\r\ngrasshoppers and tree-toads, who pipe monotonously all night long in\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nNothing ever came of the dream, but it all occurred _exactly_ as I\r\ndescribe it.  I have had several quite as strange.  Immediately after I\r\nhad finished my narration, some one, alluding to our party, asked if\r\nthere was any one present who could sing \"Hans Breitmann's Barty,\" and I\r\nastonished them not a little by proclaiming that I was the author, and by\r\nsinging it.\r\n\r\nWe went on to Leavenworth, where we had a dinner at the hotel which was\r\nworthy of Paris.  We had, for example, prairie pullets or half-grown\r\ngrouse, wild turkeys and tender venison.  Thence to Fort Riley, and so on\r\nin waggons to the last surveyor's camp.  I forget where it was on the\r\nroute that we stopped over-night at a fort, where I found some old\r\nfriends and made new ones.  A young officer--Lieutenant Brown, I\r\nthink--gave me a bed in his cabin.  His ceiling was made of canvas.  For\r\nweeks he had heard a great rattlesnake moving about on it.  One day he\r\nhad made a hole in the ceiling and put into it a great fierce tom-cat.\r\nThe cat \"went for\" the snake and there was an awful row.  After a time\r\nthe cat came out looking like a devil with every hair on end, made\r\nstraight for the prairie, and was never heard of again.  Neither was the\r\nsnake.  They had finished one another.  On another occasion, when sitting\r\nin a similar cabin, my gentle hostess, an officer's wife, whom I had\r\nknown a few years before as a beauty in society, remarked that she had\r\ntwo large rattlesnakes in her ceiling, and that if we would be silent we\r\nmight hear them crawling about.  They could not be taken out without\r\nrebuilding the roof.\r\n\r\nCaptain Colton had just recovered from a very bad attack of fever and\r\nague, and, being young, had the enormous appetite which follows weeks of\r\nquinine.  I saw him this day eat a full meal of beefsteaks, and then\r\nimmediately after devour another, at Brown's, of buffalo-meat.  The air\r\nof the Plains causes incredible hunger.  We all played a good knife and\r\nfork.\r\n\r\nAbout twilight-tide there came in a very gentlemanly Catholic priest.  I\r\nwas told that he was a roving missionary.  He led a charmed life, for he\r\nwent to visit the wildest tribes, and was everywhere respected.  I\r\nconversed with him in French.  After a while he spread his blanket, lay\r\ndown on the floor and slept till morning, when he read his prayers and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nThe next day the fort square was full of Kaw Indians, all in savage\r\narray, about to depart for their autumnal buffalo-hunt.  I met one\r\nvenerable heathen with his wife and babe, with whom I made genial\r\nacquaintance.  I asked the wife the name for a whip; she replied\r\n_B'meergashee_; a pony was _shoonga_, the nose _hin_, and a woman _shimmy-\r\nshindy_!  I bought his whip for a dollar.  The squaw generously offered\r\nto throw in the baby, which I declined, and we all laughed and parted.\r\n\r\nI went to the camp, and there the whole party, seeing my curious whip,\r\nwent at the Kaws to buy theirs.  Bank-bills were our only currency then,\r\nand the Indians knew there were such things as counterfeits.  They\r\nconsulted together, eyed us carefully, and then every man as he received\r\nhis dollar brought it to me for approval.  By chance I knew the Pawnee\r\nword for \"good\" (_Washitaw_), and they also knew it.  Then came a strange\r\nwild scene.  I spoke to the chief, and pointing to my whip said,\r\n\"_B'meergashee_\" and indicating a woman and a pony, repeated, \"_Shimmy-\r\nshindy_, _shoonga-hin_,\" intimating that its use was to chastise women\r\nand ponies by hitting them on the nose.  Great was the amazement and\r\ndelight of the Kaws, who roared with laughter, and their chief curiously\r\ninquired, \"_You_ Kaw?\"  To which I replied, \"_O_, _nitchee_, _me_ Kaw,\r\n_washita_ good Injun me.\"  He at once embraced me with frantic joy, as\r\ndid the others, to the great amazement of my friends.  A wild circular\r\ndance was at once improvised to celebrate my reception into the tribe; at\r\nwhich our driver Brigham dryly remarked that he didn't wonder they were\r\nglad to get me, for I was the first Injun ever seen in that tribe with a\r\nwhole shirt on him.  This was the order of proceedings:--I stood in the\r\ncentre and sang wildly the following song, which was a great favourite\r\nwith our party, and all joining in the chorus:--\r\n\r\n   I slew the chief of the Muscolgee;\r\n   I burnt his squaw at the blasted tree!\r\n   By the hind-legs I tied up the cur,\r\n   He had no time to fondle on her.\r\n\r\n   _Chorus_.\r\n\r\n   Hoo! hoo! hoo! the Muscolgee!\r\n   Wah, wah, wah! the blasted tree!\r\n\r\n   A faggot from the blasted tree\r\n   Fired the lodge of the Muscolgee;\r\n   His sinews served to string my bow\r\n   When bent to lay his brethren low.\r\n\r\n   _Chorus_.\r\n\r\n   Hoo! hoo! hoo! the Muscolgee!\r\n   Wah, wah, wah! the blasted tree!\r\n\r\n   I stripped his skull all naked and bare,\r\n   And here's his skull with a tuft of hair!\r\n   His heart is in the eagle's maw,\r\n   His bloody bones the wolf doth gnaw.\r\n\r\n   _Chorus_.\r\n\r\n   Hoo! hoo! hoo! the Muscolgee!\r\n   Wah, wah, wah! the blasted tree!\r\n\r\nThe Indians yelled and drummed at the Reception Dance.  \"Now you good\r\nKaw--Good Injun you be--all same me,\" said the chief.  Hassard and\r\nLamborn cracked time with their whips, and, in short, we made a grand\r\ncircular row; truly it was a wondrous striking scene!  From that day I\r\nwas called the Kaw chief, even by Hassard in his letters to the\r\n_Tribune_, in which he mentioned that in scenes of excitement I rode and\r\nwhooped like a savage.  It _may_ be so--_I_ never noticed it; perhaps he\r\nexaggerated, but I must admit that I do like Indians, and they like me.\r\nWe took ambulances or strong covered army-waggons and pushed on.  We were\r\nnow well out on the plains.  All day long we passed prairie-dog villages\r\nand saw antelopes bounding afar.  At night we stopped at the hotel _Alla\r\nFresca_, or slept in the open air.  It was perfectly delightful, though\r\nin November.  Far in the distance many prairie fires stretched like miles\r\nof blazing serpents over the distance.  I thought of the innumerable camp-\r\nfires before the battle of Gettysburg, and determined that the two were\r\namong the most wonderful sights of my life.  We rose very early in the\r\nmorning, by grey light, and after a drink of whisky pushed on.  I may\r\nhere mention that from 1863 for six years I very rarely indeed tasted any\r\nintoxicant.\r\n\r\nSo we went on till we reached the last surveyor's camp.  We had not been\r\nthere half an hour before a man came in declaring that he had just saved\r\nhis scalp, having seen a party of Apaches in their war-paint, but luckily\r\nhid himself before they discovered him.  It was evident that we had now\r\ngot beyond civilisation.  Already, on the way, we had seen ranches which\r\nhad been recently burned by the Indians, who had killed their inmates.\r\nOne man, observing my Kaw whip, casually remarked that as I was fond of\r\ncuriosities he was sorry that he had not kept six arrows which he had\r\nlately pulled out of a man whom he had found lying dead in the road, and\r\nwho had just been shot by the Indians.\r\n\r\nWithin this same hour after our arrival there came in a Lieutenant\r\nHesselberger, bringing with him a Mrs. Box and her two daughters, one\r\nabout sixteen and the other twelve.  The Indians had on the Texas\r\nfrontier murdered and scalped her husband before her eyes, burned their\r\nhome, and carried the three into captivity, where for six months they\r\nwere daily subjected to such _incredible_ outrages and cruelty that it\r\nwas simply a miracle that they survived.  As it was, they looked exactly\r\nlike corpses.  Lieutenant Hesselberger, with bravery beyond belief,\r\nhaving heard of these captives, went alone to the Indians to ransom them.\r\nFirstly, they fired guns unexpectedly close to his head, and finding that\r\nhe did not start, brought out the captives and subjected them to the\r\nextremes of gross abuse before his eyes, and repeatedly knocked them down\r\nwith clubs, all of which he affected to disregard.  At last the price was\r\nagreed on and he took them away.\r\n\r\nIn after years, when I described all this in London to Stanley, the\r\nAfrican explorer, he said, \"Strange!  I, too, was there that very day,\r\nand saw those women, and wrote an account of it to the _New York\r\nHerald_.\"  I daresay that I met and talked to him at the time among those\r\nwhom we saw.\r\n\r\nNot far from our camp there was a large and well-populated beaver-dam,\r\nwhich I studied with great interest.  It was more like a well regulated\r\ntown than is many a western mining village.  I do not wonder that Indians\r\nregard _Quahbeet_, the beaver, as a human being in disguise.  N.B.--The\r\nbeaver always, when he cuts a stick, sharpens it like a lead-pencil--which\r\nindicates an artistic nature.\r\n\r\nIt was now resolved that a number of our party should go into the Smoky\r\nHill country to attend a very great Indian council, while the rest\r\nreturned home.  So I joined the adventurers.  The meeting was not held,\r\nfor I believe the Indians went to war.  But we rode on.  One morning I\r\nsaw afar a few black specks, and thought they were cattle.  And so they\r\nwere, but the free cattle of the plains, or buffaloes.  That evening, as\r\nwe were out of meat, Colton and others went out to hunt them, and had a\r\nfine chase, but got nothing.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Colton kindly gave me his chance--that is, he resigned\r\nto me a splendid black horse used to the business--and most of us went to\r\nthe field.  After a while, or a four miles' run, we came up with a\r\nnumber.  There was a fine cow singled out and shot at, and I succeeded in\r\nputting a ball in just behind the shoulder.  Among us all she became\r\nbeef, and an expert hunter with us, whose business it was to supply the\r\ncamp with meat, skinned and butchered her and cooked a meal for us on the\r\nspot.  The beef was deliciously tender and well flavoured.\r\n\r\nNow, before this cooking, in the excitement of the chase, I had ridden on\r\nlike an Indian, as Hassard said in his letter, whooping like one all\r\nalone after the buffalo, and in my joy forgot to shake the spent\r\ncartridge out of my Spenser seven-shooter carbine.  All at once I found\r\nmyself right in the herd, close by a monstrous bull, whose height at the\r\ninstant when he turned on me to gore me seemed to be about a hundred and\r\nfifty feet.  But my horse was used to this, and swerved with incredible\r\ntact and swiftness, while I held on.  I then had a perfectly close shot,\r\nnot six feet off, under the shoulder, and I raised the carbine and pulled\r\ntrigger, when it--_ticked_!  I had forgotten the dead cartridge, and was\r\nnot used to the arm which I carried.  I think that I swore, and if I did\r\nnot I am sorry for it.  Before I could arrange my charge the buffaloes\r\nwere far away.\r\n\r\n{Stairs of rock: p329.jpg}\r\n\r\nHowever, we had got our cow, and that was more than we really needed.  At\r\nany rate, I had shot a buffalo and had a stupendous run.  And here I must\r\nmention that while racing and whooping, I executed the most insanely\r\nfoolish thing I ever did in all my life, which astonished the hunter and\r\nall present to the utmost.  I was at the top of a declivity from which\r\nthere descended a flight of natural stairs of rock, but every one very\r\nbroad, like the above sketch.\r\n\r\nAnd being inspired by the devil, and my horse not objecting at all, I\r\nclattered down over it at full speed _a la_ Putnam.  I have heard that\r\nIndians do this very boldly, declaring that it is perfectly safe if the\r\nrider is not afraid, and I am quite sure that mine must have been an\r\nIndian horse.  I hope that no one will think that I have put forward or\r\nmade too much of these trifling boyish tricks of recklessness.  They are\r\nof daily occurrence in the Wild West among men who like excitement, and\r\nhad Robert Hunt been among us there would have been fun indeed.\r\n\r\nSo we turned homewards, for the Indian Conference had proved a failure.\r\nWe had for our driver a man named Brigham, to whom I had taken a great\r\nliking.  He had lived as a trader among the wildest Indians, spoke\r\nSpanish fluently, and knew the whole Western frontier like his pocket.\r\nThe day after we had seen Mrs. Box come in, I was praising the braveness\r\nof Lieutenant Hesselberger in venturing to rescue her.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't all bravery at all,\" said Brigham.  \"He's brave as a panther,\r\nbut there's more in it than _that_.  There is about one man in a hundred,\r\nand not more, who can go among the most God-forsaken devils of Injuns and\r\nnever get hurt.  The Injuns take to them at a glance and love 'em.  _I'm_\r\nsuch a man, and I've proved it often enough, God knows!  Lieutenant\r\nHesselberger is one, and,\" he added abruptly, \"Mr. Leland, _you're_\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\" I said, greatly surprised.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause I've watched you.  You've got Injun ways that you don't know of.\r\nDidn't I notice the other day, when the gentlemen were buying the whips\r\nfrom the Kaws, that every Injun took a squint, and then came straight to\r\n_you_?  Why didn't they go to one of the other gentlemen?  Because\r\nthey've got an instinct like a dog for their friends, and for such as\r\n_we_.\"\r\n\r\nWe were coming to Fort Harker.  I forget how it all came about, but we\r\nfound ourselves afoot, with a mile or two to walk, carrying our guns,\r\ncarpet-bags, and _petites bagages_, while about fifty yards ahead or more\r\nthere was Brigham driving on merrily to the fort, under the impression\r\nthat we had secured other conveyance.\r\n\r\nCaptain Colton fired his carbine.  It made about as much noise as a\r\npercussion-cap, and the wind was from Brigham toward us.  Carried away by\r\nan impulse, I caught Colonel Lamborn's light rifle out of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Great God!\" he cried, \"you don't mean to shoot at him?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll insure the mules,\" I said, \"I will the driver.\"  My\r\ncalculation was to send a bullet so near to Brigham that he could hear it\r\nwhizz, but not to touch him.  It was not so dangerous as the shot I had\r\nfired over Sam Fox, and the \"spirit\" was on me!\r\n\r\nBut I did _not_ know that in the covered waggon sat Hassard talking with\r\nBrigham, their faces being, as Hassard declared, just about six inches\r\napart.  I fired, and the bullet passed just between their noses!\r\n\r\nHassard heard the whizz, and cried, \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Injuns_, by God!\" roared Brigham, forgetting that we had left the\r\nIndian country two days behind us.  \"Lie down in the waggon while I\r\ndrive.\"  And drive he did, till out of gunshot, and then putting his face\r\nout, turned around, and gave in full desperate cry the taunting war-whoop\r\nof the Cheyennes.  It was a beautiful sight that of Brigham's broad red\r\nface wild with rage--and his great gold earrings and Mexican\r\nsombrero--turning round the waggon at us in defiance like Marmion!\r\n\r\nBut when he realised that _we_ had fired at him, just as a pack of d---d\r\nApaches might have done, for fun, to stop the waggon, his expression\r\nbecame one of utter bewilderment.  As I came up I thought there might be\r\na shindy.\r\n\r\n\"Brigham,\" I said in Spanish, \"_es la mano o el navajo_?\"  [Is it to be\r\nhand, or knife?]\r\n\r\nBrigham was proud of his Spanish; it was his elegant accomplishment, and\r\nthis was a good scene.  Grasping my hand cordially, he said, \"_La mano_.\"\r\nLike a true frontiersman, he felt in a minute the _grandeur_ of the joke.\r\nThere was, if I may so vulgarly express myself, an _Indian-uity_ in it\r\nwhich appealed to his deepest feelings.  There was a silence for several\r\nminutes, which he broke by exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"I've driven waggons now this twelve years on the frontier, but I never\r\nheard before of tryin' to stop the waggon by shootin' at the driver.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another long silent pause, when he resumed--\r\n\r\n\"I wish to God there was a gulch (ravine) between here and the fort!  I'd\r\nupset this crowd into it d---d quick!\"\r\n\r\nThat evening I took leave of Brigham.  I drank healths with him in\r\nwhisky, and shook hands, and said--\r\n\r\n\"I did a very foolish and reckless thing to-day, Brigham, when I shot at\r\nyou, and I am sorry for it, and I beg your pardon.  Here is a dagger\r\nwhich I have had for twenty-five years.  I carried it all over Europe.  I\r\nhave nothing better to give you; please take it.  And when you stick a\r\nGreaser (Mexican) with it, as I expect you will do some day, then think\r\nof me.\"\r\n\r\nThe tears rose to his eyes, and he departed.  I never met him again, but\r\n\"well I wot\" he ever had kindly remembrance of me.  We were to be guests\r\nof General Custer at the fort, and I was rather shy of meeting the\r\ncastellan after firing at his driver!  But he greeted me with a hearty\r\nburst of laughter, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Leland, you have the most original way of ringing a bell when you\r\nwant to call a carriage that I ever heard of.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Hassard, when he witnessed my parting with Brigham, he said--\r\n\r\n\"This is all mighty fine! daggers and whisky, and all kinds of beautiful\r\nthings flying around for Brigham, but what am _I_ to have?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what dost thou expect, son Hassard?\" I replied.\r\n\r\nHolding out both his hands, he replied--\r\n\r\n\"Much tobacco! much tobacco!\"\r\n\r\nThis was in allusion to a story told us by Lieutenant Brown.  Not long\r\nbefore, the Lieutenant, seeing, as he thought, a buffalo, had fired at\r\nit.  But the buffalo turned out to be an Indian on a pony; and the Indian\r\nriding fiercely at the Lieutenant, cried aloud for indemnity or the\r\n\"blood-fine\" in the words, \"Much tobacco!\"  And so I stood cigars.\r\n\r\nLife is worth living for--or it would be--if it abounded more in such\r\ntypes as Mrs. General Custer and her husband.  There was a bright and\r\njoyous chivalry in that man, and a noble refinement mingled with constant\r\ngaiety in the wife, such as I fear is passing from the earth.  Her books\r\nhave shown that she was a woman of true culture, and that she came by it\r\neasily, as he did, and that out of a little they could make more than\r\nmost do from a life of mere study.  I fear that there will come a time\r\nwhen such books as hers will be the only evidences that there were ever\r\nsuch people--so fearless, so familiar with every form of danger,\r\nprivation, and trial, and yet joyous and even reckless of it all.  Good\r\nSouthern blood and Western experiences had made them free of petty\r\ntroubles.  The Indians got his scalp at last, and with him went one of\r\nthe noblest men whom America ever brought forth. {333}\r\n\r\nThat evening they sent for a Bavarian-Tyroler soldier, who played\r\nbeautifully on the cithern.  As I listened to the _Jodel-lieder_ airs I\r\nseemed to be again in his native land.  It was a pleasure to me to hear\r\nfrom him the familiar dialect.\r\n\r\nAt St. Louis we were very kindly entertained in several distinguished\r\nhouses.  At one they gave us some excellent Rhine wine.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of this?\" said Hassard, who was a good Latinist.\r\n\r\nI replied, \"Vinum Rhenense decus et gloria mense.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next we had Moselle wine.  \"And what of this?\"\r\n\r\nI answered, \"Vinuin Moslanum fuit omne tempore sanum.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here I would say that every memory which I have of Missouri (and\r\nthere are more by far than this book indicates), as of Missourians, is\r\nextremely pleasant.  The State is very beautiful, and I have found among\r\nmy friends there born such culture and kindness and genial hospitality as\r\nI have never seen surpassed.  To the names of Mary A. Owen, {334}  Blow,\r\nMark Twain, and the Choteaus I could add many more.\r\n\r\nSo we jogged on homeward.  I resumed my work.  I had written out all the\r\ndetails of our trip in letters to the _Press_.  They had excited\r\nattention.  The Pennsylvania Railroad Company suggested that they should\r\nbe published in a pamphlet.  I did so, and called it \"Three Thousand\r\nMiles in a Railroad Car.\"  They offered to pay me a very good sum for my\r\ntrouble in so doing.  I declined it, because I felt that I had been amply\r\npaid by the pleasure which I had derived from the journey.  But I\r\nreceived grateful recognition subsequently in another form.  The pamphlet\r\nwas most singular of its kind.  It was a full report of all the\r\nstatistics and vast advantages of the Kansas Pacific Road.  It contained\r\nvery valuable facts and figures; and it was all served up with jokes,\r\nsongs, buffalo-hunting, Indians, and Brigham.  It was a marvellous\r\nfarrago, and it \"took.\"  It was sent to every member of Congress and\r\n\"every other man.\"\r\n\r\nBefore it appeared, a friend of mine named Ringwalt, who was both a\r\nliterary man and owner of a printing-office, offered me $200 if I would\r\nsecure him the printing of it.  I said that I would not take the money,\r\nbut that I would get him the printing, which I easily did; but being a\r\nvery honourable man, he was led to discharge the obligation.  One day he\r\nsaid to me, \"Why don't you publish your 'Breitmann Ballads?'  Everybody\r\nis quoting them now.\"  I replied, \"There is not a publisher in America\r\nwho would accept them.\"  And I was quite right, for there was not.  He\r\nanswered, \"I will print them for you.\"  I accepted the offer, but when\r\nthey were set up an idea occurred to me by which I could save my friend\r\nhis expenses.  I went to a publisher named T. B. Peterson, who said\r\neffectively this--\"The book will not sell more than a thousand copies.\r\nThere will be about a thousand people who will buy it, even for fifty\r\ncents, so I shall charge that, though it would be, as books go, only as a\r\ntwenty-five cent work.\"  He took it and paid my friend for the\r\ncomposition.  I was not to receive any money or share in the profits till\r\nall the expenses had been paid.\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson immediately sold 2,000--4,000--I know not how many\r\nthousands--at fifty cents a copy.  It was republished in Canada and\r\nAustralia, to my loss.  An American publisher who owned a magazine asked\r\nme, through his editor, to write for it a long Breitmann poem.  I did so,\r\nmaking, however, an explicit verbal arrangement _that it should not be\r\nrepublished as a book_.  It was, however, immediately republished as\r\nsuch, with a title to the effect that it was the \"Breitmann Ballads.\"  I\r\nappealed to the editor, and it was withdrawn, but I know not how many\r\nwere issued, to my loss.\r\n\r\nI had transferred the whole right of publication in England to my friend\r\nNicolas Trubner, whom I had met when he had visited America, and I wrote\r\nspecially for his edition certain poems.  John \"Camden\" Hotten wrote to\r\nme modestly asking me to give _him_ the sole right to republish the work.\r\nHe said, \"I hardly know what to say about the price.  Suppose we say _ten\r\npounds_!\"  I replied, \"Sir, I have given the whole right of publication\r\nto Mr. Trubner, and I would not take it from him for ten thousand\r\npounds.\"  Hotten at once published an edition which was a curiosity of\r\nignorance and folly.  There was a blunder on an average to every page.  He\r\nhad annotated it!  He explained that _Knasterbart_ meant \"a nasty\r\nfellow,\" and that the French _garce_ was _gare_, \"a railway station!\"\r\nTrubner had sold 5,000 copies before this precious affair appeared.  After\r\nHotten's death the British public were informed in an obituary that he\r\nhad \"_first_ introduced me\" to their knowledge!\r\n\r\nHans Breitmann became a type.  I never heard of but one German who ever\r\nreviled the book, and that was a Democratic editor in Philadelphia.  But\r\nthe Germans themselves recognised that the pen which poked fun at them\r\nwas no poisoned stiletto.  Whenever there was a grand German procession,\r\nHans was in it--the indomitable old _Degen_ hung with _loot_--and he\r\nappeared in every fancy ball.  Nor were the Confederates offended.  One\r\nof the most genial, searching, and erudite reviews of the work, which\r\nappeared in a Southern magazine (De Bow's), declared that I had truly\r\nwritten the Hudibras of the Civil War.  What struck this writer most was\r\nthe fact that I had opened a _new_ field of humour.  And here he was\r\nquite right.  With the exception of Dan Rice's circus song of \"Der goot\r\noldt Sherman shentleman,\" and a rather flat parody of \"Jessie, the Flower\r\nof Dumblane,\" I had never seen or heard of any specimen of Anglo-German\r\npoetry.  To be _merely original_ in language is not to excel in\r\neverything--a fact very generally ignored--else my Pidgin-English ballads\r\nwould take precedence of Tennyson's poems!  On the other hand, very great\r\npoets have often not made a new _form_.  The Yankee type, both as regards\r\nspirit and language, had become completely common and familiar in prose\r\nand poetry, before Lowell revived it in the clever _Biglow Papers_.  Bret\r\nHarte's \"Heathen Chinee,\" and several other poems, are, however, _both_\r\noriginal and admirable.  Whatever the merits or demerits of mine were--and\r\nit was years ere I ever gave them a thought--the public, which is always\r\neager for something new, took to them at once.\r\n\r\nI say that for years I never gave them a thought.  All of the principal\r\npoems except the \"Barty\" and \"Breitmann as a Politician,\" were merely\r\nwritten to fill up letters to C. A. Bristed, of New York, and I kept no\r\ncopies of them--in fact, utterly _forgot_ them.  _Weingeist_ was first\r\nwritten in a letter to a sister of Captain Colton, with the remark that\r\nit was easier to write such a ballad than any prose.  But Bristed\r\npublished them _a mon insu_ in a sporting paper.  Years after I learned\r\nthat I published one called \"Breitmann's Sermon\" in _Leslie's Magazine_.\r\nThis I have never recovered.  If I write so much about these poems now, I\r\ncertainly was not vain of them when written.  The public found them out\r\nlong before I did, and it is not very often that it gets ahead of a poet\r\nin appreciating his own works.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was \"awful busy\" in those days.  I had hardly begun on the\r\n_Press_ ere I found that it had a weekly paper, made up from the daily\r\ntype transferred, which only just paid its expenses.  Secondly, I\r\ndiscovered that there was not a soul on the staff except myself who had\r\nhad any experience of weekly full editing.  I at once made out a\r\nschedule, showing that by collecting and grouping agricultural and\r\nindustrial items, putting in two or three columns of original matter, and\r\nbringing in a story to go through the daily first, the weekly could be\r\nvastly improved at very little expense.\r\n\r\nColonel Forney admired the scheme, but asked \"who was to carry it out.\"  I\r\nreplied that I would.  He remonstrated, very kindly, urging that I had\r\nall I could do as it was.  I answered, \"Colonel Forney, this is not a\r\nmatter of time, but _method_.  There is always time for the man who knows\r\nhow to lay it out.\"  So I got up a very nice paper.  But for a very long\r\ntime I could not get an agent to solicit advertisements who knew the\r\nbusiness.  The weekly paid its expenses and nothing more.  But one day\r\nthere came to me a young man named M. T. Wolf.  He was of Pennsylvania\r\nGerman stock.  He had lost a small fortune in the patent medicine\r\nbusiness and wanted employment badly.  I suggested that, until something\r\nelse could be found, he should try his hand at collecting \"advers.\"\r\n\r\nNow, be it observed, as Mozart was born to music, and some men have a\r\npowerful instinct to study medicine, and others are so unnatural as to\r\ntake to mathematics, Wolf had a grand undeveloped genius beyond all\r\nbelief for collecting advertisements.  He had tried many pursuits and\r\nfailed, but the first week he went into this business he brought in $200\r\n(40 pounds), which gave him forty dollars, and he never afterwards fell\r\nbelow it, but often rose above.  \"Advers.\" for him meant not adversity.\r\nIt was very characteristic of Colonel Forney, who was too much absorbed\r\nin politics to attend much to business, that long after the _Weekly\r\nPress_ was yielding him $10,000 a year _clear profit_, he said to me one\r\nday, \"Mr. Leland, you must not be discouraged as to the weekly; the\r\nclerks tell me in the office that it _meets its expenses_!\"\r\n\r\nThere was abundance of life and incident on the newspaper in those days,\r\nespecially during election times in the autumn.  I have known fights,\r\nnight after night, to be going on in the street below, at the corner of\r\nSeventh and Chestnut, between Republicans and Democrats, with revolver\r\nshots and flashes at the rate of fifty to a second, when I was literally\r\nso occupied with pressing telegrams that I could not look out to see the\r\nfun.  One night, however, when there were death-shots falling thick and\r\nfast, I saw a young man make a most _incredible_ leap.  He had received a\r\nbullet under the shoulder, and when a man or a deer is hit there he\r\nalways leaps.  I heard afterwards that he recovered, though this is a\r\nvital place.\r\n\r\nIt happened once that for a week the Republicans were kept from resisting\r\nor retaliating by their leaders, until the Democrats began to disgrace\r\nthemselves by excesses.  Then all at once the Republicans boiled over,\r\nthrashed their foes, and attacking the Copperhead clubs, threw their\r\nfurniture out of the window, and--inadvertently perhaps--also a few\r\nCopperheads.  Just before they let their angry passions rise in this\r\nfashion there came one night a delegation to serenade Colonel Forney at\r\nthe office.  The Colonel was grand on such occasions.  He was a fine,\r\ntall, portly man, with a lion-like mien and a powerful voice.  He began--\r\n\r\n\"My friends, fellow-citizens and Republicans, you have this week acted\r\nnobly.\"\r\n\r\nCries from the crowd, \"_We hev_! _we hev_!\"\r\n\r\n\"You, when smitten on the right cheek, turned unto the oppressor the\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\n\"We did! we _did_!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are beyond all question models--I may say with truth, paragons of\r\npatience, long-suffering, and humility.  You are--Christian gentlemen!\"\r\n\"We air! we _air_!\"\r\n\r\nWhile this was passing, a great gloomy thundercloud of the Democratic\r\nenemy gathered on the opposite sidewalk, and as the Colonel lifted his\r\nvoice again, there came a cry--\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, you d---d old Republican dead-duck!\"\r\n\r\nThat word was a spell to raise the devil withal.  Bang! bang! bang! went\r\nthe revolvers of the Union men in a volley, and the Democrats fled for\r\ntheir lives down Seventh Street, pursued by the meek, lowly, and long-\r\nsuffering Christians--like rabbits before wolves.\r\n\r\nThe enemy at last resolved to attack the _Press_ and burn the building.\r\nThen we had one hundred and fifty policemen sent to garrison and guard.\r\nThere was a surging, howling mob outside, and much guerilla-shooting, but\r\nall I can remember is my vexation at having so much to disturb me in\r\nmaking up the paper.\r\n\r\nI never went armed in my life when I could help it, for I hate\r\n_impedimenta_ in my pockets.  All of us in the office hung up our coats\r\nin a dark place outside.  Whenever I sent an assistant to get some papers\r\nfrom mine, he said that he always knew my coat because there was no\r\npistol in it.\r\n\r\nScenes such as these, and quite as amusing, were of constant occurrence\r\nin those days in Philadelphia.  \"All night long in that sweet little\r\nvillage was heard the soft note of the pistol and the dying scream of the\r\nvictim.\"  Now, be it noted, that a stuffed dead duck had become the\r\n_gonfalon_ or banner of the Republicans, and where it swung there the\r\nbattle was fiercest.  There was a young fellow from South Carolina, who\r\nhad become a zealous Union man, and who made up for a sinful lack of\r\nsense by a stupendous stock of courage.  One morning there came into the\r\noffice an object--and such an object!  His face was all swathed and\r\nhidden in bloody bandages; he was tattered, and limped, and had his arm\r\nin a sling.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven, who and what are you?\" I exclaimed.  \"And who has\r\nbeen passing you through a bark-mill that you look so ground-up?\"\r\n\r\nIn a sepulchral voice he replied, \"I'm ---, and last night _I carried the\r\ndead duck_!\"\r\n\r\nTill I came on the _Press_ there was, it may be said, almost no community\r\nbetween the Germans of North Philadelphia and the Americans in our line.\r\nBut I had become intimate with Von Tronk, a Hanoverian of good family, a\r\nlawyer, and editor, I believe, of the _Freie Presse_.  I even went once\r\nor twice to speak at German meetings.  In fact, I was getting to be\r\nconsidered \"almost as all de same so goot ash Deutsch,\" and very\r\n\"bopular.\"  One day Von Tronk came with a request.  There was to be an\r\nimmense German Republican _Massenversammlung_ or mass-meeting in a great\r\nbeer-garden.  \"If Colonel Forney could only be induced to address them!\"\r\nI undertook to do it.  It was an entirely new field to him, but one\r\nwondrous rich in votes.  Now Colonel Forney, though from Lancaster County\r\nand of German-Swiss extraction, knew not a word of the language, and I\r\nundertook to coach him.\r\n\r\n\"You will only need one phrase of three words,\" I said, \"to pull you\r\nthrough; but you must pronounce them perfectly and easily.  They are\r\n_Freiheit und Gleichheit_, 'freedom and equality.'  Now, if you _please_,\r\n_fry-height_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel went at his lesson, and being naturally clever, with a fine,\r\ndeep voice, in a quarter of an hour could roar out _Freiheit und\r\nGleichheit_ with an intonation which would have raised a revolution in\r\nBerlin.  We came to the garden, and there was an immense sensation.  The\r\nColonel had winning manners, with a manly mien, and he was duly\r\nintroduced.  When he rose to speak there was dead silence.  He began--\r\n\r\n\"Friends and German Fellow-citizens:--Yet why should I distinguish the\r\nwords, since to me every German is a friend.  I am myself, as you all\r\nknow, of unmingled German extraction, and I am very, very proud of it.\r\nBut there is one German sentiment which from a child has been ever in my\r\nheart, and from infancy ever on my lips, and that sentiment, my friends,\r\nis _Freiheit und Gleichheit_!\"\r\n\r\nIf ever audience was astonished in this world it was that of the\r\n_Massenversammlung_ when this burst on their ears.  They hurrahed and\r\nroared and banged the tables in such a mad storm of delight as even\r\nColonel Forney had never seen surpassed.  Rising to the occasion, he\r\nthundered on, and as he reached the end of every sentence he repeated,\r\nwith great skill and aptness, _Freiheit und Gleichheit_.\r\n\r\n\"You have made two thousand votes by that speech, Colonel,\" I said, as we\r\nreturned.  \"Von Tronk will manage it at this crisis.\"  After that, when\r\nthe Colonel jested, he would called me \"the Dutch vote-maker.\"  This was\r\nduring the Grant campaign.\r\n\r\nDroll incidents were of constant occurrence in this life.  Out of a\r\nmyriad I will note a few.  One day there came into our office an Indian\r\nagent from the West, who had brought with him a Winnebago who claimed to\r\nbe the rightful chief of his tribe.  They were going to Washington to\r\nenforce the claim.  While the agent conversed with some one the Indian\r\nwas turned over to me.  He was a magnificent specimen, six feet high,\r\nclad in a long trailing scarlet blanket, with a scarlet straight feather\r\nin his hair which continued him up _ad infinitum_, and he was straight as\r\na lightning rod.  He was handsome, and very dignified and grave; but I\r\nunderstood _that_.  I can come it indifferent well myself when I am \"out\r\nof my plate,\" as the French, say, in strange society.  He spoke no\r\nEnglish, but, as the agent said, knew six Indian languages.  He was\r\nevidently a chief by blood, \"all the way down to his moccasins.\"\r\n\r\nWhat with a few words of Kaw (I had learned about a hundred words of it\r\nwith great labour) and a few other phrases of other tongues, I succeeded\r\nin interesting him.  But I could not make him smile, and I swore unto\r\nmyself that I would.\r\n\r\nBeing thirsty, the Indian, seeing a cooler of ice-water, with the daring\r\npeculiar to a great brave, went and took a glass and turned on the\r\n_spicket_.  He filled his glass--it was brim-full--but he did not know\r\nhow to _turn it off_.  Then I had him.  As it ran over he turned to me an\r\nappealing helpless glance.  I said \"_Neosho_.\"  This in Pottawattamie\r\nmeans an inundation or overflowing of the banks, and is generally applied\r\nto the inundation of the Mississippi.  There is a town on the latter so\r\ncalled.  This was too much for the Indian, and he laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Great God! what have you been saying to that Indian?\" cried the agent,\r\namazed.  \"It is the first time he has laughed since he left home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a little pun in Pottawattamie.  But I really know very little of\r\nthe language.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no knowledge of the Indian languages,\" remarked our city editor,\r\nMacGinnis, a genial young Irishman, \"least of all, thank God! of\r\nPottawattamie.  But I have always understood that when a man gets so far\r\nin a tongue as to make _puns_ in it, it is time for him to stop.\"\r\n\r\nYears after this I was one evening in London at an opening of an\r\nexhibition of pictures.  There were present Indian Hindoo princes in\r\ngorgeous array, English nobility, literary men, and fine ladies.  Among\r\nthem was an unmistakable Chippeway in a white Canadian blanket-coat,\r\nevery inch an Indian.  I began with the usual greeting, \"_Ho nitchi_!\"\r\n(Ho, brother!), to which he gravely replied.  I tried two or three\r\nphrases on him with the same effect.  Then I played a sure card.  Sinking\r\nmy voice with an inviting wink, I uttered \"_Shingawauba_,\" or whisky.\r\n\"Dot fetched him.\"  He too laughed.  _Gleich mit gleich_, _gesellt sich\r\ngern_.\r\n\r\nWhile living in New York, and during my connection with the _Press_, I\r\noften met and sometimes conversed with Horace Greeley.  Once I went with\r\nhim from Philadelphia to New York, and he was in the car the observed of\r\nall observers to an extraordinary degree.  He sat down, took out an\r\nimmense roll of proof, and said, \"_Lead pencil_!\"  One was immediately\r\nhanded to him by some stranger, who was by that one act ennobled, or,\r\nwhat amounts to the same thing in America, grotesquely _charactered_ for\r\nlife.  He was the man who gave Horace Greeley a lead pencil!  I, as his\r\ncompanion, was also regarded as above ordinary humanity.  When the proof\r\nwas finished \"Horace\" said to me--\r\n\r\n\"How is John Forney getting on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Satan, walking to and fro upon the face of the earth, going from\r\nthe _Chronicle_ in Washington one day to the _Press_ in Philadelphia on\r\nthe next, and filling them both cram full of leaders and letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two papers, both daily!  I tell Forney that I find it is all I can do to\r\nattend to one.  Tell him not to get too rich--bad for the constitution\r\nand worse for the country.  Any man who has more than a million is a\r\npublic nuisance.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, we walked together from the ferry to the corner of Park Place\r\nand Broadway, and the philosopher, after minutely explaining to me which\r\nomnibus I was to take, bade me adieu.  I do not think we ever met again.\r\n\r\nIn the summer Colonel Forney went to Europe with John the junior.  When\r\nhe left he said, \"I do not expect you to raise the circulation of the\r\n_Press_, but I hope that you will be able to keep it from falling in the\r\ndead season.\"  I went to work, and what with enlarging the telegraphic\r\nnews, and correspondence, and full reports of conventions, I materially\r\nincreased the sale.  It cost a great deal of money, to be sure, but the\r\nColonel did not mind that.  At this time there came into our office as\r\nassociate with me Captain W. W. Nevin.  He had been all through the war.\r\nI took a great liking to him, and we always remained intimate friends.\r\nAll in our office except myself were from Lancaster County, the\r\nbirthplace, I believe, of Fitch and Fulton.  It is a Pennsylvania German\r\ncounty, and as I notoriously spoke German openly without shame ours was\r\ncalled a Dutch office.  Once when Colonel Forney wrote a letter from\r\nHolland describing the windmills, the _Sunday Transcript_ unkindly\r\nremarked that \"he had better come home and look after his own Dutch\r\nwindmill at the corner of Seventh and Chestnut Streets.\"\r\n\r\nI had at this time a great deal to do with the operas and theatres, and\r\noften wrote the reviews.  After a while, as Captain Nevin relieved me of\r\na great deal of work, and I had an able assistant named Norcross, I\r\ndevoted myself chiefly to dramatic criticism and the weekly, and such\r\nwork as suited me best.  As for the dignity of managership, Captain Nevin\r\nand I tossed it from one to the other like a hot potato in jest, but\r\nbetween us we ran the paper very well.  There was an opera impresario\r\nnamed Maurice Strakosch, of whom I had heard that he was hard to deal\r\nwith and irritable.  I forget now who the prima donna in his charge was,\r\nbut there had appeared in our paper a criticism which might be\r\ninterpreted in some detail unfavourably by a captious critic.  One\r\nafternoon there came into the office, where I was alone, a gentlemanly-\r\nseeming man, who began to manifest anger in regard to the criticism in\r\nquestion.  I replied, \"I do not know, sir, what your position in the\r\nopera troupe may be, but if it be anything which requires a knowledge of\r\nEnglish, I am afraid that you are misplaced.  There was no intention to\r\noffend in the remarks, and so far as the lady is concerned I shall only\r\nbe too glad to say the very best I can of her.  _Comprenez_, _monsieur_,\r\n_c'est une bagatelle_.\"  He laughed, and we spoke French, then Italian,\r\nthen German, and of Patti and Sontag and Lind.  Then I asked him what he\r\nreally was, and he replied, \"I do not believe that you even know the name\r\nof my native tongue.  It is Czech.\"  I stared at him amazed, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Veliky Bog!  Rozprava pochesky?  Nekrasneya rejece est.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian gentleman drew a handsomely bound book from his pocket.\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"this is my album.  It is full of signatures of great\r\nartists, even of kings and queens and poets.  There is not a name in it\r\nwhich is not that of a distinguished person, and I do not know what your\r\nname is, but I beg that you will write it in my book.\"\r\n\r\nNearly the same scene was repeated soon after, with the same words, when\r\nthe great actress Fanny Janauschek came to Philadelphia.  At that time\r\nshe played only in German.  Her manager, Grau, introduced me to her, and\r\nshe complimented me on my German, and praised the language as the finest\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"it _is_ certainly very fine.  But I know a finer,\r\nwhich goes more nearly to the heart, and with which I can move you more\r\ndeeply.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\" cried the great artist astonished.\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" I replied, in her native tongue, \"_Bohemian_.  That is the\r\nlanguage for me.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Janauschek was so affected that she burst out crying, though she\r\nwas a woman of tremendous nerve.  We became great friends, and often met\r\nagain in after years in England.\r\n\r\nI have seen Ristori play for thirty nights in succession, {346} and\r\nRachel and Sarah Bernhardt; but as regards true genius, Janauschek in her\r\nearlier days was incomparably their superior; for these all played from\r\nnerves and instinct, but Janauschek from her brain and intellect.  I\r\noften wondered that she did not write plays.  It is said of Rachel that\r\nthere was once a five-act play in which she died at the end of the fourth\r\nact.  After it had had a long run she casually asked some one _how it\r\nended_.  She had never read the fifth act.  Such a story could never have\r\nbeen told of Janauschek.\r\n\r\nIn the summer there were one or two railroad excursions to visit new\r\nbranch roads in Pennsylvania.  While on one of these I visited the\r\ncelebrated Mauch Chunk coal mines, and rode on the switchback railway,\r\nwhere I had a fearfully narrow escape from death.  This switchback is a\r\n_montagne Russe_ coming up and down a hill, and six miles in length.  Yet,\r\nthough the rate of speed is appalling, the engineer can stop the car in a\r\nfew seconds' time with the powerful brake.  We were going down headlong,\r\nwhen all at once a cow stepped out of the bushes on the road before us,\r\nand if we had struck her we must have gone headlong over the cliff and\r\nbeen killed.  But by a miracle the engineer stopped the car just as we\r\ngot to the cow.  We were saved by a second.  Something very like it had\r\noccurred to my wife and to me in 1859.  We were going to Reading by rail,\r\nwhen the train ran off the track and went straight for an embankment\r\nwhere there was a fall of 150 feet.  It was stopped just as the\r\nlocomotive protruded or looked over the precipice.  Had there been the\r\n_least trifle_ more of steam on at that instant we must all have\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nIn November of this my second year on the _Press_ my father died.  One\r\nthing occurred on this sad bereavement which alleviated it a little.  I\r\nhad always felt all my life that he had never been satisfied with my want\r\nof a fixed career or position.  He did not, I think, _very_ much like\r\nJohn Forney, the audacious, reckless politician, but he still respected\r\nhis power and success, and it astonished him a little, and many others\r\nquite as much, to find that I was in many respects Forney's right-hand\r\nman, and manager of a bold political paper which had a great influence.  A\r\nday or two before he died my father expressed himself kindly to the\r\neffect that I had at last done well, and that he was satisfied with me.\r\nAt last, after so many years, he felt that I had _etat_--a calling, a\r\ndefinite position.  In fact, in those days it was often said that Forney\r\ncould make himself President, as he indeed might have done but for\r\ncertain errors, no greater than have been committed by more successful\r\nmen, and a stroke of ill-luck such as few can resist.\r\n\r\nThe winter passed quietly.  I was extremely fond of my life and work.\r\nSummer came, and with it a great desire for a change and wild life and\r\nthe West, for I had worked very hard.  A very great railway excursion,\r\nwhich was destined to have a great effect, was being organised, and both\r\nmy wife and I were invited to join it.  Mr. John Edgar Thompson, the\r\npresident of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Mr. Hinckley, of the Baltimore\r\nroad, President Felton, Professor Leidy, Robert Lamborn, and a number of\r\nother notables, were to go to Duluth, on Lake Superior, and decide on the\r\nterminus of the railroad as a site for a city.  Mrs. John E. Thompson had\r\nher own private car, which was seventy feet in length, and fitted up with\r\nevery convenience and luxury.  To this was added the same directors' car\r\nin which I had travelled to Minnesota.  There were to be in all ten or\r\ntwelve gentlemen and ten ladies.  There was such efficient service that\r\none young man, a clerk, was detailed especially to look after our\r\nluggage.  As we stopped every night at some hotel, he would inquire what\r\nwe required to be taken to our rooms, and saw that it was brought back in\r\nthe morning.  I went off in such a hurry that I forgot my Indian blanket,\r\nnor had I any revolver or gun, all of which, especially the blanket, I\r\nsadly missed ere I returned.  I got, before I left, a full white flannel\r\nor fine white cloth suit, which was then a startling novelty, and wore it\r\nto the Falls of the Mississippi.  Little did I foresee that ere it gave\r\nout I should also have it on at the Cataracts of the Nile!\r\n\r\nSo we started and after a few hours' travel, stopped at Altona.  There I\r\nwas very much amused by an old darkey at the railway-station hotel, who\r\nhad, as he declared, \"specially the kyar of de ladies an' quality.\"  He\r\nhad been a slave till the war broke out, and had been wondrously favoured\r\nby visions and revelations which guided him to freedom.  \"De Lawd he\r\n'pear to me in a dream, an' I hyar a vi'ce which cry, 'Simon, arise an'\r\ngit out of dis, an' put fo' de Norf as fass as you kin travel, fo' de day\r\nof de 'pressor is at an end, an' you is to be free.'  So I rosed an'\r\nfled, hardly a-waitin' to stuff my bag wid some corn-dodgers an' bacon,\r\nan' foller de Norf Star till I git confused an' went to sleep agin, wen,\r\nlo, an angel expostulated hisself befo' my eyes in a wision, an' say,\r\n'Simon, beholdes' dou dat paff by de riber?  Dat's de one fo' you to\r\nfoller, ole son!'  So I follers it till I git on de right trail.  Den I\r\nmet anoder nigger a-'scapin' from the bon's of captivity, an' carryin' a\r\ncold ham, an' I jined in wid him--you bet--an' so we come to de Lawd's\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so gaily on to Chicago.  We went directly to the first hotel, and as\r\nsoon as I had toiletted and gone below, I saw on the opposite building a\r\nsign with the words _Chicago Tribune_.  This was an exchange of ours, so\r\nI crossed over, and meeting the editor by chance in the doorway, was\r\nwelcomed and introduced to Governor Desbrosses, who stood by.  Then I\r\nwent to a telegraph office and sent a despatch to the _Press_.  The man\r\nwanted me to pay.  I told him to C. O. D., \"collect on delivery.\"  He\r\ndeclined.  I said, \"Your principal office is in Philadelphia, is it\r\nnot?--Third and Chestnut Streets.  Just send a telegram and ask the name\r\nof your landlord.  It's Leland, and _I'm the man_.  If you make me pay,\r\nI'll raise your rent.\"  He laughed heartily and let me off, but not\r\nwithout a parting shot: \"You see, Mr. Leland, there are so many\r\nscallawags {349} from the East come here, that we are obliged to be a\r\nlittle particular.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to the hotel, and was immediately introduced to some one\r\nhaving authority.  I narrated my late experience.  He looked at me and\r\nsaid, \"How long have you been in Chicago?\"  I replied, \"About thirty\r\nminutes.\"  He answered gravely, \"I think you'd better _stay_ here.  You'll\r\nsuit the place.\"  I was beginning to feel the moral influence of the\r\ngenial air of the West.  Chicago is emphatically what is termed \"a\r\nplace,\" and a certain amount of calm confidence in one's self is not in\r\nthat city to any one's discredit.  Once there was an old lady of a \"hard\"\r\ntype in the witness-box in an American city.  She glared round at the\r\njudge, the jury, and the spectators, and then burst out with, \"You\r\nneedn't all be staring at me in that way.  I don't keer a --- for you\r\nall.  I've lived eleven years in Chicago, and ain't affeard of the\r\ndevil.\"  Chicago is said in Indian to mean the place of skunks, but\r\ncalling a rose a skunk-cabbage don't make it one.\r\n\r\nWalking on the edge of the lake near the city, the waters cast up a good-\r\nsized living specimen of that extraordinary fish-lizard, the great\r\n_menobranchus_, popularly known as the hell-bender from its extreme\r\nugliness.  Owing to the immense size of its spermatozoa, it has rendered\r\ngreat aid to embryology, a science which, when understood _au fond_, will\r\nbring about great changes in the human race.  We were taken out in a\r\nsteamboat to the end of the great aqueduct, which was, when built,\r\npronounced, I think by the London _Times_, to be the greatest engineering\r\nwork of modern times.\r\n\r\nIn due time we came to St. Paul, Minnesota.  We went to a very fair hotel\r\nand had a very good dinner.  In the West it is very common among the\r\ncommonalty to drink coffee and milk through dinner, and indeed with all\r\nmeals, instead of wine or ale, but the custom is considered as vulgar by\r\nswells.  Having finished dessert, I asked the Irish waiter to bring me a\r\nsmall cup of black coffee and brandy.  Drawing himself up stiffly, Pat\r\nreplied, \"We don't serve caafy at dinner in _this_ hotel.\"  There was a\r\ngrand roar of laughter which the waiter evidently thought was at _my_\r\nexpense, as he retreated smiling.\r\n\r\nWe were kindly received in St. Paul by everybody.  There is this immense\r\nadvantage of English or American hospitality over that of all other\r\ncountries, that it introduces us to the _home_, and makes us forget that\r\nwe are strangers.  When we were at the end of the fearfully wearisome\r\ngreat moral circus known as the Oriental Congress, held all over\r\nScandinavia in 1890, there came to me one evening in the station a great\r\nNorseman with his friends.  With much would-be, ox-like dignity he began,\r\n\"You ha-ave now experienced de glorious haspitality off our country.  You\r\nwill go oom and say--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop a minute there!\" I exclaimed, for I was bored to death with a show\r\nwhich had been engineered to tatters, and to half defeating all the work\r\nof the Congress, in order to glorify the King and Count Landberg.  \"I\r\nhave been here in your country six weeks, and I had letters of\r\nintroduction, and have made no end of acquaintances.  I have been shown\r\nthousands of fireworks, which blind me, and offered dozens of champagne,\r\nwhich I never touch, and public dinners, which I did not attend.  But\r\nduring the whole time I have never once seen the inside of a Swedish or\r\nNorwegian house.\"  Which was perfectly true, nor have I ever seen one to\r\nthis day.  There is a kind of \"hospitality\" which consists of giving\r\nyourself a grand treat at a tavern or _cafe_, and inviting your strangers\r\nto it to help you to be glorified.  But to very domestic people and utter\r\nPhilistines, _domestic_ life lacks the charm of a brass band, and the\r\nmirrors and gilding of a restaurant or hotel; therefore, what they\r\nthemselves enjoy most, they, with best intent, but most unwisely, inflict\r\non more civilised folk.  But in America and England, where home-life is\r\n_worth_ living and abounding in every attraction, and public saloons are\r\nat a discount, the case is reversed.  And in these Western towns, of\r\nwhich many were, so to speak, almost within hearing of the whoop of the\r\nsavage or the howl of the wolf (as Leavenworth really was), we\r\nexperienced a refinement of true hospitality in homes--kindness and tact\r\nsuch as I have never known to be equalled save in Great Britain.  One\r\nevening I was at a house in St. Paul, where I was struck by the beauty,\r\nrefined manners, and agreeableness of our hostess, who was a real\r\nChippeway or Sioux Indian, and wife of a retired Indian trader.  She had\r\nbeen well educated at a Canadian French seminary.\r\n\r\nWe were taken over to see the rival city of Minneapolis, of which word my\r\nbrother Henry said it was a vile grinding up together of Greek and\r\nIndian.  _Minne_ means water; _Minne-sota_, turbid water, and\r\n_Minne-haha_ does not signify \"laughing,\" but _falling_ water.  This we\r\nalso visited, and I found it so charming, that I was delighted to think\r\nthat for once an Indian name had been kept, and that the young ladies of\r\nthe boarding-schools of St. Paul or Minneapolis had not christened or\r\ndevilled it \"Diana's Bath.\"\r\n\r\nWe were received kindly by the Council of the city of Minneapolis.  Half\r\nof them had come from the East afflicted with consumption, and all had\r\nrecovered.  But it is necessary to remain there to live.  My wife's\r\ncousin, Mr. Richard Price, who then owned the great saw-mill next the\r\nFall of St. Anthony, came with this affliction from Philadelphia, and got\r\nover it.  After six years' absence he returned to Philadelphia, and died\r\nin six weeks of consumption.  Strangely enough, consumption is the chief\r\ncause of death among the Indians, but this is due to their careless\r\nhabits, wearing wet moccasins and the like.\r\n\r\nNow a great question arose.  It was necessary for the magnates of our\r\nparty to go to Duluth, and to do this they must make a seven days'\r\njourney through the wilderness, either on a very rough military road cut\r\nthrough the woods during the war, or sometimes on no road at all.  Houses\r\nor post-stations, often of only one or two rooms, were sometimes a day's\r\njourney apart.  The question was whether delicate ladies, utterly\r\nunaccustomed to anything like hard travel could take this trip, during\r\nwhich they must endure clouds of mosquitos, put up with camp-cooking, or\r\noften none, and otherwise go through privations such as only an Indian or\r\na frontiersman would care to experience?  The entire town of St. Paul,\r\nand all the men of our party, vigorously opposed taking the ladies, while\r\nI, joining the latter, insisted on it that they could go; for, as I said\r\nto all assembled, where the devil is afraid to go he sends a woman; and I\r\nhad always observed that in travelling, long after men are tired out\r\nwomen are generally all right.  They are never more played out _than they\r\nwant to be_.\r\n\r\n   \"Femme plaint, femme deult,\r\n   Femme est malade quand elle veult,\r\n   Et par Sainte Marie!\r\n   Quand elle veult elle est guerye.\"\r\n\r\nAnd of course _we_ carried the day.  Twelve men, even though backed up by\r\na city council, have no chance against any ten women.  To be sure women,\r\nlike all other savages, require a male leader--I mean to say, just as\r\nGoorkha troops, though brave as lions, must have an English captain--so\r\nthey conquered under my guidance!\r\n\r\nHaving had experience in fitting out for the wilderness, I was requested\r\nto see to the stores--so many hams to so many people for so many days, so\r\nmuch coffee, and so forth.  I astonished all by insisting that there\r\nshould be one _tin cup_ to every traveller.  \"Every glass you have will\r\nsoon be broken,\" I said.  And so it was, sooner than I expected.  As tin\r\ncups could not be found in St. Paul, we bought three or four dozen small\r\ntin basins of about six inches diameter at the rim, and when champagne\r\nwas served out it was, _faute de mieux_, drunk from these eccentric\r\ngoblets.\r\n\r\nIn the first waggon were Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Leland.  Their\r\ndriver was a very eccentric Canadian Frenchman named Louis.  He was to\r\nthe last degree polite to the ladies, but subject to attacks of Indian\r\nrage at mere trifles, when he would go aside, swear, and destroy\r\nsomething like a lunatic in a fury, and then return quite happy and\r\nserene.  I was in the second waggon with three ladies, a man being wanted\r\nin every vehicle.  Our driver was named George, and he was altogether\r\nlike Brigham, minus the Mexican-Spanish element.  George had, however,\r\nalso lived a great deal among Indians, and been at the great battle of\r\nthe Chippeways and Sioux, and was full of interesting and naive\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\nOf course, we of the two leading waggons all talked to Louis in French,\r\nwho gave himself great airs on it.  One morning George asked me in\r\nconfidence, \"Mr. Leland, you're not all French, are you?\"  \"Certainly\r\nnot,\" I replied; \"we're from Philadelphia.\"  \"Well,\" replied George, \"so\r\nI told Louis, but he says you _are_ French, like him, and shut me up by\r\naskin' me if I hadn't heard you talkin' it.  Now what I want to know is,\r\nif you're _not_ French, how came the _whole_ of you to know it?\"  I\r\nexplained to George, to his astonishment, that in the East it was usual\r\nfor all well-educated persons, especially ladies, to learn it.  I soon\r\nbecame as intimate with George as I had been with Brigham, and began to\r\nlearn Chippeway of him, and greet the Indians whom we met.  One day\r\nGeorge said--\r\n\r\n\"Of course you have no Indian blood in you, Mr. Leland; but weren't you a\r\ngreat deal among 'em when you were young?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you've got queer little old Injun ways.  Whenever you stop by\r\nthe roadside to talk to anybody and sit down, you always rake the small\r\nbits of wood together and pull out a match and make a _smudge_\" (a very\r\nsmoky fire made by casting dust on it), \"just like an Indian in an Injun\r\nkind of way.\"  (In after years I found this same habit of making fires of\r\nsmall bits of wood peculiar to old English gypsies.)\r\n\r\nThe smudge is the great summer institution of Minnesota.  It is the\r\nsafeguard against mosquitos.  They are all over the State in such numbers\r\nthat they constitute a plague.  We all wore all the time over our faces\r\nand necks a kind of guard or veil, shaped exactly like an Egyptian\r\n_fanous_ or folding lantern.  It is cylindrical, made of _tulle_ or\r\ncoarse lace, with rings.  At every house people sat in the porticos over\r\na tin bucket, in which there was a smudge--that is to say, in smoke.  In\r\nthe evening some one goes with a tin or iron pail containing a smudge,\r\nand fills the bedrooms with dense smoke.  One evening Mr. Hinckley and\r\nanother of our party went fishing without veils.  They returned with\r\ntheir necks behind swollen up as if with _goitres_ or _Kropfe_.  I knew a\r\nyoung Englishman who with friends, somewhere beyond Manitoba, encountered\r\nsuch a storm of mosquitos that their oxen were killed, and the party\r\nsaved themselves by riding away on horseback.  So he told me.\r\n\r\nAt the stations--all log-houses--the ladies collected pillows and buffalo\r\nblankets, and, making a great bed, all slept in one room.  We men slept\r\nin waggons or under a tent, which was not quite large enough for all.  The\r\nIndian women cut spruce twigs and laid them over-lapping on the ground\r\nfor our bed.  By preference I took the outside, _al fresco_.  One night\r\nwe stayed at a house which had an upper and a lower storey.  The ladies\r\ncamped upstairs.  In the morning, when we men below awoke, all took a\r\ndrink of whisky.  There entered a very tall Indian, clad in a long black\r\nblanket, who looked on very approvingly at the drinking.  I called to my\r\nwife above to hand me down my whisky flask.  \"There is a big Indian here\r\nwho wants a drink,\" I remarked.  \"I think I know,\" she replied, \"who that\r\nbig Indian is,\" but handed down the flask.  \"Don't waste whisky on an\r\n_Indian_\" said one of my companions.  But I filled the cup with a\r\ntremendous slug, and handed it to the Objibway.  He took it down like\r\nmilk, and never a word spoke he, but when it was swallowed he looked at\r\nme and winked.  Such a wink as that was!  I think I see it now--so\r\ninspired with gratitude and humour as to render all words needless.  He\r\nhad a rare sense of tact and gratitude.  Soon after I was sitting out of\r\ndoors among a few ladies, when the Indian, who had divined that I was\r\nshort of Chippeway and wished to learn, stalked up, and pointing to our\r\nbeauty, said gravely, _squoah_--_i.e._, woman.  Then he indicated several\r\nother articles, told me the Indian name for each and walked away.  It was\r\nall he could do.  The ladies, who could not imagine why this voluntary\r\nlesson was given to me, were much amused at it.  But I understood it; he\r\nhad seen the Injun in me at a glance, and knew what I wanted most!\r\n\r\nOne night we stopped at a place called Kettle River.  It was very\r\npicturesque.  Over the rushing stream the high rocky banks actually\r\noverhung the water.  I got into a birch canoe with my wife, and two\r\nIndian boys paddled us, while others made a great fire on the cliff\r\nabove, which illuminated the scene.  Other Indian youths jumped into the\r\nwater and swam about and skylarked, whooping wildly.  It reminded me\r\nstrangely of the Blue Grotto of Capri, where our boatmen jumped in and\r\nswam in a sulphur-azure glow, only that this was red in the firelight.\r\n\r\nOur whisky ran short--it always does on all such excursions--and our\r\ndrivers in consequence became very \"short\" also, or rather unruly.  But\r\n_bon chemin_, _mal chemin_, we went on, and the ladies, as I had\r\npredicted, pulled through merrily.\r\n\r\nOne day, at a halt, I found, with the ladies, in the woods by a stream, a\r\npretty sight.  It was a wigwam, which was very open, and which had been\r\nmade to look like a bower with green boughs.  When I was in the artillery\r\nI was the only person who ever thus adorned our tent in Indian style.  It\r\nis very pleasant on a warm day, and looks artistic.  In the wigwam sat a\r\npretty Indian woman with a babe.  The ladies were, of course, at once\r\ndeeply interested, but the Indian could not speak English.  One of the\r\nladies had a common Japanese fan, with the picture of a grotesque god,\r\nand I at once saw my way to interest our hostess.\r\n\r\nI once read in the journal of a missionary's wife in Canada that she had\r\na curious Malay or Cingalese dagger, with a curved blade and wooden\r\nsheath, while on the handle was the figure of an idol.  One day she\r\nshowed this to an Indian, and the next day he came with five more, and\r\nthese again with fifteen, till it seemed as if the whole country had gone\r\nwild over it.  Very much alarmed at such heathenism, the lady locked it\r\nup and would show it no more.  Ere she did so, she asked an old Indian\r\nhow it was possible to make a scabbard of one piece of wood, with a hole\r\nin it to fit the blade.  This man, who had been one of the most devoted\r\nadmirers of the deity on the handle, saw no puzzle in this.  He explained\r\nthat the hole was burned in by heating the blade.\r\n\r\nI showed the god on the fan to the Indian woman, and said,\r\n\"_Manitu_--_ktchee manitu_\" (\"a god--a great god\").  She saw at once that\r\nit was heathen, and her heart went out unto it with great delight.  With\r\na very few Chippeway words and many signs I explained to her that forty\r\ndays' journey from us was the sea, and forty days beyond another country\r\nwhere the people had this _manitou_.  I believe that the lady gave her\r\nthe fan, and it may be that she worships it to this day.  How absurd it\r\nis to try to force on such people Catholic or Protestant forms, which\r\nthey do _not_ understand and never will, while their souls take in with\r\njoy the poly-pantheistic developments of supernaturalism, and that which\r\nsuits their lives.  Like the little boy who _thought_ he would like to\r\nhave a Testament, but _knew_ he wanted a squirt, the Indian, unable to\r\nrise to the grandeur of monotheistic trinitarianism, is delighted with\r\ngoblins, elves, and sorcery.  He can manage the squirt.\r\n\r\nAt Fond-du-Lac I became acquainted with a Mr. Duffy, a very genial and\r\nclever man, a son of a former governor of Rhode Island.  He had an Indian\r\nwife and family, and was looked up to by the Indians as _Kitchimokomon_,\r\n\"the white man.\"  That he was a gentleman will appear from the following\r\nincident.  There was one of our party who, to put it mildly, was not\r\nremarkable for refinement.  A trader at Fond-du-Lac had a very remarkable\r\ncarved Indian pipe, for which he asked me fifteen dollars.  It certainly\r\nwas rather a high price, so I offered ten.  Immediately the man of whom I\r\nspoke laid down fifteen dollars and took the pipe.  He was _dans son\r\ndroit_, but the action was churlish.  It seemed so to Duffy, who was\r\nstanding by.  After I had returned to Philadelphia, Mr. Duffy sent me a\r\nvery handsome pipe for a present, which he assured me had been smoked at\r\ntwo grand councils.  He was indeed a \"white man.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an old Indian here whose name in Indian meant \"He who changes\r\nhis position while sitting,\" but white people called him Martin \"for\r\nshort.\"  He was wont to smoke a very handsome pipe.  One day, seeing him\r\nsmoking a wretched affair rudely hewn, I asked him if he had not a\r\nbetter.  He replied, \"I had, but I sold it to the _kcheemo-komon\r\niqueh_\"--the long-knife woman (_i.e._, to a white lady).  Inquiry proved\r\nthat the \"long-knife woman\" was Miss Lottie Foster, a very beautiful and\r\ndelicate young lady from Philadelphia, to whom such a barbaric term\r\nseemed strangely applied.  As for me, because I always bought every stone\r\npipe which I could get, the Indians called me _Poaugun_ or Pipe.  Among\r\nthe Algonkin of the East in after-days I had a name which means _he who\r\nseeks hidden things_ (_i.e._, mysteries).\r\n\r\nWe came to Duluth.  There were in those days exactly six houses and\r\ntwenty-six Indian wigwams.  However, we were all accommodated somehow.\r\nHere there were grand conferences of the railroad kings with the\r\nauthorities of Duluth and Superior City, which was a few miles distant,\r\nand as the Dulutherans outbid the Father Superiors, the terminus of the\r\nroad was fixed at Duluth.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the ladies should remain at Duluth while we, the\r\nmen, were to go through the woods to examine a situation a day's march\r\ndistant.  We had Indians to carry our luggage.  Every man took a blanket\r\nand a cord, put his load into it, turned the ends over the cord, and then\r\ndrew it up like a bag.  They carried very easily from 150 to 250 lbs.\r\nweight for thirty miles a day over stock and stone, up and down steep\r\nbanks or amid rotten crumbling trees and moss.  Though a good walker, I\r\ncould not keep up with them.\r\n\r\nI had with me a very genial and agreeable man as walking companion.  His\r\nname was Stewart, and he was mayor, chief physician, and filled half-a-\r\ndozen other leading capacities in St. Paul.  Our fellow-travellers\r\nvanished in the forest.  Mayor Stewart and I with one Indian carrier\r\nfound ourselves at two o'clock very thirsty indeed.  The view was\r\nbeautiful enough.  A hundred yards below us by the steep precipice rushed\r\nthe St. Lawrence, but we could not get at it to drink.\r\n\r\nStewart threw himself on the grass in despair.  \"Yes,\" he cried, \"we're\r\nlost in the wilderness, and I'm going to die of thirst.  Remember me to\r\nmy family.\"  \"I say,\" he suddenly cried, \"ask that Injun the name of that\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\nI asked of the Indian, \"_Wa go nin-iu_?\" (\"How do you call that?\")\r\nThinking I wanted to know the name for a stream, he replied, \"_Sebe_.\"\r\nThis is the same as _sipi_ in Missis-sippi.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" groaned Stewart.  \"There is no such river as the _Sebe_ laid\r\ndown on the map.  We're lost in an unknown region.\"\r\n\r\n\"It occurs to me,\" I said, \"that this is a judgment on me.  When I think\r\nof the number of times in my life when I have walked past bar-rooms and\r\nneglected to go in and take a drink, I must think that it is a\r\nretribution.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I say,\" replied Stewart, \"that if you ever do get back to\r\ncivilisation, you'll be the old --- toper that ever was.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the camp we found there by mere chance a large party of\r\nsurveyors.  As there were thirty or forty of us, it was resolved, as so\r\nmany white men had never before been in that region, to constitute a\r\ntownship and elect a member to the Legislature, or Congress, or\r\nsomething--I forget what; but it appeared that it was legal, and it was\r\nactually done--I voting with the rest as a settler.  I, too, am a\r\n_Minnesot_.\r\n\r\nWe railroad people formed one party and sat at our evening meal by\r\nourselves, the surveyors made another, and the Indians a third _table-\r\nd'hote_.  An open tin of oysters was before us, and somebody said they\r\nwere not good.  One only needs say so to ruin the character of an\r\noyster--and too often of \"a human bivalve,\" as the Indiana orator said.\r\nWe were about to pitch it away, when I asked the attendant to give it to\r\nthe Indians.  It was gravely passed by them from man to man till it came\r\nto the last, who lifted it to his mouth and _drank off the entire quart_,\r\n_oysters and all_, as if it had been so much cider.  Amazed at this, I\r\nasked what it meant, but the only explanation I could get was, \"He like\r\num oyster.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a charming excursion, all through the grene wode wilde, and I\r\nenjoyed it.  I had Indian society, and learned Indian talk, and bathed in\r\ncharming rushing waters, and saw enormous pine trees 300 feet high, and\r\nslept _al fresco_, and ate _ad libitum_.  To this day its remembrance\r\ninspires in me a feeling of deep, true poetry.\r\n\r\nI think it was at Duluth that one morning there was brought in an old\r\nsilver cross which had just been found in an Indian grave on the margin\r\nof the lake, not very far away.  I went there with some others.  It was\r\nevidently the grave of some distinguished man who had been buried about a\r\nhundred years ago.  There were the decayed remains of an old-fashioned\r\ngun, and thousands of small beads adhering, still in pattern, to the\r\n_tibiae_.  I dug up myself--in fact they almost lay on the surface, the\r\nsand being blown away--several silver bangles, which at first looked\r\nexactly like birch-bark peelings, and, what I very much prized, two or\r\nthree stone cylinders or tubes, about half an inch in diameter, with a\r\nhole through them.  Antiquaries have been much puzzled over these, some\r\nthinking that they were musical instruments, others implements for\r\ngambling.  My own theory always was that they were used for smoking\r\ntobacco, and as those which I found were actually stuffed full of dried\r\nsemi-decayed \"fine cut,\" I still hold to it.  I also purchased from a boy\r\na red stone pipe-head, which was found in the same grave.  I should here\r\nsay that the pipe which had been bought away from me by the man above\r\nmentioned had on it the carving of a _reindeer_, which rendered it to me\r\nalone of living men peculiarly valuable, since I have laboured hard, and\r\nsubsequently set forth in my \"Algonkin Legends\" the theory that the\r\nAlgonkin Indians went far to the North and there mingled with the\r\nNorsemen of Greenland and Labrador.  The man who got the pipe promised to\r\nleave it to me when he died, but he departed from life and never kept his\r\nword.  A frequent source of grief to me has been to see objects of great\r\nvalue, illustrating some point in archaeology, seized as \"curiosities\" by\r\nignorant wealthy folk.  The most detestable form of this folly is the\r\nbuying of _incunabula_, first editions or uncut copies, and keeping them\r\nfrom publication or reading, and, in short, of worshipping anything, be\r\nit a book or a coin, merely because it is _rare_.  Men never expatiate on\r\n_rariora_ in literature or in china, or talk cookery and wines over-much,\r\nwithout showing themselves prigs.  It is not any beauty in the _thing_,\r\nbut the delightful sense of their own culture or wealth which they\r\ncultivate.  When there is nothing in a thing but mere _rarity_ and cost\r\nto commend it, it is absolutely worthless, as is the learning and\r\nconnoisseurship thereupon dependent.\r\n\r\nBusiness concluded, we took a steamboat, and were very sea-sick on Lake\r\nSuperior for twenty-four hours.  Then we went to the Isle Royale, and saw\r\nthe mines, which had been worked even by the ancient Mexicans; also an\r\nimmense mass of amethysts.  The country here abounds in agates.  At\r\nMarquette there was brought on board a single piece of pure virgin copper\r\nfrom the mine which weighed more than 4,000 pounds.  There it was, I\r\nthink, that we found our cars waiting, and returned in them to\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that my brother Henry died, and his loss inflicted on\r\nme a terrible mental blow, which went far, subsequently, to bring about a\r\ngreat crisis in my health.  My dear brother was the most remarkable\r\nillustration of the fact that there are men who, by no fault of their\r\nown, and who, despite the utmost honour or integrity, deep intelligence,\r\ngood education, and varied talents, are overshadowed all their lives by\r\nsorrow, and meet ill-luck at every turn.  He went at sixteen as _employe_\r\ninto a Cuban importing house, where he learned Spanish.  His principal\r\nfailed, and thence he passed to a store in New York, where he worked far\r\ntoo hard for $600 a year.  His successor, who did much less, was\r\nimmediately paid $2,500 per annum.  Finding that his employer was being\r\nsecretly ruined by his partner, he warned the former, but only with the\r\nresult of being severely reprimanded by the merchant and my father as a\r\nmischief-maker.  After a while this merchant was absolutely ruined and\r\nbankrupted by his partner, as he himself declared to me, but, like many\r\nmen, still kept his _rancune_ against my poor brother.  By this time the\r\neyesight and health of Henry quite gave out for some time.  Every effort\r\nwhich he made, whether to get employment, to become artist or writer,\r\nfailed.  He published two volumes of tales, sporting sketches, &c., with\r\nLippincott, in Philadelphia, which are remarkable for originality.  One\r\nof them was subsequently written out by another distinguished author in\r\nanother form.  I do not say it was after my brother's, for I have known\r\nanother case in which two men, having heard a story from Barnum, both\r\npublished it, ignorant that the other had done so.  But I would declare,\r\nin justice to my brother, that he told this story, which I am sure the\r\nreader knows, quite as well as did the other.\r\n\r\nHe travelled a great deal, was eighteen months in Rome and its vicinity,\r\nvisited Algeria, Egypt, and Cuba and the West, always spending so little\r\nmoney that my father expressed his amazement at it.  I regret to say that\r\nin my youth I never astonished him in this way.  But this morbid\r\nconscientiousness or delicacy as to being dependent did him no good, for\r\nhe might just as well have been thoroughly comfortable, and my father\r\nwould never have missed it.  The feeling that he could get no foothold in\r\nlife, which had long troubled me, became a haunting spectre which\r\nfollowed him to the grave.  His work \"Americans in Rome\" is one of the\r\ncleverest, most sparkling, and brilliant works of humour, without a trace\r\nof vulgarity, ever written in America.  It had originally some such title\r\nas \"Studios and Mountains,\" but the publisher, thinking that the\r\nmiserable clap-trap title of \"Americans in Rome\" would create an\r\nimpression that there was \"gossip,\" and possibly scandal, in it, insisted\r\non that.  It was published in the weary panic of 1862 in the war, and\r\nfell dead from the press.  Though he never really laughed, and was\r\ngenerally absolutely grave, my brother had an incredibly keen sense of\r\nfun, and in conversation could far outmaster or \"walk over the head\" of\r\nany humorist whom I ever met.  He was very far, however, from showing off\r\nor being a professional wit.  He was very fond, when talking with men who\r\nconsidered themselves clever, of making jests or puns in such a manner\r\nand in such an unaffected ordinary tone of voice that they took no note\r\nof the _quodlibets_.  He enjoyed this much more than causing a laugh or\r\nbeing complimented.  But taking his life through, he was simply\r\nunfortunate in everything, and his worst failures were when he made\r\nwisely directed energetic efforts to benefit himself or others.  He\r\nrarely complained or grieved, having in him a deep _fond_ of what I, for\r\nwant of a better term, call _Indian nature_, or stoicism, which is common\r\nin Americans, and utterly incomprehensible to, or rarely found in, a\r\nEuropean.\r\n\r\nThe death of my father left me a fifth of his property, which was\r\nafterwards somewhat augmented by a fourth share of my poor brother's\r\nportion.  For one year I drew no money from the inheritance, but went on\r\nliving as before on my earnings, so that my wife remarked it really took\r\nme a year to realise that I had any money.  After some months I bought a\r\nhouse in Locust Street, just opposite to where my father had lived, and\r\nin this house I remained six months previously to going to Europe in\r\n1869.  We had coloured servants, and I never in all my life, before or\r\nsince, lived so well as during this time.  The house was well furnished;\r\nthere was even the great luxury of no piano, which is a great condition\r\nof happiness.\r\n\r\nThis year I was fearfully busy.  As I had taken the dramatic criticism in\r\nhand, for which alone we had always employed a man, I went during twelve\r\nmonths 140 times to the opera, and every evening to several theatres, _et\r\ncetera_.  Once I was caught beautifully.  There had been an opera bouffe,\r\nthe \"Grande Duchesse\" or something, running for two or three weeks, and I\r\nhad written a criticism on it.  This was laid over by \"press of matter,\"\r\nbut as the same play was announced for the next night with the same\r\nperformers, we published the critique.  But it so chanced that the opera\r\nby some accident was not played!  The _Evening Bulletin_, my old paper,\r\nrallied me keenly on this blunder, and I felt badly.  John Forney, jun.,\r\nhowever, said it was mere rubbish of no consequence.  He was such an\r\narrant Bohemian and hardened son of the press, that he regarded it rather\r\nas a joke and a feather in our caps, indicating that we were a bounding\r\nlot, and not tied down to close observances.  Truly this is a very fine\r\nspirit of freedom, but it may be carried too far, as I think it was by a\r\nfriend of mine, who had but one principle in life, and that was _never_\r\nto write his newspaper correspondence in the place from which it was\r\ndated.  It came to pass that about three weeks after this retribution\r\novertook the _Bulletin_, for it also published a review of an opera which\r\nwas not sung, but I meanly passed the occurrence by without comment.  When\r\na man hits you, it is far more generous, manly, and fraternal to hit him\r\nback a good blow than to degrade him by silent contempt.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential campaign between Grant and Johnson was beginning to warm\r\nup.  Colonel Forney was in a cyclone of hard work between Washington,\r\nPennsylvania, and New York, carrying on a thousand plots and finely or\r\ncoarsely drawn intrigues, raising immense sums, speaking in public, and,\r\nnot to put it too finely, buying or trading votes in a thousand tortuous\r\nor \"mud-turtlesome and possum-like ways\"--for _non possumus_ was not in\r\nhis Latin.  Never shall I forget the disgust and indignation with which\r\nthe great Republican champion entered the office one evening, and,\r\nflinging himself on a chair, declared that votes in New Jersey had gone\r\nup to sixty dollars a head!  And I was forced to admit that sixty dollars\r\nfor a Jerseyman did seem to be an exorbitant price.  So he went forth on\r\nthe war-path with fresh paint and a sharp tomahawk.\r\n\r\nIt often happened to me in his absence to have very curious and critical\r\ndecisions in my power.  One of these is the \"reading in\" or \"reading out\"\r\nof a man from his party.  This is invariably done by a leading political\r\nnewspaper.  I remember, for instance, a man who had been very prominent\r\nin politics, and gone over to the Democrats, imploring me to readmit him\r\nto the fold; but, as I regarded him as a mere office-hunter, I refused to\r\ndo it.  _Excommunicatus sit_!\r\n\r\nThere was a _very_ distinguished and able man in a very high position.  To\r\nhim I had once addressed a letter begging a favour which would have been\r\nnothing at all to grant, but which was of great importance to me, and he\r\nhad taken no notice of it.  It came to pass that we had in our hands to\r\npublish certain very damaging charges against this great man.  He found\r\nit out, and, humiliated, I may say agonised with shame and fear, he\r\ncalled with a friend, begging that the imputations might not be\r\npublished.  I believe from my soul that if I had not been so badly\r\ntreated by him I should have refused his request, but, as it was, I\r\nagreed to withdraw the charges.  It was the very best course, as I\r\nafterwards found.  I am happy to say that, in after years, and in other\r\nlands, he showed himself very grateful to me.  I am by nature as\r\nvindictive as an unconverted Indian, and as I am deeply convinced that it\r\nis vile and wicked, I fight vigorously against it.  In my _Illustrated\r\nNews_ days in New York I used to keep an old German hymn pasted up before\r\nme in the sanctum to remind me not to be revengeful.  Out of all such\r\nbattling of opposing principles come good results.  I feel this in\r\nanother form in the warring within me of superstitious _feelings_ and\r\nscientific convictions.\r\n\r\nIt became apparent that on Pennsylvania depended the election of\r\nPresident.  The State had only been prevented from turning Copperhead-\r\nDemocrat--which was the same as seceding--by the incredible exertions of\r\nthe Union League, led by George H. Boker, and the untiring aid of Colonel\r\nForney.  But even now it was very uncertain, and in fact the election--on\r\nwhich the very existence of the Union virtually depended--was turned by\r\nonly a few hundred votes; and, as Colonel Forney and George H. Boker\r\nadmitted, it would have been lost but for what I am going to narrate.\r\n\r\nThere were many thousand Republican Clubs all through the State, but they\r\nhad no one established official organ or newspaper.  This is of vast\r\nimportance, because such an organ is sent to doubtful voters in large\r\nnumbers, and gives the keynote or clue for thousands of speeches and to\r\nmen stumping or arguing.  It occurred to me early to make the _Weekly\r\nPress_ this organ.  I employed a young man to go to the League and copy\r\nall the names and addresses of all the thousands of Republican clubs in\r\nthe State.  Then I had the paper properly endorsed by the League, and\r\nsent a copy to every club at cost price or for nothing.  This proved to\r\nbe a _tremendous_ success.  It cost us money, but Colonel Forney never\r\ncared for that, and he greatly admired the _coup_.  I made the politics\r\nhot, to suit country customers.  I found the gun and Colonel Forney the\r\npowder and ball, and between us we made a hit.\r\n\r\nOne day Frank Wells, of the _Bulletin_ (very active indeed in the Union\r\nLeague), met me and asked if I, since I had lived in New York, could tell\r\nthem anything as to what kind of a man George Francis Train really was.\r\n\"He has come over all at once,\" he said, \"from the Democratic party, and\r\nwishes to stump Pennsylvania, if we will pay him his expenses.\"  I\r\nreplied--\r\n\r\n\"I know Train personally, and understand him better than most men.  He is\r\nreally a very able speaker for a popular American audience, and will be\r\nof immense service if rightly managed.  But you must get some steady,\r\nsensible man to go with him and keep him in hand and regulate expenses,\r\n&c.\"\r\n\r\nIt was done.  After the election I conversed with the one who had been\r\nthe bear-leader, and he said--\r\n\r\n\"It was an immense success.  Train made thousands of votes, and was a\r\nmost effective speaker.  His mania for speaking was incredible.  One day,\r\nafter addressing two or three audiences at different towns, we stopped at\r\nanother to dine.  While waiting for the soup, I heard a voice as of a\r\npublic speaker, and looking out, saw Train standing on a load of hay,\r\naddressing a thousand admiring auditors.\"\r\n\r\nThere are always many men who claim to have carried every Presidential\r\nelection--the late Mr. Guiteau was one of these geniuses--but it is also\r\ntrue that there are many who would by _not_ working have produced very\r\ngreat changes.  Forney was a mighty wire-puller, if not exactly before\r\nthe Lord, at least before the elections, and he opined that I had secured\r\nthe success.  There were _certainly_ other men--_e.g._, Peacock, who\r\ninfluenced as many votes as the _Weekly Press_, and George Francis\r\nTrain--without whose aid Pennsylvania and Grant's election would have\r\nbeen lost, but it is something to have been one of the few who did it.\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant came in, he resolved to have nothing to do with\r\n\"corrupt old politicians,\" even though they had done him the greatest\r\nservice.  So he took up with a lot of doubly corrupt young ones, who were\r\nonly inferior to the veterans in ability.  Colonel Forney was snubbed\r\ncruelly, in order to rob him.  Whatever he had done wrongly, he had done\r\nhis _work_ rightly, and if Grant intended to throw his politicians\r\noverboard, he should have informed them of it before availing himself of\r\ntheir services.  His conduct was like that of the old lady who got a man\r\nto saw three cords of wood for her, and then refused to pay him because\r\nhe had been divorced.\r\n\r\nI had never in my life asked for an office from anybody.  Mr. Charles A.\r\nDana once said that the work I did for the Republican party on _Vanity\r\nFair_ alone was worth a foreign mission, and that was a mere trifle to\r\nwhat I did with the _Continental Magazine_, my pamphlet, &c.  When Grant\r\nwas President, I petitioned that a little consulate worth $1,000 (200\r\npounds) might be given to a poor Episcopal clergyman, but a man\r\naccustomed to consular work, who spoke French, and who had been secretary\r\nto two commodores.  It was for a small French town.  It was supported by\r\nForney and George H. Boker; but it was _refused_ because I was \"in\r\nForney's set,\" and the consulate was given to a Western man who did not\r\nknow French.\r\n\r\nIf John Forney, instead of using all his immense influence for Grant, had\r\nopposed him tooth and nail, he could not have been treated with more\r\nscornful neglect.  The pretence for this was that Forney had defaulted\r\n$40,000!  I know every detail of the story, and it is this:--While Forney\r\nwas in Europe, an agent to whom he had confided his affairs did take\r\nmoney to that amount.  As soon as Forney learned this, he promptly raised\r\n$40,000 by mortgage on his property, and repaid the deficit.  Even his\r\nenemy Simon Cameron declared he did not believe the story, and the engine\r\nof _his_ revenge was always run by \"one hundred Injun power.\"\r\n\r\nI had \"met\" Grant several times, when one day in London I was introduced\r\nto him again.  He said that he was very happy to make my acquaintance.  I\r\nreplied, \"General Grant, I have had the pleasure of being introduced to\r\nyou _six times_ already, and I hope for many happy renewals of it.\"  A\r\nweek or two after, this appeared in _Punch_, adapted to a professor and a\r\nduchess.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sanitary Fair was held in Philadelphia in 1863, a lady in New\r\nYork wrote to Garibaldi, begging him for some personal souvenir to be\r\ngiven to the charity.  Garibaldi replied by actually sending the dagger\r\nwhich he had carried in every engagement, expressing in a letter a hope\r\nthat it might pass to General Grant.  But a warm partisan of McClellan so\r\narranged it that there should be an election for the dagger between the\r\npartisans of Grant and McClellan, every one voting to pay a dollar to the\r\nFair.  For a long time the McClellanites were in a majority, but at the\r\nlast hour Miss Anna M. Lea, now Mrs. Lea Merritt, very cleverly brought\r\ndown a party of friends, who voted for Grant, secured the dagger for him,\r\nand so carried out the wish of Garibaldi.  Long after an amusing incident\r\noccurred relative to this.  In conversation in London with Mrs. Grant, I\r\nasked her if the dagger had been received.  She replied, \"Oh, yes,\" and\r\nthen added naively, \"but wasn't it really _alt a humbug_?\"\r\n\r\nThe death of my father and brother within a year, the sudden change in my\r\nfortunes, the Presidential campaign, and, above all, the working hard\r\nseven days in the week, had been too much for me.  I began to find,\r\nlittle by little, that I could not execute half the work to which I was\r\naccustomed.  Colonel Forney was very kind indeed, and never said a word.\r\nBut I began to apprehend that a break-down in my health was impending.  I\r\nneeded change of scene, and so resolved, finding, after due\r\nconsideration, that I had enough to live on, to go abroad for a long\r\nrest.  It proved to be a very wise resolve.  So I rented my house, packed\r\nmy trunks, and departed, to be gone \"for a year or two.\"\r\n\r\nI would say, in concluding this chapter, that Colonel John Forney was\r\nuniversally credited, with perfect justice, as having carried Grant's\r\nelection.  When Grant was about to deliver his inaugural speech, a\r\nstranger who stood by me, looking at the immense expectant crowd,\r\nremarked to a friend, \"This is a proud day for John Forney!\"  \"Yes,\"\r\nreplied the other, \"the Dead Duck has elected Grant.\"  But Forney\r\ncheerfully and generously declared that it was the _Weekly Press_ which\r\nhad carried Pennsylvania, and that I had managed it entirely alone.  All\r\nthese things were known to thousands at the time, but we lived in such\r\nexcitement that we made but little account thereof.  However, there are\r\nmen of good repute still living who will amply confirm all that I have\r\nsaid of my work on the _Continental Magazine_; and that Abraham Lincoln\r\nhimself did actually credit me with this is proved by the following\r\nincident.  Because I had so earnestly advocated Emancipation as a war\r\nmeasure at a time when even the most fiery and advanced Abolition papers,\r\nsuch as the _Tribune_, were holding back and shouting _pas trop de\r\nzele_--and as it proved wisely, by advocating it publicly--_merely as a\r\nwar measure_--the President, at the request of George H. Boker, actually\r\nsigned for me fifty duplicate very handsome copies of the Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation on parchment paper, to every one of which Mr. Seward also\r\nadded his signature.  One of these is now hanging up in the British\r\nMuseum as my gift.  I perfectly understood and knew at the time, as did\r\nall concerned, that this was a recognition, and a very graceful and\r\nappropriate one, of what I had done for Emancipation--Harvard having\r\nA.M.'d me for the same.  The copies I presented to the Sanitary Fair to\r\nbe sold for its benefit, but there was not much demand for them; what\r\nwere left over I divided with George Boker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.  EUROPE REVISITED.  1869-1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nVoyage on the _Pereire_--General Washburne--I am offered a command in\r\nanother French Revolution--Paris--J. Meredith Read and Prevost Paradol--My\r\nhealth--Spa--J. C. Hotten--Octave Delepierre--Heidelberg--Dresden--Julian\r\nHawthorne and G. Lathrop--Verona--Venice--Rome--W. W.\r\nStory--Florence--Lorimer Graham--\"Breitmann\" in the Royal Family--Tuscany.\r\n\r\nWe sailed on the famed _Pereire_ from New York to Brest in May, 1869.  We\r\nhad not left port before a droll incident occurred.  On the table in the\r\nsmoking-room lay a copy of the \"Ballads of Hans Breitmann.\"  A fellow-\r\npassenger asked me, \"Is that your book?\"  I innocently replied, \"Yes.\"\r\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" cried another, \"it is _mine_.\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" I\r\nreplied, \"but it is really mine.\"  \"Sir, I _bought_ it.\"  \"I don't care\r\nif you did,\" I replied; \"it is mine--for I wrote it.\"  There was a roar\r\nof laughter, and we all became acquainted at once.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washburne was among the passengers.  He had been appointed\r\nMinister to France and was going to Paris, where he subsequently\r\ndistinguished himself during the siege by literally taking the place of\r\nseven foreign Ministers who had left, and kindly caring for all their\r\n_proteges_.  It never occurred to the old frontiersman to leave a place\r\nor his duties because fighting was going on.  I had a fine twelve-feet\r\nblue Indian blanket, which I had bought somewhere beyond Leavenworth of a\r\ntrader.  When sitting on deck wrapped in it, the General would finger a\r\nfold lovingly, and say, \"Ah! the Indians always have good blankets!\"\r\n\r\nWe arrived in Brest, and Mrs. Leland, who had never before been in\r\nEurope, was much pleased at her first sight, early in the morning, of a\r\nFrench city; the nuns, soldiers, peasants, and all, as seen from our\r\nwindow, were indeed very picturesque.  We left that day by railway for\r\nParis, and on the road a rather remarkable incident occurred.  There was\r\nseated opposite to us a not very amiable-looking man of thirty, who might\r\nbe of the superior class of mechanics, and who evidently regarded us with\r\nan evil eye, either because we were suspected _Anglais_ or aristocrats.  I\r\nresolved that he should become amicable.  Ill-tempered though he might\r\nbe, he was still polite, for at every stopping-place he got out to smoke,\r\nand extinguished his cigar ere he re-entered.  I said to him, \"Madame\r\nbegs that you will not inconvenience yourself so much--pray continue to\r\nsmoke in here.\"  This melted him, as it would any Frenchman.  Seeing that\r\nhe was reading the _Rappel_, I conversed \"liberally.\"  I told him that I\r\nhad been captain of barricades in Forty-eight, and described in full the\r\ntaking of the Tuileries.  His blood was fired, and he confided to me all\r\nthe details of a grand plot for a Revolution which he was going up to\r\nParis to attend to, and offered me a prominent place among the\r\nconspirators, assuring me that I should have a glorious opportunity to\r\nfight again at the barricades!  I was appalled at his want of discretion,\r\nbut said nothing.  Sure enough, there came the _emeute_ of the\r\nplebiscite, as he had predicted, but it was suppressed.  George Boker\r\nwrote to me: \"When I heard of a revolution in Paris, I knew at once that\r\nyou must have arrived and had got to work.\"  And when I told him that I\r\nknew of it in advance, and had had a situation offered me as leader, he\r\ndryly replied, \"Oh, I suppose so--as a matter of course.\"  It was\r\ncertainly a strange coincidence that I left Paris in Forty-eight as a\r\nRevolutionary _suspect_, and re-entered it in 1870 in very nearly the\r\nsame capacity.\r\n\r\nWe found agreeable lodgings at the Rond Point of the Champs Elysees.  The\r\nday after our arrival I determined to arrange the terms of living with\r\nour landlord.  He and his wife had the reputation of being fearful screws\r\nin their \"items.\"  So he, thinking I was a newly arrived and perfectly\r\nignorant American, began to draw the toils, and enumerate so much for the\r\nrooms, so much for every towel, so much, I believe, for salt and every\r\nspoon and fork.  I asked him how much he would charge for everything in\r\nthe lump.  He replied, \"_Mais_, _Monsieur_, _nous ne faisons pas jamais\r\ncomme cela a Paris_.\"  Out of all patience, I burst out into vernacular:\r\n\"_Sacre nom de Dieu et mille tonnerres_, _vieux galopin_! you dare to\r\ntell _me_, a _vieux carabin du Quartier Latin_, that you cannot make\r\narrangements!  _Et depuisse-quand_, _s'il vous plait_?\" {372}  He stared\r\nat me in blank amazement, and then said with a smile: \"_Tiens_!  _Monsieur\r\nest donc de nous_!\"  \"That I am,\" I replied, and we at once made a\r\nsatisfactory compromise.\r\n\r\nWe had pleasant friends, and saw the sights and shopped; but I began to\r\nfeel in Paris for the first time that the dreaded break-down or collapse\r\nwhich I had long apprehended was coming over me.  There was a very clever\r\nsurgeon and physician named Laborde, who was called Nelaton's right-hand\r\nman.  I met him several times, and he observed to a mutual friend that I\r\nwas evidently suffering seriously from threatening nervous symptoms, and\r\nthat he would like to attend me.  He did so, and gave me daily a\r\nteaspoonful of bromide of potassium.  This gave me sleep and appetite;\r\nbut, after some weeks or months, the result was a settled, mild\r\nmelancholy and tendency to rest.  In fact, it was nearly eighteen months\r\nbefore I recovered so that I could write or work, and _live_ as of old.\r\n\r\nI had inherited from both parents, and suffered all my life fearfully at\r\nintervals, from brachycephalic or dorsal neuralgia.  Dr. Laborde made\r\nshort work of this by giving me appallingly strong doses of _tincture of\r\naconite and sulphate of quinine_.  Chemists have often been amazed at the\r\nprescription.  But in due time the trouble quite disappeared, and I now,\r\n_laus Deo_! very rarely ever have a touch of it.  As many persons suffer\r\nterribly from this disorder, which is an _aching_ in the back of the head\r\nand neck accompanied by \"sick headache,\" I give the ingredients of the\r\ncure; the proper quantity must be determined by the physician. {373}\r\n\r\nWe dined once with Mr. Washburne, who during dinner showed his extreme\r\ngoodness of heart in a very characteristic manner.  Some foolish American\r\nhad during the _emeute_--in which I was to have been a leader, had I so\r\nwilled--got himself into trouble, not by fighting, but through mere\r\nprying Yankee \"curiosity\" and mingling with the crowd.  Such people\r\nreally deserve to be shot more than any others, for they get in the way\r\nand spoil good fighting.  He was deservedly arrested, and sent for his\r\nMinister, who, learning it, at once arose, drove to the _prefecture_, and\r\ndelivered his inquisitive compatriot.  On another occasion we were the\r\nguests of J. Meredith Read, then our Minister to Athens, where we met\r\nPrevost Paradol.  But at this time there suddenly came over me a distaste\r\nfor operas, theatres, dinners, society--in short, of crowds, gaslight,\r\nand gaiety in any form, from which I have never since quite recovered.  I\r\nhad for years been fearfully overdoing it all in America, and now I was\r\nin the reaction, and longed for rest.  I was in that state when one could\r\ntruly say that life would be tolerable but for its amusements.  It is\r\nusual for most people to insist in such cases that what the sufferer\r\nneeds is \"excitement\" and \"distraction of the mind,\" change of scene or\r\ngaiety, when in reality the patient should be most carefully trained to\r\nrepose, which is not always easily done, for so very little attention has\r\nbeen paid to this great truth, that even medical science as yet can do\r\nvery little towards calming nervous disorders.  In most cases the trouble\r\nlies in the presence, or unthinking heedless influence, of other people;\r\nand, secondly, in the absence of interesting minor occupations or arts,\r\nsuch as keep the mind busy, yet not over-excited or too deeply absorbed.\r\nAn important element in such cases is to interest deeply the patient in\r\nhimself as a vicious subject to be subdued by his own exertions.  No one\r\nwho has _never_ had the gout severely can form any conception of the\r\nterribly arrogant irritability which accompanies it.  I say _arrogant_,\r\nbecause it is independent of any voluntary action of the mind.  I have\r\noften felt it raging in me, and laughed at it, as if it were a chained\r\nwild beast, and conversed with perfect serenity.  Unfortunately, even our\r\ndearest friends, generally women, cannot, to save their very lives and\r\nsouls, refrain from having frequent piquant scenes with such tempting\r\nsubjects; while, on the other hand, the subjects are often led by mere\r\nvanity into exhibiting themselves as something peculiar.  Altogether, I\r\nbelieve that where there is no deeply seated hereditary or congenital\r\ndefect, or no displacement or injury from violence or disease, there is\r\nalways a cure to be hoped for, or at least possible; but this cure\r\ndepends in many cases so very much upon the wisdom and patience of\r\nfriends and physicians, that it is only remarkable that we find so many\r\nrecoveries as we do.  Where the patient and friends are all really\r\npersons of superior intelligence, almost miraculous cures may be\r\neffected.  But unfortunately, if it be not born in us, it requires a\r\ngreat deal of genius to acquire properly the real _dolce far niente_.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris we went to Spa in the Ardennes.  In this very beautiful place,\r\nin a picturesque land of legends, I felt calmer and more relieved.  I\r\nthink it was there that for the first time I got an inkling that my name\r\nwas becoming known in Europe.  There was a beautiful young English lady\r\nwhom I occasionally met in an artist's studio, who one day asked me with\r\nsome interest whom the Leland could be of whom one heard sometimes--\"he\r\nwrites books, I think.\"  I told her that I had a brother who had written\r\ntwo or three clever works, and she agreed with me that he must be the\r\nman; still she inclined to think that the name was not Henry, but\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\nMr. Nicolas Trubner, whom I had not seen since 1856, came with his wife\r\nand daughter to Spa, and this was the beginning of a great intimacy which\r\nlasted to his death.  Which meeting reminds me of something amusing.  I\r\nhad written the first third of \"Breitmann as a Politician,\" which J.\r\n\"Camden\" Hotten had republished, promising the public to give them the\r\nrest before long.  This I prevented by copyrighting the two remaining\r\nthirds in England!  Being very angry at this, Hotten accused me in print\r\nof having written this conclusion expressly to disappoint and injure\r\n_him_!  In fact, he really seemed to think that Mr. Trubner and I were\r\nonly a pair of foreign rogues, bound together to wrong Mr. J. C. Hotten\r\nout of his higher rights in \"Breitmann.\"  I wrote a pamphlet in which I\r\nsaid this and some other things very plainly.  Mr. Trubner showed this to\r\nhis lawyer, who was of the opinion that it could not be published because\r\nit bore on libel, though there was nothing in it worse than what I have\r\nhere said.  However, Mr. Trubner had it privately printed, and took great\r\njoy, solace, and comfort for a very long time in reading it to his\r\nfriends after dinner, or on other occasions, and as he had many, it got\r\npretty well about London.  I may here very truly remark that Mr. Hotten,\r\nin the public controversy which he had with Mr. Trubner on the subject of\r\nmy \"Ballads,\" displayed an effrontery absolutely without parallel in\r\nmodern times, apropos of which _Punch_ remarked--\r\n\r\n   \"The name of Curll will never be forgotten,\r\n   And neither will be thine, John Camden Hotten.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Spa we went to Brussels, where I remember to have seen many times at\r\nwork in the gallery the famous artist without arms who painted with his\r\ntoes.  What was quite a remarkable was the excellence of his copies from\r\nRembrandt.  Nature succeeded in his case in \"heaping voonders oopen\r\nvoonders,\" as Tom Hood says in his \"Rhine.\"  I became well acquainted\r\nwith Tom Hood the younger in after years, and to this day I contribute\r\nsomething every year to _Tom Hood's Annual_.  At Brussels we stayed at a\r\ncharming old hotel which had galleries one above the other round the\r\ncourtyard, exactly like those of the White Hart Inn immortalised in\r\n\"Pickwick.\"  There was in Philadelphia a perfect specimen of such an inn,\r\nwhich has of late years been rebuilt as the Bingham House.  While in Spa\r\nI studied Walloon.\r\n\r\nFrom Brussels to Ghent, which I found much modernised from what it had\r\nbeen in 1847, when it was still exactly as in the Middle Age, but\r\nfearfully decayed, and, like Ferrara, literary with grass-grown streets.\r\n_Und noch weiter_--to Ostend, where for three weeks I took lessons in\r\nFlemish or Dutch from a young professor, reading \"Vondel\" and\r\n\"Bilderdijk,\" who, if not in the world of letters known, deserves to be.\r\nI had no dictionary all this time, and the teacher marvelled that I\r\nalways knew the meaning of the words, which will not seem marvellous to\r\nany one who understands German and has studied Anglo-Saxon and read\r\n\"Middle or Early English.\"  Then back to Spa to meet Mr. and Mrs. Trubner\r\nand her father Octave Delepierre, who was a great scholar in _rariora_,\r\n_curiosa_, and old French, and _facile princeps_ the greatest expert in\r\nMacaronic poetry who ever wrote.  May I here venture to mention that he\r\nalways declared that my later poem of \"Breitmann and the Pope\" was the\r\nbest Macaronic poem which he had ever read?  His reason for this was that\r\nit was the most reckless and heedless or extravagant combination of Latin\r\nand modern languages known to him.  I had, however, been much indebted to\r\nMr. Oscar Browning for revising it.  And so the truth, which long in\r\ndarkness lay, now comes full clearly to the light of day.\r\n\r\nThence to Liege, Amsterdam, the Hague, Haarlem, and Leyden, visiting all\r\nthe great galleries and many private collections.  At Amsterdam we saw\r\nthe last grand kermess or annual fair ever held there.  It was a Dutch\r\ncarnival, so wild and extravagant that few can comprehend now to what\r\nextremes \"spreeing\" can be carried.  The Dutch, like the Swedes, have or\r\nhad the strange habit of bottling up their hilarity and letting it out on\r\nstated occasions in uproarious frolics.  I saw _carmagnoles_ in which men\r\nand women, seized by a wild impulse, whirled along the street in a\r\nfrantic dance to any chance music, compelling every bystander to join.  I\r\nheard of a Prince from Capua, who, having been thus _carmagnoled_,\r\nreturned home in rags.\r\n\r\nIn Leyden I visited the Archaeological Museum, where I by chance became\r\nacquainted with the chief or director, who was then engaged in\r\nrearranging his collections, and who, without knowing my name, kindly\r\nexpressed the wish that I would remain a week to aid him in preparing the\r\ncatalogue.  As there are few works on prehistoric relics which I do not\r\nknow, and as I had for many years studied with zeal innumerable\r\ncollections of the kind, I venture to believe that his faith in my\r\nknowledge was not quite misplaced.  Even as I write I have just received\r\nthe _Catalogue of Prehistoric Works in Eastern America_, by Cyrus\r\nThomas--a work of very great importance.\r\n\r\nThence we went to Cologne, where it was marvellous to find the Cathedral\r\ncompleted, in spite of the ancient legend which asserts that though the\r\ndevil had furnished its design he had laid a curse upon it, declaring\r\nthat it should never be finished.  Thence up the Rhine by castles grey\r\nand smiling towns, recalling my old foot-journey along its banks; and so\r\non to Heidelberg, where I stayed a month at the Black Eagle.  Herr Lehr\r\nwas still there.  He had grown older.  His son was taking dancing lessons\r\nof Herr Zimmer, who had taught me to waltz twenty years before.  One day\r\nI took my watch to a shop to be repaired, when the proprietor declared\r\nthat he had mended it once before in 1847, and showed me the private mark\r\nwhich he put on it at the time.\r\n\r\nThere were several American students, who received me very kindly.  I\r\nremember among them Wright, Manly, and Overton.  When I sat among them\r\nsmoking and drinking beer, and mingling German student words with\r\nEnglish, it seemed as if the past twenty years were all a dream, and that\r\nI was a _Bursch_ again.  Overton had the reputation of being _par\r\neminence_ the man of men in all Heidelberg, who could take off a full\r\nquart at one pull without stopping to take breath--a feat which I had far\r\noutdone at Munich, in my youth, with the _horn_, and which I again\r\naccomplished at Heidelberg \"without the foam,\" Overton himself, who was a\r\nvery noble young fellow, applauding the feat most loudly.  But I have\r\nsince then often done it with Bass or Alsopp, which is much harder.  I\r\nneed not say that the \"Breitmann Ballads,\" which had recently got among\r\nthe Anglo-American students, and were by them greatly admired, did much\r\nto render me popular.\r\n\r\nI found or made many friends in Heidelberg.  One night we were invited to\r\na supper, and learned afterwards that the two children of our host,\r\nhaving heard that we were Americans, had peeped at us through the keyhole\r\nand expressed great disappointment at not finding us _black_.\r\n\r\nIn November we went to Dresden.  We were so fortunate as to obtain\r\nexcellent rooms and board with a Herr and Madame Rohn, a well-to-do\r\ncouple, who, I am sure, took boarders far more for the sake of company\r\nthan for gain.  Herr Rohn had graduated at Leipzig, but having spent most\r\nof his life in Vienna, was a man of exuberant jollity--a man of gold and\r\na gentleman, even as his wife was a truly gentle lady.  As I am very\r\ntall, and detest German small beds, I complained of mine, and Herr Rohn\r\nsaid he had another, of which I could not complain.  And I certainly\r\ncould not, for when it came I found it was at least eight feet in length.\r\nIt seems that they had once had for a boarder a German baron who was\r\n_more than seven feet_ high, and had had this curiosity constructed; and\r\nHerr Rohn roared with laughter as I gazed on it, and asked if I would\r\nhave it lengthened.\r\n\r\nWe remained in Dresden till February, and found many friends, among whom\r\nthere was much pleasant homelike hospitality.  Among others were Julian\r\nHawthorne and sisters, and George Parsons Lathrop.  They were young\r\nfellows then, and not so well known as they have since become, but it was\r\nevident enough that they had good work in them.  They often came to see\r\nme, and were very kind in many ways.  I took lessons in\r\nporcelain-painting, which art I kept up for many years, and was, of\r\ncourse, assiduous in visiting the galleries, Green Vault, and all works\r\nof art.  I became well acquainted with Passavant, the director.  I was\r\ngetting better, but was still far from being as mentally vigorous as I\r\nhad been.  I now attribute this to the enormous daily dose of bromide\r\nwhich I continued to take, probably mistaking its _influence_ for the\r\noriginal nervous exhaustion itself.  It was not indeed till I got to\r\nEngland, and substituted _lupulin_ in the form of hops--that is to say,\r\npale ale or \"bitter\"--in generous doses, that I quite recovered.\r\n\r\nSo we passed on to Prague, which city, like everything Czech, always had\r\na strange fascination for me.  There I met a certain Mr. Vojtech\r\nNapristek (or Adalbert Thimble), who had once edited in the United States\r\na Bohemian newspaper with which I had exchanged, and with whom I had\r\ncorresponded, but whom I had never before seen.  He had established in\r\nPrague, on American lines, a Ladies' Club of two hundred, which we\r\nvisited, and was, I believe, owing to an inheritance, now a prosperous\r\nman.  Though I am not a Thimble, it also befell me, in later years, to\r\nfound and preside over a Ladies' Art Club of two hundred souls.  At that\r\ntime the famous legendary bridge, with the ancient statue of St. John\r\nNepomuk, still existed as of yore.  No one imagined that a time would\r\ncome when they would be washed away through sheer neglect.\r\n\r\nSo on to Munich, where, during a whole week, I saw but one _Riegelhaube_,\r\na curious head-dress or chignon-cover of silver thread, once very common.\r\nEven the old Bavarian dialect seemed to have almost vanished, and I was\r\nglad to hear it from our porter.  Many old landmarks still existed, but\r\nKing Louis no longer ran about the streets--I nearly ran against him\r\nonce; people no longer were obliged by law to remove cigars or pipes from\r\ntheir mouths when passing a sentry-box.  Lola Montez had vanished.  _Mais\r\nou sont les neiges d'antan_?\r\n\r\nSo we went over the Brenner Pass, stopped at Innspruck, and saw the\r\nchurch described by Heine in his _Reisebilder_, and came to Verona, the\r\nBern of the _Heldenbuch_.  \"_Ich will gen Bern ausreiten_, _sprach\r\nMeister Hildebrand_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a happy thought of the Italians to put picturesque Verona down as\r\nthe first stopping-place for Northern travellers, and I rather like\r\nRuskin's idea of buying the town and keeping it intact as a piece of\r\n_bric-a-brac_.  He might have proposed Rome while he was about it;\r\n\"anything there can be had for money,\" says Juvenal.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the station I alone was left to encounter the fierce\r\ndouaniers.  One of them, inquisitive as to tobacco, when I told him I had\r\nnone, laid his finger impressively on the mouthpiece of my pipe,\r\nremarking that where the tail of the fox was seen the fox could not be\r\nfar off.  To which I replied that I indeed had no tobacco, but wanted\r\nsome very badly, and that I would be much obliged to him if he would give\r\nme a little to fill my pipe.  So all laughed.  My wife entering at this\r\ninstant, cried in amazement, \"Why, Charles! where did you ever learn to\r\ntalk Italian?\"  Which shows that there can be secrets even between\r\nmarried people; though indeed my Italian has always been of such inferior\r\nquality that it is no wonder that I never boasted of it even in\r\nconfidence.  It is, in fact, the Hand-organo dialect flavoured with\r\nFlorentine.\r\n\r\nThere was an old lady who stood at the door of a curiosity-shop in\r\nVerona, and she had five pieces of bone-carvings from some old _scatola_\r\nor marriage-casket.  She asked a fabulous price for them, and I offered\r\nfive francs.  She scorned the paltry sum with all the vehemence of a\r\nsusceptible soul whose tenderest feelings have been outraged.  So I went\r\nmy way, but as I passed the place returning, the old lady came forth,\r\nand, graciously courtesying and smiling, held forth to me the earrings\r\nneatly wrapped in paper, and thanked me for the five francs!  Which\r\nindicated to me that the good small folk of Italy had not materially\r\nchanged since I had left the country.\r\n\r\nWe came to Venice, and went to a hotel, where we had a room given to us\r\nwhich, had we wished to give a ball, would have left nothing to be\r\ndesired.  I counted in it twenty-seven chairs and seven tables, all at\r\nsuch a distance from one another that they seemed not to be on speaking\r\nterms.  I do not think I ever got quite so far as the upper end of that\r\nroom while I inhabited it--it was probably somewhere in Austria.  I have\r\nspoken of having met Mr. Wright at Heidelberg.  He was from Wilkesbarre,\r\nPennsylvania.  The next day after my arrival I found among the names of\r\nthe departed, \"Signore Wright-_Kilkes_, from Barre, Pennsylvania,\r\nAmerica.\"  This reminded me of the Anglo-American who was astonished at\r\nRome at receiving invitations and circulars addressed to him as\r\n\"Illustrissimo Varanti Solezer.\"  It turned out that an assistant,\r\nreading aloud to the clerk the names from the trunks, had mistaken a very\r\nlarge \"WARRANTED SOLE LEATHER\" for the name of the owner.\r\n\r\nAnd this on soles reminds me that there was a _femme sole_ or lone\r\nacrimonious British female at our hotel, who declared to me one evening\r\nthat she had _never_ in all her life been so _insulted_ as she was that\r\nday at a banker's; and the insult consisted in this, that she, although\r\nquite unknown to him, had asked him to cash a cheque on London, which he\r\nhad declined to do.  I remarked that no banker who did business properly\r\never ought to cash a cheque from a total stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the lady, \"do _I look_ like an impostor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" I replied, \"I have seen thieves and wretches of the vilest type\r\nwho could not have been distinguished from either of us as regards\r\nrespectability of appearance.  You do not appear to know much about such\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to say, sir,\" replied the lady with intense acidity, \"that\r\n_I_ do _not_.\"  But she added triumphantly, \"What do you say when I tell\r\nyou that I had my _cheque-book_?  How could I have possessed it if I had\r\nnot a right to draw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any scamp,\" I replied, \"can deposit a few pounds in a bank, buy a cheque-\r\nbook, and then draw his money.\"\r\n\r\nBut the next day she came to me in radiant sneering triumph.  She had\r\nfound another banker, who was a gentleman, with a marked emphasis, who\r\nhad cashed her cheque.  How many people there are in this world whose\r\ndefinition of a gentleman is \"one who does whatever pleases _us_!\"\r\n\r\nIn Florence we went directly to the Hotel d'Europe in the Via\r\nTuornabuoni, where my Indian blanket vanished even while entering the\r\nhotel, and surrounded only by the servants to whom the luggage had been\r\nconfided.  As the landlord manifested great disgust for me whenever I\r\nmentioned such a trifle, and as the porter and the rest declared that\r\nthey would answer soul and body for one another's honesty, I had to grin\r\nand bear it.  I really wonder sometimes that there are not more boarders,\r\nwho, like Benvenuto Cellini, set fire to hotels or cut up the bedclothes\r\nbefore leaving them.  That worthy, having been treated not so badly as I\r\nwas at the Hotel d'Europe and at another in Florence, cut to pieces the\r\nsheets of his bed, galloped away hastily, and from the summit of a\r\ndistant hill had the pleasure of seeing the landlord in a rage.  Now\r\npeople write to the _Times_, and \"cut up\" the whole concern.  It all\r\ncomes to the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn Florence I saw much of an old New York friend, the now late Lorimer\r\nGraham.  When he died, Swinburne wrote a poem on him.  He was a man of\r\ngreat culture and refined manner.  There was something sympathetic in him\r\nwhich drew every one irresistibly into liking.  It was his instinct to be\r\nkind and thoughtful to every one.  He gave me letters to Swinburne, Lord\r\nHoughton, and others.\r\n\r\nI made an acquaintance by chance in Florence whom I can never forget: for\r\nhe was a character.  One day while in the Uffizi Gallery engaged in\r\nstudying the great Etruscan vase, now in the Etruscan Museum, a stranger\r\nstanding by me said, \"Does not this seem to you like a mysterious book\r\nwritten in forgotten characters?  Is not a collection of such vases like\r\na library?\"\r\n\r\n\"On that hint I spake.\"  \"I see,\" I replied, \"you refer to the so-called\r\nEtruscan Library which an Englishman has made, and which contains only\r\nvases and inscriptions in that now unknown tongue of Etruria.  And\r\nindeed, when we turn over the pages of Inghirami, Gherard, and Gori,\r\nGray, or Dennis, it does indeed really seem--But what do you really think\r\nthe old Etruscan language truly was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, my friend,\" cried the stranger in broad Yankee, \"I guess I'm\r\nbarkin' up the wrong tree.  I calculated to tell _you_ something, but\r\nyou're ahead of me.\"\r\n\r\nWe both laughed and became very good friends.  He lived at our hotel, and\r\nhad been twenty-five years in Italy, and knew every custode in every\r\ngallery, and could have every secret treasure unlocked.  He was perfectly\r\nat home about town--would stop and ask a direction of a cab-driver, and\r\nwas capable of going into an umbrella-shop when it rained.\r\n\r\nWe went on to Rome, and I can only say that as regards what we saw there,\r\nmy memory is confused literally with an _embarras de richesses_.  The\r\nEcumenical Council was being held, at which an elderly Italian gentleman,\r\nwho possibly did not know oxygen from hydrogen, or sin from sugar, was\r\ndeclared to be infallible in his judgment of all earthly things.\r\n\r\nWhile in Rome we saw a great deal of W. W. Story, the sculptor, and his\r\nwife and daughter, Edith, for whom Thackeray wrote his most beautiful\r\ntale, and I at my humble distance the ballad of \"Breitmann in Rome,\"\r\nwhich contained a remarkable prophecy, of the Franco-German war.  At\r\ntheir house we met Odo Russell and Oscar Browning, and many more whose\r\nnames are known to all.  It was there also that a lady of the Royal\r\nEnglish household amused us very much one evening by narrating how the\r\n\"Breitmann Ballads,\" owing to their odd mixture of German and English,\r\nwere favourite subjects for mutual reading and recitation among the then\r\nyouthful members of the Royal family, and what haste and alarm there was\r\nto put the forbidden book out of the way when Her Majesty the Queen was\r\nannounced as coming.  I also met in Rome the American poet and painter T.\r\nBuchanan Read, who gave me a dinner, and very often that remarkable\r\ncharacter General Carroll Tevis, who, having fought under most flags, and\r\nbeen a Turkish bey or pacha, was now a chamberlain of the Pope.  In the\r\nfollowing year he fought for the French, behaved with great bravery in\r\nBourbaki's retreat, and was decorated on the field of battle.  Then\r\nagain, when I was in Egypt, Tevis was at the head of the military\r\ncollege.  He had fairly won his rank of general in the American Civil\r\nWar, but as there was some disinclination or other to give it to him, I\r\nhad used my influence in his favour with Forney, who speedily secured it\r\nfor him.  He was a perfect type of the old _condottiero_, but with Dugald\r\nDalgetty's scrupulous faith to his military engagements.  The American\r\nclergyman in Rome was the Rev. Dr. Nevin, a brother of my friend Captain\r\nNevin.  There was also Mrs. John Grigg, an old Philadelphia friend (now\r\nresiding in Florence), to whom we were then, as we have continually been\r\nsince, indebted for the most cordial hospitality.\r\n\r\nThrough the kind aid of General Tevis we were enabled to see all the\r\nprincipal ceremonies of the Holy Week and Easter.  This year, owing to\r\nthe Council, everything was on a scale of unusual magnificence.  I can\r\nsay with Panurge that I have seen three Popes, but will not add with him,\r\n\"and little good did it ever do me,\" for Mrs. Leland at least was much\r\ngratified with a full sight and quasi-interview with His Holiness.\r\n\r\nThere was a joyous sight for a cynic to be seen in Rome in those days--in\r\nfact, it was only last year (1891) that it was done away with.  This was\r\nthe drawing of the lottery by a priest.  There was on a holy platform a\r\nholy wheel and a holy little boy to draw the holy numbers, and a holy old\r\npriest to oversee and _bless_ the whole precious business.  The blessing\r\nof the devil would have been more appropriate, for the lotteries are the\r\ncurse of Italy.  What the Anglo-American mechanic puts into a savings\r\nbank, the Italian invests in lotteries.  In Naples there are now fourteen\r\ntickets sold per annum for the gross amount of the population, and in\r\nFlorence twelve.\r\n\r\nOne day I took a walk out into the country with Briton Riviere and some\r\nother artists.  I had a cake or two of colour, and Riviere, with wine for\r\nwater, at a _trattoria_ where we lunched, made a picture of the attendant\r\nmaid.  He pointed out to me on the road a string of peasants carrying\r\ngreat loaves of coarse bread.  They had walked perhaps twenty miles to\r\nbuy it, because in those days people were not allowed to bake their own\r\nbread, but must buy it at the public _forno_, which paid a tax for the\r\nprivilege.  So long as Rome was under Papal control, its every municipal\r\ninstitution, such as hospitals, prisons, and the police, were in a state\r\nof absolutely incredible inhuman vileness, while under everything ran\r\ncorruption and dishonesty.  The lower orders were severely disciplined as\r\nto their sexual morals, because it was made a rich source of infamous\r\ntaxes, as it now is in other cities of Europe; but cardinals and the\r\nwealthier priests kept mistresses, almost openly, since these women were\r\npointed out to every one as they flaunted about proudly in their\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome we passed into Pisa, Genoa, Spezzia, and Nice, over the old\r\nCornici road, and so again to Paris, where we remained six weeks, and\r\nthen left in June, 1870, just before the war broke out.  While in the\r\ncity we saw at different times in public the Emperor and Empress, also\r\nthe Queen of Spain.  The face of Louis Napoleon was indeed somewhat\r\nchanged since I saw him in London in 1848, but it had not improved so\r\nmuch as his circumstances, as he was according to external appearances\r\nand popular belief now extremely well off.  But appearances are\r\ndeceptive, as was soon proved, for he was in reality on the verge of a\r\nworse bankruptcy than even his uncle underwent, for the nephew lost not\r\nonly kingdom and life, but also every trace of reputation for wisdom and\r\nhonesty, remaining to history only as a brazen royal adventurer and\r\n\"copper captain.\"\r\n\r\nIn Rome our dear old friend Mrs. John Grigg showed us, as I said, many\r\nkind attentions, which she has, in Florence, continued to this day.  This\r\nlady is own aunt to my old school friend General George B. McClellan.  At\r\nan advanced age she executes without glasses the most exquisite\r\nembroidery conceivable, and her heart and intellect are in keeping with\r\nher sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.  ENGLAND.  1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trubners--George Eliot and G. H. Lewes--Heseltine--Edwards--Etched by\r\nBracquemond and Legros--Jean Ingelow--Tennyson--Hepworth Dixon--Lord\r\nLytton the elder--Lord Houghton--Bret Harte--France, Alsace, and\r\nLorraine--Samuel Laing--Gypsies--The Misses Horace Smith--Brighton and\r\nodd fish--Work and books--Hunting--Dore--Art and\r\nNature--Taglioni--Chevalier Wykoff--Octave Delepierre--Breitmann--Thomas\r\nCarlyle--George Borrow--A cathedral tour round about England--Salisbury,\r\nWells, and York.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant being anywhere in England in June, and the passing from\r\npicturesque Dover to London through laughing Kent is a good introduction\r\nto the country.  The untravelled American, fresh from the \"boundless\r\nprairies\" and twenty-thousand-acre fields of wheat, sees nothing in it\r\nall but the close cultivation of limited land; but the tourist from the\r\nContinent perceives at once that, with most careful agriculture, there\r\nare indications of an exuberance of wealth, true comfort, and taste\r\nrarely seen in France or Germany.  The many trees of a better quality and\r\nslower growth than the weedy sprouting poplar and willow of Normandy; the\r\nhedges, which are very beautiful and ever green; the flowerbeds and walks\r\nabout the poorest cottage; the neatly planted, prettily bridged side\r\nroads, all indicate a superiority of wealth or refinement such as\r\nprevails only in New England, or rather which _did_ prevail, until the\r\nnative population, going westward, was supplanted by Irish or worse, if\r\nany worse there be at turning neatness into dirty disorder.\r\n\r\nThat older American population was deeply English, with a thousand rural\r\nEnglish traditions religiously preserved; and the chief of these is clean\r\n_neatness_, which, when fully carried out, always results in simple,\r\nunaffected beauty.  This was very strongly shown in the Quaker gardens,\r\nonce so common in Philadelphia--and in the people.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in London, and went directly to the Trubners', No. 29 Upper\r\nHamilton Terrace, N.W.  The first person who welcomed me was Mr.\r\nDelepierre, an idol of mine for years; and the first thing I did was to\r\nborrow half-a-crown of him to pay the cab, having only French money with\r\nme.  It was a charming house, with a large garden, so redolent of roses\r\nthat it might have served Chriemhilda of old for a romance.  For twenty\r\nyears that house was destined to be an occasional home and a dwelling\r\nwhere we were ever welcome, and where every Sunday evening I had always\r\nan appointed place at dinner, and a special arm-chair for the\r\nnever-failing Havannah.  Mrs. Trubner had, in later years, two boxes of\r\nHavannahs of the best, which had belonged to G. H. Lewes, and which\r\nGeorge Eliot gave her after his death.  I have kept two _en souvenir_.  I\r\nknew a man once who had formed a large collection of such relics.  There\r\nwas a cigar which he had received from Louis Napoleon, and one from\r\nBismarck, and so forth.  But, alas! once while away on his travels, the\r\nwhole museum was smoked up by a reckless under-graduate younger brother.\r\n_In fumo exit_.\r\n\r\nHow many people well known to the world--or rather how few who were\r\nnot--have I met there--Edwin Arnold, G. H. Lewes, H. Dixon, M. Van der\r\nWeyer, Frith the artist, Mrs. Trubner's uncle Lord Napier of Magdala,\r\nPigott, Norman Lockyer, Bret Harte, \"and full many more,\" scholars,\r\npoets, editors, and, withal, lady writers of every good shade, grade, and\r\nquality.  How many of them all have passed since then full silently into\r\nthe Silent Land, where we may follow, but return no more!  How many a\r\npleasant smile and friendly voice and firm alliances and genial\r\nacquaintances, often carried out in other lands, date their beginning in\r\nmy memory to the house in Hamilton Terrace!  How often have I heard by\r\nland or sea the familiar greeting, \"I think I met you once at the\r\nTrubners'!\"  For it was a salon, a centre or sun with many bright and\r\ncheering rays--a civilising institution!\r\n\r\nMrs. Trubner was the life of this home.  Anglo-Belgian by early relation\r\nand education, she combined four types in one.  When speaking English,\r\nshe struck me as the type of an accomplished and refined British matron;\r\nin French, her whole nature seemed Parisienne; in Flemish, she was\r\naltogether Flamande; and in German, Deutsch.  If Cerberus was three\r\ngentlemen in one, Mrs. Trubner was four ladies united.  Very well read,\r\nshe conversed not only well on any subject, but, what is very unusual in\r\nher sex, with sincere interest, and not merely to entertain.  If\r\ninterrupted in a conversation she resumed the subject!  This is a\r\nremarkable trait!\r\n\r\nThe next day after our arrival Mrs. Trubner took Mrs. Leland, during a\r\nwalk, to call on George Eliot, and that evening G. H. Lewes, Hepworth\r\nDixon, and some others came to a reception at the Trubners'.  Both of\r\nthese men were, as ever, very brilliant and amusing in conversation.  I\r\nmet them very often after this, both at their homes and about London.  I\r\nalso became acquainted with George Eliot or Mrs. Lewes, who left on me\r\nthe marked impression, which she did on all, of being a woman of genius,\r\nthough I cannot recall anything remarkable which I ever heard from her.  I\r\nnote this because there were most extraordinary reports of her utterances\r\namong her admirers.  A young American lady once seriously asked me if it\r\nwere true that at the Sunday afternoon receptions in South Bank one could\r\nalways see rows of twenty or thirty of the greatest men in England, such\r\nas Carlyle, Froude, and Herbert Spencer, all sitting with their\r\nnote-books silently taking down from her lips the ideas which they\r\nsubsequently used in their writings!  There seemed, indeed, to be afloat\r\nin America among certain folk an idea that something enormous,\r\nmarvellous, and inspired went on at these receptions, and that George\r\nEliot posed as a Pythia or Sibyl, as the great leading mind of England,\r\nand lectured while we listened.  There is no good portrait, I believe, of\r\nher.  She had long features and would have been called plain but for her\r\nsolemn, earnest eyes, which had an expression quite in keeping with her\r\nvoice, which was one not easily forgotten.  I never detected in her any\r\ntrace of genial humour, though I doubt not that it was latent in her; and\r\nI thought her a person who had drawn her ideas far more from books and an\r\nacquaintance with certain types of humanity whom she had set herself\r\ndeliberately to study--albeit with rare perception--than from an easy\r\nintuitive familiarity with all sorts and conditions of men.  But she\r\nworked out _thoroughly_ what she knew by the intuition of genius, though\r\nin this she was very far inferior to Scott.  Thus she wrote the \"Spanish\r\nGypsy,\" having only seen such gypsies two or three times.  One day she\r\ntold me that in order to write \"Daniel Deronda,\" she had read through two\r\nhundred books.  I longed to tell her that she had better have learned\r\nYiddish and talked with two hundred Jews, and been taught, as I was by my\r\nfriend Solomon the Sadducee, the art of distinguishing Fraulein Lowenthal\r\nof the Ashkenazim from Senorita Aguado of the Sephardim _by the corners\r\nof their eyes_!\r\n\r\nI had read more than once Lewes's \"Life of Goethe,\" his \"History of\r\nPhilosophy and Physiology,\" and even \"written him\" for the Cyclopaedia.\r\nWith him I naturally at once became well acquainted.  I remember here\r\nthat Mr. Ripley had once reproved me for declaring that Lewes had really\r\na claim to be an original philosopher or thinker; for Boston intellect\r\nalways frowned on him after Margaret Fuller condemned him as \"frivolous\r\nand atheistic.\"  I remember that Tom Powell had told me how he had dined\r\nsomewhere in London, where there was a man present who had really been a\r\ncannibal, owing to dire stress of shipwreck, and how Lewes, who was\r\nthere, was so fascinated with the man-eater that he could think of\r\nnothing else.  Lewes told me that once, having gone with a party of\r\narchaeologists to visit a ruined church, he found on a twelfth-century\r\ntombstone some illegible letters which he persuaded the others to believe\r\nformed the name Golias, probably having in mind the poems of Walter de\r\nMapes.  When I returned from Russia I delighted him very much by\r\ndescribing how I had told the fortunes by hand of six gypsy girls.  He\r\ndeclared that telling fortunes to gypsies was the very height of\r\nimpudence!\r\n\r\n   \"A hundred jests have passed between us twain,\r\n   Which, had I space, I'd gladly tell again.\"\r\n\r\nA call which I have had, since I wrote that last line, from John Postle\r\nHeseltine, Esq., reminds me that he was one of the first acquaintances I\r\nmade in London.  Mr. E. Edwards, a distinguished etcher and painter, gave\r\nme a dinner at Richmond, at which Mr. Heseltine was present.  In Edwards'\r\nstudio I met with Bracquemond and Legros, both of whom etched my portrait\r\non copper.  Mr. Heseltine is well known as a very distinguished artist of\r\nthe same kind, as well as for many other things.  Edwards was very kind\r\nto me in many ways for years.  Legros I found very interesting.  There\r\nwas in Edwards' studio the unique _complete_ collection of the etchings\r\nof Meryon, which we examined.  Legros remarked of the incredibly long-\r\ncontinued industry manifested in some of the pictures, that lunatics\r\noften manifested it to a high degree.  Meryon, as is known, was mad.  I\r\nhad etched a very little myself and was free of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days Mr. Strahan, the publisher, took me to Mr. (now Lord)\r\nTennyson's reception, where I met with many well-known people.  Among\r\nthem were Lady Charlotte Locker and Miss Jean Ingelow.  These ladies,\r\nwith great kindness, finding that I was married, called on Mrs. Iceland,\r\nand invited us to dine.  I became a constant visitor for years at Miss\r\nIngelow's receptions, where I have met Ruskin, Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall\r\n(whom I had seen in 1848), Calverly, Edmund Gosse, Hamilton Aide, Mr. and\r\nMrs Alfred Hunt.  I conversed with Tennyson, but little passed between us\r\non that occasion.  I got to know him far better \"later on.\"\r\n\r\nI here anticipate by several years two interviews which I had with\r\nTennyson in 1875, who had _ad interim_ been deservedly \"lauded into\r\nLordliness,\" and which, to him at least, were amusing enough to be\r\nrecalled.  The first was at a dinner at Lady Franklin's, and her niece\r\nMiss Cracroft.  And here I may, in passing, say a word as to the\r\nextraordinary kindly nature of Lady Franklin.  I think it was almost as\r\nsoon as we became acquainted that she, learning that I suffered at times\r\nfrom gout, sent me a dozen bottles of a kind of bitter water as a cure.\r\n\r\nThere were at the dinner as guests Mr. Tennyson, Sir Samuel and Lady\r\nBaker, Dr. Quain, and myself.  There was no lack of varied anecdote,\r\nreminiscences of noted people and of travel; but by far the most\r\ndelightful portion of it all was to watch the gradual unfreezing of\r\nTennyson, and how from a grim winter of taciturnity, under the glowing\r\ninfluence of the sun of wine, as the Tuscan Redi hath it--\r\n\r\n   \"Dell' Indico Oriente\r\n   Domator glorioso il Dio di Vino . . .\r\n   Di quel Sol, che in Ciel vedete . . .\"--\r\n\r\nhe passed into a glorious summer of genial feeling.  I led unto it\r\nthus:--My friend Professor Palmer and I had projected a volume of songs\r\nin English Romany or Gypsy, which is by far the sweetest and most\r\neuphonious language in Europe.  My friend had translated \"Home they\r\nbrought her warrior dead,\" by Tennyson, into this tongue, and I had the\r\nMS. of it in my pocket.  Tennyson was very much pleased at the\r\ncompliment, and asked me to read the poem, which I did.  The work was by\r\npermission dedicated to him.  At last, when dinner was over, Tennyson,\r\nwho had disposed of an entire bottle of port, rose, and approaching me,\r\ntook me gaily-gravely by both sides, as if he would lift me up, and\r\ndrawing himself up to his full height, said, \"I like to see a poet a full-\r\nsized substantial man,\" or \"tall and strong,\" or words to that effect.  I\r\nreplied that it was very evident from the general appearance of\r\nShakespeare's bust that he was a very tall man, but that though the\r\nthunder of height had hit twice--the Poet Laureate being the second\r\ncase--that I had been very slightly singed, tall as I was.  _Enfin_, some\r\ndays after, Tennyson in a letter invited me to call and see him should I\r\never be in the Isle of Wight; which took place by mere chance some time\r\nafter--in fact, I did not know, when I was first at the hotel in\r\nFreshwater, that Tennyson lived at a mile's distance.\r\n\r\nI walked over one afternoon and sent in my card.  Mr. Hallam Tennyson,\r\nthen a very handsome young man of winsome manner, came out and said that\r\nhis father was taking his usual _siesta_, but begged me to remain, kindly\r\nadding, \"Because I know, Mr. Leland, he would be very sorry to have\r\nmissed you.\"  After a little time, however, Tennyson himself appeared,\r\nand took me up to his den or studio, where I was asked to take a pipe,\r\nwhich I did with great good-will, and blew a cloud, enjoying it greatly,\r\nbecause I felt with my host, as with Bulwer, that we had quickly crossed\r\nacquaintanceship into the more familiar realm where one can talk about\r\nwhatever you please with the certainty of being understood and getting a\r\nsympathetic answer.  There are lifelong friends with whom one never\r\nreally gets to this, and there are acquaintances of an hour at _table-\r\nd'hotes_, who \"come like shadows, so depart,\" who talk with a touch to\r\nour hearts.  Bulwer and Tennyson were such to me, and _apre miro zi_, as\r\nthe gypsies say--on my life-soul!--if I had talked with them, as I did,\r\nwithout knowing who they were, I should have recalled them with quite as\r\nmuch interest as I now do, and see them again in dreams.  And here I may\r\nadd, that the common-place saying that literary men are rarely good\r\ntalkers, and generally disappointing, is not at all confirmed by my\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nAfter burning our tobacco, in Indian fashion, to better acquaintance (I\r\nforgot to say that the poet had two dozen clay pipes ranged in a small\r\nwooden rack), we went forth for a seven miles' walk on the Downs.  And at\r\nlast, from the summit of one, I pointed down to a small field below, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\nBut first I must specify that the day before I had gone with a young lady\r\nof fourteen summers named Bee or Beatrice Fredericson, both of us bearing\r\nbaskets, to pick blackberries for tea, and coming to a small field which\r\nwas completely surrounded by a hedge, we saw therein illimitable\r\nblackberries glittering in the setting sunlight, and longed to enter.\r\nFinding a gap which had been filled by a dead thorn-bush, I removed the\r\nlatter, and, going in, we soon picked a quart of the fruit.  But on\r\nleaving we were met by the farmer, who made a to-do, charging us with\r\ntrespassing.  To which I replied, \"Well, what is to pay?\"  He asked for\r\ntwo shillings, but was pacified with one; and so we departed.\r\n\r\nTherefore I said to Tennyson, \"I went into that field yesterday to pick\r\nyour blackberries, and your farmer caught us and made me pay a shilling\r\nfor trespassing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he gravely replied, though evidently delighted--\"Served you right!\r\nWhat business had you to come over my hedge into my field to steal my\r\nblackberries?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mea culpa_,\" I answered, \"_mea maxima culpa_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Leland,\" pursued Tennyson, as gravely as ever, grasping all the\r\nabsurdity of the thing with evident enjoyment, \"you have no idea how\r\ntourists trespass here to get at me.  They climb over my gate and look in\r\nat my windows.  It is a fact--one did so only last week.  But I declare\r\nthat you are the very first poet and man of letters who ever came here--to\r\nsteal blackberries!\"  Here he paused, and then added forcibly--\r\n\r\n\"I _do_ believe you are a gypsy, after all.\"\r\n\r\nThen we talked of the old manor-houses in the neighbourhood, and of the\r\nfamous Mortstone, a supposed Saxon rude monolith near by.  I thought it\r\nprehistoric, because I had dug out from the pile of earth supporting and\r\ncoeval with it (and indeed only with a lead-pencil) a flint flake chipped\r\nby hand and a bit of cannel coal, which indicate dedication.  My host\r\nlistened with great interest, and then told me a sad tale: how certain\r\nworkmen employed by him to dig on his land had found a great number of\r\nold Roman bronze coins, but, instead of taking them to him, had kept\r\nthem, though they cared so little for them that they gave a handful to a\r\nboy whom they met.  \"I told them,\" said Tennyson, \"that they had been\r\nguilty of malappropriation, and though I was not quite sure whether the\r\ncoins belonged to me or to the Crown, that they certainly had no right to\r\nthem.  Whereupon their leader said that if I was not satisfied they would\r\nnot work any longer for me, and so they went away.\"  I had on this\r\noccasion a long and interesting discussion with Mr. Tennyson relative to\r\nWalt Whitman, and involving the principles or nature of poetry.  According\r\nto the poet-laureate, poetry, as he understood it, consisted of elevated\r\nor refined, or at least superior thought, expressed in melodious form,\r\nand in this latter it seemed to him (for it was very modestly expressed)\r\nthat Whitman was wanting.  Wherein he came nearer to the truth than does\r\nSymonds, who overrates, as it seems to me, the value, as regards art and\r\npoetry, of simply _equalising_ all human intelligences.  Though I never\r\nmet Symonds, there was mutual knowledge between us, and when I published\r\nmy \"Etrusco-Roman Remains in Popular Traditions,\" which contains the\r\nresults of six years' intimacy with witches and fortune-tellers, he wrote\r\na letter expressing enthusiastic admiration of it to Mr. T. Fisher Unwin.\r\nNow all three of these great men are dead.  I shall speak of Whitman\r\nanon, for in later years for a long time I met him almost daily.\r\n\r\nI can remember that during the conversation Tennyson expressed himself,\r\nrather to my amazement, with some slight indignation at a paltry review\r\nabusing his latest work; to which I replied--\r\n\r\n\"If there is anything on earth for which I have envied you, even more\r\nthan for your great renown as a poet, it has been because I supposed you\r\nwere completely above all such attacks and were utterly indifferent to\r\nthem.\"  Which he took amiably, and proceeded to discuss ripe fruit and\r\nwasps--or their equivalent.  Yet I doubt whether I was quite in the\r\nright, since those who live for fame honourably acquired must ever be\r\nsusceptible to stings, small or great.  An editor who receives abusive\r\nletters so frequently that he ends by pitching them without reading into\r\nthe waste-basket, and often treats ribald attacks in print in the same\r\nmanner--as I have often done--has so many other affairs on his mind that\r\nhe becomes case-hardened.  But I have observed from long experience that\r\nthere is a Nemesis who watches those who arrogate the right to lay on the\r\nrod, and gives it to them with interest in the end.\r\n\r\nIt was very soon after my arrival in London that I was invited to lunch\r\nat Hepworth Dixon's to meet Lord Lytton, or Bulwer, the great writer.  His\r\nworks had been so intensely and sympathetically loved by me so long, that\r\nit seemed as if I had been asked to meet some great man of the past.  I\r\nfound him, as I expected, quite congenial and wondrous kind.  I remember\r\na droll incident.  Standing at the head of the stairs, he courteously\r\nmade way and asked me to go before.  I replied, \"When Louis XIV. asked\r\nCrillon to do the same, Crillon complied, saying, 'Wherever your Majesty\r\ngoes, be it before or behind, is always the first place or post of\r\nhonour,' and I say the same with him,\" and so went in advance at once.  I\r\nsaw by his expression that he was pleased with the quotation.\r\n\r\nWe were looking at a portrait of Shakespeare which Dixon had found in\r\nRussia.  Lord Lytton asked me if I thought it an original or true\r\nlikeness.  I observed that the face was full of many fine seamy lines,\r\nwhich infallibly indicate great nervous genius of the highest\r\norder--noting at the same time that Lord Lytton's countenance was very\r\nmuch marked in a like manner.  The observation was new to him, and he\r\nseemed to be interested in it, as he always was in anything like\r\nchiromancy or metoscopy.  A few days later I was invited to come and pass\r\nnearly a week with Hepworth Dixon at Knebworth, Lord Lytton's country\r\nseat.  It is a very picturesque _chateau_, profusely adorned with\r\nfifteenth-century Gothic grotesques, with a fine antique hall, stained\r\nglass windows, and gallery.  There is in it a chamber containing a\r\nmarvellous and massive carved oak bedstead, the posts of which are human\r\nfigures the size of life, and in it and in the same room Queen Elizabeth\r\nis said to have slept when she heard of the destruction of the Spanish\r\nArmada.  It was the room of honour, and it had been kindly assigned to\r\nme.  It all seemed like a dream.\r\n\r\nThere was in the family of the late Lord Lytton his son, who made a most\r\nfavourable impression on me.  I think the first _coup_ was my finding\r\nthat he knew the works of Andreini, and that it had occurred to him as\r\nwell as to me that Euphues Lily's book had been modelled on them.  There\r\nwas also his wife, a magnificent and graceful beauty; Lord Lytton's\r\nnephew, Mr. Bulwer; and several ladies.  The first morning we all fished\r\nin the pond, and, to my great amazement, Lord Lytton pulled out _a great\r\none-eyed perch_!  I almost expected to see him pull out Paul Clifford or\r\nZanoni next!  In the afternoon we were driven out to Cowper Castle to see\r\na fine gallery of pictures, our host acting as cicerone, and as he soon\r\nfound that I was fairly well educated in art, and had been a special\r\npupil of Thiersch in Munich, and something more than an amateur, we had\r\nmany interesting conversations.  I think I may venture to say that he did\r\n_not_ expect to find a whilom student of aesthetics, art-history, and\r\nPhilosophy in the author of \"Hans Breitmann.\"  What was delightful was\r\nhis exquisite tact in never saying as much; but I could detect it in the\r\nsudden interest and involuntary compliment implied in his tone of\r\nconversation.  In a very short time he began to speak to me on all\r\nliterary or artistic subjects without preliminary question, taking it for\r\ngranted that I understood them and chimed in with him.  I was with every\r\ninterview more and more impressed with his _culture_--I mean with what\r\nhad resulted from his reading--his marvellous tact of kindness in small\r\nthings to all, and his quick and vigorous comparing and contrasting of\r\nimages and drawing conclusions.  But there was evidently enough a firm\r\nbed-rock or hard pan under all this gold.  I was amazed one day when a\r\nfootman, who had committed some _bevue_ or blunder, or apprehended\r\nsomething, actually turned pale and stammered with terror when Lord\r\nLytton gravely addressed a question to him.  I never in my life saw a man\r\nso much frightened, even before a revolver.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Lytton was beyond all question really interested when he found\r\nme so much at home in Rosicrucian and occult lore, and that I had been\r\nwith Justinus Kerner in Weinsberg, and was familiar with the forgotten\r\ndusky paths of mysticism.  He had in his house the famous Earl Stanhope\r\ncrystal, and wished me to sleep with it under my pillow, but I was so\r\nafraid lest the precious relic should be injured, that I resolutely\r\ndeclined the honour, for which I am now sorry, for I sometimes have\r\ndreams of a most extraordinary character.  This Stanhope crystal is not,\r\nhowever, the great mirror of Dr. Dee, though it has been said to be so.\r\nThe latter belonged to a gentleman in London, who also offered to lend it\r\nto me.  It is made of cannel coal.  That Lord Lytton made a very\r\nremarkable impression on me is proved by the fact that I continued to\r\ndream of him at long intervals after his death; and I am quite sure that\r\nsuch feeling is, by its very nature, always to a certain slight degree\r\nreciprocal.  He had a natural and unaffected _voice_, yet one with a\r\nmarked character; something like Tennyson's, which was even more\r\nstriking.  Both were far removed from the now fashionable intonation,\r\nwhich is the admiration and despair of American swells.  It is only the\r\n_fin de siecle_ form of the _demnition_ dialect of the Forties and the\r\n_La-ard_ and _Lunnon_ of an earlier age.\r\n\r\nLord Lytton was generally invisible in the morning, sometimes after\r\nlunch.  In the evening he came out splendidly groomed, fresh as a rose,\r\nand at dinner and after was as interesting as any of his books.  He had\r\nknown \"everybody\" to a surprising extent, and had anecdotes fresh and\r\nvivid of every one whom he had met.  He loved music, and there was a lady\r\nwho sang old Spanish ballads with rare taste.  I enjoyed myself\r\nincredibly.\r\n\r\nI may be excused for mentioning here that I sent a copy of the second\r\nedition of my \"Meister Karl's Sketch-Book\" to Lord Lytton.  No one but\r\nIrving and Trubner had ever praised it.  When Lord Lytton published\r\nafterwards \"Kenelm Chillingly,\" I found in it _three_ passages in which I\r\nrecognised beyond dispute others suggested by my own work.  I do not in\r\nthe least mean that there was _any_ borrowing or taking beyond the mere\r\nsuggestion of thought.  Why I think that Lord Lytton had these hints in\r\nhis mind is that he gave the name of Leland to one of the minor\r\ncharacters in the book.\r\n\r\nWhen I published a full edition of \"Breitmann's Poems,\" he wrote me a\r\nlong letter criticising and praising the work, and a much longer and\r\nclosely written one, of seven pages, relating to my \"Confucius and Other\r\nPoems.\"  I was subsequently invited to receptions at his house in London,\r\nwhere I first met Browning, and had a long conversation with him.  I saw\r\nhim afterwards at Mrs. Proctor's.  This was the wife of Barry Cornwall,\r\nwhom I also saw.  He was very old and infirm.  I can remember when the\r\n\"Cornlaw Rhymes\" rang wherever English was read.\r\n\r\nAs I consider it almost a duty to record what I can remember of Bulwer, I\r\nmay mention that one evening, at his house in London, he showed me and\r\nothers some beautiful old brass salvers in _repousse_ work, and how I\r\nastonished him by describing the process, and declaring that I could\r\nproduce a _facsimile_ of any one of them in a day or two; to which\r\nassertion hundreds to whom I have taught the art, as well as my \"Manual\r\nof Repousse,\" and another on \"Metal Work,\" will, I trust, bear witness.\r\nAnd this I mention, not vainly, but because Lord Lytton seemed to be\r\ninterested and pleased, and because, in after years, I had much to do\r\nwith reviving the practice of this beautiful art.  It was practising\r\nthis, and a three years' study of oak-wood carving, which led me to write\r\non the Minor Arts.  _Mihi aes et triplex robur_.\r\n\r\nLord Lytton had the very curious habit of making almost invisible\r\nhieroglyphics or crosses in his letters--at least I found them in those\r\nto me, as it were for luck.  It was a very common practice from the most\r\nancient Egyptian times to within two centuries.  Lord Lytton's were\r\nevidently intended to escape observation.  But there was indeed a great\r\ndeal in his character which would escape most persons, and which has not\r\nbeen revealed by any writer on him.  This I speedily divined, though, of\r\ncourse, I never discovered what it all was.\r\n\r\nLord Houghton, \"Richard Monckton Milnes,\" to whom I had a letter of\r\nintroduction from Lorimer Graham, was very kind to me.  I dined and\r\nlunched at his house, where I met Odo Russell or Lord Ampthill, the Duke\r\nof Bedford, the Hon. Mrs. Norton, W. W. Story, and I know not how many\r\nmore distinguished in society, or letters.  At Lord Lytton's I made the\r\nacquaintance of the Duke of Wellington.  I believe, however, that this\r\nmeeting with Lord Houghton and the Duke was in my second year in London.\r\n\r\nThe first English garden-party which I ever attended was during this\r\nfirst season, at the villa of Mr. Bohn, the publisher, at Twickenham.\r\nThere I made the acquaintance of George Cruikshank, whom I afterwards met\r\noften, and knew very well till his death.  He was a gay old fellow, and\r\non this occasion danced a jig with old Mr. Bohn on the lawn, and joked\r\nwith me.  There, too, we met Lady Martin, who had been the famed Helen\r\nFaucit.  Cruikshank was always inexhaustible in jokes, anecdotes, and\r\nreminiscences.  At his house I made the acquaintance of Miss Ada\r\nCavendish.\r\n\r\nTo revert to Mr. Trubner's, I may say that one evening after dinner,\r\nwhen, genial though quiet, Bret Harte was one of the guests, he was asked\r\nto repeat the \"Heathen Chinee,\" which he could not do, as he had never\r\nlearned it--which is not such an unusual thing, by the way, as many\r\nsuppose.  But I, who knew it, remarked, \"Ladies and gentlemen, it is\r\nnothing to merely _write_ a poem.  True genius consists in getting it by\r\nor from heart [_from_ Bret Harte, for instance], and repeating it.  This\r\ngenius nature has denied to the illustrious poet before you--but not to\r\nme, as I will now illustrate by declaiming the 'Heathen Chinee.'\"  Which\r\nperformance was received with applause, in which Harte heartily joined.\r\nBut my claim to possess genius would hardly have borne examination, for\r\nit was years before I ever learned \"Hans Breitmann's Barty,\" nor would I\r\nlike to risk even a pound to one hundred that I can do it now without\r\nmixing the verses or committing some error.\r\n\r\nOnce during the season I went with my wife and Mr. W. W. Story to Eton,\r\nwhere we supped with Oscar Browning.  We were taken out boating on the\r\nriver, and I enjoyed it very much.  There is a romance about the Thames\r\nassociated with a thousand passages in literature which goes to the very\r\nheart.  I was much impressed by the marked character of Mr. Browning and\r\nhis frank, genial nature; and I found some delightful old Latin books in\r\nhis library.  May I meet with many such men!\r\n\r\nThis year, what with the German war and the Trubner-Hotten controversy,\r\nmy \"Breitmann Ballads\" had become, I may say, well known.  The character\r\nof Hans was actually brought into plays on three stages at once.\r\nBoucicault, whom I knew well of yore in America, introduced it into\r\nsomething.  I had found Ewan Colquhoun--the same old sixpence--and one\r\nnight he took me to the Strand Theatre to see a play in which my hero was\r\na prominent part.  I was told afterwards that the company having been\r\ninformed of my presence, all came to look at me through the curtain-hole.\r\nThere were some imitations of my ballads published in _Punch_ and the\r\n_Standard_, and the latter were so admirably executed--pardon the vain\r\nword!--that I feared, because they satirised the German cause, that they\r\nmight be credited to me; therefore I wrote to the journal, begging that\r\nthe author would give some indication that I had not written them, which\r\nwas kindly done.  Finally, a newspaper was started called _Hans\r\nBreitmann_, and the Messrs. Cope, of Liverpool, issued a brand of Hans\r\nBreitmann cigars.  Owing to the resemblance between the words Bret and\r\nBreit there was a confusion of names, and my photograph was to be seen\r\nabout town, with the name of Bret Harte attached to it.  This great\r\ninjustice to Mr. Harte was not agreeable, and I, or my friends,\r\nremonstrated with the shop-folk with the to-be-expected result, \"Yes-sir,\r\nyes-sir--very sorry, sir--we'll correct the mistake, sir!\"  But I don't\r\nthink it was ever corrected till the sale ceased.\r\n\r\nI was sometimes annoyed with many imitations of my poems by persons who\r\nknew no German, which were all attributed to me.  A very pious\r\nPresbyterian publication, in alluding to something of the kind, said that\r\n\"Mr. Leland, _because he is the author of Bret Harte_, thinks himself\r\njustified in publishing any trash of this description.\"  I thought this a\r\n_very_ improper allusion for a clergyman, not to say libellous.  In fact,\r\nmany people really believed that Bret Harte was a _nom de plume_ or the\r\ntitle of a poem.  And I may here say by the way that I never \"wrote\r\nunder\" the pseudonym of Hans Breitmann in my life, nor called myself any\r\nsuch name at any time.  It is simply the name of one of many _books_\r\nwhich I have written.  An American once insisting to me that I _should_\r\nbe called so from my work, I asked him if he would familiarly accost Mr.\r\nLowell as \"Josh Biglow.\"  If there is anything in the world which denotes\r\na subordinate position in the social scale or defect in education, it is\r\nthe passion to call men \"out of their names,\" and never feel really\r\nacquainted with any one until he is termed Tom or Jack.  It is doubtless\r\nall very genial and jocose and sociable, but the man who shows a tendency\r\nto it should _not_ complain when his betters put him in a lower class or\r\namong the \"lower orders.\"\r\n\r\nOnce at a reception at George Boughton's, the artist, there was, as I\r\nheard, an elderly gentleman rushing about asking to see or be introduced\r\nto _Hart Bretmann_, whose works he declared he knew by heart, and with\r\nwhom he was most anxious to become acquainted.  Whether he ever\r\ndiscovered this remarkable conglomerate I do not know.\r\n\r\nI once made the acquaintance of an American at the Langham Hotel who\r\ndeclared that I had made life a burden to him.  His name was H.\r\nBrightman, and being in business in New York, he never went to the Custom-\r\nHouse or Post-Office but what the clerks cried \"Hans Brightman! of\r\ncourse.  Yes, we have read about you, sir--in history.\"\r\n\r\nBut even in this London season I found more serious work to attend to\r\nthan comic ballads or society.  Mr. Trubner was very anxious to have me\r\nwrite a pamphlet vindicating the claim of Germany to Alsace and Lorraine,\r\nand I offered to do it gladly, if he would provide all the historical\r\ndata or material.  The result of this was the _brochure_ entitled\r\n\"France, Alsace, and Lorraine,\" which had a great success.  It at once\r\nreappeared in America, and even in Spanish in South America.  The German\r\nMinister in London ordered six copies, and the _Times_ made the work,\r\nwith all its facts and figures, into an editorial article, omitting, I\r\nregret to say, to mention the source whence it was derived; but this I\r\nforgive with all my heart, considering the good words which it has given\r\nme on other occasions.  For the object of the work was not at all to\r\nglorify the author, but to send home great truths at a very critical\r\ntime; and the article in the _Times_, which was little else but my\r\npamphlet condensed, caused a great sensation.  But the principal result\r\nfrom it was this: I had in the work discussed the idea, then urged by the\r\nFrench and their friends, that, to avoid driving France to \"desperation,\"\r\nvery moderate terms should be accepted in order to conciliate.  For the\r\nFrench, as I observed in effect, will do their _very worst in any case_,\r\nand every possible extreme should be anticipated and assumed.  This same\r\nargument had previously been urged in my \"Centralisation _versus_ States\r\nRights.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Bismarck conversed with the French Commissioners to arrange\r\nterms of peace, he met this argument of not driving the French to\r\nextremes with a phrase so closely like the one which I had used in my\r\npamphlet, that neither Mr. Trubner nor several others hesitated to\r\ndeclare to me that it was beyond all question taken from it.  Bismarck\r\nhad _certainly_ received the pamphlet, which had been recognised by the\r\n_Times_, and in many other quarters, as a more than ordinary paper, and\r\nPrince Bismarck, like all great diplomatists, _prend son bien ou il le\r\ntrouve_.  In any case this remains true, that that which formed the\r\nsettling argument of Germany, found at the time expression in my pamphlet\r\nand in the Chancellor's speech.\r\n\r\nWe made soon after a visit to the Rev. Dean and Mrs. Carrington, in\r\nBocking, Essex.  They had a fair daughter, Eva, then quite a girl, who\r\nhas since become well known as a writer, and is now the Countess\r\nCesaresco Martinengro--an Italian name, and not Romany-Gypsy, as its\r\nterminations would seem to indicate.  There is in the village of Bocking,\r\nat a corner, a curious and very large grotesque figure of oak, which was\r\nevidently in the time of Elizabeth a pilaster in some house-front.  My\r\nfriend Edwards, who was wont to roam all over England in a mule-waggon\r\netching and sketching, when in Bocking was informed by a rustic that this\r\nfigure was the image of Harkiles (Hercules), a heathen god formerly\r\nworshipped in the old Catholic convent upon the hill, in the old times!\r\n\r\nFrom London we went in August, 1870, to Brighton, staying at first at the\r\nAlbion Hotel.  There, under the influence of fresh sea-air, long walks\r\nand drives in all the country round, I began to feel better, yet it was\r\nnot for many weeks that I fairly recovered.  A chemist named Phillips,\r\nwho supplied me with bromide of potass, suggested to me, to his own loss,\r\nthat I took a great deal too much.  I left it off altogether,\r\nsubstituting pale ale.  Finding this far better, I asked Mr. Phillips if\r\nhe could not prepare for me _lupulin_, or the anodyne of hops.  He\r\nlaughed, and said, \"Do you find the result required in ale?\"  I answered,\r\n\"Yes.\"  \"And do you like ale?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then,\" he answered, \"why don't\r\nyou _drink_ ale?\"  And I did, but before I took it up my very vitality\r\nseemed to be well-nigh exhausted with the bromide.\r\n\r\nSamuel Laing, M.P., the chairman of the Brighton Railway, had at that\r\ntime a house in Brighton, with several sons and daughters, the latter of\r\nwhom have all been very remarkable for beauty and accomplishments.  In\r\nthis home there was a hospitality so profuse, so kind, so brilliant and\r\nrefined, that I cannot really remember to have ever seen it equalled, and\r\nas we fully participated in it at all times in every form, I should feel\r\nthat I had omitted the deepest claim to my gratitude if I did not here\r\nacknowledge it.  Mr. Laing was or is of a stock which deeply appealed to\r\nmy sympathies, for he is the son of the famous translator of the\r\n_Heimskringla_, a great collection of Norse sagas, which I had read, and\r\nin which he himself somewhat aided.  Of late years, since he has retired\r\nfrom more active financial business, Mr. Laing has not merely turned his\r\nattention to literature; he has deservedly distinguished himself by\r\ntranslating, as I may say, into the clearest and most condensed or\r\nsuccinct and lucid English ever written, so as to be understood by the\r\nhumblest mind, the doctrines of Darwin, Huxley, and the other leading\r\nscientific minds of the day.  Heine in his time received a great deal of\r\ncredit for having thus acted as the flux and furnace by which the ore of\r\nGerman philosophy was smelted into pure gold for general circulation; but\r\nI, who have translated all that Heine wrote on this subject, declare that\r\nhe was at such work as far inferior to Samuel Laing as a mere verbal\r\ndescription of a beautiful face is inferior to a first-class portrait.\r\nThis family enters so largely into my reminiscences and experiences, that\r\na chapter would hardly suffice to express all that I can recall of their\r\nhospitality for years, of the dinners, hunts, balls, excursions, and the\r\nmany distinguished people whom I have met under their roof.  It is worth\r\nnoting of Mr. Laing's daughters, that Mary, now Mrs. Kennard, is at the\r\nhead of the sporting-novel writers; that the beautiful Cecilia, now Mrs.\r\nMacRae, was pronounced by G. H. Lewes, who was no mean judge, to be the\r\nfirst amateur pianiste in England; while the charming \"Floy,\" or Mrs.\r\nKennedy, is a very able painter.  With their two very pretty sisters,\r\nthey formed in 1870 as brilliant, beautiful, and accomplished a quintette\r\nas England could have produced.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Laing organised an excursion with a special train to Arundel\r\nCastle.  By myself at other times I found my way to Lewes and other\r\nplaces rich in legendary lore.  Of this latter I recall something worth\r\ntelling.  Harold, the conquered Saxon king, had a son, and the conqueror\r\nWilliam had a daughter, Gundrada.  The former became a Viking pirate, and\r\nin his old age a monk, and was buried in a church, now a Presbyterian\r\nchapel.  There his epitaph may be read in fine bold lettering, still\r\ndistinct.  That man is dear to me.\r\n\r\nGundrada married, died, and was buried in a church with a fine Norman\r\ntombstone over her remains.  The church was levelled with the ground, but\r\nthe slab was preserved here and there about Lewes as a relic.  When the\r\nrailway was built, about 1849, there was discovered, where the church had\r\nbeen, the bones of Gundrada and her husband in leaden coffins distinctly\r\ninscribed with their names.  A very beautiful Norman chapel was then\r\nbuilt to receive the coffins, and over them is placed the original\r\nmemorial in black marble.  There is also in Lewes an archaeological\r\nmuseum appropriately bestowed in an old Gothic tower.  All of which\r\nthings did greatly solace me.  As did also the Norman or Gothic churches\r\nof Shoreham, Newport, the old manor of Rottingdean, and the marvellous\r\nDevil's Dyke, which was probably a Roman fort, and from which it is said\r\nthat fifty towns or villages may be seen \"far in the blue.\"\r\n\r\nOne day I went with my wife and two ladies to visit the latter.  The\r\nliving curiosity of the place was a famous old gypsy woman named Gentilla\r\nCooper, a pure blood or real _Kalorat_ Romany.  I had already in America\r\nstudied Pott's \"Thesaurus of Gypsy Dialects,\" and picked up many phrases\r\nof the tongue from the works of Borrow, Simson, and others.  The old dame\r\ntackled us at once.  As soon as I could, I whispered in her ear an\r\nimprovised rhyme:--\r\n\r\n      \"The bashno and kani,\r\n      The rye and the rani,\r\n   Hav'd akai 'pre o boro lon pani.\"\r\n\r\nWhich means that the cock and the hen, the gentleman and the lady, came\r\nhither across the great salt water.  The effect on the gypsy was\r\nstartling; she fairly turned pale.  Hustling the ladies away to one side\r\nto see a beautiful view, she got me alone and hurriedly exclaimed,\r\n\"_Rya_--master! _be_ you one of our people?\" with much more.  We became\r\nvery good friends, and this little incident had in time for me great\r\nresults, and many strange experiences of gypsy life.\r\n\r\nThere live in Brighton two ladies, Miss Horace Smith and her sister Rosa,\r\nwho were and are well known in the cultured world.  They are daughters of\r\nHorace Smith, who, with his brother James, wrote the \"Rejected\r\nAddresses.\"  Their reminiscences of distinguished men are extremely\r\nvaried and interesting.  The elder sister possesses an album to which\r\nThackeray contributed many verses and pen-sketches.  Their weekly\r\nreceptions were very pleasant; at them might be seen most of the literary\r\nor social celebrities who came to Brighton.  A visit there was like\r\nliving a chapter in a book of memoirs and reminiscences.  I have had, if\r\nit be only a quiet, and not very eventful or remarkable, at least a\r\nsomewhat varied life, and the Laings and Smiths, with their surroundings,\r\nform two of its most interesting varieties.  I believe they never missed\r\nan opportunity to do us or any one a kindly act, to aid us to make\r\ncongenial friends, or the like.  How many good people there really are in\r\nthe world!\r\n\r\nOf these ladies the author of \"Gossip of the Century\" writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"Horace Smith's two daughters are still living, and in Brighton.  Their\r\n   very pleasant house is frequented by the best and most interesting\r\n   kind of society, affording what may be called a _salon_, that rare\r\n   relic of ancient literary taste and cementer of literary intimacies--a\r\n   salon which the cultivated consider it a privilege to frequent, and\r\n   where these ladies receive with a grace and geniality which their\r\n   friends know how to appreciate.  It is much to be regretted that\r\n   gatherings of this description seem to be becoming rarer every year,\r\n   for as death disturbs them society seems to lack the spirit or the\r\n   good taste, or the ability, to replace them.\"\r\n\r\nBrighton is a very pleasant place, because it combines the advantages of\r\na seaside resort with those of a clean and cheerful city.  Walking along\r\nthe front, you have a brave outlook to the blue sea on one hand, and\r\nelegant shop-windows and fine hotels on the other.  A little back in the\r\ntown on a hill is the fine old fifteenth-century church of St. Nicholas,\r\nin which there is perhaps the most curious carved Norman font in England;\r\nbut all this is known to so few visitors, that I feel as if I were\r\ntelling a great secret in letting it out.  Smith's book-store on the\r\nWestern Road, and Bohn's near the station, are kept by very well-informed\r\nand very courteous men.  I have been much indebted to the former in many\r\nways, and found by his aid many a greatly needed and rare work.\r\n\r\nWhen I first went to Brighton there was one evening a brilliant aurora\r\nborealis.  As I looked at it, I heard an Englishman say, to my great\r\namazement, it was the first time he had ever seen one in his life!  I\r\nonce saw one in America of such extraordinary brilliancy and duration,\r\nthat it prolonged the daylight for half an hour or more, till I became\r\namazed, and then found it was a Northern Light.  It lasted till sunrise\r\nin all its splendour.  I have taken down from Algonkin Indians several\r\nbeautiful legends relating to them.  In one, the Milky Way is the girdle\r\nof a stupendous deity, and the Northern Lights the splendid gleams\r\nemitted by his ball when playing.  In another, the narrator describes him\r\nas clad in an ineffable glory of light, and in colours unknown on earth!\r\n\r\nAnd this reminds me further that I have just read in the newspapers of\r\nthe death of Edwin Booth, who was born during the famous star shower of\r\n1833, which phenomenon I witnessed from beginning to end, and remember as\r\nif it were only yesterday.  Now, I was actually dreaming that I was in a\r\nroom in which _cigars_ were flying about in every direction, when my\r\nfather came and woke me and my brother Henry, to come and see an\r\nexceeding great marvel.  There were for a long time many thousands of\r\nstars at once in the sky, all shooting, as it were, or converging towards\r\na centre.  They were not half so long as the meteors which we see; one or\r\ntwo had a crook or bend in the middle, _e.g._\r\n\r\n{The meteor pattern: p409.jpg}\r\n\r\nThe next day I was almost alone at school in the glory of having seen it,\r\nfor so few people were awake in sober Philadelphia at three in the\r\nmorning that one of the newspapers ridiculed the whole story.\r\n\r\nI can distinctly recall that the next day, at Mr. Alcott's, I read\r\nthrough a very favourite work of mine, a translation of the German _Das\r\nMahrchen ohne Ende_--\"The Story without an End.\"\r\n\r\nAll kinds of odd fish came to Brighton, floating here and there; but two\r\nof the very oddest were encountered by me in it on my last visit.  I was\r\nlooking into a chemist's window, when two well-dressed and decidedly\r\njolly feminines, one perhaps of thirty years, and the other much younger\r\nand quite pretty, paused by me, while the elder asked--\r\n\r\n\"Are you looking for a hair-restorer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not, though I fear I need one much more than you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"The search for a good hair-restorer,\" she replied in Italian, \"is as\r\nvain as the search for happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" I answered in the same tongue, \"and unless you have the happiness\r\nin you, or a beautiful head of hair like yours already growing on you,\r\nyou will find neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"What we _forget_,\" added the younger in Spanish, \"is the best part of\r\nour happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Senorita_, _parece que no ha olvidado su Espanol_--The young lady\r\nappears not to have forgotten her Spanish--I replied.  (Mine is not very\r\ngood.)\r\n\r\n\"There is no use asking whether _you_ talk French,\" said the elder.\r\n\"_Konnen Sie auch Deutsch sprechen_?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ja wohl_!  Even worse than German itself,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nJust then there came up to us a gypsy girl whom I knew, with a basket of\r\nflowers, and asked me in Gypsy to buy some; but I said, \"_Parraco pen_,\r\n_ja vri_, _mandy kams kek ruzhia kedivvus_\"--Thank you, sister, no\r\nflowers to-day--and she darted away.\r\n\r\n\"Did you understand _that_?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No; what was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Gitano_--gypsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how in Heaven's name,\" cried the girl, \"could she _know_ that _you_\r\nspoke Gitano?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am,\" I replied slowly and grimly, \"the chief of all the\r\ngypsies in England, the _boro Romany rye_ and President of the Gypsy\r\nSociety.  Subscription one pound per annum, which entitles you to receive\r\nthe journal for one year, and includes postage.  Behold in me the gypsy\r\nking, whom all know and fear!  I shall be happy to put your names down as\r\nsubscribers.\"\r\n\r\nAt this appalling announcement, which sounded like an extract from a\r\npenny dreadful, my two romantic friends looked absolutely bewildered.\r\nThey seemed as if they had read in novels how mysterious gypsy chiefs\r\ncast aside their cloaks, revealing themselves to astonished maidens, and\r\nas I had actually spoken Gitano to a gypsy in their hearing, it must be\r\nso.  They had come for wool with all their languages, poor little souls!\r\nand gone back shorn.  The elder said something about their having just\r\ncome to Brighton for six hours' frolic, and so they departed.  They had\r\nhad their spree.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered what under the sun they could have been.  Attaches\r\nof an opera company--ladies'-maids who had made the grand tour--who\r\nknows?  A mad world, my masters!\r\n\r\nI can recall of that first year, as of many since at Brighton, long\r\nbreezy walks on the brow of the chalk cliffs, looking out at the blue sea\r\nwhite capped, or at the downs rolling inland to Newport, sometimes alone,\r\nat times in company.  On all this chalk the grass does not grow to more\r\nthan an inch or so in length, and as the shortest, tenderest food is best\r\nfor sheep, it is on this that they thrive--I believe by millions--yielding\r\nthe famous South Downs mutton.  In or on this grass are incredible\r\nnumbers of minute snails, which the sheep are said to devour; in fact, I\r\ndo not see how they could eat the grass without taking them in, and these\r\ncontribute to give the mutton its delicate flavour.  Snails are curious\r\nbeings.  Being epicene, they conduct their wooings on the mutual give and\r\ntake principle, which would save human beings a great deal of spasmodic\r\nflirtation, and abolish the whole _femme incomprise_ business, besides a\r\ngreat many bad novels, if we could adopt it.  When winter comes, half-a-\r\ndozen of them retire into a hole in a bank, connect themselves firmly\r\ninto a loving band like a bunch of grapes by the tenderest ties, and stay\r\nthere till spring.  Finally, in folk-lore the snail is an uncanny or\r\ndemoniac being, because it has horns.  Its shell is an amulet, and the\r\npresentation of one by a lady to a gentleman is a very decided\r\ndeclaration of love, especially in Germany.  _Sed mittamus haec_.\r\n\r\nAt this time, and for some time to come, I was engaged in collecting and\r\ncorrecting a book of poems of a more serious character than the\r\n\"Breitmann Ballads.\"  This was \"The Music Lesson of Confucius and other\r\nPoems.\"  Of which book I can say truly that it had a _succes d'estime_,\r\nthough it had a very small sale.  There were in it ten or twelve ballads\r\nonly which were adapted to singing, and _all_ of these were set to music\r\nby Carlo Pinsutti, Virginia Gabriel, or others.  There was in it a poem\r\nentitled \"On Mount Meru.\"  In this the Creator is supposed to show the\r\nworld when it was first made to Satan.  The adversary finds that all is\r\nfit and well, save \"the being called Man,\" who seems to him to be the\r\nworst and most incongruous.  To which the Demiurgus replies that Man will\r\nin the end conquer all things, even the devil himself.  And at the last\r\nthe demon lies dying at the feet of God, and confesses that \"Man, thy\r\ncreature hath vanquished me for ever--_Vicisti Galilaee_!\"  Some years\r\nafter I read a work by a French writer in which this same idea of God and\r\nthe devil is curiously carried out and illustrated by the history of\r\narchitecture.  And as in the case of the letter from Lord Lytton Bulwer,\r\nwarm praise from other persons of high rank in the literary world and\r\nreviews, I had many proofs that these poems had made a favourable\r\nimpression.  The only exception which I can recall was a very sarcastic\r\nreview in the _Athenaeum_, in which the writer declared his belief that\r\nthe poems or Legends of Perfumes in the book were originally written as\r\nadvertisements of some barber or tradesman, and being by him rejected as\r\nworthless, had been thrown back on my hands!  Other works by me it\r\ntreated kindly--so it goes in this world--like a recipe for a cement\r\nwhich I have just copied into my great work on \"Mending and Repairing\"--in\r\nwhich vinegar is combined with sugar.\r\n\r\nWhile at Brighton we met Louis Blanc, whom we had previously seen several\r\ntimes at the Trubners', in London.  In Brighton he heard the news of the\r\noverthrow of the Empire and departed for Paris.  At Christmas we went to\r\nLondon to visit the Trubners, and thence to the Langham Hotel, where we\r\nremained till July.  I recall very little of what I witnessed or did\r\nbeyond seeing the Queen prorogue Parliament and translating Scheffel's\r\n_Gaudeamus_, a little volume of German humorous poems.  Scheffel, as I\r\nhave before written, was an old _Mitkneipant_, or evening-beer companion\r\nof mine in Heidelberg.\r\n\r\nIn July we made up a travelling party with Mrs. S. Laing and her\r\ndaughters Cecilia and Floy, and departed for a visit to the Rhine--that\r\nis to say, these ladies preceded us, and we joined them at the Hotel des\r\nQuatre Saisons in Homburg.  It was a very brilliant season, for the\r\nGerman Emperor, fresh with the glory of his great victory, was being\r\n_feted_ everywhere, and Homburg the brilliant was not behind the German\r\nworld in this respect.  I saw the great man frequently, near and far, and\r\nwas much impressed with his appearance.  _Punch_ had not long before\r\nrepresented him as Hans Breitmann in a cartoon, deploring that he had not\r\nsqueezed more milliards out of the French, and I indeed found in the\r\noriginal very closely my ideal of Hans, who always occurs to me as a\r\nGerman gentleman, who drinks, fights, and plunders, not as a mere rowdy,\r\nraised above his natural sphere, but as a rough cavalier.  And that the\r\ngreat-bearded giant Emperor Wilhelm did drink heavily, fight hard, and\r\nmulct France mightily, is matter of history.  This was the last year of\r\nthe gaming-tables at Homburg.  Apropos of these, the roulette-table was\r\nplaced in the Homburg Museum, where it may be seen amid many Roman\r\nrelics.  Two or three years ago, while I was in the room, there came in a\r\nsmall party of English or Yankee looking or gazing tourists, to whom the\r\nattendant pointed out the roulette-table.  \"And did the old Romans really\r\nplay at roulette, and was _that_ one of their tables?\" said the leader of\r\nthe visitors.  This ready simple faith indicates the Englishman.  The\r\nordinary American is always possessed with the conviction that everything\r\nantique is a forgery.  Once when I was examining the old Viking armour in\r\nthe Museum of Copenhagen, a Yankee, in whose face a general vulgar\r\ndistrust of all earthly things was strongly marked, came up to me and\r\nasked, \"Do you believe that all these curiosities air _genooine_?\"  \"I\r\ncertainly do,\" I replied.  With an intensely self-satisfied air he\r\nrejoined, \"I guess you can't fool _me_ with no such humbug.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of cholera that year in Germany, and I had a very\r\nsevere attack of it either in an incipient form or something thereunto\r\nallied: suffice it to say that for twelve hours I almost thought I should\r\ndie of pure pain.  I took in vain laudanum, cayenne pepper, brandy,\r\ncamphor, and kino--nothing would remain.  At last, at midnight, when I\r\nwas beginning to despair, or just as I felt like being wrecked, I\r\nsucceeded in keeping a little weak laudanum and water on my stomach, and\r\nthen the point was cleared.  After that I took the other remedies, and\r\nwas soon well.  But it was a crisis of such fearful suffering that it all\r\nremains vividly impressed on my memory.  I do not know whether any\r\nsensible book has ever been written on the moral influence of pain, but\r\nit is certain that a wonderful one might be.  So far as I can understand\r\nit, I think that in the vast majority of cases it is an evil, or one of\r\nNature's innumerable mistakes or divagations, not as yet outgrown or\r\ncorrected; and it is the great error of Buddhistic-Christianity that it\r\n_accepts_ pain not merely as inevitable, but glorifies and increases it,\r\ninstead of making every conceivable exertion to _diminish_ it.  Herein\r\nclearly lies the difference between Science and Religion.  Science\r\nstrives in every way to alleviate pain and suffering; erroneous\r\n\"Religion\" is based on it.  During the Middle Ages, the Church did all in\r\nits power to hinder, if not destroy, the healing art.  It made anatomy of\r\nthe human body a crime, and carried its precautions so far that, quite\r\ntill the Reformation, the art of healing (as Paracelsus declares) was\r\nchiefly in the hands of witches and public executioners.  _Torturers_,\r\nchiefly clergymen such as Grillandus, were in great honour, while the\r\nhealing leech was disreputable.  It was not, as people say, \"the age\"\r\nwhich caused all this--it was the result of religion based on crucifixion\r\nand martyrdoms and pain--in fact, on that element of _torture_ which we\r\nare elsewhere taught, most inconsistently, is the special province of the\r\ndevil in hell.  The _cant_ of this still survives in Longfellow's \"Suffer\r\nand be strong,\" and in the pious praise of endurance of pain.  What the\r\nworld wants is the hope held out to it, or enforced on it as a religion\r\nor conviction, that pain and suffering are to be diminished, and that our\r\nchief duty should consist in diminishing them, instead of always praising\r\nor worshipping them as a cross!\r\n\r\nWe left our friends and went for a short time to Switzerland, where we\r\nvisited Lucerne, Interlaken, Basle, and Berne.  Thence we returned to\r\nLondon and the Langham Hotel.  This was at that time under the management\r\nof Mr. John Sanderson, an American, whom I had known of old.  He was a\r\nbrother of Professor Sanderson, of Philadelphia, who wrote a remarkably\r\nclever work entitled _The American in Paris_.  John Sanderson himself had\r\ncontributed many articles to Appletons' _Cyclopaedia_, belonged to the\r\nNew York Century Club, and, like all the members of his family, had\r\nculture in music and literary taste.  While he managed the Langham it was\r\ncrowded during all the year, as indeed any decent hotel almost anywhere\r\nmay be by simple proper liberal management.  This is a subject which I\r\nhave studied _au fond_, having read _Das Hotel wesen der Gegenwart_, a\r\nvery remarkable work, and passed more than twenty years of my life in\r\nhotels in all countries.\r\n\r\nI can remember that during the first year of my residence in England I\r\ntried to persuade a chemist to import from South America the _coca_ leaf,\r\nof which not an ounce was then consumed in Europe.  Weston the walker\r\nbrought it into fashion \"later on.\"  I had heard extraordinary and\r\nauthentic accounts of its enabling Indian messengers to run all day from\r\na friend who had employed them.  Apropos of this, \"I do recall a wondrous\r\npleasant tale.\"  My cousin, Godfrey Davenport, a son of the Uncle Seth\r\nmentioned in my earlier life, owned what was regarded as the model\r\nplantation of Louisiana.  My brother Henry visited him one winter, and\r\nwhile there was kindly treated by a very genial, hospitable neighbouring\r\nplanter, whom I afterwards met at my father's house in Philadelphia.  He\r\nwas a good-looking, finely-formed man, lithe and active as a panther--the\r\n_replica_ of Albert Pike's \"fine Arkansas gentleman.\"  And here I would\r\nfain disquisit on Pike, but type and time are pressing.  Well, this\r\ngentleman had one day a difference of opinion with another planter, who\r\nwas, like himself, a great runner, and drawing his bowie knife, pursued\r\nhim on the run, _twenty-two miles_, ere he \"got\" his victim.  The\r\ndistance was subsequently measured and verified by the admiring\r\nneighbours, who put up posts in commemoration of such an unparalleled\r\npedestrian feat.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Brighton, after getting into lodgings, I began to\r\nemploy or amuse myself in novel fashion.  Old Gentilla Cooper, the gypsy,\r\nhad an old brother named Matthias, a full-blood Romany, of whom all his\r\npeople spoke as being very eccentric and wild, but who had all his life a\r\nfancy for picking up the old \"Egyptian\" tongue.  I engaged him to come to\r\nme two or three times a week, at half-a-crown a visit, to give me lessons\r\nin it.  As he had never lived in houses, and, like Regnar Lodbrog, had\r\nnever slept under a fixed roof, unless when he had taken a nap in a\r\ntavern or stable, and finally, as his whole life had been utterly that of\r\na gypsy in the roads, at fairs, or \"by wood and wold as outlaws wont to\r\ndo,\" I found him abundantly original and interesting.  And as on account\r\nof his eccentricity and amusing gifts he had always been welcome in every\r\ncamp or tent, and was watchful withal and crafty, there was not a phase,\r\nhole, or corner of gypsy life or a member of the fraternity with which or\r\nwhom he was not familiar.  I soon learned his jargon, with every kind of\r\ngypsy device, dodge, or peculiar custom, and, with the aid of several\r\nworks, succeeded in drawing from the recesses of his memory an\r\nastonishing number of forgotten words.  Thus, to begin with, I read to\r\nhim aloud the Turkish Gypsy Dictionary of Paspati.  When he remembered or\r\nrecognised a word, or it recalled another, I wrote it down.  Then I went\r\nthrough the vocabularies of Liebrich, Pott, Simson, &c., and finally\r\nthrough Brice's Hindustani Dictionary and the great part of a much larger\r\nwork, and one in Persian.  The reader may find most of the results of\r\nMatty's teaching in my work entitled \"The English Gypsies and their\r\nLanguage.\"  Very often I went with my professor to visit the gypsies\r\ncamped about Brighton, far or near, and certainly never failed to amuse\r\nmyself and pick up many quaint observations.  In due time I passed to\r\nthat singular state when I could never walk a mile or two in the country\r\nanywhere without meeting or making acquaintance with some wanderer on the\r\nhighways, by use of my newly-acquired knowledge.  Thus, I needed only\r\nsay, \"Seen any of the Coopers or Bosvilles lately on the drum?\" (road),\r\nor \"Do you know Sam Smith?\" &c., to be recognised as one of the grand\r\narmy in some fashion.  Then it was widely rumoured that the Coopers had\r\ngot a _rye_, or master, who spoke Romany, and was withal not ungenerous,\r\nso that in due time there was hardly a wanderer of gypsy kind in Southern\r\nEngland who had not heard of me.  And though there are thousands of\r\npeople who are more thoroughly versed in Society than I am, I do not\r\nthink there are many so much at home in such extremely _varied_ phases of\r\nit as I have been.  I have sat in a gypsy camp, like one of them, hearing\r\nall their little secrets and talking familiarly in Romany, and an hour\r\nafter dined with distinguished people; and this life had many other\r\nvariations, and they came daily for many years.  My gypsy experiences\r\nhave not been so great as those of Francis H. Groome (once a pupil and\r\n_protege_ of Benfey), or the Grand Duke Josef of Hungary, or of Dr.\r\nWlislocki, but next after these great masters, and as an all-round gypsy\r\nrye in many lands, I believe that I am not far behind any _aficionado_\r\nwho has as yet manifested himself.\r\n\r\nTo become intimate, as I did in time, during years in Brighton, off and\r\non, with all the gypsies who roamed the south of England, to be beloved\r\nof the old fortune-tellers and the children and mothers as I was, and to\r\nbe much in tents, involves a great deal of strangely picturesque rural\r\nlife, night-scenes by firelight, in forests and by river-banks, and\r\nmarvellously odd reminiscences of other days.  There was a gypsy child\r\nwho knew me so well that the very first words she could speak were \"_O\r\n'omany 'i_\" (O Romany rye), to the great delight of her parents.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while I found that the _Romany_ element was spread\r\nstrangely and mysteriously round about among the rural population in many\r\nways.  I went one day with Francis H. Groome to Cobham Fair.  As I was\r\nabout to enter a tavern, there stood near by three men whose faces and\r\ngeneral appearance had nothing of the gypsy, but as I passed one said to\r\nthe other so that I could hear--\r\n\r\n\"_Dikk adovo rye_, _se o Romany rye_, _yuv_, _tacho_!\"  (Look at that\r\ngentleman; he is a gypsy gentleman, sure!)\r\n\r\nI naturally turned my head hearing this, when he burst out laughing, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"I told you I'd make him look round.\"\r\n\r\nOnce I was startled at hearing a well-dressed, I may say a gentlemanly-\r\nlooking man, seated in a gig with a fine horse stopping by the road, say,\r\nas I passed with my wife--\r\n\r\n\"_Dikk adovo gorgio adoi_!\" (Look at that Gentile, of no-gypsy!)\r\n\r\nNot being accustomed to hear myself called a _gorgio_, I glanced up at\r\nhim angrily, when he, perceiving that I understood him and was of the\r\nmysterious brotherhood, smiled, and touched his hat to me.  One touch of\r\nnature makes the whole world grin.\r\n\r\nBut the drollest proposal ever made to me in serious earnest came from\r\nthat indomitable incarnate old _gypssissimus Tsingarorum_, Matthew\r\nCooper, who proposed that I should buy a donkey.  He knew where to get\r\none for a pound, but 2 pounds 10s. would buy a \"stunner.\"  He would\r\nborrow a small cart and a tent, and brown my face and hands so that I\r\nwould be dark enough, and then on the _drum_--\"over the hills.\"  As for\r\nall the expenses of the journey, I need not spend anything, for he could\r\nprovide a neat nut-brown maid, who would not only do all our cooking, but\r\nearn money enough by fortune-telling to support us all.  I would be\r\nexpected, however, to greatly aid by my superior knowledge of ladies and\r\ngentlemen; and so all would go merrily on, with unlimited bread and\r\ncheese, bacon and ale, and tobacco--into the blue away!\r\n\r\nI regret to say that Matthew expected to inherit the donkey.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, as all my friends went hunting once or twice a week, I\r\ndetermined to do the same.  Now, as I had never been a good rider, and\r\nhad anything but an English seat in the saddle, I went to a riding-school\r\nand underwent a thorough course both on the pig-skin and bare-backed.  My\r\nteacher, Mr. Goodchild, said eventually of me that I was the only person\r\nwhom he had ever known who had at my time of life learned to ride well.\r\nBut to do this I gave my whole mind and soul to it; and Goodchild's\r\nstandard, and still more that of his riding-master, who had been a\r\ncaptain in a cavalry regiment, was very high.  I used to feel quite as if\r\nI were a boy again, and one under pretty severe discipline at that, when\r\nthe Captain was drilling me.  For his life he could not treat his pupils\r\notherwise than as recruits.  \"Sit up straighter, sir!  Do you call _that_\r\nsitting up?  _That's_ not the way to hold your arms!  Knees in!  Why,\r\nsir, when I was learning to ride I was made to put shillings between my\r\nknees and the side, and if I dropped one _I forfeited it_!\"\r\n\r\nThen in due time came the meets, and the fox and hare hunting, during\r\nwhich I found my way, I believe, into every village or nook for twenty\r\nmiles round.  By this time I had forgotten all my troubles, mental or\r\nphysical, and after riding six or seven hours in a soft fog, would come\r\nhome the picture of health.\r\n\r\nI remember that one very cold morning I was riding alone to the meet on a\r\nmonstrous high black horse which Goodchild had bought specially for me,\r\nwhen I met two gypsy women, full blood, selling wares, among them woollen\r\nmittens--just what I wanted, for my hands were almost frozen in Paris\r\nkids.  The women did not know me, but I knew them by description, and\r\ngreat was the amazement of one when I addressed her by name and in\r\nRomany.\r\n\r\n\"_Pen a mandy_, _Priscilla Cooper_, _sa buti me sosti del tute for adovo\r\npustini vashtini_?\"  (Tell me, Priscilla Cooper, how much should I give\r\nyou for those woollen gloves?)\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen pence, master.\"  The common price was ninepence.\r\n\r\n\"I will _not_ give you eighteen pence,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then how much _will_ you give, master?\" asked Priscilla.\r\n\r\n\"_Four shillings_ will I give, and not a penny less--_miri pen_--you may\r\ntake it or leave it.\"\r\n\r\nI went off with the gloves, while the women roared out blessings in\r\nRomany.  There was something in the whole style of the gift, or the\r\n_manner_ of giving it, which was specially gratifying to gypsies, and the\r\naccount thereof soon spread far and wide over the roads as a beautiful\r\ndeed.\r\n\r\nThe fraternity of the roads is a strange thing.  Once when I lived at\r\nWalton there was an old gypsy woman named Lizzie Buckland who often\r\ncamped near us.  A good and winsome young lady named Lillie Doering had\r\ntaken a liking to the old lady, and sent her a nice Christmas present of\r\nclothing, tea, &c., which was sent to me to give to the Egyptian mother.\r\nBut when I went to seek her, she had flown over the hills and far away.\r\nIt made no difference.  I walked on till I met a perfect stranger to me,\r\na woman, but \"evidently a traveller.\"  \"Where is old Liz?\" I asked.\r\n\"Somewhere about four miles beyond Moulsey.\"  \"I've got a present for\r\nher; are you going that way?\"  \"Not exactly, but I'll take it to her; a\r\nfew miles don't signify.\"  I learned that it had gone from hand to hand\r\nand been safely delivered.  It seems a strange way to deliver valuables,\r\nto walk forth and give them to the first tramp whom you meet; but I knew\r\nmy people.\r\n\r\nI may here say that during this and the previous winter I had practised\r\nwood-carving.  In which, as in studying Gypsy, I had certain ultimate\r\naims, which were fully developed in later years.  I have several times\r\nobserved in this record that when I get an idea I cherish it, think it\r\nover, and work it up.  Out of this wood-carving and _repousse_ and the\r\ndesigning which it involved I in time developed ideas which led to what I\r\nmay fairly call a great result.\r\n\r\nWe remained at Brighton until February, when we went to London and stayed\r\nat the Langham Hotel.  Then began the London life of visits, dinners, and\r\nfor me, as usual, of literary work.  In those days I began to meet and\r\nknow Professor E. H. Palmer, Walter Besant, Walter H. Pollock, and many\r\nother men of the time of whom I shall anon have more to say.  I arranged\r\nwith Mr. Trubner as to the publication of \"The English Gypsies.\"  I think\r\nit was at this time that I dined one evening at Sir Charles Dilke's,\r\nwhere a droll incident took place.  There was present a small Frenchman,\r\nto whom I had not been introduced, and whose name therefore I did not\r\nknow.  After dinner in the smoking-room I turned over with this gentleman\r\na very curious collection of the works of Blake, which were new to him.\r\nFinding that he evidently knew something about art, I explained to him\r\nthat Blake was a very strange visionary--that he believed that the\r\nspirits of the dead appeared to him, and that he took their portraits.\r\n\r\n\"_C'etait donc un fou_,\" remarked the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n\"_Non_, Monsieur,\" I replied, \"he was not a madman.  He was almost a\r\ngenius.  Indeed, _c'etait un Dore manque_\" (he was all but a Dore).\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter from all around, and I, innocently supposing\r\nthat I had said something clever unawares, laughed too.\r\n\r\nAfter all had departed, and I was smoking alone with Sir Charles, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Well, what did you think of Dore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dore!\" I replied astonished, \"why, I never saw Dore in all my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was Dore to whom you were talking,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! well,\" was my answer, \"then it is all right.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose that Dore believed that I knew at the time who he was.  Had he\r\nbeen aware that I did not know who he was, the compliment would have\r\nseemed much stronger.\r\n\r\nI have either been introduced to, conversed with, or been well acquainted\r\nat one time or another with Sir John Millais, Holman Hunt, the Rossettis,\r\nFrith, Whistler, Poynter, Du Maurier, Charles Keene, Boughton, Hodges,\r\nTenniel (who set my motive of \"Ping-Wing,\" as I may say, to music in a\r\ncartoon in _Punch_), the Hon. John Collier, Riviere, Walter Crane, and of\r\ncourse many more--or less--here and there in the club, or at receptions.\r\nCould I have then foreseen or imagined that I should ever become--albeit\r\nin a very humble grade--an artist myself, and that my works on design and\r\nthe minor arts would form the principal portion of my writings and of my\r\nlife's work, I should assuredly have made a greater specialty of such\r\nsociety.  But at this time I could hardly draw, save in very humble\r\nfashion indeed, and little dreamed that I should execute for expensive\r\nworks illustrations which would be praised by my critics, as strangely\r\nhappened to my \"Gypsy Sorcery.\"  But we never know what may befall us.\r\n\r\n   \"Oh, little did my mother think,\r\n      The day she cradled me,\r\n   The lands that I should travel in,\r\n      Or the sights that I should see;\r\n   Or gae rovin' about wi' gypsy carles,\r\n      And sic like companie.\"\r\n\r\nAs the _Noctes_ varies it.  For it actually came to pass that a very well-\r\nknown man of letters, while he, with the refined politeness\r\ncharacteristic of his style, spoke of mine as \"rigmarole,\" still praised\r\nmy pictures.\r\n\r\nIn April we went to Leamington to pay a visit to a Mr. Field, where we\r\nalso met his brother, my old friend Leonard Field, whom I had known in\r\nParis in 1848.  During this, journey we visited Kenilworth, the town and\r\ncastle of Warwick, Stratford-on-Avon, and all therewith connected.  At\r\nthe Easter spring-tide, when primroses first flush by running waters, and\r\nthere are many long bright sunny days in the land, while birdes' songs do\r\nripple in the aire, it is good roaming or resting in such a country,\r\namong old castles, towers, and hamlets quaint and grey.  To him who can\r\nthink and feel, it is like the reading of marvellously pleasant old\r\nbooks, some in Elizabethan type, some in earlier black letter, and\r\nhearing as we read sweet music and far-distant chimes.  And apropos of\r\nthis, I would remark that while I was at Princeton an idea fixed itself\r\nso firmly in my mind that to this day I live on it and act on it.  It is\r\nthis:--There is a certain stage to be reached in reading and reflection,\r\nespecially if it be aided by broad aesthetic culture and science, when\r\nevery landscape, event, or human being is or may be to us exactly the\r\nsame as a _book_.  For everything in this world which can be understood\r\nand felt can be described, and whatever can be described may be written\r\nand printed.  For ordinary people, no ideas are distinct or concentrated\r\nor \"literary\" till they are in black and white; but the scholar or artist\r\nin words puts thoughts into as clear a form in his own mind.  Having\r\ndeeply meditated on this idea for forty years, and been constantly\r\noccupied in realising it, I can say truly that I _often_ compose or think\r\nbooks or monographs which, though not translated into type, are as\r\nabsolutely _literature_ to me as if they were.  There is so _much_ more\r\nin this than will at first strike most readers, that I can not help\r\ndwelling on it.  It once happened to me in Philadelphia, in 1850, to pass\r\n_all_ the year--in fact, nearly two years--\"in dusky city pent,\" and\r\nduring all that time I never got a glimpse of the country.  As a director\r\nof the Art Union, I was continually studying pictures, landscapes by\r\ngreat artists, and the like.  The second year, when I went up into\r\nPennsylvania, I found that I had strangely developed what practically\r\namounted to a kind of pseudophia.  Every fragment of rural scenery, every\r\nrustic \"bit,\" every group of shrubs or weeds, everything, in fact, which\r\nrecalled pictures, or which could itself be pictured, appeared to me to\r\nbe a picture perfectly executed.  This lasted as a vivid or real\r\nperception for about a week, but the memory of it has been in my mind\r\never since.  It was not so much the beautiful in all Nature which I saw,\r\nas that in Nature which was within the power of the skilled artist to\r\nexecute.  In like manner the practised reflector and writer reads books\r\nin everything to a degree which no other person can understand.\r\nWordsworth attained this stage, and the object of the \"Excursion\" is to\r\nteach it.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Letters of James Smetham\" there is a passage to the effect that\r\nhe felt extremely happy among English hedgerows, and found inexhaustible\r\ndelight in English birds, trees, flowers, hills, and brooks, but could\r\nnot appreciate his little back-garden with a copper-beech, a weeping-ash,\r\nnailed-up rose trees, and twisting creepers.  After I had made a habit,\r\ntill it became a passion, of seeking decorative motives, strange and\r\nnovel curves--in short, began to detect the transcendent alphabet or\r\nwritten language of beauty and mystery in every plant whatever (of which\r\nthe alphabet may be found in the works of Hulme), I found in every growth\r\nof every kind, yes, in every weed, enough to fill my soul with both art\r\nand poetry; I may say specially in weeds, since in them the wildest and\r\nmost graceful motives are more abundant than in garden flowers.  Unto me\r\n_now_ anything that grows is, in simple truth, more than what any\r\nlandscape once was.  This began in youth in much reading of, and long\r\nreflection on, the signatures, correspondences, and mystical fancies of\r\nthe Paracelsian writers--especially of Gaffarel, of whom I have a Latin\r\nversion by me as I write--and of late years I have carried its\r\ninspiration into decorative art.  I have said so much of this because, as\r\nthis is an autobiography, I cannot omit from it something which, unseen\r\nin actions, still forms a predominant motive in my life.  It is something\r\nwhich, while it perfectly embraces _all_ landscaping or picture-making or\r\ndainty delicate cataloguing in poetry, _a la_ Morris at times, or like\r\nthe Squyre of Lowe Degre, in detail, also involves a far more earnest\r\nfeeling, and one which combines thought or _religion_ with emotion, just\r\nas a melody which we associate with a beautiful poem is worth more to us\r\nthan one which we do not.  Burne Jones is a higher example of this.\r\n\r\nDuring this season we met at Mrs. Inwood Jones'--who was a niece of Lady\r\nMorgan and had many interesting souvenirs of her aunt--several people of\r\nnote, among whom was Mme. Taglioni, now a very agreeable and graceful\r\nthough naturally elderly lady.  I was charmed with her many reminiscences\r\nof well-known characters, and as I had seen her as well as Ellsler and\r\nall the great _ballerine_ many times, we had many conferences.  Somebody\r\nsaid to her one day, \"So you know Mr. Leland?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Taglioni\r\nin jest, \"he was one of my old lovers.\"  This was reported to me, when I\r\nsaid, \"I wish she had told me that thirty years sooner.\"  In 1846\r\nTaglioni owned three palaces in Venice, one of them the Ca' d'oro, and in\r\n1872 she was giving lessons in London.  At Mrs. Frank Hill's I made the\r\nacquaintance of the marvellously clever Eugene Schuyler, and at Mr.\r\nSmalley's of the equally amazingly cheeky and gifted \"Joaquin\" Miller.\r\nSomewhere else I met several times another curious celebrity whom I had\r\nknown in America, the Chevalier Wykoff.  Though he was almost the type\r\nand proverb of an adventurer, I confess that I always liked him.  He was\r\ngentlemanly and kind in his manner, and agreeable and intelligent in\r\nconversation.  Though he had been Fanny Ellsler's agent or secretary, and\r\nwritten those two curiously cool works, \"Souvenirs of a Roving\r\nDiplomatist\" (he had been employed by Palmerston) and \"My Courtship and\r\nits Consequences\" (in reference to his having been imprisoned in Italy\r\nfor attempting to carry off an elderly heiress), he was also the author\r\nof a really admirable work on the political system of the United States,\r\nwhich any man may read to advantage.  A century ago or more he would have\r\nbeen a great man in his way.  He knew everybody.  I believe that as\r\nGeneral Tevis formed his bold ideal of life from much reading of\r\n_condottieri_ or military adventurers, and Robert Hunt from Cooper's\r\nnovels, so Wykoff got his inspiration for a career from studying and\r\nadmiring the diplomatic _parvenus_ of Queen Anne's time.  These\r\n_Bohemiens de la haute volee_, who drew their first motives from study,\r\nare by far more interesting and tolerable than those of an illiterate\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nOne summer when I was at Bateman's, near Newport, with G. H. Boker,\r\nRobert Leroy, and our wives, Leroy reported one day that he had seen\r\nWykoff, Hiram Fuller, a certain very dashing _prima donna_, and two other\r\nnotorieties sitting side by side in a row on the steps of the Ocean\r\nHouse.  I remarked that if there had only been with them the devil and\r\nLola Montez, the party would have been complete.  Leroy was famous for\r\nhis quaint _mots_, in which he had a counterpart in \"Tom Appleton,\" of\r\nBoston, whom I also knew very well.  The Appletoniana and Leroyalties\r\nwhich were current in the Sixties would make a lively book.\r\n\r\nI remember that one evening at a dinner at Trubner's in this year there\r\nwere present M. Van der Weyer, G. H. Lewes, and M. Delepierre.  I have\r\nrarely heard so much good talk in the same time.  Thoughts so gay and\r\nflashes so refined, such a mingling of choice literature, brilliant\r\nanecdote, and happy jests, are seldom heard as I heard them.  _Tempi\r\npassati_!\r\n\r\nApropos of George H. Boker and Leroy, I may here remark that they were\r\nboth strikingly tall and _distingue_ men, but that when they dressed\r\nthemselves for bass-fishing, and \"put on mean attire,\" they seemed to be\r\ncommon fisher-folk.  One day, while fishing on the rocks, there came up\r\nthe elegant _prima donna_ referred to, who, seeing that they had very\r\nfine lobsters, ordered them to be taken to the hotel for her.  \"Can't do\r\nit, ma'am,\" answered Leroy brusquely; \"we want them for bait.\"  The lady\r\nswept away indignantly.  To her succeeded Ralph Waldo Emerson, who did\r\nnot know them personally, and who began to put to Mr. Boker questions as\r\nto his earnings and his manner of life, to all of which Mr. Boker replied\r\nwith great _naivete_.  Mr. B., however, had on his pole a silver reel,\r\nwhich had cost 30 pounds ($150), and at last Mr. Emerson's eye rested on\r\nthat, and word no more spoke he, but, with a smile and bowing very\r\npolitely, went his road.  _Ultimam dixit salutem_.\r\n\r\nOne evening I was sitting in the smoking-room of the Langham Hotel, when\r\nan American said to me, \"I hear that Charles Leland, who wrote\r\n'Breitmann,' is staying here.\"  \"Yes, that is true,\" I replied.  \"Could\r\nyou point him out to me?\" asked the stranger.  \"I will do so with\r\npleasure--in fact, if you will tell me your name, I think I can manage to\r\nintroduce you.\"  The American was very grateful for this, and asked when\r\nit would be.  \"_Now_ is the time,\" I said, \"for I am he.\"  On another\r\noccasion another stranger told me, that having heard that Mr. Leland was\r\nin the smoking-room, he had come in to see him, and asked me to point him\r\nout.  I pointed to myself, at which he was much astonished, and then,\r\napologetically and half ashamed, said, \"Who do you really suppose, of all\r\nthe men here present, I had settled on as being you?\"  I could not\r\nconjecture, when he pointed to a great broom-bearded, broad-shouldered,\r\njovial, intemperate, German-looking man, and said, \"There!  I thought\r\nthat must be the author of 'Hans Brietmann.'\"  Which suggested to me the\r\nidea, \"Does the public, then, generally believe that poets look like\r\ntheir heroes?\"  One can indeed imagine Longfellow as Poor Henry of the\r\n\"Golden Legend,\" but few would expect to find the counterpart of Biglow\r\nin a Lowell.  And yet this belief or instinct is in every case a _great_\r\ncompliment, for it testifies that there is that in the poem which is\r\ninspired by Nature and originality, and that it is not all mere art-work\r\nor artificial.  And it is true that by some strange law, name, body, and\r\nsoul generally do preserve some kind of unity in the realm of literature.\r\nThere has never been, as yet, a really great Gubbins or Podgers in\r\npoetry, or Boggs in romance; and if literature has its Hogg, let it be\r\nremembered that the wild boar in all Northern sagas and chronicles, like\r\nthe Eber in Germany, or the Wolf, was a name of pride and honour, as seen\r\nin Eberstein.  The Whistler of St. Leonard's is one of the most eccentric\r\nand original of Scott's characters, and the Whistler of St. Luke's, or\r\nthe patron saint of painting, is in no respect deficient in these noble\r\nqualifications.  The Seven Whistlers who fly unseen by night, ever piping\r\na wild nocturne, are the most uncanny of birds, while there is, to my\r\nmind, something absolutely grotesquely awful (as in many of \"Dreadful\r\nJemmy's\" pictures) in the narration that in ancient days the immense army\r\nof the Mexican Indians marched forth to battle all whistling in\r\nunison--probably a symphony in blood-colour.  Fancy half a million of\r\nWhistlers on the war-path, about to do battle to the death with as many\r\nRuskins--I mean red-skins!  _Nomen est omen_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most charming persons whom I ever met in my life was the Hon.\r\nMrs. Caroline Norton, and one of the most delightful dinners at which my\r\nwife and I were ever present was at her house.  As I had been familiar\r\nwith her poems from my boyhood, I was astonished to find her still so\r\nbeautiful and young--if my memory does not deceive me, I thought her far\r\nyounger looking than myself.  I owe her this compliment, for I can recall\r\nher speaking with great admiration of Mrs. Leland to Lord Houghton and\r\n\"Bulwer.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Norton had not only a graceful, fascinating expression of figure and\r\nmotion, but narrated everything so well as to cast a peculiar life and\r\ninterest into the most trifling anecdote.  I remember one of the latter.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Houghton,\" she said, \"calls you, Mr. Leland, the poet of jargons.\"\r\n(He indeed introduced me to all his guests once by this term.)  \"Jargon\r\nis a confusion of language, and I have a maid who lives in a jargon of\r\nideas--as to values.  The other day she broke to utter ruin an antique\r\nvase\"--(I do not accurately recall what the object was)--\"which cost four\r\nhundred pounds, and when I said that it was such a grief to me to lose\r\nit, she replied, while weeping, 'Oh, do not mind it, my lady; _I'll_ buy\r\nyou just such another,' as if it were worth tenpence.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Norton had marvellously beautiful and expressive eyes, such as one\r\nseldom meets thrice in a life.  As a harp well played inspires tears or\r\nthe impulse to dance, so her glances conveyed, almost in the same\r\ninstant, deep emotion and exquisite merriment.  I remember that she was\r\nmuch amused with some of my American jests and reminiscences, and was\r\nalways prompt to respond, _eodem genere_.  So nightingale the wodewale\r\nanswereth.\r\n\r\nDuring this season in London I met Thomas Carlyle.  Our mutual friend,\r\nMoncure Conway, had arranged that I should call on the great writer at\r\nthe house of the latter in Chelsea.  I went there at about eleven in the\r\nmorning, and when Mr. Carlyle entered the room I was amazed--I may say\r\nalmost awed--by something which was altogether unexpected, and this was\r\nhis _extraordinary_ likeness to my late father.  A slight resemblance to\r\nCarlyle may be seen in my own profile, but had he been with my father,\r\nthe pair might have passed for twins; and in iron-grey grimness and the\r\nnever-to-be-convinced expression of the eyes they were identity itself.\r\n\r\nI can only remember that for the first twenty or thirty minutes Mr.\r\nCarlyle talked such a lot of skimble-skamble stuff and rubbish, which\r\nsounded like the very _debris_ and lees of his \"Latter-Day Pamphlets,\"\r\nthat I began to suspect that he was quizzing me, or that this was the\r\nmanner in which he ladled out Carlyleism to visitors who came to be\r\nCarlyled and acted unto.  It struck me as if Mr. Tennyson, bored with\r\nlion-hunting guests, had begun to repeat his poetry to them out of sheer\r\nsarcasm, or as if he felt, \"Well, you've come to _see_ and _hear_ me--a\r\npoet--so take your poetry, and be d---d to you!\"  However, it may be I\r\nfelt a coming wrath, and the Socratic demon or gypsy _dook_, which often\r\nrises in me on such occasions, and never deceives me, gave me a strong\r\npremonition that there was to be, if not an exemplary row, at least a\r\nlively incident which was to put a snapped end to this humbugging.\r\n\r\nIt came thus.  All at once Mr. Carlyle abruptly asked me, in a manner or\r\nwith an intonation which sounded to me almost semi-contemptuous, \"And\r\nwhat kind of an American may you be?\"  (I _think_ he said \"will you be?\")\r\n\"German, or Irish, or what?\"\r\n\r\nTo which I replied, not over amiably:--\r\n\r\n\"Since it interests you, Mr. Carlyle, to know the origin of my family, I\r\nmay say that I am descended from Henry Leland, whom the tradition\r\ndeclares to have been a noted Puritan, and active in the politics of his\r\ntime,' and who went to America in 1636.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Carlyle replied:--\r\n\r\n\"I doubt whether any of your family have since been equal to your old\r\nPuritan great-grandfather\" (or \"done anything to equal your old Puritan\r\ngrandfather\").  With this something to the effect that we had done\r\nnothing in America since Cromwell's Revolution, equal to it in importance\r\nor of any importance.\r\n\r\nThen a great rage came over me, and I remember _very_ distinctly that\r\nthere flashed through my mind in a second the reflection, \"Now, if I have\r\nto call you a d---d old fool for saying that, I _will_; but I'll be even\r\nwith you.\"  When as quickly the following inspiration came, which I\r\nuttered, and I suspect somewhat energetically:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carlyle, I think that my brother, Henry Leland, who got the wound\r\nfrom which he died standing by my side in the war of the rebellion,\r\nfighting against slavery, was worth ten of my old Puritan ancestors; at\r\nleast, he died in a ten times better cause.  And\" (here my old \"Indian\"\r\nwas up and I let it out) \"allow me to say, Mr. Carlyle, that I think that\r\nin all matters of historical criticism you are principally influenced by\r\nthe merely melodramatic and theatrical.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Carlyle, looking utterly amazed and startled, though not at all\r\nangry, said, for the first time, in broad Scotch--\r\n\r\n\"Whot's _thot_ ye say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Mr. Carlyle,\" I exclaimed with rising wrath, \"that I consider\r\nthat in all historical judgments you are influenced only by the\r\nmelodramatic and theatrical.\"\r\n\r\nA grim smile as of admiration came over the stern old face.  Whether he\r\nreally felt the justice of the hit I know not, but he was evidently\r\npleased at the manner in which it was delivered, and it was with a deeply\r\nreflective and not displeased air that he replied, still in Scotch--\r\n\r\n\"Na, na, I'm nae _thot_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the terrier who had ferociously attacked the lion, and the lion\r\nwas charmed.  From that instant he was courteous, companionable, and\r\naffable, and talked as if we had been long acquainted, and as if he liked\r\nme.  It occurred to me that the resemblance of Carlyle to my father\r\nduring the row was appalling, the difference being that my father _never_\r\ngave in.  It would have been an awful sight to see and a sound to hear if\r\nthe two could have \"discussed\" some subject on which they were equally\r\ninformed--say the American tariff or slavery.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Mr. Froude the historian came in, and we all went out\r\ntogether for a walk in the Park.  Pausing on the bridge, Mr. Carlyle\r\ncalled my attention to the very rural English character of a part of the\r\nscenery in the distance, where a church-spire rises over ranges of tree-\r\ntops.  I observed that the smoke of a gypsy fire and a tent by a hedge\r\nwas all that was needed.  Then we began to talk about gypsies, and I told\r\nMr. Carlyle that I could talk Romany, and ran on with some reminiscences,\r\nwhereat, as I now recall, though I did not note it then, his amusement at\r\nor interest in me seemed to be much increased, as if I had unexpectedly\r\nturned out to be something a little out of the ordinary line of tourist\r\ninterviewers; and truly in those days Romany ryes were not so common as\r\nthey now are.  Then Mr. Carlyle himself told a story, how his father--if\r\nI remember rightly--had once lent a large sum to or trusted a gypsy in\r\nsome extraordinary manner.  It befell in after days that the lender was\r\nhimself in sore straits, when the gypsy took him by night to a hut, and\r\ndigging up or lifting the _hard-stane_ or hearth-stone, took out a bag of\r\nguineas, which he transferred to his benefactor.\r\n\r\nWe parted, and this was the only time I ever conversed with Mr. Carlyle,\r\nthough I saw him subsequently on more than one occasion.  He sent word\r\nspecially by Mr. Conway to me that he would be pleased to have me call\r\nagain; but \"once bitten twice shy,\" and I had not so much enjoyed my call\r\nas to wish to repeat it.  But I believe that what Mr. Carlyle absolutely\r\nneeded above all things on earth was somebody to put on the gloves with\r\nhim metaphorically about once a day, and give and take a few thumping\r\nblows; nor do I believe that he would have shrunk from a tussle _a la\r\nChoctaw_, with biting, gouging, tomahawk and scalper, for he had an\r\nuncommonly _dour_ look about the eyes, and must have been a magnificent\r\nfighter when once roused.  But though I had not his vast genius nor wit,\r\nI had the great advantage of having often had very severe differences\r\nwith my father, who was, I believe, as much Carlyled by Nature as Carlyle\r\nhimself, if not more so, whereas it is morally impossible that the Sage\r\nof Chelsea could ever have found any one like himself to train under.  But\r\nto Carlyle people in conversation requires constant practice with a\r\nmaster--_consuetudine quotidiana cum aliquo congredi_--and he had for so\r\nlong a time knocked everybody down without meeting the least resistance,\r\nthat victory had palled upon him, and he had, so to speak, \"vinegared\" on\r\nhimself.  With somebody to \"sass him back,\" Carlyle would have been cured\r\nof the dyspepsia, and have lived twenty years longer.\r\n\r\nCarlyle's was and ever will be one of the greatest names in English\r\nliterature, and it is very amusing to observe how the gossip-makers, who\r\njudge of genius by tittle-tattle and petty personal defects, have\r\ncondemned him _in toto_ because he was not an angel to a dame who was\r\ncertainly a bit of a _diablesse_.  Thus I find in a late very popular\r\ncollection the remark that--\r\n\r\n\"It is curious to note in the 'Life and Correspondence of Lord Houghton'\r\nthe high estimation in which Carlyle was held by him.  His regard and\r\nadmiration cannot but seem exaggerated, now that we know so much of the\r\nChelsea philosopher's real character.\"\r\n\r\nThis is _quite_ the moral old lady, who used to think that Raphael was a\r\ngood painter \"till she read all about that nasty Fornarina.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another hard old character with whom I became acquainted in\r\nthose days, and one who, though not a Carlyle, still, like him, exercised\r\nin a peculiar way a great influence on English literature.  This was\r\nGeorge Borrow.  I was in the habit of reading a great deal in the British\r\nMuseum, where he also came, and there I was introduced to him.\r\n\r\nHe was busy with a venerable-looking volume in old Irish and made the\r\nremark to me that he did not believe there was a man living who could\r\nread old Irish with ease (which I now observe to myself was \"fished\" out\r\nof Sir W. Betham).  We discussed several gypsy words and phrases.  I met\r\nhim in the same place several times.  He was a tall, large, fine-looking\r\nman, who must have been handsome in his youth.  I knew at the time in\r\nLondon a Mr. Kerrison, who had been as a very young man, probably in the\r\nTwenties, very intimate with Borrow.  He told me that one night Borrow\r\nacted very wildly, whooping and vociferating so as to cause the police to\r\nfollow him, and after a long run led them to the edge of the Thames, \"and\r\nthere they thought they had him.\"  But he plunged boldly into the water\r\nand swam in his clothes to the opposite shore, and so escaped.\r\n\r\n   \"For he fled o'er to t'other side,\r\n      And so they could not find him;\r\n   He swam across the flowing tide,\r\n      And never looked behind him.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time (1826?) George Borrow published a small book of poems\r\nwhich is now extremely rare.  I have a copy of it.  In it there is a\r\nlyric in which, with his usual effrontery, he describes a very clever,\r\ntall, handsome, accomplished man, who knows many languages and who can\r\ndrink a pint of rum, ending with the remark that he himself was this\r\nadmirable person.  As Heine was in England at this time, it is not\r\nimprobable that he met with this poem; but in any case, there is a\r\nresemblance between it and one of his own in the _Buch der Lieder_, which\r\nruns thus:--\r\n\r\n   \"Brave man, he got me the food I ate,\r\n   His kindness and care I can never forget,\r\n   Yet I cannot kiss him, though other folk can,\r\n   For I myself am this excellent man!\"\r\n\r\nIt came to pass that after a while I wrote my book on \"The English\r\nGypsies and their Language,\" and sent a note to Mr. Borrow in which I\r\nasked permission to dedicate it to him.  I sent it to the care of Mr.\r\nMurray, who subsequently assured me that Mr. Borrow had actually received\r\nit.  Now Mr. Borrow had written thirty years before some sketches and\r\nfragments on the same subject, which would, I am very certain, have\r\nremained unpublished to this day but for me.  He received my note on\r\nSaturday--never answered it--and on Monday morning advertised in all the\r\njournals his own forthcoming work on the same subject.\r\n\r\nNow, what is sincere truth is, that when I learned this I laughed.  I\r\nthought very little of my own work, and if Mr. Borrow had only told me\r\nthat it was in the way of his I would have withdrawn it at once, and that\r\nwith right goodwill, for I had so great a respect for the Nestor of\r\ngypsyism that I would have been very glad to have gratified him with such\r\na small sacrifice.  But it was not in him to suspect or imagine so much\r\ncommon decency in any human heart, and so he craftily, and to my great\r\ndelight and satisfaction, \"got ahead\" of me.  For, to tell the truth of\r\ntruth, I was pleased to my soul that I had caused him to make and publish\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nI have said too hastily that it was written thirty years before.  What I\r\nbelieve is, that Mr. Borrow had by him a vocabulary, and a few loose\r\nsketches, which he pitchforked together, but that the book itself was\r\nmade and cemented into one with additions for the first time after he\r\nreceived my note.  He was not, take him altogether, over-scrupulous.  Sir\r\nPatrick Colquhoun told me that once when he was at Constantinople, Mr.\r\nBorrow came there, and gave it out that he was a marvellous Oriental\r\nscholar.  But there was great scepticism on this subject at the Legation,\r\nand one day at the _table-d'hote_, where the great writer and divers\r\nyoung diplomatists dined, two who were seated on either side of Borrow\r\nbegan to talk in Arabic, speaking to him, the result being that he was\r\nobliged to confess that he not only did not understand what they were\r\nsaying, but did not even know what the language was.  Then he was tried\r\nin Modern Greek, with the same result.  The truth was that he knew a\r\ngreat deal, but did all in his power to make the world believe it was far\r\nmore--like the African king, or the English prime minister, who, the\r\nlonger his shirts were made, insisted on having the higher collars, until\r\nthe former trailed on the ground and the latter rose above the top of his\r\nhead--\"when they came home from the wash!\"\r\n\r\nWhat I admire in Borrow to such a degree that before it his faults or\r\nfailings seem very trifling, is his absolutely vigorous, marvellously\r\nvaried originality, based on direct familiarity with Nature, but guided\r\nand cultured by the study of natural, simple writers, such as Defoe and\r\nSmollett.  I think that the \"interest\" in or rather sympathy for gypsies,\r\nin his case as in mine, came not from their being curious or dramatic\r\nbeings, but because they are so much a part of free life, of out-of-doors\r\nNature; so associated with sheltered nooks among rocks and trees, the\r\nhedgerow and birds, river-sides, and wild roads.  Borrow's heart was\r\nlarge and true as regarded English rural life; there was a place in it\r\nfor everything which was of the open air and freshly beautiful.  He was\r\nnot a view-hunter of \"bits,\" trained according to Ruskin and the\r\n_deliberate_ word-painting of a thousand novels and Victorian picturesque\r\npoems; but he often brings us nearer to Nature than they do, not by\r\nphotography, but by casually letting fall a word or trait, by which we\r\nrealise not only her form but her soul.  Herein he was like Washington\r\nIrving, who gives us the impression of a writer who was deeply inspired\r\nwith calm sweet sunny views of Nature, yet in whose writings literal\r\ndescription is so rarely introduced, that it is a marvel how much the\r\nsingle buttercup lights up the landscape for a quarter of a mile, when a\r\nthousand would produce no effect whatever.  This may have possibly been\r\nart in Irving--art of the most subtle kind--but in Borrow it was\r\ninstinct, and hardly intentional.  In this respect he was superior even\r\nto Whitman.\r\n\r\nAnd here I would say, apropos of Carlyle, Tennyson, Irving, Borrow,\r\nWhitman, and some others whom I have met, that with such men in only one\r\nor two interviews, one covers more ground and establishes more intimacy\r\nthan with the great majority of folk whom we meet and converse with\r\nhundreds of times.  Which fact has been set forth by Wieland in his work\r\non Democritus or the Abderites so ingeniously, as people expressed it a\r\ncentury ago, or so cleverly, as we now say, or so sympathetically, as an\r\nItalian would say, that my pen fails to utter the thoughts which arise in\r\nme compared to what he has written.\r\n\r\nWhen the summer came, or on the 1st of August, we started on a grand tour\r\nabout England.  First we went to Salisbury.  I was deeply interested in\r\nthe Cathedral there, because it is possibly the only great Gothic\r\nstructure of the kind in Europe which was completed in a single style\r\nduring a single reign.  Stonehenge was to me even more remarkable,\r\nbecause it is more mysterious.  Its stupendous barbarism or archaic\r\ncharacter, involving a whole lost cycle of ideas, contrasts so strangely\r\nwith the advanced architectural skill displayed in the cutting and\r\nfitting of the vast blocks, that the whole seems to be a mighty paradox.\r\nThis was the work of many thousands of men--of very well directed labour\r\nunder the supervision of architects who could draw and measure skilfully\r\nwith a grand sense of _proportion_ or symmetry, who had, however, not\r\nattained to ornament--a thing without parallel in humanity.  This is\r\nabsolutely bewildering, as is the utter want of all indication as to its\r\nreal purpose.  The old British tradition that the stones were brought by\r\nmagic from Africa, coupled with what Sir John Lubbock and others declare\r\nas to similar remains on the North African coast, suggest something, but\r\nwhat that was remains to be discovered.  Men have, however, developed\r\ngreat works of the massive and simple order in poetry, as well as in\r\narchitecture.  The Nibelungen Lied is a Stonehenge.  There are in it only\r\none or two similes or decorations.  \"Simplicity is its sole ornament.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Salisbury we went to Wells.  The cathedrals of England form the\r\npages of a vast work in which there is written the history of a paradox\r\nor enigma as marvellous as that of Stonehenge; and it is this--that the\r\nfarther back we go, even into a really barbarous age, almost to the time\r\nwhen Roman culture had died and the mediaeval had not begun, the more\r\nexquisite are the proportions of buildings, the higher their tone, and,\r\nas in the case of Early and Decorated English, the more beautiful their\r\nornament.  That is to say, that exactly in the time when, according to\r\nall our modern teaching and ideas, there should have been _no_\r\narchitectural art, it was most admirably developed, while, on the\r\ncontrary, in this end of the nineteenth century, when theory, criticism,\r\nlearning, and science abound, it is in its lowest and most depraved\r\nstate, its highest flights aiming at nothing better than cheap imitation\r\nof old examples.  The age which produced the Romanesque architecture,\r\nwhether in northern Italy, along the Rhine as the Lombard, or in France\r\nand England as Norman, was extremely barbarous, bloody, and illiterate;\r\nand yet in the noblest and grandest conceptions of architectural art it\r\nsurpassed all the genius of this our time as the sun surpasses a star.\r\nWhile we _know_ that man has advanced, it still remains true that the\r\nhistory of architecture alone for the past thousand years indicates a\r\nsteady retrogression and decay in art, and this constitutes the\r\nstupendous paradox to which I have alluded.  But Milton has fully\r\nexplained to us that when the devils in hell built the first great temple\r\nor palace--Pandemonium--they achieved the greatest work of architecture\r\never seen!\r\n\r\nYork Cathedral made on me a hundred times deeper and more sympathetic\r\nimpression than St. Peter's of Rome.  There is a grandeur of unity and a\r\nsense of a single cultus in it which the Renaissance never reached in\r\nanything.  Even from the days of Orcagna there is an element of mixed\r\nmotives and incoherence in the best of Italian architecture and\r\nsculpture.  It requires colour to effect that which Norman or Gothic art\r\ncould produce more grandly and impressively with _shade_ alone.  It is\r\nthe difference between a garden and a forest.  This is shown in the\r\nglorious mediaeval _grisaille_ windows, in which such art proves its\r\nabsolute perfection.  While I was looking at these in rapt admiration, an\r\nAmerican friend who did not lack a certain degree of culture asked me if\r\nI did not find in them a great want of colour!\r\n\r\nI made in York the acquaintance of a youth named Carr, son of a former\r\nhigh sheriff, who, by the way, showed us very great hospitality whenever\r\nwe visited the city.  This young man had read Labarthe and other writers\r\non archaeology, and was enthusiastic in finding relics of the olden time.\r\nHe took me into a great many private houses.  I visited every church, and\r\nindeed saw far more than do the great majority of even the most inquiring\r\nvisitors.  The Shambles was then and is still perhaps one of the most\r\ncurious specimens of a small mediaeval street in the world.  I felt as if\r\nI could pass a life in the museum and churches, and I did, in fact, years\r\nafter, remain there, very busy, for three weeks, sketching innumerable\r\ncorbels, gargoyles, goblins, arches, weather-worn saints and sinners.  And\r\nin the Cathedral I found the original of the maid in the garden a-hanging\r\nout the clothes.  She is a fair sinner, and the blackbird is a demon\r\nvolatile, who, having lighted on her shoulder, snaps her by the nose to\r\nget her soul.  The motive often occurs in Gothic sculpture.\r\n\r\nWe may trace it back--_vide_ the \"Pharaohs, Fellahs, and Explorers\" of\r\nAmelia B. Edwards (whom I have also met at an Oriental Congress)--to\r\nRoman Harpies and the Egyptian _Ba_, depicted in the \"Book of the Dead\"\r\nor the \"Egyptian Bible.\"\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}  As I was very desirous of learning more about this celebrated\r\nfireplace, I inserted a request in the _Public Ledger_ for information\r\nregarding it, which elicited the following from some one to me unknown,\r\nto whom I now return thanks:--\r\n\r\n   \"MR. CITY-EDITOR OF THE _Public Ledger_,--In your edition of this\r\n   date, I notice a communication headed 'To Local Antiquarians.'  Without\r\n   any well-founded pretensions to the designation 'Antiquarian,' as I\r\n   get older I still take a great interest in the early history of our\r\n   beloved city.  I remember _distinctly_ the fact, but not the date, of\r\n   reading a description of the 'mantelpiece.'  It was of wood,\r\n   handsomely carved on the pillars, and under the shelf, and on the\r\n   centre between the pillars, was the following quaint and witty\r\n   _hieroglyphic_ inscription:--\r\n\r\n   When the grate is M. T. put:\r\n   When it is . putting:\r\n\r\n   which is a little puzzling at first sight, but readily translated by\r\n   converting the punctuation points into written words.\r\n\r\n   SENIOR.\r\n\r\n   \"_Frankford_, _May 24_, _1892_.\"\r\n\r\nI can add to this, that the chimney-piece was originally made for wood-\r\nfires, and that long after a grate was set in and the inscription added.\r\n\r\n{13}  Also given as Delaund or Dellaund in one copy.  De Quincey was\r\nproud of his descent from De la Laund.  I may here say that John Leyland,\r\nwho is a painstaking and conscientious antiquarian and accomplished\r\ngenealogist, has been much impressed with the extraordinary similarity of\r\ndisposition, tastes, and pursuits which has characterised the Lelands for\r\ncenturies.  Any stranger knowing us would think that he and I were nearly\r\nrelated.  It is told of the manor of Leyland that during the early Middle\r\nAges it was attempted to build a church there in a certain place, but\r\nevery morning the stones were found to be removed.  Finally, it was\r\ncompleted, but the next dawn beheld the whole edifice removed to the\r\nother spot, while a spirit-voice was heard to call (one account says that\r\nthe words were found on a mystic scroll):\r\n\r\n   \"Here shall itt bee,\r\n   And here shall itt stande;\r\n   And this shall bee called:\r\n   Ye Churche of Leyland.\"\r\n\r\n{16}  A similar incident is recorded in _Kenelm Chillingly_.  I had long\r\nbefore the publication of the work conversed with Lord Lytton on the\r\nsubject--which is also touched on in my _Sketch-Book of Meister Karl_, of\r\nwhich the illustrious author had a copy.\r\n\r\n{56}  Since writing the foregoing, and by a most appropriately odd\r\ncoincidence or mere chance, I have received with delight a copy of this\r\nwork from Jesse Jaggard, a well-known dealer in literary curiosities in\r\nLiverpool, who makes a specialty of _hunting up_ rarities to order, which\r\nis of itself a quaint business.  The book is entitled \"Curiosities for\r\nthe Ingenious, Selected from the Most Authentic Treasures of Nature,\r\nScience and Art, Biography, History, and General Literature.  London:\r\nThomas Boys, Ludgate Hill, 1821.\"  Boys was the publisher of the\r\ncelebrated series of \"The Percy Anecdotes.\"  I should here, in justice to\r\nMr. Jaggard, mention that I am indebted to him for obtaining for me\r\nseveral rare and singular works, and that his catalogues are remarkably\r\nwell edited.\r\n\r\n{98}  May I be pardoned for here mentioning that Mr. Symonds, not long\r\nbefore his death, wrote a letter to one of our mutual friends, in which\r\nhe spoke \"most enthusiastically\" of my work on \"Etruscan Roman Traditions\r\nin Popular Tradition.\"  \"For that alone would I have writ the book.\"\r\n\r\n{101}  \"Susan Cushman was extremely pretty, but was not particularly\r\ngifted; in personal appearance she was altogether unlike Charlotte; . . .\r\nthe latter was a large, tall woman\" (\"Gossip of the Century,\" vol. ii.).\r\nJohn Du Solle took me for the first time to see Charlotte Cushman, and\r\nthen asked me what I thought she looked like.  And I replied, \"A bull in\r\nblack silk.\"\r\n\r\n{156}  He was the real head, and the most sensible, of that vast array of\r\nwild antiquaries, among whom are Faber, Godfrey Higgins, Inman, Bryant,\r\nand several score more whom I in my youth adored and devoured with a\r\ndelight surpassing words.\r\n\r\n{225}  (Here I forgot myself--this occurred in New York.)\r\n\r\n{237}  Herzen once sent me a complete collection of all his books.\r\n\r\n{242}  Abraham Lincoln once remarked of the people who wanted\r\nemancipation, but who did not like to be called Abolitionists, that they\r\nreminded him of the Irishman who had signed a temperance pledge and did\r\nnot like to break it, yet who sadly wanted a \"drink.\"  So going to an\r\napothecary he asked for a glass of soda-water, adding, \"an', docther\r\ndear, if yees could put a little whisky into it _unbeknownst_ to me, I'd\r\nbe much obliged to yees.\"  I believe that I may say that as Mr. Lincoln\r\nread all which I published (as I was well assured), I was the apothecary\r\nhere referred to, who administered the whisky of Abolition disguised in\r\nthe soda-water of Emancipation.\r\n\r\n{252}  Chapman Biddle himself was a very remarkable man as a lawyer, and\r\na person of marked refinement and culture.  He became my friend in after\r\nyears, as did his son Walter.  Both are now departed.  I wrote and\r\npublicly read an \"In Memoriam\" address and poem on his death, in\r\ndelivering which I had great pains to refrain from weeping, which was\r\nstartling to me, not being habitually expressive of emotion.\r\n\r\n{266a}  In reference to \"heaving out\" by main force, cannon from some\r\ndeep slough, perhaps of stiff clay, which holds like glue, or, what I\r\nthink far more wearisome, urging them along for miles over the heaviest\r\nroads or broken ways, when the poor exhausted mules have almost given\r\nout.  Though, as he says, he was only nineteen and seemed very fragile,\r\nthe indomitable pluck and perseverance of Gilder in all such trials were\r\nsuch as to call special commendation from my brother Henry, who was not\r\nhabitually wasteful of praise.\r\n\r\n{266b}  \"Well do I remember\" also what accursed work it was, the ground\r\nconsisting chiefly of broken stone, and how a number of Paddies, who were\r\naccustomed to such labour, assembled above and around us to enjoy the\r\nunusual sight of \"jontlemen\" digging like \"canawlers,\" and how I, while\r\nat my spade, excited their hilarity and delight by casting at them scraps\r\nof \"ould Eerish,\" or Irish.  The fight of the section here alluded to\r\nwas, I believe, rather of the nature of an improvised rencontre, albeit\r\ntwo or three rebels were killed in the artillery duel.  Corporal\r\nPenington was, I believe, as usual, the inspiring Mephistopheles of the\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n{267}  This reply, which is much better in every respect than that of\r\n\"The old guard dies but never yields,\" was made in the face of far more\r\noverwhelming numbers, and has few parallels for sheer audacity, all\r\nthings considered, in the history of modern warfare.  It passed into a\r\nvery widely-spread popular _mot_ in America.  It is more than an _on\r\ndit_, for I was nearly within ear-shot when it was uttered, and it was\r\npromptly repeated to me.  Yet, if my memory serves me right, there is\r\nsomething like this, \"Come and take it!\" recorded in the early Tuscan\r\nwars in Villari's introduction to the \"Life of Machiavelli,\" translated\r\nby his accomplished wife.  I have, as I write this note, just had the\r\npleasure of meeting with the Minister and Madame Villari at a dinner at\r\nSenator Comparetti's in Florence, which is perhaps the reason why I\r\nrecall the precedent.  And I may also recall as a noteworthy incident,\r\nthat at this dinner Professor Milani, the great Etruscologist and head of\r\nthe Archaeological Museum, congratulated me very much on having been the\r\nfirst and only person who ever discovered an old Etruscan word still\r\nliving in the traditions of the people--_i.e._, _Intial_, the Spirit of\r\nthe Haunting Shadow.  This is a little discursive--_mais je prends mon\r\nbien ou je le trouve_, and it is all autobiographic!  \"It is all turkey,\"\r\nas the wolf said when he ate the claws.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of General Smith to resist with us alone the tremendous\r\nmaddened rush of half of Lee's veterans has its re-echo in my ballad,\r\nwhere Breitmann attempts with his Bummers to stem the great army of the\r\nSouth.  The result would have probably been the same--that is, we should\r\nhave been \"gobbled up.\"  But he would have undoubtedly tried it without\r\nmisgiving.  I have elsewhere narrated my only interview with him.\r\n\r\n{268}  The thunder of the artillery at Gettysburg was indeed something to\r\nbe long and well remembered.  It was so awful that on the field wild\r\nrabbits, appalled by the sound, ran to the gunners and soldiers and tried\r\nto take refuge in their bosoms.  Those who have only heard cannon fired\r\nsingly, or a single discharge of cannon, can have no conception of what\r\nsuch sounds when long sustained are like.\r\n\r\n{274}  Apropos of Olcott he did good and noble work in the war, in the\r\nfield, and also out of it as a Government detective, and I am very far\r\nfrom being ashamed to say that I aided him more than once in the latter\r\ncapacity.  There was a lady in Philadelphia who availed herself of a\r\ndistinguished position in society so as to go and come from Richmond and\r\nact as spy and carry letters between rebel agents.  I knew this and told\r\nOlcott of it, who put a stop to her treason.  I also learned that a\r\nrascally contractor had defrauded Government with adulterated chemicals.\r\nOlcott had him heavily fined.\r\n\r\n{309}  The reader may find some interesting references to Robert Hunt in\r\nthe Introduction by me to the _Life of James Beckwourth_, the famous\r\nchief of the Crow Indians.  London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1893.\r\n\r\n{333}  \"CUSTER was the life and soul of the greatest hand-to-hand victory\r\never gained over the Indians of the Plains--except Patsy Connor's Bear\r\nRiver Fight.\"--_The Masked Venus_, by RICHARD HENRY SAVAGE.\r\n\r\n{334}  Miss Owen is well known to all folk-lorists as the first living\r\nauthority on _Voodoo_.\r\n\r\n{346}  I am revising this MS. in the beautiful palazzo built for Ristori,\r\n22 Lung Arno Nuovo, Florence.  It is now the Pensione Pellini.  On the\r\nground floor are statues representing Ristori in different parts.\r\n\r\n{349}  Scallawag, from the Gaelic _scallag_, a vagabond.--_D.\r\nMacRitchie_.\r\n\r\n{372}  For _depuisse-quand_, _vide_ Paul de Kock.\r\n\r\n{373}  On due reflection, I believe that I have here had a slip of\r\nmemory.  I was not till after a year, when returning from Italy, that\r\nthese incidents occurred.  But as it is all strictly true in every\r\ndetail, I let it remain, as of little consequence.",
