I suppose\r\nthat is because there are so many difficulties in the way of one who would\r\nwrite an account of them. The chief of these is that of arrangement and\r\nclassification; the next is that of selection; the last that of coming to\r\na conclusion. I would ask those who read these pages, and have perhaps\r\nsome favourite inn they do not find mentioned or illustrated here, to\r\nremember that the merely picturesque inns that have no story, or anything\r\nbeyond their own picturesqueness to render them remarkable, are--let us be\r\nthankful for it!--still with us in great numbers, and that to have\r\nillustrated or mentioned even a tithe of them would have been impossible.\r\nI can think of no literary and artistic work more delightful than the\r\nquest of queer old rustic inns, but two stout volumes will probably be\r\nfound to contain as much on the subject as most people wish to know--and\r\nit is always open to anyone who does not find his own especial favourite\r\nhere to condemn the author for his ignorance, or, worse, for his perverted\r\ntaste._\r\n\r\n_As for methods, those are of the simplest. You start by knowing, ten\r\nyears beforehand, what you intend to produce; and incidentally, in the\r\ncourse of a busy literary life, collect, note, sketch, and make extracts\r\nfrom Heaven only knows how many musty literary dustbins and sloughs of\r\ndespond. Then, having reached the psychological moment when you must come\r\nto grips with the work, you sort that accumulation, and, mapping out\r\nEngland into tours, with inns strung like beads upon your itinerary, bring\r\nthe book, after some five thousand miles of travel, at last into being._\r\n\r\n_It should be added that very many inns are incidentally illustrated or\r\nreferred to in the series of books on great roads by the present writer;\r\nbut as those works dealing with Roads, another treating of the History of\r\nCoaching, and the present volumes are all part of one comprehensive plan\r\ndealing with the History of Travel in general, the allusions to inns in\r\nthe various road-books have but rarely been repeated; while it will be\r\nfound that if, in order to secure a representative number of inns, it has\r\nbeen, in some cases, found unavoidable to retrace old footsteps, new\r\nillustrations and new matter have, as a rule, been brought to bear._\r\n\r\n_The Old Inns of London have not been touched upon very largely, for most\r\nof them are, unhappily, gone. Only the few existing ones have been\r\ntreated, and then merely in association with others in the country. To\r\nwrite an account of the Old Inns of London would now be to discourse, in\r\nthe manner of an antiquary, on things that have ceased to be._\r\n\r\nCHARLES G.

England]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Inns of Old England!--how alluring and how inexhaustible a theme!\r\nWhen you set out to reckon up the number of those old inns that demand a\r\nmention, how vast a subject it is! For although the Vandal--identified\r\nhere with the brewer and the ground-landlord--has been busy in London and\r\nthe great centres of population, destroying many of those famous old\r\nhostelries our grandfathers knew and appreciated, and building in their\r\nstead “hotels” of the most grandiose and palatial kind, there are happily\r\nstill remaining to us a large number of the genuine old cosy haunts where\r\nthe traveller, stained with the marks of travel, may enter and take his\r\nease without being ashamed of his travel-stains or put out of countenance\r\nby the modish visitors of this complicated age, who dress usually as if\r\ngoing to a ball, and whose patronage has rung the death-knell of many an\r\ninn once quaint and curious, but now merely “replete with every modern\r\nconvenience.”\r\n\r\nI thank Heaven--and it is no small matter, for surely one may be thankful\r\nfor a good inn--that there yet remain many old inns in this Old England of\r\nours, and that it is not yet quite (although nearly) a misdemeanour for\r\nthe wayfarer to drink a tankard of ale and eat a modest lunch of bread and\r\ncheese in a stone-flagged, sanded rustic parlour; or even, having come at\r\nthe close of day to his halting-place, to indulge in the mild dissipation\r\nand local gossip in the bar of an old-time hostelry.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the last surviving joys of travel in these strange times\r\nwhen you journey from great towns for sake of change and find at every\r\nresort that the town has come down before you, in the shape of an hotel\r\nmore or less palatial, wherein you are expected to dine largely off\r\npolished marble surroundings and Turkey carpets, and where every trace of\r\nlocal colour is effaced. A barrier is raised there between yourself and\r\nthe place. You are in it, but not of it or among it; but something alien,\r\nlike the German or Swiss waiters themselves, the manager, and the very\r\ndirectors and shareholders of the big concern.\r\n\r\nAt the old-fashioned inn, on the other hand, the whole establishment is\r\neloquent of the place, and while you certainly get less show and glitter,\r\nyou do, at any rate, find real comfort, and early realise that you have\r\nfound that change for which you have come.\r\n\r\nBut, as far as mere name goes, most inns are “hotels” nowadays. It is as\r\nthough innkeepers were labouring under the illusion that “inn” connotes\r\nsomething inferior, and “hotel” a superior order of things. Even along the\r\nroads, in rustic situations, the mere word “inn”--an ancient and entirely\r\nhonourable title--is become little used or understood, and, generally\r\nspeaking, if you ask a rustic for the next “inn” he stares vacantly before\r\nhis mind grasps the fact that you mean what he calls a “pub,” or, in some\r\ndistricts oftener still, a “house.” Just a “house.” Some employment for\r\nthe speculative mind is offered by the fact that in rural England an inn\r\nis “a house” and the workhouse “_the_ House.” Both bulk largely in the\r\nbucolic scheme of existence, and, as a temperance lecturer might point\r\nout, constant attendance at the one leads inevitably to the other. At all\r\nevents, both are great institutions, and prominent among the landmarks of\r\nOld England.\r\n\r\nWhich is the oldest, and which the most picturesque, inn this England of\r\nours can show? That is a double-barrelled question whose first part no man\r\ncan answer, and the reply to whose second half depends so entirely upon\r\nindividual likings and preferences that one naturally hesitates before\r\nbeing drawn into the contention that would surely arise on any particular\r\none being singled out for that supreme honour. Equally with the morning\r\nnewspapers--and the evening--each claiming the “largest circulation,” and,\r\nlike the several Banbury Cake shops, each the “original,” there are\r\nseveral “oldest licensed” inns, and very many arrogating the reputation of\r\nthe “most picturesque.”\r\n\r\nThe “Fighting Cocks” inn at St. Albans, down by the river Ver, below the\r\nAbbey, claims to be--not the oldest inn--but the oldest inhabited house,\r\nin the kingdom: a pretension that does not appear to be based on anything\r\nmore than sheer impudence; unless, indeed, we take the claim to be a joke,\r\nto which an inscription,\r\n\r\n  The Old Round House,\r\n  Rebuilt after the Flood,\r\n\r\nformerly gave the clue. But that has disappeared. The Flood, in this case,\r\nseeing that the building lies low, by the river Ver, does not necessarily\r\nmean the Deluge.\r\n\r\nThis curious little octagonal building is, however, of a very great age,\r\nfor it was once, as “St. Germain’s Gate,” the water-gate of the monastery.\r\nThe more ancient embattled upper part disappeared six hundred years ago,\r\nand the present brick-and-timber storey takes its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLDEST INHABITED HOUSE IN ENGLAND: THE “FIGHTING\r\nCOCKS,” ST. ALBANS.]\r\n\r\nThe City of London’s oldest licensed inn is, by its own claiming, the\r\n“Dick Whittington,” in Cloth Fair, Smithfield, but it only claims to have\r\nbeen licensed in the fifteenth century, when it might reasonably--without\r\nmuch fear of contradiction--have made it a century earlier. This is an\r\nunusual modesty, fully deserving mention. It is only an “inn” by courtesy,\r\nfor, however interesting and picturesque the grimy, tottering old\r\nlath-and-plaster house may be to the stranger, imagination does not\r\npicture any one staying either in the house or in Cloth Fair itself while\r\nother houses and other neighbourhoods remain to choose from; and, indeed,\r\nthe “Dick Whittington” does not pretend to be anything else than a\r\npublic-house. The quaint little figure at the angle, in the gloom of the\r\noverhanging upper storey, is one of the queer, unconventional imaginings\r\nof our remote forefathers, and will repay examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “DICK WHITTINGTON,” CLOTH FAIR.]\r\n\r\nOur next claimant in the way of antiquity is the “Seven Stars” inn at\r\nManchester, a place little dreamt of, in such a connection, by most\r\npeople; for, although Manchester is an ancient city, it is so modernised\r\nin general appearance that it is a place wherein the connoisseur of\r\nold-world inns would scarce think of looking for examples. Yet it contains\r\nthree remarkably picturesque old taverns, and the neighbouring town of\r\nSalford, nearly as much a part of Manchester as Southwark is of London,\r\npossesses another. To take the merely picturesque, unstoried houses\r\nfirst: these are the “Bull’s Head,” Greengate, Salford; the “Wellington”\r\ninn, in the Market-place, Manchester; the tottering, crazy-looking tavern\r\ncalled “Ye Olde Rover’s Return,” on Shude Hill, claiming to be the “oldest\r\nbeer-house in the city,” and additionally said once to have been an old\r\nfarmhouse “where the Cow was kept that supplied Milk to The Men who built\r\nthe ‘Seven Stars,’” and lastly--but most important--the famous “Seven\r\nStars” itself, in Withy Grove, proudly bearing on its front the statement\r\nthat it has been licensed over 560 years, and is the oldest licensed house\r\nin Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “YE OLDE ROVER’S RETURN,” MANCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nThe “Seven Stars” is of the same peculiar old-world construction as the\r\nother houses just enumerated, and is just a humble survival of the ancient\r\nrural method of building in this district: with a stout framing of oaken\r\ntimbers and a filling of rag-stone, brick, and plaster. Doubtless all\r\nManchester, of the period to which these survivals belong, was of like\r\narchitecture. It was a method of construction in essence identical with\r\nthe building of modern steel-framed houses and offices in England and in\r\nAmerica: modern construction being only on a larger scale. In either\r\nperiod, the framework of wood or of metal is set up first and then clothed\r\nwith its architectural features, whether of stone, brick, or plaster.\r\n\r\nThe “Seven Stars,” however, is no skyscraper. So far from soaring, it is\r\nof only two floors, and, placed as it is--sandwiched as it is, one might\r\nsay--between grim, towering blocks of warehouses, looks peculiarly\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose the existing house to have been built somewhere about 1500,\r\nalthough there is nothing in its rude walls and rough axe-hewn timbers to\r\nfix the period to a century more or less. At any rate, it is not the\r\noriginal “Seven Stars” on this spot, known to have been first licensed in\r\n1356, three years after inns and alehouses were inquired into and\r\nregulated, under Edward the Third; by virtue of which record, duly\r\nattested by the archives of the County Palatine of Lancaster, the present\r\nbuilding claims to be the “oldest Licensed House in Great Britain.”\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of very fine, unreliable “history” about the “Seven\r\nStars,” and some others, but it is quite true that the inn is older than\r\nManchester Cathedral, for that--originally the Collegiate Church--was not\r\nfounded until 1422; and topers with consciences remaining to them may lay\r\nthe flattering unction to their souls that, if they pour libations here,\r\nin the Temple of Bacchus, rather than praying in the Cathedral, they do,\r\nat any rate (if there be any virtue in that), frequent a place of greater\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nAnd antiquity is cultivated with care and considerable success at the\r\n“Seven Stars,” as a business asset. The house issues a set of seven\r\npicture-postcards, showing its various “historic” nooks and corners, and\r\nthe leaded window-casements have even been artfully painted, in an effort\r\nto make the small panes look smaller than they really are; while the\r\nunwary visitor in the low-ceilinged rooms falls over and trips up against\r\nall manner of unexpected steps up and steps down.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, not to be supposed that a house with so long a past\r\nshould be without its legends, and in the cellars the credulous and\r\nuncritical stranger is shown an archway that, he is told, led to old\r\nOrdsall Hall and the Collegiate Church! What thirsty and secret souls they\r\nmust have been in that old establishment! But the secret passage is\r\nblocked up now. Here we may profitably meditate awhile on those “secret\r\npassages” that have no secrets and afford no passage; and may at the same\r\ntime stop to admire the open conduct of that clergyman who, despising such\r\nunderhand and underground things, was accustomed in 1571, according to the\r\nrecords of the Court Leet, to step publicly across the way in his\r\nsurplice, in sermon-time, for a refreshing drink.\r\n\r\n“What stories this old Inn could recount if it had the power of language!”\r\nexclaims the leaflet sold at the “Seven Stars” itself. The reflection is\r\nsufficiently trite and obvious. What stories could not any building tell,\r\nif it were so gifted? But fortunately, although walls metaphorically have\r\nears, they have not--even in literary imagery--got tongues, and so cannot\r\nblab. And well too, for if they could and did, what a cloud of witness\r\nthere would be, to be sure. Not an one of us would get a hearing, and not\r\na soul be safe.\r\n\r\nBut what stories, in more than one sense, Harrison Ainsworth told! He told\r\na tale of Guy Fawkes, in which that hero of the mask, the dark-lantern and\r\nthe powder-barrel escaped, and made his way to the “Seven Stars,” to be\r\nconcealed in a room now called “Ye Guy Fawkes Chamber.” Ye gods!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLDEST LICENSED HOUSE IN GREAT BRITAIN: THE “SEVEN\r\nSTARS,” MANCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nWe know perfectly well that he did not escape, and so was not concealed in\r\na house to which he could not come, but--well, there! Such fantastic\r\ntales, adopted by the house, naturally bring suspicion upon all else; and\r\nthe story of the horse-shoe upon one of its wooden posts is therefore,\r\nrightly or wrongly, suspect. This is a legend that tells how, in 1805,\r\nwhen we were at war with Napoleon, the Press Gang was billeted at the\r\n“Seven Stars,” and seized a farmer’s servant who was leading a horse with\r\na cast shoe along Withy Grove. The Press Gang could not legally press a\r\nfarm-servant, but that probably mattered little, and he was led away; but,\r\nbefore he went, he nailed the cast horse-shoe to a post, exclaiming, “Let\r\nthis stay till I come from the wars to claim it!” He never returned, and\r\nthe horse-shoe remains in its place to this day.\r\n\r\nThe room adjoining the Bar parlour is called nowadays the “Vestry.” It\r\nwas, according to legends, the meeting-place of the Watch, in the old days\r\nbefore the era of police; and there they not only met, but stayed, the\r\ncaptain ever and again rising, with the words, “Now we will have another\r\nglass, and then go our rounds”; upon which, emptying their glasses, they\r\nall would walk round the tables and then re-seat themselves.\r\n\r\nA great deal of old Jacobean and other furniture has been collected, to\r\nfill the rooms of the “Seven Stars,” and in the “Vestry” is the “cupboard\r\nthat has never been opened” within the memory of living man. It is\r\nevidently not suspected of holding untold gold. Relics from the New Bailey\r\nPrison, demolished in 1872, are housed here, including the doors of the\r\ncondemned cell, and sundry leg-irons; and genuine Carolean and Cromwellian\r\ntables are shown. The poet who wrote of some marvellously omniscient\r\npersonage--\r\n\r\n  And still the wonder grew\r\n  That one small head could carry all he knew,\r\n\r\nwould have rejoiced to know the “Seven Stars,” and might have been moved\r\nto write a similar couplet, on how much so small a house could be made to\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT HISTORY OF INNS\r\n\r\n\r\nInns, hotels, public-houses of all kinds, have a very ancient lineage, but\r\nwe need not in this place go very deeply into their family history, or\r\nstodge ourselves with fossilised facts at the outset. So far as we are\r\nconcerned, inns begin with the Roman Conquest of Britain, for it is absurd\r\nto suppose that the Britons, whom Julius Cæsar conquered, drank beer or\r\nrequired hotel accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe colonising Romans themselves, of course, were used to inns, and when\r\nthey covered Britain with a system of roads, hostelries and mere\r\ndrinking-places of every kind sprang up beside them, for the accommodation\r\nand refreshment alike of soldiers and civilians. There is no reason to\r\nsuppose that the Roman legionary was a less thirsty soul than the modern\r\nsoldier, and therefore houses that resembled our beer-shops and rustic\r\ninns must have been sheer necessaries. There was then the _bibulium_,\r\nwhere the bibulous boozed to their hearts’ content; and there were the\r\n_diversoria_ and _caupones_, the inns or hotels, together with the\r\nposting-houses along the roads, known as _mansiones_ or _stabulia_.\r\n\r\nThe _bibulium_, that is to say, the ale-house or tavern, displayed its\r\nsign for all men to see: the ivy-garland, or wreath of vine-leaves, in\r\nhonour of Bacchus, wreathed around a hoop at the end of a projecting pole.\r\nThis bold advertisment of good drink to be had within long outlasted Roman\r\ntimes, and indeed still survives in differing forms, in the signs of\r\nexisting inns. It became the “ale-stake” of Anglo-Saxon and middle English\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe traveller recognised the ale-stake at a great distance, by reason of\r\nits long pole--the “stake” whence those old beer-houses derived their\r\nname--projecting from the house-front, with its mass of furze, or garland\r\nof flowers, or ivy-wreath, dangling at the end. But the ale-houses that\r\nsold good drink little needed such signs, a circumstance that early led to\r\nthe old proverb, “Good wine needs no bush.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we may well suppose the places that sold only inferior\r\nswipes required poles very long and bushes very prominent, and in London,\r\nwhere competition was great, all ale-stakes early began to vie with one\r\nanother which should in this manner first attract the attention of thirsty\r\nfolk. This at length grew to be such a nuisance, and even a danger, that\r\nin 1375 a law was passed that all taverners in the City of London owning\r\nale-stakes projecting or extending over the king’s highway “more than\r\nseven feet in length at the utmost,” should be fined forty pence and be\r\ncompelled to remove the offending sign.\r\n\r\nWe find the “ale-stake” in Chaucer, whose “Pardoner” could not be induced\r\nto commence his tale until he had quenched his thirst at one:\r\n\r\n  But first quod he, her at this ale-stake\r\n  I will bothe drynke and byten on a cake.\r\n\r\nWe have, fortunately, in the British Museum, an illustration of such a\r\nhouse, done in the fourteenth century, and therefore contemporary with\r\nChaucer himself. It is rough but vivid, and if the pilgrim we see drinking\r\nout of a saucer-like cup be gigantic, and the landlady, waiting with the\r\njug, a thought too big for her inn, we are at any rate clearly made to see\r\nthe life of that long ago. In this instance the actual stake is finished\r\noff like a besom, rather than with a bush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ALE-STAKE. _From the Louterell Psalter._]\r\n\r\nThe connection, however, between the Roman garland to Bacchus and the\r\nmediæval “bush” is obvious. The pagan God of Wine was forgotten, but the\r\nadvertisment of ale “sold on the premises” was continued in much the same\r\nform; for in many cases the “bush” was a wreath, renewed at intervals, and\r\ntwined around a permanent hoop. With the creation, in later centuries, of\r\ndistinctive signs, we find the hoop itself curiously surviving as a\r\nframework for some device; and thus, even as early as the reign of Edward\r\nthe Third, mention is found of a “George-in-the-hoop,” probably a picture\r\nor carved representation of St. George, the cognisance of England, engaged\r\nin slaying the dragon. There were inns in the time of Henry the Sixth by\r\nthe name of the “Cock-in-the-Hoop”; and doubtless the representation of\r\nhaughty cockerels in that situation led by degrees to persons of\r\nself-sufficient manner being called “Cock-a-hoop,” an old-fashioned phrase\r\nthat lingered on until some few years since.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, when the garland was no longer renewed, and no distinctive\r\nsign filled the hoop, the “Hoop” itself became the sign of the house: a\r\nsign still frequently to be met with, notably at Cambridge, where a house\r\nof that name, in coaching days a celebrated hostelry, still survives.\r\n\r\nThe kind of company found in the ale-stakes--that is to say, the\r\nbeer-houses and taverns--of the fourteenth century is vividly portrayed by\r\nLangland, in his _Vision of Piers Plowman_. In that long Middle English\r\npoem, the work of a moralist and seer who was at the same time, beneath\r\nhis tonsure and in spite of his orders, something of a man of the world,\r\nwe find the virtuous ploughman reviewing the condition of society in that\r\nera, and (when you have once become used to the ancient spelling) doing so\r\nin a manner that is not only readable to moderns, but even entertaining;\r\nwhile, of course, as evidence of social conditions close upon six hundred\r\nyears ago, the poem is invaluable.\r\n\r\nWe learn how Beton the brewster met the glutton on his way to church, and\r\nbidding him “good-morrow,” asked him whither he went.\r\n\r\n“To holy church,” quoth he, “for to hear mass. I will be shriven, and sin\r\nno more.”\r\n\r\n“I have good ale, gossip,” says the ale-wife, “will you assay it?” And so\r\nglutton, instead of going to church, takes himself to the ale-house, and\r\nmany after him. A miscellaneous company that was. There, with Cicely the\r\nwoman-shoemaker, were all manner of humble, and some disreputable,\r\npersons, among whom we are surprised to find a hermit. What should a\r\nhermit be doing in an ale-house? But, according to Langland’s own showing\r\nelsewhere, the country was infested with hermits who, refusing restriction\r\nto their damp and lonely hermitages, frequented the alehouses, and only\r\nwent home, generally intoxicated, to their mouldy pallets after they had\r\ndrunk and eaten their fill and roasted themselves before the fire.\r\n\r\nHere, then:\r\n\r\n  Cesse the souteresse[1] sat on the bench,\r\n  Watte the warner[2] and hys wyf bothe\r\n  Thomme the tynkere, and tweye of hus knaues,\r\n  Hicke the hakeneyman, and Houwe the neldere,[3]\r\n  Claryce of Cockeslane, the clerk of the churche,\r\n  An haywarde and an heremyte, the hangeman of Tyborne,\r\n  Dauwe the dykere,[4] with a dozen harlotes,\r\n  Of portours and of pyke-porses, and pylede[5] toth-drawers.\r\n  A ribibour,[6] a ratonere,[7] a rakyer of chepe,\r\n  A roper, a redynkyng,[8] and Rose the dissheres,\r\n  Godfrey of garlekehythe, and gryfin the walshe,[9]\r\n  An vpholderes an hepe.\r\n\r\nAll day long they sat there, boozing, chaffering, and quarrelling:\r\n\r\n  There was laughing and louring, and “let go the cuppe,”\r\n  And seten so till euensonge and son gen vmwhile,\r\n  Tyl glotoun had y-globbed a galoun and a Iille.\r\n\r\nBy that time he could neither walk nor stand. He took his staff and began\r\nto go like a gleeman’s bitch, sometimes sideways and sometimes backwards.\r\nWhen he had come to the door, he stumbled and fell. Clement the cobbler\r\ncaught him by the middle and set him on his knees, and then, “with all the\r\nwoe of the world” his wife and his wench came to carry him home to bed.\r\nThere he slept all Saturday and Sunday, and when at last he woke, he woke\r\nwith a thirst--how modern _that_ is, at any rate! The first words he\r\nuttered were, “Where is the bowl?”\r\n\r\nA hundred and fifty years later than _Piers Plowman_ we get another\r\npicture of an English ale-house, by no less celebrated a poet. This famous\r\nhouse, the “Running Horse,” still stands at Leatherhead, in Surrey, beside\r\nthe long, many-arched bridge that there crosses the river Mole at one of\r\nits most picturesque reaches. It was kept in the time of Henry the Seventh\r\nby that very objectionable landlady, Elynor Rummyng, whose peculiarities\r\nare the subject of a laureate’s verse. Elynor Rummyng, and John Skelton,\r\nthe poet-laureate who hymned her person, her beer, and her customers, both\r\nflourished in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Skelton, whose\r\ngenius was wholly satiric, no doubt, in his _Tunning_ (that is to say, the\r\nbrewing) of _Elynor Rummyng_, emphasised all her bad points, for it is\r\nhardly credible that even the rustics of the Middle Ages would have rushed\r\nso enthusiastically for her ale if it had been brewed in the way he\r\ndescribes.\r\n\r\nHis long, rambling jingles, done in grievous spelling, picture her as a\r\nvery ugly and filthy old person, with a face sufficiently grotesque to\r\nunnerve a strong man:\r\n\r\n  For her viságe\r\n  It would aswage\r\n  A manne’s couráge.\r\n  Her lothely lere\r\n  Is nothyng clere,\r\n  But vgly of chere,\r\n  Droupy and drowsy,\r\n  Scuruy and lowsy;\r\n  Her face all bowsy,\r\n  Comely crynkled,\r\n  Woundersly wrynkled,\r\n  Lyke a rost pygges eare\r\n  Brystled wyth here.\r\n      Her lewde lyppes twayne,\r\n  They slauer, men sayne,\r\n  Lyke a ropy rayne:\r\n  A glummy glayre:\r\n  She is vgly fayre:\r\n  Her nose somdele hoked,\r\n  And camously croked,\r\n  Neuer stoppynge,\r\n  But euer droppynge:\r\n  Her skin lose and slacke,\r\n  Grayned like a sacke;\r\n  Wyth a croked backe.\r\n      Her eyen jowndy\r\n  Are full vnsoundy,\r\n  For they are blered;\r\n  And she grey-hered:\r\n  Jawed like a jetty,\r\n  A man would haue pytty\r\n  To se how she is gumbed\r\n  Fyngered and thumbed\r\n  Gently joynted,\r\n  Gresed and annoynted\r\n  Vp to the knockels;\r\n  The bones of her huckels\r\n  Lyke as they were with buckles\r\n  Together made fast;\r\n      Her youth is farre past.\r\n  Foted lyke a plane,\r\n  Legged lyke a crane;\r\n  And yet she wyll iet\r\n  Lyke a silly fet.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Her huke of Lincoln grene,\r\n  It had been hers I wene,\r\n  More than fourty yere;\r\n  And so it doth apere.\r\n  For the grene bare thredes\r\n  Loke lyke sere wedes,\r\n  Wyddered lyke hay,\r\n  The woll worne away:\r\n  And yet I dare saye\r\n  She thinketh herselfe gaye.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  She dryueth downe the dewe\r\n  With a payre of heles\r\n  As brode as two wheles;\r\n  She hobles as a gose\r\n  Wyth her blanket trose\r\n  Ouer the falowe:\r\n  Her shone smered wyth talowe,\r\n  Gresed vpon dyrt\r\n  That bandeth her skyrt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELYNOR RUMMYNG.]\r\n\r\n  And this comely dame\r\n  I vnderstande her name\r\n  Is Elynor Rummynge,\r\n  At home in her wonnynge:\r\n  And as men say,\r\n  She dwelt in Sothray,\r\n  In a certain stede\r\n  Bysyde Lederhede,\r\n  She is a tonnysh gyb,\r\n  The Deuyll and she be syb,\r\n  But to make vp my tale,\r\n  She breweth nappy ale,\r\n  And maketh port-sale\r\n  To travelers and tynkers,\r\n  To sweters and swynkers,\r\n  And all good ale-drynkers,\r\n  That wyll nothynge spare,\r\n  But drynke tyll they stare\r\n  And brynge themselves bare,\r\n  Wyth, now away the mare\r\n  And let vs sley care\r\n  As wyse as a hare.\r\n      Come who so wyll\r\n  To Elynor on the hyll\r\n  Wyth Fyll the cup, fyll\r\n  And syt there by styll.\r\n  Erly and late\r\n  Thyther cometh Kate\r\n  Cysly, and Sare\r\n  Wyth theyr legges bare\r\n  And also theyr fete.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Some haue no mony\r\n  For theyr ale to pay,\r\n  That is a shrewd aray;\r\n  Elynor swered, Nay,\r\n  Ye shall not beare away\r\n  My ale for nought,\r\n  By hym that me bought!\r\n  Wyth, Hey, dogge, hey,\r\n  Haue these hogges away[10]\r\n  Wyth, Get me a staffe,\r\n  The swyne eate my draffe!\r\n  Stryke the hogges wyth a clubbe,\r\n  They haue dranke up my swyllyn tubbe.\r\n\r\nThe unlovely Elynor scraped up all manner of filth into her mash-tub,\r\nmixed it together with her “mangy fists,” and sold the result as ale. It\r\nis proverbial that “there is no accounting for tastes,” and it would\r\nappear as though the district had a peculiar liking for this kind of brew.\r\nThey would have it somehow, even if they had to bring their food and\r\nfurniture for it:\r\n\r\n  Insteede of quoyne and mony,\r\n  Some bryng her a coney,\r\n  And some a pot wyth honey;\r\n  Some a salt, some a spoone,\r\n  Some theyr hose, some theyr shoone;\r\n  Some run a good trot\r\n  Wyth skyllet or pot:\r\n  Some fyll a bag-full\r\n  Of good Lemster wool;\r\n  An huswyfe of trust\r\n  When she is athyrst\r\n  Such a web can spyn\r\n  Her thryft is full thyn.\r\n      Some go strayght thyther\r\n  Be it slaty or slydder,\r\n  They hold the hyghway;\r\n  They care not what men say,\r\n  Be they as be may\r\n  Some loth to be espyd,\r\n  Start in at the backesyde,\r\n  Over hedge and pale,\r\n  And all for good ale.\r\n  Some brought walnuts,\r\n  Some apples, some pears,\r\n  And some theyr clyppying shears.\r\n  Some brought this and that,\r\n  Some brought I wot ne’re what,\r\n  Some brought theyr husband’s hat.\r\n\r\nand so forth, for hundreds of lines more.\r\n\r\nThe old inn--still nothing more than an ale-house--is in part as old as\r\nthe poem, but has been so patched and repaired in all the intervening\r\ncenturies that nothing of any note is to be seen within. A very old\r\npictorial sign, framed and glazed, and fixed against the wall of the\r\ngable, represents the ill-favoured landlady, and is inscribed: “Elynor\r\nRummyn dwelled here, 1520.”\r\n\r\nAccounts we have of the fourteenth-century inns show that the exclusive,\r\nsolitary Englishman was not then allowed to exist. Guests slept in\r\ndormitories, very much as the inmates of common lodging-houses generally\r\ndo now, and, according to the evidence of old prints, knew nothing of\r\nnightshirts, and lay in bed naked. They purchased their food in something\r\nthe same way as a modern “dosser” in a Rowton House, but their manners and\r\ncustoms were peculiarly offensive. The floors were strewed with rushes;\r\nand as guests generally threw their leavings there, and the rushes\r\nthemselves were not frequently removed, those old interiors must have been\r\nat times exceptionally noisome.\r\n\r\nInn-keepers charged such high prices for this accommodation, and for the\r\nprovisions they sold, that the matter grew scandalous, and at last, in the\r\nreign of Edward the Third, in 1349, and again in 1353, statutes were\r\npassed ordering hostelries to be content with moderate gain. The “great\r\nand outrageous dearth of victuals kept up in all the realm by innkeepers\r\nand other retailers of victuals, to the great detriment of the people\r\ntravelling across the realm” was such that no less a penalty would serve\r\nthan that any “hosteler or herberger” should pay “double of what he\r\nreceived to the party damnified.” Mayors and bailiffs, and justices\r\nlearned in the law, were to “enquire in all places, of all and singular,\r\nof the deeds and outrages of hostelers and their kind,” but it does not\r\nappear that matters were greatly improved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “RUNNING HORSE,” LEATHERHEAD.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that two classes of innkeepers are specified in those\r\nordinances. The “hosteler” was the ordinary innkeeper; the “herberger” was\r\ngenerally a more or less important and well-to-do merchant who added to\r\nhis income by “harbouring”--that is to say, by boarding and\r\nlodging--strangers, the “paying guests” of that age. We may dimly perceive\r\nsomething of the trials and hardships of old-time travel in that\r\nexpression “harbouring.” The traveller then came to his rest as a ship\r\ncomes into harbour from stormy seas. The better-class travellers, coming\r\ninto a town, preferred the herberger’s more select table to the common\r\npublicity of the ordinary hostelry, and the herbergers themselves were\r\nvery keen to obtain such guests, some even going to the length of\r\nmaintaining touts to watch the arrival of strangers, and bid for custom.\r\nThis was done both openly and in an underhand fashion, the more rapacious\r\namong the herbergers employing specious rogues who, entering into\r\nconversation with likely travellers at the entrance of a town, would\r\npretend to be fellow-countrymen and so, on the understanding of a common\r\nsympathy, recommending them to what they represented to be the best\r\nlodgings. Travellers taking such recommendations generally found\r\nthemselves in exceptionally extortionate hands. These practices early led\r\nto “herbergers” being regulated by law, on much the same basis as the\r\nhostelers.\r\n\r\nNot many records of travelling across England in the fourteenth century\r\nhave survived. Indeed the only detailed one we have, and that is merely a\r\nreturn of expenses, surviving in Latin manuscript at Merton College,\r\nOxford, concerns itself with nothing but the cost of food and lodging at\r\nthe inns and the disbursements on the road, made by the Warden and two\r\nfellows who, with four servants--the whole party on horseback--in\r\nSeptember, 1331, travelled to Durham and back on business connected with\r\nthe college property. The outward journey took them twelve days. They\r\ncrossed the Humber at the cost of 8_d._, to the ferry: beds for the entire\r\nparty of seven generally came to 2_d._ a night, beer the same, wine\r\n1¼_d._, meat 5½_d._, candles ¼_d._, fuel 2_d._, bread 4_d._, and fodder\r\nfor the horses 10_d._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGENERAL HISTORY OF INNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mediæval hostelries, generally planned in the manner of the old\r\ngalleried inns that finally went out of fashion with the end of the\r\ncoaching age, consisting of a building enclosing a courtyard, and entered\r\nonly by a low and narrow archway, which in its turn was closed at\r\nnightfall by strong, bolt-studded doors, are often said to owe their form\r\nto the oriental “caravanserai,” a type of building familiar to Englishmen\r\ntaking part in the Crusades.\r\n\r\nBut it is surely not necessary to go so far afield for an origin. The\r\n“caravanserai” was originally a type of Persian inn where caravans put up\r\nfor the night: and as security against robbers was the first need of such\r\na country and such times, a courtyard capable of being closed when\r\nnecessary against unwelcome visitors was clearly indicated as essential.\r\nPersia, however, and oriental lands in general, were not the only\r\ncountries where in those dark centuries robbers, numerous and bold, or\r\neven such undesirables as rebels against the existing order of things,\r\nwere to be reckoned with, and England had no immunity from such dangers.\r\nIn such a state of affairs, and in times when private citizens were\r\ncareful always to bolt and bar themselves in; when great lords dwelt\r\nbehind moats, drawbridges, and battlemented walls; and when even\r\necclesiastic and collegiate institutions were designed with the idea that\r\nthey might ultimately have to be defended, it is quite reasonable to\r\nsuppose that innkeepers were capable of evolving a plan for themselves by\r\nwhich they and their guests, and the goods of their guests, might reckon\r\non a degree of security.\r\n\r\nThis was the type of hostelry that, apart from the mere tavern, or\r\nalehouse, remained for so many centuries typical of the English good-class\r\ninns. It was at once, in a sense--to compare old times with new--the hotel\r\nand railway-station of an age that knew neither railways nor the class of\r\nhouse we style “hotel.” It was the fine flower of the hostelling business,\r\nand to it came and went the carriers’ waggons, the early travellers riding\r\nhorseback, and, in the course of time, as the age of wonderful inventions\r\nbegan to dawn, the stage and mail-coaches. Travellers of the most gentle\r\nbirth, equally with those rich merchants and clothiers who were the\r\ngreatest travellers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, inned at\r\nsuch establishments. It was at one such that Archbishop Leighton ended. He\r\nhad said, years before, that “if he must choose a place to die in, it\r\nshould be an inn, it looking like a pilgrim’s going home, to whom this\r\nworld was an inn, and who was weary of the noise and confusion of it.” He\r\ndied, that good and gentle man, at the “Bell” in Warwick Lane, in 1684.\r\n\r\nLondon, once rich in hostelries of this type, has now but one. In fine, it\r\nis not in the metropolis that the amateur of old inns of any kind would\r\nnowadays seek with great success; although, well within the memory of most\r\npeople, it was exceptionally well furnished with them. It was neither good\r\ntaste nor good business that, in 1897, demolished the “Old Bell,” Holborn,\r\na pretty old-world galleried inn that maintained until the very last an\r\nexcellent trade in all branches of licensed-victualling; and would have\r\ncontinued so to do had it not been that the greed for higher ground-rent\r\nordained the ending of it, in favour of the giant (and very vulgar)\r\nbuilding now occupying the spot where it stood. That may have been a\r\nremunerative transaction for the ground-landlord; but, looking at these\r\ncommercial-minded clearances in a broader way, they are nothing less than\r\ndisastrous. If, to fill some private purses over-full, you thus callously\r\nrebuild historic cities, their history becomes merely a matter for the\r\nprinted page, and themselves to the eye nothing but a congeries of crowded\r\nstreets where the motor-omnibuses scream and clash and stink, and citizens\r\nhustle to get a living. History, without visible ancient buildings to\r\nassure the sceptical modern traveller that it is not wholly lies, will\r\nnever by itself draw visitors.\r\n\r\nHolborn, where the “Old Bell” stood, was, until quite recent years, a\r\npleasant threshold to the City. There stood Furnival’s Inn, that quiet\r\nquadrangle of chambers, with the staid and respectable Wood’s Hotel. Next\r\ndoor was Ridler’s Hotel, with pleasant bay-window looking upon the street,\r\nand across the way, in Fetter Lane, remained the “White Horse” coaching\r\ninn; very much down on its luck in its last years, but interesting to\r\nprowling strangers enamoured of the antique and out-of-date.\r\n\r\nThe vanished interest of other corners in London might be enlarged upon,\r\nbut it is too melancholy a picture. Let us to the Borough High Street,\r\nand, resolutely refusing to think for the moment of the many queer old\r\ngalleried inns that not so long since remained there, come to that sole\r\nsurvivor, the “George.”\r\n\r\nYou would never by mere chance find the “George,” for it has no frontage\r\nto the street, and lies along one side of a yard not at first sight very\r\nprepossessing, and, in fact, used in these days for the unsentimental\r\npurposes of a railway goods-receiving depot. This, however, is the old\r\nyard once entirely in use for the business of the inn.\r\n\r\nThe “George,” as it now stands, is the successor of a pre-Reformation inn\r\nthat, formerly the “St. George,” became secularised in the time of Henry\r\nthe Eighth, when saints, even patron saints, were under a cloud. It is an\r\nexceedingly long range of buildings, dating from the seventeenth century,\r\nand in two distinct and different styles: a timbered, wooden-balustraded\r\ngallery in two storeys, and a white-washed brick continuation. The long\r\nground-floor range of windows to the kitchen, the bar, and the\r\ncoffee-room, is, as seen in the illustration, protected from any accidents\r\nin the manœuvring of the railway waggons by a continuous bulkhead of\r\nsleepers driven into the ground. It is pleasing to be able to bear witness\r\nto the thriving trade that continues to be done in this sole ancient\r\nsurvivor of the old Southwark galleried inns, and to note that, however\r\nharshly fate, as personified by rapacious landlords, has dealt with its\r\nkind, the old-world savour of the inn is thoroughly appreciated by those\r\nnot generally thought sentimental persons, the commercial men who dine and\r\nlunch, and the commercial travellers who sleep, here.\r\n\r\nBut, however pleasing the old survivals in brick and stone, in timber and\r\nplaster, may be to the present generation, we seem, by the evidence left\r\nus in the literature and printed matter of an earlier age, to have\r\ntravelled far from gross to comparatively ideal manners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE OLD GALLERIED INNS OF LONDON: THE “GEORGE,”\r\nSOUTHWARK. _Photo by T. W. Tyrrell._]\r\n\r\nThe manners common to all classes in old times would scarce commend\r\nthemselves to modern folk. We get a curious glimpse of them in one of a\r\nnumber of Manuals of Foreign Conversation for the use of travellers,\r\npublished towards the close of the sixteenth century in Flanders, then a\r\ncountry of great trading importance, sending forth commercial travellers\r\nand others to many foreign lands. One of these handy books, styled, rather\r\nformidably, _Colloquia et dictionariolum septem linguarum_, including, as\r\nits title indicates, conversation in seven languages, was so highly\r\nsuccessful that seven editions of it, dating from 1589, are known. The\r\ntraveller in England, coming to his inn, is found talking on the subject\r\nof trade and civil wars, and at length desires to retire to rest. The\r\nconversation itself is sufficiently strange, and is made additionally\r\nstartling by the capital W’s that appear in unconventional places. “Sir,”\r\nsays the traveller, “by your leave, I am sum What euell at ease.” To which\r\nthe innkeeper replies: “Sir, if you be ill at ease, go and take your rest,\r\nyour chambre is readie. Jone, make a good fier in his chambre, and let him\r\nlacke nothing.”\r\n\r\nThen we have a dialogue with “Jone,” the chambermaid, in this wise:\r\n\r\n_Traveller_: My shee frinde, is my bed made? is it good?\r\n\r\n“Yea, Sir, it is a good feder bed, the scheetes be very cleane.”\r\n\r\n_Traveller_: I shake as a leafe upon the tree. Warme my kerchif and bynde\r\nmy head well. Soft, you binde it to harde, bryng my pilloW and cover mee\r\nWell: pull off my hosen and Warme my bed: draWe the curtines and pinthen\r\nWith a pin.\r\n\r\nWhere is the camber pot?\r\n\r\nWhere is the priuie?\r\n\r\n_Chambermaid_: FolloW mee, and I Will sheW you the Way: go up streight,\r\nyou shall finde them at the right hand. If you see them not you shall\r\nsmell them Well enough. Sir, doth it please you to haue no other thing?\r\nare you Wel?\r\n\r\n_Traveller_: Yea, my shee frinde, put out the candell, and come nearer to\r\nmee.\r\n\r\n_Chambermaid_: I Wil put it out When I am out of the chamber. What is your\r\npleasure, are you not Well enough yet?\r\n\r\n_Traveller_: My head lyeth to loWe, lift up a little the bolster, I can\r\nnot lie so loWe.--My shee friende, kisse me once, and I shall sleape the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n_Chambermaid_: Sleape, sleape, you are not sicke, seeing that you speake\r\nof kissyng. I had rather die then to kisse a man in his bed, or in any\r\nother place. Take your rest in God’s name, God geeue you good night and\r\ngoode rest.\r\n\r\n_Traveller_: I thank you, fayre mayden.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we have “Communication at the oprysing,” the traveller\r\ncalling to the boy to “Drie my shirt, that I may rise.” Then, “Where is\r\nthe horse-keeper? go tell him that hee my horse leade to the river.”\r\n\r\nDeparting, our traveller does not forget the chambermaid, and asks, “Where\r\nis ye maiden? hold my shee freend, ther is for your paines. Knave, bring\r\nhither my horse, have you dressed him Well?” “Yea, sir,” says the knave,\r\n“he did Wante nothing.”\r\n\r\nAnciently people of note and position, with large acquaintance among their\r\nown class, expected, when they travelled, to be received at the country\r\nhouses along their route, if they should so desire, and still, at the\r\nclose of the seventeenth century, and at the beginning of the eighteenth,\r\nthe custom was not unknown. Even should the master be away from home, the\r\nhospitality of his house was not usually withheld. From these old and\r\ndiscontinued customs we may, perhaps, derive that one by no means\r\nobsolete, but rather still on the increase, of guests “tipping” the\r\nservants of country houses.\r\n\r\nThis possibility of a traveller making use of another man’s house as his\r\ninn was fast dying out in England in the time of Charles the Second.\r\nProbably it had never been so abused in this country as in Scotland, where\r\ninnkeepers petitioned Parliament, complaining, in the extraordinary\r\nlanguage at that time obtaining in Scotland, “that the liegis travelland\r\nin the realme quhen they cum to burrowis and throuchfairís, herbreis thame\r\nnot in hostillaries, but with their acquaintance and friendis.”\r\n\r\nAn enactment was accordingly passed in 1425, forbidding, under a penalty\r\nof forty shillings, all travellers resorting to burgh towns to lodge with\r\nfriends or acquaintances, or in any place but the “hostillaries,” unless,\r\nindeed, they were persons of consequence, with a great retinue, in which\r\ncase they personally might accept the hospitality of friends, provided\r\nthat their “horse and meinze” were sent to the inns.\r\n\r\nWhen the custom of seeking the shelter, as a matter of course, of the\r\ncountry mansion fell into disuse, so, conversely, did that of naming inns\r\nafter the local Lord of the Manor come into fashion. Then, in a manner\r\nemblematic of the traveller’s change from the hospitality of the mansion\r\nto that of the inn, mine host adopted the heraldic coat from the great\r\nman’s portal, and called his house the “---- Arms.” It has been left to\r\nmodern times, times in which heraldry has long ceased to be an exact\r\nscience, to perpetrate such absurdities as the “Bricklayers’ Arms,” the\r\n“Drovers’ Arms,” and the like, appropriated to a class of person unknown\r\nofficially to the College of Heralds.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fynes Morison, who wrote in 1617, we held then, in this\r\ncountry, a pre-eminence in the trade and art of innkeeping: “The world,”\r\nhe said, “affords not such inns as England hath, for as soon as a\r\npassenger comes the servants run to him: one takes his horse, and walks\r\nhim till he be cold, then rubs him and gives him meat, but let the master\r\nlook to this point. Another gives the traveller his private chamber and\r\nkindles his fire, the third pulls off his boots and makes them clean; then\r\nthe host or hostess visits him--if he will eat with the host--or at a\r\ncommon table it will be 4_d._ and 6_d._ If a gentleman has his own\r\nchamber, his ways are consulted, and he has music, too, if he likes.”\r\n\r\nIn short, Morison wrote of English inns just anterior to the time of\r\nSamuel Pepys, who travelled much in his day, and tells us freely, in his\r\nappreciative way, of the excellent appointments, the music, the good fare\r\nand the comfortable beds he, in general, found.\r\n\r\nBut this era in which Morison wrote was a trying time for all innkeepers\r\nand taverners. The story of it is so remarkable that it repays a lengthy\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn our own age it is customary to many otherwise just and fair-minded\r\npeople to look upon the innkeeper as a son of a Belial, a sinner who\r\nshould be kept in outer darkness and made to sit in sackcloth and ashes,\r\nin penance for other people’s excesses. On the one side he has the\r\ncormorants of the Inland Revenue plucking out his vitals, and generally,\r\nif it be a “tied” house, on the other a Brewery Company, selling him the\r\nworst liquors at the best prices, and threatening to turn him out if he\r\ndoes not maintain a trade of so many barrels a month. Always, from the\r\nearliest times, he has been the mark for satire and invective, has been\r\nlicensed, sweated, regulated, and generally put on the chain; but he\r\nprobably had never so bad a time as that he experienced in the last years\r\nof James the First. Already innkeepers were licensed at Quarter Sessions,\r\nbut in 1616 it occurred to one Giles Mompesson, the time-serving Member of\r\nParliament for the rotten borough of Great Bedwin, in Wiltshire, that much\r\nplunder could be extracted from them and used to replenish the Royal\r\nExchequer, then at a low ebb, if he could obtain the grant of a monopoly\r\nof licensing inns, over-riding the old-established functions in that\r\ndirection of the magistrates.\r\n\r\nGiles Mompesson was no altruist, or at the best a perverted one, who put\r\nhis own interpretation upon that good old maxim, “Who works for others\r\nworks for himself.” He foresaw that while such a State monopoly, under\r\nhis own control, might bring a bountiful return to the State, it must\r\nenrich himself and those associated with him. He imparted the brilliant\r\nidea to that dissolute royal favourite, George Villiers, Duke of\r\nBuckingham, who succeeded in obtaining him a patent for a special\r\ncommission to grant licenses to keepers of inns and ale-houses. The patent\r\nwas issued, not without great opposition, and the licensing fees were left\r\nto the discretion of Mompesson and his two fellow-commissioners, with the\r\nonly proviso that four-fifths of the returns were to go to the Exchequer.\r\nShortly afterwards Mompesson himself was knighted by the King, in order,\r\nas Bacon wrote, “that he may better fight with the Bulls and the Bears and\r\nthe Saracen’s Heads, and such fearful creatures.” Much virtue and power,\r\nof the magisterial sort, in a knighthood; likely, we consider, King and\r\ncommissioners, and all concerned in the issuing of this patent, to impress\r\nand overawe poor Bung, and therefore we, James the First, most sacred\r\nMajesty by the grace of God, do, on Newmarket Heath, say, “Rise, Sir\r\nGiles!”\r\n\r\nThe three commissioners wielded full authority. There was no appeal from\r\nthat triumvirate, who at their will refused or granted licenses, and\r\ncharged for them what they pleased, hungering after that one-fifth. They\r\nlargely increased the number of inns, woefully oppressed honest men, wrung\r\nheavy fines from all for merely technical and inadvertent infractions of\r\nthe licensing laws, and granted new licenses at exorbitant rates to\r\ninfamous houses that had but recently been deprived of them. During more\r\nthan four years these iniquities continued, side by side with the working\r\nof other monopolies, granted from time to time, but at last the gathering\r\nstorm of indignation burst, in the House of Commons, in February, 1621.\r\nThat was a Parliament already working with the leaven of a Puritanism\r\nwhich was presently to leaven the whole lump of English governance in a\r\ndrastic manner then little dreamt of; and it was keen to scent and to\r\nabolish abuses.\r\n\r\nThus we see the House, very stern and vindictive, inquiring into the\r\nconduct and working of the by now notorious Commission. In the result\r\nMompesson and his associates were found to have prosecuted 3,320\r\ninnkeepers for technical infractions of obsolete statutes, and to have\r\nbeen guilty of many misdemeanours. Mompesson appealed to the mercy of the\r\nHouse, but was placed under arrest by the Sergeant-at-Arms while that\r\nassembly deliberated how it should act. Mompesson himself clearly expected\r\nto be severely dealt with, for at the earliest moment evaded his arrest\r\nand was off, across the Channel, where he learnt--no doubt with cynical\r\namusement--that he had been “banished.”\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the two Houses of Parliament was that he should be\r\nexpelled the House, and be degraded from his knighthood and conducted on\r\nhorseback along the Strand with his face to the horse’s tail. Further, he\r\nwas to be fined £10,000, and for ever held an infamous person.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, if Parliament failed to lay the chief offender by the heels, it\r\ndid at least succeed in putting hand upon, and detaining, one of his\r\nequally infamous associates, himself a knight, and accordingly susceptible\r\nof some dramatic degradation, beyond anything to be possibly wreaked upon\r\nany common fellow. Sir Francis Mitchell, attorney-at-law, was consigned to\r\nthe Tower, and then brought forth from it to have his spurs hacked off and\r\nthrown away, his sword broken over his head, and himself publicly called\r\nno longer knight, but “knave.” Then to the Fleet Prison, with certainty on\r\nthe morrow of a public procession to Westminster, himself the central\r\nobject, mounted, with face to tail, on the back of the sorriest horse to\r\nbe found, and the target for all the missiles of the crowd: a prospect and\r\nprogramme duly realised and carried out.\r\n\r\nMompesson we may easily conceive hearing of, and picturing, all these\r\nthings, in his retreat over sea, and congratulating himself on his prompt\r\nflight. But he was, after all, treated with the most extraordinary\r\ngenerosity. The same year, the fine of £10,000 was assigned by the House\r\nto his father-in-law (which we suspect was an oblique way of remitting it)\r\nand in 1623 he is found petitioning to be allowed to return to England. He\r\nwas allowed to return for a period of three months, on condition that it\r\nwas to be solely on his private affairs, but he was no sooner back than\r\nhe impudently began to put his old licensing patent in force again. On\r\nAugust 10th he was granted an extension of three months, but overstayed\r\nit, and was at last, February 8th, 1624, ordered to quit the country\r\nwithin five days. It remains uncertain whether he complied with this, or\r\nnot, but he soon returned; not, however, to again trouble public affairs,\r\nfor he returned to Wiltshire and died there, obscurely, about 1651. He\r\nlives in literature, in Massinger’s play, _A New Way to pay Old Debts_, as\r\n“Sir Giles Overreach.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inns of old time, serving as they did the varied functions of clubs\r\nand assembly-rooms and places of general resort, in addition to that of\r\nhotel, were often, at times when controversies ran high, very turbulent\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe manners and customs prevailing in the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury may be imagined from an affray which befell at the “Raven,”\r\nShrewsbury, in 1716, when two officers of the Dragoons insisted in the\r\npublic room of the inn, upon a Mr. Andrew Swift and a Mr. Robert Wood,\r\napothecary, drinking “King George, and Damnation to the Jacobites.” The\r\ncivilians refused, whereupon those military men drew their swords,\r\nbut--swords notwithstanding--they were very handsomely thrashed, and one\r\nwas placed upon the fire, and not only had his breeches burnt through in a\r\nconspicuous place, but had his person toasted. The officers then, we\r\nlearn, “went off, leaving their hatts, wigs and swords (which were broke)\r\nbehind them.”\r\n\r\nOne did not, it will be gathered from the above, easily in those times\r\nlead the Quiet Life; but that was a heated occasion, and we were then\r\nreally upon the threshold of that fine era when inns, taverns, and\r\ncoffee-houses were the resort, not merely of travellers or of thirsty\r\nsouls, but of wits and the great figures of eighteenth-century literature,\r\nwho were convivial as well as literary. It was a great, and, as it seems\r\nto the present century, a curious, time; when men of the calibre of\r\nAddison, of Goldsmith and of Johnson, acknowledged masters in classic and\r\nmodern literature, smoked and drank to excess in the public parlours of\r\ninns. But those were the clubs of that age, and that was an age in which,\r\nalthough the producers of literature were miserably rewarded, their\r\ncompany and conversation were sought and listened to with respect.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Johnson declared that a seat in a tavern chair was the height of\r\nhuman felicity, his saying carried a special significance, lost upon the\r\npresent age. He was thinking, not only of a comfortable sanded parlour, a\r\nroaring fire, and plenty of good cheer and good company, but also of the\r\ncircle of humbly appreciative auditors who gathered round an accepted wit,\r\nhung upon his words, offered themselves as butts for his ironic or satiric\r\nhumour, and--stood treat. The great wits of the eighteenth century\r\nexpected subservience in their admirers, and only began to coruscate, to\r\nutter words of wisdom or inspired nonsense, or to scatter sparkling quips\r\nand jests, when well primed with liquor--at the expense of others. The\r\nfelicity of Johnson found in a tavern chair was derived, therefore,\r\nchiefly from the homage of his attendant humble Boswells, and from the\r\nfact that they paid the reckoning; and was, perhaps, to some modern ideas,\r\na rather shameful idea of happiness.\r\n\r\nJohnson, who did not love the country, and thought one green field very\r\nlike another green field, when he spoke of a tavern chair was of course\r\nthinking of London taverns. He would have found no sufficient audience in\r\nits wayside fellow, which indeed was apt, in his time and for long after,\r\nto be somewhat rough and ready, and, when you had travelled a little far\r\nafield, became a very primitive and indeed barbarous place.\r\n\r\nAt Llannon, in 1797, those sketching and note-taking friends, Rowlandson\r\nand Wigstead, touring North and South Wales in search of the picturesque,\r\nfound it, not unmixed with dirt and discomfort, at the inns. Indeed, it\r\nwas only at one town in Wales--the town of Neath--that Wigstead found\r\nhimself able to declare, “with strict propriety,” that the house was\r\ncomfortable. Comfort and decency fled the inn at Llannon, abashed. This,\r\naccording to Wigstead, was the way of it: “The cook on our arrival was in\r\nthe suds, and, with unwiped hands, reached down a fragment of mutton for\r\nour repast: a piece of ham was lost, but after long search was found\r\namongst the worsted stockings and sheets on the board.”\r\n\r\nThen “a little child was sprawling in a dripping-pan which seemed recently\r\ntaken from the fire: the fat in this was destined to fry our eggs in.\r\nHunger itself even was blunted,” and the travellers left those delicacies\r\nalmost untouched. Not even the bread was without its surprises. “I devoted\r\nmy attention to a brown loaf,” says Wigstead, “but on cutting into it was\r\nsurprised to find a ball of carroty-coloured wool; and to what animal it\r\nhad belonged I was at a loss to determine. Our table-cloth had served the\r\nfamily for at least a month, and our sitting-room was everywhere decorated\r\nwith the elegant relics of a last night’s smoking society, as yet\r\nunremoved.”\r\n\r\nAll this was pretty bad, but perhaps even the baby in the dripping-pan,\r\nthe month-old table-cloth, and the hank of wool in the loaf were to be\r\npreferred to what they had experienced at Festiniog. They had not at first\r\npurposed to make a halt at that place, having planned to stay the night at\r\nTan-y-Bwlch, where the inn commanded a view over a lovely wooded vale. The\r\nperils and the inconveniences of the vile road by which they had come\r\nfaded into insignificance when they drew near, and they began to reckon\r\nupon the comforts of a good supper and good beds at Tan-y-Bwlch. They even\r\ndisputed whether the supper should be chickens or chops, but all such vain\r\narguments and contentions faded away when they drew near and a stony-faced\r\nlandlord declared he had no room for them.\r\n\r\nWe can easily sympathise here with those travellers in search of the\r\npicturesque, for we have all met with the like strokes of Fate. No doubt\r\nthe beauties of the view suddenly obscured themselves, as will happen\r\nwhen you can get nothing to eat or drink; and probably they thought of Dr.\r\nJohnson, who a few years earlier had held the most beautiful landscape\r\ncapable of being improved by a good inn in the foreground. But a good inn\r\nwhere they cannot or will not receive you, is, in such a situation,\r\nsorrow’s crown of sorrow, an aggravation and a mockery.\r\n\r\nIt was a tragical position, and down the sounding alleys of time vibrates\r\nstrange chords of reminiscence in the breasts of even modern tourists of\r\nany experience. We too, have suffered; and many an one may say, with much\r\ntragical meaning, “_et ego in Arcadia vixit_.”\r\n\r\nAlas! for the frustrated purpose of Messrs. Rowlandson and Wigstead,\r\nTan-y-Bwlch could not, or would not, receive them, and they had no choice\r\nbut to journey three more long Welsh miles to Festiniog in the rain. It\r\nsometimes rains in Wales, and when it does, it rarely knows when to leave\r\noff.\r\n\r\nArrived there, they almost passed the inn, in the gathering darkness,\r\nmistaking it for a barn or an outhouse; and when they made to enter, they\r\nwere confronted by an extraordinary landlady with the appearance of one of\r\nthe three witches in _Macbeth_.\r\n\r\n“Could they have beds?”\r\n\r\nReluctantly she said they could, telling them (what we know to be true\r\nenough) that she supposed they only came there because there was no\r\naccommodation at Tan-y-Bwlch.\r\n\r\nThe travellers made no reply to that damning accusation, and hid their\r\nincriminating blushes in the congenial gloom of the fast-falling night. It\r\nwas a situation in which, if you come to consider it, no wise man would\r\ngive “back answers.” You have a landlady who, for the proverbial two pins,\r\nor even less, would cast you forth; and when so thrust into the\r\ninhospitable night, you have seventeen mountainous miles to go, in a\r\ndrenching rain, before any other kind of asylum is reached.\r\n\r\nWigstead remarks that they “were not a little satisfied at being under any\r\nkind of roof,” and the words seem woefully inadequate to the occasion.\r\n\r\nThere were no chops that night for supper, nor chickens; and they fed,\r\nwith what grace they could summon up, on a “small leg of starved mutton\r\nand a duck,” which, by the scent of them, had been cooked a fortnight. For\r\nsauce they had hunger only.\r\n\r\n“Our bedrooms,” says Wigstead, “were most miserable indeed: the rain\r\npoured in at every tile in the ceiling,” and the sheets were literally\r\nwringing wet; so that, in Wigstead’s elegant phrasing, they “thought it\r\nmost prudent to sacrifice to _Somnus_ in our own garments, between\r\nblankets”: which may perhaps be translated, into everyday English, to mean\r\nthat they slept in their own clothes.\r\n\r\nThey saw strange sights on that wild tour, and, in the course of their\r\nhazardous travels through the then scarcely civilised interior of the\r\nPrincipality, came to the “pleasant village” of Newcastle Emlyn,\r\nCarmarthenshire, where they found a “decent inn” in whose kitchen they\r\nremarked a dog acting as turnspit. That the dogs so employed did not\r\nparticularly relish the work is evident in Wigstead’s remark: “Great care\r\nmust be taken that this animal does not observe the cook approach the\r\nlarder. If he does, he immediately hides himself for the remainder of the\r\nday,” acting, in fact, like a professional “unemployed” when offered a\r\njob!\r\n\r\nA familiar sight in the kitchen of any considerable inn of the long ago\r\nwas the turnspit dog, who, like the caged mouse or squirrel with his\r\nrecreation-wheel, revolved a kind of treadwheel which, in this instance,\r\nwas connected with apparatus for turning the joints roasting at the fire,\r\nand formed not so much recreation as extremely hard work. The dogs\r\ncommonly used for this purpose were of the long-bodied, short-legged,\r\nDachshund type.\r\n\r\nMachinery, in the form of bottle-jacks revolved by clockwork, came to the\r\nrelief of those hard-working dogs so long ago that all knowledge of\r\nturnspits, except such as may be gleaned from books of reference, is now\r\nlost, and illustrations of them performing their duties are exceedingly\r\nrare. Rowlandson’s spirited drawing is, on that account, doubly welcome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KITCHEN OF A COUNTRY INN, 1797: SHOWING THE TURNSPIT\r\nDOG. _From the engraving after Rowlandson._]\r\n\r\nTurnspits were made the subject of a very illuminating notice, a\r\ngeneration or so back, by a former writer on country life: “How well do I\r\nrecollect,” he says, “in the days of my youth watching the operations of a\r\nturnspit at the house of a worthy old Welsh clergyman in Worcestershire,\r\nwho taught me to read! He was a good man, wore a bushy wig, black worsted\r\nstockings, and large plated buckles in his shoes. As he had several\r\nboarders as well as day-scholars, his two turnspits had plenty to do. They\r\nwere long-bodied, crook-legged and ugly dogs, with a suspicious, unhappy\r\nlook about them, as if they were weary of the task they had to do, and\r\nexpected every moment to be seized upon, to perform it. Cooks in those\r\ndays, as they are said to be at present, were very cross; and if the poor\r\nanimal, wearied with having a larger joint than usual to turn, stopped for\r\na moment, the voice of the cook might be heard, rating him in no very\r\ngentle terms. When we consider that a large, solid piece of beef would\r\ntake at least three hours before it was properly roasted, we may form some\r\nidea of the task a dog had to perform in turning a wheel during that time.\r\nA pointer has pleasure in finding game, the terrier worries rats with\r\neagerness and delight, and the bull-dog even attacks bulls with the\r\ngreatest energy, while the poor turnspit performs his task with\r\ncompulsion, like a culprit on a tread-wheel, subject to scolding or\r\nbeating if he stops a moment to rest his weary limbs, and is then kicked\r\nabout the kitchen when the task is over.”\r\n\r\nThe work being so hard, how ever did the dogs allow themselves to be put\r\nto it? The training was, after all, extremely simple. You first, as Mrs.\r\nGlasse might say, caught your dog. That, it will be agreed, was\r\nindispensable. Then you put him, ignorant and uneducated, into the wheel,\r\nand in company with him a live coal, which burnt his legs if he stood\r\nstill. He accordingly tried to race away from it, and the quicker he spun\r\nthe wheel round in his efforts the faster followed the coal: so that, by\r\ndint of much painful experience, he eventually learned the (comparatively)\r\nhappy medium between standing still and going too fast. “These dogs,” it\r\nwas somewhat unnecessarily added, “were by no means fond of their\r\nprofession.” Of course they were not! Does the convict love his crank or\r\ntreadmill, or the galley-slave his oar and bench?\r\n\r\nThe turnspit was once so well-known an institution that he found an\r\nallusion in poetry, and an orator was likened, in uncomplimentary fashion,\r\nto one:\r\n\r\n  His arguments in silly circles run,\r\n  Still round and round, and end where they begun.\r\n  So the poor turnspit, as the wheel runs round,\r\n  The more he gains, the more he loses ground.\r\n\r\nThese unfortunate dogs acquired a preternatural intelligence. A humorous,\r\nbut probably not true, story is told, illustrating this. It was at Bath,\r\nand some of them had accompanied their mistresses to church, where the\r\nlesson chanced to be the tenth chapter of Ezekiel, in which there is an\r\namazing deal about self-propelled chariots, and wheels. When the dogs\r\nfirst heard the word “wheel” they started up in alarm; on its occurring a\r\nsecond time they howled dolefully, and at the third instance they all\r\nrushed from the church.\r\n\r\nStrangely modern appear the grievances raised against innkeepers in the\r\nold times. The bills they presented were early pronounced exorbitant, and\r\nso, in spite of measures intended for the relief of travellers, they\r\nremained. Indeed, throughout the centuries, until the present day, the\r\ncurious in these matters will find, not unexpectedly, that innkeepers\r\ncharged according to what they considered their guests would grumble\r\nat--and pay.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth-century _locus classicus_ in this sort is the account\r\nrendered to the Duc de Nivernais, the French Ambassador to England, who in\r\n1762, coming to negotiate a treaty of peace, halted the night, on his way\r\nfrom Dover to London, at the “Red Lion,” Canterbury.\r\n\r\nFor the night’s lodging for twelve persons, with a frugal supper in which\r\noysters, fowls, boiled mutton, poached eggs and fried whiting figure, the\r\nlandlord presented an account of over £44. Our soldiers fought the\r\nFrenchman; mine host did his humble, non-combatant part, and fleeced him.\r\n\r\nThis truly magnificent bill has been preserved, not, let us hope, for the\r\nemulation of other hotel-keepers, but by way of a “terrible example.”\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n                                        £ s. d.\r\n  Tea, coffee, and chocolate            1  4 0\r\n  Supper for self and servants         15 10 0\r\n  Bread and beer                        3  0 0\r\n  Fruit                                 2 15 0\r\n  Wine and punch                       10  8 8\r\n  Wax candles and charcoal              3  0 0\r\n  Broken glass and china                2 10 0\r\n  Lodging                               1  7 0\r\n  Tea, coffee, and chocolate            2  0 0\r\n  Chaise and horses for the next stage  2 16 0\r\n                                       -------\r\n                                       44 10 8\r\n                                       =======\r\n\r\nThe Duke paid the account without a murmur, only remarking that innkeepers\r\nat this rate should soon grow rich; but news of this extraordinary charge\r\nwas soon spread all over England. It was printed in the newspapers, amid\r\nother marvels, disasters and atrocities, and mine host of the “Red Lion,”\r\nlike Byron in a later age, woke up one morning to find himself famous.\r\n\r\nThe country gentlemen, scandalised at his rapacity, boycotted his inn, and\r\nhis brother innkeepers of Canterbury disowned him. The unfortunate man\r\nwrote to the _St. James’s Chronicle_, endeavouring to justify himself, and\r\ncomplaining bitterly of the harm that had been wrought his business by the\r\ncontinual billeting of soldiers upon him. But it was in vain he protested;\r\nhis trade fell off, and he was ruined in six months.\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, there was a difference of opinion as to whether a bill had\r\nor had not actually been paid, as we see by the following indignant\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n    Normanton near Stamford.\r\n    2{d} Sept{r} 1755.\r\n\r\n    Madam,\r\n\r\n    My Lord Morton Received a Letter from you of the 5{th} Aug{t}\r\n    inclosing a Bill drawn by you on his Lp for £6 1 11, and to make up\r\n    this sum p{r} your Account annexed to the above-mentioned Letter, you\r\n    charge twelve shillings for his Servant’s eating, for which he is\r\n    ready to Swear he paid you in full; then you charge for the Horses Hay\r\n    for 35 Nights notwithstanding you was ordered to send the horse out to\r\n    grass, and by the by when the horse came to London he was so poor as\r\n    if he had been quite neglected which seems probable as he mended soon\r\n    after he came here; at any rate you have used my Lord ill in the whole\r\n    affair, and if you or your Servants have committed any accidental\r\n    mistake either in the Lads Board or the horses hay pray see to rectify\r\n    it soon, because things of that sort not cleard up and satisfied are\r\n    very hurtfull to People in your publick way especially with those to\r\n    whom you have already been obliged, and who at any rate will not be\r\n    imposed upon. I am--\r\n\r\n      Madam--\r\n        Your humble sert\r\n          JOHN MILNE.\r\n\r\n    To\r\n      M{rs} Beaver\r\n        at the Black Bull\r\n          Newcastle\r\n            upon Tine,\r\n    free\r\n    Morton.\r\n\r\nThen there was Dover, notorious for high prices. “Thy cliffs, _dear_\r\nDover! harbour and hotel,” sang Byron, who bitterly remembered the “long,\r\nlong bills, whence nothing is deducted.” The “Ship,” the hotel probably\r\nindicted by the poet, has long since disappeared, but that gigantic\r\ncaravanserai, the “Lord Warden Hotel,” could at one time, in its\r\nmonumental charges, have afforded him material for another stanza.\r\nMagnificent as were the charges made by overreaching hosts elsewhere, they\r\nall paled their ineffectual sums-total before the sublime heights of the\r\naccount rendered to Louis Napoleon when Prince-President of France. He\r\nmerely remarked that it was truly princely, and paid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF AN ACCOUNT RENDERED TO JOHN PALMER IN 1787.]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, that famous coaching hostelry, the “Swan with Two\r\nNecks,” in Lad Lane, in the City of London, charged guests for their\r\naccommodation as moderately as the accompanying bill for stabling a horse,\r\nthe establishment should have been popular. This bill, printed here in\r\n_facsimile_ from the original, was presented, April 16th, 1787, to John\r\nPalmer, the famous Post Office reformer, and shows that only one shilling\r\nand ninepence a night was charged. Yet he was at that time a famous man.\r\nThree years before he had established the first mail-coach, and was\r\neverywhere well known, and doubtless, in general, fair prey to renderers\r\nof bills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAST DAYS OF THE “SWAN WITH TWO NECKS.”]\r\n\r\nThe “Swan with Two Necks,” whence many coaches set out, until the end of\r\nsuch things, was often known by waggish people as the “Wonderful Bird,”\r\nand obtained its name from a perversion of the “Swan with Two Nicks”:\r\nswans that swam the upper Thames and were the property of the Vintners’\r\nCompany being marked on their bills with two nicks, for identification.\r\nLad Lane is now “Gresham Street,” but, apart from its mere name, is a lane\r\nstill; but the old buildings of the “Swan with Two Necks” were pulled down\r\nin 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLATTER DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nA host of writers have written in praise--and rightly in praise--of that\r\nfine flower of many centuries of innkeeping evolution, the Coaching Inn of\r\nthe early and mid-nineteenth century. Hazlitt, Washington Irving, De\r\nQuincey, are all among the prophets; De Quincey, ceasing for the while his\r\nmystical apocalyptic style, mournfully lamenting the beginnings of the end\r\nthat came even so long ago as his day, which, after all, ended not so very\r\nlong ago, for although he seems so ancient, he died only in 1859. He\r\nwrites, in early railway times, of “those days,” the days in question\r\nbeing that fine period in coaching and innkeeping, the ’20’s of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n“What cosy old parlours in those days,” he exclaims, “low-roofed, glowing\r\nwith ample fires and fenced from the blasts of the doors by screens whose\r\nfolding doors were, or seemed to be, infinite! What motherly landladies!\r\nwon, how readily, to kindness the most lavish by the mere attractions of\r\nsimplicity and youthful innocence, and finding so much interest in the\r\nbare circumstance of being a traveller at a childish age! Then what\r\nblooming young handmaidens; how different from the knowing and worldly\r\ndemireps of modern high roads! And sometimes grey-headed, faithful\r\nwaiters, how sincere and attentive by comparison with their flippant\r\nsuccessors, the eternal ‘Coming, sir, coming,’ of our improved\r\ngeneration!”\r\n\r\nThey all tell the same tale; those whose privilege it was to witness the\r\nmeeting of the old order and the new.\r\n\r\n“It was interesting,” says Mr. Locker-Lampson, writing of old times, “as\r\nthe post-chaise drew up at the door of the roomy and comfortable hostel\r\nwhere we were to dine or sleep, to see Boniface and his better half\r\nsmilingly awaiting us--Us in particular!--waiter and chamber-lasses\r\ngrouped behind them. The landlady advances to the carriage-window with a\r\ncordial, self-respecting, ‘Will you please to alight.’ I remember that the\r\nlandlord, who announced dinner, sometimes entered with the first dish and\r\nplaced it on the table, bowing as he retired. Why, it all seems as if it\r\nwere but yesterday! Now it is gone for ever.”\r\n\r\nYes, irrevocably gone. Most of the old inns are gone too, and in their\r\nplace, only too frequently, the traveller finds the modern, company-owned\r\nhotel, with a foreign manager who naturally takes no interest in the\r\nguests he, as a matter of fact, rarely sees, and with whom no guest could\r\npossibly foregather. In the modern barrack hotel the guest must\r\nnecessarily be impersonal--one of a number going to swell the returns. No\r\none quite willingly resigns himself to being a mere number; it is,\r\nindeed, one of the greatest of the convict’s trials that he has lost his\r\nname and become identified only by a letter and a row of figures. Just in\r\nthe same way, when we stay at hotels our self-respect is revolted at being\r\nreceived and dismissed with equal indifference, and there are many who\r\nwould gladly resign the innovations of electric light and hydraulic lifts\r\nfor that “welcome at an inn” of which Shenstone speaks. The philosophy of\r\nthese regrets must, in fact, be sought in that illuminating phrase, “_Us\r\nin particular_.” We travellers are unwilling to be thought of merely as\r\nnumbers identical with those of our bedrooms, and we like to believe,\r\nagainst our own better judgment, that the old-fashioned hosts and\r\nhostesses were pleased to see _us_; which of course, in that special\r\nsense, was not the case. But a little make-believe sometimes goes a great\r\nway, and we need never, unless we have a mind to distress ourselves, seek\r\nthe tongue of humbug in the cheek of courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of a good coaching house was a very important person indeed.\r\nNot seldom he was a large owner of horses and employer of labour; a man of\r\nsome culture and of considerable wealth. He was not only a good judge of\r\nwine and horseflesh, but of men and matters, and not merely the servant,\r\nbut the self-respecting and respected friend, of the gentry in his\r\nneighbourhood. He was generally in evidence at his house, and he or his\r\nwife would have scorned the idea of appointing a manager to do their work.\r\nIn those days, and with such men along the road, it was an established\r\nrule of etiquette for the coming guest to invite his host to take a glass\r\nof wine with him and to exchange the news. But the type has become quite\r\nextinct, and even their old houses have been either demolished or else\r\nconverted into private residences. Such hosts were Mr. and Mrs. Botham, of\r\nthe “Windmill” at Salt Hill; or the long succession of notable landlords\r\nof the “Castle” at Marlborough, on the Bath Road; such were Clark, of the\r\n“Bell,” Barnby Moor, and Holt of the “Wheatsheaf,” Rushyford Bridge, on\r\nthe Great North Road,--to name but those.\r\n\r\nThey were men, too, of considerable influence, and, when equipped with\r\ndetermination, wielded a certain amount of power, and brought great\r\nchanges to pass; as when Robert Lawrence, of the “Lion” at Shrewsbury, by\r\ndint of great personal exertions, brought the line of travel between\r\nLondon and Dublin through Shrewsbury and Holyhead, instead of, as\r\nformerly, through Chester. He died in 1806, and the curious may yet read\r\non his mural monument in St. Julian’s Church how he was “many years\r\nproprietor of the ‘Raven’ and ‘Lion’ inns in this town,” and that it was\r\nto his “public spirit and unremitting exertions for upwards of thirty\r\nyears, in opening the great road through Wales between the United\r\nkingdoms, as also for establishing the first mail-coach, that the public\r\nin general have been greatly indebted.”\r\n\r\nAlmost equally forceful were some of the old-time proprietors of the\r\n“George” at Walsall. In 1781 Mr. Thomas Fletcher, one of an old and\r\nhighly respected family in that town, gave up the “Dragon” in High Street\r\nand built the great “George Hotel.” He even procured an Act of Parliament\r\nby which the present road from Walsall to Stafford was made, thereby\r\nbringing Walsall out of a by-road into the direct line of traffic. He also\r\ncaused the Birmingham road to be straightened and widened, and gradually\r\nbrought coaching and posting through the town. His successors, Fletcher\r\nand Sharratt, were equally energetic. In 1823 they remodelled the\r\n“George,” giving it the classic-columned front that confers a kind of\r\nthird-cousin relationship to the British Museum, with unappetising and\r\ngruesome thoughts of dining on fried mummy and kippered parchments. The\r\ncolumns, which are still very solemnly there--or were, a year ago--came\r\nfrom the Marquis of Donegall’s neighbouring seat of Fisherwick Hall,\r\ndemolished about that time, and the placing of them here was celebrated by\r\nan inaugural feast, “the colonnade dinner,” presided over by Lord\r\nHatherton, a great patron of the house.\r\n\r\nThose wonder-working innkeepers also, in 1831, promoted the Bill by which\r\nthe present Birmingham road through Perry Bar was made, superseding the\r\nold route by Hamstead and Handsworth church.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, those fine old innkeepers, whatever else they were, were\r\nnot usually cultivators of the art of literary expression, and did not\r\nwrite their memoirs and reminiscences. Yet they could, had they chosen,\r\nhave told an interesting tale of men and matters. Consider! They were in\r\nthe whirl of life, and often knew personages and affairs, not merely by\r\nreport, but at first hand. What would not the historian of social England\r\ngive for such reminiscences? They would open the door to much that is now\r\nsealed, and would clothe the dry bones of mere facts with romance.\r\n\r\nOne such innkeeper, Mr. J. Kearsley Fowler, who kept the “White Hart,”\r\nAylesbury, in the last few years of its existence, has, however, left us\r\nsomething by which we may see, described at first-hand, the life and\r\nsurroundings of a first-class old coaching and posting inn between 1812\r\nand those middle years of the ’60’s, when a few branch-road coaches were\r\nyet left, and the Squire and Agriculture were still prosperous.\r\n\r\nHe tells us, of his own knowledge, that the innkeepers had by far the\r\nlargest amount of capital invested in the country towns, where, as men\r\ngenerally of superior manners and education, from their constant\r\nassociation with the leading nobility, clergy, and magistracy, they took a\r\nprominent position, both socially and politically, the leading houses\r\nbeing the head quarters, respectively, of Whigs and Tories.\r\n\r\nThe “White Hart” at Aylesbury was generally believed to have dated back to\r\nthe time of Richard the Second, and in the time of the Wars of the Roses\r\nto have been the rendezvous of the White Rose party, while the “Roebuck”\r\nwas affected to the Red Rose.\r\n\r\nUntil 1812 the “White Hart” retained its fine mediæval, three-gabled\r\nfrontage, with first floor overhanging the ground-floor, and the second\r\noverhanging the first. Elaborately carved barge-boards decorated the\r\ngables. In the centre of the front was a great gateway with deeply reeded\r\noaken posts and heavy double doors, which could be closed on occasion;\r\nbut, in the growing security of the land, had scarce within the memory of\r\nman been shut to. Within was a spacious courtyard, partly surrounded by a\r\ngallery supported on stout oaken pillars and reached by a staircase. From\r\nthis gallery, as in most other mediæval hostelries, the bedrooms and\r\nprincipal sitting-rooms opened. The “Coffee Room” and “Commercial Room”\r\nwere at either side of the entrance from the street: the “Commercial Room”\r\nitself having, before the days of “commercials,” once been called “the\r\nChange,” and used, as asserted by local tradition, as the place where the\r\nprincipal business transactions of the town were conducted, over suitable\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nOn the side opposite was the room called the “Crown,” where the collectors\r\nof customs and excise, and other officials periodically attended. In the\r\n“Mitre,” an adjoining room, the Chancellor of the Bishop of Lincoln, and\r\nthe “Apparitor” of the Archdeacon had of old collected, for three hundred\r\nyears, the dues or fees of the Church. Another room, the “Fountain,” was\r\nperhaps originally a select bar. Running under the entire frontage of the\r\nhouse was the extensive cellarage, necessarily spacious in days when every\r\none drank wine, and many deeply.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the yard was the great kitchen, and beyond it large gardens\r\nand a beautiful, full-sized bowling-green. Gigantic elms, at least three\r\ncenturies old, bordered the gardens, which were further screened from\r\noutside observation by dense shrubberies of flowering shrubs, laburnums,\r\nlilacs, mountain-ash, acacias, and red chestnuts. Ancient walnut-trees and\r\nshady arbours completed this lovely retreat.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Beyond this very delightful, but merely ornamental,\r\nportion was an orchard stocked with fine apple- and pear-trees: codlins,\r\ngolden and ribston pippins, Blenheim orange, russets and early\r\nJune-eatings, Gansell’s bergamot pear, and others. Three very fine\r\nmulberry-trees, at least three centuries old, and of course a varied and\r\nextensive stock of bush-fruit, were included in this orchard, and in\r\naddition there was the kitchen-garden.\r\n\r\nIn the orchard were the cow-houses and piggeries, and the hospital for\r\nlame or ailing horses. A mill-stream ran at the bottom, and in the midst\r\nof it was a “stew,” a shallow pond for freshwater fish, in which was kept\r\nan “eel-trunk,” a strong iron box about four feet long and two feet wide\r\nand deep, perforated with holes. The lid of this contrivance was fastened\r\nwith lock and key, and was under the charge of the man-cook, who was head\r\nof the servants. When eels were required for table, the trunk would be\r\nhauled up to bank by a strong iron chain, and emptied.\r\n\r\nThe stables had stalls for about fifty horses, and over them were lofts\r\nfor hay, straw, and corn. Harness-rooms, waiting-room for the postboys,\r\nand an “ostry,” _i.e._, office and store-room for the ostler, were\r\nattached, together with chaise and coach-houses. The establishment of the\r\n“White Hart”--and it was typical of many others in the old days--covered\r\nfrom five to six acres.\r\n\r\nThe staff of such a house was, of course, large. Besides the innkeeper and\r\nhis wife, both of them working hard in the conduct of the business, there\r\nwere housekeeper, barmaid, man-cook, waiter and under-waiter, kitchenmaid,\r\nscullerymaid, chambermaid, laundress, housemaid, nurse, boots, ostler,\r\ntap-boy, first-turn postboy, and generally an extra woman: sixteen\r\npersons, whom the innkeeper had to lodge and feed daily, in addition to\r\nhis guests.\r\n\r\nThe “White Hart” was re-fronted in a very plain, not to say ugly, manner\r\nin 1813, and finally demolished in 1863. Not even that most lovely and\r\nmost famous feature of it, the celebrated “Rochester room,” was spared.\r\nThis was a noble apartment, built as an addition to the back of the house\r\nin 1663 by the Earl of Rochester, as a return for a signal service\r\nrendered by the landlord in that time--perilous to such Cavaliers as\r\nhe--the Commonwealth. It seems, according to Clarendon, that the Earl and\r\nSir Nicholas Armour came riding horseback into the town one night and put\r\nup at the “White Hart,” then kept by a landlord named Gilvy, who was\r\naffected strongly in favour of Cromwell and all his doings. The local\r\nmagistrate, hearing of the visit of the Earl, sent secretly to the\r\ninnkeeper requesting him to detain the travellers’ horses the next\r\nmorning, so that neither of them should be able to leave, pending an\r\ninquiry upon their business; but the thing was not done secretly enough.\r\nProbably one of the servants of the inn told those two guests of something\r\nominous being afoot; at any rate, the Earl had Gilvy up and questioned\r\nhim, and, telling him how probably the lives of himself and friend were in\r\nhis hand, gave him forty Jacobuses and suggested that they should, without\r\na word, depart that night. Clarendon expresses himself as unable to decide\r\nwhether the gold or the landlord’s conscience prompted his next action. At\r\nany rate, Gilvy conducted the two fugitives from the inn at midnight “into\r\nthe London way.” They reached London and then fled over sea, while the\r\nlandlord was left to invent some plausible story to satisfy the Justice of\r\nthe Peace, who in his turn was suspected by Cromwell of being a party to\r\nthe escape.\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration, the landlord received a brimming measure of reward. He\r\nwas thanked by the King, and the Earl built for him that noble room,\r\nforty-two feet long, by twenty-three wide, that was the pride and glory of\r\nthe “White Hart” for just two hundred years. It was panelled from floor\r\nto ceiling in richly carved oak, set off with gilding, and embellished\r\nwith the figures of Peace and Concord and the initials C R, while the\r\nceiling was painted with nymphs and cherubim by Antonio Verrio.\r\n\r\nNothing has more changed from its former condition than the old inn which\r\nhas become the modern hotel. The “George,” the “Crown and Anchor,” the\r\n“Wellington,” or the “King’s Head,” had an individuality which was never\r\nlost. There was a personal kind of welcome from the landlord and the\r\nlandlady that simulated the hospitality of a friendly host and hostess,\r\nmingled with the attention of a superior sort of body-servant. You were\r\nnot handed over to a number and a chambermaid, like a document in a\r\npigeon-hole tabulated by a clerk; but the hostess herself showed you your\r\nrooms, and begged you to put a name to anything you might fancy. There was\r\nno general coffee-room then, save for commercial travellers and such\r\nsocial gentlemen as preferred even inferior company to solitude. There was\r\nno table d’hôte dinner other than the ordinary, between twelve and two,\r\nwhich was chiefly made for the convenience of travellers by the\r\nstage-coach, who halted here for change and refreshment. Even the ladies\r\nwho might be on the road were served and kept apart from the, perhaps,\r\ndoubtful gents below; and mine host himself brought in the first dish and\r\nset it on the table of the private room, which was as much _de rigueur_\r\nthen for ladies as the copper warming-pan and the claret with the yellow\r\nseal, or the thick, deep red luscious port of old, ordered by the knowing\r\nfor the good of the house.\r\n\r\nIn the country the pretty little inn, with its honeysuckled porch and\r\nscrambling profusion of climbing roses up to the bedroom windows, had an\r\neven more home-like character in its methods of dealing with its guests.\r\nHere the servants stayed on for years, till they grew to be as much part\r\nof the establishment as the four-poster hung with red moreen and the\r\nplated sconces for candles. And here everything was of perfect\r\ncleanliness, and as fresh as fragrant. The eggs and milk and butter were\r\nall sweet and new. Generous jugs of cream softened the tartness of the\r\nblack-currant pudding or the green-gooseberry tart. The spring chickens\r\nand young ducklings had been well fed; the mutton was home-grown and not\r\nunder five years; the beef was home-grown too, and knew nothing of\r\nantiseptic preparations or frozen chambers; and the vegetables came direct\r\nfrom the garden, and had been neither tinned nor carted for miles in huge\r\nwaggon loads, well rammed down and tightly compressed. And all the meat\r\nwas roasted before an open fire, diligently basted in the process, till\r\nthe gravy lightly frothed on the browned skin, and the appetising scent it\r\ngave out had no affinity with the smell of fat on heated iron, which for\r\nthe most part accompanies the modern roast in the modern oven. The linen\r\ninvariably smelt of lavender or dried rose-leaves, of which big bags were\r\nkept among the sheets; but the washing apparatus was poor, and the\r\nillumination was scanty. Wax candles in silver or plated branched\r\ncandlesticks, that vaguely suggested churches and sacraments, shed a\r\nveritably “dim religious” glimmer in the sitting-room, and appeared\r\nexpensively under the form of “lights” in the bill--mistily suggestive of\r\nfood for hungry cats.\r\n\r\nYet the old country inn had, and still has--for it is not wholly\r\nextinct--its charms that weigh against any little defect.\r\n\r\nOf all this quasi-home life which belonged to the old inn of the past, the\r\nhotel of the present has not a trace. For certain forms of luxury the\r\nmodern hotel is hard to beat. Thick carpets deaden the footsteps of\r\nstragglers through the corridors, and your boots, invariably kicked into\r\ninfinities by midnight guests, do not--as they do in the older houses--fly\r\nnoisily along the bare boards. The rooms are lighted with electric light,\r\nbut usually set so high as to be useless for all purposes of reading or\r\nworking. In the drawing-room are luxurious chairs of all shapes and sizes;\r\nin the reading-room papers of all colours, to suit here the red-hot\r\nRadical and there the cooler Conservative. The billiard-room attracts the\r\nmen after dinner as--if in the country--the tennis-ground or the\r\ngolf-links had attracted them through the day. The telephone does\r\neverything you want. Carriages, theatres, quotations, races, a doctor if\r\nyou are ill, a motor-car if you are well--nothing within the range of\r\nhuman wants that can be ordered and not chosen comes amiss to the\r\ntelephone and its manipulators. All the rough edges of life are smoothed\r\ndown to satin softness. All the friction is taken away. A modern hotel is\r\nas the isle of Calypso or the Garden of Armida, where all you have to do\r\nis to make known your wants and pay the bill.\r\n\r\nBut it has not one single strain of Home in it. Home is the place where\r\nthe out-of-date lingers, and where modern conveniences that add to the\r\ncomplexity and the worry of life have no corner. At the modern hotel you\r\nare a document in a pigeon-hole--a number, not a person--an accident, not\r\nsubstantive. The chambermaid does not wait on you, but on the room. You\r\nget up, breakfast, dine, according to the times fixed by the management.\r\nYou cannot have your bath before a certain hour, and the bacon is not\r\nfrizzled until nine o’clock. Luncheon is probably elastic because it is\r\ncold, and potatoes can be kept hot without difficulty. Dinner is, of\r\ncourse, fixed, and you take it in masses together: or so took it, for in\r\nlate years, especially in the first hotels of London, a revulsion of\r\nfeeling has led to the long tables being abolished, and small ones\r\ninstalled, where, almost privately amid the throng, you and your little\r\nparty may dine. As a rule the waiters are Swiss and the meat is foreign,\r\nthe cook is a Frenchman and called a _chef_; and the materials are\r\ninferior. The vegetables are tinned, and oysters, lobsters, salmon, and\r\nhare in May follow suit. The sauces are all exactly the same in one hotel\r\nas in another, and much margarine enters into their composition. Electric\r\nbells emphasise the monotonous ordering of the whole concern, where as\r\nlittle character is expressed in the ring as in the number it indicates;\r\nand speaking-tubes sound in the corridors, like domestic fog-horns or\r\nrailway whistles, calling the chambermaids or waiters of such-and-such a\r\nfloor to listen to their orders from below. Wherever you go you find\r\nexactly the same things--the same order, the same management, the same\r\nappliances and methods. You arrive without a welcome, you leave without a\r\nfarewell. Your character is determined according to the tips you give on\r\nparting, and an hour after you have gone your personality is forgotten.\r\nBut, above all things, Heaven save us from falling ill in the modern\r\nhotel. No one cares for you, and no one even has the decency to make a\r\npretence of doing so.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, if you go somewhat out of the season, and before the\r\nrush of visitors begins, you get to a certain degree behind the scenes,\r\nand learn a little of the heart and humanity of the management. The\r\nchambermaid has time to have a little chat with you in the morning, and\r\nthe head waiter gives you bits of local information both interesting and\r\nnew. The manageress is not too busy for a few minutes’ gossip across the\r\ncounter which separates her from the hall, and screens her off in a\r\nsanctuary of her own. And you may find her cheerful, chatty, kindly, and\r\nwilling to please for the mere pleasure of pleasing.\r\n\r\nIn the monster hotels of London and the great cities, while there may yet\r\nbe a “season”--a period of extra pressure and overcrowding--there is no\r\nsuch slack time as the giant caravanserais of holiday resorts experience.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer of the many-storeyed, “palatial” hotels, gorgeous with marble\r\npavements, polished granite columns, lifts and gigantic saloons, was the\r\n“Great Western Railway Hotel” at Paddington.[11] Since that huge pile set\r\nthe fashion, hundreds of others, huger and more magnificent, have been\r\nbuilt at Charing Cross, Euston, St. Pancras, Marylebone and other London\r\ntermini, with big brothers--in every way as big and well-appointed--in\r\nprovincial towns. They are the logical outcome of the times, the direct\r\nsuccessors of the coaching and posting inns that originally came into\r\nexistence to supply the wants, in food and lodging, of travellers set down\r\nat the places where the coaches stopped. The final expression of the\r\ncoaching hostelry is still to be seen in London, in instructive company\r\nwith one of the largest of the railway hotels, in the Strand, where the\r\n“Golden Cross,” built in 1832, looks upon the “Charing Cross Hotel” of\r\nthe South-Eastern Railway.\r\n\r\nThe management of a great modern hotel is no easy thing. It demands the\r\nurbanity of an ambassador, the marketing instincts of a good housewife,\r\nthe soldier’s instinct for command, the caution of a financier, and a gift\r\nfor judging character. All these things--natural endowments, or the result\r\nof training--must go to the making of an hotel-manager who has, perhaps, a\r\ncouple of hundred people on his staff, and hundreds of guests, many of\r\nthem unreasonable, to keep satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt has lately become a commonplace to say that cycling and the motor-car\r\nhave peopled the roads again. The old coaching inns have entered upon a\r\nnew era of prosperity by reason of the crowds of cyclists who fare forth\r\nfrom London along the ancient highways, or explore, awheel, the\r\nneighbourhoods of provincial towns. The “last” coach-driver, coach-guard,\r\nand post-boy, killed off regularly by the newspapers, still survive to\r\nwitness this new cult of the wheel, and the ultimate ostlers of the\r\ncoaching era, a bit stiff in the joints, shaky at the knees, and generally\r\nout of repair, have come forth blinking, from the dark and cavernous\r\nrecesses of their mouldering stables, all too large now for the horses\r\nthat find shelter there, to take charge of the machines of steel and iron\r\nand rubber that will carry you infinite distances without fatigue.\r\n\r\nThere are elements of both fun and pathos in the sight of an old ostler\r\ncleaning a muddy bicycle in a coach-yard from which the last coach-horses\r\ndeparted nearly two generations ago. As a boy, he started life in the\r\nplace as a stable-help, and had scarce finished his novitiate when the\r\nrailway was opened and the coaches dropped off one by one, after vainly\r\nappealing to the old-fashioned prejudices of their patrons to shun the\r\ntrains and still travel by the highways. How he has managed to retain his\r\nplace all this time goodness only knows. Perhaps he has been useful in\r\nlooking after the horses that work the hotel ’bus to and from the station;\r\nand then the weekly market-day, bringing in the farmers with their gigs\r\nand traps from outlying villages, is still an institution. For such\r\ncustomers old George had, no doubt, the liveliest contempt in the fine old\r\nfree-handed days of coaching; but this class of business, once turned over\r\ncheerfully to second- or third-rate inns, has long been eagerly shared\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nTo watch him with a bicycle you would think the machine a sensitive beast,\r\nready to kick unless humoured, for as he rubs it down with a cloth he\r\nsoothes it with the continuous “’ssh-ssh, ’ssh” which has become\r\ninvoluntary with him, from long usage; while if indeed it can’t kick, it\r\nsucceeds very fairly in barking his shins with those treacherous pedals.\r\nAll the persuasive hissing in the world won’t soothe a pedal.\r\n\r\nAs for the motor-cars which are now finding their way into the old\r\ninn-yards, the old ostler stands fearfully aloof from them, and lets the\r\ndriver of the motor look after the machine himself. The New Ostler, who\r\nwill be produced by the logic of events in the course of a very few more\r\nyears, will be an expert mechanic, and able to tittivate a gear and grind\r\nin a valve of a motor-car, or execute minor repairs to a bicycle, just as\r\nreadily as an ostler rubs down or clips a horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPILGRIMS’ INNS AND MONASTIC HOSTELS\r\n\r\n\r\nInns, or guest-houses for the proper lodging and entertainment of\r\ntravellers bent on pilgrimage, were among the earliest forms of\r\nhostelries; and those great bournes of religious pilgrimage in mediæval\r\ntimes--the shrine of St. Thomas à Becket at Canterbury, the tomb of Edward\r\nthe Second in Gloucester Cathedral, the relics of St. Dunstan at\r\nGlastonbury, and the more or less holy objects of superstitious reverence\r\nat Walsingham, St. Albans, and indeed, in most of our great abbeys,\r\nattracting thousands of sinners anxious to clear off old scores and begin\r\nafresh--were full of inns for the entertainment of every class of\r\nitinerating sinner; from the Abbot’s guest-house, at the service of the\r\ngreat, to the hostels for the middle classes, and the barns and outhouses\r\nwhere the common folk appropriately herded.\r\n\r\nThe Abbots and other dignified ecclesiastics were thus among the earliest\r\ninnkeepers, but they conducted their business on lines that would be\r\nimpossible to the modern hotel-keeper, for they commonly boarded and\r\nlodged their guests free of charge, confident, in the religious spirit of\r\nthe time, that the offerings to be made at the shrines, which were the\r\nobjects of those old-time painful journeys, would amply repay the costs\r\nand charges of their entertaining, and leave a very handsome surplus for\r\nthe good of the Abbey.\r\n\r\nChaucer’s description of pilgrimages made to Canterbury gives us a very\r\ngood idea of the varied character of the crowds setting forth upon their\r\njourney to that most popular of shrines; and we learn from him and from\r\nmany other contemporary sources that the bearing of these crowds was\r\nscarce what we should expect of miserable sinners, not only conscious of\r\ntheir sins, but humbly seeking that spiritual spring-clean--absolution.\r\nThey were gay and light-hearted, reckless, and exceedingly improper, and\r\nrarely failed to deeply scandalise the innkeepers along the roads.\r\n\r\nThe “Tabard,” whence Chaucer’s pilgrims set out on that April morning in\r\n1383, has long been a thing of the past. It was in 1307, one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven years after Becket’s martyrdom, that the Abbot of Hyde, at\r\nWinchester, built the first house, which seems to have been in two\r\nportions: one a guest-house for the brethren of Hyde and other clergy\r\ncoming to London to wait upon that mighty political and religious\r\npersonage, my Lord Bishop of Winchester, whose London palace stood close\r\nby, on Bankside; the other a more or less commercially conducted inn. When\r\nChaucer conferred immortality upon the “Tabard,” in 1383, the lessee of\r\nthat hostelry was the “Harry Bailly” of _The Canterbury Tales_, a real\r\nperson, and probably an intimate friend whom Chaucer thus delighted to\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nThis was no mere red-nosed and fat-paunched purveyor of sack and other\r\nquaint liquors of that time, but one who had been Member of Parliament for\r\nSouthwark in 1376 and again in 1379,[12] and was a person not only of\r\nconsiderable property, but a dignified and well-mannered\r\nman--better-mannered and of cleaner speech, we may suspect, than Chaucer’s\r\npilgrims themselves:\r\n\r\n  A seemly man our hostè was withal\r\n  For to have been a marshal in a hall.\r\n  A largè man was he, with eyen steep,\r\n  A fairer burgess is there none in Chepe;\r\n  Bold of his speech, and wise, and well ytaught;\r\n  And of manhóod lackèd righte nought,\r\n  Eke thereto he was right a merry man.\r\n\r\nSuch a host, and no less a person, could have sat at supper with his\r\nguests, even with such gentles as the Knight and his son, the Squire, and\r\nthe Lady Abbess; and thus only is he able to take charge of, and to assume\r\nleadership over, the party of twenty-nine on the long four days’\r\npilgrimage to Canterbury, and to reprove or praise each and all, according\r\nto his mind.\r\n\r\nThe “Tabard” derived its name from the sleeveless ceremonial heraldic\r\ncoat, tricked out with gold and colours, worn by heralds. At a\r\ncomparatively early date, however, the “science of fools,” as heraldry has\r\nseverely been called, grew neglected, and “tabards” became little\r\nunderstood by common people. The sign of the house was accordingly changed\r\nto the “Talbot” about 1599; but even that has grown mysterious, and only\r\nfolk with very special knowledge now know what a “talbot” was. In those\r\ndays the meaning was well understood, and especially at inns, for it was\r\nthe name of a fierce breed of dog--the old English hound, something\r\nbetween a mastiff and a bull-dog--kept chiefly by packmen to mount guard\r\nover their pack-horses and goods.\r\n\r\nBoth “Tabard” and “Talbot” are now nothing more substantial than memories.\r\nLittle could have been left of the historic house in 1676, when the great\r\nfire of Southwark swept away many of the old inns. A newer “Talbot” then\r\narose on the site, and stood until 1870: itself of so venerable an\r\nappearance that it was not difficult to persuade people of its being the\r\nveritable house whence Chaucer’s pilgrims set forth those many centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims only made Dartford the first night, a fifteen-miles’ journey\r\nthat would by no means satisfy those inclined nowadays to follow their\r\ntrail. We are not, however, vouchsafed any definite information as to\r\nDartford, and the oldest portions of the existing “Bull” inn there are\r\nnot, by perhaps two hundred years, old enough to have housed that\r\nmiscellaneous party. But there was an inn, frequented by pilgrims, at that\r\ntime upon the same site, and the “Bull” claims to be one of the oldest\r\nlicensed houses in Kent--as well it may, for it is known to date back to\r\n1450. In Chaucer’s time the landlord was, we are told, one Urban Baldock,\r\nhimself a friend of the poet, and the source whence a great deal of\r\ninformation respecting pilgrims and their ways was gathered by him for\r\n_The Canterbury Tales_.\r\n\r\nThe oldest part of the “Bull” is the courtyard, galleried after the\r\nancient style, but in these practical and in many ways unsentimental times\r\nroofed in with glass and used as a corn-market. Behind the carved wooden\r\nbalusters of the gallery are the bedrooms, until late years largely given\r\nup to dust and cobwebs, but now rebuilt and again in use. Those who care\r\nfor things that have had their day will think it fortunate that merely\r\nalteration, and not destruction, has been suffered here.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the “Bull” at Dartford is Georgian, and its long brick\r\nfront, with nine windows in a row, bears a strong family likeness to that\r\nof its namesake at Rochester. The bull himself, in great black effigy,\r\noccupies a monumental position among the chimney-pots, whence he looks\r\ndown, like Nelson in Trafalgar Square, upon busy streets.\r\n\r\nThere have been happenings at the “Bull” in times much later than those of\r\npilgrimage. On August 17th, 1775, a room off the gallery was the scene of\r\nan affray that led to Joseph Stacpoole, William Gapper, and James Lagier\r\nbeing indicted for shooting “John Parker, Esq.,” described as an Irish\r\ngentleman of fortune.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Joseph Stacpoole had lent John Parker and his brother\r\nFrancis various sums of money, amounting in all to £3,000, and had very\r\nseriously embarrassed himself in doing so. He could not succeed in getting\r\npayment, and as he had good reason to suspect that the Parkers intended to\r\nabscond over sea, he followed them to Dartford, with his attorney and a\r\nbailiff. Hearing that they were staying with some friends at the “Bull,”\r\nStacpoole sent Lagier, the bailiff, with a writ into the room they\r\noccupied, himself and Gapper following.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the hot-headed Parker see the bailiff than he cried out,\r\n“Zounds! where are my pistols?” and one of his friends dashed out a candle\r\nwith his hand and upset the only other. In this dim and dangerous\r\nsituation the bailiff, mortally afraid for himself, cried out for help,\r\nand Stacpoole and Gapper came rushing in. Parker’s friends then seized\r\nStacpoole by the collar, and seem to have shaken him so violently that\r\nthey shook off the contents of a carbine he was carrying, with the result\r\nthat Parker himself was shot through the body with three bullets. When\r\nthat happened Parker’s brother fled to London, a Mr. Masterson ran\r\ndownstairs, and a Mr. Bull, who had taken a prominent part in the\r\ncollaring, was in so great a hurry that he jumped over the gallery into\r\nthe yard.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Stacpoole and his two co-defendants did not take place until\r\nMarch 20th, 1777, when all were acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe last picturesque incident in the history of the “Bull” took place in\r\n1822, when George the Fourth came posting along the road and the post-boy\r\nstopped here to change horses. He had just asked Essenhigh, the landlord,\r\nwho that “damned pretty woman” was whom he saw at one of the windows, and\r\nmine host had only just replied that it was his wife, when a hostile\r\ncrowd, in sympathy with “the persecuted” Queen Caroline, who had died the\r\nyear before, began to “boo” and howl at the King. “When gentlemen meet,\r\ncompliments pass,” says the adage, and one Callaghan, a journeyman\r\ncurrier, thrust forward and roared out, in the face of the “First\r\nGentleman in Europe,” “You are a murderer!” a remark which possesses the\r\nrecommendation neither of truth nor politeness, and resulted, in this\r\ninstance, in the outrageous Callaghan being punched on the head and felled\r\nto the ground by one of the King’s faction. The King himself drove off in\r\nsuch a hurry that the postboy fell off his horse on leaving the town.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims’ hostels that once existed at Rochester are things of the\r\npast, but it seems not unlikely that the “George,” in the High Street,\r\nalmost opposite the Pickwickian “Bull,” was once something in this nature,\r\nfor although the modern frontage is absolutely uninteresting, not to say\r\ndistressingly ugly, and although it is now nothing more than a\r\npublic-house, the very large and very fine Early English crypt, now used\r\nas a beer-cellar, shows that a building of semi-ecclesiastical nature\r\nonce stood on the site. The “George” is an old sign, the present house\r\nbeing built on the ruins of one destroyed by fire a hundred and twenty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe crypt, built of chalk, with ribs and bosses of Caen stone, is roofed\r\nwith four-part vaulting, and is in four bays, the whole 54 ft. in length,\r\nby nearly 17 ft. wide, and 11 ft. high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRYPT AT THE “GEORGE,” ROCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nBeside the Dover Road, which is of course the pilgrims’ road from London\r\nto Canterbury, one mile short of Faversham town, stands the village of\r\nOspringe, identified by some antiquaries as the site of the Roman station\r\nof _Durolevum_. Time was when those who made pilgrimage to Canterbury came\r\nto Ospringe through a water-splash, a little stream that flowed across\r\nthe highway and no one thought worth while bridging. And so it remained,\r\nthrough the coaching age, until modern times. Now it is covered over, and\r\nOspringe is at this day a quite remarkably dusty place.\r\n\r\nThere remain, built into the “Red Lion” inn beside the way, fragments of a\r\n“maison Dieu,” or God’s House, that stood here so early as the time of\r\nHenry the Second: a hostel established for the reception of travellers,\r\nand maintained for many years by the Knights Templars and Brethren of the\r\nHoly Ghost. Here travellers of all classes found a lavish hospitality\r\nawaiting them, and, so sparsely settled was the country in those\r\ncenturies, that even kings were glad of this rest-house--and of others\r\nlike it elsewhere. King John, who was for ever spoiling the Church, and\r\nbringing upon himself, and the country with him, Papal excommunications\r\nmajor and minor, and yet was always sponging upon abbots and their kind\r\nfor board and lodging, had what is described as a _camera regis_ here,\r\nwhich seems to modern ears to indicate that he practised photography,\r\ncenturies before the invention of it. The _camera_ in this case is,\r\nhowever, only the mediæval chronicler’s Latin way of saying that a room\r\nwas kept for the King’s use.\r\n\r\nA landed gentleman of the neighbouring Preston-by-Faversham, one Macknade\r\nby name, who died in 1407, left, among many other bequests, £1 to the\r\n“Domus Dei” of Ospringe, together with £10 for the repair of the highway\r\nbetween that point and Boughton-under-Blean. In this manner he hoped to be\r\nremembered in the prayers of travellers; and to the same end of bidding\r\nfor Aves and paternosters for the repose of his soul, he bequeathed 20\r\npence to all prisoners in Kentish gaols, 12 pence to all debtors similarly\r\nsituated, £23 to the minor religious houses of the county, and a larger\r\nsum to the principal abbeys. In addition to these items we find one of 10\r\ncows, left to Preston church, for the purpose of maintaining a lighted\r\ntaper at the Easter Sepulchre there. Let us hope his solicitude for his\r\nsoul has not been without its due results.\r\n\r\nThe “maison Dieu” of Ospringe was disestablished long before the general\r\nruin of such institutions was ordained, in the time of Henry the Eighth.\r\nIn 1479 we find the place inhabited by two brethren, survivors of the\r\neight who once welcomed and made good cheer for pilgrims; but they forsook\r\nit the next year, and in 1480-81 it was, as a derelict religious house,\r\nescheated to the Crown.\r\n\r\nCanterbury itself was, of course, once full of such travellers’ rests.\r\nChief among these was the inn called “The Chequers of the Hope,” at the\r\ncorner of Mercery Lane, leading to the Cathedral; but, although the lower\r\npart of the walls and the mediæval crypt remain, the present aspect of the\r\nbuilding is modern and commonplace. It is, in point of fact, a “Ladies’\r\nOutfitting” shop.\r\n\r\nTravellers in those centuries seem to have been in many ways well cared\r\nfor. The hospitality of the “houses of God” and pilgrims’ halts, however,\r\ndoes but show the bright side of the medal, and implies a very dark\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nGood, charitable folks, as we have seen, were rightly sorry for wayfarers,\r\nand gave or bequeathed money for lightening the trials and tribulations of\r\ntheir lot. The Church itself regarded the succouring of all such as one of\r\nits first duties, and so granted all manner of ghostly privileges to such\r\npersons as would build causeways, improve roads, or establish hostels. The\r\nbargain seemed in those times a fair one, and induced many to give who\r\nwould not otherwise have given. To buy absolution for gold, or a few days\r\nless purgatory by charitable bequest was good business; but we may wonder\r\nif those who thus purchased remission of sins or an “early door” into\r\nParadise sometimes spared a pitying thought for those poor devils who had\r\nnot the needful for such indulgences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTGATE, CANTERBURY, AND THE “FALSTAFF” INN.]\r\n\r\nDay after day travellers--whose very name comes from “travail” = toil or\r\ntrouble--journeyed amid dangers, and, when by mischance they were\r\nbenighted, suffered agonies of apprehension. They intended only to\r\n“journey”--to travel by day, as the original sense of that word\r\nindicated--and were afflicted with the liveliest apprehensions when night\r\ncame and found them still on the road. Toiling in the hollow roads, deep\r\nin ruts and mud, with terror they saw the sun go down while yet the\r\nfriendly town was far away, and came at last, in fear and darkness, to the\r\nwalled city, only to find its gates closed for the night. Every\r\nfortified town closed its gates at sunset; else, in those dangerous times,\r\nwhat use your gates and walls? As reasonably might the modern citizen\r\nleave his street door wide open all night, as the mediæval town not close\r\nits gates when the hours of darkness were come; and so those travellers\r\nand pilgrims who, from much story-telling, praying, or feasting along the\r\nroad, arrived late at Canterbury, found the portals of Westgate sternly\r\nclosed against them. Originally they were obliged to lie outside, under\r\nthe walls or in the fields, instead of being made welcome at the\r\ncomfortable hostels within, where a man might find jolly company in the\r\nrush-strewn hall, and for food and drink be free of the best; but, for the\r\naccommodation of such laggards, the suburb of St. Dunstan, without the\r\nwalls of Canterbury, sprang up at a very early date, and to the custom\r\nthey thus brought we owe the existence of the “Falstaff” inn, itself\r\ncontaining some fine “linen-pattern” panelling of the time of Henry the\r\nSeventh; but not, of course, the original house that, under some other\r\nname than the “Falstaff,” was early established for the entertainment of\r\nlate-comers.\r\n\r\nThe “Falstaff” is a prominent feature of the entrance to Canterbury, and\r\nforms, with the stern drum towers of Westgate, built about 1380, as fine\r\nan entrance to a city as anything to be found in England. The present sign\r\nof the house derives from the instant and extraordinary popularity that\r\nShakespeare’s Fat Knight obtained, from his first appearance upon the\r\nElizabethan stage. The present “Falstaff” is a very spirited rendering,\r\nshowing the Fat Knight with sword and buckler and an air of determination,\r\napparently “just about to begin” on those numerous “men in buckram”\r\nconjured up by his ready imagination on Gad’s Hill. There is an air about\r\nthis representation of him irresistibly reminiscent of that song which\r\ngave British patriots in 1878 the name of “Jingoes.” There are no patriots\r\nnow: only partisans and placemen--but that is another tale. This Falstaff\r\nevidently “don’t want to fight; but by Jingo”--well, you know the rest of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGN OF THE “FALSTAFF,” CANTERBURY.]\r\n\r\nNot only pilgrims and travellers from London to Canterbury were thus\r\nlooked after, but those also coming the other way, and thus we find a\r\nMaison Dieu established at Dover in the reign of King John by that great\r\nman, Hubert de Burgh, Chief Justiciary of England. A master and a staff of\r\nbrethren and sisters were placed there to attend upon the poor priests\r\nand the pilgrims and strangers of both sexes, who applied for food and\r\nlodging. Kings cannot be classed in any of these categories; but they also\r\nare found not infrequently making use of the institution, on their way to\r\nor from France--and departing without a “thank ye.” The only one who seems\r\nto have benefited the Maison Dieu very much was Henry the Third, who\r\nendowed it with the tithe of the passage fare and £10 a year from the port\r\ndues.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce necessary to say who it was that disestablished the Maison\r\nDieu. The heavy hand of Henry the Eighth squelched it, in common with\r\nhundreds of other religious and semi-religious institutions. At the time\r\nof its suppression the annual income was £231 16_s._ 7_d._, representing\r\nsome £2,500 in our day. The master, John Thompson, who had only been\r\nappointed the year before, was an exceptionally fortunate man, being\r\ngranted a pension of £53 6_s._ 8_d._ a year. The buildings were then\r\nconverted into a victualling office for the Navy.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1831, the Corporation of Dover purchased them, and the ancient\r\nrefectory then became the Town Hall and the sacristy the Sessions House,\r\nand so remained until 1883, when a new Town Hall was built.\r\n\r\nSimilar institutions existed at others of the chief ports. At Portsmouth\r\nwas the Hospital of St. Nicholas, or “God’s House,” founded in the reign\r\nof Henry the Third by Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester. It is now\r\nthe Garrison Church. At Southampton the “Domus Dei” was dedicated to St.\r\nJulian, patron of travellers, and now, as St. Julian’s Hospital and\r\nChurch, is in part an almshouse, sheltering eight poor persons, and partly\r\na French Huguenot place of worship.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims’ Way to Canterbury from Southampton and Winchester was never\r\na road for wheeled traffic, and remained in all those centuries when\r\npilgrimage was popular, as a track for pedestrians, along the hillsides.\r\nIt avoided all towns, and thus precisely what those pilgrims who\r\nwearifully hoofed it all the way did for shelter remains a little obscure:\r\nalthough it seems probable that wayside shelters, with or without\r\noratories attached to them, were established at intervals. Such,\r\ntraditionally, was the origin of the picturesque timbered house at\r\nCompton, now locally known as “Noah’s Ark.”\r\n\r\nColchester was a place of import to pilgrims in old wayfaring times, for\r\nit lay along the line of the pilgrims’ trail to Walsingham. Among the inns\r\nof this town, and older than any of its fellows, but coyly hiding its\r\nantiquarian virtues of chamfered oaken beams and quaint galleries from\r\nsight, behind modern alterations, is the “Angel” in West Stockwell Street,\r\nwhose origin as a pilgrims’ inn is vouched for. Weary suppliants, on the\r\nway to, or returning from, the road of Our Lady of Walsingham, far away on\r\nthe road through and past Norwich, housed here, and misbehaved themselves\r\nin their mediæval way. It would, as already hinted, be the gravest\r\nmistake to assume pilgrims to have been, _quâ_ pilgrims, necessarily\r\ndecorous; and, indeed, modern Bank Holiday folks, compared with them,\r\nwould shine as true examples of monkish austerity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE FORMERLY A PILGRIMS’ HOSTEL, COMPTON.]\r\n\r\nThe shrine at Walsingham, very highly esteemed in East Anglia, drew crowds\r\nfrom every class, from king to beggar. The great Benedictine Abbey of St.\r\nJohn of Colchester sheltered some of the greatest of them, while others\r\ninned at such hostelries as the “Angel,” and the vulgar, or the merely\r\nimpecunious, if the weather were propitious, lay in the woods.\r\n\r\nPilgrims would boggle at nothing, as was well known at the time. That they\r\ncould not be trusted is evident enough in the custom of horse-masters, who\r\nlet out horses on hire to such travellers, at the rate of twelvepence from\r\nSouthwark to Rochester, and a further twelvepence from Rochester to\r\nCanterbury. They knew, those early keepers of livery-stables, that little\r\nchance existed of ever seeing their horses again unless they took\r\nsufficient precautions. They therefore branded their animals in a\r\nprominent and unmistakeable way, so that all should know such, found in\r\nstrange parts of the country, to be stolen.\r\n\r\nIll fared the unsuspecting burgess who met any of these sinners on the way\r\nto plenary indulgence, for they would, not unlikely, murder him for the\r\nsake of anything valuable he carried; or, out of high spirits and the\r\nsheer fun of the thing, cudgel him into a jelly; arguing, doubtless, that\r\nas they were presently to turn over a new leaf, it mattered little how\r\nsoiled was the old one. Drunkenness and crime, immorality, obscenity, and\r\nlicence of the grossest kind were, in fact, the inevitable accompaniments\r\nof pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “STAR,” ALFRISTON.]\r\n\r\nAlthough East Anglia was in the old days more plentifully supplied with\r\ngreat monastic houses than any other district in England, the destruction\r\nwrought in later centuries has left all that part singularly poor in the\r\narchitectural remains of them: and even the once-necessary guest-houses\r\nand hostels have shared the common fate. That charming miniature little\r\nhouse, the “Green Dragon” at Wymondham, in Norfolk, may, however, as\r\ntradition asserts, have once been a pilgrims’ inn dependent upon the great\r\nBenedictine Abbey, whose gaunt towers, now a portion of the parish church,\r\nrise behind its peaked roofs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARVING AT THE “STAR,” ALFRISTON.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful little Sussex village of Alfriston--whose name, by the way,\r\nin the local shibboleth, is “Arlston”--a rustic gem not so well known as\r\nit deserves, possesses a very fine pilgrims’ inn, the “Star,” a relic of\r\nold days when the bones of St. Richard of Chichester led many a foot-sore\r\npenitent across the downs to Chichester, in quest of a clean spiritual\r\nbill of health. Finely carved woodwork is a distinguishing feature of this\r\ninn, whose roof, too, has character of its own, in the heavy slabs of\r\nstone that do duty for slates, and bear witness to the exceptional\r\nstrength of the roof-tree that has sustained them all these centuries. The\r\ndemoniac-looking figure seen on the left-hand of the illustration is not,\r\nas might perhaps at first sight be supposed, a mediæval effigy of Old\r\nNick, or an imported South Sea Islander’s god, but the figure-head of some\r\nforgotten ship of the seventeenth century, wrecked on the neighbouring\r\ncoast, off Cuckmere Haven. Ancient carvings still ornament the wood-work\r\nof the three upper projecting windows, the one particularly noticeable\r\nspecimen being a variant of the George and Dragon legend, where the saint,\r\nwith a mouth like a potato, no nose to speak of, and a chignon, is seen\r\nunexpectedly on foot, thrusting his lance into the mouth of the dragon,\r\nwho appears to be receiving it with every mark of enjoyment, which the\r\nadditional face he is furnished with, in his tail, does not seem to share.\r\nThe left foot of the saint has been chipped off. All the exterior woodwork\r\nhas been very highly varnished and painted in glaring colours, from the\r\ngroups under the windows to the green monkey and green bear contending on\r\nthe angle-post for the possession of a green trident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GREEN DRAGON,” WYMONDHAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PILGRIMS’ HOSTEL, BATTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe old pilgrims’ hospice of Battle Abbey still remains outside the great\r\ngateway, and now offers refreshments to those modern pilgrims who flock in\r\nthousands, by chars-à-banc, on cycles, or afoot, to Battle in search of\r\nthe picturesque; or merely, in many cases, to complete the conventional\r\nround of sight-seeing prescribed for visitors to Hastings. It is a\r\ntypically Sussexian building of domestic appearance, framed in stout oak\r\ntimbering, and filled with plaster and rubble, and was probably built\r\nearly in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “New” Inn, at Gloucester, when actually new, the matter of\r\nfour hundred and fifty years ago, was erected especially for the\r\naccommodation of pilgrims flocking to the tomb of the murdered King Edward\r\nthe Second, who, by no means a saintly character in life, was in death\r\nraised by popular sentiment to the status of something very like a holy\r\nmartyr. He had been weak and vicious, but those who on September 21st,\r\n1327, put him to a dreadful death in the dungeons of Berkeley Castle acted\r\non behalf of others worse than he, and the horror and the injustice of it\r\nhad the not unnatural effect of almost canonising the slain monarch.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot of St. Peter’s at Gloucester, John Thokey, when all others,\r\nfearing the vengeance of the murderers, dared not give the King’s body\r\nburial, begged it and buried it, with much reverence, within the Abbey\r\nwalls. His Abbey, now the Cathedral of Gloucester, reaped unexpected\r\nbenefits from the humane instincts of that good and pitiful man, for\r\n“miracles” were wrought at the “martyr’s” tomb, and abundant\r\nthank-offerings continued to flow in, and at last enabled the great Abbey\r\nto be rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “NEW INN,” GLOUCESTER.]\r\n\r\nIt became eventually a pressing need to provide housing outside the\r\nAbbot’s lodgings for the stream of pilgrims, and accordingly the New\r\nInn was built in the middle of the fifteenth century (1450-1457) by\r\nJohn Twynning, a monk of that establishment, of whom we know little or\r\nnothing else than that he was, according to the records of his time, a\r\n“laudable man.” It remained until quite recent years the property of the\r\nDean and Chapter of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nThe inn is reached through an archway in Northgate Street, and is\r\narranged, as usual in mediæval inns, around a courtyard. Still the old\r\ngables look down upon the yard and, as of yore, the ancient galleries,\r\nrescued from the decay and neglect of some seventy years ago, run partly\r\naround first and second floors. Existing side by side with those antique\r\nfeatures, the quaint windowed bar of the coaching era is now itself a\r\ncuriosity. In short, mediæval picturesqueness, Jacobean carved oak,\r\ncommercial and coffee-rooms of the coaching age, and modern comforts\r\nconjoin at the New Inn, so that neither a wayworn pilgrim, were such an\r\none likely to appear, nor a seventeenth century horseman, nor even a\r\nGeorgian coachman, redolent of the rum-punch that was the favourite drink\r\nin coaching days, would seem out of place.\r\n\r\nSummer and autumn transfigure the courtyard into the likeness of a rustic\r\nbower, for it is plentifully hung with virginia-creepers, from amidst\r\nwhose leaves the plaster lion who mounts guard on the roof of the bar\r\nlooks as though he were gazing forth from his native jungle.\r\n\r\nI do not know in what way John Twynning--or Twining, as we should no\r\ndoubt in modern times call him--was to be reckoned laudable, but if he\r\nwere thought praiseworthy for anything outside his religious duties it was\r\nprobably by reason of the skill with which he built this pilgrims’ hostel.\r\nYou perceive little of his work from the street, for at that extraordinary\r\nperiod when stucco was fashionable and plaster all the rage, the timbered\r\nfront of the building was covered up in that manner, and so remains. But\r\nthe great building is still constructionally the house that\r\nfifteenth-century monk left, and how well and truly he built it, let its\r\nsound and stable condition, after four centuries and a half of constant\r\nuse, tell.\r\n\r\nSuch modern touches as there are about this quaintly named “New” inn are\r\nthe merest light clothing upon its ancient body, and the sitting-rooms and\r\nforty or so bedrooms, cosy and comfortable to us moderns, are but modern\r\nin their carpets and fittings, and in the paper that decorates their\r\nwalls, in between the stout dark timber framing.\r\n\r\nThe house is built chiefly of chestnut, traditionally obtained from\r\nHighnam, some three miles from the city; and everywhere the enormous\r\nbeams, in some places polished, in others rough, are to be seen. In their\r\nroughest, most timeworn condition, they overhang the narrow passage now\r\ncalled New Inn (formerly Pilgrims’) Lane, where, at the angle, a most\r\nornately carved corner-post, very much injured, exhibits a mutilated angel\r\nholding a scroll, in the midst of fifteenth-century tabernacle-work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURTYARD, “NEW INN,” GLOUCESTER.]\r\n\r\nAs usual in these ancient inns with courtyards and galleries, plays and\r\ninterludes were formerly acted here, and it is said that the accession of\r\nQueen Elizabeth was proclaimed on these flagstones.\r\n\r\nThat galleries open to the air, with the bedrooms and others giving upon\r\nthem, were not so inconvenient as generally nowadays supposed is evident\r\nenough here, where they are still in use, as they were centuries ago. The\r\nonly difference is that they are carpeted nowadays, instead of being bare\r\nfloors.\r\n\r\nA staircase from the courtyard leads up to the first-floor gallery, still\r\nscreened off by the old open-lattice gates reaching from floor to ceiling,\r\noriginally intended to prevent stray dogs entering.\r\n\r\nPortions of the “New Inn” let off in the days of its declining prosperity\r\nhave in modern times been taken back again: among them the large\r\ndining-hall overlooking the lane, for many years used as a Sunday school\r\nfor the children of St. Nicholas parish, and other rooms looking upon\r\nNorthgate Street.\r\n\r\nIn short, the old “New” inn impresses the beholder with a very insistent\r\nsense of being a live institution, a “going concern.” Most ancient inns of\r\nthis character are merely poor survivals; archæologically interesting, but\r\nwan veterans tottering to decay and long deserted by custom. Here,\r\nhowever, there is heavy traffic down in the yard: the ostler is busy in\r\nhis “Ostry” (the name is painted over the door), bells are ringing, people\r\nand luggage coming and going; the big railway parcel-office is as full of\r\nparcels as it could have been when it was a coach-office; appetising\r\nscents come from glowing kitchens, and to and from private rooms are\r\ncarried trays of as good things as ever pilgrims feasted upon, at the end\r\nof their pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nThere existed, until about 1859, another very notable “New” inn, probably\r\nthe work of the Abbots of Sherborne, and intended for the reception of\r\nvisitors to that beautiful Dorsetshire abbey. That splendid old hostelry,\r\nwith a noble front of yellow sandstone, built in the Perpendicular style\r\nof architecture, probably about 1420, was the finest example of an inn of\r\nits period in England, but it was ruthlessly, and with incredible\r\nstupidity, demolished, and the only pictorial record of it appears to be\r\nan entirely inadequate, severe, and unsympathetic little wood-cut in\r\nParker’s _Domestic Architecture_.[13] It figures in Mr. Thomas Hardy’s\r\nstory of _The Woodlanders_ as the “Earl of Wessex” inn at “Sherton Abbas.”\r\n\r\nIt was in those “good old days” that are so interesting to read about, and\r\nwere so ill to live in, that the ancient hospice flourished most bravely.\r\nWhen ways were not merely rough and lonely, but were also infested by\r\n“sturdye beggaris,” “maysterless men,” and others who would not hesitate\r\nto do the solitary traveller a hurt, the good abbots or monks who\r\nestablished wayside houses of entertainment where no secular innkeeper\r\ndared were truly benefactors to their species. The relic of just such a\r\nplace, on a road once extremely lonely and dangerous, is to be found along\r\nthe present highway between Brecon and Llandovery, in South Wales, some\r\ntwo miles westward of the town of Brecon. The road runs terraced above the\r\nsouthern bank of the river Usk, through a rugged country where, in ancient\r\ntimes, Welsh chieftains and outlaws, alike lawless and beggarly, knocked\r\nthe solitary traveller on the head and went over his pockets amid the\r\nappropriately dramatic scenery of beetling crag and splashing waterfall.\r\nAt the gate of this lurk of bandits the holy monks of Malvern Priory\r\nfounded an hospitium, on the spot where stand to-day the ancient and\r\npicturesque church and the few houses of the village of Llanspyddid: whose\r\nWelsh name, indeed, means the Hospice Church.\r\n\r\nNothing, unfortunately, is left of that “spythy,” or hospice, they so\r\npiously built and maintained, for, its usefulness long overpast, it was\r\nleft to decay: but the church they built, in which travellers returned\r\nthanks for the succour vouchsafed them, remains by the roadside. It is a\r\nromantic-looking church, placed in an appropriate setting of extremely\r\nancient and funereal-looking yews that lead up darkly to the heavy north\r\nporch, beautifully decorated with carved woodwork.\r\n\r\nThe “George” at Glastonbury presents the finest exterior of all these\r\npilgrims’ inns, for it stands to-day very much as it did in the time of\r\nEdward the Sixth, when it was built (1475) by Abbot John Selwood for the\r\naccommodation of such pilgrims as were not personages. There has ever been\r\na subtle distinction between a personage and a mere person. The great\r\nones, the high and mighty of the land, on pilgrimage were made much of,\r\nand entertained by my lord Abbot in appropriately princely fashion, in the\r\nAbbot’s lodgings: the middle-class pilgrims were lodged at the Abbot’s\r\ninn, and the residue lay where best they might: perhaps in some\r\nguesten-hall, or possibly in the open air.\r\n\r\nPilgrimages to Glastonbury were less numerous and popular than those to\r\nthe pre-eminent Shrine of the Blessed St. Thomas at Canterbury, but they\r\nwere not few, for the story of this great mitred Somersetshire Abbey is\r\none of the marvels and legendary wonders that, however greatly they may\r\nstagger the twentieth-century capacity for belief, were of old implicitly\r\nrelied upon. Few were those who in mediæval times questioned their\r\ngenuineness, and those who did so kept their doubts prudently to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis marvellous lore narrates how it was to St. Joseph of Arimathea that\r\nthe Abbey owed its origin. In A.D. 63 he came, with eleven companions,\r\nwandering among the bogs and morasses of this western land, and discovered\r\nthis elevated ground rising above the marshes, further topped by the\r\ncommanding peak of Glastonbury Tor. “Weary all!” they exclaimed, as they\r\nsank down, exhausted, on the spot called Weary All Hill to this day,\r\nalthough its name is properly “Wirrall.” Here St. Joseph thrust his staff\r\ninto the ground, and, taking root and blossoming every Christmas Day for\r\nover fourteen hundred years, it was known in all Christendom as the Holy\r\nThorn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GEORGE,” GLASTONBURY.]\r\n\r\nThe Holy Thorn itself was a sight to see, for, whatever its origin, it did\r\nactually blossom on or about Christmas, as descendants from the parent\r\nstock do to this day. The original hawthorn--or what was looked upon in\r\nthe time of Queen Elizabeth as the original--was fanatically attacked by\r\nan early Puritan who succeeded in felling one of its two trunks, and was\r\nproceeding to destroy the other, when he struck his leg instead, and had\r\nan eye gouged out by a flying chip: an incident that would have pleased\r\nthe old monks, had they not been dead and gone a generation earlier. This\r\ncapacity in the Holy Thorn for taking its own part did not avail when a\r\nCromwellian soldier-saint, a half-century or so later, cut it down.\r\nNothing in the tragical way appears to have happened to him.\r\n\r\nAn object of even greater veneration than the Holy Thorn was the body of\r\nSt. Dunstan, stolen by the monks of Glastonbury from Canterbury, and for\r\nlong centuries a source of great revenue, in the shape of offerings from\r\nthe faithful, eager for his spiritual good offices or for the healing\r\ntouch of his relics.\r\n\r\nThat which was too staggering for the belief of old-time pilgrims was\r\nnever discovered. At Glastonbury they were shown a part of Moses’ rod,\r\nsome milk and some hair of the Virgin, part of the hem of the Saviour’s\r\ngarment, a nail from the Cross, and a thorn from the Crown of Thorns. No\r\none ever questioned those blasphemous mediæval Barnums, who showed a\r\nsample of the manna that fed the children of Israel, and the incredible\r\nitem of “the dust of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, the three children\r\nsacrificed in the burning fiery furnace, with the bone of one of them”;\r\nand so they humbugged the devout for centuries.\r\n\r\nPilgrims of all kinds, bringing offerings, each one according to his\r\nmeans, were clearly to be encouraged, and there was from a very early\r\nperiod an “Abbot’s Inn” at Glastonbury. This stood on the site of the\r\npresent “White Hart” until about 1755, when, to prevent it falling, it was\r\npulled down. It had, however, ceased to be the Abbot’s Inn about 1489, the\r\nnewly built “George” then taking its place. How dilapidated was the more\r\nancient building may be understood from the story which tells of an\r\nauction being held on an upper floor, just before its demolition. “Going,\r\ngoing!” exclaimed the auctioneer, and then, as he accepted a bid, “Gone!”:\r\nwhereupon the entire flooring of the room gave way, and every one and\r\neverything were, with a tremendous crash, precipitated down to the ground\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nAbbot Selwood, who ruled from 1456 to 1493, built the “George” for\r\nmiddle-class pilgrims, and gave them board and lodging free for two days.\r\nHe did so from a strictly business point of view; and we may even suspect\r\nthat, if his guests made a longer stay, he recompensed himself by\r\novercharging.\r\n\r\nAlthough a room is shown in which King Henry the Eighth is said to have\r\nslept--heavens! did they treat _him_ as a middle-class pilgrim?--and a\r\nroom with oaken beams is termed the “Abbot’s Room,” there is little to be\r\nseen within, save the original stone newel staircase leading upstairs and\r\na stone bench in the cellar now christened the Penitents’ Seat, on which,\r\nif you please, sinners under conviction sat, with water up to their knees.\r\nFor my part, although the perennial spring is there, I remain sceptical of\r\naught but beer-barrels and hogsheads of wine ever having occupied that\r\nPenitents’ Form. Penitents frequenting the cellars where the booze is kept\r\nare suspect.\r\n\r\nThe exterior, however, is a very fine example of the late Perpendicular\r\nphase of Gothic architecture, as applied to domestic or semi-domestic\r\nuses. The battlements formerly had stone figures peering from each\r\nembrasure, figures traditionally said to have represented the Twelve\r\nCæsars, or the Twelve Apostles. Exactly _how_ this was managed can hardly\r\nbe seen, for there are but seven openings. Only one figure now remains,\r\nand he looks little like a Cæsar, and very much less like an Apostle.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the “George” is a “family and commercial” hotel. Its\r\nnotepaper would seem to indicate that it is not the house for Dissenters,\r\nfor it displays, beneath a mitre and crossed croziers, an aspiration in\r\nLatin to the effect that “May the Anglican Church Flourish.” Our withers\r\nare wrung: we are galled, and wince.\r\n\r\nThe “Red Lion,” opposite the “George,” with fine stone-embayed window and\r\nfrontage dated 1659, was formerly the Porter’s Lodge and gateway of the\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\nA very spirited view of Glastonbury, including the “George,” in the\r\neighteenth century was executed, as an etching, by Rowlandson, and shows\r\nus, in his inimitable manner, the life and bustle of an old English\r\ncountry town on market-day. There you see a post-chaise and four being\r\ndriven at top speed through the town, bringing disaster to a woman dealer\r\nin crockery, whose donkey, lashing out with his hind-legs, is upsetting\r\nthe contents of his panniers; and there at the town-pump, in those days\r\nbefore house-to-house water-supply, are the gossipping servants, very\r\nbeefy about the ankles, filling their pitchers and pipkins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGH STREET, GLASTONBURY, IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. _From\r\nthe etching by Rowlandson._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPILGRIMS’ INNS AND MONASTIC HOSTELS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt St. Albans we have still something in the way of a pilgrim’s inn. St.\r\nAlbans was, of course, the home of the wonder-working shrine of St. Alban,\r\nthe proto-martyr of Britain, and by direct consequence a place of great\r\npilgrimage and a town of many inns. Here is the “George,” one of the\r\npleasantest of the old inns remaining in the place, with an old, but\r\nscarce picturesque frontage, relieved from lack of interest by a quaint\r\nsundial, inscribed _Horas non numero nisi serenas_, and a more than\r\nusually picturesque courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe house is mentioned so early as 1448 as the “George upon the Hupe.” In\r\nthose times it possessed an oratory of its own, referred to in an ancient\r\nlicence, by which the Abbot authorised the innkeeper to have Low Mass\r\ncelebrated on the premises, for the benefit of “such great men and nobles,\r\nand others, as shall be lodged here.”\r\n\r\nLet us try to imagine that inn, licensed for the sale of wine and\r\nspirituous liquors and for religious services! It seems odd, but after all\r\nnot so odd as these mad times of our own, when public-houses are converted\r\ninto missions, and ordained clergymen of the Church of England become\r\npublicans and serve drinks across the counter in the interest of\r\ntemperance and good behaviour.[14]\r\n\r\nNo traces of that oratory now remain in the “George.” It is one of the\r\nmost comfortable of old houses, and full of old panelling and old prints\r\nand furniture, but the “great men and nobles” have long ceased to lodge\r\nhere, and it is now only frequented by “others.” The chapel was desecrated\r\nat the time of the Reformation, and was afterwards in use as part of the\r\nstables.\r\n\r\nThe carving seen in the illustration over the archway is no integral part\r\nof the inn, but was brought from old Holywell House in 1837, on the\r\ndestruction of that mansion, of which it formed the decorative pediment.\r\n\r\nThe Church, as already shown, was the earliest innkeeper in those days\r\nwhen travellers travailed in difficulties and dangers; and semi-religious\r\nbodies often acted the same hospitable part. The Knights Templars and the\r\nKnights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem kept hostelries at various\r\nplaces, prominent among them the old house which is now the “Angel” at\r\nGrantham.\r\n\r\nThe “Angel,” in common with other inns of the same name, derived its sign\r\nin the far-off thirteenth century from a religious picture-sign of the\r\nAnnunciation, and we may readily see how, in the fading of the picture,\r\nthe rest of the group gradually sank out of sight, leaving only that\r\nbright announcing messenger visible to passers-by. Undoubtedly the “Angel”\r\nat Islington obtained its name in this way: staggering though the thought\r\nmay be to those who know that merely secular public-house, in that roaring\r\nvortex of London traffic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GEORGE,” ST. ALBANS.]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of greeting in the pose of the angelic figure led in course\r\nof time to such a sign being often called the “Salutation”: hence the\r\nvarious old inns of that name in different parts of the country were\r\noriginally “Angels.”\r\n\r\nThe “Angel” at Grantham is a quaint admixture of ancient and modern. It\r\nwas a hostel, and bore this name even so early as the reign of King John,\r\nfor beneath its roof that monarch held his Court in the February of 1213.\r\nWe do not, however, find anything nowadays so ancient in the “Angel,” for\r\nevery vestige of the building in which that shifty and evasive monarch\r\nlodged has disappeared. This is by no means to say that the “Angel” is of\r\nrecent date. It belongs in part to the mid-fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies--a more than respectable age. From the midst of the town of\r\nGrantham it looks out upon the Great North Road, and in truth, facing a\r\nhighway of so great and varied historic doings, no building can have\r\nwitnessed more in the way of varied processions. History, made visible,\r\nhas passed by, in front of these windows, for at least five hundred years,\r\nbeginning with the gorgeous cavalcades of kings and courts and armies\r\ngoing or coming on missions of peace or war to and from Scotland, and at\r\nlast--what a contrast!--ending with the hotel omnibus to or from the\r\nrailway-station, with the luggage of “commercials.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “ANGEL,” GRANTHAM.]\r\n\r\nA very tragical incident in history was enacted in the great room, now\r\ndivided into three, that once extended the whole length of the frontage on\r\nthe first floor. Perhaps it was in the bay of the beautiful Gothic oriel\r\nwindow lighting this room that Richard the Third signed the death-warrant\r\nof the Duke of Buckingham, October 19th, 1483. That it was signed in this\r\nroom we know. What was his manner when he put his hand to that deed? Did\r\nhe declaim anything in the “off with his head; so much for Buckingham,”\r\ndramatic way, as we are led by Colley Cibber’s stage-version of\r\nShakespeare’s _Richard the Third_ to suppose he did? Or did he silently\r\ntreat it as a matter of stern, imperious necessity of statecraft? Had he\r\npossessed the dramatic sense, he certainly would have mouthed some such\r\nbloodthirsty phrase, and, turning on his heel in the self-satisfied\r\nattitude of triumphant villainy we know so well, would have made a\r\nstriking exit, as per stage directions, curling a villainous and\r\ncontemptuous lip, in the manner that never yet failed to bring down the\r\nheartfelt hatred, and the hisses, of the gallery.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to be sadly supposed that the King did nothing of that\r\nsort. He could not play to the gallery--for it was not there; he probably\r\ndid not turn upon his heel, nor curl his lip, for the Stage, whence you\r\nlearn the trick of these things, had not yet come into existence. And if\r\nyou do but consider it, most of the great doings of the world, bloody or\r\nlegislative, or what not, have been done--not, if it please you,\r\n“enacted”--without a due sense of their dramatic and spectacular\r\npossibilities. They all came in the day’s work, and the issues were too\r\ntremendous, the risks too great and impending, for the personages involved\r\nin them to enjoy the leisure for posing.\r\n\r\nThe old embayed stone frontage of the “Angel” has survived many a shock\r\nand buffet of Time, and, although the mullions of most of its windows have\r\nlong since been removed, in the not unnatural demand for more light, the\r\nantiquity of the house is manifest to the most commercial, and least\r\nantiquarian, traveller. On either side of the Gothic archway by which you\r\nenter, the carved heads of Edward the Third and his heroic Queen Philippa\r\nstill appear, and at the crown of the arch, serving the purpose of a\r\nsupporting corbel to the beautiful oriel window above, is a sculptured\r\nangel supporting a shield of arms.\r\n\r\nThe historic “Angel,” scene of so many centuries of conviviality, has long\r\nbeen made to foster the cause of temperance. Indeed, for two hundred years\r\npast, ages before Temperance became a Cause with capital letters and\r\ncapital endowments, the rent of the house went towards this object, under\r\nthe will of one Michael Solomon, who, dying in 1706, directed that a\r\nsermon should be annually preached in Grantham church, “strongly\r\ndenouncing drunkenness,” the cost to be met out of the rental of the\r\n“Angel.” But the most cynical stroke of chance befell in November, 1905,\r\nwhen the preacher of this counterblast against drink, paid for out of the\r\nprofits of a licensed house, was the Reverend Gerald Goodwin, son of the\r\nchief proprietor of a prominent Newark brewery.\r\n\r\nThe “George,” at Norton St. Philip, claiming to have been licensed in\r\n1397, has stirring history, as well as antiquity and beauty, to recommend\r\nit. You who are curious as to where the village of Norton stands may take\r\nthe map of Somerset and presently, scanning the county to the south of\r\nBath, discover it set down about seven miles to the south of that ancient\r\ncity, in a somewhat sequestered district. The reason of so large and so\r\ngrand a hostelry being in existence since the Middle Ages in so small a\r\nvillage is not, at the first blush, evident, and it is only when the\r\nancient history of Norton itself is explored that the wherefore of it is\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that the land hereabout was in those far-off times the\r\nproperty of the old Priory of Hinton Charterhouse--that old Carthusian\r\nhouse whose brethren were the best farmers, wool-growers, and\r\nstock-raisers of their time in the West Country. As early as the reign of\r\nHenry the Third the monastery was licensed to hold a fair here in May, on\r\nthe vigil, the feast, and the morrow of the festival of SS. Philip and\r\nJames; and again, in 1284, secured a charter conferring the right of\r\nholding a market at “Norton Charterhouse” every Friday, instead of, as\r\nformerly, at the bleak and much-exposed Hinton. In 1345 the Priory was\r\nfurther empowered to annually hold a fair on the feast of the Decollation\r\nof St. John at Norton: an institution that, although the Priory went the\r\nway of all its kind over five hundred and fifty years ago, remained a\r\nyearly fixture on August 28th and 29th until quite recent times. It was\r\nknown locally, for some reason now undiscoverable, as “Norton Dog Fair.”\r\n\r\nThe fair in its last years degenerated into the usual thing we understand\r\nnowadays as a fair: a squalid exhibition of Fat Women and Two-headed\r\nCalves; a gaudy and strepitous saturnalia of roundabouts and mountebanks;\r\nbut it was--or they were, for, as we have already seen, there were at one\r\ntime two--originally highly important business conventions. The principal\r\nbusiness then transacted was the selling of wool and cloth, and it was for\r\nthe purpose of helping their trade as wool-growers, and for the benefit\r\ngenerally of their very lucrative fairs, that the monks of Hinton\r\nCharterhouse in the fourteenth century built as a hostel that which is\r\nto-day the “George” inn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GEORGE,” NORTON ST. PHILIP.]\r\n\r\nFor generations the merchants and wool-staplers exposed their wares and\r\ndid their business in the street, or in a large upper room of the house,\r\nand long continued to do so when in course of time the whole thing had\r\nbeen altogether secularised.\r\n\r\nThe cyclist who comes to Norton St. Philip from Bath has a weary time of\r\nit, among the hills, by Odd Down, Midford, and Freshford; and only when he\r\nhas come uphill to windy Hinton Charterhouse are his toils over, and the\r\nrest of the way easy. It is a broad, modern road, but the observant may\r\nyet see the disused Abbot’s Way going, narrow, and even more steep, over\r\nthe fields, to the left hand; and we may well imagine the joy of the old\r\ntravellers along it when they saw the grey church tower in the village,\r\nnestling in a fold of the hills, and heard those sweet-toned bells of\r\nNorton that still sound so mellow on the ear, and are the identical “very\r\nfine ring of six bells” that Pepys heard on June 12th, 1668, and\r\npronounced “mighty tuneable.”\r\n\r\nThe “George” keeps unmistakable evidences of its semi-ecclesiastical\r\norigin, and the Gothic character of the solid stonework in the lower\r\nstorey points to the latter half of the fourteenth century. The curious\r\nand exceedingly picturesque contrast between the massive masonry below and\r\nthe overhanging timbered upper part has led, without any other evidence,\r\nto the conjecture that the house must at some time have suffered from\r\nfire, or otherwise been injured and partly rebuilt; but such instances of\r\nmixed methods in ancient building are numerous.\r\n\r\nHistory of a romantic kind has been enacted here, for it was in the street\r\nof Norton St. Philip, that a furious skirmish was fought, June 26th, 1685,\r\nbetween the untrained and badly armed rustics of the rebel Duke of\r\nMonmouth, and the soldiers of King James, under command of the weak and\r\nvacillating Lord Feversham. The rebel peasantry, armed only with pikes,\r\nscythes, and billhooks, that day withstood and routed their enemies, and\r\nthey held the village that night, Monmouth himself sleeping in one of the\r\nfront bedrooms of the “George.” It was while dressing at this window the\r\nfollowing morning that he was fired at by some unknown person desirous of\r\nearning the reward offered by James for the taking of his nephew’s life.\r\nThe bullet, however, sped harmlessly by that preserver and champion of the\r\nProtestant liberties of the country: hence the invincible anonymity of the\r\nfirer of that shot. Had Monmouth died thus, it is conceivable he would\r\nhave come down to us a more manly historic figure.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the “George” is woefully disappointing, after the\r\nexpectations raised by the noble exterior. It was obviously never ornately\r\nfitted, and long generations of neglect and misuse have resulted in the\r\nhouse being, internally, little better than a mere wreck, with the\r\ninstallation of a vulgar bar to insult the Gothic feeling of the place.\r\nThe property now belongs to the Bath Brewery Company, and is not merely\r\nthat abomination, a “tied house,” but is maintained in a barely habitable\r\ncondition, the Company being reported of opinion that the Somersetshire\r\nArchæological Society--interested, as all archæologists must be, in a\r\nhouse so architecturally and historically interesting--should restore the\r\nbuilding. If that report be true, it is a striking example of colossal\r\nimpudence.\r\n\r\nOn the ground-floor, the present Tap-room keeps a large fire-place with\r\nold-fashioned grate. Above, mounting by a stone spiral staircase to the\r\nfirst floor, is the room used by Monmouth (the one to the right hand in\r\nthe view), and known as the “King’s Room.” Its door, floor, and walls are\r\nof the roughest, as also are those of the adjoining room. On the floor\r\nabove, running the whole length of the building, under the roof, is the\r\nlong room used by the old wool-merchants as their market: and a darksome\r\nand makeshift place, under the roof-timbers, it is, and must have been at\r\nthe best of times. To-day the floor is rotten, and you must go delicately,\r\nlest you fall through to the next floor, and then through that to the\r\nground, where only the explorer can feel secure.\r\n\r\nIt is the same tale of far-gone decay in the yard, to which you enter, as\r\nalso to the house itself, by the great archway in the village street. It\r\nwas always a small yard, but was partly galleried. The tottering remains\r\nof the gallery, with brewhouse below, are left, still filled with the\r\nenormous casks built in the brewhouse itself, and only to be removed by\r\ndemolishing them. The rooms are mere ruins. If ever the interior and the\r\nyard of the “George” are restored it will be a great and an expensive\r\nwork; but it is to be feared that, Norton St. Philip being an unlikely\r\nplace for lengthened resort--visitors coming from curiosity from Bath for\r\nmerely an hour or so--such a work will never be undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn even worse case, from an archæologist’s point of view, is the “George”\r\nat Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire; for it stands in the High Street of a\r\nbusy little town, and has been disastrously altered in recent years by the\r\nbrewers who own it. Brewers have no undue leanings toward historic or\r\narchitectural sentiment, and in this instance their object was to fit\r\ntheir house for use as a commercial hotel. Accordingly, they caused the\r\nancient stone face to be pulled down and have replaced it by an imitation\r\ntimbered gabled front. Something of what the old front was like may be\r\ndiscovered at the back, where the date, 1583, may be seen on the\r\nstonework, together with an inscription to the effect that it was restored\r\nin 1706.\r\n\r\nThe “George” was originally built as a pilgrims’ inn by the Abbots of\r\nWinchcombe and Hayles, whose noted West Country shrines attracted many\r\nthousands of the pious and the sinful in days gone by. At Winchcombe they\r\nhad the body of St. Kenelm, the Saxon boy-king who succeeded to the\r\nthrone of Mercia in A.D. 822, and, according to legendary lore, was\r\nmurdered at the instigation of his sister Cwoenthryth, who desired his\r\nplace. Kenelm was but seven years of age, but already so pious, if we are\r\nto believe the story, that the poisons at first administered to him\r\nrefused their customary effects, and there was nothing for it but to\r\nstrike his head off. Piety, therefore, was not proof against cold steel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARD OF THE “GEORGE,” NORTON ST. PHILIP.]\r\n\r\nHis tutor, the treacherous Askobert, was induced to perform this act, in\r\nthe lonely forest of Clent. To the astonishment of Askobert, a white dove\r\nflew from the severed neck and soared away into the sky. Naturally\r\nsurprised by such a marvel, he nevertheless was not unnerved, and buried\r\nthe body under a thorn-bush and went his way. Cwoenthryth in due course\r\nsucceeded, and reigned for some two years, when the inevitable vengeance\r\nfell. It came about in a curious way--as do all these retributions in\r\nmonastic legends. The Pope was celebrating Mass in his Cathedral of St.\r\nPeter when a dove that had been observed there poised itself over the high\r\naltar and dropped from its beak a piece of parchment inscribed, “In Clent\r\nin Cowbach Kenelm Kynge’s child lieth under a thorn, his head taken from\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThis strange message was conveyed to England, and an expedition, formed of\r\nthe monks of Winchcombe and Worcester, set off to the forest of Clent.\r\nArrived there, the expeditionary force was guided to the thorn-tree by a\r\nwhite cow, and duly found the body. After disputing whose property it was\r\nto become, they decided that, as they were all wearied with the journey\r\nand their exertions, they should, every one, lie down and rest, the body\r\nto become the possession of those who should first arise. The Winchcombe\r\nmen were first awake, and were well away over the hills with their prize\r\nbefore the monks of Worcester ceased from their snoring, yawned, opened\r\ntheir eyes, and found the treasure gone.\r\n\r\nThe miraculous power of St. Kenelm manifested itself on the way, for the\r\nmen of Winchcombe, fainting on their journey for lack of water, prayed,\r\nfor the love of him, to be guided to some spring; when immediately a gush\r\nof water burst forth from the hillside. Thus refreshed, they came into\r\nWinchcombe, where the wicked Cwoenthryth, whom later generations have\r\nagreed to name, in more simple fashion, Quenride, was reading that very\r\ncomminatory Psalm, the 109th, wherein all manner of disasters are invoked\r\nupon the Psalmist’s enemies. There has ever been considered some especial\r\nvirtue in reciting prayers and invocations backwards, and Quenride, having\r\ngone through the Psalm in the ordinary way, was proceeding to take it in\r\nreverse when the procession came winding along the street. At that moment\r\nher eyes fell out; and, to bear witness to the truth of the story, the\r\nAbbey of Winchcombe long exhibited, among the greatest of its treasures,\r\nthe blood-stained psalter on whose pages they fell--which, of course, was\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\nCan we wonder that, in those credulous ages, pilgrimage to Winchcombe\r\nshould have been a popular West Country practice? And if not to St.\r\nKenelm’s shrine, there was the peculiarly holy relic of the neighbouring\r\nAbbey of Hayles, where the monks treasured nothing less tremendous than a\r\nbottle of Christ’s blood. This in after years--as was to be supposed--was\r\ndiscovered to be a blasphemous imposture, the precious phial being\r\ndeclared by the examining Commissioners in the time of Henry the Eighth to\r\ncontain merely “an unctuous gum, coloured.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARD OF THE “GEORGE,” WINCHCOMBE.]\r\n\r\nA pilgrims’ inn at Winchcombe was, in view of the crowds naturally\r\nresorting to either or both of these Abbeys, a very necessary\r\ninstitution, and for long the “George” so remained.\r\n\r\nThe ways of the brewers with the old house have been already in part\r\nrecorded and the destruction of much of interest deplored, but there still\r\nremains a little of its former state. There is, for instance, the great\r\narchway at the side, with the oaken spandrels carved with foliage and the\r\ninitials R. K.; standing for Richard Kyderminster, Abbot of Winchcombe at\r\nsome period in the fifteenth century. Through this archway runs the yard,\r\ndown to the back of the town, and there is what is still called the\r\n“Pilgrims’ Gallery,” on one side. One scarcely knows which of the two\r\ncourses adopted by the brewers with this old inn was the most disastrous:\r\nthe actual demolition of the old frontage, or the “restoration” of the\r\nPilgrims’ Gallery in so thorough a manner that it is, in almost every\r\nrespect, a new structure. Nor does it, as of old, conduct to bedrooms, for\r\nthat part of the house giving upon it has been reconstructed as a large\r\nroom, available for entertainments or public dinners.\r\n\r\nThere is something peculiarly appropriate in the refectory of a monastic\r\nhouse becoming an inn. Such is the history of the “Lord Crewe Arms,” at\r\nBlanchland.\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry to that picturesque and quiet village, in stern and rugged\r\nNorthumberland; but you may be sure that, however wild and forbidding the\r\nsurrounding country, the site and the immediate neighbourhood of an\r\nancient abbey will prove to be fertile, sheltered, and beautiful; and\r\nBlanchland, the old home of an Abbey of Præmonstratensian canons, is no\r\nexception to this rule.\r\n\r\nWhichever way the traveller comes into Blanchland, he comes by hills more\r\nor less precipitous, and by moors chiefly remarkable for their savage and\r\nworthless nature, and it is a welcome change when, from the summit of a\r\nsteep hill, he at last looks down upon the quiet place, nestling in a\r\nhollow on the Northumbrian side of the little river Derwent, that here\r\nseparates the counties of Northumberland and Durham.\r\n\r\nDown there, still remote from the busy world, the village is slowly but\r\nsurely fading out of existence, as we learn from the cold, dispassionate\r\nfigures of the Census returns, which record the fact that in 1811 the\r\ninhabitants numbered 518, while in 1901 they were but 232.\r\n\r\nIt is a compact little place. There is the ancient bridge, built by the\r\nmonks, across the Derwent, still, in the words of Froissart, “strong and\r\nrapid and full of large stones and rocks”; and there are the church-tower,\r\nthe old Abbey gatehouse, the “Lord Crewe Arms,” and some few houses,\r\nforming four sides of a square. “The place,” as Walter Besant truly says\r\nin his novel, _Dorothy Forster_, “has the aspect of an ancient and decayed\r\ncollege.”\r\n\r\nBlanchland owes everything to its old abbey, conducted under the rules of\r\nthe original brethren of Prémonté, and even derived its name of Blanche\r\nLande from the white habits of the monks; just as Whitland in\r\nCarmarthenshire, took its name from a similar history.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of Blanchland was founded here, at “Wulwardshope,” as the place\r\nwas originally named, in 1163, and, rebuilt and added to from time to\r\ntime, flourished until the heavy hand of Henry the Eighth and his\r\ncommissioners ended it, in 1536. In all those long centuries it had\r\nremained obscure, both in its situation and its history; and was indeed so\r\ndifficult to come to that tradition tells a picturesque story of mediæval\r\nScottish raiders failing to find the place and so returning home, when its\r\nsituation was revealed to them by the bells the monks were ringing, to\r\nexpress joy at their deliverance. Alas! it was their own funeral knell the\r\nbrethren rang; for, guided by the sound, those Border ruffians entered\r\nBlanchland, burnt its Abbey and slew the monks.\r\n\r\nShortly after the suppression of the Abbey under Henry the Eighth, the\r\nmonastic lands became the property, and the domestic buildings of the\r\nAbbey the home, of the Radcliffe family, and afterwards of the Forsters,\r\nwho, according to the wholly irreverent, and half-boastful, half-satirical\r\nlocal saying, were older than the oldest of county families, for “the\r\nAlmighty first created the world and Adam and Eve, and then He made the\r\nForsters.”\r\n\r\nBlanchland was at last lost to that long-descended race by the treason of\r\nGeneral Forster, who was concerned in the rising of 1715, and so\r\nforfeited his estates; and in 1721 the property was purchased by Nathaniel\r\nCrewe, Bishop of Durham, who at the age of sixty-seven had married Dorothy\r\nForster, at that time twenty-four years of age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “LORD CREWE ARMS,” BLANCHLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe present inn, the “Lord Crewe Arms,” is a portion of the old refectory\r\nbuildings on the west side of the cloister garth, but many alterations and\r\nadditions have been made since those times, and the actual oldest part is\r\nthe ancient monastic fireplace, very much disguised by later generations,\r\nand in the fact that it is now in use as the fireplace of the modern\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nIn the fine drawing-room of the inn, formerly the ball-room of the Forster\r\nmansion, hangs a portrait of Lord Crewe, that time-serving reactionary\r\nsycophant under James the Second and would-be toady to William the Third.\r\nHis public life was a version, on a higher plane, of that of the\r\ncelebrated Vicar of Bray, and he succeeded admirably in his determination\r\nto stick to his principles--to live and die Bishop-Palatine of Durham; for\r\nas Lord Bishop he remained until his death, aged eighty-nine, in 1722, in\r\nthe reign of George the Second.\r\n\r\nBut he well deserves the honour of the inn being named after him, for he\r\nleft his wealth in various charities, the rent of the inn itself forming a\r\nportion of the income of the Crewe trustees.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate example of a monastic hostel is found at Aylesbury, a town\r\nwhose name would, to imaginative persons, appear at the first blush to\r\nindicate a happy hunting-ground for old inns; but although--Shakespeare to\r\nthe contrary--there is usually very much in a name, the meaning is not\r\nalways--and in place-names not often--what it would seem to be. Thus,\r\nAylesbury is not the town of ale, but (a very different thing),\r\nAeglesberge, _i.e._ “the Church Town,” a name it obtained in Saxon times,\r\nwhen the surrounding country was godless, and this place exceptionally\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Aylesbury--the place also of ducks and of dairies--_was_\r\nonce notable for an exceedingly fine inn: none other than the great\r\ngalleried “White Hart,” first modernised in 1814, when its gabled,\r\npicturesque front was pulled down and replaced by a commonplace red-brick\r\nfront, in the style, or lack of style, then prevalent; and finally cleared\r\naway in 1863, to make room for the existing Corn Exchange and Market\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “OLD KING’S HEAD,” AYLESBURY.]\r\n\r\nComing into Aylesbury, in quest of inns, one looks at that building with\r\ndismay. Was it really to build such a horrific thing they demolished the\r\n“White Hart”? How deplorable!\r\n\r\nAylesbury is a town where, late at night, the police foregather in the\r\nreverberative Market Square, instead of going their individual beats; and\r\nthere, through the small hours, they talk and laugh, hawk and spit, and\r\nmake offensive noises, until the sleepless stranger longs to open his\r\nwindow and throw things at them. Happy he whose bedroom does not look upon\r\ntheir rendezvous! But this is merely incidental. More germane to the\r\nmatter under consideration is the fact that, although the “White Hart” be\r\ngone, Aylesbury still keeps a remarkably fine inn, of the smaller sort, in\r\nthe “Old King’s Head,” which, if not indeed a pilgrims’ inn, seems to have\r\nbeen originally built by some religious fraternity as a hospice or\r\nguest-house for travellers. Of its history and of the original building\r\nnothing is known, the present house dating from 1444-50. You discover the\r\n“Old King’s Head” in a narrow street off the market-place, and at the\r\nfirst glimpse of it perceive that here is something quite exceptionally\r\nfine. A sketch is, if it be any good at all, always worth a page of\r\ndescription, and so we will let the accompanying illustration take the\r\nplace of mere verbiage. Only let it be observed that the larger gable and\r\nthe window in it are new, having been rebuilt in 1880.\r\n\r\nThe great window, entirely constructed of oak, is the chief feature of the\r\nexterior, just as the noble room it lights is the principal object of\r\ninterest in the house itself. The point most worthy of consideration here\r\nis that in this remarkably fine window, and in the room itself, you have\r\nan unaltered and unrestored work of the fifteenth century. In early ages\r\nthe house was an inn with some ecclesiastical tie, and when it passed from\r\nthe hands of the brotherhood (whoever they may have been) that once owned\r\nit, and became a secularised hostelry, it seems to have continued its\r\ncareer with very little alteration beyond that of adopting as a sign the\r\n“King’s Head”: that king doubtless originally Henry the Eighth himself.\r\nThe house was, in the seventeenth century, one of the Aylesbury inns that\r\nissued tokens, for in museums and private collections are still to be\r\nfound copper pieces inscribed “At ye King’s Head In Aillsburey, W.E.D.\r\n1657.” There still existed, until comparatively recent times, traces of\r\nold galleries in the extensive yard, but modern changes have at last\r\ncompletely abolished them.\r\n\r\nThe fine room of which the great window forms one complete side was no\r\ndoubt originally the common-room of the hostel. It is now the tap-room. A\r\nfine lofty hall it makes: oaken pillars, black with age, springing from\r\neach corner, based upon stone plinths and supporting finely moulded beams\r\nthat, crossing in the ceiling, divide it into nine square compartments.\r\nThe great window, divided by mullions and a transom into twenty lights, is\r\nof course seen to best advantage from within, and still keeps much of the\r\noriginal armorial stained glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHISTORIC INNS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can be no matter for surprise that many inns have historic\r\nassociations. Indeed, when we consider that in olden times the hostelries\r\nof town and country touched life at every point, and were once the centre\r\nof local life, it becomes rather surprising that not more tragic events,\r\nmore treaties and conferences, and more plots and conspiracies are\r\nassociated with such places of public resort.\r\n\r\nStrange, mysterious plotters, highwaymen, and great nobles resorted to\r\nthem, and, coming to things more domestic, there, under the inn’s\r\nhospitable roof, town councils not infrequently met in those times before\r\never “municipal buildings” were dreamed of, and conducted their business\r\nover a cheering, and inebriating, cup. Your inn was, in short, then at\r\nonce your railway-station, club, hotel, reading-room and mart. There were\r\ndistinct advantages, in the social sense, in all this. It meant\r\ngood-fellowship when respectable townsfolk were not ashamed to spend a\r\nwinter evening in the parlour of a representative inn, or play a game of\r\nbowls in summer on the bowling-green with which most such houses were once\r\nfurnished, and the man who now glowers in unneighbourly and solitary way\r\nover his hearthstone, would expand, with such opportunities, into as\r\ngood-natured a fellow as any of the olden time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “REINDEER,” BANBURY.]\r\n\r\nThe inns of Banbury make some historic figure. It was in one of them--the\r\nchronicler says not which--that the dispute took place between the two\r\nYorkist commanders, which led to the battle of Danesmoor being lost by\r\ntheir side, in July, 1469.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was the revolt of the great Earl of Warwick against Edward\r\nthe Fourth. To intercept Warwick at Northampton the Earl of Pembroke was\r\nmarching with a force from Gloucestershire, and was joined on the\r\nCotswolds by Lord Stafford of Southwick, newly raised a step in the\r\npeerage by being created Earl of Devon. Lord Stafford’s troops numbered\r\nsix thousand good archers: a very welcome reinforcement; but, even so, the\r\ncombined forces dared not at once risk an engagement with the rebels at\r\nDaventry, and fell back upon Banbury. There a quarrel took place between\r\nLord Stafford and the Earl of Pembroke, all on account of a pretty girl.\r\nSays Hall: “The earle of Pembroke putt the Lorde Stafforde out of an Inne,\r\nwherein he delighted muche to be, for the loue of a damosell that dwelled\r\nin the house: contrary to their mutuall agrement by them taken, which was,\r\nthat whosoeaver abteined first a lodgyng should not be deceaved nor\r\nremoued. After a greate many woordes and crakes, had betwene these twoo\r\ncapitaines, the lord Stafford of Southwyke, in greate dispite departed\r\nwith his whole compaignie and band of Archers, leauynge the erle of\r\nPembroke almost desolate in the toune.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, so weakened, the next day the Earl of Pembroke was defeated.\r\nHe took refuge in Banbury church, but, according to Hall, was dragged\r\nforth by the fierce John Clapham, who beheaded him in the porch with his\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nPossibly it was at the “Red Lion,” in the High Street, that the damosell\r\nlived who caused all the strife between those great lords. If so, it\r\nrenders that fine old house the more interesting. Modern needs, and a not\r\nunreasonable desire to keep incoming guests and their belongings dry, have\r\ncaused the picturesque courtyard to be roofed in with glass, thus hiding\r\nmany of its pictorial qualities; but you still enter from the street by a\r\nfifteenth-century oaken portal, much blunted by wear and tear and many\r\nsuccessive coats of paint and varnish in all those succeeding centuries;\r\nyet indubitably still fifteenth-century work.\r\n\r\nBut the most picturesque inn at Banbury is the “Reindeer.” History is\r\nsilent as to the why or the how of its acquiring that name, and is indeed\r\ndumb in almost every other respect concerning the old house. The\r\n“Reindeer,” both in itself and in its situation, is scarcely like the “Red\r\nLion,” an hotel. You look in at the “Reindeer” for a drink and for\r\ncuriosity only; for the house does not precisely invite guests, and\r\nprobably does most business on market days, when country folk from\r\nneighbouring villages throng the strait and crooked streets of Banbury and\r\nput up their traps in its yard and insist on liberally drinking the health\r\nof one another. Parson’s Street, indeed, the situation of the “Reindeer,”\r\nis a market-street and crowded shopping centre, where brazen-tongued\r\nsalesmen exhort housewives to “buy, buy, buy”; or indulge in rhapsodical,\r\nexclamatory passages in praise of their goods. You are gazing, let us say,\r\noutside the “original” Banbury-cake shop, opposite, upon the magpie black\r\nand white of the “Reindeer” frontage, when a parrot-like voice is heard\r\nexclaiming, in ecstatic rapture, “O what loverly heggs!” and, turning, you\r\nperceive, not a grey parrot in a gilded cage, but a white-aproned\r\nprovision-dealer’s assistant, unfortunately at large. Fleeing into the\r\ncourtyard of the inn, you still hear faint cries of “_There’s_ ’am!” “O\r\nmother! what butter!”\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood, it will be perceived, does not in these days lend\r\nitself to quiet residence, and although, by the evidence of its\r\narchitecture, the “Reindeer” was doubtless at one time one of the chief\r\nhotels of the town, it has long ceased to hold anything like that\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe old oaken gates and the black-and-white timbering above appear to be\r\nthe oldest portions of the house: the gates themselves inscribed with the\r\ndate “1570” on one side, and on the other\r\n\r\n  “IHON · KNIGHT ◈ IHONE · KNIGHT ◈ DAVID HORN.”\r\n\r\nThe great feature of the inn is, however, the noble oak-panelled chamber\r\nknown, for whatever inscrutable reason, as the “Globe Room.” Exterior and\r\ninterior views of it are the merest commonplaces in Banbury. There are, in\r\nfact, three things absolutely necessary, nay, almost sacramental, for the\r\nstranger to do in Banbury, without having performed the which he is a\r\nscorn and a derision. The first of these indispensable performances is the\r\neating, or, at any rate, the buying of Banbury cakes. And here let me add\r\nthat the Banbury cakes of Banbury have a lightness and a toothsomeness\r\nentirely lacking in the specious impostors made elsewhere. Just as\r\nthere are no other such pork-pies as those of Melton Mowbray, and as\r\nShrewsbury cakes can apparently only be made at Shrewsbury, so the\r\n“Banburys” made in other towns are apt to lie as heavy on your chest as a\r\npeccadillo upon a tender conscience. But in their native town they\r\ndisappear, to the accompaniment of cups of tea, with a rapidity alarming\r\nto the pocket, if not to the stomach; for they cost “tuppence” apiece, and\r\na hungry pedestrian or cyclist finds no difficulty in demolishing half a\r\ndozen of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARD OF THE “REINDEER,” BANBURY.]\r\n\r\nThe second of these necessary observances is the viewing of Banbury Cross:\r\nnot the old original famous Banbury Cross of the nursery rhyme, to which\r\nmany generations of children have been invited to “ride a cock-horse” to\r\nsee the tintinnabulatory lady with bells on her fingers and bells on her\r\ntoes; _that_ cross was destroyed by the Puritans, and the modern one is\r\nnot even a copy of it, for no man knoweth what the original was like.\r\n\r\nThe third of these necessary rites is the viewing of the “Globe Room” at\r\nthe “Reindeer.” What the exterior of that room is like, let the\r\nillustration of the courtyard show. The date of its building is still\r\nfaintly traceable in the figures “1637” on the masonry of the gable. They\r\ncharge you threepence to view the interior, and if so be you cannot frame\r\nto admire the richly decorated plaster ceiling for yourself, the printed\r\nnotice that a cast has been taken from it, and is to be seen in South\r\nKensington Museum, is calculated to impress the intellectually snobbish.\r\nFor our own part, seeing things with our own eyes and judging of them\r\ncomparatively, there seems no very adequate reason for South Kensington\r\nacquiring such a cast, unless, indeed, (which is unthinkable) the\r\nDepartment of Science and Art is bent upon copies of all the old ceilings\r\nin the country. This is, in short, to say that although the plaster\r\ndecoration of the “Globe Room” is fine, it is neither so intrinsically\r\nfine, nor so original above all others, that it deserves so great an\r\nhonour. The really supremely fine feature of the room is the beautiful\r\nJacobean panelling in oak, now almost coal-black with age, covering the\r\nwalls from floor to ceiling, and designed and wrought in unusually\r\nthorough and bold style. There is not a finer room of its period in the\r\ncountry, and it may even be questioned (leaving the mere matter of size\r\nalone) if there is even another quite so fine or in every detail so\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this magnificently panelled apartment being added to the\r\nolder and very much less ornate portion of the inn is obscure; and it will\r\nbe noted, as a matter of curiosity, that, entered as it is only by a\r\ndoorway from the open courtyard, the room is not, structurally a part of\r\nthe house. The name of the “Globe Room” given to it is not explained in\r\nany way by the decorations or by its history, which is as obscure as its\r\norigin. Tradition says Cromwell “held a council” here, and accordingly,\r\nalthough history does not tell us anything specifically about it, a\r\npicture, reproduced in a variety of ways, showing a number of stern and\r\nmalignant Roundheads interrogating an elegant and angelic-looking Royalist\r\nclad in white, and bearing a very strong likeness to Charles the First\r\nhimself, is one of the commonplaces of the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GLOBE ROOM, “REINDEER” INN, BANBURY.]\r\n\r\nFor one of the most entertaining examples of history enacted at an inn, we\r\nmust shift the scene to Chester.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient inns of that city, long since retired from the\r\ninnkeeping business is the “Blue Posts,” a house in its day historic by\r\nreason of one dramatic incident: an incident so dramatic that it would\r\nalmost seem to have been borrowed from the stage. It was the year 1558,\r\nthe last of the reign of Queen Mary, of bloody memory, and Dr. Henry Cole,\r\nDean of St. Paul’s, was come to Chester on his way to Ireland, where he\r\nhad work to do, in the persecution of the Irish Protestants. He lodged for\r\nthe night at the “Blue Posts,” in Bridge Street, and in the evening the\r\nMayor of Chester called upon him there.\r\n\r\nThe Dean made no secret of his mission. To him it was a labour of love to\r\nbring imprisonment and torture, fire and stake, to correct the religious\r\nerrors of those Protestants over sea. Had he not already distinguished\r\nhimself by a revolting and bloodthirsty sermon, on the occasion of\r\nCranmer’s sentence of martyrdom?\r\n\r\nIn conversation with the Mayor, he drew from his travelling valise the\r\nRoyal commission for his errand. “Here,” he exclaimed, with exultation,\r\n“here is that will lash the heretics of Ireland!”\r\n\r\nNow, whether the landlady was in the room at the time, or listening at the\r\nkeyhole--in a manner traditional among landladies--does not appear; but\r\nshe overheard the conversation, and, having a brother, a Protestant, in\r\nDublin, was alarmed for his safety in particular, and, let us hope, for\r\nthat of Protestants in general. So, that night, when the Dean was\r\ndoubtless dreaming of the shackles and gyves, the faggots and the rackings\r\nhe was bringing to the heretics of Ireland, Mrs. Mottershead, the landlady\r\nwith the sharp ears, abstracted the fateful commission, and in its stead\r\nplaced a pack of cards, with the knave of clubs showing satirically at the\r\ntop. O! daring and witty Mrs. Mottershead!\r\n\r\nWe may, if gifted with anything like a due sense of humour, well chuckle\r\nat the outraged feelings of the Lord President of the Council of Ireland\r\nwhen the Dean, all unconscious, presented him with this unconventional\r\nauthority. My Lord, however, summoned some humour of his own, wherewith to\r\nmeet the situation. “Let us,” said he, “have another commission, and we\r\nwill meanwhile shuffle the cards.”\r\n\r\nCrestfallen, the emissary returned, and did actually obtain a new\r\ncommission, but when again arrived at Chester, and awaiting a fair wind\r\nfor Ireland, he heard of the Catholic Queen’s death and the accession of\r\nher Protestant sister; and so found his way back to London once more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “MUSIC HOUSE,” NORWICH.]\r\n\r\nThe episode would fitly end in the Dean being flung, loaded with chains,\r\ninto some loathsome dungeon; but although he was, in fact, committed to\r\nthe Tower in 1560, after having been deprived of all his preferments, such\r\ndramatic completeness was lacking. But, at any rate, he was transferred to\r\nthe Fleet Prison, and, after a long captivity, seems to have died there in\r\n1580.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, virtue was rewarded, in the person of Mrs. Mottershead, who was\r\ngranted a pension of £40 a year, representing perhaps £500 a year in our\r\nown day.\r\n\r\nThe former “Blue Posts,” where this historic interlude was played, was\r\nlong since refronted in respectable, but dull, red brick, and is now, or\r\nwas recently, a boot-shop. But although no hint of its former self is\r\ngiven to the passer-by, those who venture to make a request, are shown a\r\nfine upstairs room, with elaborately pargeted ceiling, still known as the\r\n“Card Room.”\r\n\r\nThe “Music House” inn, King Street, Norwich, situated in what is now a\r\npoor and densely populated part of that city, has a vaulted cellar of\r\nNorman masonry, a vestige of the time when the Norwich Jews were very rich\r\nand numerous. The house of which it formed part was then the residence of\r\none Moyses, and afterwards of Isaac, his nephew, who in the reign of King\r\nJohn seems to have come, like many of his race, to some mysterious and\r\nuncomfortable end, probably in the dungeons of Norwich Castle. In the\r\ncourse of time the famous Paston family came into possession of the house,\r\nand in 1633 the great lawyer, Sir Edward Coke, resided here. Shortly\r\nafterwards it became the meeting-place of the “city music,” ancestors of\r\nmodern town bands, who seem to have practised the waits and other\r\nperformances within, until they had their parts sufficiently perfect to\r\ndare inflict them on the city. Hence the sign of the “Music House.”\r\n\r\nIn the same neighbourhood we have the “Dolphin” inn at Potter Heigham, a\r\nplace sadly changed in modern times.\r\n\r\nPotter Heigham is no longer rural, and the long, long and narrow street\r\nleading to it, out of Norwich, is crowded with the waggons and\r\nrailway-lorries of the old city’s expanding commerce. In midst of all this\r\nrumbling of wheels over uneven pavements stands the “Dolphin” inn, the\r\nhome in his declining days of Bishop Hall, who rented it for some ten\r\nyears, until his death there, in 1656, in his eighty-second year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “DOLPHIN,” POTTER HEIGHAM.]\r\n\r\nIt was a comparatively new house then, for while you see the date, 1587,\r\nover the entrance door and a merchant’s mark and the initials R B on\r\neither side, a prominent gable shows the date 1629 done, very large, in\r\nvitrified brick.\r\n\r\nStill you come grandly into the house, though it be a humble tavern now,\r\nbetween an old pillared entrance, and across a courtyard, and in the house\r\nare Jacobean fireplaces, with a fine newel staircase carved in the manner\r\nof an old church bench-end, with an heraldic lion and the Gothic foliage\r\nknown as a “poppy head.” The “Dolphin” would be capable, if it were\r\ndifferently situated, of being converted into a handsome old-world hotel,\r\nbut the poor and crowded neighbourhood of Potter Heigham forbids anything\r\nof that kind, and so it remains humble and unassuming.\r\n\r\nA tragical little story belongs to the humble old “Nag’s Head” inn at\r\nThame, formerly the “King’s Head.” The old sign of it was used as a\r\ngallows for a Parliamentary rebel who had deserted his side and joined the\r\nKing, and was so unlucky as to be captured. Those Puritans had a grim\r\nhumour. One of the condemned man’s executioners, before turning him off,\r\nturned his face, bound with a handkerchief, to the sign, with the words:\r\n“Nay, sir, you must speak one word with the King before you go. You are\r\nblindfold, and he cannot see, and by and by you shall both come down\r\ntogether.” And then he was hoisted up.\r\n\r\nThere is another historic house at Thame, for it was into the yard of the\r\n“Greyhound” in that town that John Hampden came, lying mortally wounded\r\nupon the neck of his horse, from the skirmish of Chalgrove Field, on June\r\n18th, 1643. He had unwillingly taken arms against oppression and\r\niniquitous taxation, and was thus at the outset killed. No enemy’s bullet\r\nlaid him low: it was his own pistol, overloaded by a careless servant,\r\nthat, exploding, shattered his hand. He died, on the 24th, of lockjaw.\r\n\r\nThe front of the house has been rebuilt, and the yard somewhat altered,\r\nsince the patriot rode in at that tragical time; but the house is in\r\nessentials the inn of his day. Long since ceased to be an inn, it is now\r\noccupied as a furnishing ironmonger’s shop and warehouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “NAG’S HEAD,” THAME.]\r\n\r\nThe “Crown and Treaty House” inn at Uxbridge, long known to would-be beery\r\nrustics by the affectionately wistful name of the “Crown and Treat Ye,” is\r\na genuinely historic house. It stands away beyond the tramway terminus,\r\nfacing the road at the very extremity of Uxbridge town, as you cross\r\ncanal and river and so leave Middlesex for Buckinghamshire; and although\r\nvery much of its real antiquity is disguised by modern paint and plaster,\r\nit is in fact the surviving portion of the great mansion built in 1575 by\r\none of the Bennet family, and, at the opening of the war between King and\r\nParliament, in the occupation of one “Mr. Carr.”\r\n\r\nThe meeting here of leading spirits on either side of the contending\r\nforces was well meant. It began January 20th, 1645, and was convened for\r\nthe purpose of “taking into consideration the grievances of which each\r\nparty complained, and to propose those remedies which might be mutually\r\nagreeable.” Unfortunately, little sincerity attended the actual meeting.\r\nThe King’s party were unyielding, and the military successes of the\r\nParliament rendered the leaders of that side ill-disposed to give away in\r\ntalk that which they had won in the field. Moreover, like most conferences\r\nin which religious as well as political questions were the subjects of\r\ndiscussion, those debates only further inflamed mutual hatreds and further\r\nsundered the already wide points of disagreement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARD OF THE “GREYHOUND,” THAME.]\r\n\r\nThere were sixteen commissioners on either side, and for three weeks they\r\nargued without coming to any settlement. Neither side would give way, for\r\neither was convinced of its ability to finally crush the other by force of\r\narms. Much blood had already been shed, indecisively, and passions ran\r\nhigh. Uxbridge was selected as a kind of half-way house between London,\r\nheld strongly by the Parliament, and Oxford, as strongly held for the\r\nKing; and when the empty verbiage was done, the propositions put forth\r\nscouted, and the pretensions disallowed, the parties separated, falling\r\nback respectively to London and to Oxford, to recommence those hostilities\r\nfor which they were spoiling. Treaty, therefore, there was not: only an\r\nominous truce between Right Divine and People’s Will.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Clarendon, in his _History of the Rebellion_, gives an\r\ninteresting account of these fruitless meetings:\r\n\r\n“There was,” he says, “a good house at the end of the town which was\r\nprovided for the Treaty. Above was a fair room in the middle of the house,\r\nhandsomely dressed up for the Commissioners to sit in; a large square\r\ntable being placed in the middle with seats for the Commissioners; one\r\nside being sufficient for those of either party: and a rail for those who\r\nshould be thought necessary to be present, which went round. There were\r\nmany other rooms on either side of this great room for the Commissioners\r\nto retire to, when they thought fit to consult by themselves, and there\r\nbeing good stairs at either end of the house they never went through each\r\nother’s quarters, nor met, but in the great room.”\r\n\r\nNeither side used the house, except for these meetings, the Royalists\r\nbeing appropriately accommodated at the “Crown,” which then stood in the\r\nmiddle of the High Street, in the centre of the town, opposite the\r\nstill-existing “White Horse,” and the Parliament people at the “George.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CROWN AND TREATY,” UXBRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nIn those times the highway out of Uxbridge, ceasing to be broad and\r\nstraight, left the High Street of Uxbridge by a sharp turning to the right\r\nand went in a narrow way called Johnson’s Row to the crossing of the\r\nColne, which was effected to the north of the present bridge and was made\r\nin two stages by wooden bridges, using the still-surviving island in the\r\nmiddle of the river as a kind of natural pier or abutment. The road\r\ntherefore crossed, in a more or less direct fashion, from immediately in\r\nfront of the “Swan and Bottle” inn to where the present flour-mill stands,\r\ncautiously using that very considerable island on the way. The modern\r\nroad, with its bridge of seven arches, on the other hand, boldly spans the\r\nriver at its widest part, and seeks no help midway. It is all very clear\r\nand palpable to you who stand on the bridge and see how the road across it\r\nswoops round, at a very noticeable angle, to join the older road at the\r\nflour-mill; but Johnson’s Row was demolished 1905-6, to make an approach\r\nto the new railway-station, and the old landmarks are growing obscured. It\r\nwas the making of this road in 1785 that changed the fortunes of the\r\nTreaty House. The new highway was cut through its gardens, and the house\r\nitself brought from private life and a dignified seclusion to face the\r\nwayfaring world. What else, then, could it do but become an inn?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “TREATY ROOM,” “CROWN AND TREATY,” UXBRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe house, although even now not small, was once much larger. Its least\r\nimposing front is turned to the street and is not improved by the modern\r\nappointments of a public-house. The great feature of the building is the\r\nroom on the first floor, called, with what appears to be insufficient\r\nwarranty, the “Treaty Room,” the real place of meeting having been,\r\napparently, the front room, now divided by a partition into two. It was\r\ndoubtless its being immeasurably the finest room in the house that led to\r\nthe so-called “Treaty Room” being selected for that honour. It is, in\r\nfact, a noble apartment, greatly neglected for these many years past, but\r\ngrand in spite of indifference and decay. There are smeary\r\npicture-postcards of it to be purchased in Uxbridge, and it has been\r\nphotographed by enthusiastic visitors times without number, generally\r\nwithout success; for it is a dark interior, and the wood-carving is\r\nshallow and does not yield sufficient pictorial light and shade for the\r\ncameras to do it justice. It should be added, by way of comparative\r\ncriticism, that, although this panelling is itself so fine, it does not\r\nfor a moment compare with the bold and effective work of the “Globe Room”\r\nat the “Reindeer,” Banbury. There you have a massiveness of construction\r\nand a breadth of design almost architectural: here there are no bold\r\nprojections, and the recurrent flat pilasters are covered with an\r\nintricate Renaissance scroll and strap-work, which, although in itself\r\ngood, is too small in scale to be highly effective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “RED LION,” HILLINGDON.]\r\n\r\nThe “Red Lion” at Hillingdon, near Uxbridge, has its small share in the\r\ntroubled story of the Stuarts, although, to be sure, its plastered front\r\nis a thought too modern-looking. Here Charles the First, escaping from\r\nthe besieged city of Oxford, lay the first night of his distracted\r\nwanderings through England that led him eventually to the end of his armed\r\nresistance, at Southwell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “THREE CROWNS,” CHAGFORD.]\r\n\r\nThe “Three Crowns” at Chagford, South Devon, now a favourite old-world\r\nhaunt of tourists visiting Dartmoor, illustrates still another incident in\r\nthat internecine warfare. It was originally a manor-house built in the\r\ntime of Henry the Eighth by Sir John Whyddon, a native of Chagford, who\r\nwent to London to seek his fortune, and, as a lawyer, found it. He became\r\na Judge of the King’s Bench, was knighted, and we are gravely told that he\r\nwas the first judge to ride to Westminster on a horse: his predecessors,\r\nand his learned contemporary brethren, had gone on mules.\r\n\r\nIn the troubled times of the Civil War, when Royalist and Roundhead\r\ndisturbed even these remote nooks of the country, Chagford was attacked by\r\nthe Royalists under Sir John Berkeley. In the street-fighting, according\r\nto Clarendon, “they lost Sidney Godolphin, a young gentleman of\r\nincomparable parts. He received a mortal shot by a musket, a little above\r\nthe knee, of which he died on the instant, leaving the misfortune of his\r\ndeath upon a place which could never otherwise have had a mention in the\r\nworld.” Ay! but that was written in days long before the appreciation of\r\npicturesque scenery had brought troops of visitors to Chagford.\r\n\r\nYoung Godolphin bled to death on a stone seat of what is now, as Charles\r\nKingsley wrote, “a beautiful old mullioned and gabled Perpendicular inn.”\r\n\r\nWhat was once the “great hall” of the old mansion is now a schoolroom.\r\nBoth face the church, on the other side of the narrow street, as an old\r\nmanor-house should do, and in summer time the gossipers lounge and talk,\r\nand interpolate their gossiping with loud horse-laughs, far into the\r\nnight, greatly to the annoyance of visitors. Have I not heard, with these\r\nears, the raising of a sash at some incredible hour, and the voice of some\r\nnative of Bawston or N’York, exclaiming indignantly, “See yur, you darned\r\nskunks, clear out of it!” whereupon, with cat-calls and insults in the\r\n_patois_ of Devonshire, fortunately not with ease to be understood by\r\nstrangers from the U.S., that village convention has dispersed.\r\n\r\nMany historic memories linger around that ancient and beautiful house, the\r\n“Saracen’s Head” at Southwell, in the Sherwood Forest district of\r\nNottinghamshire. Southwell, whose hoary Minster has in modern times become\r\na cathedral, has fallen into a dreamless slumber since the last of the\r\ncoaches left the road, and as the traveller comes into its quiet streets,\r\nin whose midst the great Norman church stands solemnly, like some grey\r\narchitectural ghost, he feels that he has come into a place whose last\r\ndays of activity ended considerably over half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe “Saracen’s Head” was built in that interesting, but vague, period of\r\n“ever so long ago”; the nearest attempt at determining its age to which\r\nmost chroniclers dare commit themselves. Whether the existing house is the\r\nsame building as that of this name conveyed by the Archbishop of York in\r\n1396 to John Fysher and his wife Margaret, does not appear, but there\r\nseems very little reason to doubt that, although greatly altered and added\r\nto from time to time, the present “Saracen’s Head” is, essentially, in its\r\nancient timbering, the identical structure.\r\n\r\nThe frontage of the inn, now as ever the chief inn of Southwell, little\r\nindicates its great age, for it is covered with a coat of grey plaster,\r\nand, were it not for the enormously substantial oaken doors of the\r\ncoach-entrance, and the peep through the archway of the old courtyard,\r\nthe casual wayfarer might pass the historic house by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARD OF THE “SARACEN’S HEAD,” SOUTHWELL.]\r\n\r\nFor it is historic, in an intimate and a melancholy way. Dismissing in a\r\nword the remote visits paid by Edward the First and Edward the Third to\r\nSouthwell, when they are stated to have lodged at the “Saracen’s Head,” we\r\ncome to the harassed wanderings of Charles the First over the distracted\r\nEngland of his time. That unhappy King well knew Southwell and the\r\n“Saracen’s Head.” They were associated with the opening and the closing\r\nscenes of his fight with Parliament and people, for he rested at the inn\r\non August 17th, 1642, on the way to raise the Royal Standard at Nottingham\r\non the 22nd; and at last, on May 5th, 1646, he abandoned the nearly four\r\nyears’ struggle against fate, surrendering himself here to the Scottish\r\nCommissioners. Between those two fateful days he was certainly once at\r\nSouthwell, and possibly more often.\r\n\r\nThe story of his last visit has a pathos of its own that we need not be\r\nRoyalist to perceive. In March, 1646, the King at length saw his hopes to\r\nbe desperately failing everywhere, even in the loyal West; garrisons of\r\ntowns, castles, and fortified houses had been compelled to yield, and\r\nhimself reduced to fleeting, the embarrassed head of an impossible cause,\r\nfrom place to place; bringing upon places and persons devoted to him a\r\ncommon ruin. Friends began to despair of his shifty and untrustworthy\r\npolicy towards themselves and in negotiations with the enemy, and although\r\ntheir loyalty was hardly ever in doubt, for they were fighting, after all,\r\nnot merely for the King personally, but for an order of things in which\r\ntheir interests were involved, they had by this time exhausted energies\r\nand wealth in a vain effort, and perhaps thought peace at almost any price\r\nto be by this time preferable to the uncertainties of civil war, in which\r\nthe only certainty seemed to be that, whoever eventually won, they must\r\nneeds in the meanwhile be continually making further sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe King was at Oxford when he at length came to a decision by some means\r\nto end the struggle; by flight over sea, or by surrendering himself to the\r\nenemy: in the hope, in that alternative, that the sanctity of Kingship\r\nwould enable him by some means to snatch an advantage out of the very jaws\r\nof defeat and ruin. The first thought was to take flight from the country,\r\nby the port of King’s Lynn, but that was at length abandoned for the\r\nidea--a fatal _tertium quid_, as it proved--of surrendering, not to the\r\nEnglish army and the Parliament, but to the Scots, who, he thought, were\r\nlikely to make better terms for him. The Scottish army was at that time\r\nengaged upon the siege of the Royalist castle of Newark, near Southwell;\r\nand to Southwell the King, therefore, went from Oxford, in disguise. He\r\nleft Oxford on April 26th, and, to the last incapable of being\r\nstraightforward, even toward his own, gave out to his council that he was\r\ngoing to London, to treat with Parliament. On May 3rd he was at Stamford,\r\nand came to the “Saracen’s Head” at Southwell at seven o’clock in the\r\nmorning of May 5th, accompanied by Ashburnham and his chaplain, Dr.\r\nHudson, but travelling with them as Ashburnham’s servant. At the inn he\r\nwas received by Montreuil, the French Ambassador to Scotland, who had been\r\nadvised of his coming. The King, believing himself in every sense free,\r\ninvited the Scottish Commissioners over to dinner at the inn, from the\r\nBishop’s Palace, where they had their quarters; and in what is now the\r\nCoffee Room, the negotiations took place that ended in the King’s yielding\r\nto the Scots. It would, in any case, have so ended, for the Commissioners\r\ncame by invitation, as guests to dinner, but were so astonished at\r\nfinding the King so tamely coming within their grasp that they had not the\r\nremotest idea of letting him go again, and would, if needs were, have\r\nforcibly detained him. He was removed the same day to the neighbouring\r\nKelham Hall, where he formed the richest prize and the bitterest source of\r\ncontention between the English and the Scots, and all but caused a further\r\nwarfare. Eventually, the Scottish Commissioners, true to the national love\r\nof money, sold their principles and their prisoner for £400,000 and\r\nwithdrew themselves and their forces across the border. The story ends\r\ntragically, in Westminster, with the execution of the King on January\r\n30th, 1649.\r\n\r\nThe Coffee Room of the “Saracen’s Head” is a beautiful apartment, formed\r\nout of two rooms, and rich in panelling and deeply recessed windows. The\r\nbedroom upstairs, where the King is said to have slept, is, in the same\r\nmanner, formed by abolishing the partition that once made two rooms of it;\r\nand there they still show the pilgrims after things of sentimental and\r\nhistoric interest the ancient four-poster bed on which the King slept.\r\n\r\nThis history seems to have greatly upset Dr. Selwyn, Bishop of New Zealand\r\nand afterwards of Lichfield, who stayed at the “Saracen’s Head” in 1858,\r\nand slept--or rather, failed to sleep--in this historic bed. For my part,\r\nalthough a pilgrim--and a sentimental one at that--I found the\r\nfour-poster, despite its associations, as inviting to slumber as any\r\nother; but then, I had cycled eighty-one miles that day, and--not being a\r\nbishop--had nothing on my conscience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING CHARLES’ BEDROOM, “SARACEN’S HEAD,” SOUTHWELL.]\r\n\r\nDr. Selwyn was so obsessed with the memories of that room and the house\r\nthat he arose in the middle of the night, and lighted his bedroom candle\r\nand wrote a long set of couplets, sentimental, pietistic, and very jingly\r\nand inferior. I have a mental picture of him sitting up in bed, or perhaps\r\nat the dressing-table in his night-shirt, gruesomely cold on that March\r\nnight, running his fingers through his hair and gazing at the ceiling for\r\nthe inspiration which does not seem to have come; for a more uninspired\r\nset of verses it would be difficult to find. But you shall judge:\r\n\r\n  I cannot rest--for on the spot where I have made my bed,\r\n  O’erwearied with the strife of State, a King hath laid his head.\r\n\r\n  Thy sacred head, ill-fated Charles, hath lain where now I lie;\r\n  And thou hast passed, in Southwell Inn, as sleepless night as I.\r\n\r\n  I cannot rest--for o’er my mind come thronging full and fast,\r\n  The stories of the olden time, the visions of the past.\r\n\r\n  ’Twas here he rested ere he raised his standard for the fight;\r\n  Here called on Heaven to help his cause, My God, defend the right!\r\n\r\n  Here gather’d round him all the flow’r of England’s chivalry;\r\n  And here the vanquished Monarch closed his days of liberty.\r\n\r\n  I cannot rest--for Cromwell’s horse are neighing in mine ear;\r\n  E’en in the Holy House of God their ringing hoofs I hear.\r\n\r\n  Lord! wilt Thou once again endure it stable vile to be?\r\n  The proud usurper’s charger rein’d fast by Thy sanctuary.\r\n\r\n  I cannot rest--for Wolsey’s pride, and Wolsey’s deep disgrace--\r\n  The pomp, the littleness of man--speak from this ancient place.\r\n\r\n  Here gloriously his summer days he spent in kingly state;\r\n  Here his last summer sadly pined, bow’d by the stroke of Fate.\r\n\r\n  How mighty was he when he rul’d from Tweed to Humber’s flood!\r\n  How lowly when he came to die, forsaken by his God!\r\n\r\n  I cannot rest--for holier thoughts the lingering night beguile,\r\n  Of the glad days when gospel light went forth o’er Britain’s Isle.\r\n\r\n  ’Twas here the Bishop of the North, Paulinus, pitch’d his tent,\r\n  Here preached the living Word of God, baptizing in the Trent.\r\n\r\n  Hence have the preachers’ feet gone forth thro’ all the country wide;\r\n  And daughter-churches have sprung up, nursed at their mother’s side.\r\n\r\n  Here have the clerks of Nottingham, and yeomen bold and true,\r\n  Held yearly feasts at Whitsuntide, and paid their homage due.\r\n\r\n  Here many a mitred head of York, and priests and men of peace,\r\n  Have lived in penitence and prayer, and welcomed their release.\r\n\r\n  And hence the daily choral song, the gospel’s hopes and fears,\r\n  Have sounded forth to Christian hearts, beyond a thousand years.\r\n\r\n  ’Tis thus, o’er England’s hill and dale, have passed by Heaven’s decree,\r\n  A changing light, a chequer’d shade, a mingled company.\r\n\r\n  The good, the bad, have had their day, the Lord hath worked His will;\r\n  And England keeps her ancient faith, purer and brighter still.\r\n\r\n  Where are they now, the famous men who lived in olden time?\r\n  They never see the noonday sun, nor hear the midnight chime.\r\n\r\n  They sleep within their narrow cell, waiting the trumpet’s voice;\r\n  Lord! grant that I may rest in peace, and when I wake--rejoice.\r\n\r\n  _Saracen’s Head, Southwell, 5th March, 1858._\r\n\r\nByron had stayed often at the inn, many years before, and in 1807 wrote an\r\nimpromptu on the death of a local carrier, John Adams, who travelled to\r\nand from the house, and lived drunk and died drunk:\r\n\r\n  John Adams lies here, of the parish of Southwell,\r\n  A _Carrier_ who _carried_ his can to his mouth well;\r\n  He _carried_ so much and he _carried_ so fast,\r\n  He could _carry_ no more--so was _carried_ at last:\r\n  For the liquor he drank, being too much for one,\r\n  He could not _carry_ off--so is now _carri_-on.\r\n\r\nIt will already have been noticed that the Stuarts and their troubles\r\ncontributed most of the historic associations belonging to our old\r\nhostelries; and we have not yet quite done with them. The incidents of\r\nCharles the Second’s flight in 1651, after the battle of Worcester,\r\ninclude a halt of one night at the “Sun,” Cirencester, the well-known\r\nescape from the “Queen’s Arms,” an inn--that is an inn no longer--at\r\nCharmouth, and visits to the “George” at Bridport, and a house of the same\r\nname at Broadwindsor. The “King’s Arms” at Salisbury is associated with\r\nmeetings and conferences of the King’s supporters, who, while he lay in\r\nhiding at Heale House, considered there the best way of conducting him to\r\nthe coast and safety. The route chosen lay through Mere, where, at the\r\n“George” inn (rebuilt in the eighteenth century) Colonel Phelips and\r\nCharles, travelling as his servant, Will Jackson, called. The Colonel, an\r\nacquaintance of the landlord, descended into the cellar of the inn, to\r\nsample the liquors of the house, while “Will Jackson” stood respectfully\r\naside. Mine host, however, was an hospitable man, and, turning to the\r\nservant, with jug and glass, said, “Thou lookest an honest fellow--here’s\r\na health to the King!” The “honest fellow,” whether taken aback by the\r\nsuddenness of it, or acting an unwilling part, made some difficulty in\r\nreplying; whereupon the landlord mildly took the Colonel to task for the\r\nkind of man he had brought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “COCK AND PYMAT.”]\r\n\r\nFrom another “George”--the “George” at Brighthelmstone, in after years\r\nstyled the “King’s Head”--the King escaped to France.\r\n\r\nNor even yet have we quite done with the hapless Stuarts, of whom\r\nundoubtedly Charles the Second was the most fortunate.\r\n\r\nOne of the most historic of inns was the famous “Cock and Pymat” at\r\nWhittington, near Chesterfield. It is now only to be spoken of in the past\r\ntense because, although there is still an inn of that name at\r\nWhittington, it is not the famous “Revolution House” itself, but only a\r\nmodern building to which the old sign of the “Cock and Magpie”--for that\r\nis the plain English of “Pymat”--has been transferred.\r\n\r\nWhittington in these times is a very grim and unlovely village, in the\r\ndismal colliery district of Chesterfield, whose wicked-looking crooked\r\nspire gives an air of _diablerie_ to its immediate surroundings; but two\r\ncenturies and a quarter ago, when James the Second was on the throne, and\r\nbusily engaged in undermining the religious and Parliamentary liberties of\r\nthe realm, it was a tiny collection of houses on a lonely moor, and an\r\nideal place for meetings of conspirators. There and then those very mild\r\nand constitutional plotters who, despite their mildness, did actually\r\nsucceed in overturning that already insecure monarch, met and formulated\r\ntheir demands.\r\n\r\nThe house in which they gathered was then an inn so noted for its fine\r\nhome-brewed ale that packmen and others made it a regular place of call,\r\nand often, we are told, went considerable distances out of their way,\r\nrather than miss a draught of the genuine Whittington nut-brown.\r\n\r\nThe bold men who met in the room still known as the “Plotting Parlour” had\r\nnothing in common with such plotters as Guy Fawkes. Their methods were\r\nrather those of debating societies than of misguided persons with dark\r\nlanthorns and slow matches; but those were times when even the mildest\r\ndebater who ever rose to a point of order would have been in danger of\r\nhis life; and so undoubtedly the little gathering that met here in\r\n1688--William, fourth Earl of Devonshire, Sir Thomas Osborne, Earl of\r\nDanby, afterwards Duke of Leeds, and John D’Arcy--were bold men and brave.\r\n\r\nThey drew up a complaint, moderately worded, and appended to it a sturdy\r\nresolution. They declared that “invasions had been made of late Years on\r\nour Religion and Laws, without the consent of Parliament, freely and duly\r\nchosen,” and begged King James to grant again the constitutional right,\r\nhardly won by our forefathers, of a free Parliament. “But,” they added,\r\n“if, to the great Misfortune and Ruin of these Kingdoms it prove\r\notherwise, we further declare that we will to our utmost defend the\r\nProtestant religion, the Laws of the Kingdom, and the Rights and Liberties\r\nof the People.”\r\n\r\nThe Stuarts, although a romantic, were a wrong-headed and a stiff-necked\r\nrace. They must needs for ever be trying conclusions with their stubborn\r\nheads against every brick wall within reach, and would never bow before\r\nthe storms of their own raising. James, true to his blood, would no more\r\nyield than would any other of his house; and in that same year came the\r\nPrince of Orange and brushed him lightly aside.\r\n\r\nThe chair in which the Earl (afterwards Duke) of Devonshire presided at\r\nthe “Cock and Pymat” was long since transferred to Hardwick Hall, and in\r\nthe course of years the greater part of the old inn was demolished, the\r\nremaining portion being now a private house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORCH OF THE “RED LION,” HIGH WYCOMBE.]\r\n\r\nThe porch of that chief hotel of High Wycombe, the “Red Lion,” has become\r\nin these last generations historic; but while we may find, throughout the\r\ncountry, inns associated with the entirely fictitious incidents of novels\r\ndisplaying notices of their fame, there is not yet even the most modest of\r\ntablets affixed to the front of the “Red Lion,” to inform the present\r\ngeneration that from the roof of the projecting portico Benjamin Disraeli,\r\nafterwards Prime Minister of England, made his first political speech.\r\nThrice, and every time unsuccessfully--twice in 1832, and in 1834--he\r\nsought to enter Parliament as Member for this town. He made a public entry\r\non June 3rd, 1832, and spoke from beside the lion that, still very red and\r\nfierce, stands to this day on the roof of the portico. He appeared there\r\nin the dandified costume of his youth--tightly strapped trousers,\r\nfrock-coat very tight in the waist and very full and spreading in the\r\nskirts--and made a picturesque figure as, in the excitement of his\r\nharangue to the free and independent electors, he from time to time flung\r\nback the long black curls of his luxuriant hair. Mr. D’Israeli--as he then\r\nspelled his name--appeared as an independent candidate, and was proposed\r\nby a Tory and seconded by a Radical. He polled little more than half the\r\nnumber of votes cast for his opponent, and how small was the electorate in\r\nthose days of a restricted franchise we may see from this election return:\r\n\r\n  Grey        23\r\n  D’Israeli   12\r\n              --\r\n  Majority    11\r\n\r\nAmong inns of highly dubious historic associations may be mentioned the\r\n“White Hart” at Somerton, Somerset: that gaunt and cold-looking town built\r\nof the local grey-blue limestone that so utterly destroys the summery\r\nimplication of the place-name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “WHITE HART,” SOMERTON.]\r\n\r\nThe inn claims to have been partly built of the stones of Somerton Castle,\r\nand a tiny opening, about the size of a pocket-handkerchief, in the gable\r\nof the small and not otherwise particularly interesting house, is pointed\r\nout as the window of “King John’s Prison.” The “King John” in question was\r\nnot our own shabby and lying Lackland, but an infinitely finer fellow--if\r\none may so greatly dare as to name a king a “fellow”--King John of France,\r\ntaken prisoner at the battle of Poictiers and held to ransom in England.\r\nBut there appears to be a considerable deal of confusion in the statement\r\nthat the French King was ever in custody in Somersetshire, for it was from\r\nthe Castle of Hertford to Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire that he was\r\nremoved, for greater security, in 1359. But those grave authorities, the\r\ncounty histories of Somerset and Lincolnshire, alike claim to have had the\r\ncustody of that illustrious prisoner, in the 33rd year of Edward the\r\nThird, at their respective Somertons, and the antiquaries of either\r\nnarrate how one Sir Saier de Rochford was granted two shillings a day for\r\nthe keeping of him.\r\n\r\nApart from this unfounded claim, the “White Hart” is pictorially\r\nremarkable for its White Hart effigy, of an enormous size in proportion to\r\nthat of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nINNS OF OLD ROMANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance, as we have already seen, was enacted in many ways in the inns of\r\nlong ago. Love and hatred, comedy and tragedy, and all the varied moods by\r\nwhich human beings are swayed, have had their part beneath the roofs of\r\nthe older hostelries; as how could they fail to do in those times when the\r\ninn was so essential and intimate a part of the national life? The\r\nromantic incidents in which old inns have their part are in two great\r\ndivisions: that of old folklore, and the other of real life. To the realm\r\nof folk-tales belongs the story told of an ancient hostelry that stood on\r\nthe site of the “Ostrich,” Colnbrook.\r\n\r\nThe decayed coaching town of Colnbrook, in Middlesex, seventeen miles from\r\nHyde Park Corner, on the great road to Bath, is little changed from the\r\ntime when the coaches ceased running through it, seventy years ago. Still\r\ndo the old red-brick houses on either side of the narrow, causeway-like\r\nstreet wear their seventeenth, their eighteenth, or their early\r\nnineteenth-century look unchanged, and the solid, stolid red-faced\r\n“George” inn yet seems to be awaiting the arrival of the mail, or of some\r\nsmart post-chaise nearing London or setting out on the second stage of\r\nthe 105¾ miles to Bath.\r\n\r\nColnbrook is perhaps the best illustration of a coaching town ruined by\r\nrailways that it is possible to discover, and certainly the nearest to\r\nLondon. How great its fall since those prosperous days of 1549, when it\r\nwas incorporated as a market-town! Its charter was renewed in 1632, and,\r\njudging from the many houses in its narrow street built about 1700-1750,\r\nthe prosperity of the place survived unimpaired for certainly considerably\r\nover another century. It is now merely a village, but, as a result of its\r\nformer highway importance, still a place of inns. There are at least ten\r\neven now surviving; and it is quite safe to assume that any\r\nimportant-looking old house, now in private occupation, facing the long\r\nthoroughfare, was once a hostelry.\r\n\r\nThe “George,” already mentioned, although re-fronted at some period of the\r\neighteenth century, is older within, and an old gable overlooking the\r\nstable yard even has a sixteenth-century barge-board surviving. Of rather\r\nmore human interest is the decorative and spiky iron-work fixed on the\r\nground-floor window-sills of the frontage, which clearly shows that the\r\narchitect of the building, when he drew out his design, had forgotten the\r\nloungers of Colnbrook, and, in placing his sills at the height above the\r\nground of the average chair, had unwittingly provided the lazy with seats\r\nin the most advantageous position. Hence the afterthought of the\r\ndecorative but penetrative ironwork.\r\n\r\nBut the oldest and most interesting building in Colnbrook is the “Ostrich”\r\ninn, whose long, gabled timber-and-plaster front, now partly divided up\r\ninto shops and tenements, is clearly of Elizabethan date. It is\r\npicturesque, rambling, shabby outside, and shabby and darkling within, and\r\nthe most satisfactory part of it is without doubt the little courtyard\r\nthrough the archway, where, turning round on the cobble-stones, you get a\r\npicturesque and a sunny view of steep roofs, dormer windows, dove-cot, and\r\nwhite-washed walls covered with grape-vines.\r\n\r\nThe present “Ostrich” is the successor of a much more ancient inn. There\r\nhave been, in fact, several inns on this site. The first appears to have\r\nbeen a guest-house, or hospice--“_quoddam hospitium in viâ Londoniæ apud\r\nColebroc_”--founded by one Milo Crispin, and given, in 1106, in trust to\r\nthe Abbey of Abingdon, for the good of travellers in this world and the\r\nsalvation of his soul in the next.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be from this circumstance that the inn obtained its name,\r\nfor it was early known as the “Ospridge,” a kind of orthographic half-way\r\nhouse between the former “hospice” and the present “Ostrich.”\r\n\r\nIf we may believe the old chroniclers’ statements--and there is no reason\r\nwhy we should not--the house became in after years a place of resort for\r\nguests going to and from Windsor Castle; and here the ambassadors robed\r\nthemselves before being conducted the last few miles, and so into the\r\nRoyal presence. Froissart chronicles four ambassadors to Edward the Third\r\ndining with the King: “So they dyned in the Kynge’s chamber, and after\r\nthey departed, lay the same night at Colbrook.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “OSTRICH,” COLNBROOK.]\r\n\r\nHow it happened that the inn kept its customers after the dreadful murders\r\ntraditionally said to have been committed here by wholesale in the reign\r\nof Henry the First, certainly not fifty years after the hospice was given\r\nto Abingdon Abbey, there is no explaining. The ancient pamphlets that\r\nnarrate the Sweeny Todd-like particulars do not enlighten us on that head.\r\n\r\nThe undiluted horror of the whole thing is exceedingly revolting, and one\r\nwould rather not give a further lease of life to it, but that in an\r\naccount of Old Inns their unpleasing story must needs be set forth, in\r\ncompany with their lighter legends. Moreover, the late sixteenth-century\r\nromance of _Thomas of Reading_, in which the story occurs, is by way of\r\nbeing a classic. It was written, probably in 1598, by one Thomas Delaney,\r\nand is a lengthy narrative of a wealthy clothier of that name, otherwise\r\nThomas Cole. Characterised variously as “a fabulous and childish history,”\r\nand as “a mixture of historical fact and fictitious narrative,” it was, at\r\nany rate, a highly successful publication, for by 1632 it had reached its\r\nsixth edition, and eventually was circulated, broadcast, as a penny\r\nchap-book.\r\n\r\nAccording to this “pleasant and famous historie,” there was once upon a\r\ntime, in the days of Henry the First, one Thomas Cole, a wealthy clothier\r\nof Reading, who was used frequently to travel on his business between that\r\ntown and London. Commonly he journeyed in company with two intimate\r\nclothier friends, Gray of Gloucester and William of Worcester. He himself\r\nwas a worshipful man, of honesty and great wealth, and was usually known\r\nas Thomas of Reading. The three would usually dine at the “Ostrich” on the\r\nway to London, and on the return sleep there. We are asked to believe that\r\nthis business man, Thomas Cole, on such occasions gave the money he\r\ncarried into the care of the landlady overnight, and that by this\r\nmisplaced confidence he was marked down for destruction.\r\n\r\nJarman, the innkeeper, and his wife had long been engaged in what is\r\nrather delicately styled the “systematic removal” of wealthy guests, and\r\nhad devised an ingenious murder-trap in the principal bedroom, by which\r\nthe bed, firmly secured to a trap-door, was in the dead of night, when the\r\nhouse resounded to the intended victim’s snoring, plunged suddenly into a\r\nhuge copper filled with boiling water, placed in the room below. He was\r\nthen “polished off,” as Sweeny Todd himself would say, and should it\r\nhappen that other guests of the night before asked after the missing one,\r\nthey would be told that he had taken horse early and gone away.\r\n\r\nThe victim’s horse would be taken to a distance and disguised, his clothes\r\ndestroyed, his body thrown into the Colne, or into the Thames at\r\nWraysbury, and his money added to the fortune mine host and his wife were\r\nthus rapidly acquiring.\r\n\r\nAs Thomas Cole had business in London more frequently than his friends, it\r\nnaturally followed that he sometimes went alone. On the first such\r\noccasion he was, according to the author of this “pleasant historie,”\r\n“appointed to be the fat pig that should be killed: For it is to be\r\nunderstood that when they plotted the murder of any man, this was alwaies\r\ntheir terme, the man to his wife, and the woman to her husband: ‘Wife,\r\nthere is now a fat pig to be had if you want one.’ Whereupon she would\r\nanswer thus: ‘I pray you put him in the hogstie till to-morrow.’”\r\n\r\nHe was accordingly given the room--the condemned cell, so to speak--above\r\nthe copper, and by next morning would doubtless have been floating\r\ninanimate down the Thames, had not his friend Gray unexpectedly joined him\r\nin the evening. On another occasion his hour was nearly come, when\r\nColnbrook was aroused at night by people riding post-haste from London\r\nwith news that all Chepe was ablaze; and he must needs be up and away\r\nwithout sleeping, for he had interests there.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper was wrathy at these mischances; “but,” said he, in a phrase\r\neven yet heard, “the third time will pay for all.”\r\n\r\nYet again the threatened clothier came riding alone, but in the night he\r\nwas roused by the innkeeper himself to help quiet a riotous dispute that\r\nhad arisen in the house over dice.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he fell ill while staying at the “Ostrich,” or the\r\n“Crane,” as some accounts name the house, and had to be nursed; but the\r\nfifth time was fatal. Omens pursued him on that occasion, and many another\r\nwould have turned back. His horse stumbled and broke a leg, and he had to\r\nfind another, and when he had done so and had resumed his journey, he was\r\nso sleepy he could scarce sit in the saddle. Then, as he drew near\r\nColnbrook, his nose began to bleed.\r\n\r\nThe happenings of the day depressed him when at last he had come to the\r\ninn. He could take nothing, and the innkeeper and his wife remarked upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Jesu, Master Cole,” quoth they, “what ails ye to-night? Never before did\r\nwe see you thus sad. Will it please you to have a quart of burnt sack?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” he rejoined; but presently lapsed into his former mood.\r\n\r\n“I have but one child in the world,” said he, “and that is my daughter,\r\nand half that I have is hers and the other half my wife’s. But shall I be\r\ngood to nobody but them? In conscience, my wealth is too much for a couple\r\nto possess, and what is our religion without charity? And to whom is\r\ncharity more to be shown than to decayed householders? Tom Dove, through\r\nhis love of jollity and good-fellowship, hath lost his all. Good my Oast,\r\nlend me a pen and inke, for straightway I will write a letter vnto the\r\npoore man, and something I will give him. God knows how long I shall\r\nlive.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Master Cole,” said the innkeeper, when shown what the clothier had\r\nwritten, “’tis no letter, but a will you have written.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis true,” said Cole, “and I have but written that which God put into my\r\nmind.” Then, folding and sealing it, he desired his host to despatch it,\r\nand was not satisfied until he himself had hired the carrier. Then he fell\r\na-weeping, and so went to bed, to the accompaniment of many other dolorous\r\nsigns and portents. “The scritch-owle cried piteously, and anon after the\r\nnight-rauen sate croaking hard by the window. ‘Jesu have mercy vpon me,’\r\nquoth hee, ‘what an ill-favoured cry doe yonder carrion birds make;’ and\r\nthereupon he laid him down in his bed, from whence he neuer rose againe.”\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper also was shaken by these ominous things, and would have\r\nspared his guest; but his wife was of other mettle.\r\n\r\n“What,” said she, “faint you now?”--and showed him the gold that had been\r\ngiven into her care.\r\n\r\nIn the end they served the unfortunate Cole as they had many another, and\r\nthrew his body into the little river that runs near by: hence, according\r\nto the old accounts, the name of the place, originally Cole-in-brook!\r\n\r\nThis last ridiculous, infantile touch is sufficient to discredit the\r\nwhole story, and when we learn that, according to one account thirteen,\r\nand by the testimony of another no fewer than sixty, travellers had been,\r\nin like manner, “removed,” we are inclined to believe the whole thing the\r\ninvention of some anonymous, bloody-minded pamphleteer, and care little\r\nwhether the innkeeper and his wife were hanged (as we are told) or retired\r\nwith a fortune and founded a family.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, one cannot understand the persistent attempt to connect the\r\nso-called “Blue Room” of the present house with the fatal bedroom. If\r\nthere is any truth at all in the story of Master Cole, his tragical ending\r\nwas accomplished in a house demolished eight hundred years ago; for we\r\nhave it, in the words of the writer of _Thomas of Reading_, that “the King\r\n(Henry the First) commanded the house should be quite consumed with fire\r\nand that no man should ever build vpon that cursed ground.”\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, the recent attempts to connect Turpin with the\r\n“Ostrich” will not bear the least investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARD OF THE “OSTRICH,” COLNBROOK.]\r\n\r\nThis ghastly story claimed, with such extraordinary zeal, by the “Ostrich”\r\nis by no means the only one of its kind, for many an old tale of horror\r\nhas for its central feature the wicked innkeeper who robbed and murdered\r\nhis guests. The most famous, and most revolting, legend is that included\r\nin the career of St. Nicholas of Myra, which serves to show that this\r\nlicensed-victualling depravity was international. The true story of St.\r\nNicholas is not miraculous, and is simply earnest of his good and pitiful\r\nnature. He entreated, and secured from Eustathius, governor of Myra, the\r\npardon of three men imprisoned in a tower and condemned to die, and is\r\noften represented with a tower at the side of him and three mannikins\r\nrising out of it. In the course of time the tower became a tub, and the\r\nlittle men were changed into children, and those changes in their turn\r\ngave rise to a wholly fictitious story that fairly outranges all the other\r\nincredible marvels of the dark ages. According to this tale, an innkeeper,\r\nrunning short of bacon, seized three little boys, cut them up, and pickled\r\nthem in a salting-tub. St. Nicholas, hearing that they had gone to the inn\r\nand had disappeared there, had his saintly suspicions aroused. He asked\r\nfor the pickle-tub, addressed it in some form of words that unfortunately\r\nhave not been preserved to us, and straightway the fragments sorted\r\nthemselves out, and pieced themselves together, and the children went off\r\nto play.\r\n\r\nA curious feature of the old frontage of the “Ostrich” was the doorway\r\nmade in coaching times in the upper storey for the convenience of\r\npassengers, who were in this manner enabled to step directly into the\r\nhouse from the roofs of the coaches. There are those still living who\r\nremember this contrivance; but the space has long been filled in, and the\r\nsole vestige of it is an unobtrusive wooden sill resting on the timbering\r\nbeneath the swinging sign.\r\n\r\nRomance, very dark and gory, clothes the memory of the “Blue Boar” at\r\nLeicester, a house unfortunately pulled down in the ’30’s of the\r\nnineteenth century. According to tradition, Richard the Third, coming to\r\nLeicester and finding the castle already dilapidated, stayed at the inn\r\nbefore the battle of Bosworth, and slept in the huge oaken four-poster bed\r\nwhich remained in the house until the date of its demolition. It was not\r\nonly a bed, but also a treasure-chest, for in the time of one Clark, who\r\nkept the house in the later years of Queen Elizabeth and the earlier part\r\nof the reign of James the First, a great store of gold coin was discovered\r\nin the framework of it. Mrs. Clark, making up the bed hastily, shook it\r\nwith more than usual vigour, when, to her surprise, a gold coin dropped\r\nout. Examination led to the discovery that the bedstead had a false bottom\r\nand that the space between was one vast cash-box. Clark did not at the\r\ntime disclose the find, and so became “mysteriously” rich. In the course\r\nof a few years he was gathered to his fathers, and his widow kept on the\r\nhouse, but was murdered in 1613 for the sake of her gold by a maidservant,\r\nwho, together with no fewer than seven men accomplices, was duly hanged\r\nfor the crime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “PIFF’S ELM.”]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of resolving tradition into fact, of putting a date to\r\nlegends and tracing them to their origin, is generally insurmountable. Let\r\nus take, for example, the “Old White Swan,” at “Piff’s Elm.” Casting a\r\nroving eye upon the map of Gloucestershire, I see by chance, between\r\nTewkesbury and Gloucester, a place so named. It tells me vaguely of\r\nromance, and I resolve, at all hazards, to go to that spot and sketch, if\r\nsketchable, the inn I suspect to be there, and note the story that\r\nbelongs, or should belong, to it. In due course I come to that lonely\r\nplace, and there, to be sure, is an inn--once a considerable house on the\r\nold coaching and posting route between Cheltenham and Tewkesbury--and not\r\nonly an inn, but a picturesque one, fronted with the giant stump of an\r\nelm--whether Piff’s or another’s, who shall say?\r\n\r\nAnd Piff himself? Whether he was a highwayman or was murdered by a\r\nhighwayman; or if he were a suicide who hanged himself from the elm\r\nassociated with him, or a criminal gibbeted there, I cannot tell you, nor\r\ncan any one else. Some stories say one thing, some another, and others\r\nstill put quite different complexions upon it. In that choice of legends\r\nlurks romance itself, perhaps reduced from the highest realms of tragedy\r\nby the unfortunately farcical name of the mysterious Piff.\r\n\r\nEqually romantic, and irreducible to cold-drawn fact, is the legend of\r\nKing James and the Tinker, associated with the “King and Tinker” inn at\r\nWhite Webbs Lane, in what was once Enfield Chase. According to the tale,\r\nKing James the First, hunting in the woodlands that surrounded his palace\r\nof Theobalds, lost himself, and, drawing rein at the inn--whatever then\r\nwas the sign of it--encountered a tinker drinking a modest stoup of ale\r\nin the porch.\r\n\r\n“What news, good fellow?” asked the horseman.\r\n\r\n“No news that I wot of,” replied the tinker, “save that they say the\r\nKing’s out a-hunting in the Chase to-day. I should like to see the King,\r\nalthough I suppose he’s very much like other folk.”\r\n\r\n“So you’d like to see the King?” queried his Majesty.\r\n\r\n“Ay, just for the sake of saying so,” replied the tinker.\r\n\r\n“Mount behind me, then,” said the King, “and I will show you him.”\r\n\r\n“But how shall I know him when I see him?”\r\n\r\n“Easily enough. You will know him by his remaining covered.”\r\n\r\nSoon the King came upon his retinue, all of whom promptly bared their\r\nheads. “Now, my friend, where is the King?” asked his Majesty, turning,\r\nwith a smile, in his saddle.\r\n\r\n“There’s only we two covered, and since I know I’m no king, I--O! pardon,\r\nyour Majesty!” replied the now trembling tinker.\r\n\r\nThe King laughed. “Now,” said he, “since you have seen how a King looks,\r\nyou shall also see how he acts,” and then, drawing his sword, he knighted\r\nthe tinker on the spot; or, in the words of the brave old ballad:\r\n\r\n  “Come, tell me thy name.” “I am John of the Dale,\r\n  A mender of kettles, and fond of good ale.”--\r\n  “Then rise up, Sir John, for I’ll honour thee here,--\r\n  I make thee a Knight of five hundred a year!”\r\n\r\nWell may the mark of exclamation stand there, not only at the general\r\nimprobability of such a thing, but at the preposterous idea of the niggard\r\nJames the First being guilty of an act of unreasonable generosity. But one\r\nmust not question the legend at the “King and Tinker,” where it is\r\ndevoutly cherished. I have before me a four-page pamphlet, issued at the\r\ninn, wherein the ancient ballad is printed at length and surmounted, not\r\nvery convincingly, by a woodblock in the Bewick manner, showing a number\r\nof sportsmen in the costume of George the Third’s time, about, in a most\r\nunsportsmanlike way, to ride over the hounds. In the distance is Windsor\r\nCastle. It will be conceded that, as an illustration of the King James and\r\nthe Tinker legend, this is lacking in some of those intimate touches that\r\nwould make the incident live again.\r\n\r\nBut the legend and the ballad are much older than the days of James the\r\nFirst. They are, in fact, to be found, on substantially the same lines, in\r\nmost centuries and many countries, Haroun-al-Raschid is found, in the\r\n_Arabian Nights_, in circumstances not dissimilar: while the story of\r\nHenry the Second--or, as some versions have it, Henry the Eighth--and the\r\nMiller of Mansfield is another familiar parallel. There again we find the\r\nKing riding away in the forest from his courtiers, only in that instance\r\nit is the Forest of Sherwood. He is given shelter by the miller, and\r\nshares a bed with the miller’s son, Dick. Next morning the agitated\r\ncourtiers discover the King, who knights his host, “Sir John Cockle,” and\r\neventually names him ranger of Sherwood, with a salary of £300.\r\n\r\nFrom romance of this almost fairy-tale kind let us turn to the equally\r\nastonishing, but better established, story associated with the once-famed\r\n“Pelican” at Speenhamland, on the outskirts of Newbury. The Peerage, which\r\nhas long appeared to exist almost exclusively for the purpose of\r\nscandalising staid folk by the amazing marriages of its members, included\r\nin 1744 a Duke of Chandos; Henry Brydges, the second Duke, at that time a\r\nwidower. He and a friend, dining at the “Pelican” on their way from Bath\r\nto London in that year, were interrupted by an unwonted excitement that\r\nappeared to be agitating the establishment. Inquiring the cause, they were\r\ntold that a man was about to sell his wife in the inn yard. “Let us go and\r\nsee,” quoth the Duke; and they accordingly went forth into the courtyard\r\nand saw a handsome, modest-looking young woman enter, in the approved\r\nmanner, with a halter round her neck, and led by her husband, who is\r\ndescribed as a “brutal ostler.”\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable instance of love at first sight. The name of this\r\nfortunate young woman was Ann Wells. The Duke bought her (the price is not\r\nstated) and married her on Christmas Day. She died in 1757, at Keynsham,\r\nnear Bristol, leaving an only daughter, Lady Augusta, who married a Mr.\r\nKearney.\r\n\r\nThere remained until recent times a funeral hatchment in Keynsham Church\r\non which the arms of this greatly daring Duke were impaled with those\r\nfound by the Herald’s College for his plebeian wife: “three fountains (for\r\n‘Wells’) on a field azure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPICKWICKIAN INNS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat visions of Early Victorian good-fellowship and conviviality, of the\r\nroast-beef and rum-punch kind, are called up by the title! The Pickwickian\r\nInn was, in the ’30’s of the nineteenth century, the last word in\r\nhospitable comfort, and its kitchen achieved the topmost pinnacle of\r\nculinary refinement demanded by an age that was robust rather than\r\nrefined, whose appetites were gross rather than discriminating, and whose\r\nrequirements seem to ourselves, of a more sybarite and exacting\r\ngeneration, few and modest. The Pickwickian age was an age of prodigious\r\nperformances in eating and drinking, and our ancestors of that time, so\r\nonly they had great joints, heaped-up dishes, and many bottles and\r\ndecanters set before them, cared comparatively little about delicate\r\nflavours. The chief aim was to get enough, and the “enough” of our\r\ngreat-grandfathers would nowadays be a surfeit to ourselves. If it were\r\nnot then quite the essential mark of a jolly good fellow to be carried up\r\nto bed at the end of an evening with the punch and the old port, a man who\r\nshirked his drink was looked upon with astonishment, almost suspicion, and\r\nthe only use in those deep-drinking days and nights for table-waters was\r\nto help a man along the road to recovery, after “a night of it.”\r\n\r\nThen to be otherwise than of a Pickwickian rotundity was to be not merely\r\na poor creature, but generally connoted some mental crook or eccentricity;\r\nwhile fatness and hearty good-nature were thought of almost as\r\ninterchangeable terms.\r\n\r\n’Twas ever thus. Even Shakespeare loved the well-larded, and makes Julius\r\nCæsar, who himself was sufficiently lean, say:\r\n\r\n  Let me have men about me that are fat;\r\n  Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o’ nights:\r\n  Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look:\r\n  He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Dickens they were still suspect; and when at last Wilkie\r\nCollins made his villainous Count Fosco a fat villain, the new departure\r\nseemed to that generation a wanton, extravagant flying in the face of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThere are even yet to be found substantial old inns something after the\r\nPickwickian ideal, but they are few and far between, and they are none of\r\nthem Pickwickian to the core. Rarely do you see nowadays the monumental\r\nsideboards, with the almost equally monumental sirloins of beef and the\r\nlike, and even the huge cheese, last of the old order of things to survive\r\nupon these tables, is nowadays generally represented by a modest wedge.\r\n\r\nIt is true that even the Pickwickians did not always happen upon\r\nwell-ordered inns, for the “Great White Horse” at Ipswich was severely\r\ncriticised by Dickens; but such exceptions do but serve to prove the\r\nDickensian rule, that there was no such place, and there never had been\r\nany such place, as the hostelry of the coaching age for creature-comforts\r\nand good service. Dickens had already, when he began writing _The Pickwick\r\nPapers_ at the age of twenty-five, an almost encyclopædic knowledge of\r\ninns, especially of country inns. It was, like his own Mr. Weller’s\r\nknowledge of London, “extensive and peculiar.” His fount of information\r\nabout country inns, at any rate, was acquired at an early and receptive\r\nage, in his many and hurried journeys as a reporter, when, on behalf of\r\n_The Morning Chronicle_, he flew--flew, that is to say, as flying was then\r\nmetaphorically understood, at an average rate of something under ten miles\r\nan hour--by coach, east, west, north, and south, in the capacity of\r\nParliamentary reporter, despatched to “take” the flow of eloquence from\r\nMembers, or would-be Members of Parliament, addressing the conventionally\r\n“free and enlightened” voters of the provinces.\r\n\r\nNo fewer than fifty-five inns, taverns, etc., London and provincial, are\r\nnamed in _Pickwick_, many of them at considerable length; but, so great\r\nand sweeping have been the changes of the last seventy years, only twelve\r\nnow remain. The London houses, with the exception of Osborne’s Hotel, John\r\nStreet, Adelphi--now the “Adelphi” Hotel--and the “George and Vulture,”\r\nin George Yard, Lombard Street--in these days almost better known as\r\nThomas’s Restaurant--have been either utterly disestablished or remodelled\r\nbeyond all knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Pickwick_ is the very Odyssey of inns and travel. You reach the second\r\nchapter and are whirled away at once from London by the “Commodore” coach,\r\nstarting from the “Golden Cross,” Charing Cross, for Rochester, and only\r\ncease your travels and adventures at inns in Chapter LI., near the end of\r\nthe story. Meanwhile you have coasted over a very considerable portion of\r\nEngland with the Pickwickians: from Rochester and Ipswich on the east, to\r\nBath and Bristol on the west, and as far as Birmingham and Coventry in the\r\nMidlands.\r\n\r\nHe who would write learnedly and responsibly on the subject of Pickwickian\r\nInns must bring to his task a certain amount of foreknowledge, and must\r\nadd to that equipment by industry and research--and even then he shall\r\nfind himself, after all, convicted of errors and inadequacies; for indeed,\r\nalthough the Pickwickians began their travels no longer ago than 1827, the\r\nchanges in topography for one thing, and in manners and customs for\r\nanother, are so great that it needs a scientific historian to be\r\nilluminating on the subject.\r\n\r\nTo begin at the usual place, the beginning, the history of the “Golden\r\nCross,” the famous inn whence the Pickwickians started, offers a fine\r\nseries of snares, pitfalls, traps, and rocks of offence to him who does\r\nnot walk warily, for the “Golden Cross” of to-day, although a coaching inn\r\nremodelled, is by no means the original of that name, and indeed stands on\r\nquite a different (although neighbouring) site.\r\n\r\nChanges in the geography of London have been so continuous, so intricate,\r\nand so puzzling that few people at once realise how the inn can have stood\r\nuntil 1830 at the rear of King Charles the First’s statue, on the spot now\r\noccupied by the south-eastern one of the four lions guarding the Nelson\r\nColumn.\r\n\r\nAt that time Charing Cross was still the narrow junction of streets seen\r\nin Shepherd’s illustration, where the “Golden Cross” inn is prominent on\r\nthe left hand, and Northumberland House, the London palace of the Dukes of\r\nNorthumberland (pulled down in 1874), more prominent on the right. The\r\nblock of buildings, including the “Golden Cross,” was removed, in 1830, to\r\nform part of the open space of Trafalgar Square, and the site of the ducal\r\nmansion is now Northumberland Avenue.\r\n\r\nThere had long been a “Golden Cross” inn here: how long we do not know,\r\nbut a house of that name was in existence in 1643, for in that year we\r\nfind the Puritans demanding the removal of the, to them, offensive sign of\r\nthe cross. It was then a half-way house at the little village of Charing,\r\nmidway between the then entirely separate and distinct cities of London\r\nand Westminster. In front of it, on the site of King Charles’s statue,\r\nstood the ancient cross of Charing, erected, long centuries before, to the\r\nmemory of Queen Eleanor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GOLDEN CROSS,” IN PICKWICKIAN DAYS.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest picture we have of the “Golden Cross” inn is a view by\r\nCanaletti, engraved in 1753, showing a sign projecting boldly over the\r\nfootpath. As the architectural style of the house shown in that view is\r\nlater than that prevailing in the reign of Charles the First, the inn must\r\nobviously have been rebuilt at least once in the interval. This building\r\nis again illustrated in a painting executed certainly later than 1770,\r\naccording to the evidence of the sign, which, instead of the old gallows\r\nsign in Canaletti’s picture, is replaced by a board fixed against the\r\nfront of the building, in obedience to the Acts of Parliament, 1762-70,\r\nforbidding overhanging signs in London. That such measures were necessary\r\nhad been made abundantly evident so early as 1718, when a heavy sign had\r\nfallen in Bride Lane, Fleet Street, tearing down the front of the house\r\nand killing four persons.\r\n\r\nIn this view, later than 1770, and probably executed about 1800, we have\r\nthe “Golden Cross” inn of _Pickwick_. Its successor, the Gothic-fronted\r\nbuilding generally associated by Dickens commentators with that story, was\r\nbuilt in 1828 and demolished two years later. Dickens wrote _Pickwick_ in\r\n1836: when both the house he indicated and its successor were swept away,\r\nand the very site cleared and made a part of the open road; but, as he\r\nspecifically states that the Pickwickians began their travels on May 13th,\r\n1827, it must needs have been the predecessor of the Gothic building from\r\nwhich they set forth on the “Commodore” coach for Rochester.\r\n\r\nThe inn at that time had a hospitable-looking front and a really handsome\r\nrange of coffee-room windows looking out upon the street. Beside them you\r\nsee the celebrated archway of Jingle’s excited and disjointed cautions:\r\n“Terrible place--dangerous work--other day--five children--mother--tall\r\nlady, eating sandwiches--forgot the arch--crash--knock--children look\r\nround--mother’s head off--sandwich in her hand--no mouth to put it\r\nin--head of a family off--shocking, shocking!”\r\n\r\nThe great stable-yard and the back premises probably remained untouched,\r\nfor when David Copperfield came up by coach from Canterbury, the “Golden\r\nCross” was, we learn, “a mouldy sort of establishment,” and his bedroom\r\n“smelt like a hackney-coach, and was shut up like a family\r\nvault”--characteristics not generally associated with new buildings.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, although references to the “Golden Cross” are plentiful in\r\nliterature, they are few of them flattering: “A nasty inn, remarkable for\r\nfilth and apparent misery,” wrote Edward Shergold, early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and he was but one of a cloud of witnesses to the same effect. It\r\nis thus a little difficult to understand a writer in _The Epicure’s\r\nAlmanack_ for 1815, who says, in the commendatory way, that the fame of\r\nthe “Golden Cross” had spread “from the Pillars of Hercules to the Ganges;\r\nfrom Nova Scotia to California.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARING CROSS, ABOUT 1829, SHOWING THE “GOLDEN CROSS” INN.\r\n_From the engraving after T. Hosmer Shepherd._]\r\n\r\nAt that period this was the chief booking-office for coaches in the West\r\nEnd of London, and it was to that quarter what the “Bull and Mouth” was to\r\nthe City. To that commanding position it had been raised by William Horne,\r\nwho came here from the “White Horse” in Fetter Lane, in 1805. He died in\r\n1828, and was succeeded by his son, the great coach-proprietor, Benjamin\r\nWorthy Horne, who further improved the property, and was powerful enough\r\nto command respect at the councils of the early railways. Under his rule,\r\nbeneath the very shadow of the Charing Cross Improvement Act, by whose\r\nprovisions Trafalgar Square was ordained and eventually created, the house\r\nwas rebuilt, with a frontage in the Gothic manner. Shepherd’s view of\r\nCharing Cross, published December 18th, 1830, shows this immediate\r\nsuccessor of the Pickwickian inn very clearly, with, next door, the\r\nestablishment of Bish, for whose lotteries Charles Lamb was employed to\r\nwrite puffs.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, who had the Charing Cross\r\nimprovement in charge, cleared the ground, the inn migrated to the new\r\nbuilding, some distance eastwards, the present “Golden Cross,” 452, West\r\nStrand, which, like the whole of the West Strand, in the Nash,\r\nstucco-classic manner, was designed in 1832, by Mr. (afterwards Sir\r\nWilliam) Tite.\r\n\r\nMaginn lamented these changes, in the verses “An Excellent New Ballad;\r\nbeing entitled a Lamentation on the Golden Cross, Charing Cross”:\r\n\r\n  No more the coaches shall I see\r\n    Come trundling from the yard,\r\n  Nor hear the horn blown cheerily\r\n    By brandy-bibbing guard.\r\n  King Charles, I think, must sorrow sore,\r\n    Even were he made of stone,\r\n  When left by all his friends of yore\r\n    (Like Tom Moore’s rose) alone.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  O! London won’t be London long,\r\n    For ’twill be all pulled down;\r\n  And I shall sing a funeral song\r\n    O’er that time-honoured town.\r\n\r\nAccording to a return made to Parliament of the expenses in connection\r\nwith these street improvements, “10 Houses and the Golden Cross Inn,\r\nStable Yards, &c.,” were purchased for £108,884 4_s._; the inn itself\r\napparently, if we are to believe a statement in _The Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_, 1831, with three houses in St. Martin’s Lane and two houses and\r\nworkshops in Frontier Court, costing £30,000 of that sum.\r\n\r\nThe present building was planned with a courtyard, and had archways to the\r\nStrand and to Duncannon Street. The last remains, and is in use as a\r\nrailway receiving-office, but the Strand archway, the principal entrance,\r\nwas built up and abolished in 1851.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GOLDEN CROSS,” SUCCESSOR OF THE PICKWICKIAN INN, AS\r\nREBUILT 1828.]\r\n\r\nThe first house to which Mr. Pickwick and his followers--the amorous\r\nTupman, Winkle the sportsman, and the poetic Snodgrass--came at the\r\nclose of their first day’s travel is still in being. I name the “Bull” at\r\nRochester, which long ago adopted Jingle’s recommendation, and blazoned it\r\non the rather dingy forefront, of grey brick: “Good house--nice beds.” It\r\nis still very much as it was when Dickens conferred immortality upon it;\r\nonly there are now portraits of him and pictures of Pickwickian characters\r\non the walls of the staircase. Still you may find in the hall the\r\n“illustrious larder,” rather like a Chippendale book-case, behind whose\r\nglass doors the “noble joints and tarts” are still placed--only I think\r\nthey have not now the nobility or the aldermanic proportions demanded by\r\nan earlier generation--and the cold fowls are indubitably there. The “very\r\ngrove” of dangling uncooked joints is, if one’s memory of such things\r\nserves, not as described, in the hall, but depending, as they commonly are\r\nmade to do in old inns, from hooks in the ceiling of the archway entrance.\r\nThe custom excites the curiosity of many. To the majority of observers it\r\nhas seemed to be by way of advertisement of the good cheer within; but the\r\nreal reason is sufficiently simple: it is to keep the joints fresh and\r\nsweet in the current of air generally to be reckoned upon in that\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe ball-room, with the “elevated den” for musicians at one end, is a real\r\nroom, and you wonder exceedingly at the smallness, not only of the den,\r\nbut of the room itself, where the fine flower of Dockyard society\r\ngathered and fraternised with the even finer flower of that belonging to\r\nthe Garrison: the two, joining forces, condescending to, or sneering upon,\r\nthe vulgar herd of tradesmen and their wives.\r\n\r\nIn this somewhat exiguous apartment Tupman and Jingle danced, and the\r\nbellicose Dr. Slammer, of the 97th Regiment, glared; and the society of\r\nChatham and Rochester had, you cannot help thinking, a very close and\r\ntightly packed evening.\r\n\r\nThey take their Pickwickian associations very seriously at the “Bull,”\r\nwhich, by the way, is an “inn” no longer, but an “hotel.” In 1836, the\r\nPrincess Victoria and her mother, travelling to London, were detained by\r\nstress of weather that rendered it dangerous to cross the bridge, and they\r\nreluctantly stayed at Rochester the night. Who were low-class\r\nPickwickians, that they should stand before such distinction? So the old\r\nhouse for a while took on a new name, and became the “Victoria and Bull,”\r\nand then, Royal associations gradually waning and literary landmarks\r\ngrowing more popular, the “Bull and Victoria,” finally, in these last\r\nyears, revered again to its simple old name.\r\n\r\nThat Royal visit is well-nigh forgotten now, and you are no longer invited\r\nto look with awe upon the rooms occupied by those august, indubitably\r\nflesh-and-blood travellers; but you _are_ shown the bedrooms of the\r\nentirely fictitious Pickwickians.\r\n\r\n“So this is where Mr. Pickwick is supposed to have slept?” remarked a\r\nvisitor, when viewing bedroom No. 17 by favour of a former landlord. That\r\nstranger meant no offence, but the landlord was greatly ruffled.\r\n“_Supposed_ to have slept? He _did_ sleep here, sir!”\r\n\r\n“O ye verities!” as Carlyle might have exclaimed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “BULL,” ROCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nMany Dickens commentators have long cherished what Horace Walpole might\r\nhave styled a “historic doubt” as to what house was that one in Rochester\r\nreferred to by Jingle as Wright’s. “Wright’s, next house, dear--very\r\ndear--half a crown in the bill if you look at the waiter--charge you more\r\nif you dine at a friend’s than they would if you dined in the\r\ncoffee-room--rum fellows--very.” But “Wright’s” really was the next\r\n“house”--house, that is to say, in the colloquial sense, by which\r\n“public-house” is understood, and not by any means next door.\r\n\r\nThere is every excuse for writers on Dickens-land going wrong here, for\r\nthe real name of the old house to which Wright came, somewhere about 1820,\r\nand on which he imposed his own was the “Crown.”\r\n\r\nThe old “Crown” fronted on to the High Street, and was one of those old\r\ngalleried inns already mentioned so plentifully in these pages. It claimed\r\nto have been built in 1390, and its yard was not only the spot where,\r\nunknown to all save his intimates, Henry the Eighth had his first peep at\r\nhis intended consort Anne of Cleves, whom that disappointed connoisseur in\r\nfeminine beauty immediately styled a “Flanders mare”; but was in all\r\nprobability the original of the inn-yard in _Henry the Fourth_, whence\r\nShakespeare’s flea-bitten carriers with their razes of ginger and other\r\ngoods for London, sleepless probably on account of those uncovenanted\r\nco-partners of their beds, set forth, by starlight, yawning, with much\r\ntalk of highway dangers. At the “Crown” too, once stayed no less a\r\npersonage than Queen Elizabeth; while some two centuries later Hogarth and\r\nhis fellow-roysterers stayed a night in the house, on their “Frolic” down\r\nThames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCHESTER IN PICKWICKIAN DAYS, SHOWING THE OLD BRIDGE AND\r\n“WRIGHT’S.”]\r\n\r\nWhen Wright came to the “Crown,” he, like any other monarch newly come to\r\nhis own, made sweeping alterations. Antiquity, gabled frontages,\r\nelaborately carved barge-boards, and all such architectural vanities were\r\nnothing to him, nor indeed were they much to any one else in that grossly\r\nunappreciative era, and he left that portion of the house to carriers and\r\nthe like, used all their lives to be leeched by diminutive lepidoptera.\r\nWright did business with customers of more tender hide, who had\r\npreferences for more civilised lodgment, and housed the great, the rich,\r\nand the luxurious, travelling post to and fro along the Dover Road. For\r\ntheir accommodation he built a remarkably substantial and amazingly ugly\r\nstructure--a something classical that might, by the look of it, be either\r\ntown hall, heathen temple, or early dissenting chapel--in the rear, and\r\nfacing the river. This was the building essentially “Wright’s.” It still\r\nstands, and people with sharp eyes, who look very hard in the right place,\r\nwill yet discover a ghostly “Wright’s” on what Mrs. Gamp would call the\r\n“parapidge.”\r\n\r\nSuch a place would naturally impress a poor strolling actor like Jingle,\r\nwhose humorous sally, “charge you more if you dine at a friend’s than they\r\nwould if you dined in the coffee-room,” is a perversion of the well-known\r\ncharge for “corkage” made by hotel-keepers when a guest brings his own\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nWright himself has, of course, long since gone to that place where\r\ninnkeepers who make extravagant demands upon travellers are held to\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe course of _Pickwick_ now takes us to “Muggleton,” as to whose\r\nidentity much uncertainty has long been felt. It is a choice between\r\nMaidstone and Town Malling, and as the distances given in the book between\r\nRochester and Dingley Dell and “Muggleton” cannot be made to agree with\r\neither Town Malling or Maidstone, it is a poor choice at the best. At the\r\nformer the “Swan” is pointed to as the real “Blue Lion,” and at Maidstone\r\nthe “White Lion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SWAN,” TOWN MALLING: IDENTIFIED WITH THE “BLUE LION,”\r\nMUGGLETON.]\r\n\r\nChapter X. takes us back to London, and there brings on to the crowded\r\nstage of _Pickwick_, for the first time, Sam Weller, engaged as “Boots” of\r\nthe “White Hart” in the Borough, in going over the foot-gear of the\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGN OF THE “BULL AND MOUTH.”]\r\n\r\nThis is how Dickens described the yard of the “White Hart.” It is a\r\nlittle clean-cut cameo of description, vividly portraying the features of\r\nthose old galleried inns that are now no more: “The yard presented none of\r\nthat bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large\r\ncoach inn. Three or four lumbering waggons, each with a pile of goods\r\nbeneath its ample canopy about the height of the second-floor window of an\r\nordinary house, were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over\r\none end of the yard; and another, which was probably to commence its\r\njourney that morning, was drawn out into the open space. A double tier of\r\nbedroom galleries with old clumsy balustrades ran round two sides of the\r\nstraggling area, and a double row of bells to correspond, sheltered from\r\nthe weather by a little sloping roof, hung over the door leading to the\r\nbar and coffee-room. Two or three gigs or chaise-carts were wheeled up\r\nunder different little sheds and pent-houses, and the occasional heavy\r\ntread of a cart-horse, or rattling of a chain at the further end of the\r\nyard, announced to anyone who cared about the matter that the stable lay\r\nin that direction. When we add that a few boys in smock-frocks were lying\r\nasleep on heavy packages, woolpacks, and other articles that were\r\nscattered about on heaps of straw, we have described as fully as need be\r\nthe general appearance of the ‘White Hart’ inn, High Street, Borough.”\r\n\r\nThis one of the many picturesque old galleried inns of that street was\r\ndemolished in 1865.\r\n\r\nSam is busily engaged, at moment of his introduction, cleaning eleven\r\npairs of boots belonging to the sleepers in the galleried bedrooms above.\r\n\r\n“A loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a\r\nsmart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery, who, after tapping at one\r\nof the doors and receiving a request from within, called over the\r\nbalustrades:\r\n\r\n“‘Sam.’\r\n\r\n“‘Hallo!’\r\n\r\n“‘Number Twenty-two wants his boots.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ask Number Twenty-two whether he’ll have ’em now, or wait till he gets\r\n’em,’” was the reply.\r\n\r\nPresently to this waggish person enter Mr. Pickwick, Old Wardle, and\r\nPerker, the lawyer. “‘Pretty busy, eh?’” asks the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“Oh, werry well, sir; we shan’t be bankrupts, and we shan’t make our\r\nfort’ns. We eats our biled mutton without capers, and don’t care about\r\nhorse-radish wen we can get beef;” which just about figures the middling\r\nand declining fortunes of the old Borough inns at that period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “BELLE SAUVAGE.” _From a drawing by T. Hosmer\r\nShepherd._]\r\n\r\nThe “Bull and Mouth” inn, casually mentioned in Chapter X., was the great\r\ncoaching inn that stood in St. Martin’s-le-Grand, on the site of the\r\nPost Office building adjoining the church of St. Botolph. In 1830 it was\r\nrebuilt and re-named the “Queen’s Hotel,” and so remained until 1887. The\r\nenormous plaster sign of the “Bull and Mouth,” that was placed over the\r\nentrance to the stables in the by-street of that name, and kept its place\r\nthere when the stables became a railway goods yard, is now in the\r\nGuildhall Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “LEATHER BOTTLE,” COBHAM.]\r\n\r\nThe “Belle Sauvage,” on Ludgate Hill, another fine old galleried inn\r\nwhence the coaches for the eastern counties largely set forth, is the\r\nsubject of allusion in Chapters X. and XLIII. The house was pulled down\r\nmany years ago, but the yard, now very commonplace, remains. It was known\r\nas “Savage’s Inn” so long ago as the reign of Henry the Sixth, and\r\nalternatively as the “Bell in the Hoop.” So early as 1568, when the\r\nproperty was bequeathed to the Cutler’s Company “for ever,” the “Belle\r\nSauvage” myth was current; and thus we see that when Addison, in _The\r\nSpectator_, suggested the “beautiful savage” idea, he was but\r\nunconsciously reviving an ancient legend or witticism. One other variant,\r\nthat ingeniously refers the sign of the inn to one Isabella Savage, a\r\nformer landlady, seems to have created her for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe “Marquis o’ Granby” at Dorking, kept by the “widder” who became the\r\nsecond Mrs. Weller, has been identified by some with the late “King’s\r\nHead” in that town; while the “Town Arms,” the “Peacock,” and the “White\r\nHart” at “Eatanswill” (_i.e._ Ipswich) have never been clearly traced.\r\n\r\nNo difficulty of identification surrounds the “Old Leather Bottle” at\r\nCobham, to whose rustic roof the love-lorn Tupman fled to hide his\r\nsorrows, in Chapter XI. It is to-day, however, a vastly altered place from\r\nthe merely “clean and commodious village ale-house” in which Mr. Pickwick\r\nfound his moping, but still hungry, friend, and its “Dickens Room” is a\r\nveritable museum. Additions have been made to the house, and it is now\r\nmore or less of a rustic hotel, with the sign of the leather bottle\r\nswinging in the breeze, and beneath it our Mr. Pickwick himself, in the\r\nimmortal attitude depicted in the frontispiece to _The Pickwick Papers_,\r\ndeclaiming, with one arm outstretched, the other tucked away under his\r\ncoat-tails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DICKENS ROOM, “LEATHER BOTTLE,” COBHAM.]\r\n\r\nThe “inn on Marlborough Downs,” referred to in the Bagman’s Story in\r\nChapter XIV., is still the subject of much heated controversy among\r\nDickens commentators. Sandwiched as it is (in the story told by a stranger\r\nto the Pickwickians at “Eatanswill”) between Ipswich and Bury St. Edmunds,\r\nit appears to be a vague recollection dragged in, neck and crop, by\r\nDickens, of some inn he had casually noticed in 1835, when travelling\r\nbetween London and Bristol. “But,” it has been asked, “_what_ inn was he\r\nthinking of, if indeed, of any specific inn at all?”\r\n\r\nThe Bagman with the Lonely Eye, who told the story of Tom Smart and the\r\nwidow-landlady of this wayside hostelry, spoke of Tom Smart driving his\r\ngig “in the direction of Bristol” across the bleak expanse, and of his\r\nmare drawing up of her own accord “before a roadside inn on the right-hand\r\nside of the way, about half a quarter of a mile from the end of the\r\ndowns.”\r\n\r\nWe are met here, at the very outset, by some puzzling discrepancies and by\r\na wide choice, “Marlborough Downs” being a stretch of wild, inhospitable\r\nchalk-down country extending the whole of the fourteen miles between\r\nMarlborough and Devizes, and being still “Marlborough Downs” at the\r\nthreshold of Devizes itself. Moreover, the same characteristic features\r\nare common to both the routes to Bath and Bristol that branch at\r\nBeckhampton and go, left by way of Devizes, and right through Calne and\r\nChippenham.\r\n\r\nThe “half a quarter of a mile from the end of the Downs” by the Devizes\r\nroute brings you, in the direction Tom Smart (of the firm of Bilson and\r\nSlum) was going, to a point a half, or three quarters, of a mile from\r\nDevizes town, where, neither on the right hand nor the left, was there\r\never an inn. The same distance from the end of this weird district on the\r\nCalne and Chippenham route conducts to the “Black Horse” inn at Cherhill,\r\nfull in view of the great white horse cut on the hillside in 1780, and\r\nstanding, correctly enough, on the right-hand side of the way. Could this\r\ninn possibly have been the house referred to by Dickens? I have never seen\r\nit suggested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “WAGGON AND HORSES,” BECKHAMPTON.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, earnest people who would dearly, once for all, wish to settle this\r\nknotty point, are like to be embarrassed by the numerous inns, not one of\r\nthem greatly resembling the house described by Dickens, that have claims\r\nto be considered the original, and stand, _all_ of them, upon the proper\r\nside of the road. Some commentators press the claim of the “Marquis of\r\nAilesbury’s Arms” at Manton, or Clatford, a mile out of Marlborough, and\r\nlocal opinion at the time of _The Pickwick Papers_ being written\r\nidentified the house with the lonely inn of Shepherd’s Shore, midway\r\nbetween Beckhampton and Devizes, in the very midst of the wild downs--the\r\ndowns of Marlborough--that are there at their wildest and loneliest.\r\nWhatever the correctitude or otherwise of what should be an expert\r\nview, certainly the inn of Shepherd’s Shore is a thing of the past, as in\r\nthe story, where it is described as having been pulled down. There were,\r\nindeed, at different periods two inns so called, and now both are gone.\r\n“Old Shepherd’s Shore” stood, as also did the new, beside the Wansdyke,\r\nbut at a considerable distance in a north-westerly direction, on the _old_\r\nroad to Devizes, now a mere track. Of “New Shepherd’s Shore” only a\r\nfragment remains, and although that fragment is inhabited, it is not any\r\nlonger an inn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “SHEPHERD’S SHORE.”]\r\n\r\nThe scene is entirely in accord with the description of the Downs in the\r\nBagman’s Story (only the spot is in the _midst_ of the wilderness, and not\r\nnear the end of it), and he who even nowadays travels the still lonesome\r\nway will heartily echo the statement that there are many pleasanter\r\nplaces. The old coachmen, who had exceptional opportunities of\r\nobservation, used to declare that the way between Beckhampton and\r\nShepherd’s Shore was the coldest spot on all the road between London and\r\nBath.\r\n\r\nThe eerie nature of the spot is emphasised by the circumstance of the\r\nremaining portion of the house standing beside that mysterious\r\npre-historic earthwork, the great ditch and embankment of the Wansdyke,\r\nthat goes marching grimly across the stark hillsides. The Wansdyke has\r\nalways impressed the beholder, and accordingly we find it marked on old\r\nmaps as “Deuill’s Ditch.”\r\n\r\nThe name of “Shepherd’s Shore” has been, and still is, a sore puzzle to\r\nall who have cause to write of it. Often written “Shord,” and pronounced\r\nby the country folk “Shard,” just as old seventeenth-century Aubrey prints\r\nit, antiquaries believe the name to derive from “shard,” a fragment: here\r\nspecifically a break in the Wansdyke, made in order to let the road (or\r\nthe sheep-track) through; “shard” itself being the Middle-English version\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon “sceard,” a division, a boundary, or a breach.\r\n\r\nThe name may, however, as I conceive it, be equally well a corrupt version\r\nof “Shepherd’s Shaw.” “Shaw” = the old Anglo-Saxon for a coppice, a clump\r\nof trees, or a bush. We see, even to-day (as of course merely a\r\ncoincidence) a clump of trees on the mystic tumulus beside the remains of\r\nthe house: trees noticeable enough on these otherwise naked downs, now, as\r\nfrom time immemorial, a grazing-ground for sheep. In this view Shepherd’s\r\nShore would be equivalent to “Shepherd’s Shaw,” and that to “Shepherd’s\r\nWood,” or “Shepherd’s Bush.” A shepherd’s bush was commonly a thorn-tree\r\non a sheep-down, used as a shelter, or as a post of observation, by\r\nshepherds watching their flocks. Such bushes, by constant use, assumed\r\ndistinctive and unmistakable forms,[15] and in old times were familiarly\r\nknown by that name.\r\n\r\nBut, to resume matters more purely Dickensian: it is the “Waggon and\r\nHorses” inn at Beckhampton that most nearly realises the description of\r\nthe house in _The Pickwick Papers_, although even here you most\r\nemphatically go up into the house (as the illustration shows) instead of\r\ntaking “a couple of steep steps leading down.” It is “on the right-hand\r\nside of the way,” and being at a kind of little cultivated oasis at the\r\nhamlet of Beckhampton, where the roads fork on the alternative routes to\r\nBath and Bristol, it may be considered as “about half a quarter of a mile”\r\nfrom the recommencement (not the end) of the Downs.\r\n\r\nThe “Waggon and Horses” is just the house a needy bagman such as Tom Smart\r\nwould have selected. It was in coaching days a homely yet comfortable\r\ninn, that received those travellers who did not relish either the state or\r\nthe expense of the great “Beckhampton Inn” opposite, where post-horses\r\nwere kept, and where the very _élite_ of the roads resorted.\r\n\r\n“The humble shall be exalted and the proud shall be cast down,” and it so\r\nhappened that when the Great Western Railway was opened to Bath and\r\nBristol on June 30th, 1841, the great inn fell upon ruination, while its\r\nhumbler neighbour has survived--and does very well, thank you. It should\r\nbe added that in the view presented here you are looking eastward, back in\r\nthe direction of Marlborough. The great dark hill beside the road in the\r\nmiddle distance is the vast pre-historic tumulus, the largest known in\r\nEurope, famous as Silbury Hill.\r\n\r\nThe great house that was once “Beckhampton Inn” is now, and long has been,\r\nMr. Samuel Darling’s training-stables for racehorses. There is probably no\r\nbetter-kept lawn in England than that triangular plot of grass in front of\r\nthe house, where--as you see in the picture--the roads fork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “BECKHAMPTON INN.”]\r\n\r\nThe “Angel” at Bury St. Edmunds, the scene of many stirring incidents in\r\nChapters XV. and XVI., is an enormous house of very severe and\r\nunornamental architecture, that looks as though it were an exercise in\r\nrectangles and a Puritan protest in white Suffolk, dough-like brick,\r\nagainst the mediæval pomps and vanities of the beautiful carved stone\r\nAbbey Gatehouse, upon which it looks, gauntly, across the great open,\r\nplain-like, empty thoroughfare of Angel Hill. This, the chief\r\ncoaching-and posting-house of Bury, was built in 1779 upon the site of a\r\nfifteenth-century “Angel,” and the present structure still stands upon\r\ngroined crypts and cellars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “ANGEL,” BURY ST. EDMUNDS.]\r\n\r\nNone may be so bold as to name for certain that tavern off Cheapside in\r\nChapter XX., to which the worried Mr. Pickwick “bent his steps” after the\r\ninterview with Dodson and Fogg, in Freeman’s Court, Cornhill. We know it\r\nwas in some court on the right-hand, or north, side of Cheapside; but, on\r\nthe other hand, we do not know how far Mr. Pickwick had proceeded along\r\nthat thoroughfare when Sam recommended, as a suitable place for “a glass\r\nof brandy and water warm,” the “last house but vun on the same side the\r\nvay--take the box as stands in the first fireplace, ’cos there an’t no leg\r\nin the middle o’ the table, wich all the others has, and it’s wery\r\ninconwenient.” Probably Grocers’ Hall Court is meant. It has still its\r\ncoffee-and chop-houses.\r\n\r\nThere it is that Tony Weller is introduced, and suggests that, as he is\r\n“working down” the coach to Ipswich in a couple of days’ time, from the\r\n“Bull” inn Whitechapel, Mr. Pickwick had better go with him. An incidental\r\nallusion is made in the same place to the “Black Boy” at Chelmsford, a\r\nfine old coaching inn, destroyed in 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was a good--nay, a phenomenal--pedestrian for so stout a man.\r\nFrom Cheapside--fortified possibly by the brandy and water--he walked to\r\nGray’s Inn, there ascending two pairs of steep (and dirty) stairs, and\r\nthence to Clare Market, and the “Magpie and Stump,” described as “situated\r\nin a court, happy in the double advantage of being in the vicinity of\r\nClare Market and closely approximating to the back of ‘New Inn.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GEORGE THE FOURTH TAVERN,” CLARE MARKET.]\r\n\r\nIt was “what ordinary people would designate a public-house,” and has been\r\nidentified by most with the “Old Black Jack” in Portsmouth Street, or its\r\nnext-door neighbour, the “George the Fourth Tavern,” both demolished in\r\n1896. The last-named house was remarkable for entirely overhanging the\r\npavement, the very tall building being supported on wooden posts springing\r\nfrom the kerb. In the words of Dickens: “In the lower windows, which were\r\ndecorated with curtains of a saffron hue, dangled two or three printed\r\ncards, bearing reference to Devonshire cyder and Dantzic spruce, while a\r\nlarge black board, announcing in white letters to an enlightened public\r\nthat there were 500,000 barrels of double stout in the cellars of the\r\nestablishment, left the mind in a state of not unpleasing doubt and\r\nuncertainty as to the precise direction in the bowels of the earth in\r\nwhich this mighty cavern might be supposed to extend. When we add that the\r\nweather-beaten sign-board bore the half-obliterated semblance of a magpie\r\nintently eyeing a crooked streak of brown paint, which the neighbours had\r\nbeen taught from infancy to consider as the ‘stump,’ we have said all that\r\nneed be said of the exterior of the edifice.”\r\n\r\nThe “Black Jack,” next door, was in the eighteenth century the scene of\r\none of the famous Jack Sheppard’s exploits. The Bow Street runners entered\r\nthe house after him, and, as they went in at the door, he jumped out of a\r\nfirst-floor window. In thieving circles the house was afterwards known as\r\n“The Jump.” The “Black Jack,” however, romantic though the title sounds,\r\ndid not owe its name to Sheppard, but to that old style of vessel, the\r\nleathern jacks or jugs of the Middle Ages. For their better preservation,\r\nthe old leathern jacks were often treated with a coating of pitch: hence\r\nthe name of “pitcher,” at a very early period enlarged to denote jugs in\r\ngeneral, whether of leather or of earthenware.\r\n\r\nThe proverbial pitcher that goes often to the well and is broken at last\r\ncould not possibly be a leathern one, for the greatest virtue of the\r\nleathern vessel was its indestructible nature, well set forth in the old\r\nsong of “The Leather Bottel”:\r\n\r\n  And when the bottle at last grows old,\r\n  And will good liquor no longer hold,\r\n  Out of its sides you may make a clout\r\n  To mend your shoes when they’re worn out;\r\n  Or take and hang it upon a pin--\r\n  ’Twill serve to put hinges and odd things in.\r\n  So I hope his soul in Heaven may dwell\r\n  Who first found out the Leather Bottel.\r\n\r\nSuch leather bottles, some of them very ancient, are often to be found,\r\neven at this day, in the barns and outhouses of remote hamlets, with a\r\nside cut away to receive those “hinges and odd things” of the verse. They\r\nare also often used to hold cart-grease.\r\n\r\nThe “Bull,” Whitechapel, whence Mr. Tony Weller “worked down” to Ipswich,\r\nwas numbered No. 25, Aldgate High Street. It stood in the rear of the\r\nnarrow entry shown in the accompanying illustration. Rightly, it will be\r\nseen, did Mr. Tony Weller advise the “outsides” on his coach to “take care\r\no’ the archvay, gen’lm’n.” The “Bull” was long occupied by the widowed\r\nMrs. Ann Nelson--one of those stern, dignified, magisterial women of\r\nbusiness who were a quite remarkable feature of the coaching age, who saw\r\ntheir husbands off to an early grave, and alone carried on the peculiarly\r\nexacting double business of innkeeping and coach-proprietorship, and did\r\nso with success. Mrs. Ann Nelson--no one ever dared so greatly as to spell\r\nher name “Anne”--was the Napoleon and Cæsar combined of the coaching\r\nbusiness on the East Anglian roads, and accomplished the remarkable\r\nfeat--remarkable for an innkeeper in the East End of London--of also\r\nowning that crack mail-coach of the West of England Road, the Devonport\r\n“Quicksilver.” As Mrs. Nelson would permit no “e” to her Christian name,\r\nso also she would never hear of her house being called “hotel.” It was, to\r\nthe last, the “Bull Inn”; as you see in the illustration, with Martin’s\r\nwoollen-drapery shop, formerly that of James Johnson, whip-maker, on the\r\none side and that of Lee, the confectioner, on the other. Richard Lee\r\nhimself you perceive standing on the pavement, taking a very keen interest\r\nin the coach emerging from the yard, as he had every reason to do; for he,\r\nlike William Lee, his father before him, was a partner, though not a\r\npublicly acknowledged one, with Mrs. Nelson, and the money he made out of\r\nhis jam tarts he invested, with much profit to himself, in that autocratic\r\nlady’s coaching speculations.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the opening of the Eastern Counties Railway, in 1839, the\r\nbusiness of the “Bull” began to decline, and the house was at length sold\r\nand demolished in 1868.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “BULL INN,” WHITECHAPEL. _From the water-colour drawing\r\nby P. Palfrey._]\r\n\r\nThe journey from the “Bull” ended at the “Great White Horse” at Ipswich, a\r\nhouse that still survives and flourishes on the notice (including even the\r\nabuse) that Dickens gave it. The “Great White Horse” is neither ancient\r\nnor beautiful; but it _is_ great and it _is_ white, for it is built of a\r\npallid kind of brick strongly suggesting under-done pastry, and it is in\r\nthese days the object to which most visitors to Ipswich first turn\r\ntheir attention, whether they are to stay in the house or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOORWAY OF THE “GREAT WHITE HORSE,” IPSWICH.]\r\n\r\nIn the merry days of the road, when this huge caravanserai was built, it\r\nwas justly thought enormous; but it has been left to the present age to\r\nbuild many hotels in town and country capable of containing half-a-dozen\r\nor more hostelries the size of the “Great White Horse,” which by\r\ncomparison with them is as a Shetland pony is to the great hairy-legged\r\ncreatures that still, even in these “horseless” times, haul waggons and\r\nbrewers’ drays.\r\n\r\nEspecially did the bulk of this house strike the imagination of that young\r\nreporter of the London _Morning Chronicle_ who in 1830 was despatched to\r\nIpswich for the purpose of reporting a Parliamentary election. That\r\nreporter was, of course, Dickens. The inn made so great an impression upon\r\nhim that, when he wrote about it in the pages of _Pickwick_, a few years\r\nlater, his description was as exact as though it had been penned on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nIt was not a flattering description. Few more severe things have ever been\r\nsaid of an inn than those Dickens said of the “Great White Horse.” Yet,\r\nsuch is the irony of time and circumstance, the house Dickens so roundly\r\nattacked is now eager, in all its advertisements, to quote the Dickensian\r\nassociation; and the adventures of Mr. Pickwick in the double-bedded room\r\n(now identified with No. 36) of the elderly lady in yellow curl-papers\r\nhave attracted more visitors than the unfavourable notice has turned away.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Great White Horse,’” said Dickens, “is famous in the neighbourhood\r\nin the same degree as a prize ox, or county-paper-chronicled turnip, or\r\nunwieldy pig--for its enormous size. Never were there such labyrinths of\r\nuncarpeted passages, such clusters of mouldy, ill-lighted rooms, such huge\r\nnumbers of small dens for eating or sleeping in, beneath any one roof, as\r\nare collected together between the four walls of the ‘Great White Horse’\r\nat Ipswich.”\r\n\r\nThe house was evidently then an exception to the rule of the “good old\r\ndays,” of comfort and good cheer and plenty of it; for, passing the\r\ncorpulent and insolent waiter, “with a fortnight’s napkin under his arm\r\nand coeval stockings on his legs,” Mr. Pickwick entered only to find the\r\ndining-room “a large, badly furnished apartment, with a dirty grate, in\r\nwhich a small fire was making a wretched attempt to be cheerful, but was\r\nfast sinking beneath the dispiriting influence of the place. After the\r\nlapse of an hour, a bit of fish and a steak were served up to the\r\ntravellers,” who then, ordering “a bottle of the worst possible port wine,\r\nat the highest possible price, for the good of the house, drank brandy and\r\nwater for their own.”\r\n\r\nI may here mention the singular parallel in Besant and Rice’s novel, _The\r\nSeamy Side_, where, in Chapter XXVIII., you will find Gilbert Yorke going\r\nto the hotel at Lulworth, in Dorset, and there ordering, like another Will\r\nWaterproof, “for the good of the house,” “a pint of port” after dinner.\r\nHe, we are told, could not drink “the ardent port of country inns,” and\r\ntherefore “he poured the contents of the bottle into a pot of mignonette\r\nin the window.... The flowers waggled their heads sadly and then drooped\r\nand died,” as of course, being notoriously total abstainers, they could\r\nnot choose but do. But it was unfair, alike to the port and the plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GREAT WHITE HORSE,” IPSWICH.]\r\n\r\nHow changed the times since those when Mr. Pickwick stayed at the “Great\r\nWhite Horse!” We read how, after his unpleasant adventure with the lady in\r\nthe yellow curl-papers, he “stood alone, in an open passage, in the middle\r\nof the night, half dressed,” and in perfect darkness, with the\r\nuncomfortable knowledge that, if he tried to find his own bedroom by\r\nturning the handles of each one in succession “he stood every chance of\r\nbeing shot at, and perhaps killed, by some wakeful traveller.” No one in a\r\nsimilar position would have that fear now: and even American guests,\r\ncommonly supposed to “go heeled,” _i.e._ to carry an armoury of\r\nsix-shooters about them, do not invariably sleep with their\r\nshooting-irons under their pillows.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the “Great White Horse” is much the same as when Dickens\r\nsaw it, “in the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand side of the way.”\r\nStill over the pillared portico trots the effigy of the Great White Horse\r\nhimself, “a stone statue of some rampacious animal, with flowing mane and\r\ntail, distantly resembling an insane cart-horse”; but the old courtyard\r\nhas in modern times been roofed in with glass, and is now a something\r\npartaking in equal parts of winter-garden, smoking-lounge, and bar.\r\n\r\nReturning again to London from Ipswich, Mr. Pickwick, giving up his\r\nlodgings in Goswell Road with the treacherous Mrs. Bardell, took up his\r\nabode in “very good old-fashioned and comfortable quarters, to wit, the\r\n‘George and Vulture’ Tavern and Hotel, George Yard, Lombard Street.”\r\n\r\nOne may no longer stay at the “George and Vulture,” and indeed, if one\r\nmight, I do not know that any one would choose, for after business hours,\r\nand on Sundays and holidays, the modern George Yard, now entirely hemmed\r\nin with the enormous buildings of banks and insurance-companies, is a\r\ndismally deserted and forbidding place. The sunlight only by dint of great\r\nendeavour comes at a particular hour slanting down to one side of the\r\nstony courtyard, and the air is close and stale. But on days of business,\r\nand in the hours of business, in the continual stream of passers-by, you\r\ndo not notice these things. Many of those whom you see in George Yard\r\ndisappear, a little mysteriously it seems, in an obscure doorway, tucked\r\naway in an angle. It might, in most likelihood, be a bank to which they\r\nenter; but, as a sheer matter of fact, it is the “George and Vulture”: in\r\nthese days one of the most famous of City chop-houses.\r\n\r\nI have plumbed the depths of depravity in chops, and have found them often\r\nnaturally hard, tasteless, and greasily fat; or if not naturally depraved,\r\nthe wicked incapacity of those who cook them has in some magic way\r\nexorcised their every virtue. It matters little to you whether your chop\r\nbe innately uneatable, or whether it has acquired that defect in the\r\ncooking: the net result is that you go hungry.\r\n\r\nAt the “George and Vulture,” as before noted, you may not stay--or “hang\r\nout,” as it was suggested by Bob Sawyer that Mr. Pickwick did--but there\r\nyou do nowadays find chops of the best, cooked to perfection on the grill,\r\nand may eat off old-world pewter plates and, to complete the ideality of\r\nthe performance, drink ale out of pewter tankards; all in the company of a\r\ncrowded roomful of hungry City men, and in a very Babel of talk. And, ah\r\nme! where does the proprietor get that perfect port?\r\n\r\nBetween Chapters XXVI. and XXXIV. we have a perfect constellation--or\r\nrather, a species of cloudy Milky Way--of inns, nebulous, undefined; but\r\nin Chapter XXXV. we find Mr. Pickwick, on his way to Bath, waiting for the\r\ncoach in the travellers’-room of the “White Horse Cellar,” Piccadilly,\r\na very brilliant star of an inn, indeed, in its day; but rather a\r\nmigratory one, for in the coaching age it was removed from its original\r\nsite at the corner of Arlington Street, where the Ritz Hotel stands now,\r\nto the opposite side of the road, at the corner of Albemarle Street. There\r\nit remained until 1884, when the old house was pulled down and the present\r\n“Albemarle” built in its stead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “WHITE HART,” BATH.]\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was “twenty minutes too early” for the half-past seven\r\no’clock in the morning coach, and so, leaving Sam Weller single-handedly\r\nto contend with the seven or eight porters who had flung themselves upon\r\nthe luggage, he and his friends went for shelter to “the\r\ntravellers’-room--the last resource of human dejection”--railways in\r\ngeneral and the waiting-rooms of Clapham Junction in especial not having\r\nat that time come into existence, to plunge mankind into deeper abysms of\r\nmelancholia.\r\n\r\n“The travellers’-room at the ‘White Horse Cellar’ is, of course,\r\nuncomfortable; it would be no travellers’-room if it were not. It is the\r\nright-hand parlour, into which an aspiring kitchen fireplace appears to\r\nhave walked, accompanied by a rebellious poker, tongs, and shovel. It is\r\ndivided into boxes, for the solitary confinement of travellers, and is\r\nfurnished with a clock, a looking-glass, and a live waiter: which latter\r\narticle is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses, in a corner of the\r\napartment.”\r\n\r\nSo now we know what the primeval ancestor of the Railway Waiting-room,\r\nwith its advertisements of cheap excursions to places to which you do not\r\nwant to go, and its battered Bible on the table was like, and it seems\r\npretty clear that, whatever the travellers’-room of a coaching inn might\r\nhave been, its present representative is a degenerate.\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV. sees Mr. Pickwick and his friends arrived at Bath and duly\r\ninstalled in “their private sitting-rooms at the ‘White Hart’ Hotel,\r\nopposite the great Pump-room, where the waiters, from their costume, might\r\nbe mistaken for Westminster boys, only they destroy the illusion by\r\nbehaving themselves much better.”\r\n\r\nUntil its last day, which came in 1864, the great “White Hart,” owned by\r\nthe Moses Pickwick from whose name Dickens probably derived that of the\r\nimmortal Samuel, maintained the ceremonial manners of an earlier age, and\r\nhabited its waiters in knee-breeches and silk stockings, while the\r\nchambermaids wore muslin caps. The Grand Pump-room Hotel now stands on the\r\nsite of the “White Hart,” and the well-modelled effigy of the White Hart\r\nhimself, seen in the illustration of the old coaching inn, has been\r\ntransferred to a mere public-house of the same name in the slummy suburb\r\nof Widcombe.\r\n\r\nRound the corner from Queen Square, Bath, is the mean street where Dickens\r\npilgrims may gaze upon the “Beaufort Arms,” the mean little public-house\r\nidentified, on a very slender thread, with the “greengrocer’s shop” to\r\nwhich Sam Weller was invited to the footmen’s “swarry.” The identification\r\nhangs chiefly by the circumstance that it is known to have been the\r\nparticular meeting-place of the Bath footmen, just as the “Running\r\nFootman” in Hay Hill, London, is even at this day the chosen house of call\r\nfor the men-servants around Berkeley Square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGN OF THE “WHITE HART,” BATH.]\r\n\r\nThe “Royal Hotel,” whence Mr. Winkle fled by branch coach to Bristol, is\r\nnot to be found, and the “Bush” at Bristol itself is a thing of the past.\r\nIt stood in Corn Street, and was swept out of existence in 1864, the\r\nWiltshire Bank now standing on the site of it; but how busy a place it was\r\nin Pickwickian days let the old picture of coaches arriving and departing\r\neloquently tell.\r\n\r\nThe inns of the succeeding chapters--the tavern (unnamed) at Clifton, the\r\n“Farringdon Hotel,” the “Fox-under-the-Hill,” overlooking the river from\r\nIvy Bridge Lane in the Strand, the “New Hotel,” Serjeant’s Inn Coffee\r\nHouse, and Horn’s Coffee House--are merely given passing mention, and it\r\nis only in Chapter XLVI. that we come to closer touch with actualities, in\r\nthe arrest of Mrs. Bardell in the tea-gardens of the “Spaniards” inn,\r\nHampstead Heath. The earwiggy arbours of that Cockney resort are still\r\ngreatly frequented on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays.\r\n\r\nA very modest and comparatively little-known Pickwickian house is the\r\n“Bell,” Berkeley Heath, on the dull, flat high-road between Bristol and\r\nGloucester, unaltered since the day when Mr. Pickwick set forth by\r\npost-chaise with Mr. Bob Sawyer and his fellow-roysterer, Ben Allen, from\r\nthe “Bush” at Bristol for Birmingham. Here they had lunch, as the present\r\nsign-board of the inn, gravely and with a quaint inaccuracy, informs us:\r\ninsisting that it was “Charles Dickens and party” who so honoured the\r\n“Bell.” They had come only nineteen miles, and without any exertion on\r\ntheir own part, yet when they changed horses here, at half-past eleven\r\na.m., Bob Sawyer found it necessary to dine, to enable them “to bear up\r\nagainst the fatigue.”\r\n\r\n“‘Quite impossible!’ said Mr. Pickwick, himself no mean trencherman.\r\n\r\n“‘So it is,’ rejoined Bob; ‘lunch is the very thing. Hallo, you sir! Lunch\r\nfor three, directly, and keep the horses back for a quarter of an hour.\r\nTell them to put everything they have cold on the table, and some bottled\r\nale, and let us taste your very best Madeira.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “BUSH,” BRISTOL.]\r\n\r\nThose were truly marvellous times. All the way from Bristol those three\r\nhad been drinking milk-punch, and had emptied a case-bottle of it, and we\r\nmay be quite sure (although it is not stated) that they made havoc of a\r\nprodigious breakfast before they started; Yet they did “very great\r\njustice” to that lunch, and when they set off again the case-bottle was\r\nfilled with “the best substitute for milk-punch that could be procured on\r\nso short a notice.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THE BELL,” BERKELEY HEATH.]\r\n\r\n“At the ‘Hop-Pole’ at Tewkesbury they stopped to dine; upon which occasion\r\nthere was more bottled ale, with some more Madeira, and some port besides;\r\nand here the case-bottle was replenished for the fourth time.” Therefore,\r\nit is evident that, twice on the twenty-four miles between Berkeley Heath\r\nand Tewkesbury, they had a re-fill.\r\n\r\nWe do not find Gloucester mentioned, although it must have been passed on\r\nthe way; but, under those circumstances, we are by no means surprised.\r\n\r\nThe “Hop Pole” at Tewkesbury is still a “going concern,” and, with the\r\nadjoining gabled and timbered houses, is a notable landmark in the High\r\nStreet. Nowadays it proudly displays a tablet recording its Pickwickian\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nA drunken sleep (for it could have been nothing else) composed those two\r\n“insides,” Mr. Pickwick and Ben Allen, on the way to Birmingham, while,\r\nthanks in part to the fresh air, Sam Weller and Bob Sawyer “sang duets in\r\nthe dickey.” By the time they were nearing Birmingham it was quite dark.\r\nThe postboy drove them to the “Old Royal Hotel,” where an order for that\r\nsurely very necessary thing, soda-water, having been given, the waiter\r\n“imperceptibly melted away”: a proceeding that, paradoxically enough,\r\nseems to have been initiated by the house itself, years before; for it was\r\nabout 1825, two years before the Pickwickians are represented as starting\r\non their travels, that the “Old Royal” was transferred from Temple Row to\r\nNew Street, and there became the “New Royal.”\r\n\r\nThe inn at Coventry, at which the post-horses were changed on the journey\r\nfrom Birmingham, is unnamed, unhonoured, and unsung; but very famous, in\r\nthe Pickwickian way, is the “Saracen’s Head” at Towcester, or “Toaster,”\r\nas the townsfolk call it, even though its identity is a little obscured by\r\nthe sign having been exchanged for that of the “Pomfret Arms.” The change,\r\nwhich was actually made in April, 1831, was a complimentary allusion to\r\nthe Earls of Pomfret, who before the title became extinct, in 1867,\r\nresided at the neighbouring park of Easton Neston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “HOP-POLE,” TEWKESBURY.]\r\n\r\nIn all essentials the inn remains the same as the old coaching hostelry to\r\nwhich Mr. Pickwick and his friends drove up in their post-chaise, after\r\nthe long wet journey from Coventry. As “at the end of each stage it rained\r\nharder than it had done at the beginning,” Mr. Pickwick wisely decided to\r\nhalt here.\r\n\r\n“There’s beds here,” reported Sam; “everything’s clean and comfortable.\r\nWery good little dinner, sir, they can get ready in half an hour--pair of\r\nfowls, sir, and a weal cutlet; French beans, ’taturs, tarts, and tidiness.\r\nYou’d better stop vere you are, sir, if I might recommend.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “POMFRET ARMS,” TOWCESTER: FORMERLY THE “SARACEN’S\r\nHEAD.”]\r\n\r\nAt the moment of this earnest colloquy in the rain the landlord of the\r\n“Saracen’s Head” appeared, “to confirm Mr. Weller’s statement relative to\r\nthe accommodations of the establishment, and to back his entreaties with a\r\nvariety of dismal conjectures regarding the state of the roads, the doubt\r\nof fresh horses being to be had at the next stage, the dead certainty of\r\nits raining all night, the equally mortal certainty of its clearing up in\r\nthe morning, and other topics of inducement familiar to innkeepers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YARD OF THE “POMFRET ARMS.”]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pickwick decided to stay, “the landlord smiled his delight” and\r\nissued orders to the waiter. “Lights in the Sun, John; make up the fire;\r\nthe gentlemen are wet!” he cried anxiously, although, doubtless, if the\r\ngentlemen had gone forward they might have been drowned, for all he cared.\r\n\r\nAnd so the scene changed from the rain-washed road to a cosy room, with a\r\nwaiter laying the cloth for dinner, a cheerful fire burning, and the\r\ntables lit with wax candles. “Everything looked (as everything always does\r\nin all decent English inns) as if the travellers had been expected, and\r\ntheir comforts prepared for days beforehand.”\r\n\r\nUpon this charming picture of ease at one’s inn descended the atrabilious\r\nrival editors of _The Eatanswill Gazette_ and _The Eatanswill\r\nIndependent_, the organs respectively of “blue” and “buff” shades of\r\npolitical opinion. Pott of the _Gazette_, and Slurk of the _Independent_\r\neach found his rival sheet lying on the tables of the inn; but what either\r\nof those editors or those newspapers were doing here in Northamptonshire\r\n(Eatanswill being a far-distant East Anglian town, by general consensus of\r\nopinion identified with Ipswich) is one of those occasional lapses from\r\nconsistency that in _Pickwick_ give the modern commentator and annotator\r\nfood for speculation.\r\n\r\nWhen the inn was closed for the night Slurk retired to the kitchen to\r\ndrink his rum and water by the fire, and to enjoy the bitter-sweet luxury\r\nof sneering at the rival print; but, as it happened, Mr. Pickwick’s party,\r\naccompanied by Pott, also adjourned to the kitchen to smoke a cigar or so\r\nbefore bed. How ancient, by the way, seems that custom! Does any guest,\r\nanywhere, in these times of smoking-rooms, withdraw to the kitchen to\r\nsmoke his cigar, pipe, or cigarette?\r\n\r\nHow the rival editors--the “unmitigated viper” and the “ungrammatical\r\ntwaddler”--met and presently came from oblique taunts to direct abuse of\r\none another, and thence to a fight, let the pages of _The Pickwick\r\nPapers_ tell. For my part, I refuse to believe that there were ever such\r\njournalists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “OSBORNE’S HOTEL, ADELPHI.”]\r\n\r\nWhat was once the kitchen of the “Saracen’s Head” is now the bar-parlour\r\nof the “Pomfret Arms”; but otherwise the house is the same as when Dickens\r\nknew it. The somewhat severe frontage loses in a black-and-white drawing\r\nits principal charm, for it is built of the golden-brown local ferruginous\r\nsandstone of the district.\r\n\r\nThe journey to London is carried abruptly from Towcester to its ending at\r\nthe “George and Vulture”; and with “Osborne’s Hotel in the Adelphi” the\r\nlast inn to be identified in the closing scenes of _Pickwick_ is reached.\r\nThat staid family hotel, still existing in John Street, and now known as\r\nthe “Adelphi,” is associated with the flight of Emily Wardle and\r\nSnodgrass. The sign of the last public-house in the story, “an excellent\r\nhouse near Shooter’s Hill,” to which Mr. Tony Weller, no longer “of the\r\nBell Savage,” retired, is not disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDICKENSIAN INNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge Dickens possessed of inns, old and new, was, as already\r\nsaid, remarkable. His education in this sort began early. From his early\r\nyears in London, at the blacking factory, when he sampled the “genuine\r\nstunning” at the “Red Lion,” Parliament Street, through his experiences as\r\na reporter of election speeches in the provinces, when long coach journeys\r\npresented a constant succession of inns and posting-houses, circumstances\r\nmade him familiar with every variety of house of public entertainment; and\r\nafterwards, as novelist, he enlarged upon inns from choice, realising as\r\nhe did that in those days romance had its chief home at them.\r\n\r\nDickensian inns, as treated of in this chapter, are those houses, other\r\nthan the inns of _Pickwick_, associated with Dickens personally, or\r\nthrough his novels. It is hardly necessary to add at this day, that either\r\nassociation is assiduously cultivated, and that we have almost come to\r\nthat dizzy edge of things where, in addition to the inns Dickens is\r\ncertainly known to have mentioned or visited, those he would have treated\r\nof or stayed at, had he known better, will come under review, together\r\nwith a further paper on the inns he did not immortalise, and why not.\r\n\r\nWhen Dickens first visited Bath, in May, 1835, as a reporter, he stayed,\r\naccording to tradition, at the humble “Saracen’s Head,” in Broad Street,\r\nand there also, according to tradition, he was assigned a humble room in\r\nan outhouse down the yard. A dozen times, if we may believe a former\r\nlandlady’s story, he went with lighted candle across the windy yard to his\r\nbedroom; a dozen times, the wind puffed it out, and he never uttered a\r\nmild d----! It is a remarkable instance of restraint, likely to remain in\r\nthe recollection of any landlady.\r\n\r\nThe “Saracen’s Head” cherishes these more or less authentic recollections,\r\nand you are shown, not only the room, but the “very bedstead”--a hoary\r\nfour-poster--upon which Dickens slept; and if you are very good and\r\nreverent, and sufficiently abase yourself before the spirit of the place,\r\nyou will be allowed to drink out of the very mug he is said to have drunk\r\nfrom and sit in the identical chair he is supposed to have sat in; and\r\naccordingly, when Dickensians visit Bath they sit in the chair and drink\r\nfrom the mug to the immortal memory, and do not commonly stop to consider\r\nthis marvellous thing: that the humble, unknown reporter of 1835 should be\r\nidentified by the innkeeper of that era with the novelist who only became\r\nfamous two years later.\r\n\r\nGoing by the Glasgow Mail to Yorkshire in January, 1838, in company with\r\n“Phiz,” Dickens acquired the local colour for _Nicholas Nickleby_. We\r\nhear, in that story, how the coach carrying Nicholas, Squeers, and the\r\nschoolboys down to Dotheboys Hall, dined at “Eaton Slocomb,” by which\r\nEaton Socon, fifty-five miles from London, on the Great North Road, is\r\nindicated. There, in that picturesque village among the flats of\r\nHuntingdonshire, still stands the charming little “White Horse” inn, which\r\nin those days, with the long-vanished “Cock,” divided the coaching\r\nbusiness on that stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “WHITE HORSE,” EATON SOCON.]\r\n\r\nGrantham does not figure largely in the story, in whose pages the actual\r\ncoach journey is lightly dismissed. There we find merely a mention of the\r\n“George” as “one of the best inns in England”; but in his private\r\ncorrespondence he refers to that house, enthusiastically, as “the very\r\nbest inn I have ever put up at”: and Dickens, as we well know, was a\r\nfinished connoisseur of inns.\r\n\r\nThe “George” at Grantham is typically Georgian: four-square, red-bricked\r\nand prim. It replaced a fine mediæval building, burnt down in 1780; but\r\nwhat it lacks in beauty it does, according to the testimony of innumerable\r\ntravellers, make up for in comfort. At the sign of the “George,” says one,\r\n“you had a cleaner cloth, brighter plate, higher-polished glass, and a\r\nbrisker fire, with more prompt attention and civility, than at most other\r\nplaces.”\r\n\r\nFrom Grantham to Greta Bridge was, in coaching days, one day’s journey.\r\nThere the traveller of to-day finds a quiet hamlet on the banks of the\r\nromantic Greta, but in that era it was a busy spot on the main coaching\r\nroute, with two large and prosperous inns: the “George” and the “New Inn.”\r\nThe “New Inn,” where Dickens stayed, is now a farmhouse, “Thorpe Grange”\r\nby name; while the “George,” standing by the bold and picturesque bridge,\r\nhas itself retired from public life, and is now known as “the Square.”\r\nUnder that name the great, unlovely building is divided up into tenements\r\nfor three or four different families.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GEORGE,” GRETA BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nFrom Greta Bridge Dickens proceeded to Barnard Castle, where he and Phiz\r\nstayed, as a centre whence to explore Bowes, that bleak and stony-faced\r\nlittle town where he found “Dotheboys Hall,” and made it and Shaw, the\r\nschoolmaster, the centre of his romance. The “Unicorn” inn at Bowes is\r\npointed out as the place where the novelist met Shaw, afterwards drawing\r\nthe character of “Squeers” from his peculiarities. The rights and the\r\nwrongs of the Yorkshire schools, and the indictment of them that Dickens\r\ndrew, form still a vexed question. Local opinion is by no means altogether\r\namiably disposed towards the memory of Dickens in this matter; and\r\nalthough those schools were gravely mismanaged, we must not lose sight of\r\nthe fact that this expedition undertaken by Dickens was largely a\r\npilgrimage of passion, in which he looked to find scandals, and did so\r\nfind them. To what extent, for the sake of his “novel with a purpose,” he\r\ndotted the i’s and crossed the t’s of the wrongs he found must ever be a\r\nsubject for controversy.\r\n\r\nThe course of _Nicholas Nickleby_ brings us, in Chapter XXII., to the long\r\ntramp undertaken by Nicholas and Smike from London to Portsmouth, on “a\r\ncold, dry, foggy morning in early spring.” They made Godalming the first\r\nnight, and “bargained for two humble beds.” The next evening saw them well\r\nbeyond Petersfield, at a point fifty-eight miles from London, where the\r\nhumble “Coach and Horses” inn stands by the wayside, and is perhaps the\r\ninn referred to by Dickens. The matter is doubtful, because, although the\r\nstory was written in 1838, when the existing road along the shoulder of\r\nthe downs at this point had been constructed, with the present “Coach and\r\nHorses” beside it, replacing the older inn and the original track that\r\nstill goes winding obscurely along in the bottom, it is extremely likely\r\nthat Dickens described the spot from his childish memories of years\r\nbefore, when, as a little boy, he had been brought up the road with the\r\nDickens family, on their removal from Landport. At that time the way was\r\nalong the hollow, where the “Bottom” inn, or “Gravel Hill” inn, then\r\nstood, in receipt of custom. The house stands yet, and is now a\r\ngamekeeper’s cottage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “COACH AND HORSES,” NEAR PETERSFIELD.]\r\n\r\nWhichever of the two houses we choose, the identity of the spot is\r\nunassailable, because, although in the story it is described as twelve\r\nmiles from Portsmouth, and is really thirteen, no other inn exists or\r\nexisted for miles on either side. The bleak and barren scene is\r\nadmirably drawn: “Onward they kept with steady purpose, and entered at\r\nlength upon a wide and spacious tract of downs, with every variety of\r\nlittle hill and plain to change their verdant surface. Here, there shot up\r\nalmost perpendicularly into the sky a height so steep, as to be hardly\r\naccessible to any but the sheep and goats that fed upon its sides, and\r\nthere stood a huge mound of green, sloping and tapering off so delicately,\r\nand merging so gently into the level ground, that you could scarce define\r\nits limits. Hills swelling above each other, and undulations shapely and\r\nuncouth, smooth and rugged, graceful and grotesque, thrown negligently\r\nside by side, bounded the view in each direction; while frequently, with\r\nunexpected noise, there uprose from the ground a flight of crows, who,\r\ncawing and wheeling round the nearest hills, as if uncertain of their\r\ncourse, suddenly poised themselves upon the wing and skimmed down the long\r\nvista of some opening valley with the speed of very light itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “BOTTOM” INN.]\r\n\r\n“By degrees the prospect receded more and more on either hand, and as they\r\nhad been shut out from rich and extensive scenery, so they emerged once\r\nagain upon the open country. The knowledge that they were drawing near\r\ntheir place of destination gave them fresh courage to proceed; but the way\r\nhad been difficult and they had loitered on the road, and Smike was tired!\r\nThus twilight had already closed in, when they turned off the path to the\r\ndoor of a road-side inn, yet twelve miles short of Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n“‘Twelve miles,’ said Nicholas, leaning with both hands on his stick, and\r\nlooking doubtfully at Smike.\r\n\r\n“‘Twelve long miles,’ repeated the landlord.\r\n\r\n“‘Is it a good road?’ inquired Nicholas.\r\n\r\n“‘Very bad,’ said the landlord. As, of course, being a landlord, he would\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n“‘I want to get on,’ observed Nicholas, hesitating. ‘I scarcely know what\r\nto do.’\r\n\r\n“‘Don’t let me influence you,’ rejoined the landlord. ‘I wouldn’t go on if\r\nit was me.’”\r\n\r\nAnd so here they stayed the night, much to their advantage.\r\n\r\nThe “handsome hotel,” “between Park Lane and Bond Street,” referred to in\r\nChapter XXXII. of _Nicholas Nickleby_, cannot be identified: there are,\r\nand long have been, so many handsome hotels in that region. It was in the\r\ncoffee-room of this establishment that Nicholas encountered Sir Mulberry\r\nHawk; and the description of the affair brings back the memory of a state\r\nof things long past. The “Coffee-room” with its boxes partitioned off, no\r\nlonger exists; there are no such things as those boxes anywhere now,\r\nexcept perhaps in some old-fashioned “eating-houses.” But in that period\r\nof which Dickens wrote, the “coffee-room” of an hotel was an institution\r\nnot so very long before copied from the then dead or fast-expiring “Coffee\r\nHouses” of the eighteenth century: once--in the days before clubs--the\r\nmeeting-places of wits and business men. The Coffee House had been the\r\nclub of its own particular age, and as there are nowadays clubs for every\r\nclass and all professions, so in that period there were special Coffee\r\nHouses for individual groups of people, where they read the papers and\r\nlearned the gossip of their circle.\r\n\r\nInns and hotels copied the institution of a public refreshment-room that\r\nwould nowadays be styled the restaurant, and transferred the name of\r\n“Coffee-room,” without specifically supplying the coffee; which, to be\r\nsure, was a beverage fast growing out of fashion, in favour of wines,\r\nbeer, and brandy and water. No one drank whisky then.\r\n\r\nFashions in nomenclature linger long, and even now in old-established inns\r\nand hotels, the Coffee-room still exists, but has paradoxically come to\r\nmean a public combined dining- and sitting-room for private guests, in\r\ncontradistinction from the Commercial-room, to which commercial travellers\r\nresort, at a recognised lower tariff.\r\n\r\nThere are inns also in _Oliver Twist_; not inns essential to the story,\r\nnor in themselves prepossessing, but, in the case of the “Coach and\r\nHorses” at Isleworth, remarkably well observed when we consider that the\r\nreference is only in passing. Indeed, the topographical accuracy of\r\nDickens, where he is wishful to be accurate, is astonishing. The literary\r\npilgrim sets out to follow the routes he indicates, possibly doubtful if\r\nhe will find the places mentioned. There, however, they are (if modern\r\nalterations have not removed them), for Dickens apparently visited the\r\nscenes and from one eagle glance described them with all the accuracy of a\r\nguide-book.\r\n\r\nThus, Bill Sikes and Oliver, trudging from London to Chertsey, where the\r\nburglary was to be committed, and occasionally getting a lift on the way,\r\nare set down from a cart at the end of Brentford. At length they came to a\r\npublic-house called the “Coach and Horses”; a little way beyond which\r\nanother road appeared to turn off. And here the cart stopped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “COACH AND HORSES,” ISLEWORTH.]\r\n\r\nOne finds the “Coach and Horses,” sure enough, at the point where\r\nBrentford ends and Isleworth begins, by the entrance to Sion Park, and\r\nnear the spot where the road branches off to the left. The “Coach and\r\nHorses” is not a picturesque inn. It is a huge, four-square lump of a\r\nplace, and wears, indeed, rather a dour and forbidding aspect. It is\r\nunquestionably the house of which Dickens speaks, and was built certainly\r\nnot later than the dawn of the nineteenth century. In these latter days\r\nthe road here has been rendered somewhat more urban by the advent of the\r\nelectric tramway; but I have in my sketch of the scene taken the artistic\r\nlicence of omitting that twentieth-century development, and, to add an air\r\nof verisimilitude, have represented Sikes and Oliver in the act of\r\napproaching. The left-hand road beyond leads to a right-hand road, as in\r\nthe story, and this in due course to Hampton.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting Dickensian inn, outside the pages of _Pickwick_, is\r\nthe “Maypole,” in _Barnaby Rudge_.\r\n\r\nThere never existed upon this earth an inn so picturesque as that drawn,\r\nentirely from his imagination, by Cattermole, to represent the “Maypole.”\r\nYou may seek even among the old mansions of England, and find nothing more\r\nbaronial. The actual “Maypole”--when found--is a sad disappointment to\r\nthose who have cherished the Cattermole ideal, and there is wrath and\r\nindignation among pilgrims from over-seas when they come to it. This,\r\nalthough natural enough, is an injustice to this real original, which is\r\none of the most picturesque old inns now to be found, and is not properly\r\nto be made little of because it cannot fit an impossible artistic fantasy.\r\n\r\nI have hinted above that the “Maypole” requires some effort to find, and\r\nthat is true enough, even in these days when the England of Dickens has\r\nbeen so plentifully elucidated and mapped out and sorted over. The prime\r\ncause of this incertitude and boggling is that there really is a “Maypole”\r\ninn, but at that very different place, Chigwell Row, two miles distant\r\nfrom Chigwell and the “King’s Head.” Many years ago, the late James Payn\r\nwrote an amusing account--as to whose entire truth we cannot vouch--of his\r\ntaking a party of enthusiastic American ladies in search of this scene of\r\n_Barnaby Rudge_. They drove about the forest seeking (such was their\r\nignorance) the “Maypole,” and not the “King’s Head”; and found it, in a\r\nlow and ugly beerhouse from which drunken beanfeasters waved inviting pots\r\nof beer. Eventually they left the forest convinced that the inn Dickens\r\ndescribed was a sheer myth.\r\n\r\nIf the “King’s Head” of fact--“such a delicious old inn opposite the\r\nchurchyard,” as Dickens wrote of it to Forster--is not so wonderful an old\r\nhouse as the “Maypole” of fiction and of Cattermole’s picturesque fancy,\r\nwe must, at any rate, excuse the artist, who was under the necessity of\r\nworking up to the fervid description of it with which the story begins:\r\n“An old building, with more gable-ends than a lazy man would care to count\r\non a sunny day; huge zig-zag chimneys, out of which it seemed as though\r\neven smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic\r\nshapes, imparted to it in its tortuous progress; and vast stables, gloomy,\r\nruinous, and empty. The place was said to have been built in the days\r\nof King Henry the Eighth; and there, was a legend, not only that Queen\r\nElizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion, to\r\nwit, in a certain oak-panelled room with a deep bay-window, but that next\r\nmorning, while standing upon a mounting-block before the door, with one\r\nfoot in the stirrup, the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and\r\ncuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “KING’S HEAD,” CHIGWELL, THE “MAYPOLE” OF _BARNABY\r\nRUDGE_.]\r\n\r\nPassing the references to sunken and uneven floors and old diamond-paned\r\nlattices, with another to an “ancient porch, quaintly and grotesquely\r\ncarved,” which does not exist, we come to a description of dark red\r\nbricks, grown yellow with age, decayed timbers, and ivy wrapping the\r\ntime-worn walls,--all figments of the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe real “Maypole,” identified with the “King’s Head” at Chigwell, in\r\nEpping Forest, is not the leastest littlest bit like that. The laziest man\r\non the hottest day could easily count its gables, which number three large\r\nones[17] and a small would-be-a-gable-if-it-could, that looks as though it\r\nwere blighted in its youth and had never grown to maturity. The front of\r\nthe house is not of red brick, and never was: the present white plaster\r\nface being a survival of its early years; while the front of the\r\nground-floor is weather-boarded.\r\n\r\nBut it is a delightful old house, in a situation equally delightful,\r\nstanding opposite the thickly wooded old churchyard of Chigwell, just as\r\ndescribed in the story; the sign--a portrait head of Charles the\r\nFirst--projecting from an iron bracket, and the upper storeys of the inn\r\nthemselves set forward, on old carved oak beams and brackets. There is no\r\nsign of decay or neglect about the “King’s Head.”\r\n\r\nIn _Martin Chuzzlewit_ the literary annotator and professor of\r\ntopographical exegesis finds an interesting problem of the first\r\ndimensions in the question, “Where was the ‘Blue Dragon’ of that story\r\nsituated?” It is a matter which, it is to be feared, will never be\r\nthreshed out to the satisfaction of all seekers after truth. “You all are\r\nright and all are wrong,” as the chameleon is supposed to have said when\r\nhe heard disputants quarrelling as to whether he was green or pink; and\r\nthen turned blue, to confound them. But the chameleon, in this instance,\r\nis no more: and we who have opinions may continue, without fear, to hold\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWell, then: in the third chapter of _Martin Chuzzlewit_ we are\r\nparticularly introduced to an inn, the subject of an earlier allusion in\r\nthose pages, the “Blue Dragon,” near Salisbury. In what direction it lay\r\nfrom that cathedral city we are not told--whether north, south, east, or\r\nwest; and we only infer from incidents of the story, in which the inn is\r\nbrought into relation with the London mail and coaching in general, that\r\nthe “Blue Dragon” was at Amesbury, eight miles to the north of Salisbury,\r\nby which route the famous “Quicksilver” Exeter mail to and from London\r\nwent, in the old coaching days, avoiding Salisbury altogether. The course\r\nof the narrative, the situation of an old mansion on the Wilsford road\r\nnear Amesbury--generally pointed out as Pecksniff’s home--and the position\r\nof Amesbury, all seem at the first blush to point to that fine old inn,\r\nthe “George” at Amesbury, being the original of the “Blue Dragon”; and\r\nthis old inn certainly was not only a coaching-house, but was what another\r\nclaimant to the honour of being the real true original of the “Blue\r\nDragon”--the “Green Dragon” at Alderbury--could never have been: a\r\nhostelry with accommodation sufficient for postchaise travellers such as\r\nold Martin Chuzzlewit and Mary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GREEN DRAGON,” ALDERBURY.]\r\n\r\nThe “George” at Amesbury is a house of considerable size and architectural\r\ncharacter, and its beauties might fitly have employed the pencils of\r\nPecksniff’s pupils, had that great and good man condescended to notice\r\nanything less stupendous than cathedrals, castles, and Houses of\r\nParliament. As it was, however, the architectural studies of his young\r\nfriends were made to contemplate nothing meaner than “elevations of\r\nSalisbury Cathedral from every possible point of sight,” and lesser things\r\nwere passed contemptuously by. (Chap. I.)\r\n\r\nThe “George,” after the fine old church--that church in which Tom Pinch\r\nplayed the organ--is the chief ornament of Amesbury, and that it was the\r\ninn meant by Dickens when he wrote _Martin Chuzzlewit_ is in the village\r\nan article of faith which no visitor dare controvert or dispute in any way\r\non the spot. Like the small boys who do not say “Yah!” and are not\r\ncourageous enough to make grimaces until safely out of arm’s reach, we\r\nonly dare dispassionately discuss the _pros_ and _cons_ when out of the\r\nplace. It were not possible on the spot to object, “Yes, but,” and then\r\nproceed to argue the point with the landlord, who confidently shows you\r\nold Martin Chuzzlewit’s bedroom and a room with a descent of one step\r\ninside, instead of the “two steps on the inside so exquisitely unexpected\r\nthat strangers, despite the most elaborate cautioning, usually dived in,\r\nhead first, as into a plunging-bath.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GEORGE,” AMESBURY.]\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, like many another literary landmark, the “Blue Dragon”\r\nin _Martin Chuzzlewit_ is a composite picture, combining the features of\r\nboth the “George” at Amesbury, eight miles to the north of Salisbury, and\r\nthose of the “Green Dragon” at Alderbury, three miles to the south. Nay,\r\nthere were not so long ago at Alderbury those who remembered the\r\npicture-sign of the “Green Dragon” there, which doubtless Dickens saw in\r\nhis wanderings around the neighbourhood. “A faded and an ancient dragon he\r\nwas; and many a wintry storm of rain, snow, sleet, and hail had changed\r\nhis colour from a gaudy blue to a faint lack-lustre shade of grey. But\r\nthere he hung; rearing in a state of monstrous imbecility on his\r\nhind-legs; waxing with every month that passed so much more dim and\r\nshapeless that as you gazed at him on one side of the sign-board it seemed\r\nas if he must be gradually melting through it and coming out upon the\r\nother.” (Chap. III.)\r\n\r\nThe sign has long since been replaced by the commonplace lettering of the\r\npresent day, but it was then, in Dickens’s own words, “a certain Dragon\r\nwho swung and creaked complainingly before the village ale-house door,” a\r\nphrase which at once shows us that if by the “Blue Dragon” of the story\r\nthe “George” at Amesbury was intended to be described, that was a\r\nderogatory description of the fine old hostelry.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the chief point upon which the validity of this claim of\r\nthe “Green Dragon” at Alderbury must rest. Dickens distinctly alludes to\r\nthe “Blue Dragon” as a “village ale-house,” and such it is and has ever\r\nbeen; while to the “George” at Amesbury that description cannot even now\r\njustly apply, and certainly it could never in coaching times, when in the\r\nheyday of its prosperity, have been so fobbed off with such a phrase.\r\nMoreover, we will do well to bear in mind that old Chuzzlewit and his\r\ncompanion did not put up at the inn--this “village ale-house”--from\r\nchoice. The gentleman was “taken ill upon the road,” and had to seek the\r\nfirst house that offered.\r\n\r\nThose curious in the byways of Dickens topography will find Alderbury\r\nthree miles from Salisbury, on the left-hand side of the Southampton road.\r\nHalf a mile from it, on the other side of the way, stands “St. Mary’s\r\nGrange,” a red-brick building in a mixed Georgian and Gothic style, built\r\nby Pugin, and locally reputed to be the original of Mr. Pecksniff’s\r\nresidence: a circumstance which may well give us pause and opportunity for\r\nconsidering whether Dickens had that distinguished architect in his mind\r\nwhen creating the character of his holy humbug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE “GREEN DRAGON,” ALDERBURY.]\r\n\r\nThe “Green Dragon,” which we have thus shown to have, at the least of it,\r\nas good a title as the “George” at Amesbury to be considered the original\r\nof the house kept by the genial Mrs. Lupin, friend of Tom Pinch, Mark\r\nTapley, and Martin Chuzzlewit in particular, and of her fellow-creatures\r\nin general, does not directly face the highway, but is set back from it at\r\nan angle, behind a little patch of grass. It is pre-eminently rustic, and\r\nis even more ancient than the casual wayfarer, judging merely from its\r\nexterior, would suppose; for a fine fifteenth-century carved stone\r\nfireplace in what is now the bar parlour bears witness to an existence\r\nalmost mediæval. It is a beautiful, though dilapidated, work of Gothic art\r\nof the Early Tudor period, ornamented with boldly carved crockets,\r\nheraldic roses, and shields of arms, and is worthy of inspection for\r\nitself alone, quite irrespective of its literary interest.\r\n\r\nA London inn intimately associated with _Martin Chuzzlewit_ finally\r\ndisappeared in the early part of 1904, when the last vestiges of the\r\n“Black Bull,” Holborn, were demolished. The “Black Bull,” in common with\r\nthe numerous other old inns of Holborn, in these last few years all swept\r\naway, stood just outside the City of London, and was originally, like its\r\nneighbours, established for the accommodation of those travellers who, in\r\nthe Middle Ages, arrived too late in the evening to enter the City. At\r\nsundown the gates of the walled City of London were closed, and, unless\r\nthe traveller was a very privileged person indeed, he found no entrance\r\nuntil the next morning, and was obliged to put up at one of the many\r\nhostelries that sprang up outside and found their account in the multitude\r\nof such laggards by the way. The old “Black Bull,” after many alterations,\r\nwas rebuilt in a very commonplace style in 1825, and in later years it\r\nbecame a merely sordid public-house, with an unlovely pile of peculiarly\r\ngrim “model” dwellings in the courtyard. In spite of those later changes,\r\nthe great plaster effigy of the Black Bull himself, with a golden girdle\r\nabout his middle, remained on his bracket over the first floor window\r\nuntil the house was pulled down, May 18th, 1904.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGN OF THE “BLACK BULL,” HOLBORN.]\r\n\r\nAn amusing story belongs to that sign, for it was, in 1826, the subject of\r\na struggle between the landlord, one Gardiner, on the one side and the\r\nCity authorities on the other. The Commissioner of Sewers served a notice\r\nupon Gardiner, requiring him to take his bull down, but the landlord was\r\nobstinate, and refused to do anything of the kind, whereupon the\r\nCommissioner assembled a storming-party of over fifty men, with ladders\r\nand tackle for removing the objectionably large and weighty effigy. No\r\nsooner, however, had the enemy begun their preparations, when, to their\r\nastonishment, and to that of the assembled crowds, the bull soared\r\nmajestically and steadily to what Mrs. Gamp would doubtless have called\r\nthe “parapidge.” Arrived there he displayed a flag with the bold legend,\r\n“I don’t intrude now.”\r\n\r\nSome arrangement was evidently arrived at, for the bull occupied its\r\noriginal place, above the first-floor window over the archway, for the\r\nwhole of the seventy-eight years between 1826 and 1904.\r\n\r\nThe house is referred to in _Martin Chuzzlewit_ as the “Bull,” and is the\r\nplace to which Sairey Gamp repaired from Kingsgate Street to relieve Betsy\r\nPrig in the nursing of the mysterious patient. She found it “a little\r\ndull, but not so bad as might be,” and was “glad to see a parapidge, in\r\ncase of fire, and lots of roofs and chimley-pots to walk upon.”\r\n\r\nThere are no greatly outstanding inns to be found in _Bleak House_, the\r\n“Dedlock Arms,” really the “Sondes Arms” at Rockingham, being merely\r\nmentioned. On the other hand, in _David Copperfield_ we find the “Plough”\r\nat Blundeston mentioned, and that hotel at Yarmouth whence the London\r\ncoach started: only unfortunately it is not possible to identify it,\r\neither with the “Crown and Anchor,” the “Angel,” or the “Star.”\r\n\r\nIn Parliament Street, Westminster, until 1899, stood the “Red Lion”\r\npublic-house, identified with the place where David Copperfield (Chapter\r\nIX.) called for the glass of the “genuine stunning.” The incident was one\r\nof Dickens’s own youthful experiences, and is therefore to be taken,\r\ntogether with much else in that story, as autobiography.\r\n\r\n“I was such a child, and so little, that frequently when I went into the\r\nbar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter, to moisten\r\nwhat I had had for dinner, they were afraid to give it me. I remember, one\r\nhot evening, I went into the bar of a public-house, and said to the\r\nlandlord:\r\n\r\n“‘What is your best--your _very best_ ale a glass?’ For it was a special\r\noccasion, I don’t know what. It may have been my birthday.\r\n\r\n“‘Twopence-halfpenny,’ says the landlord, ‘is the price of the Genuine\r\nStunning ale.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then,’ says I, producing the money, ‘just draw me a glass of the Genuine\r\nStunning, if you please, with a good head to it.’\r\n\r\n“The landlord looked at me in return over the bar, from head to foot, with\r\na strange smile on his face; and instead of drawing the beer, looked round\r\nthe screen, and said something to his wife. She came out from behind it,\r\nwith her work in her hand, and joined him in surveying me.... They served\r\nme with the ale, though I suspect it was not the Genuine Stunning; and the\r\nlandlord’s wife, opening the little half-door of the bar, and bending\r\ndown, gave me my money back, and gave me a kiss that was half-admiring and\r\nhalf compassionate, but all womanly and good, I am sure.”\r\n\r\nThe “Blue Boar” in Whitechapel is referred to, and the “County Inn” at\r\nCanterbury, identified with the “Fountain,” where Mr. Dick slept. The\r\n“little inn” in that same city, where Mr. Micawber stayed, and might have\r\nsaid--but didn’t--that he “resided, in short, ‘put up,’” there, is\r\nclaimed to be the “Sun,” but how, of all the little inns of\r\nCanterbury--and there are many--the “Sun” should so decisively claim the\r\nhonour is beyond the wit of man to tell. It is an old, old inn that,\r\nrather mistakenly, calls itself an “hotel,” and the peaked, red-tiled\r\nroof, the projecting upper storey, bracketed out upon ancient timbers, are\r\nevidence enough that it was in being many centuries before the foreign\r\nword “hotel” became acclimatised in this country. One may dine, or lunch,\r\nor tea at the “Sun,” in the ghostly company of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, but\r\nalthough warm culinary scents may be noticed with satisfaction by the\r\nhungry pilgrim, he misses the “flabby perspiration on the walls,”\r\nmentioned in the book. True, it is a feature readily spared.\r\n\r\nIn the _Uncommercial Traveller_ a reference to the “Crispin and\r\nCrispianus,” at Strood, is found. It is a humble, weather-boarded inn,\r\nwhose age might be very great or comparatively recent. But, whatever the\r\nage of the present house, there has long been an inn of the name on this\r\nspot, the sign being referred back to St. Crispin’s Day, October 25th,\r\n1415, when Agincourt was fought and won. The sign is, however, doubtless\r\nfar older than that, and probably was one of the very many religious\r\ninn-signs designed to attract the custom of thirsty wayfarers to Becket’s\r\nshrine.\r\n\r\nThe brothers Crispin and Crispian were members of a noble family in\r\nancient Rome, who, professing Christianity, fled to Gaul and supported\r\nthemselves by shoemaking in the town of Troyes. They suffered martyrdom\r\nat Soissons, in A.D. 287. The sanctity and benevolence of St. Crispin are\r\nsaid to have been so great that he would steal leather as material for\r\nshoes for the poor; for which, did he live in our times, he would still be\r\nmartyred--in a police-court, to the tune of several months’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CRISPIN AND CRISPIANUS,” STROOD.]\r\n\r\nThe picture-sign of the “Crispin and Crispianus” is said to be a copy of a\r\npainting in the church of St. Pantaléon at Troyes, and certainly (but\r\nchiefly because of much varnish, and the dust and grime of the road) looks\r\nvery Old-Masterish. The two saints, seated uncomfortably close to one\r\nanother, and looking very sheepish, appear to be cutting out a piece of\r\nleather to the order of an interesting and gigantic pirate.\r\n\r\nA mysterious incident occurred in 1830 at this house, in the death of a\r\nman who had acted as ostler at the coaching inns of Rochester and Chatham,\r\nand had afterwards tramped the country as a hawker. He lay here dying, in\r\nan upper room, and told the doctor who was called to him the almost\r\nincredible story that he was really Charles Parrott Hanger, Earl of\r\nColeraine, and not “Charley Roberts,” the name he had usually been known\r\nby for twenty years. Although his life had been so squalid and apparently\r\npoverty-stricken, he left £1,000 to his son, Charles Henry Hanger.\r\n\r\nThe “Crispin and Crispianus,” in common with most other erstwhile humble\r\ninns, has experienced a social levelling-up since the time when Dickens\r\nmentioned it as a house where tramping tinkers and itinerant clock-makers,\r\ncoming into Strood “yonder, by the blasted ash,” might lie. In these\r\ntimes, when the blasted dust of the Dover road is the most noticeable\r\nfeature, and a half-century has effected all manner of wonderful changes,\r\ntramps and their kin find no harbourage at the old house, whose invitation\r\nto cyclists and amateur photographers sufficiently emphasises its improved\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\nIn _Great Expectations_ is found a notice of the “Cross Keys,” Wood\r\nStreet, Cheapside, a coaching inn abolished in the ’70’s; but it is merely\r\nan incidental reference, on the occasion of Pip’s coming to London by\r\ncoach from Rochester. The inns of that story are, indeed, not well seen,\r\nand although that little boarded inn at Cooling, the “Horseshoe and\r\nCastle,” is identified as the “Three Jolly Bargemen” of the tale, you can\r\nfind in those pages no illuminating descriptive phrase on which to put\r\nyour finger and say, conscientiously, “Found!”\r\n\r\nOnly at the close of the story, where, in Chapter LIV., Pip is\r\nendeavouring to smuggle the convict, Magwitch, out of the country, down\r\nthe Thames, do we find an inn easily identified. That is the melancholy\r\nwaterside house below Gravesend, standing solitary on a raised bank of\r\nstones, where Pip lands: “It was a dirty place enough, and I daresay not\r\nunknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good fire in the\r\nkitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various liquors to\r\ndrink. Also there were two double-bedded rooms--‘such as they were,’ the\r\nlandlord said.” Outside there was mud: mud and slimy stones, and rotten,\r\nslimy stakes sticking out of the water, and a grey outlook across the\r\nbroad river.\r\n\r\nThis describes the actual “Ship and Lobster” tavern, on the shore at\r\nDenton, below Gravesend, to which you come past the tramway terminus, down\r\na slummy street chiefly remarkable for grit and broken bottles, then\r\nacross the railway and the canal and on to the riverside where, in midst\r\nof the prevalent grittiness that is now the most outstanding natural\r\nfeature, stands the inn, in company with the office of an alarming person\r\nwho styles himself “Explosive Lighterman,” at Denton Wharf.\r\n\r\nThere are even fewer inns to be found in _Our Mutual Friend_, where,\r\nalthough the “Red Lion” at Henley is said to be the original of the\r\nup-river inn to whose lawn Lizzie drags the half-drowned Wrayburn, we are\r\nnot really sure that Henley actually is indicated. That mention of a lawn\r\ndoes not suffice: many riverside inns have lawns. In short, the edge of\r\nDickens’s appreciation of inns was growing blunted, and he took less\r\ndelight, as he grew older, in describing their peculiarities. His whole\r\nmethod of story-telling was changed. Instead of the sprightly fancy and\r\nodd turns of observation that once fell spontaneously from him, he at last\r\ncame to laboriously construct and polish the action and conversation of a\r\nnovel, leaving in comparative neglect those side-lights upon localities\r\nthat help to give most of his writings a permanent value.\r\n\r\nApart from the novels, we have many inns associated with Dickens by\r\ntradition and in his tours and racily descriptive letters; and there, at\r\nany rate, we find him, when not overweighted with the more than ever\r\nelaborated and melodramatic character of his plots, just as full of\r\nquaint, fanciful, and cheerful description as ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SHIP AND LOBSTER.”]\r\n\r\nHis tours began early. So far back as the autumn of 1838 Dickens and Phiz\r\ntook holiday in the midlands, coming at last to Shrewsbury, where they\r\nstayed at the “Lion,” or rather in what was at that time an annexe of the\r\n“Lion,” and has long since become a private house. Writing to his elder\r\ndaughter, Dickens vividly described this place: “We have the strangest\r\nlittle rooms (sitting-room and two bedrooms together) the ceilings of\r\nwhich I can touch with my hand. The windows bulge out over the street, as\r\nif they were little stern windows in a ship. And a door opens out of the\r\nsitting-room on to a little open gallery with plants in it, where one\r\nleans over a queer old rail.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kitton[18] states: “This quaint establishment, alas! has been\r\nmodernised (if not entirely rebuilt) since those days, and presents\r\nnothing of the picturesqueness that attracted the author of _Pickwick_.”\r\nBut that is by no means the case. It stands exactly as it did, except that\r\nsince the business of the “Lion” has decreased, it no longer forms a part\r\nof that great hostelry.[19] The blocked-up communicating doors between the\r\ntwo buildings may still be seen on the staircase of the “Lion,” and the\r\nlittle house does still bulge over the pavement and closely resemble the\r\nstern of an old man-o’-war.\r\n\r\n_The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices_, a light-hearted account of a tour\r\ntaken by Dickens and Wilkie Collins in 1857, begins with the travellers\r\nbeing set down by the express at Carlisle, and ends, after many wanderings\r\nin Cumberland and Lancashire, at Doncaster. It is largely an account of\r\ninns, including the “Queen’s Head,” Hesket Newmarket, in Cumberland,\r\nnow a private house; and the “King’s Arms,” Market Street, Lancaster,\r\npulled down in 1880. The “King’s Arms” was, from the exterior, commonplace\r\npersonified, but within doors you were surrounded by ancient oaken\r\nstaircases, mahogany panelling, and, according to Dickens, mystic old\r\nservitors in black; and doubtless were so encompassed with mysteries and\r\nforebodings that when you retired to rest--not being able in such a house\r\nto merely “go to bed”--in one of the catafalque-like four-posters, you\r\nimmediately leapt between the sheets and drew the clothes over your head,\r\nin fear of ghosts; dreaming uncomfortably that you were dead and lying in\r\nstate, and waking with a terrific start in the morning, at the coming of\r\nthe hot water and the tap at the door, with the dreadful impression that\r\nthe Day of Judgment was come and you summoned to account before the Most\r\nHigh. These being the most remarkable features of the “King’s Arms” at\r\nLancaster, it is perhaps not altogether strange that the house was at\r\nlength demolished and replaced by an uninteresting modern hotel, with no\r\nassociations--and no ghosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “LION,” SHREWSBURY, SHOWING THE ANNEXE ADJOINING, WHERE\r\nDICKENS STAYED.]\r\n\r\nA weird story was told of the old inn, by which it seems that a young\r\nbride was poisoned there, in a room pointed out as the “Bride’s Chamber,”\r\nthe criminal being duly hanged at Lancaster gaol. In memory of this\r\ntraditional romance, it was the custom to serve the incoming guests with a\r\npiece of bride-cake. They might also, if they liked, sleep in the very\r\nidentical ancient black oak four-poster, in the room where the tragedy\r\ntook place; but, although there was sufficient eagerness to see it in\r\ndaylight, no very great competition was ever observed among guests for the\r\nhonour of occupying--we will not say sleeping in--that tragical couch.\r\nDickens himself, however, lay in it, and seems to have slept sufficiently\r\nwell; greatly, we may suppose, to his disappointment.\r\n\r\nAmong those inns that no Dickensian neglects is “Jack Straw’s Castle,” on\r\nHampstead Heath, a house as commonplace and as little like any castle of\r\nromance as it is possible to conceive. How else could it be? It was built\r\nas a private residence in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and,\r\nwith various additions and alterations, each one vulgarising the house a\r\nstep further, it now is little better than a London “public.” The\r\nDickensian association is here a personal one, and somewhat thin at that.\r\nIt does not form a scene in any one of his stories, but was a house he\r\nsometimes affected in his suburban walks. In 1837 we find him writing to\r\nthat “harbitrary gent,” Forster, inviting him to a winter’s walk across\r\nthe Heath, and adding, “I knows a good ’ous there where we can have a\r\nred-hot chop for dinner and a glass of good wine.” “This,” says Forster,\r\n“led to our first experience of ‘Jack Straw’s Castle,’ memorable for many\r\nhappy meetings in coming years.”\r\n\r\nHow do myths germinate and sprout? Are they invented, or do they spring\r\nspontaneously into being? Two myths cling to “Jack Straw’s Castle”: the\r\none that it stands upon the site of a fort thrown up by that peasant\r\nleader in the reign of Richard the Second; the other that Dickens not only\r\nvisited the house, but often stayed there, a chair called “Dickens’s Easy\r\nChair” being shown in what is represented as having been his bedroom. The\r\nGreat Dickens Legend is now well on its way, and the inns “where he\r\nstayed” will at no distant day match the apocryphal “Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nBedrooms” that amaze the historical student with their number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “JACK STRAW’S CASTLE.”]\r\n\r\nThe “Jack Straw” legend is old, although by no means so old as the house.\r\nIt is probable that the house was built on the site of some ancient\r\nearthwork, but that might have been either much older or much later than\r\nJack Straw; and in any case history has nothing to say about the spot.\r\n\r\nThe first reference to the inn by its present name appears to be in the\r\nreport of a horse-race on the Heath in 1748. In the same year an allusion\r\nto it in Richardson’s _Clarissa Harlowe_ speaks merely of “The Castle.”\r\n\r\nThe illustration printed here shows the bow-window of a good many years\r\nago, a somewhat picturesque feature now abolished in favour of an ugly\r\nmodern front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHIGHWAYMEN’S INNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, in a certain sense, all inns were anciently\r\nhand-in-glove with the highwaymen. No hostelry so respectable that it\r\ncould safely give warranty for its ostlers without-doors and its servants\r\nwithin. Mine host might be above suspicion, but not all his dependants;\r\nand the gentlemen of the high toby commonly learnt from the staffs of the\r\ninns what manner of guests lay there, what their saddle-bags or valises\r\nheld, and whither they were bound. No wealthy traveller, coming to his inn\r\novernight in those far-distant times, with pistols fully loaded and\r\nprimed, dared set forth again without narrowly examining his weapons,\r\nwhose charges, he would be not unlikely to discover, had mysteriously been\r\ndrawn since his arrival, and perhaps his sword fixed by some unknown\r\nagency immovably in its scabbard. You figure such an one, too hurried at\r\nhis starting to look closely into his equipment, come unexpectedly in the\r\npresence of a highwayman, and, his armoury thus raided, falling an easy\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nThese dangers of the wayside inns, and even of the greater and more\r\nresponsible hostelries in considerable towns, were so well known that\r\nliterature, from the time of Queen Elizabeth until that of the earlier\r\nGeorges, is full of them. Indeed, that singular person, John Clavel,\r\nworthless and dissolute sprig of an ancient and respectable landed family\r\nin Dorsetshire, especially recounts them in his very serious pamphlet, the\r\n_Recantation of an Ill-led Life_, written from his prison-cell in the\r\nKing’s Bench in 1627, and printed in the following year. He inscribes\r\nhimself “Gentleman” on his title-page, and in his “discouerie of the\r\nHigh-way Law,” written in verse, proceeds to “round upon” his late\r\nconfederates in the spirit of the sneak. All this was in the hope of a\r\npardon, which he apparently obtained, for he was at liberty, and still\r\nrenouncing his former evil courses, in 1634.\r\n\r\nOne of the important heads of his pamphlet, addressed to travellers, is\r\n“How a Traveller should carry himself at his inn.” His advice reads\r\nnowadays like that supererogatory kind generally known as “teaching your\r\ngrandmother to suck eggs”; but when we consider closely that in those\r\ntimes knowledge was not widely diffused, and that to most people a journey\r\nwas a rare and toilsome experience, to be undertaken only at long\r\nintervals and long afterwards talked of, John Clavel’s directions to\r\nwayfarers may have been really valuable. His pamphlet must, for some\r\nreason or another, have been largely purchased, for three editions of it\r\nare known.\r\n\r\nThus he warns the traveller come to his inn:\r\n\r\n  Oft in your clothier’s and your grazier’s inn,\r\n  You shall have chamberlains that there have been\r\n  Plac’d purposely by thieves, or else consenting\r\n  By their large bribes, and by their often tempting,\r\n  That mark your purses drawn, and give a guess\r\n  What’s there, within a little, more or less.\r\n  Then will they grip your cloak-bags, feel their weight:\r\n  There’s likewise in mine host sometimes deceit:\r\n  If it be left in charge with him all night,\r\n  Unto his roaring guests he gives a light,\r\n  Who spend full thrice as much in wine and beer\r\n  As you in those and all your other cheer.\r\n\r\nBut the classic and most outstanding literary reference to these dark\r\nfeatures of old-time innkeeping is found in Shakespeare, in the First Part\r\nof _King Henry the Fourth_. The scene is Rochester: an inn yard. Enter a\r\ncarrier, with a lantern in his hand, in the hours before daybreak.\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ Heigh ho! An’t be not four by the day, I’ll be hanged:\r\n    Charles’ wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse not packed.\r\n    What, ostler!\r\n\r\n    _Ost._ [_Within._] Anon, anon.\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ I pr’ythee, Tom, beat Cut’s saddle, put a few flocks in the\r\n    point; the poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.\r\n\r\n    _Enter another_ Carrier.\r\n\r\n    _2 Car._ Pease and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the\r\n    next way to give poor jades the bots: this house is turned upside\r\n    down, since Robin ostler died.\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ Poor fellow! never joyed since the price of oats rose; it was\r\n    the death of him.\r\n\r\n    _2 Car._ I think this be the most villainous house in all London road\r\n    for fleas: I am stung like a tench.\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ Like a tench? by the mass, there is ne’er a king in\r\n    Christendom could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.\r\n\r\n    _2 Car._ Why, they will allow us ne’er a jordan, and then we leak in\r\n    your chimney; and your chamber lie breeds fleas like a loach.\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ What, ostler! come away, and be hanged, come away.\r\n\r\n    _2 Car._ I have a gammon of bacon, and two razes of ginger, to be\r\n    delivered as far as Charing-cross.\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ Odsbody! the turkies in my pannier are quite starved.--What,\r\n    ostler!--A plague on thee! hast thou never an eye in thy head? canst\r\n    not hear? An ’twere not as good a deed as drink, to break the pate of\r\n    thee, I am a very villain.--Come, and be hanged:--Hast no faith in\r\n    thee?\r\n\r\n    _Enter_ Gadshill.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ Good morrow, carriers. What’s o’clock?\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ I think it be two o’clock.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ I pr’ythee, lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding in the\r\n    stable.\r\n\r\n    _1 Car._ Nay, soft, I pray ye; I know a trick worth two of that,\r\n    i’faith.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ I pr’ythee, lend me thine.\r\n\r\n    _2 Car._ Ay, when? canst tell?--Lend me thy lantern, quoth a?--marry,\r\n    I’ll see thee hanged first.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?\r\n\r\n    _2 Car._ Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant\r\n    thee.--Come, neighbour Mugs, we’ll call up the gentlemen; they will\r\n    along with company, for they have great charge.\r\n\r\n    [_Exeunt_ Carriers.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ What, ho! chamberlain!\r\n\r\n    _Cham._ [_Within._] At hand, quoth pick-purse.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ That’s even as fair as--at hand, quoth the chamberlain: for\r\n    thou variest no more from picking of purses, than giving direction\r\n    doth from labouring; thou lay’st the plot how.\r\n\r\n    _Enter_ Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    _Cham._ Good morrow, master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you\r\n    yesternight: There’s a franklin in the wild of Kent, hath brought\r\n    three hundred marks with him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of\r\n    his company, last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one that hath\r\n    abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already, and call\r\n    for eggs and butter: They will away presently.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ Sirrah, if they meet not with saint Nicholas’ clerks, I’ll\r\n    give thee this neck.\r\n\r\n    _Cham._ No, I’ll none of it: I pr’ythee, keep that for the hangman;\r\n    for, I know, thou worship’st saint Nicholas as truly as a man of\r\n    falsehood may.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang, I’ll make a\r\n    fat pair of gallows: for, if I hang, old sir John hangs with me; and,\r\n    thou knowest, he’s no starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that\r\n    thou dreamest not of, the which, for sport sake, are content to do the\r\n    profession some grace; that would, if matters should be looked into,\r\n    for their own credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no foot\r\n    land-rakers, no long-staff, six-penny strikers; none of these mad,\r\n    mustachio purple-hued malt-worms: but with nobility, and tranquillity;\r\n    burgomasters, and great oneyers; such as can hold in; such as will\r\n    strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink\r\n    sooner than pray: And yet I lie; for they pray continually to their\r\n    saint, the commonwealth; or, rather, not pray to her, but prey on her;\r\n    for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.\r\n\r\n    _Cham._ What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold out water in\r\n    foul way?\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We steal as in\r\n    a castle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk\r\n    invisible.\r\n\r\n    _Cham._ Nay, by my faith; I think you are more beholden to the night,\r\n    than to fern-seed, for your walking invisible.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as\r\n    I am a true man.\r\n\r\n    _Cham._ Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.\r\n\r\n    _Gads._ Go to; _Homo_ is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler\r\n    bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.\r\n\r\n    [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\nThere was never any lack of evidence as to the complicity of innkeepers in\r\nthe doings of highwaymen. When John Nevison and his associates were tried\r\nat York in 1684, for highway robbery, their headquarters were stated, on\r\noath, to have been at the “Talbot,” Newark, where the landlord was\r\n“supposed” to be cognisant of their business, and the ostler was known to\r\nhave been in their pay. Nevison, it should be said, was the man who really\r\ndid ride horseback to York in one day. He achieved the feat, and\r\nestablished the celebrated _alibi_ by it, in 1676, before Turpin (who\r\nnever did anything of the kind) was born. But at last, in 1684, the end\r\ncame. He was arrested at the still existing “Three Houses” inn, at Sandal,\r\nnear Wakefield, and being found guilty, was executed on Knavesmire, York,\r\non May 4th, in that year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “THREE HOUSES INN,” SANDAL.]\r\n\r\nA rather startling sidelight on these old-time aspects of inns was the\r\ndiscovery, in 1903, of an ancient and long unsuspected staircase at the\r\n“Bush,” Farnham. In the course of extensive repairs the builders came upon\r\na staircase that had once led up among the rafters of the oldest part of\r\nthe house; and it was presumed by those learned in the history of that\r\npicturesque Surrey town that, by connivance of the landlord at some\r\ndistant period, it was used by highwaymen as a hiding-place when hard\r\npressed. Near by the stairway a number of old coins were found, but most\r\nof them were so worn and obliterated, that it was an impossibility to read\r\nthe date or any other part of the inscription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CROWN” INN, HEMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nThe most famous highwayman of all time--famous in a quite arbitrary and\r\nirrational way, for he was at the bottom, rather than at the head of his\r\nprofession--is Dick Turpin, who was born at Hempstead, in Essex, in 1705,\r\nat the “Crown” inn, his father being landlord of that hostelry, which\r\nstill faces the road, and looks on to the lane that winds up to the\r\nvillage church. There is much that is appropriate, if you do but consider\r\nit, in one who is to be a highwayman and finally to be hanged, being born\r\nin a place called Hempstead; but this by the way. The ring of old trees\r\nplanted on an ancient circular earthwork beside the lane opposite his\r\nbirthplace (and seen in the illustration) is known locally as Turpin’s\r\nRing.\r\n\r\nThe youthful Turpin began his career as apprentice to a Whitechapel\r\nbutcher, and while still serving his indentures started his course of low\r\nvillainy by stealing some cattle from a Plaistow farmer. Fleeing from\r\njustice, he joined a band of smugglers and sheep-stealers who had their\r\nhead-quarters in Epping Forest, and their store-house in a cave in the\r\nneighbourhood of Chingford; a spot now occupied by a singularly\r\ncommonplace modern beer-house, like a brick box, named from this romantic\r\ncircumstance, “Turpin’s Cave.”\r\n\r\nA reward of fifty guineas was offered for the arrest of this precious\r\ngang, but it was not until the amount was doubled that things grew\r\ndangerous, and the unholy brotherhood was broken up. Turpin then took to\r\nscouring the roads singly, until he met with Tom King, with whom he\r\nentered into a partnership that lasted until he accidentally shot King\r\ndead when aiming at a police-officer who was endeavouring to arrest both,\r\nat the “Red Lion,” Whitechapel, in 1737.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “TURPIN’S CAVE,” NEAR CHINGFORD.]\r\n\r\nHis partner dead, Turpin, finding London too hot to hold him, removed\r\nquietly to Welton, a Yorkshire village ten miles from Beverley, where he\r\nset up as a gentleman horse-dealer, Palmer by name. He had not long been\r\ndomiciled in those parts before the farmers and others began to lose their\r\nhorses in a most unaccountable way, and so they might have continued to\r\nlose and not discover the hand that spoiled them, but for the coarse and\r\nbrutal nature that was Turpin’s undoing. Returning from a shooting\r\nexcursion in which he had apparently not succeeded in shooting anything,\r\nthe self-styled “Palmer” wantonly shot one of his neighbours’ fowls. The\r\nneighbour remonstrated with him and probably suggested that it required a\r\ngood shot to bring down game but that the domestic rooster was an easy\r\nmark for a poor sportsman, whereupon the “gentlemanly horse-dealer”\r\nthreatened to serve him in the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GREEN DRAGON,” WELTON.]\r\n\r\nOne did not, even in 1739, threaten people with impunity and shot-guns.\r\nSomething unpleasant generally resulted; and “Palmer” was accordingly\r\narrested at the “Green Dragon” inn, Welton, on a charge of brawling; being\r\nafterwards haled before the magistrates assembled at Petty Sessions at\r\nBeverley, where, as he could produce no friends to speak on his behalf,\r\nhe was put back for further inquiries. Those inquiries resulted in his\r\nbeing charged with stealing a black mare, blind of an eye, off Heckington\r\nCommon. In fiction--and especially in fiction as practised by Harrison\r\nAinsworth--Turpin at this point would in some way have sprung upon the\r\nback of Black Bess, come ready to hand from nowhere in particular, and\r\nwould have been carried off triumphantly from the midst of his “enemies”;\r\nbut these things do not happen in real life, and he was, instead, lodged\r\nin York Castle. Thence he wrote from his dungeon cell a letter to his\r\nbrother at Hempstead, imploring him in some way to cook him up a\r\ncharacter. This letter was not prepaid, and the brother, not recognising\r\nthe handwriting, refused to pay the sixpence for it demanded by the Post\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “THREE MAGPIES,” SIPSON GREEN.]\r\n\r\nSee now from what trivial incidents great issues hang. The village\r\npostmaster chanced to be identical with the schoolmaster who had taught\r\nTurpin to write. He was a man of public spirit, and travelled to York and\r\nidentified the prisoner there as the man who had been “wanted” for many\r\ncrimes. It was on April 17th, 1739, in the thirty-fourth year of his age,\r\nthat Dick Turpin was hanged on Knavesmire, York, and since then he has\r\nbecome very much of a hero: perhaps the sorriest, the most sordid and\r\nabsolutely commonplace scoundrel that was ever raised on so undeserved a\r\npedestal.\r\n\r\nNo district was more affected by highwaymen in the old days than Hounslow\r\nHeath, and the fork of the roads, where the two great highways to Bath and\r\nExeter set out upon their several courses at the west end of what was once\r\nHounslow village and is now Hounslow town, used in those brave old days to\r\nbe decorated with a permanent gibbet, rarely without its scarecrow\r\noccupant, in the shape of some tattered robber, strung up as a warning to\r\nhis fellows. Prominent amongst many stories that belong to this stretch of\r\ncountry is that of the murder of Mr. Mellish, brother of the then Member\r\nof Parliament for Grimsby, on a night in 1798, when returning from a day’s\r\nhunting with the King’s Buckhounds in Windsor Forest. The carriage in\r\nwhich his party were seated was passing the lonely old beerhouse called\r\nthe “Old Magpies,” at Sipson Green, at half-past eight, when it was\r\nattacked by three footpads. One held the horses’ heads, while the other\r\ntwo guarded the windows, firing a shot through them, to terrify the\r\noccupants. No resistance was offered to the demand for money, and purses\r\nand bank-notes were handed over, as a matter of course. Then the carriage\r\nwas allowed to proceed, a parting shot being fired after it. That shot\r\nstruck the unfortunate Mr. Mellish in the forehead, and he died shortly\r\nafter being removed to an upper room in an adjoining inn, still standing,\r\nthe “Three Magpies.” The older and more humble inn, heavily thatched and\r\nwith a beetle-browed and sinister look, where the footpads had been\r\ndrinking before the attack, makes a picture, in the melodramatic sort, on\r\nthe Bath Road, even to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “OLD MAGPIES.”]\r\n\r\nA very curious and authentic relic of those old times is found in that\r\nsecluded little inn, the “Green Man,” a most innocent-looking, white,\r\nplaster-faced house that seems a very bower of rustic simplicity and\r\nguilelessness, standing at Hatton--“Hatton-in-the-Hinterland” as one feels\r\ntempted to style it--a rural hamlet, “the world forgetting, by the world\r\nforgot,” tucked away in the beautiful orchard country between the angle\r\nformed by those branching Bath and Exeter roads westward of Hounslow town.\r\nIt is to-day, as I have said, a beautiful district of orchards, where the\r\npink and white of the apple-blossom delights the eye in spring, and the\r\ndaffodil grows. There is an old rustic pound at Hatton, and in front of\r\nthe “Green Man” an idyllic pond where ducks quack and dive; and everything\r\nseems as pure and unspotted from the world as those white Aylesbury ducks\r\nthemselves would appear to be. But Hatton is a Place with a Past, and the\r\n“Green Man” not so green as you might suppose. For here spread the lonely\r\nand sinister Heath, in days gone by, and at the “Green Man” the highwaymen\r\nof the district, who all cherished the most magnificent thirsts, and would\r\nnot readily barter them away, foregathered in the intervals between\r\noffering wayfarers an unwelcome choice between rendering money or life.\r\nSometimes the Bow Street runners--so called, in the contrariwise spirit,\r\nbecause they never by any chance ran, unless it might be away--would,\r\ndaring very much indeed, poke inquisitive noses into the “Green Man,” but\r\nthey never found any one more suspicious there than a drunken carter. For\r\nwhy? Because in the little parlour on the left-hand side as you enter,\r\nthere is a veritable highwayman’s hiding-hole at the back of the\r\nold-fashioned grate, filling what was once an old-world chimney-corner.\r\nInto this snug, not to say over-warm and possibly sooty place, one of the\r\nstarlight conveyers of property upon the Heath could creep on emergency\r\nand wait until danger passed off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GREEN MAN,” HATTON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HIGHWAYMAN’S HIDING-HOLE.]\r\n\r\nThat Putney Heath was a favourite resort of the gentry of the horse-pistol\r\nand crape mask is a mere commonplace to the student of these byways of\r\nhistory, and, however little it may be suspected by those who look in\r\ncasually at the “Green Man” that stands on the crest of Putney Hill, where\r\nthe Heath and the Portsmouth Road begin, that house was in the old days\r\nrightly suspect. About it--and no doubt also in it--lurked that bright and\r\nshining light of the craft, Jerry Avershawe, that bold spirit who, after\r\nmaking his name a name of dread, and Putney Heath and Wimbledon Common\r\nplaces to be avoided by all travellers with money and valuables to lose,\r\ndied on the scaffold at Kennington in 1795, in his twenty-second year.\r\n\r\nFootpads, too, frequented the “Green Man”: despicable fellows, who were to\r\nhighwaymen what “German silver” and “American cloth” are to the real\r\narticles. The footpads waited for revellers who had taken too much liquor\r\nand were zig-zagging their unsteady way home, before they dared attack. A\r\ncurious little incident in this sort was enacted in 1773 at the “Green\r\nMan.” Two convivial fellows drinking there had been watched by two\r\nfootpads named William Brown and Joseph Witlock. When the two jolly topers\r\ncame forth and corkscrewed a devious course home-along, Messrs. Brown and\r\nWitlock set upon them and secured the highly desirable booty of twenty\r\nguineas and some snuff-boxes and pen-knives. It was ill gleaning for any\r\nother of the fraternity, after thoroughgoing practitioners like these had\r\ngone over the pockets of the lieges. The smallest involuntary\r\ncontributions were gratefully received, and they condescended even to\r\nrelieve a baker’s boy of his little all, which was little indeed:\r\nconsisting of a silver buckle and some halfpence. It is rather\r\nsatisfactory, after all this, to learn that Messrs. Brown and Witlock were\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\nThe “Green Man” still keeps a stout, bolt-studded door, and the house,\r\nseen across the road from where the large old-fashioned pound for strayed\r\nhorses, donkeys, and cattle stands on the Heath, presents a charming\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThe “Spaniards” inn, that picturesque and picturesquely situated old\r\nhouse, built about 1630, in what was then an extremely lonely situation on\r\nthe roadside between Hampstead and Highgate, stands actually in the parish\r\nof Finchley. It occupies the site of a lodge-entrance into what was once\r\nthe Bishop of London’s great rural park of Finchley, where there stood\r\nuntil quite modern times a toll-gate that took tribute of all wayfarers.\r\nThe odd little toll-house itself is still a feature of the scene, and may\r\nbe noted on the left hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\nHow the “Spaniards” derived its name is rather a matter of conjecture than\r\nof ascertained, sheer, cold-drawn fact. If the generally received version\r\nbe correct, the name should be spelled with an apostrophe “s,” to denote a\r\nsingle individual; for, according to that story, the original lodge was\r\ntaken over by a Spaniard about 1620, and converted into a place of\r\nentertainment for Londoners, who even then had begun to frequent\r\nHampstead and the Heath. The fact that the Spanish Ambassador, Gondomar,\r\nretiring from the danger of plague in the infected air of London, resided\r\nat neighbouring Highgate, 1620-22, may possibly have some bearing upon the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GREEN MAN,” PUTNEY.]\r\n\r\nIt becomes a little difficult to believe in the “Spaniards” being so early\r\na place of popular resort; but, shaming the incredulous, there stands the\r\nold house, visibly old, undoubtedly large and designed for the conduct of\r\na considerable business, and still comparatively lonely. It is also one of\r\nthose very few houses, out of an incredibly large number, which really can\r\nmake out a good claim to have been frequented by Dick Turpin. This spot\r\nwas well within the “Turpin Country,” so to speak, as one speaks of\r\nliterary landmarks; it was included in his “sphere of influence,” as they\r\nsay in international politics; or simply (as a policeman might put it) was\r\n“on his beat.” Turpin has so taken hold of the imagination that you find\r\nlegends of him in the most impossible places, but his real centre of\r\nactivity, before he fled into Yorkshire, was Epping Forest, and a radius\r\nof twenty miles from Chingford just about covers his province.\r\n\r\nIt is only in modern times that the “Spaniards” has been anxious to claim\r\nTurpin. In that hero’s period, and when highwaymen still haunted dark\r\nroads and were hand-in-glove with many innkeepers, the “Spaniards” was no\r\ndoubt just as anxious to disclaim any such association. Thus we do not\r\nfind, in any memoirs of former landlords, “Turpin as I knew Him,” or\r\nanything of that kind. It is a pity, for we are in such a case reduced to\r\naccept legends, and Heaven and the inquirer into these things alone know\r\nwhat lies these legends tell. At the “Spaniards,” however, we accept the\r\ntradition that mine host, throughout a long series of years, had an\r\nexcellent understanding with the whole fraternity of road-agents, and with\r\nTurpin in particular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SPANIARDS,” HAMPSTEAD HEATH.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to this general belief to place one’s faith in the\r\ntruth of the stable attached to the house having been that of Black Bess,\r\nbecause we know that famous mare to have been entirely the figment of\r\nHarrison Ainsworth’s imagination; and the quaint old tower-like\r\ngarden-house seen on the right hand of the accompanying picture of the inn\r\nis itself so picturesquely suggestive of headlong flights and pursuits\r\nthat, whether Turpin _did_ hide in it, or not, it is obviously demanded by\r\nall the canons of the picturesque that he _should_ be made to do so--and\r\naccordingly he is. Thus we read: “This outhouse was a favourite\r\nresting-place for Turpin, and many a time on the late return of the\r\nmarauder has it served as a bedroom. The underground passages that led to\r\nthe inn itself have been filled up, years ago. Formerly, here Dick was\r\nsafe enough. Were the two doors attacked by unpleasant visitors, he dived\r\nthrough the secret trap-door into the underground apartment, there to\r\nawait the departure of the raging officers, or to betake himself to the\r\ninn, if that were clear of attack.”\r\n\r\nOh! those “secret passages” and “underground apartments”! Do we not meet\r\nthem (in legend) everywhere? And have they not invariably been “filled up”\r\nlong ago?\r\n\r\nForty-one years after Turpin had been hanged we find the “Spaniards” in\r\ntouch with actual, unquestionable history. June, 1780, was the time of the\r\n“No Popery Riots” in London, when Newgate was fired by the mob, and half a\r\nmillion pounds’ worth of damage was done to business houses and private\r\nresidences. The Earl of Mansfield’s town house, in Bloomsbury Square, was\r\ndestroyed, and the mob, pleased with their handiwork there, determined to\r\ncomplete their revenge on the obnoxious judge by treating his country\r\nmansion at Caen Wood in the same manner.\r\n\r\nCaen Wood still stands hard by the “Spaniards,” which you must pass in\r\norder to come to it from London. Here the landlord stood, with the tollbar\r\nbehind him, like another Horatius in the gate, and met the rioters as they\r\ncame with pikes and “No Popery” flags, and torches and firelocks,\r\nstreaming along the road. They were an unsuspicious mob, and a thirsty,\r\nand when mine host invited them to partake of his best, free of charge,\r\nand even to wallow in it, if they would, they did not stop to ask the\r\nmotive of such extraordinary generosity, but took him at his word and sat\r\nboozing there until the detachment of Horse Guards, sent up in response to\r\nthe mounted messenger despatched by the landlord, had time to dispose\r\nthemselves in the Caen Wood grounds, and so to overawe their undisciplined\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nA very great deal of the “Spaniards’” picturesqueness is due to the rustic\r\nsetting of narrow lane and tall elms that frames it in, but that story of\r\nthe resourceful landlord and his artful way with those London furies gives\r\nthe house and the scenery a final dramatic touch. You fancy, if you stroll\r\nthat way some June evening, that you see him, in old-fashioned\r\ndress--buckled shoes, worsted stockings, knee-breeches, scrubby\r\nwig--standing in the roadway, tankard in one hand, churchwarden pipe in\r\nthe other, with assumed joviality confronting a rabble in equal parts\r\ndrunk and mad. You see the banner, “No Popery!” you hear the curses\r\nand--without the aid of imagination, for the “Spaniards” is a going\r\nconcern--smell the drink. And presently you hear the gallop of the Horse\r\nGuards and the rattle and jingle of their accoutrements.\r\n\r\nBut you must not by any means come here on Easter Monday or any other\r\noccasion of popular holiday, for amidst such wholesale merry-making\r\nimagination becomes atrophied, and the ghosts of historic drama will not\r\ncondescend to share the stage with twentieth-century comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed and bound by Hazell, Watson & Viney, Ld., London and Aylesbury._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adelphi Hotel, Adelphi, i. 212, 264\r\n\r\n  Ale-stakes, i.

there?”\r\n    “Grenadier.”\r\n  “What d’ye want?”\r\n    “Pot o’ beer.”\r\n  “Where’s yer money?”\r\n    “Haven’t got.”\r\n  “Get away, you drunken sot!”\r\n\r\n[11] A large hotel was also built outside Slough Station, eighteen miles\r\nfrom Paddington, for weary and hungry travellers. Such were the quaint\r\nideas of the early railway directors, who could not forget the\r\nnecessities, the usages and customs of the coaching age, when inns at\r\nshort stages were indispensable. The hotel at Slough was from the first a\r\nfailure, and the building has long been an orphanage.\r\n\r\n[12] Another landlord of the “Tabard”--William Rutter, represented East\r\nGrinstead in Parliament, 1529-1536.\r\n\r\n[13] Vol. II., p. 348.\r\n\r\n[14] For example, the Rev. Dr. Thackeray, late Chaplain of the Hackney\r\nUnion, licensee and active publican of the “Fish and Eels” at Roydon.\r\n\r\n[15] Cf. a lengthy description of the origin of the place-name “Shepherd’s\r\nBush” in the West of London: _The Oxford, Gloucester, and Milford Haven\r\nRoad_, vol. i. pp. 55-57. Also compare the still-existent\r\n“shepherd’s-bush” thorn-trees on West Winch Common, Norfolk.\r\n\r\n[16] For further particulars respecting the “Bull,” see _The Norwich\r\nRoad_, pp. 19-28, and _Stage-coach and Mail in Days of Yore_, vol. i., p.\r\n324; vol. ii., pp. 227, 232-5, 343.\r\n\r\n[17] A newer extension, built in recent years, makes a fourth.\r\n\r\n[18] _The Dickens Country._ By F.
