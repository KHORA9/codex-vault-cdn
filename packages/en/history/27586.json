DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY MARCH 15, 1916\r\n\r\n\r\nOur defeat of Great Britain in the Revolutionary War was conclusive;\r\nthough \"we\" in that case included France, without whose aid the patriots\r\nmust have been defeated. It is not so easy to discover a fund of\r\nmilitary glory in the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nThat was a great war year. Within a few days of the declaration of war\r\nby the United States against Great Britain, Napoleon's Grand Army of\r\nover 400,000 men crossed the Niemen into Russia. Six months later 4,000\r\nof that host recrossed, pursued by the Russians; and probably not more\r\nthan 100,000 of the whole number ever saw their homes again. In 1813,\r\nwhile the Americans were fighting on the ocean and on Lake Erie,\r\nNapoleon was driven out of Germany. A few weeks before the Battle of\r\nLundy's Lane, Napoleon was compelled to abdicate. Soon after the news of\r\nthe Peace of Ghent with Great Britain was received in the United States,\r\nin 1815, Napoleon broke loose from Elba; and a few months later he was\r\nagain a prisoner and sent to St. Helena.\r\n\r\n[Entered at the Postoffice at New York, N.Y., as second-class matter.\r\nCopyright, 1916, by The Mentor Association, Inc.]\r\n\r\nTo most of Europe the American War of 1812 seemed an unwarrantable flank\r\nattack in the great running fight of the nations. Russia and\r\nPrussia resented it that American statesmen should throw the weight of\r\ntheir country on the side of the great military despot of his time. They\r\nwanted none of the military and naval strength of Great Britain to be\r\ndiverted across the ocean. The suggestion was even made in Congress that\r\nthe United States ought to declare war at the same moment on both France\r\nand England. That idea has been carried out by Captain Marryat in his\r\nonce popular novel \"Midshipman Easy,\" where he describes a triangular\r\nduel between three sailors; but nations could hardly engage in such a\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by John Vanderlyn]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT AND THE WHALE\r\n\r\nNevertheless Congress found some difficulty in selecting the enemy to\r\nfight; for the conditions were remarkably like those of the year 1915.\r\nPeople used to talk then about the \"war between the elephant and the\r\nwhale\": the elephant being the land army of Napoleon, which apparently\r\nnothing could withstand, and the whale being the navy of Great Britain,\r\nwhich had command of the sea. That struggle reached a crisis in 1806,\r\nwhen the two belligerents, not being able to reach and hammer each\r\nother, did their best to hammer the neutral carrying trade, which was\r\ncarried on largely in American ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SURRENDER OF GENERAL HULL\r\n\r\nGeneral Hull surrendered to General Brock, Governor of Upper Canada, at\r\nDetroit on August 16, 1812]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ORDERS IN COUNCIL\r\n\r\nGreat Britain declared the whole French coast blockaded from Brest to\r\nthe Elbe, just as in 1915 the same power declared the whole North Sea\r\ncoast to be blockaded. By Decrees France declared the whole British\r\nIslands to be in a state of blockade, exactly as Germany recently\r\ndeclared those coasts to be a \"naval zone.\" The consequence was that the\r\nFrench captured 600 American merchantmen in the next nine years, and the\r\nBritish took 900.\r\n\r\nIn this long controversy the French were the wiliest, the British were\r\nthe most arrogant. The United States would have been justified in war\r\nagainst either of these powers, on the basis of their disregard of our\r\nright to keep up neutral trade with both belligerents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF LUNDY'S LANE\r\n\r\nIn this battle, which took place on July 25, 1814, and lasted from\r\nsunset to midnight, the Americans under General Jacob Brown were left in\r\npossession of the field, but were unable to carry away the heavy\r\nartillery which they had captured]\r\n\r\nAt that time the United States found it hard to provide a remedy. The\r\nmost obvious method was to refuse to trade with either of the nations.\r\nAccordingly an Embargo was laid by Congress in 1807, by which no cargoes\r\nof any kind were allowed to leave American ports, bound to a foreign\r\ndestination. The embargo very nearly brought England to terms; but the\r\nUnited States had not patience to wait for its results. The shipping\r\ntrade was paralyzed, and the farmers and planters could not export their\r\nsurplus. In view of these losses, Congress after fourteen months'\r\nexperience repealed the embargo.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nSince neither France nor Great Britain would accept the opportunity to\r\nmake a friend of the United States, the captures went on; and England\r\nadded the impressment of American seamen from American merchant vessels.\r\nThe idea that a subject of the British Empire could change his\r\nallegiance and become the citizen of another nation seemed to England a\r\ndangerous novelty. Still, if the great sea-power had been willing to pay\r\na little more wages to her men-of-warsmen, she could have filled her\r\nships by enlistment. If she had been content to \"press\" men from her own\r\nmerchant ships, she would not have aroused the antipathy of the\r\nAmericans. To save a few hundred thousand pounds and to assert a right\r\nto claim Englishmen who had become American citizens, Great Britain\r\ngave unpardonable offense to the little United States.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, more than 5,000 Americans had been at one time\r\nor another impressed; and 2,000 or 3,000 were actually serving on board\r\nBritish men-of-war till the hostilities began. Then, having been\r\noriginally seized without reason, they were made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL MILLER AT THE BATTLE OF CHIPPEWA\r\n\r\nAt the Battle of Chippewa on July 5, 1814. Colonel Miller with three\r\nhundred men captured a height, the key to the British position. It was a\r\ndesperate and courageous exploit]\r\n\r\nConsidering the eventual result of the war, it is striking that the\r\nUnited States government placed little dependence on its navy, but\r\nexpected to carry on a brilliant land campaign. Canada was to be\r\nconquered, and then, as Henry Clay put it, they could \"negotiate a peace\r\nat Quebec or Halifax.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not a new thought. In the Revolutionary War Canada was invaded\r\nby Montgomery and Arnold and all but annexed to the new United States.\r\nHow could Canada resist? Its population in 1812 was about 50,000; that\r\nof the United States was nearly 8,000,000. During the nine years from\r\n1803 to 1812 the United States had tried every means short of war; and\r\nthe vigorous young \"war hawks,\" headed by Henry Clay of Kentucky and\r\nJohn C. Calhoun of South Carolina, were tired of accepting what they\r\nfelt to be a standing offence to their nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES MADISON\r\n\r\nPresident of the United States, 1809-1817\r\n\r\nFrom the portrait by Gilbert Stuart]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAND WAR\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plan of invasion, several \"armies\" of 2,000 or\r\n3,000 men were pushed to the Canadian frontier; but in the very first\r\nfight the tables were turned, and Detroit was captured by the British.\r\nIt took more than a year and 20,000 men to push back the British into\r\nCanada. Five different American commanders were ignominiously headed or\r\ndefeated in attempting to invade Canada across the Niagara River or the\r\nSt. Lawrence River. Except for Harrison's little victory at the Battle\r\nof the Thames, and for the drawn Battle of Lundy's Lane, the Canadian\r\ncampaigns were all humiliating defeats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEATH OF GENERAL ROSS AT BALTIMORE\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 1814, General Ross in command of the British force\r\nadvancing on Baltimore, was shot as he rode at the head of his troops by\r\ntwo American troopers concealed in a hollow. Baltimore was defended\r\nbravely, and the British were repulsed]\r\n\r\nThis disagreeable chapter in our military history was due to the fact\r\nthat the government had made no sufficient preparation of men or\r\nmaterials, and was obliged to rely upon untrained volunteer militia.\r\nThese were men of personal courage and intelligence; and under such\r\ncommanders as Jacob Brown and Andrew Jackson they showed that they had\r\nthe instincts of soldiers. Nevertheless they were poorly drilled and\r\nequipped. In one campaign they stopped short when they reached the\r\nCanadian line, because they said they were not constitutionally bound to\r\nfight, except for the defense of their own country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES MONROE\r\n\r\nSecretary of State, 1811-1817. He also acted as Secretary of War in\r\n1814-1815. President, 1817-1825. From the portrait by John Vanderlyn]\r\n\r\nThe result was that, starting with a regular army of only 7,000, which\r\nfinally included about 50,000 men, 400,000 additional recruits were\r\nraised during the war. The total number of Canadians and British troops\r\nengaged in the war was not over 20,000. The Americans lost 30,000 men;\r\nand when the war was over the United States was not in possession of one\r\nfoot of Canadian territory, while the British were occupying about half\r\nof the present state of Maine.\r\n\r\nThis heartbreaking result ought not to be charged to the soldiers so\r\nmuch as to the administration. John Armstrong, Secretary of War, allowed\r\nthe British to land 5,000 men on the Chesapeake and to march fifty miles\r\noverland to Washington. Within a distance of two days' land travel from\r\nthat city lived nearly 100,000 able-bodied men, most of them accustomed\r\nto handle a gun. Yet the British force was allowed to capture\r\nWashington, to burn the public buildings, and to retire to its fleet\r\nalmost without losing a man. Till James Monroe became Secretary of War\r\nthe whole administration was slack and incompetent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON\r\n\r\nVictorious leader at the Battle of New Orleans. President, 1829-1837.\r\nFrom a drawing from life by J.B. Longacre]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AT SEA\r\n\r\nA proof that the defeats of the War of 1812 were not due to lack of\r\nfiber among the American people as a whole, was the brilliant success of\r\nthe operations on the high seas. Jefferson and Madison both thought the\r\nnavy would do more harm than good. The British had twice seized the\r\nlittle navy of the Danes, and it seemed as though our ships would only\r\nbe a whet to the appetite of the British naval giant. Against our 18\r\nships of war, of which only six were sizable frigates, the British could\r\noppose 170 large ships and 700 others. They had the prestige of a\r\nhundred years of naval supremacy; they had driven the French and Spanish\r\nships of war from the sea.\r\n\r\nTherefore it was a joy to the nation when, seven weeks after the\r\noutbreak of the war, the frigate _Constitution_ captured the _Guerriere_\r\nand later the _Java_; then the _United States_ captured the\r\n_Macedonian_; the _Frolic_ took the _Wasp_; the _Essex_, the first\r\nAmerican ship of war to appear in the Pacific, captured numbers of\r\nBritish whalers there. In thirteen duels, one ship on each side, the\r\nAmericans won eleven victories.\r\n\r\nGradually the fleet was worn down; the _Chesapeake_ was taken by the\r\n_Shannon_; the _President_ and the _Adams_ were captured; and at the end\r\nof the war there was not a public ship on the ocean flying the flag of\r\nthe United States. However the navy in two unexpected directions won new\r\nlaurels. On Lake Erie Oliver Hazard Perry defeated the British fleet at\r\nthe battle of Put-in Bay, and sent his ever memorable despatch, \"We have\r\nmet the enemy and they are ours: two ships, two brigs, one schooner and\r\none sloop.\" On Lake Champlain, Commodore Macdonough beat the British;\r\nwhile McComb with his militia withstood and repelled the British attack\r\nat Plattsburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON\r\n\r\nHarrison was one of the few able leaders that the United States had\r\nduring the War of 1812. He was President for only one month in 1841. He\r\ndied in office.\r\n\r\nFrom the portrait of by J.B. Lambdin]\r\n\r\nWhen the cruisers were driven off the sea, the privateers continued the\r\nnaval war. At that time a merchantman could be turned into a capable\r\nfighting ship by adding strengthening timbers and providing the\r\nnecessary guns. Such a ship, when commissioned as a privateer by the\r\nUnited States government, could capture the enemy's merchantmen and on\r\noccasion fight small cruisers. For instance, the brig _Yankee_, 160 tons\r\nburden, eighteen guns, 120 men, captured twenty-nine prizes, one of\r\nwhich sold for more than $500,000. The money was divided equally between\r\nthe owners and the men on board. The privateers together captured about\r\n2,000 British vessels; though over 1,500 American vessels were captured\r\nby the English. The whole British nation felt the shock of this\r\nunexpected naval resistance; and it was the pressure of the shippers and\r\nshipowners of England which caused that power to make favorable terms of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy, Harper's Magazine Copyright, Harper & Brothers\r\n\r\nPERRY RECEIVING THE SURRENDER OF THE BRITISH COMMANDERS ABOARD THE\r\n\"LAWRENCE\"\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by W.J. Aylward]\r\n\r\nFor a hundred years experts have been trying to find out just why the\r\nUnited States was so successful in the naval war. The British newspapers\r\nof the day tried to prove that it was because they called a vessel a\r\nfrigate when it was really bigger and stronger than the British frigate.\r\nThat did not affect the captain of the _Guerriere_ when he accepted\r\nbattle with the _Constitution_: he evidently thought that he had size\r\nand power enough to capture his adversary. The Americans appear to have\r\nhad heavier guns, better training in handling the guns, better\r\nmarksmanship, to have been quicker and smarter.\r\n\r\nIt was the privateers that were in the long run most effective. The\r\nLondon Times complained toward the end of 1814 that \"there are\r\nprivateers off this harbor which plunder every vessel coming in or going\r\nout, notwithstanding we have three line of battle, six frigates, and\r\nfour sloops here.\" The Morning Chronicle complained that a great part of\r\nthe coast of Ireland had \"been for above a month under the unresisted\r\ndominion of a few petty 'fly-by-nights' from the blockaded ports of the\r\nUnited States--a grievance equally intolerable and disgraceful.\" The\r\nAnnual Register thought it a mortifying reflection that, notwithstanding\r\na navy of a thousand ships, \"it was not safe for a vessel to sail\r\nwithout convoy from one part of the English or Irish Channel to\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From \"Naval Actions of The War of 1812,\" by James Barnes.\r\n\r\nCopyright 1896, by Harper & Brothers\r\n\r\nTHE NIAGARA BREAKS THE ENGLISH LINE\r\n\r\nWhen Perry's flagship, the \"Lawrence,\" was riddled by the enemy, he\r\ntransferred himself in a small boat to the \"Niagara.\" This ship broke\r\nthe British line, and then the battle was won. From a painting by\r\nCarlton T. Chapman]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1915, a British squadron captured the German frigate _Dresden_\r\nin the neutral Chilean waters of the Island of Juan Fernandez. A similar\r\nepisode occurred in 1814, when the United States ship _Essex_ was\r\ncornered and destroyed by two British vessels in the harbor of\r\nValparaiso. The American privateer _General Armstrong_ was also cut out\r\nand destroyed by the British under the guns of the Portuguese fort at\r\nFayal in the Azores.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT ON THE AMERICANS\r\n\r\nOn the face of it there was not much cause for congratulation in a war\r\nin which the United States trebled its national debt and lost 30,000 men\r\nand 1,500 merchant ships, without gaining any territory and without\r\nsecuring any promise at the end of the war that the disturbance of\r\nneutral trade and the impressment of American seamen would not begin\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMODORE DAVID PORTER\r\n\r\nThe Commander of the \"Essex\"\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Chappel]\r\n\r\nAnother group of troubles arose from the fact that the New England\r\nStates were against the war from the beginning, refused to allow their\r\nmilitia to join in the forces intended to invade Canada, and in 1814\r\nsent delegates to a convention at Hartford. That convention sat in\r\nsecret, and nobody knows exactly what was said; but the resolutions\r\npassed by it and sent out to the country demanded changes in the\r\nConstitution which would have made it hard to carry on a federal\r\ngovernment. Fortunately before they could be presented to Congress the\r\nnews of peace was received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From \"Naval Actions of the War of 1812,\" by James Barnes.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1886, by Harper & Brothers\r\n\r\nTHE \"ESSEX\" BEING CUT TO PIECES\r\n\r\nThe \"Essex\" was under the command of David Porter, and drove British\r\nshipping from the Pacific Ocean. The vessel was finally destroyed by the\r\n\"Phoebe\" and the \"Cherub.\" From a painting by Carlton T. Chapman]\r\n\r\nThese uncomfortable facts may be cheerfully admitted in view of a strong\r\nlist of reasons for national congratulation. One was the notable victory\r\nof Andrew Jackson at New Orleans, January 8, 1815, after peace had been\r\nmade, though neither of the armies knew it. Critics have pointed out\r\nthat Jackson was slow in divining where the British would strike; that\r\nhe threw up no sufficient intrenchments; that if the British had placed\r\ncannon on the west side of the river, they could have fired into his\r\nrear and compelled him to retreat. All that does not diminish the glory\r\nof Jackson's victory. He showed the energy and determination which\r\nbrought together a force of 3,500 men, mostly raw militia. This little\r\ncommand lying behind the lines at Chalmette received the attack of 6,000\r\nmen. Over 2,000 of the British attacking column were sacrificed, and\r\nJackson remained master of the field, with a loss of seventy-one.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant success proved that Jackson was a good soldier, which in\r\ndue time helped to make him President of the United States. It proved\r\nalso that American militia behind breastworks could repel the attacks of\r\ntwice their number of experienced soldiers who had recently helped to\r\noverthrow Napoleon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN JAMES LAWRENCE\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Gilbert Stuart]\r\n\r\nThe greatest result of the War of 1812 was to make the Americans realize\r\nat once their weakness and their strength. Just at the end of the war\r\nRobert Fulton put on the waters of the Hudson a steamship of war,\r\nforerunner of the majestic steam fleets of today. Our forefathers\r\nsuffered for want of roads by which they could convey their armies and\r\ntheir supplies to the frontiers. Therefore they set out to remedy that\r\ncondition, and four years after the peace they had the Cumberland Road\r\ncompleted from the upper Potomac to the Ohio River. Six years later the\r\nErie Canal was opened to Lake Erie. The people had suffered for want of\r\na national bank during the war: in 1816 Congress created one. Their\r\ntrade had been disturbed for over twenty years: in 1816 they passed a\r\ntariff, designed to establish American manufactures. War, and especially\r\nsuch a disappointing war as that of 1812, has many bad effects upon a\r\nnation; but it does strengthen the feeling of a common danger and a\r\ncommon duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM BAINBRIDGE\r\n\r\nCommodore in the United States Navy.\r\n\r\nFrom the portrait by J.W. Jarvis]\r\n\r\nThe War of 1812 also for the first time gave the United States an\r\nunquestioned place in the sisterhood of modern nations. Though the\r\npopulation in 1815 was only about eight and a half millions, the success\r\nof the navy inspired a wholesome respect for Yankee ships and Yankee\r\nsailors. In place of the captured ships a new merchant marine was\r\nquickly provided, which developed into the famous clipper ships, the\r\ntriumph of American skill and the glory of the seas. From this time\r\ndates the friendship of several European nations, particularly of\r\nRussia, whose Czar Alexander was a friend and correspondent of Thomas\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From \"Naval Actions of the War of 1812,\" by James Barnes.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1896, by Harper & Brothers\r\n\r\nTHE \"CHESAPEAKE\" LEAVING THE HARBOR\r\n\r\nCaptain Lawrence, commanding the \"Chesapeake,\" was mortally wounded, and\r\nhis vessel was captured by the \"Shannon\" off Boston Roads. It was in\r\nthis engagement that he uttered his famous words, \"Don't give up the\r\nship.\" From a painting by Carlton T. Chapman]\r\n\r\nOur former enemy, Great Britain, was converted into a respectful friend\r\nwho saw the advantages of friendship. The proof is that eight years\r\nlater George Canning asked the United States to join in a declaration\r\nwith Great Britain in favor of the Latin-American States; and the idea\r\ndeveloped into our independent Monroe Doctrine. The American people were\r\nentitled to forget their weakness and defeats; for the net result of the\r\nWar of 1812 was to inspire the greatest naval and colonial power in the\r\nworld with a respect for American character and an acceptance of the\r\nUnited States as a great National power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From \"Naval Actions of the War of 1812,\" by James Barnes.\r\nCopyright, 1896, by Harper & Brothers\r\n\r\nTHE \"CONSTITUTION\" TAKING THE \"CYANE\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Cyane\" was one of the crack sloops of war in the English service.\r\nThe \"Constitution\" after a running fight captured both this ship and the\r\n\"Levant.\" From a painting by Carlton T.

It was unique in history as a battle\r\nfought after a war was over. And it was the only real victory won by the\r\nland forces of America in the War of 1812. It was one of the most\r\nconclusive battles in history, and a brilliant demonstration of the\r\nmilitary ability of Andrew Jackson. General Jackson believed in\r\npreparedness. During the second year of the War of 1812 he learned that\r\nthe British planned to invade Louisiana, so he concentrated troops four\r\nmiles below New Orleans in a line of entrenchments a mile in length,\r\nextending from the Mississippi River far into the swamp, making both\r\nends impassable. Jackson had 3,500 expert marksmen at his command. They\r\nwere a strange mixture of men, including long-limbed, hard-faced\r\nbackwoodsmen, Portuguese and Norwegian seamen, dark-skinned Spaniards\r\nand swarthy Frenchmen, besides about 1,000 militiamen selected from the\r\nCreoles of Louisiana. They were a rough and violent lot. Theodore\r\nRoosevelt characterizes them as: \"Soldiers who, under an ordinary\r\ncommander, would have been fully as dangerous to themselves and their\r\nleaders as to their foes. But,\" he adds, \"Andrew Jackson was of all men\r\nthe one best fitted to manage such troops. Even their fierce natures\r\nquailed before the ungovernable fury of a spirit greater than their own;\r\nand their sullen, stubborn wills were bent before his unyielding temper\r\nand iron hand.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 8th of January, 1815, General Pakenham advanced\r\nupon New Orleans with a force of about 6,000 trained and experienced\r\nfighting men. Jackson knew that the British would have to cross his\r\nentrenchments before entering the city. So he placed his force of fierce\r\nand deadly fighters within the trenches and opened upon the enemy with\r\nvolley after volley. The mortality on the British side was frightful.\r\nThe lines wavered and General Pakenham fell in front of his troops.\r\nUtterly demoralized by the withering blast of the American muskets,\r\nthese hardy British veterans hurried to their camp and escaped to ships.\r\nThe British lost about 2,000 men killed, wounded and prisoners, while in\r\nthe American lines there were only about seventy casualties.\r\n\r\nSo weak and ineffective had been the showing of the American forces in\r\nseveral of the battles of this war that they had incurred the contempt\r\nof the enemy. In one final, brilliant blow General Jackson restored the\r\nprestige of American arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Signature of] W.D.

Stephen\r\nDecatur, Jr., was born at Sinnepuxent, Maryland, on January 5, 1779. He\r\nentered the American navy as a midshipman in 1798 on board the frigate\r\n_United States_. A year later he was promoted to lieutenant and in that\r\nrank saw a little service in the short war with France.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 Decatur sailed as first lieutenant of the _Essex_, one of\r\nCommodore Dale's squadron, to the Mediterranean. As a result of a duel\r\nwith a British Officer--which resulted fatally for the\r\nEnglishman--Decatur was sent home for a time. In 1803 he was back in the\r\nMediterranean in command of the _Enterprise_. He distinguished himself\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\nConceiving the daring idea of recapturing or destroying the frigate\r\n_Philadelphia_, which had been captured by the pirates and lay in the\r\nharbor of Tripoli, on February 31, 1804, he manned a little boat called\r\nthe _Intrepid_, with seventy volunteers, and, braving the enemy, he\r\nreached the _Philadelphia_, set it afire and got away, with the loss of\r\nonly one man.\r\n\r\nFor this gallant achievement Congress voted Decatur thanks and a sword.\r\nHe was also promoted to captain.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, Decatur was engaged in all the attacks on Tripoli from\r\n1804 to 1805. In the War of 1812 the ship which he commanded, the\r\n_United States_, captured the British vessel, the _Macedonian_, after a\r\ndesperate struggle. In 1813 he was appointed commodore to command a\r\nsquadron in New York Harbor, which was blockaded by the British. In 1813\r\nhe attempted to get to sea to break the blockade with the _United\r\nStates_, the _Hornet_, and the _Macedonian_, which had been by this time\r\nconverted into an American ship. A superior British squadron forced\r\nDecatur to run into the Thames, and he lay off New London for several\r\nmonths. He sent a challenge to the commander of the blockading squadron\r\nto come on and fight, but the challenge was not accepted.\r\n\r\nAt length, unable to get to sea, two of the ships were dismantled, and\r\nDecatur returned to New York, where he took command of a squadron\r\ndestined for the East Indies. In the frigate _President_ he put to sea\r\non the 14th of January, 1815. The blockading British squadron pursued\r\nthe ship, and after a desperate running fight forced Decatur to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward Decatur returned to the United States, peace between\r\nEngland and America was declared. But the Barbary pirates were once more\r\ngiving trouble. Decatur took a command in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nHe arrived before Algiers on June 22, 1815, and immediately demanded a\r\ntreaty from the Dey. His terms were very brief: no more annual tribute\r\nor ransom for prisoners; all enslaved Americans to be released; and no\r\nAmerican ever again to be held as a slave. The question of tribute was\r\nthe most difficult to settle. The Dey feared that other European powers\r\nwould demand the same terms.\r\n\r\n\"Even a little powder,\" said the Dey, \"might prove satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" replied Decatur, \"you insist upon receiving powder as tribute, you\r\nmust expect to receive the balls with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn forty-eight hours the treaty was negotiated, giving to the United\r\nStates privileges and immunities never before granted by a Barbary state\r\nto a Christian power.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 a quarrel arose between Commodore James Barron and Decatur. They\r\nmet at Bladensburg, Maryland, on March 22, 1820. At the first shots\r\nBarron was dangerously wounded. Decatur was also hit, and he died the\r\nsame evening.\r\n\r\n  PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n  ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4.

He\r\nwas a son of Dr. Absalom Bainbridge, a Physician of the town. He\r\nreceived comparatively little education; for he went to sea in a\r\nmerchant vessel at the age of fourteen. A few years after this, while he\r\nwas the mate of the ship _Hope_, on a voyage to Holland he saved the\r\nlife of his captain, who had been seized by a mutinous crew with the\r\nintention of throwing him overboard. On his return home, because of his\r\ngood conduct and abilities, he was promoted to the command of a ship in\r\nthe Dutch trade. He continued in command of various ships until 1798.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the war between France and Great Britain made it\r\ndifficult for neutrals to carry on trade. Therefore as master of a ship\r\nBainbridge had to elude, or beat off a great deal of interference on the\r\npart of French and British ships alike.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, when war was about to break out between France and the United\r\nStates and the American navy was organized, Bainbridge was appointed\r\ncommander of the United States Schooner _Retaliation_, of fourteen guns,\r\nwith the rank of lieutenant. In November his ship was captured by two\r\nFrench frigates--but it was released shortly afterward.\r\n\r\nBainbridge sailed for the West Indies as master commandant of the brig\r\n_Norfolk_. During this cruise he gave protection to the merchant trade\r\nof the United States and captured several of the enemy's merchantmen.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 Bainbridge was promoted to the rink of captain. On the frigate\r\n_George Washington_ he sailed to the Dey of Algiers with presents. These\r\n\"presents\" were bribes which the United States paid to the Algerian\r\npirates to secure exemption from capture for its merchant ships in the\r\nMediterranean. Bainbridge was disgusted at having to pay the tributes.\r\nWhile his ship was at Algiers war was declared by the pirates against\r\nFrance, and the French consul and citizens were ordered to leave the\r\ncountry in forty-eight hours. Captain Bainbridge received them all on\r\nhis ship and landed them safely.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States found that bribes to the pirates did not protect\r\ntheir commerce, they decided to use force. Captain Bainbridge was given\r\ncommand of the frigate _Philadelphia_, and sailing to Algiers, blockaded\r\nTripoli. Being driven from his cruising grounds, Bainbridge pursued a\r\nstrange ship that was trying to break the blockade. He gave chase, but\r\nran upon a reef on the morning of October 31, 1803. The pirates\r\nimmediately attacked, and when the ship could no longer be defended they\r\ncaptured and scuttled her, imprisoning the officers and crew. After a\r\ntreaty of peace between the Dey and the United States had been\r\nconcluded, the Americans were released on February 3, 1805.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bainbridge returned for a time to the merchant service, but when\r\nthe War of 1812 broke out, he was appointed to command the United States\r\nfrigate _Constitution_. In this ship he captured two British frigates\r\nand many merchantmen. On his return he was received with an enthusiastic\r\nwelcome by his countrymen. The _Constitution_ became an object of\r\nnational pride, and because of the little damage it sustained in the\r\nnumerous encounters in which it engaged, received the popular name of\r\n\"Old Ironsides.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the War of 1812, Bainbridge once more served\r\nagainst the Barbary pirates. Later he served on the board of navy\r\ncommissioners. Commodore Bainbridge died in Philadelphia on July 28,\r\n1833.\r\n\r\n  PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n  ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR.

His father was Christopher Raymond Perry, captain in\r\nthe navy. His first position was that of a midshipman on the sloop of\r\nwar _General Greene_, in 1798. The first action that he saw was against\r\nthe Barbary pirates. In this war he secured the affection and respect of\r\nthe officers and men in the squadron.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 he was a lieutenant-commandant in the schooner _Revenge_. This\r\nvessel was attached to the squadron under Commodore Rodgers, and was\r\nemployed in Long Island Sound to uphold the embargo which the United\r\nStates had at that time put upon trade with England and France.\r\n\r\nShortly after, the war with England began. Perry was placed in command\r\nof a flotilla at Newport, but was not pleased with this commission, and\r\nbegged to be ordered to Lake Ontario. His wish was granted, and he and\r\nhis men--who eagerly volunteered to go with him--re-inforced Commodore\r\nChauncey on the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at Lake Ontario, however, Chauncey ordered Perry to Lake\r\nErie to superintend the building of vessels. The English had a powerful\r\nforce on the Great Lakes and the United States wanted to build\r\nsufficient ships to meet them. Perry worked hard, and on August 4, 1813,\r\nhe got his squadron into the deep waters of Lake Erie. This squadron\r\nconsisted of three brigs, five schooners, and one sloop. On the 10th of\r\nSeptember Perry met the British fleet with Captain Robert H. Barclay in\r\ncommand in the Battle of Put-in Bay. This was the great fight of Perry's\r\nlife, and he fought it with skill, bravery and perseverance.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this victory were felt all over the United States.\r\nNational pride was kindled and the people celebrated the victory with\r\nenthusiasm. In reward Perry was made a captain in the navy and received\r\nthe thanks of Congress.\r\n\r\nHowever, the gallant officer did not rest upon his laurels, and, seeing\r\nno more hostile fleets to conquer, offered himself as aid to General\r\nHarrison, who was then pursuing the British, and took part in the Battle\r\nof Moravian Town on October 5th. When Virginia and Maryland were invaded\r\nby the English, under General Ross and Admiral Cockburn, Perry had a\r\ncommand on the Potomac.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the War of 1812 Captain Perry took command of the _Java_,\r\na frigate of the first class, and sailed with Commodore Stephen Decatur\r\nto punish the Dey of Algiers, who had plundered the commerce of the\r\nUnited States when this country was busy during the war of 1812. This\r\nexpedition, which reached the Mediterranean in June, 1815, was\r\nsuccessful, and Perry returned to the United States. While the _Java_\r\nwas lying at Newport in mid-winter, he received information that a\r\nmerchant vessel was on a reef about five or six miles from that place,\r\nand that the crew were in danger. Leaping into his barge he turned to\r\nhis oarsmen and said, \"Come, my boys, we are going to the relief of\r\nshipwrecked seamen; pull away!\" The eleven men of the crew were rescued.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 Perry was sent in the _John Adams_ to the West Indies with\r\nsealed orders. Pirates had swarmed in that vicinity, and his commission\r\nwas to drive them from the sea. He executed his orders with diligence,\r\nbut unfortunately caught yellow fever and died on August 23, 1819, at\r\nPort of Spain, in Trinidad. Every tribute of national grief was paid to\r\nhis memory, and he was buried with military honors.\r\n\r\n  PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n  ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 3, SERIAL No. 103\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.",
